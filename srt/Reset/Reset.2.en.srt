Sir, stop the bus! Let everyone get out, it's too dangerous!

00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,220
- Exactly.
- The bus is not allowed to stop before arriving at the bus stop. That's the rule.

103

The bus windows are already damaged. What regulations do you still care about?

- You still have the nerves to talk. You were the one who broke the windows.

That safety hammer is only to be used when there's a critical situation.

Anyway, Sir, you need to stop the bus, let me out.

What do you mean stop the bus!? Don't you see there's an intersection?

110
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,400
Why is it that we can never get off the bus like this?

111
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,410
I don't know either. I have tried it a lot of times before.

112
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,700
I also don't know how we entered this loop.

But the number of times I've experienced this is way higher than yours.

116
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,250
Besides, there's also no use in finally getting off the bus.

117
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,840
And it's already too late.

118
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,650
Are we supposed to wait and die then?

119
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,970
Right, we can only wait and die.

120
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:46,400
But can you not be impulsive next time and listen until I've finished speaking, okay?

Actually, take a hint.

Although there's a pain in your heart, it's not going to hurt you.

00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,230
It's not real.

126
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:40,540
You probably won't believe it, but I've never been that impulsive before.

00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,660
I believe it.

128
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,380
How on earth did this loop happen?

129
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,950
Have we been... been hypnotized or something?

130
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,190
I actually hope that we've been hypnotized.

131
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:59,800
I also don't know how we've encountered this kind of strange occurrence.

132
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,030
I pulled you out of the bus that one time earlier. I just wanted to rescue you.

133
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,370
I really didn't think it would pull you into this loop.

134
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,360
So, what you mean is that I entered the loop

135
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,380
because you pulled me out of the bus?

136
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,770
Exactly.

137
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:18,140
You've experienced it twice,

138
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,820
but I've already experienced it multiple times before you.

139
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,990
I kept trying to use every possible way I could think of to free myself from this loop.

140
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,200
I also tried every possible way I could think of to get off the bus,

141
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,550
but I cannot get off the bus at all.

142
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:33,190
Until the time I... I framed you for being a pervert.

143
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:39,850
So there is no point in getting off because we will still end up back here.

144
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,800
Right now, it seems like that is the case.

145
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,090
I also don't know what's going to happen later.

146
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,970
Here is what I thought.

147
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,000
Wasn't our way of thinking always directed towards getting off the bus before?

148
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,460
We thought getting off the bus would solve the problem.

149
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,930
But just now, we also realized that forcing our way out of the bus is too difficult.

150
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:04,780
Besides, when we are finally off the bus, it's useless.

151
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,650
We've already confirmed that point, right?

152
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,460
Then, if we think the other way around,

153
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,220
we don't need to get off the bus anymore, right?

154
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,170
Look. Every time we arrive in front of this intersection and

155
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,950
the red light goes off, there will be a take out delivery bike

156
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,270
coming from that side and it will forcibly come over here.

157
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,570
And after that? In order to avoid him, we will turn in this direction

158
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,280
and then bump into the fuel tanker on that side.

159
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,630
After that, two cars will collide and then explode.

160
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,820
So I'm thinking... if we can prevent the traffic accident,

161
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,840
then we can prevent the explosion.

162

- Yes.

- Can you drive faster?

169
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,760
- You can drive faster, too.
- Can you stop the bus?

00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,820
Jiang Feng has already rushed over.

316
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,360
Were you able to get in contact with the girl?

317
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,820
We have been trying, but the phone is off this whole time.

318
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,280
Keep calling.

319
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,100
Could it be a prank call?

320
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,710
Why hang up such an important call?

321
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:57,100
The operator said the caller may have been coerced.

322
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,110
During the call, a man voice was heard forcing the person to hang up,

323
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,550
so the phone was turned off this whole time.

324
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:05,710
Since it hasn't exploded does that mean the police have already solved the case?

325
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:10,220
It can't be that fast. It's only been a few minutes.

326
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,890
It's off. Right.

327
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,520
When I was at the hospital, the police came and asked me questions.

328
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,940
They said it exploded at 1:42 p.m.

329
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,410
And this time, I used the same excuse,

330
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,560
and if it affected the car speed,

331
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:29,250
this time the car will also be at 1:42 p.m...

332
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,310
Wait.

333
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,860
When I reported I said there was a bomb in the bus,

334
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,630
but if we affected the car speed,

335
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,470
then the bus won't explode because of the bomb.

336
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:41,760
It will explode because it collides with the oil tank at the intersection.

337
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,490
As long as the car explodes, the police will realize that there was a bomb sooner or later.

338
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:49,210
Unless the bomb is on the bridge.

339
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:55,380
When you got out of the car last time, you weren't at the scene.

340
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,680
How come you ended up in the hospital?

341
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,920
I didn't go far, I was right there.

342
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,520
When it exploded, the biker got scared and crashed into me.

343
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,780
You can feel the explosion from here?

344
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,820
Please give me your name and contact information.

345
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,500
My name is Li Shiqing. Please contact this phone number.

346
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,120
Which characters?

347
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,970
Wood, son, “Li”. “Shi” for poem. And “Qing” for feelings.

348
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,400
Where are you now?

349
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,400
I’m at Qing Shui Xiang. T-this place is near the foot of the bridge.

350
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,360
Do you know where the bomb is on the bus?

351
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,820
I don’t know, don’t ask me again, there’s really not enough time.

352
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,390
Turn off your phone.

353
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,730
- Did you check the surveillance camera at the intersection?
- I checked.

354
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:47,780
On the surface, the explosion seems to have started

355
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,590
with the collision of the oil tank truck and bus.

356
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:53,750
But if there was indeed a bomb on the bus, then it would be too coincidental.

357
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:57,500
Go check the surveillance cameras near Qing Shui Xiang immediately.

358
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,440
You must check carefully.

359
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,080
Cong Rong!

360
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,610
City Criminal Investigation's Zhang Cheng's phone call.

361
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,740
Hello?

362
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,910
I'm the captain of the City Criminal Investigation Bureau's Zhang Cheng.

363
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,330
What's the situation at the crime scene?

364
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:24,870
Captain Zhang, there is a lot of casualty on the scene.

365
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:27,410
especially at the source of the explosion, with the oil tanker.

366
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:31,650
You listen, the phone report we received said that there was a bomb on the bus.

367
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:34,150
You guys must be careful to prevent a second explosion.

368
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:37,220
Please, confirm whether there's a bomb as soon as possible.

369
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,010
Understood. After the exclusion of the possibility of secondary dangerous explosives,

370
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,960
we will immediately investigate the bomb source on the bus.

371
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,660
Okay, let's keep in touch.

372
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,720
Okay, rest assured.

373
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,720
Hello, this is Jialin City 110-call center.

374
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,080
I want to report a case. There’s a bomb on Bus 45.

375
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,980
They’re about to cross the bridge now.

376
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:07,190
Then before, in every loop, it will also explode?

377
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,710
How did you even get into the loop?

378
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,350
Actually, the few times before,

379
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:14,480
I didn't even have time to react before it ended.

380
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,600
After, I would just often tell people that this bus would have an accident,

381
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,630
but no one was willing to believe me.

382
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,630
Even the driver wouldn't let me get off mid-road.

383
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:25,350
Only that time when I was with you, I was able to get off the bus.

384
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,470
After, I got into the hospital

385
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,520
and then, the police kept interrogating me constantly.

386
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,280
I was too tired, so I slowly dozed off.

387
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,850
And then...then, you know the rest.

388
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,580
Then why would the police find you?

389
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,640
Because there are surveillance cameras near where we got off and the police saw it.

390
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,250
Then this...

391
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:53,400
We already called the police anyway. We will be interrogated soon.

392
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,850
- Is your phone still off?
- Yes.

393
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,460
How about we keep our phones turned off first?

394
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,990
We need to do some research first.

395
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,560
This way.

396
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,530
[Video Surveillance Research Room]

397
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:28,340
- Captain Zhang.
- Sit.

398
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:33,200
Look, the person that made the report was indeed at Qing Shui Xiang.

399
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:39,070
1:38 p.m., the time we received the first report.

400
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:42,180
Why would they get off here? This is not a bus stop.

401
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,500
No. The last stop is Yanjiang East Road Station.

402
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,290
The next stop is Yanjiang West Road Station.

403
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,860
They would have to cross the bridge to arrive at the next stop.

404
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,960
Captain Zhang, please look at this.

405
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:10,530
1:42 p.m., the exact time of the explosion.

406
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,710
Did they confirm there would be an explosion before leaving the pedestrian bridge?

407
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:16,980
Or maybe they wanted to see if the police can prevent the explosion.

408
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,610
Chief Du, their identity has been confirmed.

409
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,370
- Did you contact them?
- Their phones are turned off.

410
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,180
Xiao Jiang.

411
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,640
- You go ask the technical department about this situation.
- Okay.

412
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,370
Xiao Heyun.

413
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:03,150
When I was at the hospital,

414
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,820
I saw those birds.

415
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,890
What about the birds?

416
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:12,400
I feel like they are circling us.

417
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:20,550
Do you think may be

418
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:24,170
we are already dead.

419
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,010
I have heard a saying that,

420
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,530
when a person suffers a wrongful death,

421
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:33,820
his soul is trapped at the place of his death.

422
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:38,590
Then, he will keep repeating what he did before his death.

423
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,630
Just like how we are.

424
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:46,000
We are trapped on the bus and dying again and again.

425
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,230
We are not quite the same.

426
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:53,060
Think about it. We experienced things we didn't experience before.

427
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:56,470
And have you heard of another saying?

428
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:59,730
After the ghost finds his replacement, he can leave the loop.

429
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:01,120
You already found one.

430
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,240
I didn't. No.

431
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,290
I didn't want you to be my replacement.

432
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,100
- I don't mean...
- When I pulled you off the bus,

433
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,140
I wanted to save as many people as possible.

434
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,790
I really wanted to save you.

435
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:17,750
Sorry, I didn't know this would happen.

436
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:23,030
Wait. Out of all the loops, you only managed to get me off the bus?

437
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,660
Why me?

438
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,590
Probably because...

439
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,950
I tried so many times,

440
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,350
and you were the only one who wanted to help in the way I wanted.

441
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:48,170
No good deed goes unpunished.

442
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:52,490
Actually, one thing kept worrying me.

443
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,420
We never saw the bomb.

444
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,360
If the police ask us where the bomb was, what do we tell them?

445
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,220
Just tell them the truth.

446
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,960
Tell them we are in a time loop?

447
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,460
They wouldn't believe us.

448
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,990
What else can we say?

449
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,150
We didn't ignite the bomb.

450
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,570
And we have no motive either.

451
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,920
If the police don't believe us,

452
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,740
they probably would think we are delusional.

453
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:21,040
Or even worse, they would treat us as suspects.

454
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,490
Police investigation requires evidence. Without evidence, they have to let us go.

455
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:28,710
If we don't make up a good excuse and we don't have the same story,

456
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:32,510
that would only make us more suspicious. Why do it?

457
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,880
Chief Du.

458
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:48,580
The surveillance footage along the path tracked them to Qingshui Park.

459
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,820
The park layout is complex with sparse surveillance.

460
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,660
In addition, it's summertime where the flourishing plants create many blind spots.

461
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,690
- Get a GPS car there.
- Got it.

462
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,350
- Xiao Jiang.
- Master.

463
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:59,620
- Get some people to go to the park with me.
- Yes.

464
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,960
Ye Qian, go to the security department

465
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,850
and track all the park surveillance. Keep me updated.

466
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,570
- Send that image to me.
- Got it.

467
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:09,760
Chief Du., I'll get the people over there.

468
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,490
Okay.

473
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:06,950
♫  I heard my heart beat  ♫

474
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:14,260
♫  You are my only  ♫

475
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:24,350
♫  Always believed in me  ♫

476
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:29,560
♫  I will never be that weak-willed me  ♫

477
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,330
♫  I'll be strong with you by me  ♫

478
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:39,620
♫  How can I let you go away  ♫

479
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:46,280
♫  You are my only  ♫

480
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:53,190
♫  Always on my mind  ♫

481
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:59,990
♫  But it's so hard to find out why  ♫

482
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,360
♫  Dreaming of you every night  ♫

483
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:09,860
♫  I wonder why you never know  ♫

484
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:17,460
♫  You are my only  ♫

485
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:25,230
♫  Always be there waiting for me  ♫

486
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:28,930
♫  I will never leave  ♫

487
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:34,590
♫  I will be right there for you  ♫

488
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:43,130
♫  It seems like the real meaning  ♫

489
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,400
♫  To me  ♫
