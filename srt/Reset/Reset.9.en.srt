The current situation at the scene is like this.

In the call before the explosion,

21
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,050
it doesn't mention anything about a bomb.

22
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,660
They only said that there was a murderer on the bus.

23
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,910
In other words, the bomb is not in an obvious location.

24
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,530
It is obvious.

25
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,660
This is a man-made explosion.

26
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,640
Even so, the surveillance cameras on the bus are probably ruined by the explosion.

27

We have no idea what happened on the bus,

28
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,460
but based on the surveillance footage on the road, we can deduce

29
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,170
these two that came off the bus are the main suspects.

This young girl is Li Shiqing. She is 20 years old.

She is a junior at Jialin College.

She got on the bus near the campus.

He is the founder of a game company. He got on the bus in the Gaoxing District.

Yezi, have you found anything from the surveillance footage from Yanjiang East Road to Danqing Road?

56
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,520
There are three ways to go from Danqing Road.

57
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,290
Two of them didn't have any surveillance cameras, we eliminated those two.

58
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,300
The only one left is to Gangwu New Village.

Gangwu New Village?

60
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,520
There are buildings that are very close to each other. They have very few surveillance cameras and have lots of blind spots.

I kicked the person out already.

104
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,870
I even removed the bed.

106
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,060

119
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,490
He didn't go into details. He only mentioned

120

It's not your fault. It's really not your fault.

136
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,720
When I grabbed the pot, I thought I would have done the same thing.

137
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,650
Also, you need to know, she was the one who wanted to blow up the bus.

138
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:32,380
The moment she was holding the bomb and got on the bus,

139

she had decided to die.

140
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,800
I'd rather be blown up than kill someone.

141

I didn't want to kill anyone.

Also, what's his source of income?

Old Jiao is a good man.

160
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,800
He told me something happened to his construction site.

161
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,180
The construction work has been suspended. He was looking for a job every day.

162
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,170
He told me one of his co-workers became a good samaritan

163
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,250

Do you have any Melatonin?

326
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,030
Over there.

327
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,880
I was focused on driving. I didn't know there were people on my truck.

328
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,130
The moment I stopped my truck and got ready to unload my cargo,

329
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:17,370
I turned around and those two jumped down from the back.

330
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,880
It startled me!

331
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,370
The man was tall and skinny,

332
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:24,250
but he had blood over him. I saw it.

333
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:28,070
That girl, not tall, but has a pretty face.

334
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,440
Those two people.

335
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,280
That's right. That bag, they left it on my truck.

336
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,080
Their blood was smudged over the sculptures.

337
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,400
Take a look.

338
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,060
- Is it these two?
- Yes.

339
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,970
It's the two of them. Definitely them.

340
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,620
Are you sure they ran that way?

341
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,620
After they got down, they took off that way in the back.

342
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,430
- That direction.
- Okay, thanks,

00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:12,060
Hello, please enter.

348
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,390
The police are here. We have to go somewhere else.

349
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:17,890
You should change your clothes too.

350
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,980
It's impossible to not have a witness here.

351

In their eyes,

I became a terrorist now.

356
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,980
I also saw it.

357
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,110
We threw away our phones and avoided the surveillance cameras,

358
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,550
yet they still managed to find us.

359
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,590
There is nowhere for us to hide from the police.

360

Miss, let me ask you something.

364
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:21,200
What is it?

365
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,040
Have you seen those two people who dressed up like that?

366
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:28,210
I've seen them.

367
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,930
Have you looked carefully?

368
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,880
That's right, it's them.

369
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,680
What time and where did you see them?

370
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,040
They were here. I was cleaning and they came out from there.

371
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,760
Both of them went inside.

372
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,590
- Are those commercials or residentials in there?
- Both.

373
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:47,160
There are two residences there and both of them are occupied.

374
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,050
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

Xiao Yuan, take a few people and check the surroundings.

00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:57,750
- See if there are any other exits.
- Yes.

- Xiao Jiang.
- Master.

378
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:01,050
Can you arrange a few people to guard the entrance?

379

- Also, take a few people with me and check inside.

If there is any truth to the information leaked by this unidentified person,

383
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,380
is a game designer in real life,

384
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,710
then we can totally use this to

385
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:24,530
find more clues.

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,730
- You four, go down.
- Yes. Got it.

387
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:56,770
Based on the game reviews, you might know

388
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:00,360
this must be coming from the bomber.

389
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,950
It is reported that

390
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:05,630
when he came up with this game idea,

391
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:09,850
it was filled with violence and bloody elements.

392
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:12,490
That's why it was never approved.

393
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,760
Later, through the game company,

394
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,890
they released official images of the game.

395
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:21,930
We can see there are a lot of images

396
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,020
full of violence and blood elements.

397

Stop listening to that nonsense.

00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,720
and use moral standards to criticize people.

406
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:56,700
They only believe what they see,

407
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,820
but very few people will think about the flip side of a question.

408
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,350
Especially in our current situation,

409
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:06,350
it's really difficult for people to understand.

410

Stop thinking about it.
