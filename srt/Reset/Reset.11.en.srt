Driver Wang is usually never late.

00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,270
I don't know what's going on with him today.

7
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,980
How about I give him a call to see where he is?

8
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,720
Hello, where are you? What's going on?

She's getting tired of waiting.

Old Wang, what is it that you're so busy with right now?

12
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,480
Besides, I had someone notify you of the interview yesterday, didn't I?

13
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,290
Old Wang, I'm telling you. This is a big deal for both you and the whole company. You...

Hello?

Reporter, why don't we do this?

16
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,730
Let's set up the camera and interview me first.

17
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,390
We've kept the two of you waiting for so long.

18
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,410
It wouldn't look good for you to go back empty-handed. I can do the interview instead of him.

19
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,940
Okay. Sure.

Thank you, thank you.

[Pick up gold and return it to its owner; embody noble virtues]

24
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,300
Speaking of "pick up gold and return it to its owner",

25
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,310
I recall that this isn't the first time Driver Wang has returned something valuable to its owner.

26
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,050
This time, he discovered a wallet that had been left by a passenger on the bus.

27
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,060
He didn't even think twice about picking up the wallet to keep it safe.

28
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,610
When the owner came looking for it,

29
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,850
none of us had imagined that there would be ¥30,000 inside. ($4,711 USD)

00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,490
He has always worked very hard, and he never complains no matter how difficult the work is.

31
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:20,710
You could say that he has fully devoted himself to doing his job well.

00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,570

What did you want to ask me before?

48
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,410
We've proven that they're working together.

49
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:59,110
I'm sorry. I-I acted rashly earlier.

50
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,110
I just... I just really didn't know what else to do.

51
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,030
Why did you react so strongly when you found out?

52
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,420
It was a feeling of

53
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:15,940
when someone you deeply trust suddenly betrays you.

54
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,750
I moved to Jialin by myself for school.

55
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,000
Every time I take this bus,

56
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,330
when I see him I always feel like he's familiar and approachable.

57
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,220
Didn't I tell you before,

58
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,800
every time I take Bus 45, I always see him?

59
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,940
I've known him for about two years.

60
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,270
Two years.

61
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,020
That just means that he's been planning this for a long time.

62
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,820
But he really doesn't seem like a bad person.

63
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,930
- He even helped me before.
- Just because someone does one nice thing

64
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,970
doesn't prove that they're a good person.

65
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:53,320
But that's why I trusted you in the beginning.

66
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,370
Think about it. He has been driving this route for so many years.

67
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,840
This means that one person was responsible for planning out the route and calculating the times

68
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,970
while the other person was responsible for making the bomb.

69
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,650
It's terrifying just to think about.

70
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,610
I know that you're sad. I can understand.

71
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:30,650
How about this? Let's get off at the next stop without arousing suspicion, that way we'll have more time to plan.

72
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,760
Actually, now that I think about it, there were several times before when our plan failed because of the driver.

73
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,310
It's just that we didn't suspect him at the time.

74
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,170
It's all my fault.

75
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,940
Why is it your fault? You didn't know what kind of person he was.

76
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,150
But do you remember

77
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:21,010
that time, in the end, that strange woman kept yelling at him.

78
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:25,200
She was saying that he went back on his word and

79
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,420
she suspected him of calling the police.

80
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,080
Do you think it's possible

81
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,340
that the driver was forced into being an accomplice?

82
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,810
Also, think about it. If he really wanted everyone on the bus to die with them,

83
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,540
then he would never have let us get off the bus,

84
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,660
but we were able to get off the bus in between stops twice.

85
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,690
The driver is the one who chooses

86
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,910
to open or close the bus doors.

87
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,440
Before getting the job,

88
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,520
bus drivers must go through different types of emergency training.

89
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,220
Encountering emergencies like having a pervert on the bus,

90
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,890
they usually call the police,

91
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:10,490
secure the doors, and settle the situation at the next stop.

92
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,010
How could he stop the bus and let you off?

93
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:19,360
In that situation, it doesn't make sense for the driver to let me get off there,

94
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,520
but he opened the doors.

95
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,800
This means that he wanted to let me get off the bus.

96
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,820
He must have wanted to save me.

97
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,380
If he really had good intentions and wanted to save lives,

98
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,360
then he shouldn't have let that lady on the bus.

99
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,980
Yes, maybe he felt bad for you and let you get off the bus twice,

100
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,800
but in the end the explosion still happened.

101
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,190
I just feel like...

102
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,840
No matter what difficulties put him in this situation,

103
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,030
this isn't the way to solve the problem.

104
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,710
Yes, maybe from your perspective he's a good person,

105
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,360
but what about all the other passengers?

106
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,880
If you were one of their loved ones, friends, what would you think?

107
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,620
Would you care about why he was forced to do this?

108
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,390
Shiqing, what we need to do is to prevent the explosion,

109
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,150
not find excuses to protect him.

110
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,330
It seems like I was right.

111
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:17,720
This was our first time seeing what would happen if we got off the bus and didn't try to intervene.

112
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,320
At 1:45 p.m., the bus explodes on the bridge.

113
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,730

I have my student ID.

118
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:59,860
Why is the school's television network reporting on things happening outside of the school?

119
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,760
We want to be more integrated with society,

120
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,300
so anything that is related to the students' lives is relevant news for us to report on.

121
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,560
You probably know this as well. From our school, the fastest way to get into the city is to take Bus 45,

122
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,520
so all the students at school are familiar with this bus route.

123
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,100
They also say that many heartwarming things have happened on that bus.

124
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,470
Of course, anything can happen on a bus,

125
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,520
but we just work in the office. We don't know anything about that.

126
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,220
Here's the thing. Last time, we did a survey at school

127
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,710
and we discovered that one of your drivers, Wang Xingde, has done many good deeds.

128
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:34,540
He's the perfect example to showcase on our next broadcast

129
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,750
so we wanted to find out more about him by asking the people around him.

130
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,660
This is also good publicity for your company.

If you guys just suddenly show up here, it's difficult for me to help you.

132
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:48,220
Even though you're students, you should still have notified us beforehand

133
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,130
or given us a letter of introduction.

134
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,840
Without understanding the driver's general background,

135
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,740
we can't write a letter of introduction.

I'll just ask you some general questions for now,

and then, later on, I'll ask the school to write an official letter of introduction.

00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:05,010
- Do they know the cause of the explosion yet?
- They're not sure. It might be a bomb that was placed on the bus.

159
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,750
Tell the mechanics who worked on the bus before it was released for use to come here immediately to assist with the investigation.

160
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:12,630
Tell them to bring the list of repairs and inspections the bus went through. Also, get ahold of any surveillance footage that captured that bus.

161
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,720
Wait a minute. Which route?

162
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,400
Bus 45.

163
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,810
- Who's the driver?
- That's why we're going to get the schedule!

164
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:24,060
Bus 45, Wang Xingde.

165
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,660
- You guys go ahead first.
- Where are you going?

166
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,750
You guys go ahead first.

[Wang Xingde]

169
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,360
So Wang Xingde isn't native here.

170
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,890
He originally didn't drive a bus, he drove a truck.

171
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,940
Before the loop, he did say it.

172
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,000
He didn't lie.

173
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,630
Why did he leave his hometown and quit his job?

174
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,270
Did he come to Jialin and drive a bus for four years

175
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,360
just to plan this attack?

176
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,840
Look at this. It says the reason he quit his job

177
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,680
was because his spouse was relocated for work.

178
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:33,030
Do you think the lady carrying the bomb is his wife?

179
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,250
It's not impossible, but if he has a spouse,

180
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,540
then why would he live in the company dorm?

181
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,960
It wasn't easy to get this,

182
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,500
but the information on here is too limited.

183
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,410
With only this information, we're not able to draw any conclusions.

184
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,770
There's probably more evidence at his dorm.

185
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,940
Maybe there's a photo of them together or something.

186

Auntie, the bus company dorm is...

189
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,410
- This is it.
- Is it upstairs?

Then what should we do?

Hello.

I lost my key. Could you come to help me break this lock?

200

Yes, it's the third floor of the Jialin bus company employee dorm.

- Who is your Uncle?
- Wang Xingde.

No need to be nervous, young lady.

Uncle Wang is a great guy.

He's honest and trustworthy, and he's pretty quiet.

He's not like an intimidating parent at all.

In the future, if the two of you stay in Jialin,

it'll be good to have a relative like his uncle around.

Little girl,

254
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,630
I don't like to interfere in other people's family matters,

255
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,010
but let me give you some advice.

256
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,580
Old Wang's wife,

257
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,710
she's definitely someone to worry about.

258
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,040
I think she's mentally unstable.

259
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,440
You need to be careful when you meet her in the future.

260
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,780
What mental health problems does she have?

261
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,490
Is that why they're getting a divorce?

262
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,260
Most likely.

263
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,450
That woman is quite good at tormenting others.

264
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,540
She causes trouble every few days.

265
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:59,720
No matter how good of a man he is, how could he continue to put up with it?

266
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,700
If their home life was so peaceful,

267
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,080
why would your Uncle Wang live here?

268
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,170
Could it be because their home is too far,

269
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,500
so it's more convenient for him to live here?

270
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,210
How could it be too far?

271
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,140
His house is in Gangwu New Village, right over there.

272
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,440
It's very convenient to commute from there.

273
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,140
Anyone could see what's happening.

274
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,170
Uncle Wang never wants to deal with her.

275
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,520
Since their marriage is already like this,

276
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,720
why not just get a divorce?

277
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,200
But that woman keeps calling here to harass him,

278
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,220
how could anyone put up with it?

279
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,410
- That's true.
- I know.

280
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:54,840
They have to get a divorce sooner or later.

281
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,970
But I heard from my boyfriend

282
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,720
that his aunt is very kind and easy to get along with.

283
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,990
He also said that their marriage is very happy.

284
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,580
Kind?

285
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,500
Kind, my foot.

286
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,920
Don't let him fool you.

287
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,590
Last month,

288
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,800
I saw it for myself.

289
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,990
In the middle of the night, Old Wang's wife called him and told him to come home.

290
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,640
It was because their house had a fire, so she asked him to come to help put it out.

291
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,160
There was a fire?

292
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,890
Also.

293
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,390

- Then we'll...
- All right.

- Thank you for your help.
- No problem, no problem.

296
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,800
- I'll be leaving.
- Okay.

297
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,430
Young lady.

298
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:52,480
You should tell your boyfriend this.

299
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,850
If he ever interferes in his uncle's family matters,

300
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,840
make sure he doesn't bring you with him.

301
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,340
Okay. Thank you.

302
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,120
No problem.

303
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,040
Thank you.

304

Here, let's regain some energy.

305
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,780
Let's go over what we know.

306
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,470
Now we know the bus driver's personal background

307
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:34,700
and we know he lives in Gangwu New Village.

308
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,350
Combined with what we saw on the bus,

309
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:40,300
that lady must be his wife.

310
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:47,280
But we still don't know anything about their motive for doing this.

311
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:54,090
Think about it carefully. You didn't see anything else when you were looking in his room just now?

312
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:57,980
I only saw what I mentioned earlier, his health report showing that he's in good health.

313
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,470
There was also a savings account book, he doesn't have much savings.

314
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:03,080
Anything else...

315
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,320
Oh right, there was an old cell phone. It looked like a really old model.

316
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,000
Did you find anything on the cell phone?

317
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,720
The phone won't turn on.

How did you come to the conclusion of 1:45 p.m.?

323
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,750
There are three points supporting this.

324
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,560
The first one was when we got off the bus at the stop.

325
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,250
We got into a conflict and you went to the police station. I was outside

326
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,310
and I saw that the police said on the news

327
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,130
that the explosion happened at 1:45 p.m.

328
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,230
The second time was when we tried to open the window and throw the bomb out.

329
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:57,240
That time, when I heard the cellphone ringtone, I looked at the time and it was 1:45 p.m.

330
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,030
The third time is this time, so we can be pretty sure of it now.

Now that you say that,

332

at that time, the driver

333

kept saying that it was time.

334
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,770
But why is it at 1:45 p.m?

335
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,370
Could it be that someone was giving them orders?

336
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,440
Like a terrorist?

337
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,400
But even if it was a terrorist attack, there would need to be a reason for it.

338
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,450
If that's the case, we also need to investigate who they're in contact with.

339
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,240
We're not the police, we won't be able to investigate it.

340

- Is this her?
- Yes, that's her.

434
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:00,760
Actually, I ultimately decided to get off the bus

435
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,770
because of this pressure cooker.

436
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:06,040
Why? What's wrong with the pressure cooker?

437
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,640
Because when she stepped onto the bus, there was a weird smell.

438
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,170
I can't quite get it but it smelt like

439
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,760
some sort of chemical.

440
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,730
I didn't mention this to my boyfriend.

441
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:19,500
I was afraid he would judge me with my conspiracy theory.

442
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,530
Since the explosion has already come out on the news, I think

443
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:26,160
that pressure cooker is questionable. You should look into it.

444

Okay.

445
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:45,990
There was a man who also got on the bus with this woman at Gangwu New Village.

Yes.

448
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,930
After they got on the bus, did they interact?

449
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,040
No. They didn't know each other.

450
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,220
We were guessing. They didn't sit together.

451
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,960
So...

452
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,120
That's right.

453
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,560
You're this certain?

454
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,570
Did this woman interact with other passengers?

455
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,520
Other people?

456
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,580
Are you suspecting her having an enemy on the bus?

457
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,610
Having an enemy is one possibility.

458
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:25,240
Accomplices could be another possibility.

459
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,630
We need to rule them out.

something like they wanted to die together.

465

Besides, we cannot confirm when they will be releasing the information of the case.

479
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,140
What if we cannot wait until the truth is revealed?

480
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,120
When we enter the next loop, we will once again start from the beginning.

481
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,230
Aren't we running around in circles?

482
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,100
I understand.

483
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,600
If we can stay at the police station longer, perhaps we can collect more information.

484
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,050
That's correct. That's our only chance.

485
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,770
Captain Zhang, these are the testimonies just now.

486
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,380
Both of them are still wandering around in the station.

487
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,040
Do you think those two guys have issues?

488
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,200
Those two young folks are testing the water.

489
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,700
The information they provided is very useful,

490
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,560
but they are obviously leading in a certain direction.

491
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:55,020
I don't know what are their intention is at this point,

492
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,090
but we will go with their flow.

493
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:00,130
Later, I will chat with them a little bit more.

494
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,120
How about this?

495
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,300
I will collect information from the outside.

496
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,830
You two go figure out what their true intention is.

497
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,100
This is Bus 45's route map.

498
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,140
Based on your memory,

499
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,690
can you recall the passenger's seating plan?

500
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,890
I think I can.

501
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:59,680
- Here.
- Thanks.

502
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,420
There were two passengers in the front.

503
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,520
There was a man standing, around 30 years old.

504
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,530
He wore a floral shirt with a bunch of keys on his waist.

505
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:15,480
He has been filming videos, he should be an internet celebrity.

506
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,770
Here, there was a muscly guy.

507
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:21,530
He was wearing a green shirt and had headphones.

508
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,360
Here, there was an old man.

509
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,720
Underneath his legs, there was a canvas bag. It's green.

510
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,020
I think the bag was holding watermelons.

511
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,010
A short hair auntie sat behind him.

512
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:33,100
She was curvy, short hair.

513
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,700
She was carrying a yellow crocheted bag. It looked like holding medications.

514
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,630
Two seats after her was a middle-age man.

515
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,570
This man was bald on top.

516
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:44,150
He also had a big suitcase next to him. We were sitting over here.

517
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:47,110
There was a man who got on the bus while we were getting off.

518
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:49,100
He was wearing black clothes.

519
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,200
And the person sitting over here.

520
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,450
The woman with the gray suit, I should call her suspect.

521
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:57,900
She had a red bag underneath her seat.

522
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,750
Young man.

523
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,270
Your memory is amazing.

524
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,900
I'm a game designer.

525
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,440
I am used to memorizing all the characters and scenarios.

526
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,120
Did you study game design?

527
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,410
Yes.

528
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:21,890
When you were at school, you must have done this kind of training.

529
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:26,400
Not really. It's my subconscious habit.

530
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,580
This kind of training is quite useful.

531
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,960
I remember when I was at the police academy,

532
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,090
I did this kind of detective training.

533
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,980
Isn't it, Ye Qian?

534
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,720
That's right.

535
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,800
Is it the case that for anywhere you go,

536
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,360
after going there just once,

537
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,150
you can memorize everything about it?

538
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,180
Just about.

539
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,070
From when you entered the police station earlier,

540
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,030
until you walked all the way in here,

541
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,400
can you use your memory

542
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,040
to draw the layout of the police station?

543
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:06,530
I can try.

544
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:12,090
Here. Let me see what you can do.

[Loyal to the party, serve the public, uphold the law, follow the rules]

[Conference Room]

552
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,010
I don't remember all of it.

553
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:06,160
Young man.

554
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,320
This is what we've found so far

555
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,570
in relation to the passengers who were on the bus at the time of the explosion.

556
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,460
Unfortunately, the pictures are very blurry.

557
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,280
And they're all images of their backsides or side profiles.

558
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,320
Could you use your memory

559
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,490
to identify them for us?

560
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:28,120
Sure.

561
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,840
Look at this.

562
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:43,400
Hello?

563
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,820
What's wrong?

564
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:54,380
It must be because she saw these pictures of the victims.

565
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:58,320
Earlier, she felt very guilty because she felt like something was wrong on the bus,

566
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,700
but she didn't do anything about it.

567
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:05,960
Do you want to go to the visitors' area first? There's a sofa there that you can lie down on.

568
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,510
We can ask you again later.

569
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,650
I'm fine.

570
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:13,220
I'll take a look myself.

571
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:19,270
Captain Zhang. We've identified the primary suspect.

572
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,580
Tao Yinghong, age 56. She's from Jiaodao.

573
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:25,320
She lives in Gangwu New Village, and she works at a chemical plant.

574
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,080
Okay.

575
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,550
Okay. I understand.

576
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,680
Captain Zhang.

577
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,280
Tao Yinghong and Wang Xingde are married.

578
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:03,020
[Jialin Police]

579
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,550
What's wrong with the girl?

580
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:36,170
I think her reaction looks like survivors' guilt.

581
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:39,180
The information they gave us was quite accurate,

582
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,900
but some of their reactions were very suspicious.

583
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,980
This case is currently in the investigation phase.

584
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:49,230
These two must stay at the police station so we can keep a close watch on them.

585
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:52,200
Old Zhang, you'll be responsible for them.

586
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,140
Has Jiang Feng found anything?

587
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,380
I already told him that the husband and wife were working together.

588
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:01,010
Currently, he's mainly investigating where the explosive materials came from.

589
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,720
Chief Du, we found it.

590
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:09,280
Before Wang Xingde came to Jialin, he was a transport squad leader at Jiaodao's Factory 27.

591
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,330
He's very experienced in driving large transport vehicles

592
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:14,340
and his record is perfectly clean. He's always been a model employee.

593
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,720
Tao Yinghong works at the Jialin chemical plant in the quality inspection department.

594
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,480
Before she started working here, she was a chemistry teacher at Jiaodao High School.

595
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,820
She has a lot of theoretical knowledge as well as practical application experience. She's even written teaching materials.

596
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,910
The bus company employees said that after starting at this job, he applied several times

597
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,950
to drive the Bus 45 route.

598
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,330
After his application was approved, he rejected

599
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:35,980
the company's offer to move him to other routes several times. He even turned down a promotion to the manager level.

600
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,540
He was determined to drive the Bus 45 route until he retired.

601
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:43,190
After Tao Yinghong started working at the Jialin chemical plant, she underwent professional training and passed the exam

602
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:47,140
before starting to work in the quality inspection department. There, she mainly worked on

603
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:51,260
sampling chemical materials, quality control analysis, and disposing of defective products.

604
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,490
At work, she was a model employee every year.

605
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:56,880
Her coworker said that she would voluntarily work overtime every day.

606
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,960
She was often the last person to leave.

607
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,250
Wang Xingde lives at the bus company employee dorm.

608
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:05,720
It's not far from here. I've already asked Xiao Yuan to head over there.

609
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,680
While working at the quality inspection department, Tao Yinghong had direct access to chemical products and raw materials.

610
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,060
And the way that chemical plants dispose of defective products is different from other industries.

611
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:16,130
They cannot be directly destroyed. So in this process,

612
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:18,940
it's normal for the materials to be diminished in quantity.

613
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,650
So I suspect that Tao Yinghong took advantage of her job

614
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:23,820
to obtain the materials needed to create the bomb.

615
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,700
Okay. I understand.

616
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,120
Tao Yinghong has a background in chemistry and the practical skills needed.

617
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,170
She also has access to raw chemical materials.

618
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:37,460
It's very possible that she created the bomb herself.

619
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:40,020
One took care of the transportation, and the other was responsible for creating the bomb.

620
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,660
From the looks of it, it's very likely that

621
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:46,490
the two of them had been planning this crime for a long time.

622
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:49,740
Yezi, notify the rest of the team of what we've found so far.

623
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,870
Got it.

624
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:54,060
Also, notify the Jiaodao police department.

625
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,000
Ask them to cooperate with our investigation and provide the information we ask for.

626
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,820
Also, ask them to start conducting personal interviews

627
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:01,290
ao that we can understand what Tao Yinghong and Wang Xinde's lives and jobs were like in Jiaodao.

628
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,080
I understand.

629
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,900
A homemade bomb.

630
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,590
1:45 p.m.

631
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:14,650
Why choose this time?

632
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,970
Come, please sit.

633
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:28,430
You can rest here.

634
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,920
There shouldn't be anything else for the time being.

635
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:38,080
Is there anything else that we can help with?

636
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,170
Just rest for a bit.

637
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,030
Thank you.

638
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:54,030
If you have any problems, you can come directly to me.

639
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:06,820
When I heard the ringtone earlier, I couldn't control myself.

640
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,910
It was a reflex reaction. I felt like an explosion was about to happen.

641
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:11,460
- It's okay.
- It's all my fault.

642
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,900
Now that we're sitting in here, we won't be able to find out any other information.

643
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,540
It's not your fault.

644
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:19,580
We can't only assist the police in solving this case.

645
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:23,890
We also need to find a way for ourselves to stop the explosion.

646
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:26,920
I-I don't want to slow us down.

647
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,630
We still have a chance.

648
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:34,300
♫  Extinguish the faint light  ♫

649
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:39,210
♫  City wall, outside is the city wall  ♫

650
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:43,790
♫  In the midst of confusion, there’s confusion  ♫

651
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:49,340
♫  We won't give up  ♫

652
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:54,550
♫  Wait for the light  ♫

653
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:07,320
''My Only'' - Zhou Shen

654
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:12,540
♫  You are the only  ♫

655
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:22,330
♫  The only one who heals me  ♫

656
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:27,660
♫  When I look into your eyes  ♫

657
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:35,790
♫  I heard my heart beat  ♫

658
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:43,180
♫  You are my only  ♫

659
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:52,900
♫  Always believed in me  ♫

660
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:58,150
♫  I will never be that weak-willed me  ♫

661
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:00,960
♫  I'll be strong with you by me  ♫

662
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:08,160
♫  How can I let you go away  ♫

663
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:14,590
♫  You are my only  ♫

664
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:22,030
♫  Always on my mind  ♫

665
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:28,580
♫  But it's so hard to find out why  ♫

666
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:31,900
♫  Dreaming of you every night  ♫

667
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:38,520
♫  I wonder why you never know  ♫

668
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:46,080
♫  You are my only  ♫

669
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:53,800
♫  Always be there waiting for me  ♫

670
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,580
♫  I will never leave  ♫

671
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:03,120
♫  I will be right there for you  ♫

672
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:12,190
♫  It seems like the real meaning  ♫

673
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:16,910
♫  To me  ♫
