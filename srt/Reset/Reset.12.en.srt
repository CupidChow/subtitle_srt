00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,080
First, they pretended to be reporters and visited the bus company.

3
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,280
Then they went to Wang Xingde's dormitory.

4
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,230
Xiao Heyun's last call from his cellphone

5
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,840
is to the locksmith.

6
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,170
What are they trying to do?

7
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,280
Are they trying to wipe out the evidence?

8
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,430
At the same time, Wang Xingde's roommate arrived,

9
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,430
the locksmith company didn't accept the order.

10
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,750
The people who were contacted by those two

11
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,530
are on their way here.

12
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,940
Is it possible that those two people are not witnesses?

13
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,200
Perhaps, they are pointing their fingers at Tao Yinghong and Wang Xingde,

14
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,630
and then came to us to mislead us

15
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,330
in order to cover their criminal act.

16
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,670
Don't come up with a conclusion so soon.

17
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,530

18
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,180

00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,230
and other electronic equipment to assist our investigation.

22
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,170
Of course, you can use your phone to inform your families first.

23
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,500
Let them know you are here to assist our investigation.

24
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,460
Do you have two cell phones?

25
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,980
This is yours too?

26
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,630
Are you sure you don't need to call home?

27
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,940
No need. I told them already.

28
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,190
Thank you for your cooperation.

29
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,320
We also hope to stay here to see

30
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,260
what else we could help with.

31
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,150
If we go back, we won't feel right.

32
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,390
Right.

33
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,680
Your girlfriend doesn't look good.

34
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,880
Captain Zhang, I'm here to collect the electronic items.

35
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,650
Captain Zhang.

36
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:04,960
Have you found any new clues?

37
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,430
There are a few.

38
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,150
Have you found out the source of the bomb?

39
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,290
We are in the process of verifying.

40
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,160
It's related to the lady who carried the plastic bag, right?

41
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,440
Tell me why would you ask me that?

42
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,590
Didn’t you say she was working at a chemical factory?

43
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,340
You overheard it?

44
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,250
I thought you weren't feeling well and weren't focused on the conversation.

45
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,810
- I...
- It was me who told her that.

46
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,480
We were analyzing the case earlier.

47
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,710
If this woman worked at a chemical factory,

48
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,020
then she must have been able to collect those chemical substances pretty easily.

49
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,370
If she has that kind of knowledge,

50
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,850
isn't it possible for her to make the bomb?

51
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,310
I have another question for you.

52
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,200
You mentioned smelling a chemical odor on the bus,

53
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,560
was it coming from the pressure cooker?

54
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,790
Can you describe the smell?

55
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,590
It's...

56
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,150
is hard to say. It was strong,

57
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,920
it smelled choking and also something unusual,

58
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,160
it was...was a bit stinky.

59
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,850
I really don't know what kind of chemical it was,

60
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,920
I don't know anything about chemical substances either.

61
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,390
- It was a bit like...
- You smelt it as well?

62
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,570
That's right.

63
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,660
I didn't pay attention but there was an odor.

64
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,540
It's summertime, so it's pretty normal to smell a bit on the bus.

[Phone records]

67
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,010
Captain Zhang, Tao Yinghong and Wang Xingde had never communicated with Li Shiqing and Xiao Heyun.

68
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,750
There is nothing unusual on their phone records, and they are not connected on their social media platforms.

69
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,060
There is nothing suspicious at this point.

70

We are digging deeper for other clues

71
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,850
If it was a distinctive odor, and both of you had smelt it.

72
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,940
I bet other passengers noticed it as well.

73
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,250
How did they react?

74
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,290
They didn't react, there were so many people on the bus.

75
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,390
Captain Zhang, I suddenly thought about this.

76
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:40,680
What did Tao Yinghong do in the chemical factory?

77
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,440
- She was a Quality Controller.
- Quality Controller.

78
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,650
Then it means she had the ability to make the bomb.

79
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,550
We are right about this. She has the ability and materials to do so.

80
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,780
Can't we prove that she was capable and had a channel to make the bomb?

We can't prove that at this point.

85

We can only say she had the capabilities to commit the crime,

86

00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,950
if those two were the ones who visited the bus company,

99
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,370

Correct. It's these two!

They claimed they are the students from Jialin Teacher's University Campus Broadcast Channel and they wanted to interview Wang Xingde.

102
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,270
They didn't tell me that.

00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,870
They said they are relatives of Wang Xingde.

104

After she saw the news, she got very emotional.

She said she indirectly killed the passengers on the bus.

that's why I took her to find more information in order to calm her down.

123
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,850
In the beginning, I didn't believe that there was a bomb on the bus.

124
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,810
But the more we've looked into it, the more I find this case peculiar.

125
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,160
It is beyond our ability.

126
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,450
We thought we should report it to the police.

127
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,290
I know we are very suspicious, but we are not bad people.

After the disaster,

00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:43,620
a lot of survivors feel remorseful.

133
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,790
They feel like they didn't do enough,

134
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,000
and this allowed the disaster to happen.

135
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,450
They even question themselves why

this situation becomes harder to bear.

139
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,790

Can you also disclose to us everything you know at this point?

144
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,400
I'm really worried about her.

145

If you don't want to tell me, you can tell her.

The home owner lives on the second floor, and the first floor is the garage.

153

Other than the raw materials used to create the bomb,

- we also found the remnants of a chemical explosion.
- What about fingerprints?

155
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,640
At the moment, we have only found Tao Yinghong's fingerprints at this location.

156
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,040
This makes sense. She created the bomb in a garage that she rented.

157
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,080
Other than the garage, did you check her house?

158
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,430
It's already been checked.

159
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,730
Our IT department checked her computer

160
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,860
and found receipts for buying chemical materials.

161
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,780
All the transactions were conducted online.

162
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,600

I'll have Xiao Liu update you with the results.

164
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,710
Let's ask all necessary departments to cooperate with our investigation.

165
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:47,250
And tell the IT department to follow up on the transactions and figure out who sold the materials to her.

166
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,850
Got it.

167
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,600
From the looks of it, it's becoming less likely that these two are the culprits.

168
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,960
That's right, what's the situation with the public transport company?

169
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,880
Wang Xingde's roommate said that after the two of them got there, one was searching his room.

170
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,610
The other one stayed outside and kept asking him questions.

171
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,690
She mainly asked about Tao Yinghong and Wang Xingde.

172
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,950
Especially the state of their marriage and if they're on good terms.

173
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,050
So it seems that Li and Xiao's actions,

174
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,040
line up with what they've told us.

175
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,510
They were trying to find out the culprit's motives.

176
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,720
Was there anything suspicious at Wang Xingde's dorm?

177
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,890
It was just messy from being searched.

178
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,540
If these two were suspects, then they should have gone there to destroy the evidence.

179
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,770
In that case, why leave the scene looking like it's clearly been searched?

180
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,950
Also, the roommate said that

181
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:43,260
if these two people didn't approach him, they wouldn't have interacted at all.

182
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,060
Why would they want one more witness who's talked to them?

183
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,260
When can the old cellphone with flowers on it be repaired?

184
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,780
It should be done soon. I'll go to the IT department to follow up.

185
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,040
Old Zhang.

186
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,590
I don't really understand these two witnesses.

187
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,810
We need to find out the truth quickly, whatever it takes.

188
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,860
As long as they're still at the station.

189
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,810
The situation is under our control.

190
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,210
I understand.

191
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,710
[Jialin Police Department, Yanjiang Branch]

192
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,490
- What-What's the meaning of this?
- Don't be afraid.

193
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,530
It's just a routine inspection.

194
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,640
Thank you.

195
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,770
We can be pretty sure now

196
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,790
that the bomb

197
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,740
was created by Tao Yinghong.

198
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,250
If that's the case,

199
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,410
then the two of them came to Jialin and spent four years here.

200
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,030
One took care of the transportation, and the other one created the bomb.

201
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,900
They did all this with the goal of today's explosion in mind?

202
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,480
Your logic makes sense.

203
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,570
I just want to know

204
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,400
if you guys remember any other details

205
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,890
that could help us.

206
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,280
That pressure cooker.

207
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,840
I remember she was very alert at the time.

208
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,210
She kept her hand on the pressure cooker.

209
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:57,100
So I wonder if

210
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,660
the pressure releaser was the bomb trigger.

211
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,440
But since she was capable of creating a bomb,

212
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,540
couldn't it be a timed bomb too?

213
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,180
Because she kept emphasizing "1:45, 1:45".

214
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:14,430
Could this time have some special meaning for them?

215
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,230
That's just my guess.

216
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,350
Ye Zi. Go check the old case files.

217
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,420
See if any previous accidents on the bridge

218
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,490
happened at or are related to 1:45 p.m.

219
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,170
Got it.

220
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:45,970
Oh, right. The flowery cellphone that you guys took earlier,

221
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:49,380
actually, I took that from Wang Xingde's dorm.

222
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,160
Why didn't you say that earlier?

223
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,570
I was kind of scared. After all, this is the police station.

224
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,720
And I stole it.

225
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,000
Because I thought that the cellphone

226
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,340
seemed very out of place in that environment. It didn't seem like it belonged to him.

227
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,580
So I wanted to take it and see if we could get any information out of it.

228
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,300
We already knew that the cellphone wasn't yours.

229
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,880
It's a good thing you said it yourself.

230
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,610
Do they have any kids?

231
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:27,260
I was wondering if that cellphone belongs to their kid.

232
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,350
Old Zhang. It's true, they have a daughter.

233
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,600
Wang Mengmeng. She died five years ago.

234
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,190
We found that they do have a daughter.

235
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,930
Her name is Wang Mengmeng.

236
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:52,280
But she died five years ago.

237
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,880
- Miss. Are you studying at Jialin College?
- Yes.

238
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,410
My daughter goes there as well.

239
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,000
Your daughter is studying there?

240
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,740
Which year is she in? Which major?

241
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,930
She is working already.

242
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,360
If we follow this line of logic,

243
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,980
the death of their daughter Wang Mengmeng

244
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,200
may be the key to solving this case.

245
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,670
Old Zhang. Come to the conference room.

246
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,880
All right. If you guys

247
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,150
can remember any other details,

248
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,850
- tell me right away.
- Okay.

249
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,240
You guys must be hungry.

250
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,110
I'll have someone bring you some food in a bit.

251
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,730
Thank you.

252
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,890
He said that their daughter passed away five years ago.

253
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,920
But I remember that Wang Xingde

254
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,070
told me about a year ago

255
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:59,900
that his daughter went to the same school as me, and that she graduated and started working already.

256
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,030
Why would he lie about that?

257
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,660
Oh, right. When we went to his dorm,

258
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,120
his roommate told me that their marriage was quite unhappy.

259
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,600
So do you think that they were working together

260
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,300
or that Wang Xingde was forced into doing this?

261
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,470
- Captain Zhang.
- Master.

262
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,060
- What is it?
- We haven't recovered the contents of the cellphone.

263
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,170
The IT department said it'll take some more time until they can retrieve the information on the phone.

264
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,050
But we've checked the SIM card.

265
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:51,860
It belongs to Wang Xingde and Tao Yinghong's daughter, Wang Mengmeng.

266
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,820
- Have you checked the call records?
- Yes.

267
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,870
Wang Mengmeng's last outgoing call was five years ago, on May 13th.

268
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:01,330
At 1:44 p.m. She was calling Wang Xingde,

269
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,310
but he didn't pick up.

270
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,060
At 1:44 p.m.?

271
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,870
Old Zhang. Come sit.

272
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,150
Ye Zi.

273
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,000
Play it.

274
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,050
Stop.

275
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,240
The time is 1:45 p.m.

276
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,860
This is Wang Xingde

277
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,360
and Tao Yinghong's daughter, Wang Mengmeng, right?

278
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,810
Five years ago on May 13th,

279
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,750
on the bridge in Jialin, she was in a car accident.

280
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,140
She died at the site of the accident.

281
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,900
The accident happened

282
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,880
right at 1:45 p.m.

283
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,090
It's very clear that

284
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:58,770
the time and place of today's explosion are the same as

285
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,790
Wang Mengmeng's car accident from 5 years ago.

286
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:07,060
Also, when the accident happened, Wang Mengmeng was riding Bus 45.

287
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,290
There's one more thing.

288
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:12,970
The car accident happened on May 13th, five years ago.

289
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,590
Today's only May 9th.

290
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,910
Why is it an earlier date?

291
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,620
I interviewed the other residents of Gangwu New Village, where they live.

292
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,970
Someone in their neighborhood told me that starting from this afternoon,

293
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,450
all garages in their neighborhood have to undergo fire safety inspections.

294
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,850
So it's very likely that they were concerned about hiding the evidence,

295
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,350
and that's why they were forced to move the explosion plan to an earlier date.

296
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,360
Interestingly enough, the reason they are conducting fire safety inspections

297
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,210
is because on April 4th,

298
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,280
there was a small fire in Tao Yinghong's garage.

299
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,590
And today's fire safety inspection was announced last minute.

300
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,690
This case,

301
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,020
was cracked too easily.

302
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,570
This entire investigation,

303
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:01,260
from the time of the incident until now, has taken less than eight hours.

304
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,880
At every step, we made

305
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,750
the right choice.

306
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,880
We also, very quickly and successfully, found the answers to all our questions.

307
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,230
That's why it might feel like the case was cracked too easily.

308
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:16,310
If it wasn't for these two young people who came to us,

309
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:19,080
compared to our previous investigations,

310
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,520
it's possible we would have wasted some time exploring other ideas.

311
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,420
Master.

312
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,740
What do you think their motives are?

313
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,510
- Master.
- What'd you say?

314
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:35,060
I said, what do you think their motives are?

315
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,650
According to them, they just want to find out

316
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,130
Wang Xingde's motive for doing this.

317
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,140
No matter what,

318
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,570
based on all the information we've gathered,

319
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:52,100
we have a very clear direction for solving this case.

320
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,150
You two, when you're checking the old case files,

321
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,990
contact the police officer in charge of Wang Mengmeng's case too.

322
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:00,120
Gather all the surveillance footage of the bus, inside and outside.

323
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,150
- Got it.
- Understood.

324
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,760
Let's go.

325
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,210
These two young people...

326
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,930
I'll take care of it.

327
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,600
Okay.

328
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,930
I've discovered a problem.

329
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,700
We did all of this today

330
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,310
because we wanted to find the bus driver's motive.

331
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:33,380
So that we could use it to persuade him to open the door of the bus.

332
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,140
But if his motive

333
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,720
is really related to the death of his daughter,

334
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,780
how could we possibly persuade him?

335
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,490
His daughter's death already happened. We can't change it.

336
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,650
So we still need to stop the explosion.

337
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:54,100
Actually, the best way for us to do that

338
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,200
would be to know how the police would react to a situation like this.

339
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,430
But the question is,

340
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:02,450
will they tell us?

341
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,720
Excuse me.

342
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,630
It's this late and I've only just got you some food.

343
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,700
I didn't know if you could eat spicy food.

344
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,250
How is it? Do the noodles suit your taste?

345
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,550
It's tasty.

346
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:22,580
Did you think of any details?

347
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,790
I just wanted to ask if you'd confirmed if that phone belongs to Wang Mengmeng?

348
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:30,280
Also, can you tell me how Wang Mengmeng died?

349
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,830
We just wanted to know

350
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,620
if their motives are related to the death of their daughter.

351
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,760
It's like this.

352
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,230
It's already happened.

353
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,250
Even if you know their motive,

354
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,520
what can you do about it now?

355
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,610
Then if...

356
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:56,280
What if it hadn't happened?

357
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,040
I'm saying if,

358
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,680
if I open my eyes and I find that I'm on the bus again,

359
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,760
and at this time, the bomb is already on the bus,

360
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,910
and there are less than twenty minutes until 1:45 pm, when the bomb will explode,

361
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:11,920
in such a short time, if I know that the bomb is on the bus, and I also know who the culprit is,

362
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,920
in that situation, what could we do to prevent the explosion?

363
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,710
All right, don't ask that.

364
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,080
These things have nothing to do with you.

365
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,320
From the time between when that lady got on the bus until when we got off, it was at most five minutes.

366
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,390
We're not special agents. What could we possibly do?

367
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:27,580
So should we just not do anything, and just wait for the explosion to happen?

368
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,660
What has happened has already happened. We can't change it.

369
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,640
Just stop thinking about it.

370
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,150
I would have never thought you were this type of person.

371
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,700
It's like this.

372
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,450
Usually, in this type of scenario, the police wouldn't choose to stop the bus.

373
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:06,350
Because that might alert the culprit

374
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:09,290
and they might trigger the bomb early.

375
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:11,730
What the police would do is

376
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:15,100
at the next bus stop, a police officer

377
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,990
would get on the bus pretending to be a regular passenger.

378
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:21,070
They would place themselves in position according to where the culprit is.

379
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,160
And then they would find a suitable time to take control of the situation,

380
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,670
hold down the culprit, and defuse the bomb.

381
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,520
In that case,

382
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,310
there's only Yanjiang East Road station.

383
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,440
There aren't any stops after that.

384
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,910
In that five minutes, would the police be able to get there in time?

385
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:37,770
Five minutes.

386
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,890
It's too tight.

387
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,740
So the safest way to stop the explosion

388
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,360
is for the police to board the bus at Yanjiang East Road.

389
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,690
If you can delay the bus in getting to the next station,

390
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:56,810
this might be able to give the police some more time to get in position.

391
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,470
Delaying the bus.

392
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:01,060
Captain Zhang. We're having a meeting in the conference room.

393
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,800
Okay, I'll be right there.

394
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,160
Captain Zhang,

395
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:28,000
I still want to know how Wang Mengmeng died.

396
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:39,320
She... died in a car accident.

397
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,630
Five years ago, on Bus 45,

398
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,580
on May 13th at 1:45 p.m.,

399
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:50,300
On the bridge, Wang Mengmeng suddenly got off the bus and got into a car accident.

400
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:54,200
Why would she get off the bus on the bridge?

401
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:59,020
If one day, you received a text from a stranger,

402
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:03,530
saying that there's a bus that's going to explode in twenty minutes,

403
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:07,960
and that they needed your help, would you believe them and immediately go into action?

404
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,150
I would go into action, without hesitating at all.

405
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:13,930
Wouldn't you think that it's a prank or a false report?

406
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:16,120
If that happened, we would definitely find the contact person

407
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,680
and have them receive their due punishment by the law.

408
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,780
But if it was a real threat,

409
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:25,750
by going into action, we could potentially save the lives of everyone on board. Isn't that right?

410
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,020
I believe that I'm not the only one.

411
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,660
All of my fellow police officers would do the same.

412
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,750
This is what it means to be a police officer.

413
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,840
I know.

414
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,810
Captain Zhang.

415
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,910
Could I ask for your phone number?

416
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:14,550
The vehicle is in motion, please be seated.

417
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:18,160
The next stop is Yanjiang East Road.

418
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,830
What's wrong?

419
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,260
You're bleeding.

420
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:46,300
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

421
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,910
Actually, ever since our starting time stopped moving up,

422
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,730
I've been able to tell that

423
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,180
my physical condition has been getting worse and worse.

424
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,800
Perhaps this time loop isn't infinite for me.

425
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,790
It's okay. We've made so many preparations for it this time.

426
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,610
We will definitely succeed.

427

We haven't gotten off the bus yet. Driver.

479
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:56,470
Sir, don't close the door.

480
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:59,370
- No! I want to get off the bus.
- You should let them get off the bus.

481
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:02,450
Can you stop messing around? We have things to do at home.

482
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:05,400
I also have things to do, but those two cannot get off the bus.

483
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,610
Let's move forward, there is a police station two stops ahead.

484
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:09,110
You guys can deal with the situation over there.

485
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:12,350
There are surveillance cameras around, I'm not afraid of you.

486
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:18,080
Fine! I have my reason, I'm not afraid of you.

487
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,280
You definitely stole my USB.

488
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,850
Those youngsters, I don't understand them.

489
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,740
[Yanjing East Road Stop]

490
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,870
Master,

491
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,680
we have evacuated the crowd.

492
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,120
Our people surrounded the area.

493
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,500
Got it. Once the bus approaches the bus stop, take action at both front and rear doors.

494
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,070
You have to be quick and be careful.

495
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,810
Got it.

496
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,080
Follow the bus!

497
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,710
Driver, why aren't we stopping at the bus stop?

498
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,550
The bus took off.

499
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:47,910
What's going on? Sir, why didn't you stop the bus?

500
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:51,170
There were people at the bus stop, why didn't you stop?

501
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:53,810
- Captain Zhang, the bridge is blocked.
- Get in the car.

502
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:56,790
Got it. We will follow from behind.

503
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,320
Is the bomb still on the bus?

504
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,710
Listen to me, you have to be careful.

505
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,450
If the condition allows, keep in touch with me.

506
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:21,980
Okay, sure. I'm hanging up.

507
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:52,740
There are police cars following us. What's the situation?

508
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,540
That's right.

509
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,560
Stop the car, Sir.

510
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,940
The bus in the front, please pull over.

511
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,880
Pull over!

512
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,190
Don't move.

513
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:32,000
What's going on?

514
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,420
The bus needs to get on the bridge.

515
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,220
Sit down!

516
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,130
No one move!

517
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,220
The woman wants to blow up the bus.

518
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,830
The bomb is inside this plastic bag. Stay away, everyone!

519
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,030
Blow up the vehicle?

520
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,490
Old Jiao, help me!

521
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,830
Help!

522
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:59,100
Let go!

523
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:15,560
Let me go.

524
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,420
Let me go!

525
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:23,080
Let me go!

526
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,610
Pay attention, the bus is accelerating toward the bridge.

527
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:40,490
Got it. The bridge is all set.

528
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,950
- Let me go!
- Driver, stop the bus!

529
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:46,020
What are you thinking? Stop the bus!

530
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,250
The driver and the lady are accomplices.

531
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,050
Driver, stop the bus. The police is aware of your plan already.

532
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,570
- We're almost at the bridge.
- There's still time to stop the bus.

533
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:11,150
You still have a chance. If you turn yourself in, they might be lenient on you.

534
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,650
Mengmeng is waiting for us.

535
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,720
Mengmeng is waiting for us. She is waiting for us on the bridge.

536
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,090
Yes. What happened to Mengmeng is very unfortunate,

537
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:38,050
but it is not the reason for you two to kill all the passengers.

538
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:40,590
They are all innocent!

539
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:43,200
How do you know Mengmeng?

540
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,550
I know Wang Mengmeng had an accident on the bridge five years ago.

541
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:51,000
- I know! Stop the bus!
- Stop talking nonsense!

542
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,990
The incident happened five years ago,

543
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:55,760
if you can't let go, you should ask the police to reopen the case.

544
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,090
You don't need to do this. That driver was already held accountable.

545
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:02,620
- But it was Mengmeng who wanted to get off the bus on her own.
- Nonsense!

546
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,740
If it was going to be investigated, you would have done it a long time ago.

547
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:08,830
They have already forgotten everything. What use is it telling me all these now?

548
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:11,510
Yinghong, you're right.

549
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,260
Your persistence is correct.

550
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:17,410
Just hold on a bit longer, Mengmeng is waiting for us ahead.

551
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,620
Driver Wang Xingde, pull over immediately.

552
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:56,250
Driver Wang Xingde, this is the ultimatum,

553
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,810
pull over immediately!

554
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:00,320
Stop the bus, Sir!

555
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,200
Wang Xingde, stop the bus immediately!

556
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,270
I hope you come to your senses,

557
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:34,430
tell us what you want, we will try to fulfill your request.

558
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,800
Stop the bus immediately.

559
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:44,380
Open the door, Driver! Open the door!

560
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,440
Let go of my hand.

561
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:52,750
Wang Xingde, open the door.

562
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,920
Turn off the engine.

563
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,900
Open the door.

564
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:54,890
