Today, Qiang Zi is going back to his hometown. It is a happy occasion.

00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,360
Why the sad face?

Let's drink! Cheers!

I'm ready to go back to my hometown as well.

7
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,460
Once the construction stops, I won't able to afford the rent here.

8
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,660
I really regret I did not study harder.

9
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,240
I interviewed for a security guard position, but they didn't even want me.

Old Jiao, are you going back to your hometown too?

11
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,560
My daughter is going to apply for high school soon.

12
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,160
I need to earn enough money for her tuition and living expenses.

13
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,780
Besides, she doesn't know the situation at the construction site.

14
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,670
If I go back, she will become distracted.

15
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,990
What if she doesn't do well on the exam because of this?

16
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,370
Are you still living in that garage?

17

I bet it's going to be hot soon.

There are no windows or water, how can you live there?

19
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,470
I'm only there to sleep.

20
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,580
I'm planning to deliver take-out

It's just running around and finding the addresses, you will be fine if you can endure it.

33
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,270
In order to do this, you'll need an electromobile.

34
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,560
An electromobile?

35
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,410
Get a second-hand one. It cost a maximum of ¥700 to ¥800,

36
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,610
a second-hand one will be fine.

- What do you mean I'm ripping you off?
- How do you charge us?

You are so hard to find. I've been looking for you for three days.

I couldn't find you.

Brother,

55
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,930
I’ve been busy at the construction site.

56
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,950
Fine! Fine! Pack up and move out quickly.

57
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,570
Otherwise, you won't make it.

58
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,430
If it's regarding the rent, it will be ready in two days.

59
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,130
It's not because of the rent. The Neighborhood Committee has notified us that

60
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,570
we can no longer rent out garages.

61
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,930
Why can't they rent it out?

62
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,630
People are here today to inspect all the garage rental situations.

63
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,960
If they find that people live in the garage, they will fine the owners.

64
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,090
How can I let you stay here?

65
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,690
For you, pay off your outstanding rent.

You have to move out right now. The inspector will be here soon.

We are running out of time.

they both look like it was none of their business.

They shouldn't be.

89

It's very difficult to check that suitcase.

93

The plastic bag should be much easier to check.

94

I would like to ask if you brought some pads with you?

99

My thing came today.

100
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,700
I didn't bring any pads. I was wondering if I could borrow some from you.

101
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,330
I have none.

102
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,520
You don't?

103
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,070
But I saw that you have some inside this bag.

104
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,860
That's why I'm asking you for it.

I'm sorry.

109
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,110
Auntie, how come you brought a pot with you?

110
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,390
What's inside your pot?

111
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,990
It looked really heavy when I saw you carrying it while entering the bus,

112
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,300
so I got quite curious about what was inside.

113
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,960
Meat.

114
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,530
Meat?

You were too direct.

00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,550
Don't you think it's weird?

119
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,980
Who puts something in a pot when bringing food outside?

120

Don't people use a flask?

My family puts meat in pots too.

122

When I was in university, my mother often carried a pot of meat for us to eat.

Th-That's very normal.

124

The smell of meat?

128
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,970
It seems I did smell it a bit.

129
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,330
But I can't say what kind of smell it was.

130
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,010
Maybe it is

131
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:57,190
the spice of stewed meat?

132
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,030
When you took her things just now, she also didn't react.

133

Perhaps, it really isn't her.

134
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,870
If it really isn't her,

135
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,960

Have they inspected your neighborhood yet?

Were you really fined?

168
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,490
You were fined!

169
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,190
How much was the fine?

Tell me how much is the rent in a month?

Once we got caught, we will be fined.

Dad, I really don't want to go to school anymore.

196

Going to school is a waste of money.

Pay off the debt! I told you before not to mention it anymore.

How big of a ghost was it to push you into paralysis like this, in the middle of the day?

240

Don't talk nonsense.

241

Young girl, you must take him to a hospital to have him checked out.

242

If you need any, let me know.

249
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:38,890
You really scared me to death earlier. I thought you wouldn't be able to wake up.

250
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,610
I could hear what you guys were saying,

251

but I just couldn't wake up.

252

254
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:55,250

255

It's just that it hit me in the face. It really hurt a lot.

How long have you been up?

257

It was the same as last time when I woke up.

258
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:15,500
The time didn't go back earlier, and they've already boarded the bus.

259
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,090
That means,

260
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:28,470
as soon as the bomb gets on the bus, the time doesn't get earlier.

If the time doesn't go earlier,

263
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,580
then does that mean that the loop

264
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,700
has ended?

then...

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,640
Then this will be our last opportunity to get off the bus.

268
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:04,240
It is also the last opportunity these people on the bus can live.

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,660
Should we...

271
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,580
should we really get off the bus?

272
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,750
Didn't we already decide?

273
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,390
To be honest, I also want to live.

274
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,670
I am also a human. I am also afraid of death.

275
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,640
Actually,

276
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,220
each one of the times before, I really wanted to get off the bus.

277
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,920
I also have secretly thought,

278
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,230
I should take the chance in this loop

279
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,660
to do something over the top and set myself free.

280
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,630
For example, I don't have to worry about how much I've spent,

281
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,500
or worry about gaining weight if I indulged myself in food and drinks

282
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,900
Or...

283
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,290
something like not going back to my dorm at night

284
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:28,260
and then going to an internet café to pull an all-nighter.

285
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:35,850
But, I can only think of these as the things that make me happy.

286
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:40,020
I am just a normal person.

287
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,370
My imagination is limited.

288
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,680
But I think,

289
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,400
if I could save all the bus passengers here,

290
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:56,530
that would be the most over-the-top thing to set myself free.

291
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:00,820
But now, they have become

292
