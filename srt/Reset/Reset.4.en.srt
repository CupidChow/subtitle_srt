But you can't save people using only your heart.

We have to use logic too.

149

And why should we save them?

150
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,820
In a lot of the loops, we were one of the bodies.

If the people in the bus are meant to die,

165
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,930
I just wanted to express that whatever happens, we can discuss it.

166
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,300
You avoided it so well.

167
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,970
Didn't you already think about not getting involved?

168
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,850
I didn't think that much.

169
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:59,500
I just think it's too much for both of us to go to the police.

170
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,110
I was thinking this way.

171
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,460
Since we can get off at the station normally now,

172
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,500
then let's go through the day completely and gather evidence.

173
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,640
The loop is always starting earlier.

174
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,310
Let's wait until the loop is early enough so when we call the police,

175
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,380
they are able to get there in time to prevent the explosion.

176
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,780
If we do that, then we can cooperate with the police,

177
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,700
and we can also avoid dying each time.

178
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,140
Also, we won't be detained.

179
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:25,490
If the loop is really getting earlier each time,

180
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,210
I will get on the bus at the same stop.

181
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,050
But what about you?

182
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,590
Will you still get on the bus?

183
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,880
Relax, you won't need to go to the police station.

184
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,570
I believe in the police.

185
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,070
They will be able to prevent the explosion.

186
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,290
Captain Zhang.

187
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:17,200
Based on the previous plan, we have already blocked the traffic on both ends of the bridge.

188
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,590
- Where is Xiao Jiang?
- He took a couple of traffic officers

189
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,820
and arrived at the road block.

190
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,790
What's going on?

191
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,240
Sir, open the doors.

192
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,610
All passengers, an accident has occurred ahead. The bus isn't able to go through.

193
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:12,260
We can get off the bus and leave on foot.

194
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,660
What's going on?

195
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:18,390
The bridge has a traffic jam? Then how long would it take? I still have things to do.

196
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,470
It will take at least half an hour.

197
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,200
That's too long, I have things to deal with at home.

198
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,820
Sir, open the doors. We'll get off here.

199
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,290
Everyone get off, but leave your belongings behind.

200
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:31,990
Don't move!

201
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,880
Xiao Jiang, Xiao Jiang.

202
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,800
If you receive this message, please respond.

203
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,550
Jiang Feng, Jiang Feng! If you receive this, please respond!

204
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,870
You can go.

205
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,260
I will go to the police and explain clearly.

206
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,420
I won't mention you.

207
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,750
What are you going to tell the police?

208
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:24,700
I've already experienced the interrogation twice, I know what I should say.

209
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,790
I'll just not mention you.

210
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,890
You hid pretty well earlier too.

211
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,150
You probably won't be suspected later on.

212
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:41,960
What you said is true, there isn't a need to implicate two persons.

213
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,650
And what's more, this all started with me.

214
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,780
No matter what happens, I should face the consequences myself.

215
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,470
Yes, I'm Li Shiqing.

216
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,370
I am at the West Lake Park.

217
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,070
Okay, I'll wait for you at the entrance.

218
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,010
Before you make a decision, can't you discuss it with me first?

219
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,930
I already called the police. What else can I do?

220
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,640
The police will be arriving soon.

221
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,810
Later, don't rush in leaving. Hide for a bit in the park.

222
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,670
If this is really the last time in the loop,

223
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,990
then I will face the consequences of my actions.

224
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,430
It doesn't matter whether this is the last loop or not.

225
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,190
If it's not the last loop, that's even better.

226
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:31,420
Then each time you'll be able to successfully get off at your stop

227
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,030
and go live your own normal life.

228
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,960
What normal life would be left?

229
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,510
Every time I open my eyes, I'll see you looking like you're about to die.

230
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,020
And then you're telling me to go attend a meeting regardless?

231
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,670
At least you won't die from the explosion.

232
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,140
That is better than those passengers who die on the bus.

233
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,010
Those passengers don't know a single thing.

234
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:54,780
Death is just a moment in time for them. They won't even experience pain.

235
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,760
But what about us? We have to fight against fear.

236
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,320
Is there anything wrong with being afraid of death?

237
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,240
Isn't it human nature to be drawn towards safety and to stay away from danger?

238
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,970
I can't be as kindhearted as you, so I–

239
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,390
So does that make me wicked?

Who is this man who got off the bus with her?

274

We're still searching the surveillance recordings to find out the people she interacted with.

277
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,790

Hello, Xiao Heyun?

282
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,380
Xiao Heyun, I know what you're thinking.

283
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,310
You've been hesitating for a month now. Isn't it just deleting the violence setting?

284
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:53,690
No, I'm just baffled. What kind of bad influence could there be if a game is a little bit violent?

285
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:57,580
I've already told you a bunch of times! If the game has violence, it won't be able to sell!

286
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,140
If we can't sell the game, no one will invest. And then we really won't be able to do anything with our game anymore!

287
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,330
Do you understand?

288
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:08,010
Hide. If you're that great, just continue hiding!

289
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,410
If this is the last loop,

290
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:29,110
then isn’t it the last chance for the people on the bus to survive?

291
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,580
When I was in the hospital,

292
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,770

It was so tragic.

If the loop is really getting earlier each time,

322
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,880
That's why I asked if you knew her.

323
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,080
Another strange thing is our team just formed,

324
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,820
how did she know you and Xiao Jiang?

325
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:03,090
Captain Zhang.

326
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:18,340
Li Shiqing.

327
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,030
I've seen the records.

328
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,210
You mentioned a time loop.

329
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,840
I understand the basics.

330
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,380
I saw that you said twice

331
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,600
why didn't you see Old Zhang and Officer Xiao Jiang.

332
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,310
Correct?

333
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,450
How did you know they would be investigating this case?

334
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:44,260
Because you guys were there every time,

335
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,390
but I didn't see you guys this time.

336
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:49,410
I thought something happened to you two.

337
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,610
We are...

338
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:59,120
We lost one of our officers.

339
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:05,630
Is it Officer Xiao Jiang?

340
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,610
Sorry.

341
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,820
Sorry.

342
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,690
Why did you say that?

343
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:36,220
It's me who called the police and sacrificed Officer Jiang.

344
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,060
It's not your fault for calling the police.

345
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:43,100
It's because of your call that we were able to get there

346
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,950
and stop the bus at the bridge.

347
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,530
Li Shiqing,

348
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:53,930
calling the police when something is happening is every citizens' responsibility.

349
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:56,830
After something happened, cooperate with the police

350
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:58,710
and tell us what happened

351
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:02,480
is also the responsibility of the caller, understand?

352
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:05,980
I already said it.

353
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,460
But no matter what I say, if it's the truth or not,

354
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,150
you guys won't believe me. There's nothing else I can do.

355
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:14,390
I don't know what to do.

356
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,180
Li Shiqing.

357
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,030
I have a few more questions for you.

358
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:26,980
After you called the police,

359
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,820
you turned off your phone.

360
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,140
Why?

361
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,040
I wanted you guys to be dispatched immediately

362
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,710
and not to waste more time asking me questions on the phone

363
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:38,690
because it was urgent.

364
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,280
After you turned off the phone,

365
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,160
when you left the bus stop, you were mumbling something.

366
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,400
Were you talking to yourself or

367
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,570
talking to someone else?

368
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,140
You can't remember?

369
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,820
Do you know this guy?

370
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,210
[Unknown number]

371
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:47,010
Track this phone number and identify the user.

372
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:52,870
Answer and put it on speaker.

373
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,880
- Hello?
- Hello?

374
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,660
Li Shiqing.

375
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:02,960
Who is this?

376
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,880
Xiao Heyun.

377
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,740
Are you still there?

378
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,360
We broke up, stop calling me.

379
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:41,380
Let's sleep.

380
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:45,220
Once we sleep, everything will be better.

381
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:11,400
