1
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,159
Hello?

2
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:45,880
Do you need a loan?

3
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,000
No, I don't.

4
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:52,600
I have plenty of money.

5
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,479
Weird.

6
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,439
What was I expecting?

7
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,719
Hello?

8
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,959
Xin Tong.

9
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,680
Listen to me.

10
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,159
Although...

11
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,519
we are a Contractual Couple,

12
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,120
but my feelings for you are real.

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,120
Xin Tong.

14
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,480
I like you.

15
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:32,879
I like you.

16
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:49,599
Just as I expected.

17
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,480
Our son...

18
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,159
has completely fallen for her.

19
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:56,480
Then hurry up and do something for him.

20
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,079
Quick.

21
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,400
Give him a little push.

22
00:01:59,159 --> 00:01:59,920
I really should...

23
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,719
help him...

24
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,719
do something, right?

25
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,319
Right.

26
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:12,680
Dad?

27
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,879
What's going on?

28
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,080
Create an auspicious event for me.

29
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,599
I am taking back...

30
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,439
all the property I gave you.

31
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,840
What property are you taking back?

32
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,599
This watch...

33
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,599
this furniture...

34
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,280
and the whole house.

35
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,599
Didn't I earn all of this?

36
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,280
Is that so?

37
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,159
That's what he said.

38
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,159
It seems so.

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,280
But have you forgotten?

40
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,520
If not for me, the father of a rich heir...

41
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,319
raising you...

42
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,520
paying for your school...

43
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,479
teaching you perspective...

44
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,719
would you have all this?

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,080
Would you be where you are today?

46
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,439
How does the saying go?

47
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,520
Your body, hair, and skin...

48
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:07,840
are received from...

49
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,680
No, wait.

50
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,719
Also real estate and cars...

51
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,199
are all received from your parents.

52
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,439
Is the inventory done?

53
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,439
Done.

54
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,800
The appointment of the new president...

55
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,479
is invalid now.

56
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,719
To manage Four Seas...

57
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,599
requires great talent and strategy.

58
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,360
It requires exceptional courage.

59
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,759
But look at you.

60
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,719
You dare not even face your own feelings.

61
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,919
How can I trust it to you?

62
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,719
What's wrong with my dad?

63
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,319
The Chairman said...

64
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:56,960
you have been demoted.

65
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:08,960
Hello?

66
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,280
What?

67
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,759
The Chairman wants to see me.

68
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,319
Uncle.

69
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,399
Did you want to see me for something?

70
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,800
Xin Tong.

71
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,879
I know.

72
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,360
You and our Pei An...

73
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,319
during this time...

74
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,720
it was all fake.

75
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:26,920
I called you here...

76
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,040
to ask you something.

77
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,279
Is there a possibility...

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,040
that between you two...

79
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,560
the fake acting became real?

80
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:34,920
That fiction became fact?

81
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,759
Even...

82
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,120
getting on the wrong sedan chair...

83
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,240
but marrying the right man?

84
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,759
Uncle, please don't guess blindly.

85
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,519
Between the two of us...

86
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,279
it's unlikely for love to grow over time.

87
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,600
I wouldn't guess wrong.

88
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,040
If there was no...

89
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,959
love growing over time...

90
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,519
why did you leave?

91
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,759
Why are you running away?

92
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,120
Xin Tong.

93
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,439
The situation between you and Pei An...

94
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:02,600
I am very clear about it.

95
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,480
Uncle has been through this before.

96
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,240
I can tell...

97
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,480
that our Pei An...

98
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,160
likes you very much.

99
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,839
And he cares about you very much.

100
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,199
I can also tell...

101
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,920
that actually...

102
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,279
you like him too.

103
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,600
You care about him too.

104
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,639
Child.

105
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,199
Your aunt and I both think...

106
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,720
you are a good girl.

107
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:30,800
Smart...

108
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,759
capable...

109
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:32,560
beautiful...

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and understanding.

111
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,240
I think you should...

112
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,079
bravely face your work...

113
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,439
and your life.

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,439
You should especially face your feelings...

115
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,480
and your own heart.

116
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,639
Pei An, that kid...

117
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,680
I know him.

118
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,079
Towards you...

119
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,480
he is very serious.

120
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:52,240
Of course...

121
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,560
you young people have your own ideas.

122
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,279
So...

123
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,319
I hope you...

124
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,439
will consider it again.

125
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,079
Don't rush to make a decision.

126
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,680
But right now I...

127
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:05,480
have already submitted my resignation.

128
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,079
Tomorrow...

129
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:10,800
come back to work at Four Seas.

130
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,000
With a new identity.

131
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,480
Good morning...

132
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,240
you two.

133
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,560
Didn't you resign?

134
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,079
The Chairman hired me back with a high salary.

135
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,120
I am now Four Seas Group's...

136
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,879
Acting President.

137
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,399
Which means...

138
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,079
I am your...

139
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,639
direct supervisor.

140
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,199
Then my position is...

141
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,720
Secretary.

142
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,639
Then I am...

143
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,920
the secretary's secretary.

144
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,360
As long as the salary doesn't change.

145
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,480
Actually, that you came back...

146
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:56,639
makes me very happy.

147
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,639
What can I do for you, Chairman Xin?

148
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:04,639
Just say it.

149
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,519
Right now, I

150
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,560
need a cup of coffee.

151
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,040
Two cups of coffee.

152
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:19,680
Okay.

153
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,319
You can go back to work now.

154
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,199
Being a secretary

155
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,519
and acting as president

156
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,680
is quite tiring.

157
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,519
Xin Tong?

158
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,319
Is that you, Xin Tong?

159
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:10,720
I am.

160
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,040
And you are?

161
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,600
You've grown so much.

162
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,519
I...

163
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,959
I am your father.

164
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,639
Xin Tong.

165
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,800
I've finally found you.

166
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,439
Xin Youlai.

167
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,600
How did you find me?

168
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,279
I tracked down the director of your old orphanage.

169
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,519
So it was that simple to find me.

170
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,480
It wasn't simple.

171
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,159
To find your director,

172
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,360
I called 110

173
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,399
six or seven times before I found her.

174
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,559
Only six or seven calls.

175
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:58,840
Eat, eat, eat.

176
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,120
Come in.

177
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
There are slippers by the door.

178
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,559
What a big house.

179
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,000
Did you buy it yourself?

180
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:21,399
It's rented.

181
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,679
Rented.

182
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,000
That's fine too.

183
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,559
At our home,

184
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,679
we built a two-story house.

185
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,200
I

186
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,159
saved a room just for you as a bedroom.

187
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:39,639
Why did you

188
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,080
abandon me back then?

189
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,039
I didn't want to leave you either.

190
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,120
I really couldn't afford to raise you then.

191
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,200
I regret it too.

192
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,360
Xin Tong.

193
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:54,440
I'm sorry.

194
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,840
It's all because your dad was useless.

195
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,720
I was afraid you'd suffer with me.

196
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:00,879
What about my mom?

197
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:01,759
Your mom...

198
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,759
Your mom ran away right after giving birth to you.

199
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,840
I was just a man.

200
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,480
How could I know how to take care of a baby?

201
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,080
Women aren't born

202
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,039
knowing how to raise children either.

203
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,679
Yes.

204
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,120
I know you hate me.

205
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,120
That's why

206
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,519
I want to use the rest of my life

207
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:23,399
to make up for

208
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,759
the hurt I caused you.

209
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,840
Wait for me a moment.

210
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,639
I'll tidy up another room for you to stay in.

211
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,639
Xin Tong.

212
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,879
Give your dad a chance.

213
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:34,519
Okay?

214
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,600
Let's eat.

215
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:43,799
Oulu.

216
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:44,960
You go out first.

217
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,919
I have something to say to you.

218
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:48,639
Oulu, you sit down first.

219
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,320
I have nothing to say to you.

220
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,919
It's work hours now.

221
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,840
No need to get into character so quickly.

222
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,679
You have a lot of work to do.

223
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,519
Data report analysis.

224
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,080
Live stream data analysis.

225
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,159
Organize inventory.

226
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:06,960
And product selection for next week.

227
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,120
Why do I have to do so much work?

228
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,399
Is there a problem?

229
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,000
Remember to write me

230
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,480
a daily work summary report.

231
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:15,519
Send it to my email.

232
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,200
My communication with you

233
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,000
is now

234
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,279
limited to email only.

235
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,480
Fine.

236
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,600
Can we put work aside for now

237
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,559
and talk about something else?

238
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,679
I'm full.

239
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:27,919
You two

240
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,159
take your time eating.

241
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,799
Perhaps

242
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,480
today's dishes didn't suit her taste.

243
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,080
Getting off work so late?

244
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,679
Working overtime.

245
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,279
The company's been a bit busy lately.

246
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:48,519
How much do they pay you

247
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,279
to work this hard?

248
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,720
Enough to support myself.

249
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,279
You must make ten or twenty thousand, right?

250
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,639
I brought you some food.

251
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,639
Let me heat it up for you.

252
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,360
No rush, no rush.

253
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,720
I heard you loved bananas as a child.

254
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,799
Your dad bought these just for you.

255
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,399
Have one.

256
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:08,879
Thank you.

257
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,000
No need to thank me.

258
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,120
We're family.

259
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:11,759
Come on,

260
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,039
call me Dad.

261
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,279
I'll go heat up your food first.

262
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You're a grown woman now,

263
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:21,480
still

264
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,679
feeling shy.

265
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:46,440
Chairman Xin.

266
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:48,919
Chairman Xin.

267
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:53,639
You seem in a bad mood.

268
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:56,480
You seem distracted these past few days.

269
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,399
Do I?

270
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,039
Stop staring at me.

271
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,159
Focus on your work.

272
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,879
If you have any difficulties,

273
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,080
you can tell me.

274
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,039
As your assistant,

275
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,360
it's my duty to help share your burden.

276
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,240
I'm really fine.

277
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:25,840
Thank you.
