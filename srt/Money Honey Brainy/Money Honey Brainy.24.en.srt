1
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,840
You should know clearly

2
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,240
that being with me

3
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:53,320
comes with a price.

4
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,359
Whatever you want to do,

5
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,159
is fine.

6
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,640
All right.

7
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,719
You said it yourself.

8
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,200
Whatever I want,

9
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,519
is fine.

10
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,000
Today,

11
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,159
I'm going to make your life

12
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:20,000
a living hell,

13
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,480
unable to live or die.

14
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,840
We've been through so much together.

15
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,920
Do you

16
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,519
have no empathy at all?

17
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,319
A marriage of convenience is just rubbish.

18
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:37,519
Since you want to marry me so much,

19
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,439
fine.

20
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:44,239
Then I'll let you experience

21
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,959
what is called

22
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,280
the joys of marriage.

23
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,239
Aren't they overacting a bit?

24
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,120
But

25
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,959
users love watching this kind of thing now.

26
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,120
They really look like a couple.

27
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,200
I just want you to understand

28
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,920
that my feelings for you

29
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,520
have nothing to do with family,

30
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,479
nothing to do with marriage.

31
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,919
It's simply because I love you.

32
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,520
They are acting really well.

33
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,639
This doesn't look like acting.

34
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,240
Let's go.

35
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,919
You guys.

36
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:24,800
Not bad.

37
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,319
So tell me.

38
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,840
Today,

39
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,719
what story are you making up

40
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,199
to trick this old man?

41
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,240
I'm getting old.

42
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,400
You want me to watch your soap opera?

43
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,080
Chairman,

44
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,759
I didn't mean to hide it from you for so many years.

45
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,639
Be honest.

46
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,319
When did you get together?

47
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,080
Dad.

48
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,599
Eight years.

49
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,039
We've been together since high school.

50
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,400
Let her speak for herself.

51
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,280
Speak.

52
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:57,719
It's been eight years.

53
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,400
I knew something was up with you two long ago.

54
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,439
And you two.

55
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,080
What is going on with you two?

56
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,479
Didn't you tell us it was fake?

57
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,199
How did it become real?

58
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,199
Dad.

59
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,400
Uncle.

60
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,879
We just

61
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,439
renewed our contract.

62
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,920
Don't just stand there.

63
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,680
It's the weekend.

64
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,399
Go out on a date, hurry.

65
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,319
Don't be an eyesore here.

66
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,160
Go on, leave.

67
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,079
Go, go, go.

68
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,680
Hurry up.

69
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,639
Go on.

70
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:54,439
Dad.

71
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,240
We already have proof of our love.

72
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,360
This is...

73
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,759
it's the fruit of love.

74
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:00,160
Come here.

75
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,879
Let me see.

76
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,519
I'm waiting for my grandson to call me Grandpa.

77
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,959
Dear friends,

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,759
today,

79
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:20,040
I want to announce some news.

80
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,519
I

81
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,600
am getting married.

82
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:25,759
Ou Lu.

83
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,720
Although for us,

84
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,680
today is an ordinary day,

85
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,399
every day after today

86
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,879
will be extraordinary.

87
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,360
Because today,

88
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,399
you are going to

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,920
propose to me.

90
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,079
All our romantic past

91
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,720
has become a vision for the future.

92
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,240
After going through the eighty-one trials,

93
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,480
as long as we can get the prize in the end,

94
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,879
nothing else matters.

95
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,199
Ou Lu,

96
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,759
it's time to claim the prize.

97
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,199
Miss Qixing,

98
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,519
will you marry me?

99
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,879
I do.

100
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,279
To the darlings in the livestream today

101
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,120
witnessing my happy moment,

102
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,560
go to my fan group right now

103
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,120
to get a coupon for 80 off 100.

104
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,079
See you at our next livestream.

105
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,800
Bye!

106
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,639
Those two are way too romantic.

107
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
This is my resume.

108
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,879
Please

109
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,560
have a look, interviewer.

110
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,560
Alright.

111
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,160
Then please introduce yourself.

112
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,439
Hello, interviewer.

113
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,720
My name is Wen Pei'an.

114
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,240
I graduated from the University of Oxford.

115
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,000
I have been interning at your company for six months now.

116
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,319
The internship period has just ended.

117
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:30,920
Now,

118
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,600
I very much want to become a full-time employee.

119
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,920
Then tell me,

120
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,639
why are you so determined to stay at our company?

121
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,480
During the internship period,

122
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,480
I experienced a sense of

123
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,639
wonderful fulfillment I've never felt before.

124
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,480
Therefore,

125
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,839
I really want to become a full-time employee.

126
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,720
To be able to become your company's

127
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,759
long-term partner,

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,839
and grow together.

129
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,839
Tell me about something

130
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,120
you found

131
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,439
most memorable during your internship.

132
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,160
During this time,

133
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,399
every day,

134
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,319
every hour,

135
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,120
every moment,

136
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:02,920
every minute,

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,680
every second

138
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,199
left a deep impression on me.

139
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,319
What are your strengths?

140
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:13,920
Wealthy.

141
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:15,560
Good physique.

142
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,040
High educational background.

143
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,319
And your weaknesses?

144
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,800
My weakness is

145
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,720
being too much of a perfectionist.

146
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,800
But during this time,

147
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,920
I deeply

148
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,079
came to understand

149
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,199
that perfection

150
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,439
is built from countless imperfections.

151
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,759
And these

152
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,720
seemingly imperfect things

153
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,519
are even more memorable.

154
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,960
So, do you think

155
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,480
you yourself are qualified for this job?

156
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,080
I have made thorough preparations,

157
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,639
and during the internship period,

158
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,919
I also gained some

159
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,120
in-depth understanding of your company.

160
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
I don't know if I

161
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,639
can shoulder this responsibility,

162
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,320
but

163
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,440
I will definitely give it my all

164
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,919
and strive to do my best.

165
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,960
Well then,

166
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,039
now tell me about

167
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,360
your career plan for the next five years.

168
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,840
To, together with the company,

169
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,879
learn,

170
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,360
love,

171
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:08,000
and the ability to be loved.

172
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,879
To jointly incubate some

173
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,000
resounding...

174
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:13,840
projects.

175
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,519
It's "resounding".

176
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,080
"Resounding"...

177
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,759
Like a newborn baby's cry...

178
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,000
"Resounding".

179
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:26,480
Also, I think your planning timeframe is a bit short.

180
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,879
If possible,

181
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,799
I hope it's forever.

182
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:37,879
Last question.

183
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,720
Do you have

184
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:43,759
any other job offers in hand?

185
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,720
Just this one.

186
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,080
Alright.

187
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,600
I've finished my questions.

188
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Now it's your turn to ask.

189
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,440
Will you marry me?

190
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,759
If

191
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,279
you feel I'm not yet qualified, that's okay.

192
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,200
You don't have to sign yet.

193
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,440
At worst, I'll just keep interning.

194
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
But I will always stand

195
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,639
wherever your gaze can reach,
