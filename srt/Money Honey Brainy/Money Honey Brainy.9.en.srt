1
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,640
Thank you

2
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,359
for letting bygones be bygones

3
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:41,960
and giving me a ride

4
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,560
You

5
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:44,439
what are you doing at Four Seas Tower?

6
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:46,479
If it's inconvenient for you

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,479
just drop me off at the subway station ahead

8
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:49,560
I can get there myself

9
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:50,359
It's okay

10
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,640
It's on the way

11
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,399
You still haven't told me

12
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:58,479
what you're going there for

13
00:00:58,799 --> 00:00:59,880
I'm going to work

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,760
My boss

15
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,400
is just a

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,799
stupid

17
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,959
little bastard

18
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:34,959
Thank you

19
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:41,439
I'll treat you to dinner tonight

20
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,359
Sorry, sorry

21
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,519
Why are you here?

22
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,120
I am

23
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,799
the new

24
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:04,599
President's

25
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,079
Assistant

26
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,520
Assistant

27
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,159
This is our President

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,639
Hello, President

29
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,240
I am Rico from Marketing

30
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:27,479
Good

31
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,599
Let's start the meeting

32
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:29,960
Today, you two

33
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:30,800
are both late

34
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,680
Don't let it happen again

35
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:38,719
Wait a minute

36
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,520
What's your situation?

37
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,479
When did you come to

38
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,719
our company to be an assistant?

39
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,719
First day on the job

40
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,879
Probation isn't over yet

41
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,319
Meeting

42
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:48,719
Quick

43
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:51,639
Rico

44
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:52,840
you grabbed some too, right?

45
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,840
Hurry and make him print more

46
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,520
The village toilet has been out of paper for ages

47
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,960
Rico

48
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,120
what do you think of this plan?

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,120
It's fine

50
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,360
Just these few points

51
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,159
Sorry, sorry

52
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,159
Sorry

53
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,680
The President is here, the President is here

54
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,479
That's not right

55
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,960
Why is the boss sitting here?

56
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,400
Strange

57
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,639
Hello everyone

58
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,439
Today's

59
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,439
meeting content

60
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,560
is to discuss with the

61
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,120
colleagues from Marketing

62
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,039
together about

63
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:46,080
Q3 and Q4 product supply

64
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,560
and marketing

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,639
So first

66
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,840
let's invite Asher

67
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,000
to introduce the product supply

68
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,520
In Q3 and Q4

69
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,520
there are many festivals

70
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,639
We plan to base it on the festival livestream themes

71
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,479
and launch some specialty foods

72
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,080
As for the trendy Heritage Food series

73
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,439
we plan to choose

74
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,039
Paoda Food Group's

75
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,319
xiaolongbao and shaomai

76
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,759
Such an obvious problem

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,960
can't you see it?

78
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,319
Understood

79
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:17,959
Heritage Food

80
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,199
This is a very good approach

81
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,720
It has selling points

82
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,720
It has highlights

83
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,040
And it's delicious

84
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,839
I really like eating it

85
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,879
This idiot

86
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,800
Do you have any

87
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,360
ideas?

88
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,800
Good morning, everyone.

89
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,639
Regarding the product operation plan,

90
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:41,720
I have a few

91
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,839
minor

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,600
objections.

93
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,600
Is this still the domineering Galileo I know?

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,199
Isn't it your first day at work?

95
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,439
What objections could you possibly have?

96
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,720
What do you know?

97
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,439
Paoda Group's heritage cooked food is indeed good,

98
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,680
but their production methods are completely different.

99
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,879
They only kept the superficial resemblance

100
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,319
but completely forgot about

101
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,399
its inner soul.

102
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,959
So my proposal is

103
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:07,879
to switch to a different company.

104
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,040
I didn't expect this guy

105
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,079
to have really done his research.

106
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,480
What do you think?

107
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,439
I completely agree with your idea.

108
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,720
I think the same as you.

109
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,680
Just as I thought,

110
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,439
this incompetent president

111
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:27,480
will definitely run the company into the ground.

112
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,399
As for the dessert series,

113
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,120
we plan to continue our cooperation with

114
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,439
Mizhi Group.

115
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,040
No.

116
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,720
Mizhi Group's products

117
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,120
did indeed sell well in the past,

118
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:38,560
but their recent flagship chocolate series

119
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,240
has mediocre, old-fashioned packaging.

120
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,319
It doesn't match our Four Seas

121
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,720
newly proposed youthful

122
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,600
and fun brand identity.

123
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:45,759
Moreover,

124
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,800
they replaced the original dairy cream

125
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,519
with cheap vegetable cream.

126
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,519
So,

127
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,800
what's your view?

128
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,639
I also think

129
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,680
it's not suitable.

130
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,079
Then we can switch to another one.

131
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:03,920
For example,

132
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,360
Taoyuan Desserts.

133
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:09,240
Taoyuan Desserts just raised their prices this year.

134
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,279
And then there's

135
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Lexiong Group.

136
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,680
Lexiong's food safety lawsuit is still ongoing.

137
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,959
Their credibility is low.

138
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,519
This guy is way too bold.

139
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,759
In front of so many people,

140
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,920
directly challenging his own boss.

141
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,160
Impressive, impressive.

142
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,480
He made that little turtle

143
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,120
look like a total weakling.

144
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,600
As for me,

145
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,040
I've also gathered operational ideas

146
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,519
for other products in Q3 and Q4.

147
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,800
I'd like to share them with everyone.

148
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,879
First of all,

149
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,199
we must ensure the use of dairy cream.

150
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,240
This way we can retain

151
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,680
the majority of our users.

152
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,360
So,

153
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,240
isn't he handsome?

154
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,240
I actually think

155
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,279
this little assistant is more

156
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,399
handsome.

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,839
Little assistant,

158
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,120
don't you think he talks too much?

159
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,560
Our

160
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,959
Four Seas Group

161
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,240
needs a straightforward assistant like him.

162
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,519
Stop arguing.

163
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:06,839
These two

164
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,319
I don't get either of them.

165
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,160
So,

166
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,439
my acting wasn't bad, right?

167
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,439
A few moments ago were pretty intense.

168
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,399
Good thing our teamwork was smooth and seamless.

169
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,560
I didn't feel it was smooth at all.

170
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,160
So,

171
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,800
why is Xin Tong at our company?

172
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,879
Xin Tong is Rico.

173
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:36,639
Did you know?

174
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,319
I didn't know.

175
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,399
Didn't I ask you to investigate?

176
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,360
I couldn't find out.

177
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,279
Then why

178
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,519
don't you want her to know

179
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,600
that you're the president?

180
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,040
Sis, I keep my promises.

181
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,279
I'll treat you to a big lunch.

182
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:11,920
You're smiling.

183
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,160
That smile of yours is not normal.

184
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,439
Am I smiling?

185
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,240
Yes.

186
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,240
Happily

187
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,319
and creepily.

188
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,519
Wen Pei'an,

189
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,920
I'm telling you for sure,

190
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,399
you're in trouble.

191
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,080
Hello.

192
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:46,639
So,

193
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,679
working stiff?

194
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,159
Homemade hot pot.

195
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,879
This is the big meal you promised?

196
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,639
And this is the upgraded version.

197
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:57,480
Sit down, quick.

198
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:04,399
Smell it.

199
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,240
Doesn't it smell good?

200
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,000
Isn't it especially fragrant?

201
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:17,720
You

202
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,960
Why did you suddenly come to our Four Seas Group

203
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,159
to be the President?

204
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,080
No.

205
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,399
To be the President's Assistant.

206
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,399
Isn't your family super rich?

207
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,879
I am.

208
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,440
Don't tell me.

209
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,919
Let me guess.

210
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,279
It must be...

211
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,679
Your dad gave you some kind of mission.

212
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:40,440
Tell me.

213
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,720
Wen Pei'an,

214
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,840
you must find a girlfriend

215
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,559
to inherit our family business.

216
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:49,440
So,

217
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:51,799
you found me to be your contract girlfriend,

218
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,559
and you're lying low at Four Seas Group

219
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,960
to learn,

220
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,600
then go back

221
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,840
and take over your own group.

222
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:00,360
Right?

223
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:01,679
Right.

224
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,039
This Four Seas Group

225
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,840
must be your competitor.

226
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,000
You're here as a mole.

227
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,200
To learn,

228
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:11,799
mainly to learn.

229
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,639
Well, you picked a really bad time.

230
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,399
Our newly appointed President

231
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:17,960
is clearly just a

232
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,799
hopeless loser who can't be helped.

233
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,559
Being by his side,

234
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,000
you won't learn a thing.

235
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:26,679
So,

236
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,039
how's the taste?

237
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,000
Not bad, right?

238
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,960
As long as it's delicious.

239
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:33,759
As for me,

240
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,679
there's something

241
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:36,879
I'd like to ask of you.

242
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:39,440
Go ahead.

243
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,879
As long as it's within my power,

244
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,759
I'll definitely help you.

245
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,720
Do you know Qi Xing?

246
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,200
You mean that

247
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,600
internet celebrity Qi Xing?

248
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:51,159
Yes.

249
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:55,039
I want you to help me persuade that little bastard

250
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,759
to sign this Qi Xing,

251
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,960
or at least

252
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,240
do a few live streams with her.

253
00:10:59,360 --> 00:10:59,759
What do you say?

254
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,960
But I heard she

255
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,600
lives abroad year-round.

256
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:07,480
Isn't that just a plane ticket away?

257
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:08,639
Look at you,

258
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:09,799
you're already right there

259
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,720
as the little bastard's assistant.

260
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,720
When you have time, just help me

261
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,480
put in a good word.

262
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,639
About this matter...

263
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:17,720
Hold on a second.

264
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:24,919
Qi Xing is back.

265
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,720
What's wrong?

266
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:30,480
The little bastard is looking for you.

267
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,080
Well,

268
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,799
then you should eat quickly.

269
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,480
He really holds a grudge.

270
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,000
It wouldn't be good to offend him.

271
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,200
She's really so beautiful.

272
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,799
So gorgeous.

273
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:54,960
Good luck.

274
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,399
Does Wen Pei'an know I'm back?

275
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,120
Of course.

276
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,440
Your every move

277
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,759
is under his control.

278
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,919
Then he must be very nervous.

279
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,120
After all,

280
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,879
I'm his little nemesis.

281
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,200
Why come back at this time?

282
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,639
Is she planning to cause trouble again?
