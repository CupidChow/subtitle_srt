1
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:37,799
This one

2
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:39,439
Or this one

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,520
This one

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,439
Alright

5
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,039
This is it

6
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:48,799
I'm counting on you today

7
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:55,960
Miss Qixing

8
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,719
I've made plans with Xin Tong

9
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,320
After tonight

10
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,079
You

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,399
will be the heir to Four Seas

12
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,079
Good

13
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,480
Tonight will be spectacular

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,959
I've already promised Lin Xiang

15
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,280
to attend the banquet as his girlfriend

16
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,280
Then we'll accompany him

17
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,920
in putting on a good show

18
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,640
Has your dance partner arrived?

19
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,640
Should be soon

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,239
Being your dance partner

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,359
is quite fortunate

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,519
Sorry

23
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:33,319
I'm late

24
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:35,280
You look beautiful today

25
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,040
Thank you

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,680
Let me introduce you to my parents

27
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,120
Mom, Dad

28
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:44,560
This is my friend

29
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,120
Xin Tong

30
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:46,599
Hello, Uncle and Auntie

31
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,680
Miss Xin

32
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,040
What does your family do?

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,239
I...

34
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,359
I don't have a family

35
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,359
How can you not have a family?

36
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,719
I grew up in an orphanage

37
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,959
How pitiful

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,879
You must have suffered a lot

39
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,319
However

40
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,000
Children raised in such an environment

41
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,240
are very good at assessing situations

42
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,000
and finding a big tree to lean on

43
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,639
Mom

44
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,280
I have to say

45
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,960
you have good taste

46
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,599
in targeting our Lin Xiang

47
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,479
That's enough

48
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:30,719
Let me introduce you to some other friends

49
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:37,960
President Wen

50
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,759
Let me introduce you two

51
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,960
This is Xin Tong

52
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,080
My girlfriend

53
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,759
Hello, Uncle and Auntie

54
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,080
Good

55
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:49,919
By the way

56
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,479
Look at my memory

57
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,479
Xin Tong is your Four Seas employee

58
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:54,919
You must have met her, right?

59
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,319
I seem to have some impression

60
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:57,960
You are...

61
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,879
Which department?

62
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,319
Chairman

63
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,039
I'm from Marketing and Operations

64
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,439
People from Operations

65
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,000
seem to be

66
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,439
all-rounders

67
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:06,800
Right?

68
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,840
Xin Tong is my junior

69
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:09,719
The two of us

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,159
could be called childhood sweethearts

71
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,479
Childhood sweethearts

72
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,840
Old Lin

73
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:17,960
Look at this

74
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:19,800
A talented man

75
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,360
and a beautiful woman

76
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,439
Your Lin family

77
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,319
is truly blessed

78
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,479
You flatter us

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,439
I heard Young Master Wen

80
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,639
is also about to get engaged

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,919
This means we have

82
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,159
double happiness arriving

83
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,199
Dad

84
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:30,680
Mom

85
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,000
Here we are

86
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,280
Let me introduce you

87
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,919
This is my daughter

88
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:36,759
Qixing

89
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:38,919
Hello, Uncle and Auntie

90
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,000
Before this

91
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,159
we never imagined

92
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,520
the big influencer Qixing

93
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,960
was the Wen family's daughter

94
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,199
Lin Xiang was the one who told us

95
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:48,879
Xin Tong

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,439
No, no

97
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,360
You should call her sister-in-law

98
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,159
Where's my brother?

99
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:53,879
Wait a minute

100
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,439
Sister-in-law?

101
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,360
What's going on?

102
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,599
Qixing

103
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,280
When did you

104
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,759
start calling Lin Xiang 'brother'?

105
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,319
Calling him...

106
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,280
What are you talking about?

107
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,479
You didn't come with my brother?

108
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,120
Dad

109
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,960
Where's Wen Pei'an?

110
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:12,439
He'll be here soon

111
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,000
Xin Tong

112
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,479
What does 'sister-in-law' mean?

113
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:15,719
You...

114
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,120
Let me explain to you later

115
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:17,800
Lin Xiang

116
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:19,959
Xin Tong didn't tell you, did she?

117
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,000
She and my brother are about to get married

118
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,079
Xin Tong

119
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,000
Is there something you're hiding from me?

120
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,480
Senior

121
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,399
Listen, let me explain

122
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,079
Wen Pei'an and I are just fake lovers

123
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,279
Sorry, everyone

124
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,199
I'm late to the event

125
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,199
Brother

126
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,720
You'll really stop at nothing

127
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,959
for the inheritance, won't you?

128
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,000
What do you mean by that?

129
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,000
Dad

130
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,040
I really can't stand it anymore

131
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,519
Wen Pei'an has been deceiving you all along

132
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,000
This is his relationship contract with Xin Tong

133
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,959
I will spare no effort

134
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,439
to push you to the position of Four Seas' heir.

135
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,600
Even if it means becoming

136
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,720
a live-in son-in-law of the Wen family.

137
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,079
Happy cooperation.

138
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,120
Not only that,

139
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,680
Wen Pei'an,

140
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,120
while in charge of Four Seas,

141
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,839
allowed huge management loopholes to appear.

142
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,399
Qixing,

143
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,959
why are you doing this?

144
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,319
I agree with your point of view.

145
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,720
We are born to be treated unequally.

146
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,439
But I am different from you.

147
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,680
You are still trapped in their rules,

148
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,079
while I

149
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,040
want to create my own rules.

150
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,959
Xin Tong,

151
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,399
you actually sold yourself for money

152
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,000
to sign this bottomless Relationship Contract.

153
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:01,160
How is this different from sex work?

154
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,800
You have really disappointed me greatly.

155
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,360
I am so disappointed.

156
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,680
Dad,

157
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,839
I'm sorry.

158
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,199
I was the one who dragged Xin Tong into this.

159
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,040
It is all my fault.

160
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,079
This has nothing to do with her.

161
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,519
Stop blaming her, all of you.

162
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,120
As for that contract,

163
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,920
it was I, as the President,

164
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,199
who forced her to sign it.

165
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,560
Senior...

166
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,279
why are you treating me like this?

167
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,079
Gold digger!

168
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,319
Let go of my son!

169
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,480
Enough!

170
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,879
This farce should end.

171
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,240
It is time for it to end.

172
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,519
Xin Tong,

173
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,639
you need to open your eyes

174
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,160
and take a good look at this

175
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,079
sanctimonious Four Seas heir beside you.

176
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,839
In order to deal with me,

177
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,680
he has been using you all along.

178
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
For this event,

179
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,680
we must make Qixing stumble.

180
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,680
Mobilize all available resources.

181
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,079
Don't worry,

182
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:00,800
I will arrange it.

183
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,959
I can prove

184
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,959
that the data fraud in this livestream event

185
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,959
and the skyrocketing return rate

186
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,199
were caused by Wen Pei'an

187
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,519
and Xin Tong single-handedly.

188
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,759
The goal was to make Qixing back off

189
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,439
and leave Four Seas.

190
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,879
You didn't expect this, did you?

191
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,120
Your wishful thinking

192
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,759
has fallen through with me again.

193
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,079
So what?

194
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,560
Is there any other evidence?

195
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,480
Just based on a recording and a word from my assistant,

196
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,439
what can you do?

197
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:28,959
Bring me down?

198
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,199
Lin Xiang,

199
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,399
you are just a hopeless case.

200
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,240
A hopeless case.

201
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,399
Our Lin family,

202
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,800
as a supplier for Four Seas Group for ten years...

203
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,000
President Wen,

204
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,519
I really cannot bear to see

205
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,399
Four Seas Group

206
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,759
be destroyed in Wen Pei'an's hands like this.

207
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,920
I have a hard drive here.

208
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:04,160
It contains the chain of evidence for the Lin family's

209
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,079
data fraud in this livestream event.

210
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,600
Not only that,

211
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,839
in order to prove that he

212
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,639
can be a qualified heir,

213
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,439
for the past six months,

214
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:14,040
all livestream activities

215
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,040
have involved data fraud.

216
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,600
President Wen, please take a look.

217
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,839
It is all faked.

218
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,319
Since he dares to fake data,

219
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,360
Exactly.

220
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,799
The Lin Group

221
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,200
has wanted to expand online business for years.

222
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,480
Lin Xiang happens to be in charge of this area.

223
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:49,879
So for all these years,

224
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,559
he has been framing Four Seas openly and secretly without limits.

225
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,240
Our livestream data fraud this time

226
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,519
is inextricably linked to him.

227
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,799
So,

228
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,559
what we lack now

229
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,039
is the evidence of data fraud.

230
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,000
That's right.

231
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:06,240
We need to get the Lin family's fake data.

232
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,080
Then do you have a plan for calling me here?

233
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:14,879
I want to

234
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,639
use Baiting.

235
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
Baiting?

236
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:17,960
What will you use as bait?

237
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,519
You.

238
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,240
The plan is this.

239
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,679
I, Lin Xiang, dare to speak up today

240
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,720
on behalf of all suppliers of Four Seas Group

241
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,080
to sincerely offer you a suggestion.

242
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,399
We unanimously believe

243
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,679
that Miss Qixing

244
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,559
is the most suitable heir

245
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,360
for the future of Four Seas Group.

246
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,279
Xin Tong,

247
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:46,879
as long as you are willing,

248
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,799
the doors of the Lin Group

249
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,759
will always be open to you.

250
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,759
This is the last time I'll call you Senior.

251
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:57,840
That's right.

252
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,879
You were the white moonlight of my youth.

253
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,159
However,

254
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,320
that was just a fantasy.

255
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,720
Now I see the truth.

256
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,799
I also know

257
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,080
that white moonlight

258
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,279
is just the sun's reflection.

259
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,840
And the moon's surface

260
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:13,960
is pockmarked

261
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,919
and scarred,

262
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,639
just like your current face.

263
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,360
It disgusts me.

264
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:19,960
Lin Xiang,

265
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,840
Have I not told you yet

266
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,919
that I've long been the heir to Four Seas Group?

267
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,879
Our Four Seas Group now

268
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,399
operates under a Co-CEO system.

269
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,840
What do you mean?

270
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,679
What do I mean?

271
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,960
I have a recording here

272
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,679
that might be more interesting.

273
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,399
I can help you publicly expose

274
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,120
Wen Pei'an and Xin Tong's fake relationship.

275
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,240
Make your parents lose face.

276
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,759
Guaranteed to overwhelm Wen Pei'an.

277
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,000
We can also use

278
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,840
this live-stream incident to frame him.

279
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,519
But you must promise me,

280
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:56,399
after you successfully enter Four Seas,

281
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,200
you'll use your authority

282
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,200
to help me cover up

283
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,519
the data fraud from this impromptu event.

284
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,799
But I'm curious.

285
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,840
Do you really not care about Xin Tong's feelings?

286
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,360
Don't you think

287
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,399
for someone of my background,

288
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,440
women of her class

289
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,480
are just dolls on a shelf?

290
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:18,960
Whoever bids highest gets her.

291
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,519
Besides, I've never lacked for toys since childhood.

292
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:24,720
Furthermore,

293
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,399
for a man to rise to power,

294
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:29,480
he must always sacrifice a few women first.

295
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,679
Tonight's banquet

296
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,519
is our Treacherous Banquet for you.

297
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,639
The data from the USB drive has been given to the authorities.

298
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,399
Now we have ironclad proof of your fraud.

299
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,960
Alright.

300
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,320
That's enough.

301
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,759
Chairman Lin,

302
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,200
regarding this matter,

303
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,159
I don't intend to pursue it further.

304
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,960
But your son

305
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:53,279
almost destroyed your Lin family

306
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,960
and my Four Seas' decades of legacy.

307
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,120
You should discipline him properly.

308
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,279
Lin Xiang,

309
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,639
you've brought great shame to the Lin family.

310
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:05,759
Dad,

311
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,600
everything I did

312
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,799
was for the sake of the Lin Group.

313
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,399
I don't want to be

314
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,879
the son who disappoints you anymore.

315
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,559
Stop embarrassing yourself here.

316
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:17,879
Dad!

317
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:19,360
Mom!

318
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,000
Dad!

319
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,320
Mom!

320
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,039
This...

321
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:26,399
The act is over already?

322
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:27,759
I...

323
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,320
I haven't had enough fun yet.

324
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,559
Then what do you want to do?

325
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:31,720
I should be...

326
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,559
You've disappointed me so much.

327
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:36,240
Brother,

328
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,320
do you have a plan?

329
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,320
Since everyone loves acting so much,

330
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,559
why don't we put on a good show?

331
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,679
Wait, wait!

332
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,759
Putting on a show?

333
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,039
How can you leave your old man out?

334
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,399
Qixing,

335
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,399
you play the villain.

336
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,080
Alright.

337
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,679
Xin Tong...

338
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:57,919
No,

339
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,720
I should call you Sister-in-law.

340
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:00,919
Sister-in-law.

341
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,639
Where's my brother?

342
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:05,600
Qixing!

343
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,519
You...

344
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,399
You...

345
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,320
Dad!

346
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,039
This is their

347
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,759
Relationship Contract.

348
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,159
Qixing,

349
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,360
I don't understand.

350
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,360
Why did you have to do this?

351
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:30,919
Dear Xin Tong,

352
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,759
I didn't mean to hurt you.

353
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,159
But I believe

354
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:36,399
we are from different worlds.

355
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:37,600
You're still trapped

356
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,120
in the rules they created,

357
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,600
while I, Qixing,

358
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,720
must rely on my own strength

359
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,679
to change my fate.

360
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,200
You've disappointed me so much.

361
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,200
No, no.

362
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,519
Not forceful enough.

363
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,039
Let me try again.

364
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,399
You've disappointed me so much!

365
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,759
Lin Xiang's work ability

366
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,759
has never been recognized by his father.

367
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,639
Plus, he's very jealous of my brother.

368
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,480
People like him fear having their pride wounded most.

369
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,879
We can deliberately provoke him

370
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:15,120
and use that as a breakthrough

371
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,639
to make him reveal

372
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,960
the evidence of data fraud himself.

373
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,159
I never trample on others' dignity.

374
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,480
What evidence do you have?

375
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Just based on a recording

376
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,399
and a word from my assistant?

377
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,759
Isn't that too childish?

378
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:35,200
Lin Xiang,

379
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,840
You are just a

380
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,960
hopeless

381
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:41,240
case.

382
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,240
Was that forceful enough?
