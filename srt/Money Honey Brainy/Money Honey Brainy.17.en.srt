1
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,079
Outdoor livestream

2
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:40,920
You...

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,399
You didn't use your position for personal gain, did you?

4
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:46,719
This report

5
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:48,880
passed the audit of every department in the company,

6
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:49,600
including

7
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,159
a 106-page feasibility report,

8
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,759
79 pages of data analysis,

9
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,320
and 38 pages of ROI analysis.

10
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,960
I didn't use my position for personal gain.

11
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:57,119
I also hope you

12
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,640
can handle matters impartially.

13
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,079
Thank you, President Wen.

14
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,079
Monitor this livestream closely.

15
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,719
Mobilize all available resources.

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,239
I suspect

17
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,200
someone is maliciously manipulating data

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,879
to lower our ranking.

19
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:29,760
Don't worry.

20
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:30,439
I'll handle it.

21
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:38,439
Thank you to all the Little Stars for your support.

22
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,599
Saturday night at 8:00,

23
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,560
we will bring you

24
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,760
even more perks and discounts.

25
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,480
Please tune in then.

26
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,599
See you next time!

27
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,840
Good work, good work.

28
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,599
Drink some water.

29
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,239
Good job, have some water.

30
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,319
Oh my god.

31
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,040
Let me tell you,

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,840
the results of this livestream were off the charts!

33
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,560
Do you know?

34
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,480
In just three hours of streaming,

35
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,159
the total GMV has already broken 10 million!

36
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,200
Broken 10 million?

37
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,760
Yes!

38
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,680
You didn't expect that, did you?

39
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,400
I'm going to quickly prepare

40
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,920
the product selection for your next stream.

41
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:08,879
They're all bestsellers.

42
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,080
See you tonight.

43
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,400
Go, go, go.

44
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:10,759
Bye-bye.

45
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,039
Good work, everyone.

46
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,479
Ms. Qi Xing, thank you for your hard work.

47
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,080
Um,

48
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,000
since this livestream event

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,159
is quite far from the city,

50
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,479
you'll have to rough it a bit tonight

51
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,080
and stay overnight in a tent here at the camp.

52
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,840
It's fine, I can handle it.

53
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,240
Actually, I've been following you for a long time.

54
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,360
Ever since that

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,879
Amazon Rainforest livestream.

56
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:29,520
Thank you.

57
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,280
Get some rest,

58
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,960
Ms. Qi Xing.

59
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,759
Didn't you say you couldn't be bothered?

60
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,960
Why are you suddenly going?

61
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,680
This project is quite important to the company,

62
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,400
so I want to go see it for myself.

63
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
Is it really just to see the project?

64
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,840
Just drive.

65
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,840
Talk less.

66
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,039
President Wen?

67
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,120
What brings you here?

68
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:07,960
You know who I am?

69
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,280
I didn't recognize you before.

70
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,719
I only realized after reading Sihai's internal journal

71
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,240
that I had already met the legend.

72
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,479
That day at the art exhibition,

73
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,879
I spouted some nonsense.

74
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,159
Please don't take it to heart.

75
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,599
I'm not that petty.

76
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:26,800
You know,

77
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,080
in my position,

78
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,840
it's hard to hear the truth.

79
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,439
That's true.

80
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:30,879
I understand.

81
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:32,840
Don't worry.

82
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,039
I am someone

83
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,199
who is very tight-lipped.

84
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,599
I will definitely keep your secret.

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,800
He...

86
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,719
He is my...

87
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:43,240
Op-

88
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,719
po-

89
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:44,599
site-

90
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:45,280
sex

91
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:45,759
bestie.

92
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:46,479
Get it?

93
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,800
As Sihai Group's closest partner,

94
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,439
I trust you.

95
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,479
Definitely.

96
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,879
I trust you.

97
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,400
Yeah, right.

98
00:03:59,400 --> 00:03:59,960
President Wen,

99
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,319
what brings you here?

100
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,479
As your boss,

101
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,280
I have to come inspect the work, of course.

102
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,800
The fact that President Wen came

103
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,400
shows how much importance he attaches

104
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,439
to the cooperation between Sihai and Lin's Group.

105
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,240
So, are you two now...

106
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,680
I was blind before.

107
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,439
I didn't know your

108
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,800
"good friend" was actually the young Mr. Wen of Sihai Group.

109
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,399
How were the results of today's livestream?

110
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,600
The results were excellent.

111
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,279
In three hours, the total GMV

112
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,680
has already broken 10 million.

113
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,600
And the ROI is already 14.

114
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:35,879
There's still room for growth.

115
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,439
Is there another broadcast tomorrow morning?

116
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,199
Yes.

117
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,439
Tomorrow, we plan to

118
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,120
start streaming from the early morning

119
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,560
and continue until the sun rises.

120
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,240
The theme is called

121
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,040
"Watching the Sunrise

122
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:47,680
with You."

123
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,759
Watching the sunrise?

124
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,319
Good.

125
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,040
Then we'll stay the night.

126
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,879
Tomorrow, we'll all

127
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,439
watch the sunrise together.

128
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,800
That's great!

129
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,000
There is one problem.

130
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,519
We don't have enough tents.

131
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:03,399
Then...

132
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,000
Ou Lu can share a tent with Qixing.

133
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,120
You...

134
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,319
who will you share a tent with?

135
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,519
I can stay with President Lin.

136
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,199
Being able to stay with President Wen

137
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,399
That... that's my honor.

138
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,600
Today, I will not

139
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,800
give you a chance to get close to Xin Tong.

140
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,040
This

141
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,120
is our campsite for today.

142
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,879
Beautiful, right?

143
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,519
Hello.

144
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:34,959
Ou Lu.

145
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:35,720
Say hello.

146
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,600
Hello.

147
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:37,519
Hello.

148
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,279
Of course,

149
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,399
we can't forget

150
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,399
our little camping barbecue.

151
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,959
And our two handsome boss presidents.

152
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,240
Hello.

153
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:48,879
Of course,

154
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,040
and also

155
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,160
myself.

156
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:54,800
Xin Tong,

157
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,439
it's not quite done yet.

158
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,480
Let me grill President Wen a bit more...

159
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,360
I'll grill it a little longer.

160
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,759
Are there any other skewers ready?

161
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:17,600
Here.

162
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,000
What are you grilling?

163
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,720
So spicy!

164
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,680
Xin Tong,

165
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:25,879
have some water.

166
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,920
Wen Pei'an,

167
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,040
I'm going to rest for a bit.

168
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,519
I'll take over.

169
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,560
Today, I'll make you look bad in front of Xin Tong.

170
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,000
Let me do the grilling for a while.

171
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,360
Have some water.

172
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,519
Thank you, President Wen.

173
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:17,879
Drink up.

174
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,560
How did this happen?

175
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,319
Probably got shaken up too much during the move.

176
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,240
Are you okay?

177
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,240
Here's some tissue.

178
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,560
I'll do it.

179
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:44,600
I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it.

180
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,879
I'll do it, I'll do it.

181
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:07,959
No,

182
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:08,480
it's fine.

183
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,079
It's fine, President Wen.

184
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:09,639
Then you...

185
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:09,959
It's fine.

186
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:10,199
I'll change.

187
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:10,680
Change.

188
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,720
I'll go change.

189
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,720
Boss,

190
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,399
how do we light the charcoal without fire?

191
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,399
Sneaking around,

192
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,679
up to no good.

193
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,000
Our distance

194
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,480
is only one centimeter.

195
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,440
Wen...

196
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,159
Young Master Wen.

197
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,679
Wh...

198
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,320
What is it?

199
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,399
Looking for a lighter.

200
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,600
I'll be right there.

201
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,720
Otherwise,

202
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,519
you two rest for a bit.

203
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,720
My live stream is about to start.

204
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,720
I'm heading out now.

205
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:19,799
I'm fine here now.

206
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,919
You go help her.

207
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:21,840
Okay.

208
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,200
I think

209
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,679
there's something I must tell you.

210
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,120
Hold on, President Wen.

211
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,480
I also have something to say.

212
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,320
How about you listen to me first,

213
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,679
then decide if you still want to speak.

214
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:42,080
Go ahead.

215
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,559
I...

216
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,919
I think we're probably not the same kind of people.

217
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,759
Of course we're not the same kind of people.

218
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,039
I respect everyone's choices.

219
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,000
But, well...

220
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,000
But

221
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,320
what exactly are you trying to say?

222
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,000
You can see it.

223
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,759
The one I like is Xin Tong.

224
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,759
I like her too.

225
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:10,519
You...

226
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,879
You like Xin Tong?

227
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:14,919
That's right.

228
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:21,879
Not President Wen.

229
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,279
My...

230
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,759
My liking for Xin Tong is...

231
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,720
It's not love.

232
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,879
It's just...

233
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:30,600
that kind of pure friendship between a man and a woman.

234
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,519
Do you understand?

235
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:32,759
Therefore,

236
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:33,879
I hope this won't affect

237
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:35,120
the relationship between us.

238
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,639
To say something like that without batting an eye,

239
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,600
you're really not an ordinary person.

240
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,840
If you genuinely like her,

241
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,240
I would bless you both.

242
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,879
But your character...

243
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,759
You should know better than I do.

244
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,399
So I advise you to watch your step.

245
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,960
If I find out

246
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,960
you have any ulterior motives,

247
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,519
I will break my own principle

248
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,960
and stop being someone who separates public and private matters.

249
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:08,360
President Wen,

250
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,919
between Xin Tong and me,

251
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,399
it's just pure friendship between a man and a woman.

252
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,159
Please don't overthink it.

253
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,759
I hope I'm overthinking it.

254
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:54,600
Still up this late?

255
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,440
Ms. Qi Xing.

256
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,000
Enjoying the night.

257
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,519
I like the night too.

258
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,159
It's as if only in the deep night

259
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,919
is the time that truly belongs to oneself.

260
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,000
I often watch your livestreams at night.

261
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:14,759
When I was at my lowest,

262
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,840
your streams gave me strength.

263
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,200
So I don't just admire your talent,

264
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,639
I'm also drawn to your charm.

265
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,799
In other words,

266
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,759
you're my ideal type.

267
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,919
Then what is Xin Tong to you?

268
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,399
Xin Tong and I are just

269
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,080
good friends.

270
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:40,320
We're not lovers.

271
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,759
But she doesn't seem to think so.

272
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,480
I'm also afraid of hurting her.

273
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,600
So I need some time to explain it to her.

274
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,840
That's actually quite decent of you.

275
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,039
I believe people should treat each other with

276
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,000
the utmost goodwill.

277
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:00,679
To be honest,

278
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,039
this livestream by our Lin's Group

279
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:06,440
was tailor-made for you, Ms. Qi Xing.

280
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:07,960
With no regard for return on investment.

281
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,159
Thank you.

282
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,039
And I think

283
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,679
Sihai Group

284
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,440
should let a more capable person

285
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,519
become its successor.

286
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,720
But why are you so familiar

287
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,519
with my family affairs?

288
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,159
Let me make

289
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:28,720
an inappropriate assumption.

290
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,600
If you and I were to marry,

291
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,840
then Sihai and Lin's Group

292
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,240
would become Jiangcheng's largest commercial entity.

293
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,679
I would spare no effort

294
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,360
to push you onto Sihai's successor throne.

295
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,080
Even to the point of becoming

296
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,320
the Wen family's live-in son-in-law.

297
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,559
I didn't realize you were so ambitious.

298
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:52,480
But I like it.

299
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,879
I think you and I are the same kind of people.

300
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,639
Outwardly appearing gentle,

301
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,960
but inside,

302
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,320
a blazing fire burns.

303
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,639
To achieve our goals,

304
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:05,480
we'll use any means necessary.

305
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,440
Others think we're

306
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,720
docile little house cats,

307
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,919
but we're actually lions on the savannah.

308
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,320
Aiming to establish a new order on the plains.

309
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,320
Pleasure doing business.

310
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,120
Pleasure doing business.

311
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,600
Someone's fallen in the water!

312
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,840
Xin Tong!

313
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:51,960
Thank you, President Wen.

314
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,600
Here.
