1
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,039
Why do I feel lost

2
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,240
after she left?

3
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:02,679
After a successful hunt,

4
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:04,200
ancient humans needed a brief rest.

5
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,760
But prolonged relaxation

6
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,879
was detrimental to survival.

7
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,239
Modern humans retained this mechanism.

8
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,439
After achieving a goal,

9
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,280
the brain uses a sense of emptiness

10
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,280
to urge you to seek new challenges,

11
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,560
ensuring continuous adaptation to the environment.

12
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,480
What is the feeling of love?

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,680
When you think of the other person,

14
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,519
the brain's ventral tegmental area

15
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,400
and nucleus accumbens

16
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,560
release dopamine,

17
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:26,120
triggering excitement,

18
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,400
craving, and motivation.

19
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,359
It's similar to an addiction mechanism.

20
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:31,480
Physical contact like hugging

21
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,120
or holding hands

22
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,239
triggers these attachment hormones,

23
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:36,560
bringing a sense of security and trust.

24
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,079
This is especially evident in long-term relationships.

25
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,400
You involuntarily

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,319
pay attention to their every move,

27
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,359
even affecting your daily decisions.

28
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,319
She doesn't affect my decisions that much.

29
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,959
Don't mess with me.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,959
That's not it.

31
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:05,640
Hello?

32
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,479
One of the company's top livestreaming rooms got banned.

33
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
You guys decide on your own.

34
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,759
Don't call me unless it's important.

35
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,120
This is an urgent matter!

36
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,840
Even affecting daily decisions.

37
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,240
Wen Pei'an.

38
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,120
What does she want?

39
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:53,240
This aggressive aura...

40
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,280
Could it be...

41
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,280
This...

42
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,919
is our

43
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,439
Contractual Couple

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,080
Cooperation Termination Agreement.

45
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,280
Take a look.

46
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,039
If there are no issues,

47
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:14,840
then sign it.

48
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,000
It's time to end this.

49
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,280
It seems

50
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,400
she can't wait

51
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,319
to terminate the agreement with me.

52
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,360
I was just being sentimental.

53
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:42,919
Wait a minute.

54
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,439
Aren't you going to carefully

55
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,960
check the amount on here

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,919
before signing? No issues?

57
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:49,919
No need.

58
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,560
I'll transfer it to you today.

59
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,319
Thanks.

60
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,080
Pleasure doing business.

61
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,120
What's wrong?

62
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,120
Is there something else?

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,759
Remember,

64
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,720
expense claims need receipts attached.

65
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,240
The cooperation is finally over.

66
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,920
I should be happy, right?

67
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,839
This project is already finished.

68
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,160
Why does my heart feel

69
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,959
so empty?

70
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,720
I couldn't really have...

71
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:57,680
Assistant!

72
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,000
Question.

73
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,680
After a project ends,

74
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,959
why does one feel empty inside?

75
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,839
Why is that?

76
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,639
During the project,

77
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,639
goals were clear,

78
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,040
tasks were defined. After completion, you lose direction,

79
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,959
easily leading to a sense of emptiness.

80
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,319
Right.

81
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,720
During the project process,

82
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:22,000
you invest a lot of emotion and energy.

83
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,959
After it ends,

84
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,439
that emotion has nowhere to go,

85
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,959
causing an emotional disparity.

86
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,720
Normal.

87
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,160
These are all normal psychological effects.

88
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,279
It'll pass.

89
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:40,600
This...

90
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:47,680
This...

91
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,279
What is this?

92
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,759
Don't scare me.

93
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,240
How to detach from this emotional state?

94
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,920
Minimize unnecessary private communication.

95
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,399
Strictly limit conversations to work topics.

96
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,639
If possible,

97
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,160
reduce opportunities to meet them.

98
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,360
Choose open office environments,

99
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,519
avoid contact in enclosed spaces.

100
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,639
Detachment is a gradual process.

101
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,560
It requires time and patience.

102
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:31,560
Allow yourself occasional emotional relapses.

103
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,759
Gradually move past the emotional distress,

104
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,040
and return to a rational work and life state.

105
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,560
There's something I need to report to you.

106
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,600
Can't you see I'm busy?

107
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,040
It's about Xin Tong.

108
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,439
I'm free now.

109
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:51,839
Speak.

110
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,040
I just now

111
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,160
saw in the system

112
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,000
her resignation report.

113
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:57,879
What did you say?

114
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,319
Xin Tong!

115
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,120
Xin Tong!

116
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,759
Hello?

117
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,320
What's wrong?

118
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,600
Why didn't you say anything about moving out?

119
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,919
Our current contract

120
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,200
is already over.

121
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,919
It wouldn't be appropriate

122
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,360
for me to keep living at your place.

123
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,000
Why are you resigning?

124
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,240
Because

125
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,960
someone offered me a high salary to poach me.

126
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,279
I'm a bit uncomfortable without you here.

127
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,279
You'll get used to it soon.

128
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:22,600
He's just developed a temporary dependency

129
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,799
because of this cooperation.

130
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,200
I need to help the client with withdrawal.

131
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,240
That's my professional integrity.

132
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,759
Withdrawal.

133
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,559
Withdrawal is so hard.

134
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,799
If,

135
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,120
by twelve o'clock,

136
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,320
you call me one more time,

137
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,120
then I'll definitely answer.

138
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,120
Hello?

139
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,840
I like you.

140
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,639
I like you.
