1
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,640
Our recent

2
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,640
live streaming data

3
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,799
has had some issues.

4
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:41,759
As a result,

5
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,439
our weight was downgraded by the platform.

6
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,520
All of Four Seas' live streaming data for the past six months

7
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:48,799
appears normal,

8
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:49,880
but in reality,

9
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:52,560
the return rate has hit a record high.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,159
So I suspect

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,439
that someone

12
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:56,600
paid a high price

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,280
to inflate the data.

14
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:59,840
Are you and Lin Xiang officially together?

15
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,079
Of course not.

16
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,040
It's better if we just stay friends.

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,560
What about that day at the movies...

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,200
Please don't bring that up!

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,840
It's all Wen Pei'an's fault.

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,239
He pulled that stunt,

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,879
and I just acted on impulse.

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,760
Thinking about it now is mortifying.

23
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,079
My brother was worried sick.

24
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,439
He told me to go fishing.

25
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:17,480
What do you mean?

26
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,599
I didn't expect

27
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,159
to catch a big one.

28
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,359
According to my investigation,

29
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:24,159
Lin Xiang, ever since his school days,

30
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,439
has been using the pretense of scouting models

31
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,599
to deceive many girls.

32
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,239
Models?

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:32,799
Yes.

34
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,680
Don't be shocked just yet.

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,920
This is just the appetizer.

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,719
The Lin Group

37
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,159
has been wanting to expand into online business for years.

38
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,439
Lin Xiang happens to be in charge of that.

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,959
So for all these years,

40
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,920
openly and covertly,

41
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,640
he's been relentlessly sabotaging Four Seas.

42
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,120
This time, the fake live streaming data

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,519
is definitely connected to him.

44
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,920
So,

45
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,400
he got close to me

46
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:57,040
in order to...

47
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,159
What do you think?

48
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,439
Did your brother ask you to investigate this?

49
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,280
My brother was frantic with worry.

50
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,000
Old Qian!

51
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,639
Old Qian!

52
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,039
What's your problem?

53
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,960
No matter what,

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,680
we've been friends for decades.

55
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,479
The kids are just dating,

56
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,280
and you're putting on airs with me?

57
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,360
Right?

58
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,639
The young couple had a fight.

59
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,919
It's fine.

60
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,800
Don't worry.

61
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,479
Young people's matters

62
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,000
should be left for them to sort out.

63
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:37,919
No problem.

64
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,719
My daughter is currently in Turkey.

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,400
How could she be dating?

66
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:42,800
Let's go.

67
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
Turkey?

68
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,120
Then who is dating my son?

69
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,719
You brat!

70
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:57,960
How dare you trick me!

71
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:02,719
Dad!

72
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,840
Mom!

73
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,159
What are you doing here?

74
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,439
You two...

75
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,919
When are you planning to get the marriage certificate?

76
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,520
Is that all?

77
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,800
You didn't have to come all this way.

78
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,120
We...

79
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,240
plan to get it next month.

80
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,479
Getting it next month, huh?

81
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,120
That's fine too.

82
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,080
Then I'll

83
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,439
book the banquet first.

84
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,560
Two hundred tables.

85
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,960
Dad, there's no need to rush.

86
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,599
Not in a rush, you say?

87
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:46,599
Alright then.

88
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,560
We'll wait until you secure your inheritance rights.

89
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,199
Okay?

90
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:49,840
Right.

91
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:50,800
Nonsense!

92
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,280
I almost fell for your trick, you rascal!

93
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,680
I'm sorry, Uncle.

94
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,120
This whole thing...

95
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,240
it's all my fault.

96
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:06,560
Dad,

97
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,280
I planned this all by myself.

98
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,319
Don't blame Xin Tong.

99
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,319
No.

100
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,680
This matter

101
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,759
has nothing to do with him.

102
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,120
It's not your fault.

103
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,040
It was me.

104
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,639
It was me

105
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,000
who fell for Wen Pei'an first.

106
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,759
Qian Kexin and I are good friends.

107
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,519
That day, she asked me for a favor.

108
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,160
To go on a blind date in her place.

109
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,160
But when I got there,

110
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,879
and met Wen Pei'an,

111
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,399
the two of us just...

112
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,680
fell in love at first sight.

113
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:51,720
But,

114
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,560
because my family background isn't good,

115
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,759
I was afraid our backgrounds were incompatible.

116
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,079
Pei'an

117
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,720
was also afraid

118
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,240
you two would be disappointed.

119
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,600
He was very worried about your health.

120
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,920
So, I took it upon myself

121
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,000
to come up with this bad idea.

122
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,480
I'm sorry.

123
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,720
You say you've always liked my son.

124
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,399
What exactly do you like about him?

125
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,360
Yeah.

126
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,079
What do you like about him?

127
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,279
His money?

128
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,040
Tell us.

129
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,879
I like...

130
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,519
What I like

131
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,279
is the Wen Pei'an right in front of me.

132
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,879
In other people's eyes,

133
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,319
he might be a CEO.

134
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,199
In your eyes,

135
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,920
he's a very unique child.

136
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,879
But in my eyes,

137
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,800
I think he's a

138
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,800
very adorable big boy.

139
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,160
He's always so concerned about me.

140
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,879
Concerned about my work,

141
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,319
concerned about my life,

142
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,319
concerned about

143
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,319
all my

144
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,560
tiny, insignificant little wishes.

145
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,360
So I feel

146
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,319
that to me,

147
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,519
he's not just

148
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,240
a good friend.

149
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,240
He's a wonderful partner.

150
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:13,120
Sometimes, just seeing him

151
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,759
makes me so happy.

152
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,319
When he's by my side,

153
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,800
it makes me feel

154
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,519
very secure

155
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,279
and very safe.

156
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,160
So,

157
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,839
I truly, really like him.

158
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,240
I'm really sorry.

159
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,399
Uncle, Auntie.

160
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,600
We were just

161
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,199
too afraid of disappointing you.

162
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,720
That's why I pretended to be Qian Kexin.

163
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,399
I really didn't want to lie to you.

164
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,480
But I really had no way

165
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,759
to control myself.

166
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,120
To control

167
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,000
myself from liking him.

168
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,439
What are you looking at?

169
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,240
I told you not to come, not to come!

170
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,240
But you insisted on coming.

171
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,920
You old man!

172
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,120
You're so old,

173
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,439
worrying about useless things all day.

174
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,399
I was just

175
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,920
worried about our son!

176
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,120
Xiao Xin,

177
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:17,839
let me tell you something.

178
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,519
"Incompatible backgrounds"

179
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,279
doesn't count in our Wen family.

180
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,000
It's not a thing.

181
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,639
Back in the day,

182
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
your uncle here,

183
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,079
was considered a famous

184
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:30,079
rich heir in Jiangcheng.

185
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,160
My marriage with your aunt

186
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,680
was a love marriage!

187
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,399
What I valued

188
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,480
was character.

189
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:38,480
Right?

190
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:41,399
Your aunt

191
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,560
is also very beautiful,

192
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,759
very capable,

193
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,800
and has a great figure.

194
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:45,560
Right?

195
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,800
That's more like it.

196
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:49,800
Uncle,

197
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,480
you've always been my idol.

198
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,920
Pei'an always says

199
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,360
he hopes to

200
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,759
become an outstanding entrepreneur like you.

201
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,560
Right?

202
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:03,800
Yes.

203
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,800
Good, good.

204
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:06,600
Alright, alright.

205
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,160
It's getting late.

206
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,000
Your father and I

207
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,879
should head back.

208
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,040
Yes, yes, yes.

209
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:12,959
Your dad saw Old Qian today,

210
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,120
and got so angry,

211
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,680
he didn't even eat.

212
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,399
He dragged me here.

213
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:18,560
Let's go.

214
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,759
Uncle, Auntie,

215
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,240
since that's the case,

216
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,319
why don't you stay

217
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:22,959
for dinner?

218
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,560
Or better yet, don't leave tonight.

219
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
Stay here directly.

220
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,199
I'll cook you both a delicious meal.

221
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,600
I'm a great cook.

222
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,120
Right?

223
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,160
See?

224
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,279
A daughter

225
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,440
is better than a son.

226
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,039
Why did you have to make them stay?

227
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,960
The Chairman is my bread and butter.

228
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,279
Of course I have to be nice to him.

229
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,039
What kind of food do Mom and Dad like?

230
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,159
Cantonese food.

231
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,600
Learning on the spot again?

232
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,480
What else?

233
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,919
I forgot to ask you.

234
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,759
How was my

235
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
performance just now?

236
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,360
Come on, come on.

237
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:06,919
Let's

238
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,519
have a drink.

239
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,200
Okay.

240
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,440
You've worked hard.

241
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,240
Not at all.

242
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm so happy today.

243
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,120
Slow down, slow down.

244
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,799
Uncle,

245
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,720
let me toast you again.

246
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:19,559
Okay, okay, okay.

247
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,360
Bottoms up!

248
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:21,919
Okay.

249
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,519
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

250
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,600
Let me pour you some more.

251
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,600
Okay, okay, okay.

252
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,360
Dad

253
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,000
Mom

254
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,039
I'm going to bed first.

255
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:38,360
Alright.

256
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:39,240
Go to sleep.

257
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,399
And Xin Tong,

258
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,399
you should go rest early too.

259
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,240
Son,

260
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,120
take Xin Tong with you.

261
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,519
Let her rest too.

262
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,240
Mom...

263
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,360
Then we'll go rest now.

264
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,159
Go on, go on.

265
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,440
Let's go.

266
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,559
Young people just need a good sleep,

267
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:58,279
and they'll be fine.

268
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,240
I can still keep drinking.

269
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,360
Son,

270
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:52,799
are you asleep?

271
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,120
Mom.

272
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,120
I made a bowl of hangover soup.

273
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,960
When Xin Tong wakes up,

274
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,279
give it to her to drink.

275
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,240
Thanks, Mom.

276
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:03,960
You should rest early too.

277
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,759
I'll just leave it here then.

278
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,919
Alright.

279
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,559
Now the performance is successfully over.

280
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,159
Remember to pay me my wages.

281
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:16,960
Double.

282
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,360
Was she drunk,

283
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:26,759
or was she not drunk?

284
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,399
Was it a dream,

285
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,720
or was she sober?

286
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,799
Three.

287
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,639
She's so carefree,

288
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,440
she definitely doesn't remember what happened yesterday.

289
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,360
Four.

290
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,039
How did we end up kissing?

291
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,399
Focus on the exercise.

292
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,240
Don't think about it.

293
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,080
How did we kiss...
