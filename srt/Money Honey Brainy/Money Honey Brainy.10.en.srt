1
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,320
The Operations Department

2
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,280
Has the new host proposal been sent over?

3
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,960
Is Qixing in it?

4
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,320
It absolutely cannot be her.

5
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,240
Of course.

6
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,280
And also,

7
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,479
if Qixing tries to pry information from you,

8
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,039
you must not tell her

9
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:04,599
about the relationship between me and Xin Tong.

10
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:05,439
President.

11
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,200
President!

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,799
Xin Tong!

13
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,760
Why are you so reckless?

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Why didn't you knock?

15
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,159
Coffee should be brewed like this.

16
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:14,959
Do you understand?

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,359
Don't make me teach you a second time.

18
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,640
Why didn't you knock?

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,599
Why didn't you knock?

20
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,159
I'm in a hurry!

21
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,480
I'm really sorry.

22
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:24,439
Um,

23
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,879
about the new host proposal...

24
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:26,480
I've seen it.

25
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,400
That's exactly what I came to talk about.

26
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,159
Our company

27
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,879
is about to launch a new live room, right?

28
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,879
The synonym for the live room is

29
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:33,480
"vitality".

30
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,680
Plus "independent woman".

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,640
I think

32
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,640
based on these points,

33
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:37,519
Qixing

34
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,719
is the most suitable.

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,200
But why was Qixing rejected?

36
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,159
Rejecting her...

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,920
I think Qixing

38
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,519
is completely

39
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,159
unsuitable.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,959
What do you know?

41
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:54,400
Has Xin Tong lost her mind?

42
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,519
From what I understand,

43
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,400
Qixing comes from a very privileged background.

44
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,480
But all these years,

45
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,519
she has never relied on her family's resources.

46
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,879
Through step-by-step effort,

47
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,040
she became today's top streamer.

48
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,120
You can't simply label her

49
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,879
as just a streamer or an internet celebrity.

50
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,280
I think

51
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,280
Qixing is the most representative

52
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,599
modern woman.

53
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,240
I've said it before.

54
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,919
Qixing is not suitable.

55
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,560
Let's consider

56
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,560
other host candidates.

57
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:23,800
Fine.

58
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,240
Let me ask you.

59
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,199
I...

60
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:29,599
Yes.

61
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,520
I'm asking you.

62
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,759
Genuine,

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,560
independent,

64
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,000
highly approachable,

65
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,800
and also very cute.

66
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,960
Are there many streamers like that?

67
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,599
Popular for years,

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,360
no scandals,

69
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,199
no negative reviews.

70
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,000
Are there many streamers like that?

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,039
Live-stream sales

72
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,879
consistently rank in the top ten.

73
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,599
Are there many streamers like that?

74
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,599
No, not many.

75
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,400
But...

76
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,439
No "buts".

77
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,000
The answer is obvious.

78
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,840
Qixing

79
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,960
is absolutely the best candidate

80
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,439
for our Sihai Vitality Live Room.

81
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,479
Xin Tong's suggestion is debatable.

82
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,840
Don't you think?

83
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:08,919
All of these

84
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,240
are just a persona.

85
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:11,240
Right.

86
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,800
Do you really know her?

87
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,000
Of course I know her!

88
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,520
Boss...

89
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:14,919
Enough!

90
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:15,360
I think...

91
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,960
Has the secretary also gone crazy lately?

92
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't care what you think.

93
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,919
I care what I think.

94
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,360
Within three days,

95
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,759
present a new host proposal.

96
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:28,719
That's it.

97
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:29,680
Meeting adjourned.

98
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,319
Xin Tong.

99
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,080
Don't be angry.

100
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,919
Xin Tong also has the company's best interests at heart.

101
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:49,800
Oulu.

102
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,280
Speak.

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,520
Sorry,

104
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,560
I was engrossed.

105
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,120
Qixing said she wants to see me.

106
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,599
Can you go check on her for me?

107
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,199
What trick is she trying to pull now?

108
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,800
The president's secretary has been getting a bit too cocky lately.

109
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,319
But you're even more so.

110
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,319
I told you it wouldn't work, didn't I?

111
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,040
You...

112
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,519
are just stubborn.

113
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,680
There are plenty of streamers who want to sign with us right now.

114
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,720
Why are you so fixated on Qixing?

115
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,399
Yeah.

116
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,759
I'm begging you,

117
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,399
let Qixing go, and let me go too.

118
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,120
Okay?

119
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,439
Right now, I only have one thought.

120
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,279
It's to tie that Galileo

121
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,680
to a Roman column and burn him alive.

122
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:36,920
Let me show you a clear path.

123
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,879
You

124
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,160
should jump ship and go work for Qixing.

125
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,040
And besides,

126
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,839
it was Bruno who was burned at the stake.

127
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,959
Calm down.

128
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,360
This Galileo

129
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,000
Has such poor taste.

130
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,639
I refuse to believe it.

131
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,120
Rico

132
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,720
Can't handle it.

133
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,120
I know why

134
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,040
The President rejected your proposal.

135
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:08,959
Why?

136
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,399
I'll tell you a secret.

137
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,879
You must swear to me on staying single forever

138
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:17,319
That you'll never tell a third person.

139
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,800
I swear to you on eight lifetimes of being single,

140
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,680
I will absolutely not tell a third person.

141
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,879
What is it?

142
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,079
Qixing

143
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,639
Is Galileo's

144
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,240
Twin sister.

145
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,839
Darn it.

146
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,800
But those two don't look alike at all.

147
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,000
Twins can be identical or fraternal, right?

148
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,240
You have a point.

149
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,720
Then, if that's the case,

150
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,439
Siblings working together

151
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,680
Should be smoother, shouldn't it?

152
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,600
The world of the rich

153
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,800
Is a deep sea.

154
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,000
Originally,

155
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,680
Family businesses pass to sons, not daughters.

156
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,439
But the younger sister, Qixing,

157
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,600
Through her own efforts,

158
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,079
Carved out her own territory.

159
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,399
Making the Chairman

160
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,800
Look at her in a new light.

161
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,759
I understand.

162
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,839
You mean to say

163
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,360
These two siblings

164
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,199
Are competing for the Four Seas inheritance.

165
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,439
The more that's the case,

166
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,439
The more we can't let that darn bastard succeed.

167
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,199
With his limited vision and ability,

168
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,519
How can he compare to Qixing?

169
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,759
I will help the Princess Heir ascend the throne.

170
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:29,759
Stella,

171
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,360
How do you know so much?

172
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,399
Because

173
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,920
The old President

174
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,879
Is my great-uncle.

175
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,000
It really is a family business.

176
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,759
Hello, Qixing.

177
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,600
Sorry to bother you.

178
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,079
I'm a huge fan of yours.

179
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:53,720
This

180
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,000
Is a gift I prepared for you.

181
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,079
Do you want an autograph?

182
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:57,959
That's right,

183
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:58,920
but

184
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,120
I want you to sign this.

185
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:02,319
Hello.

186
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,279
Let me introduce myself.

187
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:05,720
I'm Xin Tong, an Operations Specialist at Four Seas Group.

188
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,199
Four Seas?

189
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,160
I'm being very presumptuous by coming here,

190
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,480
But I wanted to invite you

191
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,959
To be a guest on our Four Seas food live stream.

192
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,920
I don't know

193
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,000
What your thoughts are.

194
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,319
You must be acting on your own initiative, right?

195
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,439
Why would Four Seas invite me as a guest?

196
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:22,800
To be honest with you,

197
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,600
This proposal

198
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,480
Was indeed drafted on my own initiative.

199
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,759
You can take a look first.

200
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,319
If you are inclined to agree,

201
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,480
Then I can try to persuade the company.

202
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:32,480
No need.

203
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,199
Thank you for your kindness.

204
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,560
I don't want to go to Four Seas

205
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,439
As a guest.

206
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,680
I understand.

207
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:40,639
I, as

208
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,199
A 0.01 percent

209
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,360
Minor shareholder of Four Seas,

210
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,800
Would like to express to you

211
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,000
That between you

212
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,600
And the current President,

213
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,759
I have more faith in you.

214
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,519
I hope even more

215
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,720
That you can become

216
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,480
The future helmsman of our Four Seas.

217
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,720
Well, seeing how sincere you are,

218
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,079
I'll take a look at the contract first.

219
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:58,879
Okay.

220
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,480
Take a look.

221
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,319
Wen Pei'an?

222
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,720
Why is he on Qixing's phone?

223
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,399
And it's an intimate photo of the two of them.

224
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,560
Qixing

225
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,720
Was once rumored to be in a relationship.

226
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,399
The other person's identity was shrouded in mystery.

227
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,399
Could that person

228
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,920
Be Wen Pei'an?

229
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,000
Wen Pei'an dumped Qixing,

230
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,439
And Qixing can't get over him.

231
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,399
This

232
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,720
Is the opening.

233
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,600
The proposal is well-written,

234
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,840
But I'm sorry.

235
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,639
I'm not considering going to Four Seas right now.

236
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,399
That's okay.

237
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,879
I'd like to ask presumptuously,

238
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,399
What is your relationship with the person on your phone wallpaper?

239
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,399
What?

240
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,000
You

241
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,720
Don't know about our relationship?

242
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,960
Ex-boyfriend.

243
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,120
We broke up.

244
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,720
Haven't changed the wallpaper yet.

245
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:09,559
That means

246
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,600
You still have feelings for him.

247
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,559
In that case,

248
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,120
I think

249
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,519
I can try to help you repair

250
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,679
The relationship between you two.

251
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,000
If you need it.

252
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,440
Then what's your relationship with him?

253
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,559
I'm his

254
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,759
Business partner.

255
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,679
Are you confident you can do that?

256
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,480
Where there's a will, there's a way.

257
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,679
I believe no boy

258
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,240
Could refuse

259
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,080
A girl as outstanding as you.

260
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:39,200
Sign.

261
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,840
Sorry, sorry.

262
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:48,799
Thank you.

263
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,799
Pleasure doing business.

264
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,120
Pleasure doing business.

265
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,440
I'm also one of Xing's Stars.

266
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,159
What kind of cooperation?

267
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,320
Ga

268
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,559
Boss

269
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,440
What were you guys just talking about?

270
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,600
I didn't catch it.

271
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:09,039
That bastard must have predicted my prediction.

272
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,480
He deliberately beat me to it.

273
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,000
Trying to sabotage our cooperation.

274
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,159
As for me,

275
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,279
I represent all of Xing's Stars

276
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,600
to check on Qixing's

277
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:19,559
boss.

278
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,639
Why are you here too?

279
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,000
The President's affairs

280
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,600
are none of your business.

281
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,919
If there's nothing else,

282
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:25,840
please leave now.

283
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,360
Fine.

284
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,399
Then I won't keep you siblings from catching up.

285
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:30,840
Okay.

286
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,120
Successfully fired

287
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,000
Qixing's first shot to take over Four Seas.

288
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,320
Goodbye, Boss.

289
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,879
This Xin Tong,

290
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,960
is the one you told me about before, right?

291
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,720
Wen Pei'an's fake girlfriend.

292
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,799
Yeah.

293
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:45,799
I didn't expect

294
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:46,559
her to be so persistent.

295
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:47,919
Dad said

296
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,919
as long as Wen Pei'an is in a relationship,

297
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,639
then

298
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,840
he can take over Four Seas.

299
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,240
So he found Xin Tong

300
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,360
to be his girlfriend.

301
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,240
But

302
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,080
what's unexpected is

303
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,000
Xin Tong now works at Four Seas.

304
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,360
And she's always believed

305
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,440
that I am the President

306
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,240
and your brother

307
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,279
is the assistant.

308
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:03,639
So,

309
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,480
is that clear enough for you?

310
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,840
I understood, but also kind of didn't.

311
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,600
I just think

312
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,799
they actually seem quite well-matched.

313
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,039
So,

314
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,440
are you really coming

315
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,279
as a guest?

316
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,600
Not only am I going as a guest,

317
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,879
I'm also going to have her repair

318
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,720
the relationship between me and Wen Pei'an.

319
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:26,639
What do you mean?

320
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,919
She thinks I'm Wen Pei'an's ex-girlfriend.

321
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,000
No way.

322
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,080
What?

323
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,279
Are you angry?

324
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,600
The situation is already chaotic enough.

325
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,960
And you want to add fuel to the fire?

326
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,960
Don't be mad.

327
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,399
Why so fierce?

328
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,679
It's been so long since you've seen me.

329
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,080
Kiss me.

330
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:55,080
My brother still doesn't know about our relationship, right?

331
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,960
Right now, in his eyes,

332
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,480
there's only his company and himself.

333
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,320
And Xin Tong.

334
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:01,360
I'm like

335
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,879
invisible, like air.

336
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:03,759
I'm really looking forward

337
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,759
to his reaction when he finds out we're together.

338
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,519
No.

339
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,720
I'm not looking forward to it.

340
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,360
If he finds out,

341
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:10,720
he'll definitely go crazy.

342
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,919
"Even an 'ugly' husband has to meet his brother-in-law."

343
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:17,840
Let the storm

344
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,120
rage even more fiercely.

345
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,159
Go, go!
