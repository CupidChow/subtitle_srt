1
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:36,520
This is

2
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,359
Lin Meiyi.

3
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:39,000
Founder of Colorful Tea Drinks.

4
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:39,759
And this is

5
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,520
Wen Pei'an,

6
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:42,079
the CEO of our Four Seas Group.

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,920
You give off a vibe

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,799
that's quite different.

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,920
Just from hearing your name,

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,759
I thought

11
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:48,840
you'd be the mature, steady type like my dad.

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,560
I absolutely love your company's

13
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,920
Boji Boji Softy Chewy

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,039
Mango Ice Blast.

15
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:53,759
You two chat first.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,719
I need to make a call.

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,320
If you leave, who'll take the meeting minutes?

18
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,000
We still need

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,119
meeting minutes?

20
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:00,079
Yes.

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,039
Is that a problem?

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,799
I have a voice recorder here.

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,120
You two go ahead.

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,519
Thanks.

25
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:12,359
Hello?

26
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:12,920
Chairman.

27
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,359
The blind date has started.

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,840
Good.

29
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,200
I strongly suspect Wen Pei'an

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,040
is putting on an act for me.

31
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:20,519
Uncle,

32
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,959
Pei'an wouldn't dare do that.

33
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,000
Are you both in on this, trying to fool me?

34
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,200
I swear to heaven,

35
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,519
Pei'an really is dating someone.

36
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,120
Alright then.

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,599
Go set up a little test for me.

38
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,359
I want to see their genuine reactions.

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,480
Right now, you can invite Kexin

40
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,359
to the cafe.

41
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:38,680
Won't that cause trouble?

42
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,200
Exactly.

43
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,680
We need to stir things up a bit.

44
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,159
I heard

45
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:49,239
you've never been in a relationship, is that right?

46
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,439
What's your zodiac sign?

47
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,640
Does that

48
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,000
affect our potential cooperation?

49
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,680
Actually,

50
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,719
I'm just looking for someone

51
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:59,680
with a deep soul connection.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,120
My philosophy is freedom and openness.

53
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,439
If my needs are adequately met,

54
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,840
I will definitely cast a wide net

55
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,120
to establish more partnerships.

56
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,599
Both sides

57
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:09,840
can benefit.

58
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,159
Why wouldn't we do that?

59
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,080
Vigorous,

60
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:12,759
upward,

61
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,479
innovative,

62
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,199
and striving.

63
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,400
Innovative...

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,759
What does that mean?

65
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,439
Boldly discard the old,

66
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,599
embrace the new with open arms.

67
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,919
So, you love the new and loathe the old.

68
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,000
We are both

69
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,639
free.

70
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,879
Thank you for your honesty.

71
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,840
Thank you for your...

72
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,479
praise.

73
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,800
That wasn't praise.

74
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:35,879
Are you okay?

75
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,159
You...

76
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,159
Stay away from me.

77
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,080
I think our values don't align.

78
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,639
Let's not meet again in the future.

79
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,560
What kind of clients did you find today?

80
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,560
Is it them who have a problem, or is it you?

81
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,560
These

82
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,759
are just the unique

83
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,400
social methods

84
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,479
of modern young entrepreneurs.

85
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,479
You should update your negotiation style too.

86
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,400
Who starts talking business

87
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,560
right off the bat nowadays?

88
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,639
Hello.

89
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,639
Pashley.

90
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,560
Let me introduce you.

91
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,639
This is Wen Pei'an,

92
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,039
the CEO of our Four Seas Group.

93
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,360
This is Pashley,

94
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,080
a guest from afar in Canton City.

95
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,240
Her mother is

96
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,599
the founder of Ai Po.

97
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,240
Hello,

98
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,240
Miss Pashley.

99
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,879
Hello, Wen Pei'an.

100
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,280
I think

101
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,560
you're even more handsome in person.

102
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,599
And your muscles feel very firm too.

103
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,719
Do you work out?

104
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:24,240
It seems there's an officer outside giving tickets.

105
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,599
I need to go handle that first.

106
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,520
Officer?

107
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,319
I'm already here.

108
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,400
Where are you?

109
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,360
Target is in sight.

110
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,240
I have a question.

111
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,039
Go ahead.

112
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,639
If you were to travel,

113
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,840
where would you like to go?

114
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,039
As for me,

115
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,280
I prefer going to Australia.

116
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,199
The Gold Coast there

117
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,360
is very beautiful.

118
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,280
Many people don't wear clothes there, you know.

119
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,800
Only people confident in their bodies

120
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,080
go to that beach.

121
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,400
I think

122
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,120
you

123
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,319
would fit right in.

124
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,360
He's actually on a date.

125
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:10,280
Wait, no.

126
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,039
We're a fake couple.

127
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,639
Why am I getting a bit into the role?

128
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,039
Snap out of it!

129
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,720
What's going on here?

130
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,000
I see.

131
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,480
He asked me here to put on a show.

132
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:37,480
Hello

133
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,160
Darling

134
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,480
Sorry

135
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,120
I'm late

136
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,759
Who is this young lady?

137
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:42,920
What are you doing here?

138
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,519
I came here specifically to see you

139
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:47,920
You are?

140
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,600
I'm his girlfriend

141
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,519
I'm discussing business with a client

142
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,680
Watch your words

143
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,839
Client?

144
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,319
Who's the client?

145
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,000
You

146
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,160
Aren't you here to discuss brand entry?

147
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,680
I'm here for a blind date

148
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,560
Why is there background music on this livestream?

149
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,319
To enhance the show's effect

150
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,279
I specifically added music to the livestream

151
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,959
Blind date?

152
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,199
You

153
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,959
actually went behind my back

154
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,519
and here

155
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,480
had a blind date with another girl?

156
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,519
I didn't

157
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,319
Then what do you take me for?

158
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,120
Scumbag!

159
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,439
Scumbag!

160
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,839
Feeling sorry for the young master for three seconds

161
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,319
This soap opera plot

162
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,759
definitely doesn't seem fake

163
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,800
So fierce!

164
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,680
That slap was well-deserved

165
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,079
As expected, handsome men

166
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,519
with good figures and lots of money

167
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,399
are all no good

168
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,519
Sis

169
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,319
Let me tell you

170
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,000
I would never be the other woman

171
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,600
Explain

172
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,600
what's going on

173
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,160
What are you doing?

174
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,560
What are you doing?

175
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,160
What am I doing?

176
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,720
You come here

177
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,439
I

178
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,360
Didn't you ask me to come here?

179
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,560
When did I ask you?

180
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,040
I advise you to keep your movements subtle

181
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,079
A lot of people are watching

182
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,720
Impossible to guard against

183
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,000
Could it be

184
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,519
you had no idea

185
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:44,680
you were having a blind date here with another girl today?

186
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,759
And wearing the same clothes from our first meeting

187
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,600
I didn't know

188
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,680
Then you really should think hard

189
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,839
about why all this happened today

190
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,040
I'm really angry

191
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,759
The consequences will be severe

192
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,639
Paisley left

193
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:12,839
She's gone

194
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:17,959
Ou Lu

195
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,519
Explain to me

196
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,319
what exactly happened today

197
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:25,800
It's just

198
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,079
I arranged for you to meet some

199
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,600
guests who are important to the company

200
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,160
Important guests, huh?

201
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,199
I'll give you one more chance

202
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,680
Speak properly

203
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,600
It was arranged by the Chairman

204
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,120
I'm serving two masters

205
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,959
Please don't betray me

206
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,000
If you set me up on another blind date

207
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,319
tomorrow you'll go to the livestream room

208
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,040
and shout-rap, headbang, and rave for me

209
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,800
Also

210
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,639
All of today's meeting minutes

211
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,800
email them to me tonight

212
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,800
I'll do anything you want

213
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,680
Just don't betray me

214
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,079
Ou Lu told me everything

215
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,879
Didn't we agree you wouldn't betray me?

216
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,680
Dad

217
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,959
If you don't trust me

218
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,319
you could have confronted me directly

219
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,319
Why resort to these underhanded tricks?

220
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:24,920
Alright

221
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:28,439
I apologize

222
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,319
for my previous rash actions

223
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:30,639
Ou Lu

224
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:31,920
volunteered

225
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,120
to help prove your case

226
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,320
He's not at fault

227
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:38,679
When did I volunteer?

228
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,279
So the fault is mine then?

229
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:40,799
No

230
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,279
You're not at fault either

231
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,039
The mistake was

232
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:45,960
you finding out

233
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:47,679
Otherwise

234
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,600
it would have been a perfect plan

235
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:52,639
Alright, alright

236
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,799
Tomorrow is a good day

237
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,559
Your father and I

238
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:58,440
both want to meet this future daughter-in-law

239
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,039
Invite her over

240
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,080
for a meal, okay?

241
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,360
What?

242
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,600
A family dinner?

243
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:06,799
I'm not going
