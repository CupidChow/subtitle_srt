1
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:39,200
So what do you plan to do?

2
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:45,920
First,

3
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,640
I feel

4
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:49,119
very sorry.

5
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:50,439
I also feel

6
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,079
very regretful.

7
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,759
I swear I really am

8
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:55,640
doing this for the first time.

9
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,600
So I...

10
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:58,719
I...

11
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:00,479
I...

12
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,920
I don't seem to have done anything to you, right?

13
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,239
On the contrary, it was you

14
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,200
who, at the hotel,

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,719
was getting

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,120
all touchy-feely with me.

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,719
I wonder, if the Qian family knew

18
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,200
about you helping them with the blind date,

19
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,319
what would they think?

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,640
I'll give you two choices.

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:16,799
First,

22
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:19,120
pack up immediately and leave my house.

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,879
I will also tell

24
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,000
Qian Kexin's parents everything without reservation.

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,079
You...

26
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:26,239
living in such a big house,

27
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,239
how can you be

28
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,280
so petty?

29
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,200
And you'd tattle?

30
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,120
Second,

31
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,560
you can stop doing part-time jobs,

32
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:33,959
continue impersonating Qian Kexin,

33
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:35,319
and be my partner.

34
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,280
I can pretend

35
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,879
that nothing happened today.

36
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,959
Be your partner?

37
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,400
You didn't look like you were acting during the day.

38
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,599
You are just a Scumbag.

39
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,359
I'm talking about a Contractual Couple.

40
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,640
A fake couple for outsiders to see.

41
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,799
You have ten seconds to consider.

42
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,120
Ten.

43
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,359
Nine.

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,640
Eight.

45
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,959
Pretending to be a couple...

46
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,920
it's just eating meals and watching movies, right?

47
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,359
At most, holding hands.

48
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,000
This Little Siwen looks like

49
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,680
his financial condition shouldn't be bad.

50
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,199
In that case,

51
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,280
wouldn't that bring my

52
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,319
plan to retire at thirty-six

53
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,199
one step closer?

54
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,280
But this person,

55
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,159
he wouldn't have bad intentions towards me, right?

56
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,840
Judging from physiognomy,

57
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,759
he looks okay.

58
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,520
He doesn't look like a bad guy.

59
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,680
This deal,

60
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,159
no matter how I calculate,

61
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,159
is worth it.

62
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,360
Three.

63
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:33,759
Two.

64
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:34,960
One.

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,039
I...

66
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,439
choose the second one.

67
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,439
Everything is under my control.

68
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,360
I don't want to have you forever.

69
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:45,439
I just want to possess you briefly.

70
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,840
You possessing me briefly

71
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,400
will only make me hate you forever.

72
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,680
As long as you don't forget me,

73
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,960
then hate me to your heart's content.

74
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,000
Dad,

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,039
can't you see I'm busy?

76
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,199
We can never be together.

77
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,000
Love isn't something you can buy,

78
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,840
just because you want to.

79
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,719
I just want you to

80
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,319
be my fake wife.

81
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,360
With my current ability,

82
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,400
do you think I'm not competent enough?

83
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:11,280
Managing Four Seas.

84
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,960
Kid,

85
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,199
want to manage Four Seas?

86
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:18,360
Fine.

87
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,560
No problem.

88
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,080
I still have that requirement.

89
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,199
If you don't go on the blind date,

90
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,479
then I will let Four Seas

91
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,360
rot in my hands.

92
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,560
Are you just so at ease

93
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,159
letting the industry Grandpa built

94
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,400
be destroyed in your hands?

95
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,280
As a rich heir

96
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,599
can't you have some ambition?

97
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,800
I'm guarding this family business.

98
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,479
Do you think it's easy for me?

99
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,080
Haven't you seen

100
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,680
how many companies have gone bankrupt now?

101
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,240
Alright, alright.

102
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:41,800
Fine.

103
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,199
Okay.

104
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,439
I just want you

105
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,080
to be my fake wife.

106
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,240
Right?

107
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,680
So if I succeed in the blind date, I can take over the company?

108
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,400
That's right.

109
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,240
Deal.

110
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,439
Then I demand to have the blind date immediately.

111
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:02,840
Really?

112
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,639
This Contractual Couple cooperation lasts for three months.

113
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,879
Party B needs to

114
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,439
have regular dates with Party A,

115
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,000
meet Party A's parents,

116
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:13,879
and

117
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,000
act like a couple in public.

118
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,160
No problem, right?

119
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,800
Okay.

120
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,800
Based on your requirements,

121
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,959
we have also prepared a revised Quotation.

122
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,319
It stipulates

123
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,319
date frequency, duration, and intimacy level.

124
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,120
Fifteen dates are too few.

125
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,319
At least thirty times.

126
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,639
The intimacy level grading is also somewhat vague.

127
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,160
Give a brief overview.

128
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,800
Alright.

129
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,199
Then twenty times.

130
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,000
Each not exceeding one hour.

131
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,160
Intimacy levels are divided into three grades:

132
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,759
namely,

133
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,240
S-level,

134
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:39,720
Level A,

135
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,199
and B-level.

136
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,480
S-level includes

137
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,639
close-up eye contact,

138
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,560
hugging,

139
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,839
and kissing on the face.

140
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,879
Among these, close-up eye contact

141
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:47,879
and hugging

142
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,079
are charged by the second.

143
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,000
Kissing on the face

144
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,040
is charged per occurrence.

145
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,040
Level A includes things like holding hands and waist-hugging.

146
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,240
It's calculated as

147
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,639
thirty percent of the date duration.

148
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,480
The remaining B-level is simple:

149
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:01,079
just some daily physical contact.

150
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,920
Unlimited times.

151
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,240
I want to change the number of dates to twenty-five.

152
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,800
Duration not exceeding two hours.

153
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,079
Also, the close-up eye contact clause

154
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,480
should be in B-level.

155
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
Putting it in S-level

156
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,279
is too demanding.

157
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:14,519
Not allowed.

158
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,480
According to psychological calculations,

159
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,279
if a man and woman date over twenty times,

160
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,600
there's a high chance they'll fall in love.

161
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,240
Prolonged eye contact

162
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,480
for over thirty seconds

163
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,160
could also lead to falling for each other.

164
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,639
So it must be S-level.

165
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,279
Falling in love

166
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,319
is caused by one party being unprofessional.

167
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,439
This clause is invalid.

168
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,759
Make it twenty-five times.

169
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,079
Okay.

170
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,720
Then let's look at

171
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,079
the other billing standards.

172
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,759
All dating expenses are borne by Party A.

173
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:41,600
This includes

174
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,160
clothing fees,

175
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,759
makeup fees,

176
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,439
taxi fares,

177
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,360
and loss of wages compensation.

178
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,639
Party B must not be in a relationship during the cooperation.

179
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,439
Otherwise,

180
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,680
the contract terminates.

181
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,839
Both parties must not interfere with each other's privacy.

182
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:53,839
They must ensure the other's complete independent personality.

183
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:56,199
They must not harbor any intentions towards each other.

184
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,519
After the cooperation ends,

185
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,920
they break up peacefully

186
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,759
and never interact again.

187
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,519
Deal.

188
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,639
Pleasure doing business.

189
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,800
Good morning, Stella.

190
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,399
Morning.

191
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,439
What happened to you?

192
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,839
The new CEO hasn't even started

193
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,160
and already assigned us tasks.

194
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Compile the shipment report for the first half of the year.

195
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,639
I didn't sleep all night.

196
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,199
It's like not seeing the person,

197
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,920
but smelling their... output first. (Darn!)

198
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,879
Why didn't I receive any work tasks?

199
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,759
Did you not check your email?

200
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:43,720
Email?

201
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,879
That long-sealed,

202
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,279
antique work email?

203
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,639
Is he in artifact excavation?

204
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:52,600
So this is the legendary flat management.

205
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,040
Any employee

206
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,519
can email the CEO directly.

207
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,120
He really has quite the personality.

208
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,519
There's an email from Galileo.

209
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,480
Ga-li-le-o.

210
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,120
Listen to that name.

211
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,120
No way.

212
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,439
He

213
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,079
wants all these things

214
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,879
all delivered today?

215
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:13,680
Yeah.

216
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,480
My main job

217
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,399
is Live-streaming Operations for Four Seas Group.

218
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,279
To put it simply,

219
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,279
it's selecting suitable products for the live stream,

220
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,319
proposing operational strategies,

221
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,800
and finding reliable suppliers to work with.

222
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:13,399
Oulu

223
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,480
Is that plush toy keychain ready?

224
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,720
Just leave the takeout on the cabinet by the door.

225
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,040
I see you.

226
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,399
This guy is so handsome too.

227
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,240
Morning.

228
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,000
Morning.

229
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,240
Director.

230
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,040
Met the new president?

231
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,800
Of course.

232
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,639
The new president's face...

233
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,919
is so refined.

234
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,840
He looks absolutely...

235
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,360
like a peerless gentleman.

236
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,399
I'd like to ask a very presumptuous question.

237
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,840
What would you and his child...

238
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,320
be named?

239
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,159
Then call it...

240
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,960
Kepler.

241
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,759
I specifically brought a magazine with his photo.

242
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,440
My president...

243
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,960
What is this?

244
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,840
This isn't your drool, is it?

245
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,840
My coffee...

246
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,200
Just picture his face yourself.

247
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,879
Did you see the new proposal I sent you?

248
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,840
I think before we figure out his style,

249
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,559
we should still...

250
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:06,399
play it safe.

251
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,200
Okay?

252
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,559
Right now, I...

253
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,879
just hope his judgment is a bit better.

254
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:16,440
Don't let me be...

255
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,440
disappointed in this third-generation rich heir.

256
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,120
Here you go.

257
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,360
Dad.

258
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,960
Your blind date went well yesterday, huh?

259
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,399
Love at first sight.

260
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:28,240
Look at me.

261
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,720
Okay.

262
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,039
Okay.

263
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,000
That puts my mind at ease.

264
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,519
From now on,

265
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,480
you only need to do two things.

266
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:41,639
First,

267
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:42,639
work hard.

268
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:43,679
Second,

269
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,399
date seriously.

270
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,240
Okay.

271
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,240
Then get back to work.

272
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:47,879
I'll head out first.

273
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,240
Dad.

274
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,679
The company just released a new...

275
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,120
plush toy phone charm.

276
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,519
I never use that stuff.

277
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,279
Take a look.

278
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,039
By the way,

279
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,360
my son here...

280
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,480
isn't one to obediently follow orders.

281
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,159
You need to send someone...

282
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,799
to keep a close eye on him for me.

283
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:15,360
Chairman.

284
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:16,799
I've already arranged personnel.

285
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,320
You've done well.

286
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:25,240
Remember,

287
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,320
report to me at any time.

288
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,519
I want to see if this kid...

289
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,120
is really dating or not.

290
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,480
Woman.

291
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,600
From today onward,

292
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,279
you are my wife.

293
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,600
Even if you possess me,

294
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,639
you won't truly have me.

295
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,720
I don't want to have you forever.

296
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,559
I only want to possess you briefly.

297
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,000
Your brief possession of me...

298
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,600
will only make me hate you forever.

299
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,120
As long as you don't forget me,

300
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,399
then hate me to your heart's content.

301
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,759
Look at me.

302
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,159
We can never be together.

303
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,879
Love isn't something you can just buy...

304
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:13,879
and buy whenever you want.

305
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:15,679
Woman.

306
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,080
You're far too confident.

307
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:20,000
I just want you...

308
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,480
to be my fake wife.

309
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,480
When false is taken for true, true becomes false;

310
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:26,159
when non-being becomes being, being becomes non-being.

311
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,720
Truth and falsehood are hard to distinguish.

312
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:28,960
The false remains false.

313
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,039
The true remains true.

314
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:34,320
Woman.

315
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,600
You have successfully caught my attention.
