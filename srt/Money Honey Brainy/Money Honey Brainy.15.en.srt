1
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,799
What's going on?

2
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:41,799
My account was hacked.

3
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,479
Not asleep yet?

4
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,759
She knows it was me.

5
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:56,119
Seems it was a bit obvious.

6
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,880
You're not angry anymore, right?

7
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,119
Are you busy?

8
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,159
Senior Lin Xiang.

9
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,159
Do you need something, Senior?

10
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,079
A little bit.

11
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,599
But it's okay.

12
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,400
Who hasn't made a mistake?

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,920
As long as you can change, it's fine.

14
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,680
Get some rest early.

15
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,159
I have some confusion about relationships.

16
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:25,560
And I don't know who to talk to about it.

17
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,079
Tell me about it.

18
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,680
I'm on a break right now.

19
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,560
I...

20
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,760
Don't want to rest.

21
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,760
Want to chat with you.

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,640
Why?

23
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,640
I broke up.

24
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,640
She fell in love with someone else.

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,640
Because...

26
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,799
I like chatting with you.

27
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,400
I quite like it too.

28
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,680
How about...

29
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
We have a drink together?

30
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,000
Chat while we drink.

31
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,000
She...

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,879
She's not about to confess to me, is she?

33
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,159
What are you doing?

34
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,199
Water is good.

35
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,560
Water is healthy.

36
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,120
You have something on your mind?

37
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,479
Since the other person has already left,

38
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,520
don't overthink it.

39
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:37,879
Cheers.

40
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,080
Why do you want to...

41
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,719
chat online?

42
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,479
I seem to be a very nostalgic person.

43
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,199
It's hard to forget the past and start over.

44
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,959
It's the same for everyone.

45
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,639
I often think of the time in the art studio.

46
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,160
Online...

47
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,920
makes me feel a bit more secure.

48
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,000
What a strange woman.

49
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,800
You...

50
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,920
are a bit...

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
cute.

52
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,680
After all these years,

53
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,199
you're still just as understanding.

54
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,839
Easy to handle.

55
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,920
I like...

56
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,279
listening to music?

57
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,759
It's okay.

58
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,519
Do you remember this song?

59
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,480
We used to listen to it often in the art studio.

60
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,680
Do you like cheek-to-cheek dance?

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,959
I really like it.

62
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,759
How about...

63
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,480
asking the senior out?

64
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,959
It's just dancing, right?

65
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:53,040
What's gotten into this guy?

66
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,120
You told me

67
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,040
to be a bit braver,

68
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,759
to face my feelings honestly,

69
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,680
and to boldly speak my mind.

70
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,959
How do you know

71
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,600
what I'm hesitating about?

72
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:18,920
Thank you.

73
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,839
I think I know

74
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,000
what I should do.

75
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,480
Do you love watching movies?

76
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,759
Of course.

77
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,120
I'll treat you to a movie.

78
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,879
Or else...

79
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,879
I'll treat you to a movie.

80
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,360
Okay.

81
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,160
Actually, let me treat you.

82
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,000
Book out a whole theater for tomorrow.

83
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,319
Haven't you always said

84
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,920
watching movies is a waste of time?

85
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,519
Is the film industry a sunset industry?

86
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,519
What's up?

87
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,639
I feel like wasting some time.

88
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,279
I have an important arrangement.

89
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,439
Alright.

90
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:37,920
Understood.

91
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,920
Let me tell you one more time.

92
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,800
When I make this gesture,

93
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,319
set off the fireworks.

94
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:50,839
Got it?

95
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:51,920
Got it.

96
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,079
When I do this,

97
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,600
bring out the flowers and gifts.

98
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,319
Understand?

99
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:58,439
Don't worry, sir.

100
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,240
Go on.

101
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,759
Okay.

102
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:04,959
Wen Pei'an.

103
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,680
What a coincidence.

104
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,120
You're here to watch a movie too?

105
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:14,439
Still playing hard to get with me?

106
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,759
Yeah.

107
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,199
What a coincidence.

108
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,279
But your sense of humor needs work.

109
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,199
This is my senior, Lin Xiang.

110
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,079
Xin Tong, you've met her.

111
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,399
A-Wen.

112
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,800
A-Wen.

113
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,279
You even...

114
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,720
brought someone.

115
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,679
What else?

116
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,039
I thought it was that kind...

117
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,559
traditional kind of date.

118
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,600
It is quite traditional.

119
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,360
It's about time.

120
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,440
Shall we...

121
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,399
go in first?

122
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,879
You don't need to buy tickets.

123
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,600
I booked out the entire theater.

124
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,000
I saw the trailer before,

125
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,919
and thought...

126
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,320
this movie looked pretty good.

127
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,200
Your friend has good taste.

128
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,960
This movie has very high ratings.

129
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:10,720
What are you doing?

130
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,399
What were you thinking?

131
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,039
Inviting your senior over?

132
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,279
This is my privacy.

133
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,240
You have no right to interfere.

134
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:26,360
But I really don't understand your behavior.

135
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,919
I invited my senior to watch a movie.

136
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,120
What's so hard to understand?

137
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,759
Why watch it with three people?

138
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,159
Don't you think it's weird?

139
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,799
I think it's very weird.

140
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,320
Yeah.

141
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,639
Isn't this what you requested?

142
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,120
When did I request that? Just now.

143
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,639
Very strongly.

144
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,159
Today is very important to me.

145
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,320
You know what?

146
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,039
Today...

147
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,120
for me...

148
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:55,879
is also very important.

149
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:01,519
Wen Pei'an

150
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,240
What's wrong?

151
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,000
Right now, you

152
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,000
your whole self

153
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,080
is radiating a kind of

154
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,519
glow.

155
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:18,879
Thanks for the compliment.

156
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:21,440
You really have no perception.

157
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,559
Who's complimenting you?

158
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,240
Xin Tong,

159
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,879
your friend still hasn't moved on?

160
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,360
Well...

161
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,919
You should be able to understand.

162
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,000
You could say he and I are in the same boat.

163
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,679
Didn't you say

164
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,480
today was Wen Pei'an's confession day?

165
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,039
Why are there three people?

166
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,840
I don't know.

167
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,279
Look.

168
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,879
What are you guys doing here?

169
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,519
On such a special day,

170
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,840
how could I not be here?

171
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,600
You are...

172
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,480
Qixing?

173
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,120
And this is?

174
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,440
Hello, I'm Lin Xiang.

175
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,240
I follow your account.

176
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,360
I hope our Lin Group

177
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,840
will have a chance to work with you.

178
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,240
Hello, I'm family.

179
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,000
Pleased to meet you.

180
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,360
What does she even mean?

181
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:41,720
What's going on?

182
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,960
It seems

183
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,919
today isn't suitable for a confession.

184
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,360
Xin Tong,

185
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,960
what kind of person are you, really?

186
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,960
My understanding of you

187
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,600
is far too little.

188
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,440
Thanks for booking the place today.

189
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,200
My senior and I have another

190
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,159
art exhibition to see.

191
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,759
So we'll be leaving first.

192
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,279
We should still have time, right?

193
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:04,960
There's time.

194
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:05,720
Then let's go.

195
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:07,480
Let's go.

196
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:07,840
Go.

197
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,519
Who's confessing to whom here?

198
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,039
You need to be braver.

199
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:29,519
Face your feelings honestly.

200
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:31,320
Speak your mind boldly.

201
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,679
I hope you understand.

202
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,919
Of course I understand.

203
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,039
Thank you.

204
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:54,879
Thank you for letting me be brave and be myself.

205
00:12:58,879 --> 00:12:59,519
Senior,

206
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:03,360
actually, I...

207
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,320
Actually, I've liked you for a long time.

208
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:17,759
Thank you.

209
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:19,399
But I think

210
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:22,080
we need to get to know each other better.

211
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,200
That's okay.

212
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,200
But I'm willing to accept your affection.

213
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,559
Then we'll

214
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,600
be off now.

215
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,480
Thanks for the flowers.

216
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:13,039
I didn't expect you to help others find happiness.

217
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,759
Maybe this is love.

218
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,679
They're quite a good match.

219
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:20,799
Bro, why do you look pale?

220
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:24,720
Your hands are ice cold.

221
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,080
Should we go see a doctor?

222
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,159
Do I?

223
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,759
Let's go.

224
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,120
Why are you back so late?

225
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,519
Are you crazy?

226
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:55,519
Why aren't the lights on if you're home alone?

227
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,480
What did you mean by what you posted on Little Blue Book?

228
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,639
What do you mean, what?

229
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,080
My account was hacked days ago.

230
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,080
I'm applying to get it back now.

231
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:07,960
Was

232
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,639
hacked?

233
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:12,879
The Coco account?

234
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:13,480
Yeah.

235
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,120
You know about that account?

236
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,159
What did you mean by what you just said?

237
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:20,320
Which one of my

238
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,720
Little Blue Book posts?

239
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,759
Nothing.

240
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:26,279
Just curious.

241
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:32,840
Brother,

242
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,879
I'm sorry.

243
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,320
Something happened at home today,

244
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,320
so I couldn't make our date.

245
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:38,240
My grandpa was in a car accident and is hospitalized.

246
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,360
He urgently needs money for treatment.

247
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,399
But I don't have enough on hand.

248
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,039
What's wrong with you?

249
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:54,080
It's nothing.

250
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,759
My, uh...

251
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,039
My friend's grandpa

252
00:15:58,679 --> 00:15:59,440
was in a car accident.

253
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,879
Is it serious?

254
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,200
What do we do now?

255
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,480
Transfer money for treatment.

256
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,600
You're pretty good to your friend.

257
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:17,960
I finally got my account back.

258
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,879
Little Blue Book has been fully acquired.

259
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,279
The chat records you requested

260
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,240
have also been completely deleted.

261
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,159
Our group has nothing to do

262
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,200
with this app.

263
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,080
Why did you buy it?

264
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,679
You found the hacker, right?

265
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,960
We've already confirmed their IP address.

266
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,639
Good.

267
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:40,840
Call the police.

268
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,799
Arrest them.

269
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,720
Scamming five hundred thousand

270
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:44,840
is an amount

271
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,240
especially huge.

272
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,639
He won't get out in under five years.

273
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:49,759
You...

274
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,559
You didn't transfer the money to him on purpose, did you?

275
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:54,639
Am I that bored?

276
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:57,559
And you couldn't possibly be that stupid.

277
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:06,160
Having an opponent makes it more interesting.

278
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,119
Lin Xiang.
