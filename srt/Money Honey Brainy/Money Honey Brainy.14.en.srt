1
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:47,200
Stella

2
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:48,840
What?

3
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:49,799
I want to ask you something.

4
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:51,960
I knew it.

5
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:55,439
Our Chairman...

6
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,759
...how many times has he been married?

7
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:57,880
Are you crazy?

8
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,679
The Chairman and his first wife were betrothed in the womb.

9
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,520
They've been devoted to each other for decades.

10
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,000
There's never been any gossip about him.

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,560
Then tell me...

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,000
...is it possible...

13
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,040
...that Galileo was adopted?

14
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,799
Or that Qixing was adopted?

15
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,239
How is that possible?

16
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,640
Those two...

17
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:15,719
...look so much alike.

18
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:16,879
Do they?

19
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,239
I actually think...

20
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,959
...that little assistant looks more like him.

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,560
What?

22
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,280
When did you go blind?

23
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:29,200
I know a pretty good eye doctor.

24
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,120
Watch your mouth!

25
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,120
Watch your mouth!

26
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,719
They do look alike.

27
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,079
Wen Pei'an.

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,239
Galileo.

29
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,239
What else?

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,280
You little bastard!

31
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,760
Bastard!

32
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,000
You just wait.

33
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,520
We are truly in love.

34
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,479
Why didn't you tell me?

35
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,240
I considered you a brother.

36
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,919
And you actually...

37
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,039
...you're trying to date my sister?

38
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,599
I've always wanted to tell you.

39
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,520
It's just that...

40
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,879
...there was never a good opportunity.

41
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,319
When did you two get together?

42
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,560
Don't laugh.

43
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,360
Actually...

44
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,120
...back in high school...

45
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,159
...we had already entered each other's hearts.

46
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,639
High school?

47
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:32,879
Eight years.

48
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,400
So you had no time in eight years to tell me, is that it?

49
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:37,680
Ou Lu.

50
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,120
I was fooled by your acting.

51
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,039
Eight years.

52
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,719
I was in a difficult position too.

53
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,400
I hope...

54
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,560
...you can understand.

55
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,360
Stop.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,159
One last question.

57
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,199
When you first got close to me...

58
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,680
...did you want to be my brother...

59
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,800
...or did you want to date my sister?

60
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:56,719
I wanted both.

61
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:00,599
No, wait.

62
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,599
Think about it.

63
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,520
Love and friendship...

64
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,560
...they don't conflict, right?

65
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:05,400
Right?

66
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:05,919
You...

67
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,960
...are not worthy.

68
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,520
I'm not worthy of being your good brother...

69
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,960
...or not worthy of being your good brother-in-law?

70
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,080
Brother-in-law.

71
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,400
Don't let me hear those words.

72
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,599
Then how about this...

73
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,240
From now on, think of me as two people.

74
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:26,199
'Ou'...

75
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,639
...is your good brother.

76
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,639
'Lu'...

77
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,639
...is your good brother-in-law.

78
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,000
Brother-in-law.

79
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,000
You...

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,520
President.

81
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,159
This...

82
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,439
...this chair, is it...

83
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,439
...is there a problem with it? Yes, it is a bit uncomfortable.

84
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,360
Yes, it is a bit uncomfortable.

85
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,159
I'll have a new one custom-made for you.

86
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,240
Is there something you need?

87
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:50,960
Xin Tong.

88
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,120
It's like this.

89
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,879
Our company's Four Seas Vitality live stream...

90
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,759
...will have its debut broadcast this afternoon.

91
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,400
We need the President to attend.

92
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,159
So...

93
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,840
...I'm here to coordinate the timing with both of you.

94
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,800
The President attending?

95
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:05,759
I'd rather not.

96
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,560
I still want...

97
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,120
...to keep a low profile.

98
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,919
We won't reveal your identity.

99
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,199
The President will attend as an ordinary employee.

100
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:15,560
Well, I...

101
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,839
You have a very important meeting this afternoon.

102
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:18,759
Right.

103
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,639
That meeting...

104
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,360
...is very important.

105
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,079
Perhaps you should first hear about the live stream content.

106
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,279
During the live stream...

107
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,160
...we will have a Puppet Game.

108
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,879
The President will play the role of the puppet.

109
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,759
He will fulfill...

110
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,639
...any requests from the netizens.

111
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,160
Any requests.

112
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,240
Even unreasonable requests...

113
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,360
...can they be fulfilled?

114
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,240
Of course.

115
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,319
This makes it easier...

116
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:45,680
...for the company to get closer to young people.

117
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,040
I think it's very necessary.

118
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,720
I think this proposal is good.

119
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,879
I think we can add some more...

120
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:51,480
...even more...

121
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,600
...impactful...

122
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,639
...creativity.

123
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:54,839
Such as?

124
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,600
Washing hair while doing a handstand.

125
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,319
Taking off clothes for a costume change.

126
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,800
Whatever is novel, we'll do it.

127
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,800
Excellent.

128
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,000
President, do you agree?

129
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,439
Great!

130
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,120
With your strong support...

131
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,199
...I believe...

132
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,680
...Qixing's debut this afternoon...

133
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,279
...will definitely be a great success.

134
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,160
So, I'd like to confirm once more...

135
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:13,240
...is the President's time okay?

136
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,040
My time is actually...

137
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,560
It's fine.

138
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,399
I'll reschedule your time for you.

139
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,079
Perfect.

140
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,560
I'm really looking forward to the live stream this afternoon.

141
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,040
You...

142
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:22,519
...prepare well.

143
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,160
See you in the live stream room.

144
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,600
You're using your position for personal revenge.

145
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,240
You made me lose face in front of so many netizens.

146
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:33,879
And besides,

147
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,040
Qixing has so many fans.

148
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,959
You're underestimating me.

149
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,079
Am I really that vindictive?

150
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,160
It's all for the sake of work.

151
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:43,959
Do your best.

152
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,160
Good luck.

153
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:48,800
President.

154
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,360
You're here.

155
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,879
Let me briefly explain to you both.

156
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,079
After the livestream starts,

157
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,240
Qixing will first give a brief introduction

158
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,120
to the overall Four Seas brand image.

159
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,600
The next segment

160
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,480
will be the interaction

161
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,240
with the netizens.

162
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:04,360
Let me check.

163
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,680
One minute left.

164
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,639
Livestream starting.

165
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,360
Next up is the interactive segment.

166
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,839
If you have any requests,

167
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,079
our esteemed President

168
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:14,000
will fulfill them one by one.

169
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,000
Let's welcome

170
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,800
the handsome Four Seas President.

171
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,959
Secretary Ou.

172
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,360
Where are you going?

173
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,160
Darn it.

174
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,360
Darn it.

175
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,839
President.

176
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:29,920
Where are you going?

177
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,120
It's almost time for

178
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,680
your brilliant performance segment.

179
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:38,639
You

180
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,160
knew all along.

181
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,000
What do you think?

182
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,879
After you.

183
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,040
Galileo.

184
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,800
Did you snitch?

185
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:56,959
It was you, wasn't it?

186
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,199
Dear brother.

187
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,759
To demonstrate that Four Seas

188
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,120
listens to customer needs,

189
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,120
we'll randomly select viewer comments.

190
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,879
All your requests,

191
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,000
our Four Seas President

192
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,199
will fulfill them one by one.

193
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,160
A user benefit is a discount.

194
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,240
We hope the President

195
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,680
can perform an amazing dance.

196
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,279
Welcome to

197
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,480
Four Seas.

198
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,120
Xin Tong.

199
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

200
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,439
I didn't, boss.

201
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,360
What?

202
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:08,839
Dancing,

203
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,639
handstands,

204
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:10,279
rapping...

205
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,160
These segments

206
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,839
were all your idea, weren't they?

207
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,160
You even said it was a good idea.

208
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,519
Why are you blaming me now, boss?

209
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,639
That last part worked really well.

210
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,920
The traffic is skyrocketing.

211
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,560
It's effective.

212
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,079
I'm going to check around.

213
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,199
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

214
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,560
I was afraid...

215
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,200
Afraid you'd find out

216
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
I was that darn bastard.

217
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,440
Afraid our relationship would become distant.

218
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,120
Afraid you'd know I like you.

219
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,919
Afraid of what?

220
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,919
Afraid I'd make exorbitant demands?

221
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,639
Afraid I'd extort money from you?

222
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,039
That's my privacy.

223
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,000
I have the right not to tell you.

224
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:57,559
Fine.

225
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,360
Well then, next up

226
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,399
there are still many segments.

227
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:02,200
You need to

228
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,279
keep it up.

229
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,279
And also...

230
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,399
What a sin.

231
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,879
Netizen "Li Mama Who's Not a Mom"

232
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,159
hopes the President can

233
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:21,240
perform a heartfelt confession.

234
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,799
Even the script is written.

235
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,440
Am I supposed to say this to a user?

236
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,960
How about

237
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,360
having our specialist Xin Tong

238
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,639
help perform it with you?

239
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,399
Brother.

240
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,960
Seize this opportunity.

241
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:36,960
Advance to attack,

242
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
retreat to defend.

243
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,559
Let's get started.

244
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,000
Actually, during this time,

245
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,639
even though we've had our bumps,

246
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,759
I don't know how you feel,

247
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,559
but I think I'm falling a bit.

248
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,759
Under the watch of these hundred thousand netizens,

249
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,840
I want to tell you:

250
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,440
I love you.

251
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,480
I just took a look at the script.

252
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:32,000
This

253
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,159
"Frog Prank" segment...

254
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,399
Did you swap it out?

255
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,960
Of course not.

256
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,320
It was my direct supervisor,

257
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,480
Qixing.

258
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:43,120
She just genuinely wanted to set you two up.

259
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,799
Please thank her for her kindness.

260
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,399
But between Wen Pei'an and me,

261
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,519
it's impossible.

262
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,120
He,

263
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:56,120
a well-bred man,

264
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,600
has never been involved with

265
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,320
an ordinary girl like me.

266
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,720
After spending time together,

267
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,360
it's easy to develop an illusion.

268
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,679
And this illusion

269
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,440
is just hormones at play.

270
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,759
It's not real.

271
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:11,840
It's fake.

272
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,799
It will always be fake.

273
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:15,600
So,

274
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,960
I'm counting on you.

275
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,399
You can't just mess with me alone.

276
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:25,200
It's because you're outstanding.

277
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,600
Secretary Ou.

278
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:30,519
Hello.

279
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,320
You don't seem to welcome me.

280
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,960
How would internet celebrity Miss Coco dare?

281
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,360
We can't afford to offend you.

282
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,320
As the boss,

283
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,919
I naturally keep an eye on my employees.

284
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,080
What's going on?

285
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,159
My account was hacked.

286
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:32,440
Come on, come on.

287
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,320
Today, let me introduce a new classmate.

288
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:34,679
Come on.

289
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:35,159
Classmate,

290
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:35,759
introduce yourself.

291
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,919
I'm Ou Lu.

292
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,559
Good, everyone, welcome him.

293
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:54,799
Hello.
