1
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:38,640
Come on.

2
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:40,560
This glass

3
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,159
is to celebrate Mr. Wen Pei'an's

4
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:43,679
modeling career

5
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:44,640
debut

6
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,759
being a complete success.

7
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,240
Bottoms up.

8
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,840
This second glass

9
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:04,040
celebrates the two of us

10
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,879
for today's performance

11
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,959
being a total victory.

12
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:08,120
At the time, I thought

13
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,599
with our acting skills,

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,159
we could've starred in *Lurk*.

15
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,400
You're way too slow.

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,640
This third glass...

17
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,319
This is liquor,

18
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,239
not water.

19
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,719
Of course I know it's liquor.

20
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:35,840
Me,

21
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,200
I have a high tolerance.

22
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,040
If you can't handle it,

23
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,480
just drink less.

24
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,879
I can tell you can't handle it.

25
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:13,680
You know what?

26
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:14,960
Actually,

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,120
I do have a boyfriend.

28
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,639
Really?

29
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,039
How come you've never mentioned him?

30
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,319
Cash.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,680
Cash is my boyfriend.

32
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,120
You know what?

33
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
Actually,

34
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,439
I'm really, really envious of you.

35
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,800
I envy that you have

36
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,560
parents who love you so much.

37
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,560
Your parents don't love you?

38
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,120
Probably not.

39
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,280
Because

40
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,120
I've never even seen them.

41
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,319
To be precise,

42
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,159
it's that

43
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,240
the moment I was born,

44
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,520
they abandoned me.

45
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,639
I grew up in an orphanage.

46
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,319
When I was little,

47
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,800
I'd see those kids

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,360
being taken out by their parents,

49
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,919
going out to play.

50
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,039
They got tasty food

51
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,360
and wore pretty clothes.

52
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,319
You have no idea how much I envied them.

53
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,080
So,

54
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,960
when I was seven years old,

55
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,719
I thought I did

56
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,919
something incredibly brave.

57
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,360
I ran away from the orphanage.

58
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,800
I wanted to go out

59
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,199
and find my

60
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,560
mom and dad.

61
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,039
Hey, kid.

62
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:54,919
Why are you alone?

63
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,840
Mister,

64
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,280
could you buy me a bun?

65
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,360
I'm hungry.

66
00:03:59,319 --> 00:03:59,879
Sure.

67
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,120
I'll treat you.

68
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,800
Why are you here by yourself?

69
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:40,279
My parents are coming to pick me up soon.

70
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,560
What about you?

71
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,480
I ran away from home on purpose.

72
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,199
Be gone for two hours,

73
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:49,279
show my parents who's boss.

74
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,680
You should go home.

75
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,680
You'll miss them.

76
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,000
I won't miss them at all.

77
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,079
Will you miss yours?

78
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,600
It's about time.

79
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,800
I should head home.

80
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,720
You should go home early too.

81
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,759
Of course, the result was obvious.

82
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,439
I didn't find them.

83
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,920
Because I had no idea

84
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,439
what they even looked like.

85
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,600
Don't look at me with such pity.

86
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,160
Personally, I feel

87
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
my childhood

88
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,759
was actually quite happy.

89
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,240
Let me tell you,

90
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:43,800
I'm not bragging,

91
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,160
but I'm someone

92
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,399
who's very smart.

93
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,360
No matter what I learn,

94
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,120
as long as

95
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,160
I see it three times,

96
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,480
I can master it.

97
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,279
Do you believe me?

98
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:00,279
I believe you.

99
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,319
You don't believe me?

100
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,040
In today's society,

101
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,720
educational background is highly valued.

102
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,399
For someone like me,

103
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,720
with a low level of education,

104
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,680
it's really hard

105
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,000
to get by in this world.

106
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,560
Can you understand?

107
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,040
I can understand.

108
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,399
If you were to say

109
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,000
you can't understand,

110
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,560
but even if you don't,

111
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,279
that's okay too.

112
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,720
But honestly,

113
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,399
I'm very grateful

114
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,160
that my current company

115
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,120
doesn't care about my education.

116
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,439
But recently,

117
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,600
our company

118
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,519
got a new bastard in charge.

119
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,079
That

120
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,120
bas-

121
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,399
tard.

122
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,680
Let me tell you,

123
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,639
this bastard,

124
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,519
as soon as he took over,

125
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,040
he destroyed

126
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,480
all the proposals

127
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,160
I worked so hard on.

128
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:59,040
What the hell does he know?

129
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,600
Such a great company...

130
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,279
I'm really worried

131
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,439
that as soon as he took over,

132
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,800
he'd ruin this company.

133
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,600
Have you ever considered

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,040
that this situation

135
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,000
might be viewed differently by everyone?

136
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,600
Impossible.

137
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,839
Let me ask you,

138
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,199
what is the

139
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,519
fundamental rule

140
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,319
for a boyfriend?

141
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,639
It's that

142
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,079
whoever the girlfriend

143
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,959
curses at,

144
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,759
the boyfriend must curse at too.

145
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:32,879
Come on, come on, come on.

146
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,680
Curse with me.

147
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,120
My boss

148
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,120
is a

149
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,279
stupid little bastard.

150
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:41,920
Your boss

151
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,160
is a stupid little bastard.

152
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,879
That's not good enough.

153
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,519
You have to be louder.

154
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:47,879
Come on.

155
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,360
With me,

156
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,759
shout it out loud!

157
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,000
MY BOSS

158
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,439
IS A

159
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:56,959
STUPID

160
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,120
LITTLE BASTARD!

161
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,720
YOUR BOSS

162
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,199
IS A

163
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,759
STUPID

164
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,360
LITTLE BASTARD!

165
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:16,519
He is a stupid little bastard!

166
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,680
Xin Tong!

167
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,759
Darn it, Wen Pei'an!

168
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,720
You're a beast!

169
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,279
Wen Pei'an!

170
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,799
Wen Pei'an!

171
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,200
Tell me,

172
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,440
what did you do

173
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,320
to me last night?

174
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,320
I didn't do anything.

175
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,240
I demand

176
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,200
to see the rooftop surveillance from last night.

177
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,120
No.

178
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,320
You have no right to see it.

179
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:53,799
Fine.

180
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,120
If you won't show me,

181
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,159
you must have a guilty conscience.

182
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,519
I could choose to call the police.

183
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,440
I can use the power of the law

184
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,320
to punish you.

185
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:39,600
I'm sorry.

186
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,159
It's okay.

187
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,159
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

188
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,360
I really didn't mean to.

189
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,320
It's okay, it's okay.

190
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,399
Let me wash your clothes.

191
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,440
It's okay, it's okay.

192
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,519
I must wash them for you.

193
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,639
I have to take responsibility.

194
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,200
You...

195
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,000
Give me a chance.

196
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,840
I'll wash them clean for you.

197
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,159
I'll definitely wash them clean.

198
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,360
Give them here!

199
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,039
You...

200
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:00,720
wait here for me.

201
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,600
Don't worry, I'll definitely wash them clean.

202
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,240
Go over there and wait.

203
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,000
It'll be quick.

204
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,039
Wait here for me.

205
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,519
Xin Tong!

206
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,320
Xin Tong!

207
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,360
I'll be quick!

208
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,200
Wait for me!

209
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,080
Wait for me!

210
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,679
Xin Tong, give my clothes back!

211
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,399
Xin Tong!

212
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:17,759
Xin Tong!

213
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,159
Right.

214
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,080
I'm sorry.

215
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,600
Is that enough?

216
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,679
I'm so sorry.

217
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,320
I'm truly sorry.

218
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,200
I'm not usually like this when I drink.

219
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,600
After I wash these clothes clean,

220
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,480
I'll return them to you.

221
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:02,440
I advise you

222
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,559
to quit drinking from now on.

223
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:05,879
I swear,

224
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,360
I won't drink anymore.

225
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,440
That outfit you're wearing

226
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,000
is very stylish.

227
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:18,759
Hello?

228
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:19,200
What's up?

229
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,399
This morning, our marketing department

230
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,159
has a meeting with President Galileo.

231
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,240
Darn it, I forgot!

232
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,240
I'm on my way right now!

233
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:25,279
I know, I know.

234
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,159
Remember to take your medicine.

235
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,279
Be right there.

236
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:48,679
Do you need a ride?

237
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,879
Is that okay?

238
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,720
Where are you going?

239
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,879
Four Seas Tower.
