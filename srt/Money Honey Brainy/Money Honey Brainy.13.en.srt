1
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,439
So beautiful.

2
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:52,039
This one's pretty too.

3
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,359
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:55,159
What?

5
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,600
You're not happy to see me?

6
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,520
I invited Qixing.

7
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,719
Today is my birthday.

8
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,719
It's your birthday today?

9
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:05,799
Yeah.

10
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,400
So...

11
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,280
Today, you two have a special privilege.

12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,719
You order the dishes.

13
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:11,760
I'll cook them.

14
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,000
How about that?

15
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,680
You'll make anything we order?

16
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,480
Of course.

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,840
I'll learn as I go.

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,239
Go on.

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,359
What would you like to eat?

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:20,959
Let me think...

21
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,680
Then I want...

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,719
Clover sprouts.

23
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,400
Stir-fried dried tofu.

24
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,359
Let's have steamed perch.

25
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,799
Porcini mushrooms.

26
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,439
Okay.

27
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:31,760
And one more.

28
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,879
That dish we used to love.

29
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,439
Fragrant Crispy Delight.

30
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,760
I'll have one.

31
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,719
These dishes...

32
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:51,000
Should be enough for the three of us, right?

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,040
It's your birthday, you're the boss.

34
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,599
You just said you two...

35
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,719
What's that dish you loved called?

36
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,719
Fragrant Crispy Delight.

37
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,359
The recipe for Fragrant Crispy Delight.

38
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,599
You're looking up the recipe now?

39
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,599
Yeah.

40
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,159
Learn on the spot.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,680
Cook on the spot.

42
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,919
Tastes good, right?

43
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,080
I'm an honest person.

44
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,919
Today, in the name of my birthday,

45
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,319
I invited you two here

46
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,319
with the goal of getting you

47
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
to make up.

48
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,680
Go back to how things were.

49
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,639
Let me state first,

50
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,639
He and I...

51
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
We're a fake couple.

52
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,400
Please don't mind that.

53
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,360
What's wrong?

54
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,080
What if he doesn't want to start over?

55
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,840
He's pretending.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,759
You have no idea.

57
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,000
Yesterday on set,

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,080
when he saw you were hurt,

59
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,960
he was more nervous than anyone.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,120
Those eyes of his...

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,400
Anyone with eyes could see it.

62
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,199
Really.

63
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,319
Xin Tong, you just don't understand the situation.

64
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,319
I do understand.

65
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:02,840
You just...

66
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,919
Listen to me.

67
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:04,840
You two...

68
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,800
Right now, it's just that...

69
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,280
Neither of you is willing to take the first step.

70
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,080
Listen to me.

71
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,520
I really don't want to see two people

72
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,840
who truly love each other

73
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,039
miss each other like this.

74
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,639
Sometimes, if you miss it,

75
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,479
it's for a lifetime.

76
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,520
Come on.

77
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:24,680
Let's have a drink.

78
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,000
Drink until we're drunk.

79
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,800
We won't leave until we're drunk.

80
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:37,960
The Fragrant Crispy Delight

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,919
you love.

82
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,000
Eat more.

83
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:49,840
Cheers.

84
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,719
I've had too much to drink.

85
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,919
As for your business,

86
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,719
you two sort it out yourselves.

87
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,319
I won't meddle anymore.

88
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,560
I'll first...

89
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,560
go to sleep.

90
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
It's getting late anyway.

91
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,159
Let's call it a night.

92
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:11,960
No.

93
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,280
You have to keep going.

94
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,160
You have to keep talking.

95
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,519
You'd better come to some conclusion.

96
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,199
Xin Tong.

97
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,399
Don't be willful.

98
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,279
I can see it.

99
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,800
You two probably haven't drunk enough yet.

100
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,800
Since you're like this,

101
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,079
it feels like I'm the one

102
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,160
breaking up the party.

103
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,079
Come on, come on.

104
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,959
Then I'll have a little more with you two.

105
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,560
Let's see what kind of result

106
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,240
you two can talk out.

107
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:36,879
Here.

108
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,639
Don't let all this good food go to waste.

109
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,240
Who would have thought

110
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,839
You're quite patient with her

111
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,160
It seems my guess was right

112
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,199
Brother

113
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,800
You're in pretty deep, aren't you?

114
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
We just have a cooperative relationship

115
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,680
Still talking tough

116
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,360
Don't you want to know

117
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,040
whether Xin Tong actually likes you?

118
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,920
What reason would she have not to like me?

119
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,199
Being full of hot air, aside from the smell

120
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,839
is completely useless

121
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,240
Alright

122
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,079
Then tell me

123
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,519
what is your insight

124
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,199
I think...

125
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,079
I think...

126
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:42,680
Today

127
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,279
on this

128
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,800
incredibly important day

129
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,439
I want to join you two

130
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,240
to form a three-person team

131
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,360
to discuss together

132
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,319
the grand plan for Four Seas

133
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,199
to discuss

134
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,360
how to help Qixing

135
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,639
win back

136
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:03,399
the top management rights of Four Seas

137
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:07,639
Question

138
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,199
Go ahead

139
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,160
Is your boss really that bad?

140
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,759
Good question

141
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,600
This boss of mine...

142
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,560
has three major crimes

143
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,439
Number three

144
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,439
The proposal I slaved over all night

145
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,199
he told me it lacked data support

146
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,160
Is data that important?

147
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,040
Number two

148
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,480
People like us

149
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,519
who have struggled for a living since childhood

150
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,079
and gave up our studies

151
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,759
are we really that bad?

152
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,040
Are we really inferior to

153
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,720
those graduates from prestigious schools?

154
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,600
Can he truly see our abilities?

155
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,920
And the most important point

156
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,319
is that he

157
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,399
is petty

158
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,720
Qixing is clearly very capable

159
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,360
He's afraid Qixing's ability will overshadow his own

160
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,680
so he won't sign his own sister

161
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:59,959
His heart is really just

162
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,439
this

163
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,079
big

164
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,160
and no more

165
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:07,600
So

166
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
is this fair?

167
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,240
You think it's unfair too, right?

168
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,319
Exactly

169
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,839
In this world

170
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,759
where is there so much fairness?

171
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,759
Qixing

172
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,120
she is clearly already excellent

173
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
but just because

174
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,240
she is a girl

175
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,279
she is

176
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,480
marginalized by the family

177
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,839
and they euphemistically claim

178
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,240
it's out of

179
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,480
protection for a girl

180
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,439
Do you know how hard girls these days

181
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,199
have to work to get

182
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,399
what boys get

183
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,759
from the moment they are born?

184
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,720
Qixing

185
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:55,879
I know

186
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,519
you must be very defiant

187
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,079
The reason you changed your name

188
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,319
is because you want

189
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,680
to hold your destiny

190
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,000
firmly in your own hands

191
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,399
You are amazing

192
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,199
Is it that

193
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:17,879
just because

194
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,680
I am a girl

195
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,560
that I

196
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,160
should be abandoned

197
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,319
by my parents?

198
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,600
Let me tell you two

199
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,480
a little secret

200
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,200
Actually, today isn't my birthday

201
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,200
Today is

202
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,440
the day I was adopted by the welfare institute

203
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,320
I simply don't know

204
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,360
when my birthday actually is

205
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,480
So

206
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,360
I tell myself

207
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,200
I must work hard

208
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,559
I must work doubly hard

209
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,360
I must work hard to make money

210
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,080
I must work hard to prove myself

211
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,240
Prove that I

212
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,799
that I am not that bad at all

213
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,759
I want to prove it to everyone

214
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,759
But I realized

215
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,879
it seems no one really cares about me

216
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,320
I don't know

217
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,879
who I should prove myself to

218
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,159
I care

219
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,919
You are excellent

220
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,639
I'll help you take down that bastard right now

221
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,159
Okay?

222
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Down with that bastard

223
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,360
Down with him

224
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,080
Let's go now

225
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,120
Qixing

226
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,600
What Xin Tong just said

227
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,240
is that what you think too?

228
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:58,919
What I think

229
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,639
never seems to matter, does it?

230
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,320
I just wanted to protect you

231
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,519
I've grown up, Brother

232
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,039
I can protect you too

233
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,039
Take good care of her

234
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,039
I'm going to sleep

235
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,879
It's so beautiful

236
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,240
You prepared all this?

237
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,360
You prepared this for Qixing?

238
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,960
Prepared for you

239
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,320
Xin Tong

240
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,840
I don't care what you encountered

241
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,879
before you met me

242
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,519
but I hope

243
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,000
every day from now on

244
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,279
will be full of color

245
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,919
just like these flowers

246
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,519
I will always be with you

247
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,080
Happy Birthday

248
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,480
Is there a secret agent here?

249
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,960
No

250
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,080
No way

251
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,320
I must not be sober yet

252
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,519
My head really hurts

253
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,320
I'm going back to sleep

254
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:51,279
Goodnight

255
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,720
Then rest well

256
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:55,759
Are you okay?

257
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,120
I'm fine

258
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:03,480
Your room

259
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:05,799
is over there.

260
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,120
I don't like it.

261
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,840
What do you mean by saying that today?

262
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,080
Don't tell me...

263
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,799
you actually like me?

264
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,039
Impossible.

265
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,120
Absolutely impossible.

266
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,039
Calm down.

267
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,960
The two of you

268
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,399
are currently just in a

269
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,960
cooperative couple relationship.

270
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:51,919
Besides,

271
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,559
that guy is a total playboy.

272
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,080
What's there to like?

273
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,080
Being with you

274
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,960
is just him playing a part.

275
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,159
Don't you believe it.

276
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:07,879
But he...

277
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,200
isn't that much of a playboy, right?

278
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,519
Careful.

279
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,960
That bastard is personally picking up Qixing.

280
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,000
The relationship between this brother and sister

281
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,639
looks pretty good, huh?

282
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:27,399
It's a bit too good, isn't it?

283
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,600
This...
