1
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,119
Come here quickly.

2
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:43,920
What's going on today?

3
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:45,240
So lavish!

4
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,399
I

5
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,320
want to ask you

6
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,359
for a small favor.

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,600
Let me state upfront,

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,880
I refuse all filming.

9
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,920
It's not about filming.

10
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:55,799
Me,

11
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:56,759
I have a

12
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,359
Psychology Qualification Certificate exam next week.

13
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,520
It's just the hypnosis part

14
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:01,960
that I'm still lacking in.

15
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,039
So,

16
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:04,159
I want to ask you

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,280
to help me.

18
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,319
So, be your guinea pig, huh?

19
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,879
A guinea pig that doesn't get knocked on the head.

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,120
Now imagine

21
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,599
you're on a beach.

22
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,280
The sea breeze

23
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,239
gently brushes your cheek.

24
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,200
The warm sunlight

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,040
shines on your face.

26
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,719
You feel

27
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,439
exceptionally comfortable.

28
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:50,920
Now,

29
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,200
can you talk about your ex-girlfriend?

30
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,159
I don't know what you're talking about.

31
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,280
In your heart,

32
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,560
are you still thinking about her?

33
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,640
I don't know.

34
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:12,719
This guy's lips are sealed tight, huh?

35
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,439
Let's try a different way.

36
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,159
You

37
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,599
had a

38
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,759
memorable time together, just the two of you?

39
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,520
Scumbag.

40
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,919
Your boss

41
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,319
is just a

42
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,639
little bastard.

43
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,240
You

44
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,439
don't want

45
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,439
this wonderful time

46
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,919
to just end like this, do you?

47
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
After the cooperation ends,

48
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,919
you break up peacefully.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,800
From then on, you never see each other again.

50
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,439
Deal.

51
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,560
Pleasure doing business.

52
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,960
You love her,

53
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,719
right?

54
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,639
Love.

55
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,560
Do you want

56
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,280
to continue with her?

57
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,520
Want.

58
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,319
You both still love each other,

59
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,039
yet neither is willing to back down.

60
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,879
Sometimes, one turn away

61
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,960
means a lifetime.

62
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,159
Since you two

63
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,080
both have feelings for each other,

64
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,879
then I'll help you find happiness.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,039
You can now slowly

66
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,080
open your eyes.

67
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:16,879
How do you feel?

68
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,720
When did I fall asleep?

69
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,720
Thanks for your cooperation.

70
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:21,800
Wake up.

71
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,560
Let's go eat.

72
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,560
Tomorrow is date day.

73
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,720
Remember to keep your schedule clear.

74
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:32,720
You

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,480
r dad still doesn't believe it?

76
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,600
He's not that easy to convince.

77
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,879
Actually, no one is watching us anymore.

78
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,759
It's just

79
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,639
I simply want to go on a date with you.

80
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,000
This is a good opportunity.

81
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,079
Morning.

82
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,079
You're riding this on your date today?

83
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,079
This is called

84
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,600
a bicycle outing.

85
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:09,759
Let's go.

86
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,519
No way.

87
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,560
Hello.

88
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,399
Xin Tong.

89
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,879
What a coincidence

90
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,160
running into you here.

91
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,040
Long time no see.

92
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,279
You

93
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,160
guys.

94
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,800
Qixing

95
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,040
has already agreed to cooperate with us.

96
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,959
She has now decided

97
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,680
to come to Four Seas' live stream

98
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,800
as a guest.

99
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,680
Didn't the President say

100
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,759
to ignore that little bastard?

101
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,600
I have my own plan.

102
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,079
You two

103
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,439
We two

104
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,639
don't know each other.

105
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,560
Don't know each other.

106
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,079
We two are old acquaintances.

107
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,319
It's been so long,

108
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,800
you've kept your figure quite well.

109
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,240
Your chest is still so big.

110
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,720
Why are you getting angry?

111
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,600
You're on a date?

112
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,480
Yeah.

113
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,040
No.

114
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,560
Let me introduce you.

115
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,920
This is my girlfriend,

116
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,480
Xin Tong.

117
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:20,199
No need to use me to make your ex-girlfriend jealous.

118
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,560
Besides, how could I possibly

119
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,600
make Qixing jealous?

120
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,160
We're on a date right now.

121
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,000
So,

122
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,439
since we're all so familiar,

123
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,360
why don't we

124
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,759
hang out together?

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Exactly,

126
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,839
we can all

127
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,680
catch up together.

128
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,120
Let's go.

129
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,560
Go.

130
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,319
Have a good catch-up.

131
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:46,680
You

132
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,319
What?

133
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,920
You know her relationship with the President, right?

134
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,879
Yeah, I know.

135
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,399
She's the President's sister.

136
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,040
Right.

137
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,000
So what's the point of this little act?

138
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,399
I hope you two can reconcile.

139
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,319
What did you say?

140
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:12,759
Wha-

141
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,680
Reconcile what?

142
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,879
During the hypnosis...

143
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,120
what did you say?

144
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:18,680
I...

145
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,279
What did I say?

146
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,839
You said...

147
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,000
you still love her.

148
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,079
I love her?

149
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,600
Who do I love?

150
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,800
I think that spot over there looks nice.

151
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,360
I'm going to shoot some vlog footage.

152
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,720
Your girlfriend is quite pretty.

153
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,560
What's your real purpose for coming today?

154
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,519
I heard...

155
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,600
Dad said...

156
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,199
you can't take over the company unless you're in a relationship.

157
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,000
So that's why you got a girlfriend.

158
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,560
It's not fake, is it?

159
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,839
What's it to you?

160
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,279
I'm just worried about you.

161
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,800
Why are you snapping at me?

162
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,800
As your sister,

163
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,680
I'm just concerned about your future happiness.

164
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,399
What's wrong?

165
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,600
I'm warning you now.

166
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,839
Don't try any tricks with me.

167
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,879
Brother.

168
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,600
These two...

169
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,720
really are a perfect match.

170
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:42,840
How could I have any ulterior motives?

171
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,480
Should I just tell Dad directly...

172
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,840
that you're deceiving him?

173
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,080
Little sister.

174
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:57,480
What's wrong with you?

175
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,879
I didn't finish my homework.

176
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,759
I'm doomed.

177
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,120
Take mine.

178
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:11,440
But what about you, brother?

179
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,320
It's fine.

180
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,240
Wen Pei'an.

181
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,600
Go get your parents, now.

182
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,919
You've really disappointed me.

183
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,519
Respected Ms. Xiao Yan,

184
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,159
hello.

185
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,360
I am from Class 1, Grade 10,

186
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,639
Wen Pei'an.

187
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,960
I have thoroughly researched

188
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,000
the situations of our two families.

189
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,879
I believe you are the

190
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,240
best candidate to be my future partner.

191
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,159
Therefore,

192
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,440
I wish to discuss with you

193
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,000
a marriage alliance.

194
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,600
Why did you do that just now?

195
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,759
I just wanted to help you.

196
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,000
Wen Pei'an.

197
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,519
Go get your parents, now.

198
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,360
You've really disappointed me.

199
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,879
Can you give this letter to your brother?

200
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:03,720
Sure.

201
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,679
Wen Pei'an's reply to you.

202
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:07,879
Thanks.

203
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,480
Qixing.

204
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,080
Why did you write a reply to her without permission?

205
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,639
Brother.

206
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I just thought...

207
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:27,600
this kind of thing would affect your studies.

208
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,919
That's why I used harsh words.

209
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,399
So...

210
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
You're not...

211
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,879
going to scold me because of her, are you?

212
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:35,759
Wen Pei'an.

213
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,600
Go get your parents, now.

214
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,679
You...

215
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:42,080
You've really disappointed me.

216
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,759
From childhood till now,

217
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,080
my dear little sister

218
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,799
has always used the same method

219
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,559
to make her brother

220
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,519
become a child who disappoints our father.

221
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,840
Now,

222
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,759
she's looking at me with that same expression again.

223
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,000
I won't be fooled by her look anymore.

224
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,559
I already plan to get married.

225
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,879
Believe it or not,

226
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,240
I don't need to prove anything to you.

227
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,200
Then this matter becomes strange.

228
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,200
Actually, Xin Tong invited me here today.

229
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,759
She thought I was your...

230
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,919
ex-girlfriend.

231
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,000
To get me to come as a guest,

232
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,600
she promised

233
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,919
to help you

234
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,559
and me

235
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,519
reconcile.

236
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,799
Then I don't understand

237
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,039
what your girlfriend

238
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,039
means by this.

239
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,759
Is it for the company's sake?

240
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,879
How noble of you.

241
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,600
You look...

242
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,559
a bit upset.

243
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,720
Her pushing you towards someone else...

244
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,759
hurt your pride.

245
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,360
It couldn't be that she's faking it...

246
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:14,480
but you've fallen for real, brother?

247
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:17,840
You knew it was a misunderstanding.

248
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,480
Why did you come to the meeting?

249
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,600
I couldn't just explain the misunderstanding away.

250
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,799
I had to grit my teeth and come.

251
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,679
Otherwise, it would be awkward for you.

252
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:28,759
Besides,

253
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:31,320
I just simply missed you.

254
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,720
You're not going to tattle to Dad, are you?

255
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,759
Brother.

256
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,080
I've grown up.

257
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,480
I will openly take back

258
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,360
everything that originally belonged to me.

259
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:44,759
What things?

260
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,600
Management rights of the company.

261
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:51,519
Can you stop fooling around?

262
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,279
How am I fooling around?

263
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,240
Why is it that when you boys

264
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,559
do something ambitious,

265
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,720
it's called having great aspirations,

266
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,320
but when we girls do it, it's fooling around?

267
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,240
Why?

268
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,879
Dad even said okay!

269
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,679
Xin Tong!

270
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:16,480
Are you okay?

271
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,440
I'm fine.

272
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,639
I just twisted it.

273
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,240
Let me see.

274
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,000
It's nothing.

275
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,240
I have weak ankles.

276
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,080
Let me help you up.

277
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:22,840
Thank you.

278
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,679
Careful.

279
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,399
I already told you.

280
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,480
Qixing is still here.

281
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,080
Put me down.

282
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:42,799
Wait for me to get the bike.

283
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:43,559
Wait for me.

284
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:48,279
Qixing.

285
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,039
Sit, sit, sit.

286
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,159
Sorry about that.

287
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,799
I interrupted your reunion.

288
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,879
It's fine.

289
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,440
Since I signed the contract,

290
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,159
no matter what,

291
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,279
I will fulfill my obligation

292
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,840
to be a guest.

293
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,240
Any number of times is fine.

294
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,600
You...

295
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,320
are even better than I imagined.

296
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:10,960
I'm off.

297
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,080
Bye.

298
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:33,240
Where's Qixing?

299
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,080
Qixing said

300
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,399
she had something to do and left first.

301
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:37,960
Here.

302
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:39,440
I can do it.

303
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:41,320
Slow down.

304
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,279
Sit tight.

305
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:49,519
Let's go.

306
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,360
Stop worrying about my affairs.

307
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,519
Alright?

308
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,440
If you really like Qixing that much,

309
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:07,559
I have a way to persuade the President.

310
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,879
What could you possibly do?

311
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,639
Then don't worry about it.

312
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,399
Slow down a bit.
