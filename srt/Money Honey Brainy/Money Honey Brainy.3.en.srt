00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,719
Email from Galileo

2
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,200
Galileo

3
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,479
Another email.

4
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,280
Such high efficiency.

5
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,759
I've reviewed your proposal.

6
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,600
I want to see

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,200
a report backed by data.

8
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,039
Rejected, right?

9
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:54,799
Data.

10
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,679
Data.

11
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,119
If data is so important,

12
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:58,119
what do you need us for?

13
00:00:58,119 --> 00:00:59,600
Are we just data porters?

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,679
We're not data porters.

15
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,000
We're data's

16
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,760
human hard drives.

17
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:08,000
Calm down.

18
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,120
Six-thirty tonight.

19
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:15,799
See you at Chateau Delight.

20
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,280
I have to work overtime.

21
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:19,319
Might be a bit late.

22
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,480
Not allowed.

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,959
If you're late, your pay gets halved.

24
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:29,519
Have I been cursed with bad romance luck lately?

25
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,799
What kind of scumbags are these males?

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,959
But after all,

27
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,840
he's the Client King.

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,040
Don't worry, babe.

29
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:42,599
I'll get there as soon as I can.

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,039
This refined guy...

31
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,479
When he's not talking,

32
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,759
he's actually quite handsome.

33
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,439
Sorry.

34
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:24,960
Our company

35
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,439
had a visit today from a

36
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,479
perverted chairman.

37
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:28,639
I've been busy the whole time,

38
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,599
so I'm late.

39
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,439
My dad's spies are everywhere.

40
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,639
Tonight is a tough battle.

41
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,039
Stay alert at all times.

42
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,199
Okay.

43
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,919
They seem to be watching us.

44
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,719
What do we do?

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,719
Watch me.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,560
Welcome!

47
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,120
This is your

48
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,039
most correct choice.

49
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,199
Does your family run a security company?

50
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,960
You're really putting on a show.

51
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,240
Contract clause forty-seven:

52
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,919
Do not inquire about the other party's privacy.

53
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:16,400
Then let's go.

54
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,240
This falls under

55
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,960
S+ level intimacy.

56
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,560
It's charged by the second.

57
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,000
Welcome!

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,439
This is your most correct choice.

59
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,479
Are you insane?

60
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,560
This French restaurant...

61
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,240
Their foie gras risotto is delicious.

62
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,159
Try some.

63
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,280
Good evening, sir.

64
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,000
Ah, Miss Coco.

65
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,120
Long time no see.

66
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:50,280
Long time no see.

67
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,120
You know each other?

68
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,240
We're terribly sorry,

69
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,719
but we're fully booked today.

70
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,439
For any inconvenience caused,

71
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,719
we are deeply apologetic.

72
00:03:58,719 --> 00:03:59,439
What?

73
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,919
You're not welcoming me?

74
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,960
The internet celebrity, Miss Coco.

75
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,520
How would we dare?

76
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,759
We can't afford to offend you.

77
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,840
What did you do to this place?

78
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,759
Nothing much.

79
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:11,120
I just wrote an article

80
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,159
when I visited before

81
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,680
and posted it on Little Blue Book.

82
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,719
I just wrote down

83
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,639
my genuine feelings.

84
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,680
I think

85
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,680
you two should go to another restaurant.

86
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:22,600
That Sha County Snacks across the street

87
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,439
looks quite good.

88
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,759
Please call your manager over.

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,519
Thank you.

90
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,319
Sorry,

91
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,240
our manager happens to be out today.

92
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:29,839
Manager!

93
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,519
We just got word.

94
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,439
Pink Chubby Pig,

95
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,519
the influencer blogger,

96
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,920
is also dining at our restaurant today.

97
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,560
The boss told us to prioritize them.

98
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:44,759
Pink Chubby Pig...

99
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,120
...is none other than myself.

100
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,360
You...

101
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,000
Aren't you

102
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,160
Miss Coco?

103
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,120
Also me.

104
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,519
So you're that pig.

105
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,000
Excuse me.

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,600
Sorry, you two.

107
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,639
This table today

108
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,800
was specially reserved for you by our boss.

109
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,600
Please wait a moment.

110
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,519
Come here, quick!

111
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,680
This...

112
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,240
is a little token of appreciation from the boss.

113
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,360
Wishing you both

114
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,120
a pleasant meal.

115
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:04,839
Thank you.

116
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,839
Just standard procedure.

117
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:13,680
Hello?

118
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,199
Chairman.

119
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,399
Over there,

120
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:16,360
everything is deployed.

121
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,720
We've set up a tight net.

122
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,959
Live-streaming the whole thing.

123
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,279
Very good.

124
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,319
What's wrong over there?

125
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:32,160
Why can't I hear their voices?

126
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:32,959
Chairman,

127
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,160
our listening device

128
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,879
has malfunctioned.

129
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,519
But don't worry.

130
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,800
After we get back,

131
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,759
we'll use lip-reading

132
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,759
and translate it for you word for word.

133
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,439
Those two aren't intimate enough.

134
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:02,360
I don't like wasabi.

135
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,480
Deal with it.

136
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,800
Can we have less spice?

137
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,079
No.

138
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,160
Mr. Wen

139
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,399
If there's too much physical contact,

140
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,839
I suggest you choose

141
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:40,720
the time-block

142
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
Worry-Free Package.

143
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,800
There's such a considerate package?

144
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,319
How much does it cost?

145
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,639
I've launched several

146
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,399
packages.

147
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,800
You can take a look.

148
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,360
Give me a brief introduction.

149
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,639
The Worry-Free Package:

150
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,199
Nine hundred and ninety-eight yuan,

151
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,199
four contacts per hour,

152
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,519
buy four get one free.

153
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,000
I think this Delight Package looks good.

154
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,560
Six hundred and ninety-eight yuan,

155
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,519
three times.

156
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,120
If you put it that way,

157
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,639
the Supreme Bliss Package is more cost-effective.

158
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,399
One thousand eight hundred and eighty-eight yuan,

159
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,639
eight times.

160
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,560
You really are a shrewd businessman.

161
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,839
Then the first one.

162
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,720
Nine hundred and ninety-eight yuan.

163
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,639
Remember to go back tonight

164
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,800
and fill out the supplementary contract.

165
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,319
The progress is too slow.

166
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,240
At this rate,

167
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,839
when will we ever kiss?

168
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,519
Why are you in such a hurry?

169
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,920
What do you know?

170
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,800
Nowadays, in everything,

171
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,120
you have to talk about efficiency.

172
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,839
When it comes to dating,

173
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,759
it's even more about efficiency.

174
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:39,959
The emperor isn't anxious,

175
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,319
but the eunuch is.

176
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,680
This date

177
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,120
is way too simple.

178
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,160
What?

179
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,560
At the very least,

180
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,160
we should kiss, right?

181
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,079
Sorry,

182
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,160
we need to kiss.

183
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,879
Are you insane?

184
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:02,639
Five times.

185
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,439
They kissed!

186
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,079
They kissed!

187
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,399
Confirmed, they kissed!

188
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,399
Starting now,

189
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,120
full coverage live broadcast mode.

190
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,240
This is good.

191
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,120
Full coverage.

192
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:56,919
Everyone gets a bonus chicken leg!

193
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,559
Received.

194
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,200
Wrap it up.

195
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,080
Wen Pei'an,

196
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,919
I need to talk to you

197
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,240
about the boundaries of this date.

198
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,440
You...

199
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,879
You're a pervert, aren't you?

200
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,039
Why did you enter my room without knocking?

201
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,399
If I had knocked before entering,

202
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,480
would I have been able to see this?

203
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,519
What do you mean by this?

204
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,360
Aren't you ruining my image?
