1
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,719
How did this happen to you?

2
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,280
Where did you go this afternoon?

3
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,000
Who did this to you?

4
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:52,520
Xin Tong.

5
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,679
I'll be honest with you.

6
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,439
I really have no way out.

7
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:57,320
That's why I came to you.

8
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:58,439
All these years...

9
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:01,039
I've racked up a lot of debt.

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,960
I just wanted to end it all.

11
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:04,959
But I...

12
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,359
I couldn't bear to leave you.

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,920
I just wanted to see you one last time.

14
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,799
Then I could die in peace.

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,400
Stop lying to me.

16
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,159
I went to the police station and asked.

17
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:19,359
They told me...

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,439
you've been gambling all these years.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,439
You gambled away everything we had.

20
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,640
You came to me this time...

21
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,560
because you truly have no way out.

22
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,680
So...

23
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,799
If you can stop gambling,

24
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,120
you can stay here.

25
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:36,840
It's fine.

26
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,519
I'll take good care of you.

27
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,959
But if you keep gambling,

28
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,280
don't expect a single cent from me.

29
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,519
Daughter...

30
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,159
You have to believe me.

31
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,920
I can still turn things around.

32
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,000
I can give you a better life.

33
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,200
I can make up for...

34
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,159
everything I owe you.

35
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,840
Do you have any money?

36
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,680
Ten thousand.

37
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,400
With ten thousand, I can get back...

38
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:03,120
everything I lost before.

39
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,879
You still want to gamble?

40
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,280
Well, in that case...

41
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,639
Get out of my house.

42
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,080
Or I'll call the police.

43
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,080
What did you say?

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,159
I'm your own father!

45
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:15,080
How can you be so heartless?

46
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,159
I said...

47
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,080
if you keep gambling,

48
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,439
get out of my house.

49
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,759
Or I'm calling the police.

50
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:24,479
Fine.

51
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,639
You pauper, you jinx, you're kicking me out?

52
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,680
Alright.

53
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,919
You just wait and see.

54
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,280
Just wait.

55
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,319
Where is Xin Tong?

56
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,240
Where's your boss?

57
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,719
What's going on out there?

58
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,879
I'll go check.

59
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,520
Where is your boss?

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,199
My ungrateful daughter, Xin Tong...

61
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,199
In the middle of the night...

62
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,520
she threw me out!

63
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm her own father!

64
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,280
All night...

65
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,639
I nearly froze to death!

66
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:07,879
You're the boss?

67
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,479
Our President would like to see you.

68
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,639
Let's talk inside.

69
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,360
Okay.

70
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:13,879
Okay.

71
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:17,879
Back to work.

72
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:31,840
Please, have a seat.

73
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,360
May I ask...

74
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,560
who you are?

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,560
I'm Xin Tong's father.

76
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,599
Her biological father.

77
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,400
Biological father.

78
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,479
What do you need?

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,120
You can tell me directly.

80
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,719
You...

81
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,960
do you like Xin Tong?

82
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,399
I won't ask for much.

83
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,879
The bride price...

84
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:21,639
Two hundred thousand.

85
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,279
Agreed.

86
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,360
But this isn't a bride price.

87
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,720
This is you...

88
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,759
making a promise to me.

89
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,759
I don't care what you're doing to Xin Tong now.

90
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,920
Stop this behavior immediately.

91
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:42,959
You're straightforward.

92
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:43,959
So am I.

93
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,879
I agree.

94
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,720
I'll do whatever you say.

95
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,720
Thank you.

96
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,000
Let's go.

97
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,639
I'll take you to the finance department.

98
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:56,879
Alright.

99
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:57,519
No need to see me out.

100
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,120
Don't bother.

101
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,160
Causing a scene at the company...

102
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,800
It's so undignified.

103
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,160
Yeah.

104
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,120
How will she get by now?

105
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,360
Exactly.

106
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:13,519
Let's go over there.

107
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,000
Go, go, go.

108
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,560
Qixing.

109
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,160
Xin Tong.

110
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,160
The data keeps getting better each time.

111
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,480
We're already preparing the victory announcement.

112
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,519
Don't get cocky.

113
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,720
*You* don't get cocky.

114
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,439
How have you been these past couple days?

115
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,040
Are you okay?

116
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,199
I'm doing fine.

117
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,079
They're starting...

118
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,480
to have me review the victory poster.

119
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,519
I need to head over there.

120
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:37,920
Keep it up.

121
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,360
Okay.

122
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,720
What are you doing here?

123
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,519
Who told you to come back?

124
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
Is that any way to talk to your dad?

125
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,000
Your president...

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,040
...is quite interested in you.

127
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,839
Four Seas is a huge conglomerate.

128
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,759
If you two get married in the future,

129
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
then I'll be set for the rest of my life.

130
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:08,519
So,

131
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,439
I've made up my mind.

132
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,000
I'll stay by your side.

133
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,600
I'll take good care of you.

134
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,079
You went to my company?

135
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,639
I did.

136
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,240
Wanted to see where you work.

137
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,439
And get to know your life a bit.

138
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,319
I don't need you to know me.

139
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,839
Where were you all this time?

140
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:23,480
What's with your attitude?

141
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,680
You're my daughter.

142
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,959
Even if the King of Heaven himself came,

143
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:26,839
I'd still be your father.

144
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,160
You have my blood in your veins.

145
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,240
For the rest of my life,

146
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,959
I'm sticking with you.

147
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,240
You're just a scoundrel.

148
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,519
Get out of my house.

149
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,560
Get out!

150
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,560
Get out!

151
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,879
A child hitting their parent, huh?

152
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,560
Just like your mother.

153
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,360
Asking for a beating.

154
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:41,839
Today, I, as your father,

155
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:42,959
will teach you a proper lesson.

156
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:46,959
What are you doing?

157
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,279
Stop hitting me!

158
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:54,079
Stop it!

159
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:54,800
I was wrong.

160
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,639
I was wrong.

161
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
I was wrong! I was wrong!

162
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:02,720
Are you okay?

163
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,160
I knew that jerk wouldn't keep his word.

164
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,519
Get up.

165
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,800
With such a small amount of money,

166
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,680
don't think I'll let you marry my daughter.

167
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,560
What do you want?

168
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,560
Give me one million.

169
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,480
And if I say no?

170
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:23,800
Xin Tong's life...

171
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:24,759
...was given by me.

172
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,560
If you don't care whether I live or die,

173
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,920
I'll take her away.

174
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:29,600
Away.

175
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,879
Away to where?

176
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,480
To...

177
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:34,399
...to Hell.

178
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,199
To jump in a river.

179
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:35,879
To jump off a building.

180
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,120
If I can't live,

181
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,519
she won't get to stay here either.

182
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,199
Why did you...

183
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,680
...give him so much money?

184
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,879
He's just a scoundrel.

185
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,720
I recorded everything just now.

186
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,319
One million.

187
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,439
That's more than enough to sue him for extortion.

188
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,959
I promise you'll never have to see him again.

189
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,120
I'm an expert at fishing.

190
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,199
Thank you.

191
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,959
He's completely different...

192
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,759
...from what I imagined.

193
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,159
Every time I face him,

194
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,120
I feel...

195
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,960
...so utterly powerless.

196
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,720
You're just tired.

197
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,000
Sleep a bit in the car.

198
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,840
I'll take the princess home.

199
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,840
It's okay.

200
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,759
If you keep crying, your makeup will run.

201
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,399
Let's go.

202
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,440
Let's go home.

203
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:55,559
Nowadays,

204
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,279
many people say...

205
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,440
...they seem...

206
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,399
...unable to love others.

207
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:03,159
But I feel that I myself...

208
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,440
...am unable to be loved.

209
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,519
Because I simply don't know...

210
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,799
...what it truly feels like to be loved.

211
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,679
I've imagined countless times...

212
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,720
...what kind of people...

213
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,240
...my parents might be.

214
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,200
But I never imagined they'd be...

215
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,440
...like this.

216
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:24,519
You know,

217
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,559
many people don't understand...

218
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,960
...why I take on so many part-time jobs.

219
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,080
Because I want to work hard to earn money.

220
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,679
And work hard to love myself.

221
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,080
I believed...

222
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,480
...only money could give me a sense of security.

223
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:45,720
But now I realize...

224
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,360
...that's not quite right.

225
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,200
Because you can also give me a sense of security.

226
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,200
But I can't figure out...

227
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,919
I really can't figure out whether...

228
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,399
...it's you who gives me security,

229
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:08,080
or your money that gives me security.

230
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,360
I can understand.

231
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:15,200
I can feel your...

232
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,399
...care for me.

233
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,440
But I don't know how to respond to you.

234
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:24,159
I...

235
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:28,879
It's okay.

236
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,720
Just follow your heart.

237
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,320
Here, have some.

238
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,480
I specifically went to check your birth certificate.

239
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,559
Today is your actual birthday.

240
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,159
Happy birthday.

241
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,840
Thank you.

242
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,679
You messy, crying kitten.

243
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,039
Now you're a messy kitten too.

244
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,360
You really look like a messy kitten.

245
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,879
You're a messy kitten now too.

246
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:24,960
Xin Tong.

247
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:30,799
You can actually open up your heart.

248
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:33,639
Would you...

249
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,600
...try to...

250
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,879
...accept my feelings for you?

251
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,679
I can protect you.

252
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,519
I like you.

253
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,159
You...

254
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,840
Maybe...

255
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,799
I'll give it a try.
