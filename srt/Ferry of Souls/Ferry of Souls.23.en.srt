1
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,479
Miss.

2
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,440
Have you been to this inn before?

3
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,360
Why are you so familiar

4
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,890
with our inn's procedures?

5
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,160
I've been here for many years

6
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,420
and I don't remember ever seeing you.

7
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,000
Fengxin.

8
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,320
Why do you want to kill me?

9
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,700
It's better that you don't remember.

10
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,640
Innkeeper Dongfang.

11
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,370
It's all in the past anyway.

12
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,880
This time,

13
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,320
I must kill you.

14
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,760
What?

15
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,770
Nothing.

16
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,760
I'll go back to my room to rest.

17
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,760
Let me walk you up.

18
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,300
No need.

19
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,320
I know the way.

20
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,640
Dongfang.

21
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,520
I'm sorry.

22
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,640
It's alright.

23
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,600
No matter what happened,

24
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,200
all the love, hate, and grudges are in the past.

25
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,780
Just like you said,

26
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,760
right?

27
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
See you tomorrow.

28
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:16,720
Wait.

29
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,690
You seem to be in a hurry.

30
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,320
Haven't eaten yet, have you?

31
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,600
As the innkeeper,

32
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,360
how could I let a guest

33
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,370
go to bed hungry?

34
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,260
Dongfang Zhaobai, do you know

35
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,840
I came here all for you?

36
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,720
No, that's not right.

37
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,240
Not the you standing before me,

38
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,040
but the you from a thousand years later.

39
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,159
You're drunk.

40
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,900
Leave me alone.

41
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,680
I'm going to kill Dugu Qiongqi.

42
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,680
It was him.

43
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,600
He made me kill you by mistake on our wedding night.

44
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,020
And caused you a thousand years later

45
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,800
to risk your life for me.

46
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,880
I know you won't believe what I'm saying.

47
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,720
I believe you.

48
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,100
I believe you can foresee the future.

49
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,640
I believe you came for me.

50
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,040
And for him.

51
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,920
Since we have a chance to start over,

52
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:45,690
why don't

53
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,880
we change everything together?

54
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,640
You mean...

55
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,040
We just need to stop

56
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,890
Dugu Qiongqi on our wedding night,

57
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,640
right?

58
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,640
Feiye.

59
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,420
Innkeeper.

60
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,300
Innkeeper.

61
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,480
Feiye.

62
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:51,760
Feiye.

63
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,300
Innkeeper.

64
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,960
She went back a thousand years just to save you.

65
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,690
Feiye has already gone back a thousand years.

66
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,380
Aren't you letting her down this way?

67
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,520
She's doing something foolish.

68
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,320
How could I just stand by and do nothing?

69
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,640
Even if I die,

70
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,340
I will never be apart from her.

71
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,920
Why isn't the spirit woman trying to stop Mr. Dongfang?

72
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,880
Indeed,

73
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,080
she actually let him go in.

74
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,720
It's finally coming to an end.

75
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,760
Feiye.

76
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,480
I'm here.

77
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,120
I just need to

78
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,920
stop Dugu Qiongqi

79
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,360
on the wedding night, right?

80
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,980
Innkeeper.

81
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,280
I'm back.

82
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,130
You still came after me.

83
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,920
Fortunately,

84
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,040
I didn't arrive too late.

85
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,810
Otherwise my thousand-year-old self

86
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,810
would have kissed my bride.

87
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,410
Dugu Qiongqi will be here soon.

88
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,820
Innkeeper.

89
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,920
Let's do this.

90
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,040
Madam Ling

91
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,320
It was you all along?

92
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,580
You're the real mastermind behind everything.

93
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,040
Yes, it's me.

94
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,400
It seems

95
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,920
you've prepared quite a show here

96
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,520
waiting to begin.

97
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,360
Unfortunately,

98
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,720
from the very beginning,

99
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,050
you've been waiting for the wrong person.

100
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,540
You've been helping us all along.

101
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,680
Why would you do this?

102
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,240
Why?

103
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,000
So a thousand years ago,

104
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,250
you killed Fengxin and the villagers,

105
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,060
and made me wrongfully kill the people of Dongfang.

106
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,480
It wasn't Dugu Qiongqi.

107
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,720
It was you, wasn't it?

108
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,960
What exactly do you want?

109
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,360
Back then,

110
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,780
because I couldn't obtain the Fire Tree Silver Flower,

111
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,400
I couldn't gain the supreme power.

112
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,170
My demonic powers were sealed,

113
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,280
and I was trapped in this monster inn.

114
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,460
You are the Demon King.

115
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,120
So the missing Demon King

116
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,440
has been trapped in the monster inn.

117
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,840
I had planned to use you all

118
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,880
to enter Liu Yiyi's world again,

119
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,320
remove her obsession,

120
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,160
and bring back the Fire Tree Silver Flower.

121
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,050
But I never expected...

122
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,840
You

123
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,880
have destroyed my treasure!

124
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,220
Could it be that

125
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,920
when Liu Yiyi disappeared years ago,

126
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,250
Dugu Qiongqi trapped us

127
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,960
not to harm us?

128
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,180
Don't you feel like

129
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,160
we've been to this place before?

130
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
To stop Ling Po,

131
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,290
I had to trap you here first.

132
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,040
He wanted to prevent us

133
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,370
from entering Liu Yiyi's timeline again.

134
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,920
Dugu Qiongqi,

135
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,640
you think you can stop me?

136
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,560
You're all completely useless.

137
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,400
A thousand years ago,

138
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,280
I finally managed to use you,

139
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,520
the most powerful demon hunter,

140
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,980
to kill Dongfang Zhaobai.

141
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,690
But I never expected

142
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,680
that before his death,

143
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,000
he would curse you to become the new innkeeper.

144
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
Because of that,

145
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,980
I've been waiting here for a thousand years.

146
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,900
Fortunately, there's Dugu Qiongqi,

147
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,560
this devoted sister who loves her brother,

148
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,920
my perfect pawn.

149
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,480
Hahaha!

150
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,000
I've schemed for a thousand years.

151
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,120
As long as I eliminate

152
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,640
all you innkeepers today,

153
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,600
the demon inn will disappear,

154
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,440
and I'll regain my freedom.

155
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,920
Shangguan Feiye,

156
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,120
Dongfang Zhaobai,

157
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
you can all die!
