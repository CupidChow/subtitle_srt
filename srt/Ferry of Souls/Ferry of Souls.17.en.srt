1
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,130
Mr. Dongfang left early this morning.

2
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,160
He left?

3
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,120
Why didn't he tell me?

4
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,020
What are you thinking?

5
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,560
It couldn't be...

6
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,120
You've known all along that 1,000 years ago

7
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,680
Shangguan Feiye was the one who killed you.

8
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,009
Why are you still getting close to her now?

9
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,880
Because someone like you

10
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,579
doesn't understand what love is.

11
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,440
I don't understand love?

12
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,240
I'm doing this to protect you.

13
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,480
I didn't want her to hurt you again,

14
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,940
so I went to great lengths.

15
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,800
Everything I did was for you.

16
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,820
I won't let you hurt her again.

17
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,920
You want to kill me?

18
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,720
Even if I have to die with you,

19
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,520
I still won't let you hurt her again.

20
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,720
You're willing to give up your life for her.

21
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,100
If that's the case,

22
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,680
then die in her place.

23
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,120
Dongfang.

24
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,400
Are you okay?

25
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,200
Get up.

26
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,250
Take it easy.

27
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,200
Shangguan Feiye.

28
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,880
You finally came.

29
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,280
Dugu Qiongqi.

30
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
It really is you.

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,520
What did you do to Dongfang?

32
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,380
What could I do?

33
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,280
Just old friends catching up.

34
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,880
Reminiscing about the past.

35
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,000
You dare touch my people?

36
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,930
You must be tired of living.

37
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,520
Boss.

38
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,320
What's wrong?

39
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,850
Are you feeling unwell?

40
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,770
Take it slow, let me help you up.

41
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,410
Did you see that?

42
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,040
Why is he here?

43
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,880
So young,

44
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,720
what is he doing?

45
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,280
This is too dangerous.

46
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,440
Record this.

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,130
What could be so bad to make him do this?

48
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,920
Li Wubai.

49
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,800
What happened here?

50
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:26,760
Get him!

51
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,370
Manager.

52
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,640
The person who jumped is my friend.

53
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,500
Please help me.

54
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,940
Dongfang Zhaobai.

55
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,760
What are you doing here?

56
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,800
Are you here for revenge?

57
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,120
Li Wubai.

58
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,920
I haven't even settled scores with you yet.

59
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,200
You're being so desperate to die,

60
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,800
even jumping off a building.

61
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,560
Dongfang.

62
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,800
I'm so sorry.

63
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,440
Don't mention that to me.

64
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,560
Dongfang.

65
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,800
It's all my fault.

66
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,240
I've let you down.

67
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,970
Are you in some kind of trouble?

68
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,050
Tell me about it.

69
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,130
Maybe I can help.

70
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,040
How could you help me?

71
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,880
None of you can help me.

72
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,240
What terrible sin have I committed?

73
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,520
Innkeeper,

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,080
Li Wubai is...

75
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,500
Which one should I wear tomorrow?

76
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,680
This one's not bad.

77
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,450
Isn't this one nice too?

78
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,040
Oh my!

79
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,920
Innkeeper,

80
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,010
now is not the time to discuss this.

81
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,320
You brought him here, you deal with him.

82
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,840
But he's someone I know after all.

83
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,680
Even though he's delirious

84
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,240
and we can't get any answers from him.

85
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,040
But we

86
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,490
can't just abandon him.

87
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,800
He bullied you so much before

88
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,460
and you still want to help him?

89
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,100
Innkeeper.

90
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,720
Does Li Wubai

91
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,960
have some kind of obsession too?

92
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,240
It's not that simple.

93
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,690
It's not just Li Wubai's obsession alone.

94
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,490
Then let's hurry and go.

95
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
What's the rush?

96
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,400
Let me give him a proper welcome first.

97
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,040
Are you looking for light?

98
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,200
Ghost!

99
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,400
How could there be ghosts in a monster inn?

100
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,760
They're all monsters here.

101
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,330
Brother!

102
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,520
I was wrong!

103
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,570
Please spare me!

104
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,600
Dongfang!

105
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,400
Dongfang!

106
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,920
Come save me!

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,460
It was all my fault before.

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,600
What did you do wrong?

109
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm innocent!

110
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,520
Although I

111
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,920
stole Dongfang's lover,

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,960
but that Liu Yiyi

113
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,600
she drove me into a corner!

114
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,400
So?

115
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,560
And?

116
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,760
How did she trick you?

117
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,170
That Liu Yiyi

118
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,520
she's not even human!

119
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,690
At first, she

120
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,120
acted like an innocent rabbit

121
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,580
and did everything I said.

122
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,409
She even said

123
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,240
she'd help me make money in stocks.

124
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,640
But

125
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,800
she ran off with all my money.

126
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,640
She's practically driven me to death now.

127
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,200
I...

128
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,159
I don't believe a word of it.

129
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,560
Your life is mine!

130
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,120
Stay back! Stay back!

131
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,720
Dongfang!

132
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,160
Help me!

133
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:05,800
Li Wubai

134
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,360
You're finally here.

135
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,690
Dongfang

136
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,800
Here

137
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,160
There are monsters here.

138
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,490
Hurry

139
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,680
Take me away quickly.

140
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,280
Sit down.

141
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,680
This is a monster inn.

142
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,320
It's not a place where people get killed.

143
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,080
I don't care.

144
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
Just take me away.

145
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,730
Are you done making a scene?

146
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,080
Li Wubai.

147
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,059
If you trust me,

148
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,520
our Monster Inn

149
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,130
can help you.

150
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,919
Can you help me get my money back?

151
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,600
That depends on how cooperative you are.

152
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,400
I'll cooperate.

153
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,000
I'll definitely cooperate.

154
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,120
I've already witnessed

155
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,520
how powerful your inn is.

156
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,640
Whatever you say,

157
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,900
I'll definitely do it.

158
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,440
For the money we recover,

159
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,920
I want

160
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,120
half of it.

161
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,440
What's with that reaction?

162
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,040
Forget it if you don't agree.

163
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,970
I'll give it.

164
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,330
I'll give it.

165
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,100
We can't guarantee we'll recover the money.

166
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,300
But if we can resolve your obsession,

167
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,320
perhaps

168
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,940
everything will fall into place.

169
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,200
Obsession.

170
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,520
Boss.

171
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,120
You've become quite

172
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,730
skilled at this job now.

173
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,320
I just wonder if this

174
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,450
mission will be difficult.

175
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,520
Boss,

176
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,060
how's the karmic fire on your body? Is it subsiding?

177
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,120
It's strange.

178
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,000
Recently, the karmic fire

179
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,880
has been fading much faster.

180
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,370
It might be completely gone

181
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,300
by the end of this mission.

182
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,040
That's good.

183
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,560
For thousands of years,

184
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,240
humans and demons were separated by a barrier,

185
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,000
never crossing into each other's realm.

186
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,800
Until the Demon King devoured the power of ten thousand demons.

187
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,480
He emerged with overwhelming power

188
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,440
and broke this balance.

189
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,960
Demons rampaged through the human world,

190
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,320
bringing humanity to the brink of extinction.

191
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,960
Fortunately,

192
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,920
demon hunters cared for all living beings

193
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,440
and fought to eliminate the demons.

194
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,080
But the Demon King was too powerful.

195
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,600
Despite their best efforts,

196
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,660
the demon hunters couldn't prevail.

197
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,720
In the end,

198
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,320
the war ended with humanity's devastating defeat,

199
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,520
forcing them to offer tributes to demons for peace.

200
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,080
Today

201
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,600
is once again the day to deliver the tribute.

202
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,800
This year's offering

203
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,800
is the rare treasure 'Fire Tree Silver Flower' that appears once in a thousand years.

204
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,560
Legend has it

205
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,570
it can absorb human obsessions

206
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,130
to nourish demonic powers.

207
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,040
If the Demon King obtains it,

208
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,240
great disaster will spread

209
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,120
with nothing to stop it.

210
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,210
The Fire Tree Silver Flower is priceless.

211
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,440
So many people have their eyes on it.

212
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,460
I'm afraid the escort journey

213
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,860
won't be peaceful.

214
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,840
Liu Yiyi,

215
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,640
Li Wubai,

216
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,440
Wu Hu,

217
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,180
Chen Jiang,

218
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,600
who are escorting the gift this time, are the four greatest masters of our time.

219
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,200
Brother, you worry too much.

220
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,300
I never thought

221
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,640
that Li Wubai and Liu Yiyi from a thousand years ago

222
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,700
were actually martial arts masters.

223
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,880
Boss,

224
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,440
why are you stepping on me?

225
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,500
Dongfang Zhaobai,

226
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,040
you volunteered to come with me this time.

227
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,400
It's not because of Liu Yiyi, is it?

228
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,200
Of course not.

229
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,530
It's because...

230
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,000
Because what?

231
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,880
You're the boss!

232
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,480
If something happened to you,

233
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,480
I'd be out of a job.

234
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
Hey, where are you going?

235
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,570
Don't follow me.

236
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,800
Come take a look!

237
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,280
Come see!

238
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,760
The most beautiful clothes with the latest styles.

239
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,480
Come see, don't miss out!

240
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:16,960
What?

241
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,480
Boss,

242
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,690
today is the Qixi Festival.

243
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,720
Let's go to the lantern festival together.

244
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,520
I'm not going.

245
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,960
Are you still mad at me?

246
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,620
No, I'm not.

247
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,800
How did you know I was thirsty?

248
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,400
Thank you.

249
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,200
Guess

250
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:48,920
what this is.

251
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,720
I won't guess.

252
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,840
Oh come on, just take a guess.

253
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,640
What is it?

254
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,360
A bug, a mouse, or a snake?

255
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,600
Is that really how you see me?

256
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,480
Do you like it?

257
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,280
It's alright.

258
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,620
Not angry anymore?

259
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,360
Considering you've been quite thoughtful,

260
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,290
I'll let you off the hook this time.

261
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,920
So you've accepted all the gifts,

262
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,180
and your anger is gone.

263
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,280
Let's go to the lantern festival together.

264
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,560
What lantern festival?

265
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,880
Today is the Qixi lantern festival.

266
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,880
It's very lively.

267
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,560
I've lived for a thousand years.

268
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,600
I've seen everything.

269
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,130
Why should I join the crowd?

270
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:49,800
Boss.

271
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,780
I've been working for you for so long.

272
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,200
Come with me to the lantern festival.

273
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,680
Consider it an employee benefit.

274
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,080
What do you say?
