1
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,320
Madam Ling.

2
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,180
What's wrong with the innkeeper?

3
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,000
This is...

4
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,160
Innkeeper.

5
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,120
Feiye.

6
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:06,880
Take care.

7
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,520
No demon has ever

8
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,780
escaped from my grasp, Shangguan Feiye.

9
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,000
Fengxin.

10
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,120
Fengxin.

11
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,360
Fengxin.

12
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,800
Fengxin.

13
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,560
Fengxin.

14
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,320
Fengxin.

15
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,120
Wake up!

16
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,320
Fengxin.

17
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,980
This is the innkeeper's past.

18
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,200
It's me.

19
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,600
Did I know her before?

20
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,680
That's right.

21
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,000
You saved Feiye when she was dying.

22
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,440
You brought her back to the inn

23
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,900
and took great care of her.

24
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,920
So beautiful.

25
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,280
You once shared a wonderful time together.

26
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:56,140
Unfortunately, it didn't last long.

27
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,440
She killed me with her own hands.

28
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,080
I was the one who saved Feiye.

29
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,740
I am the real owner of this inn.

30
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,170
You saw everything.

31
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,600
So when you first met me,

32
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,860
you already knew who I was.

33
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,800
What about Shangguan Feiye?

34
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,060
Why did she find me?

35
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,340
Does she want to kill me again?

36
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,400
What do you feel?

37
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,880
Will she hurt you again

38
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,210
like she did before?

39
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,040
I don't know.

40
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,320
Is what your eyes see

41
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,800
necessarily the truth?

42
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,760
Sometimes certain things

43
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,400
need to be felt with your heart.

44
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,260
What are you doing?

45
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,260
I know everything now.

46
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,610
Oh my!

47
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,400
That's great.

48
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,280
The shopkeeper has finally found love.

49
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,280
Nonsense.

50
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,520
The shopkeeper has lived for a thousand years.

51
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,040
And now blooming like an iron tree for this intern.

52
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,600
No way.

53
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,240
Look.

54
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,120
For a thousand years,

55
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,200
you've been going through all this.

56
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,520
It's fine.

57
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,930
I'm used to it by now.

58
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,720
What's wrong?

59
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,860
Are you scared?

60
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,120
You were the bride who killed me.

61
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,050
So you know everything.

62
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,720
Yes, it was me.

63
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,760
So what?

64
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,300
Do you regret staying?

65
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,010
Or are you afraid

66
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,320
that I'll kill you again

67
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,930
like I did a thousand years ago?

68
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,600
Feiye.

69
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,740
Why do you always push me away?

70
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,320
Didn't you always want to leave?

71
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,420
Dongfang Zhaobai.

72
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,900
Today I'm giving you a chance.

73
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:32,960
Go.

74
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,000
This is your last chance.

75
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,440
Leave now.

76
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,240
While I still have patience.

77
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,400
I thought you left.

78
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,220
Who said I left?

79
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,560
I've decided to stay at the inn.

80
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,490
To stay with you.

81
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,940
Aren't you afraid I'll use you again?

82
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,880
Then keep using me.

83
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,000
Just don't throw me away.

84
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,320
Otherwise...

85
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,120
I'll tell

86
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,640
everyone at the inn

87
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,280
about the customer complaints.

88
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,080
You dare threaten me,

89
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,320
you rookie?

90
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,520
In front of me, the former innkeeper,

91
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,780
who's the rookie here?

92
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,140
Innkeeper,

93
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,680
can I ask you something serious?

94
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,360
The matter with the Frost Demon

95
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,220
has been successfully resolved.

96
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,020
Since that obsession is gone,

97
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,540
why did Mei Jiulang

98
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,650
suddenly attack you back then?

99
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,240
Everything

100
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,560
might be related to that person from a thousand years ago.

101
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,120
A thousand years ago?

102
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,880
It's nothing.

103
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,170
I hope I'm overthinking it.

104
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,250
Don't worry.

105
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,600
Mr. Dongfang.

106
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,480
Oh my!

107
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,730
You and our manager are just

108
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,520
a perfect match,

109
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,120
made in heaven,

110
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,280
a match made for each other.

111
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,040
The newcomer

112
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,100
is already sucking up to the manager.

113
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,520
There's nothing between me and the manager.

114
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,120
Please don't spread rumors.

115
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,280
Then why is the manager treating you so specially?

116
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,140
Yeah, exactly.

117
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,280
After all, I was once

118
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,410
the former manager of the Monster Inn.

119
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,720
What?

120
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,760
You were the former manager?

121
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,320
Uh...

122
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,680
Mr. Dongfang,

123
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,760
you've remembered everything?

124
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,490
I've heard a little bit.

125
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,340
What happened to all of you a thousand years ago?

126
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,040
Why did the innkeeper want to kill me?

127
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,960
When I came to the inn,

128
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,440
you had already been dealt with by the innkeeper.

129
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,000
By that time, the inn was already

130
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,920
under the innkeeper's management.

131
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,600
Haha!

132
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,500
As for me...

133
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,880
I arrived later than that bootlicker,

134
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,940
so I know even less.

135
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,240
Besides, I've been staying at this Monster Inn

136
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,480
just waiting for the innkeeper

137
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,800
to break the curse

138
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,800
and vanish into thin air,

139
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,920
so I can inherit this business.

140
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,250
Oh my,

141
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,480
you shouldn't say that!

142
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,680
Vanish into thin air?

143
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,210
Isn't the innkeeper immortal?

144
00:12:59,160 --> 00:12:59,760
Dongfang,

145
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,440
we've only heard rumors.

146
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,600
The innkeeper, because of a curse,

147
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,760
has been trapped in this Monster Inn for a thousand years.

148
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,680
If by chance,

149
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,280
once the curse is broken,

150
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,880
the innkeeper will...

151
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,810
What do you mean?

152
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,020
What curse?

153
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,480
I really don't know.

154
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,920
I was just making it up.

155
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,680
Please don't slip up and tell the manager.

156
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,160
Right.

157
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,920
We just accidentally

158
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,840
overheard the conversation between the medium and the manager.

159
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,720
What if this curse isn't real?

160
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,320
What if it's just a legend?

161
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,720
Right?

162
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,600
Haha.

163
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,330
This is impossible.

164
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,280
Mr. Dongfang.

165
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,080
Mr. Dongfang.

166
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,000
It's over.

167
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,640
It's over.

168
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,080
It's all your fault for talking too much.

169
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,360
I didn't do it on purpose.

170
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,020
Well, I did it on purpose then.

171
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,800
Oh my!

172
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,480
Ling Po.

173
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,850
I have something to ask you.

174
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,600
Manager Dongfang.

175
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,800
I didn't expect

176
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,680
we would meet again so soon.

177
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,360
Why was Shangguan Feiye cursed?

178
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,280
Why is she burned by karmic fire?

179
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,960
After the curse is lifted,

180
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,020
will she really vanish into thin air?

181
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,440
So you've heard everything.

182
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,440
So all of this is true.

183
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,280
Not entirely.

184
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:14,880
Ling Po,

185
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,810
please tell me everything.

186
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,920
Shangguan

187
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,560
was indeed cursed.

188
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,480
That's how she became the owner of the Monster Inn.

189
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,480
Ageless and immortal.

190
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,320
But she's trapped in the Monster Inn

191
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,000
because of the mistakes she made in the past.

192
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,880
A thousand years ago,

193
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,480
Shangguan Feiye

194
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,080
was the strongest monster hunter in the world.

195
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,540
She made it her mission to kill all monsters.

196
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,560
Regardless of whether they were good or evil,

197
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,690
she killed them all.

198
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,960
Eventually, because of her excessive killing,

199
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,600
the resentment of the monsters she killed backfired on her,

200
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,880
cursing her.

201
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,840
Every so often, she's burned by karmic fire.

202
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,450
The pain is unbearable.

203
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,930
At the same time,

204
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,160
the curse also made her someone who could

205
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,220
resolve the obsessions of her guests as the innkeeper.

206
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,210
This is how she atones for her sins.

207
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,320
Being the innkeeper, for her,

208
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,080
is both a curse

209
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,160
and also a form of protection.

210
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,860
So after all these obsessions are resolved,

211
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,880
will she really vanish into thin air?
