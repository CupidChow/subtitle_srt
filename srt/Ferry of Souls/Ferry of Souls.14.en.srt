1
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,170
Bootlicker.

2
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,370
You try it first.

3
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,610
Bootlicker.

4
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,000
It's good.

5
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,730
Just a bit salty.

6
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:45,960
Granny.

7
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,290
You try some too.

8
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,040
I'm getting old.

9
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,920
My teeth aren't good anymore.

10
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,250
I'll go get my dentures.

11
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,880
I'll be right back.

12
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,280
Is it really that bad?

13
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,210
Let's forget it.

14
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,360
I'll make noodles for everyone.

15
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,490
Noodles are easier to digest at night.

16
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,840
Noodles.

17
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,760
Noodles.

18
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,530
Just add some water to the rice.

19
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,010
This hairpin

20
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,480
really suits you.

21
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,160
Everything looks good on me.

22
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,760
Did you know from the beginning

23
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,530
that I was impersonating Zou Haitang?

24
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,960
No matter how you change your appearance,

25
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,690
I can recognize you at a glance.

26
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,760
What are you thinking about?

27
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,290
Do you think Tao Shi,

28
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,089
Mei Jiulang,

29
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,459
Zou Haitang and the others

30
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,959
used to hate me back then?

31
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,820
Haven't we already

32
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,120
helped them resolve their obsessions?

33
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,090
For thousands of years,

34
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,960
I always thought

35
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,090
that between myself and demons

36
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:40,280
was a conflict between good and evil.

37
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,920
But

38
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,400
since you came to the inn,

39
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,080
when you showed me clearly

40
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,400
their past,

41
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,800
I finally understood

42
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,159
what was behind

43
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,580
all those obsessions.

44
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,840
I wonder

45
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,240
if I had understood

46
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,940
their hardships a thousand years ago

47
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,260
and resolved their obsessions then,

48
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,040
would they

49
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,200
have had to suffer in this life?

50
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,360
Some things

51
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,600
take time to understand.

52
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,290
You've paid a price for that too, haven't you?

53
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,880
Dongfang,

54
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,960
what if someday,

55
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,700
I mean, just hypothetically,

56
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,960
if I were to vanish into thin air,

57
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,240
would you look for me?

58
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
Of course I would.

59
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,159
I might not recognize you in disguise,

60
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,159
but I'd definitely know your ashes.

61
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,120
What's wrong with you?

62
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,020
Don't think about sneaking food behind my back.

63
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,040
Don't worry.

64
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,780
Just stay here peacefully

65
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,940
and continue being

66
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,920
the innkeeper.

67
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,860
Innkeeper.

68
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,820
What's the matter?

69
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,290
I don't have much time left.

70
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,360
Please let me go back.

71
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,890
Back to the past?

72
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,720
Forget about saving that demon sword.

73
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,600
You might not even make it back yourself.

74
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,060
Don't even think about it.

75
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,600
No.

76
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,760
Don't leave me.

77
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,300
Even if I don't live to become the innkeeper myself,

78
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,280
I will still save you.

79
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,480
You're not the owner of this inn.

80
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,840
You forced your way here.

81
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,460
You won't be able to go where you want.

82
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,420
You might even lose your life.

83
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,440
Why be so persistent?

84
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,160
Who are you?

85
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,460
You don't need to know who I am.

86
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,410
You only need to know

87
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,940
that I'm someone who can make your wishes come true.

88
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,520
Really?

89
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,650
As long as...

90
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,480
Boss,

91
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,960
good morning.

92
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,420
Why are you still here?

93
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,610
I specially prepared this for you.

94
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,100
Changed your mind?

95
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,760
I know you're just looking out for me.

96
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,360
I won't be stubborn anymore.

97
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,080
Good that you understand.

98
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,410
Don't be foolish again.

99
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,480
Go now.

100
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,840
Zhu Niaoniao,

101
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,340
get me a glass of water.

102
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,200
Coming.

103
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,340
Why so obedient today?

104
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,600
Hey, it's full!

105
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,200
It's full.

106
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,520
What's wrong?

107
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,420
You look like you've seen a ghost.

108
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,250
Bootlicker.

109
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,800
I think I've messed up.

110
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,240
Really messed up.

111
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,800
You bitch!

112
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,420
You harbinger of doom!

113
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,380
I'll teach you a lesson today!

114
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,980
Everyone, come quick!

115
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,280
Come and see!

116
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,920
It's this wretched woman

117
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,600
who killed my son on his wedding night!

118
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,400
Dongfang!

119
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,440
Dongfang!

120
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,320
Dongfang!

121
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,680
Dongfang!

122
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,820
Stop shouting.

123
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,210
I heard everything.

124
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,280
Dongfang!

125
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,360
Is the innkeeper going to be alright?

126
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,840
Yang is my husband.

127
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,080
How could I poison him?

128
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,210
How dare you deny it!

129
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,040
I'll teach you a lesson!

130
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,440
What are you trying to do?

131
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,180
You claim she killed your son.

132
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,400
Where's your evidence?

133
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,760
You make accusations with no proof

134
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,020
just to frame someone.

135
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,280
My son was fine before entering the bridal chamber.

136
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,610
How did he suddenly die?

137
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,160
There was only this wretched woman in the room.

138
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,600
Who else could it be?

139
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,160
So you have no evidence.

140
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,160
It's nothing but your imagination.

141
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,210
Who do you think you are?

142
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,250
What business do you have here?

143
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,130
Are you okay?

144
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,570
Why are you here?

145
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,520
The little pig spirit already told me everything.

146
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,050
Now is not the time to discuss this.

147
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,250
I am Zhu Niaoniao's sister.

148
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,560
What does this have to do with me?

149
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,020
You're talking nonsense.

150
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,200
Her sister Yunniang died long ago.

151
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,060
Her body has already decomposed.

152
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,320
Yunniang?

153
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,760
You really are a fraud.

154
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,480
Even her sister Yunniang doesn't know.

155
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,240
You're all in this together!

156
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,280
Oh my goodness!

157
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,280
My poor son,

158
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,600
so young and already a scholar,

159
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
yet he died at

160
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,080
Take them all away!

161
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,040
the hands of this wicked woman!

162
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,040
Heaven help me!

163
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,040
Take them all!

164
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,380
What are you doing?

165
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,560
What are you doing?

166
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,240
Let go of me!

167
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,040
What's going on here?

168
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,520
Back to the inn.

169
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:46,880
Hey!

170
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,360
Are we just leaving her?

171
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,240
Why should we care about her?

172
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,320
The little pig spirit told me everything.

173
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,960
I think she has a deep obsession.

174
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,160
Why don't we help her?

175
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,920
Right now we need to quickly investigate

176
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,920
the truth behind Scholar Yang's death.

177
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,980
And that Yunniang,

178
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,440
I wonder if she's connected to all this.

179
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,400
Yunniang?

180
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,680
Are you talking about

181
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,240
Auntie Zhu's daughter?

182
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,260
My daughter died long ago.

183
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,010
Why are you looking for her?

184
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,320
What about Zhu Niaoniao?

185
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,160
Don't mention that ungrateful creature to me.

186
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,420
My daughter kindly took her in years ago,

187
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,120
treated her like a real sister,

188
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,180
but what happened?

189
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,040
On my daughter's wedding night,

190
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,040
she disappeared.

191
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,560
She insisted on marrying my daughter's husband,

192
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,280
her brother-in-law Yang Zhiyuan.

193
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,280
Does she have any conscience at all?

194
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,480
Could it be that Scholar Yang and Yunniang

195
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,480
were once lovers?

196
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,280
Hurry up, innkeeper!

197
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,100
How is it going?

198
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,040
This wound looks like it was made by a butcher's knife.

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,520

00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,940
Useless thing.

201
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
Who are you calling useless?
