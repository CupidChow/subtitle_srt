1
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,259
What are you doing?

2
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,140
Don't move.

3
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,479
Boss,

4
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,680
this is the couple I told you about.

5
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,800
Their cooking skills are exceptional,

6
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,330
definitely better than anyone in our troupe.

7
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,360
Perfect appearance, aroma, and taste.

8
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:13,960
Well then,

9
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,240
stay and help us for a couple of days.

10
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,690
Thank you, boss.

11
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
There's a side room in the back yard.

12
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,240
You two can stay there,

13
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,300
so you'll be available whenever needed.

14
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,900
We'll definitely be at your service.

15
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,200
Brother-in-law,

16
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,920
drink up!

17
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,880
Ha ha ha!

18
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,800
Well, I must say,

19
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,260
Jiulang's performance today

20
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,160
is more flavorful than usual.

21
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,440
Look at that!

22
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,260
As expected of Master Mei,

23
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,580
his singing skills have improved again.

24
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,200
What's wrong?

25
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,530
This Mei Jiulang

26
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,420
seems different from what we saw before.

27
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,520
Excellent!

28
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,079
Bravo!

29
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,320
Good!

30
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,640
Reward him!

31
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,840
Give him a generous reward!

32
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,320
Today's performance,

33
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,120
though performed by Master Mei,

34
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,720
has more charm than usual.

35
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,800
Don't you all agree?

36
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,640
Indeed.

37
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,850
This is Mei Jiulang's room.

38
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,040
It's so tidy.

39
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,659
Does he have OCD or something?

40
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,400
Today,

41
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,800
didn't Mei Jiulang ask Su Huasheng to buy rouge?

42
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,080
He got scolded for it too.

43
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,840
Is this it?

44
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,240
Should be.

45
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,120
Mei Jiulang brought it back and used it.

46
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,160
What are you doing?

47
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,000
This is for women.

48
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,400
Try it.

49
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,530
See how it feels.

50
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,250
That'll cost you extra.

51
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,640
You actually look quite cute like this.

52
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,090
But when you speak, you sound like a demon.

53
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,640
What are you thinking about?

54
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,570
Nothing.

55
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,570
It smells terrible.

56
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,800
Like lard.

57
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,880
Apart from his voice issues,

58
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,570
a famous actor like Mei Jiulang

59
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,400
would be extremely particular about his makeup products.

60
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,930
He wouldn't casually use inferior products.

61
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,640
Unless...

62
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,960
Someone is impersonating Mei Jiulang.

63
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,680
This teacup and the teapot in the kitchen are clearly a set.

64
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,400
They must be exclusively for Mei Jiulang's use.

65
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,600
Could someone

66
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,240
be trying to prevent Mei Jiulang from performing tonight?

67
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,440
They intended to tamper with the teapot,

68
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,320
but unexpectedly,

69
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,780
we accidentally broke it.

70
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,360
Who exactly is trying to stop

71
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,650
Mei Jiulang from performing tonight?

72
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,360
Master Jiu,

73
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,090
you're back.

74
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,100
Look at you trembling.

75
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,640
What are you afraid of?

76
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,159
I'm here.

77
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,490
I'll protect your life.

78
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,040
I'm nervous.

79
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,600
Finally.

80
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,799
Finally my turn to sit here.

81
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,720
Haha!

82
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,320
Senior.

83
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,500
It's actually him.

84
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,120
Those people sitting down there watching the show today,

85
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,039
they claim to be your fans.

86
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,120
Haha!

87
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,200
I spit on that!

88
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,180
I deliberately misplaced my beauty mark today.

89
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,400
Not a single person noticed.

90
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,280
Their love for you is all fake.

91
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,360
Haha!

92
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,400
What is Su Huasheng up to?

93
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,080
Where is Mei Jiulang?

94
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,640
Am I not

95
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,360
your most devoted fan?

96
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,320
It wasn't in vain that I spent

97
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,160
day and night imitating your singing style.

98
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,120
This day

99
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,840
has finally come in handy.

100
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,280
Oh, right.

101
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,040
Senior.

102
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,040
Today,

103
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,860
all the audience members were saying...

104
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,120
They said

105
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,400
Jiulang seems to sing better than before.

106
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
Did you hear that?

107
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,720
Ten times better than you.

108
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,280
No, not ten times.

109
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,610
A hundred times better!

110
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,520
Who is it?

111
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,560
Jiulang.

112
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,040
Who's there?

113
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,400
Hehe.

114
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,970
It's the troupe master.

115
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,640
What is it?

116
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,080
Jiulang.

117
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,040
Today

118
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,180
the Minister is in a good mood.

119
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,920
He says tonight

120
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,400
he wants to invite you

121
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,720
to perform at his mansion again.

122
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,800
He also says

123
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,730
it's only been a few days

124
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,920
but your singing skills have improved considerably.

125
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,920
The Minister really misses you.

126
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,640
Alright.

127
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,570
Get ready early.

128
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,160
A carriage from his mansion will pick you up tonight.

129
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,680
You'll certainly get your share of the reward.

130
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,280
Sing well.

131
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,800
Don't ruin our Ruichun Garden's reputation

132
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,240
or your own name.

133
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,120
Don't worry.

134
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,080
I won't ruin our reputation.

135
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,880
You can see how much they love me.

136
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,610
Alright.

137
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,620
I need to get ready now.

138
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,000
What is Su Huasheng up to?

139
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,880
Let's follow him and see.

140
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,560
Boss, my leg is numb.

141
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,220
Wait for me.

142
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,640
Boss.

143
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,340
Follow him.

144
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,460
It's an ice cellar.

145
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,160
I think so.

146
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,680
Let's go down and take a look.

147
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:22,960
What's wrong?

148
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,680
It's too high.

149
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,850
Fear of heights?

150
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,400
Come here.

151
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,410
Hold on to me.

152
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,620
Holding tight.

153
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,160
We're here.
