1
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,840
She's coming.

2
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,200
She's here.

3
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,330
Protect the master!

4
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,560
Please don't kill me.

5
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,720
Spare me!

6
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,860
Don't move.

7
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,920
Ouch!

8
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,040
Take it easy!

9
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,570
Can't you be more manly?

10
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,680
Master Zou.

11
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,120
The man-eating demon shouldn't appear again tonight.

12
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
Yes, yes.

13
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,240
Thank you both, masters.

14
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,660
Tonight was

15
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,040
extremely dangerous indeed.

16
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,280
From now on, you must be extra cautious.

17
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,360
Inform us of any unusual situations.

18
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,320
Yes, of course.

19
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,240
Also,

20
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,079
For your safety,

21
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,800
there are some things

22
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,760
I must tell you.

23
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,760
After the man-eating demon appeared tonight,

24
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,680
it seems that from beginning to end,

25
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,079
you were its only target.

26
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,120
Master,

27
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,360
what are you implying?

28
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,520
Is there

29
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,079
something you're not telling us?

30
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,840
What does this have to do with me?

31
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,560
Demons kill people.

32
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,090
There's nothing more to it.

33
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,320
Both of you went through a lot

34
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,140
to protect me tonight.

35
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,160
I think

36
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,079
I'll go rest now.

37
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,460
He probably won't tell the truth.

38
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,690
Don't worry.

39
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,480
Since the man-eating monster transformed from Miss Zou,

40
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,040
we can investigate Jinxiu Tower tonight.

41
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,720
Let's see if

42
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,410
we can find any clues there.

43
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,010
So this is Jinxiu Tower.

44
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,720
It's so magnificent.

45
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,610
Let's go.

46
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:32,760
Innkeeper.

47
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,890
There's a lock on it.

48
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,530
Impressive.

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,930
Why is it so cold and gloomy in here?

50
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,860
And there's only one bedroom.

51
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,740
This hardly looks like a bedroom.

52
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,720
It's clearly a gilded birdcage.

53
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,800
I think

54
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,650
it looks more like a prison.

55
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Dawn is breaking.

56
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,170
Let's hurry and look for clues.

57
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,300
Innkeeper.

58
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,600
So many gold and silver jewelry.

59
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Miss Zou is gone.

60
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,460
Why didn't Mr. Zou put these away?

61
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,560
This looks

62
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,820
like Miss Zou deliberately hid them.

63
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,140
Perhaps for emergencies?

64
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
That's possible.

65
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,490
Let's keep looking.

66
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,680
Boss.

67
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,020
Here's a bracelet.

68
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,810
There are two characters on it.

69
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,159
Haitang.

70
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,300
This bracelet must have been made

71
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,560
by someone very close to her.

72
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,720
Boss.

73
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,530
Have you noticed

74
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,760
that in this entire embroidery tower,

75
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,760
there are no eating utensils at all?

76
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,560
So that's how she died.

77
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,520
She was starved to death.

78
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,040
No movement outside.

79
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,600
Everything is safe for now.

80
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,040
Open the door quickly.

81
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,960
Let's hurry.

82
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,460
Please be careful.

83
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,480
These teeth marks...

84
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,080
She must have hallucinated from hunger

85
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,440
and in extreme agony,

86
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,680
bit into this.

87
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,600
The Zou family is so wealthy.

88
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,730
How could anyone starve to death here?

89
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,400
There's another strange thing.

90
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,600
Someone

91
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,480
seems to have never appeared at all.

92
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,320
Who?

93
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,400
The magistrate's son who was to marry Miss Zou.

94
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,600
Right.

95
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,220
This person

96
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,980
only exists in people's conversations.

97
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,140
It's very suspicious.

98
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,400
Let's go.

99
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,010
Follow them.

100
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,410
The old fox can't hold back.

101
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,400
Let's follow and see.

102
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,060
Innkeeper,

103
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
what should we do?

104
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,600
Follow me.

105
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,820
Innkeeper!

106
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,530
You dare to show up at my door again?

107
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,040
This was purely an accident.

108
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,260
I don't know why

109
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,360
Haitang

110
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,020
suddenly turned into a man-eating monster.

111
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,690
I don't want to hear your explanation.

112
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,520
My poor son

113
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,360
died so young.

114
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,120
It was you

115
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,040
who begged me.

116
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,360
You promised to give your daughter to my son in a ghost marriage.

117
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,250
His son is already dead.

118
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,400
Your promise

119
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,480
cannot be fulfilled now.

120
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,960
Heaven knows my heart!

121
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,600
I was truly sincere

122
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,680
about arranging the marriage between your son

123
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,640
and our Haitang.

124
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,220
To meet the auspicious wedding date,

125
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,600
I forced her to go without food or water for seven days and nights.

126
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,160
When I saw she had breathed her last,

127
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,600
only then did I notify you

128
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,000
to come for the bride.

129
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,760
Beast!

130
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,000
You don't deserve to be a father,

131
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,760
killing your own daughter.

132
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,450
Who knows what tricks you've been playing

133
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,200
to deceive me.

134
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,760
Oh my!

135
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,920
I've damaged my karma by doing this.

136
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,560
How would I dare deceive you?

137
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,040
Don't kill me.

138
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,260
Isn't this your daughter?

139
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,480
Hurry!

140
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,920
Drive her away.

141
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,400
Let her go.

142
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,730
She's a monster now.

143
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,400
I talk to her,

144
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,960
but she won't listen.

145
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,600
Don't kill me.

146
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,200
Don't kill me.

147
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,760
Don't kill me.

148
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,480
Don't kill me.

149
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,560
Stop hurting people.

150
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,700
Innkeeper!

151
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,320
Look out!

152
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,620
In just one day,

153
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,660
how did she increase her demonic powers so much?

154
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,090
Could it be that man in black again?

155
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,540
Innkeeper!

156
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,680
Run!

157
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,920
Go join your son.

158
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,360
Look,

159
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,400
what mother has brought for you.

160
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,040
You beast!

161
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,960
You ungrateful wretch!

162
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,040
I spent so much effort

163
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,040
and money

164
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,480
raising you to be beautiful as a flower,

165
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,080
yet you show no gratitude.

166
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,000
I should have ended your life long ago.

167
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,520
Shut up!

168
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,850
Someone like you

169
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,770
doesn't deserve to be a father.

170
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,000
Haitang.

171
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,080
That bracelet of yours...
