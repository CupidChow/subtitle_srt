1
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,600
This place again.

2
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,880
Who is she?

3
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,640
Why do you want to kill me?

4
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,930
Another nightmare?

5
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,410
I still couldn't see the bride's face.

6
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,620
If this continues,

7
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,160
I'm going to lose my mind.

8
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,370
Don't worry.

9
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,020
Have some water first.

10
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,620
This is a normal reaction to extreme stress.

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,720
It's hard to distinguish between fantasy and reality.

12
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,320
How can I get rid of them completely?

13
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,320
As long as you stay here and continue treatment,

14
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:24,600
Oh no.

15
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,000
everything will be fine.

16
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,539
It's Yiyi's birthday.

17
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,080
Hello.

18
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,570
The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

19
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,400
That dress just now was really beautiful.

20
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,160
I like it.

21
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,000
Dongfang.

22
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,490
What a coincidence.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What are you doing?

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,840
What do you mean?

25
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,039
We're good brothers.

26
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,700
You clearly know I've always liked Yiyi.

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
I thought you

28
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,760
were always obsessing over that stupid dream

29
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,000
about the inn

30
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,760
and the faceless bride.

31
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,560
I thought you'd freed yourself from worldly desires,

32
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,680
so why are you still hung up on these mundane matters?

33
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,199
Stop changing the subject.

34
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,060
I know all about

35
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,880
your affairs.

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm asking you:

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,680
Are you serious about Liu Yiyi?

38
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,760
Oh my God,

39
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,560
bro.

40
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,079
When have I not been serious about women?

41
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,400
With women,

42
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,610
you need to shower them with money.

43
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,970
From now on, you'll work for me.

44
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,320
Let me go!

45
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,400
Get him!

46
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,600
Let me go!

47
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,250
Have you mistaken me for someone else?

48
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,380
Dongfang Zhaobai.

49
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,660
How do you know my name?

50
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,050
From today onwards,

51
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,480
you belong to me.

52
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,680
I'll train you well.

53
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,900
You were just lecturing me

54
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,010
but you're the one who hooked up with a rich woman.

55
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,240
I have a bad temper.

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,610
I don't like repeating myself.

57
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,000
So listen carefully.

58
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,360
Dongfang Zhaobai is with me,

59
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,650
and if you dare bully him again,

60
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,120
they

61
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,640
won't be as polite as I am.

62
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,880
Stay back!

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,680
Who are you?

64
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,240
Where are you taking me?

65
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,600
To where you belong.

66
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,860
Thanks for your help just now.

67
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,060
From now on,

68
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,840
you'll be my personal driver,

69
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,600
work secretary,

70
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,000
and personal assistant.

71
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,180
In other words,

72
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,640
a servant.

73
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,640
Servant.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,240
No.

75
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,610
This makes no sense.

76
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,640
Who are you anyway?

77
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,970
Where are you taking me?

78
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,800
Monster Inn.

79
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,880
Kill me.

80
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,160
Do it.

81
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,920
Kill him.

82
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,320
He's the real culprit.

83
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,440
Kill him.

84
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,840
Welcome to the Monster Inn.

85
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,580
Who are you really?

86
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,760
I'm the innkeeper here,

87
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,680
Shangguan Feiye.

88
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,120
Could it be

89
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,890
she's the one who killed me in my dream?

90
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,440
You're awake.

91
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,720
Don't come any closer!

92
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,580
That one is from the Qing Dynasty,

93
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,780
and that's from the Song Dynasty.

94
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,080
I helped you.

95
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,930
It's fine if you don't thank me,

96
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,160
but why?

97
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,090
You still want to hit me?

98
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,820
Are you human or demon?

99
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,640
What exactly do you want from me?

100
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,280
Do you really want to know?

101
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,880
Of course.

102
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,159
I am not a demon.

103
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,760
But I'm not human either.

104
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,320
All these years,

105
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,500
I've been looking for you.

106
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,820
Looking for me?

107
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,400
To be precise,

108
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,480
I'm finding a suitable employee for the Demon Inn.

109
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,680
And that person

110
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,800
is you.

111
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,680
What exactly do you want me to do?

112
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
The job is simple.

113
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,000
Our inn

114
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,880
helps people resolve their inner obsessions.

115
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,800
However,

116
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,400
these guests are not ordinary people.

117
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,240
I'm sorry,

118
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,760
but I'm just an ordinary person.

119
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,690
I need to go home.

120
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,120
If you stay here,

121
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,800
I'll treat you well.

122
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,250
But if you still want to run away...

123
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,120
I won't run.

124
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,850
Absolutely not.

125
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,020
Do you need me to open the door for you?

126
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,320
What are you thinking? You can't run after coming to the Monster Inn.

127
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,320
Monster.

128
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,450
I'm done.

129
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,160
I messed up.

130
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,360
Stop wasting time!

131
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,090
Go tell the innkeeper quickly!

132
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,080
Come give me a hand.

133
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,800
Old lady.

134
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,640
I stay up late all the time

135
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,520
and have osteoporosis.

136
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,200
I'm not suitable to be turned into a flower.

137
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,660
You were brought here by Feiye, weren't you?

138
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,600
Who are you?

139
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,840
You can be like the others

140
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,800
and call me Granny Ling.

141
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,490
Granny Ling.

142
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,040
Don't be afraid.

143
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,920
I'm just

144
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,720
an old woman who takes care of these lovely plants.

145
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,000
These flowers are quite lovely.

146
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,880
All I can do

147
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,800
is loosen the soil

148
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,920
and water them.

149
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,040
As for whether they can grow

150
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,920
and bloom,

151
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,810
that depends on whether they're willing to let go of their obsessions.

152
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,440
You don't believe me?

153
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,960
No, no, not at all.

154
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,890
How could I not believe you?

155
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,040
Oh, right.

156
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,200
That woman told me

157
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,280
this is a Monster Inn,

158
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,840
a place that helps monsters resolve their obsessions.

159
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,900
Do these plants have obsessions too?

160
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,000
Monsters are just

161
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,460
people trapped by their obsessions.

162
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,120
In this world,

163
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,360
flowers, birds, fish, insects,

164
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,200
all creatures

165
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,960
can form attachments.

166
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,560
When these attachments remain unresolved,

167
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,600
naturally,

168
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,740
obsessions form in their hearts.

169
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,400
Well,

170
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,240
I came here by mistake,

171
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,420
so I won't bother you anymore.

172
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,600
Isn't there someone you've been avoiding?

173
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,360
What's the matter?

174
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,480
Those who can find their way

175
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,760
to the Monster Inn are destined to be here.

176
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,620
Either with unfulfilled wishes,

177
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,320
or lingering attachments.

178
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,720
Running away

179
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,960
will never solve your problems.

180
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,560
Goodbye.
