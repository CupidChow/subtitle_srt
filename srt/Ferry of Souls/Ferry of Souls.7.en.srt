1
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,640
Ah!

2
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,320
Innkeeper, hurry!

3
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,600
Saving lives is more important!

4
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,040
Dongfang!

5
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,440
Dongfang!

6
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,640
Dongfang!

7
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,640
Dongfang!

8
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,660
Innkeeper,

9
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,880
what happened?

10
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,600
I promised

11
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,120
to protect your life.

12
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,980
Innkeeper,

13
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,340
we can't make the same mistake again.

14
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,480
Hey!

15
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,320
Wait for me!

16
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,480
Alright.

17
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,400
The troupe master is dead!

18
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,730
Someone's been killed!

19
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,320
There's been a murder!

20
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,000
Hurry!

21
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,770
It's him!

22
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,130
It's Mei Jiulang

23
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,050
who killed our Imperial Uncle.

24
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,600
What?

25
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,530
The Imperial Uncle is dead?

26
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,040
How is that possible?

27
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,330
Mei Jiulang,

28
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,280
someone has accused you

29
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,680
of going to the Imperial Uncle's mansion by invitation last night

30
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,280
and killing the old Imperial Uncle.

31
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,680
Come with us to the magistrate's office.

32
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,560
That's not right!

33
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,760
You must be mistaken.

34
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,440
I didn't kill anyone.

35
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,250
It wasn't me!

36
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,540
How could it not be you?

37
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Last night at the Imperial Uncle's mansion,

38
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,320
you were the only guest invited.

39
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:49,850
Besides,

40
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,960
I saw with my own eyes

41
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,820
that it was you.

42
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,130
He's talking nonsense!

43
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,080
The Imperial Uncle and I were close friends despite our age difference.

44
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,880
Everyone in the city knows this.

45
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,260
How could I possibly harm the old man?

46
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,560
I'm being framed!

47
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,180
Who framed you?

48
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,160
It's

49
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,920
the vegetable delivery couple temporarily hired by the estate.

50
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,980
They're the only ones with unknown backgrounds there.

51
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,940
The day before yesterday,

52
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,640
I heard them speaking disrespectfully about the Imperial Uncle,

53
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,900
so I reprimanded them.

54
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,050
I believe

55
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,250
they harbored resentment,

56
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,600
killed the Imperial Uncle,

57
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,730
and framed me for it.

58
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,000
Outside the gate last night,

59
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,400
there were indeed a young man and woman

60
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,520
who insisted on breaking into the Imperial Uncle's mansion.

61
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,520
They even claimed

62
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,880
the Imperial Uncle was in danger

63
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,409
and injured many of our men.

64
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,640
Could they have escaped?

65
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,880
But even so,

66
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,600
as long as they can't be found,

67
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,920
there's no evidence against them.

68
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,440
Very well.

69
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,170
Where are these two people now?

70
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,180
Right here.

71
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,040
The Imperial Uncle and the troupe leader

72
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,840
were indeed killed by Mei Jiulang,

73
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,440
but not by the Mei Jiulang standing before you.

74
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,650
Su Huasheng,

75
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,210
the show is over.

76
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,860
Time to be yourself again.

77
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,600
How is this possible?

78
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,730
He clearly died right here.

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,330
Look!

80
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,100
Why is the door moving?

81
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,700
What's happening?

82
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,680
This is where Mei Jiulang

83
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,940
brought us last night.

84
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,600
Wait for me.

85
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,680
Don't you want to become a star at Ruichun Garden?

86
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,280
This place

87
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,340
is where they really train the lead performers.

88
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,480
The manager of Ruichun Garden

89
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,200
has been secretly

90
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,730
doing unspeakable things.

91
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,200
Every performer who becomes famous

92
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,120
must train here

93
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,400
to entertain the nobles.

94
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,490
Royal Uncle.

95
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,720
Jiulang.

96
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,600
Jiulang.

97
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,240
You're here.

98
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,160
Royal Uncle.

99
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,610
Did you get lost?

100
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,360
Oh, indeed I did.

101
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,080
I was planning to visit

102
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,000
Jiulang.

103
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,840
But when I reached this back garden,

104
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,920
I saw

105
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,600
all these beautiful flowers in full bloom.

106
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,560
I was completely captivated.

107
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Those who know

108
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,680
say the Queen's brother has refined taste.

109
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,810
Those who don't know

110
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,920
might think any common flower

111
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,800
could catch your eye, my lord.

112
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,520
Indeed.

113
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,400
In my opinion,

114
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,059
among all these beauties,

115
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,720
our Jiulang is still the most radiant.

116
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,799
In the front hall,

117
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,800
your household staff have been frantically looking for you.

118
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,680
Would you like

119
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,660
to make an appearance?

120
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,440
Very well.

121
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,520
I'm just

122
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,880
waiting for Jiulang's performance

123
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,720
to begin.

124
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,920
See you later.

125
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,660
The Empress's brother

126
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,960
is so noble.

127
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,560
How could someone as lowly as you

128
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,160
ever catch his eye?

129
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,160
Huasheng.

130
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,010
Leave this place

131
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,680
and never come back.

132
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,770
Impossible.

133
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,740
You must be lying to me.

134
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,970
He's nothing but a sadistic brute.

135
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,410
That's impossible.

136
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,970
This is the whole truth.

137
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,740
You are not Mei Jiulang after all.

138
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,920
Be yourself,

139
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,480
Su Huasheng.

140
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,020
He's definitely not Boss Mei.

141
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,760
I thought Boss Mei was acting strange.

142
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,180
My dear brother Huasheng,

143
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,020
may this letter bring you joy.

144
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,050
In the past, I, Jiulang, was too shy

145
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,380
to reveal my true feelings to you.

146
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,080
Now that we must part ways,

147
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,410
I entrust to this letter

148
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,530
the depth of my friendship.

149
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,570
When I was six years old,

150
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,420
Chen Changqing saved me during a famine.

151
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,640
What do you want, kid?

152
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,320
Please give me something to eat.

153
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,180
No way, get out.

154
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,520
Get lost!

155
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,160
Please, I'm begging you.

156
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,000
Just give me some food.

157
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:38,970
Get lost!

158
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,040
Little beggar.

159
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,840
You have a good voice.

160
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,220
Would you like to come with me to learn opera?

161
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,480
I promise you'll have enough to eat every day.

162
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,340
What do you say?

163
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,370
If you master it,

164
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,610
you can enjoy the finest food and drink every day.

165
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,650
How about it?

166
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,440
Jiulang practiced diligently.

167
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,380
Everyone only saw Jiulang's glory on stage,

168
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,920
unaware of the filth beneath the costume.

169
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,170
Jiulang.

170
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,410
Meet at the usual place.

171
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,040
Fame and fortune are not easily gained.

172
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,920
With gain comes misfortune.

173
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,000
In the darkness,

174
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,280
Wealthy merchants and high officials

175
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,680
all treat me like a beast.

176
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
For years now,

177
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,690
Jiulang's art and beauty fade,

178
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,340
yet nobles and officials pursue him even more eagerly.

179
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,050
You and I, from the same school,

180
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,600
are birds in a cage.

181
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,700
Only waiting to be abused.

182
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,100
Huasheng, my brother,

183
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,880
though you have grand ambitions,

184
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,420
there are villains nearby

185
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,480
who regard human life as worthless,

186
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,680
I fear your wishes cannot be fulfilled.

187
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,120
Though I pretend to be harsh,

188
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,970
I swear to protect you completely.

189
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
After today,

190
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,840
mountains high and waters far,

191
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,770
do not look back.

192
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,250
I can only lament

193
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,820
that we will never be close again.

194
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,840
I regret it and hate it.

195
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,160
If we meet again someday,

196
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,210
I will surely share a drink with you

197
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,340
and face hardships together.

198
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,320
Jiulang.

199
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,000
What a joke.

200
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,600
It's truly a joke.

201
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,850
All these years,

202
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,040
my jealousy was nothing but a joke.

203
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,610
It was by my own hands

204
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,290
that I killed the person who loved me most.

205
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,170
Senior Brother.

206
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,260
In my next life,

207
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,580
I'll work like an ox and a horse

208
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,100
to repay my debt to you.

209
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,840
Huasheng.

210
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,180
Innkeeper.

211
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,760
I had

212
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,240
a very long dream.

213
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,840
It's my fault.

214
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,380
I should have explained everything to you earlier.

215
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,320
The person who really made the mistake

216
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,850
has already been punished.

217
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,460
Innkeeper.

218
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,020
Innkeeper.

219
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,820
Innkeeper!

220
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,040
Dongfang.

221
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,700
Madam Ling.

222
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,240
Innkeeper, what's going on?

223
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,450
What is this?

224
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,520
Innkeeper!
