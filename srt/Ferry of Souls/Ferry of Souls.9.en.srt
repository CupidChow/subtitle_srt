1
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,000
So after these obsessions are eliminated,

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,259
will she really vanish into thin air?

3
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,720
Sins.

4
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,400
will always be repaid one day.

5
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,810
When that day comes,

6
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,160
all traces of her existence in this world

7
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,800
will be erased.

8
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,460
Vanished without a trace.

9
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,330
Spirit Lady,

10
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
if you have a way for me to help her escape the karmic fire,

11
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,680
you must also have a way

12
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,539
for me to help her change her fate.

13
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,530
The one who tied the knot

14
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,320
must be the one to untie it.

15
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,800
Only when she truly lets go of her obsessions

16
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,600
will it be possible

17
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,120
to rewrite her fate.

18
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,120
You and she share a thousand-year bond.

19
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,560
Now,

20
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,450
if you join forces with her,

21
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,400
there might be a glimmer of hope.

22
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,130
Hey, Qin.

23
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,680
Dongfang.

24
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,040
Come save me quickly!

25
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,840
What's wrong?

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,040
Please come rescue me now!

27
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,440
Someone wants to kill me.

28
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,320
Where are you now?

29
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,000
Who wants to kill you?

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's one of my clients.

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,660
Her mother suspects I'm seducing her daughter.

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll go there now.

33
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,160
Mr. Dongfang.

34
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:12,930
Oh no!

35
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,480
Mr. Dongfang isn't planning to escape, is he?

36
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,920
I need to tell the manager about this right away.

37
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,650
You can't go.

38
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,240
If the manager finds out I let it slip,

39
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,520
he'll skin me alive.

40
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,160
What should we do then?

41
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,290
What is it that I shouldn't know about?

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,560
Calm down.

43
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,480
You bastard!

44
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,520
Bastard!

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,200
What took you so long?

46
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:42,480
Ma'am,

47
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,720
let's talk this through, okay?

48
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,200
Ma'am,

49
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,800
you've really misunderstood.

50
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,730
Misunderstood?

51
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,520
Haitang and I

52
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,600
are simply in a therapist-patient relationship,

53
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,560
nothing more.

54
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,120
You've clearly been planning this all along.

55
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,640
You just want to get close to my daughter.

56
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,170
Ma'am...

57
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,520
How dare you make excuses!

58
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,120
Oh no,

59
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:56,720
ma'am.

60
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,200
Please calm down.

61
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:01,960
Ma'am.

62
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,410
There must be a misunderstanding.

63
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,690
Misunderstanding?

64
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,520
Who do you think you are?

65
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,050
What's it got to do with you?

66
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,120
My daughter graduated from a prestigious university.

67
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,580
She's perfectly healthy.

68
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,279
What psychological problems could she possibly have?

69
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,920
It's clearly that beast in human clothing

70
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,200
using therapy as a front

71
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,800
just to take advantage of my daughter.

72
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,060
Running away, are you?

73
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,970
I'll smash this whole place up!

74
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,680
Hey!

75
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,320
Hey!

76
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,640
No, don't!

77
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,060
You'll hurt your hand.

78
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,240
Dr. Qin knew nothing about this.

79
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,090
Please stop blaming him, okay?

80
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,370
Zou Haitang,

81
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,690
shut your mouth!

82
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,130
I'll deal with you when we get home.

83
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,050
Ma'am, let's sit down and talk.

84
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,560
Take your hands off me.

85
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:03,960
I see

86
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,240
you and that beast

87
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,620
are birds of a feather.

88
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,080
Hey!

89
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,260
Stay away from my daughter and me.

90
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,640
Boss.

91
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,600
What are you doing here?

92
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,520
If I hadn't come,

93
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,450
you would've been beaten to death.

94
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,320
Be careful.

95
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,120
I'm already an adult.

96
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,520
Why won't you give me

97
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,120
even a little bit of freedom?

98
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,680
Why?

99
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,600
Haitang.

100
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:57,930
Haitang.

101
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,730
Haitang.

102
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,450
Haitang, what's wrong?

103
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,000
Haitang.

104
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,040
Haitang.

105
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,010
What's wrong, Haitang?

106
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,330
Haitang.

107
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:33,960
Haitang.

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,530
Haitang.

109
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,010
Haitang.

110
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,159
Haitang.

111
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,580
Don't scare mommy.

112
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:53,850
Haitang.

113
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,620
Mom is only doing what's best for you.

114
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,610
Haitang.

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,800
Haitang.

116
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,240
Haitang.

117
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,040
Haitang.

118
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,600
Haitang.

119
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,130
We should be able to see her again soon.

120
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,530
I need to tell Qin Qi.

121
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,450
He doesn't know about this girl's situation.

122
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,780
This person

123
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,900
Don't see him again in the future.

124
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,400
He's not as simple as you think.

125
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,000
Why?

126
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,570
He's my good friend.

127
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,420
Suit yourself.

128
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,800
So strange.

129
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,400
The way that girl was acting just now.

130
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,520
Her mother still had to come find you.

131
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,640
What can I do?

132
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,000
She's just crazy.

133
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
What's really going on with this girl?

134
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,480
Why is she so frightening when she eats?

135
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,600
She has serious emotional issues.

136
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,300
If this continues,

137
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,700
not only will her emotions collapse,

138
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,520
but her body won't hold up either.

139
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,640
It's all because of her mother,

140
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,120
caused by excessive control over a long period.

141
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,720
She is quite pitiful indeed.

142
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,980
When her heart can't bear it anymore,

143
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,460
she finds comfort in food.

144
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,330
Alright,

145
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,260
let's not talk about her anymore.

146
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,400
How have you been lately?

147
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,460
I'm doing great at the inn.

148
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,260
Let me tell you,

149
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,410
our inn is really interesting.

150
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,720
There's this total bootlicker,

151
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,800
and there's also a little pig spirit.

152
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,530
A pig spirit!

153
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,060
Your condition is getting worse.

154
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,280
You should come to me for treatment for a while.

155
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,900
You don't understand.

156
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,660
Innkeeper,

157
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,480
I'm back.

158
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,760
Mr. Dongfang,

159
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,680
the innkeeper doesn't seem to be in a good mood.

160
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,320
Newcomer,

161
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,720
weren't you leaving?

162
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,980
Why are you back again?

163
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,500
Innkeeper.

164
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,580
Innkeeper.

165
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,600
Innkeeper.

166
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,130
The rice is cold.

167
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,850
I made some noodles for you.

168
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,460
I'll go.

169
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,000
Zou Haitang.

170
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,660
Why is she here?

171
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,200
Isn't it because you brought her from the healing room?

172
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,800
Could it be

173
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,210
that she's our next client?

174
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,660
What should we do with her now?

175
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,800
Throw her out.

176
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,040
She'll forget everything that happened today by tomorrow anyway.

177
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,840
That won't do,

178
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,400
boss.

179
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,120
Is this how you've been treating your clients?

180
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,320
No wonder the complaint rate is so high.

181
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,650
I don't need you telling me how to do my job.

182
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,920
Since she's a client,

183
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,580
we should treat her properly.

184
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,240
Besides, the deeper her obsession,

185
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,900
the more it will benefit you once it's resolved.

186
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,930
Take him to a guest room.

187
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,610
Clean it up quickly.

188
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,800
Don't delay our inn's business.

189
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,000
Yes, innkeeper!

190
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,080
My knife!

191
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,560
Who came last night?

192
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,200
The edge of my knife is all bent.

193
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,400
Stop arguing.

194
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,040
It was the new guest who arrived yesterday.

195
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,120
I'm sorry.

196
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,530
I've caused trouble for everyone.

197
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,880
Coming to someone's place without notice,

198
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,160
messing with other people's things,

199
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,960
you should be thrown out!

200
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,040
Calm down.

201
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,460
I truly apologize.

202
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,180
I'll definitely clean up the inn.

203
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,800
And I'll compensate everyone for the damaged items.

204
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,920
Can you even afford it?

205
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,880
Come on.

206
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,480
Calm down.

207
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,180
It's okay, don't blame yourself.

208
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,890
You didn't do it on purpose.

209
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,040
We'll restore everything to its original state.

210
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,520
But,

211
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,000
what happened to you?

212
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,720
Since you've come to the Monster Inn,

213
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,760
you are our guest.

214
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,420
Why don't we...

215
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,410
go upstairs and have a proper talk?

216
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,700
You two,

217
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,920
continue cleaning.

218
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,850
Yes, innkeeper!

219
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,650
Do you know where this place is?

220
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,840
No, I don't.

221
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,920
Then how did you get here?

222
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,640
I followed you all the way here.

223
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,490
But as soon as I arrived,

224
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,700
I started feeling very hungry again,

225
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,450
and then I lost consciousness.

226
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,100
May I ask where this is?

227
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,370
This is the Monster Inn.

228
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,720
This place

229
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,380
isn't somewhere just anyone can come to.

230
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,400
Monster Inn?

231
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,610
So are you all

232
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,040
monsters?

233
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,370
Don't be afraid.

234
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,440
We won't hurt you.

235
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,920
Do you need our help?

236
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:35,900
Tell us.

237
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,840
Perhaps

238
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,140
we can help you.

239
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,440
Are you going to talk?

240
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,240
If not, then leave.

241
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,700
Go home.

242
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,560
No, no, no.

243
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,640
I won't go home.

244
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,060
I don't want to see her.

245
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,040
Who is she?

246
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,240
She's my mom.

247
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,640
My mom is very good to me.

248
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,770
She loves me so much.

249
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,810
She loves me to the point

250
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,240
that it suffocates me.

251
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,800
Haitang.
