1
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,479
Farewell.

2
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,400
You wretched chrysanthemum spirit,

3
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,729
trapped for years and still unrepentant.

4
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,050
Shopkeeper Shangguan,

5
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,640
why won't you ever let me go?

6
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,280
Come back.

7
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,170
The time has come, chrysanthemum spirit.

8
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,919
I'm sorry

9
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,240
for startling you.

10
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,170
Who's speaking?

11
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,040
I didn't mean to harm you.

12
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,480
Would you mind watering me?

13
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,840
I am Tao Shi.

14
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,280
Your great kindness,

15
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,480
I shall never forget.

16
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,800
Are you human or ghost?

17
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,880
I was human a thousand years ago.

18
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,320
Benefactor,

19
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,360
you need not be afraid.

20
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,400
I won't harm you.

21
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,280
Just call me Dongfang Zhaobai.

22
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,220
Brother Dongfang.

23
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,210
Why are you in this monster inn?

24
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,960
Could it be

25
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,240
you're also here because of an obsession?

26
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,700
I should have vanished a thousand years ago,

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
but because of a promise to a friend,

28
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,280
therefore,

29
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,600
I had no choice but to remain in this form.

30
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,000
Do spirits have friends too?

31
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,720
For a thousand years,

32
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,040
I've been trapped here by the innkeeper,

33
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,320
unable to escape.

34
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,160
I was about to perish,

35
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,760
but fortunately,

36
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,640
you saved me.

37
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,140
It's that Shangguan Feiye again.

38
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,060
She truly is a habitual offender,

39
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,280
even more frightening than monsters.

40
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,880
Well,

41
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,100
never mind, I was just passing by.

42
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,600
It was nothing.

43
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,520
Don't worry about it.

44
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,200
Bye-bye.

45
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,500
Brother Dongfang.

46
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,090
Benefactor,

47
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,180
may I ask one more favor of you?

48
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
I'm just an ordinary person.

49
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,200
I really can't help you.

50
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,000
Please,

51
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,000
I beg you.

52
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,520
You're the only one who can help me here.

53
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,820
Brother Dongfang,

54
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,210
please drink this wine.

55
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,280
You will then know what happened that year

56
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,040
and realize

57
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,440
I have not been lying.

58
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,160
This is the scene

59
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,560
of our last encounter.

60
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,720
Indeed.

61
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,080
Back then,

62
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,090
I was fortunate to meet you,

63
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,720
which inspired me to create this painting.

64
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,220
Your heart guides your brush,

65
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,840
capturing essence without confusion.

66
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,570
Brother Gao,

67
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,000
your brushwork is truly masterful.

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,080
In this world,

69
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,140
the one who understands me

70
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,920
is Tao Shi.

71
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:48,880
That day

72
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,760
I fell gravely ill during my journey to the imperial examination.

73
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,960
My life was in danger.

74
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,760
It was you, Brother Gao, a complete stranger,

75
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,760
who saved my life.

76
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,440
Your great kindness

77
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,280
I, Tao Shi,

78
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,880
will never forget.

79
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,360
If our positions were reversed,

80
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,560
you wouldn't have left me to die either.

81
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,520
Besides,

82
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,680
wealth is easy to come by,

83
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,080
but a kindred spirit is hard to find.

84
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,810
I've also gained a true friend,

85
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,240
so I'm only winning here.

86
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,320
Ha!

87
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,290
Brother Gao,

88
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,220
why don't we

89
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,080
meet here on this day next year?

90
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,240
I'll brew chrysanthemum wine

91
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,440
and wait for you here.

92
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,360
The two of us

93
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,400
can continue today's friendship.

94
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,260
What do you say?

95
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,320
Wonderful!

96
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,040
I was thinking the same.

97
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,720
Our chrysanthemum wine appointment,

98
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,960
it's a promise.

99
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,760
Brother Gao,

100
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,380
the flowers have bloomed,

101
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,840
and the wine is ready.

102
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,960
But I...

103
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,800
I'm afraid

104
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,810
I cannot keep our appointment.

105
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,600
In the next life,

106
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,280
I will surely

107
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,300
drink wine and admire chrysanthemums with you.

108
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,450
Times have changed.

109
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,800
You still haven't let go?

110
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,620
Brother Dongfang,

111
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,600
this is the only lingering regret

112
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,000
that keeps me in this world.

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,330
If I take this pot of wine

114
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,960
and go through that door,

115
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,640
I can travel to the world of a thousand years ago.

116
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,770
To find Brother Gao.

117
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,360
Wait!

118
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,160
Taoshi, you know

119
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,320
what will happen if you go through this door.

120
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,800
He hasn't done anything wrong.

121
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,860
He just wants to fulfill his promise.

122
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,400
Besides, isn't your monster inn

123
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,000
supposed to help monsters resolve their obsessions?

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,600
That's what you said.

125
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,060
Shut up.

126
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
What would a newcomer like you know?

127
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,480
If you dare take one step outside,

128
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,080
you'll vanish into thin air before an incense stick burns out.

129
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,560
You better think carefully.

130
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,220
Innkeeper.

131
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,700
I'm not afraid.

132
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,480
Even if I'm reduced to dust,

133
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
I still have to go.

134
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,210
I'll take you there.

135
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:34,960
Wait.

136
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,360
What is it now?

137
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,920
Weren't you planning to escape?

138
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,080
What capacity are you taking him in?

139
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,280
I've decided to stay.

140
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,060
Just temporarily though.

141
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,240
Please.

142
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,640
Old friends depart one by one.

143
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,320
Rivers flow on alone.

144
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,720
Suddenly seeing a visitor from dreams.

145
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,200
How many times will we grieve?

146
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,080
My friend,

147
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,960
are you here to see the chrysanthemums?

148
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,760
I'm here on someone's behalf,

149
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,020
to represent a friend,

150
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,570
for an appointment.

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,730
Brother Gao,

152
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,120
for our chrysanthemum wine appointment,

153
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,720
I'm here.

154
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,400
Tao Shi.

155
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,760
Tao Shi had no attachment

156
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,410
to this bustling world.

157
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,930
He was simply unfortunate,

158
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,400
breaking his promise to meet you for chrysanthemum wine.

159
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,200
But even so...

160
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,200
He survived a thousand years through sheer will,

161
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,260
never forgetting his promise to you.

162
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,760
Today he finally comes to fulfill that promise.

163
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,960
Please, Brother Gao,

164
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,050
drink this cup of wine from Tao Shi.

165
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,320
My friend.

166
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,800
Tao Shi is right here.

167
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,080
My friend.

168
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,080
Brother Gao.

169
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,040
Just for one meeting,

170
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,400
you'll turn to dust for this.

171
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,240
Is it worth it?

172
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,240
Actually,

173
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,090
you weren't trying to trap Tao Shi,

174
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,440
but protecting him,

175
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,000
right?

176
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,690
Don't think so highly of me.

177
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,220
I don't work overtime.

178
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,730
What's this?

179
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,410
You want to stay now?

180
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,040
I think this job is quite interesting,

181
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,800
like playing a murder mystery game.

182
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,660
Once you agree,

183
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,220
there's no going back.

184
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,320
Of course.

185
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,680
What are you standing there for?

186
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,340
Get to work.

187
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,960
I'm not finished yet.

188
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,600
I don't work overtime,

189
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,060
especially night shifts.

190
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,680
Two days off per week,

191
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,920
no working on holidays either.

192
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,520
Unless...

193
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,480
Triple pay.

194
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,820
No, five times the pay.

195
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,440
Keep talking,

196
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,210
and I'll feed you to the demons.

197
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,040
Wait for me!

198
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,880
Great benefits,

199
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,520
easy work,

200
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,440
and a monster inn that helps guests resolve their obsessions.

201
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,800
You haven't joined some scam organization, have you?

202
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,200
What scam organization?

203
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,120
To be precise,

204
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,640
they're special guests.

205
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,840
Anyway, I've decided to stay and give it a try.

206
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,570
Where did you say this place is?

207
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,660
I can't really explain that clearly.

208
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,760
A car will come to pick me up anyway.

209
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,020
Is it that mysterious?

210
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,760
Monster Inn.

211
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,800
When can you take me there for a look?

212
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,400
You just stay put right here.

213
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,280
Our place

214
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,080
doesn't hire people who wear glasses.

215
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,680
At least leave me an address.

216
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,240
I might even refer some customers to you.

217
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,170
Destined guests

218
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,090
who hear the name of Monster Inn

219
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,050
will naturally be invited to come.

220
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:31,820
Cheers!

221
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Shangguan Feiye.

222
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,060
You really are a devil.

223
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,850
Have you always resolved customers' obsessions so violently?

224
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,240
The manager's business

225
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,440
is none of your concern.

226
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:01,960
Get back to work.
