1
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,800
I've been plotting for a thousand years.

2
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,840
As long as I eliminate

3
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,300
all you innkeepers today,

4
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,200
the monster inn will disappear.

5
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,000
I will regain my freedom.

6
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,440
Shangguan Feiye,

7
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,680
Dongfang Zhaobai,

8
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,280
all of you can die!

9
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,560
Ling Po,

10
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,300
you're celebrating too soon.

11
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,320
I almost forgot

12
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,040
about you.

13
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,840
Didn't you break ties with him?

14
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:24,640
You even planted the Wujian Vine on him.

15
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,440
You wanted him to take Shangguan Feiye's place

16
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,040
and die from the karmic fire.

17
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,500
I was indeed deceived by you at first.

18
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,440
I mistakenly thought Shangguan Feiye killed my brother.

19
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,050
But later I remembered something.

20
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,520
It was you who told me

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,880
that evil spirits appeared in Shangguan Feiye's village.

22
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,880
You sent me to catch those monsters.

23
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,640
You wanted her to misunderstand

24
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,240
that I was Dongfang Zhaobai.

25
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,040
That I killed her loved ones.

26
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,120
Then use her to eliminate my brother.

27
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,240
It seems

28
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,560
you're not as stupid as I thought.

29
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,800
But aren't you afraid your brother

30
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,400
might actually die from the Wujian Vine

31
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,800
filled with karmic fire?

32
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,680
How did the Wujian Vine end up on you?

33
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,020
My brother and I

34
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,520
are incarnations of the Huangquan Jade.

35
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,380
The Wujian Vine

36
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,220
connects the two jade pieces.

37
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,079
They can naturally be transferred between us.

38
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,200
Karmic fire!

39
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:30,010
So what if it's a different person?

40
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,120
Besides,

41
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,960
now you bear the power of karmic fire.

42
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,480
You'll soon be reduced to ashes.

43
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,560
What can you possibly do?

44
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,930
It was all just an illusion to deceive you.

45
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,960
When you thought my brother

46
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,560
was completely controlled by the Wujian Vine,

47
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,520
I transferred it to myself.

48
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:51,680
Of course,

49
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,930
I was also gambling.

50
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,620
Betting that Shangguan Feiye

51
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,980
would risk her life

52
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,300
to return to a thousand years ago.

53
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,120
So what?

54
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,160
You're only half of the Huangquan Jade.

55
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,660
Now you bear the power of karmic fire.

56
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,680
You'll soon be reduced to ashes.

57
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,880
As for those two,

58
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,519
they're not even worth mentioning.

59
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,959
Is that so?

60
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,960
Today is the day you die.

61
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,640
Prepare to meet your end.

62
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,720
Qiongqi.

63
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,360
The Huangquan Jade can only be restored

64
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,610
to its original power when the two pieces are united.

65
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,880
Only then can we stop the Demon King.

66
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,740
Please be careful.

67
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,620
Wait for my return.

68
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,720
I'm back.

69
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,200
From today onwards,

70
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,080
you belong to me.

71
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,640
Feiye.

72
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,480
Feiye.

73
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,520
Is anybody there?

74
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,520
Help me!

75
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,960
Let the past

76
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,240
be the past.

77
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
In the days ahead,

78
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,090
take good care of yourself.

79
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,760
Hey, the boss is back.

80
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,960
Boss,

81
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,640
you're up early today.

82
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,840
You look very nice today.

83
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,000
Boss.

84
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,800
Boss.

85
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,400
Boss.

86
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:08,840
Boss.

87
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,410
Good morning, boss.

88
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,200
Boss,

89
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,450
at your service!

90
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,960
Hello, boss.

91
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,360
All right.

92
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,240
Boss,

93
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,880
try this that I made.

94
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,360
Boss.

95
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,000
What's wrong?

96
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,800
What happened? Who ate it?

97
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,200
It was you.

98
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,840
Which eye of yours saw me eating it?

99
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,400
I saw everything.

100
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,480
Do you have any proof?

101
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:28,920
Oh my!

102
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,960
Where's my knife?

103
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,560
Dongfang.

104
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,880
Oh, Boss, look at her!

105
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,210
Look!

106
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,960
Let go of me!

107
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,640
It was you.

108
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,240
Hey, stop fighting, you two!

109
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,220
The boss will be back soon.

110
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:38,920
Well,

111
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,650
I need to fix this rabbit lantern quickly.

112
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,260
This is Feiye's

113
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,480
most treasured gift.

114
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,000
Dongfang.

115
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,720
Dongfang.

116
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,360
Boss.

117
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,060
Stop drinking.

118
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,720
Dongfang,

119
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,530
you're back.

120
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,560
Boss,

121
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,800
sneaking food again?

122
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,160
Dongfang.

123
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,480
Dongfang.

124
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,440
Are you really gone?

125
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,560
Will you never come back?

126
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,400
That's the end of the Monster Inn story.

127
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,610
Does the Monster Inn from the story

128
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,840
really exist?

129
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,160
It's just a story.

130
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,880
There are no monsters in this world,

131
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,580
so naturally there's no Monster Inn.

132
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,090
So-called monsters

133
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,400
are merely

134
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,320
people trapped by obsessions in their hearts.

135
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,520
Obsessions.
