1
00:00:00,158 --> 00:00:02,677
Do you know why I’m scared of ghosts?

2
00:00:02,974 --> 00:00:05,195
When I was young, my mother always warned me

3
00:00:05,398 --> 00:00:09,438
not to be naughty or I’d be taken by ghosts.

4
00:00:09,938 --> 00:00:13,910
Having a mother to tell you off is better than not.

5
00:00:14,992 --> 00:00:15,854
Mom.

6
00:00:16,426 --> 00:00:17,727
You’re here again.

7
00:00:19,508 --> 00:00:20,832
Please leave now.

8
00:00:20,832 --> 00:00:21,951
Please leave now.

9
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:22,998
Hurry.

10
00:00:22,998 --> 00:00:23,680
Who’s there?

11
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,080
Not there.

12
00:00:27,636 --> 00:00:29,120
What happened to your legs?

13
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:30,880
Just a fall.

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,132
Luckily, that handsome guy helped me.

15
00:00:37,143 --> 00:00:37,700
You did?

16
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:42,114
Thanks.

17
00:00:45,828 --> 00:00:47,219
Yesterday you said

18
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:54,000
the owner of the house can’t be that heartless.

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,586
That’s why I’m here.

20
00:01:00,373 --> 00:01:02,880
Are you renting this house too?

21
00:01:05,503 --> 00:01:06,691
What a coincidence.

22
00:01:08,516 --> 00:01:09,028
Actually,

23
00:01:09,971 --> 00:01:11,295
I’m the owner.

24
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:13,719
Oh.

25
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:16,535
Why did you say the owner doesn’t want guests

26
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,102
when he’s this kind?

27
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,840
You didn’t have to lie if you didn’t want me to come.

28
00:01:23,932 --> 00:01:25,932
Oh.

29
00:01:25,932 --> 00:01:27,932
Mom,

30
00:01:27,932 --> 00:01:29,120
my stomach hurts.

31
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:30,203
Oh.

32
00:01:32,173 --> 00:01:33,226
Oh.

33
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:34,602
Oh, no.

34
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,240
Hurry and close the door.

35
00:01:39,983 --> 00:01:42,704
Tee, I told you this is embarrassing.

36
00:01:42,882 --> 00:01:44,160
Open the door, Mom.

37
00:01:44,292 --> 00:01:46,292
No. The others will smell it.

38
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,439
They’re used to it.

39
00:01:48,615 --> 00:01:49,961
How can you behave like this?

40
00:01:49,961 --> 00:01:51,040
This is not our house.

41
00:01:51,169 --> 00:01:53,079
So what?

42
00:01:53,237 --> 00:01:56,000
You’re a grown man. Why won’t you close the door while you poop?

43
00:01:56,162 --> 00:01:58,449
No way. My son is not a coward like this.

44
00:01:58,449 --> 00:02:00,720
Let’s try and close the door for once.

45
00:02:03,428 --> 00:02:05,428
Ghosts are not real.

46
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,051
Stop being scared already. You’re an adult now.

47
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:10,450
You can’t open the door to show others while you poop.

48
00:02:18,898 --> 00:02:20,898
It’s your fault I’m like this.

49
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:23,520
You taught me this way. You raised me this way.

50
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,890
Do you think I want to be like this?

51
00:02:26,228 --> 00:02:28,792
I’m a big man but I’m still like this.

52
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:31,018
What do you want me to do, Mom?

53
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:35,904
I told you not to come here again.

54
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:42,639
Then I should go.

55
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:51,963
Young man.

56
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,996
Like I said, I shouldn’t come here again.

57
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,040
It’s your fault I’m like this.

58
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:12,532
I want to be like others.

59
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:15,069
I told you not to come here again.

60
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:21,861
Hey.

61
00:04:23,886 --> 00:04:26,269
Thanks again for helping my mom.

62
00:04:29,174 --> 00:04:30,135
Like I said,

63
00:04:31,127 --> 00:04:31,821
no problem at all.

64
00:04:33,553 --> 00:04:34,110
Mm.

65
00:04:35,707 --> 00:04:36,692
I also want to apologize.

66
00:04:39,056 --> 00:04:40,335
For what?

67
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:45,908
For breaking the rules and bringing my mom here without telling you first.

68
00:04:50,104 --> 00:04:51,202
Didn’t you see earlier?

69
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:53,716
I led her in myself.

70
00:04:54,681 --> 00:04:56,117
Your mom is an exception.

71
00:04:57,281 --> 00:04:59,281
Are you the Watee I know?

72
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:07,094
I saw your mom and thought of mine.

73
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:11,811
But.

74
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:13,706
But what?

75
00:05:14,626 --> 00:05:17,483
Let me know in advance every time she’s coming to visit.

76
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,411
Sure.

77
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:21,697
By the way,

78
00:05:24,556 --> 00:05:25,293
when you talk to your mom,

79
00:05:27,003 --> 00:05:27,695
be nice.

80
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:29,629
And don’t forget what I told you.

81
00:05:30,989 --> 00:05:31,952
Okay.

82
00:05:33,571 --> 00:05:35,188
I’ll ask for your permission every time.

83
00:05:37,492 --> 00:05:38,275
Not that.

84
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,487
I’m talking about how I envy you.

85
00:05:45,722 --> 00:05:48,894
Your mom also said this to me:

86
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,380
I don’t know if it’s because I used to scare him about ghosts when he was a kid.

87
00:05:55,244 --> 00:05:59,070
Maybe that’s why he’s so scared of them now.

88
00:06:00,238 --> 00:06:02,914
If so, I’d feel really guilty

89
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:06,256
because I don’t want my son to be scared of anything.

90
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,964
Well, I think your son is trying to overcome his fear.

91
00:06:18,473 --> 00:06:19,391
Try harder

92
00:06:20,307 --> 00:06:21,090
for yourself

93
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:22,839
and the people who love you.

94
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:41,298
Mom: I’m home.

95
00:06:42,173 --> 00:06:44,173
I won’t bother you next time

96
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,952
and I won’t bring up your fear again.

97
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,783
I’m sorry.

98
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,237
Whoa.

99
00:07:26,736 --> 00:07:27,654
Huh?

100
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:36,620
It smells bad pooping with the door closed, Mom.

101
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:50,100
The door is closed.

102
00:07:50,944 --> 00:07:51,794
He can’t be in the toilet.

103
00:07:56,528 --> 00:07:58,528
That’s what everyone else smells.

104
00:07:58,984 --> 00:08:00,984
Isn’t it refreshing?

105
00:08:05,161 --> 00:08:11,197
I don’t know how far I can go with my attempt.

106
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:16,401
But at least I want to make the people who love and help me

107
00:08:16,784 --> 00:08:19,840
proud of the new Maetee I’m becoming.

108
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:39,366
How do you define a woman’s beauty?

109
00:09:42,934 --> 00:09:44,709
Rosy skin?

110
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:47,087
Pointy chin?

111
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:49,088
Degrees of smiling?

112
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:53,654
For me, the best indicators of a woman’s beauty are

113
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,060
these symptoms.

114
00:10:11,597 --> 00:10:13,212
Excuse me.

115
00:10:13,728 --> 00:10:14,488
Are you alright?

116
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,414
I’m fine.

117
00:10:17,686 --> 00:10:18,739
Hey.

118
00:10:20,961 --> 00:10:22,961
Is there anything I can do to help?

119
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:28,496
Cherry.

120
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:37,248
One particular girl with those eyes is the cause of my every symptom.

121
00:10:41,609 --> 00:10:45,000
They say your first love is the purest.

122
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,329
You give your heart to someone without reasons.

123
00:10:58,578 --> 00:11:00,205
Who is that from?

124
00:11:00,205 --> 00:11:01,600
Phumiphat or Kongpob?

125
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,910
No, it’s from me.

126
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:05,469
Cherry.

127
00:11:05,469 --> 00:11:06,885
I like you.

128
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,160
♫ You’re beautiful

129
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,414
every moment I touch you ♫

130
00:11:11,414 --> 00:11:12,376
Stop.

131
00:11:12,376 --> 00:11:14,376
Don’t touch me, okay?

132
00:11:14,376 --> 00:11:16,952
You’re fat.

133
00:11:20,604 --> 00:11:25,638
Ever since that day, Teedet has never dared go after someone out of his league.

134
00:11:26,462 --> 00:11:30,112
I associate beautiful women with

135
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
heartlessness.

136
00:11:45,518 --> 00:11:48,316
I’ve never liked being scared of beautiful women.

137
00:11:48,316 --> 00:11:53,667
I’d hoped that the over 30 kg I lost and these muscles

138
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:56,306
would help me get rid of the symptoms

139
00:11:56,306 --> 00:11:57,577
but...

140
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,041
Excuse me. May I get through?

141
00:12:13,377 --> 00:12:14,880
Excuse me.

142
00:12:23,504 --> 00:12:25,850
Excuse me. Is someone sitting next to you?

143
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:48,606
I’m still no different from when I was a fat kid

144
00:12:49,112 --> 00:12:55,956
and that first love was my only love so far.

145
00:12:58,565 --> 00:13:01,443
I’m the reason you’ve been suffering that much?

146
00:13:05,246 --> 00:13:07,246
I feel guilty

147
00:13:07,765 --> 00:13:09,392
for making you suffer.

148
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,586
Is there anything I can do to help?

149
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:15,680
Don’t worry.

150
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,984
Are you going to eat alone for the rest of your life?

151
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:24,815
What can I do?

152
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,208
Don’t you want a girlfriend?

153
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:31,353
You’ll have someone beside you.

154
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,048
Doing things together

155
00:13:33,234 --> 00:13:34,576
could be nice.

156
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:39,184
I guess I do, but I don’t want my heart beating fast and neither do I want to vomit.

157
00:13:39,516 --> 00:13:41,516
I don’t want to sweat.

158
00:13:41,516 --> 00:13:42,841
By the way,

159
00:13:43,027 --> 00:13:44,890
why are you here alone?

160
00:13:45,795 --> 00:13:50,000
Who would want to walk with a fat girl like me?

161
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:55,742
I guess she no longer looks beautiful to me,

162
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:59,117
seeing I’m not showing any symptoms.

163
00:13:59,117 --> 00:14:02,941
On the contrary, she is the person with symptoms now.

164
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,429
How about we date for a day?

165
00:14:08,002 --> 00:14:12,584
I’ve never dated anyone and it’s been a while since you last did.

166
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,225
♫ You’re beautiful

167
00:14:29,225 --> 00:14:32,946
every moment I touch you

168
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,326
I knew right away you’re the special one

169
00:14:38,326 --> 00:14:43,058
I’ve been waiting for ♫

170
00:14:43,058 --> 00:14:44,313
Teedet.

171
00:14:44,313 --> 00:14:47,026
♫ It’s our destiny ♫

172
00:14:49,478 --> 00:14:51,079
I don’t think this suits me.

173
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,548
You look beautiful.

174
00:14:52,548 --> 00:14:53,476
I’ll go change.

175
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:54,624
Why?

176
00:14:54,624 --> 00:14:55,680
You look beautiful.

177
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,759
Come here.

178
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Smile.

179
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:08,776
I’m starting to see Cherry’s old smile again.

180
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:13,489
I want her to know that if from now on she has no one,

181
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:15,167
or no matter how people see her,

182
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:19,865
I want her to love herself the most.

183
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,570
Today’s almost over.

184
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,621
Do you have anything to tell this fake girlfriend of yours?

185
00:15:28,475 --> 00:15:33,642
Having someone beside you and getting to do things together makes you happy,

186
00:15:34,358 --> 00:15:36,837
I hope you find that someone soon, Teedet.

187
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:40,334
You too, Cherry.

188
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:44,201
It’s not easy to get where I am.

189
00:15:44,494 --> 00:15:46,494
Every time I lift a dumbbell,

190
00:15:46,494 --> 00:15:50,000
I tell myself, “no pain, no gain”.

191
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,964
It’s necessary to suffer in order to achieve something.

192
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:56,093
I guess I have to tell myself that about love as well.

193
00:15:58,241 --> 00:15:59,655
What are you doing?

194
00:15:59,656 --> 00:16:00,591
Shh!

195
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:01,161
What?

196
00:16:01,365 --> 00:16:02,992
What do you need that for?

197
00:16:02,992 --> 00:16:06,288
Trust me. I’ll let you guys know when it’s time.

198
00:16:06,288 --> 00:16:07,670
I found it!

199
00:17:02,602 --> 00:17:03,961
What are you doing?

200
00:17:04,434 --> 00:17:05,342
Shh!

201
00:17:05,342 --> 00:17:06,796
Get in before everyone else finds out.

202
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:24,204
What are you two doing?

203
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:25,573
Shh!

204
00:17:25,574 --> 00:17:27,123
Get in before everyone else finds out.

205
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:41,300
What are you three doing?

206
00:17:41,656 --> 00:17:42,516
Shh!

207
00:17:42,516 --> 00:17:44,205
Get in before everyone else finds out.

208
00:17:54,997 --> 00:17:56,617
I said don’t tell anyone.

209
00:17:56,807 --> 00:17:58,022
Now the whole house knows.

210
00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:01,404
What?

211
00:18:01,765 --> 00:18:03,053
What do you need that for?

212
00:18:03,231 --> 00:18:04,335
Just trust me on this one.

213
00:18:04,335 --> 00:18:05,905
Do you need it for black magic?

214
00:18:06,288 --> 00:18:08,430
You want to get back at him for kicking your father out, right?

215
00:18:09,071 --> 00:18:11,863
I’ll let you guys know when it’s time.

216
00:18:13,775 --> 00:18:16,060
Hurry up before he gets back and we get in trouble.

217
00:18:17,356 --> 00:18:19,973
Okay. Everyone, scatter.

218
00:18:33,364 --> 00:18:35,055
Guys, I found it!

219
00:18:39,726 --> 00:18:40,975
But it’s too long.

220
00:18:40,975 --> 00:18:41,744
Was it his mother’s?

221
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:44,601
I don’t want that. I want something that belongs to him.

222
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:45,367
Okay.

223
00:18:48,523 --> 00:18:50,879
Guys, I found it!

224
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,542
This one is short

225
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:53,198
but curly.

226
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:54,588
Eew!

227
00:18:54,588 --> 00:18:55,490
Eew!

228
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,362
It’s gone.

229
00:19:08,044 --> 00:19:09,118
Guys.

230
00:19:09,985 --> 00:19:10,940
I found it.

231
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:15,384
Mm.

232
00:19:25,784 --> 00:19:27,214
Oops!

233
00:19:33,002 --> 00:19:34,255
What are you guys doing?

234
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:38,007
I don’t know. Ask Maetee.

235
00:19:38,007 --> 00:19:38,856
Why me?

236
00:19:40,015 --> 00:19:41,024
You should ask

237
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,524
Teedet.

238
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:46,193
Ask T-Rex.

239
00:19:46,193 --> 00:19:46,882
Uh...

240
00:19:49,077 --> 00:19:49,795
So?

241
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:52,655
Maetee.

242
00:19:53,195 --> 00:19:55,195
I’m not keeping a secret from you

243
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:56,866
but...

244
00:19:56,866 --> 00:19:57,566
Again with the but.

245
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,062
I can’t tell you yet.

246
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:03,319
And please don’t tell Watee yet.

247
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:09,001
I’m telling you, if something happens, I have nothing to do with it.

248
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,990
Get ready for dinner.

249
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,427
Watee texted that he’ll be joining us.

250
00:20:14,575 --> 00:20:15,333
What?

251
00:20:17,378 --> 00:20:18,476
What’s the problem?

252
00:20:19,283 --> 00:20:20,283
Get ready for dinner.

253
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,470
You’re now the sixth ‘T’.

254
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,864
Welcome, Watee.

255
00:20:30,864 --> 00:20:32,656
Yay!

256
00:20:32,656 --> 00:20:34,459
Woo!

257
00:20:36,347 --> 00:20:37,373
Let’s eat.

258
00:20:38,607 --> 00:20:40,132
What’s going on with him?

259
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:42,154
Do you think he’s acting a little weird?

260
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,740
No. Let’s eat.

261
00:20:46,534 --> 00:20:47,679
Guys.

262
00:20:48,776 --> 00:20:50,087
Can you chew a little quieter?

263
00:20:50,087 --> 00:20:51,291
I’m practicing eating without my headphones.

264
00:20:58,084 --> 00:21:00,084
How do you know they can be trusted?

265
00:21:01,201 --> 00:21:02,892
I’ve seen a lot of people.

266
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,310
Those five friends of yours,

267
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:10,300
I think they can become your other family.

268
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:12,700
Trust me.

269
00:21:20,015 --> 00:21:21,365
Hey, Watee.

270
00:21:21,956 --> 00:21:23,775
You should join us for dinner next time.

271
00:21:23,775 --> 00:21:27,176
Eating together makes the food more delicious.

272
00:21:27,973 --> 00:21:29,973
Exactly. I’m so happy.

273
00:21:29,973 --> 00:21:32,337
Everything is sweeter when you’re here.

274
00:21:32,814 --> 00:21:33,775
It’s so cool.

275
00:21:41,281 --> 00:21:43,281
Facebook Group: Plant Lovers 101

276
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:47,390
What should I do?

277
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,752
My boyfriend gave me this plant as a gift.

278
00:21:50,011 --> 00:21:52,011
He wants me to take care of it as a symbol of our love.

279
00:21:52,606 --> 00:21:55,817
He said he would break up with me if it died.

280
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:59,816
I’ve been so busy and didn’t water it for several days.

281
00:22:00,234 --> 00:22:02,234
That’s why it looks like this.

282
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,385
I’ve tried watering it a lot for the last few days.

283
00:22:05,385 --> 00:22:08,308
What should I do? I don’t want to break up with my boyfriend.

284
00:22:12,157 --> 00:22:13,967
Comment: I think you're taking this too seriously.

285
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:15,720
Comment: Buy a new one to replace it. Problem solved.

286
00:22:22,389 --> 00:22:25,838
Teedet’s comment: It’s not dead yet. Just take better care of it.

287
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:45,835
Hi. Can you recommend how I should take care of my plant?

288
00:23:09,993 --> 00:23:11,215
Are you a friend of T-Rex’s?

289
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:17,817
Oh, it’s you, that friend of T-Rex’s.

290
00:23:17,817 --> 00:23:19,304
No wonder you look familiar.

291
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:27,856
It’s Teedet. I’m sorry about that day.

292
00:23:28,894 --> 00:23:33,775
Did you know my boyfriend broke up with me after finding out that I went to a guy’s house?

293
00:23:33,775 --> 00:23:36,179
It took me so long to win him back.

294
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:39,013
Now, if our love tree died,

295
00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:41,283
would he break up with me again?

296
00:23:43,776 --> 00:23:47,320
Do you have compost or hormones?

297
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:50,292
What are they?
Where can I buy them?

298
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,136
Hey.

299
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:13,333
Have you been waiting long?
Sorry. I got stuck in traffic.

300
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,375
When did you arrive?

301
00:24:22,102 --> 00:24:24,102
I’m not feeling nauseous at all,

302
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,195
really.

303
00:24:29,097 --> 00:24:31,097
Teedet.

304
00:24:31,956 --> 00:24:32,697
Oh.

305
00:24:32,697 --> 00:24:33,325
Are you okay?

306
00:24:33,949 --> 00:24:34,833
Yes, I am.

307
00:24:35,935 --> 00:24:36,985
Shall we go take a look?

308
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:37,780
Let’s.

309
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:39,604
Which way do we go?

310
00:24:39,746 --> 00:24:40,483
This way.

311
00:24:46,311 --> 00:24:47,860
Hey, babe.

312
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,896
Where are you?

313
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:50,563
I’m at a plant market.

314
00:24:50,563 --> 00:24:51,890
Look, there are so many plants here.

315
00:24:52,246 --> 00:24:53,455
What are you doing there?

316
00:24:53,671 --> 00:24:57,405
I’m looking for compost for our love tree

317
00:24:57,405 --> 00:24:58,995
so it grows and blossoms.

318
00:24:58,995 --> 00:24:59,675
Hey.

319
00:25:00,301 --> 00:25:01,897
This one is the easiest to use.

320
00:25:01,897 --> 00:25:03,091
Okay, cool.

321
00:25:04,598 --> 00:25:05,624
Who’s that?

322
00:25:06,535 --> 00:25:08,321
Oh, a friend.

323
00:25:08,321 --> 00:25:11,448
He knows a lot about plants so I asked him to take me here.

324
00:25:11,695 --> 00:25:12,745
Hi there.

325
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,499
You have a handsome and bulky friend?

326
00:25:17,069 --> 00:25:18,285
Are you cheating on me?

327
00:25:19,423 --> 00:25:23,180
Hey.
Look at my face. Why would he like me?

328
00:25:23,376 --> 00:25:25,851
Sorn, let’s break up.

329
00:25:26,044 --> 00:25:26,975
What?

330
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:27,570
Hey!

331
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:28,219
Wait.

332
00:25:35,812 --> 00:25:37,076
Are you okay?

333
00:25:40,584 --> 00:25:45,291
You know what? That was the fifth time he broke up with me this month.

334
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:49,245
I don’t know why he wanted to break up with me so much.

335
00:25:49,838 --> 00:25:53,120
Every time, I was the one who tried to make up.

336
00:25:53,273 --> 00:25:56,650
When he cheated on me, I forgave him.

337
00:25:57,747 --> 00:26:03,262
I feel stupid for being the only one fighting to keep this relationship.

338
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:06,664
Excuse me.

339
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:09,567
Will you take the compost?

340
00:26:12,378 --> 00:26:15,304
No. I’ll just let my plant die.

341
00:26:16,898 --> 00:26:18,043
Hey.

342
00:26:20,975 --> 00:26:22,975
I’ll leave it here.

343
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,859
Hey, I’m sorry for wasting your time.

344
00:26:32,205 --> 00:26:34,205
It’s okay. Don’t worry.

345
00:26:34,205 --> 00:26:36,851
I come here a lot,

346
00:26:36,851 --> 00:26:38,700
shopping for plants and stuff.

347
00:26:39,626 --> 00:26:40,917
Mm.

348
00:26:43,027 --> 00:26:45,027
I’m going that way.
Bye.

349
00:26:45,027 --> 00:26:45,913
Wait.

350
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,711
Keep this one.

351
00:26:48,362 --> 00:26:53,135
I got it because I’d feel bad if we hadn’t bought anything.

352
00:26:53,642 --> 00:26:55,642
No. Do you want it to die?

353
00:26:56,146 --> 00:26:59,191
This one is easy to take care of and right for you.

354
00:27:01,347 --> 00:27:02,231
This?

355
00:27:03,146 --> 00:27:05,146
It’s called Zanzibar Gem.

356
00:27:06,452 --> 00:27:07,502
Are you sure it’s easy to take care of?

357
00:27:07,502 --> 00:27:08,079
Yes, it is.

358
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:10,199
It’ll come to you at the wave of your hand.

359
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:13,387
Is this a bird or a cat?

360
00:27:27,955 --> 00:27:29,955
You can’t do that.

361
00:27:29,955 --> 00:27:31,539
It doesn’t need that much water.

362
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:32,690
Don’t kill it.

363
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:38,775
Oh. Too much care, they die. Too little care, they also die.

364
00:27:39,211 --> 00:27:40,950
Plants are so demanding.

365
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:45,960
Different kind of plants need different care.

366
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,202
Just like people.

367
00:27:48,237 --> 00:27:50,237
Wow.

368
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:52,148
A gardener’s motto.

369
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,400
Aren’t you warmhearted?

370
00:27:56,769 --> 00:28:00,669
I should go. I don’t want your girlfriend to slap me as a revenge that I slapped you.

371
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,684
She won’t.

372
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,620
She won’t slap me?

373
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:09,983
I don’t have a girlfriend.

374
00:28:09,983 --> 00:28:11,730
Why not?

375
00:28:14,813 --> 00:28:16,314
Why should I tell you?

376
00:28:18,032 --> 00:28:20,032
Are you saying I’m being nosey?

377
00:28:21,864 --> 00:28:23,389
Your words, not mine.

378
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,690
I don’t want to know anymore. Bye.

379
00:28:33,033 --> 00:28:34,253
Who are you texting?

380
00:28:34,253 --> 00:28:35,223
Spill.

381
00:28:37,123 --> 00:28:37,905
A friend.

382
00:28:38,228 --> 00:28:40,228
What kind of friend?

383
00:28:40,228 --> 00:28:41,530
Can she become more than that?

384
00:28:42,738 --> 00:28:43,775
I don’t know.

385
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,510
‘I don’t know’ means it’s possible.

386
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,450
If it’s not, you would have said no.

387
00:28:54,623 --> 00:28:56,623
You’re going to have a girlfriend soon.

388
00:28:56,623 --> 00:28:58,155
Woohoo!

389
00:28:58,155 --> 00:28:59,188
What girlfriend?

390
00:28:59,188 --> 00:29:00,689
No. It can’t be that serious.

391
00:29:00,689 --> 00:29:01,577
Who’s that girl?

392
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,013
A friend.

393
00:29:04,013 --> 00:29:04,925
Is she pretty?

394
00:29:56,553 --> 00:29:58,840
Hey, strike a pretty pose.

395
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,427
Am I pretty yet?

396
00:29:59,427 --> 00:30:01,826
Move a little bit. Yes.

397
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,963
I feel butterflies in my stomach.

398
00:30:39,335 --> 00:30:44,202
Is some kind of plant growing in my heart?

399
00:30:44,672 --> 00:30:46,672
A gardener’s motto.

400
00:30:50,403 --> 00:30:52,001
Okay, bye-bye.

401
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:54,173
Hey.

402
00:30:54,637 --> 00:30:55,719
What’s going on?

403
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:57,520
You’re smiling from ears to ears.

404
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,441
What?

405
00:30:59,861 --> 00:31:01,861
Any news for me?

406
00:31:02,699 --> 00:31:03,934
What news?

407
00:31:03,934 --> 00:31:06,134
You and my friend.

408
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:09,766
I went to hang out with your friend.

409
00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:12,828
And?

410
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,995
And... it was fun.

411
00:31:15,995 --> 00:31:17,031
What else?

412
00:31:17,344 --> 00:31:18,483
The movie was fun.

413
00:31:18,483 --> 00:31:19,203
What else?

414
00:31:19,618 --> 00:31:22,039
There’s nothing else.

415
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:23,709
Hmm?

416
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:26,627
There might be nothing else, but do you like her?

417
00:31:27,297 --> 00:31:28,562
Uh...

418
00:31:28,562 --> 00:31:31,142
Well, she’s cute.

419
00:31:31,142 --> 00:31:33,137
He didn’t answer the question.

420
00:31:33,137 --> 00:31:34,840
Look at my lips.

421
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,706
Do you like her?

422
00:31:40,056 --> 00:31:42,242
I feel happy when I’m with her.

423
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,524
You’re dancing around the question again.

424
00:31:44,524 --> 00:31:45,867
Do you like her?

425
00:31:45,867 --> 00:31:46,755
Yes.

426
00:31:46,755 --> 00:31:47,598
You do?

427
00:31:47,598 --> 00:31:49,563
Then you’re going to have a girlfriend soon.

428
00:31:49,563 --> 00:31:51,744
Woohoo!

429
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:52,385
What girlfriend?

430
00:31:52,385 --> 00:31:54,021
No. It can’t be that serious.

431
00:31:54,021 --> 00:31:54,544
Who’s that girl?

432
00:31:56,015 --> 00:31:57,135
A friend.

433
00:31:57,135 --> 00:31:58,102
Is she pretty?

434
00:31:58,102 --> 00:32:00,549
No. Her face is round and flat.

435
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:01,558
Hey.

436
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:04,322
Looksorn would be sad to hear that.

437
00:32:05,203 --> 00:32:06,722
How do you know it’s Looksorn?

438
00:32:06,722 --> 00:32:08,722
She told us everything.

439
00:32:10,021 --> 00:32:11,007
All of you?

440
00:32:11,007 --> 00:32:11,861
Mm.

441
00:32:11,861 --> 00:32:12,774
Shit.

442
00:32:13,647 --> 00:32:15,130
Why did you ask if you already knew?

443
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,001
Why not?

444
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,126
Where are you going?

445
00:32:38,203 --> 00:32:41,121
I think I’m sick. I have a fever.

446
00:32:42,542 --> 00:32:44,542
What did you do?

447
00:32:45,122 --> 00:32:47,524
I probably did too much cardio the other day

448
00:32:47,524 --> 00:32:52,260
and I think the aircon at the cinema was too cold.

449
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,679
Have you taken any medicine?

450
00:32:55,032 --> 00:32:56,642
Do tepid sponge.

451
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:59,118
Remember to use water at room temperature.

452
00:33:05,202 --> 00:33:08,446
I’ve just only realized the feelings of weary plants.

453
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:12,604
How good they feel when a person waters and takes care of them.

A gardener’s motto.

455
00:33:22,497 --> 00:33:23,368
Hey, Looksorn.

456
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:24,059
T-Rex.

457
00:33:24,191 --> 00:33:26,937
Wow, you look beautiful.

458
00:33:26,937 --> 00:33:28,021
Really?

459
00:33:28,212 --> 00:33:30,334
Hey. Why are you here?

460
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:35,354
You said you were sick, so I made you some porridge.

461
00:33:40,555 --> 00:33:42,555
Don’t hurt my friend.

462
00:33:42,952 --> 00:33:44,780
Please take care of my friend.

463
00:33:45,884 --> 00:33:47,788
I want to eat that porridge.

464
00:33:47,788 --> 00:33:49,134
You can eat it.

465
00:33:51,994 --> 00:33:54,989
You’re sick. Why aren’t you in bed, resting?

466
00:33:55,662 --> 00:33:59,595
I was, but I got bored so I got up to walk around a bit.

467
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:04,815
Why are you wearing red lipstick today?

468
00:34:05,408 --> 00:34:06,777
You also curled your hair.

469
00:34:07,733 --> 00:34:10,977
Well, you told your friends that I wasn’t pretty

470
00:34:10,977 --> 00:34:12,843
so I did a complete makeover today.

471
00:34:14,807 --> 00:34:15,755
Huh?

472
00:34:15,755 --> 00:34:18,681
Next time, hang up the phone before talking to your friends.

473
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,071
Oh.

474
00:34:20,545 --> 00:34:23,042
What else did you hear?

475
00:34:23,042 --> 00:34:24,701
Am I pretty enough now?

476
00:34:26,787 --> 00:34:27,945
Yes,

477
00:34:29,112 --> 00:34:30,194
but,

478
00:34:31,131 --> 00:34:32,642
don’t wear that lipstick next time.

479
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,026
Why not?

480
00:34:35,026 --> 00:34:36,395
I don’t want you to be pretty.

481
00:34:37,378 --> 00:34:38,938
Are you crazy?

482
00:34:38,938 --> 00:34:41,162
Everyone likes pretty girls.

483
00:34:41,296 --> 00:34:42,606
I like that you’re not pretty.

484
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,202
Should I be happy or angry?

485
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:49,442
Happy, of course.

486
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,622
Because I like you for who you are.

487
00:34:54,287 --> 00:34:55,388
Silly.

488
00:34:55,483 --> 00:34:56,622
What are you talking about?

489
00:34:57,272 --> 00:34:59,387
Now that I decide what tree I’m going to grow,

490
00:34:59,387 --> 00:35:02,439
I don’t care if it’s going to give me beautiful fruits

491
00:35:02,439 --> 00:35:03,717
like the other trees or not.

492
00:35:03,731 --> 00:35:07,912
I just want to take as good care of it as a gardener can.

00:35:37,479 --> 00:35:38,733
You went to the mall?

496
00:35:39,134 --> 00:35:40,503
Who did you go with?

497
00:35:41,498 --> 00:35:42,905
My childhood friend.

498
00:35:43,229 --> 00:35:44,202
Guy friend?

499
00:35:44,202 --> 00:35:45,178
No, girl friend.

500
00:35:45,178 --> 00:35:46,034
A girl?

501
00:35:46,034 --> 00:35:48,619
Your first love? Hmm?

502
00:35:49,442 --> 00:35:53,202
It’s great that you remember your childhood friends.

503
00:35:53,763 --> 00:35:55,763
That’s normal. I do, too.

504
00:35:57,122 --> 00:35:59,122
Why are you scared of good news?

505
00:35:59,812 --> 00:36:01,544
I guess I don’t want to be disappointed.

506
00:36:01,544 --> 00:36:02,761
How’s my mother?

507
00:36:04,698 --> 00:36:05,922
Auntie Wan

508
00:36:05,922 --> 00:36:07,207
I’ll be there right away.

509
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:12,081
I’m just scared that

510
00:36:14,434 --> 00:36:16,002
good news

511
00:36:17,888 --> 00:36:19,888
might not actually be good news.
