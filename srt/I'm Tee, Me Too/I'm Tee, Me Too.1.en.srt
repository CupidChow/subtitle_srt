1
00:00:44,934 --> 00:00:46,374
Isn't this house beautiful?

2
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:51,314
He is around 20 years old now

3
00:00:51,554 --> 00:00:53,394
Since it has been taken care of well,

4
00:00:53,394 --> 00:00:55,394
It still looks new

5
00:00:55,714 --> 00:00:57,934
Comfortable whenever you look at it

6
00:01:03,094 --> 00:01:04,934
But this is not my home

7
00:01:05,314 --> 00:01:06,494
I rent it

8
00:01:07,494 --> 00:01:09,074
This guy is the owner of the house

9
00:01:09,814 --> 00:01:12,594
It's called T, short for Watty

10
00:01:14,354 --> 00:01:17,154
There was a reason he decided to rent it

11
00:01:17,154 --> 00:01:19,474
And why is he sleeping here

12
00:01:25,014 --> 00:01:26,014
It is true

13
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,074
Because his mother passed away

14
00:01:31,594 --> 00:01:33,594
Throughout his 21 years of life

15
00:01:33,954 --> 00:01:37,194
He had no one in his family tree except for his mother

16
00:01:38,854 --> 00:01:41,614
He has no other relatives left in this country

17
00:01:42,034 --> 00:01:45,374
He has lived with loneliness for nearly a month

18
00:01:46,114 --> 00:01:50,614
In a house like a diary full of memories of his mother

19
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:56,374
Then he discovered that his mother's house had been passed on to him

20
00:01:56,734 --> 00:01:58,394
It won't be him anymore

21
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:02,054
[Payment reminder]

22
00:02:05,254 --> 00:02:09,054
Because the mortgage for this house has not been paid for 6 months

23
00:02:09,494 --> 00:02:11,334
Approximately 40,000 baht per month

24
00:02:20,334 --> 00:02:22,774
This add-on is just starting

25
00:02:22,774 --> 00:02:25,914
It cannot cover more than the daily expenses of a third-year architecture student

26
00:02:26,534 --> 00:02:28,514
You can't help him keep this house

27
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:55,634
It was Wattie's last director ...

28
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:36,934
attention please! A house near the university is available for rent

29
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:39,614
Four men are welcome to stay in two bedrooms

30
00:03:39,614 --> 00:03:43,174
Contact me if you are interested. Only men with "T" names are acceptable

31
00:03:43,674 --> 00:03:47,314
Watty got a response in less than a week

32
00:03:47,314 --> 00:03:49,734
There are five tenants in his house now

33
00:03:49,894 --> 00:03:51,254
And they are t,

34
00:03:51,634 --> 00:03:54,194
T, T, T, and T.

35
00:03:54,414 --> 00:03:55,974
Everyone is called T.

36
00:03:55,974 --> 00:04:01,554
If you think that a group of people living together is a strange coincidence

37
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:06,354
You will be surprised more than to come

38
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:12,034
The first "T" is Watty

39
00:05:12,034 --> 00:05:13,874
The definition of his name on Google is

40
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,414
Speaker, speaker, pointer

41
00:05:16,414 --> 00:05:18,974
The name that his mother gave him is like jinx

42
00:05:18,974 --> 00:05:21,434
Because he doesn't talk to anyone about anything but rent

43
00:05:21,434 --> 00:05:21,954
Wati

44
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:22,994
Can I borrow your phone charger?

45
00:05:22,994 --> 00:05:23,914
My rent?

46
00:05:23,914 --> 00:05:24,528
I'll pay you later

47
00:05:24,528 --> 00:05:25,274
Let me borrow the charger first

48
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:26,054
You are the only one left

49
00:05:26,054 --> 00:05:27,454
Won't you talk about anything else?

50
00:05:27,454 --> 00:05:28,394
My rental

51
00:05:29,254 --> 00:05:31,574
Let me borrow the charger first. My phone is about to drain its battery

52
00:05:32,294 --> 00:05:33,294
8000 baht

53
00:05:37,314 --> 00:05:38,254
If not necessary,

54
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:42,454
It will not approach anyone within a radius of one meter or maybe even wider

55
00:05:42,714 --> 00:05:44,634
He never asked anyone to do anything for him

56
00:05:44,634 --> 00:05:46,094
He never accepts anyone's goodwill

57
00:05:46,094 --> 00:05:46,654
I will not take it

58
00:05:46,654 --> 00:05:47,174
No

59
00:05:47,334 --> 00:05:47,914
I'm not going

60
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,194
No

61
00:05:49,194 --> 00:05:49,974
You forgot to close your pants zipper

62
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:50,534
No!

63
00:05:55,194 --> 00:05:56,154
From what I see,

64
00:05:56,154 --> 00:05:59,174
He might have pestanthrophobia

65
00:05:59,214 --> 00:06:01,574
Or fear of trusting other people he does not know

66
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:03,694
If it wasn't because his house was about to be confiscated,

67
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:06,734
When someone was allowed to set foot inside

68
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:09,034
The second "T" is the tidet

69
00:06:09,174 --> 00:06:11,194
Third year student of the Faculty of Forestry

70
00:06:11,194 --> 00:06:12,434
Extremely slender

71
00:06:12,434 --> 00:06:13,254
Shit!

72
00:06:13,334 --> 00:06:15,614
I can even eat shit now. I'm cursed starving

73
00:06:16,054 --> 00:06:17,614
Today is so damn hot

74
00:06:17,614 --> 00:06:20,094
Dwarf, my testicles are burning here. Faster !

75
00:06:20,094 --> 00:06:21,694
Couldn't your short legs ride the bike faster?

76
00:06:21,794 --> 00:06:23,694
He is sluggish and arrogant

77
00:06:23,694 --> 00:06:25,994
He likes to curse and talk nonsense

78
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,814
But with plants, he can be really cute

79
00:06:28,814 --> 00:06:30,974
Let me see how are you, my dear

80
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:33,434
Get some water and be fresh

81
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:37,574
Be strong, okay? Am I watering you enough?

82
00:06:37,574 --> 00:06:42,094
Tedit is a man who routinely exercises

83
00:06:42,094 --> 00:06:43,394
He is not afraid of obesity or anything

84
00:06:43,394 --> 00:06:44,534
He is afraid of something else

85
00:06:44,814 --> 00:06:47,894
"T" III is an exciting classical musician

86
00:06:47,894 --> 00:06:49,974
He changes his appointments often like

87
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:51,514
Change it to classic musical notes

88
00:06:51,514 --> 00:06:53,614
He is the most exciting third-year student in the College of Music

89
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:54,814
His name is T-Do

90
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,214
In fact, his name is not strange

91
00:06:57,214 --> 00:06:58,194
why not ?

92
00:06:58,494 --> 00:06:59,894
My name is T.

93
00:07:00,114 --> 00:07:01,894
Only "T" will not work

94
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:02,874
Huh?

95
00:07:03,374 --> 00:07:05,274
We have a lot of people called "T" here

96
00:07:05,494 --> 00:07:06,654
Let's do this then

97
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:07,974
call me...

98
00:07:08,354 --> 00:07:09,634
Yeeeeeee

99
00:07:09,974 --> 00:07:10,474
OK?

100
00:07:11,394 --> 00:07:12,054
What?

101
00:07:12,854 --> 00:07:15,674
There are seven children in my family

102
00:07:15,674 --> 00:07:20,794
Do, Ri, Mi, Fa, Sol, No, then I ...

103
00:07:20,794 --> 00:07:21,594
Yeeeeeee

104
00:07:21,594 --> 00:07:23,114
Dooooo!

105
00:07:26,114 --> 00:07:27,414
Then we'll call you T-Do

106
00:07:27,554 --> 00:07:28,794
This is ugly

107
00:07:28,974 --> 00:07:31,214
Tiii. it is easy

108
00:07:31,214 --> 00:07:32,854
Hey, my ass

109
00:07:32,854 --> 00:07:34,094
Tii. Try again

110
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:35,494
Tiii

111
00:07:35,494 --> 00:07:36,334
Out of tune

112
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:38,254
Yeeeeeee

113
00:07:38,634 --> 00:07:39,514
Yeeeeeee

114
00:07:39,734 --> 00:07:41,734
This is very blatant. You can train again later

115
00:07:42,114 --> 00:07:43,494
Your doo was out of the tune too

116
00:07:43,554 --> 00:07:45,174
Dooooooooooo !!

117
00:07:45,394 --> 00:07:48,294
T fourth is the oldest and tougher in this house

118
00:07:48,294 --> 00:07:50,794
Fourth year student of the Department of Food Sciences

119
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:53,474
It is a perfectionist in many ways

120
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:54,714
His name is Mighty

121
00:07:55,154 --> 00:07:58,554
He might seem like a typical and careful person

122
00:07:58,854 --> 00:07:59,594
Mighty

123
00:08:00,174 --> 00:08:02,194
Want to hear the good or bad news first?

124
00:08:02,954 --> 00:08:03,994
The bad news

125
00:08:04,174 --> 00:08:04,674
Hmm?

126
00:08:04,674 --> 00:08:06,594
I'm afraid of the good news. I don't want to hear it

127
00:08:06,594 --> 00:08:11,214
I can't think of any reasons why someone might be afraid of the good news

128
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:12,794
I'll start with the bad news first then

129
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:15,194
The bad news is that the ice cubes you asked me to buy are running out

130
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,274
The good news is ...

131
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:17,994
I got you iced water instead

132
00:08:21,214 --> 00:08:22,494
How is this good news?

133
00:08:22,714 --> 00:08:24,894
I asked you to buy me an ice cube because I want an ice cube

134
00:08:24,974 --> 00:08:26,514
I need it to make my juice

135
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,754
I can't make juice with your chilled water, can I?

136
00:08:30,194 --> 00:08:32,834
I'll drink it then. I am thirsty

137
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,174
I need more time to notice

138
00:08:36,174 --> 00:08:40,294
Whether he really suffers from euphobia or a fear of good news

139
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:43,374
You brought your boyfriend here often, right?

140
00:08:43,374 --> 00:08:46,714
No, A-CRA-DJI-NET-BRAST. I love you

141
00:08:46,814 --> 00:08:49,794
This guy is the fifth "T". It's Mi T

142
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:52,814
He is a third-year student and senior screenwriter from the College of Communication Arts

143
00:08:52,814 --> 00:08:55,154
Contrast with the cool looks of this communication arts student,

144
00:08:55,154 --> 00:08:59,854
His play is no different from a prime time drama

145
00:08:59,854 --> 00:09:01,034
What was that?

146
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:03,434
No one calls people by their first and last name in real life

147
00:09:03,434 --> 00:09:05,254
This was his first name only

148
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:05,914
Huh?

149
00:09:06,474 --> 00:09:08,034
A-CRA-Dig-NET-BRAST?

150
00:09:08,594 --> 00:09:10,194
The name is awesome

151
00:09:10,194 --> 00:09:11,754
It is perfect for topping on Twitter

152
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:20,674
Another thing that did not go along with his cool looks is ...

153
00:09:20,674 --> 00:09:23,734
That he has phobia or simply,

154
00:09:23,734 --> 00:09:25,614
He is very afraid of ghosts

155
00:09:25,614 --> 00:09:28,294
Even in the daytime, he was still afraid

156
00:09:31,694 --> 00:09:32,914
Are you still there?

157
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:34,514
Yes

158
00:09:35,194 --> 00:09:36,094
And short?

159
00:09:36,514 --> 00:09:37,334
Here

160
00:09:37,594 --> 00:09:39,254
Your stools smell very stinky

161
00:09:39,254 --> 00:09:40,934
Your grandmother's feces smell nice or what?

162
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:42,494
At least my grandmother shuts the bathroom door

163
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:43,454
OK

164
00:09:43,454 --> 00:09:44,674
I'm a T-Rex

165
00:09:44,674 --> 00:09:46,914
Student in the second year of the Faculty of Psychology

166
00:09:46,914 --> 00:09:49,154
I'm T's sixth in this house

167
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:53,774
I decided to live here because I suffer from my own phobia too

168
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:59,394
But that's not the only reason I'm here

169
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:04,214
I think there must be something

170
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:07,654
In that closet we were prevented from approaching

171
00:10:08,114 --> 00:10:09,954
Probably...

172

174
00:10:23,796 --> 00:10:25,996
two weeks ago…

175
00:10:32,536 --> 00:10:34,136
Hello

176
00:10:34,596 --> 00:10:39,596
I saw a post about zoning your home. Do you still have rooms available?

177
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,195
No. Fully booked

178
00:10:41,196 --> 00:10:42,756
wait!

179
00:10:44,016 --> 00:10:46,196
You must be the owner of the house

180
00:10:46,376 --> 00:10:48,436
I am an easy person

181
00:10:48,436 --> 00:10:49,716
I can sleep anywhere

182
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,216
Can I just stay with you guys, please?

183
00:10:51,956 --> 00:10:53,076
I told you the house is full

184
00:10:53,076 --> 00:10:54,196
Slown down

185
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:57,636
I've been sleeping alone for two weeks now

186
00:10:57,636 --> 00:10:59,276
I cannot find a roommate

187
00:10:59,476 --> 00:11:01,296
You must be scum then

188
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:04,816
Not finding a roommate does not mean I'm scum

189
00:11:04,976 --> 00:11:05,676
Sorry

190
00:11:05,976 --> 00:11:06,816
I just lost my tongue

191
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:08,476
It was not a slip

192
00:11:08,476 --> 00:11:09,576
You just got a dirty tongue

193
00:11:10,656 --> 00:11:11,985
Are you an easy person?

194
00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:13,496
Can you sleep anywhere? It is true.

195
00:11:13,496 --> 00:11:16,596
Is an easy person who can sleep anywhere willing to pay the rent in full?

196
00:11:16,596 --> 00:11:18,596
Certainly. no problem

197
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:21,313
How many people live here?

198
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,059
If I count you, then six

199
00:11:23,156 --> 00:11:23,816
Six people?

200
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:26,076
That's cool. The higher the number the more fun

201
00:11:26,613 --> 00:11:27,556
What is your name?

202
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:28,650
Mi T.

203
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,388
You can just call me T, in short

204
00:11:31,348 --> 00:11:32,764
I prefer calling you by your full name then

205
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,875
You want me to sleep here, Mr. Owner?

206
00:11:41,616 --> 00:11:43,073
All rooms are taken

207
00:11:43,073 --> 00:11:44,596
And you said you can sleep anywhere

208
00:11:46,776 --> 00:11:48,594
If you agree to sleep here,

209
00:11:48,594 --> 00:11:50,051
Will I have a roommate?

210
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:51,003
No

211
00:11:51,216 --> 00:11:52,556
Everyone has roommates beforehand

212
00:11:53,556 --> 00:11:56,976
But there are three bedrooms and five people live here

213
00:11:57,076 --> 00:11:58,416
There should be one place left

214
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:00,256
Who is going astray?

215
00:12:00,823 --> 00:12:01,394
I am

216
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:04,777
Can I be your roommate?

217
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:05,569
No

218
00:12:06,201 --> 00:12:07,316
I don't share my room with anyone

219
00:12:07,697 --> 00:12:09,113
I will pay 2,000 baht more

220
00:12:09,502 --> 00:12:11,643
But I will not sleep here

221
00:12:13,356 --> 00:12:14,896
You can take my room. I'll sleep here instead

222
00:12:15,096 --> 00:12:15,676
What?

223
00:12:16,316 --> 00:12:18,076
This means that I will sleep on my own?

224
00:12:18,076 --> 00:12:20,316
If I stay on my own, I won't pay extra

225
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:20,942
What?

226
00:12:22,803 --> 00:12:23,476
O short

227
00:12:24,422 --> 00:12:25,275
help me

228
00:12:40,656 --> 00:12:42,414
Why does this room look so cute?

229
00:12:42,414 --> 00:12:43,850
His wife's room?

230
00:12:44,015 --> 00:12:46,015
I don't think he has a girlfriend

231
00:12:46,216 --> 00:12:47,676
It may be his mother's room

232
00:12:47,776 --> 00:12:48,616
His mother?

233
00:12:49,576 --> 00:12:50,886
Where is it then?

234
00:12:50,886 --> 00:12:51,636
And his father, too

235
00:12:51,996 --> 00:12:52,876
I have no idea

236
00:12:53,211 --> 00:12:54,788
All I only know is that they don't live together

237
00:12:55,086 --> 00:12:56,422
By the way, short

238
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:57,976
what's your name?

239
00:12:57,976 --> 00:12:58,516
T-Rex

240
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,176
T-Rex, my name is Mi Tee

241
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:02,964
You can only call me t

242
00:13:02,964 --> 00:13:04,441
Only "T" will not work

243
00:13:04,441 --> 00:13:05,173
and why is that?

244
00:13:07,143 --> 00:13:10,250
Mi T, why can't you sleep alone?

245
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:13,604
Be calm

246
00:13:25,336 --> 00:13:26,390
What are you doing?

247
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,992
I'm new here

248
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:31,656
So I buy this bed from its previous owner

249
00:13:32,136 --> 00:13:33,836
Are you afraid of ghosts to this degree?

250
00:13:33,836 --> 00:13:34,336
You are!

251
00:13:35,076 --> 00:13:37,076
Fear is a strong word

252
00:13:39,334 --> 00:13:39,865
No

253
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:42,697
I just feel uncomfortable sleeping on my own

254
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,342
And I'm very good at visualizing things

255
00:13:47,556 --> 00:13:48,227
That treasury

256
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:52,336
You guys can't touch it no matter what

257
00:13:52,902 --> 00:13:53,674
And now ...

258
00:13:55,976 --> 00:13:58,456
I think there must be something

259
00:13:58,456 --> 00:14:02,956
In that closet we were prevented from approaching

260
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,238
Probably…

261
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:13,196
This locker

262
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:16,275
It is the place where demons are trapped

263
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:19,795
Are you so delusional?

264
00:14:19,795 --> 00:14:21,372
Looks like you've watched a lot of scary movies

265
00:14:24,706 --> 00:14:25,639
In fact ,

266
00:14:26,896 --> 00:14:28,596
I don't like being alone either

267
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:32,064
That is not because I am afraid of ghosts

268
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,276
What are you afraid of then?

269
00:14:36,905 --> 00:14:38,905
Actually, my name isn't T-Rex

270
00:14:39,614 --> 00:14:41,614
I asked my dad to change it when I was in middle school

271
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,917
My name is T ...

272
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,156
T Lake? (Lik meaning short / small)

273
00:14:45,156 --> 00:14:47,296
T Lake! T Lake! T Lake!

274
00:14:52,936 --> 00:14:55,376
So your name was T. Lake

275
00:14:55,676 --> 00:14:57,676
You're the younger kid, right?

276
00:14:57,776 --> 00:14:58,276
No

277
00:14:59,563 --> 00:15:01,120
I am the only child

278
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,677
That's why I don't like being alone

279
00:15:06,476 --> 00:15:08,476
I always hated school vacations so much

280
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:10,891
It was so boring

281
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,940
One day for a lonely child was way too long

282
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:20,513
I do not fully understand that

283
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:24,471
But if you don't like sleeping alone either,

284
00:15:24,471 --> 00:15:26,471
You can sleep with me here

285
00:15:26,471 --> 00:15:28,833
Let that foul-mouthed man sleep alone

286
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:37,316
From the outside, it looks like a good roommate

287
00:15:41,224 --> 00:15:42,338
except…

288
00:15:51,114 --> 00:15:52,711
Have you finished chanting?

289
00:15:52,893 --> 00:15:53,927
Not yet

290
00:15:54,016 --> 00:15:55,734
Do not interrupt me

291
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:57,734
My hierarchy is all messed up now

292
00:16:27,556 --> 00:16:29,556
Our house can be a little noisy these days

293
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:33,594
But six months from now,

294
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:36,436
I will make them leave

295
00:16:38,803 --> 00:16:39,857
and then…

296
00:16:41,113 --> 00:16:43,113
Only you and I will be in this house again

297
00:16:57,556 --> 00:16:59,053
Welcome to this house, Mi T

298
00:17:00,182 --> 00:17:01,377
welcome?

299
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,097
Shouldn't the homeowner say that?

300
00:17:04,568 --> 00:17:05,475
OK…

301
00:17:05,854 --> 00:17:07,331
Nice to meet you then

302
00:17:07,556 --> 00:17:09,133
So you all know each other now, right?

303
00:17:16,228 --> 00:17:17,302
Rule # 1

304
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:19,900
You cannot pay the rent after the start date of each month

305
00:17:20,544 --> 00:17:22,001
I ask this on behalf of everyone

306
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:23,155
What if we're late a day or two?

307
00:17:23,155 --> 00:17:23,847
You can't

308
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,612
I need money

309
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,666
You're broke, right?

310
00:17:34,464 --> 00:17:35,476
Rule # 2

311
00:17:35,612 --> 00:17:37,612
Don't go out of your room after midnight

312
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,156
when?

313
00:17:39,436 --> 00:17:41,316
Because I sleep in the common area here

314
00:17:41,316 --> 00:17:42,936
I don't like people walking around

315
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,136
Rule # 3

316
00:17:45,136 --> 00:17:47,696
Do not move any objects that do not belong to you

317
00:17:47,716 --> 00:17:50,596
Especially the things in your room, MiT and T-Rex

318
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:52,996
Rule # 4

319
00:17:53,117 --> 00:17:55,316
You cannot enter someone else's room without permission

320
00:17:55,316 --> 00:17:56,522
Rule # 5

321
00:17:56,522 --> 00:17:58,522
Do not bring strangers into this house

322
00:17:58,522 --> 00:17:59,113
Rule # 6

323
00:17:59,113 --> 00:18:01,113
You should help keep this home clean

324
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:01,949
Rule # 7

325
00:18:01,949 --> 00:18:03,949
You will be charged 100 baht for any garbage outside the litter box

326
00:18:04,265 --> 00:18:04,957
Rule # 8

327
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,702
You will be charged 500 baht for leaving the lights on unnecessarily

328
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:08,902
Rule # 9

329
00:18:09,204 --> 00:18:11,204
You will be charged 10,000 baht for operating the stove after midnight

330
00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:13,050
Rule # 10

331
00:18:13,395 --> 00:18:15,395
If you leave the water open, you will be fined ...

332
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:16,469
How many zeros are there?

333
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:19,497
Million?

334
00:18:23,781 --> 00:18:24,714
are you crazy?

335
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:26,836
What the fuck is that?

336
00:18:26,978 --> 00:18:28,978
Why are there so many rules?

337
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,123
This is madness

338
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,859
Wouldn't you ever argue?

339
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:34,235
I don't mind this

340
00:18:34,235 --> 00:18:36,235
It's like rules of the game. That must be fun

341
00:18:36,678 --> 00:18:37,556
you are strange

342
00:18:38,248 --> 00:18:40,248
I forgot to add another rule

343
00:18:41,977 --> 00:18:43,252
The last rule

344
00:18:45,528 --> 00:18:47,528
I can expel you at any time

345
00:18:47,924 --> 00:18:48,515
if?

346
00:18:50,612 --> 00:18:51,263
so what?

347
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,762
There is no "if"

348
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:57,997
And you guys can be as close to each other as you want

349
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,227
But with me,

350
00:18:59,227 --> 00:19:01,006
You must keep your distance

351
00:19:20,188 --> 00:19:22,556
Can we even drink that now? He said don't move things

352
00:19:22,637 --> 00:19:23,562
Who came

353
00:19:23,636 --> 00:19:24,448
I will handle this

354
00:19:29,651 --> 00:19:31,067
Does T live here?

355
00:20:07,794 --> 00:20:09,106
Hi Wattie

356
00:20:09,112 --> 00:20:10,212
Did you wake up?

357
00:20:14,572 --> 00:20:15,632
Would you like some breakfast?

358
00:20:18,572 --> 00:20:19,192
No

359
00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:21,712
Breakfast is a very important meal

360
00:20:22,712 --> 00:20:25,772
Your memory is not good because you are skipping breakfast

361
00:20:26,732 --> 00:20:27,672
Memory of what?

362
00:20:29,112 --> 00:20:32,132
I asked if we had met before

363
00:20:32,912 --> 00:20:34,992
Your memory is even worse than mine

364
00:20:35,452 --> 00:20:37,452
I already told you that I can't remember

365
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:40,572
Let me guess

366
00:20:40,852 --> 00:20:43,292
You are about to set another rule

367
00:20:43,912 --> 00:20:45,972
Don't make breakfast before I wake up

368
00:20:46,593 --> 00:20:47,831
Are you making fun

369
00:20:47,972 --> 00:20:49,063
No

370
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,456
It's your sleeping area here

371
00:20:54,946 --> 00:20:55,987
You are!

372
00:20:56,184 --> 00:20:57,176
What?

373
00:20:58,732 --> 00:21:00,452
Do you think my rules are overrated?

374
00:21:02,452 --> 00:21:06,052
If we ignore the million fine that I know you were just kidding,

375
00:21:06,837 --> 00:21:09,940
The rest is OK. I'm fine

376
00:21:10,412 --> 00:21:12,652
No. The fine is no joke

377
00:21:13,492 --> 00:21:15,172
I would do anything that would make me make money

378
00:21:22,012 --> 00:21:22,972
Suppose

379
00:21:22,978 --> 00:21:26,994
Tomorrow I will cook a light smelling breakfast

380
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,649
And I'll be very quiet

381
00:21:29,732 --> 00:21:32,472
I woke up because of the sunshine anyway

382
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:34,852
Who came

383
00:21:36,032 --> 00:21:37,152
I'll open it

384
00:21:43,912 --> 00:21:44,852
Hello

385
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:46,492
Does T live here?

386
00:21:46,934 --> 00:21:48,132
I t

387
00:21:49,023 --> 00:21:50,262
Not you

388
00:21:50,262 --> 00:21:51,972
Is there any other t live here?

389
00:21:52,218 --> 00:21:53,225
No

390
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:54,635
I am the owner of the house

391
00:21:54,635 --> 00:21:55,812
Who are you anyway?

392
00:21:55,812 --> 00:21:56,872
You can leave now

393
00:21:57,872 --> 00:21:58,932
Mr

394
00:22:08,052 --> 00:22:09,286
please

395
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,286
Is there any live here?

396
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:13,069
Except for T, the homeowner

397
00:22:13,561 --> 00:22:14,739
IT too

398
00:22:14,739 --> 00:22:15,918
My name is T-Rex

399
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:18,238
What are you looking for?

400
00:22:18,238 --> 00:22:20,238
All the people who live here are called T.

401
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:23,372
T that is not fat or skinny

402
00:22:23,372 --> 00:22:27,093
And I think he's taller than you ...

403
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:29,892
Much longer

404
00:22:30,408 --> 00:22:31,431
Oh!

405
00:22:31,431 --> 00:22:33,690
I can't help you with that

406
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,337
If you want to go in, call him

407
00:22:36,337 --> 00:22:38,332
Because they are all taller than me

408
00:22:50,532 --> 00:22:51,592
Hey!

409
00:22:55,932 --> 00:22:57,132
Ace ...

410
00:23:01,892 --> 00:23:03,412
Won't you apologize?

411
00:23:06,792 --> 00:23:08,152
Sorry…

412
00:23:08,158 --> 00:23:09,052
What?

413
00:23:09,052 --> 00:23:10,505
I'm sorry

414
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:12,305
Does T live here, by the way?

415
00:23:12,305 --> 00:23:14,305
No…

416
00:23:14,305 --> 00:23:16,305
Does T live here?

417
00:23:16,305 --> 00:23:17,076
No…

418
00:23:17,076 --> 00:23:18,092
What did you say?

419
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,732
No…

420
00:23:45,432 --> 00:23:46,512
O Master!

421
00:23:47,012 --> 00:23:47,692
O Master!

422
00:23:47,856 --> 00:23:48,940
wait!

423
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,981
O Master!

424
00:23:49,981 --> 00:23:50,812
wait!

425
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:53,168
Are you fine?

426
00:23:53,172 --> 00:23:54,132
You are!

427
00:23:56,132 --> 00:23:56,852
You are!

428
00:23:57,732 --> 00:23:58,392
Help me!

429
00:23:58,392 --> 00:23:59,972
Someone fainted

430
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:01,032
O Master!

431
00:24:02,252 --> 00:24:03,332
Tedit !!

432
00:24:10,272 --> 00:24:12,269
what happened? Why did I faint?

433
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:13,482
You!

434
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:24,417
He really brought a girl here

435
00:24:25,892 --> 00:24:27,203
I'll make him leave now

436
00:24:28,629 --> 00:24:31,178
Hey! What if we focus on a tedit here?

437
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,817
He is still unconscious. It looks bad

438
00:24:33,817 --> 00:24:35,571
Just let him talk to that girl

439
00:24:35,571 --> 00:24:36,453
Tedit

440
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
Don't die in my house

441
00:24:48,092 --> 00:24:49,312
get up

442
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,092
Tedit

443
00:24:54,012 --> 00:24:54,672
You are!

444
00:25:03,092 --> 00:25:04,632
So who is this girl?

445
00:25:06,632 --> 00:25:08,192
my ex-girlfriend

446
00:25:09,912 --> 00:25:11,172
Your ex-girlfriend?

447
00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:12,945
How did you get involved in this?

448
00:25:13,854 --> 00:25:15,975
It is about to be ...

449
00:25:15,975 --> 00:25:17,272
my ex-girlfriend

450
00:25:17,912 --> 00:25:19,352
Your girlfriend who's about to be an ex?

451
00:25:20,672 --> 00:25:21,166
Yeah

452
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:22,895
So she is your ex-girlfriend

453
00:25:23,018 --> 00:25:24,352
Are you here for him?

454
00:25:24,932 --> 00:25:26,052
This

455
00:25:27,872 --> 00:25:28,592
TDo

456
00:25:31,612 --> 00:25:33,452
You broke rule number 5

457
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,670
You brought a stranger into this house

458
00:25:35,972 --> 00:25:37,972
Go collect your belongings and leave with it

459
00:25:37,972 --> 00:25:39,312
wait

460
00:25:39,312 --> 00:25:40,902
You came to see me on her own

461
00:25:40,902 --> 00:25:42,902
I didn't ask her to come

462
00:25:43,148 --> 00:25:44,205
Oh really?

463
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:46,355
They didn't invite me here

464
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:50,692
He would rather avoid me and vanish as he does now

465
00:25:56,001 --> 00:25:57,878
So what's wrong I did, t?

466
00:25:58,545 --> 00:26:00,545
If you don't love me anymore, just say it

467
00:26:02,245 --> 00:26:04,245
It's not that I don't love you

468
00:26:04,786 --> 00:26:05,932
But…

469
00:26:07,308 --> 00:26:09,308
If you're still lagging behind, I'll tell her to leave now

470
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:14,778
Just tell me the real reason

471
00:26:15,036 --> 00:26:18,372
I promise not to text you, call you, or go into this house again

472
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:25,112
it's a…

473
00:26:26,612 --> 00:26:28,612
I disappeared from you because ...

474
00:26:37,058 --> 00:26:38,532
You're chewing out loud, you

475
00:26:38,532 --> 00:26:39,428
What?

476
00:26:40,603 --> 00:26:43,193
This is the reason for your desire to separate?

477
00:26:44,121 --> 00:26:45,162
You are!

478
00:26:45,162 --> 00:26:46,400
If you don't like her, tell her

479
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,952
This reason is crazy

480
00:26:51,772 --> 00:26:53,992
Chewing sound so loud when I eat?

481
00:26:59,372 --> 00:27:00,432
You!

482
00:27:00,432 --> 00:27:01,472
what are you doing?

483
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:06,072
What are you doing, you?

484
00:27:07,852 --> 00:27:09,372
Is this too loud for you?

485
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:11,652
Stop chewing. It's annoying

486
00:27:11,655 --> 00:27:12,379
High?

487
00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:13,452
Can you hear it there?

488
00:27:14,042 --> 00:27:15,988
It's normal

489
00:27:15,988 --> 00:27:17,732
That short said it wasn't loud

490
00:27:19,952 --> 00:27:20,452
You, stop it!

491
00:27:20,452 --> 00:27:21,432
You are chewing loudly

492
00:27:22,012 --> 00:27:22,832
that's not true

493
00:27:22,982 --> 00:27:23,696
Yeah

494
00:27:23,696 --> 00:27:25,272
No, it is not

495
00:27:25,272 --> 00:27:26,452
just listen

496
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:28,752
its enough! I can hear you chewing

497
00:27:28,752 --> 00:27:30,132
No you can not

498
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:31,012
Yes, I can

499
00:27:31,012 --> 00:27:32,225
I don't chomp on it

500
00:27:32,225 --> 00:27:33,384
Yeah

501
00:27:33,507 --> 00:27:35,298
Swallow it up. its enough

502
00:27:35,298 --> 00:27:38,060
No, I am not chewing loudly

503
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,742
I told you to stop!

504
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:39,452
You are!

505
00:27:52,932 --> 00:27:54,432
A million reasons to choose

506
00:27:55,103 --> 00:27:58,848
And you say we can't be together because I'm chewing out loud

507
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:01,250
I'm normal

508
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,663
True?

509
00:28:04,772 --> 00:28:05,961
is not it?

510
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:11,858
You villain!

511
00:28:12,128 --> 00:28:14,852
My friends warned me about being playful

512
00:28:14,852 --> 00:28:16,612
You change girls all the time

513
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:19,988
I just didn't think your excuse for breaking up could be this nonsense

514
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,712
Am I chewing loudly?

515
00:28:32,532 --> 00:28:34,212
I really told you the truth

516
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:36,292
Whether you believe it or not

517
00:28:41,129 --> 00:28:44,235
It is the most ridiculous reason to be abandoned

518
00:28:53,501 --> 00:28:55,172
I came to give you this back

519
00:28:55,603 --> 00:28:58,751
I hope I never see you again in this life

520
00:29:01,093 --> 00:29:02,208
Move

521
00:29:52,032 --> 00:29:53,532
How did this dog get here?

522
00:29:57,032 --> 00:30:02,152
And here comes the beginning of the disaster in this house

523
00:30:26,152 --> 00:30:27,712
What will you do with the dog?

524
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:31,172
I do not know

525
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,813
I need time to find a solution

526
00:30:34,951 --> 00:30:36,607
Then I'll give you time

527
00:30:37,787 --> 00:30:40,103
I will be back for your answer at 8 PM

528
00:30:40,292 --> 00:30:42,095
If you still can't find a way out,

529
00:30:42,212 --> 00:30:44,212
You will be the first to get out of this house

530
00:30:55,455 --> 00:30:58,372
Who would have thought that at 8 pm,

531
00:30:58,372 --> 00:31:00,962
Wasn't T-Do the only one left?

532
00:31:00,962 --> 00:31:02,178
But…

533
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:04,528
All of you, get out of my house

534
00:31:16,201 --> 00:31:18,988
The reason he's here is because

535
00:31:18,988 --> 00:31:23,225
His father, mother, and six brothers are all musicians

536
00:31:23,225 --> 00:31:26,479
His house is flooded with music all the time

537
00:31:59,432 --> 00:32:02,392
He has said that he wants to find a quiet place for his ears

538
00:32:03,392 --> 00:32:04,886
I planted this tree with my mother

539
00:32:04,886 --> 00:32:06,177
She died

540
00:32:06,177 --> 00:32:07,783
She cannot come back to life and help me grow it again

541
00:32:07,783 --> 00:32:09,020
How strange !!

542
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,962
Your surname is T and your first name is Wati too?

543
00:32:12,962 --> 00:32:14,932
Genophobia, the fear of women

544
00:32:15,452 --> 00:32:16,412
Hello

545
00:32:16,412 --> 00:32:18,052
I'm deaden
