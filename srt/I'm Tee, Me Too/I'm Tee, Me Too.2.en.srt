1
00:00:13,627 --> 00:00:15,627
We have a bunch of ‘Tees’ here.

2
00:00:15,628 --> 00:00:16,547
Rule No.1.

3
00:00:16,547 --> 00:00:18,547
You'll be fined 10,000 baht for turning on the stove after midnight.

4
00:00:18,827 --> 00:00:19,722
Rule No.2.

5
00:00:19,722 --> 00:00:21,722
Do not bring strangers into this house.

6
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:23,083
Does Tee live here?

7
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:25,649
It is the shittiest reason to get dumped ever.

8
00:00:25,682 --> 00:00:27,068
If you still can’t find the way out,

9
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,068
You will be the first to get out of this house.

10
00:00:38,644 --> 00:00:40,644
It should take another 16 days,

11
00:00:40,644 --> 00:00:42,939
according to the 21-day theory

12
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:46,231
that says if we keep doing the same thing

13
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,179
and face the same thing over and over for 21 days,

14
00:00:49,737 --> 00:00:51,737
we’ll get used to it and form a new habit.

15
00:01:01,384 --> 00:01:03,065
But when I come home,

16
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:05,311
which is supposed to be the most heartwarming and safest place,

17
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,107
I see a bunch of weird people.

18
00:01:08,107 --> 00:01:10,107
Unfamiliar faces, unfamiliar habits.

19
00:01:10,854 --> 00:01:12,854
Could these really become my new habits?

20
00:01:13,377 --> 00:01:15,991
Hey, Watee. You’re back.

21
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:17,566
Are you tired?

22
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:19,621
I’m fine.

23
00:01:20,626 --> 00:01:24,345
I said that because I knew he didn’t really want to know my answer.

24
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:25,740
Come eat with us.

25
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:28,593
I already ate.

26
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:43,392
Teedet

27
00:01:43,732 --> 00:01:45,216
why are you scared of women?

28
00:01:45,393 --> 00:01:46,067
Why?

29
00:01:47,414 --> 00:01:48,432
It’s none of your business.

30
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:52,420
Don’t worry. I learned in class that it can be cured.

31
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:53,761
Leave me alone.

32
00:01:53,884 --> 00:01:54,705
Look,

33
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:56,479
he’s worried about you.

34
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,346
And I’d rather not have to find a male fish for you next time I cook.

35
00:02:00,816 --> 00:02:01,858
What male fish?

36
00:02:02,154 --> 00:02:03,344
Carp. [Rhyme with Krub – Ending word for Thai males]

37
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,148
Carp.

38
00:02:05,784 --> 00:02:07,489
If the fish is female, it’s called Ka. [Ka – Ending word for Thai females]

39
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:09,144
The male is Carp.

40
00:02:09,144 --> 00:02:09,987
Right, Teedet?

41
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:12,014
Carp.

42
00:02:13,855 --> 00:02:16,051
It’s been a while since there’s been laughter in my house.

43
00:02:16,422 --> 00:02:19,208
Is it still my house though?

44
00:02:19,604 --> 00:02:20,401
Tell me.

45
00:02:20,456 --> 00:02:22,333
This is super interesting. Come on.

46
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:22,833
Answer me.

47
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:23,333
Hey!

48
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
I’m out. You’re annoying.

49
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:30,564
That’s right.

50
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:32,243
They’re annoying.

51
00:02:36,462 --> 00:02:37,160
So,

52
00:02:37,609 --> 00:02:38,897
what are you going to do with your dog?

53
00:02:39,763 --> 00:02:40,486
Dude.

54
00:02:41,864 --> 00:02:43,864
Let me set the record straight.

55
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,817
I didn’t buy it for that girl.

56
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:47,623
I just helped her pick it.

57
00:02:48,438 --> 00:02:50,315
How it ended up being our baby,

58
00:02:50,315 --> 00:02:50,938
I don’t understand.

59
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,880
It’s yours, otherwise she wouldn’t have returned it.

60
00:02:54,722 --> 00:02:56,182
She wanted revenge

61
00:02:56,335 --> 00:02:58,114
so she left it as a reminder.

62
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:00,185
I don’t believe you.

63
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:02,739
You’re a monster if you abandon that cute dog.

64
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:05,488
I’ve seen one too many couples

65
00:03:05,804 --> 00:03:08,614
in their honeymoon phase who bought a dog together,

66
00:03:08,619 --> 00:03:10,619
wanting to start a family.

67
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,620
Once they broke up, they abandoned their dog.

68
00:03:12,652 --> 00:03:14,652
They bought the dog together.

69
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,719
A cute one.

70
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,933
Wait.

71
00:03:17,387 --> 00:03:19,387
Where are you going? You haven’t told me what you’re going to do with that dog.

72
00:03:19,388 --> 00:03:21,044
If you want to talk to me, stop chewing.

73
00:03:21,044 --> 00:03:22,332
I have to eat. I’m hungry.

74
00:03:22,332 --> 00:03:23,127
I said stop chewing.

75
00:03:23,127 --> 00:03:24,223
Why?
Stop chewing!

76
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,147
You want some? Here you go.

77
00:03:25,147 --> 00:03:26,361
Will you stop chewing or not?

78
00:03:26,361 --> 00:03:27,502
Why do I have to stop?
I said stop!

79
00:03:27,502 --> 00:03:28,888
I’m hungry!

80
00:04:39,402 --> 00:04:40,714
What the fuck is wrong with you?

81
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:43,067
I told you to stop chewing. Why wouldn’t you?

82
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,662
Do you have a fucking problem with me?

83
00:04:46,413 --> 00:04:47,504
Shit!

84
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:01,774
What I’m feeling right now

85
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:03,574
is not annoyance.

86
00:05:06,135 --> 00:05:07,889
All of you, get out of my house.

87
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,134
Watee, calm down.

88
00:05:11,134 --> 00:05:12,495
I can’t fucking calm down!

89
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,617
I planted this tree with my mother.

90
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,281
She’s passed away.

91
00:05:17,427 --> 00:05:19,181
She can’t return to life and help me plant it again, can she?

92
00:05:20,442 --> 00:05:21,509
Answer me!

93
00:05:23,146 --> 00:05:24,630
Your mom is dead?

94
00:05:27,087 --> 00:05:28,055
I’m sorry.

95
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:29,716
I’m really sorry.

96
00:05:31,893 --> 00:05:34,335
I couldn’t stand his chewing sound. I’m sorry.

97
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:36,534
Am I supposed to understand you?

98
00:05:42,265 --> 00:05:43,307
Watee.

99
00:05:45,014 --> 00:05:47,014
Let me put this in the soil for you.

100
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,014
Your memory of your mother is not going anywhere.

101
00:05:50,014 --> 00:05:52,014
I think the tree will grow even better.

102
00:05:52,014 --> 00:05:54,014
Look. The roots are fine.

103
00:05:55,803 --> 00:05:56,796
Dude.

104
00:05:58,303 --> 00:05:59,394
Please calm down.

105
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,181
Think of the reasons why you wanted us to stay here.

106
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,051
I didn’t expect you guys to make a mess of my house.

107
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:16,821
You have tonight to pack up your things.

108
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:19,636
I want you all out of my sight by tomorrow morning.

109
00:06:19,636 --> 00:06:20,278
Please.

110
00:06:21,641 --> 00:06:23,543
Let us stay.

111
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,470
I don’t want them in trouble because of me.

112
00:06:27,737 --> 00:06:29,074
Please, I beg you.

113
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,308
I want that as my birthday gift.

114
00:06:37,707 --> 00:06:39,142
Today is your birthday?

115
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:44,516
Mm.

116
00:06:46,298 --> 00:06:48,298
My birthday this year is full of disaster.

117
00:06:49,503 --> 00:06:51,503
Give me one good thing.

118
00:06:53,123 --> 00:06:54,190
Birthday?

119
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:57,957
So what?

120
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,188
Watee, I know you’re angry

121
00:07:04,188 --> 00:07:05,462
but that was too harsh.

122
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:06,780
Fine.

123
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:12,803
Thank you so much for making this my shittiest birthday ever.

124
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,099
Guys, let’s go pack our things.

125
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:19,099
What are you waiting for?

126
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:19,599
Come on.

127
00:07:20,343 --> 00:07:21,827
I’m going to put this tree in the soil first.

128
00:07:28,007 --> 00:07:31,603
Happy Birthday to You.

129
00:07:34,197 --> 00:07:37,720
Happy Birthday to You.

130
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:43,686
Happy Birthday.

131
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:50,236
Happy Birthday.

132
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,893
I’m not singing.

133
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,292
You’ll get your present.

134
00:08:12,094 --> 00:08:14,094
but if you keep losing it at the sound of chewing

135
00:08:15,014 --> 00:08:16,572
and destroying my mother’s stuff

136
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,129
next time you won’t be able to ask for anything.

137
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,215
Happy Birthday to You.

138
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,852
I wasn’t prepared to hear that song today.

139
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:42,781
Happy Birthday to You.

140
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:44,544
Let me help.

141
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,883
Here.

142
00:08:48,538 --> 00:08:50,014
Let’s celebrate with this.

143
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:52,775
If we’d known, we would’ve prepared something you like.

144
00:08:53,862 --> 00:08:55,518
We already sang Happy Birthday.

145
00:08:55,518 --> 00:08:56,125
You can make a wish.

146
00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:03,248
Do I blow out the candle now?

147
00:09:03,469 --> 00:09:03,969
Go ahead.

148
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:10,843
Thank you so much guys.

149
00:09:11,495 --> 00:09:14,035
This is more than enough to make it a happy birthday.

150
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:17,510
I’ll go eat somewhere else.

151
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,135
Wait.

152
00:09:18,135 --> 00:09:18,635
Where are you going?

153
00:09:19,249 --> 00:09:20,831
Birthday boy should stay here.

154
00:09:20,831 --> 00:09:21,799
Where are you going?

155
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,842
He’s right.

156
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:24,054
Sit down and eat with us.

157
00:09:24,304 --> 00:09:25,014
Sit down.

158
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:28,056
Then I’ll wear my earphones.

159
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:29,098
Stop.

160
00:09:29,665 --> 00:09:32,107
We don’t chew that loudly.

161
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:38,132
Seriously?

162
00:09:40,203 --> 00:09:42,007
Is he happy?

163
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:44,313
What?

164
00:09:45,523 --> 00:09:46,909
I wish you lots of happiness.

165
00:09:47,523 --> 00:09:48,558
Thank you.

166
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:53,328
What a weirdo.

167
00:09:54,696 --> 00:09:55,443
Come again?

168
00:09:56,617 --> 00:09:58,101
It’s so damn delicious.

169
00:09:58,269 --> 00:09:59,606
Yeah.
It’s quite sweet.

170
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,429
Watee,

171
00:10:03,973 --> 00:10:05,040
come eat with us.

172
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,280
Why are you sitting so far away?

173
00:10:06,968 --> 00:10:08,477
You guys enjoy. I’m not eating it.

174
00:10:08,678 --> 00:10:09,524
Not eating again?

175
00:10:10,173 --> 00:10:11,338
Watee.

176
00:10:11,992 --> 00:10:13,746
Is there anything else that belonged to your mother?

177
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:14,911
I ask so I can be careful.

178
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:21,714
That plate.

179
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:24,019
Those forks.

180
00:10:25,431 --> 00:10:27,431
Actually, everything in the kitchen.

181
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:30,215
My mom loved the curtains.

182
00:10:32,643 --> 00:10:34,643
Everything in Maetee and T-Rex’s room was also hers.

183
00:10:39,684 --> 00:10:42,666
That room, is it?

184
00:10:48,285 --> 00:10:49,745
What are you doing?

185
00:10:49,745 --> 00:10:52,579
Please, I don’t want to sleep in a dead person’s room.

186
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:54,161
And I don’t want to be alone.

187
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:58,315
Watee, go back to sleep in your mother’s room.

188
00:10:58,315 --> 00:11:00,382
Sleeping on the sofa will cause you back pain.

189
00:11:00,382 --> 00:11:01,502
I’m worried about you.

190
00:11:02,387 --> 00:11:04,387
Who gives you permission?

191
00:11:04,637 --> 00:11:05,630
No!
Please!

192
00:11:06,302 --> 00:11:07,799
For my birthday.

193
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:10,540
Stop with the birthday excuse.

194
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,122
You only have one birthday.

195
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,396
I know, right?
You only have one birthday.

196
00:11:14,723 --> 00:11:16,551
Only the crazy fall for the birthday trick.

197
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:26,498
Birthday.

198
00:11:29,093 --> 00:11:30,283
So what?

199
00:11:32,782 --> 00:11:34,364
So what if it’s my birthday?

200
00:11:35,352 --> 00:11:37,352
A birthday without the person who gave birth to me

201
00:11:38,104 --> 00:11:40,104
can’t be a happy one.

202
00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:01,449
What a blue birthday this year!

203
00:12:02,131 --> 00:12:04,131
You’re not here stealing the cherries.

204
00:13:37,415 --> 00:13:38,261
Teedet.

205
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:40,014
Teedet, the shadow!

206
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:43,241
Your nickname is Tee and your first name is Watee too?

207
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,286
Who is she here for?

208
00:13:44,286 --> 00:13:45,697
I brought her here to help you.

209
00:14:12,707 --> 00:14:14,707
Around June.

210
00:14:16,248 --> 00:14:18,147
Wait.

211
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,845
So that means Ink started dating you right after she broke up with me?

212
00:14:24,901 --> 00:14:26,452
The timeline suggests so.

213
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:31,702
And... did she ever talk about me?

214
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:33,512
She did.

215
00:14:35,302 --> 00:14:38,501
She said her ex was a real nagger

216
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:41,328
who even nagged when the milk she rinsed into a glass become foamy.

217
00:14:41,932 --> 00:14:43,675
Well, that’s because it gives me gas.

218
00:14:44,746 --> 00:14:46,061
Hey.

219
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:47,380
She said good things about you, too.

220
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,289
Enough.

221
00:14:49,145 --> 00:14:50,161
Why?

222
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:53,527
You don’t want to know what good things she said about you?

223
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:55,190
Just be quiet.

224
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,851
As you wish.

225
00:15:01,657 --> 00:15:03,250
If I was really a good guy,

226
00:15:05,088 --> 00:15:07,088
she wouldn’t have broken up with me to date you.

227
00:15:07,678 --> 00:15:09,678
Besides,

228
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:12,490
I don’t want to hear any good things followed by the word ‘but’.

229
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:26,882
Who are you texting?

230
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,280
I asked, who are you texting?

231
00:15:30,882 --> 00:15:31,855
What?

232
00:15:32,422 --> 00:15:34,058
Are you jealous for your ex?

233
00:15:35,117 --> 00:15:37,759
I started talking to this girl after I broke up with Ink.

234
00:15:37,866 --> 00:15:39,181
You’re fast.

235
00:15:39,609 --> 00:15:40,750
Excuse me.

236
00:15:41,061 --> 00:15:42,740
Did you say fast or bad?

237
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:45,142
Fast.

238
00:15:45,664 --> 00:15:47,365
I have problems with my pronunciation.

239
00:15:48,396 --> 00:15:49,604
You got away with it this time.

240
00:15:53,882 --> 00:15:55,390
I’m not fast.

241
00:15:56,627 --> 00:15:58,263
One month is quite some time.

242
00:16:01,903 --> 00:16:02,940
By the way,

243
00:16:03,732 --> 00:16:05,350
since it’s your birthday,

244
00:16:07,469 --> 00:16:09,191
I wish you good luck with her.

245
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,157
Thank you.

246
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:17,041
Happy Birthday.

247
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,828
Wishing you lots of happiness, P’Tee.

248
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:22,251
Thanks, N’SoundLab.

249
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:40,917
Shorty! Shorty!

250
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:44,383
Teedet!

251
00:16:44,657 --> 00:16:46,592
Teedet, wake up!

252
00:16:46,592 --> 00:16:47,477
What’s going on?

253
00:16:47,477 --> 00:16:48,213
Dude.

254
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,176
The shadow! The shadow!

255
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,060
You feel solo? There are 3 people here.

256
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,560
Are you crazy?

257
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,788
Go to sleep.

258
00:16:55,528 --> 00:16:57,935
I didn’t say solo. I said shadow!

259
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,462
The shadow!

260
00:16:59,655 --> 00:17:00,726
Shit!

261
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
I probably didn’t get enough sleep last night.

262
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,622
1, 2, 3!

263
00:18:12,243 --> 00:18:14,243
I saw her teeth just now.

264
00:18:18,021 --> 00:18:20,235
There’s no ghost of my mother in this house.

265
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,750
That’s for the best.

266
00:18:24,568 --> 00:18:26,183
Listen.

267
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:30,214
Ghosts are not real.

268
00:18:31,456 --> 00:18:33,456
I’ve never seen my mother’s ghost.

269
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:37,133
I wish they were real.

270
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:39,360
I wish I could see my mother.

271
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,180
If you saw her, tell her I miss her.

272
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,355
I’d rather she not show up.

273
00:18:50,947 --> 00:18:52,583
Why don’t you use the serving spoon?

274
00:18:58,021 --> 00:18:59,272
Watee.

275
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,086
Come eat with us.

276
00:19:02,965 --> 00:19:03,895
I already ate.

277
00:19:05,971 --> 00:19:08,442
Can I have two of these eggs with tamarind sauce then?

278
00:19:08,442 --> 00:19:09,377
Wait.

279
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:12,103
Is your name Watee?

280
00:19:12,253 --> 00:19:14,056
My name is Vatee.

281
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:16,418
You’re lying.

282
00:19:17,778 --> 00:19:19,050
Are you serious?

283
00:19:20,644 --> 00:19:23,051
Damn.

284
00:19:23,241 --> 00:19:24,727
How weird!

285
00:19:24,836 --> 00:19:29,105
Your nickname is Tee and your first name is Watee too?

286
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:31,360
It gets weirder than that

287
00:19:31,744 --> 00:19:33,744
because I also have the same last name as him.

288
00:19:33,937 --> 00:19:35,750
I’m Vatee Ruangritiroj.

289
00:19:36,434 --> 00:19:37,899
You must be joking.

290
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:00,567
Is this really your name?

291
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:01,413
Mm.

292
00:20:03,739 --> 00:20:06,681
Are you his other identity from a parallel universe

293
00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:08,818
who wants to get your old body back?

294
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:13,807
That’s impossible.

295
00:20:13,807 --> 00:20:17,990
There can only be one Watee Reuangritthiroj.

296
00:20:18,242 --> 00:20:19,707
You’re talking nonsense.

297
00:20:19,922 --> 00:20:21,922
I knew I have the same name as him.

298
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:23,700
I found him on Facebook.

299
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,204
At first, I was planning to take a selfie with someone who shares my name

300
00:20:28,204 --> 00:20:30,611
but when I saw his post looking for tenants,

301
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,751
I decided to rent this place.

302
00:20:32,887 --> 00:20:34,887
Look what I found.

303
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:37,551
These guys are Maetee

304
00:20:37,551 --> 00:20:39,783
and they have the same last name as me.

305
00:20:40,088 --> 00:20:41,831
There are three of them.

306
00:20:41,832 --> 00:20:45,416
They’re from Ranong, Rayong, and Yala.

307
00:20:46,683 --> 00:20:48,683
Gynophobia, the fear of women.

308
00:20:50,154 --> 00:20:51,576
I’m not scared of women.

309
00:20:52,144 --> 00:20:53,438
I’m scared of beautiful women.

310
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,601
Wow, your fear is a double standard.

311
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,083
Venustraphobia.

312
00:21:01,902 --> 00:21:03,474
How about you go see a doctor?

313
00:21:03,689 --> 00:21:05,047
I already did

314
00:21:05,455 --> 00:21:09,082
but my doctor’s pretty so I stopped going.

315
00:21:09,382 --> 00:21:12,666
Teedet, you must face your problem.

316
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,580
Feel your fear little by little.

317
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,845
You’ll get used to it in no time.

318
00:21:28,647 --> 00:21:29,791
Here.

319
00:21:42,331 --> 00:21:45,123
What? You show symptoms just by watching a movie?

320
00:21:46,944 --> 00:21:48,944
This is not going to work.

321
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,459
We must find another way.

322
00:21:59,628 --> 00:22:01,500
Hey Teedet.

323
00:22:02,507 --> 00:22:03,779
Good luck.

324
00:22:04,147 --> 00:22:04,970
Hey.

325
00:22:06,962 --> 00:22:08,384
What do I need good luck for?

326
00:22:20,301 --> 00:22:21,081
T-Rex,

327
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,045
who did you bring?

328
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:26,223
A girl? I’ll tell Watee.

329
00:22:26,488 --> 00:22:27,996
Watee is okay with this one.

330
00:22:28,275 --> 00:22:31,302
Is she his girlfriend? Tell her he just left

331
00:22:31,302 --> 00:22:33,108
and get her to wait somewhere else.

332
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,497
She’s not here to see Watee.

333
00:22:36,183 --> 00:22:37,348
Then whom?

334
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,243
You.

335
00:22:40,186 --> 00:22:42,186
I brought her here to help you.

336
00:22:42,952 --> 00:22:44,053
Come.

337
00:22:44,053 --> 00:22:45,176
I didn’t ask you to.

338
00:22:45,176 --> 00:22:45,999
Come here quickly.

339
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:46,802
No!

340
00:22:46,802 --> 00:22:49,298
Come here, Teedet!

341
00:22:49,298 --> 00:22:50,635
This won’t take long.

342
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:51,504
Come here.

343
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,171
They say you need to fight fear with fear.

344
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:57,755
Let it win. I surrender.

345
00:22:57,755 --> 00:22:59,197
Come back here.

346
00:22:59,197 --> 00:23:01,593
I don’t want you to keep going like this.

347
00:23:01,593 --> 00:23:05,439
I promise you’re not going to throw up or faint.

348
00:23:05,867 --> 00:23:07,984
Come on. Open your hand.

349
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,291
Bend forward.

350
00:23:13,474 --> 00:23:14,575
Slowly stroke her.

351
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,169
Ooh!

352
00:23:27,777 --> 00:23:28,686
Sawasdee ka.

353
00:23:28,686 --> 00:23:30,263
I’m Maetinee.

354
00:23:30,263 --> 00:23:31,450
Why did you cry?

355
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,785
I felt a tingling sensation.

356
00:23:32,785 --> 00:23:33,822
Maetee!

357
00:23:33,822 --> 00:23:34,793
It’s Maetinee.

358
00:23:41,229 --> 00:23:42,565
Hold it in.

359
00:23:42,565 --> 00:23:43,602
Today you must overcome your fear.

360
00:23:43,602 --> 00:23:47,719
Hold the vomit in. Close your mouth with your hand.

361
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:49,971
I’m not scared of that girl.

362
00:23:50,486 --> 00:23:51,780
I’m disgusted.

363
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,700
How can you be disgusted when I’m this pretty?

364
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,518
Hmm?

365
00:23:55,836 --> 00:23:57,359
You two are pranking me.

366
00:23:58,244 --> 00:23:59,645
T-Rex, was this your idea?

367
00:23:59,645 --> 00:24:00,552
I wanted to help.

368
00:24:00,552 --> 00:24:01,266
Maetee?

369
00:24:01,266 --> 00:24:01,959
No!

370
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:03,673
Don’t!

371
00:24:08,968 --> 00:24:10,647
Give me another chance, Teedet.

372
00:24:10,647 --> 00:24:11,577
You’ll start by smelling.

373
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:12,312
Ready?

374
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:16,365
Dude!

375
00:24:16,365 --> 00:24:18,594
You look more scared of ghosts than I am.

376
00:24:45,983 --> 00:24:48,554
So the Maetinee plan didn’t work?

377
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:53,278
Not at all. He didn’t like Maetinee.

378
00:24:54,271 --> 00:24:55,524
Watee.

379
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:57,843
Are you off to school? It’s still early.

380
00:24:57,843 --> 00:24:59,843
Join us for breakfast. I made some porridge.

381
00:25:00,771 --> 00:25:02,244
No. I’m in a hurry.

382
00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:04,518
‘No’ again?

383
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,480
But you’re the only one who hasn’t tried my cooking.

384
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,085
You have to try it this evening.

385
00:25:14,654 --> 00:25:16,215
No, thanks. I’ll be back late.

386
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:22,575
I swear on my honor, I will never ask him to eat again.

387
00:25:26,266 --> 00:25:27,321
Teedet.

388
00:25:27,947 --> 00:25:30,562
I don’t think these guys were trying to prank you.

389
00:25:31,143 --> 00:25:32,726
They actually meant well.

390
00:25:32,726 --> 00:25:36,396
Are you saying I should thank them?

391
00:25:36,396 --> 00:25:37,572
Yes.

392
00:25:37,932 --> 00:25:40,305
Thanks a lot, but don’t do it again.

393
00:25:40,578 --> 00:25:43,457
In the future, we won’t. Today, we will.

394
00:25:44,314 --> 00:25:45,853
What are you talking about?

395
00:25:45,853 --> 00:25:47,567
Give me another chance.

396
00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:50,776
You don’t get another chance. Leave me alone.

397
00:25:50,776 --> 00:25:51,803
I won’t fall for your tricks.

398
00:25:51,803 --> 00:25:52,429
Teedet.

399
00:25:52,429 --> 00:25:53,718
Don’t touch me.

400
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,686
I won’t fall for your tricks.

401
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:55,654
Give your friends another chance.

402
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:56,970
I won’t be fooled again.

403
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,301
I want you to touch me, Teedet.

404
00:25:58,301 --> 00:25:59,037
No!

405
00:25:59,037 --> 00:26:00,098
Maetinee!

406
00:26:00,098 --> 00:26:02,098
I’m sorry.

407
00:26:05,086 --> 00:26:05,988
Can I take it off now?

408
00:26:05,988 --> 00:26:07,988
Not yet. Sit still.

409
00:26:09,196 --> 00:26:09,992
I don’t think it’s going to work.

410
00:26:09,992 --> 00:26:10,981
Me neither.

411
00:26:14,518 --> 00:26:15,815
I feel bad for him.

412
00:26:15,815 --> 00:26:16,958
Let’s end it.

413
00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:26,029
Hi.

414
00:26:28,248 --> 00:26:29,094
What’s that sound?

415
00:26:29,492 --> 00:26:30,758
A cuckoo.

416
00:26:30,758 --> 00:26:32,195
Cuckoo.

417
00:26:39,287 --> 00:26:40,198
Who’s sitting there?

418
00:26:41,691 --> 00:26:43,691
This is similar to yesterday when Maetee dressed as a woman

419
00:26:44,332 --> 00:26:46,332
But today you’ll start by smelling.

420
00:26:46,332 --> 00:26:46,972
Are you ready?

421
00:26:48,051 --> 00:26:49,080
Be ready.

422
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,766
Come on.

423
00:26:54,551 --> 00:26:56,551
What are you doing?

424
00:26:59,255 --> 00:26:59,893
Oh.

425
00:27:00,497 --> 00:27:01,201
What?

426
00:27:01,344 --> 00:27:02,114
It’s a girl.

427
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:04,038
You’re not scared of her?

428
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,439
He’s not showing any symptoms.

429
00:27:07,573 --> 00:27:11,238
Did my cure work?

430
00:27:11,503 --> 00:27:14,988
My dressing as Maetinee was a success.

431
00:27:14,988 --> 00:27:15,846
Is he really cured?

432
00:27:17,141 --> 00:27:17,911
No.

433
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,718
You’re not scared.

434
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:22,932
She’s not pretty.

435
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:24,906
What?

436
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:28,046
Not pretty?

437
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:30,751
Ouch!

438
00:27:31,003 --> 00:27:33,354
T-Rex, what kind of group therapy is this?

439
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,920
There’s no patient, only a foul-mouthed jerk.

440
00:27:37,191 --> 00:27:38,027
What the hell?

441
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,197
I’ll walk you out.

442
00:27:45,328 --> 00:27:46,845
Like I said, it wasn’t going to work.

443
00:27:46,955 --> 00:27:47,988
I said it.

444
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,040
I said it first.
I said it first.

445
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,540
Fine.

446
00:27:50,757 --> 00:27:52,252
You should have known better,

447
00:27:52,252 --> 00:27:52,796
Maetee.

448
00:27:54,029 --> 00:27:55,084
Patch him up.

449
00:28:36,588 --> 00:28:37,358
Hello?

450
00:28:40,747 --> 00:28:42,747
I’ve found a reference. I’ll send you.

451
00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:45,318
I have to go.

452
00:29:09,638 --> 00:29:10,606
Shorty.

453
00:29:10,893 --> 00:29:11,619
Hmm?

454
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,434
I think I forgot something.

455
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:15,124
Where?

456
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,802
In this house.

457
00:29:17,682 --> 00:29:18,518
Go get it.

458
00:29:23,244 --> 00:29:26,562
Guess where I forgot it.

459
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,718
Have you found it?

460
00:29:35,768 --> 00:29:36,626
Not yet.

461
00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:40,220
Maybe it’s not in this room.

462
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:09,684
Heat it for 3 minutes before you eat.

463
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:16,634
If I had waited until you were back to try my cooking, I would have had to skip dinner.

464
00:30:16,634 --> 00:30:17,695
I figured I should make that for you.

465
00:30:19,262 --> 00:30:19,988
Thanks.

466
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:24,136
How was your day? Are you tired? You’re back late.

467
00:30:25,447 --> 00:30:26,129
I’m fine.

468
00:30:26,561 --> 00:30:27,748
What are you talking about?

469
00:30:28,437 --> 00:30:29,163
Whoa

470
00:30:29,503 --> 00:30:30,910
what happened to your face?

471
00:30:31,889 --> 00:30:33,889
These guys brought someone...

472
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:34,861
What did you say?

473
00:30:35,246 --> 00:30:37,246
We were just playing too rough.

474
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:39,858
You were fighting in my house?

475
00:30:41,184 --> 00:30:43,184
We were just playing too rough. It’s nothing.

476
00:30:43,857 --> 00:30:45,506
Just being normal teenagers.

477
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,836
Be quiet.

478
00:30:50,211 --> 00:30:52,211
I don’t think they’re telling the truth.

479
00:30:53,883 --> 00:30:57,860
I guess it’s normal that I don’t trust strangers.

480
00:31:02,163 --> 00:31:03,558
Can you check the closet behind me?

481
00:31:04,245 --> 00:31:05,234
Check it yourself.

482
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:07,271
No, I’m scared.

483
00:31:09,736 --> 00:31:10,945
Why can’t you do it yourself?

484
00:31:15,794 --> 00:31:17,091
There’s nothing here.

485
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,717
I only see clothes and his mother’s photo.

486
00:31:25,045 --> 00:31:27,045
Dude, quiet down!

487
00:31:28,182 --> 00:31:30,182
If this was a horror movie, the ghost would be furious

488
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:34,327
that you disrespected and wrecked her home.

489
00:31:43,429 --> 00:31:44,550
What’s wrong?

490
00:31:45,897 --> 00:31:46,996
Why are you suddenly quiet?

491
00:31:48,337 --> 00:31:48,975
Nothing.

492
00:32:07,203 --> 00:32:10,653
You look more scared of ghosts than I am.

493
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:46,776
Even though it feels a little weird,

494
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:49,910
if no one breaks the rules,

495
00:32:50,785 --> 00:32:52,785
I’ll have to put up with them for another 6 months.

496
00:32:54,935 --> 00:32:56,935
Come to my house tomorrow.

497
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,316
Directed by Nuttapong Mongkolsawas

498
00:33:07,249 --> 00:33:12,610
For your birthday, I wish you deaf so you won’t hear your friends chewing ever again.

499
00:33:13,555 --> 00:33:14,237
Okay?

500
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,676
Thank you.

501
00:33:15,676 --> 00:33:18,718
You’ve been through some tough situations the entire year.

502
00:33:19,035 --> 00:33:20,932
Next year I wish you only good things.

503
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,598
Let’s celebrate today.

504
00:33:22,987 --> 00:33:23,718
Can we?

505
00:33:23,922 --> 00:33:26,010
Let’s ask our friend first.

506
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,266
Friend?

507
00:33:28,824 --> 00:33:29,638
You mean me?

508
00:33:29,913 --> 00:33:30,683
First attack.

509
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,481
I told you the rules.

510
00:33:33,798 --> 00:33:34,809
Second attack.

511
00:33:35,492 --> 00:33:38,459
You guys must keep your distance with me.

512
00:33:38,718 --> 00:33:39,883
Third attack.

513
00:33:40,721 --> 00:33:41,403
But

514
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:43,403
you guys can be as close as you want.

515
00:33:43,403 --> 00:33:44,013
I don’t care.

516
00:33:44,883 --> 00:33:45,741
Ouch!

517
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,510
My friend is a good cook. I want you to try his food.

518
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:51,005
I forgot to tell you that I don’t eat meat.

519
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:53,028
This is Watee, the house owner.

520
00:33:53,028 --> 00:33:55,028
I didn’t kick him out because he’s your father.

521
00:33:55,352 --> 00:34:00,054
I used to think that if I loved someone enough, love would help me overcome my fear.

522
00:34:00,069 --> 00:34:01,476
You don’t love me enough.
