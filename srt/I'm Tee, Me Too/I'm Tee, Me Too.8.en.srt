1
00:00:00,181 --> 00:00:02,000
I shouldn’t have come back for you.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,726
Pack up all your stuff.

3
00:00:05,364 --> 00:00:07,364
I think I can no longer live in the same house as you.

4
00:00:07,494 --> 00:00:10,780
You should know that I really want to be alone right now.

5
00:00:13,197 --> 00:00:15,097
Don’t be angry at Watee.

6
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:18,723
He must be feeling very bad as well.

7
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:20,960
Let’s go in and see.

8
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:25,411
What the hell?

9
00:00:25,782 --> 00:00:29,128
Guys, this is an emergency. Come to Watee’s house immediately!

10
00:00:29,282 --> 00:00:30,659
Are you calling more friends over?

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,675
Huh?

12
00:00:43,904 --> 00:00:45,040
Who are you?

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,544
How did you get in here?

14
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:48,847
Ask your friend who we are.

15
00:00:49,187 --> 00:00:52,131
And don’t forget to ask how much money he owes us.

16
00:00:52,507 --> 00:00:54,226
How much does my friend owe you?

17
00:00:54,226 --> 00:00:55,345
Tell me everything.

18
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:01,986
Kids like you guys can’t afford to pay us back.

19
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:06,262
I’ll transfer you every single baht tonight.

20
00:01:08,504 --> 00:01:12,794
If I don’t get the money back tonight, your friend will get it worse.

21
00:01:17,936 --> 00:01:19,440
He’s my brother.

22
00:01:20,157 --> 00:01:21,876
I won’t let that happen.

23
00:01:31,605 --> 00:01:32,540
Ouch!

24
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:41,864
Hey.

25
00:01:42,197 --> 00:01:43,253
What happened?

26
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:46,080
You’re so late.

27
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,671
We came as fast as we could.

28
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,080
What happened?

29
00:01:50,298 --> 00:01:52,298
Watee has borrowed money from a loan shark

30
00:01:52,481 --> 00:01:53,933
and hasn’t paid them back,

31
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:55,520
so they came after him here.

32
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,362
Shit.

33
00:01:56,777 --> 00:01:58,476
You’re lucky they didn’t kill you.

34
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,160
I know, right?

35
00:02:00,295 --> 00:02:01,933
Have you paid them back yet?

36
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,000
I told them I’d transfer them tonight.

37
00:02:06,665 --> 00:02:08,102
Actually, you guys...

38
00:02:08,102 --> 00:02:09,044
Shut up.

39
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,238
Do you even have a choice?

40
00:02:13,387 --> 00:02:17,765
Guys, have you spent the deposit we got back from Watee?

41
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:19,520
No.

42
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,362
I still have it.

43
00:02:21,268 --> 00:02:22,240
Good.

44
00:02:22,545 --> 00:02:24,545
Can you let Watee borrow that money?

45
00:02:26,612 --> 00:02:27,507
Mm.

46
00:02:29,873 --> 00:02:30,708
Mm.

47
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:37,317
Thanks a lot, guys

48
00:02:39,077 --> 00:02:41,077
I want something in return.

49
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,486
I reserve this spot.

50
00:02:49,486 --> 00:02:50,495
Maetee!

51
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:54,820
T-Rex!

52
00:02:58,277 --> 00:03:00,000
Don’t touch me!

53
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:15,408
Guys.

54
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:16,908
Food is ready to be served.

55
00:03:23,631 --> 00:03:25,169
Slow down.

56
00:03:25,422 --> 00:03:26,719
It’s yummy.

57
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,762
And I haven’t tried this new flavor before.

58
00:03:31,448 --> 00:03:36,301
Now I believe that these guys have really become my other family.

59
00:03:36,643 --> 00:03:37,949
Except...

60
00:03:38,413 --> 00:03:39,871
I see you only eat the noodles.

61
00:03:40,795 --> 00:03:42,554
Let Maetee have some of that.

62
00:03:43,297 --> 00:03:44,593
Hello, Mom.

63
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:46,720
What?

64
00:04:55,476 --> 00:04:57,476
Someone told me that

65
00:04:57,476 --> 00:04:59,607
you only see the value of something you have

66
00:04:59,607 --> 00:05:01,796
when you’re about to lose it.

67
00:05:01,796 --> 00:05:03,291
Please be okay.

68
00:05:04,296 --> 00:05:06,799
I haven’t had a chance to call you my dad.

69
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,946
You should leave.

70
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:13,156
The truth is, you knew what you had,

71
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:16,933
you just never thought you’d lose it.

72
00:05:17,237 --> 00:05:18,152
Mom.

73
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,091
How’s Dad?

74
00:05:19,216 --> 00:05:20,800
He’s still with the doctor.

75
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,615
Why did he suddenly fall?

76
00:05:25,086 --> 00:05:27,086
Doctor, how’s my Dad?

77
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:29,349
The patient has a heart disease.

78
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:30,968
Specifically, a coronary artery blockage.

79
00:05:30,968 --> 00:05:33,042
I need to operate on him immediately.

80
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,669
But the problem is.

81
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:36,734
What is it?

82
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,215
Our hospital is running low on blood supply.

83
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,608
I need blood from family members in case of an emergency.

84
00:05:44,805 --> 00:05:47,448
Does anyone have A blood type, the same as the patient’s?

85
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,168
O will also work.

86
00:05:50,287 --> 00:05:51,200
Mine is B.

87
00:05:53,697 --> 00:05:55,000
Mine is B as well.

88
00:05:57,201 --> 00:05:58,478
What should we do?

89
00:06:01,345 --> 00:06:02,381
Mine is A.

90
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:04,800
Are you family?

91
00:06:05,345 --> 00:06:06,361
I’m his son.

92
00:06:06,642 --> 00:06:07,680
You can take my blood.

93
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,416
Good.

94
00:06:08,717 --> 00:06:10,235
I’ll let the nurse lead the way.

95
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:45,757
Thank you so much.

96
00:06:48,188 --> 00:06:49,003
For what?

97
00:06:51,132 --> 00:06:52,750
For giving your blood to my dad.

98
00:06:57,411 --> 00:06:58,487
No problem.

99
00:07:00,355 --> 00:07:04,705
The doctors don’t usually have to use blood donated by family.

100
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:10,033
But this has shown that

101
00:07:10,194 --> 00:07:13,285
you were willing to do everything to make him live.

102
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:18,192
Considering how much you don’t like him,

103
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:22,220
why did you help him?

104
00:07:26,188 --> 00:07:29,132
What happened reminded me of my mom.

105
00:07:30,737 --> 00:07:32,375
The doctor said the same thing.

106
00:07:33,942 --> 00:07:35,942
But in the end, I couldn’t save her.

107
00:07:38,372 --> 00:07:40,372
That’s why I wanted to help with something now.

108
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:42,945
Besides,

109
00:07:44,752 --> 00:07:46,149
he’s not just your dad,

110
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,653
he’s my dad too.

111
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:55,325
You call him dad.

112
00:07:57,957 --> 00:07:59,656
I’m happy for him.

113
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,499
I want him to wake up and hear it.

114
00:08:06,376 --> 00:08:07,492
Me too.

115
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:15,260
Some people say time is the best healer for human feelings.

116
00:08:16,357 --> 00:08:23,620
But I think it’s actually facing the truth that can best heal our feelings.

117
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:04,794
Have you ever been angry at my mom?

118
00:09:05,477 --> 00:09:08,502
This might be your last month here.

119
00:09:09,385 --> 00:09:10,260
What?

120
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,640
But tomorrow is the end of month.

121
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,399
Tee.

122
00:09:53,122 --> 00:09:54,136
Watee.

123
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:56,935
I’m sorry.

124
00:09:56,935 --> 00:09:58,786
Dad, can you hear me?

125
00:09:59,368 --> 00:10:00,051
Dad.

126
00:10:01,256 --> 00:10:02,103
Dad.

127
00:10:05,963 --> 00:10:06,776
Tee.

128
00:10:10,765 --> 00:10:11,936
I’m sorry.

129
00:10:12,974 --> 00:10:14,974
There’s no need to apologize.

130
00:10:21,605 --> 00:10:22,843
Ouch!

131
00:10:23,134 --> 00:10:24,275
Don’t move.

132
00:10:27,187 --> 00:10:28,385
I have wounds.

133
00:10:30,311 --> 00:10:31,773
You just got out of operation.

134
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,544
Operation?

135
00:10:38,327 --> 00:10:40,327
The doctor said you have a heart disease.

136
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:43,249
But the operation went well.

137
00:10:44,697 --> 00:10:47,862
From now on, you must take care of yourself.

138
00:10:48,086 --> 00:10:49,192
Don’t eat spicy food

139
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:51,237
and don’t stress too much.

140
00:10:56,642 --> 00:10:57,387
Tee.

141
00:11:01,255 --> 00:11:02,215
Forgive me.

142
00:11:02,215 --> 00:11:02,858
Dad.

143
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:04,509
I told you not to stress yourself out.

144
00:11:09,954 --> 00:11:11,954
I don’t want you to be in the hospital again.

145
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,920
How about I come visit you at your house?

146
00:11:18,535 --> 00:11:20,535
Or whenever you’re in Bangkok,

147
00:11:21,818 --> 00:11:23,258
you can stay at my house.

148
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:28,543
It’s also your house anyway.

149
00:11:31,165 --> 00:11:33,165
I think mom would want to see you.

150
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:34,946
Okay?

151
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:49,845
All this time,

152
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:56,906
your mother has been both your father and mother.

153
00:11:59,122 --> 00:12:01,122
Now that she’s gone,

154
00:12:03,154 --> 00:12:06,790
can I be both your father and mother?

155
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,173
This is my father’s day card for you.

156
00:12:27,475 --> 00:12:28,695
Is it too late to give it to you?

157
00:12:34,745 --> 00:12:36,409
Why is my hair long?

158
00:12:37,328 --> 00:12:38,349
Mom drew it.

159
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:51,015
Is this your handwriting?

160
00:12:53,995 --> 00:12:55,162
Thank you, son.

161
00:12:58,224 --> 00:13:01,575
If you still have that something of yours,

162
00:13:01,575 --> 00:13:03,874
please take the best care of it.

163
00:13:03,874 --> 00:13:06,065
Because you never know

164
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:10,217
when you have to say goodbye.

165
00:13:24,068 --> 00:13:24,925
Hey.

166
00:13:27,165 --> 00:13:28,230
What’s up?

167
00:13:28,456 --> 00:13:30,456
Dad’s going home in a few days.

168
00:13:32,418 --> 00:13:33,269
Mm.

169
00:13:33,695 --> 00:13:34,580
Good.

170
00:13:35,043 --> 00:13:37,043
Is he going straight back to Ratchaburi?

171
00:13:37,043 --> 00:13:39,795
We can have him stay here if he needs someone to assist him.

172
00:13:39,997 --> 00:13:44,070
It’s okay. My mom is a former nurse. She can take care of him.

173
00:13:45,213 --> 00:13:46,160
Good.

174
00:13:54,148 --> 00:13:55,790
Have you ever been angry at my mom?

175
00:14:01,415 --> 00:14:03,034
Your mom did nothing wrong.

176
00:14:03,695 --> 00:14:04,980
She’s someone my dad loves.

177
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,721
More importantly,

178
00:14:11,746 --> 00:14:13,276
she’s my friend’s mom.

179
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,270
Hold on.

180
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,321
I’m your brother,

181
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:18,408
not your friend.

182
00:14:19,404 --> 00:14:23,174
Friend or brother, you’re T-Rex,

183
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,058
the troublemaker of this house.

184
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:29,840
Behave yourself, okay?

185
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:31,510
Vatee Ruangritiroj.

186
00:14:33,185 --> 00:14:35,185
Was that meant for me or you?

187
00:14:37,134 --> 00:14:38,390
Both of us.

188
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:50,637
Now it looks like Watee Reuangritthiroj is not only a friend who shares my name,

189
00:14:50,637 --> 00:14:54,973
but we also have an unbreakable bond.

190
00:14:54,973 --> 00:14:56,071
Guys.

191
00:14:56,936 --> 00:14:58,055
Are you watering those plants?

192
00:14:58,055 --> 00:14:59,015
You want some water?

193
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:01,808
I have a shield.

194
00:15:01,808 --> 00:15:03,315
I need your help.

195
00:15:03,315 --> 00:15:04,143
What?

196
00:15:05,987 --> 00:15:12,804
I think our lives are like touching classic teen movies.

197
00:15:12,804 --> 00:15:13,696
This again.

198
00:15:13,957 --> 00:15:19,385
So I used my communication arts skills to write a play.

199
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,059
Listen carefully.

200
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:22,646
The plot is

201
00:15:22,646 --> 00:15:30,063
6 boys of passionate age plant a tree together to represent their great friendship.

202
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,810
That tree is “Cha”

203
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,448
Its English name is pronounced the same as our names.

204
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:36,599
Tea.

205
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:38,987
They hope that this tree

206
00:15:38,987 --> 00:15:41,141
grows flowers and leaves,

207
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:42,660
just like our love

208
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,048
which doesn’t fade.

209
00:15:44,048 --> 00:15:45,833
Whoa.

210
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,408
You’re so good at this thing.

211
00:15:47,408 --> 00:15:50,040
Hey.
I wrote Akaradej Netprasit.

212
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:56,697

213

♪  I’d gladly give myself to you. ♪

214
00:16:04,551 --> 00:16:06,865
His fear of trusting others

215
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,424
is unlikely to get better.

216
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:16,185
But I think he has stopped seeing us as someone else.

217
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:22,971

221
00:16:42,492 --> 00:16:45,545
This is our first group photo of the 6 of us.

222
00:16:45,545 --> 00:16:50,045
I think we need to take several more.

223
00:16:50,224 --> 00:16:51,690
As for the others,

224
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,706
Closing the door while he poops

225
00:16:54,706 --> 00:16:59,180
is the beginning of Maetee’s journey to overcoming fear.

226
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,037
As for Tee-do,

227
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:07,293
Popcorn level 3, you pass!

228
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,465
Are you done?

229
00:17:08,966 --> 00:17:10,137
Okay. Pass.

230
00:17:10,137 --> 00:17:13,052
Now that he has someone to overcome his fear with,

231
00:17:13,052 --> 00:17:16,034
he gradually continues on his journey.

232
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,232
I’m going to sing you a song.

233
00:17:18,232 --> 00:17:19,666
As for Teedet,

234
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,056
ever since he found someone who stole his heart,

235
00:17:22,056 --> 00:17:27,035
the phrase “pretty girls” is no longer in his dictionary.

236
00:17:27,221 --> 00:17:32,940
He loves her whether she’s pretty or not.

237
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,419
As for Maitee.

238
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:36,411
How is she?

239
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:41,206
The operation went well.

240
00:17:43,335 --> 00:17:44,308
But.

241
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,618
But what?

242
00:17:47,707 --> 00:17:52,135
But she just needs a lot of rest and physical therapy to get better quickly.

243
00:17:55,566 --> 00:17:56,775
Thank you, Doctor.

244
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:58,727
Congratulations.

245
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,673
He finally received some good news.

246
00:18:07,096 --> 00:18:09,992
That’s it. No more buts.

247
00:18:15,346 --> 00:18:17,346
T-Rex, come back to your station.

248
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,376
Don’t go out.

249
00:18:18,376 --> 00:18:19,965
The tower has been destroyed. Quickly.

250
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,280
What?

251
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,469
We lost.

252
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:25,210
It’s because of your incompetence.

253
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,320
Let’s do another match.

254
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,443
No. I’m tired.

255
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:28,827
Guys.

256
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,571
I have something to tell you.

257
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:39,126
Uh...

258
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:42,959
I’m free of house debt.

259
00:18:49,376 --> 00:18:51,130
My dad paid off all of it.

260
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:54,454
Then you don’t have to find work anymore.

261
00:18:56,739 --> 00:18:57,668
Mm.

262
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:01,579
I want to tell you guys that

263
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:04,094
I don’t need your money anymore.

264
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,815
Hey. We don’t want to stay for free.

265
00:19:07,943 --> 00:19:12,135
Our rents could cover the electricity and water bills.

266
00:19:12,135 --> 00:19:12,927
Yeah.

267
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:17,466
Uh...

268
00:19:19,397 --> 00:19:20,904
My dad is moving in with me.

269
00:19:24,115 --> 00:19:26,115
Why didn’t I know this before?

270
00:19:27,758 --> 00:19:31,175
I just talked to Dad after paying off the house debt.

271
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:33,549
I planned to tell you later.

272
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,803
So guys,

273
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,357
this might be your last month here.

274
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,375
Isn’t this too sudden?

275
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:45,524
What?

276
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,180
But tomorrow is the end of month.

277
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,424
Mm.

278
00:19:54,203 --> 00:19:56,203
This is difficult for me too

279
00:19:56,203 --> 00:20:00,418
but my dad said he wanted to spend most of the time he has left with me

280
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,178
before he gets any worse.

281
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:05,575
You guys understand me, right?

282
00:20:06,768 --> 00:20:09,440
I’d do the same thing for my mom.

283
00:20:10,695 --> 00:20:11,805
I’m sorry.

284
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:14,856
I just want to be a good son.

285
00:20:15,405 --> 00:20:16,733
We’re sorry.

286
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,695
No worries at all.

287
00:20:18,695 --> 00:20:19,872
We understand.

288
00:20:19,872 --> 00:20:21,725
We understand.

289
00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:23,475
So this means

290
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:25,701
this is our last night here, right?

291
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,218
Mm.

292
00:20:29,737 --> 00:20:31,379
I need to pack again?

293
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,934
Let’s throw a party tomorrow.

294
00:20:37,934 --> 00:20:39,164
Why not?

295
00:20:39,993 --> 00:20:41,415
Let’s throw a party for the last time.

296
00:20:41,415 --> 00:20:42,805
I feel bad

297
00:20:43,015 --> 00:20:45,313
that I never got to make good memories with you guys.

298
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,260
Can you move your face?

299
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,245
Guys, look at the stars up there.

300
00:21:33,245 --> 00:21:34,824
They form a T shape.

301
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:36,787
Where’s T?

302
00:21:36,924 --> 00:21:39,224
There. T-Yai. (Capital T)

303
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:42,915
Where’s T-Yai? I only see T-Lek. (Small T)

304
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,132
There’s no T-Lek up there. T-Rex is here.

305
00:21:48,705 --> 00:21:49,920
Cute.

306
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:57,378
I never thought our last day would come so soon.

307
00:22:00,825 --> 00:22:04,899
We’ve been through a lot in this house.

308
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:05,805
True.

309
00:22:06,005 --> 00:22:06,805
True.

310
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:11,509
But there have also been some shitty rules in this house.

311
00:22:11,784 --> 00:22:12,983
True.

312
00:22:13,383 --> 00:22:14,523
Are you insulting me?

313
00:22:14,623 --> 00:22:16,783
Hey, I’m just kidding.

314
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,441
But

315
00:22:21,727 --> 00:22:23,927
all good things must come to an end, right?

316
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:30,426
Let’s throw a party tomorrow.

317
00:22:30,586 --> 00:22:31,337
Huh?

318
00:22:31,575 --> 00:22:33,200
You’re in a mood for parties?

319
00:22:33,201 --> 00:22:34,901
Why not?

320
00:22:35,613 --> 00:22:37,163
Let’s throw a party for the last time.

321
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:45,149
Hearing ‘last time’ makes me sad.

322
00:22:45,772 --> 00:22:49,845
If you miss us, turn on the song.

323
00:22:51,082 --> 00:22:52,233
What song?

324
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:59,666
♫ Miss you every time I’m alone ♫

325
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:00,985
Music!

326
00:23:00,985 --> 00:23:05,420
♫  Ever since you’ve been gone, ♫

327
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:10,538
♫  my life seemed to have changed ♫

328
00:23:10,838 --> 00:23:11,962
What is this?

329
00:23:15,484 --> 00:23:16,510
Look,

330
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:18,073
honestly,

331
00:23:18,334 --> 00:23:21,509
living together is great.

332
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,321
Mm.

333
00:23:24,782 --> 00:23:30,372
I’m sad to think that I won’t get to laugh with you guys anymore.

334
00:23:30,372 --> 00:23:33,396
I’m so happy to be with all of you.

335
00:23:34,304 --> 00:23:36,104
Hey, don’t cry.

336
00:23:36,104 --> 00:23:37,026
Wipe your tears.

337
00:23:37,026 --> 00:23:38,023
Don’t comfort me.

338
00:23:38,821 --> 00:23:39,554
Are you really crying?

339
00:23:39,554 --> 00:23:40,630
Don’t cry.

340
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:43,009
Don’t comfort me.

341
00:23:49,245 --> 00:23:50,870
What’s wrong with you?

342
00:23:54,455 --> 00:23:56,455
I love this.

343
00:23:57,927 --> 00:23:59,927
I think I’ll never see this again.

344
00:24:01,768 --> 00:24:03,068
I’m sad.

345
00:24:06,193 --> 00:24:09,192
The six of us living together is such a good thing.

346
00:24:09,342 --> 00:24:13,223
Hey, don’t be this sad.

347
00:24:16,308 --> 00:24:20,457
Finally, it’s our last day of us Tees.

348
00:24:22,644 --> 00:24:23,870
Hey, Watee.

349
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:26,331
Come sign the friendship board.

350
00:24:27,393 --> 00:24:29,393
This is like when I was in school.

351
00:24:29,393 --> 00:24:30,384
Hey.

352
00:24:31,058 --> 00:24:33,058
It’s for our farewell party.

353
00:24:33,383 --> 00:24:34,531
Oh.

354
00:24:35,206 --> 00:24:36,207
Sign it.

355
00:24:40,247 --> 00:24:41,273
What do I write about?

356
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:47,257
Your feelings. What you want to tell us.

357
00:24:47,257 --> 00:24:48,352
Go ahead.

358
00:25:01,831 --> 00:25:02,807
Done.

359
00:25:05,293 --> 00:25:06,394
Oh.

360
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,730
Less is more.

361
00:25:09,735 --> 00:25:11,635
“Thank you.”

362
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,356
Look.

363
00:25:12,356 --> 00:25:16,510
We’ve been thinking all night about how to throw this party.

364
00:25:16,692 --> 00:25:20,516
“The party of things Watee missed out on.”

365
00:25:20,915 --> 00:25:24,914
We think that we’ve had enough fun at this place,

366
00:25:24,914 --> 00:25:26,951
but you’ve never got to enjoy any of it with us.

367
00:25:27,994 --> 00:25:33,492
That’s why we’re going to recreate all the things you missed in this one party.

368
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:34,991
Our beloved friend, Watee.

369
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:36,216
Hold on.

370
00:25:36,216 --> 00:25:37,581
This is my house.

371
00:25:37,581 --> 00:25:38,695
Did I miss out on that much?

372
00:25:38,695 --> 00:25:40,490
Oh.

373
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,829
You’ll see.

374
00:25:43,596 --> 00:25:45,121
“The party of things Watee missed out on.”

375
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,860
Is it good?

376
00:26:03,045 --> 00:26:04,196
Is it good?

377
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,480
You two are just as bad.

378
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:19,723
Okay, everyone.

379
00:26:19,723 --> 00:26:22,223
It’s time for the highlight.

380
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:26,509
We’re going to confess what we’ve done to the house

381
00:26:26,509 --> 00:26:29,144
but don’t fine us, okay?

382
00:26:29,144 --> 00:26:29,927
I’m going to note them down.

383
00:26:29,927 --> 00:26:30,915
Ah.

384
00:26:30,915 --> 00:26:31,509
No.

385
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:32,096
Fine.

386
00:26:32,096 --> 00:26:33,364
Let’s pick who’ll go first.

387
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,400
I’ll let you pick.

388
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,750
I pick you, Maetee.

389
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,622
I’ll go first.

390
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,182
My best moment was

391
00:26:42,182 --> 00:26:47,618
when I dressed up as a girl named Maetinee to prank you.

392
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:51,666
Smell her.

393
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:54,370
Oh!

394
00:26:57,242 --> 00:26:59,492
Hi. I’m Maetinee.

395
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,456
Maetee.

396
00:27:00,456 --> 00:27:01,906
It’s Maetinee.

397
00:27:01,906 --> 00:27:03,406
How’s my thigh?

398
00:27:03,406 --> 00:27:07,341
Did caressing it make you feel something?

399
00:27:07,341 --> 00:27:08,976
I want to kick you right now.

400
00:27:08,976 --> 00:27:10,819
Thank god I wasn’t there that day.

401
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:13,297
Let’s hear from the next one.

402
00:27:14,209 --> 00:27:15,410
Someone’s avoiding your eyes.

403
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,346
Subtle.

404
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:22,332
It’s your turn.

405
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:27,831
Mine was when you helped me overcome my fear of chewing noise.

406
00:27:27,831 --> 00:27:30,444
And when you made some stupid sound when I was having dinner with SoundLab here.

407
00:27:34,573 --> 00:27:35,873
Hold on.

408
00:27:35,873 --> 00:27:38,701
You brought a girl in this house for a date?

409
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,533
Don’t fine me. It was some time ago.

410
00:27:42,441 --> 00:27:43,542
Okay.

411
00:27:43,542 --> 00:27:44,252
You’re done?

412
00:27:44,252 --> 00:27:44,800
Yes.

413
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,823
Next.

414
00:27:48,826 --> 00:27:49,452
Hey.

415
00:27:50,163 --> 00:27:51,164
Who are you looking at?

416
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:52,996
It’s your turn.

417
00:27:52,996 --> 00:27:53,618
Me?

418
00:27:53,618 --> 00:27:54,274
Yes.

419
00:27:54,274 --> 00:27:55,040
It’s your turn.

420
00:27:55,617 --> 00:28:01,065
I got slapped by a girl for the first time in my life here.

421
00:28:03,062 --> 00:28:04,337
You’re not scared of her?

422
00:28:04,337 --> 00:28:04,942
No.

423
00:28:04,942 --> 00:28:06,820
You’re not scared.

424
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,185
She’s not pretty.

425
00:28:11,347 --> 00:28:12,398
I’m sorry.

426
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:13,233
It’s okay.

427
00:28:13,634 --> 00:28:18,307
I got my first girlfriend by living in this house.

428
00:28:18,307 --> 00:28:19,657
Woo.

429
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:20,832
I’m going to fine you first.

430
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:23,577
Easy. I’m your friend.

431
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:26,828
It’s your turn, Bullfrog.

432
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:30,274
You should already know

433
00:28:30,274 --> 00:28:31,869
that my best moment

434
00:28:31,869 --> 00:28:34,841
was when I got my beloved friend back.

435
00:28:35,516 --> 00:28:36,578
What?

436
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,080
Are you Bullfrog?

437
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,359
Why didn’t you tell me that you’re Bullfrog?

438
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:46,998
But I’m so sad I have to part with him again.

439
00:28:49,052 --> 00:28:51,052
Don’t cry.

440
00:28:58,753 --> 00:29:01,509
Come on, guys. Don’t be sad. I understand.

441
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:05,442
It’s you and me left, T-Rex. What do you say?

442
00:29:08,377 --> 00:29:09,852
I can’t pick one memory.

443
00:29:11,014 --> 00:29:13,014
I love every moment I had with you guys.

444
00:29:16,702 --> 00:29:18,227
I feel bad

445
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,039
that I never got to make good memories with you guys.

446
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:29,167
But my best moment

447
00:29:30,175 --> 00:29:32,175
is when we’re sitting here together now

448
00:29:32,175 --> 00:29:37,148
and your faces are pale because I lied about you having to move out.

449
00:29:37,148 --> 00:29:38,452
Yay!

450
00:29:42,729 --> 00:29:43,730
Yay.

451
00:29:50,225 --> 00:29:51,675
Are you not shocked at all?

452
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,694
Was my acting good?

453
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,335
Good job, friend.

454
00:29:56,335 --> 00:29:59,021
Bravo!

455
00:29:59,021 --> 00:30:02,712
You thought we’re as white as a sheet? You’re so amateur.

456
00:30:05,107 --> 00:30:06,357
Now I’m annoyed.

457
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:08,698
So you guys knew all along.

458
00:30:08,698 --> 00:30:09,577
Yeah.

459
00:30:09,802 --> 00:30:11,837
You enjoyed this so much, right?

460
00:30:11,962 --> 00:30:15,254
Actually, my dad is not moving in here.

461
00:30:15,751 --> 00:30:16,802
Huh?

462
00:30:17,526 --> 00:30:19,526
Watee just wanted to prank you guys.

463
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,426
Why didn’t you stop him?

464
00:30:23,144 --> 00:30:26,693
I thought a party would be fun.

465
00:30:27,266 --> 00:30:28,816
Party?

466
00:30:28,816 --> 00:30:30,566
There’s a million kind of parties.

467
00:30:30,566 --> 00:30:32,066
Dog giving birth party.

468
00:30:32,066 --> 00:30:33,644
Hungry cat party.

469
00:30:33,644 --> 00:30:35,627
But not this kind of party.

470
00:30:38,357 --> 00:30:40,882
Fine, our beloved friend Watee.

471
00:30:42,403 --> 00:30:44,403
Tomorrow, you’re dead.

472
00:30:45,129 --> 00:30:46,509
Guys.

473
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,509
What’s the plan?

474
00:30:51,509 --> 00:30:54,452
Every tear I shed won’t go to waste.

475
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:55,608
Right.

476
00:30:55,608 --> 00:30:57,824
Everyone, string him up on the door.

477
00:30:57,824 --> 00:30:59,824
Go.

478
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:01,492
Come on!

479
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:02,715
You want to see Maetinee?

480
00:31:03,564 --> 00:31:04,591
Don’t!

481
00:31:07,364 --> 00:31:09,393
Here I come.

482
00:31:09,393 --> 00:31:10,398
Be careful!

483
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:11,798
I don’t want to see Maetinee!

484
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:13,390
I’m scared!

485
00:31:16,162 --> 00:31:17,388
No!

486
00:31:17,513 --> 00:31:18,673
Who’s there?

487
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,126
Excuse me.

488
00:31:23,126 --> 00:31:24,949
Do you still have rooms available?

489
00:31:28,224 --> 00:31:30,024
What’s your name?

490
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,310
I’m T-Bone.

491
00:31:32,822 --> 00:31:34,347
You can call me Tee.

492
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:35,984
Tee?

493
00:31:39,619 --> 00:31:40,695
Look.

494
00:31:41,706 --> 00:31:43,106
Our house is fully occupied.

495
00:31:43,493 --> 00:31:45,493
And it will be forever.

496
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:52,634
I think that’s not straight.

497
00:31:52,634 --> 00:31:53,745
This is not good?

498
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:57,002
Move it to the left so it aligns with the ceiling above.

499
00:31:57,002 --> 00:32:01,304
Now I know I’m not scared of being alone.

500
00:32:02,247 --> 00:32:05,946
I just like it when I’m with them.

501
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:19,303
Directed by Nuttapong Mongkolsawas

502
00:32:19,303 --> 00:32:20,845
Akradej Netprasit.

503
00:32:20,845 --> 00:32:23,080
Why didn’t you tell me you’re a ghost?

504
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,861
Hmm.

505
00:32:24,595 --> 00:32:27,320
Your blood must be so sweet.

506
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,052
Sopee Raweepannarai.

507
00:32:29,302 --> 00:32:32,105
Hahaha.

508
00:32:32,553 --> 00:32:34,253
I’m going to suck your blood.

509
00:32:34,253 --> 00:32:37,801
Hahaha.

510
00:32:37,801 --> 00:32:39,801
I’m going to sing you a song.

511
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:42,169
♫ You’re beautiful ♫

512
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:45,604
♫ Every moment I touch you ♫

513
00:32:45,604 --> 00:32:48,447
♫ You’re not beautiful ♫

514
00:32:52,861 --> 00:32:55,910
This is Chonlatee, my younger brother next door I told you about.

515
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,990
Tell me. Do you like Ton?

516
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,985
Okay! Okay! I like P’Ton!

517
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,211
THE PLAN TO TEST HIS FEELINGS HAS BEGUN!

518
00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:04,114
Ton, if you have feelings for him, just tell us.

519
00:33:04,114 --> 00:33:06,314
No way. Chon is like my little brother.

520
00:33:06,314 --> 00:33:07,959
MAKE HIM JEALOUS!

521
00:33:08,284 --> 00:33:09,915
What? You guys want me to pretend to hit on Chon

522
00:33:09,915 --> 00:33:11,076
to make P’Ton jealous?

523
00:33:12,165 --> 00:33:13,565
PROVOKE HIS JEALOUSY!

524
00:33:13,565 --> 00:33:14,987
Wipe him clean.

525
00:33:14,987 --> 00:33:16,741
Let me see.

526
00:33:16,741 --> 00:33:17,957
I’ll clean you up.

527
00:33:17,957 --> 00:33:19,062
I’m gonna beat you to death!

528
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:23,375
Your cheeks are soft like a girl.

529
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:26,508
If you were a girl, I’d kiss your cheek right now.

530
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:37,113
I can sleep naked if you want.

531
00:33:37,113 --> 00:33:38,933
No, don’t!

532
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:41,301
My heart is not going anywhere.

533
00:33:41,301 --> 00:33:43,591
It will stay with an ocean named Chonlatee forever.

534
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:48,483
