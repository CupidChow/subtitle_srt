1
00:00:00,189 --> 00:00:01,739
Do you remember me now?

2
00:00:01,739 --> 00:00:02,894
Are you Bullfrog?

3
00:00:03,173 --> 00:00:05,455
When I told your mom we’ll go to the beach once she recovers,

4
00:00:06,477 --> 00:00:07,238
I meant it.

5
00:00:08,353 --> 00:00:09,433
Is this really your name?

6
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:10,501
Mm.

7
00:00:11,977 --> 00:00:13,440
Can you check the closet behind me?

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,208
You look more scared of ghosts than I am.

9
00:00:18,027 --> 00:00:20,440
Dad, this is Watee. He's the owner of this house.

10
00:00:21,085 --> 00:00:24,053
I didn't kick him out because he's your father.

11
00:00:24,712 --> 00:00:25,567
I’m sorry.

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,760
I won't bring my father here again.

13
00:00:28,113 --> 00:00:30,113
I found it.
I didn’t bring my father.

14
00:00:34,382 --> 00:00:35,143
What are you talking about?

15
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,485
I brought your father.

16
00:00:46,808 --> 00:00:47,832
Mom,

17
00:00:48,188 --> 00:00:49,456
where’s Dad?

18
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:04,196
Can I be both your father and mother?

19
00:01:20,254 --> 00:01:22,254
Did you think that our sharing the same name

20
00:01:23,432 --> 00:01:24,494
was a coincidence?

21
00:01:30,534 --> 00:01:31,915
He goes to the same university as me.

22
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:35,000
Watee is a very common name.

23
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,960
It’s not unusual to find someone who shares your name.

24
00:01:37,817 --> 00:01:39,611
But he also has the same last name.

25
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:43,912
Down to the letters. Watee Reuangritthiroj.

26
00:01:46,842 --> 00:01:48,054
Is Dad’s last name very common?

27
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:53,208
I’ve never seen anyone sharing the same last name as your father.

28
00:01:56,944 --> 00:01:58,587
Is he related to us?

29
00:01:59,105 --> 00:02:00,148
I don’t know.

30
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:05,204
He could be our relative.
But if he was

31
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,584
why does he have the same name as me?

32
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:13,517
Your father actually came up with this name.

33
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:16,690
He said since his name was Watin,

34
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,971
if he had a son, he would name him Watee.

35
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:23,644
Maybe that Watee is Dad’s other son.

36
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,090
Don’t be crazy.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,230
Is this really your name?

38
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,410
Mm.

39
00:02:36,643 --> 00:02:37,764
Guys.

40
00:02:38,589 --> 00:02:39,337
I found it.

41
00:02:39,337 --> 00:02:43,393
I took a sample of your hair to see if your DNA matched my dad’s.

42
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:09,563
The man standing in front of me now

43
00:03:11,842 --> 00:03:13,654
is who I need to call Dad.

44
00:03:16,014 --> 00:03:19,647
But I don’t know which drawer of feelings I should open for him.

45
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:26,023
Watee.

46
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:33,016
Hello.

47
00:03:37,094 --> 00:03:37,987
Are you doing well?

48
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,429
Does it look like I’m doing well?

49
00:03:46,732 --> 00:03:47,532
I’m sorry

50
00:03:49,202 --> 00:03:49,943
I disappeared.

51
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:51,719
No worries at all.

52
00:03:53,258 --> 00:03:54,380
I had a good mother.

53
00:03:55,915 --> 00:03:58,065
She was both my father and mother.

54
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:00,293
She always had been.

55
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:03,714
I’m still not sure

56
00:04:04,936 --> 00:04:06,936
if I should hug the person in front of me

57
00:04:07,777 --> 00:04:09,777
to make up for how much I’ve missed him this whole time

58
00:04:11,224 --> 00:04:14,713
or I should be angry that he left me.

59
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:16,395
Please leave.

60
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:23,728
At least now I know how the person I’ve always missed looks like.

61
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,687
Why do you sound like you don’t trust me?

62
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:34,418
Watee!

63
00:04:35,841 --> 00:04:37,841
Is the reason you don’t trust others

64
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,134
because they’re not trustworthy

65
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:41,920
or because you’re an asshole?

66
00:04:43,665 --> 00:04:44,461
What about you?

67
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:46,876
Aren’t you an asshole?

68
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:50,481
Making me look stupid is such a good thing, right?

69
00:04:51,015 --> 00:04:52,167
It’s cool, isn’t it?

70
00:04:52,321 --> 00:04:53,678
You’re like a hero.

71
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:56,186
I’m not a hero.

72
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:58,392
I just wanted to know who you are.

73
00:04:59,814 --> 00:05:01,195
Wait.

74
00:05:01,891 --> 00:05:02,718
Teelek.

75
00:05:03,892 --> 00:05:07,056
Do you remember the story I told you about how I met your father?

76
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:09,018
That woman.

77
00:05:24,515 --> 00:05:26,121
That photo made me know for sure

78
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,590
you’re my dad’s son.

79
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:30,958
But I knew you’re someone

80
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,878
Mm.

81
00:05:34,218 --> 00:05:36,218
so I figured this paper could help me.

82
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,078
Mm.

83
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:39,918
Now I know.

84
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:42,180
Thank you so much.

85
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,537
You got what you wanted.

86
00:05:45,317 --> 00:05:46,400
I didn’t want this.

87
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,929
Get ready to move out.

88
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:51,645
Don’t worry about the deposit, I’ll transfer your money back.

89
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,810
You want to kick me out? Fine.

90
00:05:56,013 --> 00:05:57,216
But you have to know the truth.

91
00:05:59,132 --> 00:06:00,246
What fucking truth?

92
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,172
Isn’t this the truth?

93
00:06:02,902 --> 00:06:03,838
Dad didn’t leave you.

94
00:06:07,429 --> 00:06:08,476
He didn’t?

95
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:11,631
Are you saying he just forgot his other son?

96
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,976
He didn’t forget you.

97
00:06:14,898 --> 00:06:16,300
He forgot everything.

98
00:06:23,455 --> 00:06:25,000
After you were born,

99
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:28,866
Dad thought about going to his mother, our grandmother,

100
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:30,706
and tell her that she had a grandchild.

101
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:32,227
Are you sure she will understand?

102
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,852
Her grandchild is adorable.

103
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,228
She will come around when she sees him.

104
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:43,680
He was hoping her first grandchild would make it easier for her to approve of his and your mother’s relationship.

105
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,166
But on his way...

106
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,000
The doctor said he had amnesia

107
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,987
which could be temporary or permanent

108
00:06:56,987 --> 00:06:59,294
depending on his environment.

109
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,612
Watin, my son!

110
00:07:01,543 --> 00:07:03,321
Grandma made Dad recover at home

111
00:07:03,972 --> 00:07:06,393
and hired Nurse Koy to take care of him

112
00:07:06,947 --> 00:07:07,910
until...

113
00:07:10,672 --> 00:07:13,004
Koy, go inside.

114
00:07:17,525 --> 00:07:18,348
Tin.

115
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:25,222
Tin.

116
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,347
Where have you been?

117
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,358
I was worried sick about you.

118
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:37,672
Who are you?

119
00:07:42,702 --> 00:07:43,978
Do we know each other?

120
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:46,787
Tin.

121
00:07:50,185 --> 00:07:51,697
Please let him go back with me.

122
00:07:52,836 --> 00:07:56,276
He might be able to remember something.

123
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:59,743
Tin has a new life now.

124
00:08:01,032 --> 00:08:04,051
You should have one too.

125
00:08:09,863 --> 00:08:10,761
That woman,

126
00:08:11,714 --> 00:08:12,816
Nurse Koy,

127
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,937
is my mom.

128
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:18,620
She didn’t know our dad already had a family.

129
00:08:19,453 --> 00:08:20,589
Most importantly

130
00:08:21,414 --> 00:08:23,200
our dad couldn’t have wanted things to turn out this way.

131
00:08:30,114 --> 00:08:31,427
The more I hear,

132
00:08:33,324 --> 00:08:35,324
the more confused I am about how I should feel about you.

133
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:41,411
If you love me

134
00:08:42,436 --> 00:08:44,436
because of some sort of scientific evidence,

135
00:08:45,784 --> 00:08:47,540
let me tell you honestly

136
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:50,512
that you don’t have to.

137
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:52,758
I can live without you.

138
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,235
I brought Dad here today

139
00:08:58,303 --> 00:08:59,660
to let you know

140
00:09:00,388 --> 00:09:01,812
that you’re not alone.

141
00:09:02,855 --> 00:09:04,209
You still have Dad.

142
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,326
You still have me.

143
00:09:09,273 --> 00:09:10,985
We can start over.

144
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:14,733
But I don’t want that anymore.

145
00:09:19,117 --> 00:09:20,873
I shouldn’t have come back for you.

146
00:09:22,204 --> 00:09:23,384
Let’s go, Dad.

147
00:09:23,841 --> 00:09:24,888
You, too, T-Rex.

148
00:09:26,471 --> 00:09:27,873
Pack up all your stuff.

149
00:09:29,574 --> 00:09:31,574
I think I can no longer live in the same house as you.

150
00:09:36,324 --> 00:09:37,681
Thanks a lot.

151
00:09:39,592 --> 00:09:41,171
I had hoped

152
00:09:42,351 --> 00:09:44,351
I had hoped

153
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:49,353
You may have helped me overcome my fear,

154
00:09:50,874 --> 00:09:51,921
but now

155
00:09:53,877 --> 00:09:55,000
I know

156
00:10:03,207 --> 00:10:05,872
that I’d rather be a happy only child.

157
00:10:06,635 --> 00:10:07,549
Me too.

158
00:10:09,112 --> 00:10:10,558
I’ve never had any siblings

159
00:10:12,217 --> 00:10:14,749
but I know what sibling love is

160
00:10:16,177 --> 00:10:17,344
but I know what sibling love is

161
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:19,624
It’s not what you did to me.

162
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,785
If you call this sibling love,

163
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,694
I’d rather not have it.

164
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:32,160
That’s right.

165
00:10:33,236 --> 00:10:34,483
Even now,

166
00:10:35,236 --> 00:10:38,916
I can’t choose which drawer of feelings to open for this situation.

167
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,110
It’s okay.

168
00:10:58,388 --> 00:10:59,479
It’s okay.

169
00:11:00,906 --> 00:11:02,352
I’m telling you.

170
00:11:02,446 --> 00:11:05,760
Other than us, no one can stand you.

171
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,916
Pack up your things tonight.

172
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,001
I want you all gone before I go to bed.

173
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:48,115
Good luck.

174
00:11:52,368 --> 00:11:54,748
You’ve helped me a lot. Thank you so much.

175
00:11:57,515 --> 00:11:59,515
Call us anytime you need anything.

176

Why are you guys sad?

177
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
We will see each other again, right?

178
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:08,867
It’s not like we’re going to die.

179
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:10,779
Shorty.

180
00:12:11,646 --> 00:12:14,863
Now who’s going to scold me when I’m scared of ghosts?

181
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:18,433
You can turn to Teedet.

182
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,638
He’s going to scold you longer than I did.

183
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:22,436
Please scold him for me.

184
00:12:24,115 --> 00:12:24,841
Sure.

185
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:33,333
I have to go.

186

Bye-bye.

Good luck.
Bye.

Goodbye, T-Rex’s Dad.

Hey.

00:13:10,584 --> 00:13:11,555
How are you?

191
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,902
Just the usual.

192
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:15,350
Oh.

193

Uh...

196
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:32,351
Are you really going to return T-Rex’s rental fee?

197
00:13:36,757 --> 00:13:38,053
I don’t want his money anymore.

198
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:42,852
Do you have the money to give him back?

199
00:13:45,495 --> 00:13:46,753
I’ll need to earn more.

200

Dude.

201
00:13:49,894 --> 00:13:52,179
You may want to calm down and talk to him again tomorrow.

202
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:55,722
I am calm

203
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,297
but I’ve thought this through already.

204
00:13:59,933 --> 00:14:00,962
You’re calm,

205
00:14:02,191 --> 00:14:03,555
but you’re little heartless, don’t you think?

206
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,675
Dude.

207
00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:06,165
T-Rex meant well

208
00:14:07,085 --> 00:14:08,343
but look what he did.

209
00:14:08,997 --> 00:14:11,396
I think you were too harsh on him.

210
00:14:11,955 --> 00:14:16,047
I may have a foul mouth, but if that was my father, I wouldn’t have been that harsh on him.

211
00:14:17,436 --> 00:14:18,755
He isn’t your father, is he?

212
00:14:18,873 --> 00:14:20,055
What the fuck?

213

Hey.

214
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,673
You deserve to be alone.

215
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:27,097
Maybe you’re right.

216
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,534
Please leave me alone.

217
00:14:31,277 --> 00:14:32,573
Hey.

218
00:14:32,847 --> 00:14:34,275
Let me tell you something.

219
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,337
Other than us, no one can stand you.

220
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:41,526
You won’t have to anymore.

221
00:14:43,002 --> 00:14:45,401
Didn’t I make myself clear that I want to be alone?

222
00:14:46,394 --> 00:14:48,394
Do I have to spell it out for you?

223
00:14:48,803 --> 00:14:50,803
I don’t want any of you in my house anymore.

224
00:14:52,036 --> 00:14:52,914
Hey.

225
00:14:54,534 --> 00:14:55,849
Isn’t that a little impulsive?

226
00:14:57,116 --> 00:14:58,755
The first day you guys came here,

227
00:14:59,684 --> 00:15:01,475
I was clear about the rules.

228
00:15:02,016 --> 00:15:03,769
I could kick you guys out any time.

229
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,873
You’re a real asshole.

230
00:15:11,656 --> 00:15:12,355
Dude.

231
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:15,075
If you’re not okay with something, talk to us

232
00:15:15,408 --> 00:15:17,009
or add more rules.

233
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:18,439
But I think...

234
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:19,462
It’s not anyone’s birthday, right?

235

Hey.

236

As the friend you doubt the least,

237
00:15:27,115 --> 00:15:28,506
If you were my friend,

238
00:15:29,156 --> 00:15:32,069
you would know that I really want to be alone right now.

239
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,670
Pack up your things tonight.

240
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:49,147
I want you all gone before I go to bed.

241

I’ll return your deposits later.

Take care of yourself.

Right now I want to spend time thinking by myself

about all the chaos that’s been happening in this house.

247

I got my house back.

No.

Did you forget something?

258
00:19:25,796 --> 00:19:28,835
I think I heard something inside.

Ouch!

00:28:35,443 --> 00:28:39,291
I can go but I don’t know if Watee wants to see me.

341
00:28:40,744 --> 00:28:43,593
I think he’ll be happy that we’re taking Jab away.

342
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:45,672
I’m coming with you.

343
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:21,792
Who’s there?

344
00:29:22,955 --> 00:29:24,306
Did you forget something?

345
00:29:27,341 --> 00:29:28,267
Answer me.

346
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:33,795
Teedet, is that you?

347
00:29:39,163 --> 00:29:42,137
Suptawee Quick Cash. May your money grow.

348
00:29:44,025 --> 00:29:47,548
I told you I don’t have the money yet.

349
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:49,526
Please give me another week.

350
00:29:50,535 --> 00:29:52,260
It’s quick cash.

351
00:29:52,966 --> 00:29:56,090
Meaning other people need it. Meaning we can’t wait!

352
00:29:58,862 --> 00:30:00,646
I really don’t have the money right now.

353
00:30:00,646 --> 00:30:01,568
Then find it!

354
00:30:01,568 --> 00:30:02,800
I’m trying!

355
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,533
Are you talking back to me?

356
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:05,289
Hey!

357
00:30:06,198 --> 00:30:07,249
What are you doing?

358
00:30:07,249 --> 00:30:08,200
Please don’t.

359
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,766
While you’re still alive, go find the money!

360
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:22,126
Guys, I think we should call Watee first.

361
00:30:22,126 --> 00:30:22,933
I don’t want to trouble him.

362
00:30:22,933 --> 00:30:25,170
It’s fine. I want to see our dog.

363
00:30:25,887 --> 00:30:26,788
Guys.

364
00:30:28,623 --> 00:30:30,086
Why are the doors like that?

365
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,481
He hasn’t fixed them?

366
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:35,160
No idea.

367
00:30:38,844 --> 00:30:42,067
I think I heard something inside.

368
00:30:43,992 --> 00:30:45,243
Let’s go in and see.

369
00:30:47,009 --> 00:30:48,759
Find the money,

370
00:30:48,961 --> 00:30:50,406
if you don’t want to get hurt!

371
00:30:50,707 --> 00:30:51,658
Ouch!

372
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,146
What the hell?

373
00:31:03,681 --> 00:31:04,682
Go away!

374
00:31:07,463 --> 00:31:09,463
Mind your own business!

375
00:31:11,585 --> 00:31:12,944
Continue!

376
00:31:18,704 --> 00:31:21,286
Guys, this is an emergency. Come to Watee’s house immediately!

377
00:31:26,941 --> 00:31:28,492
Are you calling more friends over?

378
00:31:28,842 --> 00:31:29,671
Huh?

379
00:31:29,671 --> 00:31:30,768
Or are you calling your father?

380
00:31:31,366 --> 00:31:32,095
Huh?

381
00:31:44,575 --> 00:31:46,575
Directed by Nuttapong Mongkolsawas

382
00:31:49,163 --> 00:31:50,906
No one’s here to hear me play the cello.

383
00:31:51,206 --> 00:31:55,046
I kinda want to scold someone. I miss it.

384
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:57,579
No one’s here to scold me.

385
00:32:01,894 --> 00:32:03,370
Why did you guys move out?

386
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:05,606
Watee kicked us out.

387
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:09,902
And the house felt lonely without one of our friends.

388
00:32:09,902 --> 00:32:11,363
How much does my friend owe you?

389
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:14,927
If I don’t get the money back tonight, your friend will get it worse.

390
00:32:14,927 --> 00:32:16,327
I won’t let that happen.

391
00:32:16,327 --> 00:32:18,886
Living together is great.

392
00:32:19,046 --> 00:32:19,922
True.

393
00:32:21,313 --> 00:32:22,314
Hello, Mom.

394
00:32:23,244 --> 00:32:24,295
What?

395
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,216
How’s my father?

396
00:32:28,464 --> 00:32:31,846
You only see the value of something you have when you’re about to lose it.

397
00:32:31,846 --> 00:32:33,628
In the end, I couldn’t help him.

398
00:32:34,515 --> 00:32:37,589
This might be your last month.
