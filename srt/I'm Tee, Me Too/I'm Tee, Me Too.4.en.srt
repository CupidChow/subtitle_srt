1
00:00:00,197 --> 00:00:02,523
You managed to dine with her without your earphones.

2
00:00:02,523 --> 00:00:03,890
Thanks a lot, guys.

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,118
Watee must really feel uncomfortable around strangers.

4
00:00:06,118 --> 00:00:07,028
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:07,028 --> 00:00:09,065
I won't bring my father here again.

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,540
I can't let you be the only one trying to put up with the sound you hate for me.

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,173
I have to avoid making the sound you hate too.

8
00:00:15,173 --> 00:00:16,402
I saw a shadow.

9
00:00:16,402 --> 00:00:17,810
Are you dreaming?

10
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,141
Let’s go check outside if you don't believe me.

11
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,908
If the saying is true that naughty kids are clever kids,

12
00:00:27,593 --> 00:00:30,288
Little Maetee must have been a genius.

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,507
I was such a naughty child that everyone called me “the boy from hell”.

14
00:00:40,088 --> 00:00:43,739
There weren’t many ways you could deal with that boy from hell.

15
00:00:45,476 --> 00:00:48,519
Gold fish live in water. How could you sunbathe them?

16
00:00:50,097 --> 00:00:51,402
The beating stick.

17
00:00:52,161 --> 00:00:53,440
The hanger.

18
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:55,609
Were you trying to beat the chicks up?

19
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:58,953
I told you not to sleep with the eggs.

20
00:00:59,123 --> 00:01:01,123
Did you want to be a hen?

21
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,734
The ruler.

22
00:01:02,734 --> 00:01:04,659
Hold it in your mouth so you learn your lesson

23
00:01:05,694 --> 00:01:08,480
not to sing happy birthday at anyone’s funeral again.

24
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:10,810
What a wicked tongue you have!

25
00:01:12,728 --> 00:01:15,445
For a child of single-digit age,

26
00:01:15,445 --> 00:01:18,502
‘a wicked tongue’ sounded very cruel

27
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,364
and scary.

28
00:01:20,468 --> 00:01:23,098
What if his spirit showed up to crush your throat?

29
00:01:29,086 --> 00:01:31,086
You also ate the snack in front of his casket.

30
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:33,539
If he comes after you for his snack,

31
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:35,347
I won’t help you.

32
00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:42,161
What are you playing here?

33
00:01:42,161 --> 00:01:43,432
If ghosts blind my eyes, I won’t be able to find you.

34
00:01:43,432 --> 00:01:46,391
You’re so loud when you run.
The household spirits might catch you.

35
00:01:46,391 --> 00:01:48,818
The gecko ghosts are squeaking.

36
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:53,458
If you hit your dish while eating, ghosts will come eat with you.

37
00:02:00,813 --> 00:02:01,813
That’s right.

38
00:02:01,949 --> 00:02:03,949
My mother defeated the boy from hell with ghost stories.

39
00:02:04,496 --> 00:02:06,496
I heard a noise coming from here.

40
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,129
Stop, stop.

41
00:02:15,194 --> 00:02:16,998
I don’t hear anything.

42
00:02:17,978 --> 00:02:19,978
If there’s a noise, it should sound like this.

43
00:02:22,867 --> 00:02:24,802
Oh.

44
00:02:25,964 --> 00:02:27,964
Now I know.

45
00:02:28,221 --> 00:02:31,068
I don’t think the noise was from here.

46
00:02:38,495 --> 00:02:40,495
How about you lead the way?

47
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:42,369
No! I’m scared.

48
00:03:07,116 --> 00:03:07,921
Dude.

49
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,333
If this was a horror film,

50
00:03:12,103 --> 00:03:14,581
we’re hearing a cry for help from the spirits.

51
00:03:15,687 --> 00:03:17,280
And in that horror film,

52
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,819
you’d be the first to get scared by them.

53
00:03:23,352 --> 00:03:24,765
Why did you stop?

54
00:03:24,765 --> 00:03:26,569
Why are you not moving?

55
00:03:27,796 --> 00:03:30,560
Ah. You’re acting now.

56
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:34,290
Good acting. Have you been nominated for an award?

57
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,973
You like to scare me like my mother did.

58
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:37,881
You’re trying to make me pee my pants.

59
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:38,464
Right?

60
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,284
Oh, T-Rex.

61
00:03:40,592 --> 00:03:42,592
I don’t scare that easily.

62
00:03:44,117 --> 00:03:46,117
Fine. I’ll play along.

63
00:03:46,237 --> 00:03:49,760
If this was a horror film, you’re about to swallow your saliva.

64
00:03:51,903 --> 00:03:53,903
And you’re about to say....

65
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,288
Enough.

66
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,479
There he is.

67
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:18,885
The one who made noise last night.

68
00:05:19,996 --> 00:05:21,670
It wasn’t my fault.

69
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,035
It was Maitee’s.

70
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,186
He was sitting there crying because he missed his mom.

71
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,369
His eyes were red like ghosts. So scary.

72
00:05:30,978 --> 00:05:32,978
Crying because you missed your mom?
Are you a mama’s boy?

73
00:05:32,978 --> 00:05:33,510
Teedet.

74
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:36,119
If your mouth gets punched, you won’t enjoy eating.

75
00:05:36,492 --> 00:05:38,492
Save your mouth for my delicious food.

76
00:05:40,446 --> 00:05:41,294
Shit.

77
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:46,349
You didn’t get any sleep?

78
00:05:49,508 --> 00:05:51,008
Do you have anything to say to me?

79
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:54,188
Good morning.

80
00:05:59,086 --> 00:06:00,160
I’m sorry.

81
00:06:02,164 --> 00:06:03,490
Was I the reason you couldn’t sleep?

82
00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:04,674
Yes.

83
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:05,958
I was scared.

84
00:06:06,597 --> 00:06:09,120
We scream when we’re scared, right?

85
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,255
Right, shorty?

86
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,788
Mm.

87
00:06:13,762 --> 00:06:16,640
You also prayed until 3 a.m.

88
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:19,872
Just think of it as a choir song before bed.

89
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,735
Thank god I wore my headphones to sleep. I didn’t hear anything.

90
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,577
Maetee,

91
00:06:27,218 --> 00:06:30,500
your fear of ghosts is no longer your problem alone.

92
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,800
It has become everyone’s problem.

93
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:35,834
If you don’t stop causing trouble,

94
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:38,969
get ready to pack up and leave this house.

95
00:06:39,545 --> 00:06:40,545
Bye bye, friend.

96
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:47,001
He’s grumpy because he didn’t get enough sleep.

97
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,970
I’m sure that I’m scared of ghosts,

98
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,123
not the dark.

99
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:59,362
Because even at the time of day when the sun is directly over my head,

100
00:06:59,362 --> 00:07:00,970
I have no problems imagining

101
00:07:01,935 --> 00:07:03,261
a haunted bird,

102
00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:07,163
a haunted dog,

103
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:14,437
or a haunted mosquito.

104
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:21,595
What?

105
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:25,319
If I had a choice, I wouldn’t want to suffer from the same thing you do.

106
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,357
What are you talking about?

107
00:07:26,895 --> 00:07:27,722
Ghosts.

108
00:07:28,945 --> 00:07:30,945
Everyone is scared of them. It’s not uncommon.

109
00:07:31,747 --> 00:07:33,747
Thank you so much for understanding me.

110
00:07:36,408 --> 00:07:38,408
However, screaming in the middle of the night

111
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:39,542
is not normal.

112
00:07:41,014 --> 00:07:43,014
Let us help you.

113
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:47,501
How?

114
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,028
10 ways to see ghosts in the house

115
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,519
for people who’s looking for challenge.

116
00:07:58,674 --> 00:07:59,435
Look.

117
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:01,668
This will make you see that ghosts are not real.

118
00:08:02,407 --> 00:08:04,480
No. I don’t want to find out.

119
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,914
Come on, take a look.

120
00:08:05,914 --> 00:08:06,832
No!

121
00:08:06,962 --> 00:08:09,302
Don’t be scared. We’re all here together.

122
00:08:09,498 --> 00:08:10,437
Yeah.

123
00:08:11,413 --> 00:08:12,044
No.

124
00:08:24,013 --> 00:08:26,339
You must fight fear with fear.

125
00:08:36,962 --> 00:08:37,920
Here.

126
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,226
Are we really doing this?

127
00:08:42,226 --> 00:08:43,132
Yes, we are.

128
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:51,449
One:

129
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:54,656
Use an umbrella in the shade.

130
00:08:56,325 --> 00:08:58,325
The umbrella must be black.

131
00:08:59,891 --> 00:09:01,435
Keep calm and pray.

132
00:09:02,645 --> 00:09:07,079
It is said that by doing that, some spirits will appear next to you.

133
00:09:11,145 --> 00:09:14,709
I’m not sure there’s any black umbrellas in our bedrooms.

134
00:09:15,462 --> 00:09:16,832
I’ve never seen one.

135
00:09:20,189 --> 00:09:21,037
Get in.

136
00:09:41,338 --> 00:09:43,338
It’s red.

137
00:09:43,338 --> 00:09:45,781
Look, it’s red.

138
00:09:47,927 --> 00:09:52,708
♫ Ta Tonyon ♫ (singing a song about Northern Thailand where umbrellas are a cultural symbol)

139
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,104
Don’t get ahead of yourself.
We have a few more rooms to check.

140
00:09:54,234 --> 00:09:55,572
This is red.

141
00:09:56,832 --> 00:09:57,854
Get in.

142
00:09:57,854 --> 00:09:58,593
Go.

143
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:01,529
This is green.

144
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:11,441
There’s none here.

145
00:10:14,138 --> 00:10:16,138
There’s none here either.

146
00:10:30,472 --> 00:10:32,960
Black umbrellas.

147
00:10:34,408 --> 00:10:35,495
I’m going to open it now.

148
00:10:35,756 --> 00:10:36,408
Okay.

149
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,629
Are you going to start already?

150
00:11:26,377 --> 00:11:27,715
I’m about to.

151
00:11:27,715 --> 00:11:28,443
Okay.

152
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,470
What am I doing?

153
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,329
Just thinking about opening my eyes to see them sitting all over the house makes me want to....

154
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:53,887
Why were you screaming?
What did you see?

155
00:11:56,524 --> 00:11:57,506
Nothing.

156
00:11:57,506 --> 00:11:58,489
See?

157
00:11:59,556 --> 00:12:01,200
There’s nothing here.

158
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:10,139
Guys.

159
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,474
I’ll be back tomorrow morning. I’m working overtime.

160
00:12:13,474 --> 00:12:14,394
Look after the house for me.

161
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:15,818
Okay.

162
00:12:19,963 --> 00:12:20,888
Guys.

163
00:12:21,342 --> 00:12:23,342
I have a concerto rehearsal at uni.

164
00:12:23,446 --> 00:12:25,217
I might sleep there if I finish late.

165
00:12:25,217 --> 00:12:25,878
I’m going now.

166
00:12:26,336 --> 00:12:27,217
Okay.

167
00:12:33,172 --> 00:12:34,536
Tee-Do: What should we have for dinner tonight, Maitee?

168
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,188
Maitee:	I have to run errands with my mom.

169
00:12:37,248 --> 00:12:39,248
Maitee:	You guys find something to eat without me.

170
00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:43,935
Teedet:	I won’t be home tonight.

171
00:12:43,935 --> 00:12:45,373
Teedet:	I’m going on a field trip to Nakhon Nayok.

172
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
So it’s only you and me tonight?

173
00:12:49,531 --> 00:12:50,386
Mm.

174
00:12:55,668 --> 00:12:56,879
Sure, Dad.

175
00:12:59,008 --> 00:13:00,448
What’s that?

176
00:13:00,962 --> 00:13:02,479
My dad is in town.

177
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:04,353
Since he can’t come here

178
00:13:04,353 --> 00:13:06,385
because last time Watee told me off so badly,

179
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,949
I’m going to stay with him tonight.

180
00:13:11,506 --> 00:13:14,015
No! I can’t sleep alone!

181
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:19,743
See?

182
00:13:20,096 --> 00:13:22,096
You can do it.

183
00:13:22,096 --> 00:13:23,376
Are you sleepy?

184
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,671
Not yet.

185
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:27,873
Why don’t you go to sleep if you’re scared?

186
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,568
Hey, hold on a second.

187
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:33,632
Okay.

188
00:13:39,815 --> 00:13:40,746
Dude.

189
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:43,006
Are you back yet?

190
00:13:46,212 --> 00:13:47,045
Shorty!

191
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:48,409
Shorty!

192
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,248
I’m back.

193
00:13:53,698 --> 00:13:56,310
My dad asked me to turn on Wi-Fi.

194
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,704
He doesn’t know how to do it.

195
00:13:57,984 --> 00:13:59,129
Okay.

196
00:14:00,961 --> 00:14:02,527
I’ll be right back.

197
00:14:03,112 --> 00:14:04,715
Dude!

198
00:14:04,715 --> 00:14:05,833
Hmm?

199
00:14:06,469 --> 00:14:08,004
Go spend time with your dad.

200
00:14:08,691 --> 00:14:09,930
Okay.

201
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:24,774
This Buddha amulet survives.

202
00:14:24,774 --> 00:14:26,284
I survive.

203
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:27,791
I will survive.

204
00:14:46,477 --> 00:14:49,189
Even though the light can’t make my fear of ghosts go away,

205
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:56,353
it helps lessening my ability to imagine things.

206
00:15:58,489 --> 00:16:00,845
Date of Death: 11 August 2020, Time of Death: 00.09 a.m.

207
00:16:07,781 --> 00:16:14,968
Is it right that I have to be alone in the house where someone died 50 days ago?

208
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,417
Why does it have to be tonight?

209
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,659
Who’s that?

210
00:16:44,423 --> 00:16:46,423
You must fight fear with fear.

211
00:17:22,659 --> 00:17:25,295
Why is that piece of cloth on the floor?

212
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,588
Oh.

213
00:17:42,249 --> 00:17:44,249
Because it wasn’t laid straight.

214
00:17:44,627 --> 00:17:46,627
According to physics,

215
00:17:46,627 --> 00:17:49,112
it could fall.

216
00:17:49,112 --> 00:17:52,734
Maetee, don’t hallucinate!

217
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,622
No one moved the cloth.

218
00:17:56,449 --> 00:17:57,688
I did.

219
00:17:57,688 --> 00:17:59,241
Right.

220
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:17,538
Oh, Maetee!

221
00:18:17,538 --> 00:18:20,049
You’re hallucinating.

222
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:26,191
When you open your eyes, she’ll be gone.

223
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,172
Hey.

224
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,900
Guys, he’s awake.

225
00:18:50,035 --> 00:18:51,730
How are you feeling?

226
00:18:53,012 --> 00:18:56,844
You guys don’t know what I saw last night.

227
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:57,844
What did you see?

228
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,770
I saw Watee’s mother’s ghost.

229
00:19:10,253 --> 00:19:11,233
Really?

230
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,159
Yes. She was standing right there.

231
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:16,428
Right there. Her hair was this long.

232
00:19:16,428 --> 00:19:20,073
She was wearing white and sitting there.

233
00:19:20,073 --> 00:19:21,653
She’s coming!

234
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:28,172
Get out! Get out!

235
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:32,248
That scream makes us unable to sleep every night.

236
00:19:33,341 --> 00:19:36,791
Stop pranking your friend. I’m Auntie Pim.

237
00:19:37,122 --> 00:19:38,581
Who’s Auntie Pim?

238
00:19:39,523 --> 00:19:41,956
Auntie Pim is the twin sister of Watee’s mother.

239
00:19:43,069 --> 00:19:45,069
Twin sister?

240
00:19:45,944 --> 00:19:49,089
Auntie Pim just got back from making merit on the 50th day after Watee’s mother’s death.

241
00:19:51,195 --> 00:19:53,195
Where’s Watee, by the way?

242
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,942
As soon as he got back from the temple,

243
00:19:56,647 --> 00:19:58,647
he went straight to his bedroom without talking to anyone.

244
00:19:58,647 --> 00:19:59,483
He’s keeping to himself.

245
00:20:02,732 --> 00:20:03,892
I feel for him.

246
00:20:04,465 --> 00:20:06,465
It must be really hard for him.

247
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:13,159
One day, I’ll have to go through the same thing as him.

248
00:20:14,871 --> 00:20:15,955
Is everything alright?

249
00:20:16,946 --> 00:20:18,946
I’m fine. I’m just thinking about how I’d feel

250
00:20:20,467 --> 00:20:23,892
if I had to make merit for my dead mother.

251
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:27,682
Don’t think about that.

252
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:31,471
Your mother is still well, isn’t she?

253
00:20:32,777 --> 00:20:38,161
My mom is in the hospital. She’s not well.

254
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:41,197
The doctor can’t tell how much time she has left.

255
00:20:42,171 --> 00:20:43,145
Hey.

256
00:20:44,015 --> 00:20:46,015
Let me know if we can help with anything.

257
00:20:48,407 --> 00:20:49,527
Yes.

258
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:52,261
My uncle works as a doctor at a hospital.

259
00:20:52,261 --> 00:20:55,699
If you need help with hospital beds or anything, just let me know.

260
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
My uncle owns a pharmacy.

261
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,606
If you need any medicine, just let me know. I’ll get it for you.

262
00:21:07,453 --> 00:21:13,244
Sometimes sharing your problems can make you feel better.

263
00:21:19,931 --> 00:21:21,931
Thank you so much, guys.

264
00:21:43,986 --> 00:21:45,630
May I come in?

265
00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:52,514
Yes.

266
00:22:07,248 --> 00:22:08,560
Tee.

267
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,810
Are you okay?

268
00:22:11,562 --> 00:22:13,314
I’m just missing my mom.

269
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:18,873
I’m sure that

270
00:22:19,566 --> 00:22:24,060
Ploy is happy and full from the food you sent her.

271
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:25,912
It was all her favorites.

272
00:22:31,961 --> 00:22:35,437
Does your dad know about her death?

273
00:22:41,884 --> 00:22:43,884
Is my dad alive?

274
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:48,119
You haven’t been keeping in touch?

275
00:22:50,385 --> 00:22:52,385
I’ve never met him.

276
00:22:54,444 --> 00:22:56,444
I never knew how to contact him.

277
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:05,278
So,

278
00:23:05,278 --> 00:23:07,093
are you flying back right away?

279
00:23:10,517 --> 00:23:12,517
I think I’m flying back tonight.

280
00:23:13,715 --> 00:23:15,181
At first,

281
00:23:16,671 --> 00:23:18,671
I was worried about you.

282
00:23:18,671 --> 00:23:20,622
I wanted to ask you to come live with me.

283
00:23:21,564 --> 00:23:23,564
But after meeting your friends,

284
00:23:24,379 --> 00:23:26,008
I knew you’ll be okay.

285
00:23:29,781 --> 00:23:31,272
But you just came here.

286
00:23:31,272 --> 00:23:33,355
How do you know they can be trusted?

287
00:23:35,354 --> 00:23:37,354
I’ve seen a lot of people.

288
00:23:38,595 --> 00:23:40,595
Those five friends of yours,

289
00:23:43,229 --> 00:23:46,168
I think they can become your other family.

290
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:48,290
Trust me.

291
00:23:54,695 --> 00:23:56,695
Safe travels.

292
00:23:56,695 --> 00:23:58,486
Thanks. I’m going now.

293
00:23:58,486 --> 00:24:00,279
You can call me anytime.

294
00:24:00,508 --> 00:24:01,460
Okay.

295
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:01,980
Alright.

296
00:24:06,421 --> 00:24:07,810
Tee.

297
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:11,917
I’m talking to all of you.

298
00:24:13,532 --> 00:24:14,998
Take good care of each other.

299
00:24:14,998 --> 00:24:16,024
We will.

300
00:24:17,936 --> 00:24:19,936
You should come visit often

301
00:24:19,936 --> 00:24:22,045
but it’ll be great if you let us know in advance.

302
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:23,328
I will.

303
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,180
I’m going now.

304
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:30,723
Safe trip home.
Thanks. Bye.

305
00:24:32,248 --> 00:24:34,248
It’s a bummer Auntie Pim left early.

306
00:24:34,722 --> 00:24:36,888
One night was enough for me...

307
00:24:36,888 --> 00:24:38,260
Hey!

308
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,061
I mean I wish she could’ve stayed another night.

309
00:24:41,061 --> 00:24:42,410
She’s a nice lady.

310
00:24:45,006 --> 00:24:46,624
Who’s there?

311
00:24:56,793 --> 00:24:57,953
Mom.

312
00:24:58,618 --> 00:25:00,618
Why are you here?

313
00:25:00,618 --> 00:25:03,628
You called me that you hit your head on the floor.
Of course, I got worried.

314
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:04,688
Let me see your bruises.

315
00:25:04,688 --> 00:25:06,004
Mom, I’m okay now.

316
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,209
I’m recovered.

317
00:25:08,209 --> 00:25:11,103
You should leave quickly.
The owner of this house doesn’t allow guests.

318
00:25:11,453 --> 00:25:13,453
I don’t care. Carry that for me.

319
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,780
Oh.

320
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,737
Wow.

321
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,540
All these in a jar.

322
00:25:25,703 --> 00:25:27,703
Does Tee still leave the door open while he poops?

323
00:25:27,703 --> 00:25:29,126
That’s enough, Mom.

324
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:30,246
Let me check your bedroom.

325
00:25:30,246 --> 00:25:31,095
Mom, stop.

326
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,954
If you’re here to act this way, don’t come again.

327
00:26:10,655 --> 00:26:14,054
Your favorite crispy pork place was closed today.

328
00:26:14,054 --> 00:26:16,143
I’ll buy from there next time.

329
00:26:17,933 --> 00:26:20,750
Why are you wearing headphones?

330
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,507
Mom, leave him alone.

331
00:26:29,659 --> 00:26:31,030
Hey.

332
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:34,463
Why are you making noise while eating?

333
00:26:35,057 --> 00:26:37,057
People could say your parents didn’t teach you.

334
00:26:37,057 --> 00:26:37,941
I’m almost finished.

335
00:26:38,175 --> 00:26:39,253
I don’t know who you’re calling.

336
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,641
By the way,

337
00:26:42,641 --> 00:26:45,065
does Tee still leave the door open while he poops?

338
00:26:46,374 --> 00:26:47,117
Yes.

339
00:26:47,455 --> 00:26:49,734
Why do you do that?

340
00:26:49,971 --> 00:26:51,531
This is not your house.

341
00:26:52,274 --> 00:26:53,352
That’s enough, Mom.

342
00:26:55,979 --> 00:26:57,979
Why won’t you close the door?

343
00:26:57,979 --> 00:26:58,507
Hey.

344
00:26:58,507 --> 00:27:00,057
You.

345
00:27:00,057 --> 00:27:00,848
Yes?

346
00:27:01,015 --> 00:27:03,015
How can you put up with him?

347
00:27:03,015 --> 00:27:07,991
If he does anything nonsense, feel free to talk some sense into him. You have my permission.

348
00:27:07,991 --> 00:27:08,738
Mom, enough.

349
00:27:09,414 --> 00:27:11,014
Let me check your bedroom. I want to see how it is.

350
00:27:11,014 --> 00:27:11,961
Mom, stop.

351
00:27:13,556 --> 00:27:16,352
If you’re here to act this way, don’t come again.

352
00:27:16,577 --> 00:27:18,174
You’re embarrassing.

353
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:41,844
Is the food yummy? It is, right?

354
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,396
I have to go.

355
00:27:46,396 --> 00:27:47,112
Bye.

356
00:27:47,112 --> 00:27:48,042
Bye.

357
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:49,155
Bye guys.

358
00:27:59,404 --> 00:28:01,572
Yes. There’s nothing to worry about.

359
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:04,779
I’ve already sent the documents.

360
00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:05,576
Yes.

361
00:28:05,576 --> 00:28:06,337
Oh!

362
00:28:09,024 --> 00:28:11,024
Are you alright?
I’m fine.

363
00:28:13,175 --> 00:28:16,076
I don’t think you are.

364
00:28:19,044 --> 00:28:21,044
Please have a seat over there.

365
00:28:21,044 --> 00:28:22,585
My ankle hurts.

366
00:28:22,585 --> 00:28:24,655
I think you twisted it.

367
00:28:24,655 --> 00:28:25,155
Ouch.

368
00:28:26,687 --> 00:28:28,058
I’m trying to walk.

369
00:28:28,058 --> 00:28:29,085
Slowly. It’s okay.

370
00:28:31,749 --> 00:28:33,749
I got you a taxi.

371
00:28:34,357 --> 00:28:35,322
Thanks.

372
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:38,174
You’re so handsome and kind.

373
00:28:44,108 --> 00:28:46,108
You don’t look like you’re from around here.

374
00:28:46,337 --> 00:28:48,882
No. I came here to visit my son.

375
00:28:48,882 --> 00:28:50,600
He’s renting a house in this neighborhood.

376
00:28:50,985 --> 00:28:52,985
He’s around your age

377
00:28:53,254 --> 00:28:54,793
but he’s more handsome than you.

378
00:28:54,793 --> 00:28:55,334
Right.

379
00:28:58,953 --> 00:29:00,953
I can’t visit him often though.

380
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:05,414
Why not?

381
00:29:06,731 --> 00:29:08,731
He said he didn’t want to see me. He’s embarrassed.

382
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:13,574
I don’t think that’s true.

383
00:29:13,574 --> 00:29:15,574
Every child wants to see their parents.

384
00:29:17,103 --> 00:29:18,174
Really?

385
00:29:18,711 --> 00:29:20,292
What about your mother?

386
00:29:26,383 --> 00:29:29,494
My mom’s gone.

387
00:29:29,845 --> 00:29:31,845
Where is she?

388
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,374
Don’t you want to see her?

389
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:40,782
See? I don’t understand kids these days.

390
00:29:40,782 --> 00:29:42,112
My mom passed away.

391
00:29:42,427 --> 00:29:44,155
Oh, then it’s better that you don’t see her.

392
00:29:47,008 --> 00:29:47,876
Miss.

393
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:50,959
Even though your son said that,

394
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,640
I think he misses you.

395
00:29:55,677 --> 00:29:58,767
So you should visit him sometimes.

396
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,691
I want to

397
00:30:02,376 --> 00:30:04,942
but he said the owner of the house doesn’t want guests.

398
00:30:05,895 --> 00:30:08,859
I don’t know why that man is so cruel.

399
00:30:09,172 --> 00:30:11,172
He won’t allow a mother to see her son.

400
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:18,762
Miss.

401
00:30:19,653 --> 00:30:26,137
You can visit your son from time to time.
I don’t think the owner would be so cruel as to forbid that.

402
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,470
Is my mother smiling differently again?

403
00:30:48,028 --> 00:30:49,085
No.

404
00:30:51,973 --> 00:30:53,973
I thought you saw her twin again.

405
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:55,654
She has another twin?

406
00:30:56,076 --> 00:30:57,070
I was joking.

407
00:31:02,102 --> 00:31:04,774
Do you know why I’m scared of ghosts?

408
00:31:08,978 --> 00:31:12,717
When I was young, my mother always warned me

409
00:31:13,089 --> 00:31:16,535
not to be naughty or I’d be taken by ghosts.

410
00:31:17,914 --> 00:31:19,327
She threatened me in various ways.

411
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,452
But look what happens now.

412
00:31:23,552 --> 00:31:26,411
She tells me off for still being scared of ghosts at this age

413
00:31:27,942 --> 00:31:31,723
when she’s the one who made me fear them.

414
00:31:37,384 --> 00:31:39,133
I envy that she tells you off.

415
00:31:40,677 --> 00:31:42,677
You envy that I get told off?

416
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:52,965
I envy that you still have a mother to tell you off.

417
00:31:56,482 --> 00:32:01,164
Having a mother to tell you off is better than not.

418
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,813
Don’t you think?

419
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:31,432
Mom.

420
00:32:31,945 --> 00:32:33,274
You’re here again.

421
00:32:36,934 --> 00:32:38,934
Please leave now.

422
00:32:40,089 --> 00:32:42,089
Please leave now. Hurry.

423
00:32:42,089 --> 00:32:43,338
Hurry.

424
00:32:46,421 --> 00:32:47,667
Who’s there?

425
00:32:49,756 --> 00:32:51,756
Directed by Nuttapong Mongkolsawas

426
00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:55,503
Two.

427
00:32:55,942 --> 00:32:57,942
Put a dog’s tear on your eyelids

428
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:59,504
and open your eyes.

429
00:32:59,504 --> 00:33:01,830
You will see scary spirits.

430
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,770
Ready?

431
00:33:03,737 --> 00:33:05,737
No. I’m going to throw up.

432
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,006
Come on.

433
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:10,054
Teedet and I spent a long time getting Jack’s tear for you.

434
00:33:10,383 --> 00:33:12,383
Let’s try this other way so you see that ghosts aren’t real.

435
00:33:13,978 --> 00:33:15,328
Do I really have to do this?

436
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:17,602
Yes. Just get it over with.

437
00:33:17,602 --> 00:33:19,164
I got you salt water.

438
00:33:20,385 --> 00:33:21,442
Come on.

439
00:33:24,318 --> 00:33:25,543
Close your eyes.

440
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:30,214
Eew!

441
00:33:32,153 --> 00:33:33,000
There.

442
00:33:46,354 --> 00:33:48,354
What’s wrong?
Did you see a ghost?

443
00:33:48,354 --> 00:33:50,114
I’m washing this off. It’s dirty.

444
00:33:52,252 --> 00:33:53,203
Oh.

445
00:33:53,203 --> 00:33:54,804
It’s embarrassing.

446
00:33:54,804 --> 00:33:55,775
Open the door, Mom.

447
00:33:55,775 --> 00:33:57,895
Let’s try and close it for once.

448
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,117
What are you doing?

449
00:34:00,557 --> 00:34:01,473
Shh!

450
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:03,939
I’ll let you guys know when it’s time.

451
00:34:03,939 --> 00:34:04,917
Whoa!

452
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,811
Watee texted that he’ll be joining us for dinner.

453
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:09,975
You’re a friend of T-Rex.

454
00:34:09,975 --> 00:34:11,441
No wonder you look familiar.

455
00:34:11,441 --> 00:34:12,476
Who are you texting?

456
00:34:12,476 --> 00:34:13,405
A friend.

457
00:34:13,405 --> 00:34:14,382
What kind of friend?

458
00:34:14,382 --> 00:34:15,215
Can she become more than that?

459
00:34:15,215 --> 00:34:18,795
Different kind of plants need different care.

460
00:34:18,795 --> 00:34:20,240
Just like people.
