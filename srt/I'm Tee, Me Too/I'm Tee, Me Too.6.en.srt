1
00:00:01,318 --> 00:00:03,318
I’m not feeling nauseous at all,

2
00:00:03,318 --> 00:00:04,258
really.

3
00:00:04,258 --> 00:00:06,011
You’re going to have a girlfriend soon.

4
00:00:06,011 --> 00:00:07,482
Woohoo!

5
00:00:07,482 --> 00:00:08,086
Is she pretty?

6
00:00:08,086 --> 00:00:10,107
No. Her face is round and flat.

7
00:00:10,107 --> 00:00:11,299
I like that you’re not pretty.

8
00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:12,425
I like you for who you are.

9
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:12,982
Silly.

10
00:00:13,377 --> 00:00:14,251
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:23,219
It’s true.

12
00:00:24,549 --> 00:00:26,549
Everyone has fears.

13
00:00:36,214 --> 00:00:38,214
I’m going to take the best care of your father.

14
00:00:38,214 --> 00:00:39,156
Don’t worry

15
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:41,093
but

16
00:00:41,697 --> 00:00:42,679
prepare for the worst.

17
00:00:51,165 --> 00:00:53,165
Is Dad going to be okay?

18
00:00:55,705 --> 00:00:56,752
It’s okay.

19
00:00:57,356 --> 00:00:58,340
It’s okay.

20
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,790
He’s going to be okay.

21
00:01:01,418 --> 00:01:03,418
Don’t be scared.

22
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,720
The patient’s family, please.

23
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:15,646
We’ve done everything we could.

24
00:01:16,506 --> 00:01:17,225
Huh?

25
00:01:18,876 --> 00:01:23,083
But the patient’s body and internal organs have been badly damaged.

26
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,792
I’m so sorry.

27
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:30,497
Doctor.

28
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:39,196
Did the doctor lie to me?

29
00:01:43,127 --> 00:01:45,127
No, he didn’t.

30
00:01:45,127 --> 00:01:46,895
He’s tried his best

31
00:01:47,336 --> 00:01:48,080
but.

32
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,563
But what?

33
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,509
Since then,

34
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:02,179
‘but’ has become my most-hated word.

35
00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:07,319
Yes, Mom.

36
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:08,630
Get some rest.

37
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:11,653
I love you.

38
00:02:14,627 --> 00:02:15,773
Okay.

39
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:22,560
Are you okay?

40
00:02:38,474 --> 00:02:40,126
Can I ask you something?

41
00:02:43,484 --> 00:02:45,484
On the first day that you lost your mom,

42
00:02:49,155 --> 00:02:50,306
how did you feel?

43
00:02:56,349 --> 00:02:57,280
Uh...

44
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:02,901
That day

45
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:06,739
I didn’t cry at all

46
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:10,263
but my body went numb.

47
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,642
My mind went blank.

48
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:14,875
I didn’t know what to do.

49
00:03:20,444 --> 00:03:21,422
That’s about it.

50
00:03:23,281 --> 00:03:24,827
Did it take you a long time

51
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,475
to get over it?

52
00:03:33,957 --> 00:03:35,173
Not at all.

53
00:03:38,054 --> 00:03:39,216
I’ve never gotten over it.

54
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:44,989
I still think of my mom every day.

55
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,738
I couldn’t imagine it before.

56
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:56,557
I didn’t know how it felt.

57
00:03:58,718 --> 00:04:00,706
But now, the picture is getting clearer.

58
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:08,906
I think I get it now.

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,868
I understand how you felt when you lost your mom.

60
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:14,406
What do you mean?

61
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:16,982
How could you understand me?

62
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:22,815
I do, because soon

63
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,475
I might lose my mom too.

64
00:04:39,652 --> 00:04:41,265
Hey, calm down.

65
00:04:41,265 --> 00:04:42,519
What’s going on with your mom?

66
00:04:54,021 --> 00:04:55,278
How’s my mother?

67
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,255
Your mother has a brain tumor.

68
00:04:58,835 --> 00:04:59,965
What?

69
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:01,887
Don’t worry.

70
00:05:02,398 --> 00:05:03,705
It can be cured

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,999
but

72
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,442
it can also come back.

73
00:06:18,394 --> 00:06:20,394
That’s why I often go to that hospital.

74
00:06:25,226 --> 00:06:26,268
Hey.

75
00:06:27,383 --> 00:06:28,640
They have great doctors there.

76
00:06:29,383 --> 00:06:30,385
Don’t worry.

77
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,618
By the way, do you remember me now?

78
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,840
I mean if you ran into me on campus,

79
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,717
I don’t remember. There were a lot of people.

80
00:06:50,717 --> 00:06:51,753
No,

81
00:06:52,427 --> 00:06:53,649
we met before that.

82
00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:55,556
It wasn’t at the university.

83
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,556
Oh.

84
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:01,799
You met me where I work, right?

85
00:07:02,194 --> 00:07:02,901
No.

86
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:05,573
Where then?

87
00:07:09,265 --> 00:07:10,240
Here.

88
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,996
Huh?

89
00:07:11,716 --> 00:07:12,697
Here?

90
00:07:12,906 --> 00:07:13,725
No.

91
00:07:17,884 --> 00:07:18,885
Red face.

92
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:23,725
Tee, say hello to Auntie Ple.

93
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:24,279
- Hello.
- Hello.

94
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:26,630
Auntie Ple is my best friend.

95
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,338
Her son is staying in Bangkok during his whole school holidays.

96
00:07:30,338 --> 00:07:31,847
Hi, I’m Tee.

97
00:07:31,847 --> 00:07:32,935
Hi, my name is also Tee.

98
00:07:32,935 --> 00:07:35,218
Oh, why do we have the same name?

99
00:07:35,218 --> 00:07:38,662
If we say Tee, who’s going to answer?

100
00:07:38,662 --> 00:07:40,247
I know, right?

101
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,000
What a shame.

102
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,379
I’m going to win this time.

103
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:49,361
Yay! I won!

104
00:07:49,361 --> 00:07:50,866
Woohoo!

105
00:07:51,297 --> 00:07:53,297
Why do you always puff your cheek when you lose?

106
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:54,717
What’s the problem?

107
00:07:54,717 --> 00:07:56,235
You look like a bullfrog.

108
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,491
Bullfrog.

109
00:08:05,182 --> 00:08:07,182
Mm. That’s a piece of cake.

110
00:08:12,863 --> 00:08:13,701
Look.

111
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,758
Your face is so red.

112
00:08:26,758 --> 00:08:27,463
Red face.

113
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,070
What?

114
00:08:33,232 --> 00:08:34,225
Are you Bullfrog?

115
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:37,769
Why didn’t you tell me that you’re Bullfrog?

116
00:08:38,992 --> 00:08:40,480
I’ve told you so many times.

117
00:08:40,826 --> 00:08:43,802
You’ve been acting like you don’t want to know.

118
00:08:47,264 --> 00:08:48,692
Think carefully

119
00:08:49,273 --> 00:08:50,379
back to the first time.

120
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:52,893
This is the kitchen.

121
00:08:54,821 --> 00:08:56,162
What you see is all the equipment there is.

122
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,502
How big is the kitchen you normally use?

123
00:08:59,245 --> 00:09:00,469
Around this size.

124
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:04,736
I prefer cooking to eating out.

125
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:10,103
Wait, isn’t that a hand towel?

126
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:13,760
Is there anything else you want to know?

127
00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:17,280
Do you remember me?

128
00:09:18,927 --> 00:09:20,184
Are you going to rent this place or not?

129
00:09:31,894 --> 00:09:33,685
Skipping breakfast

130
00:09:33,685 --> 00:09:34,925
is why you have bad memory.

131
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:37,007
What freaking memory?

132
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,440
I asked you if we’ve met before.

133
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:44,199
I think your memory is worse than mine.

134
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,910
I told you I can’t remember.

135
00:09:50,721 --> 00:09:51,676
Heat this for 3 minutes before you eat.

136
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:54,177
It’s great that you remember your childhood friends.

137
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:55,768
I do, too.

138
00:09:57,162 --> 00:09:57,894
Oh.

139
00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:05,190
You’ve changed a lot.

140
00:10:12,337 --> 00:10:14,523
Why are you renting this house?

141
00:10:16,498 --> 00:10:19,102
At first, I couldn’t remember our childhood story, just like you didn’t.

142
00:10:20,846 --> 00:10:24,320
But when I saw this house, everything looked so familiar.

143
00:10:24,495 --> 00:10:26,495
As soon as I saw you, everything clicked.

144
00:10:27,657 --> 00:10:29,690
It’s Auntie Ploy’s and Reddy Face’s house.

145
00:10:31,527 --> 00:10:33,666
But you couldn’t remember me.

146
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:42,530
Well, I hope Auntie Ple gets well soon.

147
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,240
Thank you so much.

148
00:10:52,465 --> 00:10:53,675
Does this mean

149
00:10:54,761 --> 00:10:57,504
I’m your closest friend in this house now?

150
00:11:00,414 --> 00:11:04,320
I’d say you’re the person I trust the most in this house.

151
00:11:04,738 --> 00:11:05,571
No,

152
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:09,418
I’d say you’re the friend I doubt the least.

153
00:11:09,743 --> 00:11:10,616
Dude.

154
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,457
“Close” is easy to say.

155
00:11:17,336 --> 00:11:18,871
I’d rather say “doubt the least”.

156
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:19,799
That’s good enough.

157
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,889
Do you remember our promise?

158
00:11:28,024 --> 00:11:29,252
What promise?

159
00:11:31,506 --> 00:11:32,550
Never mind.

160
00:11:37,636 --> 00:11:39,380
Mm. Never mind.

161
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,087
Let’s go inside. There are a lot of mosquitoes out here.

162
00:11:51,673 --> 00:11:53,673
The good news for me today is

163
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,270
I got my friend from primary school days back.

164
00:11:57,586 --> 00:11:59,098
The bad news is

165
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:01,655
he only remember that we’re friends

166
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,321
and nothing else.

167
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:08,320
Why are you afraid of good news?

168
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,016
[Auntie Wan’s calling]

169
00:12:12,645 --> 00:12:13,855
Hello, Auntie Wan.

170
00:12:14,421 --> 00:12:15,399
Pardon?

171
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:49,807
Okay, Dad.

172
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:50,885
Sure.

173
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:52,290
That won’t be a problem.

174
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,347
Watee.

175
00:13:00,252 --> 00:13:01,157
What are you writing?

176
00:13:01,801 --> 00:13:02,782
More rules.

177
00:13:03,104 --> 00:13:04,208
More rules?

178
00:13:07,546 --> 00:13:08,480
What else now?

179
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:10,553
Guys.

180
00:13:11,426 --> 00:13:13,165
Food is ready.
Come eat.

181
00:13:13,986 --> 00:13:14,807
Give me a second.

182
00:13:25,506 --> 00:13:26,429
Is this red rice?

183
00:13:27,586 --> 00:13:29,003
Ugh!

184
00:13:29,385 --> 00:13:30,922
What are we going to eat it with?

185
00:13:30,922 --> 00:13:32,292
Here you go.

186
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:34,091
Shrimp paste rice buffet.

187
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:35,777
Oh.

188
00:13:36,561 --> 00:13:37,591
It looks good.

189
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,593
You’ve never made this before.

190
00:13:42,227 --> 00:13:43,764
It’s Watee’s favorite.

191
00:13:43,764 --> 00:13:44,950
How do you know?

192
00:13:45,332 --> 00:13:46,097
I’m smart.

193
00:13:46,897 --> 00:13:48,897
Why? Don’t you guys like it?

194
00:13:48,897 --> 00:13:50,400
Why? Don’t you guys like it?

195
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,855
I like this dish. I always ate it when I was young.

196
00:13:53,025 --> 00:13:53,840
Alright.

197
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:55,983
Wait.

198
00:13:56,988 --> 00:13:57,871
Watee,

199
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,679
what other rules were you adding?

200
00:14:01,272 --> 00:14:03,111
You’re adding more rules?

201
00:14:03,846 --> 00:14:05,404
Let me guess.

202
00:14:05,404 --> 00:14:06,953
‘Don’t make a sound at night.’

203
00:14:08,023 --> 00:14:09,078
I’m used to that already.

204
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:10,270
‘Don’t break things’?

205
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,032
Are you still breaking my stuff?

206
00:14:13,147 --> 00:14:14,262
What are they?

207
00:14:15,338 --> 00:14:17,338
Listen, you don’t have to know now.

208
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:18,551
You’ll find out at the same time.

209
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,041
Boo.

210
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,202
Let’s eat.

211
00:14:27,981 --> 00:14:29,981
You guys like to fight for food?

212
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:33,913
Fight for food.

213
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,121
Watee,

214
00:14:37,553 --> 00:14:38,945
you don’t eat chili?

215
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:39,572
No.

216
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:40,904
He doesn’t eat spicy food.

217
00:14:41,306 --> 00:14:42,073
Why not?

218
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:44,385
Eating spicy food turns his face red.

219
00:14:44,546 --> 00:14:46,546
Hmm? Are you blushing? Why?

220
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:50,125
Can a red face be trusted? (Joke - lyrics to a Thai song)

221
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:51,292
Lips. (Actual lyrics say lips not face)

222
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:52,464
Oh, lips.

223
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:54,311
I can eat a little.

224
00:14:55,717 --> 00:14:56,551
I’ll show you.

225
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,514
Look.

226
00:15:10,145 --> 00:15:11,340
He can eat it.

227
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:12,924
Why did you say he can’t?

228
00:15:12,924 --> 00:15:13,746
He can.

229
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,443
Right.

230
00:15:15,774 --> 00:15:16,668
You can eat it now?

231
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:25,257
Isn’t that chili too spicy? Usually, it’s not this spicy.

232
00:15:25,488 --> 00:15:26,945
No, usually you don’t eat chili.

233
00:15:27,663 --> 00:15:28,979
Your face is so red.

234
00:15:28,979 --> 00:15:29,907
What do we do?

235
00:15:30,657 --> 00:15:31,511
This is not going well.

236
00:15:31,511 --> 00:15:32,385
Let me go on Google.

237
00:15:32,385 --> 00:15:33,271
I’ll help, too.

238
00:15:33,271 --> 00:15:34,172
I found something.

239
00:15:34,596 --> 00:15:36,596
5 ways to get back at your cheated boyfriend.
(Thai slang for ‘get back at’ that can also mean ‘cool your mouth after eating spicy food.)

240
00:15:36,596 --> 00:15:37,666
That’s a different topic!

241
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:38,768
Here’s what I found.

242
00:15:39,122 --> 00:15:41,122
Eat something sour

243
00:15:41,122 --> 00:15:44,093
because sour things are acidic which can lessen the burn.

244
00:15:44,607 --> 00:15:45,702
The lemon!

245
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:48,385
Yes! This is your job, Tee-do?

246
00:15:48,385 --> 00:15:49,368
Why me?

247
00:15:49,368 --> 00:15:50,359
It has to be you.

248
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:51,170
Trust me.

249
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:51,861
Me?

250
00:15:51,861 --> 00:15:53,064
I don’t want him to kick me out of the house.

251
00:15:53,064 --> 00:15:54,064
You’ll be fine. Do it.

252
00:15:54,064 --> 00:15:56,727
He would’ve kicked you out a long time ago if he wanted to.
You don’t have to hold him that tight. He’s not resisting.

253
00:15:56,727 --> 00:15:57,968
I’m doing this for you.

254
00:16:01,647 --> 00:16:02,501
This is vitamin C.

255
00:16:04,386 --> 00:16:05,923
I think I’m feeling better now.

256
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:06,604
You are?

257
00:16:06,604 --> 00:16:07,896
I’ve never seen Watee like this.

258
00:16:07,896 --> 00:16:10,322
Would he dare join us for a meal again?

259
00:16:10,322 --> 00:16:11,269
I don’t think so.

260
00:16:42,557 --> 00:16:43,290
Hey.

261
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,429
Is Watee still writing up his rules?

262
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:47,230
I don’t know.

263
00:16:48,101 --> 00:16:50,926
Did you get what I asked you to?

264
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:53,599
Would you like to hear good or bad news first?

265
00:16:56,396 --> 00:16:58,396
I don’t want to hear any news.

266
00:16:58,396 --> 00:16:59,421
I want to hear the truth.

267
00:16:59,421 --> 00:17:01,696
Why won’t you play along?

268
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:04,337
Fine, I’ll start with good news.

269
00:17:05,051 --> 00:17:07,051
I bought you the correct ice.

270
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:09,853
Where is it?

271
00:17:10,149 --> 00:17:11,526
The bad news is

272
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,597
it’s melted.

273
00:17:15,597 --> 00:17:19,004
I couldn’t eat your shrimp paste rice, so I stopped at a noodle place.

274
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:22,430
The weather was hot, so it’s melted.

275
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,648
T-Rex!

276
00:17:28,282 --> 00:17:29,638
I’m sorry.

277
00:17:44,883 --> 00:17:46,260
Eat the whole thing.

278
00:17:47,128 --> 00:17:49,128
I think I’m not going to make any smoothies in this house again.

279
00:17:49,812 --> 00:17:51,002
It’s just too difficult.

280
00:17:56,382 --> 00:17:57,960
Why are you afraid of good news?

281
00:18:00,322 --> 00:18:02,583
I’m not. I just don’t like it.

282
00:18:04,689 --> 00:18:05,965
Let me ask again.

283
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:08,452
Why don’t you like good news?

284
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:14,693
I don’t know.

285
00:18:15,739 --> 00:18:17,056
I guess I’m afraid of being disappointed.

286
00:18:20,243 --> 00:18:21,378
I’m just afraid that

287
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:22,812
good news

288
00:18:24,814 --> 00:18:26,311
might not actually be good news.

289
00:18:28,785 --> 00:18:30,045
Fair enough.

290
00:18:30,974 --> 00:18:31,903
See?

291
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:34,223
I look at the world realistically.

292
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:39,745
But my world says

293
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,117
you can’t be disappointed every time.

294
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:44,023
You’ll get what you want sometimes.

295
00:18:44,826 --> 00:18:48,374
Not all good news is followed by bad news.

296
00:18:55,483 --> 00:18:57,483
I think your world and mine

297
00:18:58,468 --> 00:18:59,729
are the same.

298
00:19:02,788 --> 00:19:04,788
What psychology is this?

299
00:19:05,452 --> 00:19:06,438
You don’t believe me?

300
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:13,552
Guess which hand the candy is in.

301
00:19:14,145 --> 00:19:15,166
Guess.

302
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:16,442
Left.

303
00:19:17,488 --> 00:19:18,168
Wrong.

304
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:19,385
Try again.

305
00:19:21,006 --> 00:19:22,624
Okay, which hand?

306
00:19:24,072 --> 00:19:24,897
Right.

307
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:26,752
Again.

308
00:19:27,747 --> 00:19:29,345
This time will be a little difficult.

309
00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:32,222
Which hand?

310
00:19:37,346 --> 00:19:38,119
Left.

311
00:19:40,061 --> 00:19:41,478
Correct!

312
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:44,705
See? There’s a time you guessed right.

313
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:45,420
I’m smart.

314
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,358
Otherwise I’d have just kept asking you to guess.

315
00:19:48,261 --> 00:19:49,164
No one

316
00:19:49,629 --> 00:19:51,146
gets disappointed all the time,

317
00:19:51,711 --> 00:19:53,711
but we don’t always get our way.

318
00:19:53,952 --> 00:19:54,847
We’re not God.

319
00:19:58,707 --> 00:20:02,465
I think God created us to live with hope.

320
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:06,210
Sometimes you’re disappointed, sometimes you get what you want, but so what?

321
00:20:11,508 --> 00:20:12,865
So what?

322
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,625
You're so philosophical.

323
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,058
Those were not my own words.

324
00:20:18,911 --> 00:20:19,765
Anyway,

325
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:22,243
don’t be too pessimistic.

326
00:20:26,104 --> 00:20:26,802
Okay.

327
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:30,581
Auntie Wan

328
00:20:32,129 --> 00:20:32,935
Excuse me.

329
00:20:38,686 --> 00:20:41,712
Maitee, you really had no luck.

330
00:20:41,712 --> 00:20:44,756
There were two. Anyone could guess it. I can guess it.

331
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,153
Left, right.

332
00:20:49,084 --> 00:20:50,272
Hello, Auntie Wan.

333
00:20:55,777 --> 00:20:56,611
Pardon?

334
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:07,066
Yes. I’ll be there right away.

335
00:22:26,765 --> 00:22:28,312
Even though I’m afraid of good news,

336
00:22:28,774 --> 00:22:31,179
no one in the world wants to hear bad news.

337
00:22:32,445 --> 00:22:34,445
I hope that when I open the door to my mom’s room,

338
00:22:34,445 --> 00:22:37,422
I’ll get lucky like I did with that candy.

339
00:22:43,486 --> 00:22:44,580
How’s my mom?

340
00:22:45,256 --> 00:22:47,256
The patient lost consciousness

341
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,080
but she’s better now.

342
00:22:51,785 --> 00:22:53,785
How much better do you mean by ‘better’?

343
00:22:54,074 --> 00:22:56,074
Will she recover?

344
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:59,229
I don’t want to hear ‘better’, I want to hear ‘completely recovered’.

345
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,515
What’s all the noise?

346
00:23:12,472 --> 00:23:13,610
Maitee!

347
00:23:14,196 --> 00:23:16,768
I asked you not to tell him.

348
00:23:17,548 --> 00:23:21,050
You shouldn’t keep it a secret from your son.

349
00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:22,962
It’s good that you’re here, Tee.

350
00:23:22,962 --> 00:23:25,671
I’m going to get something to eat. I haven’t eaten anything.

351
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:27,178
Of course.

352
00:23:31,391 --> 00:23:32,652
How are you?

353
00:23:32,652 --> 00:23:34,205
Living in Watee’s house.

354
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,537
Don’t worry about him.

355
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,219
Worry about yourself.

356
00:23:39,021 --> 00:23:42,308
Your next major operation has to go well.

357
00:23:43,776 --> 00:23:45,776
Whatever will be, will be.

358
00:23:45,962 --> 00:23:49,535
Good or bad, we can’t control it.

359
00:23:52,284 --> 00:23:54,195
I believe it will go well.

360
00:23:55,603 --> 00:23:57,603
Everyone wants it to go well.

361
00:24:00,016 --> 00:24:05,853
Oh, Tee. I asked you to find a photo of me wearing a beautiful, colorful outfit

362
00:24:05,853 --> 00:24:07,800
and get it framed, just in case we need it.

363
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:09,237
What will we need it for?

364
00:24:09,237 --> 00:24:13,631
Remember our neighbor’s funeral? Her outfit in the photo looked so pretty.

365
00:24:13,631 --> 00:24:15,571
I don’t want to look less pretty than her.

366
00:24:15,571 --> 00:24:17,064
Mom!

367
00:24:19,903 --> 00:24:22,435
Why do you always say negative things?

368
00:24:23,268 --> 00:24:27,199
Whether it’s negative or positive, I say the truth.

369
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,765
Sooner or later, we’ll need it.

370
00:24:30,765 --> 00:24:31,356
Not yet.

371
00:24:31,824 --> 00:24:35,135
I like yellow chrysanthemums.

372
00:24:35,135 --> 00:24:36,321
Please get them fresh.

373
00:24:36,321 --> 00:24:37,520
Stop, Mom.

374
00:24:43,511 --> 00:24:45,225
Did you forget something, Auntie Wan?

375
00:24:52,687 --> 00:24:53,757
Why are you here?

376
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:56,961
Who’s there?

377
00:24:58,902 --> 00:25:00,544
Watee.

378
00:25:00,676 --> 00:25:02,676
Huh? Watee?

379
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:04,195
Hello, Auntie Ple.

380
00:25:04,195 --> 00:25:05,486
Hi.

381
00:25:08,401 --> 00:25:09,614
How are you?

382
00:25:09,614 --> 00:25:10,159
Good.

383
00:25:11,318 --> 00:25:13,842
It’s been so long. You look so much more handsome.

384
00:25:14,494 --> 00:25:15,660
How are you, Auntie Ple?

385
00:25:16,568 --> 00:25:18,115
As good as a woman of this age can be.

386
00:25:20,413 --> 00:25:22,413
So you remember Maitee?

387
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,031
Of course, Auntie Ple.

388
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:30,909
We played together every school holiday.

389
00:25:33,418 --> 00:25:36,705
Please take care of Maitee for me.

390
00:25:43,052 --> 00:25:44,355
Sure.

391
00:25:44,849 --> 00:25:46,468
Don’t worry.

392
00:25:46,468 --> 00:25:49,115
Please take care and get well soon.

393
00:25:49,646 --> 00:25:53,124
We’ll go on a beach trip just like old times, okay?

394
00:25:54,726 --> 00:25:56,726
Okay. Do you mean it?

395
00:25:56,726 --> 00:25:57,352
Yes.

396
00:25:57,518 --> 00:26:03,235
I always ask Tee to take me to the beach in the south.

397
00:26:03,235 --> 00:26:05,883
I want to see beautiful coral reefs.

398
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:08,333
He always asks me to wait.

399
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:11,569
Now I’m like this. I can’t go anymore.

400
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:16,339
After this operation, you’ll recover,

401
00:26:17,017 --> 00:26:19,017
and I’ll take you.

402
00:26:24,114 --> 00:26:25,795
Get well soon.

403
00:26:26,272 --> 00:26:27,195
Thanks.

404
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,105
You talked to my mom about our childhood friendship story

405
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:35,667
when you actually didn’t remember me at first.

406
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,340
I have a short memory.

407
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:44,515
Clearly. You don’t remember our promise.

408
00:26:48,958 --> 00:26:50,243
Friends forever?

409
00:26:59,196 --> 00:26:59,980
Yay!

410
00:27:03,245 --> 00:27:04,195
Tee,

411
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:08,065
are you practicing to become Thailand’s marble ball game champion?

412
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:13,288
Watee won’t be here to play with you on the next school holiday.

413
00:27:13,288 --> 00:27:14,636
Why not?

414
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:17,419
Auntie Ple will send him to tutoring classes.

415
00:27:18,406 --> 00:27:20,406
You won’t have anyone to play with anymore.

416
00:27:22,925 --> 00:27:26,379
Bullfrog, you won’t be here on the next school holiday?

417
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:31,075
My mom said I have to go to tutoring classes.

418
00:27:32,148 --> 00:27:33,079
Mm.

419
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:40,625
Will we see each other again?

420
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,562
I don’t know

421
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:45,955
but if I come to Bangkok, I will come visit you.

422
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,310
Let’s make a promise.

423
00:27:52,406 --> 00:27:53,334
What?

424
00:27:53,334 --> 00:27:56,582
Let’s promise that we’ll be friends forever.

425
00:28:04,196 --> 00:28:05,475
I promise.

426
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,408
We’re adults now, Bullfrog.

427
00:28:16,408 --> 00:28:18,041
I’m shy to say things like that.

428
00:28:21,545 --> 00:28:22,847
I’m so glad.

429
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,499
I thought you forgot everything.

430
00:28:26,097 --> 00:28:27,334
I didn’t forget.

431
00:28:27,718 --> 00:28:29,718
I’m still keeping that promise.

432
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:34,898
Oh, I forgot to give this to your mom.

433
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:37,337
What is it?

434
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,284
It’s crumpled.

435
00:28:42,284 --> 00:28:43,076
Take it.

436
00:28:51,593 --> 00:28:54,070
I just drew it this morning. It’s a little rough.

437
00:28:57,741 --> 00:28:58,699
Look,

438
00:28:59,812 --> 00:29:04,887
when I told your mom we’ll go to the beach once she recovers,

439
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:06,896
I meant it.

440
00:29:15,314 --> 00:29:16,337
Thanks.

441
00:29:37,156 --> 00:29:38,179
How are you?

442
00:29:41,659 --> 00:29:43,037
Your mom is okay, right?

443
00:29:45,873 --> 00:29:47,451
You look sad. Come here.

444
00:29:48,756 --> 00:29:51,233
Guys, come to your friend.

445
00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:52,889
Give him power.

446
00:29:53,286 --> 00:29:55,286
Let’s unite our power.

447
00:29:55,286 --> 00:29:56,195
Come on.

448
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:57,219
Hang in there.

449
00:29:57,219 --> 00:29:58,613
This will pass.

450
00:29:58,613 --> 00:29:59,650
It’s okay.

451
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:00,824
Everything will get better.

452
00:30:04,407 --> 00:30:05,501
What’s this?

453
00:30:10,845 --> 00:30:12,511
Watee drew it for me.

454
00:30:15,276 --> 00:30:16,365
For your birthday?

455
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:19,235
Then why did he draw it for you?

456
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:21,747
Ask him yourselves.

457
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,940
Why the hell are you looking at me?

458
00:30:28,783 --> 00:30:30,783
Let Maitee get some rest.

459
00:30:30,783 --> 00:30:31,964
He’s tired today.

460
00:30:33,689 --> 00:30:35,260
I’m going to take a shower.

461
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,936
Get some rest.

462
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,559
Since when did Watee care about other people?

463
00:30:46,276 --> 00:30:47,394
I heard that.

464
00:30:55,656 --> 00:30:57,203
The good news is

465
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:00,250
I reunited with my friend from primary school days.

466
00:31:00,891 --> 00:31:02,891
This time, what follows is not only bad news

467
00:31:03,802 --> 00:31:05,315
but also better news

468
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,420
that he remember our promise.

469
00:31:10,276 --> 00:31:11,395
I’m in.

470
00:31:11,395 --> 00:31:12,568
Give me a second.
Come on.

471
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:15,190
Come to the middle.
Quickly.

472
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,015
There.

473
00:31:16,015 --> 00:31:17,360
Move.

474
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:20,719
Hold on.
Come on.

475
00:31:21,595 --> 00:31:22,856
Come on.

476
00:31:24,195 --> 00:31:25,075
Guys.

477
00:31:25,698 --> 00:31:27,007
Is T-Rex still not back?

478
00:31:27,484 --> 00:31:29,517
He went to his hometown.

479
00:31:29,517 --> 00:31:30,851
He went to his hometown.

480
00:31:33,026 --> 00:31:34,954
Go, go.
Ready?

481
00:31:34,954 --> 00:31:36,851
Come on.
Middle.

482
00:32:03,538 --> 00:32:04,799
Hello, T-Rex’s father.

483
00:32:07,612 --> 00:32:08,686
Watee.

484
00:32:10,831 --> 00:32:12,402
I didn’t bring my father here.

485
00:32:15,154 --> 00:32:16,248
What are you talking about?

486
00:32:16,861 --> 00:32:18,337
I brought your father here.

487
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:32,916
Directed by Nuttapong Mongkolsawas

488
00:32:35,979 --> 00:32:41,507
I read that if you put your tongue out and let 3 drops of saliva fall, you’ll stop feeling the burn.

489
00:32:41,507 --> 00:32:43,153
No. That’s disgusting.

490
00:32:43,153 --> 00:32:44,198
Do it.

491
00:32:44,198 --> 00:32:45,119
Come on.

492
00:32:49,905 --> 00:32:51,214
Anything out yet?
More.

493
00:32:51,214 --> 00:32:53,028
Eww!

494
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:57,795
That’s 3 drops.
Are you feeling better now?

495
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,374
But you have to know the truth.

496
00:33:00,156 --> 00:33:01,393
Isn’t this the truth?

497
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,505
T-Rex meant well

498
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,630
but look what he did.

499
00:33:07,373 --> 00:33:09,373
Pack up your things tonight.

500
00:33:09,373 --> 00:33:11,519
I want you all gone before I go to bed.

501
00:33:14,275 --> 00:33:15,395
Who’s there?

502
00:33:15,395 --> 00:33:16,599
Teedet?

503
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:17,738
Ouch!
