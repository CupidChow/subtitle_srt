1
00:00:00,161 --> 00:00:02,768
I just didn't think your excuse to break up could be this bullshit.

2
00:00:03,473 --> 00:00:05,036
Me chewing loudly?

3
00:00:07,035 --> 00:00:08,355
What the fuck is wrong with you?

4
00:00:08,377 --> 00:00:10,377
I told you to stop chewing. Why wouldn’t you?

5
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:11,757
Do you have a fucking problem with me?

6
00:00:11,757 --> 00:00:13,757
I’ll wear my earphones if you want me to eat here.

7
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:15,934
Seriously?

8
00:00:15,934 --> 00:00:17,934
I asked, who are you texting?

9
00:00:17,991 --> 00:00:19,991
I started talking to this girl after I broke up with Ink.

10
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:24,854
Earphones are my 33th organ.

11
00:00:25,265 --> 00:00:28,455
Not because I’m crazy about listening to music as a musician,

12
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:33,450
but because I’m used to controlling the things I’m about to hear.

13
00:00:39,636 --> 00:00:40,689
Tee-Do!

14
00:00:42,074 --> 00:00:43,685
Open the door!

15
00:00:44,737 --> 00:00:46,081
Tee-Do!

16
00:00:46,694 --> 00:00:47,479
Hey!

17
00:00:51,436 --> 00:00:52,707
Hey!

18
00:00:53,597 --> 00:00:54,698
Tee-Do!

19
00:00:54,862 --> 00:00:57,809
What would you like me to cook for you?

20
00:01:20,696 --> 00:01:23,133
No one wants to hear what they don’t want to hear.

21
00:01:23,134 --> 00:01:26,324
But sometimes it can’t be avoided.

22
00:01:26,425 --> 00:01:29,421
My life is full of things I don’t want to hear.

23
00:01:32,362 --> 00:01:33,803
Let’s try one more time.

24
00:01:34,796 --> 00:01:36,626
Did you understand the lesson, N’Tee?

25
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:38,322
Let’s practice.

26
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:44,454
I’ve always believed that if someone is brave enough to tell you something, you should listen to them.

27
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,854
But what if what comes out of their mouth is not speaking voice?

28
00:02:05,807 --> 00:02:07,807
Ouch! Tee!

29
00:02:07,807 --> 00:02:09,443
Are you alright?

30
00:02:09,443 --> 00:02:11,443
Why did you punch your friend, N’Tee?

31
00:02:11,452 --> 00:02:15,128
That kind of voice calls for the devil inside me.

32
00:02:15,987 --> 00:02:20,246
It makes my life, including my love life, harder.

33
00:02:23,336 --> 00:02:24,802
Why don’t you eat candy instead?

34
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:25,755
Okay.

35
00:02:33,178 --> 00:02:40,255
I’ve tried, but I’ve never been able to finish a movie hearing any kind of chewing sound.

36
00:02:44,953 --> 00:02:45,884
I’m sorry.

37
00:02:47,892 --> 00:02:49,892
Euang! Euang!

38
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:57,483
Hold on.

39
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,245
Why are you breathing so loudly?

40
00:02:59,315 --> 00:03:00,246
Do you have asthma?

41
00:03:02,578 --> 00:03:04,014
How did I do?

42
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:06,141
Alright, but there was too much saliva.

43
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:07,339
I don’t think so.

44
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,340
I could feature you when you play the cello.

45
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:15,773
Maybe you could change the genre.

46
00:03:15,773 --> 00:03:16,826
No, no.

47
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:20,654
$%)$(%$%

48
00:03:21,162 --> 00:03:22,254
Hey!

49
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:34,496
My new love is about to blossom.

50
00:03:39,332 --> 00:03:41,915
Thanks for letting me borrow your cello bow.

51
00:03:41,915 --> 00:03:42,753
Hey!

52
00:03:43,326 --> 00:03:45,326
You’re welcome. Hehe.

53
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:46,872
Hehe?

54
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,177
New girl?

55
00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:51,047
Does this one chew loudly?

56
00:03:51,193 --> 00:03:52,888
Chomp chomp.

57
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:54,881
I don’t know.

58
00:03:55,456 --> 00:03:57,262
I don’t dare ask her out.

59
00:03:57,464 --> 00:03:59,610
The earphones that match my dating outfits are broken.

60
00:04:00,985 --> 00:04:04,175
I’m scared I’ll flip out if I hear her chew.

61
00:04:06,365 --> 00:04:09,240
We can help you dine with her without wearing your earphones

62
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,657
but you have to bring her here.

63
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:17,779
What if Watee finds out?

64
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:20,167
His birthday quota is up.

65
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:22,859
We can get everything done before he’s back.

66
00:04:28,962 --> 00:04:30,014
Do we really want to do it?

67
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:38,403
I have nothing to do with this.

68
00:04:38,422 --> 00:04:39,159
I’ll cook.

69
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:44,286
Today I’ll survive without this organ of mine.

70
00:04:45,225 --> 00:04:47,225
Come to my house tomorrow.

71
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,458
I can’t see them.

72
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:14,083
You have to watch from here.

73
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,319
Move a little left.

74
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,847
Are you alright, Teedet?

75
00:06:24,847 --> 00:06:26,720
I’m fine. No symptoms.

76
00:06:29,746 --> 00:06:31,746
I thought this was going to be a simple meal.

77
00:06:32,428 --> 00:06:34,088
My friends helped me prepare it.

78
00:06:36,148 --> 00:06:37,454
Where are your friends?

79
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,509
Did you make the sauce yourself?

80
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:44,509
Yes. I made everything myself.

81
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:46,072
Looks yummy.
Smells so good.

82
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:48,474
Guys, this is Soundlab.

83
00:06:49,003 --> 00:06:51,003
Hi.

84
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:54,001
What’s your name again? Chao Rap?

85
00:06:55,904 --> 00:06:57,904
It’s Soundlab.

86
00:06:57,904 --> 00:06:59,783
Oh, Soundlab.

87
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:01,784
Okay. Enjoy your dinner.

88
00:07:03,752 --> 00:07:04,683
Shall we?

89
00:07:18,235 --> 00:07:20,235
You shouldn’t have prepared all this for me.

90
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:24,086
I’m actually a mainstream girl. I can eat anything.

91
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:25,649
It’s no problem at all.

92
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:27,047
One of my friends is a good cook.

93
00:07:27,048 --> 00:07:29,656
He makes the best beef mignon, soufflé,

94
00:07:29,656 --> 00:07:32,174
ratatouille, etc.

95
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:33,821
I want you to try his food.

96
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:38,015
I’m scared to open it.

97
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:40,016
It must be too fancy for me.

98
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,494
Just try. You’ll love it.

99
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:44,014
Then I’ll open it now.

100
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,883
Congee?

101
00:07:51,394 --> 00:07:57,232
I think it’s abalone or shark fin congee.

102
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:58,180
It’s minced pork.

103
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:58,914
Minced pork?

104
00:08:00,903 --> 00:08:06,574
Yes. I wanted our first date to be simple.

105
00:08:07,735 --> 00:08:09,541
Don’t look at me.

106
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,541
I knocked on his door but he didn’t answer.

107
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:15,960
Plus, I could only think of congee as something people won’t chew loudly.

108
00:08:16,648 --> 00:08:19,887
You weren’t thinking of my light decorations.

109
00:08:21,516 --> 00:08:23,516
Have you ever made this sound while eating congee?

110
00:08:24,974 --> 00:08:26,974
I think she has more manners than that.

111
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:28,437
Did you just insult him?

112
00:08:28,983 --> 00:08:30,376
It’s just a statement.

113
00:08:32,073 --> 00:08:35,725
I forgot to tell you that I don’t eat meat.

114
00:08:36,255 --> 00:08:37,134
Oh?

115
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:40,200
It’s okay. I can pick only what I eat.

116
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:41,934
Are you sure?

117
00:08:42,452 --> 00:08:43,694
No worries at all.

118
00:08:45,231 --> 00:08:46,818
I brought my own food.

119
00:08:48,016 --> 00:08:48,814
What’s that?

120
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:57,014
Fried vegetables.

121
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:57,818
Shit!

122
00:08:59,032 --> 00:09:00,174
Are they crispy?

123
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,700
Shit is happening.

124
00:09:09,094 --> 00:09:10,147
Game over.

125
00:09:11,614 --> 00:09:13,614
This is going to end in a mess.

126
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,294
RIP.

127
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:23,388
He’s going to flip out.

128
00:09:23,388 --> 00:09:24,494
What do we do?

129
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:34,793
Stop chewing right now!

130
00:09:34,864 --> 00:09:36,159
What’s wrong?

131
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,036
Why did you have to fry your vegetables?

132
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,578
Are you crazy?

133
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:42,560
I wanted to eat them fried and I didn’t fry them on your head!

134
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,224
You cause noise pollution.

135
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:45,925
They’re just crispy!

136
00:09:45,925 --> 00:09:46,936
Stop eating!

137
00:09:52,447 --> 00:09:55,014
P’Tee! P’Tee!

138
00:09:55,892 --> 00:09:56,653
Yes?

139
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,734
Shall we eat?

140
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:00,782
Let’s.

141
00:10:12,462 --> 00:10:14,122
I turned this on for the first time for him.

142
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,594
Bark, Jack.

143
00:10:35,693 --> 00:10:36,916
So crispy.

144
00:10:38,002 --> 00:10:39,054
Yeah.

145
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:40,060
You want some?

146
00:10:40,455 --> 00:10:42,091
I like them wilted. Sorry.

147
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:42,610
Oh.

148
00:10:42,907 --> 00:10:44,907
Bark quickly. Open your mouth.

149
00:10:44,907 --> 00:10:45,407
Come on.

150
00:10:49,573 --> 00:10:50,626
That must've felt good.

151
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,435
My ass is all wet.

152
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:07,066
No smell, right?

153
00:11:07,608 --> 00:11:08,466
Come on, Jack!

154
00:11:11,652 --> 00:11:12,494
Yummy?

155
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:14,696
It's good, right?

156
00:11:20,326 --> 00:11:21,403
It's noisy.

157
00:11:21,403 --> 00:11:22,261
Come again?

158
00:11:22,756 --> 00:11:23,760
It's noisy.

159
00:11:24,024 --> 00:11:25,101
I didn't hear you.

160
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:26,790
It's noisy!

161
00:11:27,246 --> 00:11:28,493
I heard you.

162
00:11:28,493 --> 00:11:29,471
Yes, it's quite noisy.

163
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:30,645
Yes, it is.

164
00:11:30,806 --> 00:11:31,567
You're okay?

165
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:32,321
Yeah.

166
00:11:33,573 --> 00:11:39,411
Thanks to the sound of the blender, the barking and the farting from my friends.

167
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:43,831
They make me feel better than hearing the person in front of me chew fried vegetables.

168
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:51,573
Guys.

169
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:53,432
My blender stopped working.

170
00:11:54,064 --> 00:11:56,623
May I use the bathroom?

171
00:11:56,623 --> 00:11:57,411
Sure.

172
00:11:57,647 --> 00:11:59,161
No, I'm fine.

173
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,507
You should eat.

174
00:12:00,507 --> 00:12:01,935
You haven't eaten at all.

175
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:03,609
Alright.

176
00:12:04,698 --> 00:12:05,823
I'll do that.

177
00:12:05,823 --> 00:12:06,528
Please.

178
00:12:18,202 --> 00:12:20,736
Hi. Do you guys want to join us?

179
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,825
No, thank you. We're here to give our friend support.

180
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:26,876
But we're just eating.

181
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,399
We're talking about that one.

182
00:12:37,585 --> 00:12:38,200
Oh.

183
00:12:45,587 --> 00:12:47,028
Do you think she suspects anything?

184
00:12:49,297 --> 00:12:50,204
Have a seat.

185
00:12:51,694 --> 00:12:52,868
Are you full?

186
00:12:53,486 --> 00:12:54,345
Yeah.

187
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:00,529
Do you really have to mow the grass now?

188
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:03,214
What did you say?

189
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:06,006
Do you really have to mow the grass now?

190
00:13:06,006 --> 00:13:08,006
It's my turn on the schedule.

191
00:13:08,124 --> 00:13:10,124
Right.

192
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:14,429
We take turns doing it.

193
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:18,161
My father is visiting from another city

194
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:19,083
He brought us some fruits.

195
00:13:19,454 --> 00:13:21,454
I didn't kick him out because he's your father.

196
00:13:57,038 --> 00:14:00,502
See, Tee-Do? You managed to dine with her without your earphones.

197
00:14:01,213 --> 00:14:03,547
Next time, you'll be able to do so much more.

198
00:14:03,865 --> 00:14:05,865
Let me focus on surviving the meals first.

199
00:14:07,643 --> 00:14:08,810
Thanks a lot, guys.

200
00:14:10,312 --> 00:14:13,505
Dining with girls without my earphones - Check

201
00:14:14,162 --> 00:14:16,162
You should invite her to our place again.

202
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,544
What do you mean?

203
00:14:18,853 --> 00:14:19,867
Who are you inviting?

204
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:24,361
Oh,

205
00:14:27,342 --> 00:14:29,972
I want to go to the Rear Palace.

206
00:14:29,973 --> 00:14:31,539
Tee-Do goes there a lot.

207
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:33,539
I want him to take me.

208
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,730
I read on the internet

209
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:36,847
that there's an alley where cool guys wear jeans.

210
00:14:37,212 --> 00:14:39,212
There is a famous fried pork place.

211
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:40,786
And I'll buy you sushi from Orathai's.

212
00:14:40,786 --> 00:14:41,787
Price starts from 5 baht.

213
00:14:41,787 --> 00:14:42,805
Super yummy.

214
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:43,413
We should resell it.

215
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:45,413
Tai Orathai. (Singer's name)

216
00:14:45,414 --> 00:14:46,581
No, they're not the same person.

217
00:14:47,444 --> 00:14:49,444
The area is close to a few temples.

218
00:14:49,444 --> 00:14:50,431
Excuse me.

219
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,627
Hello, Dad.

220
00:14:57,995 --> 00:14:59,995
This way, Dad. Come.

221
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:04,144
Thank god GPS led me to the right place. I almost got lost.

222
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:05,780
Hey.

223
00:15:06,028 --> 00:15:08,794
My father is visiting from another city.

224
00:15:08,794 --> 00:15:09,889
He brought us some fruits.

225
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,827
Dad, this is Watee. He's the owner of this house.

226
00:15:13,499 --> 00:15:14,531
Watee.

227
00:15:14,531 --> 00:15:15,450
Hello.

228
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:19,387
Is he the one who shares the same name as you, Tee-Lek?

229
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:21,931
My name is T-Rex, not Tee-Lek.

230
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:25,935
Where are you from?

231
00:15:26,264 --> 00:15:28,939
Are you from Ratchaburi? I wonder if we're related.

232
00:15:29,694 --> 00:15:31,064
I've lived here since I was born.

233
00:15:31,228 --> 00:15:32,305
Ah.

234
00:15:32,636 --> 00:15:33,825
What a beautiful house.

235
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:35,651
It's so nice and shady.

236
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:39,309
That tree must be 20 years old.

237
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:41,594
I like to plant that tree as well.

238
00:15:42,727 --> 00:15:43,669
Right.

239
00:15:46,754 --> 00:15:47,831
Is he alright?

240
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,752
He's fine.

241
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,224
He rarely talks but today he talked to you a lot.

242
00:15:52,224 --> 00:15:53,031
Really?

243
00:15:53,031 --> 00:15:53,531
Yeah.

244
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:55,951
Come in.

245
00:15:58,109 --> 00:15:59,591
I'll wash these for you.

246
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:00,961
That’d be great.

247
00:16:04,706 --> 00:16:05,603
Is he gone?

248
00:16:06,902 --> 00:16:08,902
My dad?
He left already.

249
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:12,278
I didn't kick him out because he's your father.

250
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,333
But don't bring strangers into this house again.

251
00:16:17,781 --> 00:16:19,556
My dad’s visiting from his hometown.

252
00:16:19,556 --> 00:16:20,992
You wouldn’t let him come see me?

253
00:16:20,992 --> 00:16:22,744
My house is neither a prison nor a hospital.

254
00:16:22,987 --> 00:16:24,109
No visitors are allowed.

255
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,194
Hey.

256
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:29,324
Wasn't that too harsh?

257
00:16:29,835 --> 00:16:31,835
His father is not a stranger.

258
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:35,647
Apart from the clattering noise from people’s mouth and the sound of chewing,

259
00:16:35,647 --> 00:16:39,178
another kind of human sound I don't like is the sound of arguing.

260
00:16:44,347 --> 00:16:48,937
T-Rex, Watee must really feel uncomfortable around strangers.

261
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,413
He respected you by not kicking your father out.

262
00:16:52,988 --> 00:16:54,988
He just wanted to warn you about next time.

263
00:17:00,397 --> 00:17:07,485
Watee, T-Rex thought by 'strangers' you mean friends, partners, and other acquaintances.

264
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:09,486
He didn't realize that includes family.

265
00:17:16,257 --> 00:17:17,221
I'm sorry.

266
00:17:18,453 --> 00:17:20,453
I won't bring him here again.

267
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:26,581
I hope that everything I said would prevent some arguments in the future.

268
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,873
P'Tee, do you want to go to the movies tomorrow?

269
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:09,868
Who's at the mall on the main road near our house?

270
00:18:09,868 --> 00:18:12,285
Cinema 8, 5:00 pm show time. Come quickly.

271
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:33,627
Excuse me. What are you laughing about?

272
00:18:33,932 --> 00:18:35,067
This is a horror film.

273
00:18:35,462 --> 00:18:39,067
I always laugh when I'm scared.

274
00:18:39,696 --> 00:18:41,696
He always does that.

275
00:18:52,636 --> 00:18:53,465
Dude.

276
00:18:54,197 --> 00:18:55,499
I smell something bad.

277
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,689
Do you?

278
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:57,804
It's butter.

279
00:18:59,668 --> 00:19:00,970
I'm allergic to the smell of butter.

280
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:02,971
It's the popcorn.

281
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:07,475
Look, I got rashes all over.

282
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:10,348
What do we do?

283
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,480
Should we go to the hospital?

284
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,480
I'm not eating this anymore. I'm full.

285
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,375
Good for you. It can make you fat.

286
00:19:23,948 --> 00:19:25,250
I almost died.

287
00:19:42,844 --> 00:19:45,467
It's so hard for them to finally end up together.

288
00:19:47,324 --> 00:19:52,341
What's love without obstacles? It would be too mainstream and not as fun.

289
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:58,107
But if Ethan wasn't a ghost, Laura might have fallen in love with him from the start.

290
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:02,329
Maybe Laura loves Ethan as a ghost.

291
00:20:02,782 --> 00:20:03,656
Who knows?

292
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,420
Eww!

293
00:20:10,317 --> 00:20:12,317
Ethan loves Laura.

294
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,370
Laura loves Ethan, too.

295
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:24,794
This is probably the first time in years that I remember the names of the protagonists from a movie I'm watching with a girl.

296
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:26,987
Watching a movie with a girl I like - Check

297
00:20:29,652 --> 00:20:31,652
It's midnight. Happy Birthday.

298
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,728
Thank you.

299
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:42,066
Was I the first to wish you a happy birthday?

300
00:20:44,589 --> 00:20:49,147
You're so mainstream, but it's okay. I like mainstream.

301
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:51,529
See you tomorrow. I'll pick you up.

302
00:20:53,729 --> 00:20:58,107
Everything seems to be going well until the next morning comes.

303
00:20:58,107 --> 00:20:59,438
We should stop talking.

304
00:21:11,693 --> 00:21:13,693
No one's chewing next to him.

305
00:21:14,211 --> 00:21:15,707
Why is he wearing headphones?

306
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:18,035
No idea.

307
00:21:27,474 --> 00:21:29,024
Good weather today.

308
00:21:42,492 --> 00:21:43,726
What's wrong?

309
00:21:45,224 --> 00:21:46,907
Am I that scary?

310
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:53,574
No, except when you turn into a hulk and destroy a pot plant.

311
00:21:55,323 --> 00:21:56,017
Oops.

312
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,230
I want to be normal like other people.

313
00:22:03,338 --> 00:22:04,595
What's wrong with you?

314
00:22:06,888 --> 00:22:08,888
Shit!

315
00:22:12,017 --> 00:22:12,987
Shit!

316
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:21,858
What do I do?

317
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:34,586
Hey, you.

318
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:36,121
What?

319
00:22:36,324 --> 00:22:38,324
My mom told me not to talk to strangers.

320
00:22:38,687 --> 00:22:39,967
I'll treat you to ice cream.

321
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,767
Okay.

322
00:22:44,767 --> 00:22:46,649
Eat them next to my ear.

323
00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:48,649
Be as loud as possible. I want people on the main road to hear you.

324
00:22:55,387 --> 00:22:57,787
Fatty, who taught you to eat that loudly?

325
00:22:59,418 --> 00:23:01,418
Eating two sticks isn’t going to help you lose fat.

326
00:23:02,489 --> 00:23:04,489
Do you know you should eat some vegetables in every meal?

327
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,242
P'Tee.

328
00:23:06,908 --> 00:23:08,503
Why the hell are you here so early?

329
00:23:10,167 --> 00:23:11,784
What's wrong with you, P'Tee?

330
00:23:11,784 --> 00:23:12,667
Why did you call my name?

331
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:13,888
You’re afraid I'll forget my own name?

332
00:23:14,612 --> 00:23:16,612
My name is Teeee.

333
00:23:17,636 --> 00:23:19,073
You're not going to stop?

334
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,635
Thank you so much.

335
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,947
I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

336
00:23:42,386 --> 00:23:44,071
Clearly you did.

337
00:23:45,325 --> 00:23:46,605
I can treat you to another one.

338
00:23:46,647 --> 00:23:48,647
No, thank you.

339
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:49,773
I don't want it.

340
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:52,142
I actually think you're cute.

341
00:23:52,142 --> 00:23:53,961
I was a chubby kid too.

342
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,712
You're adorably chubby.

343
00:23:57,987 --> 00:23:59,019
Go home to your mom.

344
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:08,907
No!

345
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:10,983
Soundlab!

346
00:24:10,984 --> 00:24:12,804
And she said in her status that

347
00:24:12,804 --> 00:24:15,817
"Guys who are rude to children and girls are not gentlemen."

348
00:24:18,104 --> 00:24:20,104
Can you choose what you're afraid of?

349
00:24:22,604 --> 00:24:24,604
I don't want to be afraid of beautiful women either.

350
00:24:26,817 --> 00:24:28,547
Doesn't everyone like them?

351
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,467
Yeah.

352
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,854
Honestly,

353
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:36,869
I just want to be able to eat like normal people.

354
00:24:38,046 --> 00:24:40,046
I've always eaten alone.

355
00:24:41,616 --> 00:24:42,805
It’s lonely.

356
00:24:44,889 --> 00:24:45,718
I feel you.

357
00:24:47,095 --> 00:24:48,892
Why didn't you tell me?

358
00:24:55,163 --> 00:25:00,347
I used to think that if I loved someone enough, love would help me overcome my fear.

359
00:25:00,864 --> 00:25:02,864
Maybe you don't love me enough.

360
00:25:36,491 --> 00:25:37,259
What's wrong?

361
00:25:38,345 --> 00:25:39,426
Why didn't you tell me?

362
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,041
I came to return the cello bow.

363
00:26:03,476 --> 00:26:04,540
So I guess

364
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:07,208
this is why you made me eat congee the other day.

365
00:26:11,522 --> 00:26:12,394
I'm sorry.

366
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:20,258
I used to think that if I loved someone enough,

367
00:26:22,216 --> 00:26:24,216
love would help me overcome my fear.

368
00:26:27,465 --> 00:26:29,465
I guess it can't help me.

369
00:26:32,876 --> 00:26:34,876
Maybe you don't love me enough.

370
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:47,731
Let’s find out.

371
00:26:52,635 --> 00:26:53,340
Hey!

372
00:26:53,902 --> 00:26:54,545
I'm going to start now.

373
00:26:54,852 --> 00:26:55,599
Okay.

374
00:26:55,886 --> 00:26:56,386
1,

375
00:26:56,774 --> 00:26:57,635
2,

376
00:26:58,449 --> 00:26:58,966
3

377
00:27:02,468 --> 00:27:03,507
Soundlab, wants the best for me.

378
00:27:07,515 --> 00:27:08,930
Soundlab wants to help me.

379
00:27:09,115 --> 00:27:12,974
Soundlab wants me to get rid of this sickness.

380
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,635
No one can help me!

381
00:27:21,362 --> 00:27:22,359
Are you alright?

382
00:27:23,127 --> 00:27:23,748
Yes.

383
00:27:25,164 --> 00:27:25,869
Let's continue.

384
00:27:26,323 --> 00:27:27,112
Keep chewing.

385
00:27:28,867 --> 00:27:29,676
You're not alright.

386
00:27:30,146 --> 00:27:31,081
No, I won't.

387
00:27:38,315 --> 00:27:41,610
I can't let you be the only one trying to put up with the sound you hate for me.

388
00:27:42,636 --> 00:27:44,636
I have to avoid making the sound you hate too.

389
00:28:03,113 --> 00:28:07,954
How about I invent a recipe for non-crispy popcorns in my next lab class?

390
00:28:08,735 --> 00:28:09,461
Softcorns?

391
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:17,067
But first, let's clear these up.

392
00:28:17,307 --> 00:28:19,307
We don't want Watee to kill us when he gets back.

393
00:28:30,301 --> 00:28:30,801
Soundlab.

394
00:28:32,636 --> 00:28:33,738
Have you been waiting long?

395
00:28:33,926 --> 00:28:35,069
Sorry.

396
00:28:35,194 --> 00:28:36,442
Mmm...

397
00:28:37,138 --> 00:28:38,407
It's okay.

398
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,840
Let's go eat some...

399
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,552
ice cream.

400
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:45,463
Ice cream?

401
00:28:48,162 --> 00:28:49,577
Alright, we won't be making any sound.

402
00:28:54,548 --> 00:28:55,515
Here.

403
00:28:57,636 --> 00:28:59,636
This is what I dropped in the drain the other day.

404
00:29:09,045 --> 00:29:12,256
Wow. It's a cello bow

405
00:29:13,864 --> 00:29:15,551
with my name on it.

406
00:29:18,303 --> 00:29:20,031
You won't have to borrow mine anymore.

407
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:23,514
How mainstream.

408
00:29:24,323 --> 00:29:25,425
Of course.

409
00:29:26,324 --> 00:29:28,324
There's more.

410
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:30,824
What else?

411
00:29:35,444 --> 00:29:36,421
Here.

412
00:29:43,052 --> 00:29:44,760
Happy Birthday.

413
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,433
These are our first movie tickets together.

414
00:29:55,285 --> 00:30:01,003
And these are lifetime free coupons for air popcorns.

415
00:30:04,397 --> 00:30:05,708
Cute.

416
00:30:05,708 --> 00:30:06,593
Isn't it cool?

417
00:30:06,593 --> 00:30:07,257
Yes.

418
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:11,355
I'm going to use one of these now.

419
00:30:11,355 --> 00:30:12,591
Now?

420
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:15,090
Don't you want to wait until we're at the cinema?

421
00:30:15,621 --> 00:30:16,315
I'd rather use it now.

422
00:30:17,632 --> 00:30:18,358
Okay.

423
00:30:20,023 --> 00:30:20,707
It's there already?

424
00:30:27,514 --> 00:30:28,177
I'm perfectly fine.

425
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:31,927
Won't you share it with me?

426
00:30:32,636 --> 00:30:33,341
You want some?

427
00:30:40,702 --> 00:30:41,303
Sweet.

428
00:30:42,989 --> 00:30:43,590
Yummy?

429
00:30:45,765 --> 00:30:46,804
Do you feel like it's stuck in your throat?

430
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,930
Yeah. I ate too much popcorn. My throat is dry.

431
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:50,969
I prepared for that.

432
00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:57,908
Oh.

433
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:00,099
Here.

434
00:31:01,917 --> 00:31:02,635
It'll make you feel refreshed.

435
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:06,551
Don't worry. I have one for myself.

436
00:31:12,636 --> 00:31:13,529
But P'Tee,

437
00:31:14,385 --> 00:31:16,385
doesn't this require chewing?

438
00:31:17,636 --> 00:31:19,636
Will you be alright?

439
00:31:25,998 --> 00:31:27,635
Let's try it together.

440
00:31:28,849 --> 00:31:29,429
Are you sure?

441
00:31:30,329 --> 00:31:31,013
Let's do it.

442
00:31:55,101 --> 00:31:58,584
I don't know if this love could help me overcome my fear.

443
00:31:59,582 --> 00:32:05,050
But at least there's someone right in front of me who's willing to go on that journey with me.

444
00:32:18,781 --> 00:32:20,781
Kissing my sweetheart - Check

445
00:32:44,068 --> 00:32:46,068
Teedet! Teedet! Teedet! Teedet!

446
00:32:49,297 --> 00:32:51,297
Shorty! Help me! Shorty!

447
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:56,780
Shorty, wake up! Shorty!

448
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,275
I saw a shadow. Shorty.

449
00:33:04,944 --> 00:33:05,921
Are you dreaming?

450
00:33:08,023 --> 00:33:10,023
Let’s go check outside if you don't believe me.

451

Directed by Nuttapong Mongkolsawas

452
00:33:15,752 --> 00:33:16,353
Apples.

453
00:33:16,598 --> 00:33:17,595
Crispy or soft?

454
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:18,989
Crispy, of course.

455
00:33:19,741 --> 00:33:20,864
They're eating so much.

456
00:33:47,516 --> 00:33:48,346
I'll be back late tonight.

457
00:33:48,347 --> 00:33:49,755
My father is in town.

458
00:33:49,965 --> 00:33:51,840
I have concerto rehearsal at uni.

459
00:33:51,966 --> 00:33:53,298
I might sleep there tonight if I finish late.

460
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:55,863
No! I can't sleep alone!

461
00:33:55,863 --> 00:33:58,912
Your fear of ghosts has become everyone's problem.

462
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,898
Get packing and leave this house.
