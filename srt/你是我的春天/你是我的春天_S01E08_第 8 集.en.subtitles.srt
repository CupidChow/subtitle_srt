1
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,206
I…

2
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,459
knew the reason

3
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:53,047
for your tears and your embrace.

4
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,176
"I felt so bad for you

5
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,430
that I couldn't just leave you behind."

6
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,979
That night, you embraced

7
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,816
the 11-year-old me
who had lost his brother,

8
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,987
the 26-year-old me
who had lost his patient,

9
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,782
and the foolish me who dared

10
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:25,622
to lose you
because I was scared to hurt you.

11
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,068
EPISODE 8

12
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,305
Your fever's gone.

13
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,437
What's wrong with you?

14
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,940
Just stay still.

15
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,780
Embracing and warming someone's body

16
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,907
with your temperature

17
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,827
is a more sincere act of affection
than mere words.

18
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,704
Honey!

19
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,376
It means, "I've missed you so much."

20
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,588
"What took you so long?"

21
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,514
"I was so worried about you."

22
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:18,026
"I was lonely without you."

23
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,867
"I almost went crazy pining for you."

24
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,380
"I'm sorry."

25
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,925
"It's okay."

26
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,385
"Thank you."

27
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,335
-Here's your pizza.
-Thank you. It's still hot.

28
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,171
What? You came to pick it up?

29
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,424
-I could've delivered it.
-I'm only a stone's throw away.

30
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:09,137
What a pretty helmet. Was it a gift?

31
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,597
I'm not sure who gave this to me.

32
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,684
I'm a bit frustrated because I don't know.

33
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,770
-What are you on about?
-Bye.

34
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,316
Is he my daughter's boyfriend

35
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,985
or her guy friend

36
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,612
or just a guy passing by her?

37
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,289
Do you like the new pizza?

38
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,957
-Yes, it's good.
-Yes, it's tasty.

39
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,333
Eat up.

40
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,543
-Okay.
-Okay.

41
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,212
-Have you eaten?
-Yes, every now and then.

42
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,797
When did you last see Da-jeong?

43
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,424
It's been a while.

44
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,468
Why are you panting?

45
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,678
What are you doing in broad daylight?

46
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,807
I'm working out.

47
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,727
Did you see Young-do?

48
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,437
Who's that?

49
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,189
Didn't you see Da-jeong's neighbor?

50
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,733
I don't even know my own neighbor.

51
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,817
What's this about?

52
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,570
I'm just in a dilemma. That's all.

53
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,071
Can I keep liking him

54
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,866
or should I bury him?
Will he marry my daughter

55
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,784
or should I kill him?

56
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:14,785
Mom.

57
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,955
Has Da-jeong told you about John Wick?

58
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,624
He sounds American.

59
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,042
It's an American movie.

60
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,378
He kills about 80 people
to avenge his dog's death.

61
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,881
Sounds plausible.

62
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,467
She said that movie reminded her of you.

63
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,178
Is that so? She thought of me?

64
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,095
Gosh.

65
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,264
That wasn't a compliment.

66
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,058
You should visit her.

67
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,893
Or invite her to your bar.

68
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,728
We're not that close.

69
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,730
Then should I go instead?

70
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,941
How about I wear a pair of fishnets

71
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,318
and a sparkling, silver skirt?

72
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:50,279
Mother, I'll take care of it right away.

73
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,740
Was his name Young-do?

74
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,625
Cheol-do, hello.

75
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,877
Hey, it's been a while.

76
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,214
-Have you been coming here?
-Yes, usually at dawn.

77
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,259
Have you seen my sister lately?

78
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,511
-Yes.
-Is she doing okay?

79
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,595
I think so.

80
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,350
I spoke with Eun-ha yesterday.

81
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,186
Really? Is she doing all right?

82
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,229
Yes.

83
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,898
Don't you run a cafe together?

84
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,483
We do.

85
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,527
But we don't talk.

86
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,446
I see.

87
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,158
I'm sure it was Ms. Kang.

88
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,618
I was going to the parking lot

89
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,663
when she was headed to the playground.
I was going to call her.

90
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,098
Young-do, are you asleep?

91
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,101
Ms. Kang stopped by.

92
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:05,646
There was a bowl of porridge,
but he only ate one spoonful.

93
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,939
Okay.

94
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,150
And we're talking about Mr. Flirt.

95
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,027
-Right.
-So?

96
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:18,117
He purposely smeared some porridge
on his lips.

97
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,118
What's wrong?

98
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,247
Were you always this pretty?

99
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,760
How long must I

100
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:40,222
This damn love

101
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,892
That porridge on his lips
must've made them kiss.

102
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,478
Gosh. You have such a poor imagination.

103
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,772
No wonder your shows have low ratings.

104
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,106
What about my ratings?

105
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,650
They're low and cute ratings.

106
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,901
Gosh.

107
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,028
You know what I think?

108
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,699
I bet they bawled their eyes out.

109
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,497
Don't be sick.

110
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,708
I'm sorry for being sick.

111
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,713
Don't apologize, you fool.

112
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,634
Don't cry, you fool.

113
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,721
Doesn't it hurt?

114
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,561
Cut that nonsense

115
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,563
It's much better than yours.

116
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,232
I know exactly what happened.

117
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,861
I saw a preview
in the storage room last time.

118
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,188
I like that. Let's go with it.

119
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,941
But…

120
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,820
Da-jeong went all the way there
to give him some porridge.

121
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,572
He didn't eat it and she left.

122
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,866
Maybe things didn't work out.

123
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,076
Or maybe he suggested
that they be friends.

124
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,127
I'd rather it be the porridge kiss.

125
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,796
You think he pushed her away?

126
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:37,965
I think so.

127
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,844
Gosh. His feelings for a woman
were never this strong.

128
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,221
Do something about it.

129
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,222
Like what?

130
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,184
Protest in front of her and demand
that she doesn't let him go.

131
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,978
Or throw them in a dark room
and lock the door.

132
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,105
Right. You have many leashes.

133
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,316
-Tie them up together.
-Do it yourself.

134
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,527
-I don't want to become a criminal.
-Me neither.

135
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,198
But it doesn't sound too bad.

136
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,825
Harnesses for large dogs

137
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,244
are about this big.

138
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,038
Right.

139
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,216
I can't even take a bite
of the cookie he gave me.

140
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,635
And

141
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:09,515
he can't even throw away
the forsythia twig I gave him.

142
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,314
How about we be friends?

143
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,736
Do you think…

144
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,548
we can become friends?

145
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,722
AHN GA-YEONG

146
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,185
Yes?

147
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,397
It must feel lonely and quiet
there without me.

148
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,190
Hello?

149
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,694
Even when a mosquito that bugs us all day
is nowhere to be seen,

150
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,905
we can't help but become concerned

151
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,574
and wonder if it has fed itself.

152
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,200
You're right.

153
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,995
I was too inconsiderate
and left you behind.

154
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,129
I'm listening.

155
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,924
I was going to pop by today,

156
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,717
but work ended late.

157
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,637
I'm just kidding.

158
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,972
I'm on a date with my boyfriend.

159
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,559
But I'm not the type
to neglect my friends for a guy.

160
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,227
I'll stop by tomorrow.

161
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,896
Why would you…

162
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,814
Did you leave anything?

163
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,441
What do you mean?

164
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,361
Can't I visit my friend whenever I want?

165
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,780
"Friend"?

166
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,240
Don't you know what a friend is?

167
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:54,203
It's someone who treats you so well
though they're not your lover or family.

168
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:58,082
It's grateful to have even one,
but the more the merrier.

169
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,335
But then again, some cowards substitute

170
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,212
"I don't see you as a man."

171
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,631
"You're not charming as a woman,"

172
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,968
with "Let's be friends."

173
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,512
Some offend others like that.

174
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,180
In any case,

175
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,181
we're friends.

176
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,392
Why does everyone want
to be friends with me?

177
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,186
Am I a friend bot or something?

178
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,773
Don't you want to be my friend?

179
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:23,941
Why not?

180
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,818
Because I emptied your fridge?

181
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,320
Because I stuffed
all the dumplings myself?

182
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,490
Were you serious
when you said your ears would bleed?

183
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,950
Because I yapped so much?

184
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,621
No. My mind was elsewhere.

185
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,331
You must be busy.

186
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,583
Fine.

187
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,586
I didn't mean
to get upset with you. I'm sorry.

188
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,506
It's okay.
Don't mind me and focus on your work.

189
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,967
I'll call you again later.

190
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,904
I take back what I said
about making a new friend.

191
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,490
She doesn't want to be friends with me.

192
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,290
That's not it.

193
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,960
I think someone she likes
wanted to be just friends with her.

194
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,546
She got all worked up
when you said that part.

195
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,136
What is this?

196
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,638
Did that fool Young-do

197
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,892
say "Let's be friends,"
to a girl he fell head over heels for?

198
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:44,271
-I'm busy.
-Did you ask Da-jeong to be friends?

199
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,316
How did you…

200
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,443
I was right. You did.

201
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,988
What will you do?
I may lose my best friend thanks to you.

202
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,991
Are you talking about Patrick?

203
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,369
Patrick isn't my friend.
He's my boyfriend.

204
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,538
How could you not tell the difference?

205
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:04,458
Did you get your license
from a thrift shop or something?

206
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,418
Say something.

207
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,255
Hello, this is Patrick.

208
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,882
Oh, hello.

209
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:13,884
Why did you do that?

210
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,011
You've told me such great advice.

211
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,846
Well…

212
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:19,765
Call him an idiot.

213
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,227
-I can't say that.
-It's okay.

214
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,978
You can say, "You fool."

215
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:30,025
By the way, your mouth looked cute
when you said, "You fool."

216
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,487
What? Stop flattering me.

217
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,739
What? I'm just stating a fact.

218
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,783
That's not important right--

219
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:38,867
Oh, dear.

220
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,956
"I'm actually very timid.

221
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,834
I'm afraid I might see a ghost
while taking a shower,

222
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,753
so whenever I wash my hair,

223
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,004
I listen

224
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,299
to very loud and ridiculous music
such as Jump, Jump."

225
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,428
Such songs could cast away
ghosts for sure.

226
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:03,058
PSYCHIATRIST JU YOUNG-DO

227
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,565
-Oh, dear.
-"But lately,

228
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,109
I've been able to wash my hair
without any music.

229
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:16,155
I think it started
when I befriended my downstairs neighbor.

230
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,366
I know that he'll be the one

231
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:22,077
who comes to my rescue when I need it."

232
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,538
When you hear my footsteps,

233
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,915
you know that I'm home.

234
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,377
And if I step on a bar of soap
and fall with a big thud,

235
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:34,590
you would be the first to rush
to the rooftop to check if I was okay.

236
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,843
"When I had gone
through something unbelievable

237
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,222
or strived to hold back my tears,

238
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,559
he was always there for me."

239
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,978
"He was always there for me.

240
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,064
But never once did he rush me saying,

241
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:55,360
'Don't cry, or you can do it, or get up.'

242
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:01,533
I think that's when I started
interpreting his words differently.

243
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,120
I also did that

244
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,540
when he called me
a rabbit with bloodshot eyes."

245
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:13,003
You look like a chatty rabbit
with your bloodshot eyes.

246
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,464
Silence can be uncomfortable sometimes,

247
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,425
but you don't always have to
take responsibility for it.

248
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,929
But you merely fell.

249
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,390
You were rushing
to not keep your friend waiting.

250
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,809
It always sounded

251
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:32,731
like he was telling me
that everything was okay.

252
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,192
"It's okay.

253
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,153
I'll be right by your side.

254
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,031
Everything will be all right."

255
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,453
Then I started
misinterpreting his words even more.

256
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,960
Every time he spoke, it sounded like this.

257
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,420
What crazy things

258
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,298
-do you want to do?
-"I like you."

259
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:00,884
"I like you."

260
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,512
"I like you."

261
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,307
"I like you."

262
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,894
Is it crazy to like someone

263
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,231
if you can't promise
to be with them forever?

264
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,735
I can't even take a bite
of the cookie he gave me.

265
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,029
And

266
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:26,118
he can't even throw away
the forsythia twig I gave him.

267
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,336
Do you think…

268
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,798
we can become

269
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,135
friends?

270
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,153
All right.

271
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:04,656
It was from username Rooftop Rabbit.

272
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,410
Mr. Ju, what's your take on this?

273
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,662
Sorry?

274
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,458
I'm not sure.

275
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:19,463
Ms. Han, what do you think?
I saw you jotting something down.

276
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,382
Let's see.

277
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,801
"The guy is an ass…"

278
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,598
You can't curse on air.

279
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,059
I apologize.

280
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:36,021
Our listeners
have been leaving their comments.

281
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,815
Could you read those two comments?

282
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:39,900
Sure.

283
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,235
Username 3935 says,

284
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:46,865
"What a lunatic. He shouldn't
have told her about his feelings then."

285
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,868
Username Variety Hamster…

286
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,291
Username Variety Hamster says,

287
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,543
"The woman who sent the story

288
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,421
seems thoughtful and nice.

289
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:06,384
If I were him, I'd definitely date her
even if she misinterpreted

290
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,803
all of my words."

291
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,264
Username Fairy Whatsoever says,

292
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,434
"Maybe he urgently pushed her away

293
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:17,020
after seeing her naked face.

294
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,980
I'm speaking from experience. Sob."

295
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,023
That's not true.

296
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,818
It's probably not true.

297
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:29,699
And username Marble
and Round and Round are arguing right now.

298
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,661
Let me read what they've written.

299
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:36,790
"When he offered to be friends,
he pretty much told her to get lost."

300
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,418
"No. He just wants
to be by her side at all costs."

301
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:44,422
"No. It means he'll chop her hand off
if she crosses the line."

302
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:49,386
"No. He wants her
to be within his arm's reach."

303
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,515
What do you think, Mr. Ju?

304
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,476
Well.

305
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,438
I think he asked her to be friends

306
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,734
because he was afraid of hurting her.

307
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,529
I think he wanted her

308
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,991
to go somewhere safe.

309
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,370
But now that I think of it,

310
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,915
that could've been right as well.

311
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,125
Which one?

312
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,794
That he'd chop her hand off
if she were to cross the line?

313
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,087
No, not that one.

314
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,507
That he just wants…

315
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,387
to be by her side.

316
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,687
I think

317
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:46,067
he might've failed
to realize his true feelings.

318
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,961
What are you doing there?

319
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,298
I'm on patrol.

320
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,800
I heard there's someone suspicious.

321
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,137
Are you going to stay there?

322
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:39,889
I'll come down.

323
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,813
Don't tell me you're scared.

324
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:49,065
I'm not.

325
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:52,068
It's just too dirty.

326
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:54,446
Do you want my help?

327
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,323
No.

328
00:26:58,783 --> 00:26:59,784
Yes.

329
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,382
When I wrote that,

330
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,928
I didn't think that
people would talk so harshly.

331
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,894
By "harshly," do you mean

332
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:30,732
how they called me
a fool, an idiot, a coward,

333
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,859
a jerk, and a lunatic?

334
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,738
You didn't know
they'd call me names, right?

335
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,449
Right.

336
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,953
There were about 300 comments.

337
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:47,457
It felt like
I got punched about 300 times.

338
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:55,799
There was this comment
that we didn't read out loud.

339
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,718
"If you are the guy

340
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,471
in the story, then raise your hand.

341
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,891
Then make a fist

342
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,061
and punch your cheek."

343
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,357
Why would you do that? Don't hit yourself.

344
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:28,081
Since there are many things
I left out in that story,

345
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:37,757
they don't know the full story.

346
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,262
That's why they mocked you.

347
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,684
But I know everything.

348
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,817
I know how hard it was for you

349
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,570
to say that to me.

350
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,532
"I don't want to be friends."

351
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,123
I won't say that.

352
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:17,922
"I've also…

353
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:23,011
come to like you."

354
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:31,978
I won't say that either.

355
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,733
At least not right now.

356
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,494
We don't need to promise
to be together forever.

357
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:53,583
I don't know and will never know
what "forever" really means anyway.

358
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:04,052
In a two-hour movie,
"forever" means two hours.

359
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,683
I think that's enough.

360
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:52,725
I only cleaned up the mess
made by the police.

361
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,727
Everything else has remained untouched.

362
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:11,327
Shouldn't you change the door passcode?

363
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,621
He could come here.

364
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,456
I shouldn't change it

365
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,334
since I want him to come here.

366
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,249
I'm sorry.

367
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,001
I'll get that dry-cleaned.

368
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,753
-I can do it right now.
-It's okay.

369
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:04,005
It was my fault. I was on my phone.

370
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,560
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

371
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,238
I'm all right.

372
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,833
I'll have vanilla.

373
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,004
Two vanilla and one chocolate, please.

374
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,047
Sure.

375
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,175
Let's wait over there.

376
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:52,387
Gosh. What a lovely family.

377
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,849
You have a beautiful family.
Your son is adorable.

378
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,395
Kids these days speak English so well.

379
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:07,276
Goodness, I wish I had
a grandson like him.

380
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:28,297
Did you leave our hotel because of me?

381
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,092
-Because of me, did you--
-No.

382
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,344
You don't need to worry.

383
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:40,601
It bothers me
that you're telling me not to worry.

384
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,354
You have a good memory.

385
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:48,401
I'll be staying in Korea for a while,
so I found my own place.

386
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,904
I see.

387
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,243
Then why are you here today?

388
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,746
My colleagues are still here.

389
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:09,964
Den, we need to go back now.

390
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:16,637
"Den"?

391
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,183
Yes.

392
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,977
"Trick" for Patrick. "Nibal" for Hannibal.

393
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,604
"My" for Amy.

394
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,522
Are you serious?

395
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:27,607
Of course.

396
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,026
"Mian" for Damian.

397
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,319
"Tley" for Bentley.

398
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,571
"Ian" for Ian.

399
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:40,870
Well, "Ian" can't be shortened.

400
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,084
"Ian"?

401
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,713
This is him?
The one who doesn't even have a name?

402
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,007
Everyone gets their own name.

403
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:56,177
Choi Jeong-min is your brother.
And you don't have a name.

404
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,014
Den.

405
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,559
We need to go back,

406
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,062
and Ian needs to go to work.

407
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,355
PATIENT: MA JAE-GUK

408
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,908
The medically-induced coma is effective.

409
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:05,663
It has lowered his brain pressure,
so he can have surgery now.

410
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,373
Is that so?

411
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:20,887
Okay.

412
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,143
The vice-chairman would like to see you.

413
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,165
Death is closer than you think, isn't it?

414
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,210
Out of the blue,

415
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:56,005
your twin brother commits suicide.

416
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,592
And people from your childhood

417
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,844
are mysteriously dying left and right.

418
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:06,599
And patients often die
on the operating table.

419
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:11,479
"We did our best,
but we couldn't save him."

420
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:14,607
That's what the doctors will say.

421
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:18,361
But for someone like me
who's last in line to be the heir,

422
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,947
his death wouldn't come as a shock.

423
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,743
There will be no investigation or autopsy.

424
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:30,665
Are you telling me to hinder the surgery?

425
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,629
Didn't you find it odd
when you were chosen

426
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,547
for this team?

427
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:43,886
Dr. Bale is a racist, so it couldn't have
been him that chose an Asian like you.

428
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,179
So

429
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,724
who assigned you to this team, and why?

430
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,355
Did you ever wonder?

431
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,275
Please just cut to the chase.

432
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,944
Tell me what you want.

433
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,823
I don't do business
with someone who has nothing

434
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,158
to lose nor desire.

435
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,451
I don't have any.

436
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,579
I'm sure you do.

437
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,752
Any mistakes you've made in life

438
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,922
out of desperation or mere fun…

439
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,136
always leave a stain.

440
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,651
Long time no see, Dr. Chase.

441
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:34,455
So this is where you work,

442
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,708
Dr. Ju Young-do.

443
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,629
What is your question?

444
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:44,757
When I was young,

445
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,885
I temporarily stayed
at a nursing facility in Changbi-dong.

446
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:51,180
And recently,
I saw a photo of me taken there.

447
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,057
And…

448
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,563
that photo

449
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,942
was a piece of evidence
related to Choi Jeong-min's case.

450
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,654
Do you know anything
about the photo or facility?

451
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,490
Don't beat around the bush.

452
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,493
I don't believe I did.

453
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,371
Why did you assume I'd know anything

454
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,623
about his case?

455
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:21,961
Do you not remember anything?

456
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,056
Have you not heard
that the case was closed?

457
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,142
I did.

458
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,352
Then you should stop here.

459
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,147
I don't appreciate your rudeness

460
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,732
or recklessness

461
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,360
regarding your words.

462
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,948
What do I specialize in?

463
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:54,785
Why do you think
I brought this up during my lecture?

464
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,121
It's obviously trigeminal neuralgia.

465
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,457
So why didn't any medication work?

466
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,376
Why did this patient refuse craniotomy?

467
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,422
Is it Munchausen's syndrome?

468
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,549
Correct.

469
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,885
They pretend to be sick

470
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,928
in order to receive attention.

471
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:17,224
Some harm themselves
and even their own children or pets.

472
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,186
During her childhood,

473
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,813
her parents were too busy
to give her any attention.

474
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,440
Her sibling was ill as well.

475
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:28,027
The only time
her parents gave her attention

476
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,528
was when she was sick.

477
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,281
Thanks to her past experience as a nurse,

478
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:36,327
she knew which medication to take
and what kinds of symptoms to have

479
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,621
to make others believe she was sick.

480
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,709
If they go that far to fool us,
how can we tell if they're lying?

481
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,215
The only way to know if patients are lying
is to observe them.

482
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:54,094
Especially, when you deal with patients
who must fool doctors and nurses,

483
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,305
you should focus on their displeasure.

484
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:00,017
Let's say you asked a patient
if they had taken a certain drug.

485
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,603
If they didn't take it,
they'd say, "No, I didn't."

486
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:03,687
Plain and simple.

487
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:07,566
But if they're worried
about getting caught, it's different.

488
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,735
"Why are you suspecting me?

489
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:12,446
I'm offended by your question."

490
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:27,044
If they're clever, they lower their head,

491
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,004
drop a pen,

492
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:33,300
or try other means to distract you.

493
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,224
If it's true that I was duped,

494
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,601
that means

495
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,897
I was fooled by an 18-year-old.

496
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,693
That's unacceptable.

497
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,872
Why are you so impudent?

498
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,502
I'm talking to you.

499
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,692
BOOM, CLAP
DON'T ERASE THIS

500
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,986
IT'S A WORKING TITLE,
SO DON'T TEASE US

501
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,823
Patrick! Patrick will be joining our show!

502
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,826
Patrick!

503
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:44,830
But three of his agency's newbies
will be here too.

504
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:45,873
Three of them?

505
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,500
They'll join us,
but I never promised them screen time.

506
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,629
You're so evil.

507
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:55,966
All right. We have four pilot shows.
We need to make this work.

508
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,217
All right.

509
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,720
Like this.

510
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,263
And like this.

511
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,142
Thanks to Patrick,
people will be intrigued.

512
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,229
SEO HA-NEUL
HAN JIN-HO

513
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,731
This pair is good.

514
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:12,816
Go.

515
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,239
Go on.

516
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:21,700
But…

517
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,203
Aren't you here to work out?

518
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:28,248
Yes, I am. But I'm a bit hesitant.

519
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,501
Why? Because I'm a woman?

520
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,045
No. That's not why.

521
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,090
I'm just a bit…

522
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,050
A vet who's a crybaby

523
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:40,386
and a former national boxer.

524
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,222
A soft fist meets an iron fist.

525
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,556
Is that it?

526
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,809
Who said he has a soft fist?

527
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:47,976
He has platinum fists.

528
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,646
I thought he hit me
with a hammer that time.

529
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:51,730
He hit you?

530
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:55,359
Well…

531
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,153
I just said that we were friends.

532
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,863
I never said he didn't hit me.

533
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,660
-I feel sorry for you.
-No, he didn't hit me.

534
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,666
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

535
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,293
You're not bad.

536
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,421
If it's too tiring, put your knees down.

537
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,381
And start…

538
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,052
You're good.

539
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:30,436
You just need
to warm your body up a bit, so…

540
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:53,625
I'm running better
since I haven't done this in a while.

541
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:04,094
What does Seung-won have on you?

542
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,429
On me?

543
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:07,681
Nothing.

544
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,351
Whatever.

545
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,438
Why did you pretend to be weak?

546
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,149
I

547
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,234
never did.

548
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,002
Gosh, my head.

549
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:40,631
Gosh, my head.

550
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,050
What is this?

551
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,554
What?

552
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:49,556
Why is he there?

553
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:57,481
Hey.

554
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:00,400
Hey.

555
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:06,865
What?

556
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:08,951
Did a dog bite him?

557
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,417
Damn it.

558
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,130
VIOLENT CRIMES TEAM 3

559
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,299
It's okay. Be seated.

560
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,680
Where is Mr. Ko?

561
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:31,139
-In the rest--
-He's eating--

562
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:36,520
After having his meal,
I believe he went to the restroom.

563
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:38,313
He refused to listen to me again.

564
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,315
He's digging into some old case.

565
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:42,526
How are you doing?

566
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:44,403
Both physically and mentally.

567
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:47,781
I'm doing fine.
I'm still young and healthy.

568
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:50,033
Good for you. Lucky you.

569
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,201
How great.

570
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:56,498
Hello, sir.

571
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,834
-What's this about?
-Where have you been?

572
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,421
I had coffee…

573
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,423
No, I didn't.

574
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:08,010
I brushed… No.

575
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:11,388
I ate.

576
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:13,223
I had a late lunch.

577
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,060
Good going.

578
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,688
Who told you to sit down?

579
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:22,608
We received a call.
Go to Pungji Park right now.

580
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:23,900
A homeless man was hurt.

581
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:27,237
Oh, dear. That shouldn't happen.

582
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,239
-Let's hurry. We'll get going, sir.
-Okay.

583
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,410
Look at him.

584
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,203
UNDER INVESTIGATION

585
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:38,498
A few homeless people
are always camping in this underpass,

586
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,000
so people rarely use it.

587
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,918
That's why we were notified late.

588
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:44,755
How bad is his condition?

589
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,549
He bled excessively, so it looks bad.

590
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:50,594
Detective Park,
go to the hospital right now.

591
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:52,054
And you, meet with the caller.

592
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,096
Yes, sir.

593
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,349
Any security cameras around here?

594
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,810
I doubt we'll get any dashcam footage.

595
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,021
-I'll look into it.
-Go on, now.

596
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:01,980
Yes, sir.

597
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,450
I'll take this.

598
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:15,952
-Okay. Leave the door open.
-Got it.

599
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:20,457
All right.

600
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,000
I'm famished.

601
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,761
What brings you here?

602
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:35,514
Have you been well?

603
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,642
I wasn't actually curious,
but I just asked.

604
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,143
Goodbye, then.

605
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,194
What are you doing?

606
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,739
I believe you're unwelcome here
during office hours.

607
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:59,454
I'm not here for him.
I'm going to the fourth floor.

608
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,794
-I said the fourth floor.
-All the more reason to block you

609
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:09,131
because I can't let you disturb them.

610
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:12,426
Disturb what? Them dating?

611
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,803
I knew it. You knew.

612
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:22,978
I learn boxing nowadays.

613
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,402
PSYCHIATRIST JU YOUNG-DO

614
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:31,319
Come in.

615
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:38,994
What is it?

616
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:46,460
Are you planning to go upstairs today?

617
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:50,088
Upstairs? What's this about?

618
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:51,631
A, yes. B, no.

619
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,134
Not for now.

620
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,844
Then,

621
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,108
Be gentle.

622
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:13,278
Our brain cells won't regenerate anymore.
We're at that age.

623
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:16,573
Did you have to say something so sad
during dinnertime?

624
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:22,162
By the way, who wrote that?
It's not your handwriting.

625
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,497
Oh, that?

626
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,084
I'm here.

627
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,630
Yes. It was her.

628
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,926
I bought all the drinks
I finished last time.

629
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,350
By the way, who are you?

630
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:46,102
Hello.

631
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,231
She's my friend.
The owner of the cafe downstairs.

632
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,233
"Friend"?

633
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:54,277
You didn't want to be friends with me,

634
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,821
but you're friends with her?

635
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:59,491
I never said I didn't want to.

636
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:00,992
You guys are friends?

637
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,457
Do you know her well?

638
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:09,292
Sorry?

639
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:14,214
-Of course.
-I even crashed here.

640
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,131
I do that often.

641
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:19,302
She gave me
clothes to wear and food to eat.

642
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,389
She's been doing that for me
for the past 20 years.

643
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,602
Her favorite food. One, two, three.

644
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,020
-Dumplings.
-Pizza.

645
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:29,938
Rice soup.

646
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,399
Why rice soup when your mom sells pizza?

647
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,818
Exactly. You remind me of someone.

648
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:38,864
Her favorite flowers.

649
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:40,323
-One, two, three. Orange blossom.
-Red foxtail.

650
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,324
Magnolia.

651
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,662
Oranges don't have flowers.

652
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:47,414
Of course, they do.

653
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:50,667
And why would you name
an animal as a flower?

654
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:53,253
What in the world is a red foxtail?

655
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,297
-Give us your answer.
-Yes, please do.

656
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:57,966
I said magnolia.

657
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:00,010
But you don't like magnolia.

658
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:01,052
When they wither,

659
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,597
you said they look like
rotten banana peels.

660
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,140
Exactly. Why magnolia?

661
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:08,810
They have huge heads.
They have awful body ratios.

662
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:11,813
I think I'd appreciate it
if you guys respected my preferences.

663
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,815
Her favorite song. One, two, three.

664
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,191
-Jump, Jump.
-Patrick's

665
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:16,902
To You.

666
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:23,325
What? Don't tell me
you really like that song.

667
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:27,329
Not really. I used to listen to it
while washing my hair.

668
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:29,748
-But these days--
-To You is

669
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:31,499
my ringback tone.

670
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:35,378
Seriously? You like Patrick?

671
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,381
How could I not?

672
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,593
He's handsome, a great singer,
and a wonderful dancer.

673
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:45,221
You have good taste.

674
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,222
Do you like him too?

675
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,684
I don't just like him.

676
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:51,645
Is it my turn now?

677
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:53,438
I'm glad we met.

678
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:56,858
Whom am I speaking to?

679
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:59,110
One, two, three. The answer is myself.

680
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,199
Can I treat you like an older sister?

681
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:05,158
You can,

682
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,619
but she and I are the same age.

683
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,038
So I'm the oldest once again.

684
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:12,499
Forget it. Let's just
consider ourselves friends.

685
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,501
Do you like beer, my friend?

686
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:16,920
I do.

687
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:20,590
What's your name?

688
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,300
Park Eun-ha.

689
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:25,929
Nice to meet you, "Galaxy" Park.

690
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,515
Cheers.

691
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:30,684
Cheers.

692
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:39,567
GUGU BUILDING

693
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,820
I'll go see you this week.

694
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,113
When are you free?

695
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,700
Nothing's wrong. I just…

696
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:50,787
Can't a brother visit his older sister?

697
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:54,082
It's just strange
that you suddenly want to come over.

698
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,875
It's really nothing.

699
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:59,879
All right, then. Bye.

700
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,989
PSYCHIATRIST JU YOUNG-DO

701
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:51,806
Ms. Kang, are you okay?

702
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:57,729
Ms. Kang.

703
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,158
Did you hear it?

704
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:13,036
Yes. It was quite loud.

705
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:14,954
Is everything okay?

706
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:21,211
I'm afraid there's a tiny problem.

707
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,758
Oh, dear.

708
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,429
Spectacles like these
are the perks of cleaning.

709
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:34,307
Just when you think
you're done cleaning, you break things.

710
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,351
This is one dangerous spectacle.

711
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,107
No, you'll hurt yourself.

712
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,691
I can take my time and clean up.

713
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,111
Or we can clean up together quickly.

714
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:47,612
Do you have any newspapers?

715
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,908
Gosh, you really don't have to.

716
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:02,919
What is this?

717
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,797
I didn't do that.

718
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,718
It wasn't me. It was Ms. Ahn. Really.

719
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:13,179
She also left
an "I'll be back" memo somewhere.

720
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,764
Did I throw it away? Where is it?

721
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:16,891
KANG DA-JEONG, JU YOUNG-DO

722
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:22,564
It wasn't me.

723
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,566
I didn't…

724
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,610
I didn't know she wrote our names.

725
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,447
And this blanket… No, this towel.

726
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:34,534
I didn't see what was under this towel.

727
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:38,246
I mean… She must be insane.
Why would she write our names?

728
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:41,666
I'll get going.

729
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,918
Do you not believe me?

730
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,672
Wait.

731
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:49,299
No. Look.

732
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:53,636
The door was open earlier.
Make sure to lock it.

733
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,056
Hold on. You can't leave
when there's obviously a misunderstanding.

734
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,933
Why don't you call and ask her?

735
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:03,480
To be exact,
I had put those cookies in the freezer.

736
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,273
They were ice cold.

737
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:06,608
Okay.

738
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:09,569
Why are you leaving like that?
Stay here and listen to…

739
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:28,796
JU YOUNG-DO PSYCHIATRY CLINIC

740
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:33,134
You seemed to be in a hurry.
Why are you still here?

741
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:36,638
I had to take care of something upstairs.

742
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:38,223
All right, then. Good night.

743
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,804
KANG DA-JEONG

744
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,056
I felt bad about ruining
what she had made.

745
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:21,015
You get it, right?

746
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:23,351
It's like how you choose to take the bus

747
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:26,688
when you see snowmen
that some kids made on your car.

748
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:30,400
I'm not sure if it's only the buttons
or if I ripped your shirt as well, but…

749
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:33,903
Just so you know,
the hotel I work at disciplines us

750
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:36,573
regarding sexual assault and harassment.

751
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:40,118
In any case,
I promise to buy you a new shirt.

752
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:44,080
If you think I put it there
for you to see, that's really not…

753
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:48,501
If you no longer misunderstand me,
please wave a carrot so I'd know.

754
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:52,380
If you don't have any at home,
a cucumber or an eggplant will do.

755
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:57,719
I wish I was unconscious right now.

756
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,889
NEW MESSAGE

757
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:38,551
Can I really take these home?

758
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:39,636
Sure.

759
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:44,599
I really think it's great
that our hotel has a proposal package.

760
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:46,934
I agree. It'll be memorable.

761
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:49,020
More importantly, they'll never fail.

762
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:50,938
A guy who's madly in love may not know

763
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:53,983
what to do and just go to her house.
Then he'll get the res…

764
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:56,069
What was it? Restraining…

765
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:58,571
Res…

766
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:04,118
"Restraining order."
Repeat after me slowly.

767
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:07,038
Yes, that. Some guys end up getting that.

768
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:11,709
But nowadays, I'd be so grateful
if someone did that to me.

769
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,213
"Come down. I'm in front of your house.

770
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,882
This is for you."

771
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:22,887
I'm not into one-sided confessions.

772
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:24,847
Not all people are good at it.

773
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:29,394
Poor balloons.

774
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:32,772
Was it Dallas or Wisconsin?

775
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,649
There's a kiss academy there.

776
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:36,609
They teach people who were dumped

777
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,861
for being bad kissers, how to kiss.

778
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,196
They even get to practice.

779
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:42,115
No way.

780
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:49,706
Have you been there?

781
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:52,083
Of course not.

782
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:53,710
Why won't you believe me?

783
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:55,795
I really haven't been there.

784
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:57,964
Ms. Kang.

785
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:10,184
Hello?

786
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:14,105
No, it's okay.

787
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:18,484
Today?

788
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:28,661
But what's this about?

789
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,262
Guess who?

790
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,431
Did you wait long?

791
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:50,224
I'm sorry.

792
01:02:52,393 --> 01:02:53,936
Babe, what are you doing there?

793
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,814
I don't know. I thought he was you.

794
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:58,900
I touched a stranger because of you.

795
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:02,653
-Let me go wash my hands.
-Okay. Hurry.

796
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:08,868
How dare he come here again?

797
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:11,662
How would I know? Don't make it obvious.

798
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:14,081
Don't you feel uncomfortable?

799
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:16,626
I hate that he's here.

800
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:18,419
We can't ask him to leave.

801
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:22,131
How in the world
can Da-jeong stand seeing his face?

802
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:23,883
He's going to hear you.

803
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,346
I don't care.

804
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:38,564
Enjoy.

805
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:41,025
-Can you get me one more of this?
-Sure.

806
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:12,825
Will you accept this rose?

807
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:15,912
It's a paper rose. It won't wither,

808
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:17,914
it's not prickly, and it's recyclable.

809
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:20,499
You could also jot things down on it.

810
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,877
YONGSAN STATION, 99, 7641

811
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,254
Do you like music boxes?
Should we go get one?

812
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:28,090
Did he ever tell you about his childhood?

813
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,259
On March 13, 2003 at 9 p.m.,

814
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:32,887
I killed Kim Myeong-ja.

815
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:34,055
Now,

816
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:37,224
I'm putting an end to everything.

817
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:24,081
It was nothing to be scared about.

818
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:26,792
Actually, it was like having a lollipop.

819
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:29,045
If I say I'm curious about you,

820
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:30,963
can you understand that?

821
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:34,633
…a memory to painful to think about,

822
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:35,885
what do you say?

823
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:39,346
You know that
I can help you anytime. Right?

824
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:42,641
I know this sounds crazy,
but I think I know who this is.

825
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:46,145
I showed him
your photo from middle school.

826
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:47,772
Don't run away.

827
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:51,192
She makes me
fold the world in half and run to her.

828
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:55,905
