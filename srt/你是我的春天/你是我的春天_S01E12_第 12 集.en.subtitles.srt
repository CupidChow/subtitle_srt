1
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,376
Here we go.

2
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,798
A-ri, please say
happy birthday to Young-do.

3
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,841
I hope you live a long life.

4
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:35,136
Cut. Let's do it again.
That's usually for the elderly.

5
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,388
Happy birthday. Is that good?

6
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,225
Okay. Keep going.

7
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,064
Can you please stop dumping
your friend on the first floor?

8
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,900
As you can see,
he's making our cafe look bad.

9
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,861
She's talking about me.

10
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,321
Good for you.

11
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,490
-Ha-neul, say something as well.
-Forget it.

12
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:58,326
-Say something to Young-do.
-Eun-ha, let me.

13
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,120
It's okay. Please move.

14
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,080
This is too heavy. I'll carry it.

15
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,081
I'm really fine.

16
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,333
She's fine. Just say something
to the camera.

17
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,543
-Let me.
-I'm fine.

18
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,794
-Oh, no.
-Hey.

19
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,341
-Oh, no.
-I'm sorry.

20
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,261
Could you say something
to Young-do as well?

21
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,099
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,518
I should take a break.

23
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,936
Clean that up.

24
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,020
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:32,026
Didn't you order a cake
for Da-jeong's birthday tomorrow?

26
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,070
Her birthday is in two days.

27
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,489
What? That's Young-do's birthday too.

28
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,950
Did you talk to Young-do on the phone?

29
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,411
Mr. Ju? No. Why?

30
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,121
What? It's nothing.

31
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,664
Did you go to the bathroom?

32
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,457
What if you need to go while driving?

33
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,919
-Mom, do you think I'm still a kid?
-Yes. You always are to me.

34
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,255
I'll call you in Seoul.

35
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,716
You have to go to work right away,
so don't bother.

36
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,634
Eat something if you have time for that.

37
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:57,927
Okay.

38
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,596
Off you go. I'm busy.

39
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,180
-Bye.
-Okay.

40
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,266
Bye.

41
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,284
Gosh, it's true.

42
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,995
March 29th is May 10th
on the lunar calendar this year.

43
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,873
The stars aligned, but why are they
still not dating properly?

44
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,125
It's like a movie.

45
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,794
Even movies shouldn't drag on like this.

46
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,756
It's time for me to step up.

47
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,341
Whatever it is, don't do it.

48
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,801
What we need is a hidden camera prank.

49
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,804
You know the catfish effect, right?
That competition makes people better.

50
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,431
-Care to hear my plan?
-No, thanks.

51
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:46,601
First, we need Eun-ha's help.

52
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,360
DOCTOR'S OFFICE

53
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,778
PSYCHIATRIST JU YOUNG-DO

54
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,580
She'll push him to the wall.

55
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:11,376
Why… Why does she have to do such a thing?

56
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,887
I hoped I would

57
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,015
win your heart this way.

58
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,355
I'm yours.

59
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,321
Upon seeing that,
Ms. Kang will be blinded by jealousy.

60
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,990
Where does she appear from?

61
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,784
I don't know.
From behind the wall or something.

62
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,036
You really didn't put
much effort into the plan.

63
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:53,293
First of all, I doubt Ms. Park
would agree to do that.

64
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,379
Even if she did,
Mr. Ju wouldn't react that way.

65
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,841
I hoped I would

66
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,760
win your heart this way.

67
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,312
Well…

68
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:16,649
Seeing that you cornered and held me down
while confessing your love,

69
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,152
you must find pleasure
in controlling others.

70
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:22,155
That could be considered
a sadistic personality.

71
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:26,367
I could try to understand this
by blaming the media

72
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,329
for making such actions look romantic.

73
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:33,916
But if that's not the case
and you simply find joy in doing this,

74
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,378
I think you should receive therapy.

75
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,632
She's right. I don't think
Eun-ha should do that.

76
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,886
Instead, Cheol-do should ask Da-jeong out.

77
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:52,393
He'll approach her
as a completely changed man.

78
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,394
You are…

79
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,522
inside my heart.

80
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,776
I see. In that case…

81
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:01,778
Knock, knock.

82
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,406
Are you in there, Ms. Kang?

83
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,744
And Young-do sees that

84
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,371
-and brushes his teeth in fury.
-Hello.

85
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,582
Why would he be brushing his teeth there?

86
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,543
I don't know. Maybe he likes
the toothpaste that she uses.

87
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,213
You guys have terrible imaginations.

88
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,839
Wasn't the last one decent?

89
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,257
Not one bit.

90
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:27,136
If Mr. Park did that,
Da-jeong would definitely…

91
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:33,935
You are…

92
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:36,813
inside my heart.

93
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:38,272
Let go.

94
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,443
-You are--
-I said, let go.

95
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,444
I'm sorry, ma'am.

96
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,125
And he's a terrible runner.

97
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,838
What kind of cake should we get?

98
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,798
Young-do shouldn't have anything
too sweet.

99
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,884
I wonder what kind of cake Da-jeong likes.

100
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,223
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable. Please leave a message…

101
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,350
He's not picking up?

102
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,980
Just look ahead and focus on driving.

103
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,775
It must be one of these four reasons.

104
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,487
He's arrested, mourning, sick,

105
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,156
or doesn't care about you.

106
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,491
Working, showering,

107
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,202
sleeping, watching a movie…

108
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,328
Maybe one of them.

109
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:43,588
I'm sorry. I was too busy
to answer your call.

110
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,090
Did you arrive in Seoul?

111
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,050
We're still on our way.

112
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,219
Make sure to eat
no matter how busy you are.

113
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,096
You too.

114
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,853
We got the ultrasound
and angiography results.

115
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,438
Thankfully, they're clean.

116
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,148
It's bacterial pneumonia, isn't it?

117
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,900
You were reinfected.

118
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,028
Maybe it was from one of your outpatients.

119
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,281
I should stay here for a few days, right?

120
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,534
After the biopsy, I need to--

121
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,911
Go out?

122
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,165
I can't ask my therapy patients
to get therapy elsewhere.

123
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,627
And one of my patients today
is in a critical--

124
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,170
Haven't you learned your lesson?

125
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,925
Your patients must be important to you
just like you are to me.

126
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,676
But you should know what's more important.

127
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,762
Young-do.

128
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,431
Did you cut down on your work?

129
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:40,061
You're still on TV and helping the cops,
aren't you?

130
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,654
You can't be a psychiatrist
if you're going to keep this up.

131
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:53,199
You're carrying all your patients
and even the dead ones on your shoulders,

132
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,909
and forcing yourself to endure it.

133
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,079
You almost got in an accident today.

134
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,498
What if you ran over someone?

135
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,668
What if your girlfriend was
in your car with you?

136
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,677
-I can borrow some props.
-This isn't an opening ceremony.

137
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,720
We should have garlands on the rooftop.

138
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,098
Gosh. Is this a field day or something?

139
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,017
Then we'll line up some candles--

140
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,519
That's a violation of law.

141
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,104
Then how about some flowers?

142
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,439
Da-jeong will detest them.

143
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,277
Then let's change our cake
to a two-tier one.

144
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,487
-It's a joint birthday.
-This isn't a wedding.

145
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,656
Then we'll place some refreshments
on plates--

146
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,157
For a community meeting?

147
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,452
You're not letting me do anything.

148
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,538
Don't do anything. Just don't.

149
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,455
It's Young-do.

150
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,293
-Hey, we're here--
-Ha-neul.

151
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,878
I have a favor to ask.

152
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,047
Sure. What is it?

153
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,467
I think my car got towed

154
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,762
because I had to rush over
to the hospital.

155
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,267
No, I'm hospitalized.

156
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,352
I'll be here for a few days.

157
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,313
Then is it…

158
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,566
quite serious?

159
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,321
I'll be fine.

160
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,449
But I'd like you
to keep it a secret for now.

161
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,328
I don't want Da-jeong to know.

162
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,790
Sure. Don't worry about anything.

163
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,627
All right, then. Bye.

164
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,749
He went back to that hotel?
Is he allowed to do that?

165
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,958
I mean, that's…

166
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,171
But then again, it's not illegal.

167
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,673
We can make our next move

168
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,009
only if that server company hands over
the surveillance camera footage.

169
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:18,886
Why are they refusing?

170
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,348
They demanded a warrant,
so what choice do we have?

171
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,476
But the footage will give us a result

172
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,269
more quickly than forensics.

173
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,313
But this is a murder case for God's sake.

174
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,441
Oh, I was just on the phone.

175
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,819
They sent the footage.

176
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:38,072
What do you mean? They wanted a warrant.

177
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:41,283
-Out of the blue?
-They even came all the way here.

178
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,411
They agreed to cooperate with us.

179
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,663
What are they trying to pull?

180
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,790
-Let's see it. Hurry up.
-Yes, sir.

181
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,536
Yes, sir. I'm listening.
I'm still in the parking lot.

182
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,495
Hello?

183
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,168
Hello? Ian?

184
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,003
Ian!

185
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,289
You impudent bastard.

186
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,543
I asked you to get me a lawyer,
but you sent me thugs?

187
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,547
Once you wake up,

188
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,300
I'm going…

189
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,387
to ask you one question.

190
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,807
After that,

191
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,478
I'll let you be reunited
with your twin brother.

192
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,580
Ian.

193
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,124
Ian.

194
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,512
See that?

195
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,973
She knew about this camera.

196
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,183
Maybe she put it there.

197
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,602
She went there every day.

198
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,312
Did she know she was going to die?

199
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,356
She was probably keeping an eye on Chase.

200
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,152
Ian.

201
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:58,522
WON AND BAEK LAWYER KWON JUNG-HYEON

202
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,424
This will be much more entertaining

203
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,346
than trying to find out
if that 18-year-old boy was you

204
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,766
or your dead brother.

205
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,572
Now, both of you twins

206
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,660
have become murderers.

207
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,845
First, we need to find out
why that company gladly

208
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,599
handed over this footage
when they had demanded a warrant before.

209
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:19,269
Second, who benefits the most
from this footage being revealed?

210
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,187
It's Ian Chase.

211
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,107
We need to find out who's helping him.

212
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,109
WANTED FOR MURDER

213
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,081
You're in a pickle, aren't you?

214
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,585
A woman was killed.

215
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,670
Exactly.

216
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,632
I'm glad there was a camera there.

217
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,178
I never thought
it would be used like this.

218
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,726
You're not shaken
by something like this, are you?

219
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:10,654
The chairman's surgery is upcoming.
You should've been more careful.

220
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,323
How could you drink it without checking?

221
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,703
You're just like your brother.

222
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,624
What do you mean?

223
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,169
He had a drink, passed out,
and woke up with a knife.

224
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,963
Right.

225
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,801
I'm the only one
who saw the footage of him.

226
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:37,097
The camera's been there
since he lived there?

227
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,641
I had to find what you cherished
to find your weakness,

228
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,187
but you didn't have any.

229
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,858
He was your only family member,
so I looked into him.

230
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,486
I'm asking…

231
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,656
how long that camera has been there.

232
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,829
What do you want to see?

233
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,374
The day before his death?

234
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,293
Or the day of?

235
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,097
We'll talk again after you watch it.

236
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,307
We'll have a lot to talk about.

237
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,862
WANTED FOR MURDER

238
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,572
I should've killed them all.

239
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,575
All of them.

240
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,622
I should've killed them all.

241
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,459
Every single one of them.

242
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,632
Turn your headlights off.

243
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,178
How rude.

244
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,483
Is it confirmed?

245
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,946
-Did you find out anything new?
-Ahn Ga-yeong and Patrick?

246
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,239
What an odd couple.

247
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,866
EXCLUSIVE: AHN GA-YEONG AND PATRICK DATING
DESPITE A 10-YEAR AGE GAP

248
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,492
I'm not sure about that though…

249
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,493
She's a divorcée?

250
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,537
-It's a 10-year gap.
-No way.

251
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,331
Could this be real?

252
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,458
They're really an odd match.

253
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,876
It might be.

254
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,629
Does this mean
today's shooting is canceled?

255
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,757
Ahn Ga-yeong and Patrick
are ten years apart.

256
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,219
If my boyfriend was ten years my junior,
he'd still be in high school.

257
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,555
That must be why I'm still single.

258
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,058
He's still a minor
who's preparing for his exams.

259
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,684
That's why we haven't met.

260
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,940
Yu-kyeong, ask the reporters
one by one to leave

261
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,776
so that they won't inconvenience
the hotel guests.

262
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,819
If that doesn't work,

263
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,032
call security for help.

264
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,286
I need to go upstairs.

265
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,287
Okay.

266
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,002
EXCLUSIVE: AHN GA-YEONG AND PATRICK DATING
DESPITE A 10-YEAR AGE GAP

267
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,055
Come in.

268
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,317
I read the news article.

269
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,487
Are you okay?

270
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,202
It's you, my friend.

271
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,663
I thought it was one of my enemies.

272
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,916
Were you worried about me?

273
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,253
Is there anything I can do for you?

274
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,131
There seems to be a ruckus out there.

275
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,594
REPORTER CHOI

276
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,682
No, I'm fine.

277
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,313
Well…

278
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,817
Would you like to see my perfect acting?

279
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,321
One minute.

280
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:13,623
Hello, Mr. Choi. How could you
only call me at times like this?

281
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,919
Of course not. How could it be true?

282
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,340
Exactly. I'm curious as well.
Who in the world came up with this rumor?

283
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,595
I'll go to you right now.

284
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:31,016
Hello.

285
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,018
We're headed to the agency right now.

286
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,937
Yes, ma'am.

287
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:38,732
Seok-jun.

288
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,069
She doesn't want you to pick up any calls.

289
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,337
Hey, what are you doing?
Where are you going?

290
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,050
Hey!

291
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,178
Where are you going?

292
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:19,481
Have any of my scandals
been proven to be true?

293
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,484
Have they? No, right?

294
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,737
We just met once at an awards ceremony.

295
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,865
Do you want me to be hated
by everyone in this country?

296
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:35,997
I really don't want to be someone
who ruins the Korean wave.

297
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,920
Thank you.

298
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:55,183
What's wrong with you?
You shouldn't have come here.

299
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,687
I needed to see you to feel better.

300
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:02,816
Listen to your agency for now
and say you don't see me anymore.

301
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,734
And don't even think about meeting me.

302
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,737
Don't even call me
when your manager is around.

303
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,286
How long do we need to lie to everyone?

304
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,788
I feel bad for my fans.

305
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,875
Isn't it obvious?
We should take it to our graves.

306
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,918
Lying is a way of being considerate.

307
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:26,006
"I don't care how you feel. I'm at peace
now that I've told the truth."

308
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,508
Saying that is
the most selfish thing to do.

309
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,718
What if they find out?

310
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,180
Then wouldn't they get hurt more?

311
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,308
Even if I have to disappoint some--

312
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,270
Don't you go on a hardcore diet
before your comeback? Why?

313
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:43,190
Because you need to lose weight
to gain beauty.

314
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,984
You need to lose weight
to become more popular.

315
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,820
You need to go through a lot
to improve your acting skills.

316
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,447
No pain, no gain.

317
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,617
If you don't like that,
then you shouldn't date anyone.

318
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:55,952
So…

319
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,997
this is for the best?

320
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,836
-We have to lie?
-Do you have a time machine?

321
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,465
Can you go back in time
and be born in the same year as me?

322
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:11,259
Can you turn me back into a bachelorette?

323
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,888
Can you get rid of all the rumors…

324
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,391
about me?

325
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:26,483
Leave. My friend will help you
sneak out of here.

326
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,112
Make sure you pay her.

327
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,114
It'll be 40 million won, okay?

328
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,625
I owe you again. I feel bad.

329
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,126
I thought we were friends.

330
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,838
You're right. What would I have done
without you?

331
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:50,382
You can do it.

332
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,425
I can do it.

333
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,448
Where should I drop you off?

334
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:19,911
Anywhere is fine
as long as I can get a cab.

335
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,540
Are you headed to Gugu Building right now?

336
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:24,457
I am.

337
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,876
Then can I go there too?

338
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,338
Why…

339
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,884
Did Ga-yeong tell you
to wait for her at my house?

340
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:38,346
No. I'm going to see
the doctor on the third floor.

341
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,142
Do you mean Mr. Ju Young-do?

342
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,646
I feel a bit suffocated.

343
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,525
I see. Right.

344
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:53,445
They all go to him for help
when they feel that way.

345
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,156
Is he there right now?

346
00:26:57,073 --> 00:27:01,453
Well… He closes his clinic
around this time,

347
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,121
but let me check.

348
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,208
JU YOUNG-DO

349
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,965
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable. Please leave a message…

350
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,843
I should visit him next time.

351
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:20,847
He must be very busy.
I can't seem to reach him.

352
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,808
Then I'll get off here.

353
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,018
Sure.

354
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,774
GUGU BUILDING

355
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,475
I'm sorry! I thought you were Mr. Ju!

356
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,395
It's okay. I'm sorry.

357
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,063
No, I am.

358
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,857
No, I should apologize.

359
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,901
I shouldn't have
been seen driving this car.

360
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:17,028
The hospital… Young-do is…

361
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,280
Well…

362
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,951
I really wanted to take it for a spin.

363
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,078
I see.

364
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,871
Right. Good night, then.

365
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,998
-Okay.
-Okay.

366
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,169
Good night.

367
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,171
Good night.

368
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,179
Young-do.

369
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,473
It's me.

370
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,183
How did you know I was here?

371
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,812
Gosh, Ha-neul must've told you.

372
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,732
Don't mind me. I'll go take a shower.

373
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,234
Why would you shower here?

374
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:59,237
This hospital has good water pressure.
Plus, it's really clean.

375
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,157
The shower booths at my workplace
have slippery floors.

376
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,368
It feels like an alien is licking my feet.

377
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,369
You get it, right?

378
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,833
What? I didn't bring underwear.

379
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,918
You have extra underwear, right?

380
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:22,635
If you don't, I'll just go commando.
Like Adam and Eve.

381
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,846
At times, it needs to be free.

382
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,432
Gosh, it's in that drawer. Please wear it.

383
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,477
Can I have that bread?

384
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,397
You didn't have dinner yet?

385
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,233
Our cafeteria food isn't tasty.

386
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:40,111
Let me go shower first.
You shouldn't get infected.

387
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,453
Young-do, can you give me your underwear?

388
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,957
Coming.

389
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:57,128
Never mind. It's okay.
I'll just go commando.

390
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:00,757
You do that, and you're dead meat.

391
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,486
Is that you, Young-do?

392
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,489
Oh, hello.

393
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,075
It really is you.

394
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,495
What are you doing here?

395
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:39,295
Goodness. Were you really going
to stay here for a bit and just leave?

396
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:43,299
Even if Da-jeong told you not to come,
you should've come to see me.

397
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,969
I was going to come some other day.

398
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:52,225
Oh, I came out to receive these.

399
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:58,022
What? Do you think I don't have
a guy who gives me sweet gifts?

400
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,401
No, I think you have plenty.

401
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,238
Look at you flattering me again.

402
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,948
Do you want to get drenched again?

403
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,331
Do you want one?

404
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,626
Thank you.

405
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,422
-It's red-bean bread.
-Bread.

406
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,217
Right. It's red-bean bread.

407
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,552
Bread.

408
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:30,847
Bread.

409
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:36,269
You're not upset
that she told you not to come, are you?

410
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:42,609
No one wants to look miserable
in front of others, you know.

411
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,570
I completely understand.

412
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,281
I just rushed over here
because I was worried.

413
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,831
Is regretting also
a sign of mental illness?

414
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:02,795
Well…

415
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,882
If you can admit that you're regretful,

416
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,844
then you're actually on the healthy side.

417
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,554
Right?

418
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,515
Then I must be extremely healthy.

419
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,810
I regret it. How could I not?

420
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,649
Never in my wildest dreams did I think

421
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,985
that falling for someone
would be this scary.

422
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,741
I mean,

423
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:36,287
they say you can't control
who you fall in love with,

424
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,581
but there are times

425
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,001
when your greed blinds you

426
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,920
and causes problems.

427
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,428
Don't leave.

428
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,854
I knew it was wrong,

429
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:05,441
but I was too weak to resist.
Then all those following years,

430
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:10,154
I ended up hurting my own children.

431
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,161
I'm relieved
that Da-jeong is smarter than me.

432
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:24,377
You're a good person. Aren't you?

433
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,219
I had good looks,

434
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:36,431
but I was a terrible judge of character.

435
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,353
Just stay by her side.

436
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,773
Be healthy and be there for her
for a very long time.

437
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,863
Just don't get sick.

438
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,355
NEW MESSAGE

439
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:31,986
Are you asleep?

440
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,989
Had you been a minute late,
I would've been.

441
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,951
I'm sorry. I've been busy.

442
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,620
Are you busy tomorrow?

443
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,664
Yes, my schedule's packed.

444
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,876
I have to receive a package,
roll around in my bed,

445
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,212
and wipe my phone screen.

446
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,798
I see. You're quite busy.

447
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,053
I'll be getting off work early, though.

448
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,722
What time?

449
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,308
Should I tell you or not?

450
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,396
Will you be able to see me for a minute
if I drop by?

451
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,659
I'll think about it.

452
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:26,249
JU YOUNG-DO

453
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:46,978
I thought you were busy.

454
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:48,521
I made some time.

455
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:49,605
For how long?

456
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,108
I was allowed out for an hour.

457
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:55,194
If I subtract travel time…

458
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:57,488
About five minutes?

459
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,326
Then we could've met
some other time. Why bother?

460
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,124
We have three minutes now.

461
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,711
I'll just be late and get scolded.

462
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,673
Five minutes is too short.

463
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:20,845
When I was young,

464
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,806
on days my dad was really busy,

465
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,726
I didn't get to see him all day.

466
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,521
I'd spend all day by myself,

467
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,940
so I told him once that I was lonely.

468
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,694
Oh, right. I lived with only my dad.

469
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:37,987
I told you before, right?

470
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:44,410
After that, he always dropped by home

471
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:49,707
for even just five minutes
to see me before I went to bed.

472
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,501
"Just five minutes?

473
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,712
That's too short.

474
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,214
Come on."

475
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,632
That's what I said to him.

476
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,052
But I'm doing the same thing now.

477
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,972
What did you guys do
during those five minutes?

478
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,558
He listened

479
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,563
as I told him what I had done
throughout that day.

480
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,733
What did you do today?

481
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,864
I had a meeting this morning.

482
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,243
I had a group of guests,
so it was quite hectic.

483
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:28,829
Then Yu-kyeong and I thought long and hard
about what to have for lunch

484
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,207
and decided to have cold noodles.

485
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,336
But it was a restaurant
we had never tried before.

486
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,964
It wasn't tasty,
so we had to force ourselves to eat.

487
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,174
Oh, dear.

488
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,596
And just a while ago,

489
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,810
the filming crew caused trouble,
so I had to sort it out.

490
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:55,398
They smashed a painting
with their boom microphone.

491
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,358
-I see.
-The one in a suite at that.

492
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,735
Worth 13 million won.

493
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:00,653
Oh, dear.

494
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:06,909
The production company decided to buy it,
so everything got sorted out.

495
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:13,666
To be frank,
I didn't like that painting to begin with.

496
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,962
You know how certain paintings
are too abstract to understand?

497
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,380
Yes.

498
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:25,761
And now, I'm here with you.

499
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,224
I'm feeling a bit uneasy
because I don't want you

500
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,893
to be late and get scolded because of me.

501
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,024
It's time, right?

502
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:41,736
Should I not go?

503
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:46,615
Get up.

504
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,534
Where did you park your car?

505
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:52,913
I took a cab.

506
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,750
Then let's go get one.

507
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,128
I don't want you to get scolded.

508
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,132
He's deceiving her.

509
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,925
He's pretending not to be sick.

510
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,471
Young-do just doesn't want her
to get hurt.

511
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,930
Which one is the most painful?

512
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,266
One. The person you like is ill.

513
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,061
Two. The person you like lied to you.

514
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,854
Three. The person you like is ill

515
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,898
and lying because they're worried
about you.

516
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,741
It's up to Da-jeong to get hurt or not.

517
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:32,870
It's also up to her to decide to end it
because it's too painful.

518
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,830
But it's his birthday today.

519
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,624
It's her birthday as well.

520
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:44,632
What's going on? Were you badmouthing me?

521
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,177
Did I do something wrong?

522
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,556
Mr. Ju is hospitalized.

523
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,601
Don't be ridiculous. I met him earlier.

524
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:59,605
He was given permission to go out
although his doctor scolded him.

525
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:00,523
Don't.

526
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,861
He must've overworked himself lately.

527
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,905
It's nothing serious.

528
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:13,661
Then is that why
you drove his car here that day?

529
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,956
Yes. It happened while he was driving, so…

530
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,875
His car was towed, so I had to pick it up.

531
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,502
He got into a car accident?

532
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,462
No. He stopped in the nick of time.

533
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:30,302
They ran some tests on him,
fearing it might be chronic rejection.

534
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:33,264
But thankfully,
that's not the case. Right?

535
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,181
Right.

536
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:37,768
Right.

537
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,271
Where…

538
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,901
is he right now?

539
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,188
You didn't have to come.

540
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,066
I just wanted to.

541
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,612
I brought some peaches.

542
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,322
Should I peel them for you?

543
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,616
I'll have them later.

544
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,744
You can still have fruit, right?

545
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:23,499
Don't tell me you can't eat this too
like that time with red ginseng.

546
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,961
I should be careful for now.

547
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,423
I guess that's a no.

548
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:36,428
I promise to have them later. I'm sorry.

549
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,973
No, I'm sorry.

550
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:41,308
I forget from time to time.

551
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:46,438
I assume everything is fine
since you got the heart transplant.

552
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,401
I know you have to be very careful,

553
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:55,573
but at times, I ask you for many favors,
knowing you're already busy.

554
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,205
I guess I was being too greedy.

555
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,334
What do you mean?

556
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,545
I promised myself

557
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,549
to do my utmost best
to live as long as I could.

558
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,052
But now…

559
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,973
Now that I've fallen for someone…

560
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:22,641
Do you mean

561
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,685
Ms. Kang Da-jeong?

562
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,860
You know what's funny?

563
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:37,740
Even if your heart is sick,
you don't feel pain there.

564
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:42,119
It just feels more difficult to breathe.

565
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:44,288
You feel chest pain.

566
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:46,665
But…

567
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,919
Does your heart hurt?

568
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,592
Because I think
that I shouldn't see her anymore,

569
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,138
it feels like a hand has come in here

570
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,726
and squeezed my heart really hard.

571
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,275
Are you going to end things with her?

572
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,528
Yes.

573
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:19,698
I should.

574
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,288
A two-hour eternity.

575
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,001
A one-minute eternity.

576
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,089
I guess I wanted to believe that.

577
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:46,225
We should go
before they start looking for us.

578
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,188
It's 6:50 right now.

579
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,107
Should we leave in ten?

580
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,989
This is a scene from Days of Being Wild.

581
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,619
In that movie, Leslie Cheung…

582
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:06,787
I see.

583
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,748
It's your crush again.

584
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:19,842
Yuddy shows Su Li Zhen

585
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,429
a watch for one minute.

586
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:28,600
He says that one minute
will be remembered forever.

587
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:35,399
You see, Yuddy is never the type
to settle down with one woman.

588
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:39,862
So this is how I understood it.

589
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,949
"I'll be leaving eventually,

590
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:49,288
but this one minute is just for you.

591
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,584
No one will take it from you,

592
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,336
and it won't disappear either.

593
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,882
It's a one-minute eternity

594
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:02,801
just for you."

595
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:17,232
JU YOUNG-DO PSYCHIATRY CLINIC

596
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,033
CLOSED DUE TO
DR. JU'S PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES

597
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:37,044
"Breaking up with someone
out of love is understandable."

598
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:39,379
Definitely true.

599
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,300
"My biggest fear

600
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:45,802
is them getting hurt by me."

601
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,013
Definitely true.

602
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:53,560
"I'd rather die
than see them cry because of me."

603
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,480
Definitely true.

604
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,783
Hey, Mom. Sorry I didn't pick up.

605
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:10,118
No, that's fine.

606
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,578
Where are you?

607
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,413
I just got home.

608
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,707
Why do you sound so down?

609
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,794
Mom…

610
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,756
-Mr. Ju is--
-Oh, I know.

611
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,259
Did he tell you that he came to Gangneung?

612
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,137
Not yet?

613
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,182
He said he'd tell you
once you were back in Seoul.

614
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,269
What did we talk about?

615
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:40,816
Let's see. He didn't say much.
I just yapped away.

616
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:42,609
I said,

617
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,072
"Be healthy and be there for her
for a very long time.

618
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:48,907
Just don't get sick.

619
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,826
If you do, I'll kill you."

620
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,581
Anyway, I wonder
why he hasn't told you yet.

621
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,458
Did you guys fight?

622
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,338
Mom.

623
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,634
Did you really tell him

624
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,513
not to get sick?

625
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,558
Then should I have told him to get sick?

626
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,644
Why did you say that?

627
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:21,773
Why did you say that to him?

628
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,193
What's wrong?

629
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,279
Is something wrong?

630
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:30,907
Why did you say that?

631
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:34,703
He's already sick.

632
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:41,918
He doesn't want to see me
because he's sick!

633
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:46,381
How can I tell him to stay by my side
when you told him that?

634
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:49,593
Why did you say that to him?

635
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,018
Da-jeong.

636
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,437
Are you okay?

637
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,361
Mom, I'm not okay.

638
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,825
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

639
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,120
I'm sorry for crying out of the blue.

640
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:21,249
But…

641
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,293
No.

642
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,004
You can cry in front of me.

643
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,383
Should I go there right now?

644
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:37,766
Mom.

645
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,023
You know what?

646
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,693
He doesn't

647
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:52,322
even have a mom he can call and cry to.

648
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:57,661
So who can he turn to?

649
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:03,959
He probably won't be able
to break up with me either.

650
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:08,588
He tried doing that once.

651
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,800
He said we should be friends,

652
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:15,053
but I went over to his place…

653
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:23,353
and told him
that a two-hour eternity was fine.

654
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:35,157
Mom, I think I made a mistake.

655
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:37,659
I…

656
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,789
came to like him too much.

657
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,713
My heart breaks for him.

658
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,566
Da-jeong.

659
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:11,610
Da-jeong?

660
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,170
Think about what I said.

661
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:34,424
You don't have to run your own clinic
to continue doing what you do.

662
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,385
Then you'll be able
to lessen your stress--

663
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:40,388
All right. I'll think about it.

664
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,516
Don't just say that.

665
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:48,271
What do you mean?

666
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,941
Where are you going looking like that?

667
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,734
THE PRINCESS OF FOREVER
TVC

668
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:55,445
Would you believe me
if I said it was for you?

669
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:59,741
How is it for me?
If it is, you should stay here with me.

670
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,789
I became greedy.

671
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,752
Now, I want to grow old with you…

672
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,131
and hold your hand until the day we die.

673
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:19,344
I shouldn't have such desires.

674
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,429
You're not being greedy.

675
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,265
We can do that.

676
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,725
No. Don't go.

677
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,436
I pray

678
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:32,190
that you won't grieve too much for me.

679
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,504
Hey.

680
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:57,591
Did you really leave?

681
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:01,720
Princess.

682
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,932
This isn't funny!

683
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,311
Did you really leave?

684
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:11,104
No, right?

685
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,356
Hey.

686
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,484
You said you'd take care of me.

687
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:18,987
Are you really gone?

688
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:27,329
Your notebook is still here!

689
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:28,747
Princess!

690
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:31,750
Please forget me.

691
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,210
And thank you.

692
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:36,504
Princess…

693
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,722
I'll buy you jjajangmyeon.

694
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:03,156
Can you come down for a minute?

695
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:10,830
Can you come to the rooftop?
I feel more comfortable here.

696
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:18,088
I don't want to create
a sad memory in your home.

697
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:24,177
I don't want you
to see my sadness under the light.

698
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:33,728
Because I don't want her
to remember me as a painful memory…

699
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:39,901
Because I feel sorry
for the pain he's going through…

700
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:44,197
Because I don't know how to break up…

701
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:49,035
Because I don't know how
to hold back my tears,

702
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:52,706
I've decided to get angry.

703
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,757
Do you know how ridiculous you are?

704
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,636
How could you turn me into a fool?

705
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:10,223
Why…

706
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,518
did you come by the hotel?

707
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,606
You could've said you were sick

708
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:22,527
and asked to meet some other time.

709
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,075
Did you already make up your mind?

710
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,663
Were you giving me five final minutes?

711
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,876
Was that it?

712
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:51,347
What have I been doing all this time?

713
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:59,272
Was I the only one
hanging onto our relationship?

714
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,195
Had my arms given out

715
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,322
or my hands slipped,

716
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:09,949
would you have let go as well?

717
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:17,290
You're running away under the pretense
of not wanting to worry me.

718
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:21,461
You're irresponsible, cowardly,

719
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:24,756
and you brazenly assume
what makes me happy.

720
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:29,719
Isn't that

721
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,056
why you liked me?

722
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:39,145
Because I'm a cowardly
and irresponsible scumbag…

723
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:44,067
who judges others as he pleases.

724
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:49,781
That's who you are.

725
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:53,201
You're attracted to scumbags.

726
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,253
You're right.

727
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,550
That's who I am,

728
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,594
but I've chosen to stop being like that.

729
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:15,598
It's getting old and boring.

730
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:16,558
Fine.

731
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:20,353
Then do that.

732
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:25,150
Is that all?

733
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,402
Do you have more to say?

734
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:30,405
Because I don't.

735
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,591
Goodbye, then.

736
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,260
But you can't just leave…

737
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:27,879
I wish…

738
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,007
I didn't have any feelings.

739
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:34,802
I wish…

740
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,098
they all shriveled up.

741
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,269
I wish…

742
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,105
they…

743
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:51,361
all died.

744
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:52,226
DAD

745
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:28,781
The things I went through after moving…

746
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,701
I can't imagine
how hard I would have fallen

747
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:35,246
if it weren't for him.

748
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:37,748
He helped me endure all of that

749
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:41,043
and even helped me pull out
the knife stuck in my throat.

750
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:44,630
I wonder how someone like that
would have felt when he left me.

751
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:48,092
I didn't even get to put a band-aid on him
and that makes me so angry.

752
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:49,802
Because of me…

753
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:53,306
his heart, of all places, is hurting.

754
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:59,812
