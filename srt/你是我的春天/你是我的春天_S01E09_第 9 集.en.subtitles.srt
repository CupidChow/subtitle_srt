00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,301
NEW MESSAGE

2
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,519
I don't have any vegetables at home.

3
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,735
CARROT

4
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,298
CARROT

5
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,663
Why are you smiling like a fool?

6
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,290
What? I'm not smiling.

7
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,375
Look. You are smiling.

8
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,545
I can see that
you are trying not to smile,

9
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,797
but you cannot stop yourself.

10
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,842
You look as if you have
a cute bunny in your arms

11
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,428
or you just had the sweetest fruit.

12
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,599
Gosh.

13
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:06,561
THE PRINCESS OF FOREVER

14
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,563
A cute bunny, my foot.

15
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,608
She's a weirdo claiming
to be the princess of Tangerine Kingdom.

16
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,359
And she's only eating jjajangmyeon.

17
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,862
There's no jjajangmyeon in your kingdom?

18
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,740
No.

19
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,618
Forget it. Wipe your mouth.

20
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,453
I don't want to see your dirty face.

21
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,580
Am I too beautiful for your eyes

22
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,123
to behold?

23
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,546
Gosh. I guess this is
what the princess syndrome is like.

24
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,341
I'm talking to a delusional princess.

25
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:41,429
Here. This is called a tissue.
You can wipe a mess with this.

26
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,390
You are the one with the sickness, not me.

27
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,684
There is no medicine
for those who are lovesick.

28
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,354
-You are in trouble.
-So cute.

29
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,490
Wait.

30
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,158
Why are you covering up my face?

31
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,535
It'd be weird if an ancient princess

32
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:08,081
who time-traveled looked
just like a celebrity in the 21st century.

33
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,043
They'll think the princess
became a celebrity in her next life.

34
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,881
Everyone in our drama
only drinks this anyway.

35
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,259
Won't they know
that this is product placement?

36
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:23,096
If we ignore our setting and take it far,
they'll feel repulsed by it.

37
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,810
DR. CHASE

38
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,728
EPISODE 9

39
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,813
Hello?

40
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:40,882
Are you okay?

41
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,596
Hold on.

42
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:04,947
Can I…

43
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,826
take a look at that?

44
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,663
Did you make this yourself?

45
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,874
No. Someone left it here.

46
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,293
Is there a problem?

47
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,008
I'm sorry, but I can't…

48
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,558
If this isn't an urgent matter…

49
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,858
It's not urgent.

50
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,360
I'll call you again.

51
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,363
How did you find this place?

52
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,867
You seem to be everywhere I go.

53
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,619
Why did you want to see Ms. Kang?

54
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,747
Again, you're asking a question
that doesn't concern you.

55
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,374
Did you see

56
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,377
the person that left the paper rose?

57
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,837
No, I did not.

58
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,180
I have a question for you too.

59
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,098
Okay.

60
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,601
Who…

61
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,270
do you think you are?

62
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,106
What do you mean?

63
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,485
I'm asking you to be careful from now on.

64
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,363
Your questions always cross the line.

65
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,367
Did I cross the line?

66
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,077
Have I done something wrong to you?

67
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:01,457
Have I ever asked you
about your personal life, your childhood,

68
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,543
or the woman you like?

69
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:05,962
Have I?

70
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,507
Did you just say "the woman you like"?

71
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,051
Picking apart my words?

72
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,719
I'm sorry if I offended you.

73
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,637
But…

74
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,766
do you know that

75
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,936
you have never given me
straight answers to my questions?

76
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,982
Because I don't see why I should.

77
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,680
I have a lot of work,
so I'll be working late tonight.

78
00:10:56,697 --> 00:11:00,076
PSYCHIATRIST JU YOUNG-DO

79
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:04,914
Are you busy?

80
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:06,874
Come in.

81
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,545
If you had just gotten off work,
you probably haven't had dinner yet.

82
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,713
Aren't you hungry?

83
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,634
I do have some snacks here.

84
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:17,968
I'm good.

85
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,349
But I can't give them to you. You might do
something to the snacks again.

86
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,269
I told you I didn't do it.

87
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,312
Okay.

88
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,606
I got it, so don't rip my shirt.

89
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,442
I only have a few shirts.

90
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,820
But somebody ripped
one of them into pieces.

91
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,448
I'll buy you a new one.

92
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,703
I checked the shops in the hotel today,
but nothing really stood out.

93
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,042
Do you know how hard
it is to find the perfect shirt

94
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,502
that suits your eye color?

95
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,629
My eye color?

96
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:56,257
It's amber in natural light,

97
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,175
hazelnut indoors,

98
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,136
and chestnut in dark places.

99
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,889
I see. My eye color changes all the time.

100
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,182
I never knew that.

101
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,685
Why are you smiling?

102
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,228
Does that make you happy?

103
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,274
You looked shocked earlier,
so I was worried.

104
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,443
But you seem okay now.

105
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,577
If you're staying late because of me…

106
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,454
No, I'm not.

107
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,372
If you are,

108
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,375
I'm all right.

109
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,378
So you can go home.

110
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,382
I came down to tell you that.

111
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,305
Earlier…

112
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,392
I left the cafe like I was running away…

113
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,898
not because I was scared,

114
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,567
but because I hated what was happening.

115
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,196
I hated that I might get scared.

116
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,494
So you don't have to worry about me.

117
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,249
Do you hate looking weak?

118
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,799
No.

119
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,305
I hate being scared
and unable to do anything.

120
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,725
Can I ask why?

121
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,693
You told me about your pain.

122
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,865
So I want to tell you about mine…

123
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,120
I do want to tell you.

124
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,416
But I don't think I can.

125
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,838
Because I've never told anyone about it.

126
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,967
You know that I can help you anytime.

127
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:05,928
Right?

128
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,508
If…

129
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,182
If your patient…

130
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,938
has a memory too painful to think about,

131
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,194
what do you say to them?

132
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,575
I'd ask them to sit with me
and take our time to talk about it.

133
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,120
I'd also say
that they can tell me anything in here

134
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,414
and that their secret is safe with me.

135
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,295
That if they can't tell me
the whole story,

136
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,923
they can start with a word first.

137
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:41,857
It was…

138
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,863
when I was seven years old.

139
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,788
Okay.

140
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,466
I…

141
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,139
I still…

142
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,393
remember it.

143
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,149
My mom…

144
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,960
My mom…

145
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,216
My mom…

146
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,806
I saw

147
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,267
my mom getting beaten up.

148
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:10,487
I was really scared
that she might be beaten to death.

149
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,034
I was

150
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,620
so scared that I couldn't do anything.

151
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,460
I locked my door.

152
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,121
If you were my patient…

153
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,959
I would have asked you this.

154
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,798
If that seven-year-old girl were here now,

155
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,760
what would you tell her?

156
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,348
"Why didn't you do anything?

157
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,559
You should have saved your mom."

158
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,605
You wouldn't scold her like that. Right?

159
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,155
I'm sure
you would be hugging that girl too.

160
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,871
"When you grow up later,

161
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,752
don't blame yourself for what happened.

162
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,714
You didn't do anything wrong.

163
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,844
I bet your mom is grateful to you
for growing up into…

164
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,599
a strong woman
after experiencing something so scary."

165
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,187
You would be saying that to her.

166
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,333
Tissue.

167
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,085
What?

168
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,756
Tissue?

169
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,592
Okay. Tissue.

170
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:44,892
Here.

171
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:48,145
-I don't want wet wipes.
-Wet wipes. Oh.

172
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,522
No wet wipes.

173
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,654
A lot more.

174
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,283
A lot more. Right.
You need a lot more than this.

175
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,874
Here. A lot more.

176
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,170
-Tteokbokki.
-What?

177
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,380
Tteokbokki.

178
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,341
Tteokbokki?

179
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,468
Right. Tteokbokki.

180
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,637
Yes. When you cry, you get hungry.

181
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,098
Tteokbokki. Okay, I'll order some now.
My phone…

182
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,605
-Where are you going?
-To wash my face.

183
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,399
Why all of a sudden?

184
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,529
I look ugly after crying,
so I'll wash up and put on makeup.

185
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:41,865
You still look pretty…

186
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,826
Okay. I'll be waiting.

187
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,453
Let's eat it on the rooftop.

188
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,206
Your clinic can't smell like food.

189
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,458
Sure.

190
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,053
GUGU BUILDING

191
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,813
Gosh. My makeup got smudged.

192
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,739
Your tteokbokki is here.

193
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,909
I'll be right there. Give me a second!

194
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:34,876
What?

195
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,256
Are you wearing perfume too?

196
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,050
You're probably smelling the food.

197
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,218
I see.

198
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,888
I didn't know that tteokbokki
these days smelled like flowers.

199
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,225
Roses.

200
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,145
And peonies.

201
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,151
What?

202
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,527
Will you rip my shirt again?

203
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,580
Have you seen Eternal Sunshine?

204
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,043
When that movie was re-screened,
a lot of people asked me

205
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,963
if it was possible
to only erase memories about one person.

206
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:23,300
-Is it possible?
-No.

207
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:29,431
What about the neuralyzer
that can wipe memories in Men in Black?

208
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,599
Not possible.

209
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,436
But it was possible
to manipulate a specific memory

210
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,230
by injecting proteins that react to light.

211
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,107
On mice, not humans.

212
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,861
So it doesn't work.

213
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,614
But you can cover up
bad memories with good ones.

214
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,824
And vice versa.

215
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,334
When I was young,

216
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,587
every time they drew
my blood or gave me anesthesia,

217
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,090
the nurses would give me lollipops.

218
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,802
So I would associate shots
with something sweet.

219
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,597
But when that repeated,

220
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,225
the lollipops started to sting later.

221
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:18,855
Then, on a particularly hard day,

222
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,691
someone gave me a lollipop.

223
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,113
And it started to taste sweet again.

224
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,699
Who gave you the lollipop?

225
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,702
My first crush?

226
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:40,585
Your first crush must have been so pretty
if a lollipop was all it took for you.

227
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,381
Well, I guess.

228
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,385
I'll clean this up.

229
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,555
Wait. It's obvious
that I'm not done with my food.

230
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,682
I thought you were done.

231
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,726
If you're hungry, have more lollipops.

232
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,855
I was very young. I was 11.

233
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,157
I didn't ask.

234
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,664
That's why you put
a lollipop in your first-aid kit.

235
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:22,294
When I first saw that,
I thought you were trying to look cute.

236
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:25,505
Why would I try to look cute?
If anything, I'd try to look cool.

237
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,924
You're the cute one.

238
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,760
You want to eat tteokbokki after crying.

239
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,806
You're wearing perfume
when we're eating tteokbokki.

240
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,977
I thought you were smart,
but you don't know when to let things be.

241
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,854
I bet you were one of those students

242
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,690
who sat in the front
and corrected your teachers' mistakes.

243
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,984
"That's missing a minus sign, sir."

244
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,694
I didn't do that.

245
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,780
-I guess you were one of those students.
-No, I wasn't.

246
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:55,202
I was very kind,
humble, gentle, and pretty

247
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,828
in middle school.

248
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,712
Why are you laughing?

249
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,008
-You don't believe me?
-I do.

250
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,053
I can tell you don't.

251
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,931
I do believe you. Eat up.

252
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,481
What are they asking us to do?

253
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:27,359
They want us to tell them
who's better-looking between them.

254
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,319
Now that you guys hang out,

255
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,987
did your ugliness rub off on him?

256
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:32,948
What happened to you?

257
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:36,243
Don't think of him as your brother.
Please be objective.

258
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:39,371
Put aside your personal grudges
against me and be fair.

259
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,084
I would pick Mr. Park.

260
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,835
Really? Are you sure?

261
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,338
-Did you just pick me?
-What's wrong with you?

262
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,966
Did he threaten you when I wasn't here?

263
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,301
Did he say he'd fire you?
Was it a power trip?

264
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,137
If that's the case, just tell me.
I'll fire him.

265
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,432
Are you serious?
Is there something between you two?

266
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,684
-You were here?
-Yes.

267
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,019
Hello.

268
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,854
-It's been a while.
-Yes, indeed.

269
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:08,358
We last met
on Jeong-beom's death anniversary.

270
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:11,611
Yes. Young-do has been telling me
how you've been doing.

271
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,447
-Everything is good with you, right?
-Yes.

272
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,993
Gosh. What happened here?
I think that's a bite mark.

273
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:21,621
I just had an incident. It wasn't serious.

274
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,706
I see.

275
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,751
Young-do, can you stop by later?
I have to ask you something.

276
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,295
Sure.

277
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,922
-I'll see you around then.
-See you around.

278
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,467
Please sit.

279
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,268
Why are you staring at me?

280
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:44,853
I don't know.

281
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:48,398
I envy you for having a friend
working in the same building.

282
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,066
Am I jealous?

283
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:54,195
Look who's talking. You're always
with Detective Choi and Detective Park.

284
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:57,532
Right. But how come
you were never jealous?

285
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,617
What would you like?

286
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,704
I want shaved ice in a cup

287
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,498
with cookie crumbles
and a croffle on the side.

288
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,919
I thought you'd prefer
a multigrain shake for dessert.

289
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,674
Do you know what an IVL is?

290
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:15,967
Iced vanilla latte.

291
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,302
Everyone knows that.

292
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,220
Oh, dear.

293
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,517
By the way,

294
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:28,146
I wonder how a vet got bitten by a dog.

295
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,150
Gosh. Aren't you a pretty dog?

296
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,568
You look so pretty.

297
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,696
What did you say?

298
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,114
What's your name?

299
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,033
You don't want to tell me your name?

300
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,079
What did you just say?

301
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,122
Look at the dog. It's a beautiful dog.

302
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,754
What are you doing? Why are you biting me?

303
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,506
I need help!

304
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,387
HA-NEUL VETERINARY CLINIC

305
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:20,073
KANG DA-JEONG

306
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,122
Hello?

307
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,666
Hello. This is Kang Da-jeong.

308
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,294
I called you earlier,
but you didn't answer.

309
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:38,716
Well, I called to apologize.

310
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:42,011
I never got to hear
what you wanted to say.

311
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,682
And I thought I should explain to you

312
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,935
why I acted that way.

313
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,353
No, there's no need.

314
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,440
-I'm busy. I must go.
-Okay--

315
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,711
He died,

316
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,965
but a guy who looks just like him
showed up?

317
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,801
If it's true that I was duped,

318
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:25,388
it means the guy who put a hit on me

319
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,892
is still alive roaming the streets
like nothing happened.

320
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,353
If it's true that I was duped,

321
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,399
that means…

322
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,234
PURE MURDER

323
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:45,033
I was fooled by an 18-year-old.

324
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,204
An 18-year-old?

325
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:53,082
The one who beat you
was a high school student?

326
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:56,586
His palms were

327
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,755
peeled off.

328
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,467
What did he say?

329
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,470
He's not making any sense.
He's still in critical condition.

330
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,807
I did write down everything he told me.

331
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,019
FINGERPRINT ANALYSIS REPORT

332
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,729
No fingerprints?

333
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,981
He probably wore gloves. Right?

334
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,818
He couldn't have wiped
his prints on every shard.

335
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,238
No. I bet he didn't wear any gloves.

336
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,241
He said the culprit's palms
were peeled off.

337
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,870
Let's eat before we go back.

338
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:34,624
ATTACHED INFORMATION

339
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,669
Some guy gave me 50,000 won and told me…

340
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:41,339
Can I see your palms?

341
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,008
Sir.

342
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:48,555
I know this sounds crazy,
but I think I know who this is.

343
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,516
He's the guy who put

344
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,186
Choi Jeong-min's suicide note
in the locker at Yongsan Station.

345
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,941
Yes. This guy left it on the table.

346
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,735
So Dr. Chase didn't bring the paper rose.

347
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,529
When she asked him about it,

348
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,948
it looked like he had
no idea about the paper rose.

349
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,617
This is from the camera outside the cafe.

350
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:11,911
Watch this part.

351
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,921
And this footage captured the culprit
that stabbed Detective Park.

352
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,802
I think it's the same guy.

353
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,931
So you believe the guy who stabbed
Detective Park left this paper rose here?

354
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,851
Can we send this to Cheonu Police Station

355
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,728
and ask for the forensic gait analysis?

356
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:37,770
We should.

357
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,522
Choi Jeong-min's case was closed.

358
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,025
But Detective Park's case is ongoing.
I'll call now.

359
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,569
GUGU BUILDING

360
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,113
No, he's too busy, so he can't do it.

361
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,281
Okay.

362
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,867
Hold on. I forgot something.
I'll call you later.

363
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,871
I'm here. Do I have to wait long?

364
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,456
No. I'm done grocery shopping.

365
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,959
I have lettuce and perilla leaves.
Make yourself useful and wash them.

366
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,295
Don't half-ass it.
Soak them for five minutes

367
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,422
and wash both sides under a running tap.

368
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:07,300
Fine. I'll wash thoroughly.

369
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,469
You'll love the meat I bought just now.

370
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:12,347
It's beautifully marbled
like the view from Mount Seorak.

371
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,848
Gosh. I can't wait.

372
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,142
Hurry up. You're killing me.

373
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,144
Gosh.

374
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,694
Excuse me.
Are you going to the fourth floor?

375
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,073
Yes. Why do you ask?

376
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:35,411
Then do you know Ms. Kang well?

377
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,663
Ms. Kang?

378
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,586
Good afternoon.

379
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,630
I can't say it is.

380
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,346
What was that?

381
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,309
You couldn't catch that?

382
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,436
Yes, I missed that. But what about you?

383
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,481
You already reached
your nonsense quota for the day.

384
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,483
-Get the jacket and leave.
-Gosh.

385
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,446
Ms. Kang is cold, not sweet.

386
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,616
She's heartless, cold, and cruel.
Is she just your neighbor now?

387
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,867
How could she do that?

388
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:18,579
Your crazy act won't work.
No more TV appearances now.

389
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,207
It's because
you didn't kiss her when she came over.

390
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,918
But still. You guys are
still neighbors. She's so cruel!

391
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,171
Go and ask Ha-neul to play with you.
Or go play at the cafe.

392
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,297
Listen.

393
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:32,218
-A man just walked up to the fourth floor.
-Maybe they're friends.

394
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,429
-Then why wash up there?
-People wash hands.

395
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:40,101
If you're this calm and sane,
we can't have this conversation.

396
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,645
Get out.

397
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,313
-On the fourth floor…
-Get out.

398
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,982
-Come on.
-Get out.

399
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,495
PSYCHIATRIST JU YOUNG-DO

400
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,552
I did meet him.

401
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:17,263
I did, but he was so weird.

402
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,349
Mr. Ju seems so dumb.

403
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,643
Can a guy like him be a doctor?

404
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,520
Right.

405
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,481
He's weird.

406
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,441
Why is she seeing him?

407
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,109
Exactly.

408
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:35,031
-Thanks.
-Enjoy your food.

409
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,245
Hello. I'm Ju Young-do.

410
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,290
Pardon?

411
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,001
Right. I'm Ju Young-do.

412
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,086
But…

413
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,008
Then, is Seung-won your patient?

414
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,303
Oh, him? No, he's my…

415
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:04,310
Well, I don't think that's important.

416
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,187
But he's not a bad guy.

417
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,397
He's your friend.

418
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,068
Can I ask you a few questions?

419
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,237
I might overstep the mark
when we just met.

420
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,156
Sure. It's fine.

421
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,325
In return, you can ask me questions too.

422
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,661
Sure, I will.

423
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,793
-What year were you born in?
-In 1984.

424
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:29,836
JU YOUNG-DO

425
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,170
When is your birthday?

426
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,922
-May 10.
-What time?

427
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,760
I think I was born early in the morning.
But why do you ask?

428
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,011
I see. Early morning.

429
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,722
I have a mission.

430
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,016
I see.

431
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,186
-What's your MBTI type?
-It's ENFJ.

432
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,522
-Do you drink?
-No.

433
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,982
-Do you smoke?
-No.

434
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,358
-Work-life balance?
-Not possible.

435
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,860
-Your favorite color?
-Black.

436
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,653
-Your favorite season?
-Winter.

437
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,446
-Do you like soccer?
-I do.

438
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,656
-Which team?
-Barcelona.

439
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:05,371
-Do you like baseball?
-I do.

440
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,539
-Which team?
-The Twins.

441
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,336
-Do you like music?
-Yes.

442
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,838
-How about movies?
-I like them.

443
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,756
-Traveling?
-I like traveling.

444
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,091
-And my sister?
-I like her.

445
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,342
-Why?
-Pardon?

446
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,011
-Why on earth?
-Pardon?

447
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,762
Can you take a punch?

448
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,347
Pardon?

449
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,101
-You're back.
-Pardon?

450
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,021
Hey, Ms. Kang.

451
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,898
I washed the vegetables thoroughly.

452
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,567
Why are you two…

453
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,321
We met in front of the building.

454
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,874
-You don't drink, so…
-Thanks.

455
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,001
Here.

456
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,260
Want to hear something interesting?

457
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:06,057
If this is about how handsome
you think you are,

458
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,517
I'm going to grill you, not the meat.

459
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,901
Don't say anything stupid.

460
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:22,698
I have these two customers
at the bar I work at. A man and a woman.

461
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,076
They come twice every month.

462
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,286
They drink and talk.

463
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,664
-So what?
-But they are siblings.

464
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,540
No way.

465
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,001
Why is that weird?

466
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,631
If they drink twice every month,
they aren't alcoholics.

467
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,633
When he gets drunk and trips,

468
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:43,094
the older sister
helps her brother stand up.

469
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:46,055
She didn't step on him when he tripped?

470
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,974
-She even helped him.
-She must be crazy.

471
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,101
The guy even brings water for his sister.

472
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,436
-They can't be related.
-But they are.

473
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,397
Maybe they belong in a Greek tragedy.

474
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,358
Then how do siblings normally behave?

475
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,694
If they run into each other,
they look away.

476
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,822
Or they keep their meeting
as brief as possible.

477
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:05,491
"Get lost. Get out.
Should I go? Or will you?"

478
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,452
Come on. Hold up.

479
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,204
You're unbelievable.

480
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,247
What?

481
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,083
How could you give all the meat to him?

482
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,627
Oh, dear. Here.

483
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,506
I just thought that you didn't like meat.

484
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:22,967
My nickname is Meat Lover.
You gave me that nickname.

485
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,846
When I was young,
I envied kids who had older sisters.

486
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,308
When I was young,
I dreamed of being an only child.

487
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,892
I wanted to be the youngest.

488
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,186
And you crushed my dream when I was three.

489
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,647
My dream was already crushed
when I was born.

490
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,608
-Eat up.
-Go ahead.

491
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:45,197
-I'm going to eat this.
-Put that down.

492
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,146
BANG HYEON-U
BANG HYEON-JEONG

493
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,363
MUN MI-RAN

494
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:28,699
-Who's Mun Mi-ran?
-That's me.

495
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,618
That's your name?

496
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,912
Then did you think my name was Mun Pizza?

497
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:33,829
Of course.

498
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,832
My name is Kim Pa-jeon
because I run a jeon restaurant.

499
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,544
Why don't you write your name?

500
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,005
I'm good. I wrote my kids' names.

501
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,300
That's what kids hate the most.

502
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,095
Why look after your kids first?
Take care of yourself first.

503
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,389
How can they be happy when you're not?

504
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,809
Step aside. What's your name?

505
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,727
Gosh. You don't have to write my name.

506
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:57,978
-Kim Chi-jeon?
-What?

507
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,355
-Kim Yuk-jeon?
-What?

508
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,273
-Kim Zucchini-jeon?
-Gosh.

509
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,026
-Kim.
-Kim.

510
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,028
-Yeon-a.
-Yeon…

511
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,784
Gosh. Your name doesn't suit you at all.

512
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,370
That's my real name.
Like that figure skater.

513
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,210
Didn't you tell me
you were going to some church last week?

514
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:26,090
I'm going here and there
to get every help I can get.

515
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,007
Gosh.

516
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:30,052
Because I've been having
weird dreams lately.

517
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,346
What kind of dream?
I can interpret dreams.

518
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,390
It's nothing serious.

519
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,477
I just keep seeing someone
I haven't seen for decades,

520
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:44,191
so I wonder if I've been having it
too easy these days.

521
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,360
You'll meet that person soon.

522
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,781
-Really?
-Yes.

523
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,038
Gosh.

524
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,124
They hung a lot of lanterns.

525
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,376
I guess people have a lot to wish for.

526
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,715
If I hang a lantern there,
will that chase away my dream?

527
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,222
Can I just write anything I want here?

528
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,808
You can write a name and an address.

529
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:22,229
Can I write down the name of someone
who I don't know is still alive?

530
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:25,649
You can just write down whatever you want.

531
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:05,189
KANG YUN-CHAN, KEEP YOUR PROMISE

532
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,482
Kang Yun-chan.

533
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,068
Keep your promise.

534
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,044
Let's end it here.

535
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,797
I can't kill you,

536
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,716
so kill me with that.

537
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,219
If you can't even do that,

538
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,138
promise me this.

539
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,058
Don't ever look for me or the kids.

540
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,685
Never look for us.

541
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,354
Promise me that.

542
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,277
KANG YUN-CHAN, KEEP YOUR PROMISE

543
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:31,692
KANG DA-JEONG, MUN MI-RAN, KANG TAE-JEONG

544
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:34,778
Oh, right.

545
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,656
I showed him
your photo from middle school.

546
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,118
What photo?

547
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:44,079
You know the one
with those big, ugly glasses.

548
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:47,499
But his reaction…

549
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,300
Back then, her nickname
was Monkey with Glasses.

550
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,218
The eye surgery was a godsend.

551
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:01,138
-She looks so funny, right?
-Yes. She looks pretty.

552
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,724
-What?
-Pardon?

553
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:04,642
What?

554
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:06,435
What?

555
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,771
He said she looked pretty in that photo?

556
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:09,980
Before we ate,

557
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,524
I asked a whole bunch
of useless questions.

558
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,360
And I wasn't polite either.

559
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,696
But he didn't get mad at me
and answered every question.

560
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,990
That just proves he's a keeper.

561
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,826
What did she say
when you told her about it?

562
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:23,827
That's important.

563
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:27,164
Well, that creeped me out the most.

564
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,124
She…

565
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,876
He said you were pretty.

566
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,338
I thought I misheard him.

567
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,132
But he really said that you were pretty.

568
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,601
She was shy? Da-jeong?

569
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:50,646
That can't be.

570
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:52,731
Exactly. That's why it was so creepy.

571
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,358
Anyway, based on what you saw,

572
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,276
nothing bad happened to her, right?

573
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,112
-Yes.
-I almost forgot.

574
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,406
Did you get his time and date of birth?

575
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:03,033
Yes. But he doesn't know the exact time.

576
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:14,920
Hello.

577
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,802
I hate his entire team.

578
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,638
Yesterday, Dr. Bale didn't think
the maid was watching him,

579
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:26,515
and did the slant-eye gesture.

580
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,308
He did that to our maid?

581
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,310
To Dr. Chase.

582
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,771
Right when Dr. Chase
turned around after they talked.

583
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:37,067
One of them is a racist bully.

584
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,195
And the other one is
a victim I kind of feel bad for.

585
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,781
But he's unpleasantly tall and skinny.

586
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:02,009
I'm in front of the hotel. Can we meet?

587
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,639
Who is it? Who texted you
right when you're getting off work?

588
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,349
Shouldn't you be at the desk?

589
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,519
That brand is for men's clothing.

590
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,314
-What's inside? Can I look?
-No. Get back to work.

591
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:16,940
Bye. See you tomorrow.

592
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:22,070
I want to get off work.
I'm good at that too.

593
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:02,152
MEAL OF THE DAY
MINIMUM ORDER: 2

594
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:05,280
If it's okay with you,
I would like to have that.

595
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,409
The meal of the day?

596
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:12,120
I rarely have
Korean food with other people.

597
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:13,705
I see.

598
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,833
You must not have a lot of friends here.

599
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:17,918
None at all.

600
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:21,630
Because to me, Seoul is a foreign city.

601
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,301
You're right.

602
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:29,596
When I went to New York,
I had no one to eat with,

603
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,515
so I had burgers every day.

604
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:54,663
Are you trying to get
the fishbone stuck in your throat?

605
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,415
Unless you want

606
00:47:56,498 --> 00:48:00,627
to accompany me to the afterlife,
chew your food before you swallow it.

607
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,840
Here. Eat up, you punk.

608
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:07,050
Gosh. Isn't it good?

609
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,385
-It's good.
-Enjoy it.

610
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:10,512
-Thank you. Sure.
-Come again.

611
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:16,893
They say your habits show
how you've lived.

612
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:21,023
Perhaps, that old lady
must have had a rough life.

613
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:22,858
So other people

614
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:27,112
just understand her
no matter how rude she is to them?

615
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,241
They probably think about

616
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,202
her intention, not what she said.

617
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:39,625
Try to think about
what she said earlier in a good light.

618
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:43,920
"Why do you eat so fast?

619
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,922
I'm worried that
you might get indigestion.

620
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,549
Eat more if you want."

621
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,140
Hurry up and eat.

622
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:58,185
Who's playing now
instead of eating your food?

623
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:07,694
Are you always this considerate
and understanding of others?

624
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,281
Not always.

625
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,492
Although I want to be.

626
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,453
That was the third time.

627
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:21,667
The third time
you'd looked at me like that.

628
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,252
In front of the elevator,

629
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:28,465
at the pub, and the cafe.

630
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:34,262
I thought I didn't scare you anymore.

631
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:38,225
You still feel
uncomfortable around me, right?

632
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:42,646
I'm sorry.

633
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:48,151
I should have explained to you right away

634
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:51,905
why I was so shocked that night.

635
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:53,281
But I just left.

636
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,827
I wasn't fishing for an apology.

637
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,328
I just wanted to know

638
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:01,623
if you could also understand how I feel.

639
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,084
That's what I'm asking.

640
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:10,757
If…

641
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:14,636
I want to have another meal with you…

642
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,223
and if I say…

643
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,728
I'm curious about you,

644
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,982
can you understand that?

645
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,946
Or is what I'm saying right now

646
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,949
also scaring you?

647
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:51,566
YOU…

648
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:00,534
Goodness.

649
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:02,577
Gosh. I'm sorry.

650
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:35,986
Can I see your palms?

651
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,564
There's a suspicious man
loitering outside the cafe.

652
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:17,319
Was it the guy who looked
just like Da-jeong's stalker?

653
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:20,822
No. I've never seen him before.

654
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:24,117
Is he the guy who left the rose?

655
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,869
No way.

656
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:27,829
I'll go and look.

657
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:30,332
-By yourself?
-Yes. I'll be fine.

658
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:37,172
Excuse me. Hold on.

659
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:46,681
It's been a while.

660
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,605
Why are you here?

661
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:57,567
I was in the neighborhood for work.
So I was just passing by.

662
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:00,070
Rae-yeong told me

663
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:03,531
that he saw you
when he went on a blind date.

664
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:09,412
-You got a haircut.
-What? Yes.

665
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:11,706
You're not

666
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,084
performing in plays anymore?

667
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,587
I need to make a living. I'm getting old.

668
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:21,925
I got a job.

669
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:31,309
Are you going to have coffee?

670
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:35,772
-Eun-ha, can we talk?
-If you're not here for coffee,

671
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:38,984
please just leave.

672
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:41,861
I have to make a living too.

673
00:54:56,668 --> 00:55:00,046
If you were going to
give up on acting eventually…

674
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:05,093
and could wear those stupid suits
like everyone else

675
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:07,220
and put up with a boring job,

676
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,889
why were you never willing
to give it up then?

677
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:11,891
Why…

678
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:15,645
Why was I the first thing you gave up?

679
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:20,233
Why didn't you tell me to wait?
Then I would have waited for you.

680
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:21,901
Why did you just break up with me?

681
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,862
Why did you have to come

682
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:26,156
looking exhausted
and beg me to let you go?

683
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:28,199
I couldn't even tell you I'd wait.

684
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,577
After everything, you come to me now

685
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,912
and tell me that was
the best you could do?

686
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,789
You did that for me?

687
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,918
Don't kid yourself.

688
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:41,254
You just

689
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,840
didn't have faith in me.

690
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:49,387
You thought that I was only capable
of selfishly receiving love from you

691
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:53,391
and that you were the only one giving love
in our relationship.

692
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:56,936
Answer me.

693
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,564
Am I wrong?

694
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:02,484
No, you're not wrong.

695
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:09,032
That's what I was going to tell him.

696
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,827
But I didn't.

697
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,205
It's pointless.

698
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,084
Good.

699
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:24,047
-Let's sit down and talk.
-No.

700
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,632
I'm done ranting.

701
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:28,468
Da-jeong was in a meeting.
I just needed to vent.

702
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:30,553
Sorry.

703
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,057
Thank you. Come again.

704
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:37,477
I'll get going.

705
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,687
Okay. Bye.

706
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:41,773
Bye.

707
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:52,242
I found this on the doorknob this morning.

708
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:53,910
But I forgot to give it to you.

709
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:55,120
Okay.

710
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:05,338
No need to be alarmed at the paper rose.

711
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,507
I folded it.

712
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:10,218
Are you all ready, munchkins?

713
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:13,012
-Yes, teacher.
-All right. First,

714
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:15,515
fold the colored paper in half like this.

715
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:23,148
After that, fold it in half again
and put the two bottom corners

716
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,650
right on top of the two upper corners.

717
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:27,402
Again, fold it in half.

718
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:30,572
Do the same for the remaining side.

719
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:33,032
You just have to
fold it four times like this.

720
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:36,119
-You're done, right?
-No. Wait. Hold on.

721
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:37,120
Ta-da.

722
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:39,289
I actually folded mine in advance.

723
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,332
Isn't that easy?

724
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,543
Munchkins. Did you all--

725
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:46,171
Are you kidding me?

726
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:47,464
Start over.

727
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:50,425
I'm not ready yet. Let's try this again.

728
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:52,802
-Again.
-Are you all ready…

729
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:58,183
Once babies touch something hot
and get startled for the first time,

730
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:01,811
they get scared
just hearing the word "hot."

731
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:06,566
I read that this warning
comes from the amygdala in our brain.

732
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:11,779
But there's the hippocampus
behind the amygdala

733
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,448
that stores new memories.

734
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,743
It means if we make
a lot of happy memories

735
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,745
and put the hippocampus to work,

736
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:22,749
we can cover up
scary memories with happy memories…

737
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,042
Right.

738
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:26,419
I forgot you were a psychiatrist.

739
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,507
Anyway, starting today, my hippocampus

740
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,926
will remember a paper rose as such.

741
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:38,181
"It's nothing to be scared about.

742
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:42,310
Actually, it's like having a lollipop."

743
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:53,488
Bye.

744
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:01,246
I'm going on
a three-day business trip tomorrow.

745
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,582
And I'll get off work late tonight.

746
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,834
So I'll leave it here.

747
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:11,589
I hope the shirt looks nice on you.

748
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,592
If it doesn't,

749
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:17,804
I'll rip it into pieces again.

750
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:20,682
How do I end this letter?

751
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,685
Anyway, that's it.

752
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:25,812
Kang Da-jeong.

753
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:02,473
To avoid hurting her, I pushed her
to the other side of the world.

754
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:05,226
But she folded the world in half
to get close to me.

755
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,521
How come I can never push you away?

756
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:11,774
How come I can't control myself with you?

757
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,069
"Run away."

758
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,322
"Don't run away."

759
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:20,241
"Please don't get close."

760
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,869
"Please don't go too far."

761
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:29,375
I try to cast absurd spells
that can never work, but in the end,

762
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:34,422
she makes me fold
the world in half and run to her.

763
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:47,060
-Can I come in?
-Yes.

764
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:49,228
Is something wrong?

765
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,356
I need to talk to you.

766
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:53,733
-Are you going somewhere?
-No.

767
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,110
Yes.

768
01:00:57,362 --> 01:01:00,573
I don't have plans,
but Cheol-do wanted to talk to me.

769
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:01,741
I see.

770
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:04,577
-Will it take long?
-No.

771
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:06,871
I'll be back soon.

772
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:10,375
Do you mind waiting here for a while?

773
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:14,420
Sure. I'll wait.

774
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:31,229
You're here.

775
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:33,648
If it's not urgent,
can we do this another day?

776
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:35,942
-Why am I like this?
-What?

777
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:38,653
My father is coming back.

778
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:41,781
I see. He's coming to Korea?

779
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,951
I wonder if there's anyone else
who's as scared as I am

780
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,162
of their own father at my age.

781
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:51,666
That just crossed my mind.

782
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:53,459
Hey…

783
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:56,462
Why are you thinking like that?

784
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,423
Hey, don't do that.

785
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,719
I'm really sorry, Cheol-do.

786
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:04,679
But I really have somewhere to be.

787
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:06,055
Right.

788
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,641
You're always so busy and work so hard.

789
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:11,811
How come I'm not like you?

790
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,356
I want to be resolute and determined too.

791
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:19,986
Being relaxed isn't a bad thing.

792
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:23,740
So why don't we talk about this--

793
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:26,534
How come God blessed me
only with good looks?

794
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:29,203
Seeing as you're talking crap,
I think I can go now.

795
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:30,663
I guess I'm scared.

796
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:35,793
I'm scared that I might fail
even when I'm trying my best.

797
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,672
Then it wouldn't be my choice.
I would just be incapable.

798
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:57,607
The pot's looking fine.

799
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:00,443
Yes. I give it a lot of delicious food.

800
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:01,944
I feed it Coke and coffee.

801
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:06,324
She really fed it Coke and coffee.

802
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,251
Stay strong, Hippocampus.

803
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:19,086
Hang in there.

804
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:19,647
I'm sure

805
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,193
you don't have faith in me.

806
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:34,787
You think
I'm only capable of receiving love.

807
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:39,250
And you think…

808
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:43,963
only you're capable of giving love.

809
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,093
Isn't that what you think of us?

810
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:00,438
Ms. Kang.

811
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,191
Ms. Kang.

812
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:12,992
Ms. Kang, don't leave.

813
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:01,958
Don't leave.

814
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:09,835
When I suddenly moved
from Seoul to Gangneung,

815
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:14,590
I thought I flew there
because a rhino had slammed into me.

816
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:18,594
But it wasn't like I was bleeding,

817
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:21,263
so I got up and started walking again.

818
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:23,474
Do you feel that way nowadays?

819
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:25,518
No.

820
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:27,144
Because now,

821
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:29,563
I have legs.

822
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:31,774
You're right.

823
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,944
You have legs now.

824
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:39,031
