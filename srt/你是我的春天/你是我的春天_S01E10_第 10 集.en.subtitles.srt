1
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,150
Don't leave.

2
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,709
You needed to speak with me?

3
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,128
Oh, that…

4
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,256
I forgot.

5
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,845
You're going on a business trip? Where to?

6
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,013
Busan.

7
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,641
-Do you have to go?
-Yes.

8
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,101
Right.

9
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,022
-For three days?
-Yes.

10
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,609
I see.

11
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:16,696
I should go.

12
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,617
Right… Right now? Where?

13
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,410
To bed.

14
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,665
Already?

15
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,168
I think we're rushing it.

16
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,851
EPISODE 10

17
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,897
Are you studying Korean?
Should I check your spelling?

18
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,609
Go away.

19
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,278
-"Go away."
-You wrote swear words, didn't you? Fine.

20
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,197
You're having jjajangmyeon, right?

21
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:04,202
-Jjajangmyeon?
-Let's see this!

22
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,329
-Give it back!
-"I've grown to like this man

23
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,456
-Give it back!
-who's been taking care of me."

24
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,642
Go home already, will you?

25
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,185
What are you doing?

26
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,020
You shouldn't have done that.

27
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,188
Give it back.

28
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:40,196
What kind of princess has no dignity
and kisses whomever she wants?

29
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,906
We missed it.

30
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,700
It's not our fault you couldn't kiss.

31
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,702
Why stop us from watching the kiss scene?

32
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,203
-Shut up.
-It wasn't me.

33
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,621
You shut up.

34
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,623
It was my lips.

35
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,750
-Damn it!
-Damn…

36
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,211
Do your lips have
a mind of their own or something?

37
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,337
That's possible.

38
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,881
Do they move around as they please?

39
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,259
I believe so.

40
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,845
What do you mean?

41
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,015
You came onto me.

42
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,850
Can't you see this?

43
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,651
If there's one thing to blame,
it's that I am too beautiful.

44
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,404
Forget about it.

45
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,489
"Forget"?

46
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,325
How?

47
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,452
How can I? It happened just now.

48
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,996
Whatever. Take responsibility for it.

49
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm afraid that's not possible.

50
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,085
It's not possible? Wait.

51
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,797
Why won't you take responsibility for it?

52
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,800
In this day and age,
there's something you must say

53
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,927
after an impromptu kiss.

54
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,471
This is your line, so listen up.

55
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,597
Here it is.

56
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,600
"Should I apologize

57
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:52,727
or confess my love?"

58
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,192
"Apologize"?

59
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,570
I suddenly feel famished.

60
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,364
Go cook some ramyeon.

61
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,617
Ramyeon? Ra…

62
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,802
Do you know
there's Youngdo Bridge in Busan?

63
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,179
Why do you think
my parents gave me this name?

64
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,848
Don't tell me
you're going to tell that joke.

65
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,643
It's because they found me
under that bridge.

66
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,852
Oh, dear.

67
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,605
How's the hotel?

68
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,652
-Hello.
-Hello.

69
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:47,657
I finally understand why moms prefer
eating food that's cooked by others.

70
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,574
Goodness.

71
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,701
I love being a guest at a hotel.

72
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,664
You sure love going to hotels.

73
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,170
People might misunderstand it
if they hear that.

74
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,340
You're the only one who thinks that way.

75
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,426
This must be why
people think you're flirtatious.

76
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,430
Ms. Kang.

77
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,144
Right.

78
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,280
I wasn't going to tell you,

79
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:32,243
but I saw you standing
in front of my door yesterday.

80
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,539
SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN PSYCHOPATHS AND SOCIOPATHS

81
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,999
KEYBOARD CONNECTED TO PHONE

82
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,376
I misheard you.

83
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,336
I thought you had invited me in.

84
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,132
This must be why

85
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,093
-people think you're so flirtatious.
-I had no idea.

86
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,012
How could you date that guy?

87
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,181
I know he's handsome,

88
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,683
but how could you date
someone who choked you…

89
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:07,987
WHY WE MUST SAY "NO"

90
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,365
"I visited Busan
after watching Train to Busan.

91
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,909
But why are there no zombies?

92
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,911
I don't like this hotel."

93
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,539
Some guests actually say this.
You don't believe me?

94
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,750
Then try working here.

95
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,043
Now…

96
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:25,421
-Should we prepare zombies for them?
-What time will you arrive here on Friday?

97
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,508
-The train will arrive there at 4:30 p.m.
-If they are rude to you,

98
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,134
-Over.
-just bite them like a zombie.

99
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,470
"We want some zombies here.

100
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,679
Give us an upgrade…"

101
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,139
How's the weather there? Over.

102
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,975
Some even want a female concierge.
They make strange requests.

103
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,937
-I've been indoors all day. Over.
-Where do we draw the line?

104
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,063
Check the hotel rules?

105
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,814
-Oh, dear. Over.
-No.

106
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,650
You must ask yourself

107
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:49,195
if you're eating away at yourself.

108
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:54,492
First, we'll begin our investigation
around the rest areas

109
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,661
and soup kitchens near Yongsan Station.

110
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,037
As you know,

111
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,081
he changes his appearance.

112
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:03,834
So don't narrow it down to homeless
individuals. Focus on this description.

113
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,086
Yes, sir.

114
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,255
We're from Pungji Police Station.

115
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:11,342
I'm certain that this man has something
to do with Choi Jeong-min.

116
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:16,764
This case in itself is important.
But this is our last chance to investigate

117
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,225
Choi Jeong-min's case,
so let's do our best.

118
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,851
HA-NEUL VETERINARY CLINIC
DIRECTOR SEO HA-NEUL

119
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,771
You're right. We can't read their minds.

120
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:27,984
But if neutering or spaying was harmful

121
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,777
or life-shortening,

122
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,696
vets wouldn't be able to recommend it.

123
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,864
Many studies argue

124
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,492
that doing so
actually helps them live longer.

125
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,202
Right?

126
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,010
Do you treat dogs too?

127
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,888
No. I treat people.

128
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,391
-I work on the third floor.
-Can I ask you something?

129
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,559
Sure.

130
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,394
What is a "virgin"?

131
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:16,324
That must be your dog, right?

132
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,704
If not, where did you learn that?

133
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,747
It's in here.

134
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,628
"Psychological test.
Are you a relationship virgin?"

135
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,339
I see.

136
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:35,301
My job is listening to people,

137
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,762
so I know about this very well.

138
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:41,182
Those tests lack validity and credibility.

139
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,767
Don't believe them.

140
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,435
Then is it all a lie?

141
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,522
I wouldn't put it that way.

142
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,900
It's the Barnum effect.

143
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,862
They set information that can be applied
to many people as the answers

144
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,073
so that the readers may delude themselves

145
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,783
into thinking it's about them.

146
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:00,660
Here.

147
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,330
Look at the questions.

148
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,331
Question one.

149
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,376
"Breaking up with someone
out of love is understandable."

150
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,921
This is definitely true.

151
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,925
Question two. "I believe they deserve

152
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,511
someone better than me."

153
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,304
This is true too.

154
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,849
"If there's a possibility
that I'm a hindrance to them,

155
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,559
I must leave them right away."

156
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,397
This is very true as well.

157
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,276
Okay. "Everyone around me knows
when I have a crush on someone."

158
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,404
This is…

159
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,656
I don't think this is very true.

160
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,074
Are you sure?

161
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,453
"Congratulations.

162
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,872
You are definitely a relationship virgin.

163
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,458
Your dating IQ is 57.

164
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,460
That's between those of a dog and a pig."

165
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,922
Like I mentioned before,
these tests lack credibility.

166
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:59,385
"If there were a fool who'd tell
their crush they should remain friends,

167
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,303
it would be you.

168
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,763
Believe it or not,

169
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:06,267
you'd even be willing
to marry someone for their sake."

170
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,646
Oh, dear.

171
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,901
DOCTOR'S OFFICE

172
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,197
Let me borrow this for a minute.

173
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,328
WE LOVE YOU, AHN GA-YEONG

174
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,123
WE LOVE YOU FOREVER

175
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,625
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

176
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,335
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

177
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,713
-I hope you enjoy them. Eat up.
-This looks good.

178
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,507
-Thank you.
-It's on me.

179
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,301
Okay. Thank you.

180
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,472
It's really delicious.

181
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,266
Hey, this is really tasty.

182
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:50,436
By the way, I didn't know
I had a fan club in Africa.

183
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,770
Me neither.

184
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,817
I'm too darn popular.

185
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,236
At this rate, I may do
a meet-and-greet on the moon.

186
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,080
Excuse me for a minute.

187
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,207
-Okay.
-Sure.

188
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,752
Hey, it's me.

189
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,921
Hello, princess.

190
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,466
I'm the prince of Botswana,
the president of your African fan club.

191
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,012
What? Was it you? My gosh.

192
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:28,057
Only a prince is worthy
of sending gifts to a princess.

193
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,310
No wonder the pizza is tasty.

194
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,145
Are you at the airport?

195
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,481
I'm still on the way.
There's a traffic jam.

196
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,900
By the way, why the prince of Botswana?

197
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:42,112
One of their princes
fell in love and did something remarkable.

198
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,573
He put up with racism,

199
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,785
social status differences,
and people's objection.

200
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,579
What? Did you even do research?

201
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,290
I saw it on Surprise Mystery TV.

202
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,504
Surprise Mystery TV? Come on.

203
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,463
Goodness.

204
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,969
Okay, my friend. Talk again later.

205
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,273
-Nam-hui, wait.
-Thanks.

206
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,775
Nam-hui! Hold on!

207
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:22,444
-Nam-hui!
-What is it?

208
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:32,288
So there was a reason why
you didn't want to drink with me.

209
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,290
You're seeing someone.

210
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:40,004
What are you talking about?
I was talking to my friend earlier.

211
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,757
He must be a singer,
seeing that he sent that snack truck.

212
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,010
That's absurd.

213
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,179
-How would I know any idol singer?
-He's an idol?

214
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:52,850
That's absurd.

215
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,395
How would I date someone
who's much younger than me?

216
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,480
So he's an idol singer who's much younger.

217
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,026
I was really talking to my friend.

218
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,153
It was a friend. A friend.

219
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,488
Don't you know what a friend is?

220
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,796
You're the prince of Botswana today.
I'll call you right now.

221
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,716
Here we go again.

222
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,599
Yes?

223
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,977
Hello, my prince.
Someone wants to speak with you.

224
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,396
Hello. I'm Kim Nam-hui, the actor.

225
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,273
Hello.

226
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,317
I'm the prince of Botswana.

227
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,945
See? It's verified then, right?

228
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,948
But you're too pretty to be a prince.

229
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,533
-Nam-hui. Don't!
-So?

230
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,077
Can't a prince be pretty?

231
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:57,206
Isn't it okay as long as
the prince becomes a good ruler?

232
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,752
Did the national team pick me
for my looks? Is that why I couldn't win?

233
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,921
Why do people always comment on my looks?

234
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,130
What? Wait.

235
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,633
What was that? Did I do something wrong?

236
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,846
She gets all riled up
whenever someone says she's pretty.

237
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,975
Anyway, I've proven to you
that it was a friend, right?

238
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,726
Fine.

239
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,812
Nam-hui, they want you in ten.

240
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:20,938
That's absurd.

241
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,606
Call me when they're all set.

242
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,567
I'll keep your secret.

243
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,945
But be careful.
There are no secrets in this world.

244
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:28,988
Okay?

245
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,073
Thanks.

246
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,450
Jeez, you're dating
behind everyone's back.

247
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,203
No, I'm not.

248
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:42,376
I'll make sure to finish
the slapping scene in one take.

249
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,253
It won't hurt.

250
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,214
-Okay.
-Thanks.

251
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,926
You better keep your promise.

252
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,178
Hello.

253
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,181
Hello, sir.

254
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,397
I've rescheduled your appointments

255
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,191
since your outpatient schedule
for next week got changed.

256
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,777
I've already contacted those
who need prescriptions.

257
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,616
I'm sorry, but give me five minutes.

258
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,410
No, ten. Make that fifteen.

259
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,745
I'll be back.

260
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,913
But…

261
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,458
Where is he going in a hurry?

262
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,336
I doubt he's going somewhere far.

263
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,841
Right. I need to tell him
about the repair work schedule.

264
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:36,555
And after the repair work, the third
and fourth floors may become one.

265
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,438
Hey.

266
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,691
-Hi.
-Give that to me.

267
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,454
I meant your suitcase.

268
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,622
Oh, my gosh!

269
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:06,877
You can give me that too.

270
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,338
Give what?

271
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,507
Have you forgotten about our bet?

272
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,550
That's mine.

273
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,012
You never forget about that bet.

274
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,389
Fine. Take it.

275
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,101
Hey, you're back.

276
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,061
Why are you taking my suitcase?

277
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,522
If you like it so much,

278
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,398
you should get one yourself.

279
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,609
Why would you take mine? Gosh.

280
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,827
You know, I've been looking
for that color.

281
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,204
If you find a similar one, let me know.

282
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,500
What's going on?
Why are they fighting again?

283
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,171
Aren't you tired?

284
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,090
No.

285
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,343
I have to go see my patients.

286
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,762
Are you going to eat anything later today?

287
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,473
I should have dinner,
or I'll be too hungry.

288
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,599
Right.

289
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,145
I'm also thinking
about having dinner later today.

290
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,481
I'll get off work around 7 p.m.

291
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,859
That's strange.

292
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,862
That's when I'll probably get hungry.

293
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,407
Should we eat out?

294
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,118
Do you crave anything?

295
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,458
Or if you're too tired,
should we just order in?

296
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,588
Let's do that.

297
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,174
I'll come up once I'm done.

298
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,009
Okay.

299
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,510
See you later.

300
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,137
Okay.

301
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,852
Thank you for the dress shirt.
This is my thank-you gift.

302
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,440
Advice for Relationship Virgins.

303
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,485
Number one. Change up your style.

304
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:40,239
Do you always have the same hairstyle
and wear the same clothes?

305
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,448
Yes, I do.

306
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,617
Switch up your look,

307
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,410
and it'll spice things up.

308
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,207
Switch up my look?

309
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,251
Number two. Buy a gift for them.

310
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,003
Out of the blue?

311
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,631
Expected gifts are boring.

312
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,093
I think it's too early for that.

313
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:05,305
If you're going to give it to her
sooner or later, it doesn't matter when.

314
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,642
It's not even her birthday.

315
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,478
If you need an excuse
to give your gift, then that's a bribe.

316
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,439
I don't even know what she needs.

317
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,316
Are you looking for a practical gift?

318
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,236
Will you gift rice or money
to someone you love?

319
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:23,240
Start with ordinary items
such as a necklace or a pair of earrings.

320
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,619
I think she'll feel uncomfortable.

321
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,539
Just disregard your stupid opinion.

322
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,249
Did you forget already?

323
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,543
Your dating IQ is 57.

324
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,920
That's between those of a dog and a pig.

325
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:02,738
Ms. Kang.

326
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,242
What? What are you doing here?

327
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,202
What about you?

328
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,121
-Hi.
-Hey.

329
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,373
You guys are here.

330
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,294
They came uninvited.

331
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,425
Weren't you going
to rest at home tomorrow?

332
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,761
Can't you do that while camping with us?

333
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,597
It's not like
we're going to do anything extreme.

334
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,933
That's true, but…

335
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,978
She's right. Let's go have some barbecue

336
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,605
and take a nap.

337
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,982
The charcoal you bought
is going to go to waste.

338
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,318
That's true, but…

339
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,360
But what?

340
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,654
I heard you and Galaxy Park
go camping sometimes.

341
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,740
Do you not want to go camping with me?

342
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:49,159
Do you think
we'll get kicked out since I'm chatty?

343
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:52,245
Or do you think I'll make you do
all the work?

344
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,457
You're greatly mistaken.

345
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,877
Well, I am going to chat,
and I'm terrible at grilling meat.

346
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,754
But I can wash the dishes.

347
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,590
Is it because you have other plans?

348
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,343
No, not at all.

349
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,346
It's not like I want to meet someone else.

350
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,264
I just…

351
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,226
Fine. Just rest at home then.

352
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:17,562
Since I debuted when I was young,
I never got to go camping.

353
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,481
So I really want to go…

354
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,651
but my best friend would rather

355
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,778
gouge her eyes out
than go camping with me.

356
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,613
What can I do?

357
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,826
When did I say that?

358
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,455
Let's go. Let's do it.
Let's go even if it rains.

359
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,083
Really?

360
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,960
Then I should just sleep here tonight.

361
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,336
You have my clothes, right?

362
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,302
Have you always been this dull-witted?

363
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:52,430
Can't you see
we're trying to have a girls' night?

364
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:55,016
I haven't seen her in three days.

365
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,520
So must you barge in here and disturb us?

366
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,441
You're right.

367
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,076
-You're still here.
-I should go.

368
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:25,547
What? Don't tell me…

369
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:33,096
You want to tag along?

370
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,848
My gosh.

371
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:39,019
No wonder you didn't leave.

372
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:42,522
Well, that's…

373
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:46,443
I do finish work around 1 p.m. tomorrow.

374
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:48,528
Come.

375
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,077
Yes, I do want to tag along.

376
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,454
I want to go too.

377
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,998
Should we take my car? I'll drive.

378
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,833
-Sure.
-We'll allow it.

379
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,253
You should've said so from the beginning.

380
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,506
Bye.

381
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,260
Bye.

382
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,900
Will we have a bonfire

383
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,360
and play Duck, Duck, Goose?

384
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:32,197
Are we going back in time?
Who does that these days?

385
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,616
I see. I guess it's old news.

386
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,409
Then what do you guys do?

387
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,749
We're finally here!

388
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,293
Ha-neul already set up everything.

389
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,544
How did he manage?

390
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,215
I need to apologize in advance.

391
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,050
Did you forget the meat?

392
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,929
I had salad for dinner yesterday
to eat a lot of meat today.

393
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,555
Did you leave it in the fridge?

394
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,475
If that's the case, I'll eat you instead.

395
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,852
You showered today, right?

396
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,688
Can I grill you right away?

397
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:08,650
Is something wrong?
Can you not stay? Do you have to go?

398
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,360
That's not it.

399
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,780
Ha-neul's friend is here as well.

400
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,449
Why would his friend come here?

401
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,826
He wasn't invited.

402
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,912
I don't want to camp with a stranger.

403
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,081
He's not a stranger.

404
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,544
Is it…

405
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,257
I told you!

406
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,718
I don't want to hang out
with someone weirder than me!

407
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,304
I don't want anyone to steal my spotlight!

408
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,513
Darn it!

409
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,434
Goodness! Long time no see!
Have you guys been well?

410
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,395
I'm glad to see you all here!

411
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,315
-This way!
-No way.

412
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,066
Hello.

413
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,152
I'm sorry.

414
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,571
I'm so sorry.

415
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,453
This is Unexpected Camping

416
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,539
by Cheon Seung-won, a variety show genius.

417
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,709
As you can see,
I've prepared quite a bit today.

418
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,253
But you all carry this much, right?

419
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,212
TVC VARIETY SHOW PROPS

420
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,342
Now, let's choose today's show.

421
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,010
-Number one, New Journey to the West.
-I'm sorry.

422
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,428
Number two, Amazing Saturday.

423
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:19,554
-Number three, You Quiz On the Block.
-I'm sorry.

424
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:21,222
-Which do you choose?
-I'm sorry.

425
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,479
Can we not do anything?

426
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,356
We came here to relax.

427
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,359
-I second that.
-Me too.

428
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,735
I'm so embarrassed.

429
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,820
Just put your head down like me.

430
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:40,408
Thank you for your lovely feedback.
I'll take them into consideration

431
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,535
and go with New Journey to the West.

432
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,456
I'm loving this energy.

433
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,710
Brad Pitt. Who doesn't know him?

434
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,253
-Yu Jae-seok.
-BTS.

435
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,922
-Dr. Hollow.
-The Goblin.

436
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,548
Wrong! You're disqualified.

437
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,842
He's Gong Yoo, not the Goblin.

438
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,178
Albert Einstein.

439
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:02,514
Bad Choice.

440
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,349
Mark Ruffalo! The Hulk!

441
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,434
Leslie Cheung! Da-jeong's first love!

442
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,353
Oh, my. He's your first love?

443
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,023
Hold on. He's from that K something group.

444
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:14,776
Patrasche from K Mon.

445
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,153
Wrong! You're disqualified!

446
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,780
-His name is Patrick.
-Patrick.

447
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,615
Da-jeong and Ha-neul are disqualified.

448
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,283
You each get 30 penalty points.

449
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,035
Why are you glaring at me?

450
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,496
Did I do something wrong?

451
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,501
It's morning.

452
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,378
Please look up.

453
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,677
Eun-ha is the mafia.

454
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,430
You're the doctor.

455
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,181
And you're the police.

456
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,351
-Who asked him to play?
-Can't we just play?

457
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,811
Did you have to do that?

458
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:50,812
Hey.

459
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,439
-Just go home.
-Go home.

460
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,440
-Go.
-Go.

461
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:54,482
Just leave.

462
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,571
I should've killed you earlier.

463
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,281
Kill him now.

464
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,283
Let's play "pull out" to split into teams.

465
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,659
Don't you know this?

466
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,952
Do you mean "flip it"?

467
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,163
"Sky and ground, divide into teams." This?

468
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,540
"Flip it. You have no choice." It's this.

469
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,460
"Flip it and watch it.
Get 100 slaps and eat poop."

470
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,920
-Eat what?
-Why would you eat that?

471
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,047
That's a ridiculous chant.

472
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,008
Actually, it's similar to my hometown's.

473
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:23,595
"Flip it and be quiet.
Shove the poop into your mouth." Poop.

474
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:25,346
Poop.

475
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,265
-Gosh.
-What's wrong?

476
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,518
I got this. It's…

477
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,395
When you gave this to Bang Yun-hui,

478
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,939
she said she'd shove its cotton
into your mouth.

479
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,191
-Right.
-Bang Yun-hui.

480
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,611
-Teddy bear!
-No.

481
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,237
-A doll!
-That's it!

482
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,323
You gave this to Lee Sang-a.

483
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:46,117
She said she'd choke you
with this if you didn't get lost!

484
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,036
I know! A necklace!

485
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,831
You gave this to Kim Bo-ra,
and she puked right away.

486
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,666
Chocolate! Cake?

487
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,253
-Perfume.
-Time's up. Congratulations.

488
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,345
Did we lose?

489
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,016
We won.

490
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:13,269
Fold a finger
if you've kissed someone in the past week.

491
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,398
What? Just me?

492
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,192
No one else?

493
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,195
If you lie, you'll be cursed.

494
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:25,114
If you lie, you won't be able
to kiss that person ever again.

495
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,366
-Ever?
-Ever.

496
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,118
You're saying you did?

497
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,412
I guess it doesn't have to be true.

498
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,122
Let's just fold ours too.

499
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,959
Then I'll fold mine too.

500
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:40,755
Oh, my. Come to think of it,
I filmed a kiss scene recently.

501
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:45,718
I'll count down from five and move on.

502
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,012
Five, four,

503
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:49,681
three…

504
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,683
You're all still alive, right?

505
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,394
Next question.

506
00:30:56,271 --> 00:31:00,567
Oh, that? No.
Getting bitten doesn't count.

507
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,319
That's bodily harm, not a kiss.

508
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,660
Hey, pirate. Don't do this to me.

509
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,328
Go back inside.

510
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,789
I don't want to cook with a stranger!

511
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,377
Ga-yeong and I will prepare dinner!

512
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,088
We should wash this too.

513
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,424
Leave them here.

514
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,010
I'm loving your drama.

515
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,928
The Princess of Forever.

516
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,471
Thanks.

517
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,849
I'm launching a pilot show as well.

518
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,686
Do you know Patrick, the idol singer?

519
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,816
-Of course.
-I wanted to make this work,

520
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,985
so I reached out to him and had a meeting.

521
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:48,489
But when I saw him in person,
I couldn't help but worry.

522
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,951
They say one of you has to die
when you meet your doppelgänger.

523
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,414
To be frank, we do look alike.

524
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:02,003
Even his stylist was confused
and tried to dress me instead. Like this.

525
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,719
Where's my shoe?

526
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,138
Did a wild animal take it?

527
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,681
Why would they do that?

528
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,142
Even animals have preferences.

529
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,478
Did a ghost take it?

530
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,105
They must have preferences too.

531
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,566
Gosh, where is it?

532
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,249
Finally, it's quiet.

533
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:45,088
Ever since yesterday, I've been feeling
like I'm in a hotel lobby.

534
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,299
It's been so bustling and noisy.

535
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,678
Once again, I'm sorry

536
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,639
about Ga-yeong and Seung-won.

537
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,267
It's fun, though.

538
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,770
It feels like a college retreat.

539
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,439
That's a relief.

540
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,445
I was curious about your childhood,

541
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,948
but I think I got a rough idea.

542
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,202
I always wondered how you three

543
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,329
became friends.

544
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,666
"I see. So that's why they're friends."

545
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,793
I think I get it.

546
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:25,628
Oh, dear.

547
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,341
And…

548
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,094
I like

549
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:36,431
where I am now.

550
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,642
What do you mean?

551
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:44,147
"Where am I in life?

552
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,150
What will happen to us?

553
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,194
What if I get hurt?"

554
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,825
I don't have those questions anymore.

555
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:00,997
Remember?

556
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,667
I was a legless bird.

557
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,797
I used to be afraid of settling down.

558
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,341
I used to excessively water my plants.

559
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,137
I used to read
the ending of a mystery novel first.

560
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,364
Mr. Ju.

561
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,204
Yes, Ms. Kang?

562
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:46,042
Do I still seem legless to you?

563
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,252
Look what I can do.

564
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:54,926
You're right.

565
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,845
You have legs now.

566
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,890
Do you know what it's like

567
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,685
when a rhino slams into you from behind

568
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:08,648
and you end up flying far away?

569
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,621
I do.

570
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,248
Why?

571
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,960
I often felt that way.

572
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:34,215
When I suddenly moved
from Seoul to Gangneung,

573
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:39,637
I thought I flew there
because a rhino had slammed into me.

574
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:44,475
It must've hurt a lot
if you felt that way.

575
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,895
But it wasn't like I was bleeding,

576
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,231
so I got up and started walking again.

577
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,653
Did you ever feel that way again?

578
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,114
Well…

579
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,700
When we got kicked out of a motel.

580
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,538
My mom was crying
with the water running in the bathroom.

581
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,375
Then I knew the rhino came back

582
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:13,754
and that I'd be somewhere else
the next day.

583
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,799
Do you feel that way nowadays?

584
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,301
No.

585
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,346
Because now, I have legs.

586
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,404
Are you okay, Mr. Ju?

587
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,408
Your jeans ripped.

588
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,202
Oh, dear.

589
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,680
Does it hurt?

590
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:10,144
Are they all needle marks?

591
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,527
I'd like you to ignore them.

592
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,154
Why?

593
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,865
You need to get them treated.

594
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,409
I want to keep the pain to myself.

595
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,704
But if you look at them,
you'll feel the pain as well.

596
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,142
Are you upset that I hid my wounds

597
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,478
from you?

598
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,067
I can understand you.

599
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,571
It took me a long time to open up too.

600
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:06,867
But it's okay

601
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,997
since we'll be hanging out all the time.

602
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,334
We have enough time.

603
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,628
Thank you, Ms. Kang.

604
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,174
My pleasure, Mr. Ju.

605
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,731
I didn't know
Leslie Cheung was your first love.

606
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,318
Yes, and he'll always be my crush.

607
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,654
I'm just Mr. Ju to you,

608
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,073
but he's your crush.

609
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:47,908
Of course.

610
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,161
And he'll always be your crush.

611
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:57,001
No matter how old I become,
he'll always stay the same.

612
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:01,130
He'll always be wearing
his white tank top and dancing

613
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,550
in front of the mirror.

614
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,844
I see.

615
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:11,057
So that's what you like.

616
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,642
I should dress like him next time.

617
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,771
Seriously?

618
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,689
Why not?

619
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,859
I even rode a bus
in a wig and a mourning dress.

620
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,821
But you have to stick
by my side at all times.

621
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,532
-Can you do that?
-I'd love to.

622
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,078
I'm going to dance too.

623
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,622
You better keep your word.

624
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,834
You should dress up
as my first love as well.

625
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,795
Deal.

626
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,216
I just need to carry a lollipop, right?

627
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,387
That's not fair.

628
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,722
Don't go back on your word.

629
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:54,892
Nice.

630
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:15,556
You are indeed a flower,
but you bloomed during the wrong season.

631
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,600
What use is a flower during wintertime?

632
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,059
It's obvious.

633
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,813
There are no bees or butterflies,
and I'll probably freeze to death.

634
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,357
I know how my past has been
better than anyone.

635
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,651
Enough about me.

636
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,653
Tell me about my kids.

637
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:30,779
What do you see?

638
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,573
Anything ominous?

639
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,909
Your son is

640
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,662
like a firefly, so he must work at night.

641
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,498
He'll meet a good wife.

642
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,626
Is that so? Gosh.

643
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,212
And your daughter--

644
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,380
She's one smart girl.

645
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,090
She works at the best hotel.

646
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,426
She's pretty, kind, and smart.

647
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,137
I got to say she takes after me
in many ways.

648
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:59,099
She needs to be careful.

649
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,393
Of what?

650
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,646
There's a Grim Reaper behind her,

651
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:06,190
and she's come face-to-face
with a man holding a knife.

652
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,025
But he's holding it upside down.

653
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,153
Talk in layman's terms.
I don't understand.

654
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:15,824
She won't get stabbed,
but she'll still have blood on her.

655
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:24,750
Amidst the bloodbath, she's
head over heels in love with someone.

656
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,752
She's not alone.

657
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,799
Is this the man you're talking about?

658
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,635
His name is Ju Young-do.

659
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,138
Born on May 10, 1984.

660
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,432
-What about the time?
-I don't know.

661
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,351
I just know it was early morning.

662
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,234
And he's alive right now?

663
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,140
You said I could take my time
before answering,

664
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:25,394
but I don't think
my answer will change with time.

665
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,187
I'm sorry.

666
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,460
DELETE ALL MESSAGES

667
00:43:57,176 --> 00:44:00,763
He got caught trying to eat for free
by writing a random room number.

668
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:04,892
When we asked for his room key,
he grabbed a knife and came to the lobby.

669
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:09,146
Sir. Please calm down.

670
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,900
-Please hand over that knife.
-Don't look down on me.

671
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,485
What if I'm a guest here?

672
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:17,488
What if I am?
Why are you treating me like I'm a beggar?

673
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,657
-Sir.
-Do you remember the manual?

674
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,242
-Check if anyone got hurt.
-Please put it down.

675
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,287
-Contact guests who have kids and--
-Hey!

676
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,831
Get lost.

677
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,083
You work here, right?

678
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,668
Call your boss.

679
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,461
I don't want to deal with small fry,

680
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:34,254
so bring your boss here!

681
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,731
Who the hell are you?

682
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,578
We'll go after the bleeding stops.

683
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:09,581
-Get the car ready.
-Okay, I'll do it right now.

684
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:31,061
Is your hand okay?

685
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,063
It's still bleeding.

686
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,065
I'm fine.

687
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,526
I mainly use my right hand.

688
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,236
No.

689
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:43,490
It doesn't matter which hand it is.
What matters is that you got hurt.

690
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,789
Did I frighten you again?

691
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,365
Are you still afraid of me?

692
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:33,207
I am.

693
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,880
So please move aside.

694
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,364
I thought you were smart.

695
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,618
It's my left hand that's bleeding.

696
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,412
So why are you afraid of my right one?

697
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:23,966
I think you're still confused.

698
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:28,428
I'm not the guy who scared you.

699
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:37,813
You're still a fool.

700
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,669
Why are they so stingy
with their surveillance footage?

701
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:02,504
Are they saving it for themselves?

702
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:05,215
Tell me about it. I just don't get it.

703
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,343
What is it?

704
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,765
Okay, we'll be right there.
They found him.

705
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:27,446
The man from Pungji Park.

706
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,115
The man who left
the paper rose at the cafe.

707
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,329
The man who followed him.

708
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,664
It was all you, wasn't it?

709
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:46,089
Pleading the Fifth
until your attorney's here?

710
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,969
Fine. Forget about
your personal information.

711
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,512
Let me ask you one question.

712
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:57,142
Why were you following him?

713
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,227
Did someone tell you to do that?

714
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,605
Because he looked familiar?

715
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,232
What is it?

716
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:08,070
That's a load of questions.

717
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:11,907
You're right.

718
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:16,161
I said I'd only ask
one question. Let me do it again.

719
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,291
You know Choi Jeong-min, don't you?

720
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:34,388
Where are your manners?

721
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,060
Get me some water, will you?

722
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:43,772
Answer me first.

723
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:57,119
Sir, his attorney is here.

724
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,377
What happened?

725
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,713
He hit a guy with a bottle,
but we let him go?

726
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:52,424
The attorney handed in
the homeless man's testimony.

727
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:53,800
He said it was someone else.

728
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,178
Had we gotten the right result
of the analysis…

729
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:58,138
They probably paid him.

730
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,681
I mean, we intentionally got hit

731
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:02,017
so that this wouldn't be
voluntary accompaniment.

732
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:05,270
They said we had provoked him
to hit us and would file a complaint.

733
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,192
How did he find an attorney right away?

734
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,986
What's worse, he's from
Won and Baek Law Firm.

735
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:14,321
WON AND BAEK LAW FIRM
KWON JUNG-HYEON

736
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:19,743
Did you see his face when he was leaving?

737
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,912
-He looked intimidated.
-Right.

738
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:25,123
His attorney came
and whispered something in his ear,

739
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,333
then that happened.

740
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,293
I'm sure he didn't call him.

741
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,087
Something he can't handle
must be happening.

742
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,132
Let's look into that attorney.

743
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,950
I won't repeat myself,

744
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,535
so listen carefully.

745
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:06,331
I'll keep this for now.

746
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:10,377
As you can see, you'll have no internet
and won't be able to contact anyone.

747
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,839
We've removed all sharp objects
from this place

748
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,423
since you won't be needing them.

749
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:19,302
You should stay here at home
for the time being.

750
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,887
Do you understand?

751
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,521
I'll take that as a yes.

752
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:39,823
What is this?

753
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:41,283
Who are you guys?

754
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,351
Sit down.

755
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:19,195
I thought you weren't
the type to get his hands dirty.

756
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,697
What happened?

757
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,244
It's a personal matter.

758
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:28,622
I thought you'd ask for Majin Hospital

759
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,874
in return for doing me a favor.

760
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:34,502
I'm taken aback by your humble wish.

761
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:38,924
I expect you
to grant me that wish properly.

762
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,051
Of course.

763
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:43,011
But not right now.

764
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,640
We just got him out of the police station.

765
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,351
It'll look suspicious
if something happens right away.

766
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:50,894
Let's bide our time.

767
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:56,983
"I'll do you a favor

768
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,611
only if you do me one first."

769
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,156
That's how I understood it.

770
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,285
Fascinating.

771
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:12,082
How could someone so bright
get on that man's bad side?

772
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:13,792
But then again,

773
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:16,711
your childhood was quite--

774
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,588
You really tried hard to look into me.

775
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:21,633
It was easy.

776
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:25,387
The police obey the law
and work around the clock.

777
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,056
But we pay people and disregard the law.

778
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:30,475
You even bribed my attorney.

779
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,644
Why do you think so?

780
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:35,188
I told her some useless lies on purpose.

781
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:38,608
I knew it. You were prepared.

782
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:43,279
Were you shocked
to have been betrayed by someone so close?

783
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,282
I hired her as someone
who'd do anything for money

784
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:49,285
from the beginning.

785
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:51,830
It's not a surprise.

786
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,209
I should get going then.

787
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,757
Interested in living in Korea?

788
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,430
I want you.

789
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:12,684
You're competent
and have a reason to live here.

790
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,978
And I think we can work together.

791
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,272
I'd be glad

792
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:21,776
to give you any position at the hospital.

793
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:27,991
We can discuss that

794
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:30,952
after we're done

795
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,705
with our jobs.

796
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:53,576
PURE MURDER

797
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:11,719
Hello.

798
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:15,098
Hello. Are you Mr. Kang Tae-jeong?

799
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:17,183
-Yes.
-Please take this.

800
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:20,311
And sign here.

801
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,357
Thank you.

802
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:26,734
-Thank you.
-Sure.

803
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,668
NOTICE OF SUCCESSION

804
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:46,796
KANG DA-JEONG AND KANG TAE-JEONG
WILL EACH INHERIT ONE-HALF…

805
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,507
DEFENDANT KANG YUN-CHAN…

806
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:06,524
Do you want to have dinner together?

807
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:07,901
I know a tasty place.

808
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,865
I'm waiting for the bus.
I'll be there soon.

809
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,493
Okay. See you soon.

810
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,337
Excuse me.

811
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:01,037
Excuse me. Can you look over here?

812
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,466
When did you get on?

813
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:17,303
I said, "See you soon," didn't I?

814
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:22,433
What kind of dialect is that?

815
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,353
No one from Gangneung talks like that.

816
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:27,146
Oh, is that so?

817
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,524
I apologize.

818
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:37,615
Young-do!

819
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:40,034
Young-do!

820
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:43,621
Hey, Hye-ju. It's been a while.

821
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:46,291
I'm so happy to see you!

822
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:48,209
Young-do, I listened to your radio show.

823
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:52,338
About that loser who wanted to be friends
with the woman he liked.

824
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,967
Oh, dear. That of all stories?

825
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:58,553
You really don't age, Young-do.

826
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:00,263
What do you apply?

827
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,432
Just water.

828
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,019
Oh, I didn't know you were with someone.

829
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,730
-Hello.
-Hello.

830
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:11,899
We used to be in the same club in college.

831
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,234
Is she your girlfriend?

832
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:16,654
No, she's not.

833
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:22,744
I'll go inside first.

834
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:28,666
A colleague?

835
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,586
No, she's someone I like.

836
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:59,989
-Let me.
-No. I'm going to do it.

837
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:03,993
Okay. But be careful. It's hot.

838
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:12,168
You should have some too.

839
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:13,920
I am.

840
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,924
How could you make
your girlfriend do this?

841
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,676
Give it to me. I'll do it for you.

842
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,596
She's not my girlfriend.

843
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:26,724
She's someone I like.

844
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,477
Oh, my. I see.

845
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:33,773
She's not my girlfriend.
Just someone I like.

846
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:35,566
Just someone you like? I see.

847
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:37,402
Just someone you like.

848
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:40,863
She's so pretty.

849
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,713
Are you planning to continue staying here?

850
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:02,051
Hwang Jae-sik is in Majin's hands now.

851
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:04,762
I don't see the reason
for you to keep staying here.

852
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:07,598
And you'll be working
in Korea from now on--

853
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:08,766
Did I

854
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:12,019
ever say that?

855
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,108
Not directly,

856
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:18,943
-but--
-Just do what you've been doing.

857
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:21,195
That's all you need to do.

858
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,906
Just do what you've been doing.

859
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,120
See you tomorrow.

860
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,663
Yes, sir. I'm listening.

861
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:22,316
Hello?

862
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:49,886
SUNDAY, MAY 2ND
ALARM

863
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:07,648
Detective Ko Jin-bok. A woman has died.

864
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:09,650
Then should we just go to my house?

865
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:13,320
"My dear neighbors.
That hot guy is my boyfriend."

866
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:14,864
You kiss the guy you like.

867
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:17,742
And if you liked the kiss,
you can just leave it at that.

868
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:20,786
That Ian Chase killed Noh Hyeon-ju.

869
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,621
So that's the wrong answer, right?

870
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:25,374
"Childhood is like
a knife stuck in the throat

871
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,001
which cannot be removed easily."

872
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:29,712
I guess this year
is the year I pull out that knife.

873
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:33,591
She was begging us
not to make a fuss out of this.

874
01:07:34,258 --> 01:07:37,970
