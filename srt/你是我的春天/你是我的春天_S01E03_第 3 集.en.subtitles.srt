00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:52,403
MERRY CHRISTMAS

2
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,228
I am writing this

3
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,690
of my own volition.

4
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:33,319
On March 13, 2003 at 9 p.m.,

5
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,530
I killed Kim Myeong-ja.

6
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,117
Maybe it was because
I used an old fruit knife

7
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,828
that her blood vessels didn't burst
in one go,

8
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,746
so I had to stab her several times.

9
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,792
While doing so, her blood splattered
on my clothes, so I was very annoyed.

10
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,547
On June 3, 2018, at 2 p.m.,

11
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:57,176
I stabbed Lee Jeong-beom
in a back alley at Pungji 8-dong

12
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:02,223
because he knew too much about me.

13
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:05,727
I bought a 20,000-won kitchen knife
at Pungji Grocery.

14
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:10,189
And to not raise suspicions, I also bought
a cutting board and a tray.

15
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:15,028
And on December 18, 2020 at 2 a.m.,

16
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,487
I killed Cho Gwang-hun.

17
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,452
Since I knew that the building was vacant,

18
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:26,080
I could carry out my deed
without feeling rushed.

19
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,252
Everything I did was inevitable.

20
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,923
Anyone in my position
would have done the same thing.

21
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:40,345
Therefore, I do not regret
having done what I had to do.

22
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,185
This is my suicide note and confession.

23
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:52,315
Now I'm putting an end to everything.

24
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:42,573
EPISODE 3

25
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,492
We identified him with his fingerprints.

26
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,035
His name is Choi Jeong-min.

27
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,453
Yes, go ahead.

28
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,458
Are you hurt?

29
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,254
No. This isn't my blood.

30
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,010
How do you know him?

31
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,303
And why were you here?

32
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,639
The woman in the photo
lives on the fourth floor.

33
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,017
She's the one I know.

34
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,602
And he came to my clinic once before.

35
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,648
Mr. Ko, I think
we should go back to the station.

36
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,568
Apparently, a woman brought
Choi Jeong-min's confession letter.

37
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,909
Do you remember this photo?

38
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,370
No.

39
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,414
What about this church?

40
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,710
That was the only time

41
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,588
I went to this church.

42
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,300
I went there to get that book.

43
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,847
I wonder how he got this photo.

44
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,352
Did he ever tell you about his childhood?

45
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:56,981
No.

46
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,818
Not even once?

47
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,365
He rarely talked about himself.

48
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,330
Then you never knew
that Choi Jeong-min was his real name?

49
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,003
No.

50
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,256
Have you seen his ID before?

51
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,758
No.

52
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,594
Or have you met his family or friends?

53
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:32,809
Then…

54
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,394
who is Chae Jun?

55
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,108
Is he even a real person?

56
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,403
We'll need to look into that.

57
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:49,700
All we've found out so far is
that his real name was Choi Jeong-min.

58
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,990
Oh, this?

59
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,700
I tried to give him first aid.

60
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,375
Is he even a US citizen?

61
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,085
He came to my clinic once.

62
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,963
It was like he wanted to show me
who he really was.

63
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:48,551
Young-do, we need to sort out
your involvement in this case first.

64
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,596
For now, you are the only witness.

65
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,431
And you were alone at the scene.

66
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,600
So we need to check a few things.

67
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,810
We'll need your dashcam footage, too.

68
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,438
Okay.

69
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,482
You should go home for the night.

70
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,610
Yes. The restroom is that way.

71
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:13,159
When she's done giving a statement,
you should drive her home safely.

72
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,079
She must be really shocked.
I don't know how she's handling it.

73
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:19,916
Okay.

74
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,013
I've seen that face before.

75
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,321
Mom.

76
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,829
It's neither sadness nor rage.

77
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,873
It's like being in a vacuum.

78
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,170
Like there's no air to breathe,
so you can't hear anything.

79
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,130
"I was very worried.

80
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,758
I'm relieved that you are okay.

81
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,720
It's okay to be sad or angry.

82
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:39,972
None of this…

83
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,100
is your fault.

84
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,770
Hang in there,

85
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,064
and everything shall pass.

86
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,900
I will be by your side."

87
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,070
There's so much I want to tell her.

88
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,297
But I know that there isn't

89
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,467
a single thing I can say to comfort her.

90
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,219
So…

91
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,030
You haven't eaten, right?

92
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,617
Let's eat before we go home.

93
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,341
It's been confirmed that
the deceased suspect, Choi, jumped off

94
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,718
a ten-story building
in a construction site.

95
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,138
In his suicide note, Choi confessed that

96
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,764
he was the culprit

97
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,976
of the murder case
that took place in December.

98
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,604
He also wrote that he killed
the police officer in 2018

99
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:15,151
and admitted that his first murder
took place in 2003 when he was a minor.

100
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,153
In addition to his admission to murder…

101
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,623
I have to see my outpatients on Tuesday.

102
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,212
It sort of happened that way.

103
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,186
Great. Come tomorrow.

104
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,529
No. The second floor is vacant.
And I'm on the third floor.

105
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,119
Yes.

106
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,750
Okay. Sure. See you tomorrow morning.

107
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,169
Okay.

108
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,695
Come on. Go and buy some porridge.

109
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,951
She won't be able
to eat anything right now.

110
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,162
Eating while crying
will give her indigestion.

111
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,747
Why would Da-jeong cry?

112
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,499
The person she almost dated died.

113
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,209
Of course, she'd be sad.

114
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,877
Don't say stuff like that.

115
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:01,006
She wouldn't date him.
That lunatic was just pursuing her.

116
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,883
If we think that way,

117
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,135
will anything change?

118
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,762
Whatever!

119
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:09,515
Just don't say something like that!

120
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,185
Hey.

121
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,146
Why are you crying?

122
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,109
I was the one who encouraged her.

123
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,737
She had only been with dirtbags
all her life.

124
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,031
And I pushed her to date some psycho.

125
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,912
He didn't look like one.

126
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,998
How could he kill people?

127
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,750
Don't say something like that, too!

128
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,635
They're here.

129
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,488
I called them.

130
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:11,118
I know you probably want to be alone,
but that's not a good idea.

131
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,668
Do you have digestive tablets at home?

132
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,923
I don't usually take medicine.

133
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,222
Take it just in case.

134
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,565
Thanks.

135
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,562
What are you doing?

136
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,772
Da-jeong said you shouldn't be alone.

137
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,694
I'm fine. Get out.

138
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:12,573
She told me to go with you
even if you said that.

139
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,826
Just get out of the car.

140
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:19,288
No. She told me not to leave you alone
no matter what you say.

141
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,041
-It makes me uncomfortable.
-I told her that, too.

142
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,003
That you've been single for years,
so you hate sleeping with other people.

143
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,354
DIGESTIVE TABLETS

144
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,448
3RD FLOOR, JU YOUNG-DO PSYCHIATRY CLINIC

145
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,210
You're here.

146
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,045
My god. Why are you late?

147
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,339
I was scared.
You said this place is haunted.

148
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,885
-Who is this?
-This is Ha-neul.

149
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,720
He came to check out the second floor.

150
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,181
-But he's a man.
-I never said Ha-neul was a girl.

151
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,476
He must be the building owner's son.
The one you tutored.

152
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,061
Hello. I'm Seo Ha-neul.

153
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,231
Hello. I'm Park Cheol-do.

154
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,526
Your name suits you very much.

155
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,987
And your name sure reminds me of a train.

156
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,575
-Did you talk to Seung-won?
-I ignored his call.

157
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,577
Good. He needs that from time to time.

158
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,162
Did you eat?

159
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,791
No. Mom must've asked you just in case.

160
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,587
She knows that you can't make it.
Don't worry about it.

161
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,174
Okay. Bye.

162
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,315
-Who's that?
-Goodness.

163
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,318
Hey.

164
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,654
What happened to your face?

165
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,739
Oh, this? Gorilla scratched me yesterday.

166
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,325
You treat gorillas at your clinic?

167
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,536
It's a cat named Gorilla.

168
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,871
Want to see some photos?

169
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,041
Look. It's a young black cat.
It's so cute.

170
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,626
Even the paws are black.

171
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:56,171
-You're so cute, aren't you?
-Oh, my.

172
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,424
I missed you, too.
Come on. Isn't this cat so cute?

173
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,286
Did you get some sleep?

174
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,516
Thank you. I was craving a warm drink.

175
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,231
Oh, it's cold.

176
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,360
I can see
that you don't like cooled-down coffee.

177
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,571
I shouldn't have cooled it then.

178
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,365
-I'll get you warm coffee.
-So you can

179
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,285
boss me around like last time?

180
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,288
Will you set up a tent
on the rooftop this time?

181
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,623
Want to go to Gangneung if you're free?

182
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,924
Sure.

183
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,303
You won't even ask why?

184
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,556
-I think I know why.
-We'll leave right now.

185
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:31,975
Sure.

186
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:40,400
But if you're assuming
that it's because I'm scared to be alone

187
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,486
or anything like that, you're wrong.

188
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,906
I made a promise to my mom,
but if I tell her I'm not going,

189
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:48,116
she might find out
something is up with me.

190
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,326
But…

191
00:22:56,833 --> 00:23:01,046
If you were to drive there alone,
some people would be worried and stop you.

192
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,256
But they can't leave the cafe.

193
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,469
And if you were to ask someone else,
you'd have to explain everything.

194
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,470
But not with me.

195
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,723
I'll go.

196
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,315
And I assume

197
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,860
you'd be worried if I was alone. Right?

198
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,077
I'll get going.

199
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,461
Bring half-dried squid
on your way back. Bring a lot!

200
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,883
You think she's going on a vacation?

201
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,845
Young-do told me to treat her like usual.

202
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,098
Why ask for squid
when you already look like one?

203
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:54,766
What can I say, then?

204
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,935
That since he deserved to die,

205
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,646
she should cry her heart out at the beach
and forget him?

206
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,773
Stop saying she's going to cry.

207
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,569
She said she'd pretend
this never happened to her.

208
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:09,281
So we should just do the same.
As if nothing happened.

209
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,160
That's not going to work.

210
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:29,885
Get in.

211
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,388
Get in.

212
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,099
I know you didn't get any sleep.

213
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:39,769
I thought you were a raccoon.
Gosh, look at your dark circles.

214
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:43,899
You look like a chatty rabbit
with your bloodshot eyes.

215
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,818
So you expect me
to get in a raccoon's car?

216
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,445
It's better than a rabbit's.

217
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:51,239
She even took a nap
during a race with a tortoise.

218
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,992
It was one mistake.
You can't still look down on rabbits.

219
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,203
You can't criticize
a raccoon's looks, then.

220
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,625
Rock, paper, scissors.

221
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:21,937
SUICIDE NOTE FOUND IN STORAGE LOCKER
AT YONGSAN STATION

222
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,480
EVIDENCE 1

223
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,190
EVIDENCE 2

224
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,820
Are you sure Mr. Ko is okay?

225
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,573
He's been skipping meals.

226
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,492
He must have a lot on his mind.

227
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:38,578
He wanted to catch that bastard
and make him pay.

228
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,830
But he died too easily.

229
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,499
I read Young-do's notes.

230
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:45,377
Young-do already had him figured out.

231
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,630
Right here. "Suspected to have
an antisocial personality disorder."

232
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,133
"Young-do"? You barely know the guy.

233
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,762
Did you look into his family?

234
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,847
He really didn't have anyone.

235
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:01,977
There's no record of his father, his
mother is dead, and he has no siblings.

236
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,396
It makes me…

237
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:08,942
It makes you what?

238
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,569
Are you pitying him?

239
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,406
Jeong-beom was an orphan, too.

240
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:19,452
He was adopted just to be abandoned again,
but he still led a good life.

241
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:23,748
Don't make excuses
for those bastards. Got it?

242
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:24,666
Yes, sir.

243
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,210
What about the partial print
from the note?

244
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,546
We got nothing from it.

245
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:32,299
And the dark spots are
from urban dust like exhaust fumes.

246
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:35,093
What about the photo and dashcam footage?

247
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,304
It's been less than a day
since we sent them over.

248
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,513
Tell them to hurry.

249
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:39,973
Yes, sir.

250
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,976
Where are you going?

251
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:53,278
TURN OFF HEADLIGHTS

252
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,290
LOOKING FOR WITNESSES OF A MURDER CASE

253
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,962
LOOKING FOR WITNESSES OF A MURDER CASE

254
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:15,342
IF YOU WITNESSED A MURDER OR HAVE
ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE MURDER…

255
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,491
ON JUNE 3, 2018 AT 2 P.M.

256
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:42,452
ASSISTANT INSPECTOR LEE JEONG-BEOM

257
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:47,624
All the evidence adds up perfectly.

258
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,710
Is this really it?

259
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,381
I failed to catch the culprit
again and again,

260
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:58,093
so did you put together the evidence
and send it to me?

261
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,349
But why do I get a feeling
he's not the real culprit?

262
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,603
Maybe I'm wrong.

263
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,857
Because I couldn't catch him myself,

264
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,778
maybe I'm hoping
this guy isn't your killer.

265
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,411
Jeong-beom.

266
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:29,624
If he's the real culprit,
show up in my dreams.

267
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,460
Show up just once…

268
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,632
and tell me to stop because it was him.

269
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,054
Do that for me.

270
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:11,666
"Objects in mirror are closer
than they appear."

271
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,212
Right. Some things are like that.

272
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,425
Rest stop.

273
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,178
Shouldn't we pump gas?

274
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:25,722
No, not yet.

275
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,187
Do you want some food?

276
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,355
Buttered potatoes,

277
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,192
dried squid,
sausages and rice cakes on a stick,

278
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,361
corn dogs with potato cubes,
or cooled-down fish cake on a stick?

279
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,197
Are you hungry?

280
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:43,948
No.

281
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,540
-Do you want to play 20 Questions?
-We don't have to talk.

282
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,417
Are you telling me to shut up?

283
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,586
I know that you talk
for other people's sake.

284
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,797
In case things might get awkward

285
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,216
and people might think
that you're in a bad mood.

286
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,886
And now, you feel bad
because you're resting while I'm driving.

287
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,142
Did you see the sign just now?

288
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,937
That the rest stop is 2km away?

289
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,606
No. That you should shut up
if you're going to analyze me.

290
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,818
Silence can be uncomfortable sometimes,

291
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,737
but you don't always have to
take responsibility for it.

292
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,825
Too bad.
I was chatty even when I was a baby.

293
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,327
Our landlady scolded my mom

294
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,205
for always having the radio on
and using too much electricity.

295
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,498
I'm sure you were.

296
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,546
Because it made your mom smile.

297
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:43,633
Infants can instinctively sense it
when their moms are happy.

298
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,888
You don't talk much when you're
with your close friends, right?

299
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,351
Were you ever a baby?

300
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,687
Of course. I was really cute.

301
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,232
I bet you were a bit weird.

302
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:02,068
When your mom tried to change
your diaper, you probably said,

303
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,904
"Mother, you don't have to trouble
yourself to change

304
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,239
my wet diaper every time.

305
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,617
You're not responsible
for making my buttocks feel wet."

306
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,536
But when she took off your diaper

307
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:14,455
without understanding you,
you probably said, "Oh, dear."

308
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,378
Don't look at me. Eyes on the road.

309
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,423
Gosh. You're getting a call, too.

310
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,718
Excuse me.

311
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,096
What is it again?

312
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,181
Hey, I'm coming over to your house now.

313
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,934
-Sure. Drive safely, but I won't be there.
-Yes.

314
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,020
You must be at your clinic.

315
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,105
I'm on my way to Gangneung.
I'm driving now.

316
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,691
-Let's talk later.
-No. I need your answer by today.

317
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:44,485
-You'll do the radio show, right?
-I don't have time for it.

318
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,571
If you can't do it live, we'll record it.

319
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,907
I have to see more patients
because of the strike.

320
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,743
-On top of that, I have--
-Hey, just do it.

321
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,162
If my friend begged me this much,
I'd say yes.

322
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,415
You make it sound like
I never do you any favors.

323
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:01,085
Then why won't you help me this time?
Is it because the DJ is a guy?

324
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,047
For your information,
the producer is a single woman.

325
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:07,008
But you can't ask her out.
I call dibs on her.

326
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,344
Wait. What if she falls for you?

327
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,553
What's wrong with you?

328
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,889
-Hey, stop talking nonsense.
-"Nonsense"?

329
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,058
After your interview on the news program,

330
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,894
the assistant director fell for you
and asked you out with tears in her eyes.

331
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:21,064
When you were a medical advisor
for a drama, the lead actress married you.

332
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,649
You must have been such a flirt.

333
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,318
-Hey.
-What? Will you be on the radio show?

334
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,986
Okay. Let's talk later.

335
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,657
Two hands on the wheel.

336
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,034
But why are you going to Gangneung?

337
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:37,789
Hey, Mr. Flirt. Are you flirting
with another woman as we speak?

338
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,958
He's crazy.

339
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,210
We went to the same high school.

340
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,212
He was in liberal arts.
I was in science.

341
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,630
There's a big gap between us.

342
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,758
We were the three musketeers,
but he was the third wheel.

343
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:49,926
You know?

344
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,389
Ha-neul's different, though.
The vet on the second floor.

345
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,433
Didn't I tell you about him?

346
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,685
Anyway, this bastard…

347
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,813
This friend of mine works…

348
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,606
He works at a broadcasting company.

349
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:08,111
He always makes his friends appear
on TV or radio shows.

350
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,529
You don't have to talk.

351
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,823
Silence can be uncomfortable sometimes,

352
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:14,993
but you don't always have to
take responsibility for it.

353
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,244
Oh, dear.

354
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,621
Of course, in this case,

355
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,375
I think you need to explain

356
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,293
how you hit on women.

357
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,838
Okay. I'll stop.

358
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,889
But can you show me
how you flirted with women?

359
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,641
I never did that.

360
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,893
And I don't even know how to flirt.

361
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,231
So you didn't do anything,
but these ladies fell in love with you?

362
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,818
Did you see the sign?
It said you should shut up.

363
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,611
No, it didn't.

364
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,780
It said you can pay the toll by flirting.

365
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,032
Why don't you take a nap?

366
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:57,201
Too bad. The rabbit is no longer sleepy.

367
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,537
Oh, my. He's fishing.

368
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,874
I wonder how he's flirting with the fish.
Look at those cars flirting.

369
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,251
The baby seagulls are also flirting.

370
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:06,836
Flirt.

371
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,173
Flirt.

372
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,404
Should I recommend some places for you?

373
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,531
I'll look some up.

374
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,659
Call me when you need to head back.

375
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,497
-If you want to eat pizza…
-I'm good.

376
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,415
Go somewhere else if you want some.

377
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,669
That will be better than explaining
why you're here to my mom.

378
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:03,851
How old is he?

379
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:12,443
He's not that old. Or so he says.

380
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,363
Mom.

381
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,966
You had tangerines.

382
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,885
Yes, I did. I ate them by myself.

383
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,058
He's not the tangerine guy?

384
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,522
CHOI CONFESSES TO SERIAL MURDER

385
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,815
Give me that.

386
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,193
I can ask him what he does, right?

387
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,571
There are so many psychos in the world.

388
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,614
And they could be around us.

389
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,241
Drink it.

390
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,494
BARLEY TEA

391
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:06,873
Oh, dear.

392
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,584
What? You're unemployed?

393
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,752
No. I'm usually at a clinic.

394
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:12,837
Are you sick?

395
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,340
No, not as a patient. I'm a doctor.

396
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,718
Then you should have just said that.

397
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:22,763
Why did you answer vaguely
as if it were some grand secret?

398
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,142
Were you worried that I might badmouth you
because doctors are on strike?

399
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,476
Are you embarrassed?

400
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,271
That's not it. It's a habit.

401
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:33,608
Never mind.

402
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,072
Mom, Mr. Ju should go now.
He needs to do something.

403
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,074
Like what?

404
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:45,870
Well, I know someone in this area.

405
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,830
Who? What's their name?

406
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:56,964
You can't even lie
to such a simple question.

407
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,175
You pass.

408
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:01,886
-Pardon?
-Did you eat anything at the rest stop?

409
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,054
-Yes.
-No.

410
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,222
Yes.

411
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,392
Wait.

412
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,317
Do you need some help?

413
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,081
You're getting a call.

414
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,251
Answer it if you want to.

415
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,306
Hello? This is the pizzeria.

416
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:51,936
I'd like to order 30 pizzas and
have them delivered to Haegang Beach.

417
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:53,854
Thirty pizzas?

418
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,566
Please deliver them
to a big group doing a commercial shoot.

419
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:01,988
And I can't get out of the car right now,
so can you come out and take my card?

420
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,614
Hello?

421
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,241
Hello?

422
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:07,660
Hello?

423
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,496
Hello? Can you not hear me?

424
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,123
Can I get your name?

425
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,251
You need my name to take my order?

426
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,128
Didn't my number pop up on your phone?

427
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,469
-Okay. So 30 pizzas?
-Yes.

428
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,972
And if anyone asks who ordered the pizza,

429
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:30,683
tell them Patrick's fan paid for it.

430
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:35,021
Hold on. Don't hang up.
Give me a moment, please.

431
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:40,943
What is this?

432
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,995
-What a surprise.
-It's you, right? 30 pizzas.

433
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,541
Hello?

434
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,418
It's me.

435
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,004
What? What are you doing there?

436
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,759
-Was that an order or a prank call?
-An order for 30 pizzas.

437
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:06,927
That's a prank call.

438
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,263
-They're shooting a commercial.
-Really?

439
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,307
-Hello?
-What about the payment?

440
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,641
Hello? Ju Young-do.

441
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:18,314
Okay. Then I'll go to you now.

442
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,776
I'll go and take care of the payment now.

443
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,320
I'll go. Where do I have to go?

444
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,113
No. I'll go.

445
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,897
What is this?

446
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,984
I can totally explain what I'm doing here.

447
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:08,697
My boyfriend is filming a commercial.
And I secretly followed him to spy on him.

448
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,950
So you guys are dating. That's great.

449
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,037
I've seen her somewhere.

450
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,207
-You saw her on the rooftop.
-That's it!

451
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,876
Are you guys dating?
That's why you gave her my plant?

452
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,671
Did you move in together? Is that
your in-law? You're getting married!

453
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,256
No, no. And no.

454
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,384
You got it all wrong.
There's a story behind this.

455
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,386
Is she mentally ill and suicidal, too?

456
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,888
Or does she love you to death?

457
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:37,017
No. Just give me your card.
I need to go and swipe the card.

458
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,687
The owner is really scary.

459
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,522
No. You pay for it.

460
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,315
I'm in a bad mood.

461
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,818
Why all of a sudden?

462
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,196
You ordered 30 pizzas.

463
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,157
Why would I pay?

464
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,826
I don't know.
I don't have a reason to be in a bad mood,

465
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,703
but I am. So I'm even more pissed.

466
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,081
Get out. I'm leaving.

467
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,335
Okay. Drive safely.

468
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,257
Your pizza is here!
Your delicious pizza is here.

469
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,718
-Gosh. It should be eaten when it's hot.
-Mom.

470
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,178
Here's your pizza!

471
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:55,930
Have some of this delicious pizza.

472
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,556
-Here.
-Hey, take the pizza.

473
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,682
Hurry.

474
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,355
-What's that?
-They were sent in your name.

475
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,148
-My name?
-Yes.

476
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,150
The pizza is from Patrick!

477
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,444
Let's give it up for him!

478
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,489
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you for the food.

479
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,574
-Thank you.
-Mom, you're not buying this.

480
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,159
We're just delivering it.

481
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,498
This is nice.

482
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,877
So the guy who was in the center
is a famous singer, right?

483
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,837
He's a really famous idol star.

484
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,923
It's so hard to get tickets
to his concerts.

485
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:33,133
Should I have gotten
an autograph on my back?

486
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,678
Mom. Please.

487
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,388
Right?

488
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,932
I'm too old to get an autograph
from an idol star.

489
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,726
No. You don't look old at all.

490
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,312
You're unbelievable.

491
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,773
You keep giving me compliments.

492
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,108
My goodness.

493
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:37,531
What is it?

494
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,993
Can I lend your clothes in Gangneung
to someone?

495
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:41,910
Sure.

496
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,163
But to whom?

497
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,000
Mom pushed someone to the water
because she was laughing so hard.

498
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,252
Gosh. She shouldn't have pushed him
so hard.

499
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,256
Bye now. I'll call you in Seoul.

500
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,841
Okay.

501
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:01,805
Hello.

502
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,454
Can we stay here a bit longer?

503
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,415
Sounds good.

504
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:47,643
It will take some time
for you to feel normal again.

505
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,194
No.

506
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:03,700
I won't waste my time on him anymore.
Not even a minute.

507
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,581
I barely knew the guy anyway.

508
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,379
I didn't even know his real name.

509
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:23,637
I just wonder…

510
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:28,434
how it all…

511
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:33,272
went wrong.

512
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,860
You didn't do anything wrong.

513
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:45,576
There has to be something, though.

514
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:50,164
Like you said,

515
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,876
it might be because of
my childhood memories I keep dragging

516
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:59,465
or my fate
that the fortune-teller told me.

517
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,260
Or…

518
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,805
I really might be…

519
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,361
Sometimes you forget your car key,

520
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,947
so you go back inside
without turning on the lights.

521
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:29,703
You trip over something in the dark,
so you turn on the lights.

522
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,624
Then you feel like
everything is your fault.

523
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,463
"Why did I buy a desk
when I don't even read books?

524
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,382
I should have hung the key over there.

525
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,802
Why didn't I fix the sensor light?"

526
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,601
But you merely fell.

527
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:56,313
You were rushing
to not keep your friend waiting.

528
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,108
It's a relief
that you didn't get hurt badly.

529
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:04,571
And next time, you can turn on the lights
before going in.

530
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,880
I wish he weren't such a bad person.

531
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,885
So I could at least be sad.

532
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,601
He shouldn't have done
something like that.

533
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,604
So I could cry a bit.

534
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:43,944
I can't even cry for him now. Seriously.

535
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,452
"The fact that I can't trust
anyone anymore hurts me more

536
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:37,497
than the fact that I was betrayed
by the people I trusted the most.

537
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:43,211
I am in pain and heartbroken
as if the world has come to an end.

538
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,380
But people tell me to forget.

539
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,382
I no longer have

540
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:50,677
the strength to get up again
or meet other people.

541
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,096
So I've been reading online comics
every day in bed.

542
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:57,517
And my family is asking me
how long I'll be cooped up in my room.

543
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:01,396
I'm also frustrated with myself.

544
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,733
But I'm still having a hard time
even talking."

545
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,401
I see.

546
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:08,904
Okay.

547
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,448
Usually, people say

548
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:15,410
when you're hurt, you must open up
the wound to see it as a whole,

549
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,204
or it will get infected.

550
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:19,998
That's true,

551
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,043
but it doesn't apply to everyone.

552
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,045
Other than regular tasks,

553
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,547
does the hotel need to assign
more people on this?

554
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:33,011
Well, the butler service wasn't requested,
but we might need to assign more people.

555
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,890
Ms. Kang. Based on
everyone's schedules, I want you to…

556
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:44,272
Getting heartbroken isn't a metaphor.

557
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,236
You merely can't see the wound.
But the injury is real.

558
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:56,493
The problem is that even the patient
doesn't know about the injury

559
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,037
because it doesn't bleed.

560
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:08,547
"I don't even want to think about it.
I'll pretend that it never happened."

561
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:11,091
That's okay for now.

562
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:14,010
If I were to compare this
to a car accident,

563
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,763
this person's arms, legs, and ribs
would all be broken.

564
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,682
"Get up and walk.

565
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:21,476
Why are you lying in bed?"
You can't say that.

566
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:26,982
You're still hanging in there.
I want to say you're doing so well.

567
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,744
I'm back.

568
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,912
Why are you so late? Did you eat?

569
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:43,790
I got caught up at work. And I had dinner.

570
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:44,916
I'm going up.

571
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,252
Hey, what about my squid?

572
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:52,716
Hey! My squid… What about my squid?

573
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:59,806
-What?
-Choose.

574
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,727
-What is it?
-Something you need.

575
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,356
This one.

576
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:42,182
DETECTIVE CHOI SEONG-JUN

577
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:44,017
EXIT 2

578
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:50,816
Choi Jeong-min put it in
on the 24th at 10:10 p.m.

579
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,818
And this was from the 25th at 12:35 a.m.

580
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:56,363
As you can see, a man who seems
to be homeless is opening the locker.

581
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,532
He's putting the suicide note in it.

582
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:01,868
And this is the photo
that shows his face the most.

583
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,914
-Here.
-Thank you.

584
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,333
The train is approaching…

585
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,376
About that…

586
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:13,588
Some guy gave me 50,000 won and told me

587
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,091
to put it in there.

588
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,176
I see.

589
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:22,013
What else did he tell you
when he asked you to do that?

590
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,057
He said that he had to go somewhere,

591
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,726
so he had no time to come inside.

592
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,688
How did you know the passcode?

593
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:32,607
He wrote it down on a business card.

594
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,570
Do you still have the card?

595
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:43,869
Goodness.

596
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:47,914
CEO, CHAE JUN

597
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,833
Is this the card he gave you that day?

598
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:50,834
Yes.

599
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,713
Do you recognize this man?

600
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:57,841
Yes. That's the guy.

601
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:02,721
Can I see your palms?

602
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:07,767
Gosh.

603
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,981
When you had the envelope,

604
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,901
did you also touch the paper inside?

605
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:19,404
Yes, I checked if there was cash inside.

606
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:22,115
But I put it back in after.

607
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,833
Is it okay to talk
about the case with me now?

608
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:32,959
Of course.

609
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,381
You look awful.

610
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:41,593
I'm frustrated.

611
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,473
Everything falls into place so perfectly,
it's creepy.

612
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,602
When I find something suspicious,

613
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:54,105
someone shows up with the answer
as if they've been waiting.

614
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:56,274
I get that he was in a hurry,

615
00:53:57,233 --> 00:54:00,278
but he had a homeless man
put his suicide note in the locker?

616
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:03,573
Inside the gift that was meant
for someone he liked?

617
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,283
Why?

618
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,494
But the evidence says it's true.

619
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,830
The homeless man had all the evidence
in his pocket.

620
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:17,128
I don't think Choi Jeong-min
is the real culprit.

621
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:22,175
What the news articles say

622
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:25,387
and the fact that I was there
when he fell…

623
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,806
There's something strange about it all.

624
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:31,017
First, he has no reason
to kill himself now.

625
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,186
But you saw it with your own eyes.

626
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:35,146
You saw him jump.

627
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,024
Someone could've had a hand in it.

628
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,359
But there's a suicide note.

629
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:41,486
He admitted to everything he did.

630
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:44,239
It wasn't handwritten.
Did you find his fingerprints on it?

631
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:46,324
The homeless man touched it,
so it's tainted.

632
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:49,202
But it was definitely printed
at his house.

633
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:53,748
A man who decides to kill himself
wouldn't write like that.

634
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,792
The way he talked about the murders
was off.

635
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,128
What about his psychiatric meds

636
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,422
found at his house and in his system?

637
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:02,674
What if he did it
when he was mentally unstable?

638
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:05,260
You need a prescription for those meds.

639
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:08,138
If someone put it in his drink,
he'd have--

640
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:09,055
He killed people.

641
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,224
You don't think
he could get them illegally?

642
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:15,061
If you follow forged evidence,
of course, everything says he did it.

643
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:18,606
He confessed, and we found evidence
and the knife he stabbed Jeong-beom with.

644
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,900
He stabbed Jeong-beom,
and left him bleeding.

645
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,235
It was written in the suicide note

646
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:24,696
that he took the phone and notepad
and left Jeong-beom on the street

647
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:27,866
while still alive!
How is he not the culprit?

648
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,743
How do you know that? You know nothing!

649
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,044
What if…

650
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,589
What if he wasn't the real culprit?

651
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:45,467
What if someone made him kill himself?

652
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:19,167
JUNE 3, 2018

653
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,517
What happened to Jeong-beom?

654
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:38,394
Where is he?

655
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:42,273
Tell me what happened!

656
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:47,570
He's alive, right? Right?

657
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,323
He's brain-dead.

658
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,203
He won't wake up.

659
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:18,184
-Let's go together.
-Hey, stop it.

660
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,103
-Maybe later.
-Seriously.

661
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:22,730
-Young-do.
-Yes?

662
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:25,942
You're getting a heart.

663
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:29,612
-A heart?
-This is great.

664
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:33,741
A heart? A heart!

665
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:36,161
A heart! Thank you, doctor!

666
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:38,830
Gosh, Young-do.

667
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,417
Goodness.

668
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,469
A DETECTIVE BECOMES BRAIN-DEAD
WHILE CHASING A COLD CASE

669
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,095
HE RESTS IN PEACE
AFTER DONATING HIS ORGANS

670
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:03,188
AS IT WAS THE LATE OFFICER'S WISH
TO DONATE HIS ORGANS…

671
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,356
You received Jeong-beom's heart?

672
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:08,985
Yes.

673
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:13,406
I understand why you are here.

674
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,660
But it's too soon for me to see you.

675
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:21,080
Though you didn't do anything wrong.

676
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,126
I understand.

677
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,726
Do a lot of good in this world
as a doctor.

678
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:45,855
In place of Jeong-beom.

679
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:48,942
I will.

680
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:59,953
LEE JEONG-BEOM

681
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:15,593
In case he tells me who the culprit is
in a dream,

682
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,638
I wear this to sleep.

683
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,352
But he's never appeared in my dream.

684
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:29,232
You got his heart of all organs.

685
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,402
So if he tells you something in a dream,

686
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:35,863
don't just brush it off as a silly dream.

687
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:38,074
Please…

688
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:39,427
Why did you wait for me?

689
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:58,071
You should quit smoking.

690
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:00,615
You should quit nagging.

691
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:07,789
I wonder who tipped us off.

692
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:10,249
Is it someone from the bereaved family?

693
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:13,086
Or it could be someone

694
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:16,714
who wants to bury this case
by pinning it on him.

695
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,677
That person

696
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,764
knew Choi Jeong-min's home address

697
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:27,183
and that he frequented that building.

698
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:31,020
So they might know about you
and the lady on the fourth floor.

699
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,439
If you're right,

700
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:38,486
the real culprit of the murders
is someone else.

701
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:42,198
And if that real culprit was the one
who tipped us off,

702
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,368
you two might be in danger.

703
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:47,745
Therefore…

704
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:53,292
I'm going to investigate this case
from square one.

705
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:17,942
Not again.

706
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,278
Darn it.

707
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,363
Ma'am.

708
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:25,116
I keep getting the same thing.

709
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:27,076
That's how it works.

710
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,453
What do you want?

711
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:30,413
Dr. Hollow.

712
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:39,130
Thank him for the clothes for me.

713
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:40,715
Sure.

714
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:45,428
Oh. The plant is doing well.

715
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:47,555
I can see that.

716
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:50,141
Did the water leak stop?

717
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:52,393
Fortunately, yes.

718
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:54,395
Oh, right.

719
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:08,618
You know, Dr. Hollow shares his heart.

720
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:15,500
A piece of his heart is enough to bring
warmth to people who were shivering

721
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:19,545
and to encourage people to live again
when they want to die.

722
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,756
I like Spider-Man, though.

723
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,891
The soup was

724
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:35,436
as warm as his heart.

725
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:40,983
So were the digestive tablets,

726
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:43,069
the candy,

727
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:45,446
and our trip to Gangneung.

728
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,326
Thank you for everything.

729
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,832
Though you probably
already figured it out.

730
01:03:59,126 --> 01:04:01,754
And I wanted to apologize to you.

731
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:06,300
If I had…

732
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:10,763
warned you more properly and sooner…

733
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,101
He was your patient.

734
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:20,147
I wouldn't have been able to tell you
if he'd been my hotel guest.

735
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:25,027
You did everything…

736
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,406
you could.

737
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:36,038
Thank you for saying that.

738
01:04:50,928 --> 01:04:51,971
Do you know

739
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:56,434
what it feels like to want to drink
with strangers?

740
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:01,480
You have no reason to be shy

741
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,649
since you will never see them again.

742
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:08,988
And you won't be teased the next day
no matter how drunk you are

743
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:11,115
or how long you stay in the bathroom.

744
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:15,494
Speaking of which,

745
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:19,123
you know, you and I

746
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:22,335
have been through a lot lately.

747
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:25,588
Okay. Let's do that.

748
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:33,179
How did you figure it out
even before I told you?

749
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:37,516
I'll just treat you like my neighbor.

750
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:41,979
I won't ask you if you're okay,
if you had any sleep,

751
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:46,150
or if your mother threw someone else
into the water again.

752
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:48,235
I won't ask you such questions.

753
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:51,489
I'll bring you misdelivered packages.

754
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,368
You can break my shower head

755
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:58,245
or dump unwanted plants on me.

756
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:00,289
That's fine by me.

757
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:06,420
Actually, there's one more plant
I want to dump on you.

758
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:13,594
So we're good, right?

759
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:20,953
I wanted to pay him back
for the pizza, but he's not answering.

760
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:24,582
I guess you've made a lot of money,
Young-do.

761
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:26,917
Pardon? What did you say?

762
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:29,211
What? Nothing.

763
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:32,423
Can you turn on the radio? Put on TVC.

764
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:33,507
Okay.

765
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:44,602
When someone gets close to you
and you feel uncomfortable around them,

766
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:48,439
it might mean you're scared

767
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:52,735
that you might end up liking them.

768
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:06,123
"If she sees the real me
and gets to know everything about me,

769
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:08,125
she'll be disappointed and leave."

770
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:09,919
Or…

771
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:15,299
"After going through all that trouble,
I'm falling for someone again."

772
01:08:16,383 --> 01:08:19,303
Gosh. I totally know what that's like.

773
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:23,724
Now when I'm about to fall for someone,
I no longer feel excited.

774
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:25,893
I think, "Gosh, I'm doomed.

775
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:29,480
I'm in big trouble."

776
01:08:30,022 --> 01:08:31,816
That comes to my mind first.

777
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:37,071
Is that what happens to you, too?

778
01:08:38,572 --> 01:08:39,824
I'm not sure.

779
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:43,869
I don't remember as it's been
a long time since I liked someone.

780
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:25,870
I'm in trouble.

781
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:46,182
The guest checked in around 8 p.m.

782
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:50,144
The check-in was very smooth. And
they had dinner at a Korean restaurant

783
01:09:50,227 --> 01:09:52,271
with the people from the hospital.

784
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,440
Was there no problem with the dinner?

785
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:57,109
Allison Kent asked for a vegan meal.
What about that?

786
01:09:58,652 --> 01:10:00,529
Peanut allergy,

787
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,865
and lactose silence…

788
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:04,992
Lactose intolerance.

789
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:08,204
Right, that. Everything was smooth
including that.

790
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:09,747
They all enjoyed the meal.

791
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:12,416
You know,
there was a Korean American doctor.

792
01:10:12,499 --> 01:10:15,211
Dr. Chase? He was the one
who couldn't eat any spicy food.

793
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:17,046
A big no for kimchi.

794
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:18,422
And…

795
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:19,798
Oh, right.

796
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:23,844
One of the secretaries is so hot.

797
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:27,431
Seriously. Secretaries and their mugs…

798
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,893
Watch your language.

799
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:32,686
Don't use such words.

800
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:34,438
Mr. Choo.

801
01:10:34,521 --> 01:10:35,981
He gave me his business card.

802
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,275
He's giving me a signal, right?

803
01:10:39,443 --> 01:10:40,986
I was just joking.

804
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,656
I would never hit on someone from work.

805
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:44,782
But can't I?

806
01:10:44,865 --> 01:10:47,243
-It's not against the policy.
-Yes, it is.

807
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:49,620
You can't call a guy from work privately.

808
01:10:49,703 --> 01:10:51,914
I was joking. How can I call him?

809
01:10:51,997 --> 01:10:54,375
I should text him.
"Are you asleep, my sun?"

810
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:56,585
Gosh. I'm going home.

811
01:10:57,628 --> 01:10:58,462
Bye.

812
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,591
Yes, this is Kang Da-jeong.

813
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:05,010
Room 8 on the 11th floor?

814
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:08,973
I see. I'll check on it right now
and call housekeeping.

815
01:11:09,056 --> 01:11:10,099
Okay.

816
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:26,573
Hello.

817
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:16,100
NANUM JEIL CHURCH

818
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:27,694
Hey, why did you pat me
on the head earlier?

819
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:36,161
Why did you pat me on the head?

820
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,580
Kids, let's take a photo.

821
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:42,126
Hurry and gather around. Hurry up.

822
01:13:43,293 --> 01:13:44,920
-Okay!
-Okay!

823
01:13:47,297 --> 01:13:49,508
It wasn't me who patted you on the head.

824
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,301
Dummy.

825
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:53,387
What?

826
01:13:57,641 --> 01:13:59,184
What does he think I am, his toy?

827
01:14:05,065 --> 01:14:06,400
A doppelgänger.

828
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:09,987
Do you think they exist?

829
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:11,697
His death didn't make sense.

830
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:14,700
Someone who looks just like him
showed up. I should check him out.

831
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:18,579
We'll see where Young-do's heart lies.

832
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:22,541
What if it's just glass, not bulletproof?

833
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:24,460
You can go to a hospital if it breaks.

834
01:14:26,211 --> 01:14:29,798
You'd better not be curious
about me. Never again.

835
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:30,757
MISSED CALLS
KANG DA-JEONG

836
01:14:30,841 --> 01:14:33,760
How much time do we have?

837
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:38,390
