1
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,158
When I ran over,

2
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,121
he wasn't there.

3
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,385
He…

4
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,471
was nowhere.

5
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,940
He was never there…

6
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,484
to begin with.

7
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:19,407
DECEMBER 1994, SEOUL

8
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,337
Their story

9
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:38,509
had already begun a long time ago
in this town that seemed peaceful.

10
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:49,354
The child didn't receive any presents
again last Christmas,

11
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:54,150
but she thought it was because she shed
some tears while yawning.

12
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,193
All done.

13
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,280
She believed in Santa Claus.

14
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,794
Here's her father.

15
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:18,675
No one thought lowly of him
besides himself,

16
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:22,220
but he never realized that,
so he drank every day.

17
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,946
That's 800 won.

18
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,740
That's 2,000 won.

19
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,913
They don't look good.

20
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,624
I'll only take the soy sauce.

21
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,225
Here's the child's mother.

22
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,270
Everyone in the neighborhood knew

23
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,189
what she was going through.

24
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,777
But the mother had to put
something else before her pride.

25
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,822
SANGJI GROCERY

26
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,452
Hey, you! You'd better stop right there!

27
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,912
My name is Kang Da-jeong.

28
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,998
I heard you're giving out food.

29
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,499
Like bread.

30
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,627
Books are much more valuable than bread.

31
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,047
They can satisfy your spiritual hunger.

32
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,841
God will save us through His words.

33
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:46,971
No way.

34
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,058
-Da-jeong, what about the bread?
-It was a lie.

35
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,895
Why didn't Santa Claus come to our house?

36
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:03,112
He did. He came, but he spat…

37
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,619
He suddenly had to use the bathroom,
so he went to take a dump.

38
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:10,995
He really needed to go.

39
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,955
I see.

40
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,314
Let's hurry back.

41
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,693
Da-jeong, why is your face red?

42
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,612
What are you talking about? Be quiet.

43
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,156
Da-jeong, your face is bleeding.

44
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,075
Do you want your nose to bleed?

45
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:03,714
Mom.

46
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:08,010
The mermaid turned into bubbles.
What does that mean?

47
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,430
THE LITTLE MERMAID

48
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,481
A princess who has the world at her feet
falls for some guy she barely knows.

49
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,943
So she ditches her family and goes away.

50
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,155
But after going through so much hardship,
she ends up…

51
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,366
She ends up dying.

52
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,285
I want another book.

53
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,327
THE HAPPY PRINCE

54
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:42,837
The bird really digs out the prince's
left eyeball and gives it to a beggar.

55
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,758
The next day, it digs out the other
eyeball and gives it to another beggar.

56
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,471
And the bird lies on the cold ground
with its belly exposed

57
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,097
and dies.

58
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,390
SNOW WHITE

59
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,977
She's just so happy to receive the apple
and eats it right away.

60
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,563
So she dies.

61
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,983
But the dwarfs weep
because they don't want her to die.

62
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,318
THE FAIRY AND THE WOODCUTTER

63
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:09,155
A stupid fairy takes off her clothes
and scrubs her body in another town.

64
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:13,826
And some thief steals her clothes
and cuts a deal with her.

65
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,287
THE BLACK CAT

66
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,208
An alcoholic jerk kills his wife.

67
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,378
He puts her body in the wall
and covers it up with cement.

68
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,297
So no one knows about it.

69
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,390
But a black cat that was also put
in the wall with her body

70
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,894
meows when the police come.

71
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,648
So the jerk gets arrested.

72
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,484
I see.

73
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:53,324
The child read The Black Cat
over and over again.

74
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,662
Because out of all the stories
she could find in her world,

75
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,706
it was the most reassuring.

76
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,961
Please stop it!

77
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,797
Why must I live like this? Why?

78
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,049
It's all because of you.

79
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:13,469
My life was ruined
because I ended up with a woman like you!

80
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,637
I didn't make you stay!

81
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,557
Just leave! Please!

82
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,766
Damn it.

83
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,352
What? You want me to leave?

84
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,478
Is that it?

85
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,232
-After I put up with a stupid woman
-I bought tangerines, kids!

86
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,567
-like you?
-Dad!

87
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,988
-Please…
-Come here!

88
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,741
Damn it. Hey!

89
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:51,465
How come those darned kids
don't come out to greet their father?

90
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,259
-Please don't…
-Damn it. Come out!

91
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,510
-Please.
-Hey!

92
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,142
Don't you lay a finger on them,

93
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,687
-or I'll kill you.
-Fine.

94
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,149
You already ruined my life anyway.

95
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,734
Kill me.

96
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,861
Just kill me!

97
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,198
Da-jeong.

98
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,971
Her younger brother
didn't know how to read,

99
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,892
and she had a knack
for reinterpreting the stories.

100
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,229
So in their room, the plot
of The Black Cat changed every night.

101
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,025
Once upon a time, there was a girl.

102
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:54,987
It turned out that
her father wasn't her real father.

103
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,032
The man next door was her real father.

104
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:02,078
So they lived happily ever after.

105
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,123
The end.

106
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,132
Once upon a time, there was a girl.

107
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,512
The next-door neighbors turned out
to be her real family.

108
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,348
So she lived happily ever after with them.

109
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,558
The end.

110
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,727
Read me another story.

111
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,939
A story with a prince.

112
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,654
Do you know what happens to you

113
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,281
if you like princes or princesses?

114
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,576
You'll turn into bubbles,
get pricked by a needle,

115
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,787
or get poisoned to death.

116
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,456
Your eyeballs will be dug out
and your clothes stolen.

117
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,375
THE LITTLE MERMAID

118
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,501
You're lying.

119
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,795
That's what Mom said.

120
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,173
UNDERSTANDING CLASSICAL LITERATURE

121
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,466
LITERARY AESTHETICS

122
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,135
Turning into bubbles means…

123
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,302
LITERATURE, DIALECTICS OF SYMBOLS

124
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,847
…that she chooses to dissipate

125
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:07,393
after her arduous attempt
to make things better.

126
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,938
Nothing comes free in life.

127
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,857
LITTLE LOVE TWINKLES IN MY HEART

128
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,025
You give them a leg,
and they take your tongue.

129
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,154
But in life…

130
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,543
I'll take the photo now.

131
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,628
One, two, three.

132
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:45,306
TO MY NATASHA, MI-RAN
FROM CHAN

133
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,894
"Natasha, the White Donkey, and Me."

134
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,188
By Baek Seok.

135
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,648
"Tonight the snow falls endlessly

136
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,568
because I, a poor man,

137
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:01,489
love the beautiful Natasha."

138
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,205
In life,

139
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,792
there are some things you can't say no to
despite your better judgment.

140
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,710
GRADUATION

141
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:19,548
They are dazzling, bright,
and make you so happy

142
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,677
that you'd do anything
if you could have them.

143
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,660
When these things bewitch you,

144
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:52,164
you willingly give yourself up to them.

145
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,794
Even when you get your hands on a knife,

146
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,840
the only thing you can stab is
your own foot.

147
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,293
Like any other young and delicate being,

148
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:42,256
the child had dreams
and looked for things to depend on.

149
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:47,928
The difference was that she didn't want
to be a princess,

150
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,139
but dreamed of being
her neighbor's daughter.

151
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:55,811
And she wasn't waiting
for Prince Charming to rescue her,

152
00:14:56,312 --> 00:15:03,152
but for a black cat who would meow for her
in the scariest moment of her life.

153
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,545
Da-jeong. Get up and get dressed now.

154
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,049
Mom.

155
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:29,303
-But the man next door…
-Quiet.

156
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:53,095
The child thought
that she had run far away

157
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,180
from her unfortunate seven-year-old self.

158
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,767
However…

159
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:04,648
DECEMBER 2020, SEOUL

160
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:35,763
Yes. I'm on my way there. After getting
off the bus, do I turn right?

161
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,848
In the direction I came from?

162
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:41,268
EPISODE 1

163
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,561
I see.

164
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,068
In the direction the bus was going?

165
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,031
I know. I was just checking.

166
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,911
What are you talking about?
My nickname is Kang GPS.

167
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,455
GUGU BUILDING
2ND AND 3RD FLOORS FOR RENT

168
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,500
You have the worst sense of direction.

169
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,461
How can you get lost there?
How do you even go to work?

170
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,296
I didn't get lost.

171
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,965
I was just looking around
my new neighborhood.

172
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,592
Are you really moving in here?

173
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,095
I'm signing the contract today.

174
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,722
Why? You don't want me to?

175
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,022
I like that it's a new building.

176
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,691
I'm going to start afresh
with a clean slate.

177
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,736
You know I got mixed up with some weirdos.

178
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,904
Just weirdos?

179
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,575
You ought to be in the Olympics.
You'd win a gold in collecting trash.

180
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,619
Don't exaggerate now.

181
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:41,537
What?

182
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,289
An alcoholic, a two-timer,

183
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,876
a pathological liar, and a bum
who asked his girlfriend for money.

184
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,878
That was a long time ago.

185
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,505
That was this year.

186
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:57,052
I think only good things will happen here.
You know my hunches are right.

187
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,680
No, your hunches are usually wrong.

188
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:17,823
This is nice.

189
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,953
Hey, cover yourself.
Today's rainwater is dirty.

190
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,210
It's the smell of a new start!

191
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:13,378
I'm in Pungji-dong
where the murder took place.

192
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,589
The building was recently renovated,

193
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:19,218
and some tenants were scheduled
to move in starting today.

194
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,346
The entire building was empty
at the estimated time of the murder.

195
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,972
The police began investigating

196
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,392
using the security and dashcam footage
from around the building.

197
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:39,947
Generally speaking, an abandoned body
means the culprit was flustered.

198
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,865
But in this case, it's the contrary.

199
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,368
By abandoning the body,
the killer took it further.

200
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,829
After getting the answer they wanted
by choking the victim,

201
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,873
the culprit pretended
to release their hold,

202
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,167
stabbed the victim in the back,

203
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,337
then left the body for everyone to see.

204

JU YOUNG-DO, PSYCHIATRIST

205
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,841
IS IT POSSIBLE
THE CULPRIT IS MENTALLY ILL?

206
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,718
That's a difficult question to answer.

207
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,722
Being mentally ill doesn't make one
prone to commit more crimes.

208
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:10,018
Lacking MAO genes
or growing up in an abusive environment

209
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,145
doesn't cause antisocial behaviors either.

210
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,899
Mental illnesses
and childhood environments

211
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:19,486
can only be factors
for a small minority of criminals.

212
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,030
So it could be a discriminatory notion.

213
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:28,203
JU YOUNG-DO, PSYCHIATRIST
SO IT COULD BE A DISCRIMINATORY NOTION

215
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,625
MURDER OF LEE JEONG-BEOM
IN PUNGJI-DONG, 2018

216
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:59,151
My goodness. What the…
Why would you blow into my ear?

217
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,279
Why are you looking at me like that?

218
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,198
Why?

219
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:11,747
You're not a cop, but you come here
and sit in my chair whenever you want.

220
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,584
And you're reading the same case report
for the 3,000th time.

221
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:19,421
People might think that you're cuckoo,
but you're a doctor who treats cuckoos.

222
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,090
That's why.

223
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,469
I told you that the patients I treat
aren't crazy. They're just sick.

224
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,179
Real cuckoos end up here.

225
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,639
Say hello, Detective Park.

226
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,059
This is our rookie.

227
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,102
Hello. I'm Park Ho.

228
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,354
Nice to meet you. I'm Ju Young-do.

229
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:40,108
He's our consultant. He's somewhat useful.

230
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,781
Why are you reading it again?

231
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,283
If I found anything,
I would have called you.

232
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:55,540
I understand that you want to do something
for your heart donor,

233
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,126
but I was his senior officer.

234
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,921
And I couldn't even catch his killer.

235
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,807
What is it this time?

236
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,567
That's a strong heart.

237
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,070
Jeong-beom's heart

238
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,364
is still beating.

239
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,662
Your food is here.

240
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:35,997
I'll get going.

241
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,584
Leave already?
Have some food before you go.

242
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,170
-I need to go and pack.
-Are you going somewhere?

243
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,172
My clinic is relocating to the third floor

244
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,174
of Gugu Building
where the murder happened.

245
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,301
That's our district. Is it around it?

246
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,803
I told you, it's that building.

247
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,264
2ND FLOOR FOR RENT

00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,724
JU YOUNG-DO PSYCHIATRY CLINIC

249
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,987
You're arriving today, right?

250
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,946
Pardon?

251
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,615
Yes. I am.

252
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,950
Name?

253
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,077
Ju Young-do.

254
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,121
Elderly, right?

255
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,665
I'm not that old.

256
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,208
Wait.

257
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,253
Who are you? You're so rude.

258
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,088
I'll talk to the hotel in Busan.

259
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,883
But the elderly tend to prefer
the floor heating system,

260
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,801
so I'm not sure if I can get it changed.

261
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,515
I want jjamppong.

262
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,851
-Come upstairs.
-Where?

263
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,715
What are you doing here?

264
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,843
Jjajangmyeon or jjamppong?

265
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:16,264
-It was you?
-It wasn't me.

266
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:19,809
What are you talking about?

267
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,937
Whatever. I want to be alone.

268
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,271
I was about to go upstairs.

269
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,648
So which one is it?

270
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:28,860
Me too.

271
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,738
What?

272
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:35,325
I want jjamppong, too.

273
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:37,869
It looks so good.

274
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,416
You've never met, right?

275
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,336
He used to be my private tutor.
And she's my friend.

276
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:48,505
She's not your friend. She's my friend.

277
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,925
-I'm Kang Da-jeong.
-I'm Ju Young-do.

278
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:55,178
Right. I know.
I also know you're not that old.

279
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,389
Right.

280
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,647
You spilled coffee beans this morning
and food now.

281
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,192
What are you going to spill
in the evening? Get a grip, will you?

282
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:18,243
Just because we were conceived
on the same day, which I never asked for,

283
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:21,079
we've had to split everything
in half since birth.

284
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,163
Not even a spoonful.

285
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,167
Fine.

286
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,129
You can gobble up
all of the carbs and salt.

287
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:32,299
That's enough.
We have instant sauce. Wait.

288
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,345
-Clean that up!
-Okay.

289
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,026
We need more tissues.

290
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,527
Okay.

291
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,451
-Hold on.
-Okay.

292
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,138
A concierge manager, right?

293
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:24,601
Yes.

294
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,479
Isn't it so cool?
He's really good at this.

295
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:28,855
He can guess everything.

296
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:38,948
Well, he heard my call earlier.
He must've figured out I work at a hotel.

297
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,784
Come on. He can do more than that.

298
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,119
Right. Young-do, do that thing.

299
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,873
Same thing.

300
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,543
What else can you do? Give me an example.

301
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,671
Never mind.

302
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:58,051
-What is it?
-I'll pretend I didn't see it.

303
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,012
See what?

304
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:07,102
Everyone has stories they want to hide
and things they don't want to hear,

305
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,437
even if it's true.

306
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,981
So telling the truth
can be a form of assault.

307
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,818
What do I want to hide?

308
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,153
It's okay. Everyone is like that.

309
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,242
Why don't you just tell me?
I'm curious now.

310
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:26,371
Right. I want to find out
why you only choose to date trash

311
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:29,749
and why you're turning down a decent man
when he wants to date you.

312
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,709
It's high time we found it out.

313
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,628
That's what he can figure out?

314
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:34,796
Totally.

315
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,007
It may be uneasy
to listen to the innermost truth

316
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:41,302
in front of other people,
especially for someone like Ms. Kang.

317
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,225
Maybe you spilled the beans
without even realizing it,

318
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,685
and he impressed you with it.

319
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:52,397
"You had a persimmon tree in the town
where you grew up

320
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,941
and a relative passed away
when you were young, right?"

321
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,317
I bet that's how he got you.

322
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,362
I'm pretty sure that's all fraud.

323
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:03,366
A legless bird, a trash magnet,
a black cat, and a red foxtail.

324
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,497
What is that? Some kind of password?

325
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,082
A legless bird.

326
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,335
You're scared of settling down.

327
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,672
You fear relationships
that require emotional commitment.

328
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,632
Why? You've been burned a lot.

329
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,635
You read the ending
of mystery novels first

330
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:26,556
and don't even watch a new TV show
unless you know it has a happy ending.

331
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,979
But I moved here to settle down.

332
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,564
You always start with that.

333
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,859
"I'm really starting anew.
It's different this time."

334
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,653
But in reality,
you're still a trash magnet.

335
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,156
Bad men constantly come into your life

336
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:46,242
when in fact,
you're the one attracting them.

337
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,662
Are you telling me
that I enjoy being abused?

338
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,874
After recreating the exact same misery
you underwent,

339
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,001
you try to overcome it this time around.

340
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:58,630
You're trying to escape
your miserable memories.

341
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:01,341
If your life was miserable
because of an alcoholic,

342
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:04,719
you date another alcoholic,
so you can help him quit drinking.

343
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,221
But it doesn't work. Why?

344
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,389
You can recreate your misery,

345
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,017
but you've never learned how
to overcome it.

346
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:14,145
Then, what's the memory
you want to escape so badly

347
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,897
that causes repetition compulsion?

348
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:18,733
The black cat.

349
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:24,239
You put the poster up in a place more
visible to others than yourself.

350
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:29,160
It means that the person you are looking
for or want is someone like a black cat.

351
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,997
In Poe's story, the cat comes back to life
even when it's killed,

352
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,959
and helps catch the killer by meowing
even after getting buried.

353
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,962
Your decision to hang a poster
other people find creepy

354
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:43,216
tells me that you identify with the victim
at a very high degree.

355
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,927
When you were young,
I think someone in your family…

356
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,389
Hey.

357
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:55,603
I'm sorry.
If I offended you, I will apologize.

358
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,646
Hey.

359
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,067
This is why I didn't…

360
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:05,280
But I'm curious about the red foxtail.

361
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,782
-Hey.
-Foxes aren't your animal.

362
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,243
He might be wrong about that.
Let's hear it.

363
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,620
He's been right so far, though.

364
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,663
Hey.

365
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,548
Leave family out of it.

366
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:40,231
What makes the red foxtail more charming
is that it is clearly a flower,

367
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,609
but it doesn't seem like it's showing off.

368
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:46,988
She probably doesn't like things
like flowers that are visibly pretty.

369
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,448
I think when she was young…

370
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,659
Without mentioning her family,

371
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:54,913
I'll get to the point.

372
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:00,376
You know that you're pretty, Ms. Kang.

373
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,473
What was that?

374
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:16,517
Was that your way of telling her
how you feel about her?

375
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,359
Hey, it's Kang Da-jeong!

376
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,948
Hey, it's my stalker.

377
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,631
Why do I have to introduce you two…

378
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:55,223
This is a man who's been chasing me
for over two months

379
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,433
when he doesn't even know me that well.

380
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,937
This is a man who assaulted me
when we just met today.

381
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,856
-I did?
-You said telling the truth

382
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,650
is also a form of assault.

383
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,244
Well, what do you say?

384
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,663
Since there are three of us,
should we play some cards?

385
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,248
Let's play next time.

386
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,001
I came here today
because I have something to tell you.

387
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,254
I'll leave you to it.

388
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:37,807
JU YOUNG-DO PSYCHIATRY CLINIC

389
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,268
He's on the third floor?
He's a psychiatrist?

390
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,687
A doctor ought to alleviate people's pain,

391
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,190
but he rubs salt in the wound instead.

392
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:56,909
Are you going somewhere?

393
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,247
Or do you just want to walk with me?

394
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,043
-Or…
-I'm trying to ditch you.

395
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,212
It's a great day for a walk, right?

396
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,590
The air's quite clean today.

397
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:13,926
Right. You can clean out your nostrils.
Good for you.

398
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,596
You really won't take this?

399
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,390
Don't waste it on me.

400
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,767
This flower means--

401
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,352
"I'll die in a week." That's probably it.

402
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,021
Gosh. No way.

403
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,445
What's your problem?

404
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,447
Why do you keep doing this?

405
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,241
Because I'm not joking around.
I'm serious.

406
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:42,163
Did I provoke your competitiveness?

407
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:46,084
Or did someone tell you
that I'm a rich heiress, but I live

408
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,543
on the rooftop for kicks?

409
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,630
Why do you keep chasing me
when you barely know me?

410
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:54,050
Why do you keep turning me down
when you barely know me?

411
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,974
You're chasing a woman
after seeing her at a hotel.

412
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,352
And you tell me you like me,
but you bring me

413
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,354
some dead plant without its root.

414
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,731
Ms. Kang.

415
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:12,944
Other people call this a flower
and it makes them happy.

416
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:20,576
Even if I put it in water with some ice,
it will wither in a few days.

417
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,453
And the water will rot and stink.

418
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,332
I can't even recycle it,
so I have to throw it out.

419
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,960
But the thorns will rip the trash bag.

420
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,754
And the trash will spill out,
and my finger will bleed.

421
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,465
Gosh. Trash.

422
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,801
This is why I like you.

423
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,137
You're fun to be around.

424
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,598
Congratulations
on finding your entertainment.

425
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:48,521
You remind me of someone who would
actively fall for voice phishing.

426
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,233
"Hello, this is the police."
After hearing just that,

427
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:55,194
you'd say, "Gosh.
Here's my bank account number.

428
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:58,698
And this is my passcode.
Someone must've used my account illegally.

429
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:01,284
Then where should I wire
my entire savings?"

430
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:05,538
What's up with today?
Why is everyone analyzing me?

431
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,249
I'll just throw the flower away.

432
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,170
You can't…

433
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,963
What's important

434
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:17,592
is that you don't hate me.

435
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,051
Right?

436
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,013
Because…

437
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:25,892
I seem like a fool
who'd fall for voice phishing easily?

438
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:28,144
I think you're just scared
of relationships.

439
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,691
And if that's the case, you can date me.

440
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,234
Go out with me.

441
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,323
You should.

442
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,872
I'll be back tomorrow.

443
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,291
I was going somewhere.
I just stopped by to see you.

444
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,793
Gosh, I'm late.

445
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,101
We have a VVIP group coming in today.

446
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,520
They asked for an extra humidifier
and air purifier.

447
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,440
You all read the notice
about the drama shoot, right?

448
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,775
-Yes.
-Yes.

449
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:16,943
Please cooperate,

450
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:20,071
but if you see them smoking,
don't let it slide.

451
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:22,490
Tell them to put it out
and report it right away.

452
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:28,579
Just to be clear, you can't put
profanity in your report like somebody.

453
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:34,043
You can't write things like,
"The production crew is going crazy."

454
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:41,717
Jeong-bin, this is your first time.
Don't just rely on the fire alarms.

455
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,303
The previous crew disassembled them
just to smoke.

456
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,180
Gosh, that's pretty bold.

457
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:47,765
I understand.

458
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,477
-Mr. Min.
-Yes?

459
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,730
Do you have anything else to add
regarding the drama shoot?

460
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,990
Gosh. I can't believe
I'll be seeing Ahn Ga-yeong in person.

461
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:06,534
But that's all makeup, right?

462
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,327
Without the makeup,

463
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,580
she must have blemishes
like freckles or dark spots, right?

464
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,916
Should I ask her when I see her?

465
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,419
I'm joking.

466
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:19,672
You know,
Ahn Ga-yeong had her wedding at our hotel.

467
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,174
It'd feel weird to film
a wedding scene here.

468
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,175
Right?

469
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:33,311
-You can't…
-What's important

470
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:38,524
is that you don't hate me.

471
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,692
Right?

472
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,652
-What is it?
-What?

473
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,114
Oh. It's nothing.

474
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,373
Put it inside, please.

475
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,346
How many times

476
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:10,723
have I…

477
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,936
thrown myself into the trash can?

478
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:25,696
5 YEARS AGO

479
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,917
The person you are trying to reach

480
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,794
is unavailable. Please leave a message.

481
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,215
I'm at Hongdae.

482
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:49,011
Answer your phone. I'm worried.

483
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:54,767
Hold on.

484
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:58,771
Sit.

485
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,824
Why are you dating me?

486
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,704
Be honest. You're sick of me.

487
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,832
I can see through you.

488
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:44,733
Drink some water.

489
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,028
I'll call you in the morning.

490
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:08,799
How come those darned kids
don't come out to greet their father?

491
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,801
-Please don't…
-Damn it. Come out!

492
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,678
-Please.
-Hey!

493
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,766
Don't you lay a finger on them,

494
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,019
or I'll kill you.

495
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:23,731
Fine.

496
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,859
You already ruined my life anyway.

497
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,987
Kill me. Just kill me!

498
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:33,991
Please…

499
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,160
Come here!

500
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,669
The seven-year-old girl

501
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,005
who wanted to sleep.

502
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,509
How many times

503
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,428
have I woken her up?

504
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:09,568
To scrape off an old scab,

505
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,321
I was hurting

506
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,866
the healed skin as well.

507
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,159
I'll get going.

508
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:29,713
Hey.

509
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,382
It's Kang Da-jeong.

510
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:33,509
Hey…

511
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:38,055
My stalker waits for me
even at the bus stop now.

512
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,361
You got hurt. Did it bleed a lot?

513
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,280
You don't feel dizzy?

514
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,700
Given your condition,

515
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,244
you should have a meal with me right now.

516
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,463
Has anyone called you trash?

517
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:16,343
Do you hate the thought
of eating with me that much?

518
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:21,098
Alcohol, drugs, lying, cheating,
perverted behaviors,

519
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,558
ghosting, and assault.

520
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,728
Have you done any of these?

521
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,861
Do you finally have questions for me?

522
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:46,540
I can't tell you here.

523
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:53,088
Your usual. And the same for you.

524
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,730
When I first saw you at the hotel…

525
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,192
"She's the one."

526
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,403
I could sense it.

527
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,325
If you heard bells or something--

528
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:22,826
Sometimes I see

529
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,538
my childhood memories in my dreams.

530
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,585
It was snowing a lot.

531
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,381
There were tangerines at home,

532
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:38,634
so I was watching TV while eating them.

533
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,681
It was really ordinary.

534
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,017
But I guess it was

535
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,770
the happiest day of my life.

536
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:56,443
When I first saw you,
that scene flashed through my head.

537
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,989
And…

538
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,830
in that room,

539
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:15,087
you were…

540
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,759
by my side.

541
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:23,679
You were smiling.

542
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:27,975
You can…

543
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:32,813
take your time.

544
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:49,204
Did you tell Mr. Hong?

545
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,539
You like tangerines.

546
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,958
What are you talking about?
What about him?

547
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,752
He bought tangerines.

548
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:57,838
Tangerines. Poems.

549
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,757
I don't like those presents.

550
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,344
Mom, you like handbags.

551
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:08,640
He should have brought tangerines
in a handbag. A plastic bag? How dare he?

552
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:12,561
So what if they're sweet and pretty?
They're just fruit.

553
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,273
Why did he think of me
when he saw tangerines?

554
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,361
Is using tangerines
to confess your feelings a trend?

555
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,532
Did someone get some for you?

556
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,619
What does he do? He's not ugly, right?

557
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:31,246
I don't know him that well yet,

558
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,458
but he said what I like to hear.

559
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:40,756
Something about eating tangerines
in a warm room

560
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:45,052
while watching TV on a snowy day.

561
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:59,316
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR RELOCATION
FROM AHN GA-YEONG

562
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,073
You still work here, Ms. Oh.

563
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,161
I can see that you've been well.

564
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:14,164
Look at those babies.

565
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,208
Both top and bottom.

566
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:17,292
I have been well

567
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,046
as I've been hassle-free
for the past few years.

568
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,090
Right up until a moment ago.

569
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,718
Gosh. This scarf is beautiful, isn't it?

570
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,804
He gave me the same one.

571
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,139
Was it last year? Or two years ago?

572
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:33,684
Anyway, it was long ago.

573
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:38,355
I should find it and give it away.
Where did I shove it?

574
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,733
Okay. She will tell you what to do.

575
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:45,988
I'm here.

576
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,996
You don't want me here.
I'll wait downstairs.

577
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,500
-I'll see you around.
-Okay.

578
00:47:59,084 --> 00:47:59,918
Sure.

579
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:01,712
Okay.

580
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,012
Goodbye.

581
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,683
A psychiatrist's personal life
can't be known to patients.

582
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:16,602
Transference is needed in therapy,

583
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:19,021
and the more information they have on me--

584
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:22,357
Fine. Yes. I know.
It will be hard for you to treat them.

585
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,820
I heard that when you exploded on me for
putting our wedding photo at the clinic.

586
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,697
Then why are you doing this?

587
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:35,996
People don't think a couple can
stay friends after their divorce.

588
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,206
But we can. Are we not normal?

589
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,751
No. You're being really weird right now.

590
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:43,337
We didn't get a divorce
because one of us messed up.

591
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,546
We didn't break up…

592
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:49,384
because I'm crazy or anything.

593
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,848
How could you not be happy to see me?

594
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,518
-Have you been getting counseling?
-Aren't you tired

595
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,646
of wondering if I'm crazy or not?

596
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,439
Is that the only question you have?

597
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:03,607
No.

598
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,320
How many sleeping pills do you take?

599
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,405
Two?

600
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:11,907
Three?

601
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,242
-Four?
-Four…

602
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,037
You doubled it?

603
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,540
Was that your request or…

604
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,751
Maybe it's because you nag twice as much.

605
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,631
What's the matter?

606
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:30,550
Why are you asking?
You won't even help me.

607
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,344
You won't treat people you know.

608
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:34,513
You came to tell me anyway, didn't you?

609
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:39,059
I'll leave without telling you.
That way, you'll worry about me.

610
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,772
I'm very sick.

611
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,280
Yes. Bring the car to the main road.

612
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,982
Hey. I just saw Ahn Ga-yeong.

613
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,109
She's filming a drama
at the hotel next week.

614
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,236
She even got married at the hotel.

615
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,363
Why?

616
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,116
-What?
-Be quiet.

617
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,535
What?

618
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:40,120
Look.

619
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,205
Yes. That's the hotel I work at.

620
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,415
Exactly.

621
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:46,835
Don't just look at the photo.
Read what it says here.

622
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:50,297
"Actress Ahn Ga-yeong and Psychiatrist Ju,

623
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,966
who was the medical consultant
for Doctor Criminal,

624
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:55,427
get divorced after only a year…"

625
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,390
Have a good day.

626
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:06,646
Thank you. Bye.

627
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:12,861
-I told you.
-That's why…

628
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,281
He did look familiar, neck down.

629
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:20,076
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR RELOCATION
FROM AHN GA-YEONG

630
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,746
-Wait.
-Gosh.

631
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:26,541
Goodness. There you go again. Gosh.

632
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:30,712
Ms. Oh told me to throw this out.

633
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,590
But the plant is still alive.

634
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:36,551
You think so?

635
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,095
She says the plant is cursed.

636
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,765
But it was a present.

637
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,976
If this stays, I go.

638
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,645
End of story.

639
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:18,760
Oh, no.

640
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:20,780
Oh, no!

641
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,244
Let's put this here for now.

642
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:27,787
I'll look for a bigger bucket.

643
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,497
Okay.

644
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:31,833
You still don't think the plant is cursed?

645
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:42,844
Cheol-do.

646
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:46,598
Can you check on the fourth floor?
There's a water leak.

647
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:51,144
But Da-jeong went to a convenience store
since the coffee shop was full earlier.

648
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:53,229
I see.

649
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,776
You washed your hair.

650
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,657
I often wash my hair at night.

651
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,451
Are you here to see me?

652
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:08,620
Don't be silly.

653
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,957
I often sit on this bench.

654
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,709
I see. I mean,

655
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:18,546
you were on the bench I could easily see
from the car, so I was just wondering.

656
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,548
I'm very busy right now.

657
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:21,800
06M 5381

658
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,176
Are you free this weekend?

659
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,845
I'm busy on the weekend, too.

660
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,430
Come on.

661
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:32,852
What? Do you think I'm in my bed all day

662
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:36,022
watching Guardian and reciting
Eun-tak's lines again and again?

663
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,941
Is that how you spend your weekend?

664
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:42,237
No, it's not.

665
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,448
Gosh. I lost my focus.

666
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:47,909
You're reading entertainment news.

667
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:51,413
It's about a drama
that will be filmed at the hotel!

668
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:53,665
I see. Okay.

669
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:01,881
"Akheubukjutdan."

670
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:04,217
Is it a Russian drama?

671
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,388
Who said you could look?

672
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:14,519
You're leaving your coffee for me?

673
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:15,603
Can I drink it?

674
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,772
-There's a water leak.
-This weekend…

675
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,950
I thought you guys were done talking.

676
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,038
We are.

677
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,373
What about the water leak?

678
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,418
Let me go up and check on it.

679
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,462
-Now?
-Is it too late?

680
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,385
Let's just call a plumber.

681
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:52,515
The leak might be caused
by a pool of water.

682
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,601
Let me turn on the water.

683
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:57,145
Be gentle.
I cranked up the water pressure.

684
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:58,146
Oh, no.

685
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:01,441
-Goodness.
-Gosh.

686
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,359
Goodness! Oh, my!

687
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,449
Hold on.

688
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:21,836
Hey, Mom.

689
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,631
I'll call you later.
I'm watching a cobra show.

690
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:27,092
No. I'm okay.

691
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,510
That cobra…

692
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,230
It's dead.

693
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:55,453
I'll buy you the same one.

694
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,042
I don't see any water trapped here.

695
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,378
I don't get why it's leaking.

696
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,464
I should have called a plumber.

697
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:12,762
Can I check your washing machine
just in case?

698
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,105
Maybe another time.

699
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,992
If you don't have a passport too,

700
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:36,828
you won't get
the health insurance benefits.

701
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:38,371
Is that okay?

702
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,520
Hello.

703
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:16,117
You see patients at night, too.

704
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,870
You work at a university hospital as well.

705
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:22,040
Please sit.

706
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,501
Do I have to?

707
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,631
No.

708
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,258
Suit yourself.

709
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:38,848
You're a US citizen.

710
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,268
You've seen a psychiatrist before, right?

711
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,854
-People there see shrinks--
-No.

712
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:47,774
I suddenly got upset today.

713
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:51,277
Why?

714
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,740
I think you're surveilling me.

715
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,789
Have you ever felt
you were being watched before?

716
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:08,002
You must think I'm really here
as your patient.

717
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:32,277
If you're not here as my patient…

718
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,115
Then what?

719
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:43,997
It's the other way around.

720
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:49,335
You walked into my sight.

721
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:52,589
Just like now.

722
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,353
Why did you put your foot under mine?

723
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:14,277
Is that what you mean?

724
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,243
I'm here as a patient.

725
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:25,747
That way, whatever I say,
you have to keep your mouth shut.

726
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:30,752
To keep your license.

727
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,176
Great.

728
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,514
Then did you come to my clinic--

729
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:44,807
Do you like Ms. Kang?

730
01:00:58,279 --> 01:00:59,489
Because I do.

731
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:07,330
CHAE JUN
AMERICAN

732
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:21,844
Do you think I bought a new jacket
to cover up the rapist's face?

733
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:24,055
I became a cop to catch bad guys,

734
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:27,350
but I'm their caretaker,
protecting their identities. Seriously.

735
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:30,019
Why do they always do this
during my mealtime?

736
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:31,312
Come on.

737
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:36,401
You know what? As soon as I catch
that bastard, I'm turning in my badge.

738
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:40,446
-What? You don't think I mean that?
-No.

739
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:43,991
What is it?

740
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:46,411
I brought a delicious treat.

741
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:50,581
Why didn't you come sooner?

742
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:53,459
I missed you a lot.

743
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,588
MURDER OF LEE JEONG-BEOM
IN PUNGJI-DONG, 2018

744
01:01:57,672 --> 01:01:59,340
About the Pungji-dong case,

745
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,843
do I have access to any files?

746
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:05,138
You can access anything in there.
You're our consultant.

747
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:07,265
Classified files won't open there anyway.

748
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:09,142
Really?

749
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:15,148
Why?

750
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:18,735
Are you scared to live in that building
because the culprit

751
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:19,861
hasn't been caught yet?

752
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:23,072
Goodness. Were you scared?

753
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:26,367
I was wondering if he would reveal himself
as a defensive behavior.

754
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:30,621
In layman's terms?

755
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:38,379
"The culprit always returns
to the scene of the crime."

756
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:44,761
THE MURDER CASE ON THE 3RD FLOOR
OF GUGU BUILDING…

757
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:48,264
If you had coffee,
let's drink water on the rooftop.

758
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:49,348
Shall we go upstairs?

759
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:50,266
No.

760
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,518
How about some air on the rooftop?

761
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:55,354
-Shall we?
-No.

762
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:02,612
Gosh. Random people
can come and go as they please.

763
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:04,989
I'm so worried. Should I walk you up?

764
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:07,116
No.

765
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:10,578
It won't work. What should I do?

766
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,789
Should I think about that upstairs?

767
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:13,873
No.

768
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:17,877
Right? Even if it's a rooftop,
it's your personal space.

769
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,296
Besides, it's quite late.
Can I still go up?

770
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:43,486
This is a present.

771
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:47,490
But it was in the hallway for a while.

772
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:56,833
"Congratulations on your relocation.
From Ahn Ga-yeong."

773
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:57,917
Oh, no.

774
01:04:05,883 --> 01:04:09,095
I didn't know you were divorced.

775
01:04:11,138 --> 01:04:13,558
Getting a divorce isn't a joke or a flaw.

776
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:15,059
Sorry about what I said.

777
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:19,814
What?

778
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:23,276
When we were having jjamppong,
you were so blunt, so out of anger, I said

779
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:28,281
you never date and are stuck at your
clinic because you always analyze people.

780
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:32,201
I said you would get a divorce within
a year since you have two hair whorls.

781
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:37,832
But I don't know much
about double hair whorls.

782
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:41,043
Well, is it like a two-horse carriage?
Or double headlights?

783
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:42,503
Or ssanghwacha?

784
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:45,631
You never said that.

785
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:51,429
Oh.

786
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:58,102
Actually, I said it to Eun-ha.

787
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:00,688
-I see.
-Anyway…

788
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:03,232
I'm sorry.

789
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,819
When we first met,
I said you were a trash magnet…

790
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:10,531
Anyway…

791
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:15,453
If you're sorry,
can you take care of this for me?

792
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,374
-No.
-But you said you're sorry.

793
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,085
Yes, I'm sorry, but no.

794
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:25,296
-Why not?
-I don't want to kill again.

795
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,174
-Who did you kill?
-Everything except that one.

796
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:32,386
Every plant I had including herbs
and cacti ended up dying.

797
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:33,721
Just water it occasionally.

798
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:35,723
They die
even when I water them diligently.

799
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:38,476
You probably watered them
until their roots rotted.

800
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:43,147
Whether it's dating or growing plants,
you give them

801
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:45,066
-every piece of you.
-That's enough.

802
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:47,026
Defense mechanisms just come out

803
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:49,362
without you even realizing it.

804
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,530
You might find this hard to hear, but--

805
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:54,575
Whether it's analyzing me, deducing,
or guessing, just stop it.

806
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:56,327
-Can I say one more thing?
-No.

807
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:58,120
-I'll just say it anyway.
-Stop it.

808
01:05:58,204 --> 01:05:59,664
Don't see him.

809
01:06:15,846 --> 01:06:16,931
I…

810
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,434
wasn't going to see him.

811
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,229
That's a relief.

812
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:30,611
All right, then.

813
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:33,948
Take your plant.

814
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:36,242
-No need to thank me.
-You must be crazy.

815
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:37,910
I'll come by from time to time.

816
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,371
-Come where? Who said you could do that?
-Thanks.

817
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:42,581
I really might end up killing it.

818
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,500
Have a good night, Ms. Kang.

819
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,988
06M 5381

820
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:54,487
VICTIM'S DETAILS
CHO GWANG-HUN

821
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:57,406
3RD FLOOR OF GUGU BUILDING

822
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:11,629
CRIME SCENE PHOTOS OF VICTIM

823
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:19,738
Hello.

824
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:22,158
You must think I'm here as your patient.

825
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:24,702
Why did you put your foot under mine?

826
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:28,205
Is that what you mean?

827
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:38,841
"The culprit always returns
to the scene of the crime."

828
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:15,854
You.

829
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:18,732
Stop seeing her.

830
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:40,129
Hey, it's Kang Da-jeong.

831
01:11:44,591 --> 01:11:47,136
Hey, it's her.

832
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:00,983
Sociopath.

833
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:50,783
Why did you tell me not to date him?

834
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:52,034
Do you like me?

835
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:57,122
I felt pressured to reciprocate
your feelings.

836
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:59,917
I'll be smiling like a fool
while looking at you.

837
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:02,044
In that dream of yours,

838
01:13:02,127 --> 01:13:03,587
was there a cat too?

839
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:07,174
"Year 2003, Anam-dong."

840
01:13:07,257 --> 01:13:10,427
I saw something eighteen years ago.
And it's bothering me.

841
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:14,723
Last time, you said you were looking
for an answer.

842
01:13:15,974 --> 01:13:17,476
Did you find it?

843
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:21,313
