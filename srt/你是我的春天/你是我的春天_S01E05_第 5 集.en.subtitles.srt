2
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,035
Wash up.

3
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,707
And put that on.

4
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,266
Eat.

5
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:53,882
Don't forget

6
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,968
how far I went for you.

7
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,435
A shadow…

8
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,938
shouldn't covet the light.

9
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,032
Because it'll vanish.

10
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:36,299
12 HOURS AGO

11
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,625
I knew you'd come crawling back soon.
You brat. Come here.

12
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,761
Look at you glaring at me.
I should teach you a lesson.

how far I went for you.

EPISODE 5

18
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,542
Ian Chase?

19
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,799
Are you Ian Chase?

20
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,468
Who are you?

21
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,804
I'm Ju Young-do.

22
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,015
Did you follow me?

23
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,351
No. I followed someone else's trail.

24
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,771
Was it Choi Jeong-min's?

25
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,441
So you know Choi Jeong-min.

26
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,492
-Are you a cop?
-No.

27
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,411
Then I don't need to answer that.

28
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:18,052
GUGU BUILDING

29
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,772
It's still a bit hot.

30
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,651
Thank you.

31
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:34,944
To the bus stop, right?

32
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,340
I saw Ian Chase yesterday.

33
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,305
I'm sorry.

34
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,600
For what?

35
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,478
I think you were telling me it was hot,

36
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:13,149
but I told you a cup of warm tea
would be good for you.

37
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,194
When you mentioned doppelgängers.

38
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,990
I didn't think
they'd look identical like that.

39
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,039
No.

40
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,711
When I told you it was hot,

41
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,214
you said, "I'll carry it with you."

42
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,925
That's what I heard.

43
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,569
Hey.

44
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,906
You're not following me
to the hotel, right?

45
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:04,992
No, but…

46
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,121
What if you were ten minutes late?

47
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,874
Then I would work ten minutes less today.

48
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,293
Want to eat ramyeon?

49
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,296
No way.

50
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,926
How could you ask me that so easily?

51
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,558
I see.
This is why people call you a flirt.

52
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,498
Of course. I should help.

53
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:56,001
What can you do?
He's pretending not to understand Korean.

54
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,796
Okay. I'll be right over.

55
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,718
Is it Aiden on the 25th floor?

56
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,555
Even the Offspring Care Services
can't handle that boy.

57
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,849
"Child Care Services."

58
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,144
I think he's so adorable. Why?

59
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,854
Yes, he looks adorable.

60
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,909
Don't hate him.
Don't be upset or fight with him.

61
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:32,705
Don't treat him like a monster.
He's just a kid.

62
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,171
Aiden.

63
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,051
Aiden, come on out.

64
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,262
In there.

65
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,292
I don't think
language is the problem here.

66
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,251
What do we do?

67
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,463
What should I do?

68
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:31,013
He's been in there for over four hours.
And he hasn't eaten at all.

69
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,857
Hello, Aiden. Aren't you hungry?

70
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,944
I'm going to have some bread here.
Want to eat some?

71
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,739
Be careful. He might throw things at you.

72
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,368
NAME: AIDEN

73
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,854
Did you find something?

74
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:35,911
Min-jun, I wonder why you keep eating
the cotton in your teddy bear?

75
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,500
Usually, when he wakes up in the morning,

76
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,460
he puts Bear on his bed.

77
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,171
And he puts a blanket over it
and comes out.

78
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,257
That's his routine.

79
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,928
But he hasn't put it down since yesterday.

80
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,101
Do you think Bear is hurt?

81
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:00,978
Is it injured here?

82
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,481
Did you think it was white blood?

83
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,031
Min-jun.

84
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,283
Should we make Bear's pain go away?

85
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,414
Mr. Vet,

86
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,167
please make Bear's pain go away.

87
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,714
Bear is doing great.

88
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,367
I was so moved.

89
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,330
Sure.

90
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,500
This guy is unbelievable.

91
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,127
I want to ask you about these drawings.

92
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,255
Can you call me when you're free?

93
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,024
HA-NEUL VETERINARY CLINIC

94
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:33,695
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable. Please leave a…

95
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,785
What?

96
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,955
Why is she video calling me?

97
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:43,872
Wait.

98
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:51,880
Hello?

99
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:53,841
Mr. Ju?

100
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,051
Are you there?

101
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,097
Why did you video call me?

102
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,475
I wanted to talk to you
while looking at the drawings.

103
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,727
-Are you free now?
-Yes, I am.

104
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,980
But your drawings don't look so okay.

105
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,606
Your drawings are awful.

106
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,234
I didn't draw them.

107
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,361
Did a boy at your hotel draw them?

108
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,362
Yes.

109
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,364
I want to know how he's feeling.

110
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,494
He put an X mark on the mommy dinosaur.

111
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,830
He drew the mommy dinosaur

112
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,916
and even colored her nicely.
But he put an X mark on her.

113
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,294
He must miss her and hate her
at the same time.

114
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,713
It's raining a lot in the first drawing.

115
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,759
Rain symbolizes the level of stress.

116
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,678
And it's pouring in that drawing.

117
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,930
On top of that,
the rain comes into the hotel.

118
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,601
He also drew himself, but he didn't
draw his hands. He only drew his feet.

119
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:50,105
It means he feels like it's difficult
to communicate with the world around him.

120
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:57,738
If I mention the word "mom" to this boy,
will it hurt his feelings?

121
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,452
Aiden, do you want to read a book?

122
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,746
There are a lot of fun books here.

123
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,168
WHERE DID YOU GO, DINOSAUR?

124
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,174
A long time ago,
there lived Baby Dinosaur.

125
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,884
One day, Papa Dinosaur…

126
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,974
He left Baby Dinosaur
at a big castle and left.

127
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,436
So Baby Dinosaur was so bored.

128
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,520
The end.

129
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,482
WHERE DID YOU GO, DINOSAUR?

130
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,651
Once upon a time,
there lived Baby Dinosaur.

131
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,987
One day, he was very angry
because he was so lonely.

132
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,531
And other dinosaurs
kept telling him to eat,

133
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,325
so he was very frustrated.

134
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,036
Long ago, there lived Baby Dinosaur.

135
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,871
Papa Dinosaur was busy every day

136
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:51,708
and didn't come home early as he promised,
so Baby Dinosaur was sad.

137
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,504
The end.

138
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,261
A long time ago,
there lived Baby Dinosaur.

139
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,639
Baby Dinosaur missed Mama Dinosaur.

140
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,558
But she was too far away,

141
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:12,771
and he couldn't call her often,
so he was very sad.

142
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,315
WHERE DID YOU GO, DINOSAUR?

143
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,367
Hello.

144
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,002
-Detective Choi.
-My gosh.

145
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,590
Why are you hiding that?

146
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,387
The higher-ups are pressuring us
to close the case quickly.

147
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,931
Mr. Ko isn't here yet.

148
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,059
We talked on the phone.
You didn't eat yet, right?

149
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:58,025
Gosh. Their croffles are also great.
You should have gotten them, too.

150
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,158
DATE OF INCIDENT: MARCH 13, 2003
VICTIM: KIM MYEONG-JA

151
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,909
SUSPECT: CHOI JEONG-MIN

152
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,787
I heard you ran into Chase
at the crime scene.

153
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,835
Choi Seong-jun
of Violent Crimes Team Three.

154
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,464
Mr. Ko isn't here right now.

155
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,425
Ian Chase?

GENERAL CIVIL AFFAIRS OFFICE

157
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,151
Hello. We meet again.

158
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,576
You said you weren't a cop yesterday.

159
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,954
I'm their consultant.

160
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:58,168
PSYCHIATRIST JU YOUNG-DO

161
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,544
You're a doctor.

162
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,507
Dr. Ju Young-do.

163
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,724
Nice to meet you, Dr. Chase.

164
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,311
If I may,

165
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:20,190
can I ask about your relationship
with Choi Jeong-min?

166
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:24,027
Of course. I'm here to tell them about it.

167
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,949
By the way, you seem interested
in this case as much as I am.

168
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:30,992
Very.

169
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,787
I was at the scene that night.

170
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:36,748
Gosh.

171
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,253
I'm glad you came.

172
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,257
You showed up unannounced, though.

173
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,467
Thank you anyway.

174
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,136
Let's go in.

175
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,982
I'm his attorney, Noh Hyeon-ju.

176
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,066
I see.

177
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,402
I'm Dr. Chase's personal attorney.

178
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,281
Actually, I went to see you
because I had a few questions.

179
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,867
You should ask me first from now on.

180
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,036
Right. I'll do that.

181
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,330
You're his attorney.

182
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,041
I needed time to sort out my thoughts.

183
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,338
I was too confused to meet you right away.

184
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:31,845
Well, did you sort out your thoughts then?

185
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,561
I got curious as to what happened.

186
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:44,482
I want to know what happened
while I was away,

187
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,776
why he did those things,

188
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,448
or if it's really true.

189
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,037
THE US MEDICAL TEAM FLIES IN DISCREETLY

SUSPECT: CHOI JEONG-MIN

191
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,962
How about some air on the rooftop?
Shall we?

192
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,547
Is that what you mean?

193
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:08,882
Are you a cop?

194
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,929
Thank you for coming. You can go now.

195
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,597
-We'll be in touch.
-Okay.

196
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,247
They are twins, right?

197
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,582
Isn't that obvious? Look at his face.

198
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,875
Why did he come?

199
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,335
To look at the case file.

200
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,711
Is that even allowed?

201
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,756
Of course not.
Legally, they aren't family.

202
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,591
Was he in touch with Choi Jeong-min?

203
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,843
Did you check his travel records?

204
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,762
He brought his lawyer with him.

205
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:58,014
He just came to say
whatever he wanted to say.

206
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:02,435
We don't have any right to question him.
And he's not obligated to comply.

207
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,729
His lawyer will call you.

208
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,523
She wants to ask about his funeral.

209
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,693
I guess he'll even hold a funeral.

210
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,696
So a murderer is still family. Is that it?

211

SUSPECT: CHOI JEONG-MIN

212
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,919
Yes. I'm in the lobby.

213
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,505
Unlock the door.
I'll get in the car right away.

214
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,218
Okay. I'm coming out now.

215
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,438
Let's hurry.

216
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,440
Come on.

217
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:58,533
What? Where's she going?

218
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,167
What are you doing?

219
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:10,337
Why are you driving someone else's car?

220
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,924
What are you looking at?

221
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:16,760
You crazy…

222
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,246
Hey.

223
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:47,916
What?

224
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:08,019
Can you not laugh at me?
I know that was very stupid of me.

225
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,162
I love you.

226
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,632
What did you say?

227
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,056
Who was that in the car just now?

228
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,683
I don't know her.

229
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,019
I think she got into the wrong car.

230
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,522
There are so many weird people
at this hotel.

231
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:59,112
Right. I need to tell you something
before Dr. Bale gets here.

232
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:01,656
Ms. Ma Jeong-a wants
to see you in private.

233
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,575
Just you, alone.

234
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,411
-And you don't know what this is about?
-No.

235
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,459
Ms. Kang!

236
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:34,731
But you can't take flowers from the hotel
as you please.

237
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,442
Can you tell me where you got these from?

238
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,634
Thank you.

239
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,492
COLOR-SHAPE PSYCHOLOGICAL TEST

240
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,869
So there's nothing
between you and Ms. Kang?

241
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:30,954
No.

242
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:35,166
Then, why don't you join me
on this TV show?

243
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,211
Am I the only friend you have?

244
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,255
What? No, I have a lot of friends.

245
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,131
But you're the most successful one.

246
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,925
I'm not that successful.

247
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,928
Isn't it sad that you're
the most successful friend I have?

248
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,346
So help me out.

249
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,975
Help me out. Please.

250
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,687
If you don't say yes,
I'll crash at your place.

251
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,065
Help me out. Help me.

252
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,067
-Help me.
-Goodness…

253
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,862
What is it? Is it a medical show?

254
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,072
No.

255
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,616
It's a dating reality show.

256
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,078
You must have gone mad.

257
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,750
Come on, help me out.

258
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:18,877
Come here.

259
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,712
-Hello, Ms. Kang.
-Hi.

260
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,630
Are you interested in dating--

261
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,756
What?

262
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,925
Sorry. I'll go and kick him out.
Go upstairs.

263
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:26,885
Dating--

264
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,636
-With Young-do…
-Come here.

265
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,225
Goodness. Hey.

266
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,935
-The dating show…
-Fine. Come here.

267
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,937
-Will you do it or not?
-Come here.

268
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,356
-Will you?
-Hey, you got a package.

269
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,108
Why are you dumping him on me?

270
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,818
Hey, take him back.

271
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,866
It's a dating reality show. Want to do it?

272
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,371
Casting noncelebrities is a huge risk,

273
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,458
so we tend to ask our friends first.

274
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,919
Most importantly, your past is spotless.

275
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,881
Of course, you're not good-looking enough
to be on the show.

276
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,382
Get out.

277
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,802
I'll make people think
you're some handsome vet.

278
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:10,887
Get out.

279
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,600
Gosh. If you get a nice episode
in the beginning, you have a shot.

280
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:18,061
-I told you to get out.
-Hey, Ha-neul.

281
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,520
Come here.

282
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:22,482
Don't give up.

283
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:26,152
Let's show the world that
even ugly people like you can date women.

284
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,742
Hey!

285
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,997
Gosh. That didn't work out.

286
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,376
It's so hard to cast people.

287
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,670
It really is.

288
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,005
Miss.

289
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,841
Come on. Get up already.

290
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:53,137
Can you just pretend
that a corpse is lying here?

291
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,305
Look.

292
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,351
This is a gym. Not a funeral hall.

293
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:01,688
If you aren't going to work out, go home.
Why are you here?

294
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:05,108
Because if I don't come,
you growl at me like that.

295
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,651
You might even bite me.

296
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:09,529
I bet you'll chew my head off first.

297
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,739
Whatever. Don't talk to me.

298
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,039
Yes?

299
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,462
Who? Mr. Ju Young-do's friend?

300
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,299
Ju Young-do?

301
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,343
A producer at TVC?

302
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:36,180
It's that lunatic
who drove the wedding car.

303
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:37,765
I see.

304
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,768
Didn't I hit you that day?

305
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,271
Right. You did hit me that day.

306
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,816
You remember me. Great.
Have you been well?

307
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:49,277
-Yes.
-I'm glad you've been well.

308
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,864
Well, I just wanted to ask you something.
You're not married, right?

309
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,700
-What?
-I can see that you're not.

310
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:58,161
I'm producing a dating reality show.

311
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,579
Not interested.

312
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,249
-What was that?
-Was he trying to sell you something?

313
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,084
He wants me to date.

314
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,711
Date?

315
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:15,762
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable. Please leave a message…

316
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,308
Why…

317
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:24,687
Even I found out.
Do you think the reporters won't?

318
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,272
If you want to date girls,

319
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,067
go to clubs like the others.

320
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,027
We can buy our way out of that.

321
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,446
But Ahn Ga-yeong?

322
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,281
Wouldn't you want to run that story?

323
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,658
If she ends up causing a scandal,

324
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:41,496
you'll be trashed
and ruined along with her.

325
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,335
Trashed? Why?

326
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,088
-Being with her will do that.
-I'm not talking about me.

327
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,009
What did Ga-yeong do wrong?

328
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,261
Don't you think
your fans will be disappointed?

329
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,264
She's single. It's not an affair.
And I've never deceived them.

330
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,102
I've always given my all
to my performances and practiced hard.

331
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:07,647
Even if I only slept for two hours,
I never looked tired around my fans.

332
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,024
That's not going to fix this.
If they find out

333
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,443
-you're dating her, they'll all leave you.
-So?

334
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,780
I should drink with girls at bars
for my fans?

335
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,573
Don't…

336
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,827
-use my fans as leverage like this.
-Then…

337
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:22,745
date an idol star instead.

338
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,539
It's not like choosing a title track.

339
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,999
I can't force myself to love someone

340
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,169
just to make other people happy.

341
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,921
If you play it like this,

342
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,507
I'll have to find my own way to fix this.

343
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,516
I love you.

344
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,809
I mean it.

345
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,770
I really love you.

346
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,665
MISSED CALL

347
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,379
Are you busy?

348
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,218
Did something happen?

349
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,431
Are you okay? Why can't I reach you?

350
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,976
Are you upset? Did I do something wrong?

351
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,604
Text me back when you read this.

352
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,109
Hello.

353
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,487
Damn it. Why them again?

354
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,202
Why? They're still our customers.

355
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,329
Hello.

356
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,001
Two Americanos. One iced, one hot.

357
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:52,919
Okay.

358
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,338
I think I might gain weight if I eat cake.

359
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,757
Tinker Bell is a fairy,
so she can never get fat.

360
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,592
Tinker Bell can't fly if she gets fat.

361
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,802
Then I'll put her in my pocket.

362
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,897
Hello, Ms. Fairy. Come into my pocket.

363
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,065
Come on.

364
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,817
I want to go in there.

365
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,861
I'll hit them. I really will.

366
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,154
No. They'll be done soon.

367
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,490
-How long will they take to order?
-Let them be.

368
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,533
I guess they're hungry.

369
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,119
She ate half of her tongue.

370
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,746
Why the heck is she hungry?

371
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,207
Let them be.
They must love each other so much.

372
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,251
We'll order now.

373
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,253
Sure. Are you ready now? At last.

374
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,629
Are you guys a couple too?

375
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,091
Hey, you. Don't you think
that was too harsh? Why would I--

376
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,345
We're twins. We're siblings.

377
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,180
Sorry. Move.

378
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,473
What would you like?

379
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,107
-You're back.
-This was out front.

380
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,860
-Is the pizza ready?
-Yes.

381
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,113
Hello.

382
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,584
He should have at least said hello.

383
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,593
What did Mom send?

384
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,637
PARK CHEOL-DO
HALF-DRIED SQUID

385
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,223
Cheol-do.

386
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:33,811
Thank you.

387
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,857
-Eun-ha.
-There's one for me too?

388
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,816
Yes.

389
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:40,693
Gosh.

390
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,490
And this one is for Mr. Ju.

391
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,160
YOUNG-DO!

392
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,412
What is this?

393
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,623
I got a present,
but it feels like I've been left out.

394
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,478
Thanks for the art therapy session.

395
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,146
Thanks to you, the kid and I…

396
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:33,412
I was sending you a message
to thank you for the therapy session.

397
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:38,042
My mom sent you the squid
as you can see here.

398
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,004
She didn't have to.

399
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,631
Well…

400
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,217
I'll go…

401
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,317
Since livestreaming
our radio show last week,

402
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,445
we've been getting
tons of questions for you, Dr. Ju.

403
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,739
I think you're more popular than me.

404
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:09,824
Gosh.

405
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,534
No. You're too kind.

406
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:14,703
One of our listeners said
that you would make a great couple

407
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,872
with our producer, Han A-reum.

408
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,042
Thank you.

409
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,672
Ms. Han, I think you're blushing.

410
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,757
Your face is really red.

411
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,676
Damn it.

412
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,095
I knew it.

413
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,557
That flirt. Everyone just falls for him.

414
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,893
Wait. Hold on.

415
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,234
-Can we start our meeting?
-What?

416
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,779
I talked to someone from K Men.
Patrick can't join our show,

417
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,323
but other members like Yun-jo
and Si-hyeong can.

418
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,033
Well, without Patrick…

419
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,328
I need to go to the fifth floor right now.

420
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,622
Give me ten minutes. Just ten minutes.

421
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,000
Once again, we had a very nice talk

422
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,752
with our healing mentor, Dr. Ju.

423
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,464
Dr. Ju, is there a song
you would like to listen to?

424
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,386
I'm not sure. I don't listen to
a lot of recent songs.

425
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,680
What could we listen to?

426
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,641
Then…

427
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,644
Then, I will…

428
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,285
I choose "The Butterflies Flew."

429
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,746
I'd like to pick that song.

430
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,956
Gosh. That's a great song.

431
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,376
We'll play that later.

432
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,254
We'll say goodbye to Mr. Ju now.

433
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,632
But I'll be back after the commercials.

434
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,638
-Good work.
-Good work.

435
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,983
We're going to play the song
Mr. Ju requested.

436
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:11,237
And Lee Bit-na, Yang Su-ji,

437
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,741
and Jin Ui-ryang
also requested the same song.

438
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:19,537
Wait. Someone is trying to relay
a message to me from outside the booth.

439
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:23,374
"To the sweet lady

440
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:29,421
I went to Gangneung with.
I send you this song."

441
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,258
There's a heart, too. "From Ju Young-do."

442
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:36,053
Gosh. I knew it.

443
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:38,138
I knew he chose the song for a reason.

444
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:41,183
All right. I'll play the song now.

445
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,396
EUN GI-JUN'S BLACK RADIO

446
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:46,855
I'm going to kill you today.

447
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,066
Gosh.
So why did you have to flirt with her?

448
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,776
I'll ask them to edit this out.

449
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:52,570
That was live.

450
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,905
Hey, don't run. I won't run.

451
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,949
Right. Your heart! Don't overwork it.

452
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:59,410
Gosh. Don't run.
Don't overwork your heart.

453
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,370
Think about your heart. Sorry. Wait.

454
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,334
I'm sorry.

455
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,006
I'm sorry.

456
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,278
MUN MI-RAN INVITED YOU AND KANG DA-JEONG
MUN MI-RAN: HEHEHEHE

457
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:38,574
No. Don't read it.

458
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:39,950
MUN MI-RAN: HEHEHEHE

459
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,910
Don't read it. Please don't.

460
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,069
Yes. The same as usual.

461
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,029
The hotel, cafe, hospital, and bookstore.

462
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,406
He's at a cafe to have coffee again.

463
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,118
Okay. I'll call you again.

464
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,534
2003 KIM MYEONG-JA
UNSOLVED MURDER CASE

465
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,661
UNSOLVED

466
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,997
DATE: MAY 13, 2003
LOCATION: PUNGJI 4-DONG

467
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:38,420
Hello.

468
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:41,965
Are you Ms. Kim Myeong-ja's husband?

469
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:43,717
Yes.

470
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,802
Nice to meet you. Please sit.

471
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,683
I don't remember much anyway.

472
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,228
That young detective…

473
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,438
His name is Lee Jeong-beom.

474
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:59,900
Detective Lee Jeong-beom asked me

475
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:03,237
mostly about my wife's church,
prayer house,

476
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,948
-and stuff like that.
-The prayer house?

477
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,241
Well, a fake one.

478
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:12,287
By any chance, was that around 1994?

479
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:15,958
Yes, it was around then.

480
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:18,585
That's when my oldest child
started elementary school.

481
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:24,466
-Okay.
-Okay.

482
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,521
You have cool undertones.

483
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:21,481
You look great in pink.

484
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:23,483
It's for your mother.

485
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,194
In return for the squid.

486
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:28,947
No way.

487
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:35,621
You're carrying bags.
Let me carry this to your house.

488
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,208
Give them to me. I'll carry them.

489
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:44,254
They're not heavy.
Even if they were, I can carry them.

490
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:46,465
-Let me.
-They're mine.

491
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:50,135
Then give me just one.

492
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:51,219
No.

493
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:53,513
Just let me carry one.

494
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,228
Having a barbecue on the rooftop?

495
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,939
That's for camping.

496
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:07,069
I see. So you actually use
the camping equipment.

497
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:11,365
But do you think you can handle it?

498
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:13,992
This isn't heavy.

499
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,453
No. That.

500
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,164
If you give it to my mom,

501
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:25,879
she might send an entire boatload
of squid from Gangneung to your house.

502
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,425
I should move to a bigger house then.

503
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:38,016
Right. So did you eat ramyeon that day?

504
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:43,313
By that day, do you mean the day
you treated me like a pervert

505
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,733
and left me on the street in the morning

506
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,319
just because I suggested
having ramyeon together?

507
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,405
A pervert? Gosh, no way.

508
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:54,032
I just said you were a flirt.

509
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,827
I'm never going to live that down, am I?

510
00:49:58,203 --> 00:50:00,455
You think it only pertains to this life?

511
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:03,417
There's the afterworld and your next life.

512
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,710
I didn't eat it.

513
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,922
Feel like having ramyeon?

514
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:15,095
This is why you're a flirt.

515
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,849
I used another expression.

516
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,601
"Feel like having ramyeon?"

517
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:24,771
I see.

518
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:29,443
This is exactly why you're a flirt.

519
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,164
It's not drizzling, right?

520
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:44,082
No. But I think it might soon.

521
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,752
Why didn't you have dinner?

522
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:49,921
I thought about ordering something in,

523
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:53,341
but they don't deliver
one serving of food.

524
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:56,762
Some of them do,
but they charge 6,500 won for delivery.

525
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,513
So I couldn't make up my mind.

526
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,309
I mean, if they're going to
charge me that much,

527
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:03,643
shouldn't they take me

528
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,730
for a ride in Pungji-dong
instead of the food?

529
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:10,025
Why didn't you ask them
if they could give you a ride?

530
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:11,777
They probably will.

531
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,166
I listened to the radio show.

532
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,174
You must frequent Gangneung.

533
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:35,592
Me?

534
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,428
You said you went there with a sweet lady.

535
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:42,349
Obviously, I'm not the sweet type.
You must've gone there with another girl.

536
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:46,186
Let me explain.

537
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:49,523
I picked the song and left the booth.

538
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,149
Seung-won did that after I left.

539
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:56,404
Oh.

540
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:02,244
God, that bastard…
I swear I'm going to get him one day.

541
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:04,663
Why? It was nice.

542
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:12,963
It feels good to listen to
the song you like on the radio, you know.

543
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,093
You're right.

544
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:33,191
At my school,
there was this crazy magnolia.

545
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:36,736
There was Crazy Dog at my school.
Was that your Korean teacher?

546
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,823
No, it was a real plant.

547
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,203
It bloomed earlier than other flowers

548
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:48,498
and was in full bloom
even during snowy winter days.

549
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,003
There's nothing wrong with blooming early.

550
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:56,464
If you call it crazy,
you're hurting the flower's feelings.

551
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:00,343
What's funny is, it all made sense.
It was in front of our school.

552
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,971
The pipe steamed when the heating was on.

553
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:05,223
"What? It's warm.

554
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:07,642
It's spring. Time to bloom."

555
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,770
They shouldn't have kept it warm

556
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:13,189
or moist, then.

557
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:16,234
They were the ones who did all that
to confuse the flower.

558
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,613
Why did they tease the flower
for blooming? Isn't that too mean?

559
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:20,530
Right?

560
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:23,158
Does it have to bloom at the same pace
as the others?

561
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:26,202
It can feel tingly and excited.
It's understandable. Right?

562
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,079
-Of course.
-Right.

563
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,719
There's also a crazy mosquito.

564
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,931
It flies around even until Christmas.

565
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:50,685
There's crazy snow in Gangwon Province.
It even snows in April.

566
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,354
Right. That happened before.

567
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:56,733
We wanted to see it from up high,
so we three guys rode the Ferris wheel…

568
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:57,901
No way.

569
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:00,528
Why did I bring that up?

570
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,326
You know what?

571
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:10,330
I think that's what snow is about.

572
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,999
It excuses our crazy behaviors.

573
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,628
Right.

574
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,065
Mr. Hong left shoes for me.

575
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,317
He left sneakers for you?

576
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:40,986
Shoes.

577
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,113
Right. Sneakers.

578
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:44,990
Shoes.

579
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:48,118
What kind of shoes?

580
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,286
Dress shoes, sneakers, or rubber shoes?

581
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,330
Shoes you can wear comfortably.

582
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:57,043
-Flip-flops?
-Yes. Shoes.

583
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:02,048
Mom. You like them, don't you?

584
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:12,142
Why didn't you and Young-do say anything
in our group chat room?

585
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,894
You made my text
look sad and embarrassing.

586
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,570
Should I not do that to him?

587
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,740
Acting like we're friends,
trying to become friends with him,

588
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,366
or thinking that we already are.

589
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,743
Should I stop doing that?

590
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:37,292
It feels like I'm talking to myself.

591
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:40,003
Sorry. I'm listening.

592
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,839
If you don't have feelings for him,
that's it.

593
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:45,884
Dating isn't musical chairs.

594
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:47,886
You don't have to sit next to someone

595
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:50,597
just because the music stopped
and someone blew a whistle.

596
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,518
-Mom.
-Go ahead.

597
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,187
What should I do?

598
00:55:57,937 --> 00:55:59,773
Should I take back the squid from him?

599
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:04,778
I don't know.

600
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,947
How you feel or how he feels?

601
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:11,076
Both.

602
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,244
I don't know…

603
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:18,333
and I don't think I should know
the answers to both.

604
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:20,835
Then…

605
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,548
LOUDMOUTH: PARK CHEOL-DO
TANGERINES

606
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:27,717
How's work?

607
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,220
I like working here.

608
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:31,596
TANGERINES, RICE CAKE, HONEY, SHOES

609
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:32,889
It's fun.

610
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,934
Though I'm a bit concerned
about switching departments.

611
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:39,229
Isn't the PR Team good, too?

612
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:43,316
But I won't be able to interact
with our customers.

613
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:47,821
"Hello. Goodbye."

614
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,739
Why do I like greeting people?

615
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,326
You've always been like that.

616
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:56,955
When Tae-jeong had an appendectomy,
you said hi and goodbye

617
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:59,457
whenever you saw doctors and nurses.

618
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:03,336
Everyone laughed when they shouldn't
because of their stitches.

619
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,342
How do you remember all that?

620
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:10,802
-Isn't that odd?
-Yes.

621
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:13,638
I don't remember
where I put my scooter key

622
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:15,890
even if my life depended on it.

623
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:19,769
But I can still draw and write
about what happened 30 years ago.

624
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:26,025
"Tae-jeong finally farted today."

625
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,026
Kang Tae-jeong.

626
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,487
You can hold in your fart, right?

627
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:30,447
What?

628
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:33,199
Didn't you hear
what the nurse said earlier?

629
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,995
If you fart, we'll go home.

630
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:40,206
Do you want to go home?

631
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,168
Dad will be angry.

632
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:45,753
No. I don't want to.

633
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:54,095
Da-jeong, aren't you hungry?

634
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,391
Go eat bread and milk.

635
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:00,226
What about me?

636
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,686
You didn't fart yet.

637
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,730
I want to eat it too.

638
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,571
-Gosh. Poor kid.
-He was so young.

639
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:14,782
How will she live after losing Young-jae?

640
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,285
-Poor thing. I feel awful.
-This is so sad.

641
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,455
Poor thing.

642
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:21,581
Mom.

643
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:04,684
MYEONGIN HOSPITAL

644
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:07,812
You're going home now.

645
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:09,897
Good for you.

646
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:13,901
Have this, kids.

647
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,196
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

648
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,824
Go home and listen to your mom.

649
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:41,763
Da-jeong, come on.

650
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:43,348
Okay.

651
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:17,840
Young-do.

652
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:20,760
Let's go.

653
01:01:58,214 --> 01:01:59,382
YOUR PURCHASE IS COMPLETE

654
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:08,433
And my speaker.

655
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:11,436
Where is it?

656
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:15,314
Where's my speaker? My speaker.

657
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,024
What?

658
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:21,154
Where did I put my speaker?

659
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,198
My speaker…

660
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:40,631
No way.

661
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:46,679
There's something
Dr. Ju forgot to say earlier.

662
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:50,141
"To the sweet lady

663
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:53,227
I went to Gangneung with.

664
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:56,355
I send you this song."

665
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,733
There's a heart, too. "From Ju Young-do."

666
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:01,486
Gosh. I knew it.

667
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:03,613
I knew he chose the song for a reason.

668
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:07,450
Ms. Han, don't tell me
you're disappointed.

669
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,778
MOM: HEHEHEHE

670
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:45,071
MOM INVITED YOU AND JU YOUNG-DO

671
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:24,652
Oh, dear.

672
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:48,050
No way.

673
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:15,202
Right?

674
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:18,080
Does it have to bloom at the same pace
as the others?

675
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:22,251
It can feel tingly and excited.
It's understandable. Right?

676
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:23,878
-Of course.
-Right.

677
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:39,852
You know what?

678
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:44,065
I think that's what snow is about.

679
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:46,734
It excuses our crazy behaviors.

680
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:25,690
That night…

681
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:28,734
in late spring.

682
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:32,947
The night crazy spring snow fell.

683
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:36,742
With the crazy weather as an excuse,

684
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:40,746
some spread their wounded wings again.

685
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:43,749
And some

686
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:47,837
fluttered their wings that had been folded
for a very long time.

687
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,215
And the butterflies…

688
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:53,592
flew.

689
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:42,433
Young-do.

690
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:45,019
Are you still a big flirt?

691
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:49,523
Hello, wild rabbit

692
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:52,109
I really want to show you

693
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:54,195
that I can still do crazy things
at my age.

694
01:07:54,278 --> 01:07:56,280
Fine. Take it.

695
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:57,573
Don't leave me.

696
01:07:57,656 --> 01:07:59,909
It can't be a coincidence
that a man who looks just like

697
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:01,410
Choi Jeong-min showed up now.

698
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:05,039
You're at the end of the trail
I followed, Ms. Kang.

699
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:07,708
I can't get in touch with Dr. Chase.

700
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:10,377
Was he planning to hurt you, too?

701
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:15,007
