1
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,461
Gosh… Hey.

2
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:27,629
EPISODE 11

3
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:31,466
How am I supposed to understand
a camera drone flying outside my window?

4
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,675
I'm so sorry.

5
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,178
We have looked into the drone

6
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,848
and confirmed that a TV station flew
the drone while filming a drama.

7
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,100
We requested them to halt the shoot. So--

8
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,977
Is that the best you can do?

9
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,104
You should check what's been filmed!

10
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:48,733
Of course, sir.
We will review all of the footage.

11
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,110
-If we come across anything that--
-No.

12
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,322
I want to check it myself.

13
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:55,740
You say you'll check it,

14
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,243
but how can I be sure
you won't keep a video of me?

15
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,870
Tell those TV station jerks
who flew that drone

16
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,580
to call me directly

17
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,499
and bring the original clips…

18
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,334
Yesterday, they smeared the carpet

19
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,337
with ketchup, gochujang, and fake blood.

20
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,589
And they secretly flew a drone today.

21
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:15,385
Despite all this trouble, I still can't
write that the production crew is

22
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,387
-going crazy in my report?
-No, you can't.

23
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,722
How do you deal with a day like today?

24
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,851
We've been getting yelled at all day.
What do you do?

25
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,939
I think about eating something spicy later
and getting my energy up.

26
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,984
Or I think about things
that make me happy.

27
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,194
This is why I should date.

28
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,072
"I'm having such a hard day.
Can't you kiddie me?"

29
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,743
You meant to say "baby" you.
Not "kiddie" you.

30
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,932
-Hey.
-Hey.

31
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,435
Are you busy? Can we talk now?

32
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,145
Okay. Bye.

33
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:08,813
Hey. What was…

34
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,149
Hey, you're just leaving?

35
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,860
You said it was urgent. Young-do.

36
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,739
Yes, Ms. Kang. I'm not busy at all.

37
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,449
Young-do?

38
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,075
Ju Young-do.

39
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,411
No. No one is calling me.

40
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,164
Right. You misheard it.

41
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:30,293
Me? I was bored.

42
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,378
I was hoping to get a phone call.

43
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,214
No. Not at all.

44
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,091
What could be wrong?

45
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,593
I just thought of…

46
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,183
Just because. No reason.

47
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,313
No. I'll get off work late today.

48
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:54,651
And Eun-ha and Ms. Ahn are
coming over to have dinner tonight.

49
00:03:56,694 --> 00:04:00,490
I see. I'll call you later then.

50
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,326
I…

51
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,079
miss…

52
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,997
I…

53
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,833
Okay. Bye.

54
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,011
Gosh.

55
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,184
Did you hear everything?

56
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,146
I'm not sure if I heard anything.

57
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,857
I'm relieved if you didn't hear anything.

58
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,068
"So you won't be able to see me today.

59
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:40,863
Darn. Why do they
always come over to your house?

60
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,450
I wish you and I were living together.

61
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,829
I hope I can see you tomorrow."

62
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,206
But you couldn't say this,
so you ended up saying,

63
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,375
"I… miss…"

64
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,589
Please don't tell anyone.

65
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,883
It's not an affair or a crime.

66
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,136
Right. That's true, but…

67
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:06,472
If anything goes south,
are you going to back out right away?

68
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,765
No. That's not it.

69
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:08,683
"Oh, dear."

70
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:20,903
I want to be considerate of Ms. Kang.
I want to be careful.

71
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,577
This way.

72
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,914
Right. You're busy, right?
Please get back to work.

73
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,518
FORENSIC INVESTIGATION

74
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,819
Yes. I'm at the scene.

75
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,164
Your lawyer isn't here yet.

76
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,874
Are you sure you want to start now?

77
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,626
Yes.

78
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,506
As soon as you came to the station,
you requested a drug test.

79
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,799
Why did you do that?

80
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,760
I needed to get tested
before the drug went out of my system.

81
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,262
How were you so sure you'd been drugged?

82
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,349
After I came home,
the liquor was the only thing I drank.

83
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,060
But it had no distinct smell or color,

84
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,270
and it took me three hours to wake up.

85
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,066
So I deduced that it must be GHB.

86
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:47,698
Someone entered your house
and spiked your liquor with some drug?

87
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,910
What makes you think so?

88
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,247
Once you eliminate the wrong answer,

89
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,499
that's the only possible answer left.

90
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,294
That Ian Chase killed Noh Hyeon-ju.

91
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,422
So that's the wrong answer, right?

92
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,508
Yes.

93
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,386
That's not what happened.

94
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,933
Today at 1:40 a.m.,

95
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:17,645
you and Ms. Noh Hyeon-ju went

96
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,856
into your place.

97
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,399
Is that correct?

98
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,316
Yes.

99
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,777
Just do what you've been doing.

100
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,737
That's all you need to do.

101
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:09,071
They do it because they think
by crossing the line just this once,

102
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,824
they'll be able to live

103
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,161
normal and stable lives
like everyone else.

104
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,134
A shadow…

105
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,679
shouldn't covet the light.

106
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,682
Because it'll vanish.

107
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,234
VIOLENT CRIMES TEAM 3
KO JIN-BOK

108
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,587
Detective Ko Jin-bok.

109
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,342
A woman has died.

110
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,805
How did you get that wound on your hand?

111
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,977
This has nothing to do with this incident.

112
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,728
Could someone confirm that?

113
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,938
Yes.

114
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:25,940
Give me a name.

115
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:35,241
Everyone in the hotel lobby that day
saw how I got this wound.

116
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:39,453
Detective Park. Go to this hotel
and see if his story checks out.

117
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,540
Get the footage
that captured how he hurt his hand too.

118
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,503
The woman who brought Choi Jeong-min's
suicide note works at this hotel.

119
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,506
Right.

120
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,009
Ms. Kang works there.

121
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,928
I have her number.
I'll ask her for the footage in advance.

122
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,347
No, don't call her.
Go ask someone else there.

123
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,057
Why?

124
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,144
Our job is catching criminals.

125
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,604
But we also meet people

126
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,648
who go through horrible things
because of those criminals.

127
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,734
And she already went through it once.

128
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,361
Pretty recently because of
a guy who looks just like him.

129
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,822
Right.

130
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,658
Unless we need her statement
to confirm more things,

131
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,286
let's ask someone else
to check out his statement.

132
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,287
Okay.

133
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,041
So you witnessed
the incident yourself. Correct?

134
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,501
Yes. But what is this about?

135
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:31,881
Do you have any record that I can use
to confirm the story?

136
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,635
We have the daily log and the security
camera footage from the lobby.

137
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,429
But I must know why you need them first.

138
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:42,642
Well, we're investigating a homicide,
and that's all I can tell you.

139
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,809
A homicide?

140
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:47,021
Are you telling me someone is dead?

141
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,106
Yes.

142
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,431
Detective Ko, we found a camera
at the crime scene.

143
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,017
It transmits video feeds
without a memory card.

144
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,520
Are you talking about a spy cam?

145
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,105
Where was it facing?

146
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,109
Do you have to ask?

147
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,278
Ask the server company to cooperate.
If not, we'll get a warrant.

148
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,571
Are you done at the scene?

149
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,158
Yes. Wrap up and come back.
I'll wrap up and head back too.

150
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,035
You're saying

151
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,622
Ms. Noh never drank this liquor. Correct?

152
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,082
Yes.

153
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:53,963
Then if the drink was spiked,
the culprit was after you.

154
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,842
But you were unconscious
for 3 hours from 2:28 a.m.

155
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,886
That gives plenty of time
for the culprit to kill you.

156
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,348
But the culprit killed
Ms. Noh who wasn't the target

157
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,808
and left the scene?

158
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,148
How often did Ms. Noh visit your studio?

159
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,483
Almost every day.

160
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,110
Even the day before the incident?

161
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,820
-Yes.
-Why?

162
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,031
I asked her to get something for me,
so she brought it.

163
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,992
What did you ask her to get for you?

164
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,076
A dissertation.

165
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,536
A dissertation?

166
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,415
What is the title?

167
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,712
Trauma That Leads to Sadism.
That's the title.

168
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:42,052
I also brought copies
of two of Ju Young-do's dissertations.

169
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,146
TRAUMA THAT LEADS TO SADISM
BY JU YOUNG-DO

170
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,651
People who resort to violence
because they were consumed by rage

171
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,612
or intoxicated with alcohol

172
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,907
realize once their rage
or the alcohol wears off

173
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:10,831
that the person they wanted to hurt
was themselves.

174
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,001
It could be them
in the present circumstances.

175
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:17,296
Or it could be their old selves
who made mistakes.

176
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:22,051
Uncontrollable aggression
is an expression of self-contempt.

177
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,639
Why do we pay attention
to how criminals feel?

178
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,558
Why do we leave room for understanding?

179
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:34,730
To answer those questions,
I must start with the following.

180
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:39,610
Because they are bound
to be someone's neighbor,

181
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,905
we cannot give up on correcting
and reforming their behaviors,

182
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,782
and forgiving them in order to coexist.

183
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:49,078
We must find the moment that the darkest
and weakest beings of society,

184
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:53,165
who never received the slightest help,

185
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,585
turn into criminals.

186
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:01,465
They do it because they think
by crossing the line just this once,

187
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,801
they'll be able to live

188
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,555
normal and stable lives
like everyone else.

189
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,934
Therefore, we must help them

190
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:17,064
stay away from the water plant
that keeps dragging them down

191
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:20,067
no matter how hard they try to escape.

192
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:29,159
Is there any reason that you moved
into Choi Jeong-min's old studio?

193
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,209
Mr. Chase.

194
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,510
Why did you move into that studio?

195
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,515
I would like…

196
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,686
to talk to Mr. Ju Young-do.

197
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,990
Can I ask you something?

198
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:08,908
Sure.

199
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,203
You're not exclusive
with Dr. Chase, right?

200
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,916
You're just casually seeing him, right?
It's nothing serious. Right?

201
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,712
I'm not dating him.
What made you think so?

202
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:25,299
I saw you getting into his car,
and you bought men's clothes that day.

203
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,052
When you got text messages,
your eyes gleamed with love.

204
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,722
It wasn't a date.
And the shirt wasn't for him.

205
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,308
-Really?
-Yes.

206
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,522
By the way,

207
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,651
do you feel okay

208
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,028
around him?

209
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,616
If you're really not dating him,
can I give you my honest answer?

210
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,617
Sure.

211
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,286
He scares me.

212
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,580
He grabbed the knife with his hand.

213
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,750
And he's got this dark aura around him.

214
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:03,128
So I wondered why you were dating him.

215
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,465
I just thought that there was
a side of him I hadn't seen yet.

216
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,261
I haven't seen that side either.

217
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,556
I didn't want to feel this way.

218
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,060
But I'm scared of him too now.

219
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,562
So you're really not dating him, right?

220
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,189
No.

221
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,983
Then what was that look I saw before?

222
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:30,656
Well, there's someone I like.
It was for him.

223
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,033
Are you sure it's not Dr. Chase?

224
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,077
Yes, I am.

225
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,830
What's this about?

226
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:40,582
Nothing.

227
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,005
If there is anything, you have to tell me.

228
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,424
You're on my team,
so you're my responsibility.

229
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:53,804
Helping you with problems you face at work
is also part of my job.

230
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,432
Seriously. You're Kang Sweet.

231
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,392
Gosh. No. Not this.

232
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,896
By the way, who's the guy you like?

233
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,899
-He's a good person.
-Is he handsome?

234
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,359
-Yes.
-Do you have his photo?

235
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,736
-No.
-What about a video?

236
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,161
See? You were the only one
who didn't put a finger down.

237
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,580
So what?
You were lying when you put yours down.

238
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,832
I did kiss someone.

239
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,792
My finger told the truth.

240
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,836
Just believe me.
I'll bet his life savings.

241
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,714
Who said you could do that?
Did you really kiss someone?

242
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,050
When, where, why, with whom, and how?

243
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,802
A gentleman doesn't kiss and tell.

244
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,262
Gosh.

245
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:39,016
I'm not interested in your personal life,
but I must get to the bottom of this.

246
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,310
So this thing you did,

247
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,271
it wasn't illegal or unethical, right?

248
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,357
Of course not.

249
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,402
What in the world?

250
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:54,073
There really is a man who has never
been kissed in 38 years of his life?

251
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,657
Is this true?

252
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,954
Just eat.

253
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,706
Yes, Detective Ko.

254
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,210
Tomorrow night?

255
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,462
Yes. I'll go to the station.

256
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,756
But what's this about?

257
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,716
No.

258
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,760
And Eun-ha said that she was single too.

259
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,678
-Five,
-She put it down

260
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,722
-four, three…
-like she meant it.

261
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,475
Hey, she told me that herself.

262
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,726
Rewind and check.

263
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,771
I'll move onto the next question.

264
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:26,897
VAR check.

265
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,616
This is mine, right?

266
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,912
Yes.

267
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,503
By the way, I heard earlier
that you were bitten.

268
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:54,800
Well, yes. There was a minor incident.

269
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,095
So you have a boyfriend, right?

270
00:18:58,929 --> 00:18:59,763
No. I don't.

271
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,474
But you put down your finger.

272
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,437
Well, everyone put down their finger, so…

273
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,275
Right? Gosh.
I should have put mine down too.

274
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,860
I did get some action.

275
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,236
But it was just a bite.

276
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,198
-But you don't have a boyfriend.
-That's not the same.

277
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:21,869
Gosh. It's all right.
You know, kisses are nothing.

278
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,204
They aren't such a big deal.

279
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,291
Do you want to hear an interesting story?

280
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,795
The act of kissing originated

281
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:36,133
from this animal behavior
of feeding each other from mouth to mouth.

282
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,343
Like mother birds
putting food in their babies.

283
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,554
You said "interesting."

284
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:44,141
Yes. But fully grown adults like us
are still

285
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:47,936
doing the animal behavior
of putting bugs in someone else's mouth.

286
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,854
Funny, right?

287
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,945
What kind of nonsense is that?

288
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,032
Just because you kiss a guy,
doesn't mean you're dating him.

289
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,328
Listen. That's a declaration
of an exclusive relationship.

290
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,289
-Nothing is clearer than that.
-You kiss the guy you like.

291
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,751
And if you liked the kiss,
you can just leave it at that.

292
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,170
Must you label each other
as significant others?

293
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,087
Of course.

294
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,590
If you don't, you won't be able to say

295
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,800
he's your boyfriend, and vice versa.

296
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,761
Who do you need to say that to?

297
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:25,349
"My dear neighbors.
That hot guy is my boyfriend."

298
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,727
You want to show off the guy you like.

299
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,147
You won't leave a question mark
in your relationship.

300
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,484
The moment you label each other,

301
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:39,863
the relationship starts getting old
because of obligations.

302
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,907
You can't say you're sick of him

303
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,826
and can't break up with him
even if you want to.

304
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,372
And if you hit a rough patch,
you just have these thoughts in your head.

305
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:51,792
"Why the heck do you live?

306
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,669
Why are you smiling?

307
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,129
Why do you have two eyes?"

308
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,094
Who shoved those evil thoughts
into your head?

309
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:07,516
Well, I guess my ex-boyfriend is
probably responsible for them.

310
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,227
Where is he right now?
I'd like to see him.

311
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,645
For what?

312
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:15,232
I will bring a pretty fork
with a pink ribbon

313
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,985
and poke his eyes gently saying,

314
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,612
"What have you done to my friend?"

315
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,282
Why are you so quiet?

316
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,492
So you can see me now?

317
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,203
Join us. Fight with me.

318
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,747
So let me sum up your dilemma.

319
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,791
After eating sweet potatoes,

320
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:36,920
will you drink your last can of Sprite,
or will you choke on them?

321
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:41,216
What do you think?
Will you drink it or choke on them?

322
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,971
I'm not sure. I've never choked
on sweet potatoes.

323
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,640
And when I drink cold Sprite,

324
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,434
I sometimes get hiccups.

325
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,983
Gosh. This is an important call.

326
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,194
It's the hotel.

327
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,196
It's work.

328
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,698
Excuse me.

329
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,910
Yes, sir.

330
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:14,041
I'm moving to somewhere quiet.
Please hold on.

331
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,962
I think she's just a happy sweet potato.

332
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:23,050
Then again, even frustrating ones
can be happy.

333
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,016
She can never be an actress
with that awful acting.

334
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,852
Let's play along. She's trying at least.

335
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,610
They're still with you?

336
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:45,781
Yes. We're done with dinner.
We're just drinking beer together.

337
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:48,325
Shouldn't there be some law?

338
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:52,621
They should be mandated by law
to go home at 8 p.m.

339
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,997
Exactly.

340
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,544
Wait. That means you and I also

341
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,130
have to go home at 8 p.m.

342
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,341
Oh, dear.

343
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:08,303
Wait. I don't own this house.

344
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,430
You own this house.

345
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,225
Yes. That's true.

346
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,935
I'm glad I'm poor.

347
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,521
When do you get off work tomorrow?

348
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:18,605
At my usual time.

349
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,649
-Should we have dinner?
-I'd like that.

350
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,652
How about we go to
my favorite restaurant this time?

351
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:24,653
I'd love that.

352
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,702
HA-NEUL VETERINARY CLINIC

353
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,878
"I knew about my awful drinking habit

354
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:47,050
of biting people
when I hear a particular word.

355
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:53,557
But I was irresponsible and got drunk.
And as a result, I bit you.

356
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:57,811
If I make this kind of mistake again,

357
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,856
then I will be responsible for your life

358
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,152
for the rest of my life."

359
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:32,387
Look who's here.
It's a dear guest on my show.

360
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:34,472
Hi.

361
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,103
Hold on.

362
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,024
I need to ask you something.

363
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,025
Okay.

364
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,235
To be honest with you,

365
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:52,532
I'm interested in the guy up there.

366
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,284
God?

367
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,535
I'm a Buddhist.

368
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,622
No. I mean the guy upstairs.

369
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:00,999
-On the second floor?
-Yes.

370
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:03,293
-Not the third floor, but the second?
-Yes.

371
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:06,213
Ha-neul is on the second floor.
Young-do is on the third floor.

372
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,839
I'm not interested in Mr. Ju.

373
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,551
So you really want to know about Ha-neul.

374
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,347
Gosh. Where should I start?

375
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:24,773
Even if you're not by my side anymore

376
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,737
Let me tell you about Ha-neul.

377
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,032
He might not look like it,
but he's as delicate as a cosmos flower.

378
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,912
That's why
his clinic name means "delicate."

379
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:42,374
My dear Ha-neul will have a knife cut
on his face from time to time.

380
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,918
-A knife cut?
-But don't be scared.

381
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,461
It's from playing with cats.

382
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:48,046
My dear Ha-neul…

383
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:54,594
HA-NEUL VETERINARY CLINIC

384
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,013
-I got that. Let me.
-No.

385
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,848
No. I got it. Just don't block my way.

386
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,934
-No. Let me help you.
-Gosh.

387
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,394
I can handle it.

388
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:06,106
You remind me of an ant.

389
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,190
What?

390
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:10,652
Ants can easily lift
up to 20 times their own body weight.

391
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:14,531
If ants were as big as dogs,
they would be ruling Earth.

392
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,366
Oh, that was a compliment then.

393
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,536
But all ants are black. Aren't they?

394
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,372
No. There are ants in different colors.

395
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,168
But white ants are ugly.

396
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:32,090
Ants called Camponotus nipponensis look
like they are wearing red stripe shirts.

397
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,466
They are kind of pretty.

398
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,636
I see. But their name sounds gross.

399
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,389
Their queen ants have gold stripes.

400
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,683
I see. That's cool.

401
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,435
Cool, right?

402
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,772
I wasn't going to show this to anyone.
But I guess you'll be the first.

403
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,984
I'll use this
to make him appear on my show.

404
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:52,986
Excuse me.

405
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,362
Are you listening?

406
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,115
-Are you there?
-Isn't that heavy?

407
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,451
This is nothing. It's no problem.

408
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,787
-This way, right?
-Yes. Put it inside, please.

409
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:04,831
Hello?

410
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,170
The question you asked me at the hospital…

411
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:15,967
When I was young,

412
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:19,054
I temporarily stayed
at a nursing facility in Changbi-dong.

413
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,223
And recently,
I saw a photo of me taken there.

414
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:26,644
And that photo was a piece of evidence
related to Choi Jeong-min's case.

415
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,566
Do you know anything
about the photo or facility?

416
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,194
Seeing that you asked me that question,

417
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,364
you probably don't remember me.

418
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,240
So you were there.

419
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,408
Yes, I was.

420
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,704
I was there. And so were you.

421
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,957
I'm Ju Young-do. What's your name?

422
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,001
I don't need a stupid name.

423
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,089
Why did you ask to see me?

424
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,840
I had a question for you too.

425
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,720
If you were the one
who got abandoned there…

426
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,390
If you were in my shoes,

427
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,310
would you have been able to say
what you said?

428
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,828
Here. You should have this.

429
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:28,331
People who resort to violence
because they were consumed by rage

430
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,500
or intoxicated with alcohol

431
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,420
realize once their rage
or the alcohol wears off…

432
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,131
-Uncontrollable aggression
-"Uncontrollable aggression

433
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,258
-is an expression of self-contempt.
-is an expression of self-contempt."

434
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,303
"We must find the moment that the darkest
and weakest beings of society,

435
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:49,227
who never received the slightest help,
turn into criminals."

436
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,777
Asking me this question

437
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,948
sounds like you're asking me

438
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,118
if I can understand you.

439
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,247
I thought you disliked me.

440
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,540
Or…

441
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,877
you must be so shocked and desperate

442
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,297
that you hope I can understand you.

443
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,465
I do dislike you.

444
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,052
I always have.

445
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,976
Is the incident from 18 years ago

446
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,189
included in the memories you hate?

447
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:38,860
Yes.

448
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:47,327
To have the right
to talk about helping people now,

449
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,873
you shouldn't have looked at me
through the mirror like that.

450
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,586
And you shouldn't have just left
after seeing me like that.

451
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,631
And you shouldn't have…

452
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,511
accepted that heart.

453
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:10,183
To answer your question from earlier,

454
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,103
even if I were in your shoes,

455
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:17,148
I would have said the same thing

456
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:22,028
because I don't need to blame myself
for failing to help you in the past.

457
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,656
Even if it's you

458
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:28,993
who needs my help, I will help you.

459
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,213
I don't need your help.

460
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,428
Okay, then. I have plans, so…

461
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:49,973
What about Ms. Kang?

462
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,236
Does Ms. Kang know?

463
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,827
Who you received your heart from?

464
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:19,961
I will never talk about Ms. Kang with you.

465
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:02,921
I'll be 15 minutes late
because my meeting ran long.

466
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:03,963
I'm so sorry.

467
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:05,798
It's okay.

468
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,083
-Hello?
-Where are you?

469
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:46,130
I just came home.
I was too tired to wait for you.

470
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,551
Okay. I see.

471
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,929
All right, then.

472
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,264
Hello?

473
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,642
Okay. Then rest up at home.

474
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,311
Where…

475
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:03,982
Where are you now?

476
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,859
-Sorry for making you wait.
-Gosh.

477
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:10,780
What…

478
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,202
Why did you scare me like that?
And you were late too!

479
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,746
Sorry. I was just messing with you.

480
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,707
You should know when to mess with people.

481
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,003
Yes. You're right.

482
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,172
And it's time to mess around.

483
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,425
Oh, dear.

484
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,303
How did you find me so quickly?

485
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,389
Your perfume.

486
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,641
That's the smell of tteokbokki.

487
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:42,937
I see. It smells great.

488
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,190
Just follow me.

489
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:52,280
You'll have to wait for about an hour
to get a table.

490
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,906
Should I put down your names?

491
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,536
When did this place get so popular?

492
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:02,165
This used to be my hidden gem.

493
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,878
Let's go to another restaurant.
There are a lot of good ones.

494
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,213
Okay.

495
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,972
I know a great place.

496
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:19,599
Okay.

497
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,769
This restaurant actually serves good…

498
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,566
Why are so many people eating out tonight?

499
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:35,573
Then let me try next.

500
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,076
Okay.

501
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:48,044
This way. Only a few foodies know this…

502
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,588
SOLD OUT
WE'VE CLOSED EARLY TODAY

503
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,841
It's closed.

504
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:12,693
Should we just eat
at the first restaurant we see?

505
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,240
I wanted to buy you a good meal.

506
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,868
Everything sounds good right now.

507
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,997
Then should we just go to my house?

508
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,000
What?

509
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,711
Eun-ha and Cheol-do are at Gugu Building,

510
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,964
and Ga-yeong might barge in again.

511
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,591
Don't get me wrong.

512
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,135
It's okay if they come.

513
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:40,221
They can even come over and eat with us.

514
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,890
Food tastes better with friends.
Should I call them?

515
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,395
-But…
-Yes?

516
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:53,067
didn't you say that your friends
come over to your house often?

517
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:57,530
Oh. You don't have to worry about that.

518
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,949
Seung-won will be editing all night.
I checked.

519
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:01,826
You checked?

520
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:07,582
No. I didn't do that on purpose.

521
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,792
Seung-won calls and texts me often.

522
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:13,963
I mean, he even sends me
photos of his meals. What's with him?

523
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:19,302
I even wondered if this is
a case of relationship addiction.

524
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,470
But with relationship addiction,

525
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:24,849
one's self-esteem becomes low
when the other person keeps ignoring them.

526
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,852
But this jerk…
But his self-esteem doesn't.

527
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:33,691
In that case, I can only conclude that
he's trying to gain social interest.

528
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:37,987
He needs to get
a lot of attention even if it's shallow.

529
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,032
With that conclusion,
he found a job that suits his needs.

530
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:45,203
So what exactly did you say
to check if he'd come over or not?

531
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,415
You're not coming over, right?

532
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,875
Not today, right?

533
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,835
You're not, right?

534
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:54,754
Gosh.

535
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,006
You got a text message.

536
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,427
You got a text message.

537
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:04,055
If he misses me, he should just say it.

538
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,724
-You got a text message.
-Who is it?

539
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:07,850
Someone I know.

540
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,396
-Do you miss me?
-If you come over, I'll kill you.

541
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,522
-I'll come over.
-Don't.

542
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,523
Seriously?

543
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,317
No, I have an all-nighter.

544
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,237
I edited out boring parts,
so I'm left with a six-minute video.

545
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:23,032
Oh, right. I sent you a package. Open it.

546
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:24,283
Half of it is yours.

547
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,340
Come on in.

548
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,390
So this is what your place looks like.

549
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,434
Nothing has changed since last time.

550
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,896
I didn't have time
to look around your house that night.

551
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,106
Why…

552
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,776
Right. I'm sorry.

553
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,319
-Please sit.
-Okay.

554
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,240
What would you like to drink?

555
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,242
-Water, please.
-Water.

556
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,208
What's in the package?

557
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,837
Actually, I was going to open it to see.

558
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,550
Here you go.

559
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,176
Thank you.

560
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,685
THE VIRILITY KING

561
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,771
What's this?

562
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,606
THE VIRILITY KING

563
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,620
"In Dongui Bogam, silky bush clover

564
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:54,290
is recorded as the Virility King.

565
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:58,044
This herb is known
to increase virility during the night.

566
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:01,964
Those of you who dream of
becoming the ruler of the steamy night…"

567
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,551
That's what this is?

568
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,846
You must know better since you ordered it.

569
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:11,891
Wait.

570
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,186
It's not mine.

571
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,313
I don't even drink alcohol. Why would I…

572
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,652
"It's very effective
if you make tea with it."

573
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,074
Right. I can just show you the texts.

574
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,287
Look. Read this.

575
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,538
See? I didn't order it.

576
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,582
Oh, right. I sent you a package. Open it.

577
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:37,708
Half of it is yours.

578
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,752
IF YOU COME OVER, I'LL KILL YOU

579
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,670
You're not coming over, right?

580
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,757
Not today, right? You're not, right?

581
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:48,052
You did check multiple times.

582
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:49,887
Oh, dear.

583
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,310
Our food is here.

584
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,729
I'm glad we ordered it on our way.

585
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,690
Okay. Please come on up.

586
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,113
All right.

587
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,041
NOTICE OF SUCCESSION

588
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,751
I came because of that,

589
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,087
but she's not home.

590
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,756
You should have called.

591
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,967
If I did, she would've asked why I called.

592
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,678
Then I would've told her everything.

593
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,722
But I thought I should tell her in person.

594
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,017
You're right.

595
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:37,977
Should I just

596
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,479
not tell her?

597
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:44,233
What are you talking about?
She ought to know too.

598
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,027
You should tell her,
even if it's over the phone.

599
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:03,669
You must be bored.
There's nothing to do here.

600
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:04,753
Want to watch TV?

601
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:06,338
No.

602
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:09,341
Okay. It won't take long.

603
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:14,597
It's ready.

604
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,432
All right.

605
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,393
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

606
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:25,900
This is good.

607
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,653
I don't know
what other people do to host guests.

608
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,238
There's not much to do here.

609
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,450
Is the chair comfortable?

610
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,619
If you want to relax, you can lie down…

611
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,124
Did I really say that?

612
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:46,504
I didn't mean to say that. I…

613
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,839
I don't have a sofa in the living room.

614
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,841
I should go and buy one tomorrow.

615
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,219
I was afraid the guys might
come over more often

616
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,054
and sleep on it, so I didn't buy one.

617
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:57,389
But I would've bought it
if I knew you'd be here.

618
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,433
For you to lie down and relax…

619
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,437
I did that again.
I'm not telling you to lie down.

620
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:05,773
What's wrong with me?

621
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:10,152
This chair is comfortable.

622
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:11,946
Okay.

623
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:16,033
You seem to be
the one feeling uncomfortable here.

624
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,328
Do you know
you seem really flustered today?

625
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:23,958
Right. I'm not usually like this.

626
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,668
I rarely get taken aback too.

627
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:29,713
But for some reason,
I have a lot on my mind today.

628
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:33,008
I mean, not any weird thoughts.

629
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,390
I should sit down here.

630
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,317
Young-do.

631
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,531
Nice. Coffee.

632
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,201
Smells great.

633
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,539
Are you in the bathroom?

634
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,001
Young-do.

635
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:53,005
-Young-do, where are you?
-But why are we hiding?

636
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,590
I see ice cubes in the coffee.

637
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,968
-Well…
-Young-do.

638
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,973
Young-do, where are you?

639
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,351
All the lights are on.

640
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,436
Is he sick?

641
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,773
YOUNG-DO

642
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,198
THOUSAND WON

643
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:27,790
-We should just go out now.
-No.

644
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,334
He might get the wrong idea
if we go out now.

645
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,337
Ha-neul, are you with Young-do now?

646
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,215
He had a slight fever yesterday.
I wonder if he's sick again.

647
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:37,758
I'm at his house now.

648
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,260
I think he left in a hurry.

649
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:44,264
The lights are on. And the ice cubes
in the coffee haven't melted yet.

650
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,105
I see.

651
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,399
Oh, dear.

652
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,651
Young-do.

653
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,654
Where are you?

654
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,157
Are we playing hide-and-seek?

655
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:06,453
Young-do, you're not in that room,
are you?

656
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,539
I'm coming in.

657
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,419
Why lock the door?

658
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,003
He might come in.

659
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,755
That makes it more suspicious.

660
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:22,302
Young-do.

661
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,432
I'm bored right now. Young-do.

662
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:30,394
Gosh. I guess he's really not home.

663
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,189
I should go and buy some beer.

664
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,859
How come there's no beer here?

665
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:38,694
How can there be a house without beer?

666
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,809
Ta-da!

667
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:15,397
Goodness.

668
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:21,195
Young-do. Why did you close the door?

669
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:23,071
Young-do, I'm scared.

670
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,865
Why are there women's shoes here?

671
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,117
Young-do.

672
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,999
I'm sorry.

673
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,004
Sorry.

674
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,474
Why is he calling me?

675
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,560
He's calling instead of texting?

676
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,441
It's my brother.

677
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:03,070
I see. Tae-jeong? You should answer it.

678
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,154
Okay.

679
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:08,617
Hey.

680
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,620
Your address is set as Gangneung, right?

681
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,206
Yes. Why do you ask?

682
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:17,793
You know, our so-called father…

683
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,508
Yes.

684
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:27,928
I think he passed away.

685
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,474
How do you know that?

686
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,770
I received a notice of succession.

687
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:41,608
It says we have to pay off the debts
left by him, the deceased.

688
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,946
If yours went to Gangneung,
Mom must have already found out.

689
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,284
Are you there?

690
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,955
I'm listening.

691
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,335
I'm getting off work early tomorrow.

692
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,837
I'll go to Gangneung.

693
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,214
I'll come with you. I should be there too.

694
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,092
When are you leaving?

695
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,853
KANG YE-SEONG LAW FIRM

696
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,772
I want to take care of this
without my kids knowing.

697
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:25,402
If it was sent to your daughter,
your son must have gotten it as well.

698
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,655
Don't worry.

699
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:33,452
When they renounce the succession,
they can file an objection to this notice.

700
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,543
Here.

701
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,754
This is Da-jeong's. That's yours.

702
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:45,339
Thanks.

703
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:49,343
Drive safely.
And take care of your mom too.

704
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,597
And you should take care of yourself too.

705
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,599
I'm fine.

706
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,226
I'm going there for my sister and mom.

707
00:48:58,810 --> 00:48:59,811
Even so.

708
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:05,525
I'm thinking about heading over
after I'm done with work.

709
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,778
No. That's not necessary.

710
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:13,116
I know you have patients tomorrow.
It will be tiring to go back and forth.

711
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:16,036
That's not a problem.

712
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:20,332
I'm just

713
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,168
going there to see my mom.

714
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:34,179
There's this line
from a movie called Incendies.

715
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,309
"Childhood is like
a knife stuck in the throat

716
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:42,104
which cannot be easily removed."

717
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:46,483
I guess this year

718
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,277
is the year I pull out that knife.

719
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:59,162
But I already pulled
most of it out with you,

720
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:02,999
so all there's left to do
is simply remove it.

721
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,880
I'll pull it out easily
like a circus performer.

722
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,174
Just like this.

723
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,097
If you get too excited, you'll get hurt.

724
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:28,734
Then the center took care of his funeral?

725
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,445
I guess so.

726
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:36,199
If it weren't for
the notice of succession,

727
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,034
they wouldn't have known that he died.

728
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,079
I guess.

729
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,207
Shouldn't we go with them?

730
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,501
Da-jeong was smiling when she left.

731
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:50,005
She was begging us
not to make a fuss out of this.

732
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:55,135
I feel bad that
no one was there when he died.

733
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:57,471
Even I feel bad.

734
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,473
She's going to need a lot of good fortune

735
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:02,684
to break even with
all these misfortunes in her life.

736
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:14,237
Thanks for driving.

737
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,238
Sure.

738
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:17,949
Let's go in.

739
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:19,910
Okay.

740
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:30,420
Go back to Seoul right away
after saying hi to Mom.

741
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:33,215
You have work.

742
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:38,386
It must've been hard to explain
why you needed a day off today.

743
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:41,765
Okay.

744
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:46,645
To tell the truth…

745
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:52,818
I saw him once.

746
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:01,576
When?

747
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,497
When I was in seventh grade,

748
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:09,417
I waited in front of your school.
Remember that?

749
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,379
When I sprained my ankle.

750
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:19,344
That winter when you came
to my school limping?

751
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:20,804
Yes.

752
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,933
He came to my school to see me that day.

753
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:29,980
How did you recognize him?

754
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:34,484
I just did when I saw him.

755
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:38,905
Did you talk to him?

756
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,032
No.

757
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:44,077
I rushed over to you as soon as I saw him.

758
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:48,707
Why?

759
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,210
I was scared…

760
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,592
that he might go to you.

761
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,638
Or that he might follow me…

762
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:10,353
and hurt Mom again.

763
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:47,015
I thought you didn't know
because you were so young.

764
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:53,563
Right.

765
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,816
I don't know why I remember that.

766
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,575
Why didn't you tell me?

767
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,870
You didn't tell me about it either.

768
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,084
Sorry.

769
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:17,712
Stop that. Why are you apologizing?

770
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,677
I thought only I remembered it.

771
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:31,977
Maybe I should have said hello that day.

772
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,439
I shouldn't tell Mom about this. Right?

773
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:52,956
Mom.

774
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:57,502
-Did you eat?
-We ate.

775
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:58,753
What about you?

776
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:01,047
I said you didn't have to come.
Why are you here?

777
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,008
You don't come when I ask you to.

778
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,344
Go and get changed.

779
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:10,890
Come on. You were born with good looks.
What's up with the dull outfits?

780
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,730
As for the debt he left behind…

781
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,232
I'll take care of it.

782
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,901
-What do you mean?
-I can pay it off.

783
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:25,488
Are you crazy?
How do you know this is his only debt?

784
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:29,492
A lot more creditors might show up
if they hear you're paying it off.

785
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:34,998
Don't you ever think about it.
Not a penny from you two.

786
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,671
Here's the document.
Stamp it with your seal.

787
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,506
And forget about this.

788
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,218
Do you understand me?

789
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:49,888
Yes.

790
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,434
What about you?

791
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,103
Yes.

792
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:01,149
No wonder he showed up in my dreams.

793
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,155
Want some Korean melons?

794
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:09,074
-I'll go get them.
-Stay here.

795
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,539
At least he kept his promise.

796
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,043
I told him not to find us
until he was dead.

797
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:21,836
So…

798
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:25,090
he came back after he died.

799
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,264
That's when I realized.

800
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:40,647
Mom was scared her whole life
that he might come looking for us.

801
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:47,362
Mom and my brother…

802
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:50,073
We all remembered it.

803
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:57,038
The memories that seemed to be faded away

804
00:56:57,122 --> 00:57:00,667
only seemed so
because I avoided recalling them.

805
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,840
He should have lived a better life.

806
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:13,221
To live a life without seeing the man
who was once the love of her life,

807
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:18,101
what did she have to go through?

808
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,023
Tae-jeong, peel them for us.
Be careful with the knife.

809
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,780
Her past love ended up

810
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,659
becoming a knife stuck in our throats.

811
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:39,372
Was she ever able to cry her heart out?

812
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,670
Did she run the water

813
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,173
even when she was alone?

814
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:14,282
Mom.

815
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,577
It's okay to cry.

816
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:41,142
I just got off. I was thinking
about heading over there. Is that okay?

817
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,318
Oh, no. I checked the message too late.

818
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:54,572
I just had a delicious meal
with my mom. I'm so stuffed.

819
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:25,121
Can you not come?

820
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,790
I want to spend time with her alone.

821
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,335
Sure. See you tomorrow then.

822
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,587
Let's check out
the beach together next time.

823
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:37,675
Sure. Let's check out
the beach together next time.

824
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:55,735
CYCLOSPORINE

825
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:42,657
What was your temperature this morning?

826
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:46,160
It was 37.2 degrees Celsius.

827
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,665
Right before I left,
it did go down to 37 degrees.

828
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:52,333
I think you'll be okay,

829
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:53,251
JU-WON

830
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:54,794
but you're on your way, right?

831
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:58,339
Yes. I'll be there after this signal.

832
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:00,633
Okay. Let's get you x-rayed
when you get here.

833
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,302
Okay.

834
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:06,556
Hello? Were you coughing just now?

835
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:08,766
I thought it was just a fever.

836
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:10,518
Young-do.

837
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:13,229
Answer me. Ju Young-do.

838
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:27,196
Yuddy shows Su Li Zhen

839
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,615
a watch for one minute.

840
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:33,286
He says that one minute
will be remembered forever.

841
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:35,997
So this is how I understood it.

842
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:39,208
"I'll be leaving eventually,

843
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:42,545
but this one minute is just for you.

844
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:45,548
No one will take it from you,

845
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:47,800
and it won't disappear either.

846
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:51,721
It's a one-minute eternity just for you."

847
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:57,810
