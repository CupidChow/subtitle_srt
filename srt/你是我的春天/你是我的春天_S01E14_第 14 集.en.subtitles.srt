1
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,893
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

2
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,020
Why were you standing there?

3
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,272
I wanted to open the door for you.

4
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,565
Why all of a sudden?

5
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,276
Because I want to treat you well.

6
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,172
-Can you let go?
-Why?

7
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:15,718
I mean, we should hold hands like this
if we want to walk side by side.

8
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,727
-Should I carry that for you?
-It's not heavy.

9
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,979
Let me know if it is.

10
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,613
You must've always
wanted to treat me like this.

11
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,909
It must've been so hard for you.

12
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,632
You should go.

13
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,718
I should.

14
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,804
You have work tomorrow.

15
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:01,806
Right.

16
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,643
And you have work tomorrow as well.

17
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,731
Let me walk you to your car.

18
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:14,235
After all, you gave me a ride.
It's only fair.

19
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,655
Would you like that?

20
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,074
Sure.

21
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,247
You should go now.

22
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,959
I'll leave after seeing you go home.

23
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,586
But I'm seeing you off.

24
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:36,299
Then should I walk you to the rooftop?

25
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,594
Would you like that?

26
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,764
This is never going to end.

27
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:44,974
I know.

28
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,186
-Go in.
-Okay.

29
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,472
Yes?

30
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,225
Why are you still there?

31
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,481
Why did you come out?

32
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,026
I wanted to see you leave. Go on.

33
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,362
Good night.

34
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,098
I just came home…

35
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,311
and turned on the lights.

36
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,897
And now, I'm passing by the fridge.

37
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,154
What time do you normally sleep?

38
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,032
Around midnight?

39
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,825
You sleep late.

40
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,411
What about you?

41
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,789
Around midnight from now on.

42
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,337
I'd like to visit Gangneung.

43
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,671
How about this weekend?

44
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,298
Are you free?

45
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:44,343
Of course. I need to see my mom too.

46
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,721
What should we do tomorrow?

47
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:52,477
How about we watch a movie on the rooftop?

48
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,023
But I don't want to see
other people's faces.

49
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,151
I only want to see you.

50
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,780
You're so silly.

51
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,458
EPISODE 14

52
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,417
Come in.

53
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:20,880
Young-do.

54
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,340
PSYCHIATRIST JU YOUNG-DO

55
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,800
Hey, you're here.

56
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,302
You're upset, aren't you?

57
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,054
Ha-neul told me to avoid you.

58
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,098
Come on in.

59
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,767
What? It's okay. I'm here to see him.

60
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,810
I should leave.

61
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,896
No. Just come in. Come on in.

62
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,397
Sit down.

63
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,566
Can I do that?

64
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,734
Sure.

65
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,696
Why haven't you been coming?

66
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,200
I've been a bit busy lately.

67
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,453
Is that why you're here?

68
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,913
Is it because I bit you?

69
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,584
In any case, if it's because of me,

70
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,419
I'd like to give you a refund.

71
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,631
It's okay. I'm sure it's past
the refund period. It's fine.

72
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:13,724
Did your producer friend say anything?

73
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,561
About something I had asked him?

74
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,105
Hold on. I'm going out right now.

75
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,410
You have feelings for her, don't you?

76
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,786
Sorry?

77
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,289
Why…

78
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:38,833
How did you know?

79
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,503
You must've never had a crush before.

80
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,714
It just shows.

81
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,427
I'm sorry for coming here unannounced.

82
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,554
Are you leaving already?

83
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,561
What is it?

84
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,690
What were you thinking?

85
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,983
I'm not sure.

86
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:07,153
Seriously, you're not helping at all.

87
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,781
You must've never had a crush before.

88
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,451
It just shows.

89
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,913
Is it peach-flavored?

90
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,587
-This won't do.
-I said, no.

91
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,630
Why not?

92
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:27,924
There are people here.

93
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,385
-No.
-Why not?

94
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,853
Hey. I saw Young-do.

95
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:41,938
I see.

96
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,611
Did you and Ms. Han talk about anything?

97
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,947
What? Who said that?

98
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,533
That doesn't matter.
What did you talk about?

99
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,035
I've seen women cry over Young-do,

100
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,412
but never over you. I was so surprised.

101
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,665
Why does she like you?

102
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,709
Beats me.

103
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,093
Something urgent came up,
so I need to go first.

104
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,011
-Sure. Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

105
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:28,943
It's nothing bad.
It's just that I have a girlfriend now.

106
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,447
She's always been like your girlfriend.

107
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:38,160
One thing that's changed is
that you're officially going out now.

108
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,164
I guess there's no backing out now.

109
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,128
You can do it, Young-do!

110
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,802
Gosh, this is…

111
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,639
This is a bit…

112
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,769
Does this look better?

113
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,446
Perhaps, the first one.

114
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,034
It's either this or this.

115
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,880
Advice for Relationship Virgins.
Number one.

116
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,883
Change up your style.

117
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,428
Do you always have the same hairstyle
and wear the same clothes?

118
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,679
I do.

119
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,599
Switch up your look,

120
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,975
and it'll spice things up.

121
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,853
Switch up my look?

122
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,620
A TRUE MAN BOASTS A POMADE HAIRSTYLE

123
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,595
You're wearing little makeup
but moistening your lips.

124
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,597
What's that for?

125
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,975
Go away.

126
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,397
I thought I'd turn out like Ms. Carlson.

127
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,358
But now, I think
I'll turn out like Ms. Rowson.

128
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:34,902
Hello?

129
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,195
Aren't you going to ask?

130
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,573
-I'll arrive in five minutes.
-Right. Who are they?

131
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,577
Ms. Carlson was my next-door neighbor.

132
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,580
She shot a nail gun
in her husband's head during a fight

133
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,706
and was arrested.

134
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,084
Ms. Rowson lived a lonely life
until she died.

135
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,794
No one knew she was dead,

136
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,879
and the police only found out two weeks…

137
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,048
Okay. I'm going out right now.

138
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,808
I just want to see his face.
You said he's handsome.

139
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,102
It's been ages since I saw a handsome guy.

140
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:11,772
I'm going blind here. I can't see well.

141
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,899
Then watch a drama or a movie.

142
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,111
Just this once.
Don't you want to brag about him?

143
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,323
Will you leave after seeing him?

144
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,366
I will.

145
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,535
No weird questions.

146
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,954
No getting excited or swearing.

147
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,874
"I've heard about you.
You're Jack, right?"

148
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:33,043
No teasing by calling him by another name.

149
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:36,172
"There's a stain. Thanks for the bow."

150
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,215
No jokes like that.

151
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,425
I can't do anything?

152
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,594
Can I ask him for money?

153
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,513
I'm kidding. I'm just so excited.

154
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,973
He must be so handsome.

155
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,225
When is he arriving?

156
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,647
One minute.

157
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,027
Hello?

158
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,945
-Oh, you can't come?
-I'm here.

159
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,363
Oh, well. Goodbye.

160
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,157
Who's he waving at?

161
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,745
He can't make it.
He's too busy. Maybe next time.

162
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:08,996
Really?

163
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,749
Yes, really. Let's take a rain check.

164
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,960
Fine. Keep your promise.

165
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,213
You'll see him when he looks normal.

166
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,849
You put on lipstick. You look beautiful.

167
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,519
What's on your hair?

168
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,480
-Does it look weird?
-Follow me.

169
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,315
Where are we going?

170
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,317
Be quiet and follow me.

171
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,778
From a distance, please.

172
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,573
Yes. You're wearing a pretty watch

173
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,995
and a nice shirt.
And now, your hair looks good too.

174
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,913
Right.

175
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,041
Are you sulking?

176
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,627
No.

177
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:46,510
You have a handsome forehead.
I didn't know that.

178
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,018
-Let's go eat.
-Okay.

179
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:00,024
You must've been nervous
about our first date.

180
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,484
I guess it was just me.

181
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:07,156
I wasn't nervous at all.
It was just like any other day.

182
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,282
I see.

183
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,788
Darn it!

184
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,586
I have no clothes
to wear on the first date.

185
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,547
I should've emptied out my entire closet.

186
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,382
What should I do?

187
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:27,927
Gosh.

188
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,603
Did I look that bad?

189
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,980
No, not really.

190
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,816
Then why did you push me
into the restroom?

191
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:49,198
I think I should answer that
with what you said to me before.

192
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,117
How far are we walking?

193
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,953
Let's go back and change.

194
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,746
-Are you not having fun?
-No.

195
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,289
Why not?

196
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,626
Because I'm completely sober,

197
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,002
and these people…

198
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,755
"These people can see me."

199
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,216
I see.

200
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,303
I must've looked more embarrassing today
than I did in that wig.

201
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:15,933
Back then, we voluntarily
did something wacky.

202
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:19,019
Then next time, I'll try something else.

203
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,146
Don't.

204
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,440
-I have an idea.
-I'll leave you on the street.

205
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,068
Fine, I won't. Don't leave me.

206
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,826
By the way, that was so unexpected.

207
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,995
Why did you do that?

208
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,455
I read it in a magazine.

209
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,125
What kind of magazine was it?

210
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,379
I read it at Ha-neul's clinic.
It said it'd help spice things up.

211
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,841
Spice things up even more,
and it could be dangerous.

212
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,467
Things are already hot as is.

213
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:58,517
Will my heart that goes boom, clap
find its other half?

214
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,812
Boom, Clap will begin now.

215
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,564
DATING REALITY SHOW
BOOM, CLAP

216
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,316
CLAP
SMILE

217
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,323
BOOM, CLAP

218
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,493
BIG REACTIONS

219
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,505
Didn't you say he was the quiet type?

220
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,133
That's enough!

221
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,763
Which one of them will get
the chance to make eye contact?

222
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,473
It's the final match.

223
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,392
Get ready, set, go.

224
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,689
Gosh, you're…

225
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,400
remarkably strong, Ms. Han.

226
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,945
Why does she look so down?

227
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,739
She's been like that from the start.

228
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,492
I told her earlier, but she won't budge.

229
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,751
And what's wrong with him?

230
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,378
Hey! Smile!

231
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:12,007
MOMENT OF TRUTH

232
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,052
So far, there have been
no couples matched.

233
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:18,639
Right, but we still have one final chance.

234
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,808
Ms. Han, please make your move.

235
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,351
Start.

236
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,439
Please…

237
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,068
Please accept it.

238
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,695
Please…

239
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:41,829
Guys, open your eyes.

240
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,671
Please accept it. Please…

241
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,425
I'm sorry.

242
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,432
What a shame.

243
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:06,478
In the end, there are no couples.

244
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,398
BOOM, CLAP LOVE INTERESTS

245
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,316
How is this possible?

246
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,776
Can we even air this?

247
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:14,820
What do you think?

248
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,990
-Any new ideas?
-What do you think?

249
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:21,243
-Can you edit it somehow?
-We're done for.

250
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,669
Hello.

251
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,546
-Good work.
-Good work.

252
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,089
-Good work.
-Good work.

253
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,509
Good work.

254
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:41,305
Hey, thank you for today.
I hope we can work together again.

255
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,764
Sure. Give me a call.

256
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,435
I read the article.

257
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,146
Not only do we look alike,
we also have a lot in common.

258
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,149
Ms. Ahn and I are quite close.

259
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,193
We even went camping not long ago.

260
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,362
You're the one who lost your shoe.

261
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,031
Yes! How did you know?

262
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,660
I'm sorry, but can you do me a favor?

263
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,123
We agreed not to see each other.

264
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,125
You even kicked Da-jeong out.

265
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,585
What are you doing?

266
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,963
I don't have a phone or a car.

267
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,341
And I can't visit your house either.

268
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,675
Yes, we shouldn't meet.

269
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,302
I was worried you'd be scared.

270
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,389
Don't worry too much about the photo.

271
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,059
Photo? Someone took a photo of us?

272
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,437
Oh, I thought you already knew.

273
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,647
Will they post it?

274
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,191
No. It all got solved.

275
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,078
We may be

276
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:50,457
drinking seawater right now.

277
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,252
We know it's wrong,

278
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:58,507
but once we hear each other's voice,
we forget everything.

279
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,763
Look at us now meeting secretly again.

280
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,269
Do you know what happens
when you drink seawater?

281
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,776
We can be careful.

282
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:24,157
Why does my gut tell me
that you won't be okay?

283
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,244
Why aren't you scared?

284
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,329
Shouldn't you be more terrified than me?

285
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,749
I'm more terrified
that you might want to break up.

286
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,295
Why don't you get it?

287
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,422
If people get wind of us…

288
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,810
How long do you think…

289
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,938
your love for me will last?

290
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,442
Even after your love is gone,

291
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,362
people will always
associate you with my name.

292
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,406
Do you know that?

293
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,492
We talked about this.

294
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,330
Let's take a break for a week.

295
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,998
What do you mean?

296
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,375
If it's bearable…

297
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,023
The hot summer is already here.

298
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,232
It's so scorching hot

299
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,902
that I have no appetite.

300
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,362
Yet you ordered a large size.

301
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,073
I'm only eating to survive.

302
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,783
You must be desperate.

303
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,410
The citizens' discomfort index
is skyrocketing.

304
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,245
Due to high temperature and humidity,

305
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:56,750
they become extremely annoyed
by even the slightest touch…

306
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:57,876
Hey.

307
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,128
Da-jeong?

308
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,880
-However,
-Isn't that her?

309
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,299
many couples still hold hands

310
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,968
-That's her, right?
-and remain affectionate.

311
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,221
I'm Lee Yong-seop from TVC News.

312
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,138
You're right.

313
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,681
She has a boyfriend?

314
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,809
I guess so.

315
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:15,894
Who is he?

316
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,230
What do you think?

317
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:20,440
He's someone she likes.

318
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,652
Invite him to Gangneung.
I have a few questions.

319
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,612
A few questions, my foot.

320
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,531
I know you're going to ask him

321
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:30,242
all sorts of questions
and leave him in tatters.

322
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,537
How did you know?
You see right through me.

323
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,089
Thank you for your hard work.

324
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,465
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

325
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,550
Let's get drunk.

326
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:51,888
Here.

327
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,766
We already finished a bottle.

328
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,102
Excuse me. One more bottle, please.

329
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,439
You must've been busier because of me.

330
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,984
I'm cutting down on my outside work.

331
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,777
That's a great idea.

332
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,197
You've been too busy.
You even lost a lot of weight.

333
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:10,782
He's right.

334
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:15,370
There was a time
when you were chubby and cute.

335
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:20,625
How long have you two
been working together?

336
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,628
I'll tell you next time.

337
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,798
It's been eight years already.

338
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:28,967
Oh, dear.

339
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,845
I had quit work at the hospital,

340
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:34,723
refused to meet anyone,
and stayed home all day long.

341
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:39,728
In other words,
it was when I was a helpless woman

342
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,648
who was lost in a dark tunnel.

343
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:49,070
8 YEARS AGO

344
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,552
It must've been tough coming here.

345
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:38,972
You had booked an appointment
with Dr. Seok,

346
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,974
but something urgent came up.

347
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,143
-So I'm here instead--
-A resident?

348
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,603
Yes, I am.

349
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:49,899
Ma'am.

350
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:53,028
Could you tell me why you're here?

351
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:58,199
I'm too prejudiced to entrust my life…

352
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,455
to such a young doctor.

353
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,065
Should I…

354
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:35,653
just go with you, honey?

355
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,366
I'd…

356
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,165
like to do that.

357
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,137
Is this Ms. Oh Mi-kyeong?

358
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,432
This is Ju Young-do,

359
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:48,143
the psychiatry resident you met today
at Majin Hospital.

360
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:55,066
I felt terrible
for not being able to help you earlier.

361
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:59,821
I called you in case
you wanted a prescription.

362
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,283
Since we have your chart,

363
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:06,161
I can prescribe you medication
without you having to come--

364
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,287
Hello?

365
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,998
Yes, hello?

366
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,215
Hello?

367
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,429
Yes, Ms. Oh. I'm listening.

368
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:28,892
Hello?

369
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,311
Hello.

370
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,690
This is Ju Young-do. I'm listening.

371
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,743
My husband called me

372
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,954
right before he died.

373
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,499
But I was too busy

374
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,835
tending to my patients

375
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,213
to pick up.

376
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,341
My phone has been ringing all day.

377
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:06,137
Even when I disconnect it.

378
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,517
It must be painful.

379
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,603
You must have trouble sleeping.

380
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:19,984
Do you still hear
your phone ringing right now?

381
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,153
No.

382
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,784
Not right now.

383
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,998
Had you picked up his call,

384
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,877
what do you think he would've said to you?

385
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,799
"Take care of yourself.

386
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,720
Be happy." He would've said that.

387
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,271
"Don't be too sad…

388
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,570
that I'm gone."

389
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,912
When I heard that
he was going to open his own clinic,

390
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,290
I reached out to him first.

391
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,877
So that's how you two met.

392
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,630
Anyway, I'm glad to hear
that you're cutting down on work.

393
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,301
If you kept working like a dog
like you have,

394
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,971
I was going to tell you
what you said to me back then.

395
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:37,270
"You don't need to live a life of grief
because of someone who has died."

396
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,148
Don't feel too guilty
about what has happened.

397
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:45,904
Live every day
as if it's your last and be happy.

398
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,949
Come see me whenever you need help.

399
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,660
Eat it.

400
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,287
I already ate so much.

401
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,998
Option one. Just eat.

402
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,043
Option two. Eat after getting nagged.

403
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,628
Oh, dear.

404
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:06,424
Then will you no longer
help the police or appear on the radio?

405
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,178
The police need a little more of my help,

406
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:14,766
and I'll quit the radio show
at the end of next month.

407
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:21,814
Da-jeong.

408
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,901
Did you eat a lot?

409
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,653
I sure did. And you?

410
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,655
-Likewise.
-Let's go.

411
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,450
What do we need to buy?

412
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,370
Just beer and fruit will do.

413
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,455
We can order in the rest.

414
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:38,581
I see.

415
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,877
What do your friends like?

416
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,422
They're fine as long as it's edible.

417
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:51,427
Eun-ha likes watermelon,
and Cheol-do likes jelly.

418
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,428
I see.

419
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,640
By the way,

420
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:02,480
about how we agreed not to tell anyone
about us until tomorrow…

421
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:08,444
I actually told Eun-ha about it.

422
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,322
I see. Just her?

423
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:19,414
To tell the truth,
I got really mad at Seung-won that day.

424
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,583
And now that we're dating,
I thought he deserved to know.

425
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,168
I agree.

426
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:28,631
Then I felt bad
for keeping Ha-neul in the dark, so…

427
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,134
-Right. They're like a set.
-Right.

428
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,469
And I also told Ms. Oh.

429
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,513
I see.

430
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:43,396
And earlier today, I also told
a part-timer at a convenience store.

431
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,981
A part-timer?

432
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,066
-You're done.
-Okay.

433
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,444
I'm going to drink this
with my girlfriend.

434
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,611
Sorry?

435
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:54,240
-And I also told a customer
-This is for me and my girlfriend.

436
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,284
-who was waiting behind me.
-You can go now.

437
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,452
Go on.

438
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,370
For my girlfriend.

439
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,838
Ga-yeong knows as well.

440
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,466
It wasn't by coincidence. I called her.

441
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,552
What's gotten into you?
You never call me first.

442
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:15,595
Did something happen?

443
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,389
Yes, but it's good news.

444
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,433
Da-jeong and I are dating.

445
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,477
Seriously? Are you certain?

446
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,645
Yes. I'm certain.

447
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,524
You better treat my friend well.

448
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,651
Had I been her
and heard those words from you,

449
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,821
I would've skewered you,
put you out in the sun for four days,

450
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,324
poured some sauce on you
when you were dry enough,

451
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:39,368
tossed you in front of a tiger,
and saved you in the nick of time.

452
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,162
Got that?

453
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:48,169
Oh, and there's this boy who brings
his puppy to Ha-neul's clinic.

454
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,802
Hi. Do you remember me?

455
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,638
I do. You're that relationship virgin.

456
00:34:58,721 --> 00:34:59,722
You little…

457
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,474
I have a girlfriend.

458
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:03,935
Look.

459
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:08,564
Ta-da.

460
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,274
Isn't she pretty?

461
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,401
She's wonderful, amazing, and smart.

462
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,278
Yes. She's pretty.

463
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:17,365
Right? And she's my girlfriend.

464
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,158
So don't call me a relationship…

465
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:23,246
Anyway, that's not me.
Don't call me that anymore.

466
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:24,997
Okay.

467
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,626
Do you have a girlfriend?

468
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,044
No.

469
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,712
Oh, dear.

470
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,133
You don't have one?

471
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,637
Gosh. Oh, dear.

472
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,143
She's my girlfriend.

473
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:46,936
To a kid?

474
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:48,729
Yes.

475
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,650
An employee at a car wash also knows.

476
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,737
I'm getting it cleaned
before seeing my girlfriend.

477
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,489
Sorry?

478
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,118
And the gas station worker too.

479
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,039
-How much?
-To the brim, please.

480
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,332
-To the brim?
-Yes.

481
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,460
-Do you have a membership?
-No, I don't.

482
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,796
But I have a girlfriend.

483
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,591
-Sorry?
-A girlfriend.

484
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,760
Is there anyone who doesn't know in Korea?

485
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:24,098
Cheol-do and A-ri probably don't know.

486
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,101
They know. I told them.

487
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,437
Have you thought about the blind date?

488
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,815
Well, I can't do that.

489
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:37,236
Why not? Do you detest manly-looking guys?

490
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:43,367
Actually, I have a boyfriend now.

491
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,577
Hey, Da-jeong.

492
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:49,040
I know Young-do was harsh,
but isn't this too soon?

493
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:55,671
Bye.

494
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:56,923
Okay.

495
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,843
She meant him.

496
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,430
What? Is it true?

497
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,266
Are you dating Young-do?

498
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,813
So you told everyone as well.

499
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,566
I only told people I know.

500
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,194
You might as well report it to the news.

501
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,331
By the way, can you really cook?

502
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,583
Of course. Say what you want to eat.

503
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:36,712
-Can I ask for anything?
-Of course.

504
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:40,675
There are only two dishes in my world.
Kimchi fried rice and ramyeon.

505
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,471
Then I pick Kimchi fried rice.

506
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:48,933
All right.

507
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,645
One of these.

508
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,149
Have you made it before?

509
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,110
I was even complimented.

510
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:03,155
Didn't you say your friends weren't picky
and liked anything edible?

511
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,075
Not them. Why would I cook for them?

512
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,620
-Then for whom?
-My ex…

513
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,419
Your what?

514
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,181
So what? It'd be stranger
if you had been single all this time.

515
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:32,518
So you made it for your ex-girlfriend?
She must've liked it.

516
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,895
Yes. She did.

517
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,236
What? Why…

518
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,988
We need that.

519
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:45,865
Wait.

520
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,202
We found a camera at the crime scene

521
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,914
while investigating Noh Hyeon-ju's case.

522
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,167
We confirmed that Hwang Jae-sik
was the killer.

523
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,045
While searching his house,

524
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:02,590
we found a journal
presumably written by him.

525
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:03,758
EVIDENCE 1, 2, 3

526
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:07,345
You must be familiar with On Ji-cheol
who committed four murders

527
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,513
and kept a handwritten journal in 2001.

528
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,973
This case is very similar.

529
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,308
KIM MYEONG-JA'S MURDER CASE

530
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,851
A substantial amount

531
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:17,188
of undisclosed, crucial information
was written in the journal.

532
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:20,900
His record of the cause of death
and murder weapon match as well.

533
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:25,654
We believed Choi Jeong-min
singlehandedly murdered

534
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,658
Kim Myeong-ja, Lee Jeong-beom,
and Cho Gwang-hun.

535
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,453
However, we now believe Hwang was at least

536
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,580
an accomplice or a help to the crimes.

537
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,042
We believe Choi's suicide note

538
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:41,087
was first written by Hwang.

539
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,255
The drug found at his house

540
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,299
matched the traces in Ian Chase's body.

541
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,803
And judging by
the information in the journal,

542
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:52,723
there seems to be bad blood
between Hwang and one of the brothers

543
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:56,435
or perhaps both of the brothers.

544
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,485
Thank you for coming.

545
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:06,695
You must be busy.

546
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,999
I'll cut to the chase.

547
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,421
Where is

548
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:25,923
Hwang Jae-sik?

549
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,053
Why would you ask me that?

550
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,683
You know where he is, don't you?

551
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,601
No, I don't.

552
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,728
Let me change my question.

553
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,066
What's your relationship?

554
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,235
I'm his victim.

555
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,279
He stalked you as soon as you got here

556
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,116
then framed you for murder,
yet you don't know why.

557
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,577
Does a victim have to find out the reason?

558
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,830
If you were really his victim,
you would've asked for protection,

559
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,290
not kept your mouth shut.

560
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,294
I refuse to cooperate any longer.

561
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,089
And if you ever find out where he is,

562
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,425
do let me know.

563
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:12,720
Mr. Chase.

564
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,104
What are you trying to hide?

565
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:39,330
While searching the residence of Hwang,

566
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:42,416
the key suspect in the recent murder case,

567
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,128
the police have found new evidence
regarding the three murders

568
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:49,048
Choi confessed to
before committing suicide.

569
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:52,885
The police have remained tight-lipped
regarding the new evidence.

570
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:56,972
However, they believe this crucial lead
will uncover an unknown truth

571
00:41:57,056 --> 00:42:00,684
and will conduct an extensive dragnet

572
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:03,145
in order to locate Hwang who's in hiding.

573
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:16,617
Da-jeong, are you okay?

574
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,245
I am.

575
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:25,000
I hope you're not clenching
your clothes again.

576
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:36,428
I'm not. I'm clenching my phone.

577
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,306
I need to stop by the police station.

578
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,684
Once I'm done, I'll head over.

579
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,353
I'll get there by the time you clock out.

580
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:46,814
Okay.

581
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,734
I'll carry my phone with me at all times.

582
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,654
So if you feel scared or nervous…

583
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:57,283
I'll call you whenever I want.

584
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,161
Please do that.

585
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,665
I even pulled out
the knife from my throat.

586
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,584
I know.

587
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,169
But I still might call you

588
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,880
just to hear your voice.

589
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,883
Okay. Call me anytime.

590
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,767
Choice of adjectives, conjunctions,

591
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,561
and random changes in clauses.

592
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,022
They're written by the same person.

593
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:33,027
Do you think the plot of this book
is based on real-life murder cases?

594
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,280
No. They're from his imagination.

595
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,783
To fit the ending,
he keeps changing character development.

596
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:42,036
But the manuscript was written
to keep a record,

597
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,787
so you can read his mind.

598
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,914
It's written in
both first and third person.

599
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,294
What if the author actually committed

600
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,047
murders in real life and recorded them?

601
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,882
There must've been a trigger.

602
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,594
One phrase is repeated
at least twice per case.

603
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:01,180
"The 18-year-old."

604
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,015
THE 18-YEAR-OLD BOY

605
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,433
PURE MURDER

606
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:06,810
Did you really write that?

607
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:10,939
Prove it.

608
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:15,319
And that 18-year-old kid
was Choi Jeong-min, right?

609
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,739
He provoked Hwang to kill Kim Myeong-ja.

610
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,908
And while investigating that case,

611
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,160
Jeong-beom was killed.

612
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,372
You think so too?

613
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:31,919
Not once in this manuscript
did Hwang mention

614
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:35,923
that Choi had a twin.

615
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,758
In that case…

616
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:41,261
Ian could've been the trigger.

617
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,318
Hello.

618
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,864
Oh, hello.

619
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,038
Did you watch the news?

620
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:11,542
We're tracking
Hwang Jae-sik's whereabouts,

621
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:15,754
so you may often see detectives like me
around here for the time being.

622
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:19,133
Mr. Ko wanted you to know beforehand
so you wouldn't be scared.

623
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,427
Thank you.

624
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:28,350
But why would he show up at our hotel?

625
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:33,939
Because Mr. Chase is staying here
until he moves back to his studio.

626
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,985
Is Dr. Chase

627
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,572
involved in this case?

628
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,950
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty
to answer that.

629
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:54,751
Then…

630
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:00,048
is there a possibility…

631
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,679
that Choi Jeong-min wasn't a bad person?

632
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,766
I'm not talking about
how he lied about his name,

633
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:12,436
but about him committing murder.

634
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:20,569
Well, I'm sure it all depends
on the nature of the crime…

635
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,490
I should get going.

636
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,006
Choi Jeong-min is dead.

637
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:45,093
Why do you still care
how good or bad of a person

638
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,304
he was?

639
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,394
Because if he was evil,

640
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:57,189
I shouldn't cry for him.

641
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:02,110
But if he wasn't…

642
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:04,446
What if he was abandoned,

643
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:08,367
neglected, abused,

644
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,496
and died trying to fight back?

645
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:16,416
Would you still cry for him?

646
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,506
If you mean something evil…

647
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,427
by "fight back," then no.

648
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,436
You lied…

649
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,357
back then, didn't you?

650
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,613
When I asked you about the church,

651
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:51,868
you said you had no recollection.

652
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:56,248
Yes. I remember
both the church and Jeong-min.

653
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,084
Does that make a difference?

654
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,714
I just have many questions.

655
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:10,262
I could pretend like nothing happened.

656
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,055
But…

657
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,351
I realized that it doesn't solve anything.

658
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,770
What do you want to ask?

659
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,617
I FINALLY FOUND YOU

660
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,535
I want to know what he meant

661
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,204
by "I finally found you."

662
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,374
"Why was he looking for me?

663
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:44,046
What did he remember about me?

664
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,715
Did I do something wrong to him?"

665
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:50,802
Is that all?

666
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,062
I'd also like to ask…

667
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,151
if he had anyone he could lean on.

668
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,991
Had there been someone. Just one person…

669
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:22,959
Didn't you want to be
your neighbor's daughter as a kid?

670
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:29,466
Sure, but I have my mom
who risked her life to protect me.

671
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,349
What if he had no one?

672
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:43,271
Then I would've reached out to him…

673
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,901
and said that it wasn't

674
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,613
too late to change his ways.

675
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,502
At that church,

676
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:12,968
there was a boy
who patted you on the head.

677
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:17,180
It must've been a long day.

678
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,476
Why did you touch my head?

679
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,729
And there was also a boy
who got mad at you.

680
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:28,066
It wasn't me who patted you on the head.

681
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,943
Dummy.

682
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,575
You're still a fool.

683
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:43,248
-Hello.
-Hi!

684
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:44,332
Hey!

685
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,877
Since the two shared one name,

686
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,006
if we call one the younger brother
and the other the older brother…

687
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,299
Have you come for me?

688
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,468
I don't know. Mom brought me here.

689
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:55,719
Where is she?

690
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:59,473
So you want us to take in
your other son as well, correct?

691
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,266
Getting married?

692
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:02,976
Trying to start afresh?

693
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:04,770
Is it possible or not?

694
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:08,023
It won't be easy
since he's already registered.

695
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:12,944
Let's send one to the US today
and talk again.

696
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:20,911
I'm not going to the US.
I'm going to run away.

697
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,120
How?

698
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:26,082
I'll hide and run away when it gets dark.

699
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,334
What about me?

700
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,086
You should hide too.

701
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:35,926
Do you know her?

702
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,638
Yes. I saw her earlier.

703
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,224
Her name is Kang Da-jeong.

704
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:46,645
She mistook me for you.

705
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,438
What a dummy.

706
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:53,026
I think she's funny and smart.

707
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,326
My brother who hid under the tree

708
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:46,496
was able to stay in Korea.

709
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,791
And he looked for you for a long time.

710
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,626
And…

711
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:04,431
And the other one…

712
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,642
the older brother,

713
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,687
was sent to the US.

714
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,755
When should we tell my sister?

715
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:24,678
I think we can wait.

716
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:28,181
I'm fine since I rarely see her,
but won't you feel uncomfortable?

717
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:31,434
Probably.

718
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,104
I already do.

719
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,314
Then let's just tell her.
What's stopping us?

720
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:43,863
Should we keep it a secret forever?

721
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:46,533
-Why?
-What if…

722
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,706
-Never mind.
-What if…

723
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,874
we break up?

724
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,045
But shouldn't you

725
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,256
have thought that through

726
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,134
before that night?

727
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:10,682
I've never kept any secrets from her.

728
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:16,312
I often see my customers get drunk
and spill their secrets.

729
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:21,776
Sometimes, it doesn't feel like
a slip of the tongue.

730
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,904
It feels like
they get drunk to let them out.

731
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:29,117
-One time, this man--
-Gosh.

732
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,493
What?

733
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:39,753
What is it?

734
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,839
What? I'm sorry.

735
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,799
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I am.

736
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:46,676
I'm sorry.

737
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:50,722
What was that?

738
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:55,018
I just saw a couple holding hands
in this sweltering weather.

739
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,771
I thought they were Da-jeong and Young-do.

740
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:58,938
They do that?

741
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:01,816
They're no joke.

742
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,360
They're worse than
our lovey-dovey customers.

743
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:08,698
I don't get them.

744
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:14,245
PSYCHIATRIST JU YOUNG-DO

745
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:18,750
Knock, knock.

746
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,837
-Who is it?
-It's me.

747
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,091
How was your day?

748
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,967
-Would you like a drink?
-Sure.

749
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:29,886
Wait here.

750
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,956
You have cool undertones.

751
00:56:58,039 --> 00:56:59,290
It suits you.

752
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,918
Thank you.

753
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,881
I've been curious.

754
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:11,219
What do psychiatrists do
when they struggle?

755
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:13,346
They can't consult themselves.

756
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,141
We visit other doctors.

757
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:19,269
Have you ever done that?

758
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:21,104
-Yes.
-How was it?

759
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,858
Well, it did help.

760
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:29,279
It helped me realize
what kind of doctor I shouldn't become.

761
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:30,947
Why?

762
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:33,116
They gave me a prescription
and kicked me out

763
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:35,076
before I could even talk.

764
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:36,411
Oh, dear.

765
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,497
I understand that diagnosing
your patient is important,

766
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:45,170
but I could feel clearly that
the doctor didn't care about me at all.

767
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:52,010
I guess your patients are so lucky

768
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:55,722
to have met a doctor
who's a great listener.

769
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:58,558
I see.

770
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:04,564
Can I use that?

771
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:06,316
Sure.

772
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:12,572
What is the first thing
you ask your patients?

773
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,994
We call it MSE.

774
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:20,163
It's like a CT scan.

775
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:23,541
I observe and jot things down.

776
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,669
First, I observe their appearance.

777
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:28,838
I see.

778
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:37,805
Like this?

779
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,098
MY TYPE

780
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,060
No.

781
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:43,937
Why not? It's accurate.

782
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,980
It needs to be objective.

783
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:49,526
Cleanliness, clothing, posture,
and things like that.

784
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:03,998
I have a lot more.

785
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,127
All right.

786
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,630
Have them all.

787
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,340
I'll take them all home.

788
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:25,770
-Let's go.
-Okay.

789
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:32,193
Can I ask you something?

790
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:35,488
Sure.

791
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,454
Never mind. It's so random.

792
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:46,457
You can ask me anything.

793
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:56,718
You told me once

794
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:01,639
that I could tell you anything
in your office

795
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,058
and that you'd keep my secrets.

796
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:05,518
And that I could only say

797
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,730
a few words
if it was too hard to talk about it.

798
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:10,773
Right.

799
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,160
That day,

800
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:27,665
when you left me on the rooftop…

801
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,126
Oh, dear.

802
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:34,922
What upset me the most…

803
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:41,596
was that you had done so much for me,

804
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:45,725
but I hadn't been able
to do anything for you.

805
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,860
Perhaps…

806
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,324
you wanted to tell me your story as well.

807
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:33,439
After my brother died,

808
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:39,612
no one comforted me.

809
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:44,534
Honey!

810
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:47,036
I can't let Young-jae die.

811
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,538
Please, honey!

812
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:57,171
Back then, I thought I was to blame.

813
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:00,508
So I understood.

814
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:02,927
That's ridiculous.

815
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:08,891
The only comfort I received was
the candy from my first love.

816
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,534
Had I been there,

817
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:30,288
I would've been enraged.

818
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:35,585
"What on earth are you doing?

819
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,921
How can you call yourself a mom?

820
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,591
He's just a kid.

821
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,343
You know it's not his fault."

822
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:01,569
That's what I would've said.

823
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:07,200
But if you were there now,

824
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:18,085
I think you would be holding her.

825
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:29,597
Because…

826
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:35,186
she may have been younger back then
than you are now.

827
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:40,733
She must've been terrified.

828
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,782
You would probably be telling her…

829
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,666
everything you wanted to believe.

830
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:10,263
Once you've lost someone dear to you,

831
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:13,432
you're willing to believe anything.

832
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:19,856
Things like souls, heaven, reincarnation.
Everything.

833
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:28,239
"Now that they're free from pain,

834
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:32,326
they must be flying anywhere they want.

835
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:38,291
They must be enjoying all the food
they craved down here

836
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,085
and feeling joy.

837
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:47,508
If I pine for them,

838
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:50,887
they may come back as the wind

839
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:54,265
and brush by me."

840
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,283
Mom, look at me.

841
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:56,202
Mom.

842
01:06:35,032 --> 01:06:36,242
I'm sorry.

843
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:39,704
Young-do.

844
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:43,874
I'm so sorry.

845
01:07:13,779 --> 01:07:16,198
THE LATE JUNG MYEONG-HUI

846
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:14,937
"When did you start liking him?"

847
01:11:15,896 --> 01:11:18,190
"Why did you fall so hard for him?"

848
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:24,405
I wonder if I can answer
those questions like this.

849
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:28,534
"Maybe

850
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:33,539
it's been a lot longer than I realize.

851
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:40,421
Maybe it all started
when that trembling wildflower

852
01:11:40,504 --> 01:11:42,047
met a fence

853
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:46,218
and was comforted by a small, round candy.

854
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:51,432
I think that's when…

855
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:56,061
I fell in love with you."

856
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:10,367
I love you.

857
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:28,010
I love you.

858
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:09,760
I love you.

859
01:13:26,443 --> 01:13:27,694
I love you.

860
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:38,330
