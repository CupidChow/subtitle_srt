1
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,772
I can't reach Dr. Chase right now.
Can you…

2
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:48,149
Hold on.

3
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,130
Have you heard

4
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,216
of Nanum Jeil Church in Changbi-dong?

5
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:19,806
This is him?
The one who doesn't even have a name?

6
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,646
Hey, why did you pat me
on the head earlier?

7
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,399
Why did you pat me on the head?

8
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,694
It wasn't me who patted you on the head.

9
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,238
What?

10
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:44,956
Dr. Chase.

11
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,208
Can you hear me, Dr. Chase?

12
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,668
Are you okay?

13
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,087
Open your eyes. Dr. Chase.

14
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:42,889
He assaulted you. You should sue him.

15
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,934
Who are you going to call?

16
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:49,479
The higher-ups. We should have him
kicked out and take a drug test.

17
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,981
He could have dismissed you.

18
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,775
Not "dismissed." "Strangled."

19
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,362
-That's not important right now.
-Yes, it is.

20
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,074
Because if you don't improve your Korean,
you might be dismissed.

21
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,868
You might misunderstand a guest
and serve the wrong dish.

22
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:08,039
Let me make myself clear.
I'm totally against letting this slide.

23
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,207
I heard you.

24
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,668
Calm down now. And get back to work.

25
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,973
EPISODE 7

26
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:44,200
He just came back from hiking.
I ought to eat some food after hiking.

27
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,620
That's so funny. How come
you can't make your shows funny like this?

28
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,416
-How come you can't fly?
-I just don't fly in front of you.

29
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,919
-And I'm keeping my funny show from you.
-Good for you.

30
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,217
Okay.

31
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,679
-Leave.
-What?

32
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,140
So you're heading to Gangneung?

33
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,559
Yes. Are you free?

34
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,270
I'm not sure if I'll be of any help.

35
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,857
Does it have to be me?
What about Ms. Kang?

36
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,525
Ms. Kang?

37
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,236
-Ms. Kang.
-Ms. Kang.

38
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,155
-Fair-skinned Ms. Kang.
-Fair-skinned Ms. Kang.

39
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,032
-She has work in the morning.
-Ms. Kang.

40
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,533
She can come after lunch.

41
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:26,826
All right, then.

42
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,162
I'll go and do whatever I can there.

43
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,042
How's your stomach?

44
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:35,960
It's fine.

45
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,212
But you're still in a bad mood, right?

46
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,215
I feel much better.

47
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,551
Right.

48
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,803
It's hard to be happy in the morning.

49
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,391
Since breaking up with Jun-ho,

50
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,560
you haven't dated anyone?

51
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:56,981
No.

52
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,858
Don't be scared to date.

53
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,402
Not all breakups are as hard as that one.

54
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:06,491
If they were, everyone would look worn out
and wrinkled even before they turned 30.

55
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,831
Is it hard just for me?

56
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,669
Want to hear some exciting news?

57
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,758
You will never be able to
fall in love like that again.

58
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,136
And that's the exciting news?

59
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,138
What's the point of repeating?

60
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,059
Opening your heart
and giving him every piece of you.

61
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,270
That's not the only way to love.

62
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,358
You can avoid puddles
and prevent fires together.

63
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,904
It doesn't have to be suffocating.
It can be nice and comfortable.

64
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,909
You'll get to

65
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,620
experience that soon.

66
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,888
Add an extra shot to the IVL.

67
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,767
Yirgacheffe beans, a lot of whipped cream,
a half pump of syrup, and less ice.

68
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,228
I'll use this voucher.
And stamp my card here.

69
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:21,858
Come again?

70
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:23,985
IVL.

71
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:25,945
"IVL"?

72
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,324
-IVL.
-IVL.

73
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,535
IV… IV?

74
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,872
I'm sorry. Let me confirm your order.

75
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,290
It was an iced vanilla latte.

76
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,916
You chose Yirgacheffe beans.

77
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,794
An extra shot, a lot of whipped cream,
a half pump of syrup,

78
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,004
and less ice. Correct?

79
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,505
-Yes, it is.
-No, it was an IVL.

80
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,007
-An IVL.
-Let me.

81
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,884
-Do the dishes.
-Okay.

82
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,888
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

83
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,139
Next, please.

84
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,560
You're leaving?

85
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,438
I'll go get changed.
And I need to drop this off.

86
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,320
I must. The business is slow as it is.

87
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,698
We should cut down on rent.
You're sleeping over, right?

88
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,660
Hey.

89
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,206
If you closed the curtains,
at least turn on the lights.

90
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,127
What are you doing with your hair?

91
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,547
This is the secret to my silky hair.
Forget about using hot air.

92
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,674
I always dry it with cool air.

93
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,219
By the way,
do you have to turn on all the lights?

94
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:34,138
I feel awkward under the lights
without makeup.

95
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,057
How should I describe this?

96
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,851
"Your skin is so dry.

97
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,394
You look so old today!"

98
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,940
I can hear the lights yelling at me.

99
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,859
Okay.

100
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,322
You haven't eaten yet, right?

101
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,700
Are those dumplings?

102
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,787
How did you know
that I was craving dumplings?

103
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,791
I'm not sure. You only texted me
photos of dumplings four times.

104
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,168
I wonder how I knew that.

105
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,462
I like staying here.

106
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,674
Is it because you work at a fancy hotel?
I might stay here longer.

107
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:16,847
No comment on that?

108
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,599
Is that okay? You'll let me?

109
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,229
Just eat.

110
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,110
I see. You're just ignoring me.

111
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,665
Who are you?

112
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,042
What? Did you call me?

113
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,671
Do you want one?
Although I could eat more.

114
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,434
WARM WATER

115
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,815
What's this?

116
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,359
You want me to fill up on water?

117
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,111
It's warm water.

118
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,405
You dried your hair with cool air.

119
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:15,698
And you just sneezed.

120
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,079
Where are you going? I don't need more.

121
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,623
I rarely eat a lot, you know.

122
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,917
The cafe needs a hand,
so I'm helping them out.

123
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,005
I'm going to be alone again?

124
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,798
I've been alone the whole day.

125
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:43,184
Well, I'm okay. Take your time.

126
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,061
If I get bored,

127
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,773
I can stick my fingers
in the socket and enjoy the shock.

128
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,692
Do you have a mirror?

129
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,944
You should look in the mirror.

130
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,080
Why? I look pretty.

131
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,417
Eat up.

132
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,378
-See you later.
-Okay.

133
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:16,467
She's not going to stay here
only eating dumplings for 15 years, right?

134
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,856
A-ri, do you need anything else?

135
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,358
Since we're not busy now,

136
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,027
can you go through
the packages we got today?

137
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,656
And bring paper cups, straws, and syrup
on your way back and fill them up.

138
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,491
-Okay.
-Fill them up? Okay.

139
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,076
-Let's go.
-Okay.

140
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,245
-Here.
-Okay.

141
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:51,252
Where's the syrup? Where is it?

142
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,839
-Paper cups.
-Right here.

143
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,055
Be careful.

144
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,016
You should cut the tape on the box,
not your fingers.

145
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,147
Can't you see what it says here?

146
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,899
"Those who don't know
what an IVL is must shut up."

147
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,702
-The straws…
-I got it.

148
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,163
What happened there?

149
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:31,750
It's nothing.

150
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,004
That's weird. It wasn't there before.

151
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,590
It takes a while for bruises to show.

152
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,591
Let me take a look.

153
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,726
I was waking up a guest,

154
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,479
but he must've thought
I was attacking him.

155
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,522
He suddenly pushed me.

156
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,486
For a bruise like this,
he must've grabbed and bent it.

157
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,738
Are you okay?

158
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,283
It happened at the hotel.
The floor is carpeted.

159
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,409
You fell on the floor?

160
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,495
What did he do?

161
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,004
Did you report him?

162
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,716
Does your hotel know about this?

163
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,595
I didn't tell them
as it was a minor incident.

164
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,723
I was rushing, so I went in alone.
That's why it happened.

165
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:28,974
It's really nothing.

166
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,311
Nothing? How is this nothing?

167
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,731
He grabbed your wrist
hard enough to leave a bruise,

168
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:38,067
pushed you onto the floor, and choked you.

169
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,151
How is this nothing?

170
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:43,572
If you were shocked and hurt, you
should've seen a doctor or rest at home.

171
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,324
You should have at least told me.

172
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,370
You shouldn't be working here
with that bruise.

173
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:55,793
People might think
I did something wrong to you.

174
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:00,923
Are you acting like this
because you won my wrist the other day?

175
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,883
Because I hurt your wrist?

176
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,885
This isn't the time to make jokes!

177
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,388
Then, why are you getting so mad?
I said I was fine.

178
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,181
You got hurt.

179
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,810
And I'm so pissed off
at that guest I don't even know.

180
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,355
But I have no right to be mad
as we're only neighbors.

181
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,232
And it's weird for me to get mad.

182
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,110
I know that all too well,
so there's nothing I can do.

183
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,821
That makes me feel
so frustrated and stupid.

184
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,865
Happy now?

185
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,426
I didn't mean to slam the door.

186
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,635
It was the wind.

187
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,354
I know.

188
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,567
Wait here. I'll bring some ointment.

189
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,110
I'm fine…

190
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,700
How is it going there?

191
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,535
We just got out of the lunch rush.

192
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,245
How are Young-do and Da-jeong?

193
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,747
I sent them to get the syrup.

194
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,249
But I think they went
to Brazil to get sugar canes.

195
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,500
They are still not back.

196
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,712
I'm quitting today. Right now.

197
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,631
Why? What's going on?

198
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,008
The annoying couple is here.

199
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,052
Hello.

200
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,472
See? That scary lady isn't here.
Or that guy with bomb hair.

201
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,974
Right. Only the pretty girl is here today.

202
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,935
Hello. Is it just you today?

203
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,686
Yes.

204
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,771
Let go.

205
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,357
-What's wrong?
-Go play with her. I'll go.

206
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,817
-No.
-Why did you ask her that?

207
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,487
I was just checking
if that crazy pair was here.

208
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,780
It didn't sound like that.

209
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:51,241
Come on. Don't be like that.
You're the only pretty one here.

210
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,911
Look. They are all ugly. Look at her.

211
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,497
Please? Babe.

212
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,171
I think it's been ten minutes.

213
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,636
You should ice it
for at least the next two days.

214
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,973
I even get bruises from donating blood.

215
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,809
Some people have weak capillaries.

216
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,687
You have thin skin as well.

217
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,064
I'll do it.

218
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,108
You're not a doctor.

219
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,152
Only doctors can apply ointment?

220
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:28,696
Right.

221
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,531
That's news to me.

222
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:52,678
This is odd.

223
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,765
I thought you would
insist on applying it yourself.

224
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,561
That's the power of ointment.

225
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,856
In the movies,

226
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:07,609
no matter how scary the characters look,
when people apply ointment on them,

227
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,571
they let them treat their wounds.

228
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,657
Ma Dong-seok did that in The Outlaws.

229
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,869
So did Hellboy, Dr. Hollow,

230
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,873
Darth Vader, and the Terminator.

231
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,501
Darth Vader and the Terminator
are cyborgs.

232
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,212
They apply it on cyborgs?

233
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,006
They will rust then.

234
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,425
I wasn't just talking about ointment.

235
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,013
Have any friends in liberal arts?

236
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,806
I do. Seung-won…

237
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,309
Let's just say I don't.

238
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,693
Is it because I studied medicine?

239
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,112
This is the only thing I remember.

240
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,198
It's an old line.

241
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,619
"Does it hurt?

242
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,288
It hurts me, too."

243
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,290
Oh, dear.

244
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:12,049
Apply it twice a day
like I did for you just now.

245
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:24,561
I don't like this ointment.
It doesn't seem to apply well.

246
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,522
-Give it back.
-It's mine.

247
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,776
Don't get hurt.

248
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,195
You're broke now

249
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,073
since you lost
all of your savings on a bet.

250
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,117
You should at least be healthy.

251
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,660
Oh, dear.

252
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,580
-Stop copying me.
-Stop copying me.

253
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,082
-So childish.
-So childish.

254
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,960
-Kang Da-jeong is a dummy.
-That's cheating.

255
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,503
That's cheating.

256
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,965
-Young-do's a dummy.
-Young-do's a dummy.

257
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,384
What? That's no fun.

258
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,428
It is true.

259
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,265
-This is no fun.
-This is no fun.

260
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,768
-Gosh. Come on.
-Gosh. Come on.

261
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:06,770
Gosh.

262
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,024
Seventy-two.

263
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,321
That's the combined ages of you two.

264
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,323
This was a good way to learn

265
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,075
age is just a number.

266
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:24,204
I'll come find you
when my perspective of life gets too dark.

267
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,082
Okay. Please do.

268
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,838
Right. If you two are planning

269
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:36,258
to take things farther,
at least lock the door.

270
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,136
I don't want to walk in on you two

271
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,513
all tangled up as one.

272
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,891
No.

273
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,143
Do I want to see that?

274
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,188
What are you imagining?

275
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,648
Stop scanning us like that.

276
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,483
Don't picture it.

277
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,360
You dog…

278
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:58,989
Oh, dear.

279
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,412
Do you think I…

280
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,831
You too, Da-jeong.

281
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,708
So naughty.

282
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,128
What is she picturing right now?

283
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,963
What's wrong with her?

284
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:18,967
No way.

285
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,394
See?

286
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,813
She left after making me
feel like a pervert again.

287
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,874
TO SEOUL

288
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,688
-What about the cafe?
-Young-do and Da-jeong are there.

289
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,649
Don't you miss me?

290
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,984
I miss you so…

291
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,324
Some people don't feel safe
with their feelings.

292
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:10,620
People like that get scared
and do one of these two things

293
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,372
when someone gets too close.

294
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,960
They go into hiding to avoid that person,

295
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,255
or hurt that person
without even realizing it.

296
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:26,845
Then Ga-yeong is doing the former.

297
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:34,936
How can I make her feel safe?

298
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,982
You need to reassure her.

299
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,861
Instead of making her feel
you would die without her,

300
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,197
make her feel you'd be okay.

301
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,993
I'm on my way to the airport

302
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:53,246
for a fan meetup in Thailand.
I'll perform the best I can there.

303
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,379
You forgot this.

304
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,465
Right.

305
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,759
I was scatterbrained because of A-ri.

306
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,764
It's nice and cool here.
Let's have our beer alfresco.

307
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,474
It'll feel like I'm on a trip.

308
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,143
And I can say hello
to the pigeons I befriended yesterday.

309
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:24,444
She locked me up
and only fed me dumplings!

310
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,906
-I bet she didn't tell you.
-You told me not to tell him.

311
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,324
I didn't think you'd listen.

312
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,660
How could you not tell him
just because I asked?

313
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,996
What? This is… The pigeons… Goodness!

314
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:37,791
Ga-yeong…

315
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,751
Ms. Kang…

316
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,339
-Why…
-What's this?

317
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,509
Is that some kind of code between you two?

318
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,767
Why? What? You two…

319
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,853
How is… Gosh.

320
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:06,778
That was easy.

321
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,655
We got rid of him.

322
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,126
Don't just stand there. Come and sit.

323
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,145
Here.

324
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,273
I locked you up here? Did I?

325
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,734
Don't worry.
He doesn't believe what I say anyway.

326
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,410
By the way,
I guess you're not the curious type.

327
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:56,620
No questions for me?

328
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,543
How much longer are you staying here?

329
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:08,131
If I tell you my secret,
will I owe you a bit less?

330
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,886
If it's a secret,
wouldn't it be better not to tell me?

331
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:19,643
Whenever I go to Young-do,
he always scolds me.

332
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,102
"How many sleeping pills?

333
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,520
Are you getting therapy?"

334
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,857
After that, he only tells me four things.

335
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,944
"Good. I'm busy. Go now. Don't come back."

336
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,864
But I still go to him

337
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:37,827
because I want to check if I'm doing okay.

338
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:39,871
And that's because

339
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:44,626
when I wasn't okay, Young-do noticed

340
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,420
and saved me.

341
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:54,552
SEPTEMBER 2015, SEOUL

342
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:57,138
He didn't come
to my drama series wrap party.

343
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,015
So I went to him.

344
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,477
Why would I go to the wrap party?

345
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,396
Ahn Ga-yeong invited you to come.

346
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,939
I can only go if you go.

347
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,358
This is my only chance to meet her.

348
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:27,335
THOUSAND WON

349
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,461
Answer it.

350
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,047
I don't answer his calls.

351
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:42,100
"What a fine day. Not too hot."

352
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,979
"A fine day to hang oneself."

353
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,776
They are lines

354
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,155
from Uncle Vanya,
a play I did when I was in school.

355
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:56,865
Okay.

356
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,075
They just popped into my head

357
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,202
since it's raining.

358
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,623
I don't want to be
an actress in my next life.

359
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,834
What makes you say that?

360
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,712
My life is already a play.

361
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:14,674
It's ridiculous
I still act in front of the cameras.

362
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,558
You'll bring my coffee too, right?

363
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,354
-Of course.
-Thank you

364
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,231
for everything.

365
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:34,944
Excuse me.

366
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,515
MANAGER YEONG-BIN

367
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,064
What's wrong with her today?

368
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:15,902
She left her wallet, watch,
and key card to her apartment in the van.

369
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,029
She can't get in without this key card.

370
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,453
"A fine day to hang oneself."

371
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,081
Thank you for everything.

372
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,387
Get out.

373
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,641
What are you doing?

374
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:47,767
Get out of the car.

375
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,398
-Can't you just talk there?
-No, I can't.

376
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,442
Get out now.

377
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,694
What are you doing?

378
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,116
What is this?
Why are you getting in my car?

379
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:05,952
That's…

380
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,549
-What's this?
-I have a prescription for them.

381
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:20,884
You saved them up.

382
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,262
No doctors would prescribe
this much zolpidem.

383
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,890
Give them back. It's not your concern.

384
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,183
Yes, it is.

385
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,644
You came here to ask for help.

386
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,690
Who told you that?
Who said I came here to get help?

387
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:48,745
What are you doing?

388
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:50,747
Have you gone mad?

389
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,500
How could you dump them out?

390
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,523
Why should you die?

391
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,983
Don't die. You can live.

392
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,653
Let go of me. Let me go.

393
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:25,824
You can get better.

394
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,327
It's hard to believe it,
but you will be okay.

395
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,746
Let go. Let go of me!

396
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,559
You don't know how tough it is for me.

397
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,395
Tomorrow will be no different.

398
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,522
And the day after tomorrow, too.

399
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:00,692
Why are you telling me to keep going?

400
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,782
Please just let me die.

401
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,745
Let me die.

402
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,915
Please let me go!

403
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,351
Help me.

404
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,021
Help…

405
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,899
Help me.

406
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,943
Please.

407
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,988
Please help me.

408
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,824
You will be okay.

409
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,493
I'll help you.

410
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,880
I wanted to live,

411
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:08,176
and Young-do wanted me to live.
So we got married.

412
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,055
Others get a divorce
because their marriages fail,

413
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,223
but we got a divorce because it worked.

414
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,685
I got much better only after a year.

415
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,272
So you must be very grateful to me.

416
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,279
I got better after
going through the treatment

417
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,406
and set him free as a single guy again.

418
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,913
If you have any more questions, just ask.

419
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:40,792
Questions like…
"Did Young-do have feelings for you?"

420
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,920
"Did you have feelings for him?"
Something like that.

421
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,675
To answer that question,
I did develop feelings for him.

422
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,345
But he said that it wasn't the case

423
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,973
and that I was dependent on him
and it was some syndrome.

424
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,141
He made sure I didn't cross the line.

425
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:01,437
Any more questions?
How we divide our assets? Or alimony?

426
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,983
Well, ask me anything.

427
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:06,943
Are you

428
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,362
okay now?

429
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,366
Are you not hurting anymore?

430
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,418
It must have been really hard on you.

431
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,798
And I hope…

432
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,636
things will be a bit easier on you.

433
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,660
"It must've been really hard on you.

434
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:03,332
I hope that there won't be any more pain."

435
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:09,589
It means although they couldn't
embrace your pain,

436
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:14,844
they want to give you a warm hug
for overcoming those painful days.

437
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:19,348
It's the most comforting thing to hear.

438
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,745
-Yes?
-Hello.

439
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:43,247
I got your number
from Mr. Cheon Seung-won.

440
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,375
-We'll be launching a new show.
-I already turned that down.

441
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,627
Really?

442
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,171
Then is Mr. Seo Ha-neul not
joining the show either?

443
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,131
-Who?
-The veterinarian.

444
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,926
He said he knew you.

445
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,513
He's going to be on the show?

446
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,306
Ha-neul. Seo Ha-neul!

447
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,975
-Hey.
-It's you, right?

448
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,685
-It's been a while.
-Gosh.

449
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,687
-A wedding is a nice way to catch up.
-Yes.

450
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,439
-How have you been?
-It's the same.

451
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,275
-You've gotten handsome.
-Well, I've always been handsome.

452
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,612
OCTOBER 2015, GRAND HYATT HOTEL

453
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,781
So even Ahn Ga-yeong is getting married.

454
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,574
The groom must be crazy.

455
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,576
-I see a bumpy road ahead.
-He's a shrink.

456
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,371
At least, she's hot with a rocking body.

457
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,956
He can be her shrink now.

458
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,958
I heard she often loses it.

459
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,043
What a match.

460
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,713
Are you that jealous?

461
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,634
Are you annoyed that you're jealous?

462
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,804
Then, cry. Crying is
nothing to be embarrassed about.

463
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:43,558
What's embarrassing is to badmouth people
just to feel better about yourselves.

464
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,978
You must be upset to look like that

465
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,729
when they're good-looking.

466
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,650
You're lonely because no one likes you

467
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,735
when they are so loved.

468
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,823
Bored? Because
all you can do is badmouth them?

469
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:01,450
But that doesn't mean
you can shit with your words.

470
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,244
Weren't you potty-trained?

471
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,620
Who the heck are you?

472
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,456
I am

473
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,085
Young-do's great-grandmother.

474
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,087
Grandmother?

475
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,007
I'm a ghost only visible to those

476
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:21,220
with prejudices that pretty women and
rich men are the best marriage material.

477
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,473
Let's just go.

478
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,726
-The food here is good.
-Get the meal tickets.

479
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,403
Do you have a lint remover here?

480
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,488
No. But I have scissors.

481
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,831
Scissors.

482
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,877
Okay. Get back to work. Don't mind me.

483
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:55,254
Where's the coffee machine?

484
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,257
At the first-floor cafe.

485
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,593
-You don't have one here?
-No.

486
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,560
Okay. Get back to work. Don't mind me.

487
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,647
You're video calling me this time.

488
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,025
-I can have this, right?
-You can eat anything…

489
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,152
No. Not that.

490
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:20,780
You scared me.

491
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,450
You can eat anything else,
but not that. That cookie…

492
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:26,786
What?

493
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:29,622
Is it like a pet?
Do you have to water it and feed it?

494
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,415
It's just a cookie.

495
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,960
Young-do gives them out for free at his…

496
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,007
I see.

497
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,010
There's chocolate in the freezer.

498
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:47,223
We sell them at the hotel.
It's really good chocolate.

499
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:50,017
I also have eggs and cup noodles.

500
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,060
Since you have two,

501
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,229
I'll only eat one. That's okay, right?

502
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:54,272
No.

503
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,107
Hey. Hey!

504
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,484
Hey. No.

505
00:37:58,567 --> 00:37:59,735
Ta-da.

506
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,991
I should buy some sweets
when I go down to buy coffee.

507
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:07,743
Don't mind me. Get back to work.

508
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,412
Bye.

509
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,624
Darn it.

510
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,253
So you're like that toy figure.

511
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:20,214
I have more useful hostages now.

512
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,051
BOOM, CLAP (WORKING TITLE)

513
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,597
You guys know each other, right?

514
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,808
Yes. Have you been well?

515
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:31,809
Hi.

516
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,771
But I don't remember him that well.

517
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,316
His name sounded
like a beach in the East Sea.

518
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,486
Right. It might sound like that.

519
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:46,532
I'm West Sky, Seo Ha-neul.

520
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:48,576
Hi.

521
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:51,537
Excuse me.

522
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,882
Have you been well?

523
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:04,967
Yes.

524
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,138
I remember that you run a gym.

525
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:12,099
-I do.
-I really need to work out.

526
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,769
-You should stop by.
-Pardon?

527
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,522
Sure. I'll stop by sometime.

528
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:20,483
When?

529
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:21,942
Pardon?

530
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,986
When will you stop by?

531
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,197
You must exercise.
If you don't, you'll die.

532
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,283
Yes. Right.

533
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,619
Gosh. I can't die.

534
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,121
Sometime--

535
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,665
When are you free? How about next week?

536
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,308
Late-night snacks much?

537
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,185
You can see that?

538
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,396
I can see dumplings right under your chin.

539
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,855
Two dumplings at that.

540
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:04,193
You've skipped four sessions
and been MIA for two days.

541
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,823
-And your muscles are MIA too.
-That bad?

542
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,951
Is your brain MIA too?

543
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,077
You went running

544
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,704
to your ex when you had
a problem with your boyfriend?

545
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:18,624
I was on the fourth floor,
not the third floor.

546
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,836
-Who's on the fourth floor?
-My friend.

547
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,257
As if. Why don't you just tell me
that you found a phoenix nest

548
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,342
or that unicorns exist?

549
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,301
I'm serious.

550
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:32,179
Her name is Kang Da-jeong.
She and Young-do like each other.

551
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,556
And she's my friend.

552
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,392
We can be the three musketeers.

553
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,145
What kind of nonsense is this?

554
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,981
Does she know that you're her friend now?

555
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,569
Well, if she doesn't, I can just tell her.

556
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,950
I'll give you five minutes.
Go upstairs and get your things.

557
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:55,411
Okay.

558
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:02,293
Hurry up. Run. Now!

559
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,133
Where's Ms. Kang Da-jeong?

560
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,594
She stepped out for a moment.

561
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,971
May I ask what this is about?

562
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,514
I want to talk to her in person.

563
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:20,352
If you leave a message,
I'll make sure she gets it.

564
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,202
Read it now. Come on. Hurry.

565
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,453
-Read it now.
-What is it?

566
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,289
Can I read it too?

567
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:47,463
"Please call me. From Ian Chase."

568
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:50,299
He took that long to write just one line?

569
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:54,136
-How long?
-For about 15 to 20 minutes.

570
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,514
There's nothing on the back?

571
00:41:58,265 --> 00:41:59,892
Something doesn't feel right.

572
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:05,022
Why "Ian Chase," instead of "Dr. Chase"?
We're not on a first-name basis with him.

573
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:08,234
That's where we need to start deducing.

574
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:24,500
Hello. This is Kang Da-jeong,
the concierge manager.

575
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,336
Did I hurt you that day?

576
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,422
You don't need to worry.

577
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,509
It bothers me
that you're telling me not to worry.

578
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,512
It also sounds like you were hurt badly.

579
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:41,225
The bruise was only minor.

580
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,727
A good doctor treated me.

581
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,146
I want to formally apologize.

582
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,399
I know it wasn't intentional.

583
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,863
You had a nightmare, didn't you?

584
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:58,450
Yes.

585
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,786
Then, I know how that feels.

586
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,581
You get disoriented when you wake up.

587
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:09,503
Do you also have nightmares?

588
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:14,174
I had a lot of them when I was young.

589
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,398
Well, it wasn't serious.

590
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:33,152
In my dream,
I went to the house next to my home.

591
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,738
But I was back at my home.

592
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:39,283
So I would come out,
but I was back at my home again.

593
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,702
When I woke up, I was still there.

594
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,538
Well, it was something like that.

595
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,458
How is that a nightmare?

596
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:53,797
Back then,

597
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,676
I wanted to be
my next door neighbors' family.

598
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,390
That was way too personal.

599
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,727
I tend to feel uncomfortable in silence

600
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,313
although I can handle it better now.

601
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,652
I felt uncomfortable that you saw the part

602
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,445
I don't want anyone to see.

603
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:20,074
But your story made me feel better.

604
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,785
Thank you

605
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,746
for making me less embarrassed.

606
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:31,418
If it's okay with you,
I would like to buy you dinner.

607
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,505
Thank you, but it's okay.

608
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,966
Sorry for making you feel uncomfortable.

609
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,636
That won't happen again.

610
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,846
Okay.

611
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,350
It wasn't that bad, though.

612
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,730
I'll let you go. I know you're busy.

613
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,902
I hope you have a nice dream today.

614
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:16,755
DECEMBER 1992

615
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,386
Wake up. Come on.

616
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:31,812
Open your mouth.

617
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,649
It's strawberry flavor. You like this.

618
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:38,110
That's cold medicine.

619
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:41,989
He likes it. Not me.

620
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,033
Just drink it.

621
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:48,871
One more.

622
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,285
Hey, come here.

623
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:29,953
Come here.

624
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,750
Hurry up!

625
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,920
Don't look at him. Just keep on eating.

626
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:41,298
Where am I?

627
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,800
Where's my younger brother?

628
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,260
Where's my mother?

629
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:49,431
This is him?
The one who doesn't even have a name?

630
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:52,476
My name is Choi Jeong-min.

631
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,353
That's your brother's name.

632
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,022
Both of our names are Choi Jeong-min.

633
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:57,981
You brat.

634
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:02,528
You might share a spoon or a toothbrush,
but you don't share a name.

635
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:04,780
But we have the same name.

636
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:06,657
And you don't share toothbrushes.

637
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:12,120
Gosh. She must've only registered
the birth of one of the boys.

638
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,914
Get back to work. Stop being nosy.

639
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,499
Come on.

640
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:16,959
But look at him.

641
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,546
Look at the sparkle in his eyes.

642
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,131
Hey. You'll sell well.

643
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:26,301
Twins would have made a better sale.

644
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:29,388
So one of them is leaving today.

645
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,671
Everyone gets their own name.

646
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:05,674
Choi Jeong-min is your brother.
And you don't have a name.

647
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:08,719
But my brother and I are
both Choi Jeong-min.

648
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,846
And he's not even your brother now.

649
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:12,889
I want to call my mom.

650
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,601
And she's not even your mother now.

651
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,186
What do you mean?

652
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,855
Do what I say

653
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,648
and stay here like a good boy.

654
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,650
And if the clients like you,

655
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,153
then you can get a new mom too.

656
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:37,581
Come here.

657
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:40,459
I want more.

658
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,670
You're tiny. You don't need more.

659
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:45,172
Go.

660
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:46,965
Higher.

661
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:51,386
Here. Come. Come closer.

662
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,860
VICTIM: KIM MYEONG-JA

663
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,864
From here,
it's Detective Park's point of view.

664
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,451
But when he goes outside,

665
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,705
he looks back at where he stood
from the other side.

666
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:24,419
And from here, he moves away
from Detective Park.

667
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:28,965
So you're saying that Chase already knew

668
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,093
that someone else was following him.

669
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,137
But he never told us that.

670
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,223
Sir, I think this is the package

671
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,934
from Kim Myeong-ja's husband.
The one he promised you.

672
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,117
I never imagined this would show up here.

673
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:58,870
While I was looking into
Choi Jeong-min's suicide note,

674
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:00,872
I called Ms. Kim's husband.

675
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:04,376
He said another detective
came and asked about this.

676
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:07,796
His description matched Jeong-beom,
so I met up with him.

677
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:20,308
That's me.

678
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,814
What are you talking about?

679
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:29,943
NANUM JEIL PRAYER HOUSE

680
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,238
Everyone, smile.

681
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:35,323
-Smile.
-Let's take the photo.

682
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,533
-Closer
-Raise it high.

683
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:39,578
Hey, I told you to smile.
Show him some smile, for God's sake.

684
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:41,371
Don't you dare glare at me.

685
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:44,624
Come on. Stand closer. Yes.

686
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,545
Hey, you! You should be in the photo, too.

687
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:49,963
-Not him.
-Why not?

688
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:52,632
The more kids, the better it'll look.

689
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:54,801
Hey, you come here.

690
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:56,928
Run.

691
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:01,975
I'll take it now.

692

NANUM JEIL PRAYER HOUSE

693
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:27,834
Your dad won't return.

694
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,086
-You were abandoned, too.
-No.

695
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,671
How do you know that?

696
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:34,132
I can tell when he's lying to me.

697
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:37,469
My dad will come back for me.
He said he would.

698
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,262
I'm Ju Young-do.

699
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,181
What's your name?

700
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,808
I don't need a stupid name.

NANUM JEIL PRAYER HOUSE

702
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:53,276
-Have you been well, Dad?
-Yes.

703
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,528
I have been well.

704
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:18,385
Here's your food.

705
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,237
In his suicide note,

706
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,323
there was no motive
for killing Kim Myeong-ja.

707
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:43,243
Right. That's why
we thought it was a thrill kill.

708
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,202
If

709
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,746
this guy was Choi Jeong-min,

710
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,373
that could explain his motive.

711
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:51,626
I see. Because he was abused?
Something like that?

712
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:55,714
They were keeping the kids there
to sell them.

713
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:57,424
I doubt the kids were treated well.

714
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,217
And you thought it was a shady place.

715
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:02,804
But my memory is too old and blurry
to be a reliable source.

716
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:07,726
And if it's certain that
they were involved in illegal adoption,

717
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,312
it's more likely that this guy is

718
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:12,564
Ian Chase, not Choi Jeong-min.

719
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:14,482
If that's the case,

720
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,651
Choi's confession will be challenged.

721
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,236
Maybe he committed the murder

722
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:19,905
for his older brother?

723
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:23,325
It'd only make sense if Choi Jeong-min

724
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:26,536
and Ian Chase were
in touch for all those years.

725
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,289
But I didn't find any US numbers
in Choi's phone.

726
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,960
But how will we find out
whether the kid is Ian Chase or Choi?

727
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:36,713
You should get some rest.

728
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:40,467
-Are you done with your meal?
-Yes.

729
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:42,302
Let me take that for you.

730
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,681
-I should get going.
-Gosh. That went by quickly.

731
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:49,392
-Sorry you couldn't have lunch.
-I'll get something to eat.

732
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:51,227
-Get some rest.
-Okay.

733
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,529
It's been so long since we ate out.

734
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,573
I'm dying for that spicy tteokbokki.

735
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,659
We ate out yesterday too.

736
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:09,746
What does she eat
to keep her skin smooth like that?

737
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:12,499
Dumplings?

738
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,084
Does she only drink water?

739
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:17,003
She probably eats them with every sip.

740
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,797
Let's hurry, or we'll have to wait.

741
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,591
-Run.
-Okay. Run.

742
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,597
All right. Let's go
get your spicy tteokbokki.

743
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:28,723
Thank you.

744
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,604
TTEOKBOKKI

745
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,731
Two servings of Hell level, please.

746
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:38,817
Okay. Two Fiery Hells here.

747
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,407
FIERY HELL TTEOKBOKKI

748
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,705
Do you not have a tongue?

749
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:54,165
Or are your tastebuds dead or something?

750
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:55,959
No way.

751
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:58,670
I've had the bitter taste of life
countless times.

752
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:00,505
Shall we go?

753
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:07,178
-We'd like to pay now.
-Your tab was already paid.

754
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,264
Ours? Who did that?

755
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:11,599
The guy who ate alone here.

756
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:14,227
He ordered it
when he couldn't even eat spicy food.

757
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:17,522
He didn't even touch it. What a waste.

758
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:22,110
Here.

759
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,077
Let's go.

760
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:35,290
GRAND HYATT

761
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,633
Goodbye.

762
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,392
How was lunch?

763
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:57,062
Wasn't that Dr. Chase?

764
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:58,772
Yes. He checked out today.

765
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,066
All of a sudden?

766
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:04,152
You weren't informed
about this, either. Right?

767
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:05,862
No, not at all.

768
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:08,615
Do you think
it's because of what he did to you?

769
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:10,325
Because he's embarrassed?

770
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:12,952
Don't talk about our guest like that.

771
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,873
But at least, you won't be choked again.

772
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:24,130
MEDICAL COOPERATION CENTER

773
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:35,475
Thanks to you,
I was able to see the snow the other day.

774
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:38,978
It was beautiful, and I was so grateful.

775
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,732
But it's getting too hard for me.

776
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:48,530
I'm sorry I won't be able to keep
my promise to come see you.

777
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,783
The caller is not available right now.

778
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:31,614
The caller is not available right now.

779
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,075
I know you're home.

780
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,579
I'll be in front of your house.
Come out when you're ready.

781
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,553
Why are you so late?

782
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,934
Why are you here again?

783
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:43,895
I've been editing nonstop. I need a break.

784
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,731
But my house is too far.

785
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,150
I told you to move.

786
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:56,991
Hey, Young-do.

787
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:00,912
What's wrong with your face?

788
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:04,374
What's wrong with your face?

789
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,301
You have a fever.

790
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,141
Don't move.

791
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:24,852
Thirty-nine?

792
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:27,230
Let's go to the hospital. Young-do.

793
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,484
The chest X-ray showed an infiltration.

794
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,070
I used third-generation cephalosporins
and quinolones.

795
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:37,490
But your creatinine level went up,
so I adjusted the cyclosporine level.

796
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:38,533
So sit tight.

797
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:39,909
-Okay.
-Well,

798
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,869
can you put that in layman's terms?

799
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:46,082
"You have nothing to worry about.
I washed your blood with antibiotics."

800
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,211
I heard you're not coming back here.

801
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:53,047
Cut down on your outpatients.
Take care of yourself first.

802
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:54,716
Will do.

803
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,135
Thank you.

804
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:03,057
You should go too.

805
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:06,227
-No.
-Just go.

806
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:07,812
If I leave, Ha-neul will do this.

807
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:09,939
"Young-do. Gosh, Young-do."

808
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:12,358
He'll cry like this.
You still want me to go?

809
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,239
You should stay.

810
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:20,783
CLOSED UNTIL THURSDAY
DUE TO DR. JU'S PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES

811
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,327
Good evening.

812
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:26,456
Well, I can't say that it is
a good evening as you can see here.

813
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:32,170
Did something happen to Mr. Ju?

814
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,677
Do you drink?

815
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:44,557
Just a little.
I enjoy one or two cans of beer.

816
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,352
How good are you at handling emergencies?

817
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:50,480
Number one, good.
Number two, average, Number three, bad.

818
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:52,649
Number one.

819
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:54,651
I take such courses
regularly at the hotel.

820
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:57,028
What do your friends say about you?
One, a nutcase.

821
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:58,821
Two, a smart girl.

822
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,948
Three. You don't have any friends.

823
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,538
If I have to choose,
I would say I'm close to number two.

824
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:10,249
But I still have to ask
my friends about that.

825
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,795
My last question.
What do you think about Ju Young-do?

826
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:15,630
One. You really like him.

827
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:19,300
Two. You want to hit him.
Three. You don't care about him.

828
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:25,473
The choices are too extreme.

829
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:34,482
If I have to choose,
it would be number one.

830
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:37,944
We are neighbors. And he helped me a lot.

831
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:41,906
And my mom really likes him.

832
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:44,867
Mr. Ju is a nice person.

833
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,412
And it's not like I love him or anything.

834
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:48,705
He's a good person.

835
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,289
He was in the hospital.

836
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,417
He got antibiotics and got discharged.

837
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,920
And he should be between
sleeping or waking up at home.

838
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:59,048
It's the perfect time
to ask him how he's doing.

839
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,191
Yes, Ms. Kang.

840
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:18,985
Isn't this so unfair?

841
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:21,946
What's wrong?

842
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,658
You know everything about me.

843
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:29,078
You've been to my house.

844
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,122
And you're close to my mom.

845
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:32,957
You know how I grew up.

846
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,501
And you even figured out
what I didn't tell you.

847
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:39,630
You bought me soup,

848
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:43,134
came to Gangneung with me, and
did crazy things with me on a snowy day.

849
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:46,554
When you hear my footsteps,

850
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:49,307
you know that I'm home.

851
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:52,935
And if I step on a bar of soap
and fall with a big thud,

852
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:58,608
you would be the first to rush
to the rooftop to check if I was okay.

853
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:04,489
But why can't I do anything for you?

854
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:08,451
You scolded me for the bruise on my wrist.

855
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:11,579
But you didn't tell me when you got sick.

856
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:14,665
You were even hospitalized.

857
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:19,128
Right now,

858
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:23,007
I have no idea if you are alone

859
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:25,593
or with someone.

860
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:30,932
I don't know if you had porridge

861
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,726
or took any medicine at all.

862
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,359
Are you listening?

863
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,656
I'm asking if you are still sick.

864
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:48,407
Ms. Kang.

865
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:50,993
Then,

866
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,831
can you come here right now?

867
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,236
It's porridge.

868
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:28,406
What?

869
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:30,700
It's sludge?

870
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:34,996
Come on in.

871
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,349
What happened?

872
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:58,603
I just had a fever.

873
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:02,607
No adults get hospitalized over a fever.

874
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:04,734
I do.

875
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:11,616
You're very upset.

876
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:21,626
To make it fair,
I guess I should tell you about me.

877
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:23,377
Where should I start?

878
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:25,546
Should I start with my family?

879
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,466
It doesn't have to be today.

880
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,095
You're not well.
It must be tiring to talk.

881
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:35,598
No.

882
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:38,476
I think I need to.

883
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:46,901
As for my family,

884
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:50,905
I only have my dad. That's it.

885
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:53,991
We talk on the phone every weekend.

886
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:58,287
Our phone calls don't last long.
They last about 47 seconds.

887
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:00,831
"You're doing well, right?"

888
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:04,043
"Yes. What about you?" "Same."

889
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:13,219
I could tell when people lied
even when I was young

890
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:16,514
because everyone around me kept lying.

891
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:19,976
The nurse told me

892
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:24,105
it didn't hurt
when she was giving my brother a shot.

893
01:06:25,022 --> 01:06:28,442
The doctor told my brother
he would get better

894
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:30,236
as long as he ate his meals.

895
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:32,363
And my father told me

896
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:35,741
I didn't have to donate my kidney

897
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:38,244
to help my brother live.

898
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,960
And I chose to be a psychiatrist because…

899
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:47,837
When I was an intern,

900
01:06:48,462 --> 01:06:51,966
a mom brought her baby to the ER
because the baby was coughing.

901
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:56,262
But when they arrived,
the baby had stopped breathing.

902
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:00,975
And it was my first time…

903
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:05,563
to pronounce someone dead.

904
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:10,943
Back then, I couldn't even look at her
because I was crying my eyes out.

905
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:16,365
A few days later,

906
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:19,660
we got a patient who had taken poison.

907
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:23,080
It was the baby's mother.

908
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:29,003
If I had just told her,

909
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:33,591
"Ma'am.

910
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:37,344
It's not your fault."

911
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:46,645
I couldn't save my brother
or that baby's mother.

912
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:49,815
But when I was sick, someone saved me.

913
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:53,694
Someone donated a heart to me.

914
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:09,418
That's why you don't run…

915
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:13,255
or drink.

916
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:17,802
That's why you must

917
01:08:20,137 --> 01:08:22,389
do your best to live as long as you can.

918
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:30,439
The survival rate for
heart transplant recipients after a decade

919
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:32,900
is about 50 percent.

920
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:36,278
But the rate would go up

921
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,699
for lucky people like me who received
a good heart and had a great doctor

922
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,326
to perform the surgery.

923
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:48,666
I'm telling you all this because…

924
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:59,635
Because I've come to like you.

925
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:13,649
When you like someone,

926
01:09:13,732 --> 01:09:16,235
you make promises you can't keep.

927
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:18,779
"Let's be together forever."

928
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:22,116
"I'll always be by your side."

929
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:27,663
But

930
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:31,000
I…

931
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,265
So I was wondering…

932
01:10:03,657 --> 01:10:05,201
How about we be friends?

933
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:40,921
All relationships come to an end.

934
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,967
For the lucky ones,
they end with marriage.

935
01:11:46,593 --> 01:11:49,638
If not, with breakups.

936
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:56,228
But for some people, they end
as soon as their feelings are professed.

937
01:11:57,229 --> 01:11:59,023
These feelings in their hearts

938
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:02,526
can't be shared or removed now.

939
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:05,612
And a good word like "friend"

940
01:12:06,196 --> 01:12:08,282
becomes the saddest word.

941
01:12:14,621 --> 01:12:19,626
For some people,
that's how their relationships end.

942
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:43,729
Is he my daughter's boyfriend
or her guy friend?

943
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:46,732
Why does everyone want
to be friends with me?

944
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,775
Am I a friend bot or something?

945
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:52,070
I shouldn't change it
since I want him to come here.

946
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:55,699
He might've failed
to realize his true feelings.

947
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,785
I've also come to like you.

948
01:14:59,703 --> 01:15:02,039
I won't say that.

949
01:15:02,122 --> 01:15:06,001
He just wants to be by her side.

950
01:15:06,084 --> 01:15:08,128
Is it crazy to like someone

951
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:10,464
if you can't promise
to be with them forever?

952
01:15:10,547 --> 01:15:15,385
