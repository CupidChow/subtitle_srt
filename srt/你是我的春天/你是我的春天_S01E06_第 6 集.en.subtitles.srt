1
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,512
Right?

2
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,181
Does it have to bloom at the same pace
as the others?

3
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,684
It can feel tingly and excited.
It's understandable. Right?

4
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:46,356
I think that's what snow is about.

5
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,108
It excuses our crazy behaviors.

6
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,034
What crazy things

7
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,537
do you want to do?

8
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,333
It's snowing.

9
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,017
Are the crazy magnolias

10
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:07,979
still there?

11
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,695
EPISODE 6

12
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,369
No way.

13
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,256
You climbed these stairs to school
every day?

14
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,009
No. I took the front gate.

15
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,385
This is too tiring.

16
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,555
Then why are we using the stairs?

17
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,807
Because this seems crazier.

18
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,434
No way.

19
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:49,938
How about something really crazy?
Let's play rock, paper, scissors--

20
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,147
No.

21
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,608
That's too cheesy.

22
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,070
The loser gets pushed down the stairs.

23
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:58,738
Oh, dear.

24
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,743
No?

25
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:17,882
So you guys are the crazy magnolias.

26
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,760
That's not how you greet them.

27
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:22,929
We have our own rule.

28
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,723
We learned it on our first day of school.

29
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,684
First, do this.

30
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,147
Then spin around once.

31
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,195
Smile and say hi.

32
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,822
Hi.

33
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,324
Rest your face on your palms.

34
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:46,703
Lift your left leg.

35
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,247
Hop three times.

36
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:50,665
What?

37
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:57,005
Do you want a photo?
You guys looked good together.

38
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:00,800
You might as well put a flower in my hair
and call me crazy.

39
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,010
Should I?

40
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,137
But a magnolia is too big.

41
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,766
Here.

42
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,063
Did you hear that?

43
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,857
Did the forsythia say something?

44
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,609
"Young-do.

45
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,988
Are you still a big flirt?"

46
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,157
That's what

47
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,659
they said.

48
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,032
There was snow on your hair.

49
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,159
Why are you smiling?

50
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,997
It's just that the back of your head
looks so pretty.

51
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,421
Thanks.

52
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,591
I'll greet you with the back of my head
from now on.

53
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,093
Sure.

54
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,271
Now that I think of it,

55
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,942
that magnolia tree must know
how you looked when you were 20.

56
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,612
It probably didn't recognize me.

57
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,864
I was a habitual drunk back then.

58
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,827
I don't think I ever saw you drink.

59
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,288
I've been sober for a few years.

60
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,125
-Not even one sip?
-No.

61
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,210
Why?

62
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,588
I mean, it's not wrong to stay sober, but…

63
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,887
Because I need to do my utmost best
to live as long as I can.

64
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,531
I was being ridiculous,

65
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,826
but I can't believe this was
the crazy thing you wanted to do.

66
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,161
This is crazy enough.

67
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,540
I have to go to work tomorrow,

68
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,960
but due to some strange closeness
I feel toward you,

69
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:45,339
I came all the way here at this hour
just to see a single tree.

70
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:48,843
I guess.

71
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,513
You jerk!

72
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,724
Give me my shoe back!

73
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,350
You're dead meat!

74
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,187
-"Give me my shoe back!"
-Stop!

75
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,980
Give me my shoe back!

76
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,023
Hey!

77
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,942
Oh, dear.

78
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,365
When I was at their age,

79
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,744
I thought I'd become a true adult
once I turned 30.

80
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,704
Adult?

81
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,539
Yes.

82
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,710
Doing something stupid on Monday,

83
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,670
doing something foolish on Tuesday,

84
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,756
wasting time on Wednesday,

85
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,509
and doing something crazy on Thursday.

86
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,678
That's not being an adult.

87
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,223
I bet it is.

88
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,353
Do you think being an all-around loser
is what an adult is?

89
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:47,026
You now think it's crazy to do something
that you did for fun back in the day.

90
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:51,155
You did what you liked back then,
but you think it's foolish now.

91
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,700
So when you want to do
something really crazy,

92
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,580
this is all you can do.

93
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,377
Gosh, you make me want to prove you wrong.

94
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:09,507
I really want to show you that I can
still do crazy things at my age.

95
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,777
DUDU HANBOK

96
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,530
You can put your clothes here.

97
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,449
We close at 10 p.m. sharp,

98
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,411
so please return your costumes
ten minutes before closing.

99
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,414
Hurry up.

100
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,681
How far are we walking?

101
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,474
Let's go back and change.

102
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,268
-Are you not having fun?
-No.

103
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,811
Why not?

104
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,939
Because I'm completely sober,

105
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,526
and these people can see me.

106
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,570
We decided to do something crazy.

107
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,530
But it stopped snowing.

108
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,450
I think you're secretly enjoying this.

109
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,577
How so?

110
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,833
What?

111
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,377
I'm really not having any fun.

112
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,050
Someone said those who are lying

113
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,219
look you in the eye
to see if you believe them.

114
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,018
So this is why they say those who
have read only one book are terrifying.

115
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,771
And you're the one who wrote
and lent me that book.

116
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,726
Is there something going on?

117
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,563
-Sorry?
-No, there isn't.

118
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:38,823
Are you satisfied?

119
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,283
Shall we go home?

120
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,953
What time is it?

121
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,210
Oh, no!

122
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,170
Gosh!

123
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:14,525
DUDU HANBOK

124
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,327
LOOKING FOR AVAILABLE TAXIS
DESTINATION: GUGU BUILDING

125
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,204
-Still no?
-No.

126
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,291
Gosh.

127
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,211
That means there aren't any around here.

128
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,715
We should take the bus
before it's too late.

129
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,718
Let's say our goodbyes here.

130
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:42,928
What?

131
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:46,056
We need to save ourselves.

132
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,226
They stare at us even more
because we're together.

133
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,645
Goodbye, then.

134
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,148
Wait. Come on, now.

135
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,108
You did this.

136
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,324
Don't leave me.

137
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,911
The director called.

138
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,705
We have an OR but no doctors in the ER.

139
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,041
I'll do it. Please bring him in.

140
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,000
Yes, sir.

141
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,754
-This is it, right?
-Detective Ko!

142
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,965
Detective Ko!

143
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,591
Where the hell is that bastard?

144
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,301
-I need to see him!
-Calm down!

145
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,886
We don't know what happened yet.

146
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,806
Hey. I told him to tail the guy,
and he got stabbed.

147
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,809
Who do you think did it?
He looked suspicious from the get-go!

148
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,186
They're collecting
the security camera footage now, okay?

149
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,322
I can't lose another partner. Not again!

150
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,165
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

151
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,209
What's your deal?

152
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,003
Why are you here?

153
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,675
What did you do to him?

154
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,768
He was stabbed when I found him,
so I brought him here.

155
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,607
Ask him yourself for more detail
once he wakes up

156
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,693
because I saved his life.

157
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,221
It felt like a long trip.

158
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:15,516
What crazy things

159
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,935
do you want to do?

160
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,444
So this was my crazy thing.

161
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,156
What about yours?

162
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,286
What crazy thing do you want to do?

163
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,418
I want…

164
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,435
I already did it.

165
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,573
I rarely run.

166
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,576
But today, I ran with all my might.

167
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,083
If I do more crazy things,
then I'll become a lunatic.

168
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,379
Not just someone
who does crazy things sometimes.

169
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,234
What else do you…

170
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,500
Never mind.

171
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,150
I should be the one to drop them off.

172
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,986
I have errands to do
around there tomorrow anyway.

173
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,989
Thank you then.

174
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,784
Did you overstrain yourself yesterday?

175
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,285
You look exhausted.

176
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,287
I'm not.

177
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,248
I can see it in your eyes.

178
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,167
You look like a rabbit
with bloodshot eyes.

179
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,129
You shouldn't have tried
to prove me wrong.

180
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:54,091
What are you on about?
I had so much fun yesterday.

181
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,217
I enjoyed it.

182
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,638
You're the one who looks tired.

183
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,099
Me? That's not true.

184
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,934
I had a great time yesterday.

185
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,103
Your eyes are swollen.

186
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,106
You have dark circles.

187
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,569
Hello, wild rabbit

188
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:18,448
Where are you headed?

189
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,617
Flirt.

190
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,590
Start from there.

191
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,559
One Americano, please.

192
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:46,727
-Sure.
-The same as usual.

193
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,439
The hotel, cafe, hospital, and bookstore.
He's at a cafe to have coffee again.

194
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,109
Okay. I'll call you again.

195
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,610
Excuse me. Sir.

196
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,071
May I ask you something?

197
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,788
Sir!

198
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:50,874
Stop right there!

199
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:58,924
Damn it.

200
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,723
Sir.

201
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,650
I'd like to ask you something.

202
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,256
Hey. Oh, no.

203
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,424
-Hey.
-Hey.

204
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,633
-Are you okay?
-What do we do?

205
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,260
-Give me your phone.
-My phone?

206
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,845
Are you okay? Oh, no.

207
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,513
Is he seriously hurt?

208
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,348
-Did you call 911?
-I did.

209
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,766
-Oh, no.
-He's unconscious.

210
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,476
He's bleeding a lot.

211
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,561
Are you okay?

212
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,438
-Stay awake.
-Open your eyes.

213
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,481
-Are you okay?
-I'm a doctor. Excuse me.

214
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,538
Find out where he's been.

215
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,707
Detective Park's house,
the hotel, the police station.

216
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,667
-Find out where he started.
-Yes, sir.

217
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,898
I was wondering if it was you.

218
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,949
-Have you been well?
-Yes, I have.

219
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,826
But not Jun-ho.

220
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,997
Seeing how you came here
despite seeing my name,

221
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,832
I guess you're already over it.

222
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:59,211
You have a common name.

223
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,798
You abandoned your boyfriend of ten years.

224
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,759
And now, you're looking for a wealthy guy.

225
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,929
Just cut to the chase.

226
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:12,057
You acted like you were different,
but you're just like your father.

227
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,643
Do you think he'll be satisfied with me?

228
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,239
-Hey.
-Are you busy?

229
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,117
No, I just came to the lounge.

230
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,202
Was it my fault we broke up?

231
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,623
Should I have clung onto him?

232
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,961
Should I have convinced him to suffocate
with me in our relationship?

233
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:44,506
Did I break up with him?
Did I dump him because he was poor?

234
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,384
It wasn't your fault.

235
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,803
And you didn't instigate the breakup.

236
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,847
So why do they all hate me?

237
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,766
Why do they think I'm to blame?

238
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,686
Why does everyone who knew us curse at me?

239
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,689
I didn't dump him
because I wanted some rich guy.

240
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,191
What did I do so wrong?

241
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,528
They don't know anything.

242
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,113
You did nothing wrong.

243
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,537
Say that once again.

244
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,000
You loved him dearly for those ten years.

245
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,502
But it was hard on both of you,

246
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,381
so Jun-ho wanted to let go first.

247
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,466
It wasn't your fault.

248
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,053
Say that once more.

249
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,389
It wasn't your fault.

250
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,394
You don't deserve to be treated that way.

251
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,813
You're not a bad person.

252
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,859
Jun-ho probably knows that the best.

253
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,987
Ignore what everyone else says.

254
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,744
I'll call you again if I need to.

255
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,872
How many more do I have left?

256
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:03,126
I promised to tell you 500 times
that it wasn't your fault,

257
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,502
so you have 100 left.

258
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:07,172
Record it if it gets too tiring

259
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,424
like those street vendors do.

260
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,594
It's not tiring at all.

261
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,304
Where are you?

262
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:16,765
On the street.

263
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,395
Do you want to wait for me?

264
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,273
I'm getting off work early.

265
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,483
No.

266
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,612
I'm going to Gangneung.
I'll see you tomorrow.

267
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,571
Okay.

268
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,626
If you want to be told
that you made the right decision,

269
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,755
then it means you think otherwise.

270
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,676
If you want to be told so 500 times,

271
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,806
it means you've thought about it 500 times

272
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,393
yet still think

273
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,145
you were wrong.

274
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,655
Where would you like to go?

275
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,116
Gangneung.

276
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,827
As in the one in Gangwon Province?

277
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,378
Mom, Eun-ha is headed there.

278
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,592
Her blind date was Jun-ho's friend.

279
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:42,767
Yes. I think it'll take about three hours.

280
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,687
-Good work.
-Good work.

281
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:52,277
I'm in front of the hotel.
I'll be waiting until you come.

282
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,322
All right, let's pack up.

283
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:06,791
Hey!

284
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,052
Hey!

285
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,270
You know me, right? I need a ride.

286
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,023
What's wrong?

287
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,358
Do you need security?

288
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,234
No!

289
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:38,406
Please do me this favor.
Can you drive me out of here? Please?

290
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,873
Can I treat you like an older sister?

291
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,626
No.

292
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,669
Is it because you work there?

293
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,005
Are you not allowed
to befriend the hotel guests?

294
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,132
But I'm not a guest.

295
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,884
Or am I?

296
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,719
Right, I do use the rooms.

297
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,555
-It's because--
-Is it because of Young-do?

298
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:06,184
Do you think people might think
it's weird for us to be friends?

299
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,728
No, that's not why.

300
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,647
Does he not want you to befriend me?

301
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,190
Because I stole that toy figure?

302
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,693
He told on me.

303
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,780
I didn't take it
because I wanted to have it.

304
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,699
I just thought it'd help him
sort out his feelings.

305
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:22,992
I'm younger than you.

306
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:26,746
What?

307
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,499
You're older than me.

308
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,001
I see.

309
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:33,711
Right.

310
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:39,259
I have a baby face,
so I forget my age at times.

311
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,387
You haven't told me where to drop you off.

312
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,476
Just…

313
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,480
take me anywhere.

314
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,320
I'm contemplating where to go.

315
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,905
I'm avoiding someone.

316
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,867
He'll probably go to my house
and the gym first.

317
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,203
I don't want to be alone in a hotel room.

318
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,206
-Why not?
-I hate being alone.

319
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,417
She's not here.

320
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,171
She's either here or at home.
But she's not there and won't pick up.

321
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,756
Maybe she's at her friend's.

322
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,215
But she has none.

323
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:22,552
And yet, you stopped her from coming here

324
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,512
or going home.

325
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,142
Don't corner her and let her be for now.

326
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,853
Bye.

327
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,279
Do you really not get it?

328
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,490
Not only does she not want to get hurt,

329
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,993
but she also hates hurting others.
She's weird like that.

330
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,370
I don't get it.

331
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,998
I like her so much.

332
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:55,293
I'm saying she's worried
that you might end up getting hurt.

333
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:01,925
So hold yourself back even though
you're head over heels for her.

334
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,635
Respect her pace.

335
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:06,638
Don't get ahead of yourself
and scare her away.

336
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,979
You've deviated from your route.

337
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,564
A new route has been selected.

338
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,358
Make a U-turn in 300m.

339
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,237
Hold on.

340
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,365
Are you the type that hates
turning corners?

341
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,992
Why does the remaining time
keep increasing?

342
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:31,663
It's not like you've never been there.
We're going to your house.

343
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,582
Do you know how far 300m is?
Haven't you run 100m before?

344
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,876
Three of those equal 300m.

345
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,628
I rarely drive.

346
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,714
-And could you please be quiet--
-Or do you not want me there?

347
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,717
Is that why you refuse
to turn any corners?

348
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,886
That's not why. You're being too--

349
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,389
Or do you think
I'm trying to cling to Young-do?

350
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,349
Do you think I still like him?

351
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,062
I have a boyfriend.

352
00:30:56,145 --> 00:31:00,191
I'm just an awful driver
who is terrible with directions!

353
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,948
You can't be this terrible.

354
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:11,119
Keep talking,
and we might go all the way down to Busan.

355
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,790
PSYCHIATRIST JU YOUNG-DO

356
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,547
Thank you for today.

357
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,591
You can go first. I need to--

358
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,968
No. Someone's here for you.

359
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,804
But he's not a patient.

360
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:32,640
Sorry?

361
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,603
Okay. Good luck to you too.

362
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,746
What is this?

363
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,416
Are you feeling unwell?

364
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,839
Come on in.

365
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:22,565
Oh.

366
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,069
Hello.

367
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,991
This is about you two,
so I'm hesitant to say anything.

368
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,245
Had I put my pride first,

369
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,957
I wouldn't have come.

370
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,627
I don't care if this hurts my pride.

371
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,506
I don't care if people think
that I'm crazy.

372
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,468
Ga-yeong matters more to me.

373
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,473
If we break up,

374
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,810
I don't think I'll be able to take it.

375
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,149
JU YOUNG-DO PSYCHIATRY CLINIC

376
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,904
Go inside.

377
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,866
I'm not allowed in there. I'm banned.

378
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,327
Then why did you come here?

379
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,456
What should I do if I want to stay
on the rooftop for a bit?

380
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,042
I know I've already caused you
a lot of inconvenience,

381
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,502
but do me one more favor.

382
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,508
There's a cafe downstairs
where you can wait.

383
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,760
It's teeming with people.
I can't go there.

384
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,847
-It's going to be freezing up there.
-It's okay.

385
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,557
I don't mind shivering

386
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,684
while glaring at the pigeons.

387
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,069
I don't have anywhere else to go.

388
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,365
I didn't have to come inside,

389
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,909
but I also didn't want you
to worry about me.

390
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,996
Have a seat.
Do you want something to drink?

391
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,873
I'd like to get changed first.

392
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,666
Anything clean will do.

393
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,377
Get changed?

394
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,964
It's okay.
I wear shabby clothes at home too.

395
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,925
What a nice house.

396
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,555
It's so pretty.

397
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,727
I don't need new bedsheets.

398
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,437
It's okay. I'll sleep on this.

399
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,564
I'm not that high-maintenance.

400
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,233
Will you be okay sleeping on the floor?

401
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,820
But then again,
I heard it's better for your back.

402
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,073
As a concierge, you're always standing.

403
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:38,785
I thought you'd only wait here
until Mr. Ju was done with work.

404
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,620
You said it wouldn't be long.

405
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,873
Don't you worry.
I won't stay here for several days.

406
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:45,750
Several days?

407
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,630
You're not happy about this.

408
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:55,718
This isn't about whether I'm happy or not.
It's just too surreal.

409
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,971
You suddenly appeared out of nowhere,

410
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:02,183
got into my car, then came to my house--

411
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,434
Hold on.

412
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:09,816
Hello?

413
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,943
Hey, friend.

414
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,904
You want me to come over right now?

415
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,281
But I can stay here.

416
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,077
It's nice here too.

417
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,287
I see.

418
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,581
I'll be right there.

419
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:30,086
I should go now. She told me to hurry.

420
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:33,548
She lives in Punga-dong. You know
where that is, right? It's nearby.

421
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,509
I should hurry.

422
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:03,578
They say those who are lying
create a wall between them and others

423
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,873
because they don't want to open up.

424
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,418
And they emphasize useless information.

425
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,711
Like "Punga-dong."

426
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,212
You're scaring me.

427
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,715
You're just like Young-do.

428
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,301
I read one of his books.

429
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:23,681
Thank you.

430
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,894
Get changed.
I'm going to the cafe downstairs.

431
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:31,189
I don't need coffee. I have insomnia.

432
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,192
Also, please don't tell…

433
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,904
Young-do that I'm here.

434
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,701
Okay.

435
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,721
-How is Eun-ha doing?
-Hold on.

436
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,767
Are you eating well?

437
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,185
I made a mistake.

438
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,354
I ordered some spicy fish stew for her,

439
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:14,523
but the restaurant happened to be
the one she frequented with him.

440
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,360
Then I turned on the radio.

441
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,153
A song came on, and she--

442
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,988
Hold on.

443
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,114
The sea…

444
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,409
The sea is ignoring me.

445
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,537
It won't tell me
whether it's eating well or not.

446
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,373
I'm curious.

447
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:32,750
Maybe it's offended
by your lack of honorifics.

448
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:33,751
Mind your manners.

449
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,087
Right. Honorifics.

450
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,880
I'm good at that.

451
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,841
Okay. Honorifics?

452
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:47,014
Hey! Are you eating well, sir?

453
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,725
Answer me!

454
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,477
She's picking a fight with the sea.

455
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,688
I'll call you back later.

456
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,856
The water is still cold.

457
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,025
I know because I pushed Young-do in there.

458
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,403
-Let me see how cold it is.
-Don't go in there yet.

459
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,363
How cold are you?

460
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,501
Breaking up with someone means

461
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:21,382
you must say goodbye
to everything you met through them.

462
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:27,096
For example, their friends
who were just as close with you,

463
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,349
the restaurants you frequented,

464
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,269
and the songs they sang to you.

465
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,523
You must bid your last farewell

466
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,485
to everything that was once dear to you.

JU YOUNG-DO PSYCHIATRY CLINIC

468
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,076
If I do more crazy things,
then I'll become a lunatic.

469
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,331
Not just someone
who does crazy things sometimes.

470
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,043
What else do you…

471
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:05,926
Never mind.

472
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:17,188
The reason why two people
can't be crazy and muster up the courage

473
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:19,899
in front of each other

474
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,277
if they are not each others' first love

475
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,031
is too clear.

476
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,210
Hey, Cheol-do.

477
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,588
I'm already home.

478
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,011
I just want to stay home tonight.

479
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,474
Okay. Bye.

480
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,693
Hey. You're here.

481
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:06,862
Why are you here?

482
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,115
I dozed off while waiting for you.

483
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:13,119
What took you so long?
Your clinic is only ten minutes away.

484
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:15,996
Why are you here?

485
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,418
By the way, the air in here is too dry.

486
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:25,631
Both dogs and humans
need to have wet noses.

487
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:26,882
He's right.

488
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,385
Since you're still dressed,
go buy some beer.

489
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:34,890
I really should change the passcode.

490
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:41,689
-He doesn't know how to.
-I know.

491
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,816
If we change it,
he won't be able to enter.

492
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,776
Let's change it.

493
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:50,156
Young-do, we'll change the passcode
for you.

494
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:53,701
Ask Ms. Kang when her birthday is.
We'll change it to that.

495
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,661
You little…

496
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,122
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

497
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,250
Are you going out now?

498
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,882
I finally found out

499
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:12,511
how to tell the difference between
dog poop and chocolate-covered snacks

500
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,930
without tasting them myself.

501
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,098
I know.

502
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,520
By smelling it.

503
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,484
You're right!

504
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,195
How did you know that
when you're not even a vet?

505
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:32,698
Or maybe you shouldn't eat anything
off the ground.

506
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,783
You can't be handsome and smart!

507
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,745
You should've picked your face wisely.
You picked the wrong one.

508
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,663
Are you done drinking? I'll call a cab.

509
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,207
Are you going somewhere?

510
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,792
He's going out to see Ms. Kang again.

511
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,044
You traitor!

512
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,131
-Here.
-Gosh.

513
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,300
Wear them and leave.

514
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:53,344
Please wear them and get out.

515
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,189
No, I wasn't sleeping.

516
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,151
I didn't call your name.

517
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,487
Please sleep on the bed.

518
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:13,906
I wasn't sleeping.

519
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:16,534
Don't mind me,
and continue what you were doing.

520
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,510
What is it?

521
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,970
I wasn't sleeping.

522
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,223
I wasn't.

523
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,254
Going somewhere?

524
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,006
Why are you still up?

525
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:56,133
I don't feel comfortable
in my house today.

526
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,136
So do I.

527
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,640
Do you want anything
at the convenience store?

528
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,769
If you want tea or coffee,
I have some in my office.

529
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,406
-Come on in.
-Okay.

530
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,409
DOCTOR'S OFFICE

531
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,453
-Is green tea okay?
-Yes.

532
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,372
Wait here.

533
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,323
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

534
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,667
Here you go.

535
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,548
I only give these to children.

536
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:20,300
Thank you.

537
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:23,470
-Isn't it too late to eat--
-It's okay. They're tasty.

538
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,681
Right.

539
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:31,520
By the way, do your patients lie down
on that couch?

540
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:34,440
Some do.

541
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,650
On days like this, I sleep there.

542
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:41,864
They often use those couches in movies
for hypnosis.

543
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:44,032
We can do that too.

544
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,535
They do it in psychiatry?

545
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,830
We have a curriculum for that.
But I don't do it.

546
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:51,457
Are you serious?

547
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,500
Of course.

548
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:55,711
Why? Do you not believe me?

549
00:45:56,753 --> 00:46:01,091
How can I trust someone who made me
greet a tree in the most ridiculous pose?

550
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,720
It's not a common form
of treatment, though,

551
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:07,764
since those who aren't susceptible
won't get hypnotized.

552
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,685
In your case…

553
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,899
You think I'll get hypnotized easily?

554
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,525
Do you want to find out?

555
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,235
There's a way to tell.

556
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,613
-Okay.
-All right.

557
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:25,240
Look straight ahead of you.

558
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:29,995
Look up as if you're looking
at your eyebrows.

559
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,665
Then look even further up.

560
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,251
Imagine that you're looking
at the crown of your head.

561
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,470
Do you take me for a fool?

562
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:50,057
What does rolling your eyes
have to do with susceptibility?

563
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,518
I'm not joking this time.

564
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,520
Sure.

565
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:58,607
By how much your eyes show the white area,

566
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,735
you can tell
how easily you can be hypnotized.

567
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:02,986
Sure.

568
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,239
I'm serious.

569
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,075
I bet

570
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,787
my hand and everything I have
that it's not true.

571
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,832
Deal. Wait here.

572
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,435
All right.

573
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:41,775
No way.

574
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,862
Does this mean the rooftop is mine?

575
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,072
And your house.

576
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:49,157
This must be a fake book.

577
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,909
Look it up if you want.

578
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:51,910
Wait.

579
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:55,497
I have three hands now
since your right hand is mine too.

580
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:59,293
Fine. Take it.

581
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,919
Sure, give it to me.

582
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,098
You…

583
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,851
You can work here.

584
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:18,895
What about you?

585
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:22,357
I'll be over there.
Let me know if you need anything.

586
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:36,204
RENTAL LIST
ITEM: A-TYPE STROLLER, USB-C CHARGER

587
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,379
PSYCHIATRIST JU YOUNG-DO

588
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,045
CALL JU-WON

589
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,798
He has terrible handwriting.

590
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:06,521
Did you sleep well?

591
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,440
No. I mean, hello.

592
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:12,027
I think you should explain
what's going on.

593
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,406
What time is it? I must be crazy.

594
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,326
It's Saturday.

595
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,124
Hello.

596
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:30,253
Don't you need to explain to me
what's going on here?

597
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,589
Why are you here so early on a Saturday?

598
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:36,760
You're the one who packed
your morning schedule since you have to

599
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,762
tend to your outpatients in the afternoon.

600
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:40,931
Right.

601
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,228
I'll see you next time.

602
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:47,813
Well…

603
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,941
I should go home and wash up.

604
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,280
"Wash up"?

605
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,535
JU YOUNG-DO PSYCHIATRY CLINIC

606
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:25,976
-Hello.
-No, don't get up.

607
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,438
Moving around too much will hurt

608
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,649
due to the nerve fibers in your abdomen.

609
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:34,442
Seeing you here

610
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:38,196
makes me realize
that you really are a doctor.

611
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:40,991
Where's your mother?

612
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,577
-She went out to eat.
-I see.

613
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:45,996
How are you feeling?

614
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:49,749
I'm fine. I am drowsy, though.

615
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:53,253
Because it's a narcotic analgesic.
You could feel dizzy too.

616
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,340
But you must sleep well
to recover quickly, so…

617
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,634
I see. Narcotic.

618
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:01,553
Maybe that's why

619
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,055
I keep dreaming.

620
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,441
You may see afterimages for some time.

621
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,235
If it continues, you should get therapy,

622
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:20,655
take medication, and get treated.

623
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:23,783
I'm not that weak.

624
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,954
Even police officers feel fear.

625
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:31,458
Some people try to brush it off

626
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,752
with a strong sense of vocation.

627
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,212
But that'll only cause PTSD.

628
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:39,633
It means post-traumatic stress disorder.

629
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:42,052
It'll become chronic if it accumulates.

630
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:53,563
Just promise me

631
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,567
that you'll see a doctor if you feel pain.

632
00:53:58,151 --> 00:54:00,236
I don't care if it's psychological
or physical.

633
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,530
Or if you're a police officer.

634
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:06,201
You can call me if that's better.

635
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:10,205
Okay. I'll do that.

636
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,627
If you only believe your hunch,

637
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,963
what's the use of forensic science
or regulations?

638
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,006
We might as well just follow your hunch.

639
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:24,386
We haven't even found the person
who provided us with the photo.

640
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:28,181
He could've been an accomplice,
but he wasn't spotted on any cameras.

641
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:29,641
Ever heard of blind spots?

642
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:32,185
It can't be a coincidence that a man

643
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:34,562
who looks just like
Choi Jeong-min showed up now.

644
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:37,107
It's highly likely
that one of the twins was

645
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,192
illegally adopted through the facility.

646
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:40,318
Jin-bok.

647
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:42,779
Yes, sir.

648
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,198
Do you still not get it?

649
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:48,201
You're favoring Jeong-beom
over other citizens.

650
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:51,037
This citizen also pays taxes.

651
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,747
This one too!

652
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,374
We need to protect them all!

653
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:58,003
I'll do better, sir.

654
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,547
You did the same
to Detective Park as well.

655
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,133
You were hell-bent on finding the killer,

656
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,843
so you made him

657
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:07,178
tail that guy by himself!

658
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:13,143
You neglected him because all you cared

659
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:15,270
about was Jeong-beom!

660
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:16,896
VIOLENT CRIMES

661
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,774
That's enough! Please stop!

662
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,153
Young-do is only 11 years old.

663
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,530
Who knows what'll happen to him?

664
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:28,783
How could you ask him
to give his kidney too?

665
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:31,161
You already took his blood and marrow.

666
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:34,330
His arms are full of needle marks!

667
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,833
Then should we let Young-jae die?

668
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:40,754
Should we not try anything
and just let him go?

669
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:44,299
Young-do wants to do it.

670
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:48,011
He wants to give his brother his kidney!

671
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:51,347
You told him
Young-jae would die otherwise.

672
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,349
Of course, he'd say that.

673
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,895
Young-do is also our son, honey.

674
00:55:56,978 --> 00:56:00,607
Honey, I can't let Young-jae die. Never.

675
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,109
Please, honey!

676
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:06,738
I will never let go of him!

677
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:11,493
Someone told us
that this place had great facilities

678
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:14,162
and that the staff members
were kind as well.

679
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:15,830
Yes, that's true.

680
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:17,540
Well…

681
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:21,419
We're going through something right now.

682
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:23,171
Young-do.

683
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:26,341
I need you to stay here for a few days.

684
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:30,428
Can't I just stay
at the temple we went to before?

685
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,472
This place frightens me.

686
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,516
No one will find you here.

687
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,602
I'll come for you very soon.

688
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,190
Look at me.

689
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,317
Do you think I'm lying?

690
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,113
Dad, what will happen to Young-jae
if I stay here?

691
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:54,577
He'll be okay. I'll take care of him.

692
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:58,790
No. You're lying.

693
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,793
I want to save him.

694
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:17,934
Mom.

695
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,119
Here.

696
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,665
This is the security camera footage.

697
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:43,376
Mr. Ko wants you
to observe the suspect's gait.

698
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,295
Okay, I will.

699
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,422
Are you leaving already?

700
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,967
I think he'll take some time.
I'll come back tomorrow.

701
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,000
CHOI JEONG-MIN

702
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,381
Follow me.

703
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,010
I'll show you.

704
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:37,216
Who is it?

705
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:42,221
Who are you?

706
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:48,186
On March 13, 2003, at 9 p.m.,

707
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,647
I killed Kim Myeong-ja.

708
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,858
Are you saying you don't know
who Ms. Kim Myeong-ja is?

709
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:57,737
No one knows who lives in that house.

710
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:01,366
On June 3, 2018, at 2 p.m.,

711
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:05,578
I stabbed Lee Jeong-beom
in a back alley at Pungji 8-dong

712
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:09,207
because he knew too much about me.

713
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:12,710
And on December 18, 2020, at 2 a.m.,

714
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:14,212
I killed Cho Gwang-hun.

715
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:19,592
Since I knew that the building was vacant,

716
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:22,261
I could carry out my deed
without feeling rushed.

717
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:25,765
JU YOUNG-DO PSYCHIATRY CLINIC

718
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,813
Hello.

719
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,904
What are you doing here?

720
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:44,075
My friends run this cafe.

721
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:46,411
Is he…

722
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,622
He's someone else. Don't misunderstand.

723
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:58,881
Why did you come here?

724
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,758
I was following his trail.

725
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:05,513
It would've been better
had I not known anything.

726
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,808
But I kept running into these situations.

727
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:14,814
And you're at the end

728
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:17,900
of the trail I followed, Ms. Kang.

729
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,699
Do you think he was planning to…

730
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:28,453
Was he planning

731
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:30,788
to hurt you, too?

732
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:41,632
I'm sorry. You don't need to answer that.

733
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,469
The funeral was held today,

734
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,512
so it got me thinking.

735
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:54,729
I couldn't answer…

736
01:02:58,191 --> 01:02:59,776
because I really don't know.

737
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:05,615
If he was the man I believed him to be,

738
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:08,659
probably not.

739
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,332
A warm room,

740
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:16,834
tangerines,

741
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:18,753
and cats.

742
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,591
He was warm-hearted like that.

743
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:31,140
But then again, Chae Jun…

744
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,943
never existed.

745
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:54,580
May I ask you one question?

746
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:55,498
Sure.

747
01:03:58,292 --> 01:04:00,336
Have you heard

748
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:03,130
of Nanum Jeil Church in Changbi-dong?

749
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:07,385
I remember very little from my childhood.

750
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:09,595
I see.

751
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,558
If you feel uncomfortable
seeing me at work,

752
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:15,560
I could ask for another staff member

753
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:17,144
or move hotels.

754
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:19,605
I'm not sure,

755
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:24,402
but I feel like I should do this much
for you.

756
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:27,655
I appreciate your kindness,

757
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:31,534
but I can't ask a guest to move
just because I feel uncomfortable.

758
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:34,745
So I make you uncomfortable.

759
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:37,915
It's not like that.

760
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:41,752
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

761
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,785
A CHURCH OF FAITH IN CHANGBI-DONG

762
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,454
Have you heard

763
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:19,582
of Nanum Jeil Church in Changbi-dong?

764
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:45,107
Hey. You'll sell well.

765
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:47,568
You'd sell much better
together with your twin.

766
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:48,861
Come inside.

767
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:53,783
We'll send this one to the US today.

768
01:06:58,472 --> 01:07:00,349
-Hurry up!
-This is your sibling.

769
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,601
Come here! What's wrong with you?

770
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:03,853
What's your problem?

771
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,943
Where am I?

772
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:55,071
Where's my brother?

773
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:56,405
What about my mom?

774
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,699
Is he that kid with no name?

775
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:01,368
-My name is Choi Jeong-min.
-Do as I say

776
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:02,536
and stay here.

777
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,663
And he's no longer your brother.

778
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,040
They'll definitely like you.

779
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:09,251
You could get a new mom.

780
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:10,461
Dr. Chase.

781
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:12,505
Can you hear me?

782
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:15,633
Are you okay?

783
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:17,468
Can you hear me?

784
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:20,096
Open your eyes. Dr. Chase.

785
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:07,226
He must've thought I was attacking him.

786
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:08,519
He suddenly pushed me.

787
01:09:08,602 --> 01:09:09,895
You got hurt.

788
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,438
There's nothing I can do.

789
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:13,607
That makes me feel
so frustrated and stupid.

790
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:14,942
Who are you?

791
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:16,610
When I wasn't okay,

792
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:19,780
Young-do noticed and he saved me.

793
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:20,948
It's more likely

794
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:23,117
that this guy is Ian Chase,
not Choi Jeong-min.

795
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:26,328
Maybe he committed the murder
for his older brother.

796
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:28,122
Can you come here right now?

797
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:31,000
Why can't I do anything for you?

798
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,211
I've come to like you.

799
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:38,966
