1
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:30,006
You'll be receiving
your training in a month.

2
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:32,759
I wish I could fly as well.

3
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,386
-I know.
-How about you put me

4
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,055
in a huge suitcase--

5
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,348
No, thanks.

6
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,059
Then in a fridge--

7
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,019
No, thanks.

8
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,689
They say if you leave someone you love,

9
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,609
you'll be pining for them
after traveling only ten meters.

10
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,820
It's ten ri, not ten meters.

11
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,491
Why don't you look excited
to go to San Francisco?

12
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,245
The duration is longer than I thought.

13
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,372
Is this because of your boyfriend?

14
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,500
You won't be gone for that long.

15
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,461
It's not like you'll be gone
for five or ten years.

16
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,262
Not all goodbyes are sad.

17
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,724
Breaking up after falling out of love

18
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:27,689
is like stepping out of a tub
filled with lukewarm water.

19
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:28,731
It's relieving.

20
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:30,984
However,

21
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,696
to a new couple, a farewell is like

22
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,741
desperately waiting for some noodles
to cook for three minutes.

23
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,952
Then when it's finally done…

24
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:41,911
It's done now.

25
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,414
-Eat up. You're on an empty stomach.
-…you spill them.

26
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,833
It's that heartbreaking.

27
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,752
It says you're enlisting in the army.

28
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,088
What do you mean? I'm what?

29
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,467
EXCLUSIVE
PATRICK ENLISTING IN THE ARMY

30
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,770
Am I enlisting next week?

31
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,564
Yes.

32
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,274
Ms. Song didn't tell you?

33
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,985
So this is official?

34
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,488
Yes, it is.

35
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,083
I slept so well.

36
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,379
-Make sure you rate it five stars.
-Of course. Others need to suffer too.

37
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,090
It's a pity Young-do didn't come.

38
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,509
Let's encourage him
to watch it with Da-jeong.

39
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,802
Exactly.

40
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,057
Hello, I'm from Majin Cosmetics.

41
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,350
Please take this survey

42
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,310
and get a free couple's massage.

43
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:56,694
I'd call that a happy ending.
They went back to their everyday lives.

44
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,697
How is it a happy ending

45
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,950
when they still love each other?

46
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,203
It's the most upsetting ending
I've ever seen.

47
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,624
Both of them already had lovers.

48
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,377
It's only right to break up.

49
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:17,423
Love affairs are bound to end.
It's only right.

50
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,928
This is what you call
a beautiful farewell.

51
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,974
How can a farewell be beautiful?

52
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,688
Then? Should you break up every time
you develop feelings for someone else?

53
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,981
That's not what I mean.

54
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,358
The order could've gotten mixed up.

55
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,487
The first person you date
may not be your true love.

56
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,240
Even if you dated someone for ten years,

57
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,993
the next person you meet

58
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,079
could actually be your true love.

59
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,587
Let's go.

60
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,757
A beautiful farewell

61
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,344
could sound as ridiculous

62
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,680
as a toilet-scented diffuser,

63
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:11,602
an angled circle,
or a transparent rainbow.

64
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,771
We could've gotten the massage.

65
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,524
Is this why you hang out with me?

66
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,151
Then let's just go our own ways.

67
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,194
What?

68
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:36,711
But even such farewells

69
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,590
can only occur
between those who loved each other.

70
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,260
If your love was unreciprocated,

71
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,056
there's nothing you can do but watch.

72
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,399
Then there are those…

73
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,068
CHOI JEONG-MIN

74
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,612
…who can't even tell…

75
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,324
who's holding onto whom.

76
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,620
For them, even saying goodbye
is impossible.

77
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,303
It's been scientifically proven
that men suffer more

78
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,138
in a long-distance relationship.

79
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,307
Meanwhile, you'll be in a new environment

80
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,642
and meet new people.

81
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,895
Time will pass quickly for you,

82
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,772
but I'll be stuck here.

83
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:38,856
"Right.

84
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,193
This is where Da-jeong
made me feel embarrassed.

85
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,239
This is where
we had cup noodles together."

86
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:51,369
At least you have friends here.

87
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,996
You have your own friends,
Eun-ha, Cheol-do, and A-ri.

88
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,249
I'll have no one.

89
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,127
I'll be eating hamburgers all by myself.

90
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,506
And people will think
that I'm a very quiet, Korean woman.

91
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,345
I'll feel lonely
when I return to the hotel late at night.

92
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,723
Even if I want to call someone back home,

93
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,475
it'll be too late to call.

94
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,686
You'll be exhausted and fast asleep,

95
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,062
so we won't be able to talk.

96
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,940
Why not?

97
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,484
I won't sleep until you call me.

98
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,113
-Are you serious?
-Of course.

99
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,198
I didn't know.

100
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,205
Can you just not go?

101
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,331
I can't do that.

102
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,878
Being apart for five days
is just too long.

103
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:48,050
Tell me about it.
They must be out of their minds.

104
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,051
And now,

105
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,971
we must bid farewell

106
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:56,893
for a whopping duration of five days.

107
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,164
What is love?

108
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,875
What could it be

109
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,212
that it changed those two so drastically?

110
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,757
I thought Lavoisier
was just rambling nonsense.

111
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,010
But it's true.
Mass is neither created nor destroyed.

112
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,387
Lavoi… What?

113
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,642
Lavoisier,
and the Law of Conservation of Mass.

114
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,268
Oh, that.

115
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,271
Do you mean
how there are lunatics everywhere you go?

116
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,191
In this situation,
we're talking about being lovey-dovey.

117
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,860
The lovey-dovey couple disappeared,

118
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,112
but an even more lovey-dovey couple
took their place.

119
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,336
You're going to get it
all over your mouth.

120
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,929
-How is it?
-Sweet.

121
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,682
I want more.

122
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,894
What are you doing?

123
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,105
I think it's about time I quit.

124
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,233
This is where they live,

125
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,693
so I can't even kick them out.

126
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,280
A-ri…

127
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:38,828
Jeong-beom.

128
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,914
If you haven't been appearing

129
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,668
in my dreams
since you didn't want me to feel bad,

130
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,086
don't do that anymore.

131
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,966
Scold me about apprehending

132
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,427
the culprit so late.

133
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,053
ASSISTANT INSPECTOR LEE JEONG-BEOM

134
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,555
Nag me

135
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,724
about being messy.

136
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,561
And let's

137
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,063
grab a drink too.

138
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:12,862
I miss you.

139
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,561
Let's go.

140
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,954
If you think about it,
it's all because of Ian Chase.

141
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,207
But he's getting away with this?

142
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,293
-Darn it.
-This is exactly why

143
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,754
we need to vote for the right individual.

144
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,924
We need to vote
for someone who writes good laws

145
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,218
and is open to changing them too.

146
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,221
Gosh, I've been thinking
the same thing for the past 18 years.

147
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,182
But here's my conviction.

148
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:27,436
A culprit may not receive
legal punishment,

149
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,271
but karma will get to them.

150
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:30,815
I believe that.

151
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,067
As a doctor, what's your take on that?

152
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,069
I completely agree.

153
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,530
-Please change the grill.
-I'm sure you know this.

154
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,032
Friedrich Nietzsche, a German philosopher,

155
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,201
once said, "When you stare into the abyss,

156
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,203
the abyss stares back at you."

157
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,831
I think Ian is the epitome of that.

158
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,916
Sir.

159
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,961
Someone's calling for you.

160
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,756
Sure. Hold on.

161
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,841
Coming.

162
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,054
You said he'd come back,

163
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,390
but what if he really resigns this time?

164
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,476
I'm worried too.
I think he really means it this time.

165
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,645
Eat up.

166
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,731
Gosh. I keep forgetting that I work here.

167
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,941
Silly me.

168
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,820
Thank you so much.

169
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,864
You were warm toward me when I suddenly

170
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,615
showed up at the station.

171
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:26,245
You also let me know
in advance when your men

172
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,205
were on a stakeout at the hotel.

173
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,624
Gosh, don't mention it.
I did what I had to do.

174
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,793
Rather, I should thank you

175
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,171
for taking great care of Young-do.

176
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,469
I'm just sad that you'll be resigning.

177
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:45,181
It's about time I quit. I have no regrets.

178
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,893
Eat up. Our meat is quite good.

179
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,025
Yes, sir. No, sir.

180
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,195
We'll go right now.

181
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:00,779
No, sir.

182
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,407
I'm with Detectives Ko and Choi.

183
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,078
We got a tip-off
on that Hongju 4-dong guy.

184
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,788
-If we go right now--
-Really?

185
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,790
Stop stuffing your mouth. Get up.

186
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:12,875
Eat up. Don't pay.

187
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,211
Mom, serve Young-do many delicious dishes!

188
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,633
No way.

189
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,051
I told you.

190
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,595
Don't worry and eat up.

191
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,982
Hey.

192
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,734
-Do you need any help?
-No.

193
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:42,029
I accidentally left
my phone on the rooftop.

194
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:45,741
-Can you bring it down if you have time?
-Sure. It won't take long.

195
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,218
-Yes?
-I just saw your missed call.

196
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:08,305
Are you feeling better?
You couldn't sleep well last night.

197
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,932
No, I slept well.

198
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,433
Wait, how would you know?

199
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,811
Hello?

200
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,731
You were tossing and turning
all night. Are you sure you slept well?

201
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:20,734
TAE-JEONG

202
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,448
All night?

203
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,826
You're going to come home
after work, right?

204
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,662
Hello?

205
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,747
Did you come down here for me?

206
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,459
What's wrong?

207
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,338
-What?
-Hello?

208
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,341
Hello?

209
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,969
Gosh!

210
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,054
Oh, no!

211
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,893
Da-jeong.

212
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,519
Da-jeong, listen.

213
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,147
-I--
-Your phone was ringing.

214
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,816
I saw "Tae-jeong."

215
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,737
Since that's my brother's name,

216
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,447
I just picked it up.

217
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:11,410
But he said
you guys were together all night.

218
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,580
Then he asked you to come home after work.

219
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,165
What is this?

220
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,292
Is this a prank?

221
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,878
Or is this someone else?

222
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,799
But he sounds exactly like my brother.

223
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,606
I was… I was going to tell you.

224
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,026
But because of your current situation…

225
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,696
Does that mean
when you folded your finger that time…

226
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,785
Yes.

227
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,250
What should I do?

228
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,045
-Mom…
-Da-jeong.

229
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:07,132
No. Listen. That's not it. So…

230
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,550
What should I do?

231
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,566
When…

232
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,485
No, don't tell me.

233
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,823
No, tell me. How did you…

234
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:31,740
No, don't.

235
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,370
Tell me just a bit.

236
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:39,373
No, don't. God, what should I do?

237
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,334
Da-jeong.

238
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,713
Well…

239
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,632
You see, last time--

240
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,925
I don't want to hear it.

241
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,429
No, make it quick.

242
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,847
No, don't.

243
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,891
I'll kill you if you do.

244
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,229
One time, she--

245
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,856
Shut up.

246
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,316
You told me to talk.

247
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,361
I'll talk.

248
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,117
That day when Jun-ho came,

249
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,331
I was frustrated and felt awful.

250
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,085
And you were at a meeting.

251
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,296
So I went to Mr. Ju

252
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,174
and poured my heart out.

253
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,593
But…

254
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,889
that didn't make me feel any better.

255
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,807
So…

256
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,769
I just walked.

257
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,356
I know that face.

258
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,403
-What?
-You're about to cry.

259
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,572
Is something up?

260
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,117
Even if that's the case,

261
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,747
it's too far in the past
for me to cry about it.

262
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,709
And I'm too old to cry.

263
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,169
The past can still hurt.

264
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,838
And you're not old.

265
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,674
Is it your dad?

266
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,720
Or your ex-boyfriend?

267
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,809
How do you know everything about me?

268
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,393
It's been 20 years already.

269
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,271
We've celebrated 20 birthdays so far.

270
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,357
And I've given you flowers
for middle school,

271
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,318
high school, and college entrance
ceremonies and graduations.

272
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,404
So I can easily tell

273
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:38,283
how you're feeling just by looking at you.

274
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,163
Don't make me emotional.

275
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,501
I might bawl my eyes out and become

276
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,461
your worst, impossible customer.

277
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,299
There's something I can do
for customers like you.

278
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,266
What are you doing?

279
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,353
You can bawl.

280
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,731
I need to close soon anyway.

281
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:16,572
Can I…

282
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,159
really do that?

283
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,761
Why does this seem like

284
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,389
a Greek tragedy?

285
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,225
What are you talking about?
We're not siblings.

286
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,480
It's so weird to hear you
call yourselves "we."

287
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,068
Wait.

288
00:19:56,528 --> 00:20:00,157
Then when we went
to that tteokbokki place…

289
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,371
Was this you?

290
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,331
Hey.

291
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,417
EUN-HA, TAE-JEONG

292
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,794
What?

293
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,796
Did you guys go there too?

294
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,964
That's so fascinating.

295
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,927
Then we got into a relationship
on the same day.

296
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,848
That's when you started dating?

297
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,600
The day I went to the bar?

298
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,644
That was it?

299
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,606
That's the day we had our first kiss.

300
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,735
Why would you say that out loud?

301
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,365
No. My ears. Darn it.

302
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,242
-Can I go?
-Bye.

303
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,159
Can I?

304
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,285
-Sure.
-Goodbye.

305
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,084
Why would you say that
when I was scolding them?

306
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,552
CLOSED FOR RENOVATION

307
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,554
CLOSED FOR RENOVATION

308
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,306
CLOSED FOR RENOVATION

309
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,308
CLOSED FOR RENOVATION

310
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,529
-Come in.
-Okay.

311
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,540
No way.

312
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,465
-It's Seung-won. Hold on.
-Sure.

313
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,345
-What is it?
-Hey, where are you?

314
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,390
I'm a bit far away.

315
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,183
Want to help me write my proposal?

316
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,978
Why me?

317
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:56,023
The chief producer wants me to produce
a show called Land a Hit.

318
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,525
The host will meet
with people like Ma Dong-seok

319
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,777
and Kim Jong-kook and get hit.

320
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,823
Psychologically-speaking,
could this be cathartic?

321
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:07,075
-I'm hanging up.
-Hello?

322
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,287
Hey, are you with Da-jeong?

323
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,497
Why… Why did you hang up?

324
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,584
What a traitor.

325
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,793
I'm sorry.

326
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,712
It's fine.

327
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,467
It's my mom. She's video-calling me.

328
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,468
Pick it up.

329
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:29,848
But we're the only ones here,
and we'll be spending the night.

330
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,226
Right. I'll sit here. Go on.

331
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,272
Hey, Mom.

332
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:39,733
Where are you?

333
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,153
-You're not home.
-No.

334
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,738
I'm on a trip.

335
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,865
Our building is closed for renovation.

336
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,950
But it's just you and Young-do?

337
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,536
-Where are the others?
-What?

338
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,289
Why do you say that?

339
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,963
Should we turn off our phones today?

340
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,717
Really? Would that be okay for you?

341
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,761
Let's give it a try.

342
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,848
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

343
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,900
-Are you anxious?
-No, I'm not.

344
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:23,985
I bet you're worried

345
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,197
that someone may need your help.

346
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,582
You don't need to turn it off.

347
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,002
I'll give it a shot.

348
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,588
I'll turn it on if I'm too anxious.

349
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,299
Good.

350
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,468
What should we do?

351
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,557
Shall we go for a walk?

352
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,517
-A walk?
-Yes.

353
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,947
-Do you want some ice cream?
-Sure.

354
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,532
Hello.

355
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,619
-Here.
-Okay.

356
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,333
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

357
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,628
They still sell tangerines?

358
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,589
Oh, those?

359
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,425
A customer had bought them on the train.

360
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:33,930
Take one each.

361
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,391
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

362
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:37,475
No problem.

363
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,863
-Which one?
-This one.

364
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,035
Okay.

365
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:01,750
Yes!

366
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,671
We got it!

367
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,840
You put this on top.

368
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,427
How adorable.

369
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,434
There are no trash cans.

370
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,686
That's a pity.

371
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,964
Did you forget
that it's our 100th day together?

372
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,466
Of course not. I got something for you.

373
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:54,094
-Ta-da.
-I'm in trouble.

374
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:56,513
This is my laundry.

375
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:01,101
Can I give this to you later?
I need to go to the toilet.

376
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,270
Sure. Be quick.

377
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,605
I should buy a cake.

378
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,611
I'm not sleeping.

379
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,535
Are you imitating those dads
who say, "I'm not sleeping"?

380
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,287
Is that it?

381
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,957
Why do you guys do that?
My mom's the same way.

382
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:29,170
If you fall asleep with the TV on,

383
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,882
you can usually still hear
since you're in REM sleep.

384
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:38,430
But if someone switches the channel,

385
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:41,474
you're stimulated
by the change in TV sounds.

386
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,935
That's why you wake up.

387
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:48,356
In such cases,
you should gradually lower the volume

388
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,359
then switch to another channel.

389
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,321
I see.

390
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,909
I'm fully awake thanks to you.

391
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,246
Let me help you sleep again.

392
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,548
A long time ago

393
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:16,843
there lived Ju Young-do and Kang Da-jeong.

394
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,971
They went on a trip,

395
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:23,016
ate some tangerines, watched some TV,

396
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:26,102
played Patty Cake, and had a load of fun.

397
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,604
The end.

398
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,775
That was a little boring.

399
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:39,324
A long time ago
there lived Ju Young-do and Kang Da-jeong.

400
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,202
They went on a trip,

401
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:45,372
ate some tangerines, watched some TV,

402
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:46,748
and…

403
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,752
…kissed each other.

404
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,256
They had a load of fun.

405
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,762
That sounds fun.

406
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:02,847
Right?

407
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,580
Young-do, I'm here.
Are you still sleeping?

408
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,042
Young-do.

409
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,045
Young-do.

410
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,342
How did you know my passcode?

411
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,593
-I--
-Get out.

412
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,761
Did I come too early?

413
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,389
-Just leave for now.
-Let me take a short nap.

414
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,391
A beast is snoring in the night-duty room.

415
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,684
Sleep in my office.

416
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,185
That couch is more comfortable.

417
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,395
Okay? So go.

418
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,731
Come back next time, okay?

419
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:03,992
Did he startle you?

420
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:11,458
Is he gone?

421
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,877
Yes. I'm sorry.

422
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,756
You didn't change your passcode?

423
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,799
I did.

424
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,303
Don't tell me

425
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,930
you changed it to my birthday.

426
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,350
I didn't think he'd know the lunar date.

427
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,830
What if

428
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,625
I didn't go to Jeong-min

429
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,628
in a fit of rage?

430
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,093
What if

431
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,597
I had told the truth on the day

432
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,934
I witnessed the first murder?

433
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:14,979
What if

434
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,608
I didn't look for Hwang Jae-sik?

435
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,831
What if he was abandoned,

436
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,916
neglected,

437
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,960
abused,

438
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,130
and died trying to fight back?

439
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,675
Would you still cry for him?

440
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,179
If you mean something evil…

441
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,767
by "fight back," then no.

442
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,648
What ifs

443
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:45,028
don't matter if it has already passed.

444
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:56,706
Okay.

445
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:57,916
EUN GI-JUN'S BLACK RADIO

446
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,835
I have some sad news today.

447
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,007
Today was our last episode with Dr. Ju.

448
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,762
Would you like to say something
to our listeners…

449
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:14,891
Especially those who are going
through a hard time?

450
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,726
Feel free to say anything.

451
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,649
The person I like…

452
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,068
Do you mean your girlfriend?

453
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,028
Yes.

454
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:33,493
She introduced
the movie Taste of Cherry to me.

455
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:40,166
A suicidal man is driving,

456
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,001
then he picks up an old man.

457
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:45,171
That old man tells him his story.

458
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:49,342
He says he once climbed a tree,
intending to commit suicide.

459
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,596
That's when he spotted a cherry.

460
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:58,393
He ate it,
and it was so sweet and delicious.

461
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,564
The sun shone brightly,
and the children were so beautiful.

462
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:05,900
That's why

463
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,820
he decided to live.

464
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,657
What happened to that suicidal man?

465
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,536
He probably had a change of heart.

466
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,122
That cherry saved his life.

467
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,417
To be precise,

468
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,546
talking with the old man saved his life.

469
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:32,969
Let's be frank. "The world is beautiful,"
and "you must live,"

470
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,221
are obvious things to say.

471
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,872
Gosh. I'm sorry.

472
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:08,796
It's all done.

473
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,800
-Do you need a plastic bag?
-No, I can carry them.

474
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,678
And…

475
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,893
They're for you.
I know how it feels to work at night.

476
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,645
You can do it.

477
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,233
Thank you.

478
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,918
Hello, sir.

479
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,686
Sir, your change.

480
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,614
Sir.

481
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,703
You gave me 50,000 won.
Here's your change.

482
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,292
And…

483
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,712
Someone gave this to me.

484
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,134
You look really drunk.

485
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:38,636
Be careful.

486
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,400
Goodness.

487
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,027
You should give that to me,

488
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,696
not throw it away.

489
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,450
Some people struggle to make ends meet.

490
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:04,871
It's yours.

491
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,623
I don't need it anymore.

492
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,750
But still…

493
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,752
That's not right. Take it.

494
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,048
Please.

495
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,635
-Take it.
-But…

496
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:25,099
Gosh, what's taking them so long?

497
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,727
Be patient.

498
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,187
-That's how
-Are you in a rush?

499
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,355
you save a life.

500
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,356
No.

501
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,650
"I will listen to you.

502
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:38,070
I'm willing to have
a conversation with you.

503
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,115
I won't leave you all alone.

504
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,659
I'll watch over you."

505
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,640
For those who have no hope

506
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,683
-and want to give up,
-Babe.

507
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,894
-Look.
-seeing a twinkling light…

508
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,437
What's wrong with him?

509
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,064
-Being watched from afar,
-What is he doing?

510
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:16,484
-or a slight brush of a finger
-Is he okay? Should we report him?

511
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,069
is more than enough.

512
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,904
Someone on the radio said

513
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,823
just watching could save lives.

514
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,910
Take out your phone, and let's wait.

515
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,293
Sir! Are you okay?

516
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:58,359
I often compare psychiatry clinics
to noodle restaurants.

517
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,820
Some prefer spicy buckwheat noodles,

518
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,907
while others prefer
cold buckwheat noodles or Hamheung-style.

519
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,201
We all have different tastes.

520
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,121
Psychiatrists are the same way.

521
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,175
Some are excellent at diagnosing,

522
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,554
while others prioritize prescriptions.

523
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:30,850
Then there are those
who are good at giving advice.

524
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,104
Even if the first clinic
you go to doesn't suit you,

525
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,231
don't lose hope.

526
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:41,152
Please give it another chance
and visit a few more.

527
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,117
I was the shadow,

528
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,745
not you.

529
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,207
And it was also me

530
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,920
who clung onto you.

531
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,703
I took them all for granted.

532
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:26,585
Waking up in the morning
and going to bed at night.

533
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:32,341
The cool breeze and the blue sky.

534
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:36,262
My heart that beat without stopping

535
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,138
and my healthy legs.

536
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,725
There was a time
when I had taken them all for granted.

537
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:52,444
JU YOUNG-DO, KANG DA-JEONG,
MUN MI-RAN, KANG TAE-JEONG

538
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:03,831
The pain you felt
in difficult relationships

539
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,710
and the sadness you felt in passing ones.

540
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,424
I'll be here for a very long time,

541
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,259
so come whenever you want.

542
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,222
Goodbye. I hope you come back.

543
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,586
There was a time
when I failed to appreciate

544
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,882
those little moments.

545
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:02,723
Your boyfriend, Patrick,
recently enlisted in the army.

546
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,934
And in your upcoming movie,
you're a soldier.

547
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,811
Was this intentional?

548
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:08,937
Of course not.

549
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:11,690
It just happened.

550
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,777
Since I play the role
of a princess in a drama,

551
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,905
I wanted to play
a completely different role.

552
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:23,369
But most of all, I chose the role
because I knew I'd have a blast.

553
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,719
-What's going on?
-Sorry.

554
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:48,185
Damn it!

555
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,440
Damn it.

556
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,403
Calm down.

557
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,161
Sir.

558
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,248
Listen carefully.

559
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,625
Put down that knife.

560
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:22,428
-Are you okay?
-What?

561
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:25,806
Yes.

562
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,855
Yes. I'm fine.

563
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,941
I'll call Detective Ko.

564
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:37,818
Okay.

565
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,697
-What?
-Let go!

566
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,490
-Get Detective Ko!
-Good job.

567
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,159
-Call him!
-Come back. Let's have something good.

568
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,244
-Call Detective Ko, you bastard!
-Bye.

569
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:49,788
Let me go! I said, let go!

570
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:50,831
Damn it.

571
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,667
I'll remember you!

572
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,503
I know the law! I'll only get six months!

573
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,465
I'll remember your face! You just watch!

574
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:01,258
Gosh.

575
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,719
If he wins a singing contest in prison,

576
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,596
he's bound to mention my name.

577
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:10,976
It's not my fault you failed
to run away and got caught twice.

578
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:15,606
I can't resign
because of bastards like you.

579
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:34,374
-A-ri.
-Yes?

580
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:38,712
Do you have an older sister?

581
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:40,506
I do. Why?

582
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:44,635
Remember when you tried
to hook Da-jeong up with a guy?

583
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:47,471
I was wondering if you had anyone for me.

584
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:53,977
Are you saying you want
a blind date with my sister?

585
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:54,978
Yes.

586
00:46:56,772 --> 00:47:00,025
Come to think of it,
I don't have a sister.

587
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,527
I'm an only child.

588
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,407
-Hello.
-Hey.

589
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:11,495
Where's Eun-ha?

590
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,872
She went to get some coffee beans.

591
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:16,959
She must've gone all the way
to Ethiopia since she's not here.

592
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,168
I see.

593
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,101
Eun-ha, I'm here.

594
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,686
Can you come down later…

595
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,940
Da-jeong, it's not what it looks like.

596
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,651
Da-jeong.

597
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:46,280
What…. What are you thinking about?

598
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,322
Wait.

599
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,157
-You're wrong.
-You're wrong.

600
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:52,411
-She's wrong.
-Right.

601
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:53,495
My eyes…

602
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:57,416
My poor eyes…

603
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,848
Come on!

604
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:15,517
I told you we shouldn't do it here.

605
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,395
This was the only place available.

606
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:23,859
Should we continue?

607
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:25,819
What are you talking about?

608
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,881
HA-NEUL VETERINARY CLINIC

609
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:50,052
How did you become a relationship virgin?

610
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:54,848
Who… Who said that?

611
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:58,268
The man upstairs said
that he had a girlfriend

612
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,854
and that you were the relationship virgin.

613
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:03,940
You see, I'm actually very…

614
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:10,364
Anyway, the real one is someone else.

615
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:14,368
Do you remember seeing a guy
with whipped cream on his face?

616
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,495
Yes. Do you mean that weird guy?

617
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:17,829
Correct.

618
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:20,707
Right?

619
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,835
Young-do, please.

620
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:26,588
-Did he change the passcode?
-The person you are trying to…

621
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,215
Young-do.

622
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,551
Young-do, pick up.

623
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,053
Young-do.

624
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,848
Please pick up.

625
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,142
Is he not home?

626
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:41,812
THOUSAND WON

627
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:44,147
One of the toughest symptoms of depression

628
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,400
is morbid lethargy.

629
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:51,613
Don't try too hard to explain it
to anyone, not even yourself.

630
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,825
Just like how
we run a fever when we catch a cold,

631
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:58,704
you can't get out of bed
simply because you're sick.

632
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,542
"Am I breathing well?

633
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:06,503
I am. That means I'm doing fine."

634
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,422
Think like this.

635
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:14,344
However, taking medication
on time is of utmost importance.

636
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:17,806
-Ms. Kim Jeong-ok is not picking up.
-Please leave a message

637
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:20,308
-I'm getting redirected to voicemail.
-after the beep.

638
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:21,935
Give it to me.

639
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,024
Hello, Ms. Kim.

640
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,610
I'm Oh Mi-kyeong, a nurse.

641
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,738
I work at Ju Young-do Psychiatry Clinic.

642
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,241
We called because you missed
your appointment today.

643
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:39,202
If you can't come,

644
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,622
we'd be more than happy
to help you over the phone.

645
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,751
Feel free to call us whenever you want,

646
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:48,795
and we'll help you.

647
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,554
That startled me.

648
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:40,764
The entrance.

649
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,646
His desk.

650
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,443
Come up.

651
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:56,571
Hello?

652
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:00,867
Come on up.

653
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,497
PSYCHIATRIST JU YOUNG-DO

654
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,255
Oh, dear.

655
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:39,906
I was a fish looking for the ocean
that was already around me.

656
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,909
I believed I'd find happiness

657
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:45,620
and feel at peace one day.

658
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,833
Were you waiting for me?

659
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,377
I didn't want you to get lost.

660
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,589
The fact that I'm breathing

661
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,675
is enough proof that I'm doing well

662
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:02,470
despite not shining brightly all the time.

663
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,849
You're the one who taught me this.

664
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,643
That's why…

665
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:09,978
What did you do today?

666
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:18,028
Do you remember that kid
whose drawing you analyzed?

667
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,446
Yes.

668
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:21,990
He returned to Canada.

669
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,117
I see.

670
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,496
He had grown on me, so I was really sad.

671
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:34,252
But he seemed
a bit excited to see his mom again.

672
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:36,713
It must've hurt.

673
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:42,093
That's why I need
some consolation right now.

674
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:50,352
Here too.

675
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,571
Did anything special happen today?

676
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,326
I can't quite remember.

677
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:09,245
But one thing for sure

678
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:12,165
is that I need a great amount of comfort.

679
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,219
I don't think that's enough.

680
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:37,857
I'm going to do my utmost best
to live as long as possible.

681
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:43,571
You reached out your hand to me
during the painful change of seasons.

682
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:48,118
You are my spring.

683
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:55,250
Even if another painful change
of seasons comes our way,

684
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:59,713
I will reach out my hand to you,
without a doubt,

685
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,632
every single time.

686
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:08,221
I am your spring.

687
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:06,654
Letting someone into your heart means

688
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:11,576
that your heart can be
easily broken by them.

689
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,953
It also means you won't

690
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:17,373
let go of them despite knowing that.

691
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,502
I don't want to get hurt.

692
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,962
I want to change, and I will.

693
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:26,007
But that's who I am right now.

694
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:28,551
Nevertheless,

695
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:31,805
I want to be happy.

696
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:36,101
Don't tell me if you don't want to.

697
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:38,561
But if you want to…

698
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,107
Anytime.

699
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:47,112
Getting heartbroken isn't a metaphor.

700
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:51,241
You merely can't see the wound.
But the injury is real.

701
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:54,327
If I were to compare this
to a car accident,

702
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:56,871
this person's arms, legs, and ribs
would all be broken.

703
00:56:57,497 --> 00:57:01,918
"Get up and walk. Why are you
lying in bed?" You can't say that.

704
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:07,674
You're still hanging in there.
I want to say you're doing so well.

705
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,300
But you merely fell.

706
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,804
You were rushing
to not keep your friend waiting.

707
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:16,015
In late spring.

708
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:19,310
The night crazy spring snow fell.

709
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,938
With the crazy weather as an excuse,

710
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:25,275
some spread their wounded wings again.

711
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:30,196
And some fluttered their wings
that had been folded for a very long time.

712
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,991
And the butterflies flew.

713
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,828
You can avoid puddles
and prevent fires together.

714
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:41,374
It doesn't have to be suffocating.
It can be nice and breezy.

715
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,296
You'll get to

716
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,048
experience that soon.

717
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:55,013
It means although they couldn't
embrace your pain,

718
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:59,350
they want to give you a warm hug
for overcoming those painful days.

719
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:02,812
It's the most comforting thing to hear.

720
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:06,858
Are you okay now?

721
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:08,610
Are you not hurting anymore?

722
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:13,531
I knew the reason

723
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:17,452
for your tears and your embrace.

724
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:20,788
"I felt so bad for you that

725
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:22,999
I couldn't just leave you behind."

726
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:27,921
That night, you embraced

727
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:31,049
the foolish me who dared

728
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:33,593
to lose you

729
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,387
because I was scared to hurt you.

730
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:42,310
In a two-hour movie,
"forever" means two hours.

731
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:45,313
I think that's enough.

732
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:50,652
"Don't blame yourself for what happened.

733
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,739
You didn't do anything wrong.

734
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:59,035
I bet your mom is grateful to you
for growing up into…

735
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:04,415
a strong woman
after experiencing something so scary."

736
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:08,253
No matter how awful my relationship was,

737
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,839
it still gave me a beautiful gem like you.

738
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,802
You are the only proof of that.

739
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,971
I can do it all over again too.

740
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:24,227
I can get slammed
by a rhino and fall again.

741
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:27,397
I can do all of that again.

742
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:31,776
For those who have no hope
and want to give up

743
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,862
seeing a twinkling light…

744
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:37,198
Being watched from afar,

745
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,742
or a slight brush of a finger

746
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,453
is more than enough.

747
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:47,125
"Maybe it all started
when that trembling wildflower

748
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,918
met a fence

749
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:52,380
and was comforted by a small, round candy.

750
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:55,675
I think that's when…

751
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,553
I fell in love with you."

752
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:02,348
You are

753
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:05,226
my spring.

754
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:10,898
WISHING A WARM SPRING
FOR THOSE IN BITTER SEASON

755
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,568
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
YOU ARE MY SPRING

756
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:18,114
