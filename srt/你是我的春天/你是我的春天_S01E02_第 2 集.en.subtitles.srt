1
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,754
18 YEARS AGO
AT A BAR

2
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,050
-I'm soju!
-I'm a peanut!

3
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,897
All right, red ginseng!

4
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,483
-Encore! Red Ginseng!
-Encore! Red Ginseng!

5
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,943
-You and you.
-All right, you!

6
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,570
Young-do. Have a drink with us.

7
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,864
Okay, I'll come back later.

8
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,616
-Where are you going?
-I'll be back.

9
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,284
-Have fun.
-You better come back.

10
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,209
RESTROOM

11
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:05,810
You.

12
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,729
Stop seeing her.

13
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,298
Hey, it's Kang Da-jeong.

14
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,180
Hey, it's her.

15
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,691
Sociopath.

16
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:18,174
Gosh. I thought I wouldn't be able
to see you before I left, but I was wrong.

17
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,885
I'm glad I waited for you.

18
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,608
You're not avoiding me
because you're embarrassed, are you?

19
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,152
Because I caught you
pretending to be busy?

20
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,279
No, I'm not.

21
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,406
Then why are your ears red?

22
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,617
Because I ate a mailbox on my way here.

23
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,287
God, that's so adorable.

24
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,333
Oh, thank you.

25
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,129
My feet were swollen
from running around all day,

26
00:04:56,212 --> 00:05:00,008
but your cheesy reply just shrank them.

27
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,968
I feel like I can go back to work now.

28
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,178
Hold on. Your feet are swollen?

29
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,598
Stop looking at my feet.

30
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,101
It must've been a long day.

31
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,562
Why did you touch my head?

32
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,398
Will you accept this rose?

33
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,484
More trash?

34
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:22,155
You said flowers wither,
are prickly, and can't be recycled.

35
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,657
So I brought this. It's a paper rose.

36
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,617
Here.

37
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,246
It won't wither, it's not prickly,

38
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,456
and it's recyclable.

39
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,708
You could also jot things down on it.

40
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,098
EPISODE 2

41
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,303
Maybe I shouldn't fix it after all.

42
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:42,235
PSYCHIATRIST JU YOUNG-DO

43
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,975
-Hi.
-Hello.

44
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,274
Yes! I got the king worm!

45
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,734
Check this out. Hey, look.

46
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,326
-Hey.
-What?

47
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,829
-Come with me, please?
-I said no.

48
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,540
-You just need to drive.
-I don't want to.

49
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,083
Fight outside.

50
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,960
If it's urgent, take her.

51
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,170
She's useless.

52
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,298
I can hear you. What is it?

53
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,884
She drives 80km/h on the highway.
Forget it.

54
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,135
What's wrong with that?

55
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,429
You shouldn't have gotten
your license revoked.

56
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,890
-I had no accidents for a decade.
-I'm repenting.

57
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,766
Then don't mock my safe driving.

58
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,895
I really need to see her today!

59
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,230
Then just let me drive you!

60
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,069
Who do you need to see?

61
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,491
Date of birth.

62
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,327
-November 11, 1988.
-Not you.

63
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,210
We're here because of him.

64
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,088
-Yes, me.
-No, it's you.

65
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,757
Date of birth.

66
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,638
-I was born in 1988.
-Born 1988.

67
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,890
On March 29.

68
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,642
That's the lunar date.

69
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:44,190
Everyone around you has it easy
and walks on easy paths,

70
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:48,986
but every path you've faced
is uphill, isn't it?

71
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,865
You climb with all your might
lest you slip, and when you finally see…

72
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:57,370
Right, a ladder.
When you finally see a ladder,

73
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,372
someone drags you down.

74
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,833
It could be your parents

75
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,254
or a guy you're seeing.

76
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,214
It's not that bad.

77
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:10,550
Hey.

78
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,719
What would that make my mom?

79
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,680
Endure a bit more pain.

80
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,182
There's more pain?

81
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,476
My sweet child.

82
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,897
I'm a little too old to be called a child.

83
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,023
Listen carefully.

84
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,697
There's something glistening
in front of you,

85
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,158
and darkness below your feet.

86
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,873
And there's a sharp sword in the wind.

87
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,634
-I made the appointment,
-She's gifted?

88
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,761
-but she didn't care.
-She only talked nonsense.

89
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,847
I could've just bought a Magic 8-Ball.

90
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,390
I could've visited Young-do.

91
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,559
The ball would've given me
the same answers.

92
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,352
Young-do is much more competent.

93
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,689
He guessed everything about you right.

94
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:10,776
Not really.

95
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,778
"Not really"?

96
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,865
You grabbed him by his collar
because you were surprised.

97
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,827
A legless bird, a trash magnet,
a black cat, and a red foxtail.

98
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,455
You probably watered them
until their roots rotted.

99
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:26,334
Whether it's dating or growing plants,
you give them every piece of you.

100
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,711
Don't see him.

101
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,299
Competent, my foot.

102
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,302
"Year 2003,

103
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,929
Anam-dong, high school student."

104
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,599
What are you looking for?

105
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,895
I'm not getting anything.
Should I search all of Seoul?

106
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,105
What are you looking for?

107
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,817
I saw something eighteen years ago.

108
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,235
And it's bothering me.

109
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,947
But why now?

110
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,158
Goodness.

111
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,577
You're eagerly looking for a case

112
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,038
that hasn't even been known.

113
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,581
What a proactive investigation.

114
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,084
-You're a real detective now.
-Hey.

115
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,877
Don't do that. Don't.

116
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,757
This is the final round.

117
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,425
Ahn Ga-yeong or Jeon Ji-hyun?

118
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,178
This is hard. Who should I pick?

119
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,722
Ahn Ga-yeong is my type, but…

120
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,522
She has a bad reputation.
Jeon Ji-hyun is perfect,

121
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,815
but she likes hiking.

122
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,110
I prefer the beach to the mountains.

123
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,362
Okay. I'm sorry.

124
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,155
Okay.

125
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:43,035
You think I'm your slave, you asshole?
How dare you swear at me?

126
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,787
My manager will hear about this.

127
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:56,132
I can swear at the customers
after they've hung up, right?

128
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:00,886
Welcome…

129
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,891
A-ri, I'm taking out the trash.
Can you cover for me?

130
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,560
Okay.

131
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,853
No, let me.

132
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,484
What would you like to order?

133
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,279
There's no tiramisu, baby.

134
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,407
You're right. Do you have any?

135
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,200
-Not yet.
-Do you know when you will?

136
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,493
-No.
-Can you check?

137
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,830
Hold on.

138
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,958
-Have a bite of this cheesecake.
-No.

139
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,376
Why not?

140
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,629
Hello, sir.
When will you deliver the tiramisu?

141
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,173
You told me not to order any.

142
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,841
I understand, sir.

143
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:42,052
Why are you using honorifics?
Who are you talking to?

144
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,305
Okay, sir.

145
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,347
What?

146
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,266
Hello?

147
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,852
Eun-ha.

148
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,896
I'm afraid they won't be delivering any.

149
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,981
Not tomorrow. Not the day after tomorrow.

150
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,318
We won't be getting any.

151
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,822
-But I came here for that.
-What should we do?

152
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,240
How about carrot cake?

153
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,076
I hate carrots. Give them to the rabbits.

154
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,037
Okay, the rabbits can have them.

155
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,788
Bad carrot cake. Go away.

156
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,584
I'm feeling down.
Should I have a macchiato?

157
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,919
What if I gain weight?

158
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,504
We can go run after this.

159
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,923
I hate running. Leave that to the horses.

160
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,716
Okay. Run, horses!

161
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,635
Welcome.

162
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,061
Da-jeong won't be getting off work
anytime soon.

163
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,606
I purposely came early.

164
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,567
I don't want her to think I'm a stalker
for real.

165
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,447
We allowed you to film at our hotel
despite the inconvenience

166
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,699
because we wanted
to promote something as well.

167
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,285
And it's all written here.

168
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,330
"List of things that can't be replaced.
Number three, amenities."

169
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,500
That's why we're asking you
for permission like this.

170
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:59,004
The writer hates product placements,
so we barely added in that condition.

171
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,131
-Hello.
-Could you please help us out?

172
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,509
I empathize with you

173
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,553
-as a fellow laborer.
-Hello.

174
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,180
But that item is being used by our…

175
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,474
competition.

176
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,561
Hello.

177
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,564
Let's make this quick.

178
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,524
I didn't get much sleep last night,

179
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,986
so my eyebags will get worse and worse.
It won't be easy to touch it up.

180
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,739
Why don't you just add a scene of me
washing my hands tomorrow?

181
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:29,159
"It's fragrant and moisturizing."
I'll improvise a line.

182
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,745
-But the writer said--
-Let me talk to them.

183
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,664
Here.

184
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,551
Good luck.

185
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,221
Oh. Thanks.

186
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:53,684
Hello? Hi, have you eaten yet?

187
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:58,147
You had jjamppong? God, I love it too.

188
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,775
What did you have for lunch?

189
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,236
Donuts.

190
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,499
I also wanted to drink some water,

191
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,461
but my mom didn't let me.

192
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,340
See? She keeps telling
absurd lies like this, doctor.

193
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,467
When did I not let you drink water?

194
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,553
And what donut?
You're not eating anything lately.

195
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,680
Why?

196
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,517
-Well…
-The doctor

197
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,687
told me not to eat.

198
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,106
That's ridiculous.

199
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:46,111
She decided to go on a diet on her own.
That's why.

200
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:51,200
She keeps telling ridiculous lies.
This is a mental illness, right?

201
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,912
Have you been dieting for a while?

202
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,538
Sorry?

203
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,249
Stop playing innocent.

204
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,170
She's always on a diet

205
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,755
but secretly eats.

206
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:06,966
I see.

207
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:12,721
Brain damage due to lack of nutrition
could lead to short-term memory loss.

208
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,933
It's called Korsakoff's syndrome.

209
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,935
Since she can't remember,

210
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,521
she makes up replies
with things around her.

211
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,982
Such an illness really exists?

212
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:34,576
Do you remember the color
of the taxi you rode today?

213
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,413
-Purple.
-I see.

214
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:41,458
-What about yesterday's taxi?
-Sky blue.

215
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,839
It's neither a mental illness nor lying.

216
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,299
Have a well-balanced diet

217
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,219
and plenty of vitamin B.

218
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,225
I asked to have a word with you

219
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,228
because you seem to lack trust in her.

220
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:06,108
We've spent a hefty amount of money
on diet pills.

221
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:10,320
But to no avail.
She always eats behind my back.

222
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:14,908
At times, she eats five packs
of ramyeon at once.

223
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,831
No one trusts her. Not even herself.

224
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,292
But she's desperate to lose weight.

225
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:27,588
What do you think is the easiest way
to relieve her stress?

226
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:28,797
Eating.

227
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,760
If someone tells you
that you'll trip for sure

228
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,803
and watches intently from the side,

229
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,722
you'll stiffen trying not to trip.

230
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:41,226
And it'll only make you trip more easily
and get injured more severely.

231
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,023
I know you're frustrated,

232
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,817
but stop pointing out her mistakes.

233
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,778
Support her.

234
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,570
PSYCHIATRIST JU YOUNG-DO

235
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,496
What happened to the pot I gave you?

236
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,898
See? It's over there.

237
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,027
Exactly. Why is it over there?

238
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,341
Hurry up.
I have to see a patient in ten minutes.

239
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,759
Don't you worry.

240
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,886
A suicidal person
will still remain suicidal,

241
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,513
and a lunatic will still be crazy
even if you're late.

242
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,641
This is more urgent.

243
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,352
Go consult your psychiatrist, not me.

244
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:31,146
Since I know you well already,

245
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,523
I won't listen to what you say as it is

246
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,734
and will nag you about the most trivial--

247
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,194
There's someone I like.

248
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:43,825
Okay.

249
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,411
Can you not make it obvious
that you're happy?

250
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,332
If it doesn't work out, I may whine again
about feeling suicidal.

251
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,800
He fell head over heels for me,
but it makes no sense.

252
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:03,095
He's an idol singer.
He's so young and popular. He's crazy.

253
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,557
I don't know many idol groups.

254
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,394
BTS, EXO, K Men.

255
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,895
-That's all--
-It's K Men.

256
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,816
I only know one member.

257
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,318
-Patrick? The most popular--
-It's him.

258
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,990
But you're just as popular.

259
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,616
-The age gap isn't--
-Nine years.

260
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,159
It's not even a decade.

261
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,371
I actually subtracted one year
because I was embarrassed.

262
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,417
Well, in any case, he's an adult.

263
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,752
-He must've finished military--
-Not yet.

264
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,004
Oh, dear.

265
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,256
Should I not go for him?

266
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,676
Why not? Because of what I just said?

267
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,760
Excuse me.

268
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,513
Don't you know me? Have you forgotten?

269
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,807
I'm like a ticking time bomb.

270
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,019
If he finds out what I'm like,
he'll run for his life.

271
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,437
He'll push me away.

272
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,605
I'll be too old and frail to get back up.

273
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,858
I'll stay on the ground
for a very long time.

274
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:02,237
It's ridiculous
that I still want to pursue this.

275
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,447
I must be crazy.

276
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,534
It's been well over a decade
since you truly liked someone, right?

277
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,831
We got married six years ago,
and I actually liked you.

278
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,958
And you married me because I was suicidal.

279
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,419
That's not true.

280
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,171
I see.

281
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,048
Is that why we slept in separate rooms?

282
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,425
Is that why whenever I came to you
feeling horny,

283
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,094
you'd flee to the study and lock the door?

284
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,058
I don't think you're intimidated
by the fact

285
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,935
that he's young and famous.

286
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,272
You're just looking for reasons

287
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:39,941
not to fall in love
since you're scared of getting hurt.

288
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,238
Is that why
you're not dating anyone either?

289
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,324
Because you're afraid?

290
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:06,885
Hello.

291
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,471
Please sit down.

292
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,933
The biggest fear you feel
when you fall in water

293
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,478
is not that you can't swim

294
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:20,315
but that you don't know
how deep the water is.

295
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,112
So the fear grows for those who have

296
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,198
sunk deep into the water.

297
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,118
The same goes for rivers,

298
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,495
seas,

299
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,997
and love.

300
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:47,843
Okay.

301
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,140
Okay.

302
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,190
This time, Mr. Hong bought me rice cakes.

303
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,734
Now I'm craving some.

304
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,238
But why rice cakes?

305
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,824
Does he want to get all sticky with me?

306
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:15,162
I don't want to talk with someone
who has her mind in the gutter.

307
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:18,206
What do you mean?
I'm just talking about rice cakes.

308
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,000
Your mind is in the gutter.

309
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,210
Fine.

310
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,464
Rice cakes.

311
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,467
Bean rice cakes.

312
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:35,599
Mom, please. Someone might hear you.

313
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,143
How's it going with the tangerine guy?

314
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,479
Nothing's going on.

315
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:44,900
Why? Does he not look handsome anymore?

316
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,610
Does he have nasty drinking habits?

317
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:48,862
It's not that.

318
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:52,199
I'm neither head over heels for him

319
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,367
nor do I see the need to date anyone.

320
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:19,226
JU YOUNG-DO PSYCHIATRY CLINIC

321
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,359
There's a package for you.

322
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,244
Hello.

323
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,372
This came to my clinic.

324
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,083
I'm sorry. Why did it go there?

325
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,543
-It looks heavy. I'll--
-It's heavy. Let me--

326
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,170
-It's okay.
-It's okay.

327
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,297
-Let me--
-Let me--

328
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,111
It's not heavy. I can do it.

329
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,071
I didn't say anything.

330
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,199
All right, then.

331
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,257
The pot's looking fine.

332
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,968
Yes. I give it a lot of delicious food.

333
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,428
I feed it Coke and coffee.

334
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,054
Hold on.

335
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,854
Don't worry.

336
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,898
I give it Diet Coke
and decaffeinated coffee.

337
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:53,278
Oh, dear.

338
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,203
Here.

339
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,456
For me?

340
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,048
-Do you want me to drink this?
-Yes.

341
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,559
Now that you've had some to drink…

342
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:41,409
Can you hold it more firmly?
It's very unstable.

343
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,454
You must love camping.

344
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:47,791
Don't you dare do it again.

345
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:49,751
Do what?

346
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,128
Weren't you going to analyze me again?

347
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,340
Not really.

348
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:01,304
Speaking of which, I have some questions.

349
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,722
No, thanks.

350
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,725
Then just one question.

351
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:12,148
Do you know
which high school Mr. Chae went to?

352
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,527
Why do you ask?

353
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,655
He looked familiar. So do you know?

354
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:19,948
No.

355
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,451
I see.

356
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,165
It's my turn to ask a question, right?

357
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:31,876
We never agreed on that.

358
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,215
Why did you tell me not to date him?

359
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,430
When you met him,

360
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,099
have you ever found
anything odd about him?

361
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,270
Something that got on your nerves.

362
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,280
You can learn more about someone

363
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:04,200
when they're naked
than when they're wearing something.

364
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:11,082
The absence itself tells you
what's important.

365
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:17,964
Do you find it odd that I'm not bothered
by anything about him?

366
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,841
Is that why you told me not to see him?

367
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,136
I want to tell you in detail,

368
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,929
but I'm still looking into it.

369
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:30,018
Gosh, I've gotten much more curious
than I already was.

370
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,605
Why do you not want me to date him?

371
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,320
Anyway, this is…

372
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,792
TARP INSTALLATION MANUAL

373
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,427
Do you like me?

374
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,513
Sorry?

375
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,849
Why would you suddenly…

376
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,643
That's… Why do you think so?

377
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,520
That's most plausible.

378
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,273
You suddenly tell me not to date him
but won't tell me why.

379
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,360
Look at you right now.
You're so flustered.

380
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,403
Oh, dear.

381
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,700
-If that's it--
-That's not it.

382
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,829
You're looking away.

383
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,165
This is a normal reaction.

384
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:39,128
Those who are lying look you in the eye
to see if you believe them.

385
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,589
I even wrote a book about it.

386
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,842
Check it out. I'll lend it to you.

387
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,136
Never mind then.

388
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,515
Thanks for your help.

389
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,934
I've been meaning to tell you this.

390
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:58,273
This tarp should be fixed to the ground.

391
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:03,319
Keep it here, and you'll find it in Busan
if a typhoon hits.

392
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,405
A legless bird

393
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,407
and a poleless tarp.

394
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,537
No way.

395
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,513
Either pick it up or work out.

396
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,391
It's not that easy to decide.

397
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,479
Then just get hit.

398
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,448
He came by yesterday.

399
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,535
I never asked.

400
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,087
What are these?

401
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:09,010
He asked us to treat you like a customer
and not like a friend who has free coffee.

402
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:12,555
He said he doesn't want you to think
he's a stalker and will be more careful.

403
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,266
He came to say bye
since he won't be coming for some time.

404
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:31,658
What was that for?

405
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,243
You must've been really mean to him.

406
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,537
That once happy-go-lucky guy
looked miserable.

407
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,457
-I wasn't mean to him.
-Of course not.

408
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,626
I bet you were really harsh
on him instead.

409
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:46,506
You dated every single guy I didn't
approve of, and you turn him down?

410
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,217
Where do you think you're going?

411
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,178
To bed.

412
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,348
-It's 4:30 p.m.
-I know.

413
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,110
You said flowers wither,
are prickly, and can't be recycled.

414
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,278
So I brought this. It's a paper rose.

415
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,280
It won't wither, it's not prickly,

416
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,407
and it's recyclable.

417
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,617
You could also jot things down on it.

418
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,621
Have you ever seen a lunatic pick herbs?

419
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,333
They'd be digging at one place

420
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,336
then pulling herbs out at another.

421
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,549
No, I haven't.

422
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,677
I've been like that lunatic lately.

423
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,098
I was greedy

424
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,392
then afraid

425
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,061
then doubtful.

426
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,485
I thought about why I was feeling
this way.

427
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:53,322
It turned out I was feeling uncomfortable.

428
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:59,412
I felt pressured to reciprocate
your feelings.

429
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,831
You don't need to do that.

430
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,792
I like how things are right now.

431
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,383
But I don't.

432
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:23,728
It's not that I'm kind.
I just don't want to be the antagonist.

433
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,940
It's easier to be the victim.

434
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,491
I know it's wrong and unhealthy
to have this kind of relationship.

435
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,659
I want to change, and I will.

436
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,960
But that's who I am right now.

437
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,426
I'll make the same mistakes

438
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,096
if I see someone right now.

439
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,722
Then…

440
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,267
you can change.

441
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,992
I wish that was possible.

442
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,922
The problem is

443
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:36,592
that the feeling of excitement
comes before trust does.

444
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:40,847
And…

445
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,976
I realized how terrifying

446
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:48,146
that rash feeling of excitement can be.

447
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,292
Letting someone into your heart means

448
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,629
that your heart can be
easily broken by them.

449
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,298
No way.

450
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,341
Out of the blue?

451
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,388
It also means you won't let go of them

452
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:25,725
despite knowing that.

453
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,487
I bought tangerines, kids!

454
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,907
Dad!

455
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,617
Goodness, my dear son.

456
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,453
Have you been well?

457
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,915
All right, let's go inside.

458
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,793
-Dad.
-Let's sit down and eat.

459
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,629
Thank you.

460
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,637
I don't want to get hurt.

461
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:08,559
I don't want to foolishly bring up
my painful past.

462
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,812
Nevertheless,

463
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,774
I want to be happy.

464
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,918
FLESH AND BLOOD

465
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,842
Yes?

466
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,011
Guess who's here.

467
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,640
-Is Mom in Seoul?
-No.

468
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,184
It's the tangerine guy.

469
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,861
Why would he go there?

470
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,697
Beats me. He just came.

471
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,873
When did he arrive?
How long will he be there?

472
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,834
I'm not sure.

473
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,919
-About 30 minutes--
-No, don't tell me.

474
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,380
-Okay. Then I'll go--
-Is he alone?

475
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:23,009
-No, don't tell me.
-Fine.

476
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,552
-Then I'll go--
-Who is he with?

477
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,846
No, don't tell me.

478
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,014
Tell me.

479
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,349
No, don't. You better not tell me.

480
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,350
Who is he with?

481
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,730
I'll send you a text.
It's your choice to read it or not.

482
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:36,856
I'm going back to work.

483
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,878
You're not seeing things.

484
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,547
You're not drunk.

485
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:10,389
Can you come out for a minute?

486
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,647
I was avoiding you.

487
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,775
You shouldn't have come.

488
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,444
Are you not happy to see me?

489
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,448
What do you think?

490
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,704
I just don't know what you see in me.

491
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:38,334
I know I'm a decent person,

492
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,544
-but you're head over heels.
-I missed you.

493
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,552
Did you miss me?

494
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,321
Well…

495
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,367
That snowy night…

496
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:16,831
With the TV

497
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,291
and tangerines…

498
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,837
In that dream of yours,

499
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,008
was there a cat too?

500
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,434
Because I'm planning to get a cat later.

501
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,904
Yes.

502
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,449
Definitely.

503
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,160
There are many of them.

504
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,765
Those with
antisocial personality disorder,

505
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:20,394
also called sociopaths,
are different from psychopaths.

506
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,189
There's nothing wrong with
the structure of their brain.

507
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:26,817
However, studies have shown
that their cerebral cortex

508
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,570
reacts differently to average people's.

509
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:34,366
When average people read
"mother" and "strictness,"

510
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:38,913
they become more sensitive to the former
because it's related to their emotions.

511
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,539
A STUDY ON THE CHARACTERISTICS
OF A SOCIOPATH

512
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,542
When this individual read
the word "mother,"

513
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,961
blood flow increased
in their temporal lobe.

514
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:50,633
Such a reaction usually happens
when you're calculating numbers.

515
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:54,011
In other words,
sociopaths need to recognize and calculate

516
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:57,515
before expressing emotional reactions
to look like a normal person.

517
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,559
The problem here is that they're quick.

518
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:08,442
So much so that they often look
much more empathetic than most people.

519
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,533
How was the movie?

520
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,409
I hated it.

521
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:20,412
Masterpiece, my foot.
It was a train wreck.

522
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,705
Was it that bad?

523
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:25,960
They copied Rain Man and The Shining

524
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:29,088
then inserted tearjerkers.

525
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,382
It took up all the spots

526
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,759
so no other movies could premiere.

527
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:36,262
Gosh, you must be a film enthusiast.

528
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,598
That's why I have so many complaints too.

529
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,976
This is why old movies are the best.

530
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,228
They aren't imitations.

531
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,564
Right. I forgot you like old movies.

532
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,567
Did I tell you that?

533
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:53,320
You sing that song at the cafe
while secretly making juice.

534
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,030
What was it? "Moon River."

535
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,991
But you only know two words.

536
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,826
What are you talking about?

537
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:03,414
"A-ri, don't tell Eun-ha.
I'm going to add a lot of strawberries."

538
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,921
Were you staring at me all day
at the cafe?

539
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,300
Didn't you know? I didn't even
watch the movie just now either.

540
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,723
How could you only know
two words to a song?

541
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,268
Be honest. There are songs you only know
one word to, right?

542
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:26,562
She

543
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:32,359
English is the only foreign language
you speak, right?

544
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:37,114
I speak three different languages at work.

545
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,617
Don't get cute.

546
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:41,619
What did you just say?

547
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:51,503
Where are you going?
The parking lot's over there.

548
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:56,550
You're not going home, right?
Because that's the wrong direction.

549
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,641
I know.

550
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:11,857
Your ears are red again.

551
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,652
-I ate a mailbox.
-That's not tasty.

552
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,696
-Do you like coffee candy?
-Strawberries are the best.

553
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,157
Right? I should throw it away.

554
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,242
-Why would you…
-Let's go.

555
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:26,080
Why would you put it in his hoodie?

556
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:28,290
Gosh.

557
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,751
Why do you keep doing that?

558
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:34,380
-Then have this.
-I want a strawberry one.

559
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:37,132
-It won't take long.
-Okay.

560
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:44,723
Isn't it awkward
to sit face to face quietly with me?

561
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,559
No, it's not awkward at all.

562
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:50,062
Then why are you grabbing your bag
so tightly?

563
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,065
I'm just covering my belly.

564
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,150
But you're not fat.

565
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,069
Where are you looking?

566
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:06,912
What?

567
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:08,997
Never seen someone drinking?

568
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,291
It's not that.

569
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:14,294
I've never seen someone
with such pretty lips drinking.

570
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,716
How do you like it here?

571
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,553
I feel quite dispirited
since you hated the movie.

572
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:27,182
I hated the movie,
but I enjoyed watching it with you.

573
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:30,310
The popcorn and the Coke were tasty.

574
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,687
This place is nice too.

575
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,653
-Who ordered coffee?
-I did.

576
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,531
Thank you.

577
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:47,244
Excuse me. Is that a music box?

578
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:48,871
Yes. Isn't it unique?

579
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,873
-Would you like to see?
-Yes.

580
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,878
Thank you.

581
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:08,307
Do you like music boxes?
Should we go get one?

582
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,187
The noodles are cooked perfectly.

583
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,734
I'm glad I came.

584
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:25,824
About that high school incident
I was looking for…

585
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,160
Yes. Did you find anything?

586
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:31,371
Wait. What is it you saw?

587
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:36,043
A high school kid was washing his clothes
in a bar's restroom.

588
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:38,754
I think there was blood on them.

589
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,006
There was blood on the tissue.

590
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:43,467
Maybe he fought and got a bloody nose.

591
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:45,469
Maybe.

592
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:49,932
But he was only wearing his underwear.

593
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:54,478
Only his underwear? In a bar's restroom?

594
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:55,729
Yes.

595
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,399
We locked eyes through the mirror,

596
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,610
and he kept staring at me.

597
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:04,696
He was neither embarrassed nor flustered.

598
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,659
Damn it. I got goosebumps.

599
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,705
And I think
I felt a similar gaze recently.

600
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:17,751
If that's true, you must be wary of them.

601
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:21,213
Those who are shameless
are the most dangerous.

602
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:22,631
They're capable of anything.

603
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,612
-What are you doing here?
-Did I startle you?

604
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:47,990
This isn't right.

605
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:52,536
-Do this again, and I'll teach you--
-I'd love to be taught a lesson or two.

606
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:05,966
I knew you'd get upset.

607
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:15,434
I'll wait outside.
Call me when you get off.

608
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,538
You got off work early today.

609
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,879
Are you mad at me?

610
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,635
You should be thankful I work at a hotel.

611
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,053
Had I been a doctor,

612
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:53,847
you were pretty much grabbing my hand
during surgery.

613
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:55,140
Had I been a detective,

614
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:57,768
you were whispering in my ear
during an interrogation.

615
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:01,605
I'm not mad, but don't ever do that again.

616
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,358
I won't.

617
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,279
I don't know what I was thinking.

618
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:19,331
Did you expect me
to be surprised and happy?

619
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:21,750
Did you expect me to giggle
in front of everyone,

620
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:25,837
shout out, "Yes, he's my man,"
and kiss you?

621
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,342
Is that what you usually imagine?

622
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:40,852
No, it's not.

623
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,605
I didn't know you liked that.

624
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,699
A date?

625
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,675
This is bad.

626
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:15,303
Excuse me for a minute.

627
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:30,110
Are you going to keep chasing me?

628
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,362
Your boyfriend might leave.

629
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:39,244
He's not my boyfriend.

630
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,371
Keep this a secret.

631
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:44,374
Fine. I'll just tell people
you're not official yet.

632
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:49,671
Damn it.

633
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,072
May I clean up your table?

634
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:42,576
-Sorry?
-Oh, never mind.

635
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,749
I heard you went to a conference.

636
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,417
Is this for me?

637
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,419
No, it's for my mom in Gangneung.

638
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,464
Is that your hometown?

639
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:40,216
No, it's at the southeast
of Ulleung Island.

640
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,639
Why do you keep
asking meaningless questions?

641
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,394
You must have something to say to me.

642
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,564
-Or something to complain about.
-What makes you think so?

643
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:58,735
"I'm tearing this instead
since I can't rip your mouth."

644
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,820
That's the vibe I'm getting.

645
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,535
You caught me.

646
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,873
I'll answer your questions honestly.
Go on.

647
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,219
Last time,

648
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:30,225
you said you were looking for an answer.

649
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,774
About the reason you didn't want me
to date him.

650
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,070
Did you find it?

651
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:50,078
No, not yet.

652
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:54,374
It's taking ages.

653
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,509
-Are you doing okay?
-Not bad.

654
00:55:06,302 --> 00:55:07,220
Oh, dear.

655
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:11,808
What's wrong?

656
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:15,061
-Sorry?
-Whenever you say that,

657
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:18,481
it means "Goodness, no way, oh, my god.

658
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,067
This is bad. Oh, no.
What the hell's going on? Damn it."

659
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,153
It includes all of them.

660
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,156
I clearly said not bad.

661
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:35,457
You don't ask that question
to someone who's obviously doing fine.

662
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:41,337
When you ask it to someone
who seems to be struggling,

663
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,424
and they say they're doing well,

664
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:47,135
they're trying to think positively.

665
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:51,848
"Fine" means that they have no energy to
talk about it and want you to stop asking.

666
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,185
"Not bad" means

667
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:59,105
that something's definitely going on,

668
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:02,150
but they don't want to explain it to you.

669
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:08,615
You're going overboard.

670
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,788
Don't tell me if you don't want to.

671
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:17,957
But if you want to…

672
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:25,256
Anytime.

673
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:37,936
Okay.

674
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:42,732
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

675
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,028
-Then I'll--
-Then I'll--

676
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:56,579
Thank you for this.

677
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,489
So I brought this. It's a paper rose.

678
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:14,908
It won't wither, it's not prickly,

679
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,242
and it's recyclable.

680
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,828
You could also jot things down on it.

681
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,802
YONGSAN STATION, 99, 7641

682
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,123
Hello, Detective Ko.

683
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:47,208
I'm sending you a photo.

684
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,836
Tell me if you recognize any of them.

685
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:50,795
Sure.

686
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:04,058
I know both of them. Why?

687
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:09,314
We received a tip-off
that he's the killer.

688
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,857
So we're looking into it.

689
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,235
Han River Patrol Division arrived
at his house.

690
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:17,113
The door was open,
and there was a knife in the drawer.

691
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:18,573
The tip-off must be true.

692
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:23,077
Detective Park, come with me.
I'm on my way.

693
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:37,425
YONGSAN STATION, 99, 7641

694
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:48,811
Hello.

695
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:54,901
Do you know Ms. Kang Da-jeong's number?

696
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:56,694
No.

697
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:37,819
STORAGE LOCKER

698
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,134
Do you like music boxes?

699
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,385
Should we go get one?

700
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:07,849
There's a movie called Music Box,
and it had one similar to this.

701
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:10,393
Is it a musical?
Do you want to go watch it?

702
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:14,439
It's an old movie about former Nazis
getting punished.

703
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:16,023
That doesn't suit the title.

704
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,862
Do you know Edgar Allan Poe's novel
called The Black Cat?

705
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:23,489
I do. It's a scary one.

706
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:25,950
In the movie,

707
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:29,579
the music box is like the black cat.

708
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:33,750
The music box points to the real criminal

709
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:35,960
at the end

710
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:38,713
and prevents the truth

711
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,424
from getting buried.

712
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:48,139
INCOMING CALL

713
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:56,118
06M 5381

714
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:32,715
I FINALLY FOUND YOU

715
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:00,785
Who is Chae Jun?

716
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:03,037
Is he even a real person?

717
01:08:03,537 --> 01:08:05,498
None of this is your fault.

718
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:07,500
I will be by your side.

719
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:11,754
You merely can't see the wound.
But the injury is real.

720
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:14,340
He shouldn't have done
something like that.

721
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:17,301
Everything falls into place so perfectly,
it's creepy.

722
01:08:17,384 --> 01:08:18,594
Thank you for everything.

723
01:08:18,677 --> 01:08:21,347
Though you probably
already figured it out.

724
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:24,558
I don't think Choi Jeong-min
is the real culprit.

725
01:08:25,142 --> 01:08:26,936
There's something strange about it all.

726
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:31,107
