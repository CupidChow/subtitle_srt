1
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,746
You're back already?
What about the birthday party?

2
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,423
Da-jeong could've been more patient.

3
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,468
What did you say?

4
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,387
It's not like he wants to be sick.

5
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,513
She's not mad at that.

6
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:21,015
He was running away.

7
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,226
He made her say all those hurtful things.

8
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,563
Well, Young-do was just worried
that Da-jeong would have a hard time

9
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,564
because of him.

10
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,650
Even I studied about heart transplants
when I'm not close to him.

11
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:34,696
He'll always have to take meds,
might need surgery or get sick again.

12
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,032
Do you think
she wasn't aware of this when I was?

13
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,493
She could've hung onto him again.

14
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,413
What's the point of that?
All he wants to do is to run away.

15
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,666
Young-do has always been like that.

16
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,170
He can't stand hurting others,
so he'd rather hurt--

17
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:53,882
If sacrificing his life
to help other people is what Mr. Ju does,

18
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:58,887
making sure everyone has what they need
is what Da-jeong does.

19
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,181
She gives up her bed
to a woman who barges in

20
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,142
and opens the door for her when she wants

21
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,185
to get up and leave out of the blue.

22
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,813
-Stop it.
-Why should I?

23
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,485
Why did you have to make Mr. Ju move here?
It's your fault.

24
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:15,945
So you want to play that game?

25
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,615
You encouraged her
to date that guy, Choi Jeong-min.

26
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,701
They fell for each other
when Young-do was trying to help her.

27
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,202
So this is all my fault?

28
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,831
-I don't want to talk about this.
-Why not?

29
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:31,085
He's not the only reason
you're so upset right now.

30
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,214
You've been stressed about Dad's visit,
so you're lashing out at this.

31
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,216
Be quiet. Mr. Ju is coming.

32
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,343
Young-do is coming.

33
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,933
-Hey. You're here.
-Hey.

34
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,185
You're all here.

35
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,812
We were all going to have some coffee.

36
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,731
No, we already had some.

37
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,859
Let's have dinner tomorrow.
Something came up.

38
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,945
-Sure.
-Let's do that then.

39
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,197
Tomorrow it is, then.
It won't change your age.

40
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,406
All right, then.

41
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,826
-Bye.
-Bye.

42
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,509
Mom.

43
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,136
Yes.

44
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,433
Do I have to love someone?

45
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:32,730
Of course.

46
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,358
Everyone should.

47
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,444
Why?

48
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,742
We need a bigger purpose
than just eating, sleeping,

49
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,079
peeing, and pooping.

50
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,711
I thought you didn't believe in love.

51
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,470
How could I not?

52
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,098
You're proof that I do.

53
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,851
I thought…

54
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,397
I was proof that falling in love

55
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,984
with the wrong person
will complicate life.

56
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,486
Like the Little Mermaid.

57
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,532
Who told you that?

58
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,369
No matter how awful my relationship was,

59
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,748
it still gave me a beautiful gem like you.

60
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,793
You are the only proof of that.

61
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,348
If I'm the only proof,
what does that make Tae-jeong?

62
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,144
Well, he's proof

63
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,482
that you should be careful
after daytime drinking.

64
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,611
He's like a life lesson.

65
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,617
I'll tell Tae-jeong what you said.

66
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,332
Go to sleep.

67
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,250
Okay.

68
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,260
EPISODE 13

69
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,266
She installed another door.

70
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,729
Gosh. This is nice and sturdy.

71
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,820
Hey, Mun Mi-ran.

72
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,321
What brings my in-law here?

73
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:46,614
In your dreams.

74
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,700
I said I'll never let Da-jeong
be your daughter-in-law.

75
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,787
Why are you snooping around here?

76
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,498
This is my building.

77
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,960
My daughter lives here.

78
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,382
Gosh.

79
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,390
You look exactly the same.
You haven't aged a bit.

80
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:16,102
Who are you to judge?
Have you seen yourself in the mirror?

81
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,021
Is Da-jeong still sleeping?

82
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,441
Wake her up, so I can say hi.

83
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,402
Keep it down. She just fell asleep.

84
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,530
It's been a while since we last met.
Let me see her.

85
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,656
Hey.

86
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,617
The moment you wake her up,
I'll crack your head open.

87
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,831
Come have coffee downstairs.

88
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,792
Who said you could boss me around?
Don't tell me what to do.

89
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,756
Back in the day, no tenant would
talk to their building owner this way.

90
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,384
This is unheard of.

91
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,929
Back in the day,
a rich snob like you would have been

92
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,556
stabbed by someone

93
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,141
and found dead in some alley.

94
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,769
As there were no security cameras then,
the killer would be at large.

95
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,396
So you would be some spirit

96
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,065
roaming around this world
because of an unsettled grudge.

97
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,526
How dare you go on a power trip?

98
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,030
What did I do so wrong?
I just wanted to see her.

99
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:12,325
Go look after your own kids.
You skipped Eun-ha's graduation.

100
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,620
You're still on that?
I couldn't be in two places at once.

101
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,997
Heard of cloning?
One for Cheol-do's graduation.

102
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,082
Another one for Eun-ha's graduation.

103
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,753
Don't ever get fresh with me.
Watch out for your head.

104
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,215
Goodness.

105
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,926
Where's Dr. Ju?

106
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:30,968
No honorifics?

107
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,094
I own this building.

108
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,262
Again,

109
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,597
no honorifics.

110
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,058
-Are you a nurse here?
-Yes. What do you want?

111
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,482
My patients must be very upset.

112
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,692
You need to be quiet
at veterinary clinics.

113
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,361
Gosh.

114
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,783
Hello.

115
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,748
Over here. Bring me a glass of cold water.

116
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,054
Part-timers are
valuable members of our cafe.

117
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,681
Please don't talk down to them.

118
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,307
Where's your boss?

119
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,270
We have the right
to refuse service to anyone.

120
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,273
-Please leave.
-Dad.

121
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,277
-You came to the cafe directly?
-I'm glad you're here.

122
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,029
Why is everyone in this building so angry?

123
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,824
What? Who's angry?

124
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,579
You're probably the one
who made them angry.

125
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,581
That's your expertise.

126
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,588
Gather every tenant
from every floor of my building.

127
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,715
That clause is in their contracts, right?

128
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,551
That clause is right here.

129
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:57,555
"The tenant must agree to be summoned
by the building owner once a year."

130
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,182
"Summoned"? What?
Are you the Genie or what?

131
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,102
A one-million-won fine if I refuse?

132
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,228
It was in the contract?

133
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,565
You should've read it through.
Contracts can be scary.

134
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,609
He'll make you come and go as he wishes.

135
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,445
Do Young-do and Da-jeong
have the same clause?

136
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,322
Yes.

137
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,907
This looks fun. Can I come along?

138
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:17,867
No.

139
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,785
I can come, right?

140
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:29,712
Did you have lunch?

141
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,006
I did.

142
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,675
-Did you really?
-Yes.

143
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,763
I heard you're sick.

144
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,641
I'm fine now.

145
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,979
Thank you for coming.
I just wanted to talk.

146
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:51,817
In Gangneung,
when I told you to stay healthy…

147
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,529
I'm sorry for not telling--

148
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,990
Don't apologize. Stop that.

149
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,369
I was so ignorant.

150
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,872
Everyone can get sick in life.

151
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,667
I made being sick sound like a flaw.

152
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:12,963
I'm sorry.

153
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,009
I should have told you
about my situation sooner.

154
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,681
We can't always find
the right time for everything in life.

155
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,851
You weren't trying to deceive me.

156
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,021
If we're to blame each other
whenever something like this happens,

157
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,731
we'll run out of people to be with.

158
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,610
What about Ms. Kang?

159
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,029
She's fine.

160
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,159
She cried like a little baby.

161
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,871
I've never seen her cry like that.

162
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,129
She'd be crazy if she smiled now.
But she cried, which is normal.

163
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,215
I'm sure you cried too.

164
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:05,433
There's this spot that gets
a strong headwind in Gangneung.

165
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:09,603
Your eyes get teary just by being there,

166
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,440
so it's perfect for crying.
You might want to check it out.

167
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,988
My bus is leaving soon.
You have your wallet with you, right?

168
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,114
Yes.

169
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,450
I'm not asking for money.

170
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,743
Here. Take it.

171
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,580
Keep it in your wallet.

172
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,126
And he's alive right now?

173
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,086
JU YOUNG-DO
MAY 10, 1984

174
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,337
Why would you ask that?

175
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,007
His life is like a flickering candle.

176
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,551
He's caught between life and death.

177
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,928
But the wick's already burned out.

178
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,346
But he's alive.

179
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,516
When you see him,
just buy him a nice meal.

180
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,726
Don't get too attached.

181
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,896
But what if she's already attached to him?

182
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,401
Hey. She's leaving. See her out for me.

183
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,988
No. Sit back down. Come on. Sit down!

184
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,157
Goodness.

185
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,243
How can I leave after hearing this?

186
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,079
Would you be able to just go home
and get on with your day

187
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,790
after hearing your daughter
is going to be heartbroken?

188
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,376
Find a way.

189
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,714
-Take good care of yourself.
-Okay.

190
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,634
Take care.

191
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:32,728
If this guy were born around this time,

192
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,982
a black cat would be standing
in front of his candle.

193
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:41,987
Then no matter how windy it gets,
the flame will not go out.

194
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,783
What if the cat catches on fire?

195
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,203
This cat has nine lives.

196
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:54,291
If anyone asks you
about your time of birth, tell them this.

197
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,963
Now you have nine lives.
I bought them for you.

198
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:04,385
I lit some candles in a cathedral
and put up a lantern at a temple as well.

199
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:08,055
If anything, you'll have
more lives than nine, not less.

200
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,182
So it's okay

201
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,478
if you've already used two or three lives.

202
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,858
It's been a long time since we last met.

203
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,194
Thank you for sparing your time.

204
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,612
And to celebrate our meeting,

205
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,698
let's begin with a round of applause.

206
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,660
Gugu Building!

207
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,914
By the way, who are you?

208
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,834
I'm Young-do's friend.
And Ha-neul's friend as well.

209
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,295
You're Dr. Ju's friend. I see.

210
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:40,963
What brings you here?

211
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,091
He's running late.
So I'm here in his place.

212
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,175
I'm sorry.

213
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,388
-What do you do?
-I work at a TV station.

214
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,307
I'm preparing a dating reality show.

215
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,059
That is a fine project you have.

216
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,395
My daughter is single.
You think you can help her?

217
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,856
-That's enough.
-I didn't even get started.

218
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,524
You rarely go on blind dates.

219
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,902
Why only me?
Am I the only single child you have?

220
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,153
There they go again.

221
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,574
Young-do is here. Come here.

222
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,577
Gosh, Dr. Ju. It's been a while.

223
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,913
-Come have a seat.
-Hello.

224
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,873
You. You can sit here.

225
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,166
What? Okay.

226
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,669
You've met Da-jeong, right?
You guys are neighbors.

227
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,671
Have you introduced yourselves?

228
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,131
Say hello to each other.

229
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,302
-So a dating reality show?
-That's right.

230
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,144
Even the briefest encounters are fate.

231
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:40,147
So the fact that we're all here together

232
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:44,234
must mean that
the bond between us is very strong.

233
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,655
-Of course, sir.
-That's right.

234
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,990
But why didn't you
cast Eun-ha for your TV show?

235
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,201
You even cast the vet.

236
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,119
That's enough.

237
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,122
That's all you ever say to me.

238
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,083
All you ever talk about is marriage.

239
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,461
-Just eat.
-It only took one night

240
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,547
for my world to become a minefield.

241
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,097
I'm sorry.
It's been a while since you visited.

242
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,225
No wonder
your mom didn't let me wake you up.

243
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,227
Rest up if you're not well.

244
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,954
It's hard to be with him.

245
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,790
But at home,

246
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,460
it will be hard because I'm not with him.

247
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,104
Be gentle.

248
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,189
I cranked up the water pressure.

249
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,607
-Oh, no.
-Goodness.

250
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,317
Goodness! Oh, my!

251
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,572
I don't think he's here today.

252
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:58,118
Let's pull out
from Choi Jeong-min's studio for now.

253
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,037
Let's keep an eye on Ian Chase.

254
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:01,955
Okay.

255
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,335
Gosh.

256
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,045
WANTED FOR MURDER

257
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,339
We got the warrant.

258
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,673
That took so long.

259
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,759
Don't get in. Let's go in right away.

260
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,900
What a mess.

261
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,780
I think something happened here.

262
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,450
This is blood.

263
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,640
Red Blood, Red Spatula.

264
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,226
March 15, 2003.

265
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,729
RED BLOOD, RED SPATULA

266
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,106
The 18-year-old boy

267
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,275
led the man to the woman.

268
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,651
Who is it?

269
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,285
He was overwhelmed by fear
like a child in service of a deity.

270
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,746
The man didn't hesitate

271
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,248
to stab the woman
in the abdomen several times.

272
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,254
"You don't need to be polite
when killing vermin.

273
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,467
There just has to be justice. That's all."

274
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:24,514
The man shoved
a red spatula into her mouth.

275
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,900
The Hunting Dog on the Third Floor.

276
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,736
The man lured
the hunting dog to the third floor.

277
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:43,659
The 18-year-old boy sent
this hunting dog to get rid of me.

278
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,495
He was the perfect offering.

279
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,268
Who sent you?

280
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,895
Was it this bastard?

281
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,030
The Cost of Foolish Bravery.

282
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,616
June 3, 2018.

283
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,203
A stupid post online was to blame.

284
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,707
A foolish detective
read the post and tenaciously

285
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,668
-followed the trail into the man's turf.
-I have no idea

286
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,919
who lives here.

287
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,796
-The man
-He just

288
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,924
-prepared to kill the detective.
-comes and goes.

289
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,217
Excuse me, sir.

290
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,433
-Can I borrow a lighter?
-Sure.

291
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,492
Well, he's a cop,
so things got a bit complicated.

292
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,953
Shouldn't we take care of this together?

293
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:17,127
THE MAN'S KNIFE CUT THROUGH
THE DETECTIVE'S ABDOMEN INSTANTLY…

294
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,262
What's all this?

295
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,860
I am writing this of my own volition.

296
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,863
On March 13, 2003, at 9 p.m.,

297
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,157
I killed Kim Myeong-ja.

298
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,410
On June 3, 2018, at 2 p.m.,

299
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,704
I stabbed Lee Jeong-beom.

300
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,290
I killed Cho Gwang-hun.

301
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:04,424
Wait. Did he write about his killings?

302
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,261
Jeong-beom…

303
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,181
Damn it.

304
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,225
He was right under our noses
the whole time.

305
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:16,895
Detective Park.

306
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:20,482
Compare them to the case reports
and see if they check out.

307
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,818
And call Young-do to check
if the same person…

308
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,612
Wait. No. Don't call him.

309
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,699
Check if this was the drug
that Ian Chase was drugged with.

310
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,201
Okay.

311
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:36,456
ANYONE IN MY POSITION
WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME THING

312
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,585
GUGU BUILDING

313
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,380
It's my cash gift
for Byeong-hun's wedding.

314
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,593
-You can't come?
-I have to work at the cafe.

315
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,096
I was going to ask you
to give mine to him.

316
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,182
You have to go. You're a mentor to him.

317
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,852
And he invited me because of you.

318
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,401
The wedding
will be held outside the hotel,

319
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,528
so you won't run into Da-jeong.

320
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:10,866
I see.

321
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:14,870
Do you want some?

322
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:18,498
You can have it.

323
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,168
See you.

324
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:30,010
You seem to have
a lot of long-term relationships.

325
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:33,096
-Attending your student's wedding?
-I only tutored two students.

326
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,142
And I'm worried
the other might never get married.

327
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,354
The kid I tutored went to jail.

328
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:43,732
What did you teach?

329
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,984
It had nothing to do with my teaching.

330
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:49,029
But he was pretty negative
when I taught him English.

331
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:00,373
Hey.

332
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,209
You look tired.

333
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,836
-Do you need help?
-No.

334
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,838
-I'll go upstairs.
-Okay.

335
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:07,964
Da-jeong.

336
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,634
It's for you.

337
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,057
I'm paying for this.
I'm not just giving it away.

338
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,644
But you worked hard to earn money.

339
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,606
Thank you. I really appreciate it.

340
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,235
Do you want to go on a blind date?

341
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:32,614
I work at an internet cafe on weekends.
And the owner there is still single.

342
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,823
Who's going on a date?

343
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,201
Da-jeong.
I'm going to set her up with a guy.

344
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,869
Why would she want to date now?

345
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,413
Why wouldn't she want to?

346
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,832
-She's totally available.
-Stop pushing her.

347
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,584
When did I push her?

348
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,711
Why wouldn't she be able to go on a date?

349
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,922
I think I'm going to head upstairs.

350
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,006
Think about it.

351
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,176
He's not as handsome as Mr. Ju,
but he's nice.

352
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,762
He's a nice guy.

353
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:57,430
He's nice.

354
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:01,768
By the way,
do you not like manly-looking guys?

355
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,858
-Thanks for the drink.
-Okay.

356
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,445
Bye.

357
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,993
The bride and groom will enter now.

358
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,666
-Congratulations.
-You look so pretty!

359
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,752
-You look great.
-Congratulations.

360
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,141
Cushions? What's the address?

361
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,727
Okay.

362
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:47,564
For Room 903?

363
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:50,400
They asked me to pick them up
since delivery's not available.

364
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,402
I have to find someone to help me.

365
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,822
Why are you still here? You're off work.

366
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,327
-Are they heavy?
-They're just cushions.

367
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,786
Where is the store?

368
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,580
It's about five minutes away on foot.

369
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,707
-I'll pick them up.
-Really?

370
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,418
But you seem a bit tired.

371
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,795
Fatigue will help me sleep.

372
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,672
Send me the address.

373
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,815
Do you want to trade me
your Dr. Hollow for my Black Fields?

374
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,776
-No.
-Why not?

375
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,278
Dr. Hollow is much rarer than that.

376
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:39,783
Then how about
two Bad Choices for one Dr. Hollow?

377
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,285
-No.
-Why not?

378
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:45,497
Dr. Hollow is much rarer than them.

379
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:11,356
Hello. I'm here to pick up the cushions
under the name Heo Yu-kyeong.

380
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:14,401
They're over there.
Do you want me to load them in your car?

381
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,736
No. I walked here.

382
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,034
No way.

383
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,957
Look. It's chicken.

384
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,876
Mom, chicken drumsticks!

385
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,920
Yes, they really are.

386
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,797
Why would she buy stuff like that?

387
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,215
-You ask her.
-You ask her.

388
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:39,467
-That's so funny.
-Or you can ask her.

389
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,803
-Look at that.
-Right.

390
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,097
A new restaurant?

391
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,308
Looking good!

392
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,274
Let's go.

393
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:57,152
All right. The groom is

394
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,738
going to sing a song himself today.

395
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:03,783
And the bride will dance to the song.

396
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,202
All right.

397
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,539
As I have seen them sing and dance before,

398
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:12,417
I'm excited to see them perform.
Aren't you excited as well?

399
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,710
-Yes!
-Yes!

400
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:17,046
Let's give a big round
of applause to the groom.

401
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:25,263
Nothing has changed

402
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:32,771
And we are still strangers to each other

403
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:38,735
But you have already conquered my heart

404
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:55,084
The bride and groom
will march forward to their happy future.

405
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:54,477
Here.

406
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,300
Leave it.

407
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,096
You shouldn't.

408
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,476
-I just wanted--
-Didn't you know?

409
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,605
This is what breaking up means.

410
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,693
You can't help me even if you want to.

411
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,740
You can't worry about me
even if you're worried.

412
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,706
And even if you're the only person…

413
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:05,131
who I can share a joke and laugh with.

414
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,886
I can't do that anymore.

415
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:26,319
We've come too far
to casually help each other out now.

416
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,782
We shouldn't

417
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,078
have gone to Gangneung together…

418
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:40,291
or done our crazy thing on that snowy day.

419
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,879
When you asked me to be friends,

420
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,424
I shouldn't have gone back to you.

421
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:56,849
And you shouldn't have told me
not to leave on the rooftop.

422
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,993
It will take such a long time
to get over the time we had.

423
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:21,165
I don't want you
to make new memories for me to get over.

424
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:35,722
I'm so embarrassed to see you like this
that I want to pass out right now.

425
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,057
So please pretend

426
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,977
you didn't see me, and just go.

427
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,422
She's cleaning the mirror.

428
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,592
The water in the toilet starts to foam up.

429
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,303
The toilet makes a roaring sound.

430
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,014
And the maid turns around.

431
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:19,932
Action.

432
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,483
A ghost. There's a ghost here!

433
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,452
I'm finally back.

434
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,663
It's nice to be back here at the inn.

435
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,509
Goodness. That was a tough scene.

436
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,886
Why would a princess
come out of the toilet?

437
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,471
Exactly.

438
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:01,974
I said I wanted to do
some funny scenes for a change,

439
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,476
and this is what I got.

440
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,271
Hey. I read the article.

441
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,816
Really?

442
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,944
-Did you "like" the article?
-How could I?

443
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:15,655
When idol stars get caught,
they lose their phones, right?

444
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,323
How do you know that?

445
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,075
What's his number?

446
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,578
-It's 010…
-Okay.

447
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,413
Pardon? Who?

448
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:27,583
This is Kim Nam-hui, the famous actor.

449
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,419
I won the Grand Award at TVC last year.

450
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,338
Yes. That's me.

451
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,257
Can I talk to Patrick?

452
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,677
It's Kim Nam-hui.

453
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:42,723
I see. Kim Nam-hui.

454
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,101
Why did he call me?

455
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:47,895
Hello, Nam-hui.

456
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:49,772
It's me.

457
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,900
Yes. I'm surprised to get your call.

458
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,028
This is Nam-hui's phone.

459
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,613
What were you doing?

460
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,200
I was thinking about you.
I miss you so much.

461
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,582
Nam-hui, you know what?
You were in my dream last night.

462
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,294
What did I do in your dream?

463
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,962
Well…

464
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,799
you and I went to a sauna.

465
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,342
So…

466
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,305
Come on.

467
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,849
-What? What did he say?
-Yes.

468
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,350
-What is it?
-I'm at the shoot.

469
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,603
I came out of the toilet again.

470
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,273
Yes. Okay.

471
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,482
Have fun recording.

472
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,234
Bye.

473
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:37,737
How was it? Good?

474
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,573
-Thanks, Nam-hui.
-Gosh.

475
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,033
You should always be careful.

476
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,504
Da-jeong isn't answering my calls.

477
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,382
I hope she's not upset
that I couldn't make it to her party.

478
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:02,053
Something came up,
so I had to do some damage control.

479
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,847
I saw the article. Are you all right?

480
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:09,602
I'm not fine. But what can I do?
How was the party?

481
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,104
It was a disaster.

482
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,649
Why? What happened?

483
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,737
Young-do said what?

484
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,697
Has he gone mad?

485
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,161
-Can you be seen here?
-Of course not.

486
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,873
I can't be seen
with my ex-husband after that scandal.

487
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,167
Is it that hard?

488
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,587
Do you think I'm here
because of my problem?

489
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:42,134
I knew that you were a fool
when you married me just because I asked,

490
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,761
but were you this stupid?

491
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,515
As if asking her to be friends
wasn't enough, you told her what?

492
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:53,437
If you want to talk about that,
let's talk after work.

493
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,774
You know what? You should also
see a shrink given your track record.

494
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,777
If you give up on dating,
can you save the world?

495
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,905
What's the point of helping me,
Ms. Oh, and other people?

496
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,700
You keep stabbing
the woman you like with a dagger.

497
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,619
Why are you so scared?

498
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,247
Because you can't help Da-jeong?

499
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:12,999
Because she'll cry?

500
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:16,127
So look at her now.
Is she smiling and dancing?

501
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,171
Halt.

502
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,382
She's on our side.

503
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:29,974
Ga-yeong.

504
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,311
-I almost caused an accident.
-So what?

505
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:35,813
What if someone was with me?

506
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:38,065
I stubbed my baby toe
on the closet yesterday.

507
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,735
I should go home and burn down my closet.

508
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,570
It's not the same thing.

509
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,612
It is to me.

510
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,699
You like Da-jeong.
You said you were friends.

511
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,118
Think about it as her friend.

512
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,828
I don't have to!

513
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,955
Yes, it's my fault. I know, but…

514
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,958
So I don't want to--

515
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,460
Be quiet!

516
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,253
I'm thinking right now.

517
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,555
You don't know this,

518
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,807
but I'm on your side.

519
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:16,228
If I wasn't, I would have gone to her
and told her to dump you long ago.

520
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,899
But I owe you my life.

521
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,782
Don't make me a bad friend to Da-jeong.

522
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,992
Can't you just be happy?

523
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:35,373
I'm having a hard time as it is.
What am I doing here?

524
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,208
How can I be worried about you?

525
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,752
This is so not me!

526
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:46,467
Must I see my ex-husband becoming…

527
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:49,637
such a fool?

528
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:06,821
What do you want to see?

529
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,115
The day before his death?

530
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:10,699
Or the day of?

531
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,750
We'll talk again after you watch it.

532
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,044
We'll have a lot to talk about.

533
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,725
I know that you sent him to kill me.

534
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,895
I should've taken my time with him.

535
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,653
He was shaken up just like you now.

536
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,198
Kim Myeong-ja.

537
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,909
You think I killed her, right?

538
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,955
Lee Jeong-beom.

539
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,250
You think I killed him, right?

540
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:02,960
No.

541
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:06,505
You're responsible for their deaths

542
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:10,176
because you came to me that day.

543
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:15,556
MARCH 11, 2003

544
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,522
PURE MURDER

545
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,694
Did you really write that?

546
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,459
Prove it.

547
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,891
Anything can kill you.

548
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,477
A glass of liquor,

549
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,854
or even a sip of Coke.

550
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,567
If you don't kill yourself,

551
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,989
the next body will be found
on the fourth floor of Gugu Building.

552
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:48,649
MARCH 12, 2003

553
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,654
If he doesn't recognize you
after seeing your face,

554
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,115
tell him you were the nameless twin.

555
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:58,951
As long as you get the door open,

556
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:03,205
he'll take care of the rest.
So don't be scared.

557
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,136
This is…

558
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,557
Compared to what I've done for you…

559
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,519
this is nothing.

560
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:28,522
You know that, right?

561
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,317
Right?

562
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:36,405
After this,

563
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:40,075
all those people
who tortured us won't be here anymore.

564
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:45,331
You can't do anything by yourself yet,
but you have me, so you'll be okay.

565
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,293
Because I'll become a doctor…

566
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,881
and I won't leave you alone.

567
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:06,935
After this,

568
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,648
all those people
who tortured us won't be here anymore.

569
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,233
This really is the last time.

570
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:17,863
There won't be any problem
as long as Hwang Jae-sik is gone.

571
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:21,700
Just finish him and come
to the States. We'll be fine then.

572
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:28,374
They do it because they think
by crossing the line just this once,

573
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,502
they'll be able to live

574
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:35,339
normal and stable lives
like everyone else.

575
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:49,937
Hello.

576
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:57,194
I remember you.
Weren't you here the other day?

577
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,697
Your son was so adorable
that I remember you.

578
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,827
Right. Do you live around here?

579
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,704
Give it to your boy before it melts.

580
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,792
-Why are you giving me this?
-Today is my last day.

581
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,129
I don't want to charge my last customer.

582
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:22,010
You know, I've really enjoyed watching
people have ice cream here.

583
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:31,687
Ice cream isn't much,
but it's something you can't have

584
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,897
when you're too poor or too sad.

585
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,192
If you can have ice cream,

586
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,653
it means that you're happy enough.

587
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,831
MA JEONG-A

588
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,587
Hello.

589
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,173
You've probably watched
the footage by now, right?

590
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,134
If you wrap this up nicely,

591
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,803
you will get what you want.

592
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,222
Don't worry about anything else.

593
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,641
Just cross the line
this once and come back.

594
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:13,604
Well, then. Good luck with the surgery.

595
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:59,441
Can you please stop dumping
your friend on the first floor?

596
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:02,236
As you can see,
he's making our cafe look bad.

597
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,698
-She's talking about me.
-Good for you.

598
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,867
-Ha-neul, say something as well.
-Forget it.

599
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:11,870
JU YOUNG-DO PSYCHIATRY CLINIC

600
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,792
-Happy…
-Birthday.

601
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,132
Say something to the camera.

602
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:27,844
Well, we were asked
to do this out of the blue.

603
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,763
I don't know who you are.

604
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,432
-But…
-His name is Ju Young-do.

605
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,851
Okay. Mr. Ju Young-do--

606
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,311
Don't say another man's name.

607
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,647
Okay. I won't. Okay?

608
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,315
I'll tell him to get lost.

609
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:43,110
Gosh. How is
"get lost" a birthday message?

610
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:46,488
It's pretty refreshing.
I bet he never got that from a girl.

611
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:50,284
Right. Thank you. I mean it, but…

612
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:55,205
Thank you. Happy now?

613
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:58,584
But can you stop doing this?
You're inconveniencing too many people.

614
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:02,963
Watching them at your 70th birthday party
will make you tear up. I'm telling you.

615
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:03,922
Yes!

616
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,799
I need a reaction clip for the party.

617
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:07,718
Can you stop filming me?

618
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,512
Just let him be. That comes with the job.

619
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:11,555
I need another drink.

620
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,141
How come that camera never breaks?

621
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,226
That one is pretty tough.

622
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,645
It still works
after filming Seung-won's ugly face.

623
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:20,606
Hey.

624
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:24,026
-We're out of beer.
-Great. Stop drinking.

625
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,486
Stopping now would be against the law.

626
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:30,365
Your Honor,
I did not agree to stop drinking.

627
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:33,410
Go buy some more.
Get some ice cream on your way back too.

628
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:36,288
-No, no more. Just go.
-Hey, let us drink some more.

629
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:37,623
Need anything, Young-do?

630
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:41,293
I need silence and some alone time.

631
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,170
They're at the convenience store.

632
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:46,423
I'll go get them. You two,
don't have too much fun without me.

633
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:48,967
You can badmouth me,
but don't tell each other secrets.

634
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,469
I'll check when I come back.

635
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:52,888
Gosh. When will he grow up?

636
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,226
I'll go inside and get some rest.

637
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,103
-If you're tired too--
-Young-do.

638
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,233
You're okay, right?

639
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:14,868
What can I do for you?

640
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,675
What's this?

641
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:33,220
CHEON SEUNG-WON

642
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:51,697
Did you watch it?

643
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,532
Why did you send this to me?

644
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,701
Well, I just wanted you
to know how he feels.

645
00:49:56,868 --> 00:50:00,747
I'm trying my best not to punch him.
Should I be worried about him?

646
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,166
Da-jeong will never see this.

647
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,460
I'll delete it right away.

648
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,337
You're so cruel.

649
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,339
I'm not the cruel one here.

650
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,926
You're dead meat
if you send this to Da-jeong.

651
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,136
I mean it.

652
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,854
Ga-yeong will meet us there.

653
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:25,313
Okay.

654
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,831
We're not spending the night here.
Do we have to set this up?

655
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:47,419
We can just grab some chairs
and stay in the shade.

656
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:50,088
That's what we said,
but you wanted to set it up.

657
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,424
That's why I told you not to listen to me.

658
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:53,675
What do I know?

659
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,969
That's not how you do it.

660
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:58,305
-You need to fix it on the ground.
-What?

661
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:00,307
I think it'll be fine.

662
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,809
If it gets windy,
it could end up in Busan.

663
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,067
And there's Youngdo Bridge in Busan.

664
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:13,945
What did you say?

665
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,365
Nothing.

666
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:20,160
When will we fix them to the ground?

667
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,453
Untie them now.

668
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:48,647
Can I talk about Young-do?

669
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,691
I don't want you to.

670
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:58,698
I wasn't asking for your permission.

671
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,700
-But why not?
-He left.

672
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:02,869
So it's pointless.

673
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,205
Well, it's not like he wanted to leave.

674
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,877
But I wouldn't know how he feels.

675
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:14,047
At the end of the day,
he left her because he didn't need her.

676
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:16,007
If he couldn't live without her,

677
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:18,844
he would have stayed
even if Da-jeong pushed him away.

678
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,429
That's not why.

679
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,683
Don't say that.

680
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,356
I know that he likes me a lot.

681
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:39,114
Whenever I looked at him,
he had already been looking at me.

682
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,871
He ran when he came to see me.

683
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,792
When I said I skipped my meal
because I was busy,

684
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,210
he got so upset.

685
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:59,384
And he always laughed
at my lame jokes like a fool.

686
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,138
But he still left you.

687
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:12,147
I wonder how someone like that
would have felt when he left me.

688
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,441
That doesn't matter. He still left.

689
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,568
I yelled at him, so he could.

690
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,361
He couldn't do it himself,

691
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,572
so he made you say those things.

692
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,701
That was the only thing
I could do for him.

693
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:28,872
Because of me…

694
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:32,751
his heart, of all places, is hurting.

695
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,421
Because I think
that I shouldn't see her anymore,

696
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:40,759
it feels like a hand has come in here

697
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,930
and squeezed my heart really hard.

698
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:55,440
The things I went through after moving…

699
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,527
I can't imagine

700
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:04,240
how hard I would have fallen
if it weren't for him.

701
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,539
He helped me endure all of that

702
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:14,793
and even helped me pull out
the knife stuck in my throat.

703
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:20,173
I didn't even get to put a band-aid on him
and that makes me so angry.

704
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:24,552
And that staying away…

705
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:29,349
is the only thing I can do for him.

706
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:32,644
That's not true. You can do
more than that. Be there for him.

707
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:37,524
Just think of it
as dating a very slow, dense guy.

708
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:40,443
You can just wait for him, can't you?

709
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:43,822
I mean,

710
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:47,659
I'm just suggesting. I'm not pushing you.

711
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:07,053
We've been friends for 20 years.

712
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,764
But I've been so blind.

713
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:15,770
I thought I wanted you
to meet a nice guy and be happy.

714
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:21,067
But I think I wanted you to be happy,
so I could lean on you.

715
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,362
I didn't think

716
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,616
that you liked him that much.

717
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:31,536
I'm sorry.

718
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:56,311
Can you drop me off here?

719
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:07,739
Why?

720
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,992
I just want to sit there for a while.

721
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:13,953
Why?

722
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:19,084
Because I miss doing crazy things?

723
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:23,129
Should I come with you?

724
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,297
No.

725
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,633
Should I wait for you?

726
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:27,550
No.

727
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:03,711
That was between us.
Why did you send that without…

728
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,926
I really didn't want her to know that.
You drive me crazy!

729
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:13,847
Eun-ha kept saying
that you were such a jerk, so…

730
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:14,889
But I am.

731
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:16,891
Aren't I?

732
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:19,853
I was fine being the jerk.
Why did you have to…

733
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,729
Why the hell did you do that?

734
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:23,982
Young-do.

735
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:27,152
Eun-ha might not
have shown it to Da-jeong yet.

736
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:28,194
So…

737
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,156
She did.

738
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:47,922
Young-do yelled at me,
but I know that he's not mad at me.

739
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,632
He is angry at you.

740
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:51,468
Really?

741
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:55,638
That's good then. It's better
to let it out than to suppress his anger.

742
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,642
Gosh.

743
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:04,481
Don't mind what Seung-won said earlier.

744
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,149
He only said it to side with you.

745
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,193
Everything he said was true.

746
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:12,363
He's a weirdo,
but you know he speaks the truth.

747
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:18,870
To be honest, I was quite surprised.

748
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:24,209
Why were you so mean to Ms. Kang?
You didn't have to be.

749
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,590
That way, I could never go back to her.

750
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,635
I realized that I couldn't

751
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:36,221
just be a friend to her
because I wanted more.

752
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:40,433
So you want to go back to her.

753
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,231
How drunk are you?

754
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,652
Pretty drunk.

755
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:54,197
I won't be able to
remember this talk tomorrow.

756
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:08,503
I desperately want to

757
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:11,589
and I miss her like crazy.

758
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:18,137
Whether it's 10 or 20 years,
I just want to turn back the time.

759
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:22,934
I don't care that I'd be in pain
and need to have surgery again.

760
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:24,894
I'll gladly go through all of that again.

761
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,065
I just want to be with her again.

762
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:40,201
Beer's here!

763
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:42,412
And the ice cream?

764
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,957
-I forgot.
-Go get it.

765
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,944
I can do it all over again too.

766
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,867
I can get slammed
by a rhino and fall again.

767
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:23,911
I can do all of that again.

768
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:29,626
So if this is how you really feel…

769
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:31,878
If you meant it,

770
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:41,471
can you come here?

771
01:00:57,612 --> 01:01:00,323
I'm sorry my first instinct
is to hesitate and run away.

772
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:05,244
I'm sorry for being like that.

773
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:07,163
But…

774
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,208
I still want to be with you.

775
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:16,547
Is it okay if I stay in your life?

776
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:20,843
Yes.

777
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:27,600
Is it okay if I help you?

778
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:34,148
I don't know how to do that yet.

779
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,570
Will you do that?

780
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:43,658
Yes.

781
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:04,799
"When did you start liking him?"

782
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:07,301
"Why did you fall so hard for him?"

783
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:12,306
I wonder if I can answer
those questions like this.

784
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:18,479
"Maybe it's been a lot longer
than I realize.

785
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:22,108
Maybe it all started
when that trembling wildflower

786
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:24,193
met a fence

787
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:27,238
and was comforted by a small, round candy.

788
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:29,949
I think that's when

789
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:32,493
I fell in love with you."

790
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:36,789
