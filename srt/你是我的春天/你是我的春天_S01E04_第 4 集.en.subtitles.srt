1
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,258
That's okay.

2
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,705
EPISODE 4

3
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,682
FLUENT IN KOREAN
CAN'T EAT SPICY FOOD

4
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,142
REQUESTS 10 TOOTHBRUSHES EVERY DAY

5
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:07,288
"Ian Norman Chase."

6
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,462
Hey!

7
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:19,759
DECEMBER, 1994

8
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,179
Hey, why did you pat me
on the head earlier?

9
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,933
Why did you pat me on the head?

10
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,354
Kids, let's take a photo.
Hurry and gather around.

11
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,439
Hurry up.

12
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,565
-Okay!
-Okay!

13
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,609
-Let's go!
-Where?

14
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:40,488
It wasn't me who patted you on the head.

15
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,365
Dummy.

16
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:44,951
What?

17
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,289
What does he think I am, his toy?

18
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,252
I'll take it now.

19
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,171
Guys, be still. Don't move.

20
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,424
Hey, kid. Come pose with your book.

21
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,633
Let's take a photo.

22
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,677
Come on.

23
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,388
Big smiles, everyone. Here we go.

24
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,350
You, on the right side,
please come forward.

25
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,853
Guys, look at the camera.

26
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,813
One, two…

27
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,484
This is it.

28
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,113
May I see a list of the members
from back then?

29
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,197
There isn't one.

30
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,992
This church is not related
to the previous one.

31
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,910
It's a normal church now.

32
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,622
The pastor is an upright man,
and the workers are good people.

33
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,334
I'm sure they are.

34
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:38,379
Then did the previous church have issues?

35
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,840
Not all churches are real churches.

36
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:45,178
They were a cult.
The pastor wasn't even a real pastor.

37
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:49,724
Follow that road, and you'll see
a childcare facility

38
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,851
that they ran below the mountains.

39
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,854
They committed all sorts of crimes there.

40
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:58,691
Locking up missing kids, adopting children
illegally, and abusing them.

41
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:02,111
Some of the workers even went to jail
for those crimes.

42
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,115
If there are any records,
the police must have them.

43
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,450
NANUM JEIL PRAYER HOUSE

44
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,773
I just don't get Young-do.

45
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,483
Why did he marry her?

46
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,486
Out of pity?

47
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,781
Because she threw herself at him?
Because she's pretty?

48
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,367
Marrying a pretty woman
after getting seduced

49
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,994
then getting a divorce soon after

50
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,455
is something I would do, not him.

51
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,917
What?

52
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,752
I agree with you for once.

53
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,297
I just want a girlfriend.

54
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,136
I think my dryer shrinks my clothes.

55
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,472
I doubt it.

56
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,391
Then what?

57
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,729
See you tomorrow.

58
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:30,450
PSYCHIATRIST JU YOUNG-DO

59
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,088
-You're not busy.
-You startled me.

60
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,967
What's with that look?
Were you waiting for someone?

61
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,304
Aren't you closed for the day?
I saw the nurses leaving.

62
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,555
Why are you here?

63
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,270
-For the pizzas.
-You didn't have to come here.

64
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,521
You weren't picking up.

65
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,734
You just earned money. Buy me dinner.

66
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,445
I have plans. Eat with your boyfriend.

67
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,907
Am I not allowed to eat with you
if I have a boyfriend?

68
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,743
-Of course not.
-I see.

69
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,538
What's this?

70
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,708
Have you moved on from Spider-Man?

71
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,878
It's not like that. Can you put that back?

72
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,299
Had you not said that,
I would've put it down.

73
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,676
Was this your delivery fee?

74
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,471
It's not like that. Put it back down.
Or give it to me.

75
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,932
Hey, you. You have a horrible body ratio.

76
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,225
Isn't your head heavy?

77
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,310
-Should I snap your neck?
-Hey.

78
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,687
I really need to get going now.

79
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,115
Let's talk in the car. Drop me off.

80
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,159
Let's talk outside.

81
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,328
Come out.

82
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,382
I'm headed to the police station.
It's in the opposite direction.

83
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,926
You play with toy figures,
visit the police,

84
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,428
and even deliver food.

85
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,639
But you have no time for me.

86
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,267
What do you need to tell me?
Just say it now.

87
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,607
If you want to date someone, go ahead.

88
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,197
Honestly, I'd hate that, but I don't
want to be such an awful person.

89
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,491
And if I start hating myself,

90
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,119
the crazy woman in me
will creep out again.

91
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:41,414
Then I'll become unstable
like a three-legged chair once again.

92
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,586
You have my permission. You may date.

93
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,755
I didn't know I needed your permission,

94
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,757
-but thanks.
-You're really going to?

95
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,217
-No.
-Are you already dating?

96
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,511
-No, I'm not.
-Is there someone?

97
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,805
-No.
-Is it a one-sided love?

98
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,266
Love? I'm in no position to--

99
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,184
Why not? You're single.

100
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,648
-Well, that's true.
-What is it?

101
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,984
Does she not like you
because you're divorced?

102
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:14,238
Or is it because you were married
to someone so gorgeous and famous?

103
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,990
-If that's not it…
-That's not it.

104
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,909
Is it because of your heart?

105
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,871
Because you might die in ten years?

106
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,708
-So everything's good with you?
-Don't change the subject.

107
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,668
If you're doing okay and you're done--

108
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,503
Have you ever thought of me as a woman?

109
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,217
Not as someone suicidal

110
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,803
or a patient you want to save,

111
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,975
but as a woman
you want to touch and embrace?

112
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,899
-Ga-yeong--
-You changed the subject

113
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,901
when I asked you that six years ago.

114
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,361
Because you don't want to lie.

115
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,282
No one knows what'll happen in ten years.

116
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,663
I had my reasons to go to Gangneung.

117
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,540
And she just lives upstairs from me.
That's all.

118
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,502
-I really need to--
-Don't tell me to go.

119
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,212
I'll leave on my own.

120
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,812
Now that you're gone,

121
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,940
we'll see where Young-do's heart lies.

122
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,913
Oh. Hello.

123
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,748
-Oh, hello.
-Hi.

124
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,750
What brings you here?

125
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,629
If you're too busy, I can come next time.

126
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:56,173
It's okay. Please sit down.

127
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,883
Okay. Thank you.

128
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:03,639
Goodness. You've made a pretty shape
out of the cigarette butts.

129
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,225
You should've called beforehand.

130
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,563
I came because I wanted to ask you
some questions.

131
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,731
Then I'm glad you're here.

132
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,863
Did…

133
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,323
Choi Jeong-min…

134
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,871
have any brothers?

135
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,001
I saw someone who looked
exactly like him today.

136
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,587
I see.

137
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,590
You saw someone similar.

138
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,342
No, they looked identical.

139
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,889
He had the same smile and voice.

140
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,187
He didn't have any family,

141
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,480
let alone brothers.

142
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,901
We checked all his background information,
so I'm sure it's accurate.

143
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:03,282
How could they look so identical
when they're not even related?

144
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,453
Well…

145
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,623
Do you know his name?

146
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,877
We'll look into him if it's possible.

147
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,422
I'm afraid I can't disclose that.

148
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,511
Okay. I understand.

149
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:28,891
Well…

150
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,395
About that group photo
you took at the church…

151
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,191
Is there anything you remember about it?

152
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,070
It's nothing serious.

153
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,990
We need to check a few things

154
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,034
before wrapping up the case.

155
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,788
All I remember is
that I went there to get a book.

156
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,585
I'll look into it too.

157
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,046
My brother went there with me.
I'll ask him.

158
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,089
Okay.

159
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,804
Stop eating the zucchini.

160
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,390
They're really expensive, you know?

161
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,100
I'll pay.

162
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,936
Help yourself then.

163
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:16,939
Hey!

164
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,024
Come eat some!

165
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,737
Hurry up.

166
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,701
I have no appetite
and can't stomach anything.

167
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:32,454
Isn't your daughter getting married?
Life should be rosy right now.

168
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,455
Are you sick?

169
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,711
It feels like a huge rock
is suffocating me.

170
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,214
Maybe I didn't get enough sleep.

171
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,924
Should I pack some food for you?

172
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,344
-It's okay.
-Oh, dear.

173
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,144
Does she only have one arm or what?

174
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,897
Why is she carrying them in one hand?

175
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,982
The pain-relief patches
don't work anymore.

176
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:04,153
Damn it! If I were her,
I would've gotten a divorce already.

177
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,990
How can he call himself
a husband and a father?

178
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,034
He has all the despicable traits.

179
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,996
He's an abusive alcoholic who gambles
and cheats on his wife.

180
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,624
Does she not know
that she can file for divorce?

181
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,375
It's quite useful.

182
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:23,047
She puts up with him because he needs
to walk their daughter down the aisle.

183
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,134
Their future son-in-law is a doctor.
No, was it a judge?

184
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:30,095
It's all downright ridiculous.

185
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,017
If either of the families is
much better off than the other,

186
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,393
then eventually…

187
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,396
What? Are you done eating?

188
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,441
The zucchini is bitter.

189
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,401
All of a sudden?

190
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,831
Ms. Kang was here.

191
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,084
When?

192
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,419
Just now. She talked with me and left…

193
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,928
I think something's going on.

194
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,722
Why? Did something happen to her?

195
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,682
I mean, you.

196
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,934
You can call her if it's urgent.

197
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,896
It's not urgent, and we're not close.

198
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,272
Are you avoiding each other?

199
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,650
Not really.

200
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:27,611
We're just neighbors.
She's upstairs. I'm downstairs. Give me…

201
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,699
Up, down, up, up, down

202
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,618
Up, down, up, up, down

203
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,371
Take this.

204
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,665
2021 CHOI JEONG-MIN SUICIDE CASE

205
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,126
By the way,

206
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,045
why did Ms. Kang come here?

207
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,381
She asked if Choi Jeong-min had
any brothers.

208
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,092
She saw someone who looked just like him.

209
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,428
-Where?
-Seeing how she couldn't tell me,

210
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,096
he must've been her hotel guest.

211
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,272
Do you remember going to some church
when we were little?

212
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,357
I do.

213
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,860
Really? You were tiny back then.

214
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,362
I remember. You brought me chocolate.

215
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,865
It was a book.

216
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,284
You brought both.

217
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:16,869
It was bell-shaped.

218
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,414
We put it underneath our blanket
and it melted.

219
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:24,043
We didn't want Mom to find out, so we
washed it in the bathroom but got caught.

220
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,319
What?

221
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,079
Was it Ga-yeong?

222
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,958
Gosh, Ga-yeong.

223
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,419
Gosh, Ga-yeong.

224
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,090
Punch. Punch into it.

225
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,929
Why aren't you picking it up?

226
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,140
Don't mind it.

227
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,852
How can I not when it's ringing?

228
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,479
Here.

229
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,359
I'm going to give him an earful.

230
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,195
He hung up.

231
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,906
Let's see how many times he called.

232
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,786
Eleven missed calls. All from Ju Young-do.

233
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,916
Will you still deny it?

234
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,794
What is it this time?

235
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,258
You're pretty good.

236
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,802
Wait.

237
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,577
Darn it.

238
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,254
What are you doing here?

239
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,386
I like toy figures.

240
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,681
Grown men are allowed to like them
as well.

241
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,642
That's true.

242
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,726
Right.

243
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,688
"Hi. It's nice to meet you. You too.
Let's kiss."

244
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,190
"Let's kiss."

245
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,901
Do you want them?

246
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,862
-Oh, dear.
-They're twins.

247
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,876
I don't usually play like this.

248
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,715
Didn't you say you'd be done
in five minutes?

249
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,219
A few days ago, a young lady

250
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,846
wrestled with this just like you,

251
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,432
demanding Dr. Hollow.

252
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,644
She's here.

253
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,565
Did you guys make a bet or something?

254
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,651
-No, we didn't.
-No, we didn't.

255
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,450
Here's your 20,000 won. No more.

256
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,869
I have no more coins left.

257
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,832
How could he spend
tens of thousands won on that?

258
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,302
I'm sorry. I lost your gift.

259
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,596
I'm trying to get the same one.

260
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,396
You really didn't have to do this.

261
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,652
They don't have
many Dr. Hollow figures here.

262
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,489
Tell me about it.

263
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:08,618
I got nine Bad Choice figures.

264
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,664
I mean, they're all the same size
in the picture.

265
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,792
It suggests that
the chances of getting them are equal.

266
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,878
If this was a rare item,

267
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,212
they should've said so.

268
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:22,632
This company lured consumers
with false advertising.

269
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,845
Oh, the coins.

270
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:43,779
-Here.
-Okay.

271
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,572
Open it.

272
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,537
Wrong one.

273
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,332
Here.

274
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,978
Look at this!

275
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:19,981
We got it!

276
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,578
-What's going on?
-We finally got it.

277
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,263
I heard you went to the police station.

278
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:55,725
Are you a side mirror?

279
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,856
"Objects in mirror are closer
than they appear."

280
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,696
Then you must know why I went there.

281
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,407
Yes.

282
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,081
There's a movie called
The Double Life of Veronique.

283
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,294
It's not some raunchy movie.

284
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,713
I didn't say anything.

285
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:33,054
Two female characters are born
at the same time and look identical.

286
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:37,309
One is Polish, and the other is French.

287
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:42,772
They're neither related nor have met,
but they can feel each other.

288
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,401
When one of them dies,

289
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:50,280
the other bursts into tears
without knowing why.

290
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,749
A doppelgänger.

291
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,211
Do you think they exist?

292
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,507
Maybe.

293
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:18,516
I expected you to say
that people mistake one for another

294
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,811
and lecture me about the brain structure.

295
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,734
Once you've lost someone dear to you,

296
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,904
you're willing to believe anything.

297
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,741
Things like souls, heaven,

298
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,118
reincarnation. Everything.

299
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,585
"Now that they're free from pain,

300
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,589
they must be flying anywhere they want.

301
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,679
They must be enjoying all the food
they craved down here

302
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,431
and feeling joy.

303
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,771
If I pine for them,

304
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,316
they may come back as the wind

305
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,653
and brush by me."

306
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,266
It's my mom.

307
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:52,193
Right. Sure. Go ahead.

308
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,278
Okay.

309
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,740
Hey, Mom.

310
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,743
I'm on my way home.

311
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,204
-Are you alone?
-Yes. Why?

312
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,416
I thought you were with someone
since you didn't pick up right away.

313
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,711
Perhaps Young-do or someone like Young-do.

314
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,173
Are you a security camera?

315
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,093
Mr. Hong gave me honey.

316
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,430
Oh, my. What a sweet gentleman.

317
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,100
He keeps giving you presents.

318
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,102
Tangerines, rice cakes, and honey.

319
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,897
He may get me taffies next time.

320
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,325
Is Young-do doing well?

321
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,495
Mom, you two are close now?

322
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:47,832
No. That's why I'm asking you.
If we were, I would've called him.

323
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,919
It's not like you're friends with him.
Why would you call him?

324
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,964
Then are we friends? I call you every day.

325
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,801
What I mean is Mr. Ju…

326
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:58,843
Yes?

327
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,512
What's going on? What is it?

328
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,097
Did an ugly guy follow you?

329
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,891
No, Mom. I just met Mr. Ju.

330
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,852
Really? Let me speak to him.

331
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,481
Mom, I'll call you back…

332
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:12,649
Let me talk to him.

333
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,779
-Mom.
-Do you not get me?

334
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:21,825
Put your phone to Young-do's ear!

335
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,961
-My mom…
-Okay.

336
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,216
Hello, Ju Young-do speaking.

337
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,427
Have you been well?

338
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,596
I forgot to pay you for your help
last time.

339
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:48,059
What should we do? Should I go there?
Or will you come here?

340
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,853
It's okay, ma'am.

341
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,104
Thanks to you…

342
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:55,817
I got thrown into the ocean
and even delivered pizza.

343
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:59,028
Right? You're right.

344
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:02,657
I did give you quite a few nice memories.

345
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,784
That's right. Thank you.

346
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,998
Since you're a psychiatrist,
let me ask you something.

347
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,501
Today, I saw this woman.

348
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,463
She seemed to be in a lot of pain.

349
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,008
A human side mirror

350
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:24,721
and a human security camera are
talking on the phone.

351
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,975
I don't get why she just puts up with it.

352
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,896
No wonder she has indigestion
and feels pain in her wrists.

353
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,482
That's a mental illness, right?

354
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,152
Her wrists must hurt
due to something else.

355
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:43,072
As for indigestion and insomnia,
it's a somatization disorder.

356
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,742
Did you just curse at me?

357
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,244
No, I didn't.

358
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,247
It's when you feel physical pain
due to stress.

359
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,708
It happens when you're exasperated.

360
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,128
Why did you have to use jargon
when you could use layman's terms?

361
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,799
Is it because you want to make use
of the difficult medical terms

362
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,926
you memorized when you were a student?

363
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,724
Right. I wonder why I did that.

364
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,939
A side mirror and a security camera

365
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:22,028
are talking on the phone
for a very long time.

366
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,199
It's all for her daughter?

367
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:30,370
If that's true,
it's such a ridiculous excuse.

368
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,663
Would she be happy?

369
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:35,250
She's forced to watch her mom
wither away like a bridal wreath.

370
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,127
That's just downright ludicrous.

371
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,713
I refuse to live like that.

372
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,298
Look at Da-jeong.

373
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,591
You can tell, right?

374
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:47,470
Both she and I are beautiful
and confident.

375
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:51,015
You're right. I completely agree with you.

376
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,274
Okay.

377
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,987
All right. Good night.

378
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,742
The security camera is turned off.

379
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,585
And the side mirror has left.

380
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,613
Due to Chairman Ma Jae-guk
being bedridden,

381
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,449
his son and daughter are fighting
to lead the company.

382
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,953
Correct. This has caught

383
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,789
both the stock street
and the media's attention.

384
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,417
As his health worsened,

385
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,837
we assumed that
one of his children would replace him.

386
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,674
However, seeing that the US medical team
arrived, the tables are turned now.

387
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,051
They must be the US medical team.

388
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,344
THE US MEDICAL TEAM FLIES IN DISCREETLY

389
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:37,223
They're known for performing surgery
on the former US president, Josh.

390
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:41,477
The team is led by Doctor Bale…

391
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,815
There's also one Korean American doctor.

392
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:50,278
The public believes they flew in
to treat the chairman.

393
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,948
But we can assume it's related
to the succession battle.

394
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,700
That's correct.

395
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:59,078
Majin Hospital is the core
of the foundation,

396
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:02,498
so it's crucial to obtain control over it.

397
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,710
The chairman's children,
Ma Jeong-a and Ma Sang-yong,

398
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,462
-are trying to replace…
-Mom.

399
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,214
Give me the remote control.

400
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,426
-Mom!
-The doctors' strike…

401
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,720
If you can't let me do anything,

402
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:19,557
could you at least let me know
if he's here right now?

403
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,061
I just need to give him this.

404
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,784
What did she say?

405
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,620
She refuses to give me
the guest's information.

406
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:41,871
I left the file with her.

407
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,250
Will you waste your time like this?

408
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,712
The higher-ups want us
to wrap this case up and move on.

409
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,756
We need to investigate to close the case.

410
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,508
His death didn't make sense.

411
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,302
Someone who looks like him
showed up. I should check him out.

412
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:01,057
That's true, but there's no way
to meet him right now.

413
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,975
CHIEF

414
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,102
This is a mess.

415
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:06,896
Hey.

416
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,441
You can recognize Choi Jeong-min's face
immediately, right?

417
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,237
Of course. It was my first autopsy.

418
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,240
Then tail him for the next two days.

419
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,035
You want me to tail him?

420
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,080
Is it legal? Will I get in trouble later?

421
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:27,458
You know how it's done, right?
Report whenever he goes somewhere.

422
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,503
Refrain from eating
or going to the bathroom.

423
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,213
I'm counting on you.

424
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,257
But…

425
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,010
I'm famished.

426
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,847
How? You haven't done anything.

427
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,601
I'm eating this.

428
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,228
How did you know it was for you?

429
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,063
His name's on it.

430
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,524
My name?

431
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,192
SEUNG-WON

432
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,197
Hamster cookies?

433
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,074
Did you name a rat after me?

434
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,369
-You're so quick-witted.
-Hamsters are like that.

435
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:06,205
Name a handsome dog after me
like you did with Young-do.

436
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,373
I hate rats.

437
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:10,418
-And we hate you.
-That's right.

438
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,295
Guys, you should eat.

439
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,504
-Right.
-Okay.

440
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,425
He can't wait to eat.

441
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,760
-Let's go.
-Okay.

442
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,681
VETERINARY CLINIC
OPENING SOON

443
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:24,724
Da-jeong.

444
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:26,851
Kang Da-jeong.

445
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,653
-What?
-Can we eat here?

446
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,071
Sure. You always do.

447
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,991
Guys, come up!

448
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:46,120
Who are you talking to?
Didn't you mean you and Eun-ha?

449
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,999
This is my friend, Seo Ha-neul,
who moved into the second floor.

450
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:53,127
-I'm Kang Da-jeong.
-Hello.

451
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,629
What a lovely name.

452
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,839
Hello, I'm Young-do's high school friend.

453
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,466
Ignore him.

454
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,635
Hello.

455
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:04,305
I'm single, smart, and passionate.

456
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,598
He's just a lunatic.

457
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,895
-I'm a producer at TVC.
-His nickname is 1,000 Won.

458
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:12,897
That's not true.

459
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,108
For you, I can make it 500 won.

460
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,653
That's too bad. I only have 50 won.

461
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,739
That's okay.
May I have your business card?

462
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,658
I'm actually 50 won in debt.

463
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,368
That's enough.

464
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,119
That's still okay.

465
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,497
Stop embarrassing me.

466
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,833
What? I'm just being myself.
You're being weird today.

467
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,711
Stop it.
Stop giving women your business card.

468
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,177
Wait.
Then you've never dated anyone before?

469
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:47,014
Of course, I have.
I've met loads of women.

470
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,267
I told you. Dreams don't count.

471
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,518
My gosh.

472
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,353
Young-do, you've seen my girlfriend.

473
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,896
The short, chubby girl.

474
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,606
Right.

475
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,526
Short and chubby? It doesn't ring a bell.

476
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:03,614
You know. Her hair was this long.
She had a pale face and big eyes.

477
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,451
Right. Hair this long, pale face,
and big eyes.

478
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,828
A Maltese.

479
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,456
No, that's not it.
If the hair is this long…

480
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,543
There's this breed whose ears
flap around when running.

481
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:18,587
It was a human being. A woman.

482
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,382
What was it again?

483
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:24,927
Do you know what breed
flaps their ears when running?

484
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,305
-Cocker Spaniels.
-Cocker Spaniels.

485
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,268
Cocker Spaniels.

486
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,150
You were born in early 1985.
You're younger than us.

487
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,068
Right. I envy you for being older.

488
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,903
But you took a gap year.

489
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,198
Exactly. How dare you eat
at the same table as your seniors?

490
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,160
Young-do, whose side are you on?

491
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,661
I'm upside.

492
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,291
I guess smart people are just like us.

493
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:59,545
So this is how he acts around his friends.

494
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,050
Why are you still single?

495
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:07,678
Mind your own business.

496
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,598
He does his best to keep women
away from him.

497
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,309
You're right.

498
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,605
-Be honest. You're dating, right?
-You're still here?

499
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,900
Did you know that he went to Gangneung
with some girl?

500
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,277
-And he drove all the way.
-No way.

501
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,697
He hates expressways.
Remember our road trip?

502
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,658
Yes. He hated tunnels,
so we only used national highways.

503
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:30,618
Gangneung?

504
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,120
There are tunnels back to back.

505
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:37,792
Did you drive the entire way there
when you guys went to Gangneung?

506
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:44,006
Did you two go together?

507
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:45,591
You two?

508
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:47,927
You two?

509
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,805
Hey. Thanks for the drinks. We should go.

510
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,390
-No, I'm having fun.
-Thanks.

511
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,475
Come out. It's time for you to leave.

512
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,684
-Just you two?
-Come on.

513
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,645
-Ha-neul.
-Yes?

514
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,190
See you next time, Young-do's girlfriend.

515
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,238
What?

516
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:19,625
What?

517
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,211
What is it? What?

518
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,426
Thank you.

519
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,349
VIOLENT CRIMES TEAM 3
KO JIN-BOK

520
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,226
Please call us.

521
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:05,791
A-ri.

522
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:09,587
Can you please tell him
that he looks really weird right now?

523
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,590
I agreed to say it just 10 times,
but I've said it 12 times.

524
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,216
I won't say it anymore.

525
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:18,429
He's pretty much begging his blind date

526
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:21,473
to spit in his face, isn't he?

527
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:24,351
But it doesn't seem too bad now.

528
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:26,770
What?

529
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,150
Okay, I'll be there soon.

530
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:38,324
Ha-neul.

531
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,327
Are you okay…

532
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:44,413
No, you're not. Is something wrong?

533
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,333
-Young-do got hurt.
-What?

534
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,543
How? How bad is it?

535
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,670
-Where is he right now?
-I don't know either.

CHEOL-DO

538
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,003
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable…

539
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,880
Why isn't he picking up?

540
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:41,011
Hello.

541
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,523
Come on.

542
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:56,985
What?

543
00:44:58,821 --> 00:44:59,988
Where's Mr. Ju?

544
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:01,949
He's at the hospital.

545
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,618
-Which one?
-Majin Hospital.

546
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:06,161
Where he sees his outpatients.

547
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,330
Why are you whispering?

548
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,708
Is everything okay?
It's nothing serious, right?

549
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:12,876
I can't talk right now.

550
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,212
Is it that bad? Just answer this.

551
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,964
I can't talk. I'll call you later.

552
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,632
I'm heading over there right now.

553
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:20,676
I'll call you when I get there,
so pick up.

554
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:22,302
Okay?

555
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:25,431
Hello?

556
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:52,624
I'm sorry,

557
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,252
but something came up at home.

558
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:56,795
Oh, what is it?

559
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,173
My grandmother is ill.

560
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,549
What happened?

561
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,802
She's just a bit sick.

562
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,762
I see.

563
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,140
Then should I call you tomorrow?

564
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,268
Actually, I'm going abroad to study
tomorrow.

565
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,020
What?

566
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,439
You're studying abroad?

567
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:18,692
What's wrong with him?

568
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:21,361
He received coil embolization
for subarachnoid hemorrhage a week ago.

569
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,905
No!

570
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:24,615
-Give him 5ml of haloperidol.
-Okay.

571
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:28,869
How long has he been delirious?

572
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,121
He started hallucinating and seizing
two days ago.

573
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,874
The doctor wanted to observe him
until today.

574
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:38,003
Doctor. Help.

575
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:39,630
Go away.

576
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,799
No!

577
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,860
-Young-do.
-Hey, Ju-won.

578
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:04,112
You haven't eaten yet.

579
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,615
I had no time.

580
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,494
Tending to the patients here
must be tough.

581
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,496
I heard you even went to the ER.

582
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:15,707
It can't be helped due to the strike.
You must be busy too.

583
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,960
I heard Professor Seok asked you
to work here.

584
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:20,045
Yes, he did.

585
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,464
I'd accept the offer if I were you.

586
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,841
I prefer working at my clinic.

587
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:29,471
How's your heart?
Has it been okay since last fall?

588
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,557
Yes, it's all thanks to you.

589
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:33,725
I'm healthy.

590
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,646
Here we go again.

591
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:41,400
-I'll get going then.
-Good luck.

MISSED CALLS
KANG DA-JEONG

593
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,831
-Why didn't you pick up?
-Why don't you pick up your phone?

594
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,019
You're…

595
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:03,231
You're not hurt anywhere?

596
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,738
Are you upset that I'm not hurt?

597
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,327
-Then what am I doing here?
-Exactly.

598
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:18,330
What are you doing here?

599
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:21,500
Are you okay?

600
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,502
What is this?

601
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,171
Is this a prank?

602
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:41,103
This is why I told him
not to name his dogs after people.

603
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:47,526
Well, it's not wrong to give a dog
a human name.

604
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,156
If only Cheol-do had told me properly…

605
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:58,787
Are you sleeping well?

606
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,669
Right. We agreed
not to ask these questions.

607
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,967
-Forget it.
-What do you mean?

608
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:16,847
It's too late for us
to drink as strangers now.

609
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,517
And I was the one who overreacted first.

610
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:24,646
Why did I come here?

611
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,982
Why did I blow up your phone?

612
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,403
You were worried. It's understandable.

613
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,373
I'm getting better.

614
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,214
But I don't think I'm fully there yet.

615
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,804
Every time I hear an ambulance, I…

616
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:03,059
That's okay.

617
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,688
You're still recovering.

618
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,692
Will I ever fully heal?

619
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,322
I didn't know I was this fragile
like glass.

620
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:21,787
No, you have a bulletproof mentality.

621
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,040
That's from The Man from Nowhere.

622
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,334
"This is bulletproof, you son of…"

623
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,837
Son of what? Did you just curse?

624
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,005
A foul mouth?

625
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,801
I didn't. I reacted quickly
and stopped before I said it.

626
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,386
What's wrong with cursing?

627
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,472
It helps.

628
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:43,767
So what if it's just glass,
not bulletproof?

629
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,644
You can go to a hospital if it breaks.

630
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:48,355
That's what my profession is for.

631
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:52,317
You're right.

632
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,366
Still…

633
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:02,994
I'm going to

634
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:08,333
do my best to stay strong.

635
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:19,344
I wanted to tell her this.

636
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,389
"It's okay to break down.

637
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:25,308
You don't have to fight it.

638
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,937
It's okay to hold on
to somebody as you get back up."

639
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:38,405
And I almost slipped
and told her this as well.

640
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,284
"I hope…

641
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:46,496
that I can be that somebody."

642
00:52:58,258 --> 00:52:59,926
Look at how handsome Young-do is.

643
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,929
-Shouldn't you be working?
-I'm taking a break.

644
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,056
-Just a breather.
-I see.

645
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,475
But why are you resting at my office?

646
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:10,186
Seeing you comforts me.

DIRECTOR SEO HA-NEUL

648
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:12,981
Why?

649
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:16,234
Because at least
I've been in a relationship before.

650
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,486
I have too.

651
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,946
But it was in your dreams.

652
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:22,157
Do you believe that?

653
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:24,743
I want to believe

654
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,787
that there's someone lonelier than me.

655
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:31,124
It's not true.
I have a messy private life.

656
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,794
I'm actually a pretty promiscuous man.

657
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:39,549
Do you know what a libertine is?
I've done all sorts of things.

658
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,593
That's the kind of person I am.

659
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:44,512
Libertine reminds me of saltine crackers.

660
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:46,723
Would you like some saltine crackers?

661
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:48,767
I'll have my own snack.

662
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,560
In your dreams?

663
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:57,609
My father's belongings are in here,

664
00:53:57,692 --> 00:54:00,362
but I'm not sure you'll find
what you're looking for.

665
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,530
-Look around.
-Thank you.

This is Mom's honey.

669
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,688
I have my own bottle,
so you can have it for yourself.

670
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,106
Let me go to the restroom.

671
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:49,054
The man you're meeting is over there.

672
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,816
Excuse me.

673
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:47,403
May I have a word with you?

674
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,326
Okay.

675
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,038
We met at the hotel, right?

676
00:56:58,665 --> 00:56:59,707
Yes.

677
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,210
If you work there, you must know who I am.

678
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:06,047
I do.

679
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,050
-What's your name?
-Kang Da-jeong.

680
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:12,262
Do you also know
a man who looks exactly like me?

681
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,028
Choi Jeong-min.

682
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,198
Do you know him?

683
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:42,250
What makes you think you can ask me
such a question?

684
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:47,005
Are you a bereaved family member? Do you
want my apology since I look like him?

685
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:50,383
I don't care what happened to you.

686
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:53,052
It has nothing to do with me anyway. So…

687
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,389
you'd better not be curious about me.

688
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,766
Never again.

689
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,276
Don't look at me

690
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:11,529
like that…

691
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,283
ever again.

692
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:27,212
-What's going on?
-Ian.

693
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:31,216
A few people mistook him like you did.

694
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,801
Please understand.

695
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:37,722
It's okay.

696
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,727
I'm the one who made a mistake,
and he's right.

697
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:45,897
I knew he wasn't that man,

698
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,816
but I couldn't stop staring at him
or feeling afraid.

699
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:51,277
Of course, he's offended.

700
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:56,199
I'm sorry.

701
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,748
I apologize for raising my voice.

702
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,052
Should I drive you home?

703
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,931
No, get back to work. I'm okay.

704
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,308
Have something to drink.

705
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:29,649
You must be extremely curious
and confused.

706
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:33,194
It is a bit baffling.

707
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,614
But as long as you're okay, I'm fine.

708
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:40,910
I'm okay.

709
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:44,289
I actually feel relieved.

710
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:53,548
I thought he was a ghost.

711
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,054
But he talked and got mad.

712
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:04,559
He's just a person.

713
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,645
I'm not as scared as before.

714
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:14,986
Let's go inside.

715
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,617
It's a record of adoptions, right?

716
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,994
The pastor's surname was Kim,

717
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:25,455
so why did he register them all as Hongs?

718
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,125
We need to figure out
what these numbers mean.

719
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:34,464
Here.

720
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,800
THE START OF A SUCCESSION BATTLE AT MAJIN?

721
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:39,719
Isn't it odd?

722
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,471
It's not a face you see every day.

723
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:53,858
Yes?

724
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,737
Good work today. You can go home.

725
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:58,863
Bye.

726
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:03,201
I had Detective Park
tail him for a few days.

727
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:06,287
Nothing stood out.
He went from the hotel to the hospital,

728
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:07,622
jogged, then bought a book.

729
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:13,127
Can we run this list
by the travel records?

730
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:15,380
If this really is a record
of illegal adoptions…

731
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,256
You think they're twins, right?

732
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:32,230
Hello, Chief.

733
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,775
Yes. I'm still here.

734
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:38,486
Yes, sir.

735
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:16,482
POLICE LINE
DO NOT CROSS

736
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:17,622
Did Santa give you those?

737
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:19,790
Did he finish pooping?

738
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:23,127
Yes. He did.

739
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:26,672
But why didn't I see him back there?

740
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:30,092
He was hiding underneath the tree.

741
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:32,720
I see.

742
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:35,097
Then where is he now?

743
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:38,059
Is he still underneath the tree?

744
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,020
Or did he drive back home?

745
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:44,649
I'm not sure.

746
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:54,992
It wasn't me who patted you on the head.

747
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:56,661
Dummy.

748
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:58,746
What?

749
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:37,910
If I may,

750
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:42,039
can I ask about your relationship
with Choi Jeong-min?

751
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:43,833
I don't need to answer that.

752
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:47,837
It can feel tingly and excited.
It's understandable. Right?

753
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:49,714
Why? It was nice.

754
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:52,299
This is why you're a flirt.

755
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:53,759
There are so many weird people.

756
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,012
I SEND YOU THIS SONG
JU YOUNG-DO

757
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:57,847
UNSOLVED

758
01:06:57,930 --> 01:06:58,973
Don't forget

759
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,726
how far I went for you.

760
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:03,227
What crazy things

761
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,022
do you want to do?

762
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:10,818
