00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,419
EPISODE 15

2
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,423
Then what should we call
our dear Da-jeong now?

3
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,175
Leave out "our dear."

4
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,302
She's not your dear. She's my Da-jeong.

5
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,974
Then is she like
my younger sister-in-law now?

6
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,727
More like older. You were born in August.

7
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,397
Then let's all just be
brothers and sisters.

8
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:50,068
I'll have to ask my mom
if she wants to adopt more kids.

9
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,488
All right. Then let's all be friends.

10
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,281
Let's be casual. What do you say?

11
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:58,368
I say no. I've seen too many people

12
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,995
completely lose their manners
when they get casual.

13
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,834
Then should we use honorifics
like we're at work?

14
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,212
Hey, are you always like that?

15
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,882
Do you always say everything in your mind
until people agree with you?

16
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,844
Eun-ha, you remind me of a crow.

17
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,470
-What?
-What?

18
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,306
Crows are actually very smart.

19
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,351
They ignore other slow-witted crows

20
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:26,062
and have the ability
to infer cause and effect.

21
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,566
-Again, it was a compliment.
-Of course.

22
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:34,237
Oh, no. Ga-yeong can't come today.

23
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,655
-What?
-She can't?

24
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,949
We were going to watch
the last episode together.

25
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,659
We can watch it by ourselves.

26
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,619
I'll go get the projector.

27
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:45,165
No, I'll bring it.
You stay here, Da-jeong.

28
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,836
Gosh.

29
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,891
Let's say we'll all just
be formal with each other.

30
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,517
How do you two address each other?

31
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:08,563
I'm sure it's not too formal,
like "Ms. Kang, Mr. Ju."

32
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,024
We do call each other Ms. Kang and Mr. Ju.

33
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,736
I forgot what Young-do called
his ex-girlfriend.

34
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,113
Boo-boo. Ssing-ssing. Something like that.

35
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,448
-What the…
-Hey.

36
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,074
What's with you? Cut it out.

37
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,160
Right, it was Ssong-ssong.

38
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,454
Her last name was Song. Ssong-ssong.

39
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,248
I see. My ex was a Song too.

40
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,583
Ssong-ssong.

41
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,464
I can't believe I get to see
Young-do dating again.

42
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,466
I'm deeply moved,

43
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,301
Da-jeong, da-da-da.

44
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,594
Cut it out already.

45
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,558
What? It's all in the past anyway.
Right, Da-jeong?

46
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,728
Of course. I've dated about 100 guys too.

47
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,564
A hundred? A hundred guys?

48
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,234
Young-do was the first
to teach me how to drink.

49
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,736
He's allowed to drink a little
on a day like this, no?

50
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,613
He'd better not.

51
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,033
Did he used to be a heavy drinker?

52
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,203
He used to drink a lot for a while.

53
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:09,123
No, Young-do didn't actually drink a lot.
He just stayed until the end.

54
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,875
He was the "designated cleaner."

55
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,296
He'd wake up drunk friends
and get them a cab to send them home.

56
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,924
Then he sent his girlfriend away too.

57
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,551
Into Young-do's heart

58
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,642
But he sounds exactly like Da-jeong.

59
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,144
She used to be the "designated helper."

60
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,356
She'd tie drunk girls' hair
and pat their backs when they threw up.

61
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,442
Then she patted her boyfriend's heart too.

62
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,694
-I see.
-Right.

63
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,612
Was that okay?

64
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,865
Da-jeong, Da-jeong, da-da-da.

65
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,830
How many tranquilizer darts is that?

66
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,293
That's enough to…

67
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,169
Young-do.

68
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,381
Da-jeong, where should I put this?

69
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:07,473
Hey, nice definition, nice ambiance.

70
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,808
Will you be like this?

71
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,727
You won't help me out?

72
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,979
What's with you?

73
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,692
Okay.

74
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,697
Take this. The car is yours.

75
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,075
Sorry? The car is mine? What is this?

76
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,828
That car is now yours.

77
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,458
Excuse me, sir.

78
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,752
Sir, wait.

79
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,545
I…

80
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,883
This is really mine?

81
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,843
This car is mine?

82
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,345
Princess.

83
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,140
Is that you?

84
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:52,685
Is that really you? What happened?

85
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,150
I came a long way to see you.

86
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,653
I missed you.

87
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,371
Gosh, can we really do this?

88
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,126
-Even Coke is expensive at this hotel.
-Hey, look.

89
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,586
I decided to give up everything…

90
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,089
The photos are on the phone.
Why did you print them?

91
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,674
Prints are always better
than digital files.

92
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,301
You're so weird.

93
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,013
Young-do, take a look at this.

94
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,224
It's you and Da-jeong.

95
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,267
Cheol-do.

96
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,520
-Thanks.
-You have nothing to worry about.

97
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,647
-You can now stay with me here.
-This is me.

98
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,525
-It's really clear.
-Drink.

99
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,860
-Cool.
-This is mine. This one too.

100
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,947
THE PRINCESS OF FOREVER

101
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,299
What? Who are you?

102
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,762
-Honey.
-"Honey"?

103
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:17,395
THE PRINCESS OF FOREVER
TO BE CONTINUED IN SEASON 2

104
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,231
GUGU BUILDING

105
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,013
Who did you draw?

106
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,931
It's obviously us.

107
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,184
Oh, I see.

108
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,978
Why? Is it weird?

109
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,483
Do you remember
how I analyzed a kid's drawing?

110
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,776
There was a lot of rain,

111
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,778
which means he was under lots of stress.

112
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,615
He didn't draw any hands
because he couldn't communicate--

113
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,408
Don't do that. Analyzing me.

114
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:15,995
All right.

115
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,960
I told you to stop it.

116
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,587
I didn't say anything.

117
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,924
You just smirked as if you found out
something I'm not aware of.

118
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,259
All right. I'll stop.

119
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,437
No, tell me. I need to know.

120
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,564
No, you'll grab me by the neck again.

121
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,234
It's something that weird?

122
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,444
No, it's nothing.

123
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,488
If we're done cleaning up, let's--

124
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,906
Tell me. What is it?

125
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,702
You really won't regret this?

126
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,296
First off, you drew
our eyes round and big.

127
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,048
You want to view the world clearly.

128
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,591
You're willing to communicate.

129
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,302
It goes well with your career.

130
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,472
And?

131
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,851
In this portrait,

132
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:25,147
the thing that stands out the most
is your hair.

133
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,443
And you drew lots of hair.

134
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,071
When adults draw a portrait,

135
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:35,241
their eyebrows and hair mean energy.

136
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,160
Sexual energy, in particular.

137
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,580
In other words,

138
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,625
it means sexual desire.

139
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,043
My gosh, unbelievable.

140
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,044
My goodness.

141
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,467
Where are you going, Da-jeong?
This is your place.

142
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,355
-She wouldn't tell me.
-Gosh, why not?

143
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,733
-She never…
-Hey.

144
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:12,069
-Hey, you're here.
-I heard Da-jeong is dating.

145
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,324
You just can't keep a secret, can you?

146
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,452
-You and your big mouth.
-But it's good news.

147
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,455
What does he do? How old is he?

148
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:26,083
I heard he's good-looking
enough to be an actor.

149
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,169
-Da-jeong's pretty too.
-Right.

150
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,339
If she were my girl,
I would've had her enter a beauty pageant.

151
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:35,718
How do you two live
in this tiny Gangneung with your nosiness?

152
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,513
And do you have nothing to ask
except such cliche questions?

153
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,724
So who is he?

154
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,517
Just tell us.

155
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,561
What does he do?

156
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,564
You're being so weird, Mi-ran.

157
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,399
You would've been the first

158
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,319
to come and tell us
all kinds of details to show off.

159
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:57,573
Why? Does he have some kind of flaw?

160
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,993
Has he been married once before,
or is he disabled in any way--

161
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,621
-What?
-Why do you keep digging for flaws?

162
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,957
How can you blurt out everything
that comes to your mind?

163
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,542
What's wrong with you?

164
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,960
Who cares if he's not well?

165
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,254
So what if he was once married?

166
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,048
You should apologize!

167
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,966
Why would Da-jeong see such a man?

168
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,176
Goodness.

169
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,720
-Mi-ran, do you want something?
-Forget it.

170
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,973
Stop making me flip out
and keep flipping jeon.

171
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,767
Hey…

172
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,395
You should be happy.
Why are you getting angry?

173
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,980
-She has an odd personality. Gosh!
-What's with you?

174
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:56,757
Hello?

175
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,469
Hello, ma'am.
This is Lee Yun-ha of Myeongin Card.

176
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,264
We have a brand-new loan
we'd like to offer you today--

177
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,807
I'm sorry, I don't need it.

178
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,028
What's wrong with you!

179
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,447
Are you okay?

180
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,674
I thought you'd lose my money
from running this so-called cafe,

181
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,758
but you made a profit.

182
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:42,761
Great work.

183
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,021
You did well too.

184
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,443
I'm done eating. May I go?

185
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,823
I came to see you after months.

186
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,617
That's why I ate with you.

187
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:06,869
Just stay.

188
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,414
You praised Cheol-do
for running the business well.

189
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,210
Now, you're going to tell me
to get married.

190
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,796
I feel sick when I hear that so…

191
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,799
Then what? You'll never get married?

192
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,183
Have you ever

193
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,520
asked me what kind of life

194
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,689
I want to live?

195
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,567
As if you'd tell me.

196
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,320
Have you ever really listened?

197
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,239
-Just let it go.
-You let it go.

198
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,244
You can because he's your dad.

199
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:52,915
He never failed to attend your entrance
and graduation ceremonies.

200
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,125
You never even bother to call me,

201
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:59,046
yet you're still that heartbroken
over how I didn't go to your graduation?

202
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:01,966
Yes.

203
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,929
You've lived your whole life
only as Cheol-do's father.

204
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,348
When anyone called you at home,

205
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,767
they'd ask for Cheol-do's dad.

206
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,853
No one asked for Eun-ha's dad.

207
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,356
And the cafe?

208
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,609
If anything, I worked harder.

209
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,865
Have you ever complimented me
saying I've done well,

210
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,950
acknowledging my hard work?

211
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,495
Have I ever been more than a daughter
you need to marry off?

212
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,330
Have I ever

213
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,458
been a beloved child to you?

214
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,616
You must've been busy all by yourself.
Sorry.

215
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,492
No, I wasn't too busy.

216
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:14,413
But about Ms. Ahn Ga-yeong
who calls you Galaxy…

217
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,249
Yes, is she here again? Where is she?

218
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,878
No, she's not here, but the news said
she got into an accident.

219
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,048
An accident? Not a love scandal?

220
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,177
When the car suddenly stopped,
her foot got stuck.

221
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,305
She sprained her ankle a little,

222
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,224
but she won't have any trouble on set.

223
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,769
Yes.

224
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,985
-Are you all right?
-Yes, I'm fine.

225
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,695
Then I'll go wrap things up.

226
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,781
-Sure, go ahead.
-Okay.

227
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,292
Hey.

228
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,128
No, I'm fine. It's not so bad.

229
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,758
What?

230
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:11,178
Anyway, I can't work out,
so don't snarl at me.

231
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,221
Okay?

232
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,975
-It was true!
-Are they really…

233
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,893
Jin-ho, I'll call you later.

234
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,693
-It's true!
-Are they really going out?

235
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,945
-He's so handsome.
-I'm a fan!

236
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,033
Ahn Ga-yeong.

237
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,164
Ga-yeong.

238
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:41,959
It's really Ahn Ga-yeong.

239
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:45,045
Goodness, Patrick. Hello.

240
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,755
I heard your cousin is here--

241
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,258
-My gosh.
-They're really dating.

242
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,094
-What is this?
-Are they really dating?

243
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,262
Are you crazy?

244
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,514
You can't shock me like this.

245
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,184
I was more shocked.

246
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,021
What will you do now?

247
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,856
What are you going to do?

248
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,363
-They really must be going out.
-I told you, didn't I?

249
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,659
I'll get there in an hour.

250
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,619
You're headed to Gangneung, right?

251
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,246
Make sure you don't go to Busan.

252
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,207
Oh, it says something on the sign.

253
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,584
What is it?

254
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,461
Is it telling me to shut up again?

255
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,339
No. It says, "Ju Young-do, drive safely."

256
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,258
I'll call you when I leave.

257
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:32,760
Okay.

258
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,099
EUN-HA

259
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:40,893
Hey.

260
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,103
I'm on the rooftop,

261
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,022
and someone just showed up.

262
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,483
Can I leave her in your place?

263
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,735
-Is it Ms. Ahn Ga-yeong?
-Yes.

264
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,823
But she's not alone.
She came with something tall and handsome.

265
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,912
Open the door, give her water,
and order some dumplings for her too.

266
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,663
The number is under the sink.

267
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,207
She has nowhere else to go.

268
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,960
I'll do that. Drive safely.

269
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,421
Okay. Did you get in?

270
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,008
Hello? Yes.

271
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,843
Yes, I just got in.

272
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,804
Yes. One second.

273
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,598
-It's Da-jeong.
-Okay.

274
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,684
I'm sorry.

275
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,895
I'm about to be a huge nuisance again.

276
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,981
I might end up
repaying you for generations.

277
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,860
I'll behave as much as I can.

278
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:32,986
Thank you.

279
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,322
You should thank her too.

280
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,368
Thank you so much.

281
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,871
Yes, I'll thank you in person later.

282
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,124
Bye.

283
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:46,875
Okay.

284
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,003
Hey, okay.

285
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,339
Don't worry about them.

286
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,299
Bye.

287
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:01,932
You must be thirsty.

288
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,686
Lemon water and ice is
refilled automatically here,

289
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,020
so feel free to have some.

290
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,566
The number of your favorite
dumpling place is under the sink.

291
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,901
Let me know if you need anything.

292
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,778
Please excuse me.

293
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,366
-Thanks, Galaxy Park.
-Sure.

294
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,096
Thank you for waiting.

295
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,098
Here's your order.

296
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,016
Thank you.

297
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,103
Enjoy.

298
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,199
You're here.

299
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,659
Yes, I'm here.

300
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,078
You've been coming often.

301
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,039
I have.

302
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,166
Mom, what should I do?

303
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,085
Nothing. Just go wait at home.

304
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,838
You work all the time in Seoul.

305
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,220
Mom.

306
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:22,888
Yes?

307
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,768
Mom, there's…

308
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,980
something I want to tell you.

309
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,965
I'm sorry.

310
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,386
What?

311
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,682
Although I wasn't able to raise you well,

312
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,435
you grew into a good person on your own.

313
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,773
Yet I still want to take credit for it.

314
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,027
You're like my winning lottery ticket,

315
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,572
so I guess I don't want to let you go.

316
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,578
I've become such a petty person.

317
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,755
Mom, but you know…

318
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,928
Young-do is a really great person.

319
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,599
I know.

320
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,603
So I'm trying.

321
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,608
I'm so petty, aren't I?

322
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,244
Of course not, Mom.

323
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,670
You can never be petty to me.

324
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,757
You're the least petty person I know.

325
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,803
Thanks for saying that.

326
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,270
-Let's go back inside. I have to work.
-Okay.

327
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:36,396
Okay.

328
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,490
Let's go.

329
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,420
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

330
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,881
PATIENT: MA ***-GUK
SURGEON: IAN CHASE

331
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:30,659
I'd also like to ask
if he had anyone he could lean on.

332
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,912
Had there been someone. Just one person…

333
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,039
What if he had no one?

334
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,959
Then I would've reached out to him

335
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,418
and said that it wasn't…

336
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,381
too late to change his ways.

337
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,636
Even if I were in your shoes,

338
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,681
I would have said the same thing.

339
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,600
Even if it's you…

340
00:23:57,144 --> 00:24:00,147
who needs my help, I will help you.

341
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,797
You wanted to know what I was hiding.

342
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,382
I did.

343
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,969
And I'm guessing

344
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,930
you came to tell me.

345
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,183
I don't know where Hwang Jae-sik is.

346
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:37,809
However,

347
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,979
I do know who has him.

348
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,141
Who is it?

349
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:22,812
Who are you?

350
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,814
It's me, you bastard.

351
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,359
Hwang Jae-sik.

352
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:31,404
You're under arrest for murdering
Kim Myeong-ja, Lee Jeong-beom,

353
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,658
Cho Gwang-hun, Noh Hyeon-ju, threatening
Choi Jeong-min, and housebreaking.

354
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:39,120
I'm sure you know everything you say
could be used against you.

355
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,540
Get an attorney if you want.

356
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,208
Hello, I'm here.

357
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,003
Hey. It must've been a long drive.

358
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,046
-Have you eaten?
-I have.

359
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,425
You can't lie,
so I guess you really did eat.

360
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,304
We need to clean up.
Do you mind waiting a bit?

361
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,390
No, I'd like to help out too.

362
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,655
Mom.

363
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,700
We cleaned up everything.
Let's go home right away.

364
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,000
Da-jeong.

365
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,294
Can you grab
three popsicles from the mart?

366
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,756
-I'll go.
-Let's go together.

367
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,507
No, Da-jeong, you go.

368
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,052
Young-do, you and I need to talk.

369
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,558
Okay, Mom.

370
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,627
You must be disappointed in me.

371
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,631
I adored you so much,

372
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,301
then now that I know
you're sick and were married once,

373
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,513
I seem to have changed
my opinion of you, right?

374
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:04,808
Not at all.

375
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,269
And I'm grateful
you were willing to meet me.

376
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:13,900
I was…

377
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,197
awfully bruised
because of this love I was in.

378
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,325
Literally, not figuratively.

379
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:30,500
I'd turn red, then blue.

380
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,425
I'd wear scarves even in summer,

381
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,553
so all the neighbors would talk about me.

382
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:49,310
And when I left
such an awful guy on my own,

383
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,023
I still…

384
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,445
ended up crying.

385
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,664
I must've been more heartbroken

386
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,834
because you're such a good person.

387
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,888
It's okay to be sick.

388
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,767
Don't hide anything or be sorry.
Just tell me everything.

389
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,603
Tell me what I can do for you.

390
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,356
Tell me what you can eat
and what I shouldn't do.

391
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,613
And as you told Da-jeong,

392
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,533
do your best

393
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,912
to live as long as you can.

394
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,792
Can you do that?

395
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,587
I'll make sure to do that.

396
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,467
I'll keep my eyes on you.

397
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,847
-Thank you.
-Don't thank me.

398
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,934
I should be sorry a little longer.

399
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:17,774
I guess I'm just
another materialistic mother.

400
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:31,287
Stop standing there rustling
and bring the popsicles over.

401
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,375
Okay, Mom.

402
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,003
I got all of your favorites.

403
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,777
Let's eat breakfast.

404
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,281
Yes. It's been a while
since I had a home-cooked meal.

405
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,496
What are you doing? Let's go.

406
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,166
-Let's go.
-To where?

407
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,544
Oh, Da-jeong is really picky,

408
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,337
so I can never cook for her.

409
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,423
She'd complain about onion peels,

410
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,091
uncooked beans,

411
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:27,135
that there's no kimchi
in kimchi fried rice.

412
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,095
She'd nag at me all the time.

413
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,763
Come on out.

414
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,476
What did you eat as you grew up?

415
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,104
Pizza.

416
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,275
Here.

417
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,193
Mom, me too.

418
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,154
Eat up.

419
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,786
This pizza is great.

420
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,916
Remember. This is
my mom's most delicious dish.

421
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,543
I see. It's really good.

422
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,753
Isn't it?

423
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,047
Come by whenever you want.

424
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,382
I might make you kimchi stew next time.

425
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,176
No, it's all right.

426
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,345
I'd like to have this next time as well.

427
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,306
Will you? Right.

428
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,141
My pizza is great, isn't it?

429
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,392
-Yes.
-Eat.

430
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,198
Come with me. Let's go grocery shopping.

431
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,033
Okay.

432
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:33,701
Mom.

433
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,620
What will you do with Mr. Ju?

434
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,915
What do you think? I'll boss him around.

435
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,668
A bit of hazing, you know.

436
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,002
Oh, dear.

437
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,714
You can stay here
until the part-timer gets here.

438
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,341
Let's go.

439
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:02,939
Are you ready?

440
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,233
Ready for what?

441
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:10,571
Have you ever thought
about how a fish would feel

442
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,491
when it spins round and round
in a microwave?

443
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,660
No.

444
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,998
You'll find out soon enough. Buckle up.

445
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,549
BUCKWHEAT JEON

446
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:31,634
Stay here. I'll get some fruit.

447
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,011
Say hi to him.

448
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,429
-Okay.
-All right.

449
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,388
Take your time.

450
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,098
Wait, I…

451
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,851
Hey.

452
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,562
You look just like you did on TV.

453
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,814
-What's your name?
-Ju Young-do, ma'am.

454
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,691
My gosh, even his name sounds cool.

455
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,109
What do you do for a living?

456
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,194
She wouldn't tell us anything.

457
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:51,904
I'm a psychiatrist.

458
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,948
Goodness, this is great.

459
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,867
My daughter works,

460
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,077
so I babysit
my ten-year-old granddaughter.

461
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,705
But she gets distracted way too easily.

462
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:03,332
She'd be on her phone
with the TV on in front of her.

463
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,877
She'd eat while
playing a game on her phone,

464
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,879
then she'd call her friends too.

465
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:10,757
Does this mean she's ill?

466
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,384
-No, there are lots of kids like her.
-There are?

467
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,011
If she's still ten years old,

468
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:18,139
you should guide her
to use her phone properly--

469
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,307
Just lock it.

470
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,391
-Lock it?
-Lock it?

471
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,851
This thing. I'll let you know.

472
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:22,810
-Okay.
-Anyway,

473
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,396
how do you stop someone
from having affairs?

474
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,939
-Is he having affairs?
-Hey!

475
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,150
No way, are you crazy?

476
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,735
He is, isn't he?

477
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:34,739
It's not about me. It's about Mak-ryeon.

478
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,783
Darn it, I knew he'd be like that.

479
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,117
Right?

480
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,994
There's only one way to stop him.

481
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,164
She should get a talisman
and stick it in his underwear.

482
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:46,000
-What?
-No one gets a talisman these days.

483
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,335
-My gosh.
-Come on.

484
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,879
Da-jeong's boyfriend will laugh at us.

485
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:52,256
-We aren't like that.
-That's embarrassing.

486
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,509
She can go see
a fortune-teller or a counselor

487
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,804
because there are
positive effects in sharing her story

488
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,056
-with other people.
-See?

489
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:03,267
But it's not very easy
for experts to give advice.

490
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:07,355
But it could be a little dangerous to
leave something like this to non-experts--

491
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,731
Mi-ran knows this one place.

492
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,983
-Right.
-She recently got a talisman.

493
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,193
You should ask her.

494
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,155
-Da-jeong, you're here.
-Goodness.

495
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,116
-Hello.
-Hey.

496
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,660
Where did my mom go?

497
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:23,663
Mi-ran went to get some fruit.

498
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:29,001
Goodness, Da-jeong.
You came to get your hubby, didn't you?

499
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,211
Tell me about it.

500
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,754
You two can run along.

501
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,215
Let's see. Here.

502
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,260
Run over there and grab some hotteok.

503
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:40,513
Only 5,000 won? You're so cheap.
Give him another 5,000 won.

504
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,640
-Give him more.
-It's 5,000 won for 10.

505
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,851
-Goodbye, I'll come again.
-Okay, bye.

506
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,227
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

507
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,104
You know that we're her aunties, right?

508
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,732
You'll be in trouble
if you do her wrong, okay?

509
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,485
Of course. First off,
I'll cut you like I cut raw fish.

510
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,654
I have a fryer at my place,
so I'll fry you,

511
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:59,240
then put gochujang on you.
That'll hurt, right?

512
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,242
I'm going to flip you over, okay?

513
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,744
-Be careful.
-Be good to her.

514
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,788
Do you get it? Okay.

515
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,291
I'm sorry. I didn't think
she would abandon you.

516
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,584
This is a first.

517
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,043
Is the hazing over?

518
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,379
Then carry this.

519
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:17,049
Here. You take this. And this. Come.

520
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,134
Okay.

521
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,645
I heard Da-jeong and Young-do
went to Gangneung.

522
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,440
Yes, I heard.

523
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,067
Should we go too?

524
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,737
-But we did not long ago.
-Not like that.

525
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,865
You want to tell your mom?

526
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,660
Is it too early?

527
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,039
I'm not sure.

528
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,500
She already knows you well.

529
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,215
That's the problem. She knows everything.

530
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,551
She knows who my dad is,

531
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,804
how I was a delinquent in middle school,

532
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,932
the boys I've dated,

533
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,601
and what I'm like when I'm drunk.

534
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,102
Do you think I don't know?

535
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,897
We first met when I was 12.

536
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:14,774
I remember your bangs.

537
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,110
Your mom will be shocked.

538
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,071
Then what about your dad?

539
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,578
Let's take our time.

540
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,923
When will you return to Seoul?

541
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,884
I mean, it's not that I'm bored.

542
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,886
I just miss my bestie a little.

543
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,639
I'm still in Gangneung.

544
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:48,224
I think I'll stay a bit longer.

545
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,060
Is your boyfriend gone?

546
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,230
He still has to work.

547
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,483
But you're in Gangneung? That pizza place?

548
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,027
How did you know?

549
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,780
I see. I have my sources.

550
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:08,035
All right, don't mind me,
and have fun on your date.

551
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:09,745
Okay.

552
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,882
You were a part
of the in-crowd in Gangneung.

553
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,175
You have many aunties.

554
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,138
They're the ones who fed me.

555
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,765
I almost grew up
eating uncooked beans in rice

556
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,976
and chewing on onion peels.

557
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,060
Oh, dear.

558
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:38,107
You have to try this
since you're in Gangneung with me.

559
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,860
-This is my soul food.
-I see.

560
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:43,863
So this is why you eat tteokbokki
when you get stressed out.

561
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,699
How old were you when you first had this?

562
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:49,618
Eleven years old.

563
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,620
Maybe 12.

564
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:56,042
Lots of neural networks are formed
when you're around ten years old.

565
00:38:56,125 --> 00:39:00,588
The imprinting effect. I still root
for the baseball team I loved then.

566
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:05,634
And that's why you still love candy.

567
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,890
That's because it was from my first love.

568
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,150
I used to come here often
with Eun-ha in middle school.

569
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,945
We promised to write down

570
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,573
the names of the guys
we come to like in the future.

571
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,868
Should we write our names?

572
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,536
Sure.

573
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:40,753
DA-JEONG, YOUNG-DO

574
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,006
DA-JEONG, YOUNG-DO

575
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,222
Hey.

576
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,683
Eun-ha's name is here too.

577
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,685
Tae-jeong's name is beside hers.

578
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:57,686
Goodness.

579
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,189
That's odd. Their names aren't common.

580
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,567
I'll show it to her later.

581
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,657
You have to go back to Seoul, right?

582
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,492
Oh.

583
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,995
That's why I got this.

584
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,626
I wanted to give it to you
at home yesterday, but I couldn't.

585
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,338
Open it. I'll get some water.

586
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,660
Did you get me two watches
for my two hands?

587
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,996
So that I can look at both
to be more punctual?

588
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:58,539
Oh, dear.

589
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,499
One is for your mother.

590
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:02,543
My gosh.

591
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,464
I didn't want it to seem like a bribe.

592
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,090
Could you give it to her for me?

593
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,220
She'll be thrilled.

594
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,225
How did you come up
with the idea to get watches?

595
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,354
I wanted to give time as a present.

596
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,649
It means I'll be with you for a long time.

597
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,154
So it's like a promise.

598
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,993
Thank you.

599
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:44,877
Let's eat.

600
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,617
-What is it?
-Come to the convenience store.

601
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,702
Why?

602
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:20,871
You'll see when you come.

603
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,174
Darn it.

604
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,433
Go sit with him.

605
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,562
If you're worried, you do it.

606
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,857
I'll only end up arguing with him.

607
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:58,993
Can't you just give up?

608
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:02,037
Give up on what?

609
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:06,500
Dad won't change.

610
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,044
He'll be rude to everyone,

611
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,755
he'll keep showing off his money,

612
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:15,426
and he'll think women have to
get married and have kids.

613
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:17,928
And he will continue…

614
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,806
to grow older and smaller.

615
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,392
So I should just put up with him?

616
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:24,768
At the very least,

617
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,438
you were never beaten.

618
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:32,610
I was beaten a lot
until I got into high school.

619
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,946
Back then, I also despised him

620
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,657
to death.

621
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,790
But I learned to give up.

622
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:51,128
We aren't such loving twins who get sick

623
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,464
when the other one gets sick either.

624
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,804
And Dad is just a dad.

625
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:04,350
Even if you don't like him,
he's still our dad.

626
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:15,819
Dad.

627
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,489
What are you doing here?

628
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:24,370
What? Hey, I'm just…

629
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:42,763
That could've been bad.

630
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,685
Why are you wearing sunglasses this late?

631
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,020
And the crutch?

632
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,359
Hello.

633
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,863
Wait, you don't know who I am?

634
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,158
Who are you?

635
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:06,120
I see. You don't watch TV.

636
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:09,498
Hello, I'm Ahn Ga-yeong, an actress.

637
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:12,042
I'm the most scandalous and hated person,

638
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,878
Da-jeong's bestie,
and Galaxy Park's close friend.

639
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,004
What's she saying?

640
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,340
So you're Da-jeong's friend?

641
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:23,387
I'm Mun Mi-ran, Da-jeong's mother.

642
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,598
Really? Seriously?

643
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,642
You're her mom, not her sister?

644
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:29,560
How?

645
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,354
Did you have her when you were seven?

646
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:36,859
Where did she find a girl
who says the sweetest things?

647
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:38,652
Have a seat.

648
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:42,030
But how did you know about this place?
Da-jeong isn't even here.

649
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:45,951
Well, our communication fell through.

650
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:47,911
Do you want anything to drink?

651
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,746
I'll get it myself.

652
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,790
Is the fridge over here?

653
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:54,293
I'm the type
who always does things on my own.

654
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:57,546
Everyone has a few boxes of beer
in their fridge, right?

655
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,423
Is this it?

656
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:02,634
What's with this novel and pretty psycho?

657
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,931
Wait.

658
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:13,395
So you're the one
who was married to Young-do?

659
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,231
Ju Young-do, who gave this to me?

660
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,487
We had a wedding.

661
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,946
But we were never registered.

662
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,450
And you're Da-jeong's best friend now?

663
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:28,952
Yes. That's true.

664
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,705
I've watched too much Newflix.

665
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:35,042
I've watched
too many episodes of Stranger Stuff.

666
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:38,587
Where are you going? I'm not done yet.

667
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,758
My dear Ms. Mun, the moon lady.

668
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,098
I got married to live,

669
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,601
and he got married to save me.

670
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:55,103
Others get divorced
because their marriages fail,

671
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,272
but we got divorced
because ours succeeded.

672
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:01,610
I became quite all right in just a year.

673
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,489
So you must be very grateful to me.

674
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,492
I can't believe this.

675
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,286
What am I listening to right now?

676
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:13,872
Anyway, you're saying

677
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,625
you're better now, right?

678
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,546
You don't want
to kill yourself now. Right?

679
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,885
What's with you and Da-jeong?

680
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,721
You're comforting me after hearing this?

681
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:37,813
She must take after you.

682
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,774
Who else would she take after?

683
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,906
If you're better now,

684
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,993
then be grateful and live more diligently.

685
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,870
Be good to Young-do.

686
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,456
And even better to Da-jeong.

687
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,045
I'll do that.

688
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,172
My dear moon lady.

689
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,216
Ms. Mun.

690
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:08,885
Cheers.

691
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:24,359
Listening to your lectures,

692
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:28,614
it seems like you're very tolerant
when it comes to underage delinquents.

693
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:31,074
Do you think their age
and background at home

694
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:34,995
should be taken into consideration
when we punish them?

695
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:37,914
No, I'm sure there is
no one in this world who thinks

696
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,542
their crimes should be forgiven
for those reasons.

697
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,836
I don't think so either.

698
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:48,925
There were three children
walking down the street with bloody feet.

699
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:52,721
Let's say they each met
different types of adults.

700
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,307
Those darned kids.

701
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,185
Come out! Hey!

702
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,395
Don't you lay a finger on them,

703
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,273
or I'll kill you.

704
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:07,486
One kid had a mother
who took her shoes off for her.

705
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:09,363
No one will find you here.

706
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,907
I'll come for you very soon.

707
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:15,035
-What will happen to him if I stay here?
-Another one

708
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:18,121
-He'll be okay.
-was hidden to make him stop

709
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,831
hurting himself for others.

710
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:22,417
-The last one got criticized and abused
-Eat quickly.

711
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,127
instead of shoes or comfort.

712
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,755
-I told you to smile.
-"Some kids don't even have feet.

713
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:29,966
-Don't you dare.
-So don't whine about not having shoes."

714
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:35,347
How do you think that affected the lives
of those three kids?

715
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:38,100
The kid who put on her mother's shoes

716
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:41,019
and the one who couldn't help his brother

717
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:44,898
may live a troubled life
because they couldn't be of help.

718
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:48,110
But they'll eventually
be able to heal their wounds.

719
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:52,948
Because that's guilt, not a crime.

720
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,867
However, the last one.

721
00:49:57,744 --> 00:50:01,248
There could come a moment
when his lonely devastation

722
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:04,334
turns into anger,
because no one saved him.

723
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:08,797
There will come a moment
when there's no turning back for him.

724
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:12,342
Hey, Young-do.

725
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,761
-Come and hold him down.
-What? Cut it out already.

726
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,680
-Hurry up.
-I have to go.

727
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,724
-Come on. Don't go.
-Seriously.

728
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,225
I have to go.

729
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:42,831
JU YOUNG-DO PSYCHIATRY CLINIC

730
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:06,188
The man named Ju Young-do
at the clinic in that building.

731
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,982
I want to see what he looks like.

732
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,117
I thank the medical staff
who participated,

733
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:22,037
especially Dr. Chase,
who was willing to lead

734
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,623
this difficult surgery.

735
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:27,125
As a daughter and a fellow businesswoman,

736
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:30,170
I'll do my best to make sure
the chairman recovers well.

737
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:31,922
Thank you.

738
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,406
Go get Dr. Chase immediately.

739
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:02,828
I'll show him
what it's like to make an enemy of me.

740
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:21,304
Hwang Jae-sik will be punished soon.

741
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:25,725
And there will be reports
on Mr. Choi Jeong-min too.

742
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:30,063
I'm sure you knew that already.

743
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,651
Do you have something else to say?

744
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:42,784
The 18-year-old
who went to find Hwang Jae-sik

745
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,830
wasn't Jeong-min, but me.

746
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:58,758
I had thought that he must be
living a good life in my place.

747
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,263
But his life was more miserable than mine.

748
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:06,224
Take it off.

749
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:07,767
The so-called mother

750
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:10,687
who abandoned me was

751
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,899
lying there dead.

752
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,111
And the man
who used to exploit kids for money

753
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:21,406
had become a worse monster.

754
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:25,744
So as he was dying, I…

755
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,260
Hit me.

756
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,517
Make me look like you.

757
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:53,063
Hit me and make it look
like I was beaten by him.

758
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:58,193
Don't you know how?

759
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,212
Take a cab.

760
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,881
Don't talk to anybody.

761
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:06,428
Stay in the room.

762
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:14,102
I pretended to be my brother
and lied to the police.

763
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,440
When I got home,

764
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:21,943
my mom was lying unconscious.

765
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,197
So I was about to call 119.

766
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:31,745
But he threw a chair at me
to stop me from calling.

767
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:32,871
CHOI JEONG-MIN

768
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:36,207
And then

769
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:39,252
I tried to run away…

770
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:44,591
I heard something as I ran away.

771
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:49,679
He was suddenly on the floor.

772
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,312
Don't forget.

773
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:02,525
A shadow shouldn't covet the light.

774
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,202
Because it'll vanish.

775
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:15,705
And then I found that book.

776
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,085
"'No one wants to live with vermin.

777
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,004
Something that should die must be killed.

778
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,341
And someone has to do that job.'

779
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:29,511
When the man finished talking,

780
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:32,722
people began to give him
a big round of applause."

781
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,517
PURE MURDER

782
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,437
THE MOST SCANDALOUS ONLINE NOVEL OF 1997
GROTESQUE CONFESSIONS OF A MURDERER

783
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:40,730
Did you really write that?

784
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,690
PURE MURDER

785
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:45,610
Prove it.

786
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,909
I thought I could put a stop to it.

787
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:56,913
Just that once.

788
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,960
If those people disappeared,

789
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:09,134
I thought everything would be okay.

790
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:14,264
At this point…

791
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:15,348
No.

792
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,478
Why are you telling me this now?

793
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,778
"I want everything to be over."

794
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:40,707
I WANT EVERYTHING TO BE OVER

795
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:46,546
That's what Jeong-min said.

796
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:58,683
I get that he can get out of touch,
but something didn't feel right.

797
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,769
You said things don't just feel wrong.

798
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:05,982
You said it's because micro-expressions
all show on your face.

799
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:09,319
Do you remember
the last thing Ian Chase said?

800
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:12,071
He said he wanted everything to be over.

801
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,365
He said Choi Jeong-min said that.

802
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:01,246
Wait!

803
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:18,721
Hey!

804
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,226
Have you come for me?

805
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:24,727
Where have you been?

806
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:28,523
How did you find me here?

807
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:32,485
Compared to what I've done for you…

808
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,655
this is nothing.

809
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:37,740
You know that, right?

810
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:38,825
Hey.

811
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,286
There's a problem.

812
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:45,915
But this time, I'll take care of it.
I can do it.

813
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:49,669
No, don't do anything.

814
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,589
I'll take care of it,

815
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:56,551
-just as I always have.
-No, this time, I will.

816
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:00,722
I'll take care of this.

817
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,974
I'll just send someone.

818
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:04,642
I told you not to use anyone--

819
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:20,658
Why did you put your foot under mine?

820
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,495
Is that what you mean?

821
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,080
I'm here as a patient.

822
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:29,042
That way, whatever I say,
you have to keep your mouth shut.

823
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,337
To keep your license.

824
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,130
You have two cars?

825
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,716
You had a different car yesterday.

826
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:42,013
Hey, are you in Korea?

827
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,848
Didn't I tell you

828
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:46,559
never to make anything too precious?

829
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,395
That it'll become your weakness.

830
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,189
So you went to see Ju Young-do

831
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:53,232
like a complete lunatic?

832
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,110
Don't meet
with Kang Da-jeong or Ju Young-do.

833
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,656
And come to the States
once this job is over.

834
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:01,824
Do you understand?

835
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,869
I purposely came early.

836
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:07,705
I don't want her to think I'm a stalker
for real.

837
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:15,046
In that dream of yours,
was there a cat too?

838
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:16,130
Yes.

839
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:18,800
Definitely.

840
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:26,974
Do you like music boxes?
Should we go get one?

841
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:32,730
Excuse me for a minute.

842
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:38,945
I made a mistake

843
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:42,365
and sent that woman a photo.

844
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,576
Erase it before she sees it.

845
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:48,246
Oh, right.

846
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,040
The passcode to her phone is…

847
01:01:57,922 --> 01:01:59,424
DELETE MESSAGE

848
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,057
Anything can kill you.

849
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,518
A glass of liquor,

850
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:12,770
or even a sip of Coke.

851
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,608
If you don't kill yourself,

852
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:23,030
the next body will be found
on the fourth floor of Gugu Building.

853
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:33,499
I have no idea how I can get out of this.

854
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:40,131
I just want everything to be over.

855
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:42,842
Is that your best solution?

856
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,137
Then go ahead and do it.

857
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,414
The shadow

858
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:16,542
will vanish.

859
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,368
Why are you here?

860
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:56,874
I heard you said

861
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,126
that you wanted everything to be over.

862
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:05,383
That sounds way too obvious
for a psychiatrist like me.

863
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:12,682
I came to ask you not to take
the easy way out like a coward,

864
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:16,102
if you want to find peace.

865
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:20,773
If you really wish to be forgiven.

866
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:14,285
Should we turn off our phones today?

867
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:15,369
Really?

868
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:17,204
The lovey-dovey couple disappeared,

869
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:19,624
but an even more lovey-dovey couple
took their place.

870
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:23,377
Why does this seem like a Greek tragedy?

871
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:27,381
I was the shadow, not you.

872
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,926
It says you're enlisting in the army.

873
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:32,762
That's how you save a life.

874
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,514
"I will listen to you."

875
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,808
Even if you dated someone for ten years,

876
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:41,979
the next person you meet
could actually be your true love.

877
