[Plot Love II]

2
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,420
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,680
What's wrong with you?

4
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,160
What are you doing behind my back?

5
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,000
I am just passing by.

6
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,000
Why are you so panicked?

7
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,160
I am not panicked at all.

8
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,190
Is it because of you

9
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,000
that Zheng Xiyue didn't come today?

10
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,190
How could this have anything to do with me?

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,510
Better not let me find out.

12
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,590
I didn't do anything.

13
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,590
What can you find out?

14
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,910
You better have done nothing.

15
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,680
Otherwise I should do something.

16
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,750
Mr. Lu, Chen Shaojie almost

17
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,320
failed to make the cut this time.

18
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,080
His performance

19
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,030
is really unstable.

20
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,000
As I expected.

21
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,960
We cannot

22
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,360
pin all our hopes

23
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,880
on Chen Shaojie.

24
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,390
It seems that you made a wise decision

25
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,720
to recruit Mrs. Lu into the company.

26
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,030
Whether Huanzhen can win the championship

27
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,270
depends on Su Bei.

28
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,270
I believe in her.

29
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,910
By the way,

30
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,110
did you find out

31
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,470
what happened

32
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,550
to Zheng Xiyue?

33
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,630
I contacted her today.

34
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,390
She said she fell from the upstairs,

35
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,630
so she didn't make it to the competition.

36
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,800
Congratulations on

37
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,830
getting the first place.

38
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,240
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

39
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,080
Your performance today was really good.

40
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,550
It was a wise choice for me

41
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,910
to hire you.

42
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,720
Mr. Lu has a good vision.

43
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,910
You were entrusted with a mission
at a critical moment

44
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,360
and you did a good job.

45
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,440
Thank you for your appreciation.

46
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,320
All right.

47
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,750
Let's go home

48
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,080
to celebrate.

49
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,240
But I made an appointment with Ye Ting.

50
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,880
It can be cancelled any time.

51
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:32,830
I will leave you alone.

52
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,830
I am leaving.

53
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,360
I don't want to be the third wheel.

54
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,080
Let's go.

55
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,440
Ye Ting!

56
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,320
Let's go home.

57
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,630
Just the two of us.

58
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,640
Grandma.

59
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,320
Sister-in-law, congratulations on winning
the first place in the preliminary round.

60
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,200
Thank you.

61
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,160
Grandma.

62
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,110
Why are you here?

63
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,000
You don't come to see me,

64
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,830
so I have to come to you.

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,790
How come?

66
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,040
Recently, Bei and I have been busy

67
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,230
with the preliminaries.

68
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,480
We were going to see you tomorrow.

69
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,440
Since Feier is also here,

70
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,510
let's eat something

71
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,350
to celebrate.

72
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,720
What is there to celebrate?

73
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,790
Just the first place
in the provincial preliminary round.

74
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,550
What if she won

75
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,320
the first place in the country?

76
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,670
Grandma, don't say that.

77
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,600
Sister-in-law cares much about the contest.

78
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,950
Dr. Li

79
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,200
brought Su Bei's medical examination report.

80
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,800
Su Bei is weak

81
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,920
and it is difficult for her to get pregnant.

82
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,320
If she wants to get pregnant,

83
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,600
she have to rest at home.

84
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,440
Bei.

85
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,270
The Lu family can give you
everything you want.

86
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,600
Why do you have to work so hard?

87
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,760
Grandma.

88
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,000
You know that

89
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,040
Huanzhen needs Su Bei.

90
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,720
Don't take the company as an excuse.

91
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,920
Even if Su Bei signed a contract
with the company,

92
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,550
she could resign.

93
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,670
What's your opinion?

94
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,440
Sorry,

95
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,550
grandma.

96
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:27,790
So

97
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,390
you don't want to resign.

98
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,110
Grandma.

99
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,510
We are young

100
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,830
and in no rush.

101
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,160
So

102
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,270
you don't have to

103
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,600
ask Su Bei to let go of her career.

104
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,790
Now I just

105
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,200
want a granddaughter-in-law

106
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,600
who focuses

107
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,510
on family.

108
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,320
That's all what I mean.

109
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,390
Today I am here

110
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,200
to give Su Bei

111
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,270
a chance to choose.

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,790
Either

113
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,070
give up the contest

114
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,070
and prepare for pregnancy at home,

115
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,070
or

116
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,200
leave the Lu family.

117
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,760
Grandma.

118
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,760
Shut up.

119
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,880
Su Bei.

120
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,230
Tell me your choice.

121
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,070
Grandma.

122
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,480
I won't give up the contest.

123
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,480
So

124
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,440
you want to leave Nan?

125
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,720
I will not leave Lu Nan either.

126
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,640
Grandma.

127
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,640
I know that the Lu family
can give me everything.

128
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,040
But I don't want to depend on you.

129
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,000
I want to realize my value.

130
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,350
Through my efforts,

131
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,920
I can help Lu Nan.

132
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,720
I didn't give you a third option.

133
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,200
Grandma.

134
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,920
We have our own plans for having a baby.

135
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,390
Don't worry.

136
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,270
And

137
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,480
even if

138
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,000
you drive out Su Bei today,

139
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,040
you can't stop the two of us
from being together.

140
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,110
Nan.

141
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,760
This is the first time
you have contradicted me.

142
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,640
Just for Su Bei?

143
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,030
You...

144
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,280
Aren't you going to

145
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,840
recognize me as grandma?

146
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,030
Grandma, I didn't mean that.

147
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,400
You did.

148
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,000
Grandma.

149
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,960
Our marriage is your decision.

150
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,760
So you think we have no feelings.

151
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,110
But now I have fallen in love with Su Bei.

152
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,320
We will have a baby sooner or later.

153
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,790
Why are you in such a hurry?

154
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,520
Could you think for me

155
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,030
just a little bit?

156
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,400
Lu Nan.

157
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,520
Do you have to protect her like this?

158
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,230
She's my only one in my life.

159
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,760
You!

160
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,880
What if

161
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,760
I insist that the two of you break up?

162
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:28,590
Grandma.

163
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,030
You got us married

164
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,080
and now you want us to break up.

165
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,440
Have you ever thought about my feelings?

166
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,710
I did this for the Lu family

167
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,080
and for your own good.

168
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,880
If so,

169
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,150
you shouldn't keep pushing me.

170
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,080
If so,

171
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,470
you shouldn't let me do
everything you want.

172
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,960
You shouldn't keep forcing me.

173
