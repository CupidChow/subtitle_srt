[Plot Love II]

2
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,420
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,719
It turns out that

4
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,799
Mr. Ye is Ye Ting's

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,280
legendary brother.

6
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,120
Legendary?

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,799
It seems that Ting spoke much ill of me.

8
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,159
Not at all.

9
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:30,400
Ye Ting just told me that

10
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,560
she has a brother who cares
about her very much.

11
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,079
I didn't expect it to be Mr. Ye.

12
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,480
You don't have to be so polite.

13
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,239
Just call me Haochen.

14
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,480
Haochen?

15
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,640
I am not talking to you.

16
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,599
Look at you.

17
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,000
By the way,

18
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:49,840
is Ting causing you trouble

19
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,200
in Huanzhen?

20
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,120
No.

21
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,959
Thanks to Ye Ting for my last game.

22
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,599
I watched the last game.

23
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,280
Your design

24
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,560
is really unique.

25
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,480
Thank you, Mr. Ye.

26
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,199
But I think

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,879
any good work

28
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,479
needs good models to show.

29
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,879
Ye Ting is really good.

30
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,199
She can fully

31
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,639
grasp my design concept

32
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,599
and present it perfectly on stage.

33
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,400
You must be exaggerating.

34
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,840
It's true.

35
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,199
She's great.

36
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,639
Mr. Ye.

37
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,520
The approval from family

38
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,159
is really important to her at this stage.

39
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,360
Ye Ting has always hoped that her dream

40
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,039
can be supported by you.

41
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,039
I just don't want her to work so hard.

42
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,840
Everyone has to work hard.

43
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,599
If you can't realize your self-worth,

44
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,800
you won't be happy

45
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,960
even if you have a good life.

46
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,800
I know you treat Ye Ting well.

47
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,639
But those who have dreams

48
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,280
are full of expectation and hope.

49
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,080
I believe that

50
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,479
you used to have dreams

51
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,759
that made you who you are now.

52
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:07,840
Forget it.

53
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,759
I don't want to worry about you anymore.

54
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,759
Just stay at Huanzhen if you like.

55
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,039
Really? You agreed?

56
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,319
Yes.

57
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,319
You're so persistent,

58
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,960
and I couldn't say no to

59
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,719
what your bestie said.

60
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,960
But

61
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,400
even if you encounter difficulties
in the future,

62
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,439
don't come to me to complain.

63
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,719
How come?

64
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,000
Think about

65
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,680
whose younger sister I am.

66
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,680
All right,

67
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,879
I have to go.

68
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:38,199
Well.

69
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,520
Brother, hold on.

70
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,439
Su Bei is going to work.

71
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,800
Send her for me.

72
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,400
Aren't you going to work?

73
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,680
I...

74
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:49,719
Ouch.

75
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,960
My stomach suddenly hurts.

76
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,759
Ask for a leave for me.

77
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,879
I don't want to be misunderstood

78
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,840
by that narrow-minded Mr. Lu again.

79
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,240
Brother, what are you talking about?

80
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,159
They have broken up.

81
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,120
Ye Ting.

82
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,319
Oops.

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,199
I can't stand it anymore.

84
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,199
Just go.

85
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,039
Go.

86
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,839
Mr. Lu, what's up?

87
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:35,519
Well.

88
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,879
I have a question for you.

89
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:38,920
Okay.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,160
A friend of mine

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,639
broke up with his girlfriend on impulse.

92
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,319
Okay.

93
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,160
He regrets it now.

94
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:47,439
What should he do?

95
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,160
Still the same friend from before?

96
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,120
Yes.

97
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,800
Okay.

98
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,560
Is his girlfriend

99
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,759
surnamed Su?

100
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,480
Do you want to plant trees in Africa again?

101
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,439
Mr. Lu, my bad.

102
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,120
In fact, there was just a misunderstanding

103
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,000
between him and his girlfriend.

104
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,720
They just need to clear
up the misunderstanding.

105
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:14,759
Is it that simple?

106
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,040
Yes.

107
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,360
Mr. Lu.

108
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,000
It's time for our appointment with Mr. Zhu.

109
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,720
Okay.

110
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,040
Is the contract ready?

111
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,160
Yes.

112
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:26,879
Let's go.

113
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,519
Okay.

114
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,759
Tell me in advance

115
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,079
what terms we need to pay attention to

116
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:38,959
when signing a contract.

117
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,279
Mrs. Lu?

118
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,759
Gao Jiming.

119
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,720
Go and hear what they're talking about.

120
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,639
Come on.

121
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,680
Hurry up.

122
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:03,759
By the way, Su Bei,

123
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,879
are you free this Saturday?

124
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,160
Mr. Qi will hold an exhibition here.

125
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,240
Would you like to go see it with me?

126
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,040
Is it Mr. Qi Weiye

127
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,920
who won the gold medal for painting?

128
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,399
Right.

129
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,920
Before, I listened to

130
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
several of his lectures

131
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,680
on painting art and fashion design in China.

132
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:19,879
I benefited a lot.

133
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,399
I can refer you to him

134
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,920
if you want.

135
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,319
This might help you.

136
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,040
Okay, see you on Saturday.

137
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,199
What's wrong?

138
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,480
Nothing.

139
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,399
I have to go.

140
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,319
Okay, see you on Saturday.

141
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:37,720
Okay.

142
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,560
What did they say?

143
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,519
About painting art and fashion design.

144
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,680
And...

145
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,000
Get to the point.

146
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,199
Ye Haochen

147
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,040
asked Mrs. Lu to watch the art exhibition
on Saturday.

148
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,439
Watch the art exhibition?

149
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,279
Let the design department

150
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,680
all work overtime this Saturday.

151
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:15,519
Mr. Lu.

152
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't think it's a good idea.

153
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,199
Why not?

154
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,199
Let's do this.

155
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,079
Mr. Lu, I have an idea.

156
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,680
Well.

157
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,160
Mr. Lu, what's up?

158
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,839
A good Japanese restaurant

159
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,360
has just opened near our company.

160
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,120
Let's try it together.

161
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,279
No, I have something to do tonight.

162
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,560
I'm not talking about tonight.

163
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,879
Let's go together on Saturday night.

164
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,800
No, I also have something to do
on Saturday night.

165
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,079
Just order me any work.

166
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,959
Your job is to

167
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,959
have dinner with me.

168
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,160
Mr. Lu.

169
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,879
I'm a designer,

170
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,199
not your personal assistant.

171
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,680
If you really need someone
to accompany you to dinner,

172
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,319
you can ask Su Manni.

173
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,600
She should be very happy.

174
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,199
Ms. Su.

175
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,600
Mr. Lu, Mrs. Lu just left.

176
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,600
How was your conversation?

177
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,959
Don't mention it.

178
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,759
Your idea

179
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,040
doesn't work at all.

180
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,919
Mr. Lu, I have a better idea.

181
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:56,420
[Event Notification]

182
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,759
Team building?

183
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,960
Why is the company suddenly organizing
a team building?

184
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,480
No idea.

185
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,360
Aren't you going to the art exhibition
with my brother on Saturday?

186
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,039
You can't make it now.

187
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:20,919
I am here for my express.

188
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,799
Okay.

189
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,200
Jiming.

190
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,679
Feier.

191
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,759
Why are you here?

192
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,519
I came to eat with my brother.

193
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:33,840
What is this?

194
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,480
The company will organize team building
on Saturday.

195
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,279
Mr. Lu prepared a couple outfit for Mrs. Lu.

196
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,120
But

197
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,279
my brother and Su Bei have already broken up.

198
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,000
Why did he prepare a couple outfit for her?

199
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,799
The team building on Saturday

200
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,279
is for Mr. Lu to bring back his wife.

201
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,159
She won't take it

202
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,679
if you give it to her directly.

203
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:54,320
I would say it was the clothes
the company prepared for the team building.

204
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,159
What about this?

205
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,279
Let me give it to her.

206
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,879
I also want to go see her.

207
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,799
All right. Thank you, Feier.
