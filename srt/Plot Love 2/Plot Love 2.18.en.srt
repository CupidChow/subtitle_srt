173
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,080
Mr. Ye, is this your design work?

174
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,350
Yes, an unfinished design.

175
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,150
What's wrong?

176
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,640
Nothing.

177
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,000
It doesn't matter. You can directly tell me

178
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,000
about your idea.

179
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,350
I feel like something is missing here.

180
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,110
So what do you think is missing here?

181
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,880
If it were me,

182
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,670
I would add some Sichuan embroidery elements.

183
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,150
Sichuan embroidery elements?

184
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,230
Yes.

185
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,400
Sorry.

186
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,000
Did I say something wrong?

187
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,550
I shouldn't have pointed fingers
at your work.

188
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,230
Not at all.

189
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,280
I think you are right.

190
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,400
Actually, I thought

191
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,320
there was something missing here.

192
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:53,910
But...

193
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,080
You are talented in costume design.

194
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,110
Thank you.

195
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,200
Su Bei.

196
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,790
To tell you the truth,

197
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,670
I plan to start my own clothing brand.

198
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,520
Are you interested in

199
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,590
being a designer for my new brand?

200
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,670
Thank you for acknowledging me.

201
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,640
But probably not this time.

202
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,470
Because of Huanzhen?

203
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,880
Yes.

204
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,710
Never mind.

205
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,910
I can wait for you.

206
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,710
Think about it again.

207
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,790
You can reply to me

208
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,840
after the contest is over.

209
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,550

210
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,000
thank you for bringing me back today.

211
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,110
