[Plot Love II]

00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,420
[Episode 23]

3
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,200
Manni.

4
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,320
Feier.

5
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,200
Why did you come to the company?

6
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,320
My brother said that the company
would organize a team building,

7
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,359
so he specially asked me to deliver clothes
to my sister-in-law.

8
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,040
It a couple's outfit prepared by my brother.

9
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,760
Why are you still calling her sister-in-law?

10
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:13,400
Didn't Mr. Lu break up with Su Bei?

11
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,519
But

12
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,719
since he has prepared her clothes,

13
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:19,480
he must want to bring her back

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,760
on the team building.

15
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:24,560
Why is Mr. Lu still thinking of her?

16
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,000
How could she be worthy of Mr. Lu?

17
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,840
Exactly.

18
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,159
Actually, I don't understand my brother.

19
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:34,079
You are obviously excellent.

20
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,200
Manni.

21
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,400
I completed my mission.

22
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,560
I am leaving.

23
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:42,560
Okay.

24
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,319
How is your preparation?

25
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,159
All prepared.

26
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,560
Fireworks will be at 9pm.

27
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,200
You can take her to the seaside.

28
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,960
Tell me what you want to eat.

29
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,280
Didn't I ask you

30
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,400
to bring her clothes?

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,039
I did.

32
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,759
Please keep quite.

33
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,919
Next, let's welcome Mr. Lu

34
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:23,960
to say something.

35
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,199
Everyone has been working hard

36
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,240
for the competition recently.

37
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,280
Today the company held a team building

38
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,680
to let everyone relax.

39
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,840
Hope you all

40
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,280
continue to work hard

41
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,639
in the upcoming games.

42
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,039
Cheers.

43
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,639
For all of you.

44
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,240
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

45
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,000
I am sorry

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,759
for being late.

47
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,240
I am in.

48
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,080
What's going on?

49
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:55,039
It's obviously a couple fit.

50
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,759
Cheers to all.

51
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,360
Come on and eat.

52
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,039
This is a speciality.

53
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:11,800
It tastes good.

54
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,439
Well cooked.

55
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,039
Come on.

56
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,680
Mr. Lu.

57
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,280
Thank you for your clothes.

58
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,400
I like it.

59
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,560
Are you okay, Su Bei?

60
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,439
I want some fresh air.

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,639
Mr. Lu, try this.

62
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,680
Mr. Lu.

63
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,560
Mr. Lu, why are you taking off the coat?

64
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,759
I feel hot.

65
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:48,960
Mr. Lu.

66
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,400
Cheers.

67
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,960
The game

68
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,000
is up to you.

69
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,479
Come on.

70
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:00,879
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

71
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,840
Mr. Lu.

72
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,439
Cheers.

73
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,319
I am fine.

74
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,199
Just go back.

75
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,800
I don't want to eat at the same table

76
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,240
with Su Manni.

77
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,480
Besides,

78
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:22,480
how could I leave you here alone?

79
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,000
I am fine.

80
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,800
I am not going back.

81
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,319
I got angry when I saw her.

82
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,040
But Lu Nan went so far.

83
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,879
As soon as he broke up with you,

84
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,839
he immediately wore a couple outfit
with Su Manni.

85
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:42,759
Never mind.

86
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,879
We broke up anyway.

87
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,439
What does it matter to me

88
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,800
who he's with?

89
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,360
Right.

90
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,600
That's right.

91
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,519
But

92
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,720
you don't have to stick to him.

93
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,240
There are many better men than him.

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,040
You will be popular

95
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,000
wherever you go.

96
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,920
Do you have

97
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,920
any latest candidate?

98
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,560
I've been so busy with the contest lately

99
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,240
that I don't have time
to think about anything else.

100
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,120
What about someone

101
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,279
who can help you in the contest?

102
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,160
Stop kidding me.

103
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,920
Okay.

104
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,360
I'll introduce you to a better one.

105
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,120
You?

106
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,240
Thank about yourself first.

107
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,439
It depends on who he is.

108
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,480
For example, my excellent

109
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,720
brother.

110
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,959
Mr. Ye.

111
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,800
I heard you are holding a team building here.

112
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:44,920
So I came to take a look.

113
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,040
I will leave you alone.

114
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,199
I'm going to the bathroom.

115
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,279
Bye.

116
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,120
You don't look happy.

117
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,959
If you don't want to see that person,

118
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,720
I can take you out of here.

119
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:08,839
Never mind.

120
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,680
I just want to be alone for a while.

121
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,920
But if you stay alone for a long time,

122
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,399
you will be trapped in your emotions.

123
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:18,920
I think

124
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,000
you can try to accept others.

125
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,399
I'm not ready to accept other people.

126
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,120
It's tiring

127
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,160
to meet someone else.

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,560
But losing someone is easy.

129
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,399
You haven't let go of Lu Nan.

130
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,079
What does it matter?

131
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,639
Anyway,

132
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,639
he doesn't even know how I feel now.

133
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,519
In fact, nothing in this world

134
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,439
should belong to you.

135
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,560
If you want anything,

136
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,000
you need to strive for it.

137
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,319
Everyone.

138
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,000
You've been working hard recently.

139
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,000
Cheers.

140
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,120
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

141
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:26,240
Mr. Lu, you've drunk enough.

142
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,759
Mr. Lu.

143
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:27,439
Leave me alone.

144
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:39,799
Mr. Lu.

145
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,840
Mr. Lu, you are drunk.

146
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,600
Piss off.

147
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,360
You are drunk...

148
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,120
Piss off.

149
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,120
Su Manni.

150
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Listen.

151
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,720
I feel sick

152
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,919
seeing you now.

153
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,200
If it weren't for you,

154
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,759
Su Bei and I wouldn't be like this.

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,799
Su Bei?

156
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,519
Why do you only care about Su Bei?

157
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,919
My love is worthless

158
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,279
in your eyes, isn't it?

159
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,360
Do you deserve to say liking?

160
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:16,840
What is your liking?

161
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,600
Steal, rob and cheat.

162
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,240
I know what's in your mind.

163
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,960
Wife of Huanzhen's president.

164
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,519
What else can you do

165
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:29,559
besides flirting?

166
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:33,559
Yes.

167
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:36,200
I did steal, rob and cheat.

168
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,919
But you never give me a chance.

169
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,159
What can I do?

170
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,043
What can you do?

171
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,360
I hate people like you the most.

172
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,919
You use excuses to cover up your viciousness

173
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,159
