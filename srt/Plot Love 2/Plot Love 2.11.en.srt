3
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:51,959
Hello, Mr. Ye.

4
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,400
This is Huanzhen's president.

5
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,520
We have made an appointment with you before.

6
00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:58,479
Hello, I'm Lu Nan.

7
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,040
Come in and close the door.

8
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,400
Mr. Ye.

9
00:01:19,839 --> 00:01:21,199
Garment Design Contest is coming soon.

10
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:23,480
We'd like to invite you to

11
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:24,959
guide our company's design department...

12
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,720
I have turned down invitations
from many companies.

13
00:01:27,919 --> 00:01:29,000
Why should I choose you?

14
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,120
Mr. Ye, please take a look at the contract.

15
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,800
I believe you can see our sincerity.

[Employment Contract]

17
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:52,000
The answer is no.

18
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:56,400
If you have any dissatisfaction,

19
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,680
we can make adjustments.

20
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:59,040
I said no.

21
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,599
Also, you'd better get out of the contest
as soon as possible.

22
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:05,760
With the abilities

23
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,800
of your designers,

24
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm afraid you may not even make it
to the finals.

25
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,960
I never help trash.

26
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:13,839
You!

27
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,600
It seems that Mr. Ye has no willingness
to cooperate.

28
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,759
That being the case,

29
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:26,000
we don't have to waste each other's time.

30
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:27,679
You are not the only choice

31
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,479
of Huanzhen.

32
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:31,679
I wish Huanzhen

33
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,759
a smooth pass in the preliminary round.

34
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:35,720
Mr. Lu, please.

35
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,360
It seems that you are being touted too highly
by the domestic media.

36
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,119
Ting.

37
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,240
Just listen to your brother.

38
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,199
He treats you so well.

39
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,279
Let me go.

40
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,279
I can walk myself.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,800
Ting.

42
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,440
Listen.

43
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:57,720
Your brother treats you so well.

44
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:00,600
I've been looking for you for so many days.

45
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,279
If I can't get you back,

46
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:03,440
I'll

47
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,919
be fired.

48
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,080
Su Manni?

49
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,559
Why is she here?

50
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,839
Brother.

51
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,720
Why are you with Su Manni?

52
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,199
It's none of your business.

53
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,559
I booked a flight back to Milan tomorrow.

54
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,199
Go back with me.

55
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:40,919
I am not going back.

56
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,320
Tell me what happened to you two.

57
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,880
Do you know who she is?

58
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:47,039
You went home alone without saying anything.

59
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,080
Now you are asking me questions?

60
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:52,199
Okay.

61
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
I won't take care of you anymore.

62
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,160
Don't worry about my business from now on.

63
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:56,199
Stop!

64
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:09,199
Ting.

65
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,600
I am your brother.

66
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:12,600
I hope you to listen to me.

67
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,880
I'm really worried about you
being outside alone.

68
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,200
Brother.

69
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,000
I've grown up.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,600
I can take care of myself.

71
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,279
I hope to make a career
out of my own abilities.

72
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,239
Isn't your achievement today

73
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,320
achieved by your own efforts?

74
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,160
But do you know

75
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,200
what the price is for these?

76
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:35,320
No matter what the price is,

77
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,200
I have to do what I want to.

78
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,839
Why am I working so hard?

79
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,640
I just want to relieve you of hard work.

80
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,399
But I don't want you to control my life.

81
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,519
This is my own choice.

82
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,000
Even if I fail, I won't regret it.

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,040
You won't regret it?

84
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:56,320
I can tell you with certainty that

85
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,559
you will regret it.

86
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,760
And one day you will know

87
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,359
what the loss outweights the gain means.

88
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:04,920
Brother.

89
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,559
Shouldn't you be the first

90
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,760
to support my dreams?

91
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Why do you always stop me?

92
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:14,119
Because I know you well.

93
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,920
You never know me.

94
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,799
You never think about what I want.

95
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:22,760
What else do you want?

96
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,920
I have given you the best

97
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,160
since you were a child.

98
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:30,600
You are just imposing

99
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,679
what you think is good on me.

100
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:34,480
You were like this before,

101
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:35,760
and so are you now.

102
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:38,799
It is because of your perverted
and selfish desire to control

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,040
that An Ning and I don't want
to stay by your side.

104
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:42,920
What?

105
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,239
Perverted?

106
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,359
Selfish?

107
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,799
Do you still think of me as your brother?

108
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,760
How could you say that to me?

109
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,399
Am I wrong?

110
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,440
You've been denying me since I was a kid.

111
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,600
You think I can't do anything

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,799
without you.

113
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,119
Why do you think so?

114
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,200
Just because I'm your brother.

115
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,880
How could you grow up without me?

116
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,679
What can you do without me?

117
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:16,200
Who can do anything from the start?

118
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,959
Why don't you think about your past?

119
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,880
When you worked in An Ning's factory,

120
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,399
you knew nothing.

121
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,279
Or are you simply unwilling to remember

122
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,600
why her family will never recognize you

123
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,920
as a son-in-law?

124
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,839
Ting.

125
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:39,920
Ting, I...

126
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I have nothing to do

127
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,799
with you any longer.

128
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,720
Ting.

129
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:50,839
Ting.

130
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,000
Mr. Ye.

131
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,760
You just let her go?

132
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,559
When she figures it out,

133
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,559
she will come back by herself.

134
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,720
Grandma.

135
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:05,839
Feier.

136
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,600
Grandma.

137
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:08,399
Grandma.

138
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Here comes Bei.

139
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,959
Grandma, you're finally back.

140
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,679
Brother and sister-in-law have been here
for a long time.

141
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:16,000
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

142
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,320
I should have been back earlier.

143
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,279
I went with Grandma Wang next door

144
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,399
to buy clothes for her grandson.

145
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,359
That store is great.

146
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,679
There are children's clothes and toys.

147
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:33,079
I also bought a few by the way.

148
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,440
Look, Bei.

149
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,839
Look what I bought.

150
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,720
These are for the great-grandson.

151
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,760
These are for the great-granddaughter.

152
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,959
Are they cute?

153
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,519
Bei.

154
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,200
Work hard

155
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,559
with Nan!

156
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:01,320
Have a baby soon.

157
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:05,040
Grandma.

158
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,799
I haven't thought about it yet.

159
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,480
Grandma.

160
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,399
Let's not worry about

161
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
the baby first.

162
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,839
But it's the top priority.

163
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,200
Grandma.

164
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,600
I recently participated in a contest

165
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,200
and may be busy.

166
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,000
Bei.

167
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,320
The Lu family is rich.

168
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:30,200
You don't need to work.

169
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,280
I know.

170
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:33,919
Grandma.

171
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,400
This is my dream.

172
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,119
Dream?

173
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,960
Women should serve
both the husband and the child.

174
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,440
Grandma.

175
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,960
I'm hungry.

176
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:50,559
Let's have dinner.

177
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:52,799
Let me cook for you today.

178
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:53,880
I would cook your favorite

179
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:56,320
sweet and sour fish.

180
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,080
Okay.

181
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,400
I will do Feier a favor.

182
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,880
Grandma.

183
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:09,919
We have our own plans

184
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,200
for baby.

185
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,359
You just

186
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,599
prefer your wife

187
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,840
to your grandma.

188
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,679
How come?

189
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,960
All right, I'll take these clothes away

190
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,320
and put them upstairs, okay?

191
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,599
Feier.

192
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,080
May I help you?

193
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,159
No need, sister.

194
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,840
You are the guest. Just take a rest.

195
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,440
Let me wash vegetables for you.

196
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,000
Just leave it to me.

197
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,760
Why don't you make some drinks?

198
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,799
We have everything here.

199
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:45,880
Okay.

200
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,280
Feier, I've finished.

201
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:03,320
All right, go to accompany grandma.

202
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:05,320
Leave the rest to me.

203
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,640
Hard work for you.

204
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,440
It's obviously

205
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,440
from Feier.

206
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,599
Not at all, grandma.

207
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,239
Sister-in-law also helped me a lot.

208
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:25,640
Good.

209
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,320
Grandma.

210
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,760
This is the kumquat tea specially made
by sister-in-law for you.

211
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:29,559
Take a try.

212
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:35,320
Okay.

213
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,599
Grandma, how is it?

214
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,719
Tastes good.

215
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:45,799
Then take more.

216
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Grandma. Grandma.

217
00:10:58,799 --> 00:10:59,640
Grandma.

218
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,479
Aren't you feeling well?

219
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,000
What's wrong with you?

220
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,200
Grandma.

221
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
What else

222
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,520
is in this tea?

223
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,119
I put kumquats, tea leaves

224
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,440
and honey.

225
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:13,400
Honey?

226
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,080
Sister-in-law, don't you know that
grandma is allergic to honey?

227
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,039
I just reminded you.

228
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:19,280
Grandma.

229
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,000
I don't know.

230
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:23,000
Sister-in-law may not have heard clearly.

231
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,719
I should have reminded her several times.

232
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:26,080
Sorry.

233
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,640
I really don't remember.

234
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,280
Don't worry, there are allergy medicines.

235
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,039
Go get the medicine.

236
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,200
Okay.

237
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,320
Grandma.

238
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:34,719
Easy.

239
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,679
Are you okay?

240
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,599
Grandma.

241
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,119
Here.

242
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,880
Take some water.

243
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,320
Grandma.

244
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,000
Sorry.

245
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,919
I really didn't know you couldn't take honey.

246
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:04,559
Just go back.

247
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,039
I want to rest.

248
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,479
Brother, I'll send sister-in-law first.

249
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,919
Bei, don't worry.

250
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,640
I will take care of grandma.

251
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,565
Grandma.

252
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,621
I am going back.

253
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,228
Feier, you should go back

254
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,978
to take care of grandma.

255
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:41,762
Sister, don't worry.

256
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,000
When grandma is getting better,

257
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:44,159
come visit her.

258
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,599
Thank you, Feier.

259
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,239
I am leaving.

260
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,760
