00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,420
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,919
I didn't expect you to

4
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,839
ask me out for dinner.

5
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:11,239
I just want to find someone to talk to me.

6
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,599
Because of Lu Nan?

7
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,319
In fact, I feel that Lu Nan

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,080
is different from many rich people.

9
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:26,080
He defended you domineeringly

10
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,839
in front of everyone
at the birthday party that day.

11
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,519
We all envied you.

12
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,080
Well.

13
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:40,440
Some things cannot be judged

14
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:43,160
only on the surface.

15
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:45,800
What do you mean?

16
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
In fact,

17
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,279
this is not Lu Nan's fault.

18
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,800
I didn't know grandma couldn't take honey.

19
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,120
I added honey to her tea.

20
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,000
But it's not your fault.

21
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,800
You didn't know it.

22
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,199
But it's more than that.

23
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,679
Grandma wants me to be at home

24
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:18,160
to serve my husband and children.

25
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,199
But I don't want to give up my career.

26
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,039
And it's impossible for me and Lu Nan at all.

27
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:25,919
But

28
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,759
why can't a woman have her own career?

29
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,919
Tell me.

30
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:31,960
Women can only take care of children at home?

31
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,679
You did nothing wrong about this.

32
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:36,039
Why are they asking you that?

33
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:37,080
I am in favor of you.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,720
Why are you more excited than me?

35
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,600
I...

36
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,119
I just can't accept someone

37
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:48,679
planning your life

38
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:51,199
in the name of love.

39
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,919
You mean your brother?

40
00:02:58,119 --> 00:03:01,279
I remember when we first met,

41
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,000
your brother

42
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,119
sent someone

43
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:08,679
to take you back, right?

44
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,279
Yes.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,720
He recently chased me to Nanxi City.

46
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,639
We met

47
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,559
and quarreled.

48
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,119
Cheers.

49
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,360
Cheers to friendship.

50
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:34,880
Su Bei.

51
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,320
You are my first friend in Nanxi City.

52
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,919
I recognize you.

53
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:39,839
Yes.

54
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,679
If anyone dares to bully you in the future,

55
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,839
I will beat him up.

56
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,600
Hey.

57
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,160
What a poor drinker.

58
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:51,960
You just drank a little.

59
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,399
I haven't had enough of it yet.

60
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,000
Lu Nan.

61

[I am at Evermore Bar, come pick me up.]

62
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,199
Why is she so drunk?

63
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,839
She's unhappy.

64
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,800
Unhappy?

65
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,279
By the way, you are...?

66
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,440
I am Ye Ting, Su Bei's friend.

67
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,959
I will leave her to you.

68
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,079
Okay, thanks.

69
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,600
Oops.

70
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:41,000
I just cared about Su Bei

71
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,519
and forgot to mention the interview.

72
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:53,079
Ye Ting.

73
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:57,000
I'll tell you a secret.

74
00:04:58,119 --> 00:04:59,040
Actually,

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,959
I'm not the president's wife.

76
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:08,000
You asked me if I am doing well.

77
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,200
Auntie Lan also asked me if I am doing well.

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,480
He's actually nice to me.

79
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,239
He treats me well.

80
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,399
But...

81
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,480
We are in a contractual relationship.

82
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:30,480
Humm...

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,799
Su Bei.

84
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,079
I'm not being nice to you

85
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:37,760
because of our contractual relationship.

86
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:39,519
You liar!

87
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
I am not lying.

88
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,920
You are!

89
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:47,679
I never break my promise.

90
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,440
I don't believe in you.

91
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,279
Okay.

92
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,519
What do I need to do

93
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,079
for you to believe me?

94
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,239
You...

95
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,079
I feel sick.

96
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,799
Why did you drink so much?

97
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:24,279
It's all because of you.

98
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,640
Because of me?

99
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:27,679
Yes.

100
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:22,279
I...

101
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,480
Why am I here?

102
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,959
I let you go this time.

103
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,040
If you get drunk again,

104
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,040
I'm not sure what will happen.

105
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,640
Feier, here you are.

106
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:57,559
Brother.

107
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,160
I brought you breakfast.

108
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:02,399
Let's go back to see grandma after eating.

109
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,920
Is grandma okay?

110
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,440
Is she feeling well?

111
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,839
What a smell of wine.

112
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,079
Sorry.

113
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,119
I drank too much with my friend yesterday.

114
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,040
Sister-in-law is also here.

115
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,239
Come back with us.

116
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,799
I...

117
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,279
It's okay.

118
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,720
Grandma wasn't feeling well yesterday,

119
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,040
so her attitude was kind of bad.

120
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,640
She must be very happy

121
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,839
when you come back with us today.

122
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,359
Hangover?

123
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,840
Were you sad because of my words?

124
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,479
Drinking alcohol is not good for girls.

125
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:50,599
Why don't you

126
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:52,200
take care of yourself?

127
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:55,159
Grandma.

128
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:57,400
Grandma.

129
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:59,919
Bei rarely drinks.

130
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,719
Yesterday was an exception.

131
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:04,679
Drinking alcohol is a taboo
during preparation for pregnancy.

132
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:07,400
Feier.

133
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,039
Make an appointment with Dr. Li.

134
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,000
Take this opportunity

135
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,719
to prepare Su Bei with a medical examination.

136
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,760
Grandma, you are thinking too much.

137
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:20,239
And I have no plans to have a baby for now.

138
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:21,719
I have been very busy with work these years.

139
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:23,359
Even if I have a baby,

140
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:24,960
I don't have time to take care of him.

141
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:28,080
But I have

142
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,440
plenty of time.

143
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,640
I can't even

144
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,520
get Su Bei checked now?

145
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,559
Grandma.

146
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,520
Okay, grandma.

147
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,640
It's all up to you.

148
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,679
Mr. Lu.

149
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,799
The top three places in the municipal
competition have been announced.

150
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,880
Our company's Chen Shaojie is the third.

151
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,479
The first is Mrs. Lu.

152
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,640
The first?

153
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,919
As expected of my wife.

154
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,280
Book a fine restaurant.

155
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,119
I'm going to celebrate for Bei.

156
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:07,599
Okay.

157
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:09,599
Remember to prepare cake and flowers.

158
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:10,039
Got it.

159
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:19,317
[Congratulations on winning
the first place in the competition.]

160
00:10:19,317 --> 00:10:23,637
[Thanks.]

161
00:10:23,677 --> 00:10:26,557
[I booked a restaurant
to celebrate for you at night.]

162
00:10:26,557 --> 00:10:34,957
[Sorry, I have made an appointment
with someone else at night.]

163
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:39,880
Mr. Lu, what's up?

164
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,440
Find out who is Su Bei going to meet tonight.

165
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:43,440
Gosh.

166
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,359
Mrs. Lu made an appointment
with someone else at night?

167
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,000
Then the cake and flowers I just ordered...

168
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,479
Take them.

169
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:53,919
Cheers.

170
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,039
Congratulations on your first place.

171
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:01,359
It's just a municipal competition.

172
