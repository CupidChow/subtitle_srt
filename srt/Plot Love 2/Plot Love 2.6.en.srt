Doesn't it fit me?

It's not for you.

Take it off.

15
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,830

What are you doing at Huanzhen?

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,790
It's none of your business.

36
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,790
Huanzhen is looking for designers recently.

37
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,990
Are you taking your chance?

38
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,110
Not everyone can be hired by Huanzhen,

39
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,670
especially someone like you.

40
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,950
You better not

What are you doing?

We haven't seen each other
in such a long time,

But I advise you not to come
to Huanzhen to work.

Otherwise,

49
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,750
don't blame me for being rude to you.

50
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,350
It doesn't matter to you
whether I work at Huanzhen or not.

51
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,270
Are you okay?

52
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,630
Fine.

53

Who are you being rude to?

54

Who are you?

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,340
I'm a friend of Su Bei.

56
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,870
You want to work in Huanzhen,
don't you?

57
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,870
You have to understand the situation then.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,310
Don't make friends randomly.

59

61

She went too far.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,190
Stay away from her.
