[Plot Love II]

2
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,420
[Episode 5]

3
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,870
Our store was booked

4
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,150
by Mr. Lu of Huanzhen Group today.

5
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,350
I just came for him.

6
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,830
Why did you come here dressed so casually?

7
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:05,910
You will soon become Mrs. Lu.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,350
We are choosing rings, not getting married.

9
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,190
Besides, I usually get dressed like this.

10
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,510
Choose whatever you want.

11
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,710
Just this one.

12
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,230
Take your time. No worries.

13
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,950
No need, I've made up my mind.

14
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,230
You must have chosen it long ago.

15
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,310
I've seen a lot of women

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,470
like you.

17
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,350
Like what?

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,830
A woman who can do anything for money.

19
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,030
Do you think all women

20
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,390
are greedy for your money?

21
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,830
I am not like them.

22
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,470
I don't care about

23
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,630
the material and size of the ring,

24
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,710
but sincerity.

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,270
But I don't think Mr. Lu has ever felt it.

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,710
Leave us alone.

27
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,390
What are you doing?

28
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,790
Aren't you bold just now?

29
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,030
Why are you afraid?

30
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,390
What are you hiding from?

31
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,390
Isn't it what you want?

32
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,830
What do you mean?

33
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,430
You provoked me again and again.

34
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,110
Isn't that what you want?

35
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,670
Don't forget how you got into my room.

36
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,660
It was just an accident.

37
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,430
Don't mention it all the time.

38
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,070
The Su family owes the Lu family money.

39
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,790
So I will cooperate with you.

40
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,590
But please behave yourself.

41
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,670
Gao Jiming,

42
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,510
check what happened that night

43
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,790
when I was drunk.

44
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,150
Grandma, I'm back.

45
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,070
Grandma.

46
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,590
Grandma.

47
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,510
Feier!

48
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,990
You are getting more beautiful.

49
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,710
Why didn't you tell me in advance

50
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,230
that you were back?

51
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,910
I could ask your brother to pick you up.

52
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,870
No need, grandma.

53
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,390
He is so busy.

54
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,950
Besides,

55
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,790
why didn't you tell me

56
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,990
my brother's engagement in advance?

57
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,430
I was about to tell you,

58
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,430
and you came back yourself.

59
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,190
Grandma,

60
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,550
tell me

61
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,110
which family is sister-in-law from.

62
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,990
Her family

63
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,510
is not a prestigious one.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,750
She's my best friend's child

65
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,070
when I was young.

66
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,750
Grandma,

67
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,070
tell me

68
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,710
what kind of person my sister-in-law is.

69
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,990
She is beautiful

70
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,510
and kind.

71
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,350
Really?

72
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,190
Since grandma likes her so much,

73
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,790
I must find a chance

74
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,950
to meet my future sister-in-law.

75
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,950
Okay.

76
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,590
Mr. Lu, I have investigated it.

77
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,790
That night when you were drunk,

78
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,310
Mrs. Lu accidentally bumped into you

79
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,390
and then got the wrong room card

80
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,230
and walked into the wrong room.

81
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,790
It seems that I misunderstood her.

82
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,510
Wait.

83
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,750
Come back.

84
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,270
What else, Mr. Lu?

85
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,950
Have you ever coaxed a girl?

86
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,670
Is there any girl in Nanxi City

87
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,390
that you need to coax yourself?

88
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,670
It seems that
you don't want this month's salary.

89
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,150
If you were trying to make a girl happy,

90
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,310
what would you do?

91
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,830
To make a girl happy,

92
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,550
I'll buy her flowers.

93
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,190
Flowers?

94
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,790
Isn't it necessary to buy her a bag or a car

95
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,870
to make a girl happy?

96
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,670
Is a bouquet of flowers enough?

97
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,990
It's enough.

98
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,510
Hello, Auntie Lan.

99
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,790
I'm going to the store right now
to get a sample.

100
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,830
Don't worry.

101
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,270
Okay.

102
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,910
Mr. Lu, are you trying to run away?

103
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,270
I think

104
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,150
your method is unreliable.

105
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,430
Mr. Lu, trust me.

106
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,790
No problem.

107
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,910
Just a bouquet of flowers?

108
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,070
Are you sure?

109
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,950
Totally sure.

110
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,670
You should go.

111
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,190
Wait...

112
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,710
Mr. Gao?

113
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,270
Ms. Su, this is the flowers from Mr. Lu.

114
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,990
Why did he send me flowers?

115
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,750
Mr. Lu misunderstood you

116
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,350
about what happened that night.

117
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,390
The first time I met someone
who asked someone else

118
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,990
to help with an apology.

119
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,990
Take the flowers back.

120
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,110
Mr. Lu is so busy with work

121
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,030
that he really has no time to spare,

122
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,510
so he entrusted me to give them to you.

123
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,150
Just take them.

124
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,750
Su Bei.

125
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,790
Is it so hard for you to accept my apology?

126
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,790
Is it so difficult for Mr. Lu
to apologize in person?

127
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,350
I never take back

128
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,590
what I gave to others.

129
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,030
Mr. Lu, make an exception today.

130
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,110
Where are you going?

131
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,630
None of your business.

132
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,590
We agreed

133
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,830
not to interfere in each other's lives.

134
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,630
How long are you going to follow me?

135
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,070
Until you forgive me.

136
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,590
I forgive you.

137
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,470
You should go.

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,550
Why are you still following me?

139
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,670
We're going the same way.

140
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,990
Do you like this dress?

141
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,670
Hello, may I help you?

142
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,910
I would like to ask where this dress is from.

143
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,310
It was sold to me by a lady.

144
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,790
A lady?

145
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,470
Yes.

146
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,910
It is said that it was designed
by a former clothing competition champion.

147
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,670
I liked it, so I took it.

148
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,230
I want to buy it.

149
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,310
Sorry, this dress was pre-ordered.

150
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,990
I can pay more.

151
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,110
Sorry.

152
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,990
We have many other styles in our store.

153
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,350
Please take a look.

154
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,390
No, thanks.

155
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,550
You seem to care much about that dress.

156
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,790
It was designed by my mother
when she was alive.

157
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,470
Maybe

158
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,230
it was sold

159
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,870
by my half-sister.

160
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,190
Half-sister?

161
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,190
Nothing.

162
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,990
I have to go, Mr. Lu.

163
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,950
Su Bei,

164
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,390
there are still some details
in the material supply agreement

165
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,070
with Sanglan Clothing
that need to be confirmed.

166
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,190
Come to my company tomorrow morning.

167
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,830
Don't forget it.

168
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,070
Brother.

169
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,830
Feier.

170
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,230
Why are you back?

171
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,950
