3
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:53,790
Okay.

4
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,040
Whatever.

5
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,680
Where are you going?

6
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,400
Don't forget our agreement.

7
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,230
Only one question.

8
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,630
Is Su Bei your daughter?

9
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,120
Yes.

10
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,910
She's my daughter with my ex-wife.

11
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,720
But...

12
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,480
That's fine.

13
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,870
She's the one I'm marrying.

14
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,120
Gao Jiming.

15
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,120
See them out.

Mr. Lu.

00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,550
Ms. Su.

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,360
Mr. Lu.

19
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,400
You'd better do your job well

20
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,270
and focus on the contest.

21
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,680
Don't think about anything else.

22
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,120
Manni. Manni.

23
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,190
Are we just leaving?

24
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,510
How could such a good marriage

25
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,000
be given to her?

26
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,800
Enough, what's the use of regretting it now?

27
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:41,680
You were the one who forced me

28
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,800
to ask for Su Bei.

29
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,160
What are you talking about?

30
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,360
I did this for your good.

31
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,870
If Su Bei relies on the Lu family,

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,120
what good will it do to you?

33
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,760
Enough.

34
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,600
Lu Nan is mine.

35
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,750
I won't give up easily.

36
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,880
Sorry.

37
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,630
I seem to

38
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,960
have screwed up your birthday party.

39
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,670
I didn't mean to be late.

40
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,520
I was locked in a room.

41
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,880
Someone said you're going to surprise me.

42
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,520
So I...

43
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,390
Sorry, Mr. Lu.

44
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,440
I am leaving.

45
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,910
Here they are. Mr. Lu...

46
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,110
Ms. Su.

47
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:04,910
Could you explain

48
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,830
what happened at Mr. Lu's birthday party

49
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,830
just now?

50
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,240
Ms. Su.

51
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,520
Was the person who was supposed to
marry Mr. Lu

52
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,720
really Ms. Su Manni?

53
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,360
Yes.

54
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,080
Explain it to us.

55
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,720
What is your relationship?

56
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,240
Everyone.

57
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,960
Su Bei

58
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,270
is my fiancee.

59
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,880
Those who bully her

60
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,360
are against me.

61
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,520
Nice.

62
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,190
Excuse me.

63
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,160
Mr. Lu, say something.

64
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,030
Thanks for helping me out.

65
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,750
You are my fiancee.

66
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,440
I have an obligation to protect you.

67
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,720
After all, we signed a contract.

[The chaotic private life
of Huanzhen's president]

69
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,270
A few days ago,

70
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,520
at the birthday banquet of Lu Nan,
the president of Huanzhen,

71
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,240
there was a farce of two women
fighting for one husband.

72
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,320
The private life of president of Huanzhen

73
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,880
has sparked discussions among many netizens.

74
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,160
Grandma, don't listen to their nonsense.

75
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,880
Your brother's marriage

76
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,950
is my idea after all.

77
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,230
Tell me.

78
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,670
Am I so impatient

79
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,550
that matched the wrong couple?

80
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,670
Grandma, it's not your fault.

81
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,640
You don't know how messy their family is.

82
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,390
But if Ms. Su

83
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,880
is really like what her younger sister said,

84
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,640
I think

85
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,640
she is quite smart.

86
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,790
It's not smart,

87
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,390
but sophisticated.

88
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,320
Grandma, don't worry.

89
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,920
I will ask for my brother.

90
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,070
Grandma, calm down.

91
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,160
Mr. Ye, did you come back from Milan

92
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,000
for the Angel's Covenant Costume Contest

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,110
this time?

94
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,760
Would you accept the sponsor's invitation

95
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,070
to be a judge of the competition?

96
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,760
Mr. Ye.

97
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,390
Where is Ting?

98
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,270
She still doesn't want to go home?

99
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,270
No.

100
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,720
She's really spoiled.

101
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,000
Mr. Ye.

102
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,550
Four companies would like to invite you

103
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,720
to participate in the design guidance
of this costume contest.

104
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,110
They have contacted me many times.

105
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,790
Try to reject them.

106
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,920
I don't want to get involved in this contest.

107
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,760
Aren't you satisfied with any of these?

108
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,440
What is the theme of this
municipal proposition contest?

109
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,320
The ocean.

110
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,550
What's your idea?

111
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,920
I have searched for a lot of
information online.

112
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,640
But I don't think

113
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,230
my design

114
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,550
is good enough for the contest.

115
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,790
Are you under

116
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,760
too much pressure?

117
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,200
In fact, many creative ideas

118
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,000
come from inspiration.

119
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,880
No matter how complete the information
on the Internet is,

120
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,830
it is not as good as the experience
of being there.

121
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:13,790
Yes.

122
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,320
Grandma.

123
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,600
About what happened
at Lu Nan's birthday party...

124
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,760
Nan told me everything.

125
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,950
It was Gao Jiming
who came to propose marriage.

126
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,790
He didn't reveal my identity at all.

127
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
You have been away from home for a long time.

128
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,830
If they hadn't come to you,

129
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,790
how could you possibly know about it?

130
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,920
So the truth of the matter

131
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,640
has come to light.

132
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,200
Right.

133
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,070
Thank you for believing in me.

134
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,000
The most important thing for you right now

135
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:56,200
is to develop feelings.

136
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,440
Otherwise,

137
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,600
when could I have a great-grandchild?

138
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,760
Take some water.

139
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,600
I bought two tickets for an art exhibition.

140
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,670
I heard that designers

141
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,350
are most interested in this.

142
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,640
Nan, go with Bei.

143
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,600
I...

144
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,640
Grandma, I've been busy
with a contest recently.

145
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,200
I'm going to Starlight Island this afternoon.

146
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,510
I've bought the ticket.

147
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,390
So I can't make it to the exhibition.

148
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,670
Starlight Island...

149
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,670
It's beautiful there.

150
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,840
But

151
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,670
it's dangerous for you to go alone.

152
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,000
Ask Nan to go with you.

153
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,030
Grandma.

154
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,280
I still have some work to do.

155
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,080
So...

156
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,670
I know

157
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,880
how much work you have.

158
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,030
Don't use work as an excuse.

159
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,440
You have to go together.

160
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,640
Okay, grandma.

161
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,470
- What about...?
- What about...?

162
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,470
- You first.
- You first.

163
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,960
- I will go with you.
- You should go to work.

164
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,670
Don't worry about the contest.

165
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,470
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

166
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,470
The sea in my mind

167
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,400
is quiet.

168
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,710
But today I feel that

169
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,470
the sea

170
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,030
is actually full of passion.

171
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,960
