Her phone is off.

00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm going to talk to the person in charge.

Okay.

What do you want?

11
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,160
I need a favor.

12
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,950
You are so capable.

13
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,120
I can't do you any favor.

14

Look at these first.

15
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,830
You investigated me?

16
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,630
I'm curious about

Quite simple.

I don't want to see you

24
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,320
at the preliminary game.

25
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,320
Do you want me to withdraw?

26
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,800
I didn't say that.

27

The person in charge

43
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,470
said that the competition order
was set in advance

Zheng Xiyue has rich stage experience

47
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,470
and knows the order of priority.

48

She won't come right before the contest.

49

Since she hasn't arrived yet,

50

something must have gone wrong.

51

But even if something went wrong,

I also believe in myself.

66

The original poem expresses
a strong feeling of nostalgia.

108
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,600
The designer used the metaphor
of the star and the moon

109
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,830
and the sequined dress design

110

do you still want to stay in Huanzhen?
