but not least,

I want to thank someone.

00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,560
Thank her

30
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,310
for being in my life.

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,190
Anyone there?

32
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,870
Anyone outside?

33
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,680
Anyone there?

34
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,630
Anyone?

35
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,630
Anyone there?

36
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,630
Who's inside?

37
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,150
Hello.

38
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,520
My door was locked from the outside.

39
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,840
Could you ask the front desk
to open the door for me?

40
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,520
Wait for me.

41
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,680
Thank you.

42
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,280
Su Bei.

43
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,470
Ye Ting.

44
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,310
I want to introduce her to everyone

45
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,430
on this special day.

46
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,630
Let's welcome Ms. Su to come on stage.

47
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,240
Who is this woman?

48
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,310
Where is Su Bei?

49
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,630
Exactly.

50
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,800
Who is she?

51
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,630
Why is she here?

52
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,590
Why are you here?

53
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,870
Didn't Mr. Lu call me here?

54
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,470
Thank you Mr. Lu

55
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,430
for giving me such a good opportunity

56
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,680
to introduce me in front of so many people.

57
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,630
Thank you, Mr. Lu .

58
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,080
Hi everyone, my name is Su Manni.

59
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,390
Su Bei, why are you here?

60
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,190
What's going on?

61
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,870
Who is he engaged to?

62
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,070
Sorry.

63
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,190
It was just a misunderstanding.

64
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,120
This is the Ms. Su I mentioned.

65
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,310
Su Bei.

66
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,630
She is the daughter of an old friend
of the Lu family.

67
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,160
Now

68
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,630
she is my fiancee.

69
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,360
Hello, everyone. This is Su Bei.

70
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,870
No way.

71
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,830
The person who is going to marry Su Bei
is a fat man.

72
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,120
How could it be Lu Nan?

73
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,510
Mr. Lu.

74
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,360
You misunderstood.

75
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,830
I am the daughter of the Su family.

76
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,720
Su Bei is an unfilial daughter
who ran away from home.

77
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,750
Su Bei.

78
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,270
Why did you marry Lu Nan

79
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,240
in my place?

80
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,270
Who took your place?

81
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,560
Would you like me to tell everyone

82
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,310
who you are in our family?

83
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,360
Su Manni.

84
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,480
Don't mess around here.

85
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,160
Leave.

86
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,070
Mr. Lu, you misunderstood.

87
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,040
I am the daughter of the Su family.

88
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,630
Su Manni.

89
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,240
Behave yourself.

90
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,000
There are so many reporters.

91
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,630
Do you want to be famous this way?

92
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,830
Mr. Lu, could you explain
the current situation?

93
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,270
Sorry, everyone.

94
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,070
This is a family affair.
Please keep it secret.

95
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,630
Thank you.

96
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,390
Distinguished guests and reporters,
please leave the venue first.

97
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,240
Thank you.

98
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,630
Excuse me.

99
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,920
Tell me

100
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,430
what's going on.

101
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,510
Grandma, I am the daughter of the Su family.

102
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,870
Su Bei has been away from home
for many years.

103
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,160
She got the news

104
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,240
and wanted to marry Lu Nan.

105
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,120
Grandma, I am telling the truth.

106
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,270
- Grandma.
- Su Bei.

107
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,040
You tell me.

108
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,870
Grandma.

109
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,360
Su Manni

110
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,430
is indeed my half-sister.

111
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,920
Your family affairs

112
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,600
have nothing to do with me.

113
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,240
Nan.

114
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,920
Take care of this as soon as possible.

115
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,120
I will never allow anyone

116
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,360
to slander Lu family's reputation.

117
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,800
The birthday party

118
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,310
was ruined.

119
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,240
Grandma.

120
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,240
Grandma, calm down.

121
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,270
Feier.

122
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,830
Take grandma home.

123
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,560
Grandma.

124
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,630
Nan.

125
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,240
Take care of it.

126
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,600
I am leaving.

127
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,950
Easy.

128
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,270
Look at what you've done.

129
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,920
Grandma is mad at you.

130
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,000
You have been robbing me of everything.

131
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't care about others.

132
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,190
But how could you steal Mr. Lu from me?

133
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,480
How could you lie to him?

134
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,560
Mom.

135
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,390
Manni.

136
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,000
What happened?

137
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,510
Su Bei, why did you
rob your sister's marriage?

138
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,870
Even if you are biological sisters,

139
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,480
you are still blood-related.

140
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,440
Just leave it to me.

141
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,030
I'm sorry for you.

142
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,960
After your mother died,

143
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,440
I didn't take good care of you.

144
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,080
Mr. Lu.

145
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,670
I didn't know it was Su Bei
who came to see you.

146
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,480
It should be Manni.

147
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,240
About this...

148
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,870
Mr. Lu.

149
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,480
When I went to Su family,

150
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
I didn't mention it was you.

151
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,270
You were the one

152
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,910
who insisted on not marrying a stranger.

153
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,600
Now it is you who reversed black and white
and said that you are willing to marry him.

154
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,510
Mr. Su.

155
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,720
Have you forgotten

156
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,870
how you threatened me?

157
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,790
Mr. Su? I am your dad.

158
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,360
Why did you forget that you are my dad

159
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,390
when you threatened me?

160
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,840
Mr. Lu.

161
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,960
How could an unfilial person like Su Bei

162
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,360
be worthy of you?

163
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,600
I am unfilial?

164
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,080
At least I didn't destroy others' family.

165
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,790
What did you say?

166
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,600
You are the least qualified person
to talk here.

167
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,510
You said no at first.

168
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,960
Now

169
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
you are willing to marry him?

170
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,080
Shut up!

171
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,150
