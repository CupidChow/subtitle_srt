00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,159
Su Manni.

4
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,880
Why do you seduce all men?

5
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,680
Who am I seducing?

6
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,000
You tell me.

7
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,520
Don't talk nonsense.

8
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,599
Who did you seduce last time

9
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,560
at the Royal Court Hotel?

10
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,959
Don't you remember?

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,160
Don't talk nonsense.

12
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,919
Su Manni.

13
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,720
I don't care if you seduce other men.

14
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,879
But Lu Nan is your brother-in-law.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Don't you find it disgusting

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,440
to seduce your brother-in-law?

17
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:17,639
You!

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,160
I am not Su Bei.

19
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,959
I'm not as kind as her.

20
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:23,760
Also,

21
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:25,480
listen.

22
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,599
If you dare to bully Su Bei

23
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:29,360
or seduce Lu Nan again,

24
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,080
I will not let you go.

[Fitting room]

26
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,879
Did you do it?

27
00:01:58,919 --> 00:01:59,680
What did you say?

28
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,400
Did you expose my stuff?

29
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:08,759
What's in it for me to do this?

30
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,880
You're jealous that

31
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,199
I got Aisha's endorsement.

32
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,399
Don't you forget what happened

33
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,559
in the preliminary round?

34
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:18,279
I have your number.

35
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,119
Enough.

36
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,399
Think about it.

37
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,039
Since you have my number,

38
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,800
how could I do this?

39
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,720
So who will it be?

40
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,119
Think about it carefully.

41
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,960
You didn't even

42
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,360
go to the last game.

43
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:45,800
Ye Ting said to investigate you thoroughly.

44
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,839
Do you think others

45
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,240
can't find what I found?

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,279
You mean Su Bei wants to get revenge on me?

47
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,240
I am going for her.

48
00:02:57,303 --> 00:02:58,399
Hold on.

49
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,399
If you just went to her like that,

50
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:01,600
would she tell you?

51
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,000
I can't just let it go.

52
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,000
All right.

53
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,679
Calm down.

54
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,880
Think carefully.

55
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:19,440
Su Bei is the wife of Huanzhen's president.

56
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:21,360
Could you afford to offend her?

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,839
Don't worry.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,600
I'll dig it out

59
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,880
for you.

60
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,360
Have you heard of it?

61
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,960
Someone just saw Su Bei and Mr. Lu

62
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,600
break up downstairs.

63
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,679
They broke up?

64
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,679
They were so sweet

65
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,119
and I was so envious.

66
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:50,919
Su Bei.

67
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,240
Now that you've given up your position,

68
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,399
I can't live up to your kindness.

69
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:04,960
Nan has always been

70
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,639
absent-minded during this time.

71
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:09,720
How could he put such an important contract

72
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,800
in the bathroom?

73
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,520
Maybe brother has been very busy
at work recently.

74
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,480
What if the nanny didn't see it

75
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,839
and the contract would be damaged?

76
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,679
Grandma, don't worry.

77
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,119
I will send it to brother tomorrow.

78
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,279
Okay.

79
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,119
Brother.

80
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:31,920
Nan.

81
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,440
Nan, what's up?

82
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,279
Nothing.

83
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,720
Nan.

84
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:38,320
Brother, you drank?

85
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,119
Feier.

86
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,040
Let the nanny make the hangover soup.

87
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,519
Okay.

88
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:42,920
Nan.

89

Nan.

91
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,239
If you have something to say,

92
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,720
don't hold it in your heart,

93
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,079
just tell me.

94
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,839
Grandma.

95
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,200
Go to rest.

96
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:03,119
Leave me alone.

97
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,279
Nan.

98
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,079
What happened to you?

99
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:11,480
I broke up with Bei.

100
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:16,959
I thought

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,320
Huanzhen was the most important thing

102
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,880
to me.

103
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:23,679
But why does

104
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,399
losing Bei

105
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,200
hurt me so much?

106
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,440
Grandma.

107
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,679
Tell me.

108
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,679
Is it rare

109
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,920
to meet someone

110
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,359
with whom you truly love each other?

111
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,079
I met Su Bei.

112
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:47,760
But now

113
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:49,760
I lost her.

114
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,359
Nan.

115
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:52,399
Grandma.

116
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,640
Nan.

117
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,480
Your parents left early.

118
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,760
I watch you grow up little by little.

119
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:10,440
I'm so glad

120
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:13,600
you're finally

121
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,760
in charge of our group.

122
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,959
Grandma.

123
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,640
I am getting old.

124
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,279
I look forward to

125
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:29,079
seeing you

126
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,720
get married

127
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:33,799
and have children

128
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,000
in my lifetime.

129
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,160
So I kept

130
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,399
urging you so much

131
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,239
that I forgot

132
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,320
how you felt.

133
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,799
Nan.

134
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,920
Grandma, don't cry.

135
00:07:58,359 --> 00:07:59,600
Maybe

136
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,839
it's really my fault.

137
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:09,920
Grandma.

138
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,959
Grandma.

139
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:26,480
Feier.

140
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,000
Take good care of your brother.

141
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,159
Okay.

142
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,799
Brother.

143
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:51,679
You are drunk.

144
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,400
Take some hangover soup.

145
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,599
Bei.

146
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,359
Brother.

147
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,440
Don't be sad.

148
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,880
I will always be with you.

149
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,840
You still have me.

150
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,479
Why?

151
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,880
Why did she leave me?

152
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,159
Are you leaving?

153
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,440
Bei.

154
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:41,080
Actually,

155
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:44,440
I'm not insisting that you break up.

156
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,280
I will not interfere in your affairs

157
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,400
from now on.

158
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,559
Grandma.

159
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:52,760
I didn't break up with Lu Nan

160
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,760
because of you.

161
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,760
There are too many problems
between the two of us.

162
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,440
Take your time

163
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,640
to fix the problems.

164
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:02,840
Bei.

165
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,200
Come home with me

166
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,919
to see Nan, will you?

167
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:11,039
Grandma.

168
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,159
I haven't figured out

169
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,359
what's going on between us.

170
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:17,119
Please give me some time.

171
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:23,840
Bei.

172
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:43,559
Nan.

173
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,000
Where are you going without having breakfast?

174
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,880
I have no appetite. You enjoy yourselves.

175
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,080
How can you have the strength

176
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,359
to chase my granddaughter-in-law back
if you don't eat?

177
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:58,440
Grandma?

178
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,400
Who is the granddaughter-in-law you speak of?

179
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:02,679
Who else

180
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,880
besides Su Bei?

181
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,840
I won't interfere

182
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,880
in your affairs with Su Bei any more.

183
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,760
I am getting old.

184
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,440
Your life is up to yourselves.

185
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
Thank you, grandma!

186
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,919
Look at you.

187
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,960
Have breakfast now.

188
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,000
Let's eat together.

189
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:26,320
Come on.

190
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,119
Ye Ting. Your alarm clock.

191
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,919
Su Bei.

192
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:06,159
Why don't we take a leave of absence

193
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,000
from work today?

194
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:10,159
How uncomfortable it is

195
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:11,359
for you to meet Lu Nan.

196
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,400
No way. I still have game design to do.

197
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,880
What an able woman.

198
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,960
So couples

199
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,559
had better not work in one company.

200
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,719
It would be embarrassing

201
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:24,840
if they broke up.

202
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:29,599
I'm going to wash up.

203
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,119
Okay.

204
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,599
Why are you here?

205
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,320
Didn't you say leave me alone?

206
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,760
Why are you still angry after so long?

207
00:12:58,359 --> 00:13:00,039
I brought your favorite tiramisu.

208
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:02,359
I'm not a child anymore.

209
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:03,960
Do you think a cake is enough to coax me?

210
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:07,200
You are always a child in my heart.

211
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:08,719
Then why did you hit me?

212
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,119
It's my fault.

213
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:13,080
I apologize to you.

214
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,880
But why didn't you discuss with me

215
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,440
before signing with Huanzhen?

216
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,239
What if I discussed with you?

217
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,799
You wouldn't agree.

218
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,280
I don't understand.

219
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,520
What's so good about Huanzhen?

220
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:27,679
Mr. Ye.

221
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,080
