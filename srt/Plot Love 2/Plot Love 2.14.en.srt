[Episode 14]

3
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,400
Good morning, Mr. Lu.

4
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:51,840
Good morning.

5
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:53,750
Good morning, Mr. Lu.

6
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,110
Good morning.

7
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,880
Good morning, Mr. Lu.

8
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,560
Good morning.

9
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,520
Mr. Lu greeted me.

10
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,520
Indeed.

11
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,360
Mr. Lu.

12
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,360
The gang last night was caught by the police.

13
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,040
Did they reveal the mastermind behind it?

14
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,230
No.

15
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,510
They insisted it was a drunken riot.

16
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,830
Try to dig it out.

17
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,830
Their target was Su Bei.

18
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,160
I'm afraid she will be in danger
in the future.

19
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:33,310
Okay.

20
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,160
Ye Ting reported to the model department.

21
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,190
Got it.

22
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,590
You are

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,910
a little different today.

24
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,230
Hum.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,800
Am I?

26
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,550
Anything good happened?

27
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,680
Gao Jiming, buy a bunch of roses

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,040
and send it to Su Bei's house.

29
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,080
Well.

30
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,720
And a card,

31
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,830
on which you should write...

32
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,670
Ms. Su.

33
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,830
Flowers from Mr. Lu.

34
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,880
- Who?
- Mr. Lu.

35
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,630
Bei, see you in the evening.

36
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,360
Loving, Mr. Lu.

37
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,750
Lu Nan.

38
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,030
You came to me yourself.

39
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,270
Bei.

40
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,630
Bei.

41
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,470
Why are you so active today?

42
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,160
Why is it you?

43
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,630
Mr. Lu, this is my home.

44
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,600
Where is Su Bei?

45
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,270
You shouldn't ask me

46
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,160
about this.

47
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,470
Su Manni, tell me

48
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,750
where Su Bei is.

49
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,520
Su Bei moved away.

50
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,030
Su Manni, watch your identity.

51
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,830
I am your brother-in-law.

52
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,670
Mr. Lu, don't worry.

53
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,160
I won't tell my sister.

54
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,000
Lu Nan.

55
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,790
I don't believe you don't like me at all.

56
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,950
I don't like you at all.

57
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,600
The person I like
has always been your sister.

58
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,720
What am I inferior to her?

59
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,480
I like you so much.

60
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,600
If the one from the Su family
who's going to marry you was me,

61
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,760
would you like me?

62
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,160
Su Manni.

63
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,200
I like Su Bei

64
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,720
not because she is the daughter
of the Su family.

65
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,350
Su Bei is Su Bei.

66
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,950
I have liked you

67
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,720
since the first day I joined the company.

68
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,830
I really wish you could give me
a second look.

69
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,720
Su Manni...

70
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,720
Lu Nan.

71
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,390
I have worked so hard for so long

72
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,550
just to be closer to you,

73
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,230
even a little bit.

74
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,390
I finally got the chance
to get engaged to you.

75
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,880
It was Su Bei who messed up.

76
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,600
She stole what belonged to me.

77
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,200
Why do you protect her so much?

78
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,670
Su Manni.

79
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,950
You are just Su Bei's sister,

80
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,550
not Su Bei.

81
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,950
I will never like you.

82
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,200
One more thing,

83
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,600
Su Bei is my fiancee.

84
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,350
We are getting along well.

85
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,670
If you dare

86
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,880
to hurt Su Bei,

87
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,160
I will never let you go.

88
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:13,950
Bei.

89
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,830
Where are you?

90
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,950
I'm at the company.

91
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,950
Why is Su Manni at your house?

92
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,200
I have moved out from Su's house.

93
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,790
I am coming for you.

94
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,040
Why are you here?

95
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,110
Bei.

96
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,040
What happened?

97
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,110
I returned the Su family's house.

98
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,790
Why didn't you tell me?

99
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,320
I'm afraid you would worry about me.

100
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,510
Never mind.

101
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,600
I am already looking for a house.

102
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,160
No need.

103
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,550
Live with me.

104
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,350
I just don't want you

105
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,950
to worry about everything.

106
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,790
I can fix it myself.

107
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,160
I know you can solve it.

108
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,720
But you have me.

109
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,200
I don't want to make you work so hard.

110
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,000
And we are a couple-to-be.

111
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,510
There is nothing wrong

112
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,230
with us living together.

113
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:27,880
Besides,

114
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,480
the gangster who attacked you
at the BBQ stall before

115
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,720
has not been found yet.

116
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,150
How could I not worry about

117
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,670
you living alone?

118
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,110
Are you moving or not?

119
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,590
Are you moving or not?

120
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,670
All right.

121
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,670
I will.

122
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,400
I will.

123
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,710
I will.

124
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,590
I still want to kiss you.

125
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,110
Alright, finally finished.

126
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,840
You've worked all day.

127
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,760
Go to bed early.

128
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,280
You, too.

129
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:10,880
Okay.

130
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,080
Good night.

131
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,000
Good night.

132
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,960
Come in.

133
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,910
Bei.

134
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,960
Is everything going on well?

135
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,350
Yes.

136
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,910
Well.

137
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,640
Go to bed early.

138
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,110
Okay, good night.

139
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,200
I am going back.

140
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:16,880
Okay.

141
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:48,960
Bei.

142
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,470
Have some water.

143
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,400
If you're thirsty, you don't have
to go downstairs.

144
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,880
Thank you.

145
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,520
Go to bed early.

146
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:06,670
Well...

147
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,790
Good night.

148
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,440
Okay.

149
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:19,880
Bei.

150
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,590
I got you a new pillow.

151
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,230
Yours may not be comfortable.

152
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,880
They are comfortable.

153
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,760
Really?

154
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,150
Yes.

155
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,230
Let me try.

156
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,230
Lu Nan, what are you doing?

157
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
It's really comfortable.

158
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,280
Get off.

159
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,960
Go ahead.

160
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,030
I am listening.

161
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,880
Is the restaurant booked?

162
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,000
