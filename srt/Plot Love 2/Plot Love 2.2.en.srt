[Episode 2]

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,279
Stop talking nonsense.

4
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,039
You can't even explain such a simple thing.

5
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,519
We didn't come to discuss with you.

6
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,679
Your father has made an agreement with them.

7
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,959
You have no choice

8
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,599
but to get married.

9
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,679
What does your agreement
have anything to do with me?

10
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,079
If your dad agrees, it means you agree.

11
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,879
Besides, that man is rich.

12
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,079
What else do you want?

13
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,439
Did you agree?

14
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,279
Today is my mom's deathday.

15
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,759
Please leave with your family.

16
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,119
Our family?

17
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,959
You are also a member

18
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,279
of Su family.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,799
Bei.

20
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,799
To tell you the truth,

21
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,399
something went wrong with the company.

22
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,039
A big boss came to me

23
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,679
and said he could help me solve the problem.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,799
The requirement is

25
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,359
that you marry him.

26
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,199
Don't think highly of yourself.

27
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,239
It's your luck to marry him.

28
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,479
Bei.

29
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,839
Just do me a favor.

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,439
Take your flowers and leave.

31
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,559
Don't bother me and my mom anymore.

32
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,239
Watch your attitude!

33
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,359
Su Yuntian is your father after all.

34
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,359
How could you talk to him like this?

35
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,279
Forget it.

36
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,719
Today is your mom's deathday.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,079
Let's not talk about this.

38
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,759
Bei, think about it carefully.

39
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,119
I'll come back to you another day.

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,639
Let's go.

41
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,399
Let's go.

42
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,319
Let's go.

43
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,559
Okay, you should go first.

44
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,519
What else do you want?

45
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,879
You'd better marry him.

46
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,199
It's none of your business.

47
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,679
I know.

48
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,759
My sister.

49
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,919
Are you working in the broken factory

50
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,359
Sanglan Clothing now?

51
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,239
With your current conditions,

52
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,319
if you reject the man
your dad introduced to you,

53
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,919
do you still expect to find a better one?

54
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,999
Just marry him.

55
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,079
By the way,

56
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,599
I am now working in Huanzhen.

57
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,599
Do you know?

58
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,759
You will never get into a company like that

59
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,999
in your life.

60
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,479
What does this have anything to do with me?

61
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,799
You are my sister after all.

62
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,079
I hope you can be happy.

63
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,599
I mean it.

64
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,999
Hello, Su Bei.
Something happened to the factory.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,799
Come back soon.

66
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,399
What?

67
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,879
What's wrong with the quality

68
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,799
of the fabric you produce?

69
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,519
We can't use it at all.

70
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,799
Today, if you don't pay compensation,

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,679
we will demolish your factory.

72
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,399
Right?

73
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,599
Pay compensation!

74
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,199
Calm down and listen to me.

75
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,119
Pay compensation!

76
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,039
Stop talking nonsense.

77
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,719
It doesn't work.

78
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,519
Who are you?

79
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,879
Who are you?

80
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,279
Hey, who are you?

81
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,279
It's none of your business.

82
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,559
Bei, why are you here?

83
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,839
Someone from the factory just called

84
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,119
and told me that something went wrong.

85
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,639
What's going on?

86
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,119
They said there was something wrong
with our batch of fabric.

87
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,279
How dare you give us

88
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,399
this junk?

89
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,159
Do you know who we are?

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,159
We are

91
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,958
from Huanzhen.

92
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,799
Have you heard of Lu Nan?

93
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,039
In Nanxi City,

94
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,519
he could easily

95
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,919
make you suffer.

96
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,839
Who do you want to make suffer?

97
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,759
It's him.

98
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,919
Who asked you to make trouble outside

99
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,279
in the name of Huanzhen?

100
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,999
Mr. Lu...

101
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,959
Huanzhen issued a notice that

102
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,559
it is strictly forbidden to exploit suppliers
in the name of Huanzhen.

103
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,319
You are no longer

104
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,679
a partner of Huanzhen from today.

105
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,319
Huanzhen will directly sign a contract
with Sanglan Clothing.

106
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,439
Wait, Mr. Lu...

107
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,399
Leave.

108
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,159
Let's go.

109
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,519
I'll have my assistant contact you later.

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,319
Let's set a contract date.

111
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,759
I am very optimistic about the future development
of Sanglan Clothing.

112
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,239
Don't let me down.

113
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,719
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

114
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,559
We will never let you down.

115
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,839
I will let my apprentice Su Bei

116
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,919
directly connect with Huanzhen.

117
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,839
She is your apprentice?

118
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,599
Yes.

119
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,119
You know each other?

120
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,839
Auntie Lan, wait for me.

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,039
Please don't tell Auntie Lan

122
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,919
about what happened before.

123
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,879
Don't you work for Mr. Liu?

124
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,159
I didn't expect you to be quite busy.

125
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,639
Who's Mr. Liu?

126
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,199
I don't care who you work for.

127
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,359
Huanzhen

128
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,119
only cooperates with powerful companies.

129
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,319
I advise you

130
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,959
to give up on other ideas.

131
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,119
Bei.

132
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,239
What's going on?

133
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,559
Nothing, Auntie Lan.

134
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,879
I'll connect with Huanzhen.

135
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,439
Don't worry.

136
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,599
No hurry for work.

137
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,959
Today is your mother's deathday.

138
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,719
Have you seen her?

139
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,239
It's okay, kid.

140
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,839
I am with you.

141
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,359
Thank you, Auntie Lan.

142
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,439
You are back.

143
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,559
They urged again.

144
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,359
If we don't repay,

145
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,679
the company will be seized.

146
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,759
You have my spirits dampened.

147
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,999
It's no use complaining to us.

148
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,119
Go convince your daughter.

149
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,559
Mom, why did that big boss

150
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,639
have to marry the daughter of our Su family?

151
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,039
Who knows?

152
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,799
Maybe he has some hidden illness,

153
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,919
so no one will choose him.

154
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,439
It just so happened that
your dad's company was in trouble,

155
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,439
and he chose the Su family.

156
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,039
Besides, he doesn't even dare
to show his face,

157
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,319
maybe because he's ugly.

158
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,639
Dad, I don't want to marry him!
