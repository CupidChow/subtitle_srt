[Episode 20]

3
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:53,279
Your company's model Zheng Xiyue

4
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:55,159
is involved in others' marriage.

5
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:56,319
This incident

6
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,279
had a huge negative impact

7
00:00:57,279 --> 00:00:58,360
on Aisha.

8
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:01,959
This is indeed

9
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,520
a fault of Huanzhen.

10
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,519
We will assume all responsibilities

11
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,080
and pay the liquidated damages payable

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,160
in accordance with the contract.

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,680
Compensation for liquidated damages

14
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:12,639
can't make up for our losses.

15
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,639
I heard that your company's Su Manni

16
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,639
is also very popular now.

17
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:19,440
We want to

18
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:20,919
change the spokesperson.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,480
Su Manni's image and temperament

20
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,800
are more in line with
Aisha's brand positioning.

21
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,879
Mr. Lu, what do you think?

22
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,760
No problem.

23
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:34,040
I'll have the company's legal team

24
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:35,279
draw up a new contract right now.

25
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,680
Gao Jiming.

26
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes.

27
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,680
Go inform the model department that

28
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,720
Zheng Xiyue will terminate
the contract with Aisha,

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,639
Su Manni will become the new spokesperson

30
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,839
and continue to cooperate with Aisha.

31
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:48,680
Okay.

32
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:53,760
Happy cooperation.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,800
Happy cooperation.

34
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,559
Su Bei, wait for me.

35
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,639
Why are you in such a hurry?

36
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,000
Don't you know that something serious
happened to the company?

37
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:08,080
What happened?

38
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,520
Zheng Xiyue's affair as a mistress
was exposed.

39
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,039
She may be blocked by the whole network.

40
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,880
But she has Elsa's endorsement.

41
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,759
What?

42
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:21,039
What's up?

43
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,039
Mr. Lu.

44
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,080
I knew about what happened
to the Aisha brand.

45
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,919
Complete follow-up work as soon as possible.

46
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,520
I'm really happy

47
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,320
to be able to help Mr. Lu.

48
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,440
Mr. Lu.

49
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,839
Here is the new clothing from Aisha.

50
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,600
The ad shoot is coming soon.

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,440
Our models need to try on all clothes

52
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,320
and replace those that don't fit
as soon as possible.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,479
Okay.

54
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:52,360
Besides,

55
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:53,919
the Legal Department
has drawn up the contract

56
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,000
and needs your approval.

57
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:57,679
Let's go.

58
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,399
Okay.

59
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,160
Are you Zheng Xiyue?

60
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,240
It's me.

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,399
Zheng Xiyue, you vixen

62
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,520
seduced my husband.

63
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,320
You are so shameless.

64
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,440
You can't do anything but seduce men.

65
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:35,839
So disgusting.

66
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:36,839
Look at you.

67
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:38,320
As a model, you become a mistress.

68
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,559
You will come to a bad end.

69
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,600
One more time.

70
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,039
Why are you talking so much to her?

71
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,160
If I hadn't seen it online,

72
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,080
I wouldn't have known that my husband

73
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,759
had an affair with you.

74
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:48,919
Aren't you a model?

75
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,479
Don't you care about your public image
the most?

76
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,800
How could you seduce my husband?

77
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,639
You are so shameless!

78
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,919
You hit me?

79
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,240
You vixen!

80
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,759
Stop it.

81
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,960
Stop it. Let's talk.

82
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,520
It's none of your business.

83
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:06,360
I will tear the mouth

84
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,320
of this vixen today.

85
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,639
Stop it. Let's talk.

86
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,199
Stop it.

87
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:13,880
Listen.

88
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:15,800
I won't let you go.

89
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,959
Not sure what she wants from that man.

90
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,600
Why making it hard for herself?

91
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,119
This man is married,

92
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:28,320
but he still has an affair.

93
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,480
This kind of half-hearted man

94
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,200
is really scary.

95
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,279
Su Bei...

96
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:39,679
Nothing.

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,079
I am going for Lu Nan.

98
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:52,600
Su Manni.

99
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,519
Why did you get changed in my office?

100
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:56,920
Mr. Lu.

101
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,440
Could you do me a favor?

102
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:00,640
Do it yourself.

103
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:02,279
I can't make it.

104
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,600
Think of a way yourself.

105
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:04,920
Mr. Lu.

106
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,000
I can't go out dressed like this

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,640
and have someone else zip it up for me.

108
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,119
That's your own business.

109
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,079
The Aisha Brand

110
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,640
is in a hurry to shoot.

111
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,799
They have already expressed dissatisfaction

112
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:17,600
with Zheng Xiyue.

113
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,279
Su Manni.

114
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,760
You'd better not hold other bad thoughts

115
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,760
in the name of work.

116
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:51,640
Mr. Lu.

117
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,519
Do I look good in it?

118
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,799
Fortunately, you help me.

119
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,000
Su Bei, why are you standing at the door?

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,799
Why don't you go in?

121
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,200
Su Bei.

122
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,559
Su Bei.

123
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:18,839
Su Bei.

124
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,359
Su Bei, let me explain.

125
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,440
Why were you with Su Manni?

126
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,880
What were you two doing?

127
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,679
Aisha's spokesperson was replaced
by Su Manni.

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,320
She was just trying on clothes.

129
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,799
In your office?

130
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,320
I went to check the contract.

131
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,160
When I came back,

132
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,239
I found her get changed in my office.

133
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,880
But I clearly saw

134
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,239
the two of you together.

135
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,640
I just zipped for her.

136
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,839
It's true.

137
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,480
You know Su Manni likes you.

138
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,359
Why can't you stay away from her?

139
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:51,200
You know that I like you.

140
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,279
Why are you so close

141
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,559
to Ye Haochen?

142
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,160
Nothing happened between us.

143
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,679
But you and Su Manni not.

144
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,920
Why are all men

145
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,040
so half-hearted?

146
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,839
In your eyes,

147
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,040
I am such kind of person?

148
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,640
Is that what you think of me?

149
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,399
Don't you think of me the same way?

150
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,160
I...

151
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,040
Why are we together

152
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,320
since we don't even have

153
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,600
the basic trust in each other?

154
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:18,640
There are more obstacles
between us than this.

155
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,320
We'd better break up.

156
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,480
I am tired, Lu Nan.

157
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,959
There are too many problems between us.

158
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,359
That being the case,

159
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:34,079
let's end our relationship

160
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,119
that are not supported

161
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:36,399
by everyone.

162
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:37,000
