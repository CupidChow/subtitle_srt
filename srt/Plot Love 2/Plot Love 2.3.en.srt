Why are you here?

You didn't answer my call.

Have you ever cared about my feelings?

I will never agree with you.

You are still studying Perfume Brocade.

23
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,630
Perfume Brocade is an ancient craft

handed down by generations

25
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,150

The reason why I agreed

Manni, I am leaving.

173
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,350
Have you heard it?

174
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,790
The first place in the company's
internal model selection

175
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,590
can not only represent Huanzhen
in the competition,

176
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,190
but also participate in Mr. Lu's
birthday banquet.

177
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,270
So good?

178
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,190
Of course.

179
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,150
Don't forget that

180
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,630
the resources and exposure obtained
by the competition held by LU

181
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,590
are not comparable to ordinary
small competitions.

182
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,190
No wonder Mr. Lu pays so much attention.

183
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,550
Looks like we're going to get well-prepared.

184
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,470
What is she so proud of?

185
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,750
She will suffer soon.

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,590
A total of 20 models will participate

187
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,710
in the company's internal selection.

188
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,630
This is the list.

189
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,590
Please take a look, Mr. Lu.

190
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,030
No problem.

191
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,630
Also, this is the invitation list
for your birthday party.

192
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,370
Okay.

193
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,470
Is there anything to add?

194
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,790
Just arrange it as grandma wants.

195
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,630
Okay.

196
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,890
Are you okay?

197
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,320
Thank Mr. Lu for your concern.

198
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,870
Could you help me up?

199
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,220
No.

200
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,950
Ms. Su, let me help you up.

201
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,730
Mr. Lu.

202
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,000
My stockings are torn, what should I do?

203
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,230
The selection is about to begin.

204
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,420
Go get her another one.

205
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:39,810
Okay.

206
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,400
I am on it.

207
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,320
Thank you, Mr. Lu.
