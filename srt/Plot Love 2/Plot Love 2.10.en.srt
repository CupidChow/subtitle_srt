[Episode 10]

3
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,790
Open your mouth.

4
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,080
Open your mouth.

5
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,680
Let me help you.

6
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,910
I wanted to ask you for help.

7
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,190
But I didn't expect that... Forget it.

8
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,590
Say it.

9
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,480
It's okay. Let's talk
when everything's settled.

10
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,270
But are you really going to leave like this?

11
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,630
It's way too easy for her.

12
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,830
It's okay.

13
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:44,760
Anyway, I don't want to

14
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,270
have anything to do
with the Su family anymore.

15
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,800
Let me know

16
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,680
if you need help.

17
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,950
Thank you.

18
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,080
You are welcome.

19
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,510
But where are you going to live?

20
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,590
Why don't you live in my house?

21
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,080
I live alone anyway.

22
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,680
It's okay. I have a place to live.

23
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,680
Well.

24
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,680
You are the president's wife.

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,120
Of course you have a place to stay.

26
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,470
Hey, cheer up.

27
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,030
There's no problem

28
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,630
that a barbecue can't solve.

29
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,030
If there is,

30
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,240
you need one more hotpot.

31
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,440
Let's go.

32
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,240
Let's go.

33
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,880
Bei.

34
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,670
Why haven't you gone back so late?

35
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,720
Auntie Lan.

36
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,270
What...

37
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,360
What's wrong?

38
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,800
What happened?

39
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,320
It's okay.

40
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,320
Is Su Manni

41
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,360
causing you trouble again?

42
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,440
So poor of you.

43
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,880
Su Yuntian

44
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,160
is such a coward.

45
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,600
How could he just let Su Manni bully you?

46
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,360
I am going for him.

47
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,110
Auntie Lan.

48
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,670
Don't go.

49
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,030
I have already

50
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,600
cut ties with Su Yuntian.

51
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,750
You know what happened

52
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
between me and Lu Nan, right?

53
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,440
Everyone knows what happened

54
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,000
at Mr. Lu's birthday party.

55
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,030
What happened indeed?

56
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,190
Su Yuntian's company was in trouble.

57
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,630
A boss offered help,

58
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,270
but one of the conditions

59
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,190
was to marry the daughter of the Su family.

60
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,630
Su Manni was reluctant to marry him.

61
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,720
So Su Yuntian came to me.

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And you said yes?

63
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,160
Yes.

64
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,470
So

65
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,110
that half of Perfume Brocade

66
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,510
is Su Yuntian's chip?

67
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,640
You silly girl.

68
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,230
Why do you hold everything

69
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,480
without telling me?

70
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,480
Even if I can't study Perfume Brocade,

71
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,720
I can't bet on your happiness.

72
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,600
Auntie Lan.

73
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,880
I am doing well.

74
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,920
Does Mr. Lu treat you well?

75
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,480
Yes.

76
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,270
Tell me the truth.

77
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,270
It is the truth.

78
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,390
Really?

79
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,920
Then why does he let you live here?

80
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,920
I just don't want him to know.

81
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,920
Go to my house.

82
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,110
I will help you.

83
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,000
Auntie Lan.

84
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,760
No need.

85
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,830
I will find a place to live
as soon as possible.

86
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,440
There's nothing I can do with you.

87
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,830
Auntie Lan.

88
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,440
Mr. Lu.

89
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,160
Mr. Lu.

90
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,760
Mr. Lu.

91
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,440
You are so out of mind

92
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,200
just after coming back from a two-day trip
to the island.

93
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,350
The African division

94
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,480
still lacks a tree planter.

95
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,880
[Ye Haochen,
Well-known Designer in the Industry]

96
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,160
I have made an appointment with Ye Haochen.

97
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,200
Three in the afternoon
the day after tomorrow.

98
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,920
Good job.

99
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,440
I heard that Ye Haochen has
always been difficult to deal with.

100
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,110
You may need to go in person.

101
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,760
In order to show sincerity,

102
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,920
this is what I should do.

103
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:11,950
Okay.

104
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,480
What else?

105
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,440
Who have you decided

106
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,880
to entrust the endorsement
of the Aisha Brand?

107
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,320
Su Manni has strong business ability

108
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,350
and has been published on the inner pages
of Aisha Brand magazines before.

109
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,390
They spoke well of her.

110
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,160
Zheng Xiyue's performance
has been very stable,

111
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,720
and she has also taken many cover photos
of fashion magazines before.

112
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
She's free recently.

113
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,830
Give Zheng Xiyue the endorsement this time.

114
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,790
Su Manni is about to participate
in the costume design contest.

115
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,350
Okay.

116
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,510
I heard that the Aisha Brand
is cooperating with our company.

117
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,000
Is it because of this

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,480
that Mr. Gao just called Xiyue?

119
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,480
Xiyue has been with the company for so long

120
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,350
and is the most famous model here.

121
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,950
Such a good Aisha Brand endorsement

122
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,350
is probably for her.

123
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,440
It must be hers.

124
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,720
Xiyue,

125
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,320
did Mr. Gao just ask you
to discuss the cooperation with Aisha Brand?

126
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,390
Nothing.

127
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,600
Mr. Gao just informed me

128
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,440
to go there in a few days to pick clothes

129
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,440
for taking magazine cover photos.

130
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,350
Xiyue, Aisha is known for being picky.

131
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,200
Congratulations.

132
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,270
Xiyue,

133
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,670
except for you,

134
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,550
Aisha can't choose anyone else
in our company.

135
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,390
Is there anything worth showing off?

136
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,000
Not at all.

137
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,640
But you...

138
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,600
Isn't your sister the president's wife?

139
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,390
Why is this good resource

140
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,830
not yours?

141
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,270
I rely on my own strength.

142
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,790
I don't need her.

143
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,480
Are you sure?

144
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,230
A model with little resources like you

145
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,920
better flatter your sister.

146
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,670
Once she speaks for you in front of Mr. Lu,

147
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,070
you will get everything you want.

148
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,390
Zheng Xiyue.

149
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,440
Don't go too far.

150
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,320
I am going far?

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,710
Su Manni.

152
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,280
I am your senior.

153
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,670
How could you talk to me like that?

154
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,320
Just because of

155
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,080
your dirty tricks in front of Mr. Lu?

156
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,840
Say that again.

157
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,590
You are right.

158
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,440
My sister is the wife
of Huanzhen's president.

159
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,030
Lu Nan is indeed my brother-in-law.

160
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,280
So what?

161
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,470
Are you provoking me

162
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
to bully me

163
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,110
or to bully Mr. Lu?

164
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,110
What if you are my senior?

165
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,840
Listen carefully.

166
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,840
Show your ability

167
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,400
on the stage.

168
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,520
Let's see

169
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,400
who will be the final winner.

170
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,080
Xiyue, are you okay?

171
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,670
She went too far!

172
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,670
Exactly.

173
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,000
Su Bei, why is it all yours?

174
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,070
[Ye Haochen,
Well-known Designer in the Industry]

175
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,640
What's up?

176
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,710
Hello, Mr. Ye.

177
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,590
I am Su Manni...

178
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,470
I don't care who you are.

179
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,960
My time is precious.

180
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,550
I heard that

181
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,670
Huanzhen is interested in
cooperating with you.

182
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,520
So you work for Huanzhen?

183
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,200
You should know about

184
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,470
the Angel Covenant Costume Contest.

185
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,760
I would like to ask for your help.

186
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,280
I want to be the champion.

187
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,400
I believe that

188
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,670
the designer under your lead
will definitely win the championship.

189
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,760
Also, I believe that you would
own a right of speech

190
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,960
after entering Huanzhen.

191
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,200
I want more resources of Huanzhen.

192
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,760
You are very ambitious.

193
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,520
But why should I help you?

194
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,470
Have you checked

195
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,280
how much my design manuscript
can be sold for?

196
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,110
Do you think I am short of money?

197
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,840
So what do you want?

198
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,470
What do you think?

199
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,710
No idea.

200
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,670
Do you have to show sincerity

201
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,280
when you ask for help?

202
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:29,880
Mr. Lu.

203
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,840
I heard that Ye Haochen rejected
three companies one after another.

204
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,230
Do you think we'll be the fourth?

205
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,440
I'm just wondering

206
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,960
if he's coming to Nanxi City
for another reason.

207
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,880
He may not try to get involved
in the costume design contest

208
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,790
as the media speculated.

209
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,280
Whatever his reason is,

210
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,110
we have to strive for this opportunity.

211
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,840
Just go. I'm not interested in you.

212
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,110
And I'm afraid I can't do you a favor.

213
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,960
Mr. Ye, I didn't mean that.

214
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,110
Why don't you

215
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
communicate with Mr. Lu in person?

216
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,640
Mr. Lu?

217
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,150
What are you afraid of?

218
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,320
Wait, Mr. Ye.

219
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,230
Don't let Mr. Lu know I've been here.

220
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,440
Please.
