[Episode 13]

3
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,550
Why are you here?

4
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,190
I'm here to celebrate for you.

5
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,950
I ordered a fancy restaurant for you,

6
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,440
but you didn't come.

7
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,160
So I could only come to you.

8
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,360
What's wrong with here?

9
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,720
Besides, I made an appointment
with Ye Ting first.

10
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,630
It's so embarrassing.

11
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,550
What did you say?

12
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,470
Let him stop.

13
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,670
Let him stop.

14
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,320
Mr. Lu, do you still remember me?

15
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,750
My name is Ye Ting.

16
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,630
Yes, Su Bei's friend.

17
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,670
I have something to ask of you.

18
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,670
Don't worry, I'll leave
right after finishing.

19
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,190
I promise not to disturb your solitude.

20
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,720
Say it.

21
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,550
Well.

22
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,440
I need you a favor.

23
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,390
Please recommend me

24
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,750
to Huanzhen for an interview.

25
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,320
I want to be a model of Huanzhen.

26
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,520
She went to Huanzhen for an interview before.

27
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,720
But it was delayed to help me.

28
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,600
Well.

29
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,030
No problem.

30
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,360
Gao Jiming.

31
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,830
Make some arrangements.

32
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,080
Okay.

33
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,520
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

34
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,440
I am leaving.

35
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,160
Have a nice meal.

36
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,960
Ye Ting. Ye Ting.

37
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,750
Celebrate?

38
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,470
Do it clean.

39
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,030
Don't let anyone find it out.

40
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,320
Su Bei, I will make you suffer.

41
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,440
How much do you remember

42
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,880
from last night?

43
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,750
Nothing.

44
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,550
Nothing?

45
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,000
Yes.

46
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,070
Forget it then.

47
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,720
I'm here today

48
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,480
to tell you another thing.

49
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,480
What?

50
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,600
I hope you can join Huanzhen.

51
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,270
Huanzhen has always been interested

52
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,480
in recruiting outstanding designers.

53
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,160
You won the first place

54
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,350
in the competition this time.

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,600
There should be many companies
being optimistic about you.

56
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,390
So I hope you can join us.

57
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,880
Meanwhile, Huanzhen can also provide you

58
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,670
with a broader and better platform.

59
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,000
Auntie Lan has been taking care of me

60
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,230
for so many years.

61
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,640
I don't want to leave her yet.

62
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,070
Let me think about it.

63
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,160
It's okay. No worries.

64
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,390
Take your time.

65
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,270
Okay.

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,200
Here you are.

67
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,070
Keep an eye on them.

68
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,110
Who are you?

69
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,670
Are you Su Bei?

70
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,000
Who are you?

71
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,950
None of your business!

72
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,320
You are done!

73
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,160
Come on.

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,830
They are heading there.

75
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,390
Don't let her run away.

76
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,950
Follow me.

77
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,760
Does it hurt?

78
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,550
No.

79
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,440
Okay.

80
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,950
That's fine.

81
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,510
Just a minor injury.

82
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,920
I am glad that you are fine.

83
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,920
Those people were targeting you.

84
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,760
Stay at my house for a few days.

85
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,320
This...

86
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,040
Is this what you ordered?

87
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,670
No, I didn't.

88
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,160
You don't need

89
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,720
to thank me like that.

90
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,510
No, how could I...?

91
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,200
So this is your style.

92
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,070
No.

93
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,230
Anyone there?

94
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,320
Hello?

95
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,110
Open the door.

96
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,350
Hello?

97
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,160
I...

98
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,920
What to do?

99
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,920
