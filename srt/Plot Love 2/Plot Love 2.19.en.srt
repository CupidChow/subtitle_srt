[Episode 19]

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,720
Mr. Ye,

4
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:56,159
thank you for bringing me back today.

5
00:00:56,279 --> 00:00:57,360
You are welcome.

6
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,680
Why are you together?

7
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,639
Lu Nan.

8
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,119
This is Mr. Ye Haochen,

9
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,520
a designer I admire very much.

10
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,279
Why are you together?

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,800
What's wrong?

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,879
You'd better stay away from him.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,680
Mr. Lu,

14
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,480
you can't be prejudiced against me

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,080
just because of

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,440
our conflicts in business.

17
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,639
I admire Su Bei's design talent

18
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:20,360
and intend to invite her

19
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,919
to be the designer of my brand.

20
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,760
Su Bei is my fiancee.

21
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:25,919
Don't even think about being with her.

22
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:30,959
I didn't expect that Mr. Lu's desire
for control is so strong

23
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,040
that you would interfere with

24
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,400
your fiancee's normal
interpersonal relationships.

25
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,080
Mr. Ye.

26
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,360
Please go back first.

27
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:43,800
Sorry.

28
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:44,160
Okay.

29
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:45,919
I'll come back to you another day.

30
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,519
Sure.

31
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,480
Su Bei.

32
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,760
Did you say to calm down for a while

33
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,040
because of grandma's objection

34
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,959
or because of him?

35
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,440
Lu Nan.

36
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,639
What are you talking about?

37
00:01:58,639 --> 00:02:00,160
I just met Mr. Ye today.

38
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,279
It'd better be.

39
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,879
What do you mean?

40
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,279
I mean

41
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,959
stay away from messy people.

42
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,680
Messy people?

43
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,039
Do you mean that

44
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,520
I need your permission to be friends

45
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,880
with anyone in the future?

46
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,880
You know that's not what I meant.

47
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Go home and rest.

48
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm going to visit grandma.

49
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:37,240
Nan is back.

50
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,559
Nan.

51
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:40,720
Grandma.

52
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,320
Are you feeling better?

53
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:43,800
Much better.

54
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,520
What's wrong with you?

55
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,880
You don't look well.

56
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:48,839
Nothing.

57
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,479
I'm not going back today.

58
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,119
I will stay with you.

59
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,080
Good.

60
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:53,639
Well.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,119
I'll introduce someone to you.

62
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,039
Come here.

63
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,000
Here.

64
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:00,960
Look.

65
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:04,240
Let me introduce.

66
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,919
This is Lin Xiang,

67
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:09,080
the daughter of Lin's Real Estate.

68
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,320
This is

69
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,199
my grandson

70
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,119
Lu Nan.

71
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,479
Nice to meet you.

72
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,119
Nice to meet you.

73
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,000
Grandma, I'm tired.

74
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,080
I want to go upstairs to rest.

75
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,160
Sit down.

76
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,919
Xiang is a guest.

77
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:31,320
How could you leave her alone?

78
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,360
Young people have a lot to talk about.

79
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:37,360
Stay with Xiang.

80
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,160
Xiang

81
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,440
graduated from
a double first-class university.

82
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,039
And she studied the same major as yours.

83
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,839
She is beautiful

84
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,119
and can play the piano.

85
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,880
I heard that she has won awards abroad.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,679
Grandma.

87
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,800
You are exaggerating.

88
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,880
Not at all.

89
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:01,479
I'm telling the truth.

90
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,639
Right?

91
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,360
I will leave you alone.

92
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,479
Have a good chat.

93
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,240
I am going to cook.

94
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,639
Enjoy.

95
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,760
Ms. Lin.

96
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,519
You know what my grandma means, right?

97
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,399
Yes.

98
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,200
Well.

99
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:31,559
I will get to the point.

100
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,239
I have a fiancée.

101
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,119
The blind date

102
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,519
is my grandma's self-assertion.

103
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,399
So

104
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,959
please don't take it seriously.

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,799
But you are not married yet.

106
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,799
My fiancée and I will get married
sooner or later.

107
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
I heard that

108
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:52,239
grandma did not approve of your marriage.

109
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,279
It's better to

110
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,279
choose your partner on your own.

111
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,559
How can a marriage

112
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,279
not blessed by family members be happy?

113
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,880
Ms. Lin.

114
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,160
It's none of your business.

115
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:10,239
Maybe we can be friends first.

116
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,440
After you get to know me,

117
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,760
you may find that

118
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,279
I am the best person for you.

119
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:21,320
Sorry.

120
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,600
I am not interested.

121
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:25,200
I am interested.

122
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,399
Brother.

123
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,040
Sorry, Ms. Lin Xiang.

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,880
Never mind.

125
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,799
Ms. Lin Xiang.

126
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,720
Let me take you upstairs

127
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,640
to get changed.

128
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:50,119
Sure.

129
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:06,160
Sister.

130
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:07,480
I've asked nanny to

131
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,279
take your clothes for dry cleaning.

132
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,519
I'll give it back to you later.

133
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,239
Okay.

134
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,760
Wow, you look so good in this.

135
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,279
Thanks.

136
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,679
Your dress is so beautiful.

137
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,079
Of course.

138
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,679
My brother bought this for me.

139
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:21,640
Your brother bought this for you?

140
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:21,959
Yes.

141
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,000
Is it inappropriate for me to wear it?

142
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:26,920
Never mind.

143
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,399
I have a lot more.

144
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:29,640
My older brother has been the best to me

145
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,679
since I was a child.

146
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,279
He will buy me

147
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,440
all the things I like.

148
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,839
Your brother is so kind to you.

149
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,079
You must be very happy.

150
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,440
Yes, we grew up together.

151
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,640
My brother loves me the most.

152
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,200
I think

153
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,720
if I wasn't his sister,

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,600
the person my brother
would most like to marry

155
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,519
should be me.

156
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,760
But he's your brother after all.

157
00:06:58,359 --> 00:07:00,640
After he gets married,
he would have his own family.

158
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,839
Only his wife is his exception
and preference.

159
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,160
It depends on who his wife is.

160
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,959
I know about your brother and Su Bei.

161
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,519
I think

162
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,119
I am the best partner for him.

163
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:25,079
Sister, let's go downstairs first.

164
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:26,720
Brother is still waiting.

165
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,359
Okay.

166
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,440
Feier.

167
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,959
Ms. Lin Xiang.

168
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:49,000
Why did you push me?

169
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,519
What happened?

170
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,640
I pushed you?

171
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,519
Brother.

172
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:58,440
I just told Ms. Lin Xiang that

173
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,279
I already have a sister-in-law.

174
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:03,359
I didn't expect her to...

175
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,839
You're really good at calling white black.

176
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,119
Feier is right.

177
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,399
I will never be with you.

178
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,519
Stop doing

179
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,519
these pointless things.

180
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:13,200
I wouldn't do such foolish things.

181
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,119
All right.

182
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,480
Stop it.

183
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:16,679
Feier.

184
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,519
Where did you hurt?

185
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,720
Let me take a look.

186
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,239
It hurts.

187
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:22,079
Here?

188
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,399
You sprained your ankle.

189
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,880
Nan, come on.

190
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,600
Help her upstairs to get some medicine.

191
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,000
Take care.

192
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:44,799
Interesting.

193
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,200
Brother, it hurts.

194
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,239
Okay.

195
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,520
I will be careful.

196
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,840
All right.

197
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll go get you a glass of water.

198
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,440
Okay.

199
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,440
Why are you here?

200
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,039
I am here to apologize to your sister.

201
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,239
What do you want?

202
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,359
I'm here to apologize to you.

203
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,039
Isn't your foot hurt?

204
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,760
No wonder you framed me.

205
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,760
You like your brother.

206
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,640
You won't understand the relationship

207
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,760
between me and my brother.

208
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,960
In order to get a little pity
from your brother,

209
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:50,200
you hurt yourself so hard.

210
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,559
I really don't understand.

211
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:55,000
Everyone has secrets.

212
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,280
I don't think you are the exception.

213
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,159
I'm not interested in your feelings.

214
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,599
I just wonder

215
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,559
what would you do

216
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,280
when you tried your best

217
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,039
and got nothing in the end.

218
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,479
I will clear

219
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,479
all obstacles in my way one by one,

220
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,640
just like you.

221
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,400
Listen.

222
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,679
Unscrupulous people like you

223
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,840
usually come to a bad end.
