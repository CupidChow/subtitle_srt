Mr. Lu.

4
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,670
My leg hurts.

5
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,210
Come in.

6
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:03,910
Mr. Lu.

7
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,630
Let her change here.

8
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,910
Yes, Mr. Lu.

9
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,550
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

10
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,550
Mr. Lu left me

11
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,670
such a large office.

12
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,270
It shows that Mr. Lu cares about me.

13
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,350
Mr. Lu.

14
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,310
All the players have finished the show.

Okay.

17
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,750
Who did this?

18
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,310
Who did this?

19
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,270
As a model,

20
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,750
you have no professional ability

21
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,230
and only play tricks behind the scenes.

22
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,470
Do you think

23
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,710
you can beat me like this?

24
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,270
Who did this?

25
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,830
You better admit it now.

26
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,230
When I find it out,

27
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,910
you will suffer.

28
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,310
- Who did this?
- No idea.

Bring me the high-heeled shoe
in Su Manni's hand.

31
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,750
Got it.

32
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,430
Mr. Lu.

33
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,390
Look at the shoe.

34
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,990
Obviously someone is trying to frame me.

35
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,070
Seek justice for me.

36
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,110
Announce the result first.

37
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,910
The first place

38
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,670
in the company's internal selection

39
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,230
is Su Manni.

40
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,470
Your trick doesn't make sense.

41
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,190
The first place is still mine.

42
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,910
Gao Jiming.

43
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,190
Go investigate monitoring.

44
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,070
Got it.

45
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,070
Who did this?

46
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,070
If you admit now,

47
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,190
I can consider a lighter punishment.

48
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,230
But if

49
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,830
I found out who it was from the surveillance,

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,790
the result

51
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,750
remains unknown.

52
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,630
Mr. Lu, sorry.

53
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,750
Sorry.

54
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,950
I didn't do it on purpose.

55
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,030
Don't fire me.

don't forget us.

Don't worry.

00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,590
I won't forget any of you,

67

especially you.

68
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,230
Can't you smile?

69
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,390
This will only make others feel that

70
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,550
you are being forced by me.

71
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,590
Isn't that the truth?

72
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,790
We are a couple now.

73
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,430
We should act as a couple.

74
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,470
What about this?

75
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,190
I will cooperate with you.

76
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,870
So alike.

77

Really.
