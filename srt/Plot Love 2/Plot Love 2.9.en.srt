00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,420
[Episode 9]

3
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,520
Dear tourists,

4
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,470
due to today's typhoon,
swimming in the sea is prohibited.

5
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,560
It looks like we can't go back today.

6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,790
There's only one room left?

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,840
Yes, there are many tourists today.

8
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,470
The rest of the rooms are all booked up.

9
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:02,880
Let's go somewhere else.

10
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,750
Wait.

11
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:05,630
Go ahead.

12
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,510
Lu Nan!

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,800
This is the best hotel on the island.

14
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,000
So what?

15
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,080
I can't live in a hotel

16
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,270
with bad conditions.

17
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:17,630
You could stay here.

18
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,440
I will look for another one.

19
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,080
Miss, the nearest hotel

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,590
is five kilometers from here.

21
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,480
Is there any car?

22
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,510
There is no taxis on the island.

23
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,400
The shuttle bus has also stopped.

24
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,120
Maybe you need to walk over.

25
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,080
We have no choice.

26
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,040
Let's go upstairs.

27
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,480
Let's go.

28
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,080
What's wrong?

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,390
There is only one bed.

30
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,030
How are we going to sleep?

31
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,030
I will sleep on the sofa.

32
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,190
The sofa is way too small.

33
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,390
I can sleep on the sofa.

34
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,390
How can I make a woman sleep on the sofa?

35
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,080
Well...

36
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,270
Then let's sleep in the bed together.

37
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,800
Don't worry, I won't do anything to you.

38
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,030
I won't

39
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,190
cross the line.

40
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,270
Don't you trust me?

41
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,670
Sorry.

42
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,790
I didn't arrange well for today.

43
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,720
It's not your fault.

44
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,640
No one expected

45
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,880
these things to happen.

46
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,600
I just want to get some fresh air.

47
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,920
You should go to bed.

48
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,000
It's getting cold.

49
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,040
You'd better not stay out too long.

50
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,600
Actually you don't have to do this.

51
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,670
You resist me that much?

52
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,040
I didn't resist you.

53
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,880
We are just a contractual relationship.

54
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,480
I don't want to mix too many
personal feelings.

55
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,390
Why?

56
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,070
Because feelings are the most unreliable.

57
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,110
You saw what my family was like

58
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,350
that day.

59
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
My parents

60
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,950
used to love each other very much.

61
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,270
Our family was once very happy.

62
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,230
But I didn't expect my dad

63
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,270
to have an affair.

64
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,110
He also has a daughter

65
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,760
who is only a few months younger than me.

66
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,480
My mom was sad for a long time
because of this.

67
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,760
Later, she was diagnosed
with terminal cancer.

68
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,790
After she passed away,

69
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,440
Su Manni

70
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,670
and her mother

71
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,760
lived in my house in an imposing manner.

72
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,320
My dad even asked me to accept them.

73
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,230
I have been an outcast

74
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,720
since I was a child.

75
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,670
So

76
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,950
I don't have any expectation

77
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,550
for relationships.

78
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,510
Su Bei.

79
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,200
I don't care what your life was like
in the Su family before.

80
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,320
But you are a member of Lu family now.

81
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,640
I will take good care of you.

82
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,160
Thank you.

83
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,440
Don't be angry.

84
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,790
Don't be angry.

85
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,880
Don't be angry. Okay.

86
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,720
Don't be angry.

87
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,110
Manni, take some drinks.

88
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,200
Think of a way for Manni.

89
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,640
She doesn't even eat now.

90
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,070
Manni.

91
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,640
Take some water.

92
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,160
The person who would marry Lu Nan
should be me.

93
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,480
The Lu family chose Su Bei,

94
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,830
and it was officially announced.

95
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,510
Do we just let her

96
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,350
marry Lu Nan so comfortably?

97
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,110
I can't afford to offend the Lu family.

98
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,350
I didn't ask you to offend the Lu family.

99
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,070
Go to find Su Bei.

100
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,000
She's now living a good life.

101
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,320
But Manni lost a lot of weight.

102
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,270
Well...

103
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,110
What can I do?

104
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,270
Yuntian, let's do this.

105
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,920
The house she lives in

106
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,110
is your property.

107
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,790
She can't get everything.

108
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,760
Leave the house to Manni.

109
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,880
But I had promised her mother

110
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,790
to leave the house to her.

111
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,880
Did you transfer ownership?

112
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,270
She has cut ties with you.

113
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,320
Why doesn't she feel ashamed

114
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,230
to live in the Su family's house?

115
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,110
Right.

116
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,720
That house is close to Huanzhen.

117
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,040
I'll move in.

118
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:18,790
That's it.

119
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,550
What's the use of you

120
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,510
being so nice to that ungrateful person?

121
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
Manni is the one who would support you
when you get old.

122
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,040
Exactly, dad.

123
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,520
What's going on?

124
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,110
301.

125
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,110
What's going on?

126
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,470
Su Bei.

127
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,110
What happened to your house?

128
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,110
Su Manni, what are you doing?

129
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,030
Isn't it obvious?

130
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,840
I'm picking up the trash.

131
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,640
This is my house.

132
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,840
Your house?

133
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,520
It should belong to the Su family.

134
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,200
Excuse me.

135
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:23,880
Excuse me.

136
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,320
Hurry up.

137
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,550
Make it clean.

138
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,840
Stop it.

139
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,790
Why are you throwing my stuff?

140
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,550
Piss off.

141
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,030
Excuse me.

142
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,110
Why?

143
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,590
Because you robbed Lu Nan.

144
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,000
That's the reason why.

145
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,790
Why are you doing this to her?

146
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,200
Here comes the busybody.

147
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,200
Su Bei.

148
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,790
I'll help you kick her out.

149
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,520
What are you doing?

150
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,710
Are you trying to beat me?

151
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,080
Do you think I don't dare to?

152
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,670
Su Manni.

153
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,520
That's all you can do.

154
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,230
Right, the house belongs to the Su family.

155
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,840
I won't stay here any longer.

156
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:07,910
Ye Ting, let's go.

157
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,470
Mr. Lu does everything
on the spur of the moment.

158
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,230
One day he'll dump you

159
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,350
when he's had enough fun.

160
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,520
And you will be worse than now.

161
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,470
Open your mouth.

162
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,320
