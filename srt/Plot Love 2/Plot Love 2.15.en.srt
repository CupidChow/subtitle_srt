[Plot Love II]

2
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,420
[Episode 15]

3
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:55,950
Mr. Lu.

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,680
This guy looks familiar.

5
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,430
It seems to be an executive
of Mingcan Group.

6
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,910
Gao Jiming.

7
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,440
Do me a favor.

8
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:19,950
Excuse me.

9
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,360
This is the sliced beef and ox tongue in chili sauce
to Ms. Su from a gentleman.

10
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,630
Who's that?

11
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,870
Sorry, I have no idea.

12
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,760
This is couple clams

13
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,720
from that gentleman.

14
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,000
It's okay.

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,800
Let's go ahead.

16
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,480
This is dual-melons with red beans

17
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,360
from that sir again.

18
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,230
Who's that guy?

19
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,000
I didn't expect Ms. Su

20
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,480
to be so popular.

21
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,760
It seems that

22
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,800
we can't have dinner together.

23
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,030
Sorry.

24
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,320
I will show Auntie Lan

25
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,080
the fabric of your sample clothes.

26
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,390
But you just asked me to compete

27
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,390
in your company's name.

28
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,470
I'm afraid I can't agree to this.

29
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,160
Ms. Su, no worries.

30
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,470
Just go back and think about it.

31
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,360
Let's make an appointment another day.

32
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,750
Okay.

33
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:50,910
How about it?

34
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,080
Is the food in this restaurant delicious?

35
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,320
I didn't expect that Mr. Lu would be free

36
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,800
to order dishes to me.

37
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,470
I'm just reminding you out of good intentions

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,910
that you're married.

39
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,030
Waiter.

40
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
One lemon tea

41
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,160
for Mr. Jealousy.

42
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,030
It looks like our agreement

43
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,630
needs supplemental terms.

44
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,240
What to add?

45
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,720
One,

46
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,110
never get too close to the opposite sex.

47
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,240
Keep a distance from them.

48
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,270
Two, the correct attitude towards a suitor

49
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,630
should be rejecting him at the first time,

50
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,830
rather than having a meal with him.

51
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,240
Three...

52
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,470
I didn't expect Mr. Lu

53
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,270
to be so jealous.

54
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,600
Jealous?

55
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,320
Yes.

56
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,080
I just want you to keep your distance

57
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,270
from men outside

58
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,360
and maintain the image of
wife of Huanzhen's president.

59
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,520
All right.

60
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,910
But the executive

61
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,360
just came to cooperate with me.

62
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,470
He said

63
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,270
he wanted me to participate
in the competition

64
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,190
in their company's name.

65
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,440
Did you agree?

66
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,190
Of course not.

67
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,800
I have already discussed it with Auntie Lan.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,800
I decided to accept your invitation

69
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,520
and to join Huanzhen.

70
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,800
Really?

71
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,800
Yes.

72
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,040
Here are our new colleagues

73
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,600
Su Bei and Ye Ting.

74
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,790
Starting today,

75
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,270
they officially join Huanzhen.

76
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,670
Welcome to them.

77
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,670
Su Bei will represent Huanzhen as a designer

78
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,040
to continue to participate in the next competition
of Angel Covenant.

79
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,600
From the provincial preliminaries,

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,270
models are required to assist
in the display of ready-to-wear.

81
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Zheng Xiyue

82
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,440
is Huanzhen's chief model.

83
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,040
Next, she will assist Su Bei

84
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,040
in the competition.

85
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,160
Mrs. Lu is going to represent Huanzhen
in the competition.

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,320
Does the company have no confidence
in Chen Shaojie?

87
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,440
Who knows?

88
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,920
Nice to meet you, Ms. Su.

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,550
Nice to meet you.

90
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,720
Wish us a happy cooperation.

91
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,510
Me, too.

92
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,720
Su Bei!

93
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,950
The ready-to-wear for the provincial
preliminary round is ready.

94
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,550
Tell me

95
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,880
if you have any idea.

96
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,270
Did you know that Su Bei joined Huanzhen?

97
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,670
I heard about it.

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,950
Huanzhen hired Su Bei

99
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,440
obviously because

100
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,510
they had doubts about your ability.

101
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,390
I will definitely beat her

102
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,000
next time.

103
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,510
It'd better be.

104
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,760
Su Bei is your number one contender

105
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,790
in Huanzhen right now.

106
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,640
Take it seriously.

107
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,000
Don't worry, no problem.

108
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,640
All right.

109
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,350
Where is ready-to-wear?

110
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,040
It's in my office.

111
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,230
Bring it to me later.

112
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,350
I will show it to Mr. Lu first.

113
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,510
Bei.

114
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,000
Why haven't you come home yet?

115
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,160
How could I bear to let you

116
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,110
work overtime in the company alone?

117
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,000
I prepared you supper.

118
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,550
Bei.

119
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:25,920
Yes?

120
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,480
I may have to work all night tonight.

121
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,640
You should go back first.

122
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,760
I am here with you.

123
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,040
What are you doing? We are in the company.

124
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,830
It's my company.

125
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,440
Distinguished guests, hello.

126
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,550
Welcome to

127
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,550
the competition site of
the Provincial Preliminary Competition

128
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,510
of Angel Covenant Costume Design Contest.

129
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,950
Welcome.

130
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,040
On behalf of the organizer of this event,

131
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,670
I would like to express my sincere thanks

132
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,000
and warm welcome to all of you.

133
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,880
Su Bei.

134
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,510
The game is about to start.

135
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,760
Why hasn't Zheng Xiyue come yet?

136
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,720
What happened to her?

137
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,510
No idea.

138
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,830
She didn't answer my calls.

139
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,110
I will call her again.

140
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,510
Okay. Hurry up.

141
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,390
The next one. Come on.

142
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,040
Coming.

143
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,880
It's our turn. Come on.

144
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,510
Hello, the number you dialed is power off.

145
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,720
