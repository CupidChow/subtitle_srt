Episode 1

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Goddamn it!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You bastard!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You bastard!

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You bastard!

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You bastard!

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You bastard!

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You bastard!

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You are the one who bullies people.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You bastard!

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You bastard!

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Episode 2

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Goddamn it!

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I said sell it wherever you want.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Do you hear me?

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Do you hear me?

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Look at yourself.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You are buying medicine.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Goddamn it!

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You bastard!

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 3

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Our mission is to protect the people of the country.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Our mission is to protect the people of the country.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We don't care how we fight.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We don't care how we fight.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But it doesn't mean we can't do anything.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You bastard!

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
A man who is called by his name

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
will have his own way.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
How is it that you want to be a soldier?

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,560
No, it's not possible.

32
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,720
There is clear sense of shame besides it.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,740
to satisfy

34
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,740
all the rules.

35
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,140
The Demon King

36
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,140
Whowd he be.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,660
Did you ask me to be my last name?

38
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,420
How's that possible?

39
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,800
Does that mean you're members of the pooping gang?

40
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,060
Not sure, I should follow your footsteps.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You're such a jerk.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
One, two, three.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
One, two, three.

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
No problem.

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Everything is fine.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Let's eat.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Welcome home.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm sorry for what I did.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I should be sorry.

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Let me see.

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You're such a jerk.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I just got a good one.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You're such a jerk.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You're such a jerk.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You should eat more.

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Don't worry.

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Let me see.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You said you wanted to buy something that's not there.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What's not there?

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You're so serious.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If we have two people in the room,

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
we'll be in trouble.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You'll be in trouble everywhere.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You're right.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You'll see.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You'll be in trouble if you don't put it back.

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What's wrong?

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Where's the money?

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Let's eat.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Let's eat.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay.

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Let's eat.

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let's eat.

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Let's eat.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If you don't put it back,

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
you'll be in trouble.

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Wen-jiu.

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Put some more in the room.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's really not your fault.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't worry.

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's a must for a master to be a good student.

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Thank you.

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Now,

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
we have a few people left.

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Those who can sit on this table

89
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
are also capable.

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So,

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
you really have to cherish it.

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You must be united.

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And,

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
if you have a chance,

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
you should go and have a good time.

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Since we're working together,

97
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
we don't have to worry about the same thing.

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But,

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
you can

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
play a game today.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's not that hard.

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm very happy.

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Thank you.

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
After all,

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
it's not easy

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
to make money here.

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Mr. Bo,

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
you can pay first.

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'll pay for the house.

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Thank you.

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Mr. Tang,

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
there's something I want to tell you.

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
When it comes to paying,

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'll pay 15,000.

115
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll open a wine shop.

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'll open a massage shop.

117
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
300,000.

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll wait for you.

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Wait a minute.

120
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Hurry up.

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You're not ready yet.

122
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Are you going to waste your time?

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Let's go.

124
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Wait.

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You're going to wash it?

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes.

127
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You're going to wash it?

128
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll pay you.

129
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
26,000.

130
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll pay you.

131
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You want to pay?

132
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yes.

133
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Don't worry.

134
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Let's go.

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Wait.

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Look.

137
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You're not going to pay more?

138
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
No problem.

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You're going to pay?

140
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You're so generous.

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You're so kind.

142
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
If I didn't pay you,

143
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I would have gone to the shop.

144
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
If I pay you,

145
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'll be very happy.

146
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yes.

147
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You're right.

148
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You're just a man.

149
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You're right.

150
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You're so lucky.

151
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You've played with me for so many years.

152
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You're so generous.

153
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm just saying.

154
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
If you ask me,

155
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I used to play with my aunt.

156
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Now I'm a son.

157
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
My daughter is a daughter-in-law.

158
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What's Michael?

159
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Ah-Tah.

160
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What do you mean by that?

161
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
My aunt is a woman.

162
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
She's going to marry me.

163
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
She's going to marry me.

164
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
She's going to marry me.

165
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll tell you.

166
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You're in the shop too.

167
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You're a big shot.

168
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Michael, I'm sorry.

169
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm just kidding.

170
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm the most generous.

171
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm generous.

172
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Thank you.

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm so generous.

174
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm so generous.

175
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm so generous.

176
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Dad.

177
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Mr. Chow.

178
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I have something to do.

179
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm going out.

180
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay.

181
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Goodbye.

182
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Goodbye.

183
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'll talk to you later.

184
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Don't be so hard on yourself.

185
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Be careful.

186
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You're not going to buy these things?

187
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I don't know how to buy them.

188
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You have to wait a few days.

190
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You're going to die.

191
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You're not going to die either.

192
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You're going to die.

193
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You're going to die.

194
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You're going to die.

195
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Today, I'm the happiest to celebrate my brother's coming out.

196
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's right.

197
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I have good news.

198
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What news?

199
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What?

200
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm going to be killed.

201
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm going to be killed.

202
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm the one who's going to be killed.

203
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Don't talk nonsense.

204
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm going to be killed.

205
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm going to buy a house with Xuan.

206
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
We're not going to move in anymore.

207
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We have to pay for ourselves.

208
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You're so annoying.

209
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You're not even sleeping.

210
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You're even...

211
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You're even sleeping on the bed.

212
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm not sleeping.

213
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm just thinking about how we can live a better life.

214
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We can live a good life.

215
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Okay.

216
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
We'll live a good life.

217
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm also thinking about...

218
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We have to pay for our own house.

219
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You're a grown man.

220
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Why are you so scared?

221
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You're going to be a big shot.

222
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You're right.

223
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Come on.

224
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm so tired.

225
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
This thing is so old.

226
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
This thing is so old.

227
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Don't talk nonsense.

228
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
We're so scared.

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You're going to be a big shot.

230
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What are we going to do now?

231
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What are we going to do?

232
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm going to be a big shot.

233
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You're a grown man.

234
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You're not going to be a big shot.

235
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm not going to be a big shot.

236
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
People can go through a lot of difficulties.

237
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You're going to be a big shot.

238
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You're going to be a big shot.

239
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Come on.

240
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Come on.

241
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Come on.

242
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Come on.

243
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Come on.

244
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Come on.

245
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Come on.

246
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Come on.

247
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Come on.

248
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Come on.

249
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Come on.

250
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Come on.

251
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Come on.

252
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Come on.

253
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Come on.

254
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Come on.

255
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Come on.

256
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Come on.

257
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Come on.

258
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Come on.

259
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Come on.

260
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Come on.

261
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Come on.

262
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Come on.

263
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm a big shot.

264
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You guys are a big shot.

265
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm a big shot.

266
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Come on.

267
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Come on.

268
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Come on.

269
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Come on.

270
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Come on.

271
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Come on.

272
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Come on.

273
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Come on.

274
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Come on.

275
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Come on.

276
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Come on.

277
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Come on.

278
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Come on.

279
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Come on.

280
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Come on.

281
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Come on.

282
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Come on.

283
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
What are you doing?

284
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm just playing.

285
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You're playing with the ball?

286
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm just playing.

287
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You guys are awesome.

288
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
No one dares to make trouble in my field.

289
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm going to have one now.

290
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh.

291
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What?

292
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Wow.

293
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You guys are very brave.

294
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Got some big fucking balls.

295
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You said you were going to scare me.

296
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm not going to be annoyed with you.

297
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I happen to have a business.

298
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
A business needs someone who has the guts to do it.

299
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
How about it?

300
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Dare or not?

301
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What's so good about it?

302
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Open it.

303
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Hurry up.

304
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Really?

305
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
No.

306
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You're so stupid.

307
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Go and smoke.

308
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm here to make trouble today.

309
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm sure you are all characters.

310
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So I asked you to make some money.

311
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
How's that?

312
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I don't know any better.

313
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm here to make trouble.

314
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm scared to death.

315
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Huh?

316
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Do you dare or not?

317
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I dare not.

318
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You're a jerk.

319
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You're a jerk.

320
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Come on.

321
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
This one can help you.

322
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
After the test,

323
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
you can help me.

324
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Fine.

325
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'll wait for you here.

326
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'll wait for you here.

327
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Duan Xian.

328
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What are you doing here?

329
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Come on.

330
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You're a jerk.

331
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Good luck, bitches.

332
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Why are you looking for them?

333
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Are you fucking stupid?

334
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You're not going to represent me when you go out?

335
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
These three bastards are dead.

336
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's none of my business.

337
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Motherfuckers.

338
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Motherfuckers.

339
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Oh, shit.

340
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You're really useless

341
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
after you didn't come back.

342
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Why would I be useless?

343
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You know you almost

344
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
couldn't get away today.

345
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Don't be so cruel.

346
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What are you talking about?

347
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Tell me.

348
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm telling you.

349
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm asking you.

350
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
How did you get here?

351
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I came by foot.

352
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You're a jerk.

353
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
We came here by name.

354
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
We only have one name.

355
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Keng.

356
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Don't always

357
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
think about the future.

358
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You know you have to be careful.

359
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
We're lucky today.

360
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
If we're not lucky,

361
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
they won't know

362
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
when they're going to get us back.

363
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You're wrong.

364
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
No one says you're wrong.

365
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You know that?

366
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You should have listened to me.

367
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You're so stupid.

368
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You're so stupid.

369
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm just a detective.

370
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Don't talk so much.

371
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's burnt.

372
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Look.

373
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's burnt.

374
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's burnt.

375
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
We'll burn it.

376
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Got it?

377
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Got it.

378
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Come on.

379
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'll help you.

380
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Hello.

381
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Hello.

382
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
This is 150.

383
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
How much is it?

384
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
100.

385
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
100 for 100.

386
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's not 100.

387
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
100 for 100.

388
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
100 for 100.

389
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's not 100.

390
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
100 for 100.

391
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
100 for 100.

392
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Here.

393
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
One.

394
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Here.

395
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Got it?

396
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Wow.

397
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Look.

398
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Look at this.

399
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's a firework.

400
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's a firework.

401
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
How is it?

402
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's really good.

403
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's really good.

404
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
How is it?

405
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Superb.

406
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Bring the flint.

407
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
OK.

408
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Oh, it's so great.

409
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Awesome.

410
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Hey!

411
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Oh.

412
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Oh.

413
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Rock, paper, scissors.

414
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Who goes first?

415
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You go first.

416
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Come on.

417
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Come on.

418
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Come on.

419
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You go first.

420
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You go first.

421
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Come on.

422
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You go first.

423
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Here's this.

424
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Yeah.

425
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You hit it.

426
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You hit it.

427
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You hit it.

428
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You hit it.

429
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I was worried about you.

430
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Why did you run so fast?

431
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You hit it.

432
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You hit it.

433
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Hit it.

434
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Hit it.

435
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
What's wrong?

436
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Hit it.

437
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Hurry.

438
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You hit it too hard.

439
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Let me see.

440
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Hit it.

441
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Sorry.

442
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'll be right back.

443
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's dark.

444
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Hurry.

445
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Sorry.

446
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Hurry.

447
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Hurry.

448
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Hurry.

449
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You hit it.

450
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's dark.

451
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Hurry.

452
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You hit it too hard.

453
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Hit it.

454
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You hit it.

455
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You hit it.

456
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Hit it.

457
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Hurry.

458
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Of course it's dark.

459
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:52,000
What's wrong?

460
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You hit it too hard.

461
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Hit it.

462
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I was right, didn't I?

463
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's good.

464
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You hit it too hard.

465
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Pass it.

466
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's powerful.

467
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You are being happening.

468
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Hitting on me because you're stupid?

469
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Hong-Zi, you're really a good son.

470
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I didn't know you were so good at driving.

471
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You're the first person I see driving a car.

472
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm sorry.

473
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
This one is yours.

474
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
That's enough.

475
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Why are you like this?

476
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Get out of here.

477
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I won't.

478
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I won't.

479
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'll sell you if you say so.

480
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You hear me?

481
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Do you know what you're doing?

482
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I know.

483
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm making money.

484
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You're drugging.

485
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You even sold my property.

486
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Do you think this apple belongs to the apple tree?

487
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Or to me?

488
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
If you want to talk, just talk.

489
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Okay.

490
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
What if the top floor belongs to me?

491
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
If the top floor belongs to you, what about me?

492
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I'll make it clear.

493
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
If you support me,

494
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
you'll get more benefits.

495
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
The times are different now.

496
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It's too traditional and old-fashioned to use.

497
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
What's wrong with selling drugs?

498
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
There's supply and demand.

499
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's a business.

500
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And our goods.

501
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Holy shit, it's fucking good.

502
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I didn't force anyone.

503
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
They want to try his stuff.

504
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Did I force them to buy?

505
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
If we don't sell, others will.

506
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Why don't we make money together?

507
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Think about it.

508
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I just want to work with you.

509
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I only trust you.

510
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Come on.

511
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Okay, you go first.

512
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
You can open it yourself.

513
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
No, I'll open it myself.

514
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You go first.

515
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Brother.

516
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Brother.

517
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
It's so noisy.

518
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Brother.

519
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Brother.

520
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Brother, this year,

521
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
we'll have to find you or me.

522
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It's the same for all of us.

523
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
What matters is me.

524
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
You're all grown-ups.

525
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
You're here to make a living.

526
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
You're better than this.

527
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
It's so hot.

528
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It's so hot.

529
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
You should have a drink.

530
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Okay.

531
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I'll tell you, brother.

532
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
You're a fucking brother.

533
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
You really think you're the boss?

534
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I just want to work with you.

535
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Think about it.

536
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Let's work together.

537
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
What the hell are you doing?

538
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Get up.

539
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Think about it.

540
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Go.

541
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
You tricked me here.

542
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Fuck you.

543
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Don't move.

544
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Stop fighting.

545
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You're a fucking bastard.

546
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Why did they bring this person here?

547
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Do you think I will be able to handle one job?

548
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
If you don't want to go to Major General crookedness with them,

549
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
If they are partnership,

550
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I will not have a stand...

551
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You're here again.

552
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Then I'm sorry.

553
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Get him!

554
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Hurry up!

555
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Get him!

556
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Hurry up!

557
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Hurry up!

558
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You bastard!

559
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Hurry up!

560
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Hurry up!

561
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Hurry up!

562
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Hurry up!

563
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Hurry up!

564
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You bastard!

565
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'll kill you!

566
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Get out of here!

567
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
What the hell are you doing?

568
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Throw it away!

569
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Get out of here!

570
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
After him!

571
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Get down!

572
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Get down!

573
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Get down!

574
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Let me go!

575
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Let me go!

576
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
You bastard!

577
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
You bastard!

578
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Get down!

579
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
This is a murder!

580
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
You bastard!

581
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I'll kill you!

582
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You old men can't even joke around, right?

583
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
You even hit my mom!

584
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Can't I even joke around?

585
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I'm just joking.

586
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Just joking.

587
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Michael,

588
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
you better remember,

589
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
if you ever get a chance to get your ass kicked,

590
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I'll kick your ass!

591
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Kid,

592
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I'm sorry for bothering you.

593
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
No, it's okay.

594
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
It's my duty.

595
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
You guys have been together for a long time.

596
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I've been to the North Gate of the Kowloon Village.

597
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
You're a fucking bastard!

598
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Wait a minute.

599
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I'll handle something.

600
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
You, come here.

601
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Come here.

602
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Come here!

603
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
What the hell are you doing?

604
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Young man,

605
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
you have to look at the situation after you're done joking.

606
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
If you don't stop,

607
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
you'll be in trouble anyway.

608
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You won't get a chance to eat or sleep.

609
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Wait a minute.

610
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
If you want to be so stupid,

611
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I'll definitely make you regret it.

612
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Do you hear me?

613
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Do you hear me?

614
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Okay!

615
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Shit!

616
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Hey,

617
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
you're here to eat?

618
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Sorry.

619
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
You're a bastard.

620
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
We're friends.

621
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
You're a bastard.

622
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
You're a bastard.

623
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
You're a bastard.

624
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
You're a bastard.

625
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Qing Feng!

626
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
From now on,

627
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
you're you,

628
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
and I'm me.

629
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Qing Feng.

630
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Qing Feng.

631
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Qing Feng.

632
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Qing Feng.

633
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Qing Feng.

634
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Qing Feng.

635
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Qing Feng.

636
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Qing Feng.

637
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Qing Feng.

638
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Qing Feng.

639
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Qing Feng.

640
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Qing Feng.

641
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Qing Feng.

642
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Qing Feng.

643
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Qing Feng.

644
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Qing Feng.

645
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,500
Qing Fai.

646
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Qing Fai,

647
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
What happened?

648
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Different things happened over time.

649
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
You must be testing me in this situation.

650
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Are you n concentric?

651
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Are you the sort of person who is never salt of its own kind?

652
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I'm still trying

653
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
You can't come here without your father.

654
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
If you don't have your father's blood,

655
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
you can come back safely.

656
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
It doesn't matter if you're dead or alive.

657
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Why are you crying?

658
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
If you're not crying,

659
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
you can take him out.

660
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I'll kill this bastard.

661
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Dad,

662
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Hada is joking with me.

663
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
You're so angry with me today.

664
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm not successful.

665
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I'm not going to take Beichen down.

666
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
If I really take Beichen down,

667
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
will you still scold me here?

668
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Don't look. I'm not talking to you.

669
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It's not as simple as you think.

670
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
You're here to protect yourself.

671
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
You're not here to beat people.

672
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
You're here to beat a good person.

673
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
You're here to beat a good person.

674
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You're here to beat a good person.

675
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
That's why they all look down on you.

676
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
You're in their eyes.

677
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
It's a big deal.

678
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
You're here to beat a good person.

679
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
You're here to do nothing

680
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
because you're a good person.

681
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Or because you're a bad kid?

682
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
You're a bad kid.

683
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
You're a bad kid.

684
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Then I'll let them have mercy on you.

685
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Let me go.

686
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Dad,

687
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
it's my fault.

688
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I shouldn't have taken so many people with me.

689
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You should have told me then.

690
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
What are you doing?

691
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I'm not right.

692
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
What are you talking about?

693
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
We're not wrong.

694
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
That's what it's like to be a brother.

695
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
What's wrong with your brain?

696
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Michael.

697
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You're still called Michael?

698
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
You're really a bad person.

699
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Michael,

700
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I can't stand you anymore.

701
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Before you killed your mother,

702
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
you were a bad person.

703
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
You're a bad person.

704
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:22,600
At the age of

705
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,300
сейчас

706
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,900
Michael is allez

707
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,900
How is it to bring all your people here?

708
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,900
Are you talking about your children?

709
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,900
Yong-Hui, what do you think?

710
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,900
He's been working hard for the past ten years.

711
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,900
His children are like our children.

712
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,900
They're not easy to deal with.

713
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,900
Yong-Hui, you know how to treat your wife.

714
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,900
You're just like a child.

715
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,900
Don't you feel sad?

716
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,900
Yong-Hui,

717
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,900
it's all the same.

718
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,900
But if this thing is exposed,

719
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,900
it will definitely be a scandal.

720
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,900
If you want to bring your children here,

721
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,900
you have to listen to your parents.

722
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,900
Come on.

723
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,900
I've been taking care of you.

724
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,900
You've been taking care of the government.

725
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,900
You're not going to talk about this anymore?

726
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,900
When I was young, I was a housewife.

727
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,900
Now what?

728
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,900
You want to bring your children here?

729
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,900
You want to bring your children here?

730
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,900
You want to bring your children here?

731
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,900
You want to bring your children here?

732
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,900
Why do you want to bring them here?

733
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,900
Yong-Hui,

734
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,900
don't talk to him.

735
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,900
I'll be worried.

736
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,900
You know I'm a poor man.

737
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,900
I'm not a good man.

738
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,900
If a child is so big,

739
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,900
because he's so big,

740
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,900
look, he's sorry.

741
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,900
But you know,

742
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,900
I'm not a good man.

743
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,900
Come on.

744
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,900
Come on.

745
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,900
Listen.

746
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,900
Think about it.

747
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,900
Yong-Hui treats you like this.

748
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,900
He treats you like this.

749
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,900
If you were me,

750
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,900
you wouldn't have been so lucky.

751
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,900
You'd have a good family.

752
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,900
You're not a child.

753
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,900
You're not a child.

754
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,900
You're not a child.

755
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,900
You're a big kid.

756
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,900
I really don't expect you to be like your parents.

757
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,900
You're not a kid.

758
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,900
You're a kid.

759
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,900
You're a kid.

760
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,900
You're a kid.

761
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,900
I'm a kid.

762
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,900
You're the best.

763
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,900
I'll listen to you.

764
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,900
I'll listen to you.

765
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,900
Do you feel better?

766
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,900
Do it.

767
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,900
What are you talking about?

768
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,900
What?

769
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,900
What?

770
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,900
Thisiness is right.

771
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,900
Comrade Qi⁛

772
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,900
Mr. Qi!

773
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,900
My sister pondered a way

774
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,900
to deal with you.

775
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,900
You better make it mother.

776
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,900
Huh?

777
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,720
From today on,

778
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,440
you are you.

779
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,040
I am me.

780
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,360
Ho ho ho ho.

781
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,440
Holy fucking shit.

782
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,240
Woo!

783
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,660
Hey.

784
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,200
These three bastards can get rid of a casino.

785
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:58,780
You can't even get rid of two old men.

786
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,400
Ha ha ha ha.

787
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,700
Woo!

788
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,200
Yeah!

789
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,200
Ha ha ha.

790
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:06,940
Hey.

791
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,940
I didn't expect you to come back alive.

792
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,240
You're getting more handsome.

793
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,060
You're awesome. I know.

794
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,780
Oh shit.

795
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,780
Ah.

796
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,360
Ha ha ha.

797
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,240
I told you.

798
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,940
You're the ones who got it.

799
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,440
Shit.

800
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,940
That's not right.

801
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,940
Hey.

802
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,820
Don't be nervous.

803
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,940
Don't be nervous.

804
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,940
It's going to be alright.

805
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,280
I'll give you a prize.

806
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,780
A prize for your work.

807
00:42:58,940 --> 00:42:59,940
Look.

808
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,940
I'm not that bad.

809
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:03,940
Ha ha ha.

810
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,940
You three really have something.

811
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,940
We'll stay and check the goods.

812
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:12,940
I'll let you know.

813
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,440
Michael.

814
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,940
Our three brothers are very rich.

815
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,940
You can't be too long.

816
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:26,940
Call me.

817
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:30,940
I'm waiting for you.

818
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:32,940
Yeah.

819
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:33,940
I saw.

820
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:49,940
Woo.

821
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,940
I like these boys.

822
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,940
What the fuck are you looking at?

823
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:01,940
Ha h Gen.

824
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,940
Don't look at me.

825
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,800
Evie.

826
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:08,940
God.

827
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,280
Let me hit the road for you.

828
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:12,940
What the fuck are you doing?

829
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:15,940
Hold on,

830
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:16,940
some Mixed Up liquors.

831
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,940
No it's not Mixed Up liquors.

832
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:19,940
Don't tell Gao 우와.

833
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:21,940
Come on.

834
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:25,720
You two come here looking for someone to drink.

835
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:26,820
Ahh.

836
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:28,940
Pretty garbage.

837
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,940
You're so smart.

838
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,940
I'm proud of you.

839
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,940
Thank you.

840
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,940
Come on.

841
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,940
Take this.

842
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,940
Sorry.

843
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,940
Come on.

844
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:44,940
Let's drink.

845
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:46,940
To celebrate today's birthday,

846
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:48,940
let's drink.

847
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,940
Happy birthday.

848
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,940
Cheers.

849
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,940
Cheers.

850
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,940
Cheers.

851
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,940
Cheers.

852
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,940
Cheers.

853
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,940
OK.

854
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,940
Today,

855
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,940
Huang Yi and others will be here to participate in my birthday.

856
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,940
I'll give him a big one.

857
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,940
Of course, you can press it.

858
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,940
Thank you.

859
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,940
Thank you.

860
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,940
You're welcome.

861
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,940
Cheers.

862
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:32,940
The guy

863
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,940
is not good at cooking.

864
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,940
He's looking for me.

865
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,940
But he doesn't have much time.

866
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,940
His fortune is not good.

867
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,940
I think you guys should

868
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,940
support me.

869
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,940
The next time you guys get a cramp,

870
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:48,940
it may be a heart disease.

871
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,940
I'll get rid of you guys

872
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,940
when you're in the worst condition.

873
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:56,940
The new city town sounds good

874
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,940
But to take so much land from our back

875
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:04,940
This also requires the local capitalists to agree

876
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:08,940
And this profit is not up to you and me

877
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,940
This also requires them to agree

878
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,940
It's just a matter of time

879
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,940
After we have a good house, you see everyone knows how much

880
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,940
The hospital is just like this place, everyone is happy

881
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,940
It's just a matter of time

882
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:24,940
The hospital is the hospital, everyone needs to be safe

883
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:28,940
Just like the old saying, don't let everyone down

884
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:33,940
That's right

885
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:36,940
You call someone a man and you want to get him a big house

886
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,940
That's going to cost a lot

887
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:42,940
We're all not good at beating the feelings of the neighbors

888
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:48,940
Yes, this big building is not for three people

889
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:52,940
To open a lot, to spend a lot of money, no one knows

890
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,940
It's just a matter of time

891
00:46:54,940 --> 00:47:18,780
It's not right to be a little more

892
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:26,940
To tego

893
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,940
Def�

894
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:32,940
Let!

895
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:35,940
Just the

896
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:36,940
Oh

897
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,940
A

898
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,760
I heavens

899
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,000
For sure, we're even cooler.

900
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:03,240
antic Idol

901
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:07,220
ою

902
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:07,300
The baby didn't

903
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:07,400
the baby didn't

904
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,400
You're here early.

905
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,400
I have something to do.

906
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,400
I'm here to buy some wine.

907
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,400
Is it good?

908
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,400
Come on.

909
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,400
Madam.

910
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,400
I'm here to buy some wine.

911
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,400
Yes.

912
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,400
They've been more generous since they were young.

913
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,400
Yes.

914
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,400
Yes.

915
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,400
Michael is in the US.

916
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,400
He's taking care of the business.

917
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,400
He's back now.

918
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,400
He'll be back soon.

919
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,400
I know.

920
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,400
I don't need to be polite.

921
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,400
How's he doing?

922
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,400
Is he still in the hospital?

923
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,400
Michael is still young.

924
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,400
He's doing things more carefully.

925
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,400
He needs to be polite.

926
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,400
It's not a big deal.

927
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,400
I'm worried about him.

928
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,400
He's not doing well.

929
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,400
Don't worry.

930
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,400
I have a question.

931
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,400
Other people...

932
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:25,400
are so ignorant about their own lives.

933
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,400
If they have a place to live...

934
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,400
how will they live?

935
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,400
If they have nothing to eat...

936
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,400
it's not a big deal.

937
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:41,400
It's not a good thing for us.

938
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,400
Dad.

939
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,400
Come in.

940
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,400
Hello, Michael.

941
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,400
It's been a long time.

942
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,400
How come you're back?

943
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,400
Why didn't you tell me?

944
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,400
I didn't come on your birthday.

945
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,400
Your birthday?

946
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,400
Yes.

947
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,400
I'm sorry.

948
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,400
I know.

949
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,400
I'll arrange a party tomorrow night.

950
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,400
It's great.

951
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,400
I'll be busy.

952
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,400
I need to talk to your dad.

953
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,400
He won't help me.

954
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,400
I believe you can convince him...

955
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,400
with your relationship.

956
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,400
But my dad is still a big shot.

957
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,400
He's the boss.

958
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,400
Ben.

959
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,400
Long time no see.

960
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,400
You guys talk first.

961
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,400
Here.

962
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,400
Thank you.

963
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,400
Michael.

964
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,400
Yes.

965
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,400
I have something to tell you.

966
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,400
What is it?

967
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,400
The old people...

968
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,400
will be upset.

969
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,400
Actually...

970
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,400
we need to talk.

971
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,400
We all have a meeting.

972
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,400
We need to talk.

973
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,400
I know.

974
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,400
You've been waiting for a long time.

975
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,400
Give them the money.

976
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,400
Are you sure?

977
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,400
Any objection?

978
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,400
No.

979
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,400
Be happy for them.

980
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,400
Make big money.

981
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,400
Like you said.

982
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,400
This is a big deal.

983
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,400
Who is tough and capable...

984
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,400
will make money.

985
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,400
That's right.

986
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,400
Who is tough and capable...

987
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,400
will make money.

988
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,400
Damn it.

989
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,400
Will you play badminton?

990
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,400
Damn it.

991
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,400
That's right.

992
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,400
That's how it's beautiful.

993
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,400
Damn it.

994
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,400
So cool.

995
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,400
Hey.

996
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,400
I want to see the ball.

997
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,400
Three badminton players.

998
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,400
Welcome.

999
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,400
So expensive.

1000
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,400
Have you seen so much money?

1001
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,400
I want to ask you guys.

1002
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,400
How much did you spend?

1003
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,400
I spent...

1004
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,400
a lot.

1005
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,400
A lot?

1006
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,400
I spent a lot.

1007
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,400
Be careful.

1008
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,400
There's a lot of money.

1009
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,400
It's a lot.

1010
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,400
Who invented this sport?

1011
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,400
Hurry up.

1012
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,400
Let's go.

1013
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,400
Wait.

1014
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,400
I can't kick.

1015
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,400
You can't?

1016
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,400
Why?

1017
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,400
Yeah.

1018
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,400
I can't.

1019
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,400
What's wrong?

1020
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,400
You're a loser.

1021
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,400
This one can't.

1022
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,400
What's wrong?

1023
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,400
You're in.

1024
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,400
Let go.

1025
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,400
Let go.

1026
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,400
Let go.

1027
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,400
We're almost there.

1028
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,400
Yeah.

1029
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,400
We're almost there.

1030
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,400
We're almost there.

1031
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,400
Hundred euros worth.

1032
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,400
We can't afford it.

1033
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,400
We have all the money.

1034
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,400
What about the money?

1035
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,400
No.

1036
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,400
You won't be able to see the money.

1037
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,400
How much?

1038
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,400
How much?

1039
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,400
If we're lucky,

1040
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,400
we can get a new ball.

1041
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,400
How much?

1042
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,400
We have to tell you.

1043
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,400
What's up?

1044
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,400
I'm not in the mood.

1045
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,400
What's up?

1046
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,400
What's the matter?

1047
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,400
What do you want?

1048
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,400
Get off the car.

1049
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,400
Get off the car.

1050
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,400
Alright.

1051
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,400
Hurry up.

1052
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,400
The water is so deep.

1053
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,400
It's not deep enough.

1054
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,400
It's not deep enough.

1055
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,400
It's not deep enough.

1056
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,400
It's not deep enough.

1057
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,400
It's not deep enough.

1058
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,400
It's not deep enough.

1059
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,400
It's not deep enough.

1060
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,400
It's not deep enough.

1061
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,400
It's not deep enough.

1062
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,400
It's not deep enough.

1063
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,400
It's not deep enough.

1064
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,400
It's not deep enough.

1065
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,400
It's not deep enough.

1066
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,400
It's not deep enough.

1067
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,400
It's not deep enough.

1068
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,400
It's not deep enough.

1069
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,400
It's not deep enough.

1070
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,400
It's not deep enough.

1071
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,400
It's not deep enough.

1072
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,400
It's not deep enough.

1073
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,400
It's not deep enough.

1074
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,400
It's not deep enough.

1075
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,400
It's not deep enough.

1076
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,400
It's not deep enough.

1077
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,400
It's not deep enough.

1078
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,400
It's not deep enough.

1079
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,400
It's not deep enough.

1080
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,400
We're just friends.

1081
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,400
We can just talk for a while.

1082
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,400
I don't want to talk too much.

1083
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,400
But...

1084
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,400
I think you should call him.

1085
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,400
Brother-in-law, what do you think?

1086
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,400
I'm nervous.

1087
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,400
How do you know?

1088
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,400
Brother-in-law,

1089
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,400
I think the friend you just met

1090
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,400
is a little bit more careful.

1091
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,400
If he's not a little bit more careful,

1092
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,400
I'll get you a drink.

1093
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,400
You're the best.

1094
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,400
I'm telling you.

1095
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,400
I'm not.

1096
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,400
I'm not.

1097
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,400
I'm not.

1098
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,400
I'm not.

1099
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,400
Brother-in-law, let's go.

1100
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,400
Let's go to the next place.

1101
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,400
Let's go.

1102
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,400
Brother-in-law.

1103
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,400
Brother-in-law.

1104
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,400
You're so stupid.

1105
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,400
You're so stupid.

1106
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,400
Brother-in-law, you're stupid.

1107
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,400
Don't call me that.

1108
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,400
You're a bad person.

1109
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,400
I told you to call him by his first name.

1110
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,400
You don't know how to take care of him.

1111
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,400
Brother-in-law,

1112
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,400
I'm sure you'll be fine.

1113
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,400
I'll look after you.

1114
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,400
You're going to look after me?

1115
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,400
Okay.

1116
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,400
I'll call you brother-in-law.

1117
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,400
You!

1118
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,400
You're so stupid.

1119
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,400
What's going on?

1120
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,400
It's none of your business.

1121
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,400
I'm tired.

1122
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,400
You're so stupid.

1123
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,400
You're so stupid.

1124
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,400
You're so stupid.

1125
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,400
Brother-in-law, what's going on?

1126
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,400
Brother-in-law, are you okay?

1127
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,400
Brother-in-law, are you okay?

1128
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,400
Brother-in-law, what's going on?

1129
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,400
Brother-in-law, don't call me that.

1130
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,400
Brother-in-law, don't call me that.

1131
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,400
I'm going to die.

1132
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,400
What are you going to do?

1133
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,400
I'm going to die.

1134
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,400
I'm going to die.

1135
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,400
You're not a big shot.

1136
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,400
Don't call me that.

1137
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,400
Brother-in-law, really.

1138
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,400
You're so stupid.

1139
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,400
You're so stupid.

1140
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,400
I'll go to the hospital.

1141
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,400
You know what?

1142
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,400
You should be more careful.

1143
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,400
If you're stupid,

1144
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,400
you'll be in trouble.

1145
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,400
If I want to be a citizen,

1146
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,400
I'll be a citizen for a while.

1147
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,400
I don't care.

1148
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,400
I don't care about the government.

1149
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,400
I don't care about you.

1150
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,400
You're so stupid.

1151
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,400
Brother-in-law!

1152
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,400
I'm going to die.

1153
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,400
You're so stupid.

1154
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,400
I'll kill you.

1155
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,400
I'll kill you.

1156
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,400
Go.

1157
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,400
Go.

1158
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,400
If you don't do it,

1159
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,400
I'll kill you.

1160
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,400
Go.

1161
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,400
I want to drive with you.

1162
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,400
Don't eat your mouth.

1163
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,400
Go to hell.

1164
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,400
Hey.

1165
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,400
You're so stupid.

1166
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,400
You don't know how to drive.

1167
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,400
You're so stupid.

1168
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,400
You're so stupid.

1169
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,400
You should be more careful.

1170
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,400
Go to hell.

1171
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,400
I'll kill you.

1172
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,400
Go.

1173
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,400
I want to die.

1174
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,400
I want to die.

1175
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,400
I'm so scared.

1176
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,400
I'll kill you.

1177
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,400
Go.

1178
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,400
Go.

1179
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,400
I'm scared.

1180
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,400
I'm scared.

1181
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,400
I'll kill you.

1182
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,400
Go.

1183
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,400
Go.

1184
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,400
Go.

1185
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,400
I'm scared.

1186
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,400
I'll kill you.

1187
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,400
Brother, you're back.

1188
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,400
Brother, you're hurt.

1189
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,400
I'm fine.

1190
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,400
Why are you hurt?

1191
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,400
Nothing.

1192
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,400
Where are you going?

1193
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,400
Where are you hurt?

1194
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,400
Where's your face?

1195
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,400
I'm scared.

1196
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,400
Brother-in-law.

1197
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,400
Where are you going?

1198
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,400
I can't find you.

1199
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,400
It's okay.

1200
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,400
We're back.

1201
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,400
You let a pregnant woman wait for you all night.

1202
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,400
You dare not sleep.

1203
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,400
Stop arguing.

1204
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,400
Let's talk tomorrow.

1205
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,400
I'm not arguing.

1206
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,400
Are you okay?

1207
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,400
What have you done?

1208
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,400
I can't ask.

1209
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,400
What's going on?

1210
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,400
I'll report to you.

1211
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,400
Brother, you two.

1212
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,400
Can't you talk properly?

1213
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,400
You're doing this.

1214
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,400
We're just kids.

1215
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,400
How can we do this?

1216
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,400
How can we do this?

1217
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,400
Don't do that.

1218
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,400
We're just kids.

1219
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,400
We're just kids.

1220
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,400
We're back.

1221
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,400
Brother.

1222
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,400
You're wrong.

1223
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,400
You have to do it.

1224
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,400
Are you going to hit me?

1225
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,400
Are you going to hit me?

1226
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,400
You're so happy.

1227
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,400
What are you thinking?

1228
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,400
I'm scared I can't talk.

1229
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,400
You're so stupid.

1230
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,400
Don't do that.

1231
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,400
Go to bed.

1232
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,400
Why?

1233
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,400
gente at in loading

1234
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,400
People who are not goodly

1235
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,400
No, no, no.

1236
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,400
No, no.

1237
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,400
Hey, you're still young.

1238
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,400
You're still taking care of him.

1239
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,400
You're still young.

1240
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,400
You're still young.

1241
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,400
So,

1242
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,400
you should treat people with respect.

1243
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,400
You're still young.

1244
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,400
You're still young.

1245
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,400
You're still young.

1246
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,400
You're still young.

1247
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,400
Yes.

1248
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,400
So, you're here to find a job.

1249
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,400
I'm asking him

1250
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,400
about how you do business.

1251
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,400
Yes.

1252
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,400
When you were young,

1253
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,400
you were always stuck.

1254
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,400
You always felt like

1255
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,400
you were getting worse.

1256
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,400
You were doing the same thing.

1257
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,400
But do you know

1258
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,400
why you did that?

1259
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,400
Dad, why are you saying this?

1260
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,400
I was just talking to him.

1261
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,400
Nothing.

1262
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,400
No.

1263
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,400
The luggage in the basement

1264
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,400
is in our room.

1265
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,400
If we can get it

1266
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,400
we can get it back.

1267
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,400
We have to get it back.

1268
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,400
Yes.

1269
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,400
But you're going to do something.

1270
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,400
You're right.

1271
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,400
You're right.

1272
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,400
The basement is not as bad as it looks.

1273
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,400
But

1274
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,400
you should treat people with respect.

1275
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,400
You should treat people with respect.

1276
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,400
I know.

1277
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,400
Dad.

1278
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,400
Uncle.

1279
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,400
Have some more.

1280
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,400
Okay.

1281
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,400
Come on.

1282
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,400
Michael.

1283
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,400
You're going to treat people with respect.

1284
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,400
Are you going to do that?

1285
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,400
Yes.

1286
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,400
I wanted to get rid of

1287
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,400
those old men.

1288
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,400
But my grandpa was so mean.

1289
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,400
He kept saying

1290
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,400
that those old men

1291
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,400
were all

1292
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,400
like this.

1293
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,400
Little cats?

1294
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,400
People used to be

1295
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,400
so mean.

1296
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,400
They were all

1297
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,400
just like us.

1298
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,400
I'm not going to let them

1299
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,400
get away with it.

1300
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,400
They've been here for too long.

1301
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,400
Don't be afraid.

1302
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,400
You have to be careful.

1303
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,400
I understand.

1304
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,400
Let's go.

1305
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,400
We meet again.

1306
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,400
Don't don't.

1307
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,400
Come on.

1308
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,000
I come.

1309
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,400
Must be hurt.

1310
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,740
I'm sorry.

1311
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,960
same enough

1312
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:09,280
Bring him in

1313
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,280
wszystko

1314
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,760
hi, the coffee

1315
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:22,760
you're back

1316
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:28,400
You promised me this when we were in the army.

1317
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,400
You promised me this when we were in the army.

1318
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:34,400
You promised me this when we were in the army.

1319
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:38,400
But now you're doing something else.

1320
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,400
You want to take me to the front line?

1321
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:44,400
He's just a child.

1322
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,400
He'll do something.

1323
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:49,400
He's just a kid.

1324
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:53,400
You're not the same as when you were young.

1325
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:56,400
You said you didn't do anything like this before.

1326
01:08:56,400 --> 01:09:00,400
We used to do a lot of things.

1327
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:03,400
Now we're doing a lot of things.

1328
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,400
You used to be a good man.

1329
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,400
You used to be a good man.

1330
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:10,400
You used to be a good man.

1331
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:13,400
A good man?

1332
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:16,400
He's my friend.

1333
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:19,400
You're talking nonsense.

1334
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,400
Can you still talk now?

1335
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,400
Can you still talk now?

1336
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,400
Okay, okay.

1337
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:28,400
Let's talk about it.

1338
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:31,400
I'm not talking nonsense.

1339
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,400
You're still talking nonsense.

1340
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,400
You're still talking nonsense.

1341
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,400
Who's going to change the fate?

1342
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:39,400
Michael, do you have any shame?

1343
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,400
I'm telling you.

1344
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:44,400
If you don't do it today, I'll really...

1345
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:48,400
I'll really bring you all the stuff.

1346
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,400
Are you all going to stay here?

1347
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,400
I'm telling you.

1348
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,400
Do you have any place to speak?

1349
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,400
Damn it.

1350
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,400
I'm going to talk to him.

1351
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:00,400
If you're going to come to the front line,

1352
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,400
you can ask me to send you money.

1353
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,400
Damn it.

1354
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,400
If I don't tell you,

1355
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,400
what are you going to tell me?

1356
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,400
What are you going to tell me?

1357
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,400
If you're going to send me money,

1358
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,400
I'm going to send you all the stuff.

1359
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:22,400
Hey, did you hear that?

1360
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,400
It's still...

1361
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:31,400
Hey, hey.

1362
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:34,400
I'm talking nonsense.

1363
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,400
Are you done?

1364
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,400
Okay, I'm done.

1365
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,400
I'm going to take you all the stuff.

1366
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,400
Damn it.

1367
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:42,400
Michael, let's go.

1368
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,400
Hey.

1369
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,400
Open the door.

1370
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,400
I'm not going to sleep.

1371
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,400
I'm not going to sleep.

1372
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,400
Yeah.

1373
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:03,400
You're going to start drinking before you go to bed.

1374
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,400
It's too early.

1375
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:07,400
It used to be early.

1376
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,400
It used to be early.

1377
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,400
It's early now.

1378
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,400
It's always happy to drink.

1379
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,400
What are you talking about?

1380
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,400
Are you crazy?

1381
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,400
No, really.

1382
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,400
I brought some wine.

1383
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,400
He's going to drink some.

1384
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,400
He'll bring the wine to the police.

1385
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:22,400
Listen,

1386
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,400
he's going to report me.

1387
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,400
Hey, don't let him come.

1388
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,400
Yeah.

1389
01:11:37,400 --> 01:12:05,480
Top ten

1390
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:06,480
What's that?

1391
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,480
How many?

1392
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,480
You're all fucking idiots.

1393
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,480
You're so stupid.

1394
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:25,480
You two are really fucking stupid in the monitor.

1395
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:28,480
Three thousand.

1396
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,480
I know.

1397
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,480
You're all fucking idiots.

1398
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:09,480
You're all fucking idiots.

1399
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,480
You're all fucking idiots.

1400
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,480
You're all fucking idiots.

1401
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,480
You're all fucking idiots.

1402
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:17,480
You're all fucking idiots.

1403
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,480
You're all fucking idiots.

1404
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,480
You're all fucking idiots.

1405
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,480
You're all fucking idiots.

1406
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:25,480
You're all fucking idiots.

1407
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,480
You're all fucking idiots.

1408
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,480
You're all fucking idiots.

1409
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,480
You're all fucking idiots.

1410
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:33,480
You're all fucking idiots.

1411
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,480
Alright.

1412
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,480
I tookll of those professors.

1413
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:47,480
You should take a break to rest for a bit.

1414
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,480
I'll go up there later then they'll be my Russianıyoras you.

1415
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:53,480
stuffing your fuck.

1416
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:54,480
Don't come here.

1417
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:55,480
You're not leaving.

1418
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:56,480
Get in.

1419
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:58,480
Qight.

1420
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,480
Take her regardless of his lyrics.

1421
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,480
Let go of me!

1422
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,480
It's nice to have a gun by my neck, right?

1423
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:09,480
What the hell are you doing?

1424
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,480
I'll kill you!

1425
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,480
Damn it!

1426
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,480
Don't come near me!

1427
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,480
If you come near me, I'll kill you!

1428
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,480
I'll kill you!

1429
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:22,480
Let go of me!

1430
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:23,480
Hurry up!

1431
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:24,480
This way!

1432
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,480
Hurry up!

1433
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:26,480

Hurry up!

1438
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,480
Where is Lin Xi?

1439
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,480
Why is she here?

1440
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,480
She's coming here by herself.

1441
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:56,480
We're not the same age.

1442
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,480
What is she doing here?

1443
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,480
Did I ask her to come here?

1444
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:00,480
What is she doing here?

1445
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:01,480
She's here to take a shower.

1446
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:02,480
She's here to take a shower.

1447
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:03,480
Shut up!

1448
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:04,480
Shut up!

1449
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:05,480
Go home!

1450
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:06,480
Okay!

1451
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,480
I'll take care of the rest.

1452
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,480
What's going on now?

1453
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,480
What's going on?

1454
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:12,480
Okay!

1455
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,480
Okay!

1456
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:14,480
Don't you want to take a shower?

1457
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:15,480
Okay!

1458
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:16,480
Don't go!

1459
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:17,480
Don't go!

1460
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:18,480
Don't go!

1461
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:19,480
Don't go!

1462
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:20,480
Don't go!

1463
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,480
You're a man!

1464
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:23,480
Don't you dare to touch my wife!

1465
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:26,480
You're a man!

1466
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:28,480
You're a man!

1467
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:29,480
You're a man!

1468
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:30,480
You're a man!

1469
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:31,480
You're a man!

1470
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:33,480
Have you understood the stuff?

1471
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:36,480
Okay.

1472
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:37,480
Okay.

1473
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:38,480
Quickly.

1474
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:39,480
Just...

1475
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:40,480
Fine!

1476
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:41,480
Just go!

1477
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:42,480
Let's go!

1478
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,480
Go!

1479
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:45,480
Uncle Ang, you're so drama!

1480
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:46,900
Right!

1481
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:48,480
Uncle Ang, wait a second!

1482
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,480
Get up!

1483
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:49,600
Get up!

1484
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,480
Watch your steps!

1485
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,480
Officer합니다

1486
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:53,480
Comrade General!

1487
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:54,480
Hurry up!

1488
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:57,480
Run!

1489
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:58,480
Run, quickly!

1490
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,480
Make sure nothing happened.

1491
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:02,480
Hey, hey,

1492
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,480
can you wait a bit longer?

1493
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,480
Wait a bit longer.

1494
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,480
Wow, what's going on?

1495
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,480
What's going on?

1496
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,480
You should take a rest.

1497
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,480
Are you having fun?

1498
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:25,480
You really want everything?

1499
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,480
Of course.

1500
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,480
I have the ability.

1501
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,480
If you have the ability,

1502
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,480
these flies won't fly in.

1503
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:36,480
I don't need to help you wipe your ass.

1504
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,480
I don't need it.

1505
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,480
Do your best.

1506
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,480
Damn it.

1507
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:53,480
How dare you say that I'm your dad?

1508
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,480
Do you know who Big Head is?

1509
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,480
Big Head is my dad.

1510
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,480
You should make it clear.

1511
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,480
Who the hell is your dad?

1512
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:05,480
Sorry, Michael.

1513
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:07,480
Call my boss.

1514
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,480
Sorry, boss.

1515
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,480
Get the fuck out of here.

1516
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,480
Get me out.

1517
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:31,480
Boss, I want 10 cups of pearl milk tea.

1518
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,480
I want 10 cups of Thai milk tea.

1519
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,480
I'm sorry.

1520
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,480
I'll come early.

1521
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,480
You're here to get beaten up?

1522
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,480
Sorry.

1523
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,480
What are you doing?

1524
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:45,480
I'm beating someone up.

1525
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,480
You're the one who's getting beaten up.

1526
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,480
I'm sorry.

1527
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,480
I'm sorry.

1528
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,480
I'm sorry.

1529
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,480
You're the one who's getting beaten up.

1530
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:01,480
I'm sorry.

1531
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,480
I'm sorry.

1532
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,480
I'm sorry.

1533
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,480
I'm sorry.

1534
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:29,480
What are you doing?

1535
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,480
What are you doing?

1536
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:33,480
Who are you?

1537
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:34,480
Don't touch him.

1538
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,480
Come here.

1539
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,480
Don't touch him.

1540
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:43,480
Don't touch him.

1541
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:59,480
Okay.

1542
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,480
That's enough.

1543
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,480
I'm sorry.

1544
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,480
If you're going to beat someone up,

1545
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,480
you'd better play with me.

1546
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,480
It's a game.

1547
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,480
It's a game.

1548
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,480
You're a loser.

1549
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:57,480
Come on.

1550
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:59,480
Who's the boss?

1551
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:00,480
The boss.

1552
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:01,480
What's he going to do with us?

1553
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,480
He can't beat us.

1554
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:05,480
Just tell me if you have anything to say.

1555
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:06,480
Please.

1556
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:07,480
Just tell me.

1557
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:09,480
Just tell me if you have anything to say.

1558
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:10,480
Okay.

1559
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:11,480
Just go to the toilet.

1560
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,480
See if you have anything to say.

1561
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:14,480
Go.

1562
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:15,480
What's going on?

1563
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:17,480
That's it.

1564
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:27,480
Here.

1565
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:29,480
I put it in your bag.

1566
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:31,480
What?

1567
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:35,480
Did you ask me to take it to the toilet?

1568
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:38,480
Or do you want me to call the police?

1569
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:42,480
No.

1570
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,480
I'm sorry.

1571
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,480
I put it in your bag.

1572
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:51,480
I can't take it.

1573
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,480
I'll give it back to you.

1574
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:58,480
I know you're a fool.

1575
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:03,480
Okay.

1576
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:05,480
I've got a little boy.

1577
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,480
I don't have anything to say.

1578
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,480
Just tell me.

1579
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:12,480
I'll tell you in person.

1580
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,480
Damn it.

1581
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,480
Chow.

1582
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:21,480
Why did you bring so many kids?

1583
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:22,480
Why are you so angry?

1584
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:23,480
I'm a guest.

1585
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:25,480
Guest?

1586
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:27,480
Let's go out first.

1587
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:28,480
Let's go.

1588
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,480
What are we going to do?

1589
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,480
Thank you.

1590
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,480
What?

1591
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,480
You're the only one who can talk to me.

1592
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,480
Why are you so annoying?

1593
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,480
I'm so useless.

1594
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:56,480
Do you have any customers here?

1595
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:08,480
I'm a businessman.

1596
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:12,480
I've seen a lot of people looking for a job.

1597
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:14,480
What are you doing now?

1598
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:17,480
You're making a lot of money.

1599
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,480
No.

1600
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:21,480
I'm not a businessman.

1601
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:24,480
I've been working for two days.

1602
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,480
I know that the problem is that

1603
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:29,480
we don't have the information.

1604
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:32,480
But I don't want to work for a long time.

1605
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:35,480
I just don't want to see people's faces.

1606
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:36,480
Listen to me.

1607
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,480
If you're fired one day,

1608
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,480
we won't see your face.

1609
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:43,480
You can work for me.

1610
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:45,480
I'm sorry.

1611
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:48,480
I'm a little bit rude.

1612
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,480
But if you want to work,

1613
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:54,480
you have to work really hard.

1614
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:02,480
You're still saying that you don't want to talk to me?

1615
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,480
Young man.

1616
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:17,480
I'll tell you how bad you are.

1617
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:20,480
You're always in a bad mood.

1618
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:22,480
If you're fired,

1619
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:25,480
you should think about your job.

1620
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:26,480
If you're fired,

1621
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:28,480
we'll work for you.

1622
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:31,480
You understand what I mean?

1623
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,480
Yes.

1624
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:37,480
Good.

1625
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:39,480
Let's go.

1626
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,480
I'm going.

1627
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:49,480
I'm going.

1628
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:19,480
I'm going.

1629
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,480
Good shot.

1630
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:59,480
Brother Meng.

1631
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:07,480
We're missing one person.

1632
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:09,480
Let's play.

1633
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,480
Brother Tian.

1634
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:14,480
I know that we have some misunderstandings.

1635
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:19,480
I brought two cups of tea to help you.

1636
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:28,480
You're here to tell me something?

1637
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:41,480
Sorry.

1638
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,480
Guys.

1639
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,480
Thank you.

1640
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:50,480
So many people brought two cups of drinks to help us.

1641
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:53,480
You're so cute.

1642
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,480
You took the money.

1643
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:01,480
We're not good at it.

1644
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:04,480
That's it.

1645
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:09,480
How do you know I took the money?

1646
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:16,480
We're just dogs in your eyes.

1647
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:23,480
We'll disappear.

1648
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:26,480
I hope you'll kneel down.

1649
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:29,480
Kneel down.

1650
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:33,480
We don't have any deep hatred.

1651
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:43,480
Let's go.

1652
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:45,480
Let's go.

1653
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:47,480
Let's go.

1654
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:49,480
Let's go.

1655
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,480
People like us who are older

1656
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:15,480
are worried about others.

1657
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:20,480
It's not easy.

1658
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:27,480
It's okay.

1659
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:29,480
Thank you.

1660
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:34,480
You called me Brother Scorpion.

1661
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:37,480
I'm happy.

1662
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:41,480
Can you make me happy again?

1663
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:44,480
Brother Scorpion.

1664
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:50,480
It's okay.

1665
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:10,480
The drink shop...

1666
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:13,480
It's not okay.

1667
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:21,480
I want to go inside by myself tomorrow.

1668
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,480
I'm fine.

1669
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:39,480
Never mind.

1670
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:45,480
Where did they get the money?

1671
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:47,120
Come back!

1672
01:28:59,240 --> 01:28:59,940
What are you two doing?

1673
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:01,980
His army is faulty.

1674
01:29:02,860 --> 01:29:04,700
Everybody went running over.

1675
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:05,900
Now right!

1676
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:17,840
Gui Mu, stay calm.

1677
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:34,480
Gui Mu!

1678
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:37,680
You're really good at fighting.

1679
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:44,120
I just wonder if your dude in the bar

1680
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:49,040
Gee, that's a teasers過後的臙

1681
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:51,300
awful

1682
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,480
Google pretends to be a 9

1683
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:57,960
real

1684
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:02,820
Tsa you

1685
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:09,700
哥 1942

1686
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:11,720
code

1687
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,300
Xian

1688
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:16,240
Now is the time, do it right

1689
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:36,700
Honestly

1690
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:39,120
Brother

1691
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:44,300
Come on.

1692
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:53,300
We've been working hard.

1693
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:55,300
One by one, we'll get it back.

1694
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:12,300
They've already found a job.

1695
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,300
What if they do it sooner?

1696
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:44,300
You're sick!

1697
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:47,300
What are you doing?

1698
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:50,300
You should lie down!

1699
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:53,300
You're sick!

1700
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:56,300
You're sick!

1701
01:31:57,300 --> 01:31:59,300
You're sick!

1702
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:02,300
You're sick!

1703
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:05,300
You're sick!

1704
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:08,300
You're sick!

1705
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:11,300
You're sick!

1706
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:14,300
You're sick!

1707
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:18,300
Why are you pushing me?

1708
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:20,300
Don't go!

1709
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:23,300
You're sick!

1710
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:45,300
What's wrong with us?

1711
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:48,300
We don't dare to put up a fight.

1712
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:51,300
We've been through it once.

1713
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:54,300
If you know it...

1714
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:56,300
A phone call

1715
01:32:57,300 --> 01:32:59,300
with a real phone.

1716
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:01,300
We can't give up.

1717
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:03,300
We're useless.

1718
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:05,300
How can we back down?

1719
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:07,300
We're useless.

1720
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:09,300
What's wrong with you?

1721
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:20,300
Go and have a drink.

1722
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:24,300
Are you going out with your girl?

1723
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:26,300
Yes.

1724
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:29,300
What's wrong with you?

1725
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:49,180
Many days passed that gave birth to this

1726
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:57,140
But even for lay tough nights

1727
01:33:57,180 --> 01:34:01,180
Yet in the Picture倉

1728
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:02,780
There are friends I still love

1729
01:34:03,620 --> 01:34:05,860
Many years passed that didn't last

1730
01:34:05,860 --> 01:34:09,100
our unity will always be one.

1731
01:35:05,860 --> 01:35:09,160
Answer me, 真丢 item.

1732
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:13,800
Who made you get this?

1733
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,440
Ding Zhuang, Apply cosmetics nucleic acid Biden?

1734
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:18,480
Tell me,  push them away!

1735
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:22,860
What the fuck happened?!

1736
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:25,100
It's nothing.

1737
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:27,600
Yet your government said it's nothing,

1738
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,480
after I keep putting you in theLOLs forbs.

1739
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:34,380
You wanna know how many people are watching us now?

1740
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:35,380
You're a fucking idiot!

1741
01:35:35,380 --> 01:35:36,380
You must have been in trouble!

1742
01:35:36,380 --> 01:35:37,380
Tell me!

1743
01:35:37,380 --> 01:35:38,380
Bro!

1744
01:35:42,380 --> 01:35:44,380
Bro, you fucking died.

1745
01:35:44,380 --> 01:35:46,380
What the fuck did you say?

1746
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:50,380
Who died?

1747
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:54,380
Who fucking died?

1748
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:57,380
Tell me, who fucking died?

1749
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:05,380
I don't know.

1750
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:11,020
Oh bigiar Gonzales

1751
01:36:11,020 --> 01:36:12,520
I...

1752
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:35,560
Do you understand what's important now?

1753
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:37,600
Is the money to school?

1754
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,600
I hope you can help us

1755
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:41,600
I hope you can help us

1756
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:43,600
I know

1757
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,600
If you want to help us

1758
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,600
You can go now

1759
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:49,600
Go

1760
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:51,600
Go

1761
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,600
Go

1762
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,600
Go

1763
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:57,600
Go

1764
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,600
Go

1765
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,600
Go

1766
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,600
I'm A-Mong, please call me

1767
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,600
I grew up together with Yi-Wei-Ming

1768
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,600
Please listen to me

1769
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:13,600
My brother is a really good big brother

1770
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:15,600
He has been doing everything for me since he was a kid

1771
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,600
He doesn't even read books

1772
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,600
He just wants to make money

1773
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:21,600
To take care of me

1774
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,600
He is like a family

1775
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:27,600
My brother can do anything for his family

1776
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,600
He can do anything for his family

1777
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,600
He is not afraid of anything

1778
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,600
Even if he is arrested

1779
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:35,600
He doesn't care about the police

1780
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,600
This time he came out

1781
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,600
I thought we could work together

1782
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:43,600
I thought we could work together

1783
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,600
We bought a house together

1784
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,600
We lived together

1785
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,600
I don't know what I'm doing

1786
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:51,600
I'm too willful

1787
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:53,600
I keep fighting with him

1788
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:57,600
We had a meal together

1789
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,600
We had a meal together

1790
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:01,600
We didn't even have a word to say

1791
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,600
We didn't even have a word to say

1792
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,600
He lost his life to protect me

1793
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:09,600
He lost his life to protect me

1794
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:11,600
I was so angry

1795
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:15,600
I'm useless

1796
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,600
I don't even have the ability to revenge

1797
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:21,600
Just give me a chance

1798
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,600
I will try my best to learn

1799
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,600
I can do anything

1800
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:31,600
I can do anything for you

1801
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:33,600
I can do anything for you

1802
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:37,600
I'm begging you

1803
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,600
I'm a son

1804
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:51,600
I'm a son

1805
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:53,600
I'm a son

1806
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:55,600
I'm a son

1807
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:57,600
I'm a son

1808
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:59,600
You have to protect Saka

1809
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:01,600
You have to protect Saka

1810
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:03,600
I'm your son

1811
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:05,600
I'm your son

1812
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,600
I'm your son

1813
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:11,600
I really don't have a son

1814
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,600
Dad

1815
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,600
Dad

1816
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:35,600
I hope you can

1817
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:37,600
I hope you can get to know the two of us

1818
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,600
They are my best friends

1819
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,600
Fine

1820
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:45,600
I told you

1821
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:47,600
If things are finished

1822
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:49,600
We'll come back to you

1823
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:51,600
If you can

1824
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:53,600
I'll help you two

1825
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:55,600
Remember

1826
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,600
Okay

1827
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:27,600
Okay

1828
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,600
Dad

1829
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,600
Cancel out

1830
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:45,600
Hey, Report

1831
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:48,420
Not at Confruits

1832
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:50,420
but at Hotel

1833
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:52,420
When is this going to stop?

1834
01:40:52,420 --> 01:40:54,260
You're kidding me

1835
01:40:54,260 --> 01:40:56,260
I'm sorry.

1836
01:41:03,260 --> 01:41:05,260
You're so annoying!

1837
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:08,260
You want to hear it?

1838
01:41:18,260 --> 01:41:19,260
What are you doing?

1839
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:21,260
I'm telling you, you're my best friend.

1840
01:41:21,260 --> 01:41:22,260
What are you talking about?

1841
01:41:22,260 --> 01:41:24,260
You're so annoying!

1842
01:41:24,260 --> 01:41:26,260
I'll beat you up!

1843
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:28,260
I'll see you go to jail!

1844
01:41:30,260 --> 01:41:32,260
Gong Chun!

1845
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:34,260
Why did you bring so many dogs?

1846
01:41:34,260 --> 01:41:36,260
You want to scare me?

1847
01:41:36,260 --> 01:41:38,260
You're a coward!

1848
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:40,260
You're a coward!

1849
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:42,260
You're a coward!

1850
01:41:52,260 --> 01:41:54,260
Get out of my way!

1851
01:41:57,260 --> 01:41:59,260
Boss!

1852
01:41:59,260 --> 01:42:01,260
You're all the same!

1853
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:03,260
You're all the same!

1854
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:06,260
Stop it!

1855
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:08,260
You're going to get it!

1856
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:15,260
Sir!

1857
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:17,260
Get everyone fucking ready!

1858
01:42:17,260 --> 01:42:19,260
I want to fucking kill someone!

1859
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:21,260
You want to kill me?

1860
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:25,260
Come on.

1861
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:27,260
Just remember this.

1862
01:42:27,260 --> 01:42:29,260
Go see Gong Chun and don't tell her.

1863
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:39,260
I was told that you were badly beaten by Beijing.

1864
01:42:39,260 --> 01:42:40,260
Fuck!

1865
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:42,260
Can Gong Chun beat me?

1866
01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:44,260
You're a fucking bastard!

1867
01:42:44,260 --> 01:42:46,260
I'll kill him!

1868
01:42:48,260 --> 01:42:50,260
I must get this girl back.

1869
01:42:51,260 --> 01:42:53,260
Don't make me go to the hospital to see you.

1870
01:42:54,260 --> 01:42:56,260
Xi Yan.

1871
01:42:56,260 --> 01:42:58,260
Look at me as I grow up.

1872
01:42:58,260 --> 01:43:00,260
You know that...

1873
01:43:00,260 --> 01:43:02,260
I'll get everything back.

1874
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:05,260
I'll call the doctor if you need help.

1875
01:43:06,260 --> 01:43:08,260
Take care of yourself.

1876
01:43:15,260 --> 01:43:17,260
Go help Michael.

1877
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:19,260
Get him a syringe.

1878
01:43:21,260 --> 01:43:23,260
Does Michael know that you're going to help him?

1879
01:43:23,260 --> 01:43:26,260
This kind of little thing doesn't need to be done by anyone.

1880
01:43:27,260 --> 01:43:29,260
Don't make a fool of yourself.

1881
01:43:30,260 --> 01:43:32,260
It's true, Boss.

1882
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:40,260
If you keep doing this, you won't get a letter from me.

1883
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:42,260
Go get it from someone.

1884
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:45,260
If you say so, I'll go find it.

1885
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:48,260
Hey, you're not going to tell me?

1886
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:50,260
You're not going to beat me?

1887
01:43:50,260 --> 01:43:52,260
I'm going to perform.

1888
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:55,260
From the beginning of the road,

1889
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:57,260
I've been walking in the empty road.

1890
01:43:57,260 --> 01:43:59,260
Oh, shit!

1891
01:43:59,260 --> 01:44:01,260
I've been walking for three months.

1892
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:03,260
I've been walking for three months.

1893
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:05,260
You're a bastard!

1894
01:44:05,260 --> 01:44:07,260
People will think you're a murderer.

1895
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:09,260
People will think you're a murderer.

1896
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:12,260
I'll beat him in the face.

1897
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:17,260
Michael is a real bastard.

1898
01:44:17,260 --> 01:44:19,260
He's a bastard.

1899
01:44:20,260 --> 01:44:22,260
I'll call him here.

1900
01:44:22,260 --> 01:44:24,260
You're a bastard.

1901
01:44:24,260 --> 01:44:26,260
I'll beat him.

1902
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:28,260
You're a bastard.

1903
01:44:36,260 --> 01:44:38,260
At this time,

1904
01:44:38,260 --> 01:44:40,260
at this time,

1905
01:44:46,260 --> 01:44:48,260
I'll beat him.

1906
01:45:11,260 --> 01:45:13,260
But don't be afraid.

1907
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:15,260
If Michael were to do this,

1908
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:17,260
I'd be embarrassed.

1909
01:45:19,260 --> 01:45:21,260
A little bastard.

1910
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:27,260
I'll beat you.

1911
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:29,260
I'll beat you.

1912
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:35,260
I'll beat you.

1913
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:37,260
I'll beat you.

1914
01:45:43,260 --> 01:45:45,260
You're a fucking pussy.

1915
01:45:45,260 --> 01:45:47,260
Get over here.

1916
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:56,260
Ima, you stick on there.

1917
01:45:56,260 --> 01:45:58,260
What the fuck is this?

1918
01:46:05,260 --> 01:46:07,260
Get over here.

1919
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:09,260
Get over here.

1920
01:46:09,260 --> 01:46:11,260
Get over here.

1921
01:46:11,260 --> 01:46:13,260
Get over here.

1922
01:46:17,260 --> 01:46:19,260
Don't move.

1923
01:46:20,260 --> 01:46:22,260
I'm gonna kill you.

1924
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:24,260
Come here.

1925
01:46:24,260 --> 01:46:26,260
I'll give you a piece of shit.

1926
01:46:26,260 --> 01:46:28,260
Come here.

1927
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:40,260
You're a fucking pussy.

1928
01:46:41,260 --> 01:46:44,260
What are you doing?

1929
01:46:44,260 --> 01:46:46,260
Sorry, I'm late.

1930
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:54,260
Let go of me!

1931
01:46:59,260 --> 01:47:02,260
I'll kill you!

1932
01:47:11,260 --> 01:47:14,260
What are you doing?

1933
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:17,260
I'm not going to let you go!

1934
01:47:17,260 --> 01:47:19,260
I'm not going to let you go!

1935
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:21,260
I'm not going to let you go!

1936
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:27,260
You bitch!

1937
01:47:27,260 --> 01:47:29,260
Motherfucker!

You bitch!

1939
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:33,260
You bitch!

1940
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:39,260
You bitch!

1941
01:47:41,260 --> 01:47:43,260
You bitch!

1942
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:45,260
You bitch!

01:48:01,260 --> 01:48:03,260
Where are you guys?

Hurry up!

1945
01:48:07,260 --> 01:48:08,260
I'll take you to the police station.

1946
01:48:08,260 --> 01:48:09,260
You can beat yourself up.

1947
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:11,260
Hurry up!

1948
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:21,260
You bitch!

1949
01:48:21,260 --> 01:48:23,260
You bitch!

1950
01:48:25,260 --> 01:48:27,260
You bitch!

1951
01:48:33,260 --> 01:48:35,260
What do you want?

1952
01:48:35,260 --> 01:48:37,260
You bitch!

1953
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:39,260
You bitch!

1954
01:48:39,260 --> 01:48:41,260
Who are you?

1955
01:48:41,260 --> 01:48:43,260
You bitch!

1956
01:49:08,260 --> 01:49:10,260
I'll kill you!

1957
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:12,260
What are you doing?

1958
01:49:14,260 --> 01:49:16,260
You bitch!

1959
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:18,260

01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:22,260
You bitch!

1962
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:24,260
I'll kill you!

1963
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:26,260
You bitch!

1964
01:49:26,260 --> 01:49:28,260
You bitch!

1965
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:39,260
Come on, come on, come on.

1966
01:49:39,260 --> 01:49:41,260
Come on, come on, come on.

1967
01:49:41,260 --> 01:49:43,260
Come on, come on, come on.

1968
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:45,260
Hey, what's going on?

1969
01:49:45,260 --> 01:49:47,260
Don't be afraid. Come on.

1970
01:49:47,260 --> 01:49:49,260
I'll get you.

1971
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:55,260
Come on.

1972
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:57,260
Come on.

1973
01:49:57,260 --> 01:49:59,260
You're dead.

1974
01:49:59,260 --> 01:50:01,260
Come on.

1975
01:50:01,260 --> 01:50:03,260
Come on.

1976
01:50:03,260 --> 01:50:05,260
Come on.

1977
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:07,260
Come on.

1978
01:50:15,260 --> 01:50:17,260
Damn it.

1979
01:50:21,260 --> 01:50:23,260
You're not eating?

1980
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:25,260
Yeah.

1981
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:27,260
Go.

1982
01:50:29,260 --> 01:50:31,260
Hurry up.

1983
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:33,260
Go.

1984
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:37,260
Hurry up.

1985
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:39,260
Michael, you're not eating?

1986
01:50:39,260 --> 01:50:41,260
You're afraid?

1987
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:43,260
Come on.

1988
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:45,260
You're going to die.

1989
01:51:01,260 --> 01:51:03,260
You went to the police station to catch the girl?

1990
01:51:03,260 --> 01:51:05,260
You went to the police station to catch the girl?

1991
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:07,260
I just caught her that day.

1992
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:09,260
Fuck.

1993
01:51:09,260 --> 01:51:11,260
Get up.

1994
01:51:11,260 --> 01:51:13,260
I'll get you.

1995
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:15,260
I told you five times.

1996
01:51:15,260 --> 01:51:17,260
Don't let us back.

1997
01:51:17,260 --> 01:51:19,260
Don't say you won't get a chance.

1998
01:51:19,260 --> 01:51:21,260
Do you have anything to say to me?

1999
01:51:21,260 --> 01:51:23,260
I'm not your brother.

2000
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:25,260
Fuck.

2001
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:27,260
You're so stupid.

2002
01:51:27,260 --> 01:51:29,260
Stupid.

2003
01:51:29,260 --> 01:51:31,260
Stupid.

2004
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:33,260
Stupid.

2005
01:51:33,260 --> 01:51:35,260
Stupid.

2006
01:51:35,260 --> 01:51:37,260
You.

2007
01:51:37,260 --> 01:51:39,260
You're so stupid.

2008
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:41,260
You're so stupid.

2009
01:51:41,260 --> 01:51:43,260
You're so stupid.

2010
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:45,260
I'm going to take you to the police station.

2011
01:51:45,260 --> 01:51:47,260
I'm going to take you to the police station.

2012
01:51:47,260 --> 01:51:49,260
Go.

2013
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:51,260
Fuck.

2014
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:55,260
Fuck.

2015
01:51:55,260 --> 01:51:57,260
I'm going to get a new girl.

2016
01:51:57,260 --> 01:51:59,260
I'm going to get a new girl.

2017
01:51:59,260 --> 01:52:01,260
Fuck.

2018
01:52:03,260 --> 01:52:05,260
Fuck.

2019
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:07,260
Don't.

2020
01:52:07,260 --> 01:52:09,260
You're the one who's going to get a new girl.

2021
01:52:11,260 --> 01:52:13,260
You're so stupid.

2022
01:52:13,260 --> 01:52:15,260
You don't even want to die.

2023
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:19,260
Gui-cheng.

2024
01:52:19,260 --> 01:52:21,260
I'm joking.

2025
01:52:23,260 --> 01:52:25,260
It's Long Chun who's messing with me.

2026
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:27,260
I'm going to get her back.

2027
01:52:27,260 --> 01:52:29,260
I'm going to get her back.

2028
01:52:29,260 --> 01:52:31,260
Why don't you let me get her back?

2029
01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:33,260
Why don't you let me get her back?

2030
01:52:33,260 --> 01:52:35,260
Fuck.

2031
01:52:35,260 --> 01:52:37,260
You're so stupid.

2032
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:39,260
If it wasn't for you,

2033
01:52:39,260 --> 01:52:41,260
you wouldn't have been in this situation.

2034
01:52:41,260 --> 01:52:43,260
You're really stupid.

2035
01:52:43,260 --> 01:52:45,260
Michael.

2036
01:52:45,260 --> 01:52:47,260
You're so stupid.

2037
01:52:47,260 --> 01:52:49,260
How can I help you?

2038
01:52:49,260 --> 01:52:51,260
You don't understand the situation.

2039
01:52:51,260 --> 01:52:53,260
You don't understand the situation.

2040
01:52:53,260 --> 01:52:55,260
Long Chun is messing with me.

2041
01:52:55,260 --> 01:52:57,260
Fuck.

2042
01:52:57,260 --> 01:52:59,260
Fuck.

2043
01:52:59,260 --> 01:53:01,260
Fuck.

2044
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:03,260
I'm going to get a new girl.

2045
01:53:03,260 --> 01:53:05,260
I'm going to get a new girl.

2046
01:53:05,260 --> 01:53:07,260
Gui-cheng.

2047
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:09,260
He's messing with my dad.

2048
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:11,260
He's messing with you.

2049
01:53:11,260 --> 01:53:13,260
Fuck.

2050
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:15,260
What are you talking about?

2051
01:53:15,260 --> 01:53:17,260
You're crazy.

2052
01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:19,260
You're messing with me.

2053
01:53:19,260 --> 01:53:21,260
I'm doing this for you.

2054
01:53:21,260 --> 01:53:23,260
What?

2055
01:53:23,260 --> 01:53:25,260
I understand.

2056
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:27,260
You're messing with me.

2057
01:53:27,260 --> 01:53:29,260
You're messing with me.

2058
01:53:29,260 --> 01:53:31,260
Fine.

2059
01:53:31,260 --> 01:53:33,260
I'm messing with you.

2060
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:35,260
Come on.

2061
01:53:35,260 --> 01:53:37,260
I'm going to get you.

2062
01:53:43,260 --> 01:53:45,260
Why did you do this?

2063
01:53:45,260 --> 01:53:47,260
Fuck.

2064
01:53:47,260 --> 01:53:49,260
Fuck you.

2065
01:53:51,260 --> 01:53:53,260
Fuck you.

2066
01:53:53,260 --> 01:53:55,260
Fuck.

2067
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:57,260
Fuck you.

2068
01:53:57,260 --> 01:53:59,260
Fuck.

2069
01:53:59,260 --> 01:54:01,260
Fuck.

2070
01:54:01,260 --> 01:54:03,260
You're a bitch.

2071
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:05,260
Fuck.

2072
01:54:05,260 --> 01:54:07,260
Fuck.

2073
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:09,260
Fuck.
