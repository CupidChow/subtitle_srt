1
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:04,179
(The 1-on-1 Class Battle finally began.)

2
00:00:06,249 --> 00:00:07,888
(With the harmony of PLANET K and C, )

3
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:09,918
(the participants had successful first performances.)

4
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:12,259
(And tonight)

5
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:17,058
(The pitch falters.)

6
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:20,528
(The formation gets messed up.)

7
00:00:20,529 --> 00:00:24,228
(The teamwork becomes shaky.)

8
00:00:24,229 --> 00:00:26,768
(Nevertheless, there's no giving up.)

9
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:29,138
(I think this is my last chance.)

10
00:00:29,139 --> 00:00:30,239
(I want to survive.)

11
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,539
(A fierce competition for survival and the pride of the class!)

12
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:37,509
(A series of eye-catching performances)

13
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:41,318
(The center of attention, )

14
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:42,789
("Whiplash" Team 1's performance finally began.)

15
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:45,118
(What will be the result for the "Whiplash" teams' match?)

16
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,089
("Whiplash" by aespa, Team 1 versus Team 2)

17
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:50,889
(The result that surprised everyone will be revealed soon!)

18
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,099
Hey! Come on!

19
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:57,698
- Chun Bae is here. - Hello.

20
00:00:57,699 --> 00:00:58,969
(Woof! Hello, my name is Chun Bae.)

21
00:00:59,169 --> 00:01:00,239
Chun Bae.

22
00:01:00,569 --> 00:01:04,608
(I'm a dog that watches over Planet Camp.)

23
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:06,378
(Although I can't talk, )

24
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:08,048
(I know everything that's going on.)

25
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:09,878
(When my friends are in a good mood, )

26
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:11,718
(the sound of their footsteps shows their excitement!)

27
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:15,288
(When they're upset, I can tell by the sound of their breaths.)

28
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:17,349
(I sense the mood with my ears. My ears are like a radar!)

29
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:22,658
(Here's the thing.)

30
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:26,599
(Do you know what's fascinating about these boys?)

31
00:01:26,929 --> 00:01:30,398
(Although they practice every day until they get exhausted, )

32
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:33,399
(their eyes always sparkle like stars!)

33
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:39,879
(At times, they get tired.)

34
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:45,749
(They're deep in thought.)

35
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:49,948
(On such days, I approach them...)

36
00:01:49,949 --> 00:01:52,258
(and take a bite of the snack from them.)

37
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,058
(I console them in my own way!)

38
00:01:55,059 --> 00:01:57,558
(What? I didn't allow a hug!)

39
00:01:57,559 --> 00:01:59,729
Chun Bae gives me a therapeutic moment.

40
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:04,739
(When I watch them, )

41
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:10,038
(they cheer each other up...)

42
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,339
(and share friendship.)

43
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:20,879
(They laugh together.)

44
00:02:21,249 --> 00:02:22,549
- Good luck. - Okay.

45
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:24,188
- Good luck. - Okay.

46
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:26,118
(These are the boys who run toward the same dream!)

47
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:27,828
(Please remember this moment in their lives!)

48
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,159
- Let's go, "S-Class!" - Let's go, "S-Class!"

49
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:31,299
- Let's go! - Let's go!

50
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:32,898
- "Plot Twist!" - "Plot Twist!"

51
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:34,769
(Soon, the moment when they are the brightest will come.)

52
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:39,769
(I'll root for them as well!)

53
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:43,809
Star Creators around the world,

54
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:45,609
the second global voting...

55
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:49,879
of BOYS II PLANET that'll determine the boys' fate is taking place.

56
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:52,919
You can participate in the second global voting...

57
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:55,549
of BOYS II PLANET once a day...

58
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:57,859
on the official platform, Mnet Plus.

59
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:00,959
Enter the BOYS II PLANET page.

60
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:02,388
(Participate in the 2nd global voting!)

61
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:03,629
Click on the "Vote" button.

62
00:03:05,029 --> 00:03:07,359
Select a total of eight participants.

63
00:03:08,369 --> 00:03:10,999
Once you click "Submit Vote" at the bottom,

64
00:03:11,339 --> 00:03:14,839
you'll receive a voting certificate to confirm that you've voted.

65
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,139
Fifty percent of the voting result will reflect votes from Korea,

66
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,578
and the other 50 from the rest of the world.

67
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:25,379
The accumulated number of votes will be converted into scores.

68
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:27,949
The second global voting on BOYS II PLANET will end...

69
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:30,548
tomorrow at 10am.

70
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:33,519
(The 2nd global voting ends tomorrow at 10am.)

71
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:36,989
Among the surviving participants based on the voting,

72
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:39,829
the last one standing at the bottom...

73
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:41,469
will be announced tomorrow at 3pm...

74
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:44,869
during the First Survivor Announcement live streaming.

75
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,309
He will be determined by the Last Survivor Live Voting.

76
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:50,438
Star Creators around the world.

77
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,339
Vote for the boys who will set your heart on fire.

78
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,048
(Episode 4: In the Dark Times)

79
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:04,118
("Rising Sun")

80
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,918
They're preparing for the next performance in 1-on-1 Class Battle.

81
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:09,289
"Plot Twist" Team Two.

82
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:11,398
(In the midst of enthusiastic cheers of Star Creators)

83
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:13,829
(Team 2's performance is coming up.)

84
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:16,169
You can do it.

85
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:18,639
Come on up to the stage.

86
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:23,508
Let's do as we practiced without leaving regrets.

87
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:24,509
- Okay. - Okay.

88
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:27,948
Five, six, seven.

89
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:31,048
One, two, three, four.

90
00:04:31,049 --> 00:04:32,578
Seven, eight.

91
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:33,879
You can do it

92
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:36,749
It feels so good

93
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:39,859
Leader, can I use the restroom?

94
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:40,959
Sure.

95
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:44,189
Please concentrate a little more.

96
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:46,728
- Is everyone here? - No, Yi Chen isn't here.

97
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:47,799
Oh, my gosh.

98
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:52,839
(Yi Chen returns to the practice room late.)

99
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,268
Let's do it again.

100
00:04:55,269 --> 00:04:56,638
Can we go once from the top?

101
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,879
I forgot the choreography.

102
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:00,709
Let me get some water.

103
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:04,179
(While Jun Lee Jeong is drinking water)

104
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:08,048
(Yi Chen leaves the practice room again.)

105
00:05:08,049 --> 00:05:10,049
All right, five of you over there.

106
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:12,059
Yi Chen isn't back yet.

107
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:15,989
Yi Chen... Where does he keep disappearing to?

108
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:17,629
Why isn't Yi Chen here?

109
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:18,899
Where is Yi Chen?

110
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:22,998
Honestly, Yi Chen disappeared seven times.

111
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:25,638
This is what I said the most today. "Have you seen Yi Chen?"

112
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,369
"Where did Yi Chen go?"

113
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:29,539
I started getting angry then.

114
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:32,478
Okay, get ready. Which team wants to go first?

115
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,809
Who wants to go first?

116
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:38,318
- We'll go first. - Okay.

117
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,618
Okay.

118
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:40,818
(1 Star Jun Lee Jeong of Team 2 raised his hand first.)

119
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:42,148
(Let's go first.)

120
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:43,388
You're the 1st 1 Star team to go 1st.

121
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:44,659
Good luck. You all can do it.

122
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,188
Do we have to sing first?

123
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:49,789
- We have to sing live. - Live?

124
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:53,429
But I can't sing live.

125
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:58,869
I definitely told him to memorize the lyrics.

126
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:01,869
Tell him to memorize the lyrics back in the dormitory.

127
00:06:02,739 --> 00:06:04,138
I don't have to memorize the lyrics.

128
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,938
You have to memorize the lyrics, no matter what.

129
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:07,538
- I'll just read them. - You must memorize the lyrics.

130
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:08,948
You have to memorize them.

131
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:13,119
You'll be scolded if you can't lip-sync while dancing.

132
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:15,249
There was tension in the air.

133
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:19,059
(How will Team 2's interim check turn out?)

134
00:06:23,489 --> 00:06:28,069
(Yi Chen dances with a different tempo from the start.)

135
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,439
(Leader Jun Lee Jeong sings his part smoothly.)

136
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,879
(Other team members are singing live smoothly.)

137
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:44,348
(The plan is perfect)

138
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:45,418
(Yi Chen makes a mistake on the lyrics.)

139
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:48,119
(I can't wait to talk to you)

140
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:57,129
(Yi Chen dances differently from the others until the end.)

141
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:06,469
("Plot Twist" Team 2's interim check is over.)

142
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:08,069
Does Yi Chen sing the killing part?

143
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:10,039
- Yes. - Yes.

144
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:12,579
Are you okay with it?

145
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:14,809
What do we do about this?

146
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:22,119
Your facial expressions don't look natural.

147
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:24,888
Your face doesn't seem to match your body.

148
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:26,519
Please pay more attention to it.

149
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,859
They're in trouble.

150
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:33,359
Will Yi Chen be able to defeat Hyun Jun?

151
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,899
Hyun Jun sings the killing part perfectly.

152
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:41,609
Yi Chen's killing part...

153
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:44,609
can't possibly defeat Hyun Jun's team.

154
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:46,878
(In the practice room after the interim check)

155
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,949
(A discussion on the interim check led by Jun Lee Jeong)

156
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:57,789
I'm thinking of changing the person who sings the killing part.

157
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,088
What's wrong is wrong.

158
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:04,629
I thought that I should be clear with them.

159
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:10,069
What's going on here? Something is wrong.

160
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:13,269
Based on what I see during practice,

161
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:15,939
I believe that Li Yu is doing a good job.

162
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:20,009
It'd be nice if Li Yu sang the killing part.

163
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:22,309
Okay.

164
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:24,109
It's a little disappointing.

165
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:26,449
Everyone.

166
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,349
- Let's change our formation. - Okay.

167
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:32,389
Where did Yi Chen go again?

168
00:08:34,489 --> 00:08:35,589
Where's Yi Chen?

169
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:38,399
(Looking around)

170
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:44,669
(Yi Chen is nowhere to be found in the practice room.)

171
00:08:44,869 --> 00:08:47,239
We have to hurry and change the formation.

172
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:51,209
Everyone, let's just get together now.

173
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:54,579
Don't we need Yi Chen for this?

174
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,508
- We'll just... - Yi Chen's part has changed.

175
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:58,748
- But... - We can just move him.

176
00:08:58,749 --> 00:08:59,949
Let's practice even if it's just us.

177
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:02,819
We can't change the formation without him.

178
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,918
Yi Chen kept disappearing.

179
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,859
We couldn't practice the new formation.

180
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:09,529
Let's do what we can so that we don't waste time.

181
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:12,298
Yi Chen... Give me a moment. Can you stand in line?

182
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:14,829
Hello, have you seen Yi Chen?

183
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:17,029
- Where did he go? - He disappeared.

184
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,539
I can't control Yi Chen.

185
00:09:20,869 --> 00:09:22,939
Why isn't he here when everyone else is?

186
00:09:23,369 --> 00:09:24,879
Only Yi Chen is missing.

187
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:28,248
(Team 2 has no choice but to practice individually.)

188
00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:29,378
As he kept disappearing,

189
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:31,478
we couldn't practice together as a team.

190
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:34,349
We couldn't advance because of him.

191
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,789
Yi Chen, you really have to memorize the choreography.

192
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:48,099
You must memorize it now.

193
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:50,929
(During the dance training a moment ago)

194
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,899
(Yi Chen couldn't keep up with the choreography.)

195
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:59,739
(He also made a mistake while joining the group.)

196
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:05,819
(Yi Chen didn't know his part either.)

197
00:10:07,849 --> 00:10:10,719
- Yi Chen. - Yes?

198
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:14,259
Your singing part didn't change, did it?

199
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:16,958
Yi Chen's part didn't change.

200
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,129
Right.

201
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:19,998
Isn't it his original part?

202
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:21,058
(Before singing the killing part, he was the 3rd sub-vocalist.)

203
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:22,469
Throughout the training,

204
00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:27,039
you never sang the correct lyrics.

205
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:30,839
I couldn't understand him.

206
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:35,249
You didn't get any of the lyrics right.

207
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:38,579
I don't think you listened to the song yesterday.

208
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,848
I couldn't find the right pitch.

209
00:10:39,849 --> 00:10:41,849
I can understand if you're off-key.

210
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:50,089
Your performance keeps affecting us.

211
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:54,658
Let's work on the parts that we're struggling with individually.

212
00:10:54,659 --> 00:11:01,099
Here's what I think. Why don't we set goals?

213
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:05,708
Here's what should be done before going home today.

214
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:07,278
We have such goals.

215
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,718
We need to have goals every day.

216
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:12,719
Otherwise...

217
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:16,519
There will be goals every day, but you must follow my direction.

218
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:19,789
Okay? You haven't memorized the lyrics yet.

219
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:22,388
Let's see how much we memorized...

220
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:24,188
Let's say that someone hasn't memorized them.

221
00:11:24,189 --> 00:11:26,899
We're a team.

222
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:30,798
If one of us can't do something, we should change the formation...

223
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,799
and try again.

224
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,138
Once he can do it, we can move on to the next step.

225
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:37,139
I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean.

226
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:46,648
There's a practice method that I have in mind.

227
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:48,148
I have plans too.

228
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:49,819
Please try to follow them.

229
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,629
(Soon, the night arrives.)

230
00:11:57,329 --> 00:11:59,928
(Sighing)

231
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:03,629
I chose my members after careful consideration.

232
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:06,369
(While selecting his teammates)

233
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:13,509
(Jun Lee Jeong picked his teammates according to his plan.)

234
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:15,579
If this team loses,

235
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:18,049
I'd be responsible too.

236
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:21,849
(Jun Lee Jeong goes to Yi Chen's room late at night.)

237
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:23,389
Here's what I want to say.

238
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:26,419
You're the only one from PLANET C on our team.

239
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:30,588
You're probably working hard to fit in here.

240
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:33,859
I might have been too hard on you.

241
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,999
It's been bothering me.

242
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:39,598
To be honest, I feel sorry too.

243
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:40,799
I haven't been helpful.

244
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:45,279
I picked the team members myself. If this team loses,

245
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:50,009
the members could get eliminated because of me.

246
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:52,479
That's what I've been thinking these days.

247
00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:55,218
You're very kind.

248
00:12:55,219 --> 00:12:57,789
This thought is too heavy to handle.

249
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:01,119
If they didn't team up with me, they could've won.

250
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:03,158
With my team members,

251
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:06,259
I should do my best to make something of good quality.

252
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:10,029
(Morning comes after the night passed.)

253
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:11,129
Let's just do it.

254
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,438
(Jun Lee Jeong and Chuei Li Yu are practicing alone.)

255
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:13,999
Shall we push it a bit more?

256
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:17,609
(Chuei Li Yu dances to the count of Jun Lee Jeong.)

257
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:20,938
Li Yu was the swiftest.

258
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:22,378
When I say you have to raise it like this...

259
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:24,409
at a 45-degree angle...

260
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,579
This angle. Going diagonally.

261
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,119
Keep the 45-degree angle.

262
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:30,648
When I tell them to raise their arms,

263
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:33,788
there are some people whose arms are clearly down.

264
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:35,729
Don't raise your elbows. Put them down.

265
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:38,399
But Li Yu was never like that.

266
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:40,458
Keep the hand in line.

267
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:41,799
(He perfectly copied the leader.)

268
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:43,129
D...

269
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:44,899
Day.

270
00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:47,999
He kept trying to make it neat.

271
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:51,009
He continued to focus on how he looked.

272
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:53,009
You're doing well, Li Yu.

273
00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:56,179
I'm doing my best.

274
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:00,249
I was glad to be recognized by him.

275
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,248
I have never received...

276
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:07,459
that many positive evaluations by others.

277
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,528
(Chuei Li Yu diligently practiced.)

278
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:11,629
Let me see that again.

279
00:14:12,729 --> 00:14:14,399
Two, one.

280
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:17,199
(Jun Lee Jeong's words boosted Chuei Li Yu's confidence.)

281
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:18,939
That's how you do it. You're good.

282
00:14:18,969 --> 00:14:19,969
I'm not worried about you.

283
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,539
Six and seven.

284
00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:26,209
It's working!

285
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:29,009
It's working. It's going as planned.

286
00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:40,919
I didn't want to stop at this mission.

287
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:43,429
So I practiced hard.

288
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:49,599
(Chuei Li Yu did his best no matter the time or place.)

289
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:52,539
I will show you...

290
00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:56,069
why I got the killing part...

291
00:14:57,469 --> 00:14:59,209
and why the members trust me.

292
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:05,679
Out of the two teams, the team that enjoys this more will win.

293
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:08,489
That's right. The team that has more fun will win.

294
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:11,649
- Let's go! - Let's go!

295
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:13,458
- Let's go! - Let's go!

296
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:15,189
(The audience cheers for Team 2 right before the performance.)

297
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:18,658
They have a great lineup.

298
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:20,698
This is also a strong team.

299
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:22,569
(They're nervous.)

300
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:26,139
Let's go.

301
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:27,499
They're coming.

302
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,909

00:15:44,249 --> 00:15:45,259
Goodness.

307
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:15,719
Yes.

308
00:16:28,229 --> 00:16:29,229
Is that live singing?

309
00:16:53,619 --> 00:16:54,719
This part is so nice.

310
00:17:12,139 --> 00:17:13,379
Arctic is good.

311
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:23,948
Woo Jin is good.

312
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:25,189
He improved a lot.

313
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:17,439

- Let's go. - This...

357
00:19:45,829 --> 00:19:47,059
Seriously.

358
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:49,569
- Please. - No.

359
00:19:49,729 --> 00:19:51,469
They were both good.

360
00:19:52,269 --> 00:19:53,769
- I have no clue. - Please.

361
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,509
Team One's performance was fun.

362
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:57,669
But Team Two suited it better.

363
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,238
- It's coming! - Okay!

364
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,478
(The results will be revealed.)

365
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:03,509
("Plot Twist" by TWS, Team 1 versus Team 2)

366
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:05,949
- Right away? - Don't do this.

367
00:20:06,449 --> 00:20:09,889
(They're nervous.)

368
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:12,418
There is nowhere left for us to back down.

369
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,818
So we'll get the victory.

370
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:16,928
I don't think there'd be a problem.

371
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:18,359
I think we will be winning.

372
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:20,798
It's coming!

373
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,999
It's coming.

374
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:24,128
- Please. - Dong Hyun B, let's go.

375
00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:26,699
- Dong Hyun B, let's go. - Dong Hyun B.

376
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,139
I can't look.

377
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:30,268
I don't want to see it.

378
00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:32,239
- Xin Long can't lose. - I'm so curious.

379
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:33,579
Xin Long. Please.

380
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:37,509
(He Xin Long wins.)

381
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:41,649
(Sub-rapper All Star He Xin Long of Team 1 wins.)

382
00:20:44,389 --> 00:20:46,559
My part was really short.

383
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:48,659
So I put more effort into the gestures.

384
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:52,228
I won in the end.

385
00:20:52,229 --> 00:20:53,559
I'm very happy.

386
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,229
Well done.

387
00:20:55,329 --> 00:20:58,028
It's disappointing, but if I get another chance,

388
00:20:58,029 --> 00:20:59,339
I want to do better.

389
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:01,568
(What would be the results of the main vocalist position?)

390
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:02,808
(Noh Hui Jun and Jang Han Eum)

391
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:04,209
- Let's go. - Let's go.

392
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:05,909
Main vocalist.

393
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,179
They're both amazing.

394
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:09,779
(Vocalist Noh Hui Jun of Team 1 is experienced.)

395
00:21:10,209 --> 00:21:13,479
(Jang Han Eum of Team 2 showed off a powerful, rich voice.)

396
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:15,019
You should go, Hui Jun.

397
00:21:15,589 --> 00:21:16,789
Let's go, Hui Jun.

398
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:18,149
Let's go.

399
00:21:19,089 --> 00:21:20,118
(Jang Han Eum wins.)

400
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:24,159
(Main vocalist One Star Jang Ham Eum of Team 2 wins.)

401
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:25,799
Ham Eum!

402
00:21:27,629 --> 00:21:29,768
- That was close. - You did well.

403
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:30,899
It's okay.

404
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:34,239
It wasn't what I expected.

405
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:37,739
- The most important, killing part. - I have no clue about this.

406
00:21:38,469 --> 00:21:41,778
I think we put our best in our performance.

407
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:43,809
I would be really happy if we win.

408
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:49,419
I put in my best in this performance.

409
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,049
We'll go up.

410
00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:52,658
What will it be?

411
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:54,688
(Everyone is focused.)

412
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:56,489
Who will it be?

413
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:01,098
(Jung Hyun Jun wins.)

414
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:02,099
What?

415
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:04,728
(5th sub-vocalist and killing part Jung Hyun Jun of Team 2 wins.)

416
00:22:04,729 --> 00:22:05,869
That's a relief.

417
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,639
He was good.

418
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:10,868
He was really good.

419
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:12,979
- You were really good. - He was really good.

420
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:14,838
(Kang Woo Jin of Team 2 wins.)

421
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:15,849
Look at that.

422
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:17,308
- What's that? - That's a big difference.

423
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:18,409
That makes no sense.

424
00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:19,778
You never know with this.

425
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:20,948
It's neck and neck.

426
00:22:20,949 --> 00:22:22,019
(Team 1:2 wins, Team 2:2 wins)

427
00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:24,888
(Kim Tae Jo of Team 1 and Arctic of Team 2 are tied.)

428
00:22:24,889 --> 00:22:26,189
You're fine.

429
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,358
This is scary.

430
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:29,689
(The current score is 3 to 3 after the 4th sub-vocalists tied.)

431
00:22:30,129 --> 00:22:31,729
(Jun Lee Jeong of Team 2 wins.)

432
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:33,098
(Yi Chen of Team 2 wins.)

433
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:34,099
I won.

434
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,528
(Chung Sang Hyeon of Team 2 wins.)

435
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:36,998
The highest score.

436
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:37,999
(One Star Team 2 wins 3 times in a row.)

437
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,098
That's a big difference.

438
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:40,398
(Jang Han Eum, Kang Woo Jin, Jun Lee Jeong, Yi Chen, )

439
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:41,538
(and Chung Sang Hyeon won.)

440
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:43,739
(5 out of 8 members on Team 2 won.)

441
00:22:44,139 --> 00:22:45,838
But this is the 1-on-1 rival voting.

442
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,079
We don't know the team voting results.

443
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:49,508
- Well done, everyone. - Well done.

444
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:52,179
(Team 2 of "Plot Twist" wins.)

445
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:54,749
- Well done. - Well done.

446
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:57,219
It's not over for us yet.

447
00:22:57,719 --> 00:23:00,358
We still have the team scores left.

448
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,619
Let's cheer up.

449
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:05,258
Dear Star Creators who are here today,

450
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,629
how old are you?

451
00:23:06,729 --> 00:23:08,899
(It's a secret.)

452
00:23:09,129 --> 00:23:11,099
- Is it bad for me to ask? - Yes!

453
00:23:11,269 --> 00:23:12,669
(I'm sorry.)

454
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:15,739
This song might have existed longer...

455
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:18,039
than the song I am...

456
00:23:18,139 --> 00:23:19,779
about to introduce to you now.

457
00:23:21,139 --> 00:23:26,318
In 2004, this song won them The New Artist Award at MKMF.

458
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:27,719
(In 2004, the song won the band The New Artist Award at MKMF.)

459
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,149
TVXQ.

460
00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:31,448
It's TVXQ's...

461
00:23:31,449 --> 00:23:34,459
(TVXQ is the legendary idol group that led the K-pop craze.)

462
00:23:34,689 --> 00:23:36,328
"Rising Sun."

463
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:39,299
(TVXQ's "Rising Sun")

464
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:44,499
(People's cheer heightens the anxiety.)

465
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:46,799
It's crazy.

466
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:49,939
Let's go, boys!

467
00:23:50,469 --> 00:23:51,539
Let's go!

468
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:56,178
But this song is so tough.

469
00:23:56,179 --> 00:23:59,049
- The dance is hard too. - Please do well.

470
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,779
I'm excited.

471
00:24:00,949 --> 00:24:02,889
It must've been hard on Dong Yun.

472
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:04,118
We got this. Yusen.

473
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,958
Do everything you want to do, guys.

474
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:09,959
(How did "Rising Sun" Team 2 practice?)

475
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:13,099
("Rising Sun" practice room)

476
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:15,399
("Rising Sun" Team 1 is in the middle of the practice.)

477
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:17,399
(But...)

478
00:24:17,729 --> 00:24:19,769
("Rising Sun" Team 2 hasn't started the practice yet.)

479
00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:24,739
Let's try it.

480
00:24:25,209 --> 00:24:26,409
Aoshi.

481
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:27,639
You are in the center.

482
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:29,279
Jiang Fan, you are here.

483
00:24:31,449 --> 00:24:32,719
I don't think this is going to work.

484
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:34,778
Let's move to the back, Yusen.

485
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:36,219
I'm here, right?

486
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,849
- What? - Where should I be?

487
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:40,859
Here, right?

488
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:43,929
So...

489
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,129
Where is it?

490
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:49,328
It was my first time to lead, so I was clumsy.

491
00:24:49,329 --> 00:24:51,529
"How should I do it? Where do I begin?"

492
00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:54,298
Things were mixed up in my head.

493
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:55,469
I didn't know what to do first.

494
00:24:56,209 --> 00:24:58,008
Widen your stance.

495
00:24:58,009 --> 00:25:00,779
Start from the front and go all the way to the back.

496
00:25:00,939 --> 00:25:04,609
One, two, three, four. Five, six, seven, eight.

497
00:25:04,709 --> 00:25:08,179
Dong Heon led the team smoothly as if he were used to it.

498
00:25:08,349 --> 00:25:11,049
That made me realize how much of a rocky start we were having.

499
00:25:13,489 --> 00:25:15,119
("Rising Sun" practice room, rest area)

500
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:17,329
(Jiang Fan is crying in a corner.)

501
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:21,129
(What happened?)

502
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:23,098
(They were discussing something while practicing.)

503
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:24,599
I will go up gradually.

504
00:25:24,729 --> 00:25:26,969
Okay. Let's give that a try.

505
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:29,668
Taiga said he wanted...

506
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:31,939
to come up with fun and interesting routines.

507
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:33,679
You have to go there.

508
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:34,939
- To the very back? - Yes.

509
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:38,048
(He tells each one where he should stand.)

510
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:41,119
Jiang Fan, go inside.

511
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:44,789
When you were making the routines,

512
00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:47,559
did you intentionally make yourself go to the front...

513
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:50,389
and Jiang Fan go to the back?

514
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:52,758
Was it intentional?

515
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,358
No, there's a time when Jiang Fan goes to the front.

516
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,898
Before sending me to the back,

517
00:25:56,899 --> 00:25:58,669
shouldn't you have asked for my opinion first?

518
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:06,478
Some parts seem unfair to me.

519
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:08,938
Why is he sending me to the back here?

520
00:26:08,939 --> 00:26:10,449
He should at least tell me why.

521
00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:12,878
I hit my limit...

522
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:14,479
as the practice went on.

523
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,949
I felt helpless, not knowing how to get through the problems.

524
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,059
(Two Star Camp)

525
00:26:30,429 --> 00:26:32,399
I felt really sorry.

526
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:39,579
Is this beyond what I'm capable of?

527
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:45,409
(At the Final Class Announcement, )

528
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,849
(Dong Yun's teammate Lee Hyeop got eliminated, and he became alone.)

529
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:50,949
Not having Hyeop on my side...

530
00:26:51,249 --> 00:26:52,559
is hitting hard.

531
00:26:56,129 --> 00:26:57,328
Thinking about going through...

532
00:26:57,329 --> 00:26:59,799
all these struggles without him,

533
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:03,199
I feel so alone.

534
00:27:06,739 --> 00:27:10,468
(In the late night, Dong Yun is reading something.)

535
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:14,739
(It's the letter Hyeop left him.)

536
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:22,418
(You're always the youngest and the softest in the team.)

537
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:24,748
(And it worries me.)

538
00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:28,719
(But I know you, and you are stronger than anyone.)

539
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:33,099
(You are already doing well, and you will do even better.)

540
00:27:33,199 --> 00:27:37,169
(So please make it to the top for both of us.)

541
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:39,999
When I read the letter,

542
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,299
it really snapped me out of it.

543
00:27:45,139 --> 00:27:46,478
(While everyone is sleeping, )

544
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:48,809
(Dong Yun's bed is empty.)

545
00:27:54,949 --> 00:27:56,249
I'm here to make a debut,

546
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:58,549
and I have to go all the way for both of us.

547
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,959
(With the lights off, )

548
00:28:03,329 --> 00:28:08,299
(Dong Yun practices the routines alone all night.)

549
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,239
(Another morning comes.)

550
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:16,469
After boom-boom-pa,

551
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:19,238
jump and finish.

552
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,478
You move to this side while jumping.

553
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:21,608
(Making steady progress)

554
00:28:21,609 --> 00:28:22,909
You move forward while jumping.

555
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:26,679
(When he sees a teammate struggling...)

556
00:28:29,019 --> 00:28:30,589
Right. Okay. That's it.

557
00:28:30,849 --> 00:28:31,949
I will teach you.

558
00:28:32,589 --> 00:28:34,919
Racing on an endless track

559
00:28:35,389 --> 00:28:36,559
That's it.

560
00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:39,089
(He thanks him infinitely.)

561
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:42,599
He taught the members,

562
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:44,468
and he helped us get the details.

563
00:28:44,469 --> 00:28:48,139
I think Dong Yun is a good leader.

564
00:28:49,939 --> 00:28:55,239
("Rising Sun" Team 2 is growing more in sync.)

565
00:28:58,709 --> 00:29:00,749
(Dong Heon, the leader of Team 1 watches Team 2 practice.)

566
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:02,949
I got very worried.

567
00:29:03,189 --> 00:29:05,819
They seemed to be coming together.

568
00:29:05,949 --> 00:29:07,659
A team like that scares me more.

569
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,189
(Peer review among participants)

570
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:15,529
(The crowd goes wild from the very beginning.)

571
00:29:17,229 --> 00:29:19,969
(Team 2 performs stably.)

572
00:29:29,449 --> 00:29:31,179
(Their moves are perfectly in sync.)

573
00:29:39,459 --> 00:29:43,489
("Rising Sun" Team 2 finishes the performance.)

574
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:49,728
Here's the result.

575
00:29:49,729 --> 00:29:51,069
(It's time to check the result of the peer review.)

576
00:29:53,869 --> 00:29:56,169
This is the first evaluation.

577
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:58,269
It's a win.

578
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:00,309
Team Two.

579
00:30:01,139 --> 00:30:02,539
"Team Two is more in sync."

580
00:30:03,579 --> 00:30:05,079
- Team 2 won again. - Team 2 too.

581
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:07,479
- Team Two won again. - Again.

582
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,618
"Individually, they have room for improvement."

583
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:11,548
"But they were in sync, and they were like a real team."

584
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:13,789
We are hearing a lot of comments about being in sync.

585
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:16,429
I thought we might have a chance.

586
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,129
I thought we might win.

587
00:30:19,499 --> 00:30:20,759
Yusen could've done better.

588
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:22,769
He made some mistakes.

589
00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:31,309
(Yusen's voice was unstable at the high pitch part.)

590
00:30:31,709 --> 00:30:33,009
"Yusen could've done better."

591
00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:34,638
(Yusen keeps being mentioned as a contestant lacking in skill.)

592
00:30:34,639 --> 00:30:36,149
Yusen's voice could've done better.

593
00:30:38,509 --> 00:30:40,719
I hope you won't mind it.

594
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:43,289
Your voice has a lot of potential.

595
00:30:43,489 --> 00:30:45,688
Once you get used to it, I think you will do incredibly well.

596
00:30:45,689 --> 00:30:46,719
We have to do well.

597
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:50,189
People who weren't chosen got together and formed the team.

598
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:52,799
(When teams were being formed, )

599
00:30:52,899 --> 00:30:56,229
(those who weren't chosen became "Rising Sun" Team 2.)

600
00:30:57,269 --> 00:30:59,768
We got so lucky and got only the good guys in the team.

601
00:30:59,769 --> 00:31:02,199
And as the leader, that gives me so much strength.

602
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:03,369
We got this.

603
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:06,069
- Come closer, will you? - Let's say it together.

604
00:31:06,109 --> 00:31:07,508
When I say "Rising Sun" Team Two, you say, "Cheers!"

605
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:08,738
In 3, 2, 1.

606
00:31:08,739 --> 00:31:10,549
- Cheers! - Cheers!

607
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:12,609
"Rising Sun."

608
00:31:17,489 --> 00:31:19,288
(Finally, they are on stage.)

609
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:21,418
(How will Team 2 perform?)

610
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:24,128
It's a mission where you must win to survive.

611
00:31:24,129 --> 00:31:25,228
So I don't want to lose.

612
00:31:25,229 --> 00:31:27,329
- Go, Team 2! - Go, Team 2!

613
00:31:27,629 --> 00:31:28,758
Let's do this.

614
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:30,829
"Rising Sun" is like a tough hurdle.

615
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:32,429
Do well.

616
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:36,069
I really want him to do well in vocal. Yusen.

617
00:31:36,339 --> 00:31:37,539
And everybody.

618
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,538
("Rising Sun" by TVXQ)

619

621

Yes!

622

I got chills all over.

623
00:32:08,499 --> 00:32:11,109
Yes!

624
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:19,549
- Amazing. - He's good!

625
00:32:24,719 --> 00:32:25,889
Nice.

626
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,039

(I lay down to sleep, and I hear the echo.)

629
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:49,478
(I can't wait to hear it next week.)

630
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:50,679
(Will he be able to pull it off?)

631
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:57,789
It's okay.

632

633
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:37,029
He's good.

634
00:33:55,109 --> 00:33:56,209
I got goosebumps.

635
00:34:04,189 --> 00:34:05,389
Amazing sequence.

636
00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:08,489
Awesome!

637
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:23,239
Aoshi has good facial expressions.

638
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:26,839
Great.

Go, Yusen!

641
00:35:05,279 --> 00:35:06,849
- He pulled it off. - He did.

642
00:35:18,489 --> 00:35:19,489
I'm getting chills.

(You can watch the full version on YouTube and Mnet Plus.)

644
00:35:30,209 --> 00:35:31,969
Well done!

645
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:33,779
Good job, boys!

648
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,778
- They did so well. - Yes.

649
00:35:39,779 --> 00:35:40,849
That was incredible.

650
00:35:42,379 --> 00:35:43,719
They did so well.

651
00:35:43,949 --> 00:35:45,148
Good job!

00:35:46,319 --> 00:35:48,088
- Ye Chan rapped well too. - Yes.

654
00:35:48,089 --> 00:35:49,219
He did pretty well.

655
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:50,489

656
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,729

(2 Star, killing part, Aoshi)

658
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:55,799
- Good job! - Good job!

659
00:35:56,769 --> 00:35:57,899
- What was that? - What?

660
00:35:58,099 --> 00:35:59,568
(His body is all pumped up from the passionate performance.)

661
00:35:59,569 --> 00:36:00,638
What on earth?

662
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:01,769
He looks so buff!

663
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:03,108
Cool.

664
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:04,709
Why are his muscles so pumped?

665
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:06,309
- I would have done that too. - Was that Aoshi?

666
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,939
- Aoshi? - No?

667
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:10,309
What did you think, guys?

668
00:36:10,549 --> 00:36:11,849
- I think we can beat them. - I think we can beat them.

669
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:15,378
I thought it was a sure win for Team One,

670
00:36:15,379 --> 00:36:17,718
but now I'm not so sure. Team Two is pretty good.

671
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:19,959
Team Two did way better than I expected.

672
00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:22,489
Aoshi was good.

673
00:36:23,429 --> 00:36:25,229
I watched from behind,

674
00:36:25,289 --> 00:36:26,999
and we showed them everything we practiced.

675
00:36:28,799 --> 00:36:30,228
They all did well without getting intimidated,

676
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,569
although it was their first competition.

677
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:34,969
They seemed to perform better in front of cameras.

678
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:37,669
I wanted to clap for them.

679
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:41,579
They have drastically different leaders.

680
00:36:41,779 --> 00:36:42,809
Right.

681
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:44,808
Dong Yun is a calm type.

682
00:36:44,809 --> 00:36:46,549
He's very kind.

683
00:36:46,779 --> 00:36:48,949
And Dong Heon is a charismatic type.

684
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,448
Guys, it's okay even if you make a mistake.

685
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:53,358
What matters is our attitude.

686
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:54,388
- Okay. - All right?

("Rising Sun" Team 1 mentally gears up.)

688
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:56,789
(What was their practice like?)

689
00:36:57,959 --> 00:36:58,959
Should we give it a go?

690
00:36:58,959 --> 00:36:59,959
- Yes. - Yes.

691
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:03,269
(Interim check for Team 1's vocals)

692
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:06,899
(Andrew, the 1st sub-vocalist sings first.)

693
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:10,339
(Days that feel like they'll turn me to ashes)

(Next, Won Jun delivers stable vocals.)

697
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:26,689
That's good.

698
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:31,789
(Sun Heng Yu easily pulls off the high notes.)

699
00:37:37,569 --> 00:37:38,629
That was good.

700
00:37:40,399 --> 00:37:41,469
Okay.

701
00:37:41,701 --> 00:37:42,761
- Thank you. - Thank you.

702
00:37:43,131 --> 00:37:45,771
Andrew, you have a unique style.

703
00:37:46,001 --> 00:37:47,001
Thank you.

704
00:37:47,002 --> 00:37:49,771
That soul he put into his singing was...

705
00:37:50,671 --> 00:37:53,441
(It no longer glows)

706
00:37:54,011 --> 00:37:55,980
(He has the vibe of a true American.)

707
00:37:55,981 --> 00:37:57,610
It's a fairly easy choreography...

708
00:37:57,611 --> 00:37:59,720
to dance in sync,

709
00:37:59,721 --> 00:38:00,950
so try to be on the beat.

710
00:38:00,951 --> 00:38:02,350
It's like a military drill.

711
00:38:02,351 --> 00:38:03,721
- Salute. - That's right.

712
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:05,021
At ease.

713
00:38:05,121 --> 00:38:08,460
So, I hope you keep that in mind.

714
00:38:08,461 --> 00:38:10,430
- Okay. Thank you. - Thank you!

715
00:38:10,431 --> 00:38:11,960
(Team 1's interim check ended on a peaceful note.)

716
00:38:11,961 --> 00:38:13,231
Discipline and synchronization.

717
00:38:13,261 --> 00:38:15,431
As if I'm sharpening a blade.

718
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:17,201
Let's try it. In 6, 7, 8.

719
00:38:17,301 --> 00:38:19,170
It fills my heart

720
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,071
Sato, your arms are too slow.

721
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:25,010
(Masato's arm movements were a tiny bit late.)

722
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,780
We need to go again if we're not in sync.

723
00:38:26,781 --> 00:38:27,841
In 6, 7, 8.

724
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:31,450
"I didn't know you could be so in sync in such a short time."

725
00:38:31,451 --> 00:38:32,880
That's what I wanted to hear.

726
00:38:32,881 --> 00:38:33,881
Boom.

727
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:35,021
We need to be in sync.

728
00:38:35,022 --> 00:38:36,491
That's what a synchronized dance is.

729
00:38:36,921 --> 00:38:40,190
Let's go again. In 5, 6, 7, 8.

730
00:38:40,191 --> 00:38:41,191
Again.

731
00:38:41,192 --> 00:38:42,960
One more time. In 5, 6, 7.

732
00:38:42,961 --> 00:38:44,660
- Let's speed it up a bit. - Okay.

733
00:38:44,661 --> 00:38:46,330
In 5, 6, 7.

734
00:38:46,331 --> 00:38:48,701
(Team 1 gradually gets in sync as if they're trained soldiers.)

735
00:38:51,231 --> 00:38:54,001
(They won't accept a single mistake.)

736
00:38:54,371 --> 00:38:56,070
(Their practice continues.)

737
00:38:56,071 --> 00:38:57,411
Okay. Get down.

738
00:38:59,141 --> 00:39:00,241
Get down.

739
00:39:00,481 --> 00:39:02,440
(Chun Bae, the Planet Guard, is here.)

740
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:03,481
Sit.

741
00:39:04,081 --> 00:39:05,111
Paw.

742
00:39:05,951 --> 00:39:06,981
Nose.

743
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:09,221
(Stop!)

744
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:10,920
- Picture! - He doesn't like it.

745
00:39:10,921 --> 00:39:12,621
No picture, then.

746
00:39:14,161 --> 00:39:15,621
Let's go again.

747
00:39:20,001 --> 00:39:21,631
(Masato is a bit late.)

748
00:39:24,401 --> 00:39:25,830
(Exclaiming)

749
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:27,641
It's the CEO's song, so...

750
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:32,040
(Jae Joong is the original singer of "Rising Sun...")

751
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:33,980
(and the CEO of iNKODE, Masato's agency.)

752
00:39:33,981 --> 00:39:36,410
I'll keep practicing since I feel responsible.

753
00:39:36,411 --> 00:39:37,681
(Masato practices with a bigger sense of responsibility.)

754
00:39:37,881 --> 00:39:39,681
- Let's practice. - Practice?

755
00:39:40,481 --> 00:39:43,121
It fills my heart

756
00:39:43,321 --> 00:39:44,351
Repeat.

757
00:39:46,861 --> 00:39:47,960
Again.

758
00:39:47,961 --> 00:39:50,390
It fills my heart

759
00:39:50,391 --> 00:39:51,561
Again.

760
00:39:52,091 --> 00:39:53,761
In 5, 6, 7.

761
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:56,430
(They keep practicing to be perfectly in sync.)

762
00:39:56,431 --> 00:40:00,101
Waiting for the rising sun

763
00:40:01,001 --> 00:40:02,171
In 5, 6...

764
00:40:03,141 --> 00:40:05,240
(He won't stop.)

765
00:40:05,241 --> 00:40:06,911
It's so tough.

766
00:40:07,811 --> 00:40:10,010
- We got it. - Let's go.

767
00:40:10,011 --> 00:40:11,651
(A new day begins.)

768
00:40:12,351 --> 00:40:16,351
("Rising Sun" Team 1 ignites its fighting spirit once again.)

769
00:40:21,561 --> 00:40:24,030
(But Heng Yu is wearing a mask and isn't singing.)

770
00:40:24,031 --> 00:40:27,431
I've been overworking my throat.

771
00:40:28,201 --> 00:40:29,531
Because I couldn't afford to lose.

772
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:33,801
I kept singing my heart out as if I were on the stage,

773
00:40:34,241 --> 00:40:35,641
and my throat stopped working.

774
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:39,511
Do you know why?

775
00:40:42,511 --> 00:40:44,811
I don't know what to do now.

776
00:40:46,081 --> 00:40:48,350
(Team 1 is practicing singing altogether.)

777
00:40:48,351 --> 00:40:50,391
(Stop.)

778
00:40:52,891 --> 00:40:56,260
(Dong Heon stops Heng Yu from singing.)

779
00:40:56,261 --> 00:40:58,091
I was very concerned.

780
00:41:00,061 --> 00:41:03,060
But I know that he's able to pull it off,

781
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:04,501
so I have faith in him.

782
00:41:04,871 --> 00:41:06,501
(That night)

783
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:10,941
(Heng Yu keeps coughing as his throat hurts.)

784
00:41:12,211 --> 00:41:14,981
(He can't seem to fall asleep.)

785
00:41:15,411 --> 00:41:16,711
Is your throat okay?

786
00:41:17,111 --> 00:41:18,711
No, it's a bit...

787
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:21,081
He's in trouble.

788
00:41:23,651 --> 00:41:27,191
This is honey. It's good for your throat.

789
00:41:27,391 --> 00:41:28,461
Have a sip.

790
00:41:30,531 --> 00:41:32,090
- How does it feel? - Thank you.

791
00:41:32,091 --> 00:41:33,601
- Do you have water? - Yes.

792
00:41:33,961 --> 00:41:36,361
Drink some water with it before sleeping.

793
00:41:36,871 --> 00:41:39,401
I was very thankful for my teammates.

794
00:41:39,841 --> 00:41:43,140
We need to trust ourselves and trust the team.

795
00:41:43,141 --> 00:41:44,710
From here on out,

796
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,580
we only have practice and teamwork left.

797
00:41:46,581 --> 00:41:47,640
In 3, 4.

798
00:41:47,641 --> 00:41:49,081
It might be our last one.

799
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:51,411
We all did our best.

800
00:41:52,311 --> 00:41:53,451
We need to win, no matter what.

801
00:41:55,381 --> 00:41:57,490
(Team 1 practiced non-stop...)

802
00:41:57,491 --> 00:41:59,091
(while believing in each other.)

803
00:42:00,721 --> 00:42:03,291
(They never stopped practicing so they could win.)

804
00:42:03,961 --> 00:42:05,131
Okay.

805
00:42:06,091 --> 00:42:07,261
Please. Wish us luck.

806
00:42:09,831 --> 00:42:12,600
I heard Heng Yu's voice was starting to go.

807
00:42:12,601 --> 00:42:13,900
- Yes, his voice... - Seriously?

808
00:42:13,901 --> 00:42:15,400
- He totally lost his voice. Yes. - Now?

809
00:42:15,401 --> 00:42:17,340
He won't be able to sing, then. This is a disaster.

810
00:42:17,341 --> 00:42:19,441
It could be a disaster.

811
00:42:19,711 --> 00:42:20,840
Even when you make a mistake,

812
00:42:20,841 --> 00:42:22,241
just hold your ground.

813
00:42:22,481 --> 00:42:24,050
When you frown after a mistake,

814
00:42:24,051 --> 00:42:25,451
- it makes us look worse. - Okay.

815
00:42:25,511 --> 00:42:26,851
- Keep going even after mistakes. - Okay.

816
00:42:27,321 --> 00:42:28,321
All right.

817
00:42:29,351 --> 00:42:30,691
We can't afford to lose.

818
00:42:31,821 --> 00:42:33,720
Even if it means completely losing my voice,

819
00:42:33,721 --> 00:42:35,821
I want this to be the best performance.

820
00:42:36,691 --> 00:42:37,931
Here they come!

821
00:42:38,031 --> 00:42:39,130
They're perfectly in sync.

822
00:42:39,131 --> 00:42:40,501
- Is he coming? - It'll be a textbook performance.

823
00:42:47,801 --> 00:42:52,041
("Rising Sun")

824
00:42:59,311 --> 00:43:00,351
So cool.

825
00:43:20,671 --> 00:43:21,971
Gosh, they're perfectly in sync.

826
00:43:30,081 --> 00:43:31,551
So this is what he sounds like live?

827
00:43:38,051 --> 00:43:39,091
My ears are melting.

828
00:43:42,991 --> 00:43:43,991
He's doing well.

829
00:43:49,261 --> 00:43:50,601
- Please. - Be quiet.

830
00:43:59,171 --> 00:44:00,311
Oh, no.

831
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:06,611
Park Jun Il, you drive me crazy!

832
00:44:15,421 --> 00:44:16,591
Their teamwork is good.

833
00:44:35,411 --> 00:44:36,711
Our Ye Chan is good too.

834
00:44:46,551 --> 00:44:47,791
Oh, my. He's good.

835
00:45:01,901 --> 00:45:02,901
Yes.

836
00:45:13,981 --> 00:45:15,581
- Yes. Let's go. - Nice.

837
00:45:28,731 --> 00:45:29,901
(Harry)

838
00:45:40,411 --> 00:45:41,641
Oh, yes. He's good.

(Muhn Won Jun)

840
00:46:01,761 --> 00:46:03,060
Gosh, that was so cool.

841
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:04,531
What a moving performance.

842
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,941
They're giving their all.

843
00:46:28,561 --> 00:46:31,431
(You can watch the full version on YouTube and Mnet Plus.)

844

(Giving Team 1 for "Rising Sun" a round of applause)

845
00:46:35,861 --> 00:46:37,400
Sun Heng Yu, you nailed it.

846
00:46:37,401 --> 00:46:38,401
Well done.

- Oh, my. Jun Il. - Gosh.

856
00:46:50,581 --> 00:46:51,750
Jun Il did a great job.

857
00:46:51,751 --> 00:46:54,820
By the way, Sun Heng Yu's voice was quite hoarse.

858
00:46:54,821 --> 00:46:56,020
- But he just went for it. - Gosh.

859
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,120
- I admire his boldness. - Right.

860
00:46:57,121 --> 00:46:58,220
- That was just crazy. - Seriously.

861
00:46:58,221 --> 00:47:00,290
His vocal cords weren't working. But he powered through anyway.

862
00:47:00,291 --> 00:47:02,661
- Yes, he did. - That's impressive too.

863
00:47:05,131 --> 00:47:07,130
(His vocal cords were in bad shape.)

864
00:47:07,131 --> 00:47:09,631
(But he sang the high notes out of sheer willpower.)

865
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:11,201
- He managed to sing those notes. - Yes.

866
00:47:11,301 --> 00:47:12,470
Which team was better?

867
00:47:12,471 --> 00:47:13,970
On the performance?

868
00:47:13,971 --> 00:47:17,611
This team was very powerful together.

869
00:47:18,171 --> 00:47:19,171
- They were nice together. - So that's why...

870
00:47:19,471 --> 00:47:21,280
My gosh. But I really don't know how it will turn out.

871
00:47:21,281 --> 00:47:23,141
I'm really curious.

872
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:25,180
- Heng Yu, you were amazing. - You think so?

873
00:47:25,181 --> 00:47:27,421
Sun Heng. I mean, it wasn't your best.

874
00:47:27,621 --> 00:47:29,621
- You did better during practice. - I see.

875
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:31,650
But you still did well.

876
00:47:31,651 --> 00:47:32,851
- You did a great job. - I could barely sing.

877
00:47:32,951 --> 00:47:35,520
The last part with the high notes was nicely done.

878
00:47:35,521 --> 00:47:37,091
- Okay. Yes. - You were full of energy.

879
00:47:37,191 --> 00:47:39,330
I believed in you. I mean it.

880
00:47:39,331 --> 00:47:40,331
What a relief.

881
00:47:40,332 --> 00:47:41,930
Had I done a better job,

882
00:47:41,931 --> 00:47:43,530
our performance would've been perfect.

883
00:47:43,531 --> 00:47:46,331
So I feel bad about that. But our team did a great job.

884
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:48,171
Everyone but me killed it on stage.

885
00:47:49,801 --> 00:47:51,870
- This is the closest match. - Right. Seriously.

886
00:47:51,871 --> 00:47:53,071
I wonder which team will win.

887
00:47:53,581 --> 00:47:55,240
- What did you say? - But this...

888
00:47:55,241 --> 00:47:57,580
I think we did a better job of bringing back the retro vibe.

889
00:47:57,581 --> 00:47:58,951
We'll win, no matter what.

890

891
00:48:01,981 --> 00:48:05,521

895
00:48:12,761 --> 00:48:14,701
- Heng Yu. - Let's go. Please.

896
00:48:14,901 --> 00:48:16,501
I made a mistake.

897
00:48:16,601 --> 00:48:19,101
But I still hope I can win.

898
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,270
- His part... - The song...

899
00:48:21,271 --> 00:48:23,070
- The main vocalists... - Please.

900
00:48:23,071 --> 00:48:24,241
It has to be Heng Yu. He did well.

901
00:48:24,841 --> 00:48:27,380
(Main Vocalist Sun Heng Yu wins with 105 points.)

902
00:48:27,381 --> 00:48:28,640
- My gosh. - Goodness.

903
00:48:28,641 --> 00:48:31,751
- They must've felt his energy. - Sun Heng Yu!

904
00:48:32,351 --> 00:48:34,751
- See? They must've felt that. - Yes.

905
00:48:35,351 --> 00:48:36,881
I'm so grateful. I mean it.

906
00:48:37,151 --> 00:48:38,351
You did well.

907
00:48:40,991 --> 00:48:43,631
- Jiang Fan. - I'm not sure about this one.

908
00:48:43,831 --> 00:48:44,960
Both of them did a great job.

909
00:48:44,961 --> 00:48:47,100
(Sub-Vocalist 1 Andrew wins with 115 points.)

910
00:48:47,101 --> 00:48:49,530
(Team 2 of "Rising Sun" has lost consecutively.)

911
00:48:49,531 --> 00:48:51,670
- Aoshi. - It will be tough to beat Aoshi.

912
00:48:51,671 --> 00:48:53,200
- They loved him. - It'll be hard to beat Aoshi.

913
00:48:53,201 --> 00:48:54,371
But Won Jun did a great job.

914
00:48:54,771 --> 00:48:57,710
(Sub-Vocalist 2 Muhn Won Jun wins with 117 points.)

915
00:48:57,711 --> 00:48:59,141
- Hey. - Hey.

916
00:48:59,471 --> 00:49:01,041
- I didn't see this coming. - Really?

917
00:49:01,641 --> 00:49:03,711
(Aoshi of Team 2 lost even when he had the killing part.)

918
00:49:04,251 --> 00:49:05,911
- It's okay. You did well. - That's crazy.

919
00:49:06,411 --> 00:49:07,950
- Yummy. - Please.

920
00:49:07,951 --> 00:49:09,320
(Masato versus Taiga)

921
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,321
Okay!

922
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:13,991
(Team 2 fell far behind in the individual voting results.)

923
00:49:14,421 --> 00:49:18,131
(The two teams give off completely opposite moods.)

924
00:49:18,361 --> 00:49:19,760
I was quite flustered.

925
00:49:19,761 --> 00:49:21,461
I thought, "What should I do?"

926
00:49:22,931 --> 00:49:25,370
- Seriously. - Gosh, the score gap is huge.

927
00:49:25,371 --> 00:49:26,570
- He got 117 points. - This is...

928
00:49:26,571 --> 00:49:28,800
(Leader Kim Dong Yun was the only winner from his team.)

929
00:49:28,801 --> 00:49:30,741
That didn't feel good exactly.

930
00:49:31,171 --> 00:49:33,811
I was the only one who won, and everyone else lost.

931
00:49:35,411 --> 00:49:38,350
(Team 2 of "Rising Sun" comes back to their seats.)

932
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:40,751
The gap shouldn't have been that big, though.

933
00:49:42,451 --> 00:49:44,721
You did well.

934
00:49:48,361 --> 00:49:51,091
(At that moment, Yeom Ye Chan starts crying.)

935
00:49:55,861 --> 00:49:58,371
(Taiga who's sitting next to him ends up in tears too.)

936
00:49:59,101 --> 00:50:00,200
(Leader Kim Dong Yun spots them crying.)

937
00:50:00,201 --> 00:50:02,171
Oh, no. Dong Yun is thinking if he should go and comfort them.

938
00:50:02,271 --> 00:50:03,711
Why are you guys crying?

939
00:50:05,741 --> 00:50:07,380
They're usually full of energy.

940
00:50:07,381 --> 00:50:09,140
But they must've been disappointed by the results a lot.

941
00:50:09,141 --> 00:50:11,281
(Bian Shi Yu: 40, Yeom Ye Chan: 57, Taiga: 33, Jang Tae Yoon: 32)

942
00:50:12,711 --> 00:50:16,020
(They can't stop crying as they're disappointed.)

943
00:50:16,021 --> 00:50:17,350
- Don't cry. - No.

944
00:50:17,351 --> 00:50:19,221
Watching them cry made me feel dejected.

945
00:50:19,821 --> 00:50:22,091
- You guys were so cool. - I felt bad for my team.

946
00:50:24,591 --> 00:50:26,561
Had I done a better job leading the team,

947
00:50:27,161 --> 00:50:29,231
our results could have changed...

948
00:50:30,131 --> 00:50:34,001
and they wouldn't have cried. Those regrets crossed my mind.

949
00:50:35,341 --> 00:50:38,571
(Even after coming back to his seat, Dong Yun keeps looking at his team.)

950
00:50:49,081 --> 00:50:51,350
(The tears he's been holding back spill out in the end.)

951
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:53,191
My gosh. Why are you crying?

952
00:50:55,661 --> 00:50:57,430
Why are you crying?

953
00:50:57,431 --> 00:50:59,191
This was your first time leading a team. You did well.

954
00:50:59,561 --> 00:51:01,301
Good job.

955
00:51:04,631 --> 00:51:07,401
There are boys who will set your heart on fire this season.

956
00:51:07,501 --> 00:51:09,401
But in the first season,

957
00:51:10,141 --> 00:51:12,471
there were boys who shone brightly.

958
00:51:13,141 --> 00:51:14,241
Does he mean ZEROBASEONE?

959
00:51:14,881 --> 00:51:17,680
Since receiving the Rookie Award at the 2023 MAMA Awards,

960
00:51:17,681 --> 00:51:19,211
they went on to win ten Rookie Awards in total.

961
00:51:19,311 --> 00:51:21,450
They've sold over 1 million copies with 5 consecutive albums.

962
00:51:21,451 --> 00:51:23,751
The group has established itself as the fifth-generation idol group.

963
00:51:24,251 --> 00:51:26,851
It's "KILL THE ROMEO" by ZEROBASEONE.

964
00:51:28,321 --> 00:51:32,361
(Teams 1 and 2 of "KILL THE ROMEO" enter with determination.)

965
00:51:36,861 --> 00:51:37,870
(Tatsuki)

966
00:51:37,871 --> 00:51:38,871
(Kim Dong Hyun)

967
00:51:38,872 --> 00:51:40,201
Hello.

968
00:51:41,201 --> 00:51:43,740
We'd like to say hello to the Star Creators.

969
00:51:43,741 --> 00:51:44,810
(Laughing)

970
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:47,040
- "Nice to meet you." - "Hello."

971
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:49,481
- This isn't some private event. - "Play the song!"

972
00:51:50,081 --> 00:51:52,381
We're Team One.

973
00:51:52,481 --> 00:51:55,821
We're Team KILL THE ROMEO.

974
00:51:56,421 --> 00:51:57,450
(Jia Hao)

975
00:51:57,451 --> 00:51:58,451
(Yang Heui Chan)

976
00:51:58,452 --> 00:52:00,661
My gosh. Our Heui Chan is so cute.

977
00:52:01,421 --> 00:52:02,861
- So cute. - He's cute.

978
00:52:03,831 --> 00:52:07,900
Hey, what's up? Make some noise!

979
00:52:07,901 --> 00:52:10,600
(Make some noise.)

980
00:52:10,601 --> 00:52:14,571
We're after the hearts of the Star Creators.

981
00:52:15,101 --> 00:52:17,341
- We're Heart Killers. - Heart Killers.

982
00:52:19,541 --> 00:52:20,581
(Tatsuki)

983
00:52:20,741 --> 00:52:22,381
How was the rehearsal with Team Two?

984
00:52:22,481 --> 00:52:26,181
They had a lot of disagreements.

985
00:52:28,721 --> 00:52:30,491
(A few days ago at Planet Camp)

986
00:52:30,751 --> 00:52:33,790
- Okay. Two Stars and One Stars. - Yes.

987
00:52:33,791 --> 00:52:34,891
- Yes. - Yes.

988
00:52:35,161 --> 00:52:36,920
How did it go for you, One Stars?

989
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:38,730
How did you communicate when dividing up the song?

990
00:52:38,731 --> 00:52:40,061
Are you all happy with your parts?

991
00:52:40,801 --> 00:52:43,761
(The participants on Team 2 can't seem to answer his question.)

992
00:52:48,401 --> 00:52:51,471
Raise your hands if you want a different position.

993
00:52:52,671 --> 00:52:54,510
(Kim Dong Hyun A raises his hands quietly.)

994
00:52:54,511 --> 00:52:58,911
Guo Zhen. And I see. Zhong Xing too. So it's the four of you.

995
00:53:00,751 --> 00:53:02,181
(He fails to hold back his laughter.)

996
00:53:02,581 --> 00:53:03,721
Hang on.

997
00:53:03,821 --> 00:53:06,251
Just a second. I've never seen this kind of thing before, so...

998
00:53:06,451 --> 00:53:07,891
I need time to get used to this too.

999
00:53:08,321 --> 00:53:10,360
Do you feel okay?

1000
00:53:10,361 --> 00:53:12,131
No.

1001
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,271
- No. - You don't feel okay? Why not?

1002
00:53:21,141 --> 00:53:22,171
Actually,

1003
00:53:22,801 --> 00:53:24,841
things are so tough, and I'm so tired.

1004
00:53:25,371 --> 00:53:28,080
What can we do? We're all tired, but we're doing our best.

1005
00:53:28,081 --> 00:53:29,081
I know.

1006
00:53:36,951 --> 00:53:40,191
(Team 2's interim check starts amid a heavy atmosphere.)

1007
00:53:53,401 --> 00:53:56,471
(He Zhong Xing can't keep up with the choreography.)

1008
00:54:02,541 --> 00:54:05,611
Gosh, darn it.

1009
00:54:10,051 --> 00:54:11,291
Gosh, what are we going to do?

1010
00:54:15,921 --> 00:54:17,460
I don't know how this situation...

1011
00:54:17,461 --> 00:54:20,161
feels to you guys in your hearts,

1012
00:54:22,101 --> 00:54:23,901
but if you don't do well, you will just be eliminated.

1013
00:54:25,431 --> 00:54:27,841
Would we be upset? It's your lives.

1014
00:54:33,941 --> 00:54:36,411
They'll never become singers like this.

1015
00:54:40,621 --> 00:54:43,381
Honestly, I thought about it so many times.

1016
00:54:43,521 --> 00:54:45,051
Seriously, so many times.

1017
00:54:45,521 --> 00:54:47,391
I thought about wanting to leave.

1018
00:54:48,091 --> 00:54:49,561
Okay, sub-rapper two, please come up.

1019
00:54:50,461 --> 00:54:51,461
Thank you.

1020
00:54:51,462 --> 00:54:54,501
(He Zhong Xing gets a Lose sticker in the end.)

1021
00:55:03,601 --> 00:55:06,071
Your image in everyday life...

1022
00:55:06,671 --> 00:55:07,811
is really important.

1023
00:55:09,381 --> 00:55:11,981
Zhong Xing, if you just stand there like this,

1024
00:55:12,551 --> 00:55:14,821
your whole team loses energy.

1025
00:55:20,351 --> 00:55:22,861
(After the interim check)

1026
00:55:27,191 --> 00:55:29,431
(The team members go back to the practice room.)

1027
00:55:35,671 --> 00:55:38,641
(He Zhong Xing throws away the Lose sticker.)

1028
00:55:38,941 --> 00:55:40,411
You have to take the Lose sticker.

1029
00:55:41,581 --> 00:55:43,381
- I have to take it with me? - Put it on your name tag.

1030
00:55:50,351 --> 00:55:52,721
(He Zhong Xing is sleeping after putting the Lose sticker on.)

1031
00:55:57,931 --> 00:56:00,491
(The practice stops at the killing part.)

1032
00:56:01,301 --> 00:56:02,861
Our killing part member is sleeping.

1033
00:56:04,331 --> 00:56:06,001
Please wake up.

1034
00:56:09,641 --> 00:56:10,671
Get up.

1035
00:56:12,271 --> 00:56:15,411
(The team members take turns waking He Zhong Xing up.)

1036
00:56:16,741 --> 00:56:17,951
Let's find the center and start practicing.

1037
00:56:19,211 --> 00:56:21,481
(They finally manage to start the group practice.)

1038
00:56:27,421 --> 00:56:28,421
Opposite.

1039
00:56:32,761 --> 00:56:35,261
(He Zhong Xing still can't seem to focus on the practice.)

1040
00:56:38,631 --> 00:56:40,941
So, right now...

1041
00:56:41,841 --> 00:56:46,071
I want to ask what you think we're going to accomplish by doing this.

1042
00:56:46,241 --> 00:56:49,510
I want to ask if he thinks this practice is going anywhere.

1043
00:56:49,511 --> 00:56:52,650
Right now, almost all of us...

1044
00:56:52,651 --> 00:56:54,880
got Lose stickers at the interim check.

1045
00:56:54,881 --> 00:56:58,321
But as soon as we got back, you just started sleeping.

1046
00:56:58,521 --> 00:57:00,320
I mean, are you not upset about this?

1047
00:57:00,321 --> 00:57:02,821
Aren't you disappointed about this?

1048
00:57:04,531 --> 00:57:06,990
I don't think I can do my best if things go like this.

1049
00:57:06,991 --> 00:57:10,461
We shouldn't be deciding who's right and wrong.

1050
00:57:10,801 --> 00:57:12,970
This is just my personal habit.

1051
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,271
I like practicing on my own.

1052
00:57:17,401 --> 00:57:20,441
(He Zhong Xing decides to take some time to practice alone.)

1053
00:57:21,111 --> 00:57:24,811
I think just practicing isn't enough.

1054
00:57:27,451 --> 00:57:32,321
I think we need a creative idea more than anything.

1055
00:57:33,221 --> 00:57:34,590
From now on, for the next few days,

1056
00:57:34,591 --> 00:57:37,761
I'll focus on creative expression.

1057
00:57:39,361 --> 00:57:43,361
(He Zhong Xing focuses on his own performance over the team practice.)

1058
00:57:44,801 --> 00:57:46,731
(The day of the 1-on-1 Class Battle Rehearsal)

1059
00:57:47,371 --> 00:57:49,001
It's my part.

1060
00:57:49,141 --> 00:57:51,310
It's my part, but just because I didn't do as you said...

1061
00:57:51,311 --> 00:57:53,940
after you said you didn't like what I was doing,

1062
00:57:53,941 --> 00:57:57,140
is it okay for you to sit there with a nasty face and ruin the mood?

1063
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:58,180
I didn't ruin the mood.

1064
00:57:58,181 --> 00:57:59,250
Did you or didn't you have a nasty look on your face?

1065
00:57:59,251 --> 00:58:00,851
- I did. - Did you or didn't you?

1066
00:58:01,651 --> 00:58:03,751
(The mood gets riled up. What's up with "KILL THE ROMEO" Team 2?)

1067
00:58:05,291 --> 00:58:06,291
Music, cue.

1068
00:58:06,951 --> 00:58:09,661
(Their set begins with He Zhong Xing's rose performance.)

1069
00:58:20,171 --> 00:58:21,171
He Zhong Xing.

1070
00:58:23,001 --> 00:58:25,271
At first, when you bring the flower out with you...

1071
00:58:26,741 --> 00:58:28,280
If it'll be like what you did just now,

1072
00:58:28,281 --> 00:58:31,351
I think it might be better just to go without it.

1073
00:58:32,351 --> 00:58:34,920
It seems like you're joking around.

1074
00:58:34,921 --> 00:58:36,881
Unless you're going to show people something big with it...

1075
00:58:42,291 --> 00:58:46,431
Later on, how about just putting the rose on the floor?

1076
00:58:46,831 --> 00:58:49,101
- Where? - When I go that way.

1077
00:58:52,431 --> 00:58:53,471
I'm not impressed.

1078
00:58:54,401 --> 00:58:56,241
It's really not that great.

1079
00:58:56,471 --> 00:58:58,210
But does it bother you if I do this?

1080
00:58:58,211 --> 00:59:00,140
- It does bother me. - What about it bothers you?

1081
00:59:00,141 --> 00:59:01,740
I'm not throwing it up like this.

1082
00:59:01,741 --> 00:59:04,651
I know, but my eyes end up following it.

1083
00:59:05,051 --> 00:59:07,080
Everyone in the audience is looking at you on stage,

1084
00:59:07,081 --> 00:59:08,550
so if you throw something,

1085
00:59:08,551 --> 00:59:11,220
everyone's attention will be disrupted by what you threw.

1086
00:59:11,221 --> 00:59:12,420
It didn't block you, though.

1087
00:59:12,421 --> 00:59:14,960
The audience's eyes will follow it.

1088
00:59:14,961 --> 00:59:16,591
If they were only filming you, you could do what you wanted.

1089
00:59:17,891 --> 00:59:18,891
We're going to be performing live here.

1090
00:59:20,961 --> 00:59:22,801
Are they fighting right now?

1091
00:59:23,201 --> 00:59:24,301
The rose...

1092
00:59:25,471 --> 00:59:27,841
- Look down. - He's so hung up on the rose.

1093
00:59:29,041 --> 00:59:32,910
It's my choice whether to throw it or not.

1094
00:59:32,911 --> 00:59:37,181
As long as it doesn't affect you by blocking you, as you said...

1095
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:40,711
Also, I didn't actually have to tell you about this.

1096
00:59:41,321 --> 00:59:42,321
Do whatever you want.

1097
00:59:44,491 --> 00:59:47,390
It's my part, but just because I didn't do as you said...

1098
00:59:47,391 --> 00:59:49,290
after you said you didn't like what I was doing,

1099
00:59:49,291 --> 00:59:52,390
is it okay for you to sit there with a nasty face and ruin the mood?

1100
00:59:52,391 --> 00:59:53,460
I didn't ruin the mood.

1101
00:59:53,461 --> 00:59:54,700
Did you or didn't you have a nasty look on your face?

1102
00:59:54,701 --> 00:59:56,161
- I did. - Did you or didn't you?

1103
00:59:57,431 --> 00:59:59,570
- So what do you want me to do? - I don't care what you do.

1104
00:59:59,571 --> 01:00:01,400
Stop fighting. It doesn't look good.

1105
01:00:01,401 --> 01:00:03,500
It's not a matter of fighting or not. It's my part.

1106
01:00:03,501 --> 01:00:07,571
I think... Actually, our team...

1107
01:00:07,741 --> 01:00:10,040
didn't have much time to practice in the first place.

1108
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:12,050
Because of that argument,

1109
01:00:12,051 --> 01:00:13,851
we wasted a lot of time.

1110
01:00:16,381 --> 01:00:19,721
I will do my best and show everyone my own style.

1111
01:00:23,061 --> 01:00:25,031
- Here he is. He Zhong Xing is here. - Finally.

1112
01:00:25,791 --> 01:00:27,730
- He brought the rose. - He does have the rose.

1113
01:00:27,731 --> 01:00:29,231
The rose. The rose is here.

1114
01:00:29,361 --> 01:00:30,531
He didn't throw it out.

1115
01:00:31,331 --> 01:00:32,331
Rose man.

1116
01:00:37,441 --> 01:00:39,371
Zhong Xing has to be at the center and bring everything together.

1136
01:04:35,841 --> 01:04:38,280
Zhong Xing prepared a lot of things.

1137

The rose, lipstick,

1138
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:42,080
and the facial expressions.

1139
01:04:42,081 --> 01:04:45,290
Those things must be considered greatly as an idol,

1140
01:04:45,291 --> 01:04:47,121
but if he had time to prepare for those things,

1141
01:04:47,221 --> 01:04:49,921
he should've spent more time practicing his singing.

1142
01:04:50,021 --> 01:04:51,121
- Right. - Right.

1143
01:04:51,231 --> 01:04:53,091

1185

I can definitely accept being the leader,

1186

if Su Ren is okay with it, we should change our leader.

01:09:40,581 --> 01:09:42,081
Right! This is what it's like.

1237
01:09:42,151 --> 01:09:43,721
(I got it.)

1238
01:09:44,151 --> 01:09:47,021
(How is Li Zi Hao's version?)

1239
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:49,020
(He just becomes a log of wood.)

1240
01:09:49,021 --> 01:09:50,791
(This isn't it.)

1241
01:09:50,891 --> 01:09:54,661
(Same choreography, different vibes)

1242
01:09:54,731 --> 01:09:56,501
This part has to feel sexy.

1243
01:09:58,671 --> 01:10:00,931
- I'll face forward. - Right. Like this.

1244
01:10:01,171 --> 01:10:03,101
(Sexy?)

1245
01:10:03,901 --> 01:10:06,741
(It feels scary instead of feeling sexy.)

1246
01:10:06,971 --> 01:10:09,241
(I'm scared.)

1247
01:10:10,811 --> 01:10:12,311
That isn't it.

1248
01:10:12,451 --> 01:10:15,021
He leads the team well...

1249
01:10:15,581 --> 01:10:17,921
and sets the right atmosphere.

1250
01:10:18,151 --> 01:10:21,521
I love him! He's the best!

1251
01:10:22,421 --> 01:10:25,130
After this, we stop.

1252
01:10:25,131 --> 01:10:27,030
Then we go, 1, 2, 3.

1253
01:10:27,031 --> 01:10:28,860
- I see. - We could do this instead.

1254
01:10:28,861 --> 01:10:30,830
- Right. - Should we try? Let's try it.

1255
01:10:30,831 --> 01:10:32,971
Okay. I decide with my own hands

1258
01:10:36,902 --> 01:10:37,941
- It's okay. - Let's clap.

1259
01:10:38,441 --> 01:10:39,611
We can do this.

1260
01:10:39,811 --> 01:10:42,541
(They work on the choreography once again.)

1261
01:10:42,611 --> 01:10:43,640
A round of applause.

1262
01:10:43,641 --> 01:10:44,981
(A round of applause for the good idea)

1263
01:10:45,081 --> 01:10:47,711
- Nice one! - You're starting to show yourself!

1264
01:10:47,751 --> 01:10:49,180
Clap!

1265
01:10:49,181 --> 01:10:50,421
You're doing great, sir.

1266
01:10:50,521 --> 01:10:51,621
I love you, sir!

1267
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:59,091
(The practice session continues to go smoothly.)

1268
01:10:59,761 --> 01:11:01,560
- Gosh, Reeonn! - Reeonn!

1269
01:11:01,561 --> 01:11:03,430
You look handsome!

1270
01:11:03,431 --> 01:11:05,431
- You look amazing. - Clap for his great looks!

1271
01:11:05,531 --> 01:11:08,071
He's really good-looking.

1272
01:11:09,371 --> 01:11:10,740
You're a winner with your face.

1273
01:11:10,741 --> 01:11:12,740
(But don't forget that you're the face of Team 1, Li Zi Hao.)

1274
01:11:12,741 --> 01:11:14,340
- Let's go. - Let's start from the top.

1275
01:11:14,341 --> 01:11:17,941
(Team 1 works hard to practice after the leader change.)

1276
01:11:22,051 --> 01:11:23,080
Let's go! Hey!

1277
01:11:23,081 --> 01:11:24,620
(Team 2 naturally looks at them with their change in atmosphere.)

1278
01:11:24,621 --> 01:11:26,451
(Looking intently)

1279
01:11:26,521 --> 01:11:29,661
Okay. We're almost there.

1280
01:11:30,521 --> 01:11:33,331
I believe it's already game over.

1281
01:11:33,591 --> 01:11:36,000
And 1, 2, clap, clap.

1282
01:11:36,001 --> 01:11:38,700
I felt their talent while working with them.

1283
01:11:38,701 --> 01:11:40,131
"Done. These guys are good."

1284
01:11:42,471 --> 01:11:45,741
I think it'll be great if we can just prove ourselves on stage.

1285
01:11:47,411 --> 01:11:48,681
Let's gather together for a chant.

1286
01:11:49,141 --> 01:11:50,181
Guys,

1287
01:11:50,481 --> 01:11:53,110
- we're almost there. - Right.

1288
01:11:53,111 --> 01:11:55,281
You all went through so much and thank you for trusting me.

1289
01:11:55,551 --> 01:11:57,050
I felt really happy to be a team with you guys.

1290
01:11:57,051 --> 01:11:59,021
- We were happy too. - All right. Let's kill it.

1291
01:11:59,051 --> 01:12:01,121
- Okay. - One, two, three, up!

1292
01:12:01,291 --> 01:12:03,291
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1293
01:12:06,361 --> 01:12:09,001
We will try to win with our great energy.

1294
01:12:10,261 --> 01:12:13,301
Team One will never lose.

1295
01:12:14,931 --> 01:12:16,471
I wish for Team One to go forever.

1296
01:12:17,201 --> 01:12:18,941
I will help us win. Let's go!

01:16:09,471 --> 01:16:11,000
- They were good. - They looked more like a team.

01:16:11,001 --> 01:16:12,011
They are a team.

1328
01:16:12,171 --> 01:16:13,341

I think they thought a lot...

to make sure each person looked good.

1332
01:16:19,651 --> 01:16:22,221
It shows that they put a lot of thought into it.

1333
01:16:22,421 --> 01:16:24,181
It leaves a lot of impression. Is it just me that feels that way?

I felt it too.

01:19:19,591 --> 01:19:23,160
that won the 2021 MAMA Rookie of the Year Award...

1409
01:19:23,161 --> 01:19:24,301
(Yumeki)

1410
01:19:25,531 --> 01:19:26,631
and the MAMA Grand Award just three years after their debut.

1411
01:19:29,201 --> 01:19:31,701
What's a "whiplash?" Is it a whip?

1412
01:19:32,241 --> 01:19:33,370
It means whipping,

1413
01:19:33,371 --> 01:19:34,740
and it also means when you get into a car accident,

1414
01:19:34,741 --> 01:19:36,611
- Yes. Whiplash. - your neck snaps back.

1415
01:19:36,741 --> 01:19:40,110
It means when I walk by, people will look at me like that.

1416
01:19:40,111 --> 01:19:41,980
Then does it mean that people show...

1417
01:19:41,981 --> 01:19:43,521
an interest that would snap their necks?

1418
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:45,850
That's why they hold onto their necks.

1419
01:19:45,851 --> 01:19:47,691
It's a dance that means your neck hurts.

1420
01:19:48,791 --> 01:19:50,860
(Team 1 and Team 2 for "Whiplash" that would pull the neck of...)

1421
01:19:50,861 --> 01:19:54,591
(the Star Creators make their appearance.)

1422
01:19:56,961 --> 01:19:59,270
(An enthusiastic cheer for the "Whiplash" teams)

1423
01:19:59,271 --> 01:20:00,371
They are here.

1424
01:20:00,731 --> 01:20:01,831
- Gosh. - Gosh.

1425
01:20:05,441 --> 01:20:08,270
(We can't help with holding the back of the neck.)

1426
01:20:08,271 --> 01:20:09,981
They are competing against each other, leaving their ranks behind.

1427
01:20:11,481 --> 01:20:14,711
Team 1, please introduce yourselves, 1st.

1428
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:19,321
We are Team Win-plash who would like to become the first place...

1429
01:20:19,851 --> 01:20:21,991
in the hearts of the Star Creators.

1430
01:20:22,091 --> 01:20:23,360
(Sang Won)

1431
01:20:23,361 --> 01:20:24,391
Go guys!

1432
01:20:25,061 --> 01:20:26,260
They are the Avengers.

1433
01:20:26,261 --> 01:20:27,961
They are so strong. This is unbelievable.

1434
01:20:28,261 --> 01:20:30,000
(When selecting the team members)

1435
01:20:30,001 --> 01:20:31,500
(Participant Yumeki formed Team 1 for "Whiplash...")

1436
01:20:31,501 --> 01:20:33,671
(with the best combination of members.)

1437
01:20:35,371 --> 01:20:38,601
In this Win-plash team, I...

1438
01:20:39,671 --> 01:20:40,970
(Lee Sang Won)

1439
01:20:40,971 --> 01:20:43,381
I am an unrivaled...

1440
01:20:43,711 --> 01:20:45,681
He's very nervous.

1441
01:20:46,181 --> 01:20:47,350
Unrivaled.

1442
01:20:47,351 --> 01:20:51,121
I joined this team to deliver a killing part like no other.

1443
01:20:51,481 --> 01:20:53,190
I am Lee Sang Won, in charge of the killing part position.

1444
01:20:53,191 --> 01:20:54,221
I hope you enjoy my performance.

1445
01:20:54,621 --> 01:20:56,391
(Congratulations on your first stage performance, Sang Won.)

1446
01:20:56,661 --> 01:20:59,691
Team 2 for 1 Star. Please introduce yourselves as well.

1447
01:21:00,391 --> 01:21:02,331
Hello, we are...

1448
01:21:02,461 --> 01:21:04,501
- Aesparta. - Aesparta.

1449
01:21:06,771 --> 01:21:08,800
It's nice to see you.

1450
01:21:08,801 --> 01:21:09,801
(I ripped the paper because I like Seung Baek so much.)

1451
01:21:09,802 --> 01:21:13,611
Hello, I'm the tallest killing part in Team Aesparta,

1452
01:21:13,971 --> 01:21:15,111
Kim Daniel.

1453
01:21:17,941 --> 01:21:20,251
The looks of the members of Team 1 are so good that it's scary.

1454
01:21:20,411 --> 01:21:21,511
It's scary.

1455
01:21:21,611 --> 01:21:23,851
- They are the Avengers. - Yes. The Avengers.

1456
01:21:24,251 --> 01:21:25,751
Were they at that level during the rehearsals?

1457
01:21:28,151 --> 01:21:30,861
("Whiplash" Team 1 Rehearsal)

1458
01:21:31,461 --> 01:21:36,261
(In the middle of rehearsal for "Whiplash" Team 1)

1459
01:21:39,901 --> 01:21:43,971
(They showed a performance that was not in sync.)

1460
01:21:45,911 --> 01:21:50,481
(The rehearsal ended with regrets.)

1461
01:21:50,741 --> 01:21:52,381
- That was it. - That's a bit disappointing.

1462
01:21:52,881 --> 01:21:55,181
They were not clean. It's disappointing.

1463
01:21:55,281 --> 01:21:57,181
- They were. - For All Stars?

1464
01:21:59,191 --> 01:22:02,591
(Masters Kany and KINKY came to see "Whiplash" Team 1.)

1465
01:22:02,991 --> 01:22:04,191
What happened today?

1466
01:22:05,021 --> 01:22:06,061
Seriously.

1467
01:22:09,001 --> 01:22:10,631
Really, get your heads into it.

1468
01:22:12,371 --> 01:22:13,571
You guys are All Stars.

1469
01:22:14,301 --> 01:22:17,101
It didn't feel like an All Star performance.

1470
01:22:18,171 --> 01:22:19,211
Really.

1471
01:22:20,611 --> 01:22:22,841
I'm really disappointed. Honestly.

1472
01:22:27,251 --> 01:22:29,751
(After the rehearsal)

1473
01:22:30,721 --> 01:22:32,590
It was just our first time.

1474
01:22:32,591 --> 01:22:33,750
(Yumeki showed tears.)

1475
01:22:33,751 --> 01:22:36,791
Seeing Yumeki crying,

1476
01:22:37,091 --> 01:22:38,561
I felt really bad.

1477
01:22:39,191 --> 01:22:41,761
I thought "Was I not enough for the killing part position?"

1478
01:22:43,661 --> 01:22:45,871
(What happened to Team 1 for "Whiplash?")

1479
01:22:46,771 --> 01:22:49,040
(Dance training for "Whiplash")

1480
01:22:49,041 --> 01:22:50,170
(The original creator of the choreography for "Whiplash")

1481
01:22:50,171 --> 01:22:51,841
(They are performing in front of Master KINKY.)

1482
01:22:52,911 --> 01:22:55,371
(A smooth start)

1483
01:23:01,281 --> 01:23:05,651
(Lee Sang Won's killing part follows.)

1484
01:23:09,661 --> 01:23:12,561
(Sang Won misses the beat while being at the very front.)

1485
01:23:16,861 --> 01:23:18,300
May I see it one more time?

1486
01:23:18,301 --> 01:23:19,731
- Okay. - Okay.

1487
01:23:19,831 --> 01:23:21,771
(The 2nd attempt)

1488
01:23:27,411 --> 01:23:29,141
(KINKY's facial expression turns serious.)

1489
01:23:32,611 --> 01:23:33,680
Just one more time.

1490
01:23:33,681 --> 01:23:34,711
- Okay. - Okay.

1491
01:23:46,961 --> 01:23:49,360
(What will be the feedback...)

1492
01:23:49,361 --> 01:23:51,761
(by the original choreographer, KINKY?)

1493
01:23:56,271 --> 01:23:58,541
What was Sang Won's killing part?

1494
01:23:59,271 --> 01:24:00,341
This one.

1495
01:24:02,511 --> 01:24:05,611
I kept thinking, "Which one is the killing part?"

1496
01:24:06,581 --> 01:24:11,281
It didn't have the taste of the killing part whatsoever.

1497
01:24:13,121 --> 01:24:14,891
That was why I made you guys dance three times.

1498
01:24:14,991 --> 01:24:18,861
Something should've changed during those three times.

1499
01:24:18,961 --> 01:24:21,890
But you guys showed me the same thing three times.

1500
01:24:21,891 --> 01:24:23,701
The energy level fell as you guys went on.

1501
01:24:24,901 --> 01:24:27,271
Be on your toes when you guys perform.

1502
01:24:28,001 --> 01:24:30,871
(The training session ends with KINKY's criticism.)

1503
01:24:31,801 --> 01:24:34,211
(After the training session, )

1504
01:24:35,171 --> 01:24:38,311
(Sang Won stands at a corner.)

1505
01:24:39,281 --> 01:24:45,721
(It's the hideout Sang Won visits when he needs some alone time.)

1506
01:24:47,721 --> 01:24:50,861
I feel like I need to do better as someone with the killing part.

1507
01:24:50,961 --> 01:24:54,591
Because of that, I become more nervous and timid.

1508
01:24:55,461 --> 01:24:57,601
I can't show off my talent.

1509
01:24:59,001 --> 01:25:03,371
(The pressure of needing to do well made him timid.)

1510
01:25:08,041 --> 01:25:09,681
What am I supposed to do?

1511
01:25:13,811 --> 01:25:17,581
(The peer review for "Whiplash" Team 1 begins.)

1512
01:25:24,891 --> 01:25:26,131
(Oh, my!)

1513
01:25:29,361 --> 01:25:30,431
He has a nice voice.

1514
01:25:37,901 --> 01:25:40,340
(Team Avengers, "Whiplash" Team 1 gets good reactions.)

1515
01:25:40,341 --> 01:25:41,541
Zhou An Xin!

1516
01:25:42,141 --> 01:25:44,281
Zhou An Xin sang exactly in tune.

1517
01:25:44,381 --> 01:25:46,950
His voice suits the song. He sings it well.

1518
01:25:46,951 --> 01:25:48,011
He's good.

1519
01:25:50,181 --> 01:25:54,550
Firstly, the number one participant is Zhou An Xin.

1520
01:25:54,551 --> 01:25:56,991
"His vocals are solid. His voice suits the song."

1521
01:25:57,861 --> 01:25:59,461
The number one participant is Zhou An Xin.

1522
01:26:00,191 --> 01:26:03,361
"He showed his singing skills. He can also act."

1523
01:26:03,461 --> 01:26:04,901
The number one participant is Zhou An Xin again.

1524
01:26:06,201 --> 01:26:07,871
- Seriously. - How is he so good?

1525
01:26:08,271 --> 01:26:10,041
"The live singing was steady."

1526
01:26:11,101 --> 01:26:13,110
The number one participant is Zhou An Xin.

1527
01:26:13,111 --> 01:26:15,740
The number one participant is Zhou An Xin.

1528
01:26:15,741 --> 01:26:17,311
The number one participant is Zhou An Xin.

1529
01:26:17,411 --> 01:26:19,351
The number one participant is Zhou An Xin.

1530
01:26:19,451 --> 01:26:22,110
The reason is, "His voice stood out during the killing part."

1531
01:26:22,111 --> 01:26:23,151
"He sang well."

1532
01:26:23,251 --> 01:26:24,750
Even though it wasn't a killing part,

1533
01:26:24,751 --> 01:26:26,451
he turned it into one.

1534
01:26:27,191 --> 01:26:28,751
That was a nice summary.

1535
01:26:29,391 --> 01:26:31,121
The worst participant is Sang Won.

1536
01:26:31,291 --> 01:26:33,231
What? Really?

1537
01:26:33,631 --> 01:26:36,861
The reason is, "He was below expectations."

1538
01:26:40,531 --> 01:26:42,901
We received peer review and went through the feedback.

1539
01:26:43,101 --> 01:26:46,240
There was some truth in the feedback.

1540
01:26:46,241 --> 01:26:47,271
(Sang Won hangs his head.)

1541
01:26:51,511 --> 01:26:54,081
(He's deep in thought in his hideout again.)

1542
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:58,181
I'm the one who is lacking, so I have no excuses to give.

1543
01:26:59,821 --> 01:27:02,891
I thought Zhou An Xin suited the killing part.

1544
01:27:04,321 --> 01:27:06,461
I thought that I'd need to let go of the killing part.

1545
01:27:09,701 --> 01:27:12,900
(After some alone time, )

1546
01:27:12,901 --> 01:27:16,100
(Sang Won calls over Kim Jun Seo, Yumeki, and Lee Leo.)

1547
01:27:16,101 --> 01:27:18,740
All the teammates are good,

1548
01:27:18,741 --> 01:27:19,910
so I'm very thankful.

1549
01:27:19,911 --> 01:27:23,210
But I feel like I'm very lacking as someone with the killing part.

1550
01:27:23,211 --> 01:27:24,411
You feel like you're very lacking.

1551
01:27:24,611 --> 01:27:26,150
"Is it okay for the killing part to be like this?"

1552
01:27:26,151 --> 01:27:28,681
I had that thought by myself.

1553
01:27:29,921 --> 01:27:31,250
In the feedback,

1554
01:27:31,251 --> 01:27:33,920
- Zhou An Xin was mentioned a lot. - Right.

1555
01:27:33,921 --> 01:27:35,790
- He was mentioned more than me. - Right.

1556
01:27:35,791 --> 01:27:40,190
- So... - You know, about that matter...

1557
01:27:40,191 --> 01:27:41,860
I never thought...

1558
01:27:41,861 --> 01:27:45,001
that we needed to change who got to do the killing part.

1559
01:27:46,731 --> 01:27:48,231
This is what I want to say.

1560
01:27:49,301 --> 01:27:51,071
We truly believe in you.

1561
01:27:53,441 --> 01:27:54,870
We believe in you.

1562
01:27:54,871 --> 01:27:58,981
I hope you'll believe in yourself a bit more.

1563
01:28:01,911 --> 01:28:04,880
I hope you'll believe in yourself a bit more.

1564
01:28:04,881 --> 01:28:06,351
(Zhou An Xin watches them from a distance.)

1565
01:28:07,321 --> 01:28:09,721
(During a break)

1566
01:28:10,861 --> 01:28:13,161
The teacher is here. Hello.

1567
01:28:13,691 --> 01:28:16,560
- My vocal teacher. Hello. - Are you doing well?

1568
01:28:16,561 --> 01:28:17,561
(An Xin approaches Sang Won and jokes around.)

1569
01:28:18,031 --> 01:28:19,200
(He sits next to Sang Won.)

1570
01:28:19,201 --> 01:28:20,271
The class will begin.

1571
01:28:23,301 --> 01:28:25,170
(Smiling)

1572
01:28:25,171 --> 01:28:27,571
I hope Sang Won will cheer up.

1573
01:28:31,711 --> 01:28:34,851
(He acts cute for the older member who is feeling down.)

1574
01:28:34,951 --> 01:28:38,121
(He chit-chats nonstop by Sang Won's side.)

1575
01:28:40,021 --> 01:28:43,661
(He even makes a killer expression for the older member!)

1576
01:28:44,191 --> 01:28:47,761
An Xin was rooting for me. I was so grateful.

1577
01:28:48,131 --> 01:28:50,261
It made me less nervous.

1578
01:28:51,431 --> 01:28:53,601
I was feeling...

1579
01:28:54,101 --> 01:28:56,071
my shortcomings.

1580
01:28:57,641 --> 01:29:00,070
As the participant with the killing part,

1581
01:29:00,071 --> 01:29:03,441
I want to express it in a way that's more daring and confident.

1582
01:29:04,741 --> 01:29:08,311
I'll do my best to show my cool side.

1583
01:29:10,721 --> 01:29:12,150
I hope they do an amazing job.

1584
01:29:12,151 --> 01:29:13,421
I think they will.

1585
01:29:24,961 --> 01:29:26,101
Oh, my.

1586
01:29:28,801 --> 01:29:30,801
("Whiplash" by aespa)

1587
01:29:49,861 --> 01:29:50,921
That's sexy.

1588
01:30:09,741 --> 01:30:10,741
(Sang Won)

1589
01:30:20,651 --> 01:30:21,651
(Zhou An Xin)

1590
01:30:30,561 --> 01:30:31,901
Gosh, Sang Won.

1591
01:30:53,291 --> 01:30:54,351
That's terrific.

1592
01:31:00,761 --> 01:31:01,761
(Sang Won)

1593
01:31:07,901 --> 01:31:09,031
(Sang Won is insane.)

1594
01:31:28,051 --> 01:31:29,051
(Lee Sang Won)

1595
01:31:34,961 --> 01:31:35,961
(Lee Sang Won)

1596
01:31:53,251 --> 01:31:54,881
Leo is absolutely insane.

1597
01:32:02,721 --> 01:32:03,821
Here it comes!

1598
01:32:42,361 --> 01:32:43,701
My gosh.

1599
01:32:44,101 --> 01:32:45,101
All right.

1600
01:32:56,541 --> 01:32:59,311
(You can watch the full version on YouTube and Mnet Plus.)

1601
01:32:59,541 --> 01:33:00,681
(That was amazing.)

1602
01:33:00,751 --> 01:33:02,250
(All Star Kim Jun Seo)

1603
01:33:02,251 --> 01:33:03,680
(All Star Hsu Ching Yu)

1604
01:33:03,681 --> 01:33:05,220
(All Star Kim Geon Woo)

1605
01:33:05,221 --> 01:33:06,750
(All Star Yoon Min)

(All Star Zhou An Xin)

1609
01:33:11,861 --> 01:33:16,231
(All Star Lee Sang Won, killing part)

1610
01:33:20,631 --> 01:33:23,370
(Standing ovation)

1611
01:33:23,371 --> 01:33:24,541
Nice.

1612
01:33:25,871 --> 01:33:26,871
Hey, Lee Sang Won!

1613
01:33:28,711 --> 01:33:29,910
He's making my heart flutter.

1614
01:33:29,911 --> 01:33:31,080
(Laughing)

1615
01:33:31,081 --> 01:33:32,341
Lee Sang Won, he's seriously...

1616
01:33:33,511 --> 01:33:34,850
That's insane.

1617
01:33:34,851 --> 01:33:36,151
(Angry at his amazing performance)

1618
01:33:36,281 --> 01:33:37,350
- Gosh. - My gosh.

1619
01:33:37,351 --> 01:33:38,681
- His face is really... - He's different.

1620
01:33:38,981 --> 01:33:40,891
They're extremely competent and good-looking.

1621
01:33:41,391 --> 01:33:43,061
- Seriously. - They're legendary.

1622
01:33:43,221 --> 01:33:44,591
It's impossible to defeat them.

1623
01:33:45,191 --> 01:33:46,631
Daniel is in trouble.

1624
01:33:48,191 --> 01:33:49,931
Sang Won is...

1625
01:33:52,331 --> 01:33:53,731
He's very good.

1626
01:33:54,171 --> 01:33:56,171
- Sang Won? He's great. - Yes.

1627
01:33:58,141 --> 01:34:00,341
He killed all his parts, to be honest.

1628
01:34:02,071 --> 01:34:04,181
They're all strong individuals.

1629
01:34:05,311 --> 01:34:06,681
Well done.

1630
01:34:07,051 --> 01:34:08,150
("Whiplash" Team 1 comes down after their performance.)

1631
01:34:08,151 --> 01:34:10,751
- Good job. - Well done.

1632
01:34:11,321 --> 01:34:12,651
Well done.

1633
01:34:13,251 --> 01:34:14,490
Sang Won.

1634
01:34:14,491 --> 01:34:16,151
All of us worked very hard.

1635
01:34:17,461 --> 01:34:19,220
I was very happy...

1636
01:34:19,221 --> 01:34:21,291
to work with you. Good job, everyone.

1637
01:34:21,591 --> 01:34:22,691
Well done.

1638
01:34:23,361 --> 01:34:27,331
I want to tell them that they did a wonderful job.

1639
01:34:27,571 --> 01:34:30,271
Overall, we did much better...

1640
01:34:30,941 --> 01:34:32,601
than during practice.

1641
01:34:33,871 --> 01:34:35,241
The audience is cheering so loudly.

1642
01:34:35,671 --> 01:34:36,941
It's very loud.

1643
01:34:37,211 --> 01:34:38,981
Do it like you've lost it.

1644
01:34:39,381 --> 01:34:40,510
Lose yourselves.

1645
01:34:40,511 --> 01:34:41,851
- Lose ourselves? - Yes.

1646
01:34:41,951 --> 01:34:44,250
Guys, let's lose ourselves completely.

1647
01:34:44,251 --> 01:34:46,320
- Let's go. - We're going up.

1648
01:34:46,321 --> 01:34:47,691
- Whip, whiplash. - Whip, whiplash.

1649
01:34:51,861 --> 01:34:53,730
They'll need to liven up their spirit.

1650
01:34:53,731 --> 01:34:55,761
I mean, Team One Star.

1651
01:34:56,061 --> 01:34:58,031
They're competing against the Avengers team.

1652
01:34:58,231 --> 01:35:00,971
I'm worried about this team the most.

1653
01:35:02,231 --> 01:35:04,601
I'm worried about Daniel on this team.

1654
01:35:06,571 --> 01:35:08,040
(During the interim check)

1655
01:35:08,041 --> 01:35:09,911
("Whiplash" Team 2 is getting ready for the interim check.)

1656
01:35:10,481 --> 01:35:11,481
(Against Lee Sang Won of Team 1 who sings the killing part)

1657
01:35:11,482 --> 01:35:12,880
I'll stomp you effortlessly.

1658
01:35:12,881 --> 01:35:15,451
(Kim Daniel declared a powerful declaration of war.)

1659
01:35:15,851 --> 01:35:19,721
(How will "Whiplash" Team 2 perform?)

1660
01:35:21,351 --> 01:35:23,021
(Daniel misses the beat during the intro.)

1661
01:35:26,561 --> 01:35:28,391
(Team 2 gets off to a rocky start.)

1662
01:35:32,761 --> 01:35:34,331
(Daniel misses the beat during his part.)

1663
01:35:35,831 --> 01:35:39,601
(He's also off-key in his part.)

1664
01:35:41,041 --> 01:35:43,541
(Daniel doesn't sing his part.)

1665
01:35:47,051 --> 01:35:49,011
(They aren't in sync during the chorus.)

1666
01:35:49,921 --> 01:35:50,921
Goodness.

1667
01:35:53,291 --> 01:35:56,421
("Whiplash" Team 2's interim check is over.)

1668
01:35:56,921 --> 01:35:58,961
When the melody started,

1669
01:35:59,191 --> 01:36:01,690
Daniel missed the pitch.

1670
01:36:01,691 --> 01:36:03,131
And it threw everyone off.

1671
01:36:04,501 --> 01:36:05,501
You also missed the lyrics.

1672
01:36:06,631 --> 01:36:09,901
You have to keep dancing to the music.

1673
01:36:10,101 --> 01:36:11,670
Since the music keeps playing,

1674
01:36:11,671 --> 01:36:14,111
you need to practice while singing.

1675
01:36:14,741 --> 01:36:16,981
At this rate, I can't give you any feedback.

1676
01:36:19,481 --> 01:36:21,281
("Whiplash" Team 2 gathered in the practice room the next day.)

1677
01:36:22,711 --> 01:36:25,121
(Leader Bang Jun Hyuk is checking something.)

1678
01:36:25,351 --> 01:36:28,121
The participant at the bottom is Kim Daniel.

1679
01:36:29,861 --> 01:36:30,991
(During the peer review a few hours ago)

1680
01:36:32,221 --> 01:36:36,331
(Kim Daniel missed the beat even during the peer review.)

1681
01:36:38,701 --> 01:36:40,170
"Daniel was at the bottom."

1682
01:36:40,171 --> 01:36:41,631
"He made a lot of mistakes in the center."

1683
01:36:41,901 --> 01:36:43,840
"The participant at the bottom was Kim Daniel."

1684
01:36:43,841 --> 01:36:45,640
"He's not confident about his killing part."

1685
01:36:45,641 --> 01:36:47,110
"He doesn't have any presence."

1686
01:36:47,111 --> 01:36:48,710
"Daniel was at the bottom."

1687
01:36:48,711 --> 01:36:50,581
"Daniel was at the bottom."

1688
01:36:50,841 --> 01:36:52,411
"I just don't know what he did."

1689
01:36:53,511 --> 01:36:56,481
(Many participants picked Daniel as the worst one.)

1690
01:37:00,821 --> 01:37:02,591
Tell me honestly.

1691
01:37:03,461 --> 01:37:05,621
Do you think we should change...

1692
01:37:06,161 --> 01:37:07,961
the parts?

1693
01:37:08,361 --> 01:37:10,660
- Today... - Why does...

1694
01:37:10,661 --> 01:37:12,830
Kim Daniel have the killing part?

1695
01:37:12,831 --> 01:37:13,831
(Rensho is under the blanket.)

1696
01:37:13,832 --> 01:37:16,871
I picked based on the person's potential and my feelings.

1697
01:37:17,171 --> 01:37:19,271
I picked him without watching him dance.

1698
01:37:19,941 --> 01:37:22,471
We picked him for the killing part...

1699
01:37:22,741 --> 01:37:24,681
based on our feelings.

1700
01:37:25,011 --> 01:37:26,951
(While assigning parts)

1701
01:37:27,881 --> 01:37:29,651
(All the participants wanted the killing part.)

1702
01:37:30,381 --> 01:37:35,021
(The killing part test was based only on singing and the presence.)

1703
01:37:35,191 --> 01:37:37,561
(Bang Jun Hyuk assigned the killing part to Kim Daniel.)

1704
01:37:37,761 --> 01:37:40,530
Considering the overall picture,

1705
01:37:40,531 --> 01:37:42,760
it would be good to reassign...

1706
01:37:42,761 --> 01:37:45,261
the killing part to someone who can do it better.

1707
01:37:47,471 --> 01:37:49,470
(There's serious tension around "Whiplash" Team 2.)

1708
01:37:49,471 --> 01:37:53,071
We should reconsider who sings the killing part.

1709
01:37:54,471 --> 01:37:57,141
(Team 2 starts to discuss their parts again.)

1710
01:37:57,241 --> 01:37:59,481
There could be someone much better.

1711
01:38:00,651 --> 01:38:01,881
Who wants to sing the killing part?

1712
01:38:03,081 --> 01:38:05,551
(Lee Seung Baek volunteers for the killing part.)

1713
01:38:06,721 --> 01:38:08,190
To be honest,

1714
01:38:08,191 --> 01:38:10,291
I'd also like to sing the killing part.

1715
01:38:11,021 --> 01:38:13,461
(Leader Bang Jun Hyuk is deep in thought.)

1716
01:38:13,731 --> 01:38:15,230
I'd like to recommend...

1717
01:38:15,231 --> 01:38:17,231
Rensho and Seung Baek.

1718
01:38:17,261 --> 01:38:19,800
Rensho and Seung Baek are great dancers.

1719
01:38:19,801 --> 01:38:22,300
(Rensho and Seung Baek have been leading dancers.)

1720
01:38:22,301 --> 01:38:25,041
(Practicing the next part, teaching them the choreography)

1721
01:38:25,241 --> 01:38:27,441
(During the chorus choreography where the team had been lost, )

1722
01:38:27,571 --> 01:38:29,641
(Rensho was the only one who was on the beat.)

1723
01:38:29,771 --> 01:38:33,351
(Lee Seung Baek learned his part silently without mistakes.)

1724
01:38:33,581 --> 01:38:37,181
(The two of them got compliments from the Masters.)

1725
01:38:37,651 --> 01:38:39,650
(They decide to reassign the killing part.)

1726
01:38:39,651 --> 01:38:41,491
(Killing part nominee 1, Rensho)

1727
01:38:43,821 --> 01:38:47,291
(Killing part nominee 2, Lee Seung Baek)

1728
01:38:49,091 --> 01:38:52,701
(Killing part nominee 3, Kim Daniel)

1729
01:38:56,201 --> 01:38:57,670
(What will be Leader Bang Jun Hyuk's choice?)

1730
01:38:57,671 --> 01:39:00,211
In my opinion, the killing part goes to...

1731
01:39:07,051 --> 01:39:08,110
Kim Daniel.

1732
01:39:08,111 --> 01:39:11,421
(He keeps Kim Daniel as the killing part singer.)

1733
01:39:12,951 --> 01:39:15,490
The presence of his body...

1734
01:39:15,491 --> 01:39:18,621
matches well with the song "Whiplash."

1735
01:39:19,421 --> 01:39:20,961
He has good facial expressions.

1736
01:39:21,561 --> 01:39:24,330
To be honest, you aren't good enough yet.

1737
01:39:24,331 --> 01:39:27,031
If he improves his skills,

1738
01:39:27,471 --> 01:39:30,541
he'd have what it takes to sing the killing part.

1739
01:39:31,001 --> 01:39:33,201
Let's go with this.

1740
01:39:37,941 --> 01:39:39,081
We can't do anything about it.

1741
01:39:39,741 --> 01:39:41,311
It's what the leader said.

1742
01:39:43,581 --> 01:39:46,851
Both Seung Baek and Rensho were disappointed.

1743
01:39:47,921 --> 01:39:50,591
My part isn't very long.

1744
01:39:52,191 --> 01:39:54,790
(The 3rd sub-vocalist, Lee Seung Baek sings 8 seconds.)

1745
01:39:54,791 --> 01:39:57,101
(Sub-rapper Rensho sings 7 seconds.)

1746
01:39:58,101 --> 01:40:02,171
(The reassignment of parts ended regretfully.)

1747
01:40:04,941 --> 01:40:08,171
After one of my insignificant performances,

1748
01:40:08,241 --> 01:40:09,371
if I am sent home...

1749
01:40:09,811 --> 01:40:11,641
Your rankings are 1st, 2nd...

1750
01:40:11,911 --> 01:40:14,311
(Unlike Team 1 with many All Star participants)

1751
01:40:15,751 --> 01:40:20,990
(Rensho and Lee Seung Baek at the risk of being eliminated)

1752
01:40:20,991 --> 01:40:24,761
(They were at risk of elimination based on the global voting.)

1753
01:40:24,991 --> 01:40:27,461
- Your mentality... - I'm having a breakdown.

1754
01:40:28,961 --> 01:40:33,231
I thought that I was in a serious situation.

1755
01:40:34,301 --> 01:40:36,741
"What if I get eliminated and sent home?"

1756
01:40:37,701 --> 01:40:39,570
I'm quite scared.

1757
01:40:39,571 --> 01:40:40,711
(That's why they went after the killing part.)

1758
01:40:41,941 --> 01:40:43,841
(Their practice resumes.)

1759
01:40:44,381 --> 01:40:46,340
Up to that point,

1760
01:40:46,341 --> 01:40:49,481
I hadn't shown that I was reliable enough for the killing part.

1761
01:40:49,711 --> 01:40:53,691
That's why the topic of reassignment came up.

1762
01:40:54,421 --> 01:40:55,850
To be honest,

1763
01:40:55,851 --> 01:40:57,961
I felt very angry at myself.

1764
01:41:01,991 --> 01:41:04,761
(The pressure from the killing part discouraged Kim Daniel.)

1765
01:41:06,461 --> 01:41:08,531
Come and practice. Get up.

1766
01:41:09,231 --> 01:41:10,901
- You have to get up. - Get up.

1767
01:41:11,571 --> 01:41:13,611
- Hey, get up. - Okay.

1768
01:41:13,941 --> 01:41:15,240
Go and practice.

1769
01:41:15,241 --> 01:41:18,411
(Rensho and Lee Seung Baek encourage Kim Daniel.)

1770
01:41:18,541 --> 01:41:19,541
Okay.

1771
01:41:22,111 --> 01:41:24,221
When you're in a team,

1772
01:41:24,981 --> 01:41:28,090
maintaining a strong mentality is...

1773
01:41:28,091 --> 01:41:29,421
important.

1774
01:41:30,561 --> 01:41:33,530
It was decided that Daniel would sing the killing part.

1775
01:41:33,531 --> 01:41:37,231
After getting a clear result...

1776
01:41:37,631 --> 01:41:39,500
Daniel, get up.

1777
01:41:39,501 --> 01:41:40,501
(Rensho comforted Daniel who was having a hard time.)

1778
01:41:40,502 --> 01:41:41,870
Go and practice.

1779
01:41:41,871 --> 01:41:43,271
I trust Daniel.

1780
01:41:43,601 --> 01:41:45,871
So that Daniel can win...

1781
01:41:46,071 --> 01:41:47,840
If we support each other...

1782
01:41:47,841 --> 01:41:49,771
and practice a lot...

1783
01:41:52,441 --> 01:41:54,851
I know that our opponent team is strong,

1784
01:41:55,611 --> 01:41:58,921
but we also have a good chance of winning.

1785
01:42:00,191 --> 01:42:01,521
As much as they trusted me...

1786
01:42:02,951 --> 01:42:04,121
I'll just have to win.

1787
01:42:05,361 --> 01:42:06,621
I'll give it a go.

1788
01:42:07,861 --> 01:42:10,401
I will make sure to live up to that potential.

1789
01:42:14,931 --> 01:42:16,771
They must be very nervous.

1790
01:42:16,801 --> 01:42:18,240
It's the team I'm most worried about.

1791
01:42:18,241 --> 01:42:20,971
I'm very worried.

1792
01:42:21,041 --> 01:42:22,841
They have to put in their everything.

1793
01:42:23,111 --> 01:42:25,041
Let's see the rise of the One Stars.

1794
01:42:25,141 --> 01:42:27,351
Let's win! Beat the Avengers!

1795
01:42:28,451 --> 01:42:30,320
(What performance will 1 Star Team 2 present...)

1796
01:42:30,321 --> 01:42:31,821
(against the All Star Avengers Team 2?)

What's that?

1801
01:43:52,331 --> 01:43:53,571
Come on! With power!

1802
01:44:10,721 --> 01:44:11,751
(Seung Baek)

1803
01:44:17,861 --> 01:44:18,861
What?

1804
01:44:20,361 --> 01:44:21,361
Goodness.

1805
01:44:23,491 --> 01:44:24,500
What's going on?

1806
01:44:24,501 --> 01:44:25,731
What happened to Daniel?

1807
01:44:25,761 --> 01:44:27,971
Wait. Who is he?

1808
01:44:32,201 --> 01:44:33,641
What's going on?

1809
01:44:38,011 --> 01:44:39,081
He's good.

1810
01:44:57,401 --> 01:44:58,501
Why are they so good?

1811
01:45:31,961 --> 01:45:32,961
Go!

1812
01:45:37,041 --> 01:45:38,371
Let's go!

1813
01:45:39,601 --> 01:45:41,311
Rensho has a great body!

1814
01:46:07,831 --> 01:46:09,430
(The blazing ENERGY of the boys...)

1815
01:46:09,431 --> 01:46:11,040
(striving to become a top K-POP boy group.)

What's going on?

1826
01:46:29,051 --> 01:46:30,390
("Whiplash" Team 2's performance captivated everyone.)

1827
01:46:30,391 --> 01:46:31,621
(The rise of the One Stars)

1828
01:46:31,661 --> 01:46:33,061
Amazing.

1829
01:46:34,161 --> 01:46:35,161
What?

1830
01:46:35,291 --> 01:46:36,590
They were really good.

1831
01:46:36,591 --> 01:46:38,001
It was worth all the practice.

1832
01:46:38,401 --> 01:46:40,231
Why is Rensho so good?

1833
01:46:40,431 --> 01:46:42,571
- Did Rensho draw those abs? - No idea.

1834
01:46:42,601 --> 01:46:44,100
- He doesn't have abs. - He had them.

1835
01:46:44,101 --> 01:46:45,401
- He had them? - He had them.

1836
01:46:45,871 --> 01:46:47,371
Rensho was legendary.

1837
01:46:47,471 --> 01:46:49,110
We should really clap for them.

1838
01:46:49,111 --> 01:46:50,711
That was amazing.

1839
01:46:51,011 --> 01:46:52,211
Goodness.

1840
01:46:52,881 --> 01:46:54,180
I don't know...

1841
01:46:54,181 --> 01:46:56,281
how many times Kany and I looked at each other.

1842
01:46:56,381 --> 01:46:57,721
Every time Daniel sang...

1843
01:46:59,251 --> 01:47:02,591
(Kim Daniel's singing skill improved so much.)

1844
01:47:02,721 --> 01:47:04,591
- What? - What happened to Daniel?

1845
01:47:05,221 --> 01:47:06,890
- Kany. - What?

1846
01:47:06,891 --> 01:47:08,991
- Did you see that? - Wait. Who is he?

1847
01:47:10,601 --> 01:47:12,201
Girl.

1848
01:47:12,561 --> 01:47:14,231
(Their signals become more aggressive.)

1849
01:47:14,831 --> 01:47:16,870
Either Daniel is better on stage,

1850
01:47:16,871 --> 01:47:19,001
or he practiced so much.

1851
01:47:19,501 --> 01:47:21,411
Good job, Daniel.

1852
01:47:21,941 --> 01:47:23,880
The gap between the teams...

1853
01:47:23,881 --> 01:47:25,540
could have been...

1854
01:47:25,541 --> 01:47:26,810
- the largest here. - Of course.

1855
01:47:26,811 --> 01:47:29,581
They improved so much. All of them.

1856
01:47:29,911 --> 01:47:31,150
I couldn't react at all.

1857
01:47:31,151 --> 01:47:32,881
- I was frozen. - Seriously.

1858
01:47:33,281 --> 01:47:34,520
- That's true. - The entire time.

1859
01:47:34,521 --> 01:47:36,691
We could give them the Most Improved Award.

1860
01:47:37,421 --> 01:47:38,661
Well done.

1861
01:47:39,691 --> 01:47:40,990
- Well done. - It feels great.

1862
01:47:40,991 --> 01:47:42,591
- Well done. - Well done.

1863
01:47:43,931 --> 01:47:46,061
I think we did our best...

1864
01:47:46,301 --> 01:47:48,701
while preparing the performance.

1865
01:47:48,801 --> 01:47:51,701
So I think we have a chance of winning today.

1866
01:47:51,871 --> 01:47:54,211
We'll get the benefit by winning...

1867
01:47:54,311 --> 01:47:55,841
and survive.

1868
01:47:56,011 --> 01:47:59,881
I want to survive and keep working hard.

1869
01:48:00,651 --> 01:48:02,981
I'm curious what the result will be.

1870
01:48:03,151 --> 01:48:05,180
I think they did better.

1871
01:48:05,181 --> 01:48:06,681
They performed better.

1872
01:48:07,081 --> 01:48:08,490
They did much better.

1873
01:48:08,491 --> 01:48:09,691
- They're good. - Yes.

1874
01:48:11,991 --> 01:48:13,891
- They did well. - That wasn't...

1875
01:48:14,331 --> 01:48:15,491
what I saw at the practice room.

1876
01:48:15,531 --> 01:48:18,501
It could be a bit dangerous.

1877
01:48:19,831 --> 01:48:21,401
("Whiplash" Team 1 and Team 2 are waiting for the results.)

1878
01:48:21,431 --> 01:48:22,631
Why did you...

1879
01:48:24,001 --> 01:48:26,001
Why did you do well today?

1880
01:48:26,441 --> 01:48:27,870
- I think... - What good is that?

1881
01:48:27,871 --> 01:48:29,611
You should have done well on other days too.

1882
01:48:30,311 --> 01:48:31,780
- The team did well. - So well.

1883
01:48:31,781 --> 01:48:33,141
You all did so well.

1884
01:48:35,511 --> 01:48:39,121

(Main vocalist Zhou An Xin of Team 1 versus Fan Zhe Yi of Team 2)

1886
01:48:41,851 --> 01:48:43,391
An Xin would win, right?

1887
01:48:43,651 --> 01:48:44,961
Let's go, Fan Zhe Yi!

1888
01:48:46,721 --> 01:48:47,831

1892
01:48:56,131 --> 01:48:58,741
I'm curious how many votes Sang Won got.

(Third sub-vocalist Lee Sang Won of Team 2...)

1894
01:49:00,271 --> 01:49:01,641
(versus Lee Seung Baek of Team 2)

1895
01:49:02,071 --> 01:49:03,980
He killed all his parts, to be honest.

1896
01:49:03,981 --> 01:49:05,741
(Everyone is curious about Lee Sang Won's result.)

1897
01:49:05,941 --> 01:49:07,450
- His skills are just great. - He's amazing.

1898
01:49:07,451 --> 01:49:09,011
It was legendary.

1899
01:49:09,181 --> 01:49:10,681
How are we going to win against that?

1900
01:49:10,951 --> 01:49:13,551
(What score did Lee Sang Won get?)

1901
01:49:13,621 --> 01:49:15,021
One hundred and seventy votes.

1902
01:49:15,251 --> 01:49:16,491
No. Just 200 votes.

1903
01:49:16,851 --> 01:49:18,190
The first 200 votes?

1904
01:49:18,191 --> 01:49:19,661
- Did he get 200 votes? - The 1st person to get 200 votes?

1905
01:49:20,261 --> 01:49:22,631
- I think I'll get 5 points. - It's the birth of a legend.

1906
01:49:22,691 --> 01:49:25,001
(The participants expect a big difference in scores.)

(Third sub-vocalist Lee Sang Won of All Star Team 1 wins.)

1909
01:49:29,431 --> 01:49:30,641
It's not...

1910
01:49:32,341 --> 01:49:35,311
(The score gap is smaller than expected.)

1911
01:49:36,571 --> 01:49:38,981
- It's not that... - Fifty-seven.

1912
01:49:39,681 --> 01:49:41,480

1913
01:49:41,481 --> 01:49:43,610

1914
01:49:43,611 --> 01:49:45,421
You received many votes.

1915

(Team 1 is in the lead with 2 wins.)

1917
01:49:49,451 --> 01:49:50,960

1921

Sun Jia Yang did well.

1922
01:50:01,471 --> 01:50:03,001
It would be troublesome if Hsu Ching Yu lost.

1923
01:50:03,431 --> 01:50:05,301
(What are the results?)

1924
01:50:05,371 --> 01:50:06,570
(Hsu Ching Yu versus Sun Jia Yang)

1925

(Gaping)

1928
01:50:20,621 --> 01:50:22,851
- Well done. - It's okay.

1929
01:50:23,051 --> 01:50:26,921
(Team 1 is flustered by the unexpected defeat.)

1930
01:50:28,091 --> 01:50:29,461
(The results of the 1st sub-rappers is revealed next.)

Who will win?

1932
01:50:31,301 --> 01:50:32,630
Jun Seo was really sexy.

1933
01:50:32,631 --> 01:50:33,860
Jun Seo was unbelievable.

1934
01:50:33,861 --> 01:50:36,200
Peng Jin Yu did well, but he was up against Jun Seo.

1935
01:50:36,201 --> 01:50:37,440
(Kim Jun Seo versus Peng Jin Yu)

1936
01:50:37,441 --> 01:50:38,540
(Peng Jin Yu wins.)

1937
01:50:38,541 --> 01:50:40,811
(First sub-rapper Peng Jin Yu of 1 Star Team 2 wins.)

1938
01:50:41,171 --> 01:50:43,741
("Whiplash" Team 2 wins 2 times in a row.)

1939
01:50:44,081 --> 01:50:45,981
This is legendary.

1940
01:50:46,741 --> 01:50:48,481
He did well, though.

1941
01:50:48,881 --> 01:50:49,981
Your opponent was strong.

1942
01:50:50,351 --> 01:50:52,651
Yoon Min can't lose.

1943
01:50:52,721 --> 01:50:54,850
(The results of the 2nd sub-rappers will be revealed.)

1944
01:50:54,851 --> 01:50:56,921
- Let's go, Jae Hyun! - Let's go.

1945
01:50:57,051 --> 01:50:58,461
Yoon Min would win.

1946
01:50:58,561 --> 01:51:00,161
Yoon Min won.

1947
01:51:00,461 --> 01:51:01,661
(Kim Jae Hyun wins.)

1948
01:51:01,761 --> 01:51:05,231
(Second sub-rapper Kim Jae Hyun of 1 Star Team 2 wins.)

1949
01:51:05,331 --> 01:51:08,671
(The score flipped. It's 2 to 3.)

1950
01:51:08,731 --> 01:51:10,871
- What is going on? - What is this?

1951
01:51:11,171 --> 01:51:12,941
(An Xin is confused.)

1952
01:51:12,971 --> 01:51:15,211
This is a twist.

1953
01:51:15,871 --> 01:51:17,241
What?

1954
01:51:17,341 --> 01:51:18,581
Is this right?

1955
01:51:20,111 --> 01:51:21,111
What?

1956
01:51:21,112 --> 01:51:22,510
We never expected...

1957
01:51:22,511 --> 01:51:24,081
such a result.

1958
01:51:24,521 --> 01:51:26,751
I was a bit surprised.

1959
01:51:27,081 --> 01:51:28,891
Strange things are happening.

1960
01:51:29,491 --> 01:51:30,491
Daniel.

1961
01:51:30,492 --> 01:51:32,460
Honestly, I lost.

1962
01:51:32,461 --> 01:51:34,531
- Will it be Kim Daniel? - No way.

1963
01:51:34,891 --> 01:51:36,430
- Let's get it. - You never know.

1964
01:51:36,431 --> 01:51:38,461
(Lee Leo versus Kim Daniel)

1965
01:51:38,501 --> 01:51:40,731
(The result shocks everyone.)

1966
01:51:41,071 --> 01:51:42,931
(Daniel!)

1967
01:51:43,001 --> 01:51:44,801
- Daniel! - Daniel!

1968
01:51:44,901 --> 01:51:45,971
He lost.

1969
01:51:49,541 --> 01:51:51,381
- Daniel! - Daniel!

1970
01:51:53,211 --> 01:51:54,211
No way.

1971
01:51:54,212 --> 01:51:56,111
Hey!

1972
01:51:56,551 --> 01:51:57,780
(Score)

1973
01:51:57,781 --> 01:51:58,920
(Lee Leo: 93, Kim Daniel: 87)

1974
01:51:58,921 --> 01:52:01,021
(Lee Leo of Team 1 won with just 6 more points.)

1975
01:52:01,191 --> 01:52:02,890
Well done!

1976
01:52:02,891 --> 01:52:05,090
- Well done! - That was close.

1977
01:52:05,091 --> 01:52:07,761
Isn't that almost like losing? It is almost like losing.

1978
01:52:09,131 --> 01:52:11,030
The fact that I lost by only a small margin...

1979
01:52:11,031 --> 01:52:14,771
made me feel like I was rewarded for my hard work and passion.

1980
01:52:15,471 --> 01:52:17,100
- Is it going to be Jun Hyuk? - I think it's Geon Woo.

1981
01:52:17,101 --> 01:52:18,241
I think it's going to be a close race.

1982
01:52:18,301 --> 01:52:20,141
I am not sure who will win.

1983
01:52:20,571 --> 01:52:22,040
This is hard.

1984
01:52:22,041 --> 01:52:23,041
Mr. Bang.

1985
01:52:23,071 --> 01:52:25,140
(Kim Geon Woo of Team 1 wins.)

1986
01:52:25,141 --> 01:52:26,741
- Geon Woo did well. - Come on.

1987
01:52:26,981 --> 01:52:29,150
If Rensho wins, it's a tie.

1988
01:52:29,151 --> 01:52:30,980
- Come on. - Why is it such a close race?

1989
01:52:30,981 --> 01:52:32,421
Rensho did quite well.

1990
01:52:33,381 --> 01:52:35,251
(Between Yumeki and Rensho, who's going to win the last race?)

1991
01:52:35,421 --> 01:52:36,750
I think Rensho will win.

1992
01:52:36,751 --> 01:52:38,361
I think Yumeki will win.

1993
01:52:38,621 --> 01:52:39,891
Rensho showed his abs.

1994
01:52:40,361 --> 01:52:41,630
Nobody can beat Yumeki.

1995
01:52:41,631 --> 01:52:42,931
Yumeki did well.

1996
01:52:43,461 --> 01:52:44,930
You can win, Rensho!

1997
01:52:44,931 --> 01:52:46,631
- You got this. - I'm so curious.

1998
01:52:46,731 --> 01:52:47,900
What's going to happen here?

1999
01:52:47,901 --> 01:52:49,771
- I am dying to find out. - He will win.

2000
01:52:50,841 --> 01:52:51,970
Please hurry up and tell us!

2001
01:52:51,971 --> 01:52:53,340
- Please! - Please!

2002
01:52:53,341 --> 01:52:54,371
Please.

2003
01:52:57,071 --> 01:52:58,080
No way!

2004
01:52:58,081 --> 01:53:00,510
(Rensho wins.)

2005
01:53:00,511 --> 01:53:01,810
(Sub-rapper 3, "Whiplash")

2006
01:53:01,811 --> 01:53:03,251
(Rensho of 1 Star Team 2 wins.)

2007
01:53:07,521 --> 01:53:10,751
(Yumeki loses, and it's a 4-on-4 tie.)

2008
01:53:11,661 --> 01:53:13,191
This is the miracle of One Star.

2009
01:53:14,991 --> 01:53:16,430
Is this how it's supposed to go?

2010
01:53:16,431 --> 01:53:18,731
We might lose to Team Two.

2011
01:53:18,831 --> 01:53:20,061
I got really worried.

2012
01:53:21,571 --> 01:53:23,000
("Whiplash" by aespa, Team 1 versus Team 2)

2013
01:53:23,001 --> 01:53:25,141
(Result of 1-on-1 rival voting Team 1:4 wins, Team 2:4 wins)

2014
01:53:25,301 --> 01:53:26,840
I told you. It's 4 on 4.

2015
01:53:26,841 --> 01:53:28,111
It's 4 on 4?

2016
01:53:28,511 --> 01:53:30,711
This is an accident, isn't it?

2017
01:53:31,241 --> 01:53:32,511
It's not an accident.

2018
01:53:33,241 --> 01:53:34,651
What is this?

2019
01:53:35,151 --> 01:53:36,980
- Who won? - It's split like this.

2020
01:53:36,981 --> 01:53:38,851
Team One Star tied with Team Avengers?

2021
01:53:40,681 --> 01:53:42,351
It's a great team.

2022
01:53:43,151 --> 01:53:45,021
- Don't cry. - It's okay.

2023
01:53:45,491 --> 01:53:46,591
Daniel.

2024
01:53:46,761 --> 01:53:48,431
The team voting is what matters.

2025
01:53:48,631 --> 01:53:50,730
The team voting result is important.

2026
01:53:50,731 --> 01:53:53,661
(Which team will be the final winner?)

2027
01:53:53,861 --> 01:53:56,231
(All performances of 1-on-1 Class Battle ended.)

2028
01:53:56,671 --> 01:53:59,201
The first mission of BOYS II PLANET,

2029
01:53:59,641 --> 01:54:02,241
the 1-on-1 Class Battle ended.

2030
01:54:02,441 --> 01:54:03,910
The five winning teams...

2031
01:54:03,911 --> 01:54:07,041
that will be getting the benefit are decided.

2032
01:54:07,211 --> 01:54:10,251
The individual score and team score are combined.

2033
01:54:10,511 --> 01:54:12,881
What would be the final score?

2034
01:54:13,321 --> 01:54:16,991
Will there be a team taking the benefit of 300,000 points?

2035
01:54:17,691 --> 01:54:19,991
Let's check the final result.

2036
01:54:20,121 --> 01:54:21,731
We need to get the 300,000 points.

2037
01:54:22,031 --> 01:54:23,291
I have no clue.

2038
01:54:23,431 --> 01:54:25,830
First, I will reveal the result of the two teams...

2039
01:54:25,831 --> 01:54:28,031
that performed "KILL THE ROMEO."

2040
01:54:29,901 --> 01:54:30,901
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2041
01:54:32,271 --> 01:54:35,941
First, it's the sum of individual scores.

2042
01:54:36,611 --> 01:54:38,711
(Team 1:966, Team 2:584)

2043
01:54:38,981 --> 01:54:40,740
("KILL THE ROMEO" Team 1 gets a landslide victory...)

2044
01:54:40,741 --> 01:54:41,951
(by having a bigger sum of individual scores.)

2045
01:54:42,111 --> 01:54:46,251
I will first reveal the team score of Team One.

2046
01:54:46,521 --> 01:54:48,590
(Team 1:1,302)

2047
01:54:48,591 --> 01:54:52,521
The final score of Team 1 is 1,302.

2048
01:54:52,961 --> 01:54:54,191
We don't know yet.

2049
01:54:54,561 --> 01:54:57,031
I will now reveal the team score...

2050
01:54:57,531 --> 01:54:58,601
of "KILL THE ROMEO" Team Two.

2051
01:55:00,601 --> 01:55:02,770
(Will Team 2 be able to turn the tide...)

2052
01:55:02,771 --> 01:55:04,671
(through the team score?)

2053
01:55:05,071 --> 01:55:07,341
(Team score: 254, total score: 838)

2054
01:55:07,671 --> 01:55:09,441
Team One won.

2055
01:55:12,241 --> 01:55:15,150
They have acquired the benefit of 100,000 points.

2056
01:55:15,151 --> 01:55:16,450
("KilL THE ROMEO" Team 1 wins the benefit of 100,000 points.)

2057
01:55:16,451 --> 01:55:18,381
- Congratulations, Team One. - Let's enjoy it!

2058
01:55:18,581 --> 01:55:20,221
I felt so sorry.

2059
01:55:20,381 --> 01:55:22,250
Unfortunately, we lost.

2060
01:55:22,251 --> 01:55:23,691
But it's not the end just yet.

2061
01:55:24,121 --> 01:55:28,761
Next, I will reveal the result of the two "S-Class" teams.

2062
01:55:29,191 --> 01:55:30,330
(Team 1:910, Team 2:635)

2063
01:55:30,331 --> 01:55:31,560
(Team score: 322, total score: 957)

2064
01:55:31,561 --> 01:55:32,561
("S-Class" by Stray Kids)

2065
01:55:32,562 --> 01:55:33,860
("S-Class" Team 2 obtained a higher team score...)

2066
01:55:33,861 --> 01:55:35,001
(than the team that just lost.)

2067
01:55:35,431 --> 01:55:36,500
Not bad.

2068
01:55:36,501 --> 01:55:39,100
I will reveal the team score of "S-Class" Team One.

2069
01:55:39,101 --> 01:55:41,471
(Team 1 versus Team 2)

2070
01:55:44,941 --> 01:55:46,210
(Team score: 346, total score: 1,256)

2071
01:55:46,211 --> 01:55:48,110
(Team 1 wins, Team 2 loses.)

2072
01:55:48,111 --> 01:55:50,551
They have obtained the benefit of 100,000 points.

2073
01:55:50,611 --> 01:55:52,951
(All members of Team 1 win the benefit of 100,000 points.)

2074
01:55:55,321 --> 01:55:56,990
The team score was higher than I expected,

2075
01:55:56,991 --> 01:55:58,091
and I was grateful for that.

2076
01:55:59,521 --> 01:56:04,061
Next, I will reveal the result of two "Rising Sun" teams.

2077
01:56:04,601 --> 01:56:06,060
(Everyone except for the leader Kim Dong Yun lost...)

2078
01:56:06,061 --> 01:56:08,330
(in the individual score.)

2079
01:56:08,331 --> 01:56:09,630
(Team 2 didn't even reach half of Team 1's total individual score.)

2080
01:56:09,631 --> 01:56:11,041
(Team 1:974, Team 2:464)

2081
01:56:11,271 --> 01:56:13,541
I will reveal the team scores.

2082
01:56:13,801 --> 01:56:16,011
(Will the team scores turn the game around?)

2083
01:56:16,211 --> 01:56:18,580
Even if we got a lower total individual score,

2084
01:56:18,581 --> 01:56:20,211
if it was an impressive performance, they would've voted for us.

2085
01:56:22,051 --> 01:56:23,310
(Team score: 188, total score: 652)

2086
01:56:23,311 --> 01:56:25,680
(Team 1 wins, Team 2 loses.)

2087
01:56:25,681 --> 01:56:27,420
Team One wins.

2088
01:56:27,421 --> 01:56:30,221
They have acquired the benefit of 100,000 points.

2089
01:56:32,591 --> 01:56:33,821
I have a lot to work on.

2090
01:56:35,961 --> 01:56:38,031
Next is "Whiplash."

2091
01:56:38,431 --> 01:56:40,161
- I'm really curious about them. - I know. Very curious.

2092
01:56:40,531 --> 01:56:42,400
I will reveal the two teams' results.

2093
01:56:42,401 --> 01:56:44,741
It will be a close race again.

2094
01:56:46,141 --> 01:56:47,201
("Whiplash" by aespa)

2095
01:56:47,271 --> 01:56:49,870
(Team 1 versus Team 2)

2096
01:56:49,871 --> 01:56:51,140
(Team 2 caught up to Team 1,)

2097
01:56:51,141 --> 01:56:53,211
(pushing the score to a 4-on-4 tie.)

2098
01:56:53,911 --> 01:56:57,251
(The unexpected result shocked Team 1.)

2099
01:56:57,721 --> 01:57:00,751
First is the two teams' total individual score.

2100
01:57:02,091 --> 01:57:03,691
(Team 1:757, Team 2:676)

2101
01:57:04,661 --> 01:57:06,920
(Team 2 chases Team 1 with a very small score difference.)

2102
01:57:06,921 --> 01:57:08,961
I thought, "We might be able to pull it off."

2103
01:57:09,191 --> 01:57:10,631
What's happening?

2104
01:57:10,831 --> 01:57:12,931
I thought we could lose.

2105
01:57:13,031 --> 01:57:15,901
It was a very close match.

2106
01:57:16,431 --> 01:57:17,501
Really?

2107
01:57:17,801 --> 01:57:19,770
I'm curious to find out the result.

2108
01:57:19,771 --> 01:57:22,541
I will reveal the team scores.

2109
01:57:22,841 --> 01:57:23,841
Gosh.

2110
01:57:25,341 --> 01:57:27,581
What do we do? We might actually lose.

2111
01:57:31,011 --> 01:57:32,850
(Team 1, team score: 336, total score: 1,093)

2112
01:57:32,851 --> 01:57:35,421
(Team 2, team score: 280, total score: 956)

2113
01:57:41,161 --> 01:57:43,891
"Whiplash" Team 1 got 1,093 points.

2114
01:57:44,291 --> 01:57:46,661
"Whiplash" Team 2 got 956 points.

2115
01:57:47,001 --> 01:57:48,831
Team One won.

2116
01:57:49,901 --> 01:57:51,900
We did well, didn't we?

2117
01:57:51,901 --> 01:57:54,841
We lost, but we fought really well.

2118
01:57:55,211 --> 01:57:57,540
We almost beat the team...

2119
01:57:57,541 --> 01:57:59,381
that once felt untouchable,

2120
01:57:59,881 --> 01:58:00,911
and for that, I was proud of us.

2121
01:58:02,411 --> 01:58:05,821
Last up is "Plot Twist."

2122
01:58:06,321 --> 01:58:08,891
I will reveal the result of the two teams.

2123
01:58:09,591 --> 01:58:11,821
("Plot Twist" by TWS)

2124
01:58:12,221 --> 01:58:15,130
(If Team 2 wins against Team 1,)

2125
01:58:15,131 --> 01:58:16,830
(they will win the benefit of 300,000 points.)

2126
01:58:16,831 --> 01:58:19,831
First are the two teams' total individual scores.

2127
01:58:22,631 --> 01:58:23,730
(Team 1 versus Team 2)

2128
01:58:23,731 --> 01:58:25,771
(Team 1:661, Team 2:831)

2129
01:58:28,511 --> 01:58:31,071
(Team 2 gets ahead with 170 more points.)

2130
01:58:31,441 --> 01:58:33,081
I thought we might be able to win.

2131
01:58:33,881 --> 01:58:35,511
I was desperate for us to win.

2132
01:58:35,651 --> 01:58:38,351
"Plot Twist."

2133
01:58:38,551 --> 01:58:42,421
Which team will get a higher team score and win?

2134
01:58:42,451 --> 01:58:44,960
It was another close match.

2135
01:58:44,961 --> 01:58:46,060
- What? - What?

2136
01:58:46,061 --> 01:58:47,890
It was a close match.

2137
01:58:47,891 --> 01:58:50,960
"Plot Twist."

2138
01:58:50,961 --> 01:58:52,761
I will reveal the team scores.

2139
01:58:53,031 --> 01:58:57,841
(Which of "Plot Twist" teams will be the final winner?)

2140
01:58:59,441 --> 01:59:00,870
(Team 1:661, Team 2:831)

2141
01:59:00,871 --> 01:59:02,670
(Team 1:328, Team 2:312)

2142
01:59:02,671 --> 01:59:05,381
(Team 1 loses, Team 2 wins.)

2143
01:59:06,481 --> 01:59:08,910
(With a 154-score difference, )

2144
01:59:08,911 --> 01:59:11,651
(1-Star Team 2 beat All-Star Team 1.)

2145
01:59:12,381 --> 01:59:13,420
Well done.

2146
01:59:13,421 --> 01:59:15,091
Good job.

2147
01:59:17,921 --> 01:59:19,421
This is the uprising of One Stars.

2148
01:59:19,591 --> 01:59:23,361
Fortunately, we got a higher team score.

2149
01:59:23,461 --> 01:59:24,600
I could tell my teammates...

2150
01:59:24,601 --> 01:59:26,600
that we performed better.

2151
01:59:26,601 --> 01:59:28,231
I was glad I could say that.

2152
01:59:28,831 --> 01:59:29,931
It felt good too.

2153
01:59:30,531 --> 01:59:32,100
"Plot Twist."

2154
01:59:32,101 --> 01:59:37,241
Team 1 got 989 points and Team 2 got 1,143 points.

2155
01:59:37,641 --> 01:59:39,511
Team Two won.

2156
01:59:40,211 --> 01:59:41,351
Nice.

2157
01:59:42,611 --> 01:59:44,381
Team 2 is 1 Star,

2158
01:59:44,581 --> 01:59:47,621
and yet they beat Team One, All Star.

2159
01:59:47,851 --> 01:59:52,090
And they acquired the benefit of 300,000 points.

2160
01:59:52,091 --> 01:59:53,091
That's crazy.

2161
01:59:53,421 --> 01:59:55,461
Team Two, Congratulations.

2162
01:59:56,061 --> 01:59:57,861
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2163
01:59:58,661 --> 01:59:59,701
Thank you.

2164
02:00:00,001 --> 02:00:03,170
I can't believe that we won.

2165
02:00:03,171 --> 02:00:05,741
I am so grateful to the members.

2166
02:00:06,041 --> 02:00:09,871
We became the 1st Team 1 Star that beat Team All Star.

2167
02:00:10,111 --> 02:00:12,441
That was very thrilling too.

2168
02:00:14,311 --> 02:00:16,881
We have all five teams...

2169
02:00:17,251 --> 02:00:21,121
that won the 1-on-1 Class Battle and obtained the benefits.

2170
02:00:21,751 --> 02:00:22,751
But you see,

2171
02:00:24,051 --> 02:00:26,921
that's not the end of the result announcement.

2172
02:00:27,761 --> 02:00:31,431
The special benefit remains.

2173
02:00:32,761 --> 02:00:34,931
Out of 10 teams that fought in the 1-on-1 Class Battle,

2174
02:00:35,001 --> 02:00:38,541
we asked them to choose one team they wanted to see again.

2175
02:00:39,071 --> 02:00:41,171
The team that received the most number of votes...

2176
02:00:41,541 --> 02:00:45,241
will be performing on the stage the idol trainees dream about.

2177
02:00:46,781 --> 02:00:48,651
You will be appearing on "M Countdown."

2178
02:00:49,111 --> 02:00:50,451
(Special benefit of 1-on-1 Class Battle: "M Countdown")

2179
02:00:51,451 --> 02:00:52,581
Amazing.

2180
02:00:54,421 --> 02:00:57,191
It's Mnet's global video platform...

2181
02:00:57,351 --> 02:00:59,221
that has 30 million subscribers from all over the world.

2182
02:00:59,521 --> 02:01:01,931
And the opportunity to be on "STUDIO CHOOM."

2183
02:01:02,761 --> 02:01:05,301
The team to take...

2184
02:01:05,561 --> 02:01:07,001
all these benefits...

2185
02:01:07,331 --> 02:01:09,901
will be revealed now.

2186
02:01:11,131 --> 02:01:14,671
(Only one team gets the special benefit.)

2187
02:01:17,211 --> 02:01:22,810
(Which team will get the glory of the special benefit?)

2188
02:01:22,811 --> 02:01:23,811
(1-on-1 Class Battle, Special Benefit)

2189
02:01:23,812 --> 02:01:26,020
(All Star, "Whiplash" Team 1)

2190
02:01:26,021 --> 02:01:27,021
(1-on-1 Class Battle, Special Benefit)

2191
02:01:27,022 --> 02:01:28,521
(All Star, "Whiplash" Team 1)

2192
02:01:28,721 --> 02:01:31,520
(It was "Whiplash" Team 1.)

2193
02:01:31,521 --> 02:01:33,721
It is "Whiplash" Team One.

2194
02:01:34,461 --> 02:01:35,591
All right!

2195
02:01:36,331 --> 02:01:37,760
("Whiplash" Team 1 takes...)

2196
02:01:37,761 --> 02:01:41,501
(the special benefit that everyone covets.)

2197
02:01:44,371 --> 02:01:46,941
I'm not sure what to say right now.

2198
02:01:47,341 --> 02:01:49,810
I just can't believe it.

2199
02:01:49,811 --> 02:01:52,941
I want to thank the Star Creators...

2200
02:01:53,281 --> 02:01:56,651
for enjoying our performance.

2201
02:01:57,111 --> 02:01:58,620
I hope to show them...

2202
02:01:58,621 --> 02:02:00,181
a better performance...

2203
02:02:00,581 --> 02:02:04,350
on "M Countdown" and "STUDIO CHOOM."

2204
02:02:04,351 --> 02:02:09,260
I would also like to thank all the other participants...

2205
02:02:09,261 --> 02:02:10,930
for their hard work. You all did so well.

2206
02:02:10,931 --> 02:02:13,961
It also makes me sad because I know how hard they worked.

2207
02:02:14,831 --> 02:02:16,200
Did you win an award or something?

2208
02:02:16,201 --> 02:02:17,901
- That's enough! - Stop!

2209
02:02:18,571 --> 02:02:19,741
(Laughing)

2210
02:02:19,971 --> 02:02:22,141
Thank you, everyone.

2211
02:02:22,611 --> 02:02:24,541
We'll stay humble and do our best.

2212
02:02:25,211 --> 02:02:26,211
Thank you.

2213
02:02:26,341 --> 02:02:27,781
- Thank you. - Congratulations!

2214
02:02:27,881 --> 02:02:31,651
It was almost an acceptance speech at an awards ceremony.

2215
02:02:32,121 --> 02:02:33,651
Thank you for that.

2216
02:02:34,121 --> 02:02:36,551
All rounds of the 1-on-1 Class Battle...

2217
02:02:36,651 --> 02:02:38,021
have ended.

2218
02:02:38,591 --> 02:02:40,690
Although there are winners and losers today,

2219
02:02:40,691 --> 02:02:43,861
the current result isn't final.

2220
02:02:44,531 --> 02:02:46,030
In the First Survivor Announcement,

2221
02:02:46,031 --> 02:02:48,901
which will be aired next week,

2222
02:02:49,001 --> 02:02:51,571
the final voting result...

2223
02:02:51,671 --> 02:02:54,441
that includes today's benefit points will be announced.

2224
02:02:55,371 --> 02:02:56,511
And tomorrow,

2225
02:02:57,371 --> 02:02:59,981
the First Survivor Announcement of BOYS II PLANET...

2226
02:03:00,081 --> 02:03:03,911
will be streamed live all over the world.

2227
02:03:04,721 --> 02:03:06,321
In tomorrow's livestream,

2228
02:03:06,421 --> 02:03:09,220
the Last Survivor Live Voting will be held.

2229
02:03:09,221 --> 02:03:10,490
(Last Survivor Live Voting on Mnet Plus)

2230
02:03:10,491 --> 02:03:13,361
Who will be the candidates to be the last survivor?

2231
02:03:13,821 --> 02:03:16,491
And who will be the last survivor...

2232
02:03:16,591 --> 02:03:19,031
that survives last through the live vote?

2233
02:03:20,261 --> 02:03:22,770
The second global voting to determine the survival...

2234
02:03:22,771 --> 02:03:25,201
of the 80 boys on BOYS II PLANET...

2235
02:03:25,401 --> 02:03:28,841
will close tomorrow at 10am.

2236
02:03:29,911 --> 02:03:32,711
Cast your vote now on the official platform...

2237
02:03:32,811 --> 02:03:34,211
for BOYS II PLANET, Mnet Plus,

2238
02:03:34,311 --> 02:03:37,581
for the boy who ignites your passion.

2239
02:03:50,861 --> 02:03:52,561
(Instincts awaken.)

2240
02:03:53,661 --> 02:03:55,631
(A clash with ranks on full display)

2241
02:03:56,201 --> 02:03:58,070
(It was insane.)

2242
02:03:58,071 --> 02:03:59,841
(The most primal competition for suvival)

2243
02:04:01,441 --> 02:04:04,010
(If you want to win, endure!)

2244
02:04:04,011 --> 02:04:05,580
He's going full-speed ahead!

2245
02:04:05,581 --> 02:04:07,781
(He goes forward without hesitation.)

2246
02:04:09,451 --> 02:04:11,380
(The gust machine is a bit harsher only for him.)

2247
02:04:11,381 --> 02:04:12,920
Let's go!

2248
02:04:12,921 --> 02:04:14,581
(Go!)

2249
02:04:14,681 --> 02:04:16,751
(A fearless dive! What will the result be?)

2250
02:04:17,651 --> 02:04:19,390
(He seemed pretty edgy.)

2251
02:04:19,391 --> 02:04:20,821
(I'm even edgier when I'm in battle.)

2252
02:04:20,921 --> 02:04:23,030
(The ultimate dance showdown that everyone's been waiting for)

2253
02:04:23,031 --> 02:04:24,961
(That's the real deal.)

2254
02:04:26,331 --> 02:04:28,171
(Everyone is stunned.)

2255
02:04:29,871 --> 02:04:32,441
(An unforgettable dance highlight you won't see anywhere else)

2256
02:04:34,341 --> 02:04:36,371
(What's your final goal?)

2257
02:04:36,671 --> 02:04:39,210
(Debut)

2258
02:04:39,211 --> 02:04:41,211
(I've come to make my debut.)

2259
02:04:44,411 --> 02:04:45,680
(I want to make my debut...)

2260
02:04:45,681 --> 02:04:47,581
(on BOYS II PLANET.)

2261
02:04:49,451 --> 02:04:51,291
(I don't want to be eliminated.)

2262
02:04:52,691 --> 02:04:53,691
(I want to survive...)

2263
02:04:53,692 --> 02:04:55,831
(and prove myself.)

2264
02:05:00,231 --> 02:05:03,871
(I genuinely want to survive.)

2265
02:05:04,771 --> 02:05:07,001
(I don't want to go home.)

2266
02:05:10,911 --> 02:05:13,581
(I hope I survive.)

2267
02:05:13,841 --> 02:05:16,051
(Next week, First Survivor Announcement)

2268
02:05:16,851 --> 02:05:19,381
Among the participants who survive this vote,

2269
02:05:19,821 --> 02:05:22,021
the final survivor in last place will be determined...

2270
02:05:22,491 --> 02:05:23,751
through the Last Survivor Live Voting...

2271
02:05:23,921 --> 02:05:27,191
during the First Survivor Announcement,

2272
02:05:27,561 --> 02:05:30,691
streamed tomorrow at 3pm.
