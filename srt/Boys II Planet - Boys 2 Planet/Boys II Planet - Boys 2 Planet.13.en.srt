BOYS II PLANET.

10
00:02:32,577 --> 00:02:34,606
Three months ago, with dreams...

11
00:02:34,607 --> 00:02:36,207
of debuting as a global K-pop boy group,

12
00:02:37,147 --> 00:02:38,617

only eight will realize their dream...

28
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:22,587

as the brightest stars?

31
00:04:32,297 --> 00:04:36,597
The ones who can determine their fate are you guys,

32
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:40,297

was just a number.

142

Hello. I've made it this far with nothing but faith in myself...

143
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:05,246
to drive me through this endless tunnel.

(Kim Geon Woo)

146
00:17:10,747 --> 00:17:13,886
During my long years as a trainee,

147
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:16,857
I wondered if I was on the wrong career path.

148
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:20,826
I questioned myself quite often if I wasn't cut out for this.

149
00:17:20,827 --> 00:17:22,966
I was going to give up on my dream.

150
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:25,436
I got this strong feeling that...

151
00:17:25,437 --> 00:17:29,037
I would regret it if I didn't pursue my dream to the end.

152
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:31,407
So I couldn't give up on my dream.

153
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:34,837
I truly want to make a debut now.

154
00:17:41,877 --> 00:17:45,716
Hello. I would like to shine until the very end...

(Zhou An Xin)

158
00:17:51,657 --> 00:17:55,196
To me, being able to perform on stage...

159
00:17:55,197 --> 00:17:56,696
is like a dream come true.

160
00:17:56,697 --> 00:17:58,796
When everyone's eyes are on me,

161
00:17:58,797 --> 00:18:01,797
I can feel that I am shining in their eyes.

162
00:18:01,937 --> 00:18:04,306
That kind of sensation makes me feel good...

163
00:18:04,307 --> 00:18:06,136
and brings me immense joy.

164
00:18:06,137 --> 00:18:07,906
I've been waiting for a long time.

165
00:18:07,907 --> 00:18:10,447

170
00:18:25,157 --> 00:18:27,697
my last opportunity.

171
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:31,526
There were numerous moments...

172
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,036
that made me contemplate if I should keep pursuing this path.

173
00:18:34,037 --> 00:18:37,436
But there were so many people who supported me.

174
00:18:37,437 --> 00:18:41,377
And I know that there are people who still enjoy watching me perform.

175
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,446
As a way to show them my gratitude,

176
00:18:43,447 --> 00:18:46,917
I must ensure no matter what that I can make a debut on the show.

177
00:18:48,317 --> 00:18:49,946
As long as there's a chance,

178
00:18:49,947 --> 00:18:52,217
I'd like to continue to perform on stage.

179
00:18:58,087 --> 00:18:59,796
Because I didn't give up on my dream,

180
00:18:59,797 --> 00:19:01,526
I was able to make it this far.

181
00:19:01,527 --> 00:19:02,796
My name is Yoo Kang Min.

182
00:19:02,797 --> 00:19:05,697
(Yoo Kang Min)

183
00:19:05,897 --> 00:19:07,266
I was quite scared.

184
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:11,336
Ever since I was young, people had complimented my looks.

185
00:19:11,337 --> 00:19:12,876
But they commented that other than my good looks,

186
00:19:12,877 --> 00:19:14,437
I lacked in many ways.

187
00:19:14,577 --> 00:19:16,376
If I can impress the viewers on the show,

188
00:19:16,377 --> 00:19:18,297
I'll be that guy, the one who's not good enough.

189
00:19:18,947 --> 00:19:20,877
So that scared and terrified me.

190
00:19:21,177 --> 00:19:24,347
That's why I kept working toward improving my weaknesses.

191
00:19:24,547 --> 00:19:27,917
Because I'm improving every day,

192
00:19:28,217 --> 00:19:30,827
I believe that I ought to make a debut.

193
00:19:34,727 --> 00:19:37,666
I would like to prove to people that I chose the right path.

194
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:39,036
My name is Kim Jun Seo.

195
00:19:39,037 --> 00:19:42,337
(Kim Jun Seo)

196
00:19:43,637 --> 00:19:45,306
I came onto this show,

197
00:19:45,307 --> 00:19:47,053
treating this as my last chance to make it as an idol star.

198
00:19:47,077 --> 00:19:49,106
After getting a lot of support from the viewers and the audience,

199
00:19:49,107 --> 00:19:50,977
I began to want more for myself.

200
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:54,446
I believe that it's my duty to make a debut...

201
00:19:54,447 --> 00:19:57,217
as my way of repaying the people who have shown their support to me.

202
00:19:57,647 --> 00:19:59,987
That's making it harder for me to give up...

203
00:20:00,457 --> 00:20:02,057
and want more for myself.

204
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,866
Hello. I made it to the end by holding onto...

205
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:10,926
the last shred of my dream. My name is Park Dong Gyu.

206
00:20:10,927 --> 00:20:13,337
(Park Dong Gyu)

207
00:20:13,937 --> 00:20:15,467
As a trainee,

208
00:20:15,637 --> 00:20:19,477
we must keep rebuilding a sandcastle that's destined to collapse...

209
00:20:19,637 --> 00:20:21,336
so that we can make ourselves stronger.

210
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:23,006
I believe that's what the trainee period is for.

211
00:20:23,007 --> 00:20:25,376
There were times when my dream looked so far away.

212
00:20:25,377 --> 00:20:27,976
There were numerous times...

213
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,617
when it felt as if I was walking on thin ice.

214
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:34,216
But whenever I felt that way, my beloved Star Creators told me...

215
00:20:34,217 --> 00:20:35,417
You can do this, Dong Gyu!

216
00:20:35,587 --> 00:20:37,727
That I could do this and was doing a good job.

217
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:41,057
When I heard such supportive comments from them,

218
00:20:43,297 --> 00:20:45,636
I was able to move forward with confidence.

219
00:20:45,637 --> 00:20:47,536
In return, I would like to be there...

220
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,617
for the Star Creators when things get hard for them.

221
00:20:50,537 --> 00:20:53,677
I'd like to make a debut today, no matter what.

222
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:06,486
I'm the first one to wake up and the last one to stop working.

223
00:21:06,487 --> 00:21:08,616
I'm pursuing my dream without any breaks.

224
00:21:08,617 --> 00:21:09,756
My name is Kim Jun Min.

225
00:21:09,757 --> 00:21:12,197
(Kim Jun Min)

226
00:21:12,697 --> 00:21:15,496
I'd like to keep performing for the rest of my life.

227
00:21:15,497 --> 00:21:17,526
I've been training...

228
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:20,297
for a very long time to make that happen.

229
00:21:22,937 --> 00:21:25,776
I was able to get through this tough time...

230
00:21:25,777 --> 00:21:28,477
because I was given a chance to perform on stage.

231
00:21:29,047 --> 00:21:32,317
Then I met the Star Creators who supported me throughout the show.

232
00:21:32,517 --> 00:21:34,976
I only focused on that moment with the Star Creators...

233
00:21:34,977 --> 00:21:36,947
and kept working hard to continue this journey.

234
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:39,387
I can't picture myself...

235
00:21:39,987 --> 00:21:42,857
doing anything else other than performing on stage.

236
00:21:42,957 --> 00:21:44,827
So I'd like to make a debut, no matter what.

237
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:53,837
My name is Chen Jin Xin. I've come to Korea for my dream.

238
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:57,067
(Chen Kai Wen)

239
00:21:57,537 --> 00:22:02,036
When people I didn't recognize in the audience...

240
00:22:02,037 --> 00:22:06,047
screamed my name, "Chen Kai Wen,"

241
00:22:06,677 --> 00:22:08,747
I was actually quite moved.

242
00:22:09,147 --> 00:22:14,187
That was a beautiful moment for me.

243
00:22:14,617 --> 00:22:19,097
So no matter how tough it got on the show,

244
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:22,427
I thought I couldn't let them down.

245
00:22:22,867 --> 00:22:27,637
I'll put on a great performance and do my best to make a debut.

246
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,406
Hello. I was a boy who fell in love with music.

247
00:22:34,407 --> 00:22:37,206
Now, I'm dreaming of much bigger things with music.

248
00:22:37,207 --> 00:22:38,376
My name is Kang Woo Jin.

249
00:22:38,377 --> 00:22:40,047
(Kang Woo Jin)

250
00:22:40,647 --> 00:22:43,046
In order to achieve my dream,

251
00:22:43,047 --> 00:22:44,847
I pictured a lot of possibilities for myself.

252
00:22:45,887 --> 00:22:48,586
When I pictured myself performing on a big stage,

253
00:22:48,587 --> 00:22:50,187
singing and dancing,

254
00:22:50,257 --> 00:22:52,497
that motivated myself.

255
00:22:52,697 --> 00:22:54,726
Whenever that happened,

256
00:22:54,727 --> 00:22:56,767
I pushed myself more and worked harder.

257
00:22:57,367 --> 00:22:58,696
I have a big dream...

258
00:22:58,697 --> 00:23:01,637
of impressing the world with my voice.

259
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:04,066
I've promised so many people...

260
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:06,136
that I would make that happen.

261
00:23:06,137 --> 00:23:07,857
So I'd like to make a debut no matter what.

262
00:23:11,507 --> 00:23:14,446
Hello. I'm He Xin Long who has gotten stronger...

263
00:23:14,447 --> 00:23:16,063
as I've gone through many difficult times.

264
00:23:16,087 --> 00:23:18,617
(He Xin Long)

265
00:23:18,817 --> 00:23:20,956
I love performing on stage.

266
00:23:20,957 --> 00:23:24,326
I don't feel shy when I'm on stage.

267
00:23:24,327 --> 00:23:28,397
I can express myself freely. So that makes me happy.

268
00:23:29,167 --> 00:23:30,926
I'd like to put on a great performance...

269
00:23:30,927 --> 00:23:32,696
for the Star Creators...

270
00:23:32,697 --> 00:23:35,906
who have shown their support to me. I want to do my best,

271
00:23:35,907 --> 00:23:37,537
so I don't leave any regret.

272
00:23:38,507 --> 00:23:40,637
I truly want to make a debut.

273
00:23:47,977 --> 00:23:49,646
I'd like to go from a hip-hop cuddly cat...

274
00:23:49,647 --> 00:23:51,846
to your beloved idol star, Chung Sang Hyeon.

275
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,086
My name is Chung Sang Hyeon.

276
00:23:53,087 --> 00:23:55,417
(Chung Sang Hyeon)

277
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,056
A lot of the Star Creators see me...

278
00:23:58,057 --> 00:24:00,026
as just a cute...

279
00:24:00,027 --> 00:24:02,327
and innocent guy.

280
00:24:02,967 --> 00:24:06,266
But I also have a cool, sexy side.

281
00:24:06,267 --> 00:24:08,267
I really hope they will see that.

282
00:24:08,797 --> 00:24:12,307
On stage, I get to enjoy performing with everyone.

283
00:24:12,537 --> 00:24:14,306
I love those moments.

284
00:24:14,307 --> 00:24:17,876
That's why I'm even more determined...

285
00:24:17,877 --> 00:24:19,817
to make a debut now.

286
00:24:20,747 --> 00:24:23,787
I don't think I'll ever be able to give up on my dream.

287
00:24:30,587 --> 00:24:33,226
I'm not afraid of being the inexperienced one.

288
00:24:33,227 --> 00:24:35,497
I'm Chuei Li Yu who keeps searching for light every day.

289
00:24:35,827 --> 00:24:39,067
(Chuei Li Yu)

290
00:24:39,597 --> 00:24:43,707
I'm used to staying in the basement practice studio.

291
00:24:43,937 --> 00:24:49,107
I had no idea what it was like to perform on stage.

292
00:24:49,577 --> 00:24:52,846
I couldn't believe that I had this chance to show people...

293
00:24:52,847 --> 00:24:54,577
who I was.

294
00:24:54,977 --> 00:24:56,517
I'm not the only one...

295
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,316
with this dream.

296
00:24:58,317 --> 00:25:01,356
I feel as if I was shouldering the expectations of people...

297
00:25:01,357 --> 00:25:03,457
who support me.

298
00:25:03,657 --> 00:25:05,426
Now that the debut is around the corner,

299
00:25:05,427 --> 00:25:07,197
I'm more determined than ever.

300
00:25:07,927 --> 00:25:10,197
That's how badly I don't want to give up on this.

301
00:25:13,937 --> 00:25:16,336
I've challenged myself again to the dream I've turned away from.

302
00:25:16,337 --> 00:25:18,567
Now, I don't want to give up again. My name is Yumeki.

303
00:25:18,637 --> 00:25:20,606
(Yumeki)

304
00:25:20,607 --> 00:25:22,206
To me,

305
00:25:22,207 --> 00:25:24,076
the stage...

306
00:25:24,077 --> 00:25:27,317
is the best place where I can express myself.

307
00:25:28,647 --> 00:25:30,746
I always carried this thought with me...

308
00:25:30,747 --> 00:25:33,257
while working as a dancer.

309
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,787
"One day,"

310
00:25:36,227 --> 00:25:38,327
"I want to have my own performance."

311
00:25:39,127 --> 00:25:41,327
"I'd like to be the star of my performance."

312
00:25:41,857 --> 00:25:46,897
So I couldn't give up on this dream.

313
00:25:51,237 --> 00:25:53,977
I want to be remembered forever,

314
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:56,776
not merely as a flash of light.

315
00:25:56,777 --> 00:25:58,046
My name is Zhang Jia Hao.

316
00:25:58,047 --> 00:26:00,177
(Zhang Jia Hao)

317
00:26:00,817 --> 00:26:04,987
The truth is, because I spent a long time as a trainee,

318
00:26:05,487 --> 00:26:07,186
the thought of giving up crossed my mind multiple times...

319
00:26:07,187 --> 00:26:08,857
despite my effort.

320
00:26:09,057 --> 00:26:12,497
After challenging myself to be on this show,

321
00:26:12,657 --> 00:26:14,496
one thing became certain for me.

322
00:26:14,497 --> 00:26:16,666
That I should never give up on my dream...

323
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:19,336
because so many people showed their support to me...

324
00:26:19,337 --> 00:26:21,966
and cheered for me, so I could make my dream...

325
00:26:21,967 --> 00:26:23,506
come true.

326
00:26:23,507 --> 00:26:25,937
So why would I ever give up on my dream?

327
00:26:31,607 --> 00:26:35,887
Hello. I'd like to make music with the people I love.

328
00:26:36,147 --> 00:26:37,346
My name is Lee Leo.

329
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:39,917
(Lee Leo)

330
00:26:40,457 --> 00:26:43,526
I joined the show as a trainee to become an idol star.

331
00:26:43,527 --> 00:26:46,456
Pushing myself to have a fresh start...

332
00:26:46,457 --> 00:26:49,966
was a huge challenge for me.

333
00:26:49,967 --> 00:26:53,236
I told myself that I was starting from square one...

334
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,967
while I took on this challenge.

335
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,306
When I was 17,

336
00:26:58,307 --> 00:27:01,576
I came to Korea by myself to realize this dream.

337
00:27:01,577 --> 00:27:05,177
I was desperate to become a singer.

338
00:27:05,447 --> 00:27:08,776
Whenever things become difficult, I think of my 17-year-old self.

339
00:27:08,777 --> 00:27:12,147
Because I don't want to disappoint myself,

340
00:27:12,347 --> 00:27:15,087
I'm working hard and unwilling to give up.

341
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:27,036
I've been a trainee for six years.

342
00:27:27,037 --> 00:27:29,736
Now desperately yearning to debut, I'm Lee Sang Won

343
00:27:29,737 --> 00:27:31,967
(Lee Sang Won)

344
00:27:32,307 --> 00:27:36,206
Usually, I'm unable to fly free.

345
00:27:36,207 --> 00:27:39,047
Being on stage allows me to breathe.

346
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:41,477
It's a place...

347
00:27:41,747 --> 00:27:44,987
where I can show my true self.

348
00:27:46,257 --> 00:27:48,117
I believe...

349
00:27:48,217 --> 00:27:51,987
that it's time for me to fly freely.

350
00:27:52,387 --> 00:27:56,827
I've managed to hang on and keep going,

351
00:27:58,727 --> 00:28:01,637
so I'd really like to debut now.

352
00:28:12,177 --> 00:28:14,347
The journey started with 160 boys.

353
00:28:15,517 --> 00:28:17,217
Now it came down to 16 members.

354
00:28:21,317 --> 00:28:22,797
We're waiting for the special name...

355
00:28:22,857 --> 00:28:26,357
that will be engraved in front of ours tonight.

356
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:38,237
(I want to be born as a new star.)

357
00:28:42,647 --> 00:28:46,047
(Special stage for the live episode of BOYS II PLANET)

358
00:29:00,327 --> 00:29:03,067
The birth of a new boy group...

359
00:29:03,297 --> 00:29:06,267
with a romantic, energetic vibe, BOYS II PLANET.

360
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:09,066
I'm your host for the Final Live Show.

361
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:12,037
I'm Planet Master, Kim Jae Joong. It's good to see you.

362
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:21,577
It was divided into two planets.

363
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,946
The starting moment with you is...

364
00:29:23,947 --> 00:29:26,087
still clear in our mind.

365
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:28,186
The Final Live Show...

366
00:29:28,187 --> 00:29:31,527
where the debut team will be created is finally here.

367
00:29:36,027 --> 00:29:39,027
Although it's bittersweet that we're at the final round,

368
00:29:39,197 --> 00:29:42,637
today marks a historic day as we announce the new beginning...

369
00:29:42,737 --> 00:29:44,337
as one team.

370
00:29:45,237 --> 00:29:48,106
During a long period...

371
00:29:48,107 --> 00:29:50,847
of the last three months,

372
00:29:51,177 --> 00:29:53,817
all the participants improved rapidly.

373
00:29:54,047 --> 00:29:57,846
It was meaningful to be able to witness...

374
00:29:57,847 --> 00:30:00,617
everything every moment.

375
00:30:01,157 --> 00:30:03,857
Tonight at the end of their long journey,

376
00:30:04,757 --> 00:30:06,857
they'll embrace the glory of debut.

377
00:30:07,227 --> 00:30:09,797
The final Top Eight.

378
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:13,337
Who will be the eight members?

379
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:16,466
(The 2nd final global voting is...)

380
00:30:16,467 --> 00:30:17,866
(conducted during the live show.)

381
00:30:17,867 --> 00:30:20,407
The final global voting to determine the debut team is...

382
00:30:20,677 --> 00:30:22,007
divided into two parts.

383
00:30:22,307 --> 00:30:24,647
The first voting that took place over the past week...

384
00:30:25,147 --> 00:30:26,817
and the second voting...

385
00:30:27,147 --> 00:30:30,246
that will be held during the live show.

386
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:32,017
(The final global voting)

387
00:30:32,587 --> 00:30:33,756
(The voting was conducted in the presence of observers.)

388
00:30:33,757 --> 00:30:34,956
(A woman in her 30s and a man in his 20s)

389
00:30:34,957 --> 00:30:36,927
The second voting will weigh...

390
00:30:38,027 --> 00:30:39,727
twice as much.

391
00:30:40,357 --> 00:30:43,196
There is about one hour left until the deadline.

392
00:30:43,197 --> 00:30:44,566
(The 2nd voting is taking place on the official platform, Mnet Plus.)

393
00:30:44,567 --> 00:30:45,997
You have one hour.

394
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:49,067
As your votes will determine the final debut team,

395
00:30:49,237 --> 00:30:52,266
please hurry.

396
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,027
(The 2nd voting is taking place on the official platform, Mnet Plus.)

397
00:30:59,147 --> 00:31:01,346
Here's the result of the first voting that took place...

398
00:31:01,347 --> 00:31:03,216
during the last week.

399
00:31:03,217 --> 00:31:07,257
With votes from approximately 222 regions,

400
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:12,857
we had a total of 23,032,255...

401
00:31:13,597 --> 00:31:16,196
accumulated votes.

402
00:31:16,197 --> 00:31:20,567
About 5,567,805 people...

403
00:31:20,737 --> 00:31:23,237
participated in the voting.

404
00:31:23,907 --> 00:31:27,437
Compared to BOYS II PLANET Season One,

405
00:31:28,077 --> 00:31:32,247
this is about three times more.

406
00:31:41,017 --> 00:31:43,026
Star Creators around the world.

407
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:46,196
I'd like to thank you again...

408
00:31:46,197 --> 00:31:48,227
for your passionate support until the end.

409
00:31:54,267 --> 00:31:57,166
This is the live broadcast of BOYS II PLANET.

410
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:59,067
For the final special stage,

411
00:31:59,207 --> 00:32:02,137
to share the historic moment of the debut team's birth,

412
00:32:02,307 --> 00:32:04,847
countless Star Creators filled...

413
00:32:05,277 --> 00:32:08,377
the entire studio like this.

414
00:32:14,117 --> 00:32:16,486
Thanks to your support and passion,

415
00:32:16,487 --> 00:32:19,556
the atmosphere here feels more intense.

416
00:32:19,557 --> 00:32:20,997
Hello again, everyone.

417
00:32:22,697 --> 00:32:23,797
Hello.

418
00:32:25,867 --> 00:32:27,697
Scream, everyone!

419
00:32:28,737 --> 00:32:31,006
That's great.

420
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:34,437
(Jun Lee Jeong, let's debut.)

421
00:32:40,577 --> 00:32:43,587
There is no one who has more affection...

422
00:32:43,717 --> 00:32:47,657
for our participants than the Star Creators. Right?

423
00:32:51,827 --> 00:32:54,326
They closely watched our participants' growth,

424
00:32:54,327 --> 00:32:56,326
sometimes objectively...

425
00:32:56,327 --> 00:32:58,566
and other times with warmth.

426
00:32:58,567 --> 00:33:02,296
They're the professional masters. Hello.

427
00:33:02,297 --> 00:33:04,307
(Professional masters)

428
00:33:09,877 --> 00:33:11,407
Master Lee Seok Hoon.

429
00:33:12,507 --> 00:33:14,876
- Hello. - Hello, this is Lee Seok Hoon.

430
00:33:14,877 --> 00:33:16,987
- It's good to see you. - Likewise.

431
00:33:17,187 --> 00:33:19,446
After a long journey,

432
00:33:19,447 --> 00:33:21,817
the participants are preparing for their final stage.

433
00:33:21,987 --> 00:33:23,786
You've watched them closely...

434
00:33:23,787 --> 00:33:26,187
- all along, right? - Yes.

435
00:33:26,557 --> 00:33:29,566
As their master, what emotions do you feel...

436
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:31,097
most strongly right now?

437
00:33:31,127 --> 00:33:33,066
As I've watched them closely,

438
00:33:33,067 --> 00:33:36,437
I feel overwhelmingly emotional.

439
00:33:36,707 --> 00:33:38,937
I believe that along the way,

440
00:33:39,107 --> 00:33:41,306
not only did the participants improve their skills,

441
00:33:41,307 --> 00:33:44,847
- but their mindset... - Their mindset?

442
00:33:45,147 --> 00:33:48,877
Also became stronger.

443
00:33:51,017 --> 00:33:53,717
No matter who gets to debut, they will make a great team.

444
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:56,656
Even if they don't make it,

445
00:33:56,657 --> 00:34:00,227
I have no doubt that they will shine wherever they are.

446
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:03,467
I hope that they give their best until the end.

447
00:34:03,727 --> 00:34:06,867
I hope that they will spread their wings freely...

448
00:34:06,997 --> 00:34:10,267
within the embrace of the Star Creators. Thank you.

449
00:34:11,837 --> 00:34:16,277
Thank you so much for your words from the bottom of your heart.

450
00:34:16,577 --> 00:34:19,747
And hello, Master Kany.

451
00:34:21,847 --> 00:34:22,917
Hello.

452
00:34:23,087 --> 00:34:25,346
The final voting is taking place right now.

453
00:34:25,347 --> 00:34:27,756
It's a crucial moment.

454
00:34:27,757 --> 00:34:29,626
Could you say something...

455
00:34:29,627 --> 00:34:31,886
to the global Star Creators...

456
00:34:31,887 --> 00:34:35,256
for more of their support for the 16 participants?

457
00:34:35,257 --> 00:34:36,697
Yes, of course.

458
00:34:37,427 --> 00:34:40,567
Hello, Star Creators.

459
00:34:40,867 --> 00:34:42,697
Global Star Creators.

460
00:34:43,567 --> 00:34:47,606
The 16 finalists poured everything into their journey.

461
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:50,577
Their passion, their heart, and their dreams.

462
00:34:50,877 --> 00:34:54,676
And for so many of them, this stage is a dream...

463
00:34:54,677 --> 00:34:57,017
that they've been carrying for a long time.

464
00:34:57,747 --> 00:35:00,417
And now, it's finally here. It's here.

465
00:35:01,717 --> 00:35:05,186
We've been right beside them,

466
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:07,297
supporting them, guiding them,

467
00:35:07,427 --> 00:35:09,967
making sure that they can shine even brighter.

468
00:35:10,267 --> 00:35:13,537
So please keep the love coming.

469
00:35:14,037 --> 00:35:15,666
Please keep those votes flying in.

470
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:19,836
And let's carry them until their dreams come true.

471
00:35:19,837 --> 00:35:22,177
Dear Star Creators,

472
00:35:22,337 --> 00:35:23,647
did you vote?

473
00:35:24,877 --> 00:35:26,147
Did you vote?

474
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,177
I said, did you vote?

475
00:35:29,517 --> 00:35:30,687
Thank you.

476
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:36,587
Everyone here, did you vote?

477
00:35:36,757 --> 00:35:38,026
- Yes. - Yes.

478
00:35:38,027 --> 00:35:40,027
If someone hasn't voted yet,

479
00:35:40,857 --> 00:35:45,067
Master Kany will be very angry.

480
00:35:45,267 --> 00:35:49,167
If you haven't voted yet, please do so.

481
00:35:53,107 --> 00:35:55,206
Those sitting beside the masters.

482
00:35:55,207 --> 00:35:58,647
We're very happy to see them here.

483
00:35:59,477 --> 00:36:00,547
Hello.

484
00:36:03,887 --> 00:36:04,947
Yes.

485
00:36:05,187 --> 00:36:08,587
They realized their dream of debuting as Wanna One...

486
00:36:10,727 --> 00:36:12,726
on a survival show on Mnet.

487
00:36:12,727 --> 00:36:16,256
The five members are here with us today.

488
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,267
Hello.

489
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,337
Ha Sung Woon.

490
00:36:26,507 --> 00:36:27,537
Hello.

491
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,276
Hello, this is Ha Sung Woon.

492
00:36:30,277 --> 00:36:32,377
- It's great to see you. - Yes.

493
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:35,476
With Lee Dae Hwi who's next to you,

494
00:36:35,477 --> 00:36:40,017
you were Planet Masters who gave the last mission.

495
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:41,157
Right.

496
00:36:41,158 --> 00:36:43,656
The participants worked hard on the mission...

497
00:36:43,657 --> 00:36:46,696
to get ready for the upcoming performance.

498
00:36:46,697 --> 00:36:48,727
Please give them a word of encouragement.

499
00:36:49,827 --> 00:36:55,336
It's something that we experienced before.

500
00:36:55,337 --> 00:36:57,907
I know too well how nervous everyone is.

501
00:36:58,237 --> 00:37:00,307
On top of everything, this is a live show.

502
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:04,077
I think I was extra nervous on the live show.

503
00:37:04,747 --> 00:37:08,177
Still, if you take on the stage like you normally practiced...

504
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:12,117
with the same enthusiasm as you practiced,

505
00:37:12,317 --> 00:37:14,756
I think you'll put on a fantastic performance.

506
00:37:14,757 --> 00:37:15,787
Go, guys!

507
00:37:20,557 --> 00:37:22,357
Thank you.

508
00:37:22,757 --> 00:37:24,926
I believe that was a great encouragement...

509
00:37:24,927 --> 00:37:26,796
and solid support for our participants,

510
00:37:26,797 --> 00:37:29,767
who must be very nervous.

511
00:37:32,867 --> 00:37:36,106
And izna, who debuted through Mnet's "I-LAND2: N-a,"

512
00:37:36,107 --> 00:37:38,747
also joined us.

513
00:37:39,107 --> 00:37:40,117
Hello.

514
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,956
Bang Jee Min, as someone who is from a survival show as well,

515
00:37:48,957 --> 00:37:51,057
I'm sure you have a special feeling.

516
00:37:51,157 --> 00:37:53,897
Please give a word of support to the participants.

517
00:37:54,327 --> 00:37:57,366
Yes. Having debuted through a survival show myself,

518
00:37:57,367 --> 00:37:59,896
I know better than anyone how nerve-racking...

519
00:37:59,897 --> 00:38:01,767
and precious this moment is.

520
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:05,967
I believe that if the participants enjoy this moment without regrets,

521
00:38:06,267 --> 00:38:10,546
they will receive truly satisfying results.

522
00:38:10,547 --> 00:38:11,577
Go for it!

523
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,217
Thank you.

524
00:38:16,987 --> 00:38:18,486
Participants, did you hear that?

525
00:38:18,487 --> 00:38:21,986
I hope you'll do your best...

526
00:38:21,987 --> 00:38:23,887
with an enjoying heart.

527
00:38:26,657 --> 00:38:28,456
And on the opposite side of the audience,

528
00:38:28,457 --> 00:38:30,897
we have familiar faces.

529
00:38:32,797 --> 00:38:34,837
We have a great cheer.

530
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:39,266
To support the 16 participants, who have made it to the Finals,

531
00:38:39,267 --> 00:38:41,977
the participants, who had been on the BOYS II PLANET journey,

532
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:44,046
have joined us.

533
00:38:44,047 --> 00:38:45,647
It's been a while. It's good to see you.

534
00:38:52,487 --> 00:38:54,086
Since it's such a special day,

535
00:38:54,087 --> 00:38:57,627
we see many familiar faces.

536
00:39:00,257 --> 00:39:01,726
On behalf of all the participants,

537
00:39:01,727 --> 00:39:03,466
who came together to cheer on their friends,

538
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:07,197
I'd like to first say hello to one person.

539
00:39:09,037 --> 00:39:12,007
Lee Dong Heon, who is the oldest.

540
00:39:13,137 --> 00:39:14,377
How have you been?

541
00:39:15,007 --> 00:39:17,446
Hello. I'm Lee Dong Heon.

542
00:39:17,447 --> 00:39:18,447
Yes.

543
00:39:18,977 --> 00:39:20,547
You look well.

544
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:24,747
Why don't you say hello to the Star Creators?

545
00:39:24,917 --> 00:39:28,856
Thank you, everyon, e for making your way out here today.

546
00:39:28,857 --> 00:39:31,327
Seeing the heat from the Star Creators,

547
00:39:31,587 --> 00:39:34,797
I think we should power up the air conditioner to the maximum.

548
00:39:35,427 --> 00:39:37,096
Power up the air conditioner to the maximum!

549
00:39:37,097 --> 00:39:40,897
(Sun Fan Peng Forever)

550
00:39:41,737 --> 00:39:42,737
That was good.

551
00:39:42,937 --> 00:39:44,606
The 16 younger brothers...

552
00:39:44,607 --> 00:39:47,377
who made it to the Finals are quite nervous.

553
00:39:47,577 --> 00:39:50,707
Please share a word of support so that they won't be nervous.

554
00:39:52,177 --> 00:39:55,376
It's nerve-racking as if I was on the stage myself.

555
00:39:55,377 --> 00:39:59,617
I hope as they stand on stage carrying 160 people's dreams today,

556
00:39:59,917 --> 00:40:01,786
leave no regrets, and present a wonderful performance.

557
00:40:01,787 --> 00:40:04,326
I also hope they will leave a mark on the stage in the future.

558
00:40:04,327 --> 00:40:05,357
Go for it!

559
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:07,657
- Go for it! - Go for it!

560
00:40:08,727 --> 00:40:09,797
Thank you.

561
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:14,036
Thanks to the enthusiastic support of our expert Masters, our artists,

562
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:18,006
and our fellow participants,

563
00:40:18,007 --> 00:40:20,736
the 16 participants will be able to work even harder...

564
00:40:20,737 --> 00:40:23,077
to prepare for the stage.

565
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:31,547
After a little while,

566
00:40:31,747 --> 00:40:35,287
with the Star Creators from all over the world watching,

567
00:40:35,817 --> 00:40:38,787
the final stage that will determine the participants' fate,

568
00:40:39,157 --> 00:40:43,667
the Final Debut Battle will unfold.

569
00:40:59,077 --> 00:41:00,876
The Final Debut Battle is the final stage,

570
00:41:00,877 --> 00:41:03,817
where the participants are divided into 2 teams of 8...

571
00:41:04,187 --> 00:41:07,317
and perform new songs.

572
00:41:11,487 --> 00:41:12,827
The new songs are...

573
00:41:14,127 --> 00:41:15,626
"Brat Attitude..."

574
00:41:15,627 --> 00:41:18,367
and "Never Been 2 Heaven."

575
00:41:27,337 --> 00:41:30,807
(Jun Seo)

576
00:41:31,277 --> 00:41:33,616
With only one stage remaining,

577
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:36,347
every participant eagerly challenged themselves...

578
00:41:36,817 --> 00:41:39,087
to perform the killing part.

579
00:41:40,187 --> 00:41:42,687
And the winner of each song's killing part was...

580
00:41:42,817 --> 00:41:45,757
directly chosen by Star Creators...

581
00:41:46,227 --> 00:41:48,556
from around the world.

582
00:41:48,557 --> 00:41:49,926
(Yumeki, I love you.)

583
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:52,166
(Soon, the one chosen by the Star Creators...)

584
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:54,896
(for the killing part will be revealed.)

585
00:41:54,897 --> 00:41:59,336
Now, who will be the owners of the killing parts...

586
00:41:59,337 --> 00:42:01,836
(The one chosen by the Star Creators will be revealed.)

587
00:42:01,837 --> 00:42:02,977
chosen by the Star Creators?

588
00:42:11,547 --> 00:42:14,217
"Brat Attitude" and "Never Been 2 Heaven..."

589
00:42:14,687 --> 00:42:16,087
The one to take the killing part...

590
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:19,827
The one to take the killing part...

591
00:42:22,597 --> 00:42:24,127
will be revealed in a moment.

592
00:42:26,527 --> 00:42:28,566
Then, before we see the final performance,

593
00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:32,767
let's check out how the process of the last interim check...

594
00:42:33,007 --> 00:42:35,407
for the participants was.

595
00:42:51,557 --> 00:42:53,926
(Peaceful Planet Camp)

596
00:42:53,927 --> 00:42:57,396
(A strange noise that spread in the peaceful Planet Camp)

597
00:42:57,397 --> 00:43:02,937
(An ominous mood)

598
00:43:03,567 --> 00:43:07,437
(Two men with extraordinary vibe)

599
00:43:08,007 --> 00:43:10,176
This looks like a set from a different show.

600
00:43:10,177 --> 00:43:12,006
Yes. They said this is the same concept.

601
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:14,477
(What exactly are their identities?)

602
00:43:15,177 --> 00:43:17,486
- Look how this is decorated... - What is this?

603
00:43:17,487 --> 00:43:18,746
There is something inside.

604
00:43:18,747 --> 00:43:20,747
- There is something inside. - Gosh. What is this?

605
00:43:21,957 --> 00:43:23,863
- Counseling for concerns? - I know what this is.

606
00:43:23,887 --> 00:43:24,956
Come in.

607
00:43:24,957 --> 00:43:26,126
(Their identities are...)

608
00:43:26,127 --> 00:43:27,797
- Hello. - Hi.

609
00:43:27,997 --> 00:43:30,196
(Vocal Master ONESTAR and Rap Master JUSTHIS)

610
00:43:30,197 --> 00:43:32,096
BOYS II PLANET Counseling Center is a first for you, right?

611
00:43:32,097 --> 00:43:36,137
(BOYS II PLANET Counseling Center)

612
00:43:36,567 --> 00:43:39,407
Here is the psychic we hired with great difficulty.

613
00:43:39,707 --> 00:43:41,137
I came from Samcheong-dong.

614
00:43:41,607 --> 00:43:43,876
(Master JUSTHIS was curious...)

615
00:43:43,877 --> 00:43:45,747
(about participants' fortune.)

616
00:43:46,307 --> 00:43:49,646
Frankly, it's been two years since I've read people's fortune.

617
00:43:49,647 --> 00:43:51,007
- You are a professional. - Right.

618
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:54,517
I'll listen to your concerns...

619
00:43:54,617 --> 00:43:56,317
and read your fortunes.

620
00:43:57,587 --> 00:43:58,957
Do you have concerns, Leo?

621
00:44:00,597 --> 00:44:03,497
The biggest concern I have since I got to BOYS II PLANET...

622
00:44:04,297 --> 00:44:05,497
As we are in the final stages,

623
00:44:07,267 --> 00:44:08,967
I've been getting sleepy a lot more.

624
00:44:10,867 --> 00:44:12,736
(Lee Leo's concern...)

625
00:44:12,737 --> 00:44:14,806
(facing the Final Stage is...)

626
00:44:14,807 --> 00:44:17,207
(sleep?)

627
00:44:17,507 --> 00:44:19,606
- Normally, I don't sleep much. - Yes.

628
00:44:19,607 --> 00:44:21,347
- But suddenly I got more sleepy. - Right.

629
00:44:21,817 --> 00:44:23,623
How long has it been since you came from Australia?

630
00:44:23,647 --> 00:44:25,916
- It's been seven years. - Then you might still be...

631
00:44:25,917 --> 00:44:27,717
- jet-legged. - Right. I'm still...

632
00:44:28,017 --> 00:44:30,257
There is about a four-hour difference with Korea, right?

633
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:32,586
There is only one-hour difference.

634
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:33,757
One hour?

635
00:44:33,927 --> 00:44:36,527
(Laughter proportional to embarrassment)

636
00:44:36,827 --> 00:44:38,426
That one hour is big in the evenings.

637
00:44:38,427 --> 00:44:40,767
Of course. You could be sleepier.

638
00:44:41,697 --> 00:44:44,006
But his fortune includes...

639
00:44:44,007 --> 00:44:45,327
- His fortune includes... - Okay.

640
00:44:47,307 --> 00:44:49,306
The fortune of the white tiger and of leading stellar.

641
00:44:49,307 --> 00:44:50,376
- So, it's not easy. - White tiger?

642
00:44:50,377 --> 00:44:51,477
It's not easy.

643
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,776
- Why is it not easy? - It means that...

644
00:44:53,777 --> 00:44:55,177
- your life... - Yes?

645
00:44:55,577 --> 00:44:59,247
Is a life that earns charisma through hardship.

646
00:45:00,957 --> 00:45:02,117
Wait.

647
00:45:02,557 --> 00:45:04,457
(Nervous)

648
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,187
You are always in the higher rank,

649
00:45:06,457 --> 00:45:08,457
but you are always the last in the on-site voting.

650
00:45:08,957 --> 00:45:10,527
Is that the hardship you have?

651
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:12,366
(Lee Leo, 910 points)

652
00:45:12,367 --> 00:45:14,897
(Lee Leo's hardship that he endured in every mission)

653
00:45:15,437 --> 00:45:16,697
Is that the hardship you have?

654
00:45:17,267 --> 00:45:19,607
But you have so much patience.

655
00:45:19,937 --> 00:45:21,417
- You have so much patience. - Right.

656
00:45:21,907 --> 00:45:23,177
- Is that right? - Is that so?

657
00:45:24,247 --> 00:45:26,446
But to make this dream come true, I am...

658
00:45:26,447 --> 00:45:29,477
- spending seven years of my time... - Right.

659
00:45:29,617 --> 00:45:31,887
So I think I could give it some meaning that way.

660
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:34,387
- It's July 7, 2002. - Yes.

661
00:45:34,617 --> 00:45:35,917
- July 7? - Yes.

662
00:45:36,087 --> 00:45:37,327
Your birthday is great.

663
00:45:37,657 --> 00:45:38,986
(Master JUSTHIS's face becomes serious...)

664
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:41,297
(after checking Jia Hao's fortune.)

665
00:45:42,827 --> 00:45:45,197
(Who is the person that surprised the one-day psychic?)

666
00:45:45,397 --> 00:45:47,037
Have you had your fortune read before?

667
00:45:47,267 --> 00:45:49,837
Have you had your four pillars of destiny read before?

668
00:45:50,237 --> 00:45:51,907
(Have you seen such a thing before?)

669
00:45:52,237 --> 00:45:53,636
- Yes, I have. - You have.

670
00:45:53,637 --> 00:45:55,237
- Do you have such a thing China? - Yes.

671
00:45:56,737 --> 00:45:59,176
It's crazy. It's a field filled with charm.

672
00:45:59,177 --> 00:46:00,977
(It's crazy. It's a field filled with charm.)

673
00:46:01,017 --> 00:46:02,776
- Is it a fortune of charm? - It's a field of charm.

674
00:46:02,777 --> 00:46:04,587
He's the king of charm.

675
00:46:05,817 --> 00:46:08,487
(Fatal charm)

676
00:46:09,287 --> 00:46:10,427
That's so racy.

677
00:46:10,887 --> 00:46:12,356
Does it mean he's very sexy?

678
00:46:12,357 --> 00:46:14,457
(Zhang Jia Hao is filled with fatal charm.)

679
00:46:15,097 --> 00:46:18,527
What should I do to have a strong mentality?

680
00:46:18,597 --> 00:46:21,367
According to your fortune, you have a lot of patience.

681
00:46:21,467 --> 00:46:24,237
- Now it all makes sense. - Really?

682
00:46:24,637 --> 00:46:26,506
Because you don't express your emotions,

683
00:46:26,507 --> 00:46:30,006
you have a lot of mental difficulties.

684
00:46:30,007 --> 00:46:31,306
- That's the kind of fortune... - Suppressing a lot...

685
00:46:31,307 --> 00:46:32,847
- That kind of personality. - Yes.

686
00:46:33,047 --> 00:46:34,147
This is real.

687
00:46:34,377 --> 00:46:35,446
(JUSTHIS's fortune reading is at its full swing.)

688
00:46:35,447 --> 00:46:36,547
This is great.

689
00:46:37,647 --> 00:46:40,147
Do you have any concerns, Geon Woo?

690
00:46:40,957 --> 00:46:43,687
Honestly, that is my biggest concern these days.

691
00:46:44,257 --> 00:46:45,327
Well...

692
00:46:46,857 --> 00:46:50,197
With a goal to debut,

693
00:46:50,967 --> 00:46:52,697
I've spent time...

694
00:46:54,167 --> 00:46:55,337
close to seven years.

695
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:59,806
I think I still feel anxious.

696
00:46:59,807 --> 00:47:02,906
"I may not be in the Top Eight this time."

697
00:47:02,907 --> 00:47:05,467
"What do I do in that case?" I think I always have that thought.

698
00:47:06,347 --> 00:47:10,447
It makes you face every moment as if it was your last.

699
00:47:11,417 --> 00:47:14,887
I came to the Finals.

700
00:47:15,957 --> 00:47:18,627
- I'm worried if I can debut. - If you can debut.

701
00:47:20,027 --> 00:47:22,356
I really want to.

702
00:47:22,357 --> 00:47:23,657
With a high rank.

703
00:47:23,767 --> 00:47:24,897
Right.

704
00:47:28,167 --> 00:47:32,066
Since this is a survival show,

705
00:47:32,067 --> 00:47:35,276
it ranks you, and of course, you'd feel burdened by that,

706
00:47:35,277 --> 00:47:37,037
and you'd have to work harder to win.

707
00:47:37,147 --> 00:47:40,617
But so many people are watching you.

708
00:47:41,217 --> 00:47:44,047
You could think of that as a happy thing...

709
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:46,117
and produce a better performance.

710
00:47:46,617 --> 00:47:48,657
I think the fans would also want you to do that.

711
00:47:48,987 --> 00:47:52,587
They wouldn't want to see you pressured in worry you might fail.

712
00:47:52,687 --> 00:47:55,497
I think they would want to see you gain more strength from them.

713
00:47:56,027 --> 00:47:57,057
Right?

714
00:47:59,597 --> 00:48:01,436
Congratulations on making it to the Finals.

715
00:48:01,437 --> 00:48:04,067
I hope it turns out well until the end. I'll cheer for you.

716
00:48:06,937 --> 00:48:09,006
Once you get paid, make sure to send me a little tip.

717
00:48:09,007 --> 00:48:10,907
(Laughing)

718
00:48:12,847 --> 00:48:13,847
(The next day)

719
00:48:13,848 --> 00:48:15,276
Hello. What is this?

720
00:48:15,277 --> 00:48:16,376
- Hello. - What is this?

721
00:48:16,377 --> 00:48:17,886
- Hello. - Hello.

722
00:48:17,887 --> 00:48:19,187
Seriously.

723
00:48:19,287 --> 00:48:20,417
Welcome.

724
00:48:21,417 --> 00:48:22,456
(Welcome.)

725
00:48:22,457 --> 00:48:24,187
Here we are.

726
00:48:26,527 --> 00:48:28,257
Come here. Let's do it together.

727
00:48:29,897 --> 00:48:31,366
(The participants prepared the graduation ceremony...)

728
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:33,047
(of BOYS II PLANET with a grateful heart.)

729
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:34,997
(He's startled.)

730
00:48:35,067 --> 00:48:37,166
(They also prepared balloons with care.)

731
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:38,267
What was that?

732
00:48:38,467 --> 00:48:39,506
Look.

733
00:48:39,507 --> 00:48:41,477
(They prepared beautiful carnations and gifts.)

734
00:48:42,077 --> 00:48:43,106
Hello.

735
00:48:43,107 --> 00:48:45,106
We welcome the masters to the 2025 BOYS II PLANET...

736
00:48:45,107 --> 00:48:47,077
graduation ceremony!

737
00:48:49,347 --> 00:48:52,447
I'm Kim Jun Seo, the MC of the graduation ceremony.

738
00:48:55,587 --> 00:48:56,957
Where are the others?

739
00:48:57,287 --> 00:48:58,826
(Out of 16 people, only 9 attended the ceremony?)

740
00:48:58,827 --> 00:49:00,856
I know, right? One, two, three, four, five...

741
00:49:00,857 --> 00:49:02,726
(First of all!)

742
00:49:02,727 --> 00:49:05,266
First of all, to everyone who joined us on this long journey...

743
00:49:05,267 --> 00:49:06,927
Please answer him, MC.

744
00:49:07,437 --> 00:49:10,467
- Please answer him. - There's a secret event.

745
00:49:12,667 --> 00:49:13,936
- If you could wait a little, - All right.

746
00:49:13,937 --> 00:49:15,207
They will...

747
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:16,577
He's cute.

748
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,506
To express our gratitude...

749
00:49:18,507 --> 00:49:20,777
to the masters who have taught and guided us,

750
00:49:21,217 --> 00:49:23,047
we will deliver carnations.

751
00:49:23,147 --> 00:49:24,486
Come in!

752
00:49:24,487 --> 00:49:25,547
Let's go!

753
00:49:28,987 --> 00:49:30,286
Come in!

754
00:49:30,287 --> 00:49:31,357
Let's go!

755
00:49:32,827 --> 00:49:35,827
(Human carnations for the masters)

756
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,866
Goodness.

757
00:49:40,867 --> 00:49:43,167
(There's no way I won't shed a tear.)

758
00:49:43,737 --> 00:49:44,937
Don't put artificial tears.

759
00:49:45,037 --> 00:49:47,067
This is crazy.

760
00:49:47,877 --> 00:49:49,876
Don't cry, Master.

761
00:49:49,877 --> 00:49:51,547
(Don't cry, Master.)

762
00:49:51,747 --> 00:49:54,046
There are seven carnations.

763
00:49:54,047 --> 00:49:55,346
- Master ONESTAR. - Thank you.

764
00:49:55,347 --> 00:49:57,717
- Master JUSTHIS. - Here you go.

765
00:49:58,047 --> 00:49:59,286
Thank you.

766
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:01,486
We love you, the king of Masters.

767
00:50:01,487 --> 00:50:02,956
Teacher Seok Hoon, the honey voice.

768
00:50:02,957 --> 00:50:04,857
We give you love instead of a thumbs-up.

769
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,256
- We give you love. - Amazing.

770
00:50:07,257 --> 00:50:10,096
Next, please give it to Master Kany.

771
00:50:10,097 --> 00:50:12,666
The son will hand it to you.

772
00:50:12,667 --> 00:50:13,667
Look at me.

773
00:50:14,237 --> 00:50:15,266
Thank you.

774
00:50:15,267 --> 00:50:18,766
Finally, please hand it to Master Back Koo Young.

775
00:50:18,767 --> 00:50:21,607
Xin Long can tell Koo Young...

776
00:50:21,707 --> 00:50:23,106
to step out.

777
00:50:23,107 --> 00:50:24,347
(They're flustered.)

778
00:50:24,507 --> 00:50:25,947
I'll go home.

779
00:50:26,207 --> 00:50:27,877
No.

780
00:50:28,617 --> 00:50:30,216
Thank you.

781
00:50:30,217 --> 00:50:32,346
Next, we will have a congratulatory speech...

782
00:50:32,347 --> 00:50:34,456
from a representative of the graduates.

783
00:50:34,457 --> 00:50:36,887
- There are many items. - They prepared many things.

784
00:50:36,987 --> 00:50:38,987
The representative of the graduates, Lee Sang Won.

785
00:50:39,557 --> 00:50:41,327
Hello. It's Sang Won.

786
00:50:41,427 --> 00:50:44,827
On behalf of the other participants of BOYS II PLANET,

787
00:50:44,927 --> 00:50:48,167
I've been given the honor of expressing our gratitude to you.

788
00:50:48,267 --> 00:50:51,567
Over the nearly five months of filming,

789
00:50:51,907 --> 00:50:54,077
so much has happened,

790
00:50:54,507 --> 00:50:57,506
and through it all,

791
00:50:57,507 --> 00:50:59,347
you were always by our side.

792
00:51:00,747 --> 00:51:03,427
Make the sound while imagining you're hitting it through your nose.

793
00:51:03,917 --> 00:51:08,957
(Starting from the signal song training, which was all new to them)

794
00:51:09,187 --> 00:51:11,286
Both our disappointing moments...

795
00:51:11,287 --> 00:51:15,096
It doesn't bring out the essence of the killing part.

796
00:51:15,097 --> 00:51:16,157
Three to four hours.

797
00:51:16,427 --> 00:51:17,696
If you can't memorize this in 3 to 4 hours,

798
00:51:17,697 --> 00:51:18,927
you can't become singers.

799
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:21,196
And moments of doing well...

800
00:51:21,197 --> 00:51:24,906
(Our moments of growth)

801
00:51:24,907 --> 00:51:26,806
You made it well.

802
00:51:26,807 --> 00:51:28,237
It has a great balance.

803
00:51:28,577 --> 00:51:30,906
Have come together to shape the present...

804
00:51:30,907 --> 00:51:32,046
and create memories.

805
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:34,847
I feel like we can create an even better future.

806
00:51:35,347 --> 00:51:39,247
I feel I can boldly say that you were the best masters.

807
00:51:41,657 --> 00:51:43,857
Thank you so much for everything up until now.

808
00:51:44,287 --> 00:51:47,557
Thank you for your work. We love you.

809
00:51:49,527 --> 00:51:51,067
We love you!

810
00:51:51,267 --> 00:51:53,387
I can boldly say that you were the best participants.

811
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:56,036
(They're touched.)

812
00:51:56,037 --> 00:51:57,037
Seriously.

813
00:51:57,038 --> 00:51:58,536
- We put in our best effort. - We did our best.

814
00:51:58,537 --> 00:51:59,936
- Really? Thank you. - Thank you.

815
00:51:59,937 --> 00:52:02,006
- Thank you. - Thank you.

816
00:52:02,007 --> 00:52:03,137
So cute.

817
00:52:05,377 --> 00:52:07,076
- This is... - In hopes...

818
00:52:07,077 --> 00:52:08,216
that you would remember the 16 of us...

819
00:52:08,217 --> 00:52:10,277
for a long time,

820
00:52:10,317 --> 00:52:12,887
we made a one-of-a-kind, limited edition...

821
00:52:13,217 --> 00:52:14,656
BOYS II PLANET T-shirts.

822
00:52:14,657 --> 00:52:15,987
"Pull yourself together?"

823
00:52:16,587 --> 00:52:20,026
- BOYS II PLANET T-shirts. - Who drew this?

824
00:52:20,027 --> 00:52:21,726
Master Seok Hoon's T-shirt...

825
00:52:21,727 --> 00:52:24,597
will be explained by Kim Geon Woo...

826
00:52:24,697 --> 00:52:26,396
and Park Dong Gyu.

827
00:52:26,397 --> 00:52:27,896
I feel proud of you.

828
00:52:27,897 --> 00:52:29,496
- Thank you. - I mean it.

829
00:52:29,497 --> 00:52:31,737
- We put in our best effort. - With my sincere heart.

830
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:34,106
Are you guys thugs?

831
00:52:34,107 --> 00:52:35,336
(Another T-shirt brings out an intense reaction.)

832
00:52:35,337 --> 00:52:36,507
Thug.

833
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:37,747
Was it Lee Jeong?

834
00:52:38,077 --> 00:52:40,047
I thought you'd like it.

835
00:52:40,277 --> 00:52:44,347
I think you drew it after my album cover photo. Right?

836
00:52:44,447 --> 00:52:47,417
I saw our profile picture on BOYS II PLANET.

837
00:52:47,787 --> 00:52:48,886
I tried to capture your beauty.

838
00:52:48,887 --> 00:52:50,516
- You put in a lot of care... - Yes.

839
00:52:50,517 --> 00:52:51,857
In the details.

840
00:52:51,957 --> 00:52:53,256
Mine was drawn well.

841
00:52:53,257 --> 00:52:54,426
Who did this?

842
00:52:54,427 --> 00:52:57,666
- It was an artist. - It was drawn well.

843
00:52:57,667 --> 00:52:59,097
Was it Li Yu?

844
00:52:59,527 --> 00:53:00,896
Li Yu.

845
00:53:00,897 --> 00:53:02,096
I want Li Yu to draw mine.

846
00:53:02,097 --> 00:53:03,236
He should have drawn mine too.

847
00:53:03,237 --> 00:53:04,237
What is this?

848
00:53:04,337 --> 00:53:06,507
That's what would stay in your memories.

849
00:53:07,337 --> 00:53:08,906
It would stay in your memories!

850
00:53:08,907 --> 00:53:10,437
Do you have a face?

851
00:53:10,707 --> 00:53:13,846
Don't get it wrong. It's about our drawing skills.

852
00:53:13,847 --> 00:53:16,046
- Thank you so much. - You should look at the heart.

853
00:53:16,047 --> 00:53:19,887
- Thank you so much. - Thank you. Congratulations.

854
00:53:20,347 --> 00:53:24,227
They always gave sincere feedback.

855
00:53:24,487 --> 00:53:29,197
Since we celebrated it with the masters,

856
00:53:29,557 --> 00:53:31,557
it became a graduation ceremony I'll never forget.

857
00:53:32,097 --> 00:53:33,667
I love you, Masters.

858
00:53:36,697 --> 00:53:38,366
Let's start the interim check.

859
00:53:38,367 --> 00:53:39,367
Okay.

860
00:53:40,267 --> 00:53:43,807
This is going to be the last interim check.

861
00:53:45,077 --> 00:53:47,347
Time flew so quickly, if you think about it.

862
00:53:47,947 --> 00:53:49,977
That's right. It feels weird for us too.

863
00:53:50,177 --> 00:53:52,717
I always feel like this is the weirdest moment.

864
00:53:53,687 --> 00:53:55,086
I feel sad that it's coming to an end,

865
00:53:55,087 --> 00:53:57,217
although you would hope it would end quickly.

866
00:53:58,627 --> 00:54:00,927
We listened to this song before coming here.

867
00:54:01,027 --> 00:54:02,027
It's strong.

868
00:54:02,597 --> 00:54:07,697
("Brat Attitude" has a strong concept.)

869
00:54:09,937 --> 00:54:12,606
But there are many participants like Sang Hyeon and Li Yu...

870
00:54:12,607 --> 00:54:15,307
who mostly sang refreshing and cheerful songs.

871
00:54:15,637 --> 00:54:18,677
(Chung Sang Hyeon and Chuei Li Yu mainly had the refreshing concept.)

872
00:54:19,007 --> 00:54:20,046
How was it?

873
00:54:20,047 --> 00:54:22,716
I faced many difficulties while practicing it,

874
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:27,486
but I practiced with my team members and we helped each other out.

875
00:54:27,487 --> 00:54:29,617
So I think it's fine.

876
00:54:30,487 --> 00:54:32,757
Who took the killing part? Zhang Jia Hao and...

877
00:54:33,157 --> 00:54:35,596
Jia Hao and I are candidates.

878
00:54:35,597 --> 00:54:36,956
- You have candidates. - Yes.

879
00:54:36,957 --> 00:54:38,926
You've never taken the killing part until now.

880
00:54:38,927 --> 00:54:40,997
- Yes. We both haven't. - Right.

881
00:54:41,337 --> 00:54:44,207
Don't be disappointed even if you don't get it.

882
00:54:44,507 --> 00:54:45,507
Okay.

883
00:54:45,637 --> 00:54:46,867
You can look forward to it,

884
00:54:47,067 --> 00:54:48,136
but even if you don't get it, don't say, "I couldn't get it..."

885
00:54:48,137 --> 00:54:49,236
"until the end."

886
00:54:49,237 --> 00:54:50,706
- Don't be like that. - Okay.

887
00:54:50,707 --> 00:54:51,847
- All right? - Yes.

888
00:54:52,077 --> 00:54:53,677
- Shall we hear it? - Yes.

889
00:54:53,907 --> 00:54:57,117
(The final interim check for "Brat Attitude" begins.)

890
00:55:02,057 --> 00:55:03,357
It's really amazing.

891
00:55:17,137 --> 00:55:18,267
Li Yu.

892
00:55:18,907 --> 00:55:23,007
(They perform smoothly without mistakes.)

893
00:55:29,417 --> 00:55:31,457
(The final interim check for "Brat Attitude" ends.)

894
00:55:34,657 --> 00:55:36,616
Li Yu, I didn't even recognize you.

895
00:55:36,617 --> 00:55:39,387
- You did so well. - Thank you.

896
00:55:40,627 --> 00:55:42,296
As for the singing...

897
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,496
- Dong Gyu. - Dong Gyu did it mostly.

898
00:55:44,497 --> 00:55:45,927
Yumeki came forward in between.

899
00:55:46,767 --> 00:55:50,467
First of all, everyone dances so well,

900
00:55:50,567 --> 00:55:53,307
so I don't have much to say about that.

901
00:55:53,407 --> 00:55:56,577
There are things you've proven to us until now.

902
00:55:56,877 --> 00:55:59,177
At this point, we trust you.

903
00:55:59,277 --> 00:56:01,976
So I think you can continue as you were doing. Well done.

904
00:56:01,977 --> 00:56:04,047
- Thank you. - Thank you.

905
00:56:04,487 --> 00:56:06,687
Let's go, "Never Been 2 Heaven."

906
00:56:06,787 --> 00:56:08,716
Jun Min, Leo,

907
00:56:08,717 --> 00:56:10,886
Sang Won, and Geon Woo...

908
00:56:10,887 --> 00:56:14,697
have performed many songs with strong concepts.

909
00:56:15,557 --> 00:56:18,126
(Kim Jun Min, Lee Leo, Lee Sang Won, and Kim Geon Woo...)

910
00:56:18,127 --> 00:56:20,727
(mainly performed songs with strong concepts.)

911
00:56:22,197 --> 00:56:25,266
For me, it was a new concept,

912
00:56:25,267 --> 00:56:27,937
- but the song was very exciting. - Right.

913
00:56:28,177 --> 00:56:29,606
So I think I can do this well.

914
00:56:29,607 --> 00:56:31,206
Shall we watch it?

915
00:56:31,207 --> 00:56:32,247
- Yes. - All right.

916
00:56:32,507 --> 00:56:35,647
(The final interim check for "Never Been 2 Heaven" begins.)

917
00:56:43,987 --> 00:56:46,267
(The final interim check for "Never Been 2 Heaven" ends.)

918
00:56:46,587 --> 00:56:47,587
He keeps getting shy.

919
00:56:47,588 --> 00:56:50,496
Your face keeps getting red because you feel shy.

920
00:56:50,497 --> 00:56:52,926
- Especially Leo. - He's so shy.

921
00:56:52,927 --> 00:56:54,767
(He showed confidence just a few minutes ago.)

922
00:56:55,367 --> 00:56:57,937
(However, his face keeps getting redder as they continue.)

923
00:56:58,807 --> 00:57:01,006
Your face kept getting redder as the performance continued.

924
00:57:01,007 --> 00:57:02,836
Leo isn't even looking at us.

925
00:57:02,837 --> 00:57:03,876
He's staring at the floor.

926
00:57:03,877 --> 00:57:05,007
Gosh, that's so funny.

927
00:57:05,507 --> 00:57:07,276
You might feel a bit awkward...

928
00:57:07,277 --> 00:57:08,777
about this performance.

929
00:57:09,277 --> 00:57:10,476
But it doesn't feel that way...

930
00:57:10,477 --> 00:57:11,716
- when we watch it. - Right.

931
00:57:11,717 --> 00:57:13,116
- Not at all. - You don't have to feel shy.

932
00:57:13,117 --> 00:57:14,517
That's what I'd like to say.

933
00:57:15,157 --> 00:57:16,556
- You guys need to have fun. - Right.

934
00:57:16,557 --> 00:57:18,186
For songs like this...

935
00:57:18,187 --> 00:57:19,827
Let me share my thoughts about this song.

936
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:21,526
You must have fun even during practice.

937
00:57:21,527 --> 00:57:23,926
You have to chat and laugh.

938
00:57:23,927 --> 00:57:26,926
You need to be playful while practicing. That way,

939
00:57:26,927 --> 00:57:29,767
you can truly enjoy the performance when you're on stage.

940
00:57:30,767 --> 00:57:33,366
But as for "Brat Attitude," when you practice...

941
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:34,637
(Looking rebellious)

942
00:57:34,777 --> 00:57:35,877
We need to fight.

943
00:57:36,237 --> 00:57:38,546
It would be nice if you guys can work...

944
00:57:38,547 --> 00:57:41,716
on that attitude and vibe while practicing for your performance.

945
00:57:41,717 --> 00:57:42,776
- Okay. - Okay.

946
00:57:42,777 --> 00:57:45,257
This is the final performance. How do you feel? Let's hear it.

947
00:57:45,647 --> 00:57:47,857
I'm very nervous.

948
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:50,287
But I'm also looking forward to it.

949
00:57:50,457 --> 00:57:51,586
It's quite touching.

950
00:57:51,587 --> 00:57:53,457
We've been filming this show...

951
00:57:53,587 --> 00:57:55,626
for four months together.

952
00:57:55,627 --> 00:57:58,226
Since this is the last performance together, it makes me think...

953
00:57:58,227 --> 00:57:59,897
that I must give my absolute best.

954
00:58:00,497 --> 00:58:03,267
I kept feeling the pressure while preparing for the performance.

955
00:58:03,697 --> 00:58:05,536
But now that this is our final performance,

956
00:58:05,537 --> 00:58:07,137
I actually feel at ease.

957
00:58:09,307 --> 00:58:11,427
I think I can have fun preparing for the performance.

958
00:58:11,547 --> 00:58:14,076
- That's a relief. - Isn't that the kind of emotion...

959
00:58:14,077 --> 00:58:15,376
only hard workers can feel?

960
00:58:15,377 --> 00:58:16,617
- Right. - Yes.

961
00:58:16,947 --> 00:58:18,016
That's cool.

962
00:58:18,017 --> 00:58:19,086
Good job.

963
00:58:19,087 --> 00:58:20,087
- Thank you. - Thank you.

964
00:58:20,088 --> 00:58:24,887
(Their last interim check is over.)

965
00:58:31,167 --> 00:58:32,867
(Seok Hoon, KINKY)

966
00:58:39,437 --> 00:58:42,206
That was their last interim check.

967
00:58:42,207 --> 00:58:45,307
You know what? Master JUSTHIS.

968
00:58:45,447 --> 00:58:46,947
Are you there? Hello.

969
00:58:48,177 --> 00:58:49,946
- Hello. - Hello.

970
00:58:49,947 --> 00:58:53,347
It looks like you're an excellent saju reader.

971
00:58:54,347 --> 00:58:56,587
- Yes. - So I have a question.

972
00:58:56,917 --> 00:59:00,087
Which participants have the saju that predicts a debut?

973
00:59:01,497 --> 00:59:05,396
Well, saju is just saju.

974
00:59:05,397 --> 00:59:08,966
I believe that participants who made an appropriate effort...

975
00:59:08,967 --> 00:59:12,307
will receive favorable results.

976
00:59:13,107 --> 00:59:15,177
Even I would be able to say something like that.

977
00:59:15,877 --> 00:59:17,707
You can sense that he might be winging this.

978
00:59:18,177 --> 00:59:21,876
However, he gave us a very positive answer.

979
00:59:21,877 --> 00:59:23,647
Thank you for that.

980
00:59:24,117 --> 00:59:27,447
There are more clips other than the ones we just watched.

981
00:59:28,057 --> 00:59:30,386
The unaired footage...

982
00:59:30,387 --> 00:59:34,056
of BOYS II PLANET will be revealed...

983
00:59:34,057 --> 00:59:37,056
on Mnet Plus. Please look forward to the clips.

984
00:59:37,057 --> 00:59:40,266
Please stay tuned to watch...

985
00:59:40,267 --> 00:59:43,497
about the unaired clips.

986
00:59:47,437 --> 00:59:48,437
And...

987
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:50,807
everyone is looking forward...

988
00:59:51,177 --> 00:59:54,646
to finding out one more thing other than the debut group...

989
00:59:54,647 --> 00:59:56,277
after tonight's performances.

990
01:00:05,157 --> 01:00:06,857
All right.

991
01:00:08,127 --> 01:00:10,457
It will be revealed for the first time today.

992
01:00:11,227 --> 01:00:13,397
It's the name of the debut group!

993
01:00:14,837 --> 01:00:20,466
(The name of the final debut group will be revealed.)

994
01:00:20,467 --> 01:00:24,676
(The name of the final debut group will be revealed.)

995
01:00:24,677 --> 01:00:28,617
This name will group the eight boys...

996
01:00:28,747 --> 01:00:30,946
who will make a debut on BOYS II PLANET.

997
01:00:30,947 --> 01:00:33,117
What will the name be?

998
01:00:34,787 --> 01:00:38,457
(Kang Woo Jin)

999
01:00:43,257 --> 01:00:45,367
I'm quite curious too.

1000
01:00:45,627 --> 01:00:47,367
The final Top Eight...

1001
01:00:48,637 --> 01:00:50,297
will perform...

1002
01:00:51,537 --> 01:00:53,107
under this very name.

1003
01:01:00,977 --> 01:01:04,317
We'll reveal it now.

1004
01:01:32,007 --> 01:01:34,407
Feel the catharsis of the K-pop drive.

1005
01:01:41,287 --> 01:01:43,787
It's ALPHA DRIVE ONE.

1006
01:01:44,387 --> 01:01:45,587
It's ALD1.

1007
01:02:02,607 --> 01:02:04,507
(Park Dong Gyu)

1008
01:02:08,347 --> 01:02:09,947
ALPHA DRIVE ONE.

1009
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:15,757
ALD1 represents an official team of the Top 8...

1010
01:02:16,117 --> 01:02:20,257
who has the goal, passion, and drive to become the best.

1011
01:02:25,827 --> 01:02:29,467
Star Creators' support give birth...

1012
01:02:30,097 --> 01:02:31,507
to ALPHA DRIVE ONE.

1013
01:02:32,307 --> 01:02:34,936
Please look forward to the growth...

1014
01:02:34,937 --> 01:02:37,607
and grand leap of the debut group...

1015
01:02:38,177 --> 01:02:40,247
produced by BOYS II PLANET.

1016
01:02:49,357 --> 01:02:51,456
All right. The name of the group has been revealed.

1017
01:02:51,457 --> 01:02:54,896
Masters. What do you think about the name of the group?

1018
01:02:54,897 --> 01:02:58,197
Could you share your thoughts on the name?

1019
01:03:01,367 --> 01:03:04,167
All right. Hello. I'm Vocal Master ONESTAR.

1020
01:03:04,637 --> 01:03:06,637
ALPHA DRIVE ONE.

1021
01:03:07,637 --> 01:03:12,276
I believe it's an incredibly great name.

1022
01:03:12,277 --> 01:03:13,747
It's ALD1 for short.

1023
01:03:14,007 --> 01:03:16,176
- It's ALD1 for short? - That's right.

1024
01:03:16,177 --> 01:03:17,776
We're going with ALD1, not ALPHA1?

1025
01:03:17,777 --> 01:03:20,487
- It's ALD1. - ALD1? Okay.

1026
01:03:20,987 --> 01:03:22,817
I'm sure I'll get used to that.

1027
01:03:22,917 --> 01:03:24,726
That's a great name indeed.

1028
01:03:24,727 --> 01:03:26,956
After hearing the meaning behind the name,

1029
01:03:26,957 --> 01:03:29,197
I can completely understand how the name came about.

1030
01:03:29,657 --> 01:03:34,426
Among the 16 participants who advanced to the finals,

1031
01:03:34,427 --> 01:03:37,366
eight of them will make a debut today...

1032
01:03:37,367 --> 01:03:38,807
ALPHA DRIVE ONE.

1033
01:03:39,707 --> 01:03:42,776
Regardless of who ends up making a debut as ALPHA DRIVE ONE,

1034
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:46,076
I would sincerely hope that they will perform together as one...

1035
01:03:46,077 --> 01:03:49,946
and drive the whole world into the K-pop frenzy.

1036
01:03:49,947 --> 01:03:51,907
I'm rooting for them from the bottom of my heart.

1037
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:55,787
The new era of ALPHA DRIVE ONE is coming.

1038
01:03:57,157 --> 01:03:58,187
Thank you.

1039
01:04:00,987 --> 01:04:04,966
All right. ALPHA DRIVE ONE. It's ALD1 for short.

1040
01:04:04,967 --> 01:04:08,467
Okay. Thank you for your comment.

1041
01:04:08,697 --> 01:04:10,896
I'm looking forward to the future...

1042
01:04:10,897 --> 01:04:15,206
of ALPHA DRIVE ONE, ALD1,

1043
01:04:15,207 --> 01:04:17,107
who will unite as one.

1044
01:04:21,377 --> 01:04:24,786
ALPHA DRIVE ONE will be a global sensation.

1045
01:04:24,787 --> 01:04:25,816
(The official social media page of ALPHA DRIVE ONE)

1046
01:04:25,817 --> 01:04:27,617
You can keep up...

1047
01:04:28,217 --> 01:04:31,116
with the news of ALPHA DRIVE ONE through...

1048
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:32,333
their official social media page.

1049
01:04:32,357 --> 01:04:36,327
I kindly ask that you show them a lot of support.

1050
01:04:38,827 --> 01:04:41,836
Which eight participants...

1051
01:04:41,837 --> 01:04:45,967
will make a debut tonight as ALPHA DRIVE ONE?

1052
01:04:46,867 --> 01:04:49,777
Stay tuned until the end to find out.

1053
01:04:50,077 --> 01:04:53,876
(Sang Hyeon)

1054
01:04:53,877 --> 01:04:56,146
(Let's go, Leo!)

1055
01:04:56,147 --> 01:04:58,387
(Congratulations on your debut, Sang Won!)

1056
01:05:00,287 --> 01:05:03,816
Their final mission, the Final Debut Battle,

1057
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:06,287
will decide the eight participants...

1058
01:05:06,987 --> 01:05:10,927
to make a debut as ALPHA DRIVE ONE.

1059
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:15,966
It's time to watch the first performance...

1060
01:05:15,967 --> 01:05:17,867
of the Final Debut Battle.

1061
01:05:23,937 --> 01:05:25,947
The first performance we'll watch...

1062
01:05:27,177 --> 01:05:28,717
is "Brat Attitude."

1063
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:35,956
(The performance of "Brat Attitude" will be revealed!)

1064
01:05:35,957 --> 01:05:37,886
(Dong Gyu, you're the best!)

1065
01:05:37,887 --> 01:05:39,787
(Geon Woo, I hope to see you for a long time!)

1066
01:05:42,027 --> 01:05:45,027
Two candidates for the killing part were revealed.

1067
01:05:45,527 --> 01:05:46,567
Yumeki.

1068
01:05:47,767 --> 01:05:49,066
Zhang Jia Hao.

1069
01:05:49,067 --> 01:05:50,736
(Yumeki)

1070
01:05:50,737 --> 01:05:53,136
Which one of them has taken...

1071
01:05:53,137 --> 01:05:56,637
the killing part of "Brat Attitude?"

1072
01:05:57,477 --> 01:05:59,506
Look forward to finding out who the lucky participant is.

1073
01:05:59,507 --> 01:06:02,747
(Let's make a debut, Zhang Jia Hao.)

1074
01:06:04,217 --> 01:06:06,447
The first performance of the Final Debut Battle...

1075
01:06:07,047 --> 01:06:09,987
is "Brat Attitude."

1076
01:06:14,157 --> 01:06:16,027
Let's check it out now!

1077
01:06:22,867 --> 01:06:26,106
(Their final performance is around the corner.)

1078
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:28,807
(Team "Brat Attitude" is focused on their practice as usual.)

1079
01:06:29,377 --> 01:06:30,406
Two, three.

1080
01:06:30,407 --> 01:06:32,376
(They stop their practice session for an announcement.)

1081
01:06:32,377 --> 01:06:33,907
(What's going on?)

1082
01:06:34,107 --> 01:06:35,416
You've been stuck here, practicing...

1083
01:06:35,417 --> 01:06:37,846
- for the final performance. - Yes.

1084
01:06:37,847 --> 01:06:39,286
We want to give you some free time.

1085
01:06:39,287 --> 01:06:40,686
- What? - What?

1086
01:06:40,687 --> 01:06:42,517
(He can't think straight as he's so happy.)

1087
01:06:42,687 --> 01:06:43,716
What do you mean?

1088
01:06:43,717 --> 01:06:44,856
Free time?

1089
01:06:44,857 --> 01:06:46,626
We want you to go somewhere...

1090
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:49,003
that can inspire you for the concept of the final performance.

1091
01:06:49,027 --> 01:06:50,126
Concept?

1092
01:06:50,127 --> 01:06:51,257
Where should I go?

1093
01:06:51,927 --> 01:06:55,336
When you think about our song,

1094
01:06:55,337 --> 01:06:56,796
- It has that "I don't care" vibe. - Yes.

1095
01:06:56,797 --> 01:06:58,767
So it's a bit like...

1096
01:06:59,067 --> 01:07:00,667
going to the swimming pool...

1097
01:07:00,707 --> 01:07:03,106
- What? - Swimming pool?

1098
01:07:03,107 --> 01:07:04,537
(Swimming pool, all of a sudden?)

1099
01:07:04,737 --> 01:07:06,337
What does that have to do with the song?

1100
01:07:06,707 --> 01:07:08,416
Isn't it you want to swim?

1101
01:07:08,417 --> 01:07:10,046
- I want to swim. - Right.

1102
01:07:10,047 --> 01:07:11,747
(I don't care even if I can't swim.)

1103
01:07:12,117 --> 01:07:13,363
There's something like that as well.

1104
01:07:13,387 --> 01:07:15,587
Who hasn't bleached their hair before?

1105
01:07:15,687 --> 01:07:17,316
- Bleaching sounds fun as well. - Bleaching.

1106
01:07:17,317 --> 01:07:19,186
- Dying our hair together. - Together.

1107
01:07:19,187 --> 01:07:20,757
Or shaving our heads together.

1108
01:07:21,897 --> 01:07:24,356
Jia Hao really seems to want to do the Final Stage.

1109
01:07:24,357 --> 01:07:26,826
That the Final Stage will really be a legendary one.

1110
01:07:26,827 --> 01:07:28,667
- A legendary stage. - A legendary stage.

1111
01:07:29,137 --> 01:07:30,257
Everyone shaving their head.

1112
01:07:31,397 --> 01:07:33,706
Then wholeheartedly,

1113
01:07:33,707 --> 01:07:36,177
since we are preparing for the last moment,

1114
01:07:36,407 --> 01:07:38,476
we should think of it as awakening our minds...

1115
01:07:38,477 --> 01:07:40,847
(What is Kim Jun Seo's idea?)

1116
01:07:41,247 --> 01:07:43,317
and do bungee jumping.

1117
01:07:43,477 --> 01:07:45,317
(Surprised)

1118
01:07:45,447 --> 01:07:46,587
That sounds great.

1119
01:07:46,647 --> 01:07:48,117
That's nice.

1120
01:07:48,417 --> 01:07:49,457
Let's do bungee jumping.

1121
01:07:49,587 --> 01:07:52,187
I can't.

1122
01:07:52,287 --> 01:07:55,197
No, I can't.

1123
01:07:55,397 --> 01:07:57,797
Jun Seo, if we do that,

1124
01:07:57,927 --> 01:07:59,296
that will be the end of my life.

1125
01:07:59,297 --> 01:08:02,237
(It's the end of my life.)

1126
01:08:02,397 --> 01:08:04,036
Then we can't.

1127
01:08:04,037 --> 01:08:05,966
It's because I'm so scared.

1128
01:08:05,967 --> 01:08:07,567
I can't do it either.

1129
01:08:08,107 --> 01:08:09,906
(What is the fate...)

1130
01:08:09,907 --> 01:08:11,867
(of the two representative cowards born in 2005?)

1131
01:08:12,047 --> 01:08:14,406
(They left the Planet Camp...)

1132
01:08:14,407 --> 01:08:16,247
(and drove for a long time.)

1133
01:08:16,777 --> 01:08:19,646
(Where did Team "Brat Attitude" arrive at?)

1134
01:08:19,647 --> 01:08:20,647
Let's go.

1135
01:08:22,387 --> 01:08:23,487
What is this place?

1136
01:08:23,557 --> 01:08:24,587
What is it?

1137
01:08:24,617 --> 01:08:26,787
- Hey. - Yes.

1138
01:08:26,887 --> 01:08:30,097
- What are you guys going to do? - Isn't that what everyone likes?

1139
01:08:33,297 --> 01:08:35,796
- Gosh. - We came to do bungee jumping.

1140
01:08:35,797 --> 01:08:38,043
(Team "Brat Attitude" arrived at the Bungee Jumping place.)

1141
01:08:38,067 --> 01:08:39,136
It's 50m.

1142
01:08:39,137 --> 01:08:41,267
- It's too high. - You can't even see it.

1143
01:08:41,737 --> 01:08:43,377
Gosh. This is driving me crazy.

1144
01:08:45,007 --> 01:08:46,676
The concept for this song...

1145
01:08:46,677 --> 01:08:48,616
made me think of deviating from daily life.

1146
01:08:48,617 --> 01:08:50,847
By challenging to do things you normally wouldn't do,

1147
01:08:50,977 --> 01:08:53,016
I thought it would be a good idea to bungee jump...

1148
01:08:53,017 --> 01:08:54,647
to awaken our minds.

1149
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:58,187
(But there are exceptions.)

1150
01:08:58,427 --> 01:09:00,026
(Going up in earnest)

1151
01:09:00,027 --> 01:09:01,057
It seems fun.

1152
01:09:01,127 --> 01:09:05,367
(He Xing Long was so scared that he couldn't even open his eyes.)

1153
01:09:05,997 --> 01:09:07,096
(Unlike the team members who are leisurely watching)

1154
01:09:07,097 --> 01:09:09,296
It's going up again.

1155
01:09:09,297 --> 01:09:11,037
(Park Dong Gyu has given up.)

1156
01:09:11,367 --> 01:09:13,467
Let's go.

1157
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:15,076
It's not as high as I thought.

1158
01:09:15,077 --> 01:09:16,236
Just look straight ahead.

1159
01:09:16,237 --> 01:09:17,607
The scenery is really nice.

1160
01:09:17,937 --> 01:09:19,377
- Gosh. - Hello.

1161
01:09:19,607 --> 01:09:21,047
- Hi. - Gosh.

1162
01:09:21,177 --> 01:09:22,747
My eyes are wide open, and it's nice.

1163
01:09:22,917 --> 01:09:23,947
It's really nice.

1164
01:09:24,047 --> 01:09:25,616
- Hello. - Hello.

1165
01:09:25,617 --> 01:09:27,086
(Standing far away)

1166
01:09:27,087 --> 01:09:28,217
- Can you see? - Gosh.

1167
01:09:28,517 --> 01:09:30,517
- Who are you saying "hello" to? - Look over here.

1168
01:09:30,587 --> 01:09:31,787
Look at the drone over there.

1169
01:09:31,887 --> 01:09:33,086
- Hi. - What's up?

1170
01:09:33,087 --> 01:09:34,226
(Everyone is saying hello towards the drone.)

1171
01:09:34,227 --> 01:09:35,627
- Gosh. - Hi.

1172
01:09:36,457 --> 01:09:38,156
This is really nice.

1173
01:09:38,157 --> 01:09:40,037
(He Xin Long is speechless while looking down.)

1174
01:09:40,297 --> 01:09:41,967
I'm speechless.

1175
01:09:42,367 --> 01:09:43,997
I don't think he could do it.

1176
01:09:44,037 --> 01:09:47,467
(Will coward number 1 and 2 succeed?)

1177
01:09:47,707 --> 01:09:49,176
- As the team representative... - Yes.

1178
01:09:49,177 --> 01:09:50,277
I'll go first.

1179
01:09:50,837 --> 01:09:52,606
- You are a leader. - Your courage.

1180
01:09:52,607 --> 01:09:54,607
- You can do this. - Let's go.

1181
01:09:55,447 --> 01:09:57,516
- Good grace. - Let's go.

1182
01:09:57,517 --> 01:09:59,187
(Team members found Yumeki.)

1183
01:10:00,087 --> 01:10:01,807
Is he going to do it? He is going to do it.

1184
01:10:02,087 --> 01:10:03,287
I can't see this.

1185
01:10:03,317 --> 01:10:05,586
Yumeki, let's break the limits we have in the team.

1186
01:10:05,587 --> 01:10:07,526
- Okay. I'll break the limits. - Let's go.

1187
01:10:07,527 --> 01:10:08,827
- Let's go. - I'm going to jump.

1188
01:10:09,027 --> 01:10:10,097
Okay. Three.

1189
01:10:10,727 --> 01:10:11,767
Go.

1190
01:10:14,027 --> 01:10:15,437
One, bungee.

1191
01:10:16,997 --> 01:10:18,767
(Yumeki jumped without hesitation.)

1192
01:10:19,207 --> 01:10:20,237
Bungee.

1193
01:10:21,337 --> 01:10:22,977
Goodness.

1194
01:10:24,307 --> 01:10:26,007
Great.

1195
01:10:31,717 --> 01:10:33,217
That's crazy.

1196
01:10:33,747 --> 01:10:36,117
(Yumeki is upbeat.)

1197
01:10:36,757 --> 01:10:39,086
(The second runner, Chung Sang Hyeon, )

1198
01:10:39,087 --> 01:10:41,957
(succeeded in bungee jumping.)

1199
01:10:42,297 --> 01:10:45,027
(Chung Sang Hyeon jumped in a brat gesture.)

1200
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:51,397
Let's do well until the final stage.

1201
01:10:52,007 --> 01:10:54,067
(Kim Jun Seo jumped with determination.)

1202
01:10:56,737 --> 01:10:58,577
Star Creators, I love you.

1203
01:11:01,307 --> 01:11:04,047
(Zhang Jia Hao also succeeded in bungee jumping with gratitude.)

1204
01:11:04,117 --> 01:11:06,447
(Laughing)

1205
01:11:06,747 --> 01:11:07,916
Life is...

1206
01:11:07,917 --> 01:11:09,957
about living for these few moments.

1207
01:11:11,287 --> 01:11:13,287
(Chen Kai Wen jumped with a wise saying.)

1208
01:11:15,057 --> 01:11:16,126
Love you.

1209
01:11:16,127 --> 01:11:17,627
- Look. - Gosh.

1210
01:11:18,697 --> 01:11:20,467
Why is he good at jumping?

1211
01:11:20,797 --> 01:11:22,096
(6 members out of 8 succeeded in bungee jumping.)

1212
01:11:22,097 --> 01:11:24,237
- Let's go. - That was a good jump.

1213
01:11:24,637 --> 01:11:26,907
- Seriously... - He really is good.

1214
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:28,676
- He's so cool. - Will he do well?

1215
01:11:28,677 --> 01:11:31,307
(Now, there are only two people left.)

1216
01:11:31,677 --> 01:11:36,147
(Will he succeed in bungee jumping, which he was extremely scared of?)

1217
01:11:37,977 --> 01:11:39,857
(Park Dong Gyu is on the bungee jump platform.)

1218
01:11:42,217 --> 01:11:43,887
Gosh, this is crazy.

1219
01:11:44,817 --> 01:11:45,926
He's going to do it.

1220
01:11:45,927 --> 01:11:47,447
- Is he jumping right away? - Will he?

1221
01:11:48,457 --> 01:11:49,597
Gosh.

1222
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:51,827
I will definitely debut...

1223
01:11:52,827 --> 01:11:54,097
from BOYS II PLANET.

1224
01:11:54,297 --> 01:11:56,667
- Dong Gyu, let's go. - Dong Gyu, let's go.

1225
01:11:56,897 --> 01:11:58,867
Three, two,

1226
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:02,077
one.

1227
01:12:04,677 --> 01:12:06,797
(He succeeded in bungee jumping overcoming his fear.)

1228
01:12:08,247 --> 01:12:09,617
(Respect)

1229
01:12:10,447 --> 01:12:12,287
I can only ride carousels.

1230
01:12:14,217 --> 01:12:17,687
(He succeeded in bungee jumping with an earnest heart.)

1231
01:12:18,257 --> 01:12:19,726
Really, I thought I couldn't jump.

1232
01:12:19,727 --> 01:12:22,457
But as soon as I spoke those words, my body fell.

1233
01:12:22,557 --> 01:12:24,696
I thought I'd become a person that could truly digest...

1234
01:12:24,697 --> 01:12:27,297
a brat attitude.

1235
01:12:28,697 --> 01:12:31,537
(All previous participants successfully bungee jumped.)

1236
01:12:32,167 --> 01:12:33,867
(He Xin Long was the only one left.)

1237
01:12:36,807 --> 01:12:37,937
Mister...

1238
01:12:40,777 --> 01:12:44,077
(The dizzying height was felt anew as he stood on the platform.)

1239
01:12:44,317 --> 01:12:45,686
(The team members were watching from below.)

1240
01:12:45,687 --> 01:12:47,116
He's going to do it.

1241
01:12:47,117 --> 01:12:48,447
Let's go, Xin Long.

1242
01:12:48,717 --> 01:12:49,787
Let's go.

1243
01:12:50,517 --> 01:12:51,587
Let's go.

1244
01:12:52,087 --> 01:12:54,087
Gosh, this...

1245
01:12:54,587 --> 01:12:56,127
Put your foot out and stand.

1246
01:12:56,827 --> 01:12:58,026
(He bucked up his courage and stretched out his leg.)

1247
01:12:58,027 --> 01:12:59,427
Gosh, this...

1248
01:13:02,637 --> 01:13:04,997
In my entire life,

1249
01:13:05,337 --> 01:13:06,967
people called me a coward.

1250
01:13:09,507 --> 01:13:12,847
I wish I could change.

1251
01:13:13,307 --> 01:13:15,777
(Why did my past-self say that?)

1252
01:13:16,277 --> 01:13:17,577
But I think he could do it.

1253
01:13:17,877 --> 01:13:19,917
(Slowly)

1254
01:13:20,117 --> 01:13:21,387
(Gosh)

1255
01:13:21,917 --> 01:13:24,157
(But his body won't follow his heart.)

1256
01:13:24,487 --> 01:13:25,587
I can't.

1257
01:13:25,957 --> 01:13:27,757
- This... - Yes?

1258
01:13:28,157 --> 01:13:29,197
I can't.

1259
01:13:30,457 --> 01:13:32,267
Don't do it in this lifetime.

1260
01:13:33,967 --> 01:13:35,027
Okay.

1261
01:13:35,167 --> 01:13:36,997
It was a shame really.

1262
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:39,036
You did well.

1263
01:13:39,037 --> 01:13:41,166
You did well just by going up there.

1264
01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:42,907
- No. - You did well.

1265
01:13:43,037 --> 01:13:44,836
By jumping, it felt like...

1266
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:47,676
- we broke our limits. - We did.

1267
01:13:47,677 --> 01:13:49,176
Let's do well until the last performance.

1268
01:13:49,177 --> 01:13:50,577
- Yes. - Yes.

1269
01:13:51,347 --> 01:13:53,117
On stage, I will do my best...

1270
01:13:53,247 --> 01:13:54,946
and never give up,

1271
01:13:54,947 --> 01:13:56,316
like I did in bungee jumping.

1272
01:13:56,317 --> 01:13:58,557
(Back in the practice room after the break)

1273
01:13:58,927 --> 01:14:02,557
(Driven by a fervent desire for the final stage, )

1274
01:14:02,657 --> 01:14:07,567
(Team "Brat Attitude" united and dedicated itself to practice.)

1275
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:09,297
I'm dying.

1276
01:14:09,737 --> 01:14:11,037
Gosh, I'm dying.

1277
01:14:12,207 --> 01:14:13,806
(Recharging with a refreshing peach-flavored drink after practice)

1278
01:14:13,807 --> 01:14:15,166
- This is our deviance. - Look at him.

1279
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,937
(Training D-Day)

1280
01:14:17,707 --> 01:14:18,777
Let's hear it then.

1281
01:14:18,907 --> 01:14:21,647
(The last training starts for Team "Brat Attitude" starts.)

1282
01:14:36,857 --> 01:14:37,896
You are good.

1283
01:14:37,897 --> 01:14:39,597
Dong Gyu, your voice is really nice.

1284
01:14:40,497 --> 01:14:42,196
It really sounds like a cave.

1285
01:14:42,197 --> 01:14:43,236
It's Dong Cave.

1286
01:14:43,237 --> 01:14:44,813
Your tone fits really well with the song.

1287
01:14:44,837 --> 01:14:47,267
- Thank you. - If you practice like this,

1288
01:14:47,337 --> 01:14:49,476
you could really turn over the stage.

1289
01:14:49,477 --> 01:14:50,506
You guys are good.

1290
01:14:50,507 --> 01:14:52,307
Shall we take a look at the killing part?

1291
01:14:52,607 --> 01:14:55,477
(Candidates for the killing part now are Zhang Jia Hao and Yumeki.)

1292
01:14:55,817 --> 01:14:58,097
("Brat Attitude" killing part Candidate 1: Zhang Jia Hao)

1293
01:15:03,387 --> 01:15:06,627
("Brat Attitude" killing part Candidate 2: Yumeki)

1294
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:19,506
They both have different styles.

1295
01:15:19,507 --> 01:15:20,507
They are like a hot pot.

1296
01:15:20,508 --> 01:15:21,866
They are like a clear soup...

1297
01:15:21,867 --> 01:15:23,407
and clear mala soup.

1298
01:15:24,107 --> 01:15:26,006
Honestly, both are good at dancing.

1299
01:15:26,007 --> 01:15:27,376
I think anyone can do a good job...

1300
01:15:27,377 --> 01:15:29,317
in the killing part.

1301
01:15:30,147 --> 01:15:31,847
I'm giving up. I don't know.

1302
01:15:33,787 --> 01:15:37,717
But in terms of rap,

1303
01:15:38,987 --> 01:15:41,856
I think it's true that Zhang Jia Hao sounds good...

1304
01:15:41,857 --> 01:15:43,997
in the current situation.

1305
01:15:44,157 --> 01:15:46,726
But since the killing part rap isn't a rap...

1306
01:15:46,727 --> 01:15:48,296
that's extremely difficult,

1307
01:15:48,297 --> 01:15:51,437
I think it can be improved with practice.

1308
01:15:52,307 --> 01:15:53,706
So, I don't know either.

1309
01:15:53,707 --> 01:15:55,207
(The conclusion)

1310
01:15:55,407 --> 01:15:57,606
I'll leave the decision up to Star Creators.

1311
01:15:57,607 --> 01:15:58,777
I don't know.

1312
01:15:58,947 --> 01:15:59,947
Both of you are good.

1313
01:15:59,948 --> 01:16:01,907
- Thank you. - Good job.

1314
01:16:02,117 --> 01:16:04,216
As this really is the last performance,

1315
01:16:04,217 --> 01:16:07,087
I want to do the killing part for real and not a candidate.

1316
01:16:07,547 --> 01:16:10,387
But Yumeki is good,

1317
01:16:10,617 --> 01:16:11,957
so I'm a bit worried.

1318
01:16:12,287 --> 01:16:13,767
(Planet Camp after the last training)

1319
01:16:14,457 --> 01:16:15,956
Even if Yumeki does the killing part,

1320
01:16:15,957 --> 01:16:17,826
I think he will be able to lead our team well.

1321
01:16:17,827 --> 01:16:18,867
Right.

1322
01:16:18,967 --> 01:16:21,007
But I think I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

1323
01:16:21,497 --> 01:16:22,766
It is up to the Star Creators.

1324
01:16:22,767 --> 01:16:23,967
I trust you, Star Creators.

1325
01:16:24,597 --> 01:16:27,237
If I do the killing part, I'll dance like my muscles will die out.

1326
01:16:27,267 --> 01:16:29,477
That's good.

1327
01:16:29,837 --> 01:16:32,037
I want to do the killing part just once.

1328
01:16:32,177 --> 01:16:33,876
I want to wear a different outfit.

1329
01:16:33,877 --> 01:16:35,647
- That's right. - I want to do it.

1330
01:16:35,747 --> 01:16:38,547
(After a long night passed for the two participants)

1331
01:16:39,387 --> 01:16:41,117
Finally, the nerve-racking moment.

1332
01:16:41,817 --> 01:16:42,887
I'm curious.

1333
01:16:43,017 --> 01:16:46,527
The final killing part for "Brat Attitude" is...

1334
01:16:47,557 --> 01:16:49,297
("Brat Attitude")

1335
01:16:49,597 --> 01:16:52,367
Let's be greedy for the final stage.

1336
01:16:52,767 --> 01:16:54,797
I really want the killing part.

1337
01:16:57,267 --> 01:16:59,367
The final killing part goes to...

1338
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:03,537
(It's...)

1339
01:17:05,777 --> 01:17:07,977
(Who finally got the killing part for "Brat Attitude?")

1340
01:17:46,247 --> 01:17:47,586
(The killing part for "Brat Attitude")

1341
01:17:47,587 --> 01:17:49,757
(Zhang Jia Hao)

1342
01:22:39,847 --> 01:22:41,676
(You can check out "Brat Attitude...")

1343
01:22:41,677 --> 01:22:43,516
(on various music platforms starting at midnight tonight.)

1344
01:22:43,517 --> 01:22:48,616
(Piglet Chung Sang Hyeon, let's debut.)

1345
01:22:48,617 --> 01:22:50,817
(You can do it.)

1346
01:22:55,227 --> 01:22:58,396
(Result of Final Killing Part Selection Evaluation)

1347
01:22:58,397 --> 01:23:02,597
(Zhang Jia Hao: 777,402 points, Yumeki: 291,607 points)

1348
01:23:04,337 --> 01:23:07,506
I enjoyed watching the performance by Team "Brat Attitude."

1349
01:23:07,507 --> 01:23:08,636
Wasn't it amazing?

1350
01:23:08,637 --> 01:23:10,076
- Yes. - Yes.

1351
01:23:10,077 --> 01:23:12,277
Yes, I also thought that it was amazing.

1352
01:23:12,777 --> 01:23:15,476
Selected by Star Creators,

1353
01:23:15,477 --> 01:23:17,377
the killing part for "Brat Attitude" went to...

1354
01:23:18,647 --> 01:23:20,547
Zhang Jia Hao.

1355
01:23:25,257 --> 01:23:27,386
He choreographed the dance for "Brat Attitude."

1356
01:23:27,387 --> 01:23:28,927
Master Back Koo Young.

1357
01:23:30,897 --> 01:23:33,927
Your choreography was spectacular.

1358
01:23:34,227 --> 01:23:36,666
Did the participants' last performance...

1359
01:23:36,667 --> 01:23:39,437
pay off your hard work on the choreography?

1360
01:23:40,307 --> 01:23:41,807
Hello, I'm Back Koo Young.

1361
01:23:42,507 --> 01:23:45,606
Their performance was so incredible...

1362
01:23:45,607 --> 01:23:48,046
that it was beyond my imagination.

1363
01:23:48,047 --> 01:23:49,207
Watching them...

1364
01:23:50,077 --> 01:23:51,346
made me sweat.

1365
01:23:51,347 --> 01:23:53,286
I could feel their passion.

1366
01:23:53,287 --> 01:23:55,086
I can imagine...

1367
01:23:55,087 --> 01:23:57,957
how hard they must have worked on it.

1368
01:23:58,417 --> 01:24:00,686
I'm so proud of them.

1369
01:24:00,687 --> 01:24:02,856
As artists,

1370
01:24:02,857 --> 01:24:06,127
their performance was touching.

1371
01:24:06,927 --> 01:24:10,167
I'd like to thank the participants very much.

1372
01:24:11,497 --> 01:24:13,207
All right, thank you.

1373
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:16,906
For his honest and straightforward feedback,

1374
01:24:16,907 --> 01:24:20,907
there's a master who gained empathy from Star Creators.

1375
01:24:21,147 --> 01:24:22,577
Is he here?

1376
01:24:23,277 --> 01:24:24,977
He seems to be doing very well.

1377
01:24:25,547 --> 01:24:27,946
- Master JUSTHIS? - Hello.

1378
01:24:27,947 --> 01:24:29,916
You look amazing today.

1379
01:24:29,917 --> 01:24:31,557
- Thank you. - Yes.

1380
01:24:32,187 --> 01:24:35,186
I'm getting more and more curious.

1381
01:24:35,187 --> 01:24:38,556
Personally, I can't wait to find out...

1382
01:24:38,557 --> 01:24:40,527
your thoughts.

1383
01:24:40,767 --> 01:24:42,287
What did you think of the performance?

1384
01:24:42,367 --> 01:24:45,597
The advice I gave them on how to rap wasn't shown...

1385
01:24:46,307 --> 01:24:48,606
on the screen, but I could tell that...

1386
01:24:48,607 --> 01:24:51,837
they took it seriously and worked hard on it.

1387
01:24:52,077 --> 01:24:55,506
Their rap was very stable during the performance.

1388
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:59,046
It was easy to believe that they debuted already.

1389
01:24:59,047 --> 01:25:01,786
I enjoyed watching them.

1390
01:25:01,787 --> 01:25:02,857
I really enjoyed it.

1391
01:25:04,417 --> 01:25:05,587
Thank you.

1392
01:25:05,957 --> 01:25:08,956
From Team "Brat Attitude,"

1393
01:25:08,957 --> 01:25:11,496
who will be selected...

1394
01:25:11,497 --> 01:25:14,897
as members of ALPHA DRIVE ONE and ALD1?

1395
01:25:17,437 --> 01:25:19,767
As the anticipation is increasing,

1396
01:25:20,067 --> 01:25:21,867
the final global voting is...

1397
01:25:21,967 --> 01:25:24,637
proceeding with a lot of interest.

1398
01:25:28,247 --> 01:25:30,717
Based on the global voting result so far,

1399
01:25:32,077 --> 01:25:35,586
we recorded approximately 2,300,000 votes.

1400
01:25:35,587 --> 01:25:36,886
(Lee Leo, Chung Sang Hyeon)

1401
01:25:36,887 --> 01:25:38,716
That's the record so far.

1402
01:25:38,717 --> 01:25:41,586
There isn't much time left before the deadline.

1403
01:25:41,587 --> 01:25:46,327
If you haven't voted yet, please hurry.

1404
01:25:49,897 --> 01:25:52,766
Following Team "Brat Attitude,"

1405
01:25:52,767 --> 01:25:56,507
another team is ready to perform and determine their destiny.

1406
01:25:58,707 --> 01:26:01,447
The second performance of Final Debut Battle.

1407
01:26:02,377 --> 01:26:04,377
This is "Never Been 2 Heaven."

1408
01:26:06,387 --> 01:26:07,816
(The final mission)

1409
01:26:07,817 --> 01:26:09,286
("Never Been 2 Heaven" performance is revealed.)

1410
01:26:09,287 --> 01:26:12,157
The two killing part candidates for "Never Been 2 Heaven."

1411
01:26:12,887 --> 01:26:14,026
Yoo Kang Min.

1412
01:26:14,027 --> 01:26:16,796
(An Xin)

1413
01:26:16,797 --> 01:26:17,897
Zhou An Xin.

1414
01:26:18,527 --> 01:26:22,997
Between the two, who finally got the killing part...

1415
01:26:24,237 --> 01:26:27,137
for "Never Been 2 Heaven?"

1416
01:26:30,977 --> 01:26:34,607
The second performance for Final Debut Battle.

1417
01:26:35,507 --> 01:26:36,817
"Never Been 2 Heaven."

1418
01:26:39,487 --> 01:26:41,717
It starts now.

1419
01:26:53,327 --> 01:26:55,247
It's been a long time since I've been to school.

1420
01:26:55,527 --> 01:26:57,536
(Kim Geon Woo walks around in front of the school.)

1421
01:26:57,537 --> 01:26:58,996
(Tonight, the final debut team of BOYS II PLANET will be born!)

1422
01:26:58,997 --> 01:27:00,007
He's out.

1423
01:27:00,567 --> 01:27:03,536
I'll surprise him. Kang Woo Jin!

1424
01:27:03,537 --> 01:27:04,783
(Team "Never Been 2 Heaven" 's youngest member, Kang Woo Jin)

1425
01:27:04,807 --> 01:27:07,007
Geon Woo! Why are you here?

1426
01:27:07,177 --> 01:27:08,907
We're here to pick you up.

1427
01:27:10,417 --> 01:27:13,047
- Are the members in there? - Yes. Let's go to heaven.

1428
01:27:13,317 --> 01:27:15,916
- Let's go! - Hey!

1429
01:27:15,917 --> 01:27:17,556
How did you all come this far?

1430
01:27:17,557 --> 01:27:18,886
We're going to heaven.

1431
01:27:18,887 --> 01:27:20,847
You'll be going to heaven in your school uniform.

1432
01:27:21,827 --> 01:27:23,426
We're in the middle of nature.

1433
01:27:23,427 --> 01:27:24,596
Let's go and get healed.

1434
01:27:24,597 --> 01:27:26,226
The air is so nice.

1435
01:27:26,227 --> 01:27:28,073
How long has it been since I've been on a picnic?

1436
01:27:28,097 --> 01:27:29,637
It feels like we're on a picnic.

1437
01:27:31,397 --> 01:27:32,536
(The wild weather welcomes Team "Never Been 2 Heaven.")

1438
01:27:32,537 --> 01:27:33,807
(Eyes shaking)

1439
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:37,376
- The sky must be excited too. - As soon as he said that.

1440
01:27:37,377 --> 01:27:39,576
It would've been great if the weather was clear.

1441
01:27:39,577 --> 01:27:41,407
We should start by having some free time.

1442
01:27:41,507 --> 01:27:43,516
Should we each enjoy heaven in our own ways?

1443
01:27:43,517 --> 01:27:44,517
- Shall we do that? - Okay.

1444
01:27:44,518 --> 01:27:46,216
(Enjoying a heavenly nap right away)

1445
01:27:46,217 --> 01:27:47,947
(Kim Geon Woo appears.)

1446
01:27:48,147 --> 01:27:50,317
(He doesn't miss out on this therapeutic moment!)

1447
01:27:50,887 --> 01:27:52,357
An Xin is sleeping well.

1448
01:27:54,657 --> 01:27:57,697
The title of the song is "Never Been 2 Heaven."

1449
01:27:58,027 --> 01:27:59,796
To understand the song better,

1450
01:27:59,797 --> 01:28:02,266
we all decided to look for each of our ideas of heaven.

1451
01:28:02,267 --> 01:28:04,037
We came out for that reason.

1452
01:28:04,967 --> 01:28:06,737
Why does this feel so nice?

1453
01:28:06,867 --> 01:28:08,067
It's so nice.

1454
01:28:08,167 --> 01:28:10,836
Have you each enjoyed your freedom?

1455
01:28:10,837 --> 01:28:11,837
- Yes. - Yes.

1456
01:28:11,838 --> 01:28:13,107
It was therapeutic.

1457
01:28:13,207 --> 01:28:14,406
Did it make you think of heaven?

1458
01:28:14,407 --> 01:28:16,007
- Yes. - It made me think of heaven.

1459
01:28:16,107 --> 01:28:18,176
- Why don't we do this then? - Yes?

1460
01:28:18,177 --> 01:28:19,447
We'll write short poems...

1461
01:28:19,547 --> 01:28:21,216
and draw pictures to express that feeling.

1462
01:28:21,217 --> 01:28:22,986
- Great. - That sounds good.

1463
01:28:22,987 --> 01:28:24,216
Have you heard of writing contests?

1464
01:28:24,217 --> 01:28:25,316
- Yes. - Yes.

1465
01:28:25,317 --> 01:28:26,863
(The writing contest is something new to Zhou An Xin.)

1466
01:28:26,887 --> 01:28:29,597
Poems are written during writing contests.

1467
01:28:29,797 --> 01:28:30,797
Poems?

1468
01:28:31,557 --> 01:28:33,366
You can write a poem. Do you know poems?

1469
01:28:33,367 --> 01:28:34,697
- I do. - Good.

1470
01:28:35,267 --> 01:28:36,747
Why are you being so impolite though?

1471
01:28:37,937 --> 01:28:40,106
(The teammates have gotten a lot closer.)

1472
01:28:40,107 --> 01:28:41,137
Let's start.

1473
01:28:41,237 --> 01:28:42,707
Let's begin drawing.

1474
01:28:43,207 --> 01:28:45,577
I never hesitate with these things.

1475
01:28:47,077 --> 01:28:48,376
Will you please hesitate?

1476
01:28:48,377 --> 01:28:49,407
(Laughing)

1477
01:28:52,277 --> 01:28:54,316
(The members write about heaven...)

1478
01:28:54,317 --> 01:28:56,356
(while listening to the sounds of nature.)

1479
01:28:56,357 --> 01:28:57,557
Everyone looks focused.

1480
01:28:58,017 --> 01:28:59,186
(Peeking)

1481
01:28:59,187 --> 01:29:00,527
Don't look at mine!

1482
01:29:00,627 --> 01:29:03,997
- What is that? - Heaven.

1483
01:29:04,327 --> 01:29:05,826
It's making me want to do well while I'm at it.

1484
01:29:05,827 --> 01:29:06,966
(What is their idea of heaven?)

1485
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:07,967
I want to do well.

1486
01:29:08,227 --> 01:29:10,137
- Is that Kang Min? - Yes.

1487
01:29:10,737 --> 01:29:11,836
What's wrong?

1488
01:29:11,837 --> 01:29:13,807
(What happened all of a sudden?)

1489
01:29:14,167 --> 01:29:15,307
(A grasshopper appears.)

1490
01:29:16,637 --> 01:29:17,637
What's wrong?

1491
01:29:18,877 --> 01:29:19,976
What's wrong?

1492
01:29:19,977 --> 01:29:22,776
(He trembles as he welcomes the unexpected guest.)

1493
01:29:22,777 --> 01:29:24,347
- What's wrong? - It's back there!

1494
01:29:25,517 --> 01:29:26,687
He must really hate it.

1495
01:29:29,817 --> 01:29:30,916
It's sitting there!

1496
01:29:30,917 --> 01:29:32,816
That was cool. The way it flew was really cool.

1497
01:29:32,817 --> 01:29:34,656
Let's reveal our work. Shall we start from the left?

1498
01:29:34,657 --> 01:29:35,726
- Sounds good. - Shall we?

1499
01:29:35,727 --> 01:29:37,397
I did my best to write a poem.

1500
01:29:38,197 --> 01:29:39,867
Here's what I wrote.

1501
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:42,303
- That's a nice drawing. - You drew the universe.

1502
01:29:42,327 --> 01:29:43,767
"Never Been 2 Heaven."

1503
01:29:44,167 --> 01:29:47,637
"I've never been to heaven, but I got to see soap bubbles."

1504
01:29:48,007 --> 01:29:51,737
"I've never been to heaven, but I got to see you take a nap."

1505
01:29:52,507 --> 01:29:54,406
"I've never been to heaven,"

1506
01:29:54,407 --> 01:29:56,393
"but with the sound of the guitar and singing around me,"

1507
01:29:56,417 --> 01:29:58,817
"heaven must definitely be nearby."

1508
01:29:59,577 --> 01:30:00,747
That was nice.

1509
01:30:00,847 --> 01:30:02,363
- That was great. - That was so beautiful.

1510
01:30:02,387 --> 01:30:05,116
Actually, I was right behind...

1511
01:30:05,117 --> 01:30:06,837
when you guys played with the soap bubbles.

1512
01:30:06,957 --> 01:30:08,456
It was such a beautiful sight.

1513
01:30:08,457 --> 01:30:10,927
It felt like the last moment of summer.

1514
01:30:11,527 --> 01:30:13,696
It felt like a moment that would linger for a long time.

1515
01:30:13,697 --> 01:30:15,796
- Right. - That was great.

1516
01:30:15,797 --> 01:30:16,836
Let's go, An Xin.

1517
01:30:16,837 --> 01:30:18,496
"People have come to the peaceful mountain..."

1518
01:30:18,497 --> 01:30:19,657
"that has embraced the rain."

1519
01:30:20,137 --> 01:30:21,436
"Mother Nature is felt..."

1520
01:30:21,437 --> 01:30:22,783
"while listening to the sound of rain outside."

1521
01:30:22,807 --> 01:30:25,437
"I am full of joy as we are together."

1522
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:28,147
"Our friendship deepens with the drowsy rain."

1523
01:30:29,007 --> 01:30:30,616
- That felt great. - I loved the vibes.

1524
01:30:30,617 --> 01:30:31,946
An Xin has the sensitivity.

1525
01:30:31,947 --> 01:30:34,307
An Xin has the sensitivity of an elementary school student.

1526
01:30:35,117 --> 01:30:36,117
Okay.

1527
01:30:36,118 --> 01:30:37,156
His drawing was drawn like an elementary school student.

1528
01:30:37,157 --> 01:30:38,216
An elementary school student.

1529
01:30:38,217 --> 01:30:40,026
- There's a key point. - A key point?

1530
01:30:40,027 --> 01:30:43,096
- The poem is really deep. - Right.

1531
01:30:43,097 --> 01:30:45,026
- But the drawing is really easy. - Of an elementary school student.

1532
01:30:45,027 --> 01:30:46,366
(There was such a deep meaning behind it.)

1533
01:30:46,367 --> 01:30:47,566
That was intended.

1534
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:49,736
- There's a balance. - The balance was kept.

1535
01:30:49,737 --> 01:30:51,236
Great.

1536
01:30:51,237 --> 01:30:52,237
That was emotional.

1537
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:53,483
(Leo, Geon Woo, Woo Jin, Sang Won, Kang Min)

1538
01:30:53,507 --> 01:30:54,936
Jun Min would've done a great job.

1539
01:30:54,937 --> 01:30:56,976
You must bear the weight of being the leader.

1540
01:30:56,977 --> 01:30:59,607
I heard that Jun Min writes poems regularly.

1541
01:30:59,947 --> 01:31:01,746
Jun Min writes lyrics all the time.

1542
01:31:01,747 --> 01:31:03,877
- Right. - I finished it in one line.

1543
01:31:04,647 --> 01:31:06,516
- That's even cooler. - It wasn't dragged on.

1544
01:31:06,517 --> 01:31:07,847
Let's see it. Okay.

1545
01:31:08,147 --> 01:31:09,956
(Wherever I go, that place becomes heaven.)

1546
01:31:09,957 --> 01:31:11,487
(Touched)

1547
01:31:12,957 --> 01:31:15,626
"Wherever I go, that place becomes heaven."

1548
01:31:15,627 --> 01:31:17,727
Vibes of a fourth-grader.

1549
01:31:18,257 --> 01:31:20,227
- What are those circles? - These?

1550
01:31:20,327 --> 01:31:22,297
- Eyes? - I made a mistake.

1551
01:31:24,797 --> 01:31:28,307
He made a mistake, but he evened it out with another one.

1552
01:31:29,167 --> 01:31:30,677
How did you know?

1553
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:33,307
(Kim Jun Min wrote something earlier.)

1554
01:31:34,047 --> 01:31:36,417
(He evened it out while scribbling out his mistake.)

1555
01:31:36,647 --> 01:31:39,417
Heaven isn't something special.

1556
01:31:39,677 --> 01:31:41,616
It can just be us sitting here chatting...

1557
01:31:41,617 --> 01:31:44,186
and reading out poems. Just doing those things gives us joy.

1558
01:31:44,187 --> 01:31:47,857
If we just show others the way we enjoy the performance,

1559
01:31:48,057 --> 01:31:52,027
I believe they will be able to feel that joyful energy.

1560
01:31:53,227 --> 01:31:54,526
That was nice.

1561
01:31:54,527 --> 01:31:55,673
That was an important thing to say.

1562
01:31:55,697 --> 01:31:58,296
Could we even have a campfire?

1563
01:31:58,297 --> 01:31:59,496
- We should! - That sounds great!

1564
01:31:59,497 --> 01:32:01,167
- Let's go! - Staring at the fire?

1565
01:32:03,107 --> 01:32:04,107
(They searched for their own heaven to deliver a good performance.)

1566
01:32:04,108 --> 01:32:05,277
One, two...

1567
01:32:10,117 --> 01:32:14,687
(They learned that joy was always with them.)

1568
01:32:15,417 --> 01:32:20,427
(The members prepare for the Final after spending a heavenly day.)

1569
01:32:21,457 --> 01:32:23,656
- They're here. - They're here.

1570
01:32:23,657 --> 01:32:24,926
(Training D-Day)

1571
01:32:24,927 --> 01:32:26,726
- This is the last session! - Right.

1572
01:32:26,727 --> 01:32:27,897
- Let's go! - Hello.

1573
01:32:28,967 --> 01:32:32,297
(Two participants especially seem to be nervous.)

1574
01:32:32,737 --> 01:32:34,736
(Leo and Sang Won...)

1575
01:32:34,737 --> 01:32:38,807
(have done a lot of intense concepts.)

1576
01:32:39,607 --> 01:32:41,476
(They kept feeling embarrassed with the unfamiliar concept...)

1577
01:32:41,477 --> 01:32:43,347
(during the interim check.)

1578
01:32:43,647 --> 01:32:46,887
The song still felt awkward and I had a lot in mind.

1579
01:32:46,987 --> 01:32:49,016
I found myself feeling awkward.

1580
01:32:49,017 --> 01:32:52,457
I'm worried if I can put on a good performance.

1581
01:32:53,127 --> 01:32:56,857
(Team "Never Been 2 Heaven" 's last training session starts.)

1582
01:33:02,627 --> 01:33:05,737
(Sang Won and Leo look awkward compared to the others.)

1583
01:33:15,547 --> 01:33:19,886
We keep expressing this song with the word "refreshing."

1584
01:33:19,887 --> 01:33:20,887
Right.

1585
01:33:20,888 --> 01:33:22,947
But I think differently.

1586
01:33:23,387 --> 01:33:24,387
Right.

1587
01:33:24,587 --> 01:33:26,557
This song feels sexy to me as well.

1588
01:33:26,757 --> 01:33:29,356
- Right. - "Refreshing" and "cute."

1589
01:33:29,357 --> 01:33:31,837
You will feel embarrassed if you get trapped with those words.

1590
01:33:31,927 --> 01:33:35,626
- Forget about that. Just be Leo. - Right.

1591
01:33:35,627 --> 01:33:37,936
Just be Geon Woo. Just be An Xin. Just be Jun Min.

1592
01:33:37,937 --> 01:33:39,936
You guys don't have to force out a smile.

1593
01:33:39,937 --> 01:33:40,937
- Right. - Right.

1594
01:33:40,938 --> 01:33:43,006
Just your hearts need to be expressed and felt.

1595
01:33:43,007 --> 01:33:44,406
You all don't have to force yourselves...

1596
01:33:44,407 --> 01:33:45,936
to come out with some sort of facial expression.

1597
01:33:45,937 --> 01:33:47,647
- Don't get stressed out by that. - Right.

1598
01:33:48,147 --> 01:33:50,746
He told me to be myself.

1599
01:33:50,747 --> 01:33:52,477
That helped me a lot.

1600
01:33:52,917 --> 01:33:54,416
I believe that forcing out a smile...

1601
01:33:54,417 --> 01:33:55,946
won't bring out 100 percent of the joy.

1602
01:33:55,947 --> 01:33:58,687
We just need to be ourselves...

1603
01:33:58,787 --> 01:34:00,927
when preparing for the performance.

1604
01:34:02,457 --> 01:34:03,996
- Hello. - Hello.

1605
01:34:03,997 --> 01:34:05,156
This is Team "Never Been 2 Heaven."

1606
01:34:05,157 --> 01:34:07,227
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1607
01:34:07,427 --> 01:34:10,337
(The day of recording for "Never Been 2 Heaven")

1608
01:34:10,597 --> 01:34:13,566
I'm a producer that goes by the name of Neckwav.

1609
01:34:13,567 --> 01:34:15,806
- It's a pleasure to work with you. - Hello.

1610
01:34:15,807 --> 01:34:18,106
He played Abby of Saja Boys.

1611
01:34:18,107 --> 01:34:19,336
We've met a member of the Saja Boys.

1612
01:34:19,337 --> 01:34:20,577
Right.

1613
01:34:20,977 --> 01:34:22,846
("Global Top, 'KPop Demon Hunters, ' Saja Boys' Abby, Neckwav")

1614
01:34:22,847 --> 01:34:25,477
(Singer-songwriter Neckwav with an unrivaled voice)

1615
01:34:25,977 --> 01:34:26,986
It's an honor.

1616
01:34:26,987 --> 01:34:30,286
I'm curious about what the main focus was...

1617
01:34:30,287 --> 01:34:31,916
when you recorded the guide.

1618
01:34:31,917 --> 01:34:34,626
This singing style paid homage to Michael Jackson.

1619
01:34:34,627 --> 01:34:37,127
That was why I enjoyed recording this.

1620
01:34:37,997 --> 01:34:39,426
I focused on the rhythm as well.

1621
01:34:39,427 --> 01:34:41,297
You all are very talented,

1622
01:34:41,397 --> 01:34:42,766
so I am excited for your work.

1623
01:34:42,767 --> 01:34:44,137
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1624
01:34:44,537 --> 01:34:46,396
Leo will go first.

1625
01:34:46,397 --> 01:34:49,437
(Lee Leo will go first with the recording.)

1626
01:34:51,107 --> 01:34:53,006
- That was tasty. - It sounded like the track.

1627
01:34:53,007 --> 01:34:54,977
- That was perfect. - Thank you.

1628
01:34:55,807 --> 01:35:01,087
(The recording goes smoothly.)

1629
01:35:01,187 --> 01:35:02,787
That was done so well.

1630
01:35:03,587 --> 01:35:06,457
(Kim Geon Woo's recording session comes next.)

1631
01:35:06,757 --> 01:35:09,886
- That was amazing. - Thank you.

1632
01:35:09,887 --> 01:35:11,227
That tickled my heart.

1633
01:35:12,057 --> 01:35:14,596
- Where? - Tickled your heart?

1634
01:35:14,597 --> 01:35:15,767
(What's wrong with them?)

1635
01:35:16,667 --> 01:35:19,167
(Kang Woo Jin is up next with his refreshing voice.)

1636
01:35:20,767 --> 01:35:23,807
(The older ones go wild.)

1637
01:35:24,177 --> 01:35:25,236
That will bring out cheers from the crowd.

1638
01:35:25,237 --> 01:35:26,706
He has such a great tone.

1639
01:35:26,707 --> 01:35:28,276
- Kang Min is next. - Yes! Let's go!

1640
01:35:28,277 --> 01:35:29,476
- Let's go, Kang Min! - Let's go!

1641
01:35:29,477 --> 01:35:30,576
- Show us! - Let's go!

1642
01:35:30,577 --> 01:35:32,847
Does he make you feel concerned, An Xin?

1643
01:35:33,047 --> 01:35:34,987
(Shaking)

1644
01:35:35,087 --> 01:35:37,156
Kang Min has the experience.

1645
01:35:37,157 --> 01:35:40,427
I felt nervous as he would've done a lot of recording.

1646
01:35:45,257 --> 01:35:47,166
You have a great voice.

1647
01:35:47,167 --> 01:35:49,166
It's a very clear voice.

1648
01:35:49,167 --> 01:35:50,167
Thank you!

1649
01:35:50,367 --> 01:35:51,837
It's a clear soup.

1650
01:35:52,837 --> 01:35:53,837
It sounds so neat.

1651
01:35:54,837 --> 01:35:55,906
- He did well. - Okay.

1652
01:35:55,907 --> 01:35:57,837
It's getting better as time goes by.

1653
01:35:59,177 --> 01:36:01,846
(Yoo Kang Min is done with his recording including the ending.)

1654
01:36:01,847 --> 01:36:02,876
That was refreshing.

1655
01:36:02,877 --> 01:36:05,247
The ending fairy is right here!

1656
01:36:06,377 --> 01:36:08,417
- Yes! - Yes!

1657
01:36:08,517 --> 01:36:10,456
- Come on, Kang! - Come on, Kang!

1658
01:36:10,457 --> 01:36:12,086
- Come on, Kang! - Let's go, An Xin!

1659
01:36:12,087 --> 01:36:13,586
I'm excited for An Xin the most.

1660
01:36:13,587 --> 01:36:15,157
He suits the song so well.

1661
01:36:15,357 --> 01:36:16,896
- What about me? - What?

1662
01:36:16,897 --> 01:36:19,026
- You've done enough. - You've done more than enough.

1663
01:36:19,027 --> 01:36:20,727
You were called the Ending Fairy.

1664
01:36:21,027 --> 01:36:24,136
Could we try recording the intro?

1665
01:36:24,137 --> 01:36:25,267
Got it.

1666
01:36:25,567 --> 01:36:27,487
I'm curious about how An Xin's intro will sound.

1667
01:36:29,467 --> 01:36:30,707
(Smile of an older member)

1668
01:36:33,677 --> 01:36:35,606
Your voice sounds so trendy.

1669
01:36:35,607 --> 01:36:37,247
It suits the killing part so well.

1670
01:36:38,977 --> 01:36:41,117
An Xin concerns me.

1671
01:36:45,287 --> 01:36:46,986
- He's good. - That was neat.

1672
01:36:46,987 --> 01:36:48,756
I don't think I need to hear more because that was so good.

1673
01:36:48,757 --> 01:36:50,327
- Well done. - He's great.

1674
01:36:50,727 --> 01:36:52,456
- An Xin is great. - He's good.

1675
01:36:52,457 --> 01:36:53,527
He did it in one take!

1676
01:36:53,697 --> 01:36:55,796
You two did so well.

1677
01:36:55,797 --> 01:36:58,196
Kang Min has a clear voice,

1678
01:36:58,197 --> 01:37:00,836
and Zhou An Xin has a very trendy voice.

1679
01:37:00,837 --> 01:37:02,867
Classic and trendy. Which one?

1680
01:37:03,477 --> 01:37:04,977
I can't make up my mind.

1681
01:37:08,007 --> 01:37:10,376
My ranking is gradually dropping.

1682
01:37:10,377 --> 01:37:12,617
I think this is my last chance.

1683
01:37:13,247 --> 01:37:14,886
I want to show people through the killing part.

1684
01:37:14,887 --> 01:37:17,217
I want to show them why I have to be in the debut group.

1685
01:37:18,187 --> 01:37:20,426
This song suits me well,

1686
01:37:20,427 --> 01:37:23,287
so I think I can do it better than Kang Min.

1687
01:37:23,427 --> 01:37:25,827
I have to show everything I'm capable of.

1688
01:37:27,697 --> 01:37:29,166
I want to win against Zhou An Xin.

1689
01:37:29,167 --> 01:37:31,237
I want to get the killing part.

1690
01:37:31,537 --> 01:37:34,036
(Who will get the killing part of "Never Been 2 Heaven?")

1691
01:37:34,037 --> 01:37:36,607
(The final global voting will soon be closed.)

1692
01:38:32,527 --> 01:38:37,036
(The killing part of "Never Been 2 Heaven")

1693
01:38:37,037 --> 01:38:41,037
(Zhou An Xin)

1694
01:38:58,857 --> 01:39:02,227
(Zhou An Xin)

1695
01:42:56,027 --> 01:42:57,626
(You can check out "Never Been 2 Heaven...")

1696
01:42:57,627 --> 01:42:59,833
(on various music platforms starting at midnight tonight.)

1697
01:42:59,857 --> 01:43:05,197
(Zhou An Xin)

1698
01:43:09,107 --> 01:43:10,836
(Results of the evaluation for the killing part selection)

1699
01:43:10,837 --> 01:43:16,776
(Zhou An Xin: 725,397 points Yoo Kang Min: 511,208 points)

1700
01:43:16,777 --> 01:43:18,017
(Kang Min)

1701
01:43:20,217 --> 01:43:22,517
That was the performance by Team "Never Been 2 Heaven."

1702
01:43:23,517 --> 01:43:26,686
The killing part of Team "Never Been 2 Heaven..."

1703
01:43:26,687 --> 01:43:27,987
chosen by the Star Creators...

1704
01:43:28,687 --> 01:43:30,997
was Zhou An Xin.

1705
01:43:36,797 --> 01:43:39,837
- Master Hyolin. - Yes.

1706
01:43:39,967 --> 01:43:42,066
You've been a huge help in improving...

1707
01:43:42,067 --> 01:43:44,176
the participants' vocal skills.

1708
01:43:44,177 --> 01:43:46,907
How did you find the performance by Team "Never Been 2 Heaven?"

1709
01:43:47,207 --> 01:43:49,577
Hello. I'm Hyolin, the vocal master.

1710
01:43:50,917 --> 01:43:53,847
Honestly, I'm feeling overwhelmed with emotions right now.

1711
01:43:55,047 --> 01:43:57,486
It was great to see them showing a new side of themselves.

1712
01:43:57,487 --> 01:44:01,526
I also think the genre of this song...

1713
01:44:01,527 --> 01:44:03,926
places a very important emphasis on vocals.

1714
01:44:03,927 --> 01:44:06,156
So I think it created really exciting memories...

1715
01:44:06,157 --> 01:44:10,097
for everyone here, which I'm really happy about.

1716
01:44:10,297 --> 01:44:13,536
In terms of vocals, choreography, and overall,

1717
01:44:13,537 --> 01:44:17,107
they showed so much growth and improvement,

1718
01:44:17,677 --> 01:44:20,107
so I feel very proud, and I enjoyed watching it.

1719
01:44:22,307 --> 01:44:25,617
Right. We also can't forget to mention this person...

1720
01:44:25,977 --> 01:44:27,716
when it comes to improving the participants' skills.

1721
01:44:27,717 --> 01:44:30,757
- Master KINKY. What did you think? - Yes.

1722
01:44:30,917 --> 01:44:33,517
Hello. I'm KINKY, the dance master.

1723
01:44:34,727 --> 01:44:36,926
We were able to watch the performances...

1724
01:44:36,927 --> 01:44:39,796
during the interim checks and training up close,

1725
01:44:39,797 --> 01:44:42,496
but we couldn't see the final performances in person...

1726
01:44:42,497 --> 01:44:45,017
and had to watch them on screen, which was a bit disappointing.

1727
01:44:45,137 --> 01:44:48,036
But today's performance makes up...

1728
01:44:48,037 --> 01:44:50,167
for that disappointment 200 or even 300 percent.

1729
01:44:50,677 --> 01:44:54,606
The energy and vibe here are so strong...

1730
01:44:54,607 --> 01:44:55,876
that it makes me sad...

1731
01:44:55,877 --> 01:44:59,316
for not having watched the stages so far.

1732
01:44:59,317 --> 01:45:00,376
I enjoyed it so much.

1733
01:45:00,377 --> 01:45:05,557
I want to watch all the performances like this from now on.

1734
01:45:08,027 --> 01:45:09,127
Thank you.

1735
01:45:09,727 --> 01:45:11,597
The Final Debut Battle.

1736
01:45:12,257 --> 01:45:15,427
All the performances have ended.

1737
01:45:20,397 --> 01:45:24,677
The Top Eight of BOYS II PLANET,

1738
01:45:26,037 --> 01:45:29,876
the debut members of ALPHA DRIVE ONE,

1739
01:45:29,877 --> 01:45:32,716
ALD1 will be decided...

1740
01:45:32,717 --> 01:45:35,587
by the final global voting.

1741
01:45:38,387 --> 01:45:39,556
It's now time to wrap up the voting.

1742
01:45:39,557 --> 01:45:45,026
(The 2nd final global voting will soon close!)

1743
01:45:45,027 --> 01:45:50,526
(The 2nd final global voting will soon close!)

1744
01:45:50,527 --> 01:45:51,767
Who will be chosen tonight...

1745
01:45:51,997 --> 01:45:55,537
by Star Creators around the world...

1746
01:45:55,837 --> 01:46:00,507
to debut and make their dream come true?

1747
01:46:02,347 --> 01:46:05,777
As the world is watching,

1748
01:46:06,177 --> 01:46:08,246
we hope you'll stay with us until the moment...

1749
01:46:08,247 --> 01:46:11,417
the debut group is revealed here.

1750
01:46:15,487 --> 01:46:16,627
And now,

1751
01:46:17,457 --> 01:46:20,197
the final global voting...

1752
01:46:20,997 --> 01:46:23,197
for BOYS II PLANET...

1753
01:46:28,807 --> 01:46:30,007
is officially closed.

1754
01:46:46,817 --> 01:46:51,597
(The voting is closed.)

1755
01:46:54,597 --> 01:46:58,497
Thus, the final global voting has ended.

1756
01:47:01,067 --> 01:47:04,836
The love you've sent and each vote you've cast...

1757
01:47:04,837 --> 01:47:08,276
gave the participants a lot of strength.

1758
01:47:08,277 --> 01:47:09,607
I sincerely thank you.

1759
01:47:09,707 --> 01:47:11,646
Star Creators around the world...

1760
01:47:11,647 --> 01:47:15,816
who rooted for the participants with their precious votes,

1761
01:47:15,817 --> 01:47:19,416
thank you once again.

1762
01:47:19,417 --> 01:47:20,417
Thank you.

1763
01:47:28,597 --> 01:47:30,836
The Top Eight of the final debut team...

1764
01:47:30,837 --> 01:47:33,837
who got chosen by the Star Creators...

1765
01:47:34,467 --> 01:47:38,107
will begin anew as a team...

1766
01:47:38,207 --> 01:47:43,807
under the name of ALPHA DRIVE ONE or ALD1.

1767
01:47:48,917 --> 01:47:53,317
Now, who will become the top eight participants...

1768
01:47:53,657 --> 01:47:57,327
and join the debut team?

1769
01:48:00,967 --> 01:48:03,166
The results will be revealed now...

1770
01:48:03,167 --> 01:48:05,766
(Xin Long)

1771
01:48:05,767 --> 01:48:06,897
or not.

1772
01:48:14,147 --> 01:48:15,546
Before we do that,

1773
01:48:15,547 --> 01:48:18,047
the 16 participants...

1774
01:48:18,347 --> 01:48:20,747
prepared a special gift...

1775
01:48:21,147 --> 01:48:23,717
with their gratitude.

1776
01:48:24,057 --> 01:48:26,356
They also received...

1777
01:48:26,357 --> 01:48:29,627
a special gift themselves.

1778
01:48:35,167 --> 01:48:39,067
Who exchanged sincere gifts with the participants?

1779
01:48:39,567 --> 01:48:42,467
Let's check it out right now.

1780
01:48:48,077 --> 01:48:49,576
(Planet Camp)

1781
01:48:49,577 --> 01:48:51,317
- All right, everyone. - Yes.

1782
01:48:51,877 --> 01:48:53,017
What's in front of you?

1783
01:48:53,117 --> 01:48:55,786
Recipes for Chun Bae's snacks.

1784
01:48:55,787 --> 01:48:58,117
Now, you'll make snacks...

1785
01:48:58,287 --> 01:49:01,226
for Chun Bae, the dog that protects us.

1786
01:49:01,227 --> 01:49:02,227
(Snacks?)

1787
01:49:02,228 --> 01:49:04,927
(Puppuccino, fried tofu with rice, cake, cookie)

1788
01:49:05,357 --> 01:49:06,556
(They'll get divided into four teams...)

1789
01:49:06,557 --> 01:49:07,837
(and prepare Chun Bae's snacks.)

1790
01:49:07,897 --> 01:49:10,696
Which menu is the team at the very end making?

1791
01:49:10,697 --> 01:49:11,966
We're making kabocha cookies.

1792
01:49:11,967 --> 01:49:12,996
Kabocha cookies?

1793
01:49:12,997 --> 01:49:14,937
- Senior Kabocha. - Senior Kabocha.

1794
01:49:15,007 --> 01:49:16,607
Next comes Senior Spinach.

1795
01:49:17,137 --> 01:49:18,207
Excuse me.

1796
01:49:18,437 --> 01:49:20,607
The last one is Senior Beet. That's a nice name.

1797
01:49:21,277 --> 01:49:22,847
It feels strange.

1798
01:49:23,407 --> 01:49:24,446
It's fun.

1799
01:49:24,447 --> 01:49:26,047
(The tactile play excited Kim Geon Woo.)

1800
01:49:26,347 --> 01:49:27,947
- Scalpel. - Scalpel.

1801
01:49:28,747 --> 01:49:30,956
This surgery won't be easy.

1802
01:49:30,957 --> 01:49:34,757
This surgery involves transplanting foam to the puppuccino.

1803
01:49:34,957 --> 01:49:37,086
(They begin to make foam that'll go on top of the pet milk!)

1804
01:49:37,087 --> 01:49:38,957
(Whirring)

1805
01:49:39,727 --> 01:49:42,366
It's cold! Hey, it's cold!

1806
01:49:42,367 --> 01:49:43,687
(Milk is splattering everywhere.)

1807
01:49:44,197 --> 01:49:45,336
(The second victim is Kim Jun Min.)

1808
01:49:45,337 --> 01:49:47,167
- What are you doing? - It isn't easy.

1809
01:49:48,037 --> 01:49:50,407
- Okay. That's good. - I think it's coming along.

1810
01:49:50,667 --> 01:49:51,707
It's nice.

1811
01:49:52,007 --> 01:49:53,607
I'm excited already.

1812
01:49:55,777 --> 01:49:56,876
(Putting the remaining dough together)

1813
01:49:56,877 --> 01:49:58,317
What can we make with this?

1814
01:49:58,377 --> 01:49:59,976
Hey, give me an idea for what to make with this dough.

1815
01:49:59,977 --> 01:50:01,177
This dough? How about a heart?

1816
01:50:01,487 --> 01:50:02,487
A heart?

1817
01:50:02,488 --> 01:50:04,287
(Making a heart)

1818
01:50:04,687 --> 01:50:06,217
(Laughing)

1819
01:50:06,687 --> 01:50:07,787
It's a heart.

1820
01:50:11,257 --> 01:50:12,526
Is it a liver? It looks like a human heart.

1821
01:50:12,527 --> 01:50:13,797
A liver!

1822
01:50:14,027 --> 01:50:15,826
- It looks like a pair of lungs. - Oh, my.

1823
01:50:15,827 --> 01:50:18,797
- What's this? - It looks like a cow liver.

1824
01:50:18,967 --> 01:50:20,096
I hate it.

1825
01:50:20,097 --> 01:50:21,657
(Trying to make it look less realistic)

1826
01:50:22,037 --> 01:50:24,707
(What kind of a cookie will they get as a result?)

1827
01:50:25,037 --> 01:50:26,836
(The organ cookie is done.)

1828
01:50:26,837 --> 01:50:27,977
Shall I flip it over?

1829
01:50:28,277 --> 01:50:30,547
(He quickly flips over the cookie.)

1830
01:50:30,607 --> 01:50:32,117
(It's hot.)

1831
01:50:32,847 --> 01:50:34,447
It's like a heart from the netherworld.

1832
01:50:34,847 --> 01:50:36,047
- It's art. - Art.

1833
01:50:36,347 --> 01:50:38,086
It looks like assorted sashimi.

1834
01:50:38,087 --> 01:50:39,416
This is the shape.

1835
01:50:39,417 --> 01:50:40,486
(Team Fried Tofu with Rice minces the ingredients for the filling.)

1836
01:50:40,487 --> 01:50:41,557
I'm exhausted.

1837
01:50:42,657 --> 01:50:44,327
(Moving stealthily)

1838
01:50:44,957 --> 01:50:45,996
Crush it.

1839
01:50:45,997 --> 01:50:47,197
(Zhou An Xin joins Team Cake.)

1840
01:50:47,597 --> 01:50:48,997
You aren't in my team.

1841
01:50:49,327 --> 01:50:51,166
- Why do you keep coming here? - Hey.

1842
01:50:51,167 --> 01:50:52,367
Hey.

1843
01:50:52,637 --> 01:50:55,136
Why do you keep going to the other team? Come here.

1844
01:50:55,137 --> 01:50:56,567
(He goes over to them again.)

1845
01:50:57,737 --> 01:50:59,107
Hey, Zhou An Xin.

1846
01:50:59,207 --> 01:51:00,277
Watch.

1847
01:51:00,337 --> 01:51:01,677
Where is he? An Xin, come here.

1848
01:51:01,747 --> 01:51:03,807
- Zhou An Xin, what are you doing? - Zhou An Xin!

1849
01:51:04,747 --> 01:51:06,116
It doesn't go as I want.

1850
01:51:06,117 --> 01:51:07,623
(He consoles a member of another team.)

1851
01:51:07,647 --> 01:51:09,687
(He watches another team.)

1852
01:51:09,817 --> 01:51:12,687
(He volunteers at another team.)

1853
01:51:13,017 --> 01:51:14,387
All done.

1854
01:51:15,327 --> 01:51:16,556
Ta-da.

1855
01:51:16,557 --> 01:51:18,033
(Sweet fried tofu with rice for Chun Bae is complete.)

1856
01:51:18,057 --> 01:51:19,757
- Hey, this is it. - It worked.

1857
01:51:20,457 --> 01:51:21,596
The design is much better.

1858
01:51:21,597 --> 01:51:22,866
Let's spill it a bit...

1859
01:51:22,867 --> 01:51:24,296
- to give it the Hongdae vibe. - That's right.

1860
01:51:24,297 --> 01:51:26,067
- Okay. - Let's give it the Yeonnam vibe.

1861
01:51:26,797 --> 01:51:28,397
- It's a very messy presentation. - Yes.

1862
01:51:28,967 --> 01:51:31,107
A messy presentation? Doesn't it just look dirty?

1863
01:51:31,137 --> 01:51:32,807
- All done. - All done.

1864
01:51:33,707 --> 01:51:35,006
Don't touch it.

1865
01:51:35,007 --> 01:51:37,447
(The puppuccino with the Gen Z vibe is complete.)

1866
01:51:37,577 --> 01:51:39,677
(Why is Lee Leo deep in thought?)

1867
01:51:40,317 --> 01:51:41,387
It's coming along.

1868
01:51:42,517 --> 01:51:43,546
There you go.

1869
01:51:43,547 --> 01:51:45,217
There you go. Let's wrap it up.

1870
01:51:46,087 --> 01:51:47,257
Let's put it on a plate.

1871
01:51:47,587 --> 01:51:48,887
Leo is in a hurry.

1872
01:51:49,187 --> 01:51:50,686
Of course, I am.

1873
01:51:50,687 --> 01:51:52,047
Will you finish the cake tomorrow?

1874
01:51:52,997 --> 01:51:55,097
This is nice. I like it.

1875
01:51:55,197 --> 01:51:57,267
(A set of 4 snacks for Chun Bae)

1876
01:51:57,567 --> 01:51:59,737
(What remains is Chun Bae's choice!)

1877
01:52:00,337 --> 01:52:01,367
Please.

1878
01:52:03,007 --> 01:52:05,137
- There you go. - There he goes.

1879
01:52:05,377 --> 01:52:06,377
Come here.

1880
01:52:06,837 --> 01:52:07,847
Chun Bae.

1881
01:52:08,277 --> 01:52:09,677
(Fried tofu with rice for Chun Bae)

1882
01:52:09,707 --> 01:52:11,017
(Puppuccino for Chun Bae)

1883
01:52:11,347 --> 01:52:12,476
(Chun Bae heads straight to somewhere.)

1884
01:52:12,477 --> 01:52:13,946
- Chun Bae. - Here.

1885
01:52:13,947 --> 01:52:15,987
(Which snack will Chun Bae pick?)

1886
01:52:18,517 --> 01:52:19,617
Espresso?

1887
01:52:19,987 --> 01:52:21,087
Espresso?

1888
01:52:22,027 --> 01:52:23,456
No.

1889
01:52:23,457 --> 01:52:24,897
It doesn't smell good, right?

1890
01:52:25,027 --> 01:52:26,357
Eat.

1891
01:52:26,627 --> 01:52:28,766
It went there because the smell was shocking.

1892
01:52:28,767 --> 01:52:30,367
- That's right. - You're thirsty, right?

1893
01:52:30,897 --> 01:52:32,297
(No, don't eat it!)

1894
01:52:32,737 --> 01:52:33,767
Will it eat it?

1895
01:52:36,207 --> 01:52:39,037
(Chun Bae picks puppuccino!)

1896
01:52:39,277 --> 01:52:40,436
(Cheering)

1897
01:52:40,437 --> 01:52:42,377
- It's eating with gusto. - Oh, no.

1898
01:52:42,507 --> 01:52:44,317
- All right. - It's drinking it up.

1899
01:52:44,677 --> 01:52:46,317
It must've been thirsty.

1900
01:52:46,477 --> 01:52:47,747
It's drinking it up.

1901
01:52:47,987 --> 01:52:50,246
- Thank you. - Thank you, Planet Guard.

1902
01:52:50,247 --> 01:52:51,616
(I enjoyed the snack!)

1903
01:52:51,617 --> 01:52:53,457
(There are traces of puppuccino on its mouth.)

1904
01:52:55,027 --> 01:52:58,757
(For the past 5 months, it stayed by the participants' side.)

1905
01:52:59,257 --> 01:53:04,397
(Planet Guard Chun Bae)

1906
01:53:05,297 --> 01:53:08,967
(Thank you for your hard work, Chun Bae.)

1907
01:53:10,607 --> 01:53:13,806
Let's begin the peer review for the final.

1908
01:53:13,807 --> 01:53:15,407
- Yes. - Yes.

1909
01:53:16,047 --> 01:53:18,347
It's the last peer review.

1910
01:53:19,877 --> 01:53:21,037
There aren't a lot of people.

1911
01:53:21,517 --> 01:53:23,587
For today's peer review,

1912
01:53:23,817 --> 01:53:25,357
you won't judge...

1913
01:53:25,587 --> 01:53:27,187
(We won't judge?)

1914
01:53:27,387 --> 01:53:28,986
your own performances.

1915
01:53:28,987 --> 01:53:30,857
- What? - Will we just watch?

1916
01:53:31,057 --> 01:53:32,057
What?

1917
01:53:32,057 --> 01:53:33,057
Then who will do it?

1918
01:53:33,058 --> 01:53:34,466
For the peer review,

1919
01:53:34,467 --> 01:53:35,767
special guests came.

1920
01:53:37,667 --> 01:53:38,796
Special guests?

1921
01:53:38,797 --> 01:53:39,797
Who are they?

1922
01:53:39,798 --> 01:53:42,067
Let's welcome the special guests.

1923
01:53:42,267 --> 01:53:43,866
- What? - Let's go inside!

1924
01:53:43,867 --> 01:53:45,977
(Who are the special guests who surprised everyone?)

1925
01:53:46,737 --> 01:53:47,777
Let's go inside!

1926
01:53:48,047 --> 01:53:49,976
(The special guests for the last peer review are...)

1927
01:53:49,977 --> 01:53:52,653
(the participants who went through the Planet Camp journey together.)

1928
01:53:52,677 --> 01:53:54,617
(Entering endlessly)

1929
01:53:55,917 --> 01:53:56,917
What's this?

1930
01:53:57,787 --> 01:53:59,017
How are there so many people?

1931
01:53:59,387 --> 01:54:00,417
Hey!

1932
01:54:01,227 --> 01:54:02,627
Look behind you.

1933
01:54:04,127 --> 01:54:06,357
- Jun-miney! - Thank you for coming.

1934
01:54:06,497 --> 01:54:07,556
When did you get here?

1935
01:54:07,557 --> 01:54:08,597
Just now.

1936
01:54:08,827 --> 01:54:10,427
- My goodness. - My goodness.

1937
01:54:10,967 --> 01:54:11,996
My goodness.

1938
01:54:11,997 --> 01:54:14,536
Seriously, I never imagined it.

1939
01:54:14,537 --> 01:54:15,607
Hey!

1940
01:54:17,107 --> 01:54:18,477
There you are.

1941
01:54:19,507 --> 01:54:22,676
Seeing them enter all at once was fascinating.

1942
01:54:22,677 --> 01:54:24,107
I was happy to see them.

1943
01:54:24,447 --> 01:54:25,917
I was very surprised.

1944
01:54:26,017 --> 01:54:27,847
I was a bit touched.

1945
01:54:28,347 --> 01:54:29,987
Although it was nice to see them,

1946
01:54:30,987 --> 01:54:32,956
I was like, "Do we need to show them the performances?"

1947
01:54:32,957 --> 01:54:34,357
Because of that thought...

1948
01:54:35,157 --> 01:54:38,296
To be honest, it was more nerve-racking...

1949
01:54:38,297 --> 01:54:40,457
than the previous peer reviews.

1950
01:54:40,597 --> 01:54:43,026
After all, they were the ones...

1951
01:54:43,027 --> 01:54:45,497
who knew about our skills.

1952
01:54:45,697 --> 01:54:49,167
We needed to do better than usual to receive compliments.

1953
01:54:49,507 --> 01:54:50,666
Could it be...

1954
01:54:50,667 --> 01:54:52,206
that it says, "The bottom participant?"

1955
01:54:52,207 --> 01:54:53,207
Could that be it?

1956
01:54:53,307 --> 01:54:54,907
This is driving me crazy.

1957
01:54:55,047 --> 01:54:56,447
There are too many Planet Masters.

1958
01:54:56,647 --> 01:54:58,547
This is more nerve-racking.

1959
01:54:59,947 --> 01:55:01,886
We'll say hello. Two, three.

1960
01:55:01,887 --> 01:55:03,187
- Hello. - Hello.

1961
01:55:03,247 --> 01:55:05,216
We're Team "Brat Attitude."

1962
01:55:05,217 --> 01:55:06,937
- We're in your care. - We're in your care.

1963
01:55:09,157 --> 01:55:11,157
- Okay. - Please take turns to say hello.

1964
01:55:11,957 --> 01:55:13,257
Why are you hosting?

1965
01:55:13,497 --> 01:55:14,897
- Please go ahead. - Hao.

1966
01:55:15,297 --> 01:55:16,597
- What? - Zhang Jia Hao.

1967
01:55:16,627 --> 01:55:18,337
Hello.

1968
01:55:19,997 --> 01:55:21,567
(I'm Zhang Jia Hao.)

1969
01:55:23,007 --> 01:55:24,406
There you go. That's it.

1970
01:55:24,407 --> 01:55:26,207
I feel like we've gone back to the past.

1971
01:55:26,307 --> 01:55:27,907
- Let's go. - Okay, let's do this.

1972
01:55:28,207 --> 01:55:30,076
- Let's go. - Gosh, this is...

1973
01:55:30,077 --> 01:55:31,546
- I have high expectations. - Good luck.

1974
01:55:31,547 --> 01:55:32,577
Let's go.

1975
01:55:42,287 --> 01:55:44,527
- They're good. - They're good.

1976
01:55:47,697 --> 01:55:49,927
Jia Hao is really good.

1977
01:55:50,167 --> 01:55:51,696
- He's really good. - He's really good.

1978
01:55:51,697 --> 01:55:55,137
(The participants judge the performance carefully.)

1979
01:55:55,637 --> 01:55:57,337
They're judging us for real.

1980
01:55:58,307 --> 01:55:59,837
They're judging us for real.

1981
01:55:59,877 --> 01:56:01,977
I raised the notes too much. I'm about to throw up.

1982
01:56:02,377 --> 01:56:04,657
It'll be upsetting to place last in the last peer review.

1983
01:56:06,317 --> 01:56:07,746
We'll say hello. Two, three.

1984
01:56:07,747 --> 01:56:09,016
- Hello. - Hello.

1985
01:56:09,017 --> 01:56:11,857
- We're Team "Never Been 2 Heaven." - We're Team "Never Been 2 Heaven."

1986
01:56:13,187 --> 01:56:15,503
Hello, I'm the man who is the definition of "Lucky MACHO."

1987
01:56:15,527 --> 01:56:16,726
I'm the leader, Kim Jun Min.

1988
01:56:16,727 --> 01:56:18,796
- I think he prepared that. - Seriously.

1989
01:56:18,797 --> 01:56:21,197
(He prepared his self-introduction.)

1990
01:56:23,927 --> 01:56:24,967
Let's go.

1991
01:56:25,167 --> 01:56:26,197
(Under a lot of pressure)

1992
01:56:26,367 --> 01:56:28,107
Sang Won, it's about time you do something.

1993
01:56:28,207 --> 01:56:31,206
Hello, I'm Lee Sang Won.

1994
01:56:31,207 --> 01:56:33,037
(Highly satisfied)

1995
01:56:34,337 --> 01:56:35,646
Okay. Let's do this, everyone.

1996
01:56:35,647 --> 01:56:36,847
We'll look forward to it.

1997
01:56:38,917 --> 01:56:41,017
We were a bit underprepared.

1998
01:56:41,177 --> 01:56:43,817
Performing before my friends...

1999
01:56:43,887 --> 01:56:45,287
made me very nervous.

2000
01:56:45,687 --> 01:56:48,887
(They finally show their performance of "Never Been 2 Heaven.")

2001
01:56:55,767 --> 01:56:56,827
That's nice.

2002
01:56:58,267 --> 01:56:59,297
Let's go.

2003
01:57:02,267 --> 01:57:03,836
(They mess up the formation.)

2004
01:57:03,837 --> 01:57:04,837
Hey!

2005
01:57:07,337 --> 01:57:08,546
What was up with the formation?

2006
01:57:08,547 --> 01:57:09,547
(Disappointed)

2007
01:57:09,547 --> 01:57:10,547
This isn't easy.

2008
01:57:10,548 --> 01:57:12,517
(They fill out the peer review sheets.)

2009
01:57:14,347 --> 01:57:15,417
We're ruined.

2010
01:57:15,987 --> 01:57:17,547
Let's practice hard today.

2011
01:57:20,057 --> 01:57:22,286
I felt bad for the participants...

2012
01:57:22,287 --> 01:57:23,686
who got eliminated.

2013
01:57:23,687 --> 01:57:26,797
"We're doing well here in your place."

2014
01:57:26,957 --> 01:57:30,066
I really wanted to show that.

2015
01:57:30,067 --> 01:57:34,197
Because I couldn't do that, my heart felt heavy.

2016
01:57:34,767 --> 01:57:37,606
To be honest, I'm guessing that I'll be named...

2017
01:57:37,607 --> 01:57:39,807
the bottom participant the most.

2018
01:57:40,577 --> 01:57:42,147
- Shall we begin? - Okay.

2019
01:57:42,947 --> 01:57:44,577
This is good.

2020
01:57:44,677 --> 01:57:45,677
(Good?)

2021
01:57:45,877 --> 01:57:47,377
There's no bottom participant.

2022
01:57:48,817 --> 01:57:50,516
The first-place participant is Jun Min.

2023
01:57:50,517 --> 01:57:52,486
"To be honest, I'm a fan. Heart."

2024
01:57:52,487 --> 01:57:54,157
- Who wrote that? - Rensho.

2025
01:57:55,187 --> 01:57:57,226
- There's no bottom participant? - No.

2026
01:57:57,227 --> 01:57:58,257
Next.

2027
01:57:59,027 --> 01:58:01,096
(At that moment, Jun Min spots something...)

2028
01:58:01,097 --> 01:58:03,927
(in the peer review sheet.)

2029
01:58:04,567 --> 01:58:05,597
What is it?

2030
01:58:06,367 --> 01:58:09,007
What? What's this?

2031
01:58:09,307 --> 01:58:11,107
(What is it?)

2032
01:58:11,337 --> 01:58:12,607
What is it so sudden?

2033
01:58:13,137 --> 01:58:15,417
There aren't the bottom and the first-place participants.

2034
01:58:15,907 --> 01:58:17,583
It says, "To the 16 participants we love."

2035
01:58:17,607 --> 01:58:19,777
They wrote a letter for us.

2036
01:58:20,647 --> 01:58:21,747
What?

2037
01:58:22,147 --> 01:58:24,086
They wrote a letter for us.

2038
01:58:24,087 --> 01:58:25,757
- A letter? - Yes.

2039
01:58:26,057 --> 01:58:27,557
Rensho.

2040
01:58:28,587 --> 01:58:30,526
"My idols who are incredibly cool,"

2041
01:58:30,527 --> 01:58:32,297
"I'm so happy to see you guys again."

2042
01:58:32,457 --> 01:58:36,066
"I'm so touched to see that you guys have become..."

2043
01:58:36,067 --> 01:58:38,137
"cooler and better compared to the beginning."

2044
01:58:38,667 --> 01:58:40,396
"I mean it when I say that I really want..."

2045
01:58:40,397 --> 01:58:42,337
"all 16 participants to debut as a team."

2046
01:58:42,537 --> 01:58:44,937
"Mnet, please let them debut as a 16-member team."

2047
01:58:46,307 --> 01:58:47,406
"Good luck."

2048
01:58:47,407 --> 01:58:49,776
"My beloved friends, let's debut."

2049
01:58:49,777 --> 01:58:51,416
(He left a heartfelt message of support instead of a review.)

2050
01:58:51,417 --> 01:58:52,677
It was from Rensho.

2051
01:58:53,647 --> 01:58:55,017
What? The page is full.

2052
01:58:55,617 --> 01:58:56,717
Li Zi Hao.

2053
01:58:57,347 --> 01:58:58,616
"It has been a while."

2054
01:58:58,617 --> 01:59:00,287
"Things weren't fun without me, right?"

2055
01:59:00,757 --> 01:59:02,387
"I missed you guys a lot."

2056
01:59:02,727 --> 01:59:03,986
"I know that all of you guys are talented."

2057
01:59:03,987 --> 01:59:05,396
"So, just perform as you have."

2058
01:59:05,397 --> 01:59:06,897
Please read this part.

2059
01:59:08,127 --> 01:59:09,867
- "He Xin Long." - Xin Long.

2060
01:59:10,797 --> 01:59:11,937
"Xin Long,"

2061
01:59:12,797 --> 01:59:14,036
"you know what?"

2062
01:59:14,037 --> 01:59:16,006
(Xin Long, you know what?)

2063
01:59:16,007 --> 01:59:17,367
"I hate you so much."

2064
01:59:17,507 --> 01:59:18,576
That came out of nowhere.

2065
01:59:18,577 --> 01:59:19,607
Seriously.

2066
01:59:19,807 --> 01:59:20,836
(Snorting)

2067
01:59:20,837 --> 01:59:21,977
Let's go.

2068
01:59:22,877 --> 01:59:24,877
"So, don't come back. Just debut in Korea."

2069
01:59:29,487 --> 01:59:31,787
- That's legendary. - That's how it should be.

2070
01:59:32,517 --> 01:59:33,916
He's so good-natured.

2071
01:59:33,917 --> 01:59:35,356
Had he said it in a regular occasion,

2072
01:59:35,357 --> 01:59:37,857
I would've found it cringe-worthy.

2073
01:59:38,797 --> 01:59:40,627
But it's really heartwarming now.

2074
01:59:41,157 --> 01:59:42,567
- I know. - It's so heartwarming.

2075
01:59:42,797 --> 01:59:45,157
"Sang Hyeon, you didn't disappoint. Well done, cuddly cat."

2076
01:59:45,367 --> 01:59:47,166
"Do well on the stage as you have just now."

2077
01:59:47,167 --> 01:59:49,367
"Don't feel pressured even when I'm not around."

2078
01:59:49,637 --> 01:59:51,407
"Yumeki, don't skip your meals."

2079
01:59:51,537 --> 01:59:53,636
"I'll root for you from a distance."

2080
01:59:53,637 --> 01:59:54,947
(From Hsu Ching Yu)

2081
01:59:55,547 --> 01:59:57,306
"I'll root for your future journey."

2082
01:59:57,307 --> 01:59:58,447
"Good luck until the end."

2083
01:59:59,747 --> 02:00:01,216
"Guys, this is Yang Star."

2084
02:00:01,217 --> 02:00:03,617
"Seeing you guys again almost brought tears to my eyes."

2085
02:00:04,087 --> 02:00:05,116
Hey, bro!

2086
02:00:05,117 --> 02:00:06,856
(The participants depended on each other...)

2087
02:00:06,857 --> 02:00:10,226
(as they shared their sorrows and joys.)

2088
02:00:10,227 --> 02:00:11,497
Well done.

2089
02:00:12,057 --> 02:00:13,326
"You guys must be exhausted."

2090
02:00:13,327 --> 02:00:15,127
"Seeing you guys fills my heart with pride."

2091
02:00:15,627 --> 02:00:17,126
"Remember these words when you're worn out."

2092
02:00:17,127 --> 02:00:18,967
"Life is all about confidence. Remember that."

2093
02:00:19,537 --> 02:00:20,697
How cool.

2094
02:00:20,797 --> 02:00:22,066
It was a bit touching.

2095
02:00:22,067 --> 02:00:24,407
Seriously. I was a bit moved.

2096
02:00:24,637 --> 02:00:25,806
Thank you.

2097
02:00:25,807 --> 02:00:28,076
"All 16 members, thank you for your hard work."

2098
02:00:28,077 --> 02:00:29,746
"I'm very disappointed that I can't perform with you guys,"

2099
02:00:29,747 --> 02:00:31,523
"but I really hope Jun Min and Lee Jeong will debut."

2100
02:00:31,547 --> 02:00:32,676
"Having prepared for the show with them from the start,"

2101
02:00:32,677 --> 02:00:35,016
"I know how much they've struggled."

2102
02:00:35,017 --> 02:00:37,786
"I pray that they'll work hard until the end and debut."

2103
02:00:37,787 --> 02:00:38,956
- It's Won Jun, right? - Yes.

2104
02:00:38,957 --> 02:00:40,186
(The youngest member of WHIB, Muhn Won Jun)

2105
02:00:40,187 --> 02:00:42,057
Come on. Don't do that.

2106
02:00:42,827 --> 02:00:44,287
Stop crying.

2107
02:00:45,327 --> 02:00:46,327
My goodness.

2108
02:00:51,897 --> 02:00:53,837
We debuted together once.

2109
02:00:54,397 --> 02:00:56,407
Although I entered the show with hopes to debut,

2110
02:00:57,737 --> 02:01:00,307
hearing him say, "Make sure you debut..."

2111
02:01:01,747 --> 02:01:05,176
(A former teammate he had debuted with...)

2112
02:01:05,177 --> 02:01:07,116
(told him, "Make sure you debut.")

2113
02:01:07,117 --> 02:01:09,046
- Please. - I let go of expectations.

2114
02:01:09,047 --> 02:01:10,887
You can do it. You never know.

2115
02:01:11,317 --> 02:01:14,586
I couldn't even fathom what he was feeling.

2116
02:01:14,587 --> 02:01:15,856
It was a bit...

2117
02:01:15,857 --> 02:01:18,497
(I couldn't even fathom what he was feeling.)

2118
02:01:19,027 --> 02:01:20,427
Seriously, I know what he means.

2119
02:01:20,857 --> 02:01:22,027
It's from Gye Hyeon.

2120
02:01:22,467 --> 02:01:23,767
"Read this first."

2121
02:01:23,897 --> 02:01:26,196
"It was a bit serious."

2122
02:01:26,197 --> 02:01:28,467
"Everyone did seriously well, so my heart is troubled."

2123
02:01:29,167 --> 02:01:31,536
"Your effort shone."

2124
02:01:31,537 --> 02:01:33,737
"At this point, you need support more than assessment."

2125
02:01:33,977 --> 02:01:35,546
"You're good, so have confidence."

2126
02:01:35,547 --> 02:01:37,267
"Do everything with confidence. Good luck."

2127
02:01:37,447 --> 02:01:38,546
There's a postscript.

2128
02:01:38,547 --> 02:01:40,017
"Leo, you're the most refreshing."

2129
02:01:44,417 --> 02:01:47,056
Leo felt really bad about making a mistake...

2130
02:01:47,057 --> 02:01:48,386
earlier.

2131
02:01:48,387 --> 02:01:49,686
Since we had met them after a long while,

2132
02:01:49,687 --> 02:01:51,457
he wanted to show them a cool performance.

2133
02:01:51,487 --> 02:01:53,896
The fact that it wasn't up to our standards...

2134
02:01:53,897 --> 02:01:55,127
weighed heavily on his heart.

2135
02:01:55,467 --> 02:01:56,627
That's right.

2136
02:01:57,097 --> 02:01:58,536
I know what you mean.

2137
02:01:58,537 --> 02:02:00,737
(Lee Leo felt bad about his mistake all along.)

2138
02:02:01,367 --> 02:02:03,807
It turns out that it was a letter, not a peer review sheet.

2139
02:02:04,307 --> 02:02:06,807
It made me break down.

2140
02:02:08,847 --> 02:02:10,347
"To the participants I love."

2141
02:02:10,577 --> 02:02:12,047
"Hello, I'm Hyun Jun."

2142
02:02:12,217 --> 02:02:13,876
"Seeing you guys and coming to the mission location..."

2143
02:02:13,877 --> 02:02:16,316
"for the first time in a long while made me remember..."

2144
02:02:16,317 --> 02:02:18,787
"the Signal Song Test, Round 1, and Round 2."

2145
02:02:19,787 --> 02:02:22,026
"I was very happy to share these precious memories..."

2146
02:02:22,027 --> 02:02:23,527
"and experiences with you guys."

2147
02:02:23,787 --> 02:02:26,356
"Thank you so much for giving me unforgettable memories..."

2148
02:02:26,357 --> 02:02:28,027
"during the passionate summer."

2149
02:02:28,227 --> 02:02:29,626
I hope everyone becomes successful.

2150
02:02:29,627 --> 02:02:32,027
"See you guys at the final. I'll look forward to the stage."

2151
02:02:33,037 --> 02:02:34,437
We struggled, but...

2152
02:02:37,467 --> 02:02:39,037
Why are you crying?

2153
02:02:39,407 --> 02:02:40,907
We struggled, but...

2154
02:02:41,877 --> 02:02:43,307
they struggled as well.

2155
02:02:44,047 --> 02:02:45,047
Okay.

2156
02:02:48,347 --> 02:02:49,987
Seeing them smile,

2157
02:02:51,317 --> 02:02:53,616
hug us, and play around...

2158
02:02:53,617 --> 02:02:54,617
made me feel...

2159
02:02:57,227 --> 02:02:58,496
sad.

2160
02:02:58,497 --> 02:02:59,557
In any case,

2161
02:03:00,597 --> 02:03:03,726
I have no other thoughts.

2162
02:03:03,727 --> 02:03:04,766
I just think...

2163
02:03:04,767 --> 02:03:05,936
(They know how desperate the fellow participants were.)

2164
02:03:05,937 --> 02:03:07,667
that I should do really well...

2165
02:03:09,967 --> 02:03:11,336
for their sake.

2166
02:03:11,337 --> 02:03:13,976
(The participants steel their hearts even more.)

2167
02:03:13,977 --> 02:03:15,476
Did you think that we had left?

2168
02:03:15,477 --> 02:03:16,746
- Did you think that we had left? - What?

2169
02:03:16,747 --> 02:03:18,076
- Let's go. - You thought that we had left,

2170
02:03:18,077 --> 02:03:19,176
but we're back.

2171
02:03:19,177 --> 02:03:21,317
- For goodness' sake. - Oh, my.

2172
02:03:21,847 --> 02:03:23,416
- For goodness' sake. - What's up?

2173
02:03:23,417 --> 02:03:24,716
(The ones who made them shed tears appear.)

2174
02:03:24,717 --> 02:03:26,186
What's up?

2175
02:03:26,187 --> 02:03:27,556
What? Why are you crying?

2176
02:03:27,557 --> 02:03:29,727
- What's going on? - Did you cry?

2177
02:03:29,957 --> 02:03:31,626
- Everyone cried. - They're crying.

2178
02:03:31,627 --> 02:03:32,656
Did you cry?

2179
02:03:32,657 --> 02:03:33,927
- Why? - What's so sad, guys?

2180
02:03:34,357 --> 02:03:35,596
- Did you cry? - Seriously.

2181
02:03:35,597 --> 02:03:37,026
- You cried too. - No.

2182
02:03:37,027 --> 02:03:39,036
- You cried too. - I didn't cry. I'm serious.

2183
02:03:39,037 --> 02:03:40,136
- I'm serious. - I'm sorry.

2184
02:03:40,137 --> 02:03:41,336
Why are you crying?

2185
02:03:41,337 --> 02:03:45,377
(Seeing their faces makes them tear up again.)

2186
02:03:45,877 --> 02:03:48,347
- These people are emotional. - Have things been tough?

2187
02:03:51,107 --> 02:03:52,816
Sang Won looks so ugly when he cries.

2188
02:03:52,817 --> 02:03:53,817
Really?

2189
02:03:53,818 --> 02:03:55,687
Lee Jeong, you look just as ugly.

2190
02:03:56,287 --> 02:03:58,657
You're in no position to say that.

2191
02:03:59,287 --> 02:04:01,986
Everyone except for Woo Jin and An Xin cried.

2192
02:04:01,987 --> 02:04:04,186
- Jun Min didn't cry. - Didn't Jun Min cry?

2193
02:04:04,187 --> 02:04:06,057
Jun Min, will you open a ramen place?

2194
02:04:06,897 --> 02:04:09,067
He has always worn that item.

2195
02:04:09,927 --> 02:04:11,736
- Let's smile. - Let's smile.

2196
02:04:11,737 --> 02:04:13,066
Everyone must be exhausted.

2197
02:04:13,067 --> 02:04:14,197
Why did you cry?

2198
02:04:14,797 --> 02:04:18,067
People we've struggled with...

2199
02:04:19,977 --> 02:04:22,476
- wrote us... - He's crying again.

2200
02:04:22,477 --> 02:04:23,947
- Don't cry! - Don't cry!

2201
02:04:24,107 --> 02:04:25,216
- Don't cry! - Seriously.

2202
02:04:25,217 --> 02:04:26,916
- Seriously. - Why are you crying again?

2203
02:04:26,917 --> 02:04:28,017
Why are you crying again?

2204
02:04:28,347 --> 02:04:30,317
It's really nice to see you guys again.

2205
02:04:30,947 --> 02:04:32,516
He's handsome when he cries.

2206
02:04:32,517 --> 02:04:33,756
He has always been handsome, but...

2207
02:04:33,757 --> 02:04:35,827
- Crying doesn't ruin his face. - He's handsome.

2208
02:04:37,127 --> 02:04:39,926
My first and last votes for the killing part...

2209
02:04:39,927 --> 02:04:42,427
went to An Xin,

2210
02:04:43,167 --> 02:04:44,627
so I hope he does well.

2211
02:04:45,197 --> 02:04:46,267
How nice.

2212
02:04:47,237 --> 02:04:48,336
How nice.

2213
02:04:48,337 --> 02:04:50,466
Two of my former teammates are going to the final,

2214
02:04:50,467 --> 02:04:52,007
so I'm very proud.

2215
02:04:52,477 --> 02:04:56,107
I hope they'll cheer up and do well until the end.

2216
02:04:56,747 --> 02:04:57,777
Good luck.

2217
02:04:59,417 --> 02:05:01,917
"I'll do everything I can until the very end."

2218
02:05:02,017 --> 02:05:04,516
That's my mindset.

2219
02:05:04,517 --> 02:05:07,617
More than anything, I want to debut.

2220
02:05:10,157 --> 02:05:11,586
(Guests visit the practice room...)

2221
02:05:11,587 --> 02:05:13,456
(of Team "Brat Attitude" as well.)

2222
02:05:13,457 --> 02:05:14,597
Seriously.

2223
02:05:15,167 --> 02:05:17,126
- What's this? - Everyone is here.

2224
02:05:17,127 --> 02:05:18,636
- Thank you. - Thank you for your hard work.

2225
02:05:18,637 --> 02:05:20,137
Seriously, thank you for coming.

2226
02:05:20,497 --> 02:05:21,867
I missed you.

2227
02:05:22,767 --> 02:05:23,866
Okay.

2228
02:05:23,867 --> 02:05:24,867
(Disappointed)

2229
02:05:24,868 --> 02:05:26,108
- Your reaction... - All right.

2230
02:05:26,677 --> 02:05:28,607
How are you so good at writing a letter?

2231
02:05:28,877 --> 02:05:30,877
Honestly, I've always hated you.

2232
02:05:31,207 --> 02:05:33,653
(He confesses that he has hated him while holding his hand tight.)

2233
02:05:33,677 --> 02:05:35,893
(Shaking hands with a colleague he hasn't met in a while)

2234
02:05:35,917 --> 02:05:37,417
(Kissing)

2235
02:05:38,187 --> 02:05:39,416
(He hates it.)

2236
02:05:39,417 --> 02:05:41,357
(His eyes shift.)

2237
02:05:44,657 --> 02:05:46,597
(Li Zi Hao, you're mine.)

2238
02:05:46,857 --> 02:05:49,226
- Debut. - You really need to debut.

2239
02:05:49,227 --> 02:05:50,426
Debut.

2240
02:05:50,427 --> 02:05:52,096
You need to debut no matter what.

2241
02:05:52,097 --> 02:05:53,467
You can debut, right?

2242
02:05:53,897 --> 02:05:55,167
I'll do my best.

2243
02:05:56,037 --> 02:05:58,876
I'll work hard for the perfect ending.

2244
02:05:58,877 --> 02:06:02,906
I'll do you guys' share during the final performance...

2245
02:06:02,907 --> 02:06:05,616
and show the Star Creators around the world.

2246
02:06:05,617 --> 02:06:07,547
- Don't come back to the company. - Okay.

2247
02:06:08,917 --> 02:06:10,816
I'll be sure to pass the last step...

2248
02:06:10,817 --> 02:06:12,887
that's a debut.

2249
02:06:13,557 --> 02:06:16,086
I've worked so hard to get here.

2250
02:06:16,087 --> 02:06:18,727
To wrap things up perfectly,

2251
02:06:18,927 --> 02:06:20,297
I'll do my best.

2252
02:06:20,557 --> 02:06:22,366
Thank you so much for coming today.

2253
02:06:22,367 --> 02:06:24,126
We'll prepare for the performance in good spirits.

2254
02:06:24,127 --> 02:06:25,666
Let's go! One, two, three!

2255
02:06:25,667 --> 02:06:27,766
- Let's fight on! - Let's fight on!

2256
02:06:27,767 --> 02:06:28,806
Let's go!

2257
02:06:28,807 --> 02:06:30,436
- Let's go, guys! - Let's go!

2258
02:06:30,437 --> 02:06:31,467
Let's go!

2259
02:09:41,557 --> 02:09:42,597
Thank you.

2260
02:09:49,067 --> 02:09:51,967
Chung Sang Hyeon!

2261
02:09:52,537 --> 02:09:53,877
Chung Sang Hyeon!

2262
02:09:55,647 --> 02:09:58,606
(You can check out "How to Fly" on various music platforms...)

2263
02:09:58,607 --> 02:10:00,147
(starting at midnight tonight.)

2264
02:10:14,497 --> 02:10:15,527
Jun Min!

2265
02:10:16,027 --> 02:10:17,926
- Kim Jun Seo! - Hey.

2266
02:10:17,927 --> 02:10:19,467
Kim Jun Seo, you're so hot!

2267
02:10:22,607 --> 02:10:24,137
Kim Jun Seo, you have to debut!

2268
02:10:31,577 --> 02:10:32,677
Don't be scared!

2269
02:10:32,817 --> 02:10:36,386
(Chung Sang Hyeon)

2270
02:10:36,387 --> 02:10:37,916
(Geon Woo, I hope to see you for a long time!)

2271
02:10:37,917 --> 02:10:40,086
(Dong Gyu, you're at the end of the tunnel!)

2272
02:10:40,087 --> 02:10:41,986
(Leo, please come here.)

2273
02:10:41,987 --> 02:10:43,127
(Kim Jun Seo, be mine.)

2274
02:10:45,827 --> 02:10:48,626
They sang this heartfelt song...

2275
02:10:48,627 --> 02:10:51,197
for the Star Creators with the determination...

2276
02:10:51,597 --> 02:10:53,967
to soar alongside their dream.

2277
02:10:54,567 --> 02:10:57,807
The six voices came together to complete "How to Fly."

2278
02:10:59,177 --> 02:11:04,447
I hope their sincere intentions touched your hearts.

2279
02:11:09,787 --> 02:11:13,056
Many of their fellow participants watched the performance...

2280
02:11:13,057 --> 02:11:16,527
and rooted for the six participants alongside the Star Creators...

2281
02:11:17,027 --> 02:11:19,827
in this very stadium.

2282
02:11:24,027 --> 02:11:25,667
Where are they?

2283
02:11:26,237 --> 02:11:28,137
- Li Zi Hao. - Yes.

2284
02:11:29,007 --> 02:11:30,837
- Hello. - Hello.

2285
02:11:31,237 --> 02:11:32,836
Their final performance is over,

2286
02:11:32,837 --> 02:11:34,406
and they are waiting for the results now.

2287
02:11:34,407 --> 02:11:37,706
If there's any message you want to pass onto them,

2288
02:11:37,707 --> 02:11:38,707
please share it now.

2289
02:11:40,517 --> 02:11:42,747
Everyone, good work.

2290
02:11:44,147 --> 02:11:47,517
I have no doubt that they are over the moon...

2291
02:11:48,257 --> 02:11:49,927
because they had this chance...

2292
02:11:50,427 --> 02:11:53,827
to perform in front of this many people.

2293
02:11:54,357 --> 02:11:57,427
Unfortunately, I wasn't given this chance.

2294
02:11:57,527 --> 02:12:00,797
But I'm incredibly happy that...

2295
02:12:00,997 --> 02:12:05,707
I was a part of this journey from start to finish.

2296
02:12:06,407 --> 02:12:08,907
For that, I consider myself very lucky.

2297
02:12:09,677 --> 02:12:13,476
My fellow participants worked really hard.

2298
02:12:13,477 --> 02:12:16,317
So I hope everyone can debut.

2299
02:12:16,747 --> 02:12:20,117
I truly hope everyone can be happy.

2300
02:12:23,627 --> 02:12:24,687
I see.

2301
02:12:26,297 --> 02:12:30,626
Whenever Li Zi Hao speaks, he always seems to know...

2302
02:12:30,627 --> 02:12:35,466
how to strike a chord with us. It's always thought-provoking.

2303
02:12:35,467 --> 02:12:38,037
He shares such wise sayings with us.

2304
02:12:38,637 --> 02:12:41,736
Thanks to his numerous wise sayings and memes,

2305
02:12:41,737 --> 02:12:44,376
his absence was never noticed even after he was eliminated.

2306
02:12:44,377 --> 02:12:46,047
He had such a big presence on the show.

2307
02:12:46,147 --> 02:12:50,187
I'd like to ask you if you prepared another wise saying.

2308
02:12:50,917 --> 02:12:52,417
Please share it with us now.

2309
02:12:53,887 --> 02:12:57,827
I believe life is a challenge without an end.

2310
02:12:58,627 --> 02:12:59,697
Okay.

2311
02:13:00,397 --> 02:13:04,397
And I hope everyone on our show...

2312
02:13:05,297 --> 02:13:08,067
keeps pursuing their dream.

2313
02:13:08,397 --> 02:13:12,067
We can't give up before our fans give up on us.

2314
02:13:12,307 --> 02:13:13,337
Let's go.

2315
02:13:17,907 --> 02:13:22,347
He shared another wise saying with us today as always.

2316
02:13:22,817 --> 02:13:25,247
Let's talk to the youngest participant on the show.

2317
02:13:26,287 --> 02:13:29,327
Na Yun Seo. Are you here?

2318
02:13:29,987 --> 02:13:31,527
- I'm right here. - Hello.

2319
02:13:31,657 --> 02:13:32,657
Hello.

2320
02:13:32,658 --> 02:13:33,756
It must have been a while...

2321
02:13:33,757 --> 02:13:34,856
since you met the other participants.

2322
02:13:34,857 --> 02:13:37,926
Is there a participant...

2323
02:13:37,927 --> 02:13:40,067
whom you missed the most? If so, who is it?

2324
02:13:44,837 --> 02:13:46,737
There are so many.

2325
02:13:47,177 --> 02:13:49,647
But the one that came to my mind first was...

2326
02:13:50,747 --> 02:13:51,847
Kang Min.

2327
02:13:52,947 --> 02:13:54,547
Kang Min?

2328
02:13:55,447 --> 02:13:59,256
I think I'm the closest to Kang Min.

2329
02:13:59,257 --> 02:14:01,256
(Kang Min, Li Yu)

2330
02:14:01,257 --> 02:14:04,887
He treated me more like his peer than anyone else.

2331
02:14:07,057 --> 02:14:08,097
So...

2332
02:14:09,567 --> 02:14:12,637
on the show, there was a time when things got hard for me.

2333
02:14:13,997 --> 02:14:15,437
But thanks to him,

2334
02:14:16,667 --> 02:14:19,037
I was able to find small pleasures.

2335
02:14:21,307 --> 02:14:25,277
Other than Kang Min, Dong Gyu comes to my mind too.

2336
02:14:26,047 --> 02:14:27,417
There's Jun Min too.

2337
02:14:27,977 --> 02:14:30,187
I can't forget about Sang Won and Leo.

2338
02:14:30,747 --> 02:14:32,047
There's Xin Long too.

2339
02:14:32,557 --> 02:14:35,457
I think I missed everyone.

2340
02:14:35,987 --> 02:14:39,227
Those whose names weren't called might be disappointed

2341
02:14:39,527 --> 02:14:42,797
Why don't you name all of them?

2342
02:14:43,567 --> 02:14:44,667
Well,

2343
02:14:46,067 --> 02:14:47,537
there are only a few left now.

2344
02:14:48,397 --> 02:14:49,507
Xin Long...

2345
02:14:50,507 --> 02:14:51,967
Zhang Jia Hao.

2346
02:14:52,637 --> 02:14:55,306
Right. Zhang Jia Hao. Kai Wen.

2347
02:14:55,307 --> 02:14:57,477
Lee Jeong. An Xin.

2348
02:14:58,577 --> 02:15:01,246
Sang Hyeon. Jun Seo.

2349
02:15:01,247 --> 02:15:03,247
Li Yu. Woo Jin.

2350
02:15:04,017 --> 02:15:05,187
Yumeki.

2351
02:15:06,687 --> 02:15:08,417
I already named Sang Hyeon.

2352
02:15:09,387 --> 02:15:10,487
Geon Woo.

2353
02:15:12,527 --> 02:15:14,556
Next, Li Zi Hao.

2354
02:15:14,557 --> 02:15:15,966
(Lee Jeong)

2355
02:15:15,967 --> 02:15:17,326
(Jia Hao)

2356
02:15:17,327 --> 02:15:18,327
Who else?

2357
02:15:18,328 --> 02:15:20,867
- Jae Joong is next. - Right, Jae Joong.

2358
02:15:22,467 --> 02:15:24,707
For some reason, I wanted him to say my name.

2359
02:15:25,367 --> 02:15:26,437
Thank you for that.

2360
02:15:26,607 --> 02:15:30,107
You watched the performances...

2361
02:15:30,447 --> 02:15:32,076
prepared by your beloved participants...

2362
02:15:32,077 --> 02:15:33,677
right in front of them.

2363
02:15:34,047 --> 02:15:37,646
"Brat Attitude" and "Never Been 2 Heaven."

2364
02:15:37,647 --> 02:15:41,357
Which performance did you prefer between the two?

2365
02:15:43,287 --> 02:15:44,357
I...

2366
02:15:45,857 --> 02:15:47,897
actually liked both performances.

2367
02:15:49,097 --> 02:15:51,527
The most memorable...

2368
02:15:52,737 --> 02:15:54,866
and touching performance today...

2369
02:15:54,867 --> 02:15:57,907
was their last performance, "How to Fly."

2370
02:16:00,277 --> 02:16:02,747
He didn't pick 1 of the 2 teams.

2371
02:16:03,047 --> 02:16:06,746
His favorite performance of tonight was the one where all of them...

2372
02:16:06,747 --> 02:16:08,377
came together as one.

2373
02:16:09,547 --> 02:16:11,887
I get the feeling you'll be liked by your colleagues.

2374
02:16:13,717 --> 02:16:14,757
You might be right.

2375
02:16:15,887 --> 02:16:20,397
I can definitely see the charm everyone is falling for in Yun Seo.

2376
02:16:21,427 --> 02:16:22,467
And...

2377
02:16:23,397 --> 02:16:26,067
next up is a star from Miryang.

2378
02:16:27,137 --> 02:16:28,567
It's Yang Heui Chan.

2379
02:16:29,567 --> 02:16:32,336
All right. It's great to see you after a long while.

2380
02:16:32,337 --> 02:16:34,507
- Hello. - Hello.

2381
02:16:34,777 --> 02:16:36,746
- It's nice to see you again. - Gosh.

2382
02:16:36,747 --> 02:16:38,147
Nice to see you again.

2383
02:16:38,407 --> 02:16:39,516
Okay.

2384
02:16:39,517 --> 02:16:42,177
Heui Chan was beloved by the participants.

2385
02:16:42,317 --> 02:16:44,747
Many participants relied on him too.

2386
02:16:45,417 --> 02:16:47,317
Hold on. Let me ask you a question.

2387
02:16:47,487 --> 02:16:49,456
- Heui Chan. - Yes.

2388
02:16:49,457 --> 02:16:51,257
- Hello. - What did you think about the show?

2389
02:16:51,527 --> 02:16:53,357
- Pardon? - Any thoughts on the performances?

2390
02:16:53,597 --> 02:16:58,167
The performance made me so happy as I watched.

2391
02:16:59,437 --> 02:17:02,667
I could tell they worked hard for it,

2392
02:17:02,837 --> 02:17:04,207
so I felt proud,

2393
02:17:04,867 --> 02:17:06,037
and I almost teared up.

2394
02:17:07,337 --> 02:17:11,507
The younger participants really looked up to him.

2395
02:17:12,047 --> 02:17:13,946
I heard...

2396
02:17:13,947 --> 02:17:16,847
that you eagerly participated in the voting for them.

2397
02:17:17,487 --> 02:17:21,887
As one of the Star Creators, who did you vote for?

2398
02:17:22,587 --> 02:17:24,727
Isn't the voting supposed to be secret?

2399
02:17:25,857 --> 02:17:27,527
It's secret voting?

2400
02:17:28,327 --> 02:17:31,666
This time...

2401
02:17:31,667 --> 02:17:35,167
Well, I love all 16 members,

2402
02:17:35,867 --> 02:17:39,477
so I utilized all my unused phones and friends...

2403
02:17:39,607 --> 02:17:41,407
to vote for all 16 of them.

2404
02:17:43,607 --> 02:17:46,476
So, you've voted for all 16 of them until now.

2405
02:17:46,477 --> 02:17:47,546
Yes.

2406
02:17:47,547 --> 02:17:49,747
Did you vote during this live broadcast?

2407
02:17:50,087 --> 02:17:51,287
I did.

2408
02:17:51,847 --> 02:17:53,057
Who did you vote for?

2409
02:17:54,057 --> 02:17:55,377
Isn't it supposed to be a secret?

2410
02:17:56,857 --> 02:17:58,886
- I'll tell you. - Yes.

2411
02:17:58,887 --> 02:18:02,727
When I was in the All Star Class, we relied on each other a lot.

2412
02:18:03,497 --> 02:18:05,936
I voted for the center of our signal song,

2413
02:18:05,937 --> 02:18:07,667
Geon Woo.

2414
02:18:09,307 --> 02:18:11,306
Although...

2415
02:18:11,307 --> 02:18:13,306
I'm not good enough yet,

2416
02:18:13,307 --> 02:18:17,277
but he relied on me while we were on the show.

2417
02:18:17,777 --> 02:18:19,616
But I couldn't do much to help him,

2418
02:18:19,617 --> 02:18:22,446
so I wanted to be of help tonight.

2419
02:18:22,447 --> 02:18:25,087
That's why I voted for him.

2420
02:18:27,157 --> 02:18:32,156
I can tell how deep your friendship is.

2421
02:18:32,157 --> 02:18:34,657
Though other members will be disappointed...

2422
02:18:34,927 --> 02:18:37,397
- You... - I love you, guys!

2423
02:18:38,467 --> 02:18:41,336
You voted for everyone...

2424
02:18:41,337 --> 02:18:44,636
and voted for one you were more attached to.

2425
02:18:44,637 --> 02:18:49,377
And next to him is Han Harry June.

2426
02:18:49,907 --> 02:18:50,907
Where are you?

2427
02:18:52,277 --> 02:18:54,077
Where? Oh, hi.

2428
02:18:54,347 --> 02:18:55,617
Hello.

2429
02:18:55,917 --> 02:18:56,946
It's nice to meet you.

2430
02:18:56,947 --> 02:18:59,986
Please say a word of support...

2431
02:18:59,987 --> 02:19:02,457
for the 16 members awaiting the announcement.

2432
02:19:02,927 --> 02:19:04,827
Well,

2433
02:19:06,057 --> 02:19:08,897
I was one of the participants,

2434
02:19:09,467 --> 02:19:11,927
and now that we're...

2435
02:19:13,897 --> 02:19:16,006
in different shoes,

2436
02:19:16,007 --> 02:19:18,006
it feels strange.

2437
02:19:18,007 --> 02:19:20,807
And I can't help but support them more.

2438
02:19:21,237 --> 02:19:25,607
Even though some of them won't make their debut here,

2439
02:19:26,777 --> 02:19:29,646
I'm sure they'll shine wherever they are.

2440
02:19:29,647 --> 02:19:33,357
So, I want them to know that they don't need to worry.

2441
02:19:34,957 --> 02:19:37,557
That was very thoughtful.

2442
02:19:38,687 --> 02:19:42,556
I'm sure the participants will be...

2443
02:19:42,557 --> 02:19:43,867
cheered up.

2444
02:19:44,167 --> 02:19:46,996
Next,

2445
02:19:46,997 --> 02:19:49,306
- Masato. - Hello.

2446
02:19:49,307 --> 02:19:51,467
- Where are you? Hi. - I'm really sorry.

2447
02:19:51,867 --> 02:19:55,906
I said hi before Heui Chan and Harry June.

2448
02:19:55,907 --> 02:19:56,977
I apologize.

2449
02:19:57,307 --> 02:19:59,106
- No need. - Sorry.

2450
02:19:59,107 --> 02:20:00,647
That was unnecessary.

2451
02:20:01,377 --> 02:20:04,917
They're waiting for the debut team announcement.

2452
02:20:05,147 --> 02:20:07,917
Please say a word of support.

2453
02:20:08,617 --> 02:20:11,787
Personally,

2454
02:20:15,227 --> 02:20:20,197
among those 16 participants, including Lee Jeong and Jun Seo,

2455
02:20:21,297 --> 02:20:24,937
I must thank all of them.

2456
02:20:25,637 --> 02:20:29,777
But I rooted for Jun Seo the most,

2457
02:20:30,077 --> 02:20:32,277
so I voted for him.

2458
02:20:35,177 --> 02:20:36,416
You also voted.

2459
02:20:36,417 --> 02:20:38,046
(Make the debut, Jun Seo.)

2460
02:20:38,047 --> 02:20:41,286
Of these 16 members,

2461
02:20:41,287 --> 02:20:44,727
some will have to say goodbye...

2462
02:20:45,157 --> 02:20:46,957
to the debut team members.

2463
02:20:47,397 --> 02:20:52,396
For the 16 participants who should be nervous,

2464
02:20:52,397 --> 02:20:54,467
please say a word of support.

2465
02:20:54,537 --> 02:20:59,837
Yes. If you've come this far,

2466
02:21:00,577 --> 02:21:03,107
it means you did well and you're confident.

2467
02:21:04,247 --> 02:21:07,217
There are only people that I admire.

2468
02:21:08,747 --> 02:21:11,416
Even when this show ends,

2469
02:21:11,417 --> 02:21:13,787
I wish you happiness.

2470
02:21:14,187 --> 02:21:16,327
And I hope it turns out well for you.

2471
02:21:16,787 --> 02:21:20,996
Good luck. I'll be cheering you on.

2472
02:21:20,997 --> 02:21:22,027
Bye!

2473
02:21:23,627 --> 02:21:24,727
Thank you.

2474
02:21:24,967 --> 02:21:27,736
I believe their sincere words of support...

2475
02:21:27,737 --> 02:21:33,137
will give the participants great strength.

2476
02:21:38,947 --> 02:21:42,446
The boys who spent every night chasing their dreams...

2477
02:21:42,447 --> 02:21:45,787
have reached the final night.

2478
02:21:49,757 --> 02:21:51,326
Last night,

2479
02:21:51,327 --> 02:21:54,327
the 16 members were 1 night away from their debut,

2480
02:21:54,727 --> 02:21:57,066
and they spent it meaningfully.

2481
02:21:57,067 --> 02:21:58,996
(Make your debut, Dong Gyu, Kang Min)

2482
02:21:58,997 --> 02:22:02,967
Their last night at the Planet Camp.

2483
02:22:07,337 --> 02:22:09,307
Here it is.

2484
02:22:17,217 --> 02:22:18,516
(Vote counting is in progress.)

2485
02:22:18,517 --> 02:22:19,816
(The final debut team will be revealed shortly.)

2486
02:22:19,817 --> 02:22:22,156
(All Star Camp)

2487
02:22:22,157 --> 02:22:27,427
(The participants pack their bags as it's their last day here.)

2488
02:22:29,057 --> 02:22:31,127
I never knew this day would come.

2489
02:22:31,697 --> 02:22:32,997
It's actually the end.

2490
02:22:34,197 --> 02:22:35,837
I can't believe tomorrow is our last day.

2491
02:22:36,267 --> 02:22:37,837
I feel strange.

2492
02:22:38,767 --> 02:22:40,607
I honestly can't believe it.

2493
02:22:41,607 --> 02:22:44,647
I hope tomorrow is my last day as a trainee.

2494
02:22:46,977 --> 02:22:49,017
(While they're packing their bags, )

2495
02:22:49,617 --> 02:22:51,586
(the door opens all of a sudden.)

2496
02:22:51,587 --> 02:22:52,787
Who is it?

2497
02:22:54,717 --> 02:22:56,427
- It's Chun Bae! - Chun Bae!

2498
02:22:56,557 --> 02:22:58,056
What's in your bag?

2499
02:22:58,057 --> 02:22:59,456
(The Planet Guard, Chun Bae, visited them on the last night.)

2500
02:22:59,457 --> 02:23:01,227
- Hey, Chun Bae. - What did you bring us?

2501
02:23:01,497 --> 02:23:03,067
Is it a parting gift?

2502
02:23:03,827 --> 02:23:06,637
They're a letter and some treats.

2503
02:23:09,197 --> 02:23:12,836
"You will spend your last night at the Planet Camp..."

2504
02:23:12,837 --> 02:23:15,077
"together. Woof."

2505
02:23:15,507 --> 02:23:16,777
How do we spend it together?

2506
02:23:17,077 --> 02:23:19,107
All 16 of us in 1 bed?

2507
02:23:19,747 --> 02:23:22,117
(So, we've prepared...)

2508
02:23:22,647 --> 02:23:26,217
(a bed where all 16 of them can share 1 last time.)

2509
02:23:26,457 --> 02:23:28,087
(Amazed)

2510
02:23:28,317 --> 02:23:29,527
Mine!

2511
02:23:30,457 --> 02:23:31,786
Let's go!

2512
02:23:31,787 --> 02:23:32,957
This is nice.

2513
02:23:33,427 --> 02:23:35,697
We're spending our last night together.

2514
02:23:36,297 --> 02:23:38,297
(There must be a pillow fight in this setup.)

2515
02:23:40,597 --> 02:23:42,907
(It gets violent.)

2516
02:23:43,067 --> 02:23:44,667
Wait, are we having a pillow fight?

2517
02:23:44,837 --> 02:23:46,606
(An Xin only attacks Lee Jeong.)

2518
02:23:46,607 --> 02:23:47,637
Wait!

2519
02:23:47,877 --> 02:23:49,107
Why...

2520
02:23:49,647 --> 02:23:52,127
You know what? I'm going to make an opening in the debut team.

2521
02:23:53,477 --> 02:23:55,877
(Eliminating competitors with a pillow fight)

2522
02:23:56,017 --> 02:23:57,687
I only have to take down eight.

2523
02:23:58,047 --> 02:23:59,146
Let's fight.

2524
02:23:59,147 --> 02:24:00,287
Break his legs!

2525
02:24:01,217 --> 02:24:02,587
- Calm down. - Okay.

2526
02:24:04,027 --> 02:24:05,886
Guys, it's our last night.

2527
02:24:05,887 --> 02:24:07,227
I honestly can't believe it.

2528
02:24:07,457 --> 02:24:09,196
Wait. Should we try that?

2529
02:24:09,197 --> 02:24:10,796
The person you wanted to be friends with.

2530
02:24:10,797 --> 02:24:11,927
I like that.

2531
02:24:12,067 --> 02:24:13,296
- Good idea. - One at a time.

2532
02:24:13,297 --> 02:24:14,666
Jun Min, who did you want to be friends with?

2533
02:24:14,667 --> 02:24:16,037
Be friends with?

2534
02:24:17,137 --> 02:24:19,067
This is tough.

2535
02:24:19,507 --> 02:24:22,577
At our first camp, it was Leo.

2536
02:24:22,607 --> 02:24:24,447
(Jun Min chooses Leo.)

2537
02:24:29,417 --> 02:24:32,817
(Leo is overly happy.)

2538
02:24:34,687 --> 02:24:38,126
(He's not attacking him. He's just happy.)

2539
02:24:38,127 --> 02:24:39,257
Stop.

2540
02:24:39,457 --> 02:24:40,827
Why is Leo so happy?

2541
02:24:40,927 --> 02:24:42,796
- He knows how to react. - Okay.

2542
02:24:42,797 --> 02:24:45,326
- Okay. What's the reason? - The reason?

2543
02:24:45,327 --> 02:24:47,896
To be straightforward, I liked his voice.

2544
02:24:47,897 --> 02:24:49,197
(Exclaiming)

2545
02:24:49,737 --> 02:24:53,977
(Jun Min fell for Leo's voice.)

2546
02:24:57,447 --> 02:24:59,677
I wanted to hear him sing next to him.

2547
02:25:01,517 --> 02:25:03,147
- I'm suddenly awake. - So am I.

2548
02:25:04,147 --> 02:25:05,317
It was An Xin for me.

2549
02:25:06,687 --> 02:25:08,816
(He can't hide his smile.)

2550
02:25:08,817 --> 02:25:10,327
- What... - What are you doing?

2551
02:25:10,527 --> 02:25:13,156
I took the killing part of "HOLA SOLAR,"

2552
02:25:13,157 --> 02:25:15,697
and An Xin took the killing part in PLANET C.

2553
02:25:15,797 --> 02:25:19,997
(Geon Woo sang the killing part of PLANET K's signal song.)

2554
02:25:20,467 --> 02:25:23,667
(An Xin sang the killing part of PLANET C's signal song.)

2555
02:25:23,867 --> 02:25:25,907
- Right. - Why are you getting up?

2556
02:25:26,137 --> 02:25:28,537
(An Xin reenacts the glory days.)

2557
02:25:32,677 --> 02:25:35,347
(Geon Woo reciprocates.)

2558
02:25:36,047 --> 02:25:38,646
(The killing part performers)

2559
02:25:38,647 --> 02:25:41,287
(The signal song in pajamas)

2560
02:25:41,487 --> 02:25:43,357
That was good, An Xin.

2561
02:25:43,457 --> 02:25:45,357
You're good.

2562
02:25:45,687 --> 02:25:46,957
He's saying, "I'm the center."

2563
02:25:48,157 --> 02:25:49,256
That was good.

2564
02:25:49,257 --> 02:25:50,266
What was the reason?

2565
02:25:50,267 --> 02:25:51,466
- Reason? - Yes.

2566
02:25:51,467 --> 02:25:54,166
We knew nothing about PLANET C at the time.

2567
02:25:54,167 --> 02:25:55,236
Right.

2568
02:25:55,237 --> 02:25:56,566
- Then, they told me... - We knew nothing.

2569
02:25:56,567 --> 02:25:58,106
That he was coming...

2570
02:25:58,107 --> 02:26:00,007
to film something together.

2571
02:26:00,077 --> 02:26:03,006
I was in a tough spot where I had to represent...

2572
02:26:03,007 --> 02:26:05,346
- Right. - PLANET K.

2573
02:26:05,347 --> 02:26:06,516
Even when I got makeup...

2574
02:26:06,517 --> 02:26:09,477
(I sang the killing part for PLANET K.)

2575
02:26:12,417 --> 02:26:16,487
(He seems resolute for some reason.)

2576
02:26:20,257 --> 02:26:21,327
You look cool, though.

2577
02:26:21,657 --> 02:26:25,297
We first met in a tense situation,

2578
02:26:25,767 --> 02:26:28,136
- and he turned out to be so cute. - Right.

2579
02:26:28,137 --> 02:26:30,806
He was talking to me in such a friendly way.

2580
02:26:30,807 --> 02:26:33,207
I found that cute, so I wanted to be friends.

2581
02:26:34,077 --> 02:26:35,507
Should we hear from An Xin now?

2582
02:26:35,937 --> 02:26:38,646
For me, it was Xin Long.

2583
02:26:38,647 --> 02:26:40,147
(Xin Long)

2584
02:26:40,647 --> 02:26:41,846
PLANET C to PLANET C!

2585
02:26:41,847 --> 02:26:43,686
It hasn't been that long since you two met.

2586
02:26:43,687 --> 02:26:44,787
- Right. - Right.

2587
02:26:45,947 --> 02:26:47,187
Hello.

2588
02:26:47,557 --> 02:26:51,127
(What was An Xin's first impression of Xin Long?)

2589
02:26:51,757 --> 02:26:53,896
When you first see him...

2590
02:26:53,897 --> 02:26:57,097
He was way too old.

2591
02:26:58,667 --> 02:27:01,736
(Laughing)

2592
02:27:01,737 --> 02:27:03,406
- Are you serious? - What's your problem?

2593
02:27:03,407 --> 02:27:04,706
This is funny.

2594
02:27:04,707 --> 02:27:07,907
Xin Long had already made...

2595
02:27:08,677 --> 02:27:10,107
- His debut. - his debut.

2596
02:27:10,547 --> 02:27:14,717
(Xin Long made his debut at the age of 13 in 2018.)

2597
02:27:14,977 --> 02:27:16,386
So, he must be older.

2598
02:27:16,387 --> 02:27:17,693
(He thought Xin Long would be old.)

2599
02:27:17,717 --> 02:27:20,717
He must have been born in 1998.

2600
02:27:21,057 --> 02:27:22,586
(That's 7 years older than he actually is.)

2601
02:27:22,587 --> 02:27:24,286
- Isn't that too old? - But...

2602
02:27:24,287 --> 02:27:26,626
But it's natural to think so because it's his eighth year.

2603
02:27:26,627 --> 02:27:28,496
He's that young when it's already his eighth year.

2604
02:27:28,497 --> 02:27:29,657
It's hard to believe.

2605
02:27:29,767 --> 02:27:32,596
But he's so kind.

2606
02:27:32,597 --> 02:27:34,167
- He is. - He's very kind.

2607
02:27:34,497 --> 02:27:35,696
- He's an angel. - Yes.

2608
02:27:35,697 --> 02:27:36,767
Now, Xin Long.

2609
02:27:37,107 --> 02:27:39,106
I'll pick Yumeki.

2610
02:27:39,107 --> 02:27:40,577
What? Seriously?

2611
02:27:40,677 --> 02:27:42,276
You have to give it to him.

2612
02:27:42,277 --> 02:27:43,806
I have a story about him.

2613
02:27:43,807 --> 02:27:46,616
He and Kai Wen can't really communicate, right?

2614
02:27:46,617 --> 02:27:49,277
And they chatted for two hours.

2615
02:27:49,377 --> 02:27:51,286
I've chatted with Kai Wen before,

2616
02:27:51,287 --> 02:27:52,946
and he's no joke.

2617
02:27:52,947 --> 02:27:56,356
We were roommates for the second mission.

2618
02:27:56,357 --> 02:27:57,727
I was exhausted, but...

2619
02:27:58,387 --> 02:27:59,856
Let's do it.

2620
02:27:59,857 --> 02:28:02,297
(Kai Wen started talking about the choreography.)

2621
02:28:02,627 --> 02:28:05,297
(And their conversation went on...)

2622
02:28:05,397 --> 02:28:08,967
(without realizing the passage of time.)

2623
02:28:10,367 --> 02:28:11,937
(The sun rose in no time.)

2624
02:28:13,407 --> 02:28:16,137
(Will they finally go to bed?)

2625
02:28:16,337 --> 02:28:19,407
(No, the chat went on after turning the light off.)

2626
02:28:20,177 --> 02:28:21,947
We became very close friends then.

2627
02:28:22,747 --> 02:28:24,387
So, that was...

2628
02:28:25,447 --> 02:28:27,916
Are you done talking about me?

2629
02:28:27,917 --> 02:28:31,326
- What? Oh, I'm sorry. - That's not what I mean.

2630
02:28:31,327 --> 02:28:33,557
(Yumeki is sorry, and Xin Long tells him it's okay.)

2631
02:28:33,727 --> 02:28:36,426
This always happens when two kind people talk.

2632
02:28:36,427 --> 02:28:38,327
(A battle of saying sorry)

2633
02:28:38,497 --> 02:28:41,537
(They're both going, "It's okay.")

2634
02:28:43,567 --> 02:28:45,507
- "Why?" - It always happens.

2635
02:28:46,737 --> 02:28:48,377
- Okay. - What's the reason?

2636
02:28:48,477 --> 02:28:50,346
Someone's feet smell, don't they?

2637
02:28:50,347 --> 02:28:52,106
- It's yours. - I washed my feet.

2638
02:28:52,107 --> 02:28:53,277
So did I.

2639
02:28:53,377 --> 02:28:54,916
- Smell them. - No, thanks.

2640
02:28:54,917 --> 02:28:56,647
Smell them. I washed them.

2641
02:28:56,747 --> 02:28:58,516
I believe you.

2642
02:28:58,517 --> 02:29:00,197
(Kang Min gets them checked by Lee Jeong.)

2643
02:29:00,317 --> 02:29:01,787
Smell them.

2644
02:29:02,357 --> 02:29:03,427
Darn it.

2645
02:29:04,287 --> 02:29:05,287
What?

2646
02:29:05,288 --> 02:29:07,727
What's the name of that fruit with a weird smell?

2647
02:29:07,827 --> 02:29:08,896
Durians.

2648
02:29:08,897 --> 02:29:13,096
It smells like he washed a durian really hard.

2649
02:29:13,097 --> 02:29:16,096
(Laughing)

2650
02:29:16,097 --> 02:29:18,437
You get what I mean, right?

2651
02:29:18,537 --> 02:29:21,907
- Gosh. - This isn't going to work.

2652
02:29:22,177 --> 02:29:23,646
Lee Jeong's got jokes.

2653
02:29:23,647 --> 02:29:24,927
(We're ventilating for a while.)

2654
02:29:25,277 --> 02:29:26,347
I...

2655
02:29:26,617 --> 02:29:29,277
(Who did Sang Won want to be friends with?)

2656
02:29:29,677 --> 02:29:31,017
It was Lee Jeong for me.

2657
02:29:33,957 --> 02:29:34,987
(Hugging)

2658
02:29:36,357 --> 02:29:37,887
(Screaming)

2659
02:29:39,087 --> 02:29:41,057
- Okay. - It was Lee Jeong?

2660
02:29:41,197 --> 02:29:43,096
- Yes. - Really?

2661
02:29:43,097 --> 02:29:44,327
Why do you sound disappointed?

2662
02:29:44,627 --> 02:29:47,067
No, I'm not.

2663
02:29:47,597 --> 02:29:50,866
Because... Maybe he said for the show,

2664
02:29:50,867 --> 02:29:52,867
- but he said I was pretty. - Right.

2665
02:29:53,037 --> 02:29:55,176
(When they first met in the 1st Class Placement Match)

2666
02:29:55,177 --> 02:29:56,337
Hello.

2667
02:29:56,647 --> 02:29:59,777
(He saw Sang Won on the stage...)

2668
02:29:59,877 --> 02:30:01,577
(and said he was his type.)

2669
02:30:02,047 --> 02:30:04,947
That made me go, "Who is this guy?"

2670
02:30:05,387 --> 02:30:07,817
I found out we were similar in age,

2671
02:30:08,157 --> 02:30:10,857
and I realized how sincere he was.

2672
02:30:11,227 --> 02:30:13,087
- He's hot. - Hot?

2673
02:30:13,197 --> 02:30:14,456
(Hot)

2674
02:30:14,457 --> 02:30:16,226
(Hot)

2675
02:30:16,227 --> 02:30:19,097
(My blazing youth)

2676
02:30:19,397 --> 02:30:21,467
Then, we got closer.

2677
02:30:21,567 --> 02:30:25,006
Now, we can't live without each other.

2678
02:30:25,007 --> 02:30:26,507
- Okay. - Okay.

2679
02:30:28,807 --> 02:30:32,977
I actually want to talk about Jun Seo.

2680
02:30:34,547 --> 02:30:38,887
I never knew who Jun Seo was at the time.

2681
02:30:38,987 --> 02:30:40,416
When they introduced him,

2682
02:30:40,417 --> 02:30:43,457
Kany mentioned "Secret Relationships."

2683
02:30:44,227 --> 02:30:45,563
(When they first met in the 1st Class Placement Match)

2684
02:30:45,587 --> 02:30:47,557
(Were you in a BL drama?)

2685
02:30:47,657 --> 02:30:49,427
(Yes, I was.)

2686
02:30:49,527 --> 02:30:50,527
(I saw it!)

2687
02:30:51,527 --> 02:30:52,527
(I saw it!)

2688
02:30:53,197 --> 02:30:57,137
(Kany recognized Jun Seo from his show.)

2689
02:30:57,737 --> 02:31:00,837
(Jun Seo even did improv.)

2690
02:31:01,237 --> 02:31:04,777
I thought, "So, he was on such shows."

2691
02:31:04,877 --> 02:31:06,406
Then, we became roommates.

2692
02:31:06,407 --> 02:31:08,076
I shared a room...

2693
02:31:08,077 --> 02:31:09,617
with Won, Hyeop, and Jun Seo.

2694
02:31:09,717 --> 02:31:12,416
We had to decide who would shower first...

2695
02:31:12,417 --> 02:31:13,756
as there were four people.

2696
02:31:13,757 --> 02:31:14,986
And he went,

2697
02:31:14,987 --> 02:31:17,257
"Should we all shower together when we're in a rush?"

2698
02:31:17,787 --> 02:31:18,857
That's what he said.

2699
02:31:19,387 --> 02:31:20,797
- Jun Seo did? - Yes.

2700
02:31:21,527 --> 02:31:22,796
Rock-paper-scissors for the shower.

2701
02:31:22,797 --> 02:31:24,027
Okay.

2702
02:31:24,127 --> 02:31:28,337
We should either shower in groups of two or...

2703
02:31:28,437 --> 02:31:30,906
I don't mind showering in groups of two.

2704
02:31:30,907 --> 02:31:33,777
- Me neither. - Groups of two? The shower?

2705
02:31:34,277 --> 02:31:37,547
(Are we on "Secret Relationships" now?)

2706
02:31:38,047 --> 02:31:39,147
That's what he said.

2707
02:31:39,607 --> 02:31:41,176
What are you talking about?

2708
02:31:41,177 --> 02:31:43,747
- Ever since then... - I get what you mean.

2709
02:31:44,217 --> 02:31:46,387
Pick someone else if that's your reason.

2710
02:31:47,757 --> 02:31:49,886
Here's what I liked about him.

2711
02:31:49,887 --> 02:31:51,957
I was having a mental breakdown.

2712
02:31:52,227 --> 02:31:53,827
I have a strong pride,

2713
02:31:53,927 --> 02:31:56,896
so it was tough for me when I became a Two Star.

2714
02:31:56,897 --> 02:31:59,497
Every night, he told me positive things.

2715
02:31:59,827 --> 02:32:03,137
He was probably the only one I could rely on.

2716
02:32:03,907 --> 02:32:07,377
The person I wanted to be friends with was Jia Hao.

2717
02:32:09,507 --> 02:32:11,947
We were different groups at first.

2718
02:32:12,047 --> 02:32:15,316
I didn't know much about PLANET C.

2719
02:32:15,317 --> 02:32:17,687
And in the first mission,

2720
02:32:17,787 --> 02:32:21,257
Jia Hao had a small part in "S-Class."

2721
02:32:21,357 --> 02:32:23,727
- Right? - "Kick it."

2722
02:32:23,927 --> 02:32:26,127
(What was Jia Hao's part in "S-Class?")

2723
02:32:28,927 --> 02:32:30,866
- "Kick it." - "Kick it."

2724
02:32:30,867 --> 02:32:33,366
I knew that Jun Min was good...

2725
02:32:33,367 --> 02:32:34,766
since he did the killing part,

2726
02:32:34,767 --> 02:32:36,297
and Jun Min said that...

2727
02:32:36,497 --> 02:32:39,567
Jia Hao on his team was really good.

2728
02:32:40,037 --> 02:32:41,536
Hao was pretty hot.

2729
02:32:41,537 --> 02:32:44,506
Every member of Team "S-Class" mentioned Jia Hao...

2730
02:32:44,507 --> 02:32:46,376
and said he was good.

2731
02:32:46,377 --> 02:32:49,046
Yes, I was wondering who he was since everyone talked about him.

2732
02:32:49,047 --> 02:32:51,487
Then, he performed "Tambourine" in the second mission, and...

2733
02:32:53,347 --> 02:32:57,987
(Jia Hao left a strong impression with "Tambourine.")

2734
02:32:58,327 --> 02:33:00,196
I realized why everyone's been talking about him.

2735
02:33:00,197 --> 02:33:02,196
Then, we were both on Team "Chains."

2736
02:33:02,197 --> 02:33:03,597
He killed that.

2737
02:33:03,697 --> 02:33:07,036
He moved like a snake.

2738
02:33:07,037 --> 02:33:08,566
Like this.

2739
02:33:08,567 --> 02:33:10,037
He was so cool.

2740
02:33:10,137 --> 02:33:12,867
He's someone that I aspire to be.

2741
02:33:13,107 --> 02:33:15,737
I wanted to be cool like him.

2742
02:33:15,837 --> 02:33:18,307
That's why I wanted to be friends with him,

2743
02:33:18,407 --> 02:33:21,177
and I'm glad we did by being on the same team.

2744
02:33:21,277 --> 02:33:22,916
Oh, right. "Brat Attitude."

2745
02:33:22,917 --> 02:33:25,787
- It's the perfect ending. - It really is.

2746
02:33:26,087 --> 02:33:28,086
(Who did Jia Hao want to be friends with?)

2747
02:33:28,087 --> 02:33:30,686
Before they combined PLANET K and PLANET C,

2748
02:33:30,687 --> 02:33:32,757
the visual posters were released.

2749
02:33:33,327 --> 02:33:34,397
I know that!

2750
02:33:34,497 --> 02:33:38,097
(The visual posters went viral before the show began.)

2751
02:33:38,427 --> 02:33:40,597
When the posters came out...

2752
02:33:41,397 --> 02:33:42,397
Me?

2753
02:33:42,398 --> 02:33:44,507
(Kang Min looks forward to it.)

2754
02:33:45,707 --> 02:33:48,306
Li Yu.

2755
02:33:48,307 --> 02:33:50,177
(Dispirited)

2756
02:33:50,347 --> 02:33:51,477
Stop!

2757
02:33:52,547 --> 02:33:56,177
It was Li Yu, who surpassed you.

2758
02:33:56,617 --> 02:33:57,917
I have the right to expect it.

2759
02:33:58,187 --> 02:34:00,757
- Anyway, Li Yu. - Yes.

2760
02:34:01,157 --> 02:34:03,727
So, I've been curious about him.

2761
02:34:04,327 --> 02:34:06,757
I wanted to be friends with everyone when I first came here.

2762
02:34:07,327 --> 02:34:09,657
But the first person that pops into my head is Sang Won.

2763
02:34:11,027 --> 02:34:15,037
On our first shoot, he was sitting next to me.

2764
02:34:15,167 --> 02:34:16,167
Right.

2765
02:34:16,168 --> 02:34:20,437
(The two were sitting side by side in the 1st Class Placement Match.)

2766
02:34:21,407 --> 02:34:23,446
Did we?

2767
02:34:23,447 --> 02:34:24,607
Come on, man.

2768
02:34:25,347 --> 02:34:26,347
(Criticizing him for the shocking remark)

2769
02:34:26,348 --> 02:34:28,146
No!

2770
02:34:28,147 --> 02:34:29,147
"Did we?"

2771
02:34:29,477 --> 02:34:31,787
I don't remember because he shined too brightly.

2772
02:34:31,887 --> 02:34:33,117
What nonsense.

2773
02:34:34,217 --> 02:34:35,757
Just move on!

2774
02:34:36,157 --> 02:34:39,457
So, on our first shoot, he sat next to me,

2775
02:34:39,557 --> 02:34:41,197
and he smelled really nice.

2776
02:34:42,157 --> 02:34:43,357
I agree, though.

2777
02:34:43,797 --> 02:34:46,866
I wanted to ask him what cologne he used.

2778
02:34:46,867 --> 02:34:47,996
Okay.

2779
02:34:47,997 --> 02:34:48,997
(I'll tell you later.)

2780
02:34:48,998 --> 02:34:50,066
(Is there a participant you still feel awkward around?)

2781
02:34:50,067 --> 02:34:51,237
I don't think so.

2782
02:34:51,567 --> 02:34:52,867
Among these guys...

2783
02:34:52,937 --> 02:34:55,737
(Sang Hyeon points at someone.)

2784
02:34:55,837 --> 02:34:57,546
- Do you have one, Sang Hyeon? - Yes.

2785
02:34:57,547 --> 02:34:58,607
What? You do?

2786
02:34:59,577 --> 02:35:00,577
Who?

2787
02:35:00,847 --> 02:35:03,277
Sang Won.

2788
02:35:03,547 --> 02:35:04,717
- What? - What?

2789
02:35:04,817 --> 02:35:06,186
No, you two talked.

2790
02:35:06,187 --> 02:35:07,457
We did,

2791
02:35:07,557 --> 02:35:12,127
but Sang Won is the one that I'm the least closest to.

2792
02:35:13,857 --> 02:35:15,097
Sit face-to-face, you two.

2793
02:35:15,197 --> 02:35:16,897
Make some room for them at the center.

2794
02:35:17,697 --> 02:35:20,767
All right. Hold hands.

2795
02:35:20,867 --> 02:35:22,296
That makes it awkward.

2796
02:35:22,297 --> 02:35:23,937
It makes it even more awkward.

2797
02:35:24,267 --> 02:35:25,736
- Let's do it. - That's his appeal.

2798
02:35:25,737 --> 02:35:27,236
(Awkwardly holding hands)

2799
02:35:27,237 --> 02:35:28,706
Questions for Sang Won.

2800
02:35:28,707 --> 02:35:32,007
Ask him things that you wanted to but couldn't as it was too awkward.

2801
02:35:32,447 --> 02:35:35,746
You're normally close with older members,

2802
02:35:35,747 --> 02:35:39,816
but you don't seem that close with younger members.

2803
02:35:39,817 --> 02:35:43,487
So, I wondered if you disliked younger members.

2804
02:35:44,127 --> 02:35:47,397
Not "dislike." Do you prefer them less?

2805
02:35:48,257 --> 02:35:49,626
So, he did perform hip-hop.

2806
02:35:49,627 --> 02:35:50,827
That's hip-hop.

2807
02:35:51,327 --> 02:35:53,266
That's not true at all.

2808
02:35:53,267 --> 02:35:55,066
(He speaks in the honorifics, which proves they're awkward.)

2809
02:35:55,067 --> 02:35:56,167
I'm shy.

2810
02:35:56,297 --> 02:35:58,236
- I'm so upset. - It's not true.

2811
02:35:58,237 --> 02:35:59,307
Okay.

2812
02:36:00,067 --> 02:36:04,507
But I do find younger members awkward.

2813
02:36:07,047 --> 02:36:08,917
He used the honorifics right away!

2814
02:36:09,017 --> 02:36:10,747
Did he just draw a line between you?

2815
02:36:10,847 --> 02:36:13,916
I'm awkward around younger people.

2816
02:36:13,917 --> 02:36:15,486
You don't know how to treat them.

2817
02:36:15,487 --> 02:36:16,586
Yes, I don't know how.

2818
02:36:16,587 --> 02:36:19,856
I've mostly been around older guys...

2819
02:36:19,857 --> 02:36:21,696
ever since I was little,

2820
02:36:21,697 --> 02:36:25,427
so I turn into a robot when I'm around younger guys.

2821
02:36:26,627 --> 02:36:29,236
So, if I approach you and talk to you,

2822
02:36:29,237 --> 02:36:31,037
- will you answer naturally? - Okay.

2823
02:36:31,137 --> 02:36:32,206
Great.

2824
02:36:32,207 --> 02:36:33,366
(The two become much closer.)

2825
02:36:33,367 --> 02:36:35,037
So wholesome!

2826
02:36:35,807 --> 02:36:37,006
Good night.

2827
02:36:37,007 --> 02:36:39,547
(Time to go to bed for tomorrow)

2828
02:36:41,647 --> 02:36:45,187
(But they can't seem to fall asleep.)

2829
02:36:45,617 --> 02:36:47,617
I still can't believe this is our last day.

2830
02:36:48,517 --> 02:36:50,327
I never knew we'd be such close friends...

2831
02:36:50,827 --> 02:36:52,127
when we first met.

2832
02:36:53,527 --> 02:36:56,997
Going through this journey together is so meaningful,

2833
02:36:57,997 --> 02:36:59,827
and it will become a great memory.

2834
02:37:00,837 --> 02:37:02,537
We'll find out the result tomorrow,

2835
02:37:03,137 --> 02:37:04,607
but let's root for each other.

2836
02:37:05,037 --> 02:37:06,107
Great.

2837
02:37:06,537 --> 02:37:08,076
- Good night, everyone. - Good night.

2838
02:37:08,077 --> 02:37:09,177
Good night!

2839
02:37:13,407 --> 02:37:19,546
(A total of 16 survivors have made it to the Finals...)

2840
02:37:19,547 --> 02:37:24,357
(after an intense competition.)

2841
02:37:25,127 --> 02:37:32,727
(Who will be the ones to make their debuts as the final Top 8?)

2842
02:37:37,067 --> 02:37:43,237
(It will be revealed now!)

2843
02:37:44,247 --> 02:37:46,677
Kim Jun Seo!

2844
02:37:54,717 --> 02:37:55,917
Let's go!

2845
02:38:02,757 --> 02:38:04,327
Make your debut today!

2846
02:38:14,937 --> 02:38:16,337
Right on this stage,

2847
02:38:16,537 --> 02:38:20,577
we can see the 16 boys...

2848
02:38:21,117 --> 02:38:24,087
selected by the Star Creators from around the world.

2849
02:38:25,847 --> 02:38:30,017
Out of these participants,

2850
02:38:30,657 --> 02:38:35,797
only eight of them will make their debuts as ALPHA DRIVE ONE,

2851
02:38:36,057 --> 02:38:38,467
ALD1.

2852
02:38:41,767 --> 02:38:44,707
While blazing up the most at the last moment,

2853
02:38:45,207 --> 02:38:49,077
which rising stars will make a new beginning...

2854
02:38:49,807 --> 02:38:53,817
as global idols?

2855
02:38:55,417 --> 02:38:59,317
The final Top Eight.

2856
02:39:00,557 --> 02:39:03,887
The announcement of the final debut team...

2857
02:39:10,127 --> 02:39:11,427
will begin now!

2858
02:39:41,997 --> 02:39:43,157
Right at this moment,

2859
02:39:43,597 --> 02:39:47,497
I will announce the final members...

2860
02:39:48,797 --> 02:39:49,897
of ALPHA DRIVE ONE.

2861
02:39:52,037 --> 02:39:54,736
Each name that is announced...

2862
02:39:54,737 --> 02:39:56,406
will no longer be an individual participant.

2863
02:39:56,407 --> 02:39:59,347
Each name will get together to shine for one team.

2864
02:40:00,447 --> 02:40:04,147
The dream of making a debut...

2865
02:40:04,287 --> 02:40:06,987
as the official group member of BOYS II PLANET will be realized.

2866
02:40:13,727 --> 02:40:18,227
Out of the 16 participants who have come this far to make a debut,

2867
02:40:18,827 --> 02:40:22,667
who will be the Top Eight member...

2868
02:40:23,337 --> 02:40:26,267
to secure a place in ALPHA DRIVE ONE?

2869
02:40:28,037 --> 02:40:30,977
Who will be the Top Eight members?

2870
02:40:42,957 --> 02:40:45,657
The Top Eight members will be decided by...

2871
02:40:46,257 --> 02:40:49,057
the first round voting that started last week...

2872
02:40:49,357 --> 02:40:53,427
and the second round voting during the live show...

2873
02:40:54,097 --> 02:40:55,397
added together.

2874
02:40:56,237 --> 02:40:58,237
The second round voting...

2875
02:40:58,667 --> 02:41:01,907
will count twice as more.

2876
02:41:13,347 --> 02:41:17,927
As a result of the total score of the final global voting,

2877
02:41:18,557 --> 02:41:23,197
from a total of 223 regions,

2878
02:41:24,797 --> 02:41:31,306
a total of 26,569,300 votes have been recorded.

2879
02:41:31,307 --> 02:41:32,766
We would like to thank you all for your support.

2880
02:41:32,767 --> 02:41:37,036
(Preliminary 1st round voting and live show 2nd round voting)

2881
02:41:37,037 --> 02:41:41,716
(Total of 26,569,300 votes)

2882
02:41:41,717 --> 02:41:43,916
The final debut team...

2883
02:41:43,917 --> 02:41:46,247
selected by the Star Creators from around the world.

2884
02:41:46,787 --> 02:41:49,956
The debut members of ALPHA DRIVE ONE,

2885
02:41:49,957 --> 02:41:52,627
the final Top Eight...

2886
02:41:53,187 --> 02:41:54,227
will be...

2887
02:41:55,627 --> 02:41:57,427
revealed now!

2888
02:42:21,417 --> 02:42:24,626
The member in 8th place of the final Top 8...

2889
02:42:24,627 --> 02:42:28,527
will be revealed at the very end.

2890
02:42:38,037 --> 02:42:40,707
We will start with the participant in seventh place...

2891
02:42:40,937 --> 02:42:45,447
that has secured a spot...

2892
02:42:46,477 --> 02:42:47,717
as a member of ALPHA DRIVE ONE.

2893
02:42:51,047 --> 02:42:54,887
(7th place)

2894
02:43:04,727 --> 02:43:06,896
(Top 8, who else besides Park Dong Gyu?)

2895
02:43:06,897 --> 02:43:09,367
(Park Dong Gyu makes it in the Top 8.)

2896
02:43:12,267 --> 02:43:16,206
(Lee Jeong)

2897
02:43:16,207 --> 02:43:20,307
Please step forward if your name gets announced.

2898
02:43:27,557 --> 02:43:31,087
(Geon Woo)

2899
02:43:35,397 --> 02:43:39,797
The first member of ALD1, ALPHA DRIVE ONE.

2900
02:43:40,067 --> 02:43:42,237
The final Top Eight.

2901
02:43:43,237 --> 02:43:44,877
This is the participant in seventh place.

2902
02:43:55,677 --> 02:43:57,787
(Chung Sang Hyeon)

2903
02:44:02,987 --> 02:44:05,587
Based on the result of the final global voting,

2904
02:44:05,727 --> 02:44:11,327
this participant has scored 3,862,466 points...

2905
02:44:11,927 --> 02:44:16,237
and has secured a debut spot as seventh place.

2906
02:44:23,307 --> 02:44:25,046
This participant left a strong impression...

2907
02:44:25,047 --> 02:44:26,847
right from the start.

2908
02:44:27,007 --> 02:44:30,616
He attracted a lot of attention from the Star Creators...

2909
02:44:30,617 --> 02:44:33,117
with his looks after his first appearance.

2910
02:44:47,367 --> 02:44:50,536
This participant's true charms...

2911
02:44:50,537 --> 02:44:53,937
were revealed by his steady growth.

2912
02:44:54,837 --> 02:44:59,977
The Star Creators seemed to have loved his changes as well.

2913
02:45:01,917 --> 02:45:03,477
(Kang Min)

2914
02:45:09,717 --> 02:45:15,157
I will now announce the participant in seventh place...

2915
02:45:15,327 --> 02:45:19,827
that will make his debut as the first member of ALPHA DRIVE ONE.

2916
02:45:43,017 --> 02:45:47,557
The participant in 7th place of the final Top 8!

2917
02:46:00,307 --> 02:46:03,506
(Jun Lee Jeong, awesome and handsome Virgo)

02:46:03,507 --> 02:46:08,417
The first member of ALPHA DRIVE ONE.

2919
02:46:15,257 --> 02:46:16,417
Seventh place.

2920
02:46:19,427 --> 02:46:20,827
The participant in seventh place...

2921
02:46:33,807 --> 02:46:35,307
is Chung Sang Hyeon!

2922
02:46:38,307 --> 02:46:42,676
(Final Top 8, 7th place, Chung Sang Hyeon)

2923
02:46:42,677 --> 02:46:49,717
(Final Top 8, 7th place, Chung Sang Hyeon)

2924
02:46:52,357 --> 02:47:00,296
(Final Top 8, 7th place, Chung Sang Hyeon)

2925
02:47:00,297 --> 02:47:05,366
(Final Top 8, 7th place, Chung Sang Hyeon)

2926
02:47:05,367 --> 02:47:10,107
(Final Top 8, 7th place, Chung Sang Hyeon)

2927
02:47:10,177 --> 02:47:13,947
Congratulations, Chung Sang Hyeon.

2928
02:47:14,317 --> 02:47:16,647
Please continue to walk forward.

2929
02:47:21,857 --> 02:47:25,657
Chung Sang Hyeong was a participant with mischievous eyes...

2930
02:47:25,787 --> 02:47:29,557
that were filled with a limitless amount of energy.

2931
02:47:29,927 --> 02:47:32,396
At times, he was like a prankster.

2932
02:47:32,397 --> 02:47:34,737
At times, he was a serious rapper.

2933
02:47:34,997 --> 02:47:36,936
He filled the stage...

2934
02:47:36,937 --> 02:47:38,767
with many different faces.

2935
02:47:39,107 --> 02:47:40,707
He made his debut...

2936
02:47:41,377 --> 02:47:43,477
with today's performance.

2937
02:47:44,137 --> 02:47:48,877
Congratulations on becoming a member of ALPHA DRIVE ONE!

2938
02:47:51,047 --> 02:47:57,117
(Chung Sang Hyeon)

2939
02:47:57,987 --> 02:47:59,257
Participant Chung Sang Hyeon.

2940
02:47:59,627 --> 02:48:01,957
Your name was the very first name to be announced.

2941
02:48:02,197 --> 02:48:04,796
Did you expect your name to be announced?

2942
02:48:04,797 --> 02:48:07,767
Please tell us how you feel right now.

2943
02:48:08,297 --> 02:48:10,836
(7th, Chung Sang Hyeon, 3,862,466 points)

2944
02:48:10,837 --> 02:48:14,067
First of all, I would like to say that I didn't expect this at all.

2945
02:48:18,907 --> 02:48:21,747
I should be saying something,

2946
02:48:22,777 --> 02:48:26,017
but I can't get myself to speak.

2947
02:48:31,127 --> 02:48:35,957
(7th, Chung Sang Hyeon)

2948
02:48:36,027 --> 02:48:38,267
It seems like...

2949
02:48:39,027 --> 02:48:42,137
he's struggling to speak because of the emotions he's going through.

2950
02:48:42,467 --> 02:48:46,336
Please say a word to thank...

2951
02:48:46,337 --> 02:48:49,577
the Star Creators who have trusted you and picked you.

2952
02:48:52,177 --> 02:48:54,177
I've always been so lacking.

2953
02:48:56,017 --> 02:48:58,317
I don't know what you like so much about me...

2954
02:48:59,087 --> 02:49:01,256
to show me so much love.

2955
02:49:01,257 --> 02:49:03,086
(It's time to make your debut, Sang Hyeon.)

2956
02:49:03,087 --> 02:49:05,327
Thank you so much.

2957
02:49:08,497 --> 02:49:12,967
(Sang Hyeon)

2958
02:49:13,027 --> 02:49:14,967
I will never forget about this moment...

2959
02:49:15,697 --> 02:49:18,367
and will continue to push forward. Thank you.

2960
02:49:23,737 --> 02:49:27,247
His words touched my heart as well.

2961
02:49:27,347 --> 02:49:29,516
There are many of the older members you are close to...

2962
02:49:29,517 --> 02:49:31,687
who haven't been called yet.

2963
02:49:32,417 --> 02:49:35,487
What would you like to say to them?

2964
02:49:39,027 --> 02:49:42,557
We've all worked so hard to reach this far together.

2965
02:49:43,797 --> 02:49:45,917
It would be great to make a debut with everyone here,

2966
02:49:46,597 --> 02:49:51,207
but if I am to choose just one person,

2967
02:49:52,437 --> 02:49:53,507
I would...

2968
02:49:55,007 --> 02:49:57,537
really want to make a debut with Li Yu.

2969
02:50:04,117 --> 02:50:06,247
Li Yu!

2970
02:50:06,787 --> 02:50:07,917
Don't cry!

2971
02:50:33,077 --> 02:50:35,076
Participant Chung Sang Hyeon,

2972
02:50:35,077 --> 02:50:38,617
congratulations once again on making your debut.

2973
02:50:41,117 --> 02:50:42,316
Thank you!

2974
02:50:42,317 --> 02:50:44,827
(Chung Sang Hyeon)

2975
02:50:44,857 --> 02:50:47,127
The final Top Eight.

2976
02:50:47,487 --> 02:50:50,127
Please move to the seat for seventh place.

2977
02:50:51,197 --> 02:50:52,197
Congratulations!

2978
02:50:59,307 --> 02:51:01,907
Next from the final Top Eight.

2979
02:51:02,707 --> 02:51:05,507
The participant in sixth place will be announced.

2980
02:51:21,197 --> 02:51:27,467
(Piglet Sang Hyeon)

2981
02:51:46,417 --> 02:51:47,487
Right.

2982
02:51:48,917 --> 02:51:50,286
Thank you for waiting.

2983
02:51:50,287 --> 02:51:51,826
With his first appearance,

2984
02:51:51,827 --> 02:51:54,227
he melted the hearts of the Star Creators with his smile.

2985
02:51:54,357 --> 02:51:57,096
Although he is still developing with his skills,

2986
02:51:57,097 --> 02:52:00,297
this participant loves performing on stage more than anyone else.

2987
02:52:00,497 --> 02:52:02,796
He will now become the youngest member...

2988
02:52:02,797 --> 02:52:05,107
of ALPHA DRIVE ONE.

2989
02:52:05,237 --> 02:52:07,806
Just like your nickname, Hip-Hop Dog-Like Cat,

2990
02:52:07,807 --> 02:52:10,076
I hope that you will be loved by the global Star Creators...

2991
02:52:10,077 --> 02:52:16,216
with your cute and charismatic charms.

2992
02:52:16,217 --> 02:52:17,217
Congratulations!

2993
02:52:29,527 --> 02:52:30,527
All right.

2994
02:52:39,037 --> 02:52:43,307
Up next, I will announce the participant in sixth place.

2995
02:52:45,977 --> 02:52:51,317
(6th place)

2996
02:52:54,987 --> 02:52:57,087
The final Top Eight.

2997
02:52:57,217 --> 02:52:59,526
This participant has made his dream come true of debuting...

2998
02:52:59,527 --> 02:53:01,797
after placing sixth.

2999
02:53:02,657 --> 02:53:05,427
Based on the result of the final global voting,

3000
02:53:07,027 --> 02:53:12,207
this participant has scored 4,147,134 points...

3001
02:53:12,307 --> 02:53:16,777
and has secured a debut spot as sixth place.

3002
02:53:31,827 --> 02:53:34,957
This participant became an All Star...

3003
02:53:35,757 --> 02:53:38,197
with his first performance.

3004
02:53:55,277 --> 02:53:57,717
And to prove his worth,

3005
02:53:58,017 --> 02:54:02,387
he developed his growth as an All Star...

3006
02:54:02,817 --> 02:54:05,487
throughout all Survivor Announcements.

3007

02:54:37,187 --> 02:54:38,557
Kim Jun Seo!

3011
02:54:44,327 --> 02:54:49,466
(Lee Jeong)

3012
02:54:49,467 --> 02:54:53,367
The one has been chosen by the Star Creators...

3013
02:54:53,537 --> 02:54:55,137
to be in 6th place of the final Top 8.

3014
02:54:55,777 --> 02:54:56,977
Kim Jun Seo!

3015
02:55:21,867 --> 02:55:23,667
This participant...

3016
02:55:23,997 --> 02:55:30,707
(Kim Jun Seo)

3017
02:55:49,597 --> 02:55:50,657
is...

3018
02:56:02,537 --> 02:56:04,037
Lee Leo! Congratulations!

3019

3022
02:56:28,167 --> 02:56:31,196

3023
02:56:31,197 --> 02:56:33,967
Please come out to the front.

3024
02:56:37,307 --> 02:56:41,677
Lee Leo will make his debut in 6th place of the final Top 8.

3025
02:56:41,817 --> 02:56:44,347
He's an all-rounder with many talents...

3026
02:56:44,547 --> 02:56:47,787
including singing, rapping, songwriting, and producing.

3027
02:56:49,087 --> 02:56:52,126
He has never lost his position in the Top Eight.

3028
02:56:52,127 --> 02:56:55,857
It's thanks to consistent support from the Star Creators.

3029
02:56:56,157 --> 02:56:58,466
It's a result that proves his strong foundation...

3030
02:56:58,467 --> 02:57:00,927
for his performing skills.

3031
02:57:01,297 --> 02:57:02,897
Congratulations on your debut.

3032

(Lee Leo)

3033
02:57:12,777 --> 02:57:13,877
Lee Leo.

3034
02:57:13,977 --> 02:57:17,947
You finally realized your dream of debuting on BOYS II PLANET.

3035
02:57:18,287 --> 02:57:19,887
Tell us how you feel.

3036
02:57:21,417 --> 02:57:27,456
(6th in Planet Top 8, Lee Leo, 4,147,134 points)

3037
02:57:27,457 --> 02:57:28,527
First of all...

3038
02:57:32,897 --> 02:57:36,237
I'd like to thank...

3039
02:57:36,667 --> 02:57:39,306
the Star Creators for encouraging...

3040
02:57:39,307 --> 02:57:43,077
and supporting me from the bottom of my heart.

3041
02:57:46,347 --> 02:57:50,346
Supporting me can't have been easy.

3042
02:57:50,347 --> 02:57:52,347
(Lee Leo in 7th place)

3043
02:57:53,317 --> 02:57:56,586
As a proud member...

3044
02:57:56,587 --> 02:57:58,427
of ALPHA DRIVE ONE,

3045
02:57:59,157 --> 02:58:03,456
I promise to pay back your love with amazing work.

3046
02:58:03,457 --> 02:58:04,557
Thank you.

3047
02:58:12,037 --> 02:58:15,736
To witness the moment of Lee Leo's debut,

3048
02:58:15,737 --> 02:58:19,676
his family members came all the way here...

3049
02:58:19,677 --> 02:58:21,477
from Australia.

3050
02:58:21,917 --> 02:58:25,146
Could you also say something to your parents?

3051
02:58:25,147 --> 02:58:26,986
(Lee Leo)

3052
02:58:26,987 --> 02:58:30,387
My mom is here.

3053
02:58:34,187 --> 02:58:35,257
Well, I...

3054
02:58:39,927 --> 02:58:40,927
I made it.

3055
02:58:42,267 --> 02:58:45,667
To realize this dream,

3056
02:58:46,337 --> 02:58:50,207
I spent seven years alone in Korea.

3057
02:58:50,837 --> 02:58:55,417
Sometimes, it was lonely.

3058
02:58:56,077 --> 02:58:58,287
During that time,

3059
02:58:58,787 --> 02:59:01,857
my family supported me silently...

3060
02:59:02,457 --> 02:59:03,587
and waited for me.

3061
02:59:04,557 --> 02:59:07,886
Thank you so much for that.

3062
02:59:07,887 --> 02:59:11,527
I'd like to say that I love them. I love you.

3063
02:59:20,767 --> 02:59:22,576
Also, Lee Leo had to put on hold...

3064
02:59:22,577 --> 02:59:25,647
his dream of becoming an idol singer for a while.

3065
02:59:26,407 --> 02:59:29,677
Could you say something to Lee Sang Won...

3066
02:59:30,147 --> 02:59:34,147
who was there to support you?

3067
02:59:38,727 --> 02:59:39,887
Only you remain.

3068
02:59:42,697 --> 02:59:43,757
Actually...

3069
02:59:47,867 --> 02:59:52,267
It was me who proposed him to participate.

3070
02:59:52,767 --> 02:59:56,977
As Sang Won agreed to participate,

3071
02:59:57,477 --> 03:00:01,347
I was able to participate as well.

3072
03:00:02,517 --> 03:00:04,547
Without Sang Won,

3073
03:00:05,747 --> 03:00:07,117
I wouldn't be here right now.

3074
03:00:08,047 --> 03:00:11,457
I got to realize the dream...

3075
03:00:12,027 --> 03:00:15,757
that I couldn't before.

3076
03:00:19,367 --> 03:00:20,367
I'm very happy.

3077
03:00:21,497 --> 03:00:24,297
Let's continue to work together...

3078
03:00:25,437 --> 03:00:27,767
and be happy. I love you.

3079
03:00:36,817 --> 03:00:44,817
(Lee Leo, congratulations on your debut.)

3080
03:00:46,257 --> 03:00:49,527
Participant Lee Leo, congratulations on your debut.

3081
03:00:57,267 --> 03:01:01,067
Please move to the sixth place...

3082
03:01:01,667 --> 03:01:03,036
of the final Top Eight.

3083
03:01:03,037 --> 03:01:05,347
(Lee Leo)

3084
03:01:09,577 --> 03:01:11,947
Once you get to know him,

3085
03:01:12,047 --> 03:01:14,887
Lee Leo is actually one of the most cheerful participants...

3086
03:01:14,987 --> 03:01:18,017
that you want to get close to.

3087
03:01:18,687 --> 03:01:21,156
With his singing skills recognized by everyone,

3088
03:01:21,157 --> 03:01:24,927
he showed his sincere love for music in every performance.

3089
03:01:25,127 --> 03:01:28,166
Under the name of ALPHA DRIVE ONE,

3090
03:01:28,167 --> 03:01:32,336
please continue your love for music.

3091
03:01:32,337 --> 03:01:34,336
Congratulations on your debut from the bottom of my heart.

3092
03:01:34,337 --> 03:01:37,177
(Lee Leo)

3093
03:02:06,807 --> 03:02:09,207
Now, there are...

3094
03:02:10,107 --> 03:02:11,377
six seats left.

3095
03:02:12,307 --> 03:02:17,377
Who will take the remaining seats in the debut team?

3096
03:02:17,847 --> 03:02:22,087
Next, I'll announce the participant in fifth place.

3097
03:02:25,757 --> 03:02:32,527
(5th place)

3098
03:02:35,567 --> 03:02:40,037
The one in fifth place to join ALPHA DRIVE ONE.

3099
03:02:41,137 --> 03:02:44,607
Based on the result of the final global voting,

3100
03:02:45,447 --> 03:02:51,576
he received 4,238,175 points.

3101
03:02:51,577 --> 03:02:54,517
His debut is confirmed in fifth place.

3102
03:03:03,897 --> 03:03:07,227
I remember his first performance.

3103
03:03:07,427 --> 03:03:11,236
With his overwhelming talent from his first appearance,

3104
03:03:11,237 --> 03:03:14,807
this participant captivated the eyes of all Star Creators.

3105
03:03:37,557 --> 03:03:41,827
He was good in every position.

3106
03:03:42,037 --> 03:03:44,537
However, if I have to pick one,

3107
03:03:45,607 --> 03:03:47,407
I'd say that his dancing was the best.

3108
03:03:47,937 --> 03:03:49,407
Yoo Kang Min.

3109
03:03:51,137 --> 03:03:52,377
Yoo Kang Min.

3110
03:04:04,957 --> 03:04:08,156
Selected by Star Creators around the world,

3111
03:04:08,157 --> 03:04:11,897
he placed fifth. Who could it be?

3112
03:04:12,497 --> 03:04:13,727
I'll announce it now.

3113
03:04:27,677 --> 03:04:35,017
(Geon Woo)

3114
03:04:41,527 --> 03:04:43,197
The final Top Eight.

3115
03:04:43,557 --> 03:04:45,827
Ranking high in fifth place,

3116
03:04:45,927 --> 03:04:48,567
he realized his dream of debut.

3117
03:04:52,737 --> 03:04:54,467
The final Top Eight.

3118
03:04:55,737 --> 03:04:57,307
The one in fifth place is...

3119
03:05:12,657 --> 03:05:14,427

(5th in the final Top 8, Zhang Jia Hao)

3122
03:05:47,857 --> 03:05:49,297
(Hao)

3123
03:05:56,567 --> 03:05:59,467
Zhang Jia Hao, congratulations from the bottom of my heart.

3124
03:05:59,567 --> 03:06:01,437
Please step forward.

3125
03:06:05,747 --> 03:06:08,376
He made his debut, placing 5th as the final Top 8.

3126
03:06:08,377 --> 03:06:10,716
During his first appearance on BOYS II PLANET,

3127
03:06:10,717 --> 03:06:14,287
he captured everyone's attention with his amazing dance skills.

3128
03:06:14,687 --> 03:06:17,957
He won the title of a dance powerhouse.

3129
03:06:18,727 --> 03:06:21,026
The efforts that he put in silently and diligently earned him...

3130
03:06:21,027 --> 03:06:23,597
the killing part which gave him wings.

3131
03:06:23,697 --> 03:06:26,726
Every moment, he proved his potential...

3132
03:06:26,727 --> 03:06:28,837
for bigger performances.

3133
03:06:29,037 --> 03:06:31,697
Zhang Jia Hao, congratulations on your debut.

3134
03:06:45,947 --> 03:06:50,216
Zhang Jia Hao, you could come this far...

3135
03:06:50,217 --> 03:06:51,716
thanks to Star Creators' love.

3136
03:06:51,717 --> 03:06:54,487
How do you feel right now?

3137
03:06:56,657 --> 03:07:00,766
(5th in Planet Top 8, Zhang Jia Hao, 4,238,175 points)

3138
03:07:00,767 --> 03:07:03,697
Actually, I...

3139
03:07:06,907 --> 03:07:10,976
I didn't think that I was very lucky.

3140
03:07:10,977 --> 03:07:13,846
(5th place, Zhang Jia Hao)

3141
03:07:13,847 --> 03:07:15,347
I didn't...

3142
03:07:16,347 --> 03:07:20,317
even imagine such a result.

3143
03:07:21,087 --> 03:07:24,516
(Zhang Jia Hao, congratulations on your debut.)

3144
03:07:24,517 --> 03:07:26,927
Star Creators.

3145
03:07:27,457 --> 03:07:29,027
Ever since we met,

3146
03:07:31,227 --> 03:07:35,967
I started to get lucky in my life.

3147
03:07:38,497 --> 03:07:40,106
Thanks to you...

3148
03:07:40,107 --> 03:07:41,166
(Jia Hao, let's debut.)

3149
03:07:41,167 --> 03:07:45,276
I can live more happily than before.

3150
03:07:45,277 --> 03:07:48,277
Thank you very much.

3151
03:07:50,817 --> 03:07:52,587
Thank you...

3152
03:07:55,047 --> 03:07:57,586
for always keeping me in your heart...

3153
03:07:57,587 --> 03:08:01,456
as your number one and supporting me.

3154
03:08:01,457 --> 03:08:02,457
(Hao is good as a legend.)

3155
03:08:02,458 --> 03:08:03,527
I hope that...

3156
03:08:05,567 --> 03:08:09,537
you'll cherish yourself more than me from now on.

3157
03:08:11,997 --> 03:08:14,807
That way, I'll feel relieved.

3158
03:08:17,807 --> 03:08:18,907
I will work harder...

3159
03:08:19,677 --> 03:08:21,476
so that I don't give you...

3160
03:08:21,477 --> 03:08:23,377
a hard time.

3161
03:08:24,917 --> 03:08:28,286
Thank you very much. I love you.

3162
03:08:28,287 --> 03:08:33,987
(I only see you, Jia Hao.)

3163
03:08:34,857 --> 03:08:36,727
Lastly,

3164
03:08:37,297 --> 03:08:41,367
my family who has always believed in me.

3165
03:08:42,397 --> 03:08:47,737
And writers, directors,

3166
03:08:48,407 --> 03:08:51,777
and the production crew of the show.

3167
03:08:52,747 --> 03:08:54,677
I'd like to thank you all.

3168
03:08:55,507 --> 03:08:59,487
Well done, everyone. Thank you.

3169
03:09:13,267 --> 03:09:17,797
I just noticed...

3170
03:09:18,037 --> 03:09:20,037
that Li Zi Hao is crying.

3171
03:09:20,337 --> 03:09:23,007
He's congratulating him.

3172
03:09:23,937 --> 03:09:26,776
Could you say something to your colleagues...

3173
03:09:26,777 --> 03:09:28,607
who are happy for you?

3174
03:09:57,477 --> 03:10:00,276
Could you tell us in Korean...

3175
03:10:00,277 --> 03:10:02,317
what you just said?

3176
03:10:03,917 --> 03:10:06,887
The Double Hao.

3177
03:10:07,487 --> 03:10:08,747
It is...

3178
03:10:10,817 --> 03:10:13,057
forever. Yes.

3179
03:10:14,187 --> 03:10:17,327
He probably means that they'll stay forever even if they're apart.

3180
03:10:22,597 --> 03:10:27,136
Participant Zhang Jia Hao became a member of ALPHA DRIVE ONE.

3181
03:10:27,137 --> 03:10:28,907
Congratulations again.

Zhang Jia Hao always played his role...

3186
03:10:50,227 --> 03:10:52,396
quietly...

3187
03:10:52,397 --> 03:10:54,427
but more clearly than anyone.

3188
03:10:54,767 --> 03:10:56,496
On stage,

3189
03:10:56,497 --> 03:10:58,636
his presence was utterly captivating.

3190
03:10:58,637 --> 03:11:00,837
His dancing was powerful.

3191
03:11:01,167 --> 03:11:06,346
Star Creators watched him throughout the process...

3192
03:11:06,347 --> 03:11:08,947
and supported him.

3193
03:11:09,247 --> 03:11:12,016

3209
03:12:41,407 --> 03:12:44,807
a presence that captivates the vibe of the stage.

3210
03:12:45,137 --> 03:12:47,076
With that strength,

3211
03:12:47,077 --> 03:12:50,316
he led his team to first place.

3212
03:12:50,317 --> 03:12:51,517
Kim Geon Woo.

3213
03:12:53,687 --> 03:12:55,047
Kim Geon Woo.

3214
03:12:58,887 --> 03:13:05,656

Kim Geon Woo.

3217
03:13:12,137 --> 03:13:13,967
Speaking of this participant,

3218
03:13:14,267 --> 03:13:16,777
we can recall so many performances.

3219
03:13:17,107 --> 03:13:19,347
Among many of them,

3220
03:13:19,907 --> 03:13:24,717
his performance during Class Switch Position Battle was...

3221
03:13:24,917 --> 03:13:28,747
one of the best moments.

3222
03:13:41,797 --> 03:13:45,166

03:13:45,167 --> 03:13:48,107

03:14:56,037 --> 03:14:58,237
(Geon Woo)

3232
03:15:04,517 --> 03:15:06,816
Congratulations, Kim Geon Woo.

3233
03:15:06,817 --> 03:15:07,987
Please step forward.

3234
03:15:12,687 --> 03:15:14,256
On BOYS II PLANET K,

3235
03:15:14,257 --> 03:15:16,596
he got the killing part during Signal Song Test.

3236
03:15:16,597 --> 03:15:19,597
The star who captured attention from his first performance.

3237
03:15:20,227 --> 03:15:23,336
His perfect looks and unwavering live performance.

3238
03:15:23,337 --> 03:15:25,766
Despite the fierce competition,

3239
03:15:25,767 --> 03:15:28,837
he took full responsibility and gave his all until the end.

3240
03:15:29,007 --> 03:15:32,006
The word "all-rounder..."

3241
03:15:32,007 --> 03:15:33,506
fits him perfectly.

3242
03:15:33,507 --> 03:15:34,676
(Geon Woo)

3243
03:15:34,677 --> 03:15:37,977

Congratulations, Kim Geon Woo.

3246
03:15:54,597 --> 03:15:57,436
At the end of your four years as a trainee,

3247
03:15:57,437 --> 03:15:59,836
you finally realized your dream to debut.

3248
03:15:59,837 --> 03:16:01,307
How do you feel now?

3249
03:16:02,437 --> 03:16:05,476
(4th in Planet Top 8, Kim Geon Woo, 4,854,331 points)

3250
03:16:05,477 --> 03:16:09,577
As a trainee, I've been dreaming...

3251
03:16:10,717 --> 03:16:12,987
of this moment for a long time.

3252
03:16:14,817 --> 03:16:15,847
Actually,

3253
03:16:18,057 --> 03:16:22,286
I wasn't sure of debuting at the end...

3254
03:16:22,287 --> 03:16:23,897
of the final performance.

3255
03:16:25,857 --> 03:16:28,627
I didn't expect it to happen,

3256
03:16:28,767 --> 03:16:31,067
so I feel a bit shocked.

3257
03:16:31,167 --> 03:16:33,967
I feel extremely happy.

3258
03:16:35,237 --> 03:16:37,077
I feel very happy...

3259
03:16:37,337 --> 03:16:39,207
and very thankful.

3260
03:16:45,377 --> 03:16:48,886
You've been a trainee for a long time.

3261
03:16:48,887 --> 03:16:53,657
I'm sure your parents are happier than anyone right now.

3262
03:16:53,827 --> 03:16:57,396
Why don't you say a word to your parents?

3263
03:16:57,397 --> 03:17:00,397
(Geon Woo)

3264
03:17:12,807 --> 03:17:14,907
You can cry. It's okay.

3265
03:17:19,517 --> 03:17:20,587
Congratulations.

3266
03:17:21,187 --> 03:17:25,457
I can sense that there's so much gratitude...

3267
03:17:25,917 --> 03:17:29,896
and love in his tears.

3268
03:17:29,897 --> 03:17:31,896
(Geon Woo)

3269
03:17:31,897 --> 03:17:34,667
Right now,

3270
03:17:35,727 --> 03:17:38,397
Geon Woo's parents must be celebrating his debut.

3271
03:17:38,767 --> 03:17:40,736
Please take a moment to calm your feelings...

3272
03:17:40,737 --> 03:17:42,567
and share a few words with them.

3273
03:17:46,777 --> 03:17:48,547
My parents...

3274
03:17:54,917 --> 03:17:57,257
rooted for my dream so much.

3275
03:18:04,997 --> 03:18:06,596
(Geon Woo)

3276
03:18:06,597 --> 03:18:08,767
In a way, they worried about me...

3277
03:18:09,167 --> 03:18:11,666
more than I worried about myself.

3278
03:18:11,667 --> 03:18:16,576
(Geon Woo)

3279
03:18:16,577 --> 03:18:20,377
I know that this journey has been tougher on them than it was on me.

3280
03:18:22,177 --> 03:18:23,847
So I feel guilty about that.

3281
03:18:34,287 --> 03:18:38,097
Because I couldn't secure a stable career path,

3282
03:18:39,097 --> 03:18:41,097
I felt so bad about it.

3283
03:18:42,267 --> 03:18:43,537
So...

3284
03:18:44,797 --> 03:18:47,937
I acted more indifferently toward them.

3285
03:18:49,367 --> 03:18:51,476
I'm so sorry about that.

3286
03:18:51,477 --> 03:18:53,506
(Geon Woo)

3287
03:18:53,507 --> 03:18:54,546
And...

3288
03:18:54,547 --> 03:18:56,577
I love you so much.

3289
03:19:00,117 --> 03:19:02,247
I'll make you guys happy from now on.

3290
03:19:05,757 --> 03:19:12,197
(Geon Woo)

3291
03:19:13,197 --> 03:19:14,227
Thank you.

3292
03:19:15,797 --> 03:19:17,797
All right. Please...

3293
03:19:18,537 --> 03:19:21,067
take the spot for 4th place in the Top 8.

3294
03:19:21,237 --> 03:19:22,566
Can I say one more thing?

3295
03:19:22,567 --> 03:19:25,177
Of course. You can say ten things if you like.

3296
03:19:26,677 --> 03:19:29,517
I can't take my spot without thanking...

3297
03:19:31,317 --> 03:19:33,517
the Star Creators.

3298
03:19:34,517 --> 03:19:35,517
I...

3299
03:19:37,457 --> 03:19:39,256
sincerely believe that...

3300
03:19:39,257 --> 03:19:41,126
I couldn't have gotten this spot without their support.

3301
03:19:41,127 --> 03:19:43,696
(Geon Woo, I hope to see you for a long time!)

3302
03:19:43,697 --> 03:19:44,856
Well...

3303
03:19:44,857 --> 03:19:46,626
(Geon Woo)

3304
03:19:46,627 --> 03:19:49,567
I tend to sound quite indifferent when I talk.

3305
03:19:49,937 --> 03:19:53,206
And I asked them to have faith in me.

3306
03:19:53,207 --> 03:19:54,407
(Geon Woo)

3307
03:19:58,437 --> 03:19:59,507
Actually,

3308
03:20:00,277 --> 03:20:04,147
it really broke my heart...

3309
03:20:05,317 --> 03:20:07,517
when I saw my supportive fans...

3310
03:20:07,617 --> 03:20:09,486
having a hard time.

3311
03:20:09,487 --> 03:20:15,586
(Geon Woo)

3312
03:20:15,587 --> 03:20:16,657
I think...

3313
03:20:17,657 --> 03:20:19,457
this might have been...

3314
03:20:22,027 --> 03:20:24,667
much tougher on them than what I had to endure.

3315
03:20:25,967 --> 03:20:27,007
I really...

3316
03:20:28,607 --> 03:20:32,376
wanted to tell you that you guys were so brave and strong.

3317
03:20:32,377 --> 03:20:34,377
That's what I wanted to tell you all.

3318
03:20:34,977 --> 03:20:37,517
I'm always grateful to you.

3319
03:20:38,647 --> 03:20:41,117
And I'll return the support now. Thank you so much.

3320
03:20:44,217 --> 03:20:46,656
(Geon Woo, I hope to see you for a long time!)

3321
03:20:46,657 --> 03:20:48,626
He's planning to return...

3322
03:20:48,627 --> 03:20:50,157
the support he's received...

3323
03:20:50,357 --> 03:20:52,966
with touching and cool performances in the future.

3324
03:20:52,967 --> 03:20:54,527
Thank you for that.

3325
03:20:54,867 --> 03:20:58,297
Please take the spot for 4th place in the Top 8.

3326
03:20:58,897 --> 03:21:00,007
Congratulations.

3327
03:21:07,707 --> 03:21:10,876
Geon Woo always worked diligently...

3328
03:21:10,877 --> 03:21:14,817
and patiently to execute his role on the team.

3329
03:21:15,347 --> 03:21:17,157
His unwavering effort...

3330
03:21:19,157 --> 03:21:20,727
instilled confidence in the audience...

3331
03:21:20,857 --> 03:21:22,627
whenever he performed on stage.

3332
03:21:23,297 --> 03:21:26,256
The skills and trust he built with each performance...

3333
03:21:26,257 --> 03:21:27,326
while staying grounded...

3334
03:21:27,327 --> 03:21:30,397
were the driving force that made his debut possible.

3335
03:21:30,867 --> 03:21:33,766
I hope you soar to new heights...

3336
03:21:33,767 --> 03:21:38,177
and wider horizons as a member of ALPHA DRIVE ONE.

3337
03:21:57,657 --> 03:22:00,327
- Thank you. - Please take your seat now.

3338
03:22:00,527 --> 03:22:01,567
Congratulations.

3339
03:22:16,617 --> 03:22:18,917
Now, I will announce...

3340
03:22:19,987 --> 03:22:22,817
the participant in third place.

3341
03:22:32,497 --> 03:22:38,466
(3rd place)

3342
03:22:38,467 --> 03:22:41,107
This participant will join...

3343
03:22:41,567 --> 03:22:44,336
ALPHA DRIVE ONE as third place...

3344
03:22:44,337 --> 03:22:47,477
based on the results of the final global voting.

3345
03:22:47,847 --> 03:22:51,277
This participant received...

3346
03:22:51,747 --> 03:22:56,957
a total of 5,731,887 points from the final global voting...

3347
03:22:57,357 --> 03:23:00,357
and finalized his position in the group as third place.

3348
03:23:10,497 --> 03:23:12,166
I was impressed...

3349
03:23:12,167 --> 03:23:15,667
with this participant's performance every single time.

3350
03:23:16,007 --> 03:23:20,376
He had the ability to catch the Star Creators' attention...

3351
03:23:20,377 --> 03:23:23,517
in a heartbeat with all of his performances.

3352
03:23:30,157 --> 03:23:31,187
You got this!

3353
03:23:32,487 --> 03:23:35,457
He dominates the stage with his charisma.

3354
03:23:35,987 --> 03:23:39,257
But off stage, he's friendly and innocent.

3355
03:23:39,997 --> 03:23:43,737
I believe the contrast on and off stage...

3356
03:23:44,737 --> 03:23:47,967
makes the participant more lovable.

3357
03:23:56,617 --> 03:24:00,517
Here's the participant in 3rd place of the final Top 8.

3358
03:24:20,967 --> 03:24:25,807
The participant will join ALPHA DRIVE ONE in third place.

3359
03:24:34,617 --> 03:24:36,657
His dream of debuting will finally come true.

3360
03:24:37,957 --> 03:24:39,187
The third place...

3361
03:24:40,127 --> 03:24:41,187
of the final Top Eight...

3362
03:24:42,627 --> 03:24:43,697
is...

3363
03:25:05,477 --> 03:25:06,847
He Xin Long. Congratulations.

3364
03:25:09,187 --> 03:25:15,626

3394
03:27:10,907 --> 03:27:13,847
has finally come to fruition.

(He Xin Long)

3406
03:28:05,597 --> 03:28:06,597
Every time...

people asked me what I wanted to say...

3408
03:28:13,837 --> 03:28:16,337
to the fans...

(Xin Long and Geon Woo will both make their debut!)

3414
03:28:34,557 --> 03:28:37,157
Thanks to you, I was able...

3415
03:28:38,497 --> 03:28:39,497
(Make the debut, Xin Long.)

3416
03:28:39,498 --> 03:28:41,797
to give you a good performance.

3417
03:28:43,097 --> 03:28:44,937
And thanks to you,

3418
03:28:46,767 --> 03:28:51,077
I can become a singer who will receive more love.

3419
03:28:51,177 --> 03:28:55,377

the Masters who have helped me...

3426
03:29:20,207 --> 03:29:21,837

3431
03:29:42,887 --> 03:29:47,197
The members of JYP Entertainment,

(He Xin Long)

3438
03:30:27,637 --> 03:30:31,537
Thank you for having faith in me.

3439
03:30:32,037 --> 03:30:34,647
You can stop worrying.

3440
03:30:35,147 --> 03:30:39,047
I'll keep looking after myself...

3441
03:30:39,347 --> 03:30:42,647
and become a better singer.

3442
03:30:45,017 --> 03:30:46,087
Mom.

3443
03:30:49,887 --> 03:30:51,257
Thank you for your hard work.

3444
03:31:04,507 --> 03:31:06,907
Is your mother here?

3445
03:31:07,647 --> 03:31:10,576
- Yes. - Thank you, ma'am,

3446
03:31:10,577 --> 03:31:13,787
for raising Xin Long.

3447
03:31:15,887 --> 03:31:16,887
Thank you.

3448
03:31:19,287 --> 03:31:23,456
Lastly, I have something to say...

3449
03:31:23,457 --> 03:31:27,667
to my 11-year-old self.

3450
03:31:30,167 --> 03:31:35,167
Thank you for choosing this path.

3451
03:31:35,437 --> 03:31:39,436
I will keep improving...

3452
03:31:39,437 --> 03:31:40,947
for you.

3453
03:31:43,147 --> 03:31:44,417
Great job.

3454
03:31:46,717 --> 03:31:48,847
And An Xin.

3455
03:31:49,717 --> 03:31:53,017
I kept my promise.

3456
03:31:53,757 --> 03:31:54,957
I'll wait for you.

3457
03:31:57,897 --> 03:32:02,427
Thank you.

3458
03:32:10,837 --> 03:32:14,547
Xin Long, congratulations once again!

3459
03:32:20,017 --> 03:32:22,946
Now, please move to the third place seat...

3460
03:32:22,947 --> 03:32:24,217
among the Top Eight.

3461
03:32:28,687 --> 03:32:30,727
He's gentle off the stage,

3462
03:32:31,027 --> 03:32:34,967
but his eyes completely change once he's on the stage.

3463
03:32:35,467 --> 03:32:39,597
This challenge must have been a tough decision for him.

3464
03:32:39,837 --> 03:32:42,907
But the character he's shown throughout the program...

3465
03:32:43,007 --> 03:32:45,507
and his persistence to keep performing...

3466
03:32:45,607 --> 03:32:49,507
helped him get to where he is now.

3467
03:32:50,047 --> 03:32:53,846
I will sincerely root for your new achievements...

3468
03:32:53,847 --> 03:32:56,946
as a member of ALPHA DRIVE ONE.

3469
03:32:56,947 --> 03:32:58,416
Congratulations on your debut!

3470
03:32:58,417 --> 03:33:02,487

of the Top Eight.

3481
03:34:05,457 --> 03:34:10,956
(1st place)

3482
03:34:10,957 --> 03:34:12,357
The two candidates...

3483
03:34:13,197 --> 03:34:15,467

3492
03:35:53,327 --> 03:36:00,236
(1st place Sang Won)

3493
03:36:00,237 --> 03:36:06,707
(1st place Sang Won)

3494
03:36:21,027 --> 03:36:23,897
From the beginning to the end of BOYS II PLANET,

3495
03:36:24,197 --> 03:36:26,396
the two have always competed...

3496
03:36:26,397 --> 03:36:29,497
for 1st place in the Top 8.

3497
03:36:33,467 --> 03:36:35,967
Between Sang Won and An Xin,

3498
03:36:36,567 --> 03:36:38,537
who will make his glorious debut...

3499
03:36:38,937 --> 03:36:41,747
as number one?

3500
03:36:42,877 --> 03:36:44,177
Who will it be?

3501
03:36:51,987 --> 03:36:53,157
Lee Sang Won.

3502
03:36:55,057 --> 03:36:56,986
The moment your debut was confirmed,

3503
03:36:56,987 --> 03:36:58,096
you became a first place candidate.

3504
03:36:58,097 --> 03:37:00,597
How do you feel right now?

3505
03:37:09,637 --> 03:37:13,277
First of all,

3506
03:37:13,837 --> 03:37:16,877
being here is...

3507
03:37:17,317 --> 03:37:19,277
an extremely meaningful...

3508
03:37:19,847 --> 03:37:23,846
and precious...

3509
03:37:23,847 --> 03:37:25,956
experience.

3510
03:37:25,957 --> 03:37:28,227
(Hey, Sang Won.)

3511
03:37:29,827 --> 03:37:31,297
Going beyond that...

3512
03:37:31,897 --> 03:37:36,297
and becoming a first place candidate...

3513
03:37:37,467 --> 03:37:38,467

03:37:40,907 --> 03:37:43,637
until...

3515
03:37:44,107 --> 03:37:45,836
the final episode...

3516
03:37:45,837 --> 03:37:50,377
(1st place Sang Won)

3517
03:37:57,087 --> 03:38:01,826
still hasn't sunk in.

3518
03:38:01,827 --> 03:38:07,027
To be honest, I was anxious.

3519
03:38:07,867 --> 03:38:12,067
But fortunately,

3520
03:38:13,267 --> 03:38:15,267
being able to become...

3521
03:38:16,407 --> 03:38:18,376
a first place candidate once again...

3522
03:38:18,377 --> 03:38:20,407
makes me happy, and it is a great honor.

3523
03:38:20,977 --> 03:38:23,377
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

3524
03:38:31,287 --> 03:38:34,327
We'd like to hear from Zhou An Xin as well.

3525
03:38:38,297 --> 03:38:40,127
Firstly,

3526
03:38:42,527 --> 03:38:45,467
I was able to come this far...

3527
03:38:45,997 --> 03:38:48,666
because of the Star Creators,

3528
03:38:48,667 --> 03:38:51,837
so thank you to them.

3529
03:38:51,907 --> 03:38:54,246
(Zhou An Xin)

3530
03:38:54,247 --> 03:38:56,977
During this show,

3531
03:38:58,717 --> 03:38:59,847
I...

3532
03:39:00,577 --> 03:39:04,917
felt very anxious and nervous.

3533
03:39:05,857 --> 03:39:10,926
But I learned many valuable lessons.

3534
03:39:10,927 --> 03:39:12,173
(Hola to 1st place, Zhou An Xin.)

3535
03:39:12,197 --> 03:39:17,497
Meeting such cool participants...

3536
03:39:18,337 --> 03:39:19,837
was a great honor.

3537
03:39:22,067 --> 03:39:25,307
Being on BOYS II PLANET...

3538
03:39:26,877 --> 03:39:29,877
will be...

3539
03:39:30,917 --> 03:39:35,887
an unforgettable memory.

3540
03:39:37,587 --> 03:39:39,257
Great work...

3541
03:39:40,827 --> 03:39:46,927

3542
03:39:47,667 --> 03:39:50,197
including the hair and makeup team.

3543
03:39:53,397 --> 03:39:55,037
Once again,

3544
03:39:56,307 --> 03:39:58,577
I'm standing next to Sang Won.

3545
03:40:00,237 --> 03:40:01,247
Let's see.

3546
03:40:05,047 --> 03:40:06,577
How do I put it?

3547
03:40:07,687 --> 03:40:10,317
- You can do it. - We're also very curious.

3548
03:40:13,157 --> 03:40:14,257
I'm...

3549
03:40:15,257 --> 03:40:16,487
extremely happy.

3550
03:40:17,857 --> 03:40:20,397
Thank you...

3551
03:40:21,797 --> 03:40:24,967
to the Star Creators...

3552
03:40:26,237 --> 03:40:30,567
for letting me stand next to him again.

3553
03:40:31,277 --> 03:40:35,407
I'll continue to do my best.

3554
03:40:36,677 --> 03:40:41,287
Let's go, ALPHA DRIVE ONE.

3555
03:40:49,357 --> 03:40:54,056
Good. Between the two participants,

3556
03:40:54,057 --> 03:40:55,667
Lee Sang Won and Zhou An Xin,

3557
03:40:55,727 --> 03:40:58,837
who will take the top spot,

3558
03:40:59,567 --> 03:41:01,607
the first place,

3559
03:41:02,107 --> 03:41:05,977
in the final Top Eight...

3560
03:41:08,907 --> 03:41:10,077
of BOYS II PLANET?

3561
03:41:27,427 --> 03:41:29,667
One of the two will take first place,

3562
03:41:29,967 --> 03:41:33,697
and the other will take second.

3563
03:41:41,107 --> 03:41:43,847
And the result of fate...

3564
03:41:46,747 --> 03:41:47,747
is...

3565
03:41:53,387 --> 03:41:54,787
I see.

3566
03:42:02,027 --> 03:42:03,497
What a surprise.

3567
03:42:05,597 --> 03:42:07,367
The result of fate...

3568
03:42:09,507 --> 03:42:12,306
will be revealed shortly.

3569
03:42:12,307 --> 03:42:15,176
(The 1st place result of the final Top 8...)

3570
03:42:15,177 --> 03:42:17,817
(of BOYS II PLANET will be revealed shortly!)

3571
03:42:18,977 --> 03:42:25,656
(Lee Sang Won)

3572
03:42:25,657 --> 03:42:26,687
(Lee Leo)

3573
03:42:50,247 --> 03:42:53,847
The final live episode of BOYS II PLANET.

3574
03:42:54,847 --> 03:42:56,847
I will now continue...

3575
03:42:57,987 --> 03:42:59,687
with the announcement...

3576
03:43:01,057 --> 03:43:02,777
of the 1st place winner of the final Top 8.

3577
03:43:06,497 --> 03:43:08,366
Among the two first place candidates,

3578
03:43:08,367 --> 03:43:10,697
the name that is called will take first place,

3579
03:43:10,827 --> 03:43:14,407
and the other will be second.

3580
03:43:18,237 --> 03:43:21,076
According to the final global voting results,

3581
03:43:21,077 --> 03:43:22,747
the difference between...

3582
03:43:23,147 --> 03:43:28,887
the 1st and 2nd place was 1,343,640 points.

3583
03:43:35,127 --> 03:43:39,357
I will now announce the participant who has earned...

3584
03:43:39,657 --> 03:43:40,897
the glorious first place.

3585
03:43:47,297 --> 03:43:51,206
The one who received the most votes...

3586
03:43:51,207 --> 03:43:54,407
from Star Creators around the world. The first place participant...

3587
03:43:55,147 --> 03:43:56,207
of the final Top Eight.

3588
03:44:02,487 --> 03:44:06,417
Taking the glorious first place and set to debut...

3589
03:44:07,887 --> 03:44:10,227
in ALPHA DRIVE ONE, ALD1,

3590
03:44:21,437 --> 03:44:24,707
is...

3591
03:44:26,977 --> 03:44:28,047
It is...

3592
03:44:43,357 --> 03:44:44,857
Lee Sang Won. Congratulations.

3593
03:44:45,597 --> 03:44:50,366
(1st place of the final Top 8, Lee Sang Won)

3594
03:44:50,367 --> 03:44:54,037
(1st place of the final Top 8, Lee Sang Won)

3595
03:45:07,547 --> 03:45:13,387
(Lee Sang Won)

3596
03:45:27,337 --> 03:45:29,466
Congratulations, Lee Sang Won.

3597
03:45:29,467 --> 03:45:31,977
You were able to hold onto first place until the very end.

3598
03:45:32,337 --> 03:45:34,237
How do you feel right now?

3599
03:45:34,777 --> 03:45:36,776
(1st in Planet Top 8, Lee Sang Won, 7,293,777 points)

3600
03:45:36,777 --> 03:45:39,647
Lee Sang Won, how do you feel right now?

3601
03:45:42,917 --> 03:45:46,416
Honestly, I thought An Xin would win first place.

3602
03:45:46,417 --> 03:45:48,857
(Lee Sang Won in 1st place)

3603
03:45:51,997 --> 03:45:53,197
All of you...

3604
03:45:58,367 --> 03:46:00,767
Today marks the day I start...

3605
03:46:01,537 --> 03:46:05,477
caring for all of you more than myself.

3606
03:46:07,237 --> 03:46:08,277
Really.

3607
03:46:09,777 --> 03:46:12,647
Thanks to everyone, I'm overjoyed.

3608
03:46:13,447 --> 03:46:15,947
Thank you very much. I truly mean it.

3609
03:46:19,157 --> 03:46:20,287
Honestly,

3610
03:46:23,657 --> 03:46:24,827
if...

3611
03:46:27,797 --> 03:46:30,297
I didn't have...

3612
03:46:32,137 --> 03:46:35,807
my fans and Star Creators,

3613
03:46:39,977 --> 03:46:42,977
I wouldn't even dare to say...

3614
03:46:44,847 --> 03:46:48,347
that I'm here right now.

3615
03:46:48,947 --> 03:46:53,657
I came on this show for all of you,

3616
03:46:54,487 --> 03:46:59,357
and I was able to do my best...

3617
03:47:01,097 --> 03:47:03,497
because of your support.

3618
03:47:03,827 --> 03:47:04,967
Really.

3619
03:47:07,237 --> 03:47:10,366
Thank you very much.

3620
03:47:10,367 --> 03:47:12,877
(Sang Won, you are the ray of light I will never let go of.)

3621
03:47:17,147 --> 03:47:21,787
If there were a word that meant more than "thank you,"

3622
03:47:22,047 --> 03:47:23,247
I...

3623
03:47:26,457 --> 03:47:31,457
would have repeated it over and over.

3624
03:47:31,997 --> 03:47:34,597
But right now,

3625
03:47:34,967 --> 03:47:37,327
"thank you from the bottom of my heart..."

3626
03:47:37,827 --> 03:47:40,266
is all I can think of.

3627
03:47:40,267 --> 03:47:41,967
(Lee Sang Won, let's debut in 1st place.)

3628
03:47:44,977 --> 03:47:49,277
I'm excited to the point that...

3629
03:47:49,377 --> 03:47:52,917
I want to make eye contact...

3630
03:47:53,347 --> 03:47:55,317
with everyone...

3631
03:47:58,917 --> 03:48:00,017
who supports me.

3632
03:48:00,657 --> 03:48:01,757
And...

3633
03:48:03,487 --> 03:48:06,497
Until now...

3634
03:48:07,197 --> 03:48:10,967
and in the future,

3635
03:48:12,837 --> 03:48:15,007
there hasn't been,

3636
03:48:15,807 --> 03:48:18,107
and won't be, another journey...

3637
03:48:19,777 --> 03:48:21,377
as beautiful as this.

3638
03:48:22,347 --> 03:48:23,477
Also,

3639
03:48:25,977 --> 03:48:29,347
to my parents.

3640
03:48:31,017 --> 03:48:33,386
(Hey, Sang Won.)

3641
03:48:33,387 --> 03:48:35,287
It took a really long time, didn't it?

3642
03:48:53,537 --> 03:48:55,377
Mom and Dad,

3643
03:49:00,547 --> 03:49:03,387
if there's...

3644
03:49:04,517 --> 03:49:06,117
If there's...

3645
03:49:07,017 --> 03:49:11,087
one thing I can truly boast about in my life,

3646
03:49:11,697 --> 03:49:14,457
it's being your son.

3647
03:49:22,437 --> 03:49:26,837
Thank you for being my mom and dad.

3648
03:49:29,407 --> 03:49:31,747
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

3649
03:49:47,357 --> 03:49:50,527
I still can't believe it.

3650
03:49:51,967 --> 03:49:54,967
But from now on, I'll try to believe in it over time.

3651
03:49:55,537 --> 03:49:56,906
Thank you so much.

3652
03:49:56,907 --> 03:50:00,336
I will work really hard.

3653
03:50:00,337 --> 03:50:04,677
I will give back and show my love to you as much as I can.

3654
03:50:05,777 --> 03:50:08,887
Thank you to my two big sisters as well.

3655
03:50:10,517 --> 03:50:13,257
I truly respect...

3656
03:50:14,117 --> 03:50:18,296
all the staff who worked...

3657
03:50:18,297 --> 03:50:20,757
even harder than we did...

3658
03:50:22,767 --> 03:50:26,337
during the three months...

3659
03:50:27,137 --> 03:50:29,566
of filming BOYS II PLANET,

3660
03:50:29,567 --> 03:50:31,807
which felt like...

3661
03:50:32,137 --> 03:50:34,777
a whole year.

3662
03:50:35,547 --> 03:50:38,576
They are all incredible people.

3663
03:50:38,577 --> 03:50:40,217
Thank you very much.

3664
03:50:46,257 --> 03:50:48,227
I love you all.

3665
03:50:50,257 --> 03:50:55,497
I will do my best to become a proud member of ALPHA DRIVE ONE...

3666
03:50:56,367 --> 03:50:59,597
and to live up to being the forever first place...

3667
03:50:59,997 --> 03:51:01,707
Lee Sang Won.

3668
03:51:02,067 --> 03:51:04,567
I will give it my all. Thank you.

3669
03:51:05,377 --> 03:51:06,677
I love you.

3670
03:51:10,977 --> 03:51:12,417
Well done.

3671
03:51:15,987 --> 03:51:18,887
With this, the second place winner...

3672
03:51:19,117 --> 03:51:21,927
of the final Top Eight is Zhou An Xin.

3673
03:51:22,457 --> 03:51:25,197
The debut you've dreamed of has come true.

3674
03:51:26,797 --> 03:51:28,057
Zhou An Xin,

3675
03:51:28,267 --> 03:51:30,127
please say a few words.

3676
03:51:31,127 --> 03:51:33,837
First of all,

3677
03:51:34,967 --> 03:51:37,637
thank you to my parents.

3678
03:51:37,907 --> 03:51:43,377
I came to Korea all alone last year,

3679
03:51:43,777 --> 03:51:47,376
and my mom...

3680
03:51:47,377 --> 03:51:50,917
(Zhou An Xin in 2nd place)

3681
03:51:53,287 --> 03:51:55,786
Cheered me on?

3682
03:51:55,787 --> 03:51:58,196
(Zhou An Xin)

3683
03:51:58,197 --> 03:52:01,027
My mom has...

3684
03:52:01,797 --> 03:52:03,627
cheered me on so much.

3685
03:52:04,727 --> 03:52:08,667
That's why I'd especially...

3686
03:52:09,837 --> 03:52:11,067
like to thank her.

3687
03:52:12,177 --> 03:52:15,747
My mom doesn't know any Korean,

3688
03:52:15,847 --> 03:52:17,407
but she keeps crying.

3689
03:52:18,947 --> 03:52:20,876
May I say a few words in Chinese?

3690
03:52:20,877 --> 03:52:22,787
Of course. Go ahead.

3691
03:52:54,917 --> 03:52:58,487
The others have already said what I wanted to say.

3692
03:52:58,717 --> 03:52:59,957
So...

3693
03:53:00,757 --> 03:53:05,227
Let's go, ALPHA DRIVE ONE!

3694
03:53:13,497 --> 03:53:16,007
Let's go, ALPHA DRIVE ONE.

3695
03:53:16,207 --> 03:53:18,307
Nice.

3696
03:53:18,477 --> 03:53:20,736
The more I hear it, the cooler...

3697
03:53:20,737 --> 03:53:24,347
the group name feels, and it rolls off the tongue easily.

3698
03:53:24,707 --> 03:53:27,116
Lee Sang Won in first place.

3699
03:53:27,117 --> 03:53:30,947
Zhou An Xin in second place. Congratulations on your debut.

3700
03:53:36,687 --> 03:53:38,357
What a wonderful sight.

3701
03:53:40,557 --> 03:53:42,827
Please make your way...

3702
03:53:42,967 --> 03:53:45,736
to the final Top Eight seats.

3703
03:53:45,737 --> 03:53:48,807
Zhou An Xin, would you head to your seat first?

3704
03:53:54,207 --> 03:53:56,706
Zhou An Xin first captured attention...

3705
03:53:56,707 --> 03:54:00,017
with the killing part in PLANET C's signal song.

3706
03:54:00,217 --> 03:54:02,916
In every mission, he touched viewers...

3707
03:54:02,917 --> 03:54:07,787
with his sweet and pure tone.

3708
03:54:08,487 --> 03:54:11,026
His stable skills, which kept him...

3709
03:54:11,027 --> 03:54:14,427
in the top debut ranks throughout the show,

3710
03:54:14,697 --> 03:54:18,397
along with his childlike innocence,

3711
03:54:18,567 --> 03:54:21,667
must be what consistently won the hearts of Star Creators.

3712
03:54:21,837 --> 03:54:25,206
From now on, please fill stages around the world...

3713
03:54:25,207 --> 03:54:28,647
as the voice of ALPHA DRIVE ONE.

3714
03:54:28,707 --> 03:54:30,547
Congratulations once again.

3715
03:54:57,307 --> 03:54:59,707
Lastly, the glorious first place.

3716
03:55:00,807 --> 03:55:04,377
Lee Sang Won, please head to your seat.

3717
03:55:14,717 --> 03:55:16,957
Knowing the weight of the ranks,

3718
03:55:17,227 --> 03:55:19,127
Lee Sang Won wanted to give his best...

3719
03:55:19,257 --> 03:55:21,797
and faced many dilemmas about performing.

3720
03:55:22,667 --> 03:55:26,167
After pausing his pursuit of a debut,

3721
03:55:26,467 --> 03:55:27,996
he returned...

3722
03:55:27,997 --> 03:55:31,007
three years later with great determination.

3723
03:55:31,707 --> 03:55:35,107
Moving past the time when he had given up on performing,

3724
03:55:35,777 --> 03:55:38,307
his new challenge...

3725
03:55:39,177 --> 03:55:42,047
ultimately led to his debut.

3726
03:55:42,387 --> 03:55:46,756
As a member of ALPHA DRIVE ONE,

3727
03:55:46,757 --> 03:55:48,627

3728
03:55:48,757 --> 03:55:51,327
why the Star Creators' decision was never wrong.

3729
03:55:51,627 --> 03:55:55,167
I hope you keep proving yourself.

3730
03:55:55,727 --> 03:55:57,267

03:58:37,227 --> 03:58:38,797

(Kang Min)

3776
04:00:38,207 --> 04:00:39,647
Among these three,

3777
04:00:39,917 --> 04:00:43,747
who will join the debut team...

3778
04:00:45,087 --> 04:00:46,457

04:01:15,747 --> 04:01:19,557
Only 1 of these 3 will fulfill his dream...

3783
04:01:19,987 --> 04:01:23,486
of making the debut in eighth place.

3784
04:01:23,487 --> 04:01:27,397
(Jun Seo)

3785
04:01:34,237 --> 04:01:36,137
First,

3786
04:01:36,807 --> 04:01:40,737
I will announce number ten who unfortunately cannot...

3787
04:01:41,477 --> 04:01:43,407
fulfill his dream of making his debut...

3788
04:01:45,077 --> 04:01:46,747
on BOYS II PLANET.

3789
04:01:47,847 --> 04:01:49,286
This is so nerve-racking.

3790
04:01:49,287 --> 04:01:50,747
Please.

3791
04:01:59,127 --> 04:02:00,157
The member...

3792
04:02:01,597 --> 04:02:04,097
who placed tenth is...

3793
04:02:24,387 --> 04:02:25,557
Kang Min!

3794
04:02:26,187 --> 04:02:27,357
Li Yu!

3795
04:02:32,157 --> 04:02:33,557
The tenth-place member is...

3796
04:02:34,727 --> 04:02:35,797
Chuei Li Yu.

3797
04:02:37,227 --> 04:02:41,436
(10th place, Chuei Li Yu)

3798
04:02:41,437 --> 04:02:45,067
Li Yu, don't be discouraged!

3799
04:02:45,807 --> 04:02:46,937
No!

3800
04:02:52,147 --> 04:02:53,277
Please!

3801
04:02:53,917 --> 04:02:56,647
Are you serious right now?

3802
04:02:56,817 --> 04:02:59,187
The other participants...

3803
04:03:00,187 --> 04:03:02,757
are giving him a warm hug.

3804
04:03:08,127 --> 04:03:09,597
This makes no sense.

3805
04:03:12,197 --> 04:03:13,337
This isn't fair!

3806
04:03:13,597 --> 04:03:15,237
Poor An Xin.

3807
04:03:17,207 --> 04:03:18,367
Li Yu.

3808
04:03:18,567 --> 04:03:21,737
Although you couldn't join the debut team,

3809
04:03:22,177 --> 04:03:24,147
you've shown...

3810
04:03:24,307 --> 04:03:27,717
enough potential by placing tenth.

3811
04:03:28,377 --> 04:03:31,386
Your performances and passion...

3812
04:03:31,387 --> 04:03:35,987
will live on in the hearts the Star Creators.

3813
04:03:36,627 --> 04:03:37,757
This is ridiculous!

3814
04:03:37,987 --> 04:03:39,527
Li Yu,

3815
04:03:39,657 --> 04:03:42,567
tell us how you feel for the last time.

3816
04:03:48,067 --> 04:03:52,337
I've had my shortcomings...

3817
04:03:52,507 --> 04:03:54,207
- No! - No!

3818
04:03:54,807 --> 04:03:56,547
Until now,

3819
04:03:57,807 --> 04:04:00,117
but I want to thank you...

3820
04:04:00,747 --> 04:04:04,447
for doing your best to put me in tenth place.

3821
04:04:07,387 --> 04:04:12,427
In the last four months, I was very happy,

3822
04:04:13,357 --> 04:04:14,597
and I'm grateful for that.

3823
04:04:18,697 --> 04:04:20,367
Sadly,

3824
04:04:22,137 --> 04:04:23,867
I could not make my debut here, but...

3825
04:04:28,607 --> 04:04:31,706
I want to say that I'm sorry.

3826
04:04:31,707 --> 04:04:33,376
- No! - No!

3827
04:04:33,377 --> 04:04:34,946
You're my star!

3828
04:04:34,947 --> 04:04:36,286
(Chuei Li Yu)

3829
04:04:36,287 --> 04:04:38,186
Great job, Li Yu!

3830
04:04:38,187 --> 04:04:39,417
And Sang Hyeon.

3831
04:04:43,827 --> 04:04:44,927
Oh, no.

3832
04:04:45,187 --> 04:04:46,197
Sang Hyeon.

3833
04:04:47,057 --> 04:04:49,027
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

3834
04:04:55,167 --> 04:04:57,467
To everyone who came here to see me,

3835
04:05:00,107 --> 04:05:02,477
I'm sure you're...

3836
04:05:05,407 --> 04:05:06,876
more disappointed than I am.

3837
04:05:06,877 --> 04:05:08,417
- No, Li Yu! - No!

3838
04:05:11,687 --> 04:05:12,787
Cheer up!

3839
04:05:13,687 --> 04:05:14,787
Good work, Li Yu!

3840
04:05:15,487 --> 04:05:17,657
- You did great, Li Yu! - Cheer up!

3841
04:05:22,497 --> 04:05:23,827
I believe...

3842
04:05:25,097 --> 04:05:28,337
that I'll get to see you once again.

3843
04:05:31,537 --> 04:05:33,507
Thank you so much.

3844
04:05:34,607 --> 04:05:35,607
Thank you.

3845
04:05:36,347 --> 04:05:37,447
Good work!

3846
04:05:38,677 --> 04:05:39,717
Good job!

3847
04:05:44,247 --> 04:05:45,347
Yes.

3848
04:05:46,357 --> 04:05:49,957
Failing to keep your promise shouldn't make you apologetic.

3849
04:05:50,387 --> 04:05:53,156
The stories and time...

3850
04:05:53,157 --> 04:05:55,196
you shared with everyone...

3851
04:05:55,197 --> 04:05:57,527
that led up to the promise were beautiful.

3852
04:05:57,727 --> 04:06:01,196
All the audience members who are here...

3853
04:06:01,197 --> 04:06:05,637
and the Star Creators around the world...

3854
04:06:07,107 --> 04:06:09,577
have watched the journey and rooted for you.

3855
04:06:09,677 --> 04:06:12,546
So, there's no need to feel bad.

3856
04:06:12,547 --> 04:06:15,077
I sincerely thank you for your hard work.

3857
04:06:15,787 --> 04:06:17,816
Everyone, please give him a big round of applause.

3858
04:06:17,817 --> 04:06:19,317
(Chuei Li Yu, let's debut.)

3859
04:06:31,827 --> 04:06:32,837
Now comes...

3860
04:06:34,137 --> 04:06:38,107
the last member of ALPHA DRIVE ONE...

3861
04:06:38,837 --> 04:06:42,647
who took eighth place.

3862
04:06:43,247 --> 04:06:46,177
I will announce the eighth place.

3863
04:06:47,177 --> 04:06:53,986
(8th place)

3864
04:06:53,987 --> 04:07:00,796
(8th place)

3865
04:07:00,797 --> 04:07:06,266
(8th place)

3866
04:07:06,267 --> 04:07:08,097
Between Yoo Kang Min...

3867
04:07:08,197 --> 04:07:10,707
and Kim Jun Seo,

3868
04:07:11,367 --> 04:07:15,576
only one will debut...

3869
04:07:15,577 --> 04:07:19,077
as a member of ALPHA DRIVE ONE.

3870
04:07:35,697 --> 04:07:37,667
According to the final global voting results,

3871
04:07:38,267 --> 04:07:40,367
the difference between...

3872
04:07:40,567 --> 04:07:46,007
the 8th and 9th place was 308,289 points.

3873
04:07:46,107 --> 04:07:49,007
That difference determined the fate of a debut...

3874
04:07:50,007 --> 04:07:51,147
or an elimination.

3875
04:07:55,647 --> 04:07:57,417
Jun Seo, don't get timid!

3876
04:07:59,557 --> 04:08:02,586
Which 1 of the 2 members will be called...

3877
04:08:02,587 --> 04:08:04,557

It's this participant.

3882
04:08:26,947 --> 04:08:28,117

Now, only the eighth place...

3886

in the final Top Eight remains.

3887
04:09:24,537 --> 04:09:26,837

04:11:44,747 --> 04:11:48,617
Thus, Kim Jun Seo...

3904
04:11:49,447 --> 04:11:50,817

04:12:06,467 --> 04:12:08,837
Kim Jun Seo, congratulations.

3911
04:12:08,937 --> 04:12:10,607
Please come to the front.

3912
04:12:14,907 --> 04:12:17,177
He must've been very nervous.

3913
04:12:17,847 --> 04:12:20,817
The last debut member is Kim Jun Seo.

3914
04:12:21,417 --> 04:12:24,187
With his natural-born visuals, verified skills,

3915
04:12:24,287 --> 04:12:29,087
and sexy command on the stage no one else could copy,

3916
04:12:29,887 --> 04:12:32,157
Kim Jun Seo always spread light...

3917
04:12:32,257 --> 04:12:35,427
on the stage without a complaint.

3918
04:12:36,197 --> 04:12:38,027
Now, his light...

3919
04:12:38,327 --> 04:12:41,237
will become more brilliant with his debut.

3920
04:12:42,337 --> 04:12:46,577
Kim Jun Seo, congratulations on your debut.

3921
04:12:56,917 --> 04:13:00,887
Kim Jun Seo, you became the last member...

3922
04:13:01,917 --> 04:13:03,756
of ALPHA DRIVE ONE.

3923
04:13:03,757 --> 04:13:05,926
Your dream came true.

3924
04:13:05,927 --> 04:13:07,797
How does it feel right now?

3925
04:13:10,167 --> 04:13:17,736
(8th in Planet Top 8, Kim Jun Seo, 3,856,677 points)

3926
04:13:17,737 --> 04:13:20,977
When most of the names got called out,

3927
04:13:23,607 --> 04:13:24,776
I gave up...

3928
04:13:24,777 --> 04:13:28,847
and tried to let go of any expectations.

3929
04:13:31,647 --> 04:13:32,987
I'm so sorry.

3930
04:13:35,317 --> 04:13:36,387
I...

3931
04:13:38,287 --> 04:13:41,596
I shouldn't have given up for the Star Creators' sake.

3932
04:13:41,597 --> 04:13:44,966
I feel bad for having that thought...

3933
04:13:44,967 --> 04:13:46,467
even for a moment.

3934
04:13:50,537 --> 04:13:52,237
Rooting for me...

3935
04:13:54,877 --> 04:13:58,377
must've come with struggles.

3936
04:14:00,117 --> 04:14:01,217
To be honest,

3937
04:14:02,947 --> 04:14:05,647
this challenge scared me a lot.

3938
04:14:10,887 --> 04:14:13,097
To be honest, I felt fear more often than excitement.

3939
04:14:15,797 --> 04:14:20,496
Since the Star Creators are kind people,

3940
04:14:20,497 --> 04:14:21,897
I'm so happy.

3941
04:14:23,767 --> 04:14:27,877
I tried to think that I was happy even if I got eliminated.

3942
04:14:28,677 --> 04:14:32,177
Thank you so much for giving me this gift of a debut.

3943
04:14:45,627 --> 04:14:48,097
All right. Kim Jun Seo,

3944
04:14:48,727 --> 04:14:54,597
please say a few words to the family members...

3945
04:14:55,367 --> 04:14:56,936
who must be celebrating with you.

3946
04:14:56,937 --> 04:15:02,706
(Kim Jun Seo)

3947
04:15:02,707 --> 04:15:04,677
- They're here. - Yes.

3948
04:15:07,177 --> 04:15:08,217
Mom and Dad...

3949
04:15:10,687 --> 04:15:12,447
traveled all the way here from Ulsan...

3950
04:15:13,517 --> 04:15:15,487
to watch the final performance.

3951
04:15:17,957 --> 04:15:19,027
I...

3952
04:15:20,797 --> 04:15:22,427
debuted and worked...

3953
04:15:22,967 --> 04:15:25,067
as an idol for a while.

3954
04:15:27,767 --> 04:15:31,567
Then came this second challenge.

3955
04:15:33,877 --> 04:15:35,007
Without complaining,

3956
04:15:35,507 --> 04:15:37,807
they told me that they supported me for my new challenge.

3957
04:15:38,677 --> 04:15:41,646
I thank Mom and Dad from the bottom of my heart.

3958
04:15:41,647 --> 04:15:43,687
(Kim Jun Seo)

3959
04:15:49,257 --> 04:15:51,427
Tell them, "I love you."

3960
04:15:52,527 --> 04:15:53,697
I love you.

3961
04:15:58,797 --> 04:16:00,867
Sir, please show him a heart.

3962
04:16:01,067 --> 04:16:02,767
Thank you.

3963
04:16:04,137 --> 04:16:06,107
Congratulations. All right.

3964
04:16:07,337 --> 04:16:09,336
Kim Jun Seo, congratulations again...

3965
04:16:09,337 --> 04:16:12,977
on becoming a member of ALPHA DRIVE ONE.

3966
04:16:17,587 --> 04:16:21,787
Now, please take the seat for 8th place in the final Top 8.

3967
04:16:24,157 --> 04:16:26,327
Turn around. Yes.

3968
04:16:28,997 --> 04:16:32,096
Whenever Kim Jun Seo took the stage,

3969
04:16:32,097 --> 04:16:35,266
he captivated people's attention with his unrivaled visual...

3970
04:16:35,267 --> 04:16:36,907
and seasoned stage manners.

3971
04:16:37,337 --> 04:16:40,306
He pulled off every genre with his unique colors.

3972
04:16:40,307 --> 04:16:41,787
His past experiences came together...

3973
04:16:42,037 --> 04:16:45,177
and put him where he is now.

3974
04:16:45,507 --> 04:16:49,176
I hope he'll show his unique light on various stages...

3975
04:16:49,177 --> 04:16:53,616
as a member of ALPHA DRIVE ONE from now on.

3976
04:16:53,617 --> 04:16:55,717
Congratulations on your debut.

3977
04:17:02,827 --> 04:17:06,897
(Kim Jun Seo)

3978
04:17:18,307 --> 04:17:19,447
Now,

3979
04:17:20,847 --> 04:17:22,946
members whose debut has been finalized,

3980
04:17:22,947 --> 04:17:24,287
please take a seat.

3981
04:17:26,787 --> 04:17:28,287
Congratulations.

3982
04:17:30,727 --> 04:17:32,787
Thank you for your hard work!

3983
04:17:33,697 --> 04:17:38,327
And it's quite unfortunate.

3984
04:17:38,997 --> 04:17:41,267
On the very brink...

3985
04:17:41,397 --> 04:17:43,207
of the debut.

3986
04:17:45,637 --> 04:17:49,947
Yoo Kang Min took ninth place and got eliminated.

3987
04:17:50,977 --> 04:17:52,776
(9th place, Yoo Kang Min)

3988
04:17:52,777 --> 04:17:57,017
Seriously. Everyone, please give him a big hand.

3989
04:17:58,987 --> 04:18:04,227
You must be more disappointed than anyone.

3990
04:18:05,257 --> 04:18:08,927
Yoo Kang Min, please say a few parting words.

3991
04:18:09,197 --> 04:18:11,397
Well, firstly,

3992
04:18:12,297 --> 04:18:15,267
I know how much Jun Seo has struggled.

3993
04:18:15,897 --> 04:18:17,907
So, I'm really happy for him.

3994
04:18:19,007 --> 04:18:20,807
Firstly...

3995
04:18:23,277 --> 04:18:26,717
My heart feels very light.

3996
04:18:26,847 --> 04:18:32,247
(Yoo Kang Min, I love you.)

3997
04:18:33,217 --> 04:18:34,987
All 160 participants...

3998
04:18:36,087 --> 04:18:37,957
competed with seriousness.

3999
04:18:39,627 --> 04:18:43,097
They made each performance cool.

4000
04:18:43,527 --> 04:18:46,997
I think that knowledge brings tears to my eyes.

4001
04:18:47,597 --> 04:18:48,737
Well...

4002
04:18:52,437 --> 04:18:55,277
My teammates who rooted for me...

4003
04:18:55,307 --> 04:18:56,547
even after they got eliminated,

4004
04:18:56,947 --> 04:18:59,007
thank you so much.

4005
04:18:59,877 --> 04:19:04,587
Li Zi Hao, Yun Seo, and others.

4006
04:19:05,887 --> 04:19:10,257
Everyone, thank you so much.

4007
04:19:11,987 --> 04:19:14,957
And Mom and Dad.

4008
04:19:16,997 --> 04:19:21,766
(Kang Min)

4009
04:19:21,767 --> 04:19:27,506
(Kang Min)

4010
04:19:27,507 --> 04:19:28,577
I love you guys.

4011
04:19:29,737 --> 04:19:32,407
You know that I rarely say this, right?

4012
04:19:36,117 --> 04:19:40,387
And Star Creators who rooted for me with sincerity...

4013
04:19:41,887 --> 04:19:46,326
until the very end, thank you so much.

4014
04:19:46,327 --> 04:19:47,997
Thank you so much.

4015
04:19:49,967 --> 04:19:54,737
I'll work even harder from now on. Thank you.

4016
04:19:59,337 --> 04:20:02,907
This isn't the end. I sincerely hope that you'll do your best...

4017
04:20:03,307 --> 04:20:06,077
without giving up until the end...

4018
04:20:07,377 --> 04:20:11,247
so that you can realize your dream.

4019
04:20:23,897 --> 04:20:27,837
All right. For the debut of a global K-pop boy group,

4020
04:20:27,967 --> 04:20:31,537
BOYS II PLANET has pulled through until the end.

4021
04:20:31,937 --> 04:20:36,507
Eight participants who were chosen by the Star Creators...

4022
04:20:36,847 --> 04:20:39,247
around the world,

4023
04:20:40,017 --> 04:20:43,817

Final Top 8 members,

4026
04:20:55,757 --> 04:20:58,697
please get up from your seat.

4027
04:21:11,207 --> 04:21:14,547
Now, the rankings won't be important.

4028
04:21:14,817 --> 04:21:18,017
The members whose names got called won't be separate entities.

4029
04:21:18,187 --> 04:21:21,117
They'll debut as a group.

4030
04:21:21,887 --> 04:21:25,357
The Star Creators made...

4031
04:21:25,857 --> 04:21:29,697
one team that'll breathe and grow together,

4032
04:21:30,727 --> 04:21:32,597
