1
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,190
(4 new songs were performed for BOYS II PLANET's semi-finals.)

2
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,419
It begins now.

3
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,490
("Sugar HIGH" showed the essence of refreshing charms.)

4
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,900
("MAIN DISH" showed explosive energy.)

5
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,500
("Lucky MACHO" showed the power of manly men.)

6
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,000
("Chains" showed an overload of sexiness.)

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,300
("Chains": 1,110 points, 1st place)

8
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,409
("Chains" took 1st place at the Debut Concept Battle.)

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,180
(There will be a big announcement.)

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,640
(A big announcement?)

11
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,349
(The first big announcement)

12
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,449
(Hold on a second.)

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,820
(In just 10 hours!)

14
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,949
(Which new participant entered the Top 8 right before the finals?)

15
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:46,950
Who could it be?

16
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:48,119
(This is insane.)

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,120
(I'm nervous.)

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,120
(I hope it's me.)

19
00:00:50,121 --> 00:00:51,690
(The ranking is revealed in a new way.)

20
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,459
(- Over 10 rankings. - He moved up 12 rankings.)

21
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,089
(Which participant moved up and joined the debut rankings?)

22
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,959
(The participant who moved up 14 rankings...)

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,230
(is...)

24
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,539
(I'm very upset.)

25
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,840
(Is that what An Xin is like?)

26
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,609
(Kissing)

27
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,610
Look at them.

28
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:10,140
(Why don't you use this opportunity...)

29
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,010
(A sudden kiss)

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,549
(Do you like me that much?)

31
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,550
(Do you?)

32
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,780
(Hold on a second.)

33
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,650
(I'm a bit like...)

34
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,520
(I can't control myself.)

35
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,789
(They kiss and hug.)

36
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,529
(Will the secrets of Planet Camp be revealed?)

37
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,260
(Also, the final mission begins.)

38
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,459
(For the final mission, )

39
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,700
(you can push off the participant behind the part.)

40
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,399
(The part distribution is fierce until the very end.)

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,899
(They want to keep the part even if they must kneel.)

42
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,610
(I can hear everyone racking their brains.)

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,840
(I won't do it.)

44
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,840
(Come to your senses.)

45
00:01:43,841 --> 00:01:44,909
(This is the final performance.)

46
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,150
- Come on. - Seriously, why?

47
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,479
(The atmosphere is terrible.)

48
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,949
(They fought too much.)

49
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,789
(Can't you hear them fighting?)

50
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,520
(Shouldn't we go and stop them?)

51
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,990
Stop it!

52
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,490
(Hey, how could you swear like that?)

53
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,729
Seriously, you...

54
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,930
(This will be the last performance, so we should be amicable.)

55
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,649
(After the Debut Concept Battle, )

56
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,850
(Planet Camp)

57
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,520
- Well done. - My goodness.

58
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,520
- Well done, bro. - You did well.

59
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,890
I'm becoming ambitious.

60
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,890
I hope this performance won't be my last one.

61
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,660
It won't be.

62
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,760
- Let's survive. - Let's go.

63
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,160
We'll come back here.

64
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,029
"Sugar HIGH!"

65
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,030
Go ahead.

66
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:43,199
(Promising that they'll come back, they leave the Planet Camp.)

67
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,640
We'll be back!

68
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,309
(The participants are practicing at the Planet Camp.)

69
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,710
(The participants have left the Planet Camp.)

70
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,949
(The participants leave the Planet Camp...)

71
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,019
(and go back to their daily lives.)

72
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,080
I'm going to school.

73
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,020
(They enjoy their hobbies and meet people who are precious to them.)

74
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,329
(They recharge their energy.)

75
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,989
I'll read comic books.

76
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,500
(They recharge their energy.)

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,430
Say hello.

78
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,070
Hello.

79
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,069
(Hello!)

80
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,500
I'm at a dog cafe with Taeyang.

81
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Ta-da!

82
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,940
Play with me.

83
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
My goodness.

84
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,880
How could you keep peeing in front of the camera?

85
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,250
You shouldn't pee in public places, Taeyang.

86
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,820
(I won't listen to you, okay?)

87
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,550
I think this vlog is ruined.

88
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,430
(Kim Geon Woo meets up with his friends of 10 years.)

89
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,990
Geon Woo likes baseball.

90
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,460
He's doing something useless again.

91
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,970
He jokes around a lot.

92
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,130
I'll show you a curveball.

93
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,340
A curveball?

94
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,969
It didn't curve.

95
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:55,970
(He failed to throw a curveball.)

96
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,640
I arrived at the home stadium of KIA Tigers,

97
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,450
the Gwangju-KIA Champions Field.

98
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,480
Look.

99
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,920
We brought tasty food as well.

100
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,089
- Strike! - Good.

101
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,620
(I'm so excited.)

102
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,520
Wasn't it similar to my pitch?

103
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,429
Three strikes.

104
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,429
(He focuses on the baseball match.)

105
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,130
- KIA's Park Chan Ho - KIA's Park Chan Ho

106
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,729
(Kim Geon Woo had a fun time with his friends...)

107
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,000
(until late at night.)

108
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,869
He's my friend from my hometown. Say hello.

109
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,970
(Kim Jun Seo meets his friend from his hometown.)

110
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,680
I'm visiting the World Cup Park for the first time in a while.

111
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,780
I've always come here...

112
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,910
whenever I felt caged and wanted some fresh air.

113
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,380
It was very nice to walk along this path.

114
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,250
The sunset is very pretty now.

115
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,189
(Here's another person who is enjoying a stroll.)

116
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,230
It's really nice.

117
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,430
I came to the Han River to have ramyeon and a beverage.

118
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,530
I'll go home after I rest for a bit. Yes.

119
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,900
(Eating ramyeon is a must when you're at the Han River.)

120
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,670
I'll go and cook ramyeon now.

121
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,479
(He goes to cook ramyeon...)

122
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,050
(or not.)

123
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:12,120
There's a reason why I'm filming here.

124
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,250
There are too many people.

125
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,589
So...

126
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,090
It's better to stay far away.

127
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,819
(Anxious)

128
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,530
I want to stand out on the stage,

129
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,200
but I want to live...

130
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,100
without any presence like air in everyday life.

131
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,940
(Shy)

132
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,210
(So, he only ate ramyeon like air.)

133
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:42,680
(The participants recharge with their own comfort food.)

134
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,620
(Nom)

135
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,890
Sweet food gives me energy.

136
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,660
We used this for our performance.

137
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,860
It's our precious cake.

138
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,459
(Feeling good after eating a piece of cake)

139
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,560
This is insane.

140
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,169
I'm about to go and get something to eat.

141
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,170
That's right.

142
00:06:04,171 --> 00:06:06,140
Who are these people next to me?

143
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,840
Hi. I'm Kamden.

144
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,639
(Li Yu met Kamden, Brian, and Jiho of AMPERS and ONE...)

145
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,950
(from "BOYS PLANET.")

146
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,749
How was the final round?

147
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,679
(Kamden made it to the Final Live Show on "BOYS PLANET.")

148
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,750
It's just different.

149
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,659
You'll never be able to feel that your entire life.

150
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,620
Even now,

151
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,560
I'm grateful for that.

152
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,829
(I see.)

153
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,130
You're still reserved.

154
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,099
I thought being on TV would have...

155
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,800
- I know. - made him talkative.

156
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,610
- I thought he would change. - I thought so too.

157
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,040
It's been a while, guys.

158
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,349
Just do it.

159
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,849
(Laughing)

160
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,919
To root for our baby,

161
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,849
we came to a hot pot place.

162
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,549
I looked this place up. Do you like it?

163
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,550
I love it.

164
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,460
- Yes! - It looks delicious, right?

165
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,890
- The performances I liked were... - Yes.

166
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,199
"Breathe" and "XXL."

167
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,859
- "XXL." Really? - Yes.

168
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,199
- You must have liked it. - I'll make sure to tell them.

169
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,969
- When you see them. - I'll tell them.

170
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,999
But he hates singing cute songs.

171
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,569
- Yun Seo? - Like Kang Min in the past.

172
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,699
- Yes, like Kang Min in the past. - Yes.

173
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,839
- Yun Seo reminds me of my past. - Yes. He's cute.

174
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,210
A kid who's better than me.

175
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,280
Hi.

176
00:07:20,281 --> 00:07:22,609
(Yun Seo is back at school.)

177
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,720
- Hi. - What are you doing? It's mine!

178
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,190
This is my camera.

179
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,450
- Say hi. - Hi.

180
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,489
This is going on TV.

181
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,990
But they'll edit it out.

182
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,229
I know it.

183
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,900
- What's this? - I'm filming a v-log.

184
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,100
This is going on TV.

185
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,569
His name is also Lee Sang Won. Tell them.

186
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,429
- Yes, Sang Won. - I'm embarrassed.

187
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,839
His name is Lee Sang Won.

188
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,340
I'm Lee Sang Won, and you're Lee Sang Won.

189
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,040
Are you out of your mind?

190
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,139
Apologize.

191
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,380
I didn't mean to. I know Sang Won is older.

192
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,220
(It's all right, little Sang Won.)

193
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,790
Fourth period...

194
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,389
Give me an autograph.

195
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,559
On both arms.

196
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,860
(Everyone asks him for his autograph.)

197
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,630
But Yun Seo...

198
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,659
- Me too. - Me too!

199
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,260
- I'm next. - You wrote it on his shirt?

200
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,460
Hey, Yun Seo.

201
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,669
I'm done.

202
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,929
(He signed 100 autographs.)

203
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,440
(Ching Yu is walking alone.)

204
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,210
There's Yumeki.

205
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,079
Yumeki.

206
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,280
I'm a fan!

207
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,850
- Hi. I met some fans. - Hello.

208
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,850
I love you, Ching Yu.

209
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,559
In 1, 2, 3.

210
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,920
(A photo to remember this moment)

211
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,490
(By the way, what's Yumeki doing?)

212
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:47,770
(He went to the concert for "World of Street Woman Fighter.")

213
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,109
- It's Lee Jung. - Hi, I'm Lee Jung.

214
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,409
(Yumeki caught up with some friends.)

215
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,180
(Dancer Junna)

216
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,910
This is Noze from BUMSUP.

217
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,149
Please root for Yumeki!

218
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,150
Thank you!

219
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:08,890
He's so kind and a good dancer!

220
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,989
(Where did Sang Won go?)

221
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,890
I'm visiting GRID Entertainment.

222
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,159
(Who's welcoming Sang Won?)

223
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,400
Good afternoon.

224
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,199
What's this? Are you filming?

225
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,870
- What is it? - Are you filming?

226
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,140
(POW is a multinational boy group with youthful vibes.)

227
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,510
- Hello. - Hello.

228
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,239
- I'm Yorch from POW. - I'm Hong from POW.

229
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,880
This is kind of...

230
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,610
You killed it with that performance.

231
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,349
Which one?

232
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,220
I watched all of them. "like JENNIE."

233
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,190
(Sang Won performed the killing part in "like JENNIE.")

234
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,260
- Oh, "like JENNIE." - And "Whiplash."

235
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,260
(Their "Whiplash" video got over 2.5 million views.)

236
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,730
"Whiplash" is my favorite.

237
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,029
- "Whiplash?" - Yes.

238
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,169
(Feeling good)

239
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,600
Yorch, you too.

240
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,269
(Awkward)

241
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,270
Say anything.

242
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:01,840
He's always doing great out there.

243
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,410
I'm rooting for you. Keep it up.

244
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,850
Let's go.

245
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,450
I have a book of poems by Na Tae Joo.

246
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,550
I'll spend some alone time.

247
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,360
(He was always reading a book at the Planet Camp.)

248
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,299
(This literary boy reads even during his break.)

249
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,860
I'm here to buy a book of poetry today.

250
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,200
A book of poetry to bring to my final camp.

251
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,169
I'm going to carefully pick one.

252
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,200
(He discreetly picks one.)

253
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,009
I'll go and find a book.

254
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,469
(Leo is also buying a book.)

255
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,610
I wanted to read a novel in English.

256
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,349
(But he's more interested in toys.)

257
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,480
Is this chocolate?

258
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,349
(He spent most of the time looking at toys.)

259
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,760
The sound is so satisfying.

260
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,390
(Meanwhile, Jun Min is at home.)

261
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,490
I rarely go outside,

262
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,160
so I'll read some comic books.

263
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,740
(You can only hear him going through the pages.)

264
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,739
Why were you late?

265
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,740
(Who is Dong Gyu meeting?)

266
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,080
Let's order our food first.

267
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,150
(You must get a close-up shot before eating.)

268
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,519
- First impression? - First impression of you?

269
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,750
If I'm being honest, I thought you were older than me.

270
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,219
(He's 1 year younger.)

271
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,889
(Dying of laughter)

272
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,619
It means that you look mature.

273
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,559
You were doing great until just now.

274
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,560
(Looking like true friends)

275
00:11:29,561 --> 00:11:31,860
- A word of encouragement. - Encouragement?

276
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,000
This time, I hope you don't end up on the triple split screen.

277
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,599
(He doesn't want to recall that moment.)

278
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,739
I hope you advance without hardships.

279
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,769
I sincerely root for you.

280
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,539
(A wholesome ending?)

281
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,549
(It never is.)

282
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,910
Hello.

283
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,250
We meet again.

284
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,550
Xue Su Ren and Li Zi Hao.

285
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,360
What are we doing today? We're going on a date.

286
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,060
What are you talking about?

287
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,089
How do you feel about the new mission?

288
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,259
It's so hard and exhausting.

289
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:10,129
I'm not sure if I'll make it to the Final Live Show.

290
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,300
You will. You have to.

291
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,969
(They stop talking about serious things...)

292
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,970
(and relieve stress by playing video games.)

293
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,840
(After playing video games...)

294
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,679
It's getting late. We need to go home.

295
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,750
We should.

296
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,750
- Good night, everyone. - Good night.

297
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,850
- Bye. - Bye.

298
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,560
(1 day to the Survivor Announcement)

299
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,460
This is the night before finding out...

300
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,060
if I'll get the chance to move on to the Final Live Show.

301
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,800
This is the guitar I always bring.

302
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,569
For the last camp,

303
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,100
I bought some clothes.

304
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,470
I hope I get to wear them.

305
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,149
If I survive in the Survivor Announcement,

306
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,080
I'll advance to the Final Live Show.

307
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,849
I want to thank all the Star Creators...

308
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,220
who have been supporting me.

309
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,750
I never expected it at the time.

310
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,190
I never knew this many fans...

311
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,589
would love and support me.

312
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,260
I appreciate it.

313
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,060
I won't cry this time.

314
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,740
If I cry, the Star Creators will also be upset.

315
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,640
I want to smile as much as possible in front of you.

316
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,470
I'm so worried.

317
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:27,380
From the First Survivor Announcement to now,

318
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,920
my ranking has been going down.

319
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,089
I've come a long way. I got to the Semi-finals.

320
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,660
I hope I make it to the Final Live Show.

321
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,130
I want to make it to the Final Live Show.

322
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,630
One last round. Gosh.

323
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:47,930
I've come such a long way.

324
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,970
I wish I could make it to the Final Live Show.

325
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,940
(The day of the Survivor Announcement)

326
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,909
(They're more desperate than ever...)

327
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,720
(for the Third Survivor Announcement.)

328
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,549
(Who are the 16 of the 24 participants...)

329
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,690
(to reach the Final Live Show?)

330
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,560
(The Top 8 are one step closer to making their debut.)

331
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,090
(And who will be the last suvivor in 16th place?)

332
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,860
(The 3rd Survivor Announcement)

333
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,030
(Which team will enter first?)

334
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,970
(It's Team "Chains" that deserves 3 Michelin stars.)

335
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,669
(They hit a million views in only 3 days after the upload...)

336
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,839
(and proved how fancy their performance was.)

337
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,180
(1,085,015 views)

338
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,009
(Smiling)

339
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,850
An Xin, there aren't many seats left.

340
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,220
I'm so worried.

341
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,990
It's all right. You have me.

342
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,519
Don't worry.

343
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,920
- Don't worry! - Don't worry!

344
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,829
Team "Chains" has gone through so much.

345
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,160
We have.

346
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,130
- Should we hug it out first? - Sure.

347
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,270
(What's happening?)

348
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,770
(Let's hug instead of doing a chant.)

349
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,649
(No, I said, "Hug," not "Sit.")

350
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,880
(Embarrassed)

351
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,550
(It's embarrassing to think about again.)

352
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:18,890
- Love is? - Team "Chains!"

353
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,659
Hey, Yumeki.

354
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,689
- Xin Long. - Yes.

355
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,289
The announcement is today. But we're running late.

356
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,330
Let's hurry.

357
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,630
Vroom. Let's go.

358
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,370
(They're pretty good.)

359
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,570
(They're followed by Park Dong Gyu, the Motorcycle.)

360
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,170
Everyone is hitching a ride here.

361
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,440
Let's go.

362
00:15:35,441 --> 00:15:36,770
(The last motorcycle sets out too.)

363
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,510
- "Lucky MACHO." - "Lucky MACHO."

364
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,150
(We're sexy machos.)

365
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,250
- Gosh. All right. - Oh, my.

366
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,689
Gosh, what are you talking about?

367
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,950
(Furious Kang Min takes over.)

368
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,359
He might punch me or something if I were to approach him.

369
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,660
How are you going to defeat Furious Kang Min?

370
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,830
(Furious Kang Min crushes the killing part.)

371
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,470
I'm Yoo Kang Min,

372
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,639
Ching Yu, could you teach me one dance move?

373
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,079
- I'll teach you a cool move then. - Show me. Okay.

374
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,180
Okay.

375
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,310
He's so good.

376
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,549
Let me try to copy you.

377
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,720
(How good is Sun Heng Yu at dancing?)

378
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,649
(Awkwardly moving his limbs)

379
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,420
He looks like a giraffe with super thin legs.

380
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,889
(Get out of our way, we're the main dish)

381
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,199
(Chomping)

382
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,460
We'll enjoy the dish.

383
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,630
It's the last team.

384
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,840
- Hey, are you craving anything? - Yes.

385
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What am I craving?

386
00:16:39,001 --> 00:16:40,969
I hear oysters are in season these days.

387
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:41,970
Oysters?

388
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,639
What's going on?

389
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,679
(Oysters are in season from October to March.)

390
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,879
- Our oyster-bright faces. - Our oyster-bright faces.

391
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,110
(Their faces are in season all year round.)

392
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,319
That's cute.

393
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,320
(So cute)

394
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,549
- We're Team Kitty Kisses. - We're Team Kitty Kisses.

395
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,190
- Meow. - Meow.

396
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,220
They're cute.

397
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,660
(Kitty)

398
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,260
(Kisses)

399
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,100
Look at these cuties.

400
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,130
(I can be a kitty too.)

401
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,540
(All 24 participants have entered.)

402
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,839
Who's the Planet Master?

403
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,740
I wonder where the Master will come out from this time.

404
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,209
- From the sky. - From the sky?

405
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,920
- That's cute. - Planet Master.

406
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,050
(Contrary to their expectation, the Planet Master walks out.)

407
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,460
(Getting up)

408
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,800
It's Baekho.

409
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,960
(He appeared as a special Master...)

410
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,700
(Master Baekho gave heartfelt advice to Yoo Kang Min.)

411
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,139
Hello, Star Creators.

412
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,510
I'm Planet Master Baekho.

413
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,240
He's so cool.

414
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,250
A familiar face.

415
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:00,249
During the third mission, the Debut Concept Battle,

416
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,790
the fourth global voting was held.

417
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,859
Once again, the Star Creators from all over the world...

418
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,930
showed us overwhelming support.

419
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:13,460
The fourth global voting recorded an impressive total...

420
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,599
of 32,520,432 votes...

421
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,740
from 213 countries.

422
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,310
Gosh, 30 million votes.

423
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,509
In the last season's 15-day penultimate global voting,

424
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,249
a total of 1.49 million people participated.

425
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,779
This season's penultimate...

426
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,949
global voting was held for eight days.

427
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:37,020
A total of 2.42 million Star Creators participated.

428
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,759
- Thank you. - Thank you.

429
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,589
- Thank you. - Thank you.

430
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,630
- Thank you. - Thank you.

431
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,289
As for the third mission, unlike the previous missions,

432
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,659
the participants performed new songs produced and choreographed...

433
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,830
by top industry professionals.

434
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,069
As a result, the Star Creators in the audience...

435
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,569
voted Team "Chains" as first place.

436
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:59,580
Everyone on the team received 150,000 points as the benefit.

437
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,209
Lee Sang Won received...

438
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:04,820
the highest individual score on Team "Chains."

439
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,080
He acquired an additional 150,000 points.

440
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,359
He obtained a total of 300,000 points as his benefits.

441
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,819
- My gosh. - Good for him.

442
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,960
- Oh, how I envy him. - Good for him.

443
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:18,330
The survivors will be determined solely by the votes...

444
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,099
of the Star Creators...

445
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,069
by ranking the 24 participants...

446
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,899
from 1st to 16th places.

447
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,670
Then the rest of the eight participants...

448
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,340
from 17th to 24th places will be eliminated.

449
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,240
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

450
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,240
What a pity.

451
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,879
The competition for rankings remained intense...

452
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,250
right up to the final moment.

453
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,480
As a result,

454
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,520
there has been the most shocking change...

455
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,190
Really?

456
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,520
The results were always shocking for me.

457
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,660
A new participant managed to break into the Top Eight...

458
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,600
by pushing one of the participants out of the circle.

459
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,699
Gosh, I wonder who that is.

460
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,339
I daresay this could be the wildest twist yet.

461
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,779
And which 16 participants...

462
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,309
will be able to survive these crazy ranking changes...

463
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,580
and perform live for the final battle?

464
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,580
I don't know what to expect.

465
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,920
And who will be in the third group...

466
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,160
of the Top Eight participants...

467
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,360
This is the Third Survivor Announcement...

468
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:32,770
Tonight, the final 16 participants will be revealed.

469
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,610
My heart is starting to ache again.

470
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,740
But before that,

471
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,009
there will be an important announcement...

472
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,510
during the Third Survivor Announcement.

473
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,820
What?

474
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,550
(The first important announcement)

475
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,950
What's going on?

476
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,290
The first important announcement?

477
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,590
I'm nervous.

478
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,719
After tonight's Survivor Announcement,

479
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,490
you will be given a mission.

480
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,130
- The final mission. - The final mission.

481
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,430
During the first important announcement,

482
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,729
you will get to listen to...

483
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,670
new songs for the final mission in advance.

484
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,639
(First Listen of New Songs for the Final Mission)

485
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,640
- Hold on. Just like that? - Now?

486
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,780
- Now? We'll listen to them now? - Just like that?

487
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,150
- I'm so curious. - Gosh.

488
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,310
The title of the first song for the final mission...

489
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,250
I can't wait to find out.

490
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,519
("Brat Attitude")

491
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,119
- It's "Brat Attitude." - "Brat Attitude."

492
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,989
- "Brat Attitude." - "Brat Attitude."

493
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,889
- That sounds like an intense song. - Brat.

494
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,390
- I feel like this one is for me. - Brat.

495
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,860
(Exclusive first listen of "Brat Attitude")

496
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,499
(With powerful beats blending hip-hop and EDM, )

497
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,699
(the new song expresses the determination...)

498
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,839
(to pave one's own path.)

499
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,900
Gosh, I want this song.

500
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,110
This song reminds me of Jun Min.

501
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,780
It's straight-up hip-hop.

502
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,450
I want to listen to it a little more.

503
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,980
I want to sing a powerful song like this.

504
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:59,490
Next, I'll reveal the second song for the final mission.

505
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,289
("Never Been 2 Heaven")

506
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,860
- "Never Been 2 Heaven." - "Never Been 2 Heaven."

507
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,430
It's "Never Been 2 Heaven."

508
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,100
The title sounds cool.

509
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,169
Titles sound cool when they have "never" in them.

510
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,770
The title sounds unusual.

511
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,369
(Exclusive first listen of "Never Been 2 Heaven")

512
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,969
(Funky beats paired with lively vocals and rap convey...)

513
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,039
This song sounds vibrant.

514
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,139
(the excitement of dreaming youth and their radiant moments.)

515
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,310
It sounds like a song for a fifth-generation idol group.

516
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,580
This is a great song.

517
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,880
- Nice. - It's a great song.

518
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,350
I like this song.

519
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,650
I like both songs.

520
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,860
I like both.

521
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,760
I'll continue with the second important announcement.

522
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,829
(The second important announcement)

523
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,860
I wonder what it is.

524
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,960
There can't be a redemption round, right?

525
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,000
What's the most important aspect of a group that's soon to debut?

526
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,700
Is it the name? No way.

527
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,070
- What? Is it the name of the group? - Yes.

528
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,580
- Will they reveal the name now? - No way.

529
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,280
It's the name.

530
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,980
- I was right. - Now?

531
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,550
Hold on. This is it?

532
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,150
Without further ado,

533
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,219
the name of the debut group...

534
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,520
- The name? For real? - For real?

535
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,259
(A hint will be given for the name of the debut group.)

536
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,699
I'll give you a hint.

537
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,160
(Hint for the Debut Group's Name)

538
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,370
He got me.

539
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,940
- Gosh. You can't do that. - He got me.

540
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:21,970
I wonder what it is.

541
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,469
Usually, the name includes "one."

542
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,610
Right. That will be in the name for sure.

543
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,079
(During the 1st season, )

544
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:36,750
(the name of the debut group included the word, "one.")

545
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,760
- I bet it will include "one." - Or...

546
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,429
Max One?

547
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,430
One Base One.

548
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:44,800
Alpha Two One.

549
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,360
One Two Three Four One.

550
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,170
What?

551
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,200
- There it is. - What? That's us.

552
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,669
- Planets K and C. - I don't know.

553
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,240
- Alpha... - "HOLA SOLAR?"

554
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,980
- Hold on. - Hold on.

555
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,420
Is it a seven-syllable name with "one" in the end?

556
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,389
I guess the last syllable is "one."

557
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,720
It has to be "one."

558
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,490
It's... What was that?

559
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,130
- Where... - It's... What was that?

560
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,300
What?

561
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,629
What's going on? What is this?

562
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:26,540
(All of a sudden, the letters begins to jumble.)

563
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,440
- What? - Wait. This is it?

564
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,809
I see. The letters are included in the name.

565
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,179
But the order doesn't matter...

566
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,540
- in my opinion. - I see. It's not in order.

567
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,579
- I think "alpha" is in there. - Alpha.

568
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,950
- "Alpha" has to be a part of it. - Alpha.

569
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,949
As for the two new songs for the final mission...

570
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,750
and the name of the debut group,

571
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,659
stay tuned and find out during the live broadcast...

572
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,329
on Thursday, September 25.

573
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,430
(They will be revealed on Thursday, September 25 at 8pm.)

574
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,029
All right. The Third Survivor Announcement...

575
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,470
of BOYS II PLANET...

576
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,770
will begin now.

577
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,170
- Let's go. - Let's go.

578
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,710
This is the fourth one.

579
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,149
(What will happen to the participants?)

580
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,650
Let's do this.

581
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,350
(At the Third Survivor Announcement)

582
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,790
The ranking of the first survivor to be called is...

583
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,530
Suddenly, I'm nervous.

584
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,860
Gosh, it's nerve-racking.

585
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,930
It's 15th place.

586
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,470
Wait a minute.

587
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,040
I can't wait to find out.

588
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,400
Who could it be?

589
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,110
I can't wait to find out who it is.

590
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,040
I hope that it's me.

591
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,479
Lee Jeong, you definitely ranked higher than that.

592
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,049
No, I'm sure that I'm 1 of the 3.

593
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:44,780
You'll get a benefit.

594
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:46,750
Could it be Zhang Jia Hao?

595
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,350
It must be Hao.

596
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,390
(22nd, Yumeki)

597
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,060
The participant in 15th place has placed 1st...

598
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:57,990
in the individual ranking...

599
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,330
based on the on-site...

600
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,530
Star Creators' average score after a performance.

601
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,640
Last time, I placed last.

602
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,340
Is it Jun Min?

603
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,410
Is it me?

604
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,710
(Kim Jun Min, 1,850 points)

605
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,139
(Within "Lucky MACHO" Team, )

606
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,480
(Kim Jun Min placed 1st.)

607
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,110
(Yoo Kang Min, 1,930 points)

608
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,420
(Yoo Kang Min also placed 1st on "MAIN DISH" Team.)

609
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,150
(The 1 who placed 1st individually is a candidate for 15th place?)

610
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,390
There are too many who have placed first.

611
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,889
Have I placed first before? No.

612
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,429
You placed first after performing "XXL."

613
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:33,330
(1st place)

614
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,460
You're right.

615
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,570
Also, on Planet Camp,

616
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,670
he's been in two-person room,

617
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,570
four-person room,

618
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,910
and six-person room.

619
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,880
- That's not me. - Me neither.

620
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,410
Oh, that's me.

621
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,179
(During practice for Signal Song)

622
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,620
(He was in 2 Star 4-person room.)

623
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,750
(During the 1st mission, he was in 1 Star 6-person room.)

624
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,560
(Currently, Jun Lee Jeong is in All Star 2-person room.)

625
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,430
It's me.

626
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,860
There are Lee Jeong and me.

627
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,299
Us three?

628
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,360
(The candidates are narrowed down to three.)

629
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,099
The first survivor to advance...

630
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,030
to the final round.

631
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,340
(Jang Han Eum 14th, Chung Sang Hyeon 6th, Jun Lee Jeong 12th)

632
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,910
It's Jun Lee Jeong.

633
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,740
(Jun Lee Jeong survives in 15th place.)

634
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,480
Let's go.

635
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,450
That's a relief.

636
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,780
Lee Jeong survived.

637
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,349
(Based on Semi-finals New Song Streaming Evaluation...)

638
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,549
(as of September 12, 2025)

639
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,149
(Team "Chains" earned 13,000 benefit points.)

640
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,159
Well done.

641
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,619
As for Jun Lee Jeong,

642
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,189
without the benefit,

643
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,260
he couldn't have joined the final performance.

644
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,460
("Chains" in 1st place)

645
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,729
(Jun Lee Jeong earned 150,000 points...)

646
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:42,930
(as his team placed 1st.)

647
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:49,310
Until the end, we're reminded of the importance of the benefit.

648
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,569
Congratulations, Jun Lee Jeong.

649
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,910
(Jun Lee Jeong, 15th, 2,516,524 points)

650
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,809
For 15th and 16th place, having the benefit or not...

651
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,180
The difference is huge.

652
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,250
I'd like to say...

653
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,260
that I was very encouraged by those who cheered for me.

654
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:06,690
Thank you.

655
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,700
See you later, Jun Min.

656
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,240
Will I be able to make it?

657
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:29,850
Of course you will.

658
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,650
Don't be discouraged.

659
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,020
You'll make it.

660
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,990
This is so difficult.

661
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,519
Following Jun Lee Jeong is...

662
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,060
the 1 in 14th place...

663
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:47,060
who will advance to the Final Live Show.

664
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,730
I will announce it now.

665
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,200
(Advancing to the Final Live Show, 14th place)

666
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,240
The participant in 14th place.

667
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,010
This is my hometown.

668
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,350
He has either worked with PLEDIS Entertainment...

669
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,220
or performed a song by one of the artists...

670
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,920
at PLEDIS Entertainment.

671
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:10,920
"Plot Twist."

672
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:12,790
TWS.

673
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,229
(Na Yun Seo performed "Plot Twist" by TWS.)

674
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,530
(TWS is one of the artists at PLEDIS Entertainment.)

675
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,599
(Kang Woo Jin)

676
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,299
(Jang Han Eum)

677
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,799
(Chung Sang Hyeon)

678
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,300
(Chuei Li Yu)

679
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,639
TWS.

680
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,140
(Most members of Team "Sugar HIGH" are candidates.)

681
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,070
It could also be "Run to You."

682
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,410
Right.

683
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,570
Sun Heng Yu?

684
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,879
(Sun Heng Yu performed "Run to You" by SEVENTEEN.)

685
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,310
(SEVENTEEN is an artist at PLEDIS Entertainment.)

686
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,910
(15th, Sun Heng Yu)

687
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,880
Is there a participant who's an artist at PLEDIS Entertainment?

688
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,820
Not right now.

689
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,620
Dong Gyu?

690
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:43,790
Dong Gyu.

691
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,819
I was a part of PLEDIS Entertainment.

692
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,559
(Park Dong Gyu was a part of PLEDIS in the past.)

693
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,090
(3 years at PLEDIS Entertainment)

694
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,760
The one in 14th place.

695
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,700
I will announce it right away.

696
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,060
Who is it?

697
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,429
(24th, Park Dong Gyu)

698
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:01,339
(16th, Kang Woo Jin)

699
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,339
(14th, Jang Han Eum)

700
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,540
(Advancing to the Final Live Show, 14th place)

701
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,639
It's Park Dong Gyu.

702
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,580
(Park Dong Gyu survives in 14th place.)

703
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,090
That's amazing.

704
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,660
- Oh, my. - Goodness.

705
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,570
This is only right.

706
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,399
Dong Gyu went up a lot.

707
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,500
Dong Gyu.

708
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,370
His ranking went up by ten.

709
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,569
- Let's go. - That's insane.

710
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,540
- Please step forward. - Let's go.

711
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,810
- Go ahead first. - Let's go, Dong Gyu.

712
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,910
He was the Last Survivor in 24th place.

713
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,450
(He survived in 24th place during 2nd Survivor Announcement.)

714
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:52,889
He was the youngest on the team and lowest in rank.

715
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,590
(The youngest member of the team and a reliable leader)

716
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,130
Park Dong Gyu performed in the Semi-finals.

717
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:01,060
Now, he will no longer be at the bottom.

718
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,699
Congratulations on advancing to the finals.

719
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,140
(Park Dong Gyu, 14th, 2,568,600 points)

720
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,300
Goodness.

721
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,670
He's advancing to the final round.

722
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,840
- I'm jealous. - He looks like me.

723
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,909
- How so? - Don't we look similar?

724
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,350
(It's up to the Star Creators to decide.)

725
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,650
Please tell us how you feel.

726
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,090
It's hard to believe it.

727
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,360
While preparing myself for BOYS II PLANET,

728
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,759
I realized that there are so many competent...

729
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,190
and charming people out there.

730
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,030
It hurt my self-esteem,

731
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:38,740
but it also taught me to be humble.

732
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:43,169
Now, thanks to the love and support from the Star Creators,

733
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,509
I've been regaining my self-esteem.

734
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:48,109
I will show you an amazing performance.

735
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,350
Thank you very much.

736
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:57,120
The ranking of the next survivor is...

737
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,819
thirteenth place.

738
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,860
(Advancing to the Final Live Show, 13th place)

739
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,060
Gosh, it's hard.

740
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,589
It's so difficult today.

741
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,560
(11th, Kim Jun Min)

742
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,560
Please let it be Jun Min.

743
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:11,070
The participant in 13th place...

744
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,600
has a cute...

745
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,100
(Is it me?)

746
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,910
He has a cute pet.

747
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,880
It must be someone from Team "Sugar HIGH."

748
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,320
(During the Debut Concept Battle)

749
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,190
(Team "Sugar HIGH" had a cat concept.)

750
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,320
(Team Kitty Kisses)

751
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,859
A cute pet.

752
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,430
(It's a participant who has a pet.)

753
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,190
Doesn't Sang Hyeon have a cat?

754
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,929
- He has a cat. - Really?

755
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:40,930
Yes.

756
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,699
- Do you have a pet? - Yes.

757
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,970
I bet it's Sang Hyeon.

758
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,099
- You have a cat? - I have a cat and a dog.

759
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,470
(Kim Jun Min's cat and dog)

760
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,839
I have two cats at home.

761
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,570
(Masato's cats)

762
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:54,810
While being on BOYS II PLANET,

763
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,810
has he changed...

764
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,219
the color of his hair?

765
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,280
- No. - Yes.

766
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,749
Then it can't be you.

767
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,320
(Chung Sang Hyeon hasn't changed the color of his hair.)

768
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,830
Please join me, Jun Min.

769
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:13,360
(Kim Jun Min's signature red hair)

770
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,830
I don't think that it's me.

771
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,400
There's also Sato.

772
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,999
It could also be Sato.

773
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,240
(Masato has also changed his hair color.)

774
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,070
Chosen by the Star Creators,

775
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,310
he survived in 13th place.

776
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,549
Go, Kim Jun Min.

777
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,910
(11th, Kim Jun Min)

778
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,649
It's either Jun Min or Sato.

779
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,249
(9th, Masato)

780
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:38,020
(Advancing to the Final Live Show, 13th place)

781
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,089
It's Kim Jun Min.

782
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:43,690
(Kim Jun Min survives in 13th place.)

783
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,830
Goodness.

784
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,660
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

785
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,630
That's amazing.

786
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:55,739
Jun Min.

787
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,210
Congratulations.

788
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:58,810
All right.

789
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:03,680
- This is it. - That's amazing, Jun Min.

790
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:07,319
He has never been late at Planet Camp.

791
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,720
His hardworking nature got revealed and caught the public's attention.

792
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:15,160
(Jun Min consistently showed his dedication.)

793
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,689
Kim Jun Min's advancement to the finals seems like...

794
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:20,400
the result of everything he's done until now.

795
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,900
Congratulations from the bottom of my heart.

796
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,770
I'm so glad.

797
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,440
Dong Gyu and Jun Min are together again.

798
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,709
I've been wanting to advance to the Final Live Show.

799
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,580
I'd like to thank the Star Creators...

800
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:38,310
for helping me perform one last time.

801
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,350
Dong Gyu and I got...

802
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,120
to spend a lot of time together.

803
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,359
I'm grateful that he lent me his shoulder...

804
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,290
when I needed someone to lean on.

805
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,990
If we get to perform one last time,

806
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,030
I'd like to make an amazing performance.

807
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,200
That's awesome.

808
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,810
(Park Dong Gyu climbs up to the Survivor Seat.)

809
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,850
(He's followed by Kim Jun Min.)

810
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,320
This is it.

811
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,120
I really did it.

812
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,060
This is crazy.

813
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,230
I was so nervous.

814
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,700
- This feels like a dream. - I know.

815
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,500
- We're sitting next to each other. - Right.

816
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:37,009
I will continue to announce the participant...

817
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,840
who will take the 12th place seat.

818
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,979
(Advancing to the Final Live Show, 12th place)

819
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,209
Please, "MAIN DISH."

820
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,619
(Team "MAIN DISH" still hasn't had any survivors.)

821
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,020
I think there will be someone from "Sugar HIGH."

822
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,520
Someone has to be called now.

823
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,820
I hope someone gets called soon.

824
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,220
The participant to take 12th place,

825
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:57,490
compared to his rank in the previous survivor announcement...

826
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,859
(13th, Park Jun Il)

827
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,429
(10th, Chuei Li Yu)

828
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,870
(9th, Masato)

829
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,570
His rank has gone up.

830
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,239
It went up.

831
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,679
(17th, Li Zi Hao)

832
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,339
Han Eum, Woo Jin,

833
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,750
Li... Never mind.

834
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,480
Sato... No.

835
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,179
(Masato who was in 9th place and Li Yu who was in 10th place...)

836
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,389
(in the second survivor announcement are excluded.)

837
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,089
I think it'll be Han Eum or Woo Jin.

838
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,659
(14th, Jang Han Eum, 16th, Kang Woo Jin)

839
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,819
They're doing it the same way again.

840
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,959
My rank went up too.

841
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,130
- What place were you? - He went up too.

842
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:34,460
(18th, Chen Kai Wen)

843
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,630
Also,

844
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,870
this participant and Yumeki...

845
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,970
have been...

846
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,740
on the same team.

847
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,810
Kai Wen?

848
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,050
- Isn't it you? - My rank dropped last time.

849
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,710
- What was your rank? - I was 19th.

850
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,520
- So you went up. - Yes, you did.

851
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,650
Compared to last time, your rank went up.

852
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:00,019
(Zhang Jia Hao and Chen Kai Wen...)

853
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,390
(performed "Tambourine" with Yumeki.)

854
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,800
- Who could it be? - I don't know.

855
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,300
I think it's you.

856
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,970
Hao.

857
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,840
At 12th place, the participant who's advancing to the finals is...

858
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,280
Either Hao or Kai Wen.

859
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:24,410
(Who will take 12th place?)

860
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,849
It's Chen Kai Wen.

861
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,920
(12th place survivor, Chen Kai Wen)

862
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,250
Yes!

863
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:37,830
- Let's go! - Kai Wen!

864
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,260
- That's awesome. - That's so high.

865
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:44,930
Going up in rank since the last survivor announcement,

866
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,600
Participant Chen Kai Wen is confirmed to survive.

867
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,740
Gosh, I have a huge smile on my face now.

868
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,640
I really...

869
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:55,809
don't know what I should say right now.

870
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:56,850
That's because...

871
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,380
I never even imagined that this situation could happen.

872
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,449
Look at him grabbing the mic.

873
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,419
- Like this. - He looks shy.

874
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,719
I want to thank the Star Creators...

875
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,190
who cheered for me.

876
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,260
I will be sure to do well for the final performance.

877
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,800
Thank you.

878
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:18,870
Thank you so much, Star Creators.

879
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,200
Thank you for your hard work.

880
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,210
They worked hard?

881
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,410
I will work hard. Thank you.

882
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,210
That's so like him.

883
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,680
Will you be ranked even higher?

884
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,820
No.

885
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:38,250
Now, after they call 2 more people, it'll be 9th place.

886
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,389
- Really? - There are only a few seats.

887
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,960
(Now, there are only 2 seats left besides the Top 8 and 16th place.)

888
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,860
I will continue to announce 11th place.

889
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:49,869
(Advancing to the Final Live Show, 11th place)

890
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,700
- Now, who will go up? - Sato?

891
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:53,540
I'm sure it's either Sato or Sang Hyeon.

892
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,210
- He has to call my name this time. - Hao?

893
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,440
I think Sato will be ranked higher.

894
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,040
The participant who took 11th place...

895
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,880
(Born in winter)

896
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,520
- He's such a great singer. - Yes.

897
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,550
He was born in winter.

898
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,520
- It's not me. - Not me.

899
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,419
(Chung Sang Hyeon was born in September.)

900
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,590
- I was born in September. - Hao?

901
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,430
Li Yu was born in winter.

902
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:20,629
I was born in winter too.

903
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,999
(Chuei Li Yu and Jang Han Eum were born in winter.)

904
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,470
We were both born in winter.

905
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,629
Meki was born in November.

906
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,639
(That's true.)

907
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,070
I'm sure there are many of us.

908
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,510
Winter.

909
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,109
I was born in winter.

910
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,680
- I was born in winter. - Me too.

911
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,139
Why were so many of us born in winter?

912
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,410
Li Zi Hao, when were you born?

913
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,609
October.

914
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:38,950
Then, it's fall.

915
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,150
October.

916
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,380
(Not winter)

917
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:47,659
Also, has this person been the leader or had the killing part?

918
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,889
(10th, Chuei Li Yu)

919
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,890
(14th, Jang Han Eum)

920
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,100
He has.

921
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,159
- Chuei Li Yu. - You've been the leader too.

922
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,299
You did the killing part as well.

923
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,730
- Li Yu. - I did, for "Rose Blossom."

924
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,000
You were the leader too.

925
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,299
(Jang Han Eum sang the killing part for Team "Rose Blossom...")

926
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,070
(during the Class Switch Position Battle.)

927
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,739
(Chuei Li Yu had the killing part for "Plot Twist" Team 2...)

928
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:08,680
(during the 1-on-1 Class Battle.)

929
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,210
No, this is making my palms sweat again.

930
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,250
It's Meki.

931
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,120
Meki was the leader before.

932
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,919
(Yumeki was the leader of Team "Tambourine...")

933
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,249
(during the Class Switch Position mission.)

934
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:21,860
I will reveal the next survivor who took 11th place.

935
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,689
Han Eum could never be eliminated.

936
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:24,829
(14th, Jang Han Eum)

937
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:28,429
(22nd, Yumeki, 10th, Chuei Li Yu, )

938
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,499
It's Yoo Kang Min.

939
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,500
(11th place survivor, Yoo Kang Min)

940
00:40:31,501 --> 00:40:33,540
- It's Kang Min? - Oh, really?

941
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,040
Why does he keep going down?

942
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:43,350
Participant Yoo Kang Min has always been in the Top Eight.

943
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,319
He has been pushed out of the Top 8 for the 1st time,

944
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,449
but his survival has been confirmed with a high rank.

945
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:49,450
Thank you.

946
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,920
He dropped a lot.

947
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,060
He dropped three places.

948
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:56,730
Yes.

949
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:00,000
Thank you for giving me so much love this time as well.

950
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,600
I will work even harder from now on...

951
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,999
so that you can feel proud to be my fan.

952
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,270
I will do my best.

953
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,770
Thank you.

954
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,410
Kang Min went all the way down to 11th place?

955
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,150
That's tough.

956
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,080
I will announce the next person to take the survivor's seat.

957
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,690
- Right away? - Tenth place.

958
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,690
It's the participant in tenth place.

959
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:28,360
(Advancing to the Final Live Show, 10th place)

960
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:29,890
Who will it be?

961
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:32,390
There hasn't been anyone from Team "Sugar HIGH" so far.

962
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,600
The participant in tenth place, during the team adjustments...

963
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,029
(10th, Chuei Li Yu)

964
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,100
(19th, Zhang Jia Hao)

965
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,810
He did not switch teams.

966
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,110
- I think it'll be Hao. - Hao.

967
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,779
(Zhang Jia Hao stayed on Team "Chains...")

968
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,820
(until the end during the team adjustments.)

969
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,890
- I think it's Li Zi Hao. - Li Zi Hao?

970
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,319
- Li Zi Hao. - Come on. No.

971
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,320
Why not?

972
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:04,629
(The only survivor of Team "MAIN DISH"...)

973
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:07,460
(during the second survivor announcement, )

974
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,370
(Li Zi Hao performed "MAIN DISH" with new members.)

975
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,969
You never know.

976
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:14,370
I think I've reached my end.

977
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,410
I think it might be Li Yu or Sang Hyeon.

978
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:19,110
- Chung Sang Hyeon... - Or Sato.

979
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,539
Also, the song that this person sang during the Semi-finals...

980
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,550
without switching teams was...

981
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,150
"Sugar HIGH."

982
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:29,690
It was "Sugar HIGH."

983
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,749
- I knew it. - Gosh, he's from this team?

984
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,220
- Let's go. - Sang Hyeon.

985
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:34,590
It's Chuei Li Yu.

986
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:36,290
Who is there among us?

987
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,960
Everyone deserves to go.

988
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,859
(Team "Sugar HIGH" has several members near 10th place.)

989
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,170
(9th, Masato, 16th, Kang Woo Jin)

990
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:46,469
The participant who took tenth place...

991
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,640
thanks to the votes from Star Creators around the world is...

992
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:55,509
Chuei Li Yu.

993
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,649
(10th place survivor, Chuei Li Yu)

994
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:58,710
What is this?

995
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,850
You kept your spot.

996
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,190
You kept your spot.

997
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,389
- You kept your spot. - He was in tenth place last time.

998
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:07,020
I know, right? He was in tenth place.

999
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,789
But just keeping your spot is really hard too.

1000
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:11,860
Keeping it. Yes.

1001
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,630
(Chuei Li Yu looks at his teammates from the podium.)

1002
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:19,999
(Square your shoulders.)

1003
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,439
(Okay.)

1004
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,410
(Nodding)

1005
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:25,509
(Chuei Li Yu, 10th, 2,645,855 points)

1006
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:29,679
First of all, I am so grateful for letting me keep my high rank...

1007
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,080
of tenth place just like last time.

1008
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:35,990
Now, only the final performance remains.

1009
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,690
I will work that much harder...

1010
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:43,760
and try to get good results without any regrets.

1011
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:44,960
Also,

1012
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:48,700
my friends who are still over there...

1013
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:52,770
I wish we could stay together until the end...

1014
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:57,870
- Why? - What's wrong?

1015
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:01,940
Why are you crying?

1016
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,310
I hope we can all go up together.

1017
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,180
Don't cry.

1018
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,620
Now, please move to your seats.

1019
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:18,189
(Chen Kai Wen takes his seat at 12th place.)

1020
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:19,860
I was stabbed in the back by Chen Kai Wen.

1021
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,430
We promised we'd go back and play games together.

1022
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,100
Hey.

1023
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:29,270
(Next, Yoo Kang Min takes his seat at 11th place.)

1024
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:38,280
(Chuei Li Yu takes his survivor's seat at 10th place as well.)

1025
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,350
BOYS II PLANET, the Third Survivor Announcement.

1026
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,120
I will continue announcing the next survivor.

1027
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:51,890
But before I do that...

1028
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:53,699
Gosh, before that.

1029
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:57,630
I've been handed a secret request.

1030
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:59,669
- What's that? - A request?

1031
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:00,739
- What is it? - What?

1032
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,469
(What request?)

1033
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:03,510
What is it?

1034
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:07,110
Things that we were curious about but couldn't ask.

1035
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:09,109
From these pieces of TMI...

1036
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:11,610
to the participants' personal lives.

1037
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:14,319
- What? - For the countless Star Creators.

1038
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,480
- It's time to satisfy... - That's not possible.

1039
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,550
- their curiosities. - Please.

1040
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:19,660
Let's find out together.

1041
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:24,160
- "Finally I can tell." - "Finally I can tell."

1042
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,029
(One Outfit Man, Sun Heng Yu)

1043
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:27,600
- One outfit man. - One outfit man.

1044
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:30,130
(A tip-off from a Star Creator)

1045
00:45:30,131 --> 00:45:32,029
(Always wearing the same clothes...)

1046
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,500
- Wears the same clothes every day. - Always wearing the same...

1047
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,810
(The shirt in question)

1048
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:39,910
Wait.

1049
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,840
Oh, no.

1050
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:43,780
(Proof 1: The day he visited the support cafe)

1051
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,680
(Proof 2: Shopping day)

1052
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:48,980
- He's wearing it again. - It's the same shirt.

1053
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:51,749
Is it not the same day?

1054
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,459
(Proof 4: Getting off from his part-time job)

1055
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,320
(All on different days)

1056
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:56,830
Oh, gosh.

1057
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,660
Please tell us.

1058
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,000
It is the same shirt, indeed.

1059
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,130
Doesn't he have five of the same shirt?

1060
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,100
It's not like I don't have money to buy clothes.

1061
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:11,470
- You don't have to tell us that. - Right.

1062
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,480
It's not like there are multiple sets of the same shirt, is it?

1063
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,879
It is the same shirt, and I brought it with me this time as well.

1064
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,849
- You brought it again with you? - Yes.

1065
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:23,620
(Sun Heng Yu's favorite shirt)

1066
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:26,190
I also have a favorite outfit.

1067
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:28,890
Let us continue.

1068
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,999
- Yun Seo, the youngest. - Yun Seo.

1069
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,930
(Na Yun Seo, the Youngest)

1070
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,970
Yun Seo is always around with older brothers.

1071
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:40,840
But who is his favorite brother?

1072
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:44,139
And if he chooses me as his favorite,

1073
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,940
I'll be incredibly happy.

1074
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,509
(I like you too, Masato.)

1075
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:49,850
Isn't he threatening him?

1076
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:51,010
"Choose me."

1077
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:52,409
I am curious, though.

1078
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:53,950
Yes, I'm curious.

1079
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:57,719
(Park Dong Gyu, who is full of affection)

1080
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,820
(A sudden kiss)

1081
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:01,160
(He turns into Yun Seo's very own ride.)

1082
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:04,160
Did you do well in your rehearsal?

1083
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,689
I think it went fine.

1084
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:06,799
So it wasn't bad?

1085
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,199
I thought you looked quite nervous.

1086
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,299
(Eyes filled with love)

1087
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,399
I was very nervous.

1088
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,470
(Yoo Kang Min, a warm brother who takes great care of him)

1089
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:15,069
(I trust you, Yun Seo.)

1090
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:18,609
There are people who cheer for you, Yun Seo.

1091
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:21,710
That is really great, really.

1092
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:23,649
(Sweet Masato, who gives advice)

1093
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:25,350
- Masato. - Masato.

1094
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:28,720
(Na Yun Seo wasn't used to falling asleep on his own.)

1095
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,590
- Right. Umbrella brother. - Are you scared to sleep alone?

1096
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:33,120
(Nodding)

1097
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,689
(Embarrassed)

1098
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:36,230
No, this can't be.

1099
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:41,499
(Umbrella brother, He Xin Long was with him until he fell asleep.)

1100
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,500
Umbrella brother.

1101
00:47:42,501 --> 00:47:44,699
(Who is Na Yun Seo's favorite brother among them?)

1102
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:45,729
Does he have to choose one now?

1103
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:50,009
Who is Participant Na Yun Seo's favorite brother?

1104
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:51,210
- Who can it be? - Who is it?

1105
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:53,709
I think he'll choose me.

1106
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:54,710
(The one who wants to become the favorite brother)

1107
00:47:54,711 --> 00:47:55,780
I can't wait to find out.

1108
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:58,410
I'll give you a hint about his favorite brother...

1109
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:02,550
based on the information I've gathered.

1110
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:05,650
- It's already chosen? - It's already decided?

1111
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:08,760
Participant Na Yun Seo's favorite brother is...

1112
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,890
someone who is...

1113
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,030
Is he from Korea?

1114
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,769
Not from Korea.

1115
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:20,539
Dong Gyu, you're done.

1116
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,270
(Park Dong Gyu and Yoo Kang Min are out of the race.)

1117
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:25,010
- Yun Seo, don't talk to me. - Right. Don't talk to us.

1118
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,779
(I'm sorry, you guys.)

1119
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:30,950
And Participant Na Yun Seo's favorite brother is...

1120
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:35,520
someone who was on the same team...

1121
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,190
during the third mission?

1122
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,159
(Is Masato, who's been through thick and thin in "Sugar High," the one?)

1123
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,190
Who is it?

1124
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,669
He was not with him during the third mission.

1125
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:55,470
Wait. Then it's not me. He chose Xin Long.

1126
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,340
Wait. It must be Xin Long.

1127
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,909
He isn't giving us a hint but the answer.

1128
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:03,079
Then let's hear...

1129
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,650
from Participant Na Yun Seo directly.

1130
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:07,380
My favorite brother is...

1131
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:10,320
- Favorite brother. - Favorite brother.

1132
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:13,220
It's...

1133
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,360
Leo, who is not amongst the candidates.

1134
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,360
Leo, who is not amongst the candidates.

1135
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:25,900
I knew this would happen. I knew it.

1136
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,009
Xin Long, you should be seated for this.

1137
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:32,969
- This is only right. - My feelings are hurt.

1138
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,810
Isn't he a traitor?

1139
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,709
- Is this right? - This is a big twist.

1140
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:40,580
(His favorite brother, in the end, was Lee Leo.)

1141
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,419
(Zhou An Xin, Addicted to Kisses)

1142
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,219
- Addicted to kisses? - Oh, gosh.

1143
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,220
Kisses?

1144
00:49:45,221 --> 00:49:46,489
(Zhou An Xin is the cute boy in BOYS II PLANET.)

1145
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:47,520
Zhou An Xin.

1146
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:50,560
(Is he addicted to kisses from older brothers?)

1147
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,200
- Well done. - Well done.

1148
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:55,929
Good job.

1149
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:57,199
(Even when going up the stage)

1150
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,199
(Smack)

1151
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,040
- Look at them. - What was that?

1152
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,610
What?

1153
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,670
Are you going to do well on stage today?

1154
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:07,110
(Smack)

1155
00:50:07,111 --> 00:50:08,410
Can you do well on stage today?

1156
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,380
- Yes, I can. - You can?

1157
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:13,279
Was An Xin such a person?

1158
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,250
(Which participant kissed Zhou An Xin the most?)

1159
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,650
Participant Zhou An Xin.

1160
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:21,220
Who is the contestant you have kissed the most...

1161
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,290
or who has kissed you the most?

1162
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:28,629
I kissed Zhang Jia Hao the most.

1163
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:30,900
But he has never kissed me.

1164
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,540
- He hasn't kissed you once? - No. I'm so upset.

1165
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,640
Wait. The mood is turning strange.

1166
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,469
- Hey. - The mood is turning strange.

1167
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:39,570
Wait.

1168
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:43,079
Then, can you give him a kiss right now,

1169
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,279
something you've never done for him?

1170
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,419
- Right now. - Let's go. Right now.

1171
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:49,179
- Right now. - Right now.

1172
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,449
(Give him a kiss.)

1173
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:52,289
- Right now. - Right now.

1174
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:53,290
(Zhang Jia Hao approaches with great strides at the enthusiastic cheers.)

1175
00:50:53,291 --> 00:50:54,560
(Seriously?)

1176
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:57,730
(Smack)

1177
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:02,960
(I'd like to buy eyes that haven't seen this.)

1178
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:06,200
I'm so happy now. Thank you.

1179
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,340
You are happy now?

1180
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:10,239
(Zhou An Xin feels better after getting the kiss.)

1181
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,540
Everyone's so friendly here. This is great.

1182
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:16,609
(Puppy-like Chen Kai Wen)

1183
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,150
"Puppy-like Chen Kai Wen."

1184
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,850
(Chen Kai Wen, a man who loves everyone)

1185
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:23,920
(A human puppy who runs and hugs people he sees)

1186
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:26,289
(Lately, something has been bothering him.)

1187
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:30,529
Why do you have to come to me every night before bed and hug me...

1188
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:32,430
for five minutes before you can fall asleep?

1189
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:35,199
Do you like me that much?

1190
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,100
Li Zi Hao.

1191
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:48,040
(Li Zi Hao's passionate love for Chen Kai Wen)

1192
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:50,680
(Do you want to come here?)

1193
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,750
(Li Zi Hao lies down next to him naturally.)

1194
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:57,019
(Why do you keep on hugging Chen Kai Wen?)

1195
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:59,090
I think Chen Kai Wen is very cute.

1196
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:01,989
I can't control it.

1197
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:03,590
He can't control it.

1198
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:04,889
(Gosh, that guy.)

1199
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:08,599
It's like, "Gosh, Kai Wen is cute."

1200
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,500
It's something like that.

1201
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:16,300
What is going on in this dormitory? I'm curious.

1202
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:19,910
(And there is another question for Li Zi Hao.)

1203
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,810
(Here's a question. Find something odd in the video.)

1204
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,849
(Li Zi Hao from Team 1 naturally joined in.)

1205
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:29,550
Right. That's a different team.

1206
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:32,419
That's a different team.

1207
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,060
(Why were you eating next to a different team that was fighting?)

1208
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,859
The team was fighting next to you.

1209
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:40,800
- Yes. - Were you able to eat well?

1210
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:45,100
Normally, when you eat, you need to watch videos, right?

1211
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,700
This was perfect. It was on live.

1212
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,610
It was like a live show.

1213
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:54,609
(He's out of breath from laughing.)

1214
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:56,809
I think I was able to enjoy the meal more.

1215
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:59,180
Right. That's how you thought of it.

1216
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:00,680
Gosh.

1217
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:03,590
No wonder you were so calm as if you were watching TV.

1218
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:05,950
It's so like you.

1219
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:08,519
(Lee Leo, Creator of Buzzwords)

1220
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,559
Buzzwords.

1221
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,290
- Right. - Let's go. Here it is.

1222
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,229
- He's always like this. - Giving up on the diet.

1223
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:17,570
- That's not it. - Is it dented?

1224
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:18,970
You can't help it.

1225
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:20,469
You need to sigh.

1226
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:23,910
- Then, what do we do about it? - He keeps on saying that.

1227
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:27,510
Your face shines even brighter today.

1228
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:29,279
(Here's a sample of the original.)

1229
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,250
Legendary level.

1230
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,179
Why was I doing that?

1231
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:35,519
(What is the story behind the birth of this legendary trendy tone?)

1232
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,049
Legendary level.

1233
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,590
Participant Lee Leo.

1234
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:41,220
When did you start using this tone?

1235
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:45,630
One day, I started talking this way while practicing.

1236
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:48,529
Sang Won was the one...

1237
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:50,769
that developed the tone diligently.

1238
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:51,970
- So... - He developed it.

1239
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:54,000
Why are you putting a fancy spin on it?

1240
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,470
Could you possibly...

1241
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:59,870
speak in that tone with Sang Won?

1242
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:03,610
- Then, let me lead an interview. - Sure.

1243
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:07,680
What are you planning to eat when you are done?

1244
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,820
That's not an easy question.

1245
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:14,620
Good match.

1246
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,519
Good fight.

1247
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,890
(The two are doing a perfect job of improvising.)

1248
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:19,860
I can't watch this.

1249
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,200
But Sang Won,

1250
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:25,830
you speak well in this tone.

1251
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,069
(The participants are strongly sympathizing.)

1252
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:32,140
I think you should talk in this tone in your daily life.

1253
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:35,509
You speak much better.

1254
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:37,049
(Lee Sang Won is at a loss as he is bombarded with facts.)

1255
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:39,610
I was so surprised to see you speak so well.

1256
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,320
Finally I Can Tell that was filled with unexpected questions...

1257
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:47,860
and answers, will conclude here.

1258
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,999
BOYS II PLANET, Third Survivor Announcement.

1259
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,200
A total of six survivors have been announced so far.

1260
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:02,369
The number of people who could take the survivor seats now are...

1261
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:04,270
the 9 candidates from the Top 8...

1262
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:07,810
and 1 in 16th place, which totals up to 10 people.

1263
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:11,149
Among the 18 participants waiting to be announced,

1264
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:16,150
who will go on the Final Stage of BOYS II PLANET?

1265
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:19,350
I'll carry on with the announcement.

1266
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,890
Eighth place in the Top Eight!

1267
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:23,960
Before the announcement,

1268
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:28,060
we will first check the 2 candidates for 8th place.

1269
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,730
Then are they in 8th and 9th places?

1270
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,470
Who are they?

1271
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:34,940
I think both will be in Team "Sugar HIGH."

1272
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,399
(6th, Chung Sang Hyeon, 9th, Masato)

1273
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,440
Two here?

1274
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:39,710
Who could they be? I'm really curious.

1275
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:44,180
Which participants became the candidates for eighth place?

1276
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:47,350
The candidates will be shown on the screen.

1277
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:52,820
What?

1278
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:54,290
What?

1279
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:55,720
(Candidates for 8th place)

1280
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:59,660
(Yumeki and Chung Sang Hyeon)

1281
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,860
- Okay. - Yumeki!

1282
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,169
(Yumeki rose from 22nd place to the candidate for 8th place.)

1283
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:06,430
Yumeki went up so high.

1284
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:09,640
Yumeki!

1285
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:12,239
Participants Yumeki and Chung Sang Hyeon.

1286
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,839
The two face off in a fateful battle for the single 8th-place spot,

1287
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,510
the position representing the debut group.

1288
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:20,879
If Yumeki gets in the Top Eight,

1289
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,119
- that would be legendary. - I know, right?

1290
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,280
It would be legendary.

1291
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:27,020
I feel nervous, don't you?

1292
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,790
Is Masato in 16th place, then?

1293
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:31,830
Masato could be in seventh place.

1294
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,430
- I can't predict anything. - Me neither.

1295
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,369
Between Yumeki and Chung Sang Hyeon,

1296
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:39,629
the participant whose name is called takes eighth place,

1297
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:42,470
while the one not called takes ninth place.

1298
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:44,070
This is what I think.

1299
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:45,969
They said there's a new participant who entered the Top Eight.

1300
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:47,140
Wouldn't it be Yumeki, then?

1301
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:50,680
(At the beginning of the Third Survivor Announcement)

1302
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:53,650
An existing Top Eight participant was displaced,

1303
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:56,820
and a new participant entered the Top Eight.

1304
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:00,420
(Will the new participant in Top 8 be Yumeki?)

1305
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,289
As a result of the fourth round global voting,

1306
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:07,460
the participant in 8th place earned 2,805,144 points,

1307
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:12,470
and the participant in 9th place earned 2,783,273 points.

1308
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:16,770
The two participants have a difference of 21,871 points,

1309
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:18,740
which decided their ranking.

1310
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:20,640
A difference of 20,000 points.

1311
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,080
That's not much.

1312
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,310
It's about the same.

1313
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,750
It's not that different.

1314
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:27,250
Yumeki ranked up so much.

1315
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:28,880
I think he was in 22nd place last time.

1316
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:34,060
(Yumeki survived in 22nd place at the 2nd Survivor Announcement.)

1317
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:37,389
(Will Yumeki, who showed growth as the rapper of Team "Lucky MACHO,")

1318
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:40,260
(survive in 8th place?)

1319
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,200
Yumeki.

1320
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:44,970
Chung Sang Hyeon?

1321
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,069
(Will Chung Sang Hyeon, who presented freshness...)

1322
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:52,940
(on the "Sugar HIGH" performance, survive in 8th place?)

1323
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,479
The person to take the Top Eight seat...

1324
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,680
between Yumeki and Chung Sang Hyeon...

1325
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,150
is...

1326
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:07,660
Chung Sang Hyeon.

1327
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:12,530
(8th in Top 8, Chung Sang Hyeon)

1328
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:15,830
Chung Sang Hyeon.

1329
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:21,100
Chung Sang Hyeon went down two ranks,

1330
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,969
but secured the final eighth spot,

1331
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:26,469
claiming the honor of being the first...

1332
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:28,310
to take a seat in the Top Eight.

1333
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:32,809
First of all, I wanted to thank...

1334
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:35,249
all the Star Creators who helped me...

1335
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:38,620
to stand on the final stage.

1336
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:47,260
Now, I'll think this is the only chance I have...

1337
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:49,230
and practice...

1338
00:58:51,830 --> 00:58:53,000
with more desperation.

1339
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,340
I will be grateful for every moment...

1340
00:58:57,610 --> 00:59:01,010
and do my best in my current position.

1341
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:06,049
I still can't believe...

1342
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:09,550
that I was given such a high rank.

1343
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:11,749
I really want to thank the Star Creators...

1344
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:14,859
who always trust and follow me...

1345
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:17,660
no matter what I do.

1346
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:24,000
(Yumeki heads to the 9th-place seat.)

1347
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:26,270
- It's such a relief. - Seriously.

1348
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,640
It's crazy.

1349
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,539
Good work.

1350
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:34,540
(Chung Sang Hyeon, in 8th place, heads to the Top 8 seat.)

1351
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:39,880
Congratulations.

1352
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:43,420
Thank you so much.

1353
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:49,320
(Chung Sang Hyeon, the first to sit in the Top 8 seat)

1354
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:54,800
Next, I'll announce the participant in 7th place in the Top 8.

1355
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,660
(7th place in Planet Top 8)

1356
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,869
Could it be Masato?

1357
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:02,900
Masato?

1358
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:05,010
Geon Woo?

1359
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:07,880
The participant in seventh place...

1360
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:11,109
has received benefits...

1361
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:12,880
through mission stage voting...

1362
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:14,619
(5th, Kim Jun Seo)

1363
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:15,920
(19th Zhang Jia Hao)

1364
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,850
more than two times.

1365
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:19,219
What?

1366
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:20,860
- More than two times? - Yes.

1367
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:23,190
Did you get the benefit two times?

1368
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:26,760
I got it after "Rising Sun."

1369
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:29,529
Who got the benefit more than two times?

1370
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:30,570
I only got it once.

1371
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:31,970
Hao.

1372
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:33,369
Is it Hao?

1373
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:34,640
(19th Zhang Jia Hao)

1374
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,900
(He received the first benefit for "S-Class.")

1375
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,440
(He received the second benefit for "Tambourine.")

1376
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:42,410
(Zhang Jia Hao received the third benefit for "Chains.")

1377
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:44,950
It's Kim Geon Woo.

1378
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:47,580
(7th, Kim Geon Woo)

1379
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,890
(He received the first benefit for "Whiplash.")

1380
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:54,160
(He received the second benefit for "LALALALA.")

1381
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:58,330
(Kim Geon Woo received the third benefit for "Chains.")

1382
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,260
(7th, Kim Geon Woo)

1383
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:01,559
Jun Seo.

1384
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:02,830
I received it two times.

1385
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,199
- Two times? - Yes.

1386
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,470
(He received the first benefit for "Whiplash.")

1387
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:09,139
(He received the second benefit for "Bad.")

1388
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:10,869
(Kim Jun Seo: 1,310 points)

1389
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:12,369
(5th, Kim Jun Seo)

1390
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:13,410
Is it me?

1391
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:14,910
Jun Seo?

1392
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:16,410
I think it's Geon Woo.

1393
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,980
- Jun Seo or Geon Woo. - Kim Geon Woo?

1394
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:25,890
The participant survived with 2,829,642 points.

1395
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:28,019
But the difference in scores isn't much.

1396
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:29,060
It's really not much.

1397
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:32,189
(Less than a 30,000-point difference from 8th place)

1398
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:34,060
The participant in 7th place in the Top 8...

1399
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,900
to proudly advance to the Final Live Show...

1400
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:44,040
He put the mic down.

1401
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:46,240
(Please tell us quickly.)

1402
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:49,379
is Kim Jun Seo.

1403
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:50,879
(7th in Top 8, Kim Jun Seo)

1404
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:51,910
Jun Seo!

1405
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:53,880
I was startled.

1406
01:01:56,220 --> 01:02:00,189
From the First Survivor Announcement until now,

1407
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:03,519
Kim Jun Seo has held his spot in the Top Eight constantly,

1408
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,860
proving his potential to join the debut lineup.

1409
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,899
(7th place in Planet Top 8)

1410
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:11,900
I really thank the Star Creators who gave me such a high rank...

1411
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:13,500
as a gift.

1412
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:16,969
I just thought, if only I could make it to the finals,

1413
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:18,169
that would be enough.

1414
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:19,839
Thank you so much.

1415
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,740
I'll do my best until the end...

1416
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:24,180
and show you good performances. Thank you.

1417
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:33,550
Congratulations.

1418
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,460
I envy him.

1419
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,670
Hold on. There aren't enough seats.

1420
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,300
One, two, three, four, five, six,

1421
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:49,970
seven seats.

1422
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:52,139
Masato is still there.

1423
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:54,010
Right. Masato is there.

1424
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,540
Where's He Xin Long?

1425
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:57,709
Where will Jia Hao go?

1426
01:02:57,710 --> 01:02:59,679
My heart is about to burst.

1427
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,650
(19th, Zhang Jia Hao)

1428
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:03,949
I will continue with the announcement.

1429
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:06,150
Who would be the participant in the sixth place...

1430
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:08,190
in the Top Eight?

1431
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:12,660
(6th place in Planet Top 8)

1432
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:14,399
Will five participants go there...

1433
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,400
from Team "Chains?"

1434
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:17,669
It could be four from Team "Chains."

1435
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:18,730
Jia Hao might not go there.

1436
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:21,070
(19th, Zhang Jia Hao)

1437
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,140
Then what will happen to Masato and He Xin Long?

1438
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:27,410
He Xin Long's seat has to be there.

1439
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:30,710
(4th, He Xin Long)

1440
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:34,350
The participant who will sit in sixth place...

1441
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:37,220
has a beloved older sister.

1442
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:38,790
Older sister?

1443
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:40,590
Sang Won has an older sister.

1444
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,589
(Lee Sang Won showed a genuine sibling-like chemistry...)

1445
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:45,460
(through video calls with his older sisters.)

1446
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:47,629
Sister? I have an older sister.

1447
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:48,860
(7th, Kim Geon Woo)

1448
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:50,999
Do you have a sister?

1449
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,070
(Dad, Mom, younger brother)

1450
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:54,340
Do you have a sister?

1451
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:56,470
Do you have a sister?

1452
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:58,170
Who is it?

1453
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,940
Could the participants with sisters raise their hands?

1454
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,650
- Over there. - There are many.

1455
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:06,809
There are several participants. One, two...

1456
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:07,880
(Mom, older sister)

1457
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:09,549
Can I raise my hand?

1458
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:10,790
(Family: Mom, Dad, oldest sister, second-oldest sister)

1459
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:12,520
Everyone has sisters.

1460
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:15,420
Even Geon Woo has a sister?

1461
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,460
It's Geon Woo.

1462
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:19,160
Xin Long has a sister too.

1463
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,429
- I have a sister. - Do you have a sister?

1464
01:04:21,430 --> 01:04:22,430
I do.

1465
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:24,270
Does everyone have sisters?

1466
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,640
Xin Long, Geon Woo, Leo?

1467
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,500
Also,

1468
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,270
he's good at rapping.

1469
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:33,940
Rap?

1470
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:36,980
That's you. There's no one else.

1471
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:42,180
(He Xin Long was the main rapper in Team "Lucky MACHO.")

1472
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:45,250
- Geon Woo is also a rapper. - Rap?

1473
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:49,920
(Kim Geon Woo was the main rapper of "Whiplash" Team 1.)

1474
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,260
It must be Geon Woo or Xin Long.

1475
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:56,200
(Could the participant in 6th place be 1 of the 2?)

1476
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:59,899
This participant took 6th place in the Top 8...

1477
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:02,140
- Not much difference. - with 2,957,303 points.

1478
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:04,239
The survivor who will be able to perform in the Final Live Show...

1479
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,510
in front of the Star Creators again.

1480
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:07,740
Geon Woo?

1481
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:09,280
Xin Long?

1482
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:10,680
I don't think it will be Xin Long.

1483
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,820
The one in sixth place...

1484
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:20,090
is He Xin Long.

1485
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:24,430
(6th in Top 8, He Xin Long)

1486
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:28,860
Is it really you?

1487
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,900
Best of luck, Xin Long!

1488
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:36,300
Here comes Xin Long!

1489
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:51,220
First of all, I would like to thank...

1490
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:55,460
all of my fans who have supported me.

1491
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:58,759
I will have a heart of gratitude...

1492
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:02,000
and make sure to always keep that heart.

1493
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:06,029
I am really blessed to have you all with me.

1494
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:08,640
I wish for us to be there for each other even in the future.

1495
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:10,939
I will do my best until the end without getting shaken.

1496
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,970
Thank you so much for trusting me.

1497
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,040
Thank you.

1498
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:20,010
Well done.

1499
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:22,920
(He Xin Long moves to the seat for 6th in Top 8.)

1500
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:24,620
Great work.

1501
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:27,320
Great work.

1502
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:31,530
He's awesome.

1503
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,660
Geon Woo has gone up even more.

1504
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:38,130
Gosh, Geon Woo.

1505
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:46,610
I will continue to announce the 5th in Top 8.

1506
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:48,809
I can't make predictions.

1507
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:49,979
I have no idea.

1508
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:51,610
(7th, Kim Geon Woo)

1509
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,749
(9th, Masato)

1510
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:54,979
I think it's Masato or Hao.

1511
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:56,049
(19th, Zhang Jia Hao)

1512
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:57,280
It can't be predicted at all.

1513
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:58,550
Exactly.

1514
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:00,790
I have no idea now.

1515
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:03,660
The one in fifth place.

1516
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:07,360
I think everyone will be surprised after hearing this person's name.

1517
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:08,500
What?

1518
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:13,500
It's a participant who has entered the Top 8 for the 1st time.

1519
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,100
- Zhang Jia Hao. - Zhang Jia Hao.

1520
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:19,640
Hao.

1521
01:07:19,641 --> 01:07:20,940
(19th, Zhang Jia Hao)

1522
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,939
It will be his 1st time in the Top 8 as well.

1523
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:24,609
It could be Han Eum.

1524
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:25,710
Han Eum.

1525
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:27,279
(14th, Jang Han Eum)

1526
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,319
It's one of them, no matter what.

1527
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:32,390
This participant must be logical...

1528
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,360
and strategic.

1529
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:37,930
There's a T and J in his MBTI.

1530
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,760
T and J? That's unbelievable.

1531
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:42,930
Is that you?

1532
01:07:42,931 --> 01:07:44,169
(Nodding)

1533
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:46,670
Can I see a raise of hands of the ones who are relevant?

1534
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,600
- What? - T and J.

1535
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,510
- What? - T and J.

1536
01:07:52,910 --> 01:07:54,070
They both have T and J?

1537
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,580
And the last name of this participant...

1538
01:07:58,610 --> 01:08:00,819
- It's Zhang or Jang. - It's Zhang or Jang.

1539
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:01,820
Gosh.

1540
01:08:01,821 --> 01:08:03,279
- They sound similar. - Gosh.

1541
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,320
- Zhang or Jang! - Zhang or Jang!

1542
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:06,049
It's Zhang or Jang.

1543
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:07,420
- Gosh! - Gosh!

1544
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:09,520
It's one of the two.

1545
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,330
Jang Han Eum against Zhang Jia Hao.

1546
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:13,160
The participant in fifth place...

1547
01:08:14,330 --> 01:08:16,199
- It must be Hao. - It must be Hao.

1548
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,969
(19th, Zhang Jia Hao)

1549
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:21,070
(14th, Jang Han Eum)

1550
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:24,439
It's Zhang Jia Hao.

1551
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,810
(5th in Top 8, Zhang Jia Hao)

1552
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:27,040
It's Zhang Jia Hao.

1553
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:31,609
It's Zhang Jia Hao.

1554
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:36,049
(5th in Top 8, Zhang Jia Hao)

1555
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:37,280
Let's go, Hao!

1556
01:08:42,990 --> 01:08:45,060
I think all members of Team "Chains" will survive.

1557
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:48,530
Compared to the Second Survivor Announcement,

1558
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,929
Zhang Jia Hao went up by 14 ranks...

1559
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:53,770
and secured a spot in the Top Eight.

1560
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:56,170
Congratulations on reaching the finals.

1561
01:08:56,370 --> 01:08:57,840
The benefit played a big part.

1562
01:08:58,310 --> 01:08:59,540
Gosh, Hao.

1563
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,580
- That's amazing. - Hao did great.

1564
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:04,249
Every mission performance of Zhang Jia Hao...

1565
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:05,910
got a lot of attention...

1566
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:08,350
from the Star Creators.

1567
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,550
He has reached the Top 8 for the 1st time.

1568
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:12,890
How do you feel?

1569
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:14,890
It's my first time...

1570
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:19,559
going up in rank.

1571
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,430
The Star Creators...

1572
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:25,199
have worked so hard and sacrificed themselves...

1573
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,470
to give me their support.

1574
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:30,240
I felt all of that.

1575
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:32,470
Even with the last performance,

1576
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,579
I will be perfect...

1577
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:37,810
with the love they have shown me.

1578
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,210
Team "Chains."

1579
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:43,350
Sang Won, Leo, An Xin, Geon Woo,

1580
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:44,650
and Lee Jeong.

1581
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:47,720
Along with these great members,

1582
01:09:48,490 --> 01:09:50,819
I was able to put on the best performance,

1583
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:53,590
and I felt really happy about it.

1584
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:56,529
Come to me...

1585
01:09:56,530 --> 01:09:59,170
whenever you need my help.

1586
01:09:59,730 --> 01:10:00,800
Thank you.

1587
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,070
That was cute.

1588
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:04,270
Gosh.

1589
01:10:05,010 --> 01:10:06,039
Nice, Hao.

1590
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,169
You're amazing.

1591
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:08,309
(Zhang Jia Hao moves up the Top 8 seats for the 1st time.)

1592
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:09,410
I'll be there too.

1593
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:11,310
You did amazing.

1594
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:16,350
I didn't even imagine this would happen.

1595
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:22,820
Nice one.

1596
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:28,399
I will continue to announce the participant...

1597
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,230
in 4th in Top 8.

1598
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:31,900
Let's get fourth place.

1599
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:33,729
It must be my turn now, right?

1600
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:35,399
I'll feel embarrassed if I go up higher.

1601
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,000
(17th, Li Zi Hao)

1602
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:39,170
He's unbelievable.

1603
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:42,380
The participant who has taken fourth place...

1604
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,610
has performed this song for the Semi-finals.

1605
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:47,780
"Chains."

1606
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:50,950
It was "Chains."

1607
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,949
Geon Woo or Leo.

1608
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:54,820
All members of Team "Chains" have survived.

1609
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:56,920
All members of Team "Chains."

1610
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,430
Team "Chains" is incredible.

1611
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:01,330
And during the Survivor Announcement,

1612
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:04,770
this participant did a speech in English.

1613
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:06,800
- Let's go, Leo! - Leo!

1614
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,539
- Geon Woo did one in English too. - Geon Woo did one too.

1615
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:10,769
"Better chair."

1616
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:12,670
- "Better chair." - "Better chair."

1617
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:15,440
(During the Second Survivor Announcement)

1618
01:11:16,010 --> 01:11:17,610
(I can sit on a better chair.)

1619
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:18,810
A cushy chair.

1620
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:22,920
(Better chair)

1621
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:24,850
(Geon Woo's English speech touched the hearts of global Star Creators.)

1622
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:26,490
Geon Woo's English was cute too.

1623
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:27,660
"Better chair."

1624
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:31,489
I will announce the participant that will take fourth place...

1625
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:32,660
in Top Eight.

1626
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:36,000
After receiving 3,096,619 points,

1627
01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:39,470
this participant has secured a high rank in Top Eight.

1628
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:41,000
Who do you think it'll be?

1629
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,600
Geon Woo.

1630
01:11:42,601 --> 01:11:44,840
(7th, Kim Geon Woo)

1631
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:46,270
Leo.

1632
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:47,640
Leo?

1633
01:11:47,641 --> 01:11:49,310
The participant in fourth place...

1634
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,049
is Kim Geon Woo.

1635
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:57,949
(4th in Top 8, Kim Geon Woo)

1636
01:11:57,950 --> 01:11:58,990
Congratulations!

1637
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:01,390
Gosh, I'm sweating.

1638
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:04,290
Following the previous announcement,

1639
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:07,860
Kim Geon Woo has reached the Top Eight two times in a row.

1640
01:12:07,930 --> 01:12:09,960
With a rank boost from the benefit,

1641
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:12,270
he finished in fourth place.

1642
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:17,070
I have been placed at a top rank once again...

1643
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:19,209
thanks to the Star Creators.

1644
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:21,310
I would like to sincerely thank them.

1645
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:24,210
Out of 160 participants,

1646
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:25,879
only 16 participants are left.

1647
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:28,050
I even got the opportunity to prepare for the Final mission.

1648
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:31,749
I will do my best to prepare for the finals...

1649
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:33,819
and put on a great performance. Thank you.

1650
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:35,259
- You can do it. - He's amazing.

1651
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:37,729
You can do it, boy.

1652
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:41,500
Thank you so much for your support.

1653
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:46,470
Ever since I was a trainee...

1654
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,140
and up until now, my dream was to make my debut.

1655
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:52,710
What is he doing?

1656
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:54,270
He's amazing.

1657
01:12:54,610 --> 01:12:56,809
I still lack a lot,

1658
01:12:56,810 --> 01:12:59,250
but I will continue to work hard.

1659
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:01,250
Thank you. I love you all.

1660
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:03,750
I love you.

1661
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:05,350
I love you too.

1662
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:07,690
Kim Geon Woo, please head to your seat...

1663
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:10,490
- which is a "better chair." - "Better chair."

1664
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:11,930
- Thank you. - "Better chair."

1665
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:14,130
- Let's go! - "Better chair."

1666
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:16,900
You punk.

1667
01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:19,630
- I'll be there too. - Don't keep me waiting.

1668
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:21,840
Gosh, fourth place? That's amazing.

1669
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,439
Your pronunciation was legendary.

1670
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:25,470
Really?

1671
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:29,609
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

1672
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:33,710
(He takes his seat in 4th place.)

1673
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:38,519
Out of the Top Eight in BOYS II PLANET,

1674
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,189
the three participants at the top remain.

1675
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:43,520
It's time to announce the ones in Top Three.

1676
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:47,930
(Planet Top 8, 1st place candidate)

1677
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:49,630
The three members of Team "Chains."

1678
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:51,470
All three of them.

1679
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:53,370
Sang Fresh, Leo Fresh, and An Fresh.

1680
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:56,269
Team "Chains" did do an amazing job.

1681
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:57,470
What's up with Team "Chains?"

1682
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:59,309
Top Eight!

1683
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:03,280
The three first-place candidates will now be revealed.

1684
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:07,780
Who could they be?

1685
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:09,519
I could be one of them.

1686
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,620
Li Zi Hao could be one of them.

1687
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:12,790
The 1st place candidates of Top 8.

1688
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:14,490
Lee Sang Won,

1689
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:15,990
Lee Leo,

1690
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:17,830
and Zhou An Xin.

1691
01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:24,530
Lee Leo who can't hold his laughter once again today!

1692
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:30,200
Our team took 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 15th.

1693
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,110
What am I doing?

1694
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:34,410
We all survived though.

1695
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,210
All three of you, please step forward.

1696
01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:39,510
Let's go!

1697
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:41,380
The one in first place won't change, right?

1698
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:44,520
You never know if there will be a surprise.

1699
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:47,290
There won't be a big difference in the number of votes.

1700
01:14:47,820 --> 01:14:49,320
I think it will be quite big here.

1701
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:52,629
These three participants...

1702
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:54,830
have never lost their place in Top Eight.

1703
01:14:54,930 --> 01:14:57,760
They have also advanced to the finals at the highest ranks.

1704
01:14:58,470 --> 01:14:59,670
They're so strong.

1705
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:01,939
Following the Second Survivor Announcement,

1706
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:04,640
Lee Leo has become a first-place candidate once again.

1707
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:06,809
Once again,

1708
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:09,510
you have been called to be a first-place candidate.

1709
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:11,180
What went through your mind when that happened?

1710
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:14,650
Actually,

1711
01:15:14,651 --> 01:15:17,120
I never thought this would happen again,

1712
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,520
so I was very satisfied.

1713
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:22,560
But they let me be a candidate for first place, which is generous,

1714
01:15:22,990 --> 01:15:25,029
so I want to thank the Star Creators.

1715
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:26,130
(Is it my turn now?)

1716
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:33,670
To keep it straight, I'm really...

1717
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:36,470
honored and really thankful to you guys.

1718
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:40,140
I've never pictured myself being...

1719
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:43,910
a candidate for number 1, 2 weeks in a row.

1720
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:45,649
I just want to say you guys are the best,

1721
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:47,109
and I'll always do my best for you guys.

1722
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:48,150
Thank you.

1723
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:50,480
(Nodding for now)

1724
01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:52,019
Sang Hyeon, do you understand everything?

1725
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:53,790
Yes. Of course, I do.

1726
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:55,090
(Suspicious)

1727
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:56,990
I didn't get any of that, but it was cool.

1728
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:58,690
You sound like a foreigner.

1729
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,259
I am a foreigner.

1730
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:01,500
(Born in Australia)

1731
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:03,300
(Laughing)

1732
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,900
Yes. That's true.

1733
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:13,710
Sang Won, you've always placed first.

1734
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:15,310
Then,

1735
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:19,010
have you also...

1736
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,920
voted for yourself?

1737
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:25,119
(Sang Won...)

1738
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,650
(voted for himself?)

1739
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:30,389
I always do.

1740
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:32,189
- You always do? - Yes.

1741
01:16:32,190 --> 01:16:34,359
(Vote on Mnet Plus, our official platform.)

1742
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,100
Did you all hear that? That's how you place first.

1743
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:38,870
I always vote for myself too.

1744
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:40,430
So do I.

1745
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:41,800
I should also vote.

1746
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,700
An Xin,

1747
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:46,770
you're a candidate for number one, as always.

1748
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:50,140
How sure are you about being number one?

1749
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:52,710
To be honest...

1750
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:55,650
(Curious)

1751
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,220
I'm one percent sure.

1752
01:16:58,020 --> 01:16:59,090
One percent.

1753
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:00,790
(In the First Survivor Announcement, )

1754
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:03,590
(he sadly placed 2nd.)

1755
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,490
(Also, in the Second Survivor Announcement, )

1756
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:10,330
(he placed 2nd once again.)

1757
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:13,370
But I'm kind of looking forward to it.

1758
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:15,340
- Are you? - Yes.

1759
01:17:17,470 --> 01:17:18,540
Then,

1760
01:17:18,810 --> 01:17:22,380
I will announce the rankings of the three candidates.

1761
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:24,540
Unlike usual,

1762
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:26,650
we announce number one first.

1763
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:30,880
(1st-place candidates)

1764
01:17:30,881 --> 01:17:32,249
(1st place)

1765
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,350
Just like that?

1766
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:35,890
Are numbers 2 and 3 switching?

1767
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:37,590
It's plausible.

1768
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,129
Will it be as we expect,

1769
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:40,590
or will it change?

1770
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:45,329
In the Third Survivor Announcement, which is right before...

1771
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:47,330
the Final Live Show of announcing the debuting members,

1772
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:51,640
which participant will sit in the seat for number one?

1773
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:55,380
I give you the participant to sit in that glorious seat...

1774
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:57,110
right now.

1775
01:17:58,710 --> 01:18:01,880
Number one has overwhelming scores, as always.

1776
01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:07,820
With the total score of 8,287,830,

1777
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:11,190
he placed first.

1778
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:13,389
There's no way.

1779
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:14,759
(Geon Woo in 4th place got 3,096,619 points.)

1780
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,360
It's eight million, all of a sudden.

1781
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:18,200
How does this happen?

1782
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,570
That's impressive. Respect.

1783
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:23,199
The first-placer...

1784
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,170
of the Third Survivor Announcement is...

1785
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:27,940
Sang Won?

1786
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:30,410
Is it An Xin?

1787
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:32,980
I think it's Leo.

1788
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:36,380
(1st place)

1789
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:40,149
Lee Sang Won.

1790
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:41,919
(3rd Survivor Announcement, Top 8, 1st place, Lee Sang Won)

1791
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:42,960
Congratulations.

1792
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:44,420
He stands strong like an oak tree.

1793
01:18:45,490 --> 01:18:46,560
He still stands strong.

1794
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:48,800
He never comes down.

1795
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:51,569
In the Third Survivor Announcement as well,

1796
01:18:51,570 --> 01:18:55,770
he remained in 1st place in the Top 8 with an overwhelming score,

1797
01:18:56,170 --> 01:18:58,970
and he will advance to the Final Live Show.

1798
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:01,879
The first participant to place first the whole time...

1799
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:03,680
in the history of survival shows.

1800
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:05,779
(Sang Won, the undefeated number 1)

1801
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:07,880
(What will be his speech?)

1802
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:12,750
To me...

1803
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:15,019
(He prepared his speech in Japanese.)

1804
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:16,220
That sounds so cute.

1805
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:20,030
So much love...

1806
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:22,100
"So much love?"

1807
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:24,260
Love...

1808
01:19:26,030 --> 01:19:27,870
- "So much love." - He forgot.

1809
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:29,470
"Showing me."

1810
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,610
- "Showing me." - "Showing me."

1811
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:38,110
You can look at your note.

1812
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:43,820
(Taking it out)

1813
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:51,120
Thank you for showing me so much love.

1814
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,590
I'll work hard.

1815
01:19:52,930 --> 01:19:56,230
I'll always stay humble and keep growing.

1816
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:59,030
I love you.

1817
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:01,370
"I love you."

1818
01:20:01,770 --> 01:20:02,870
- "I love you." - "I love you."

1819
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:05,439
The Star Creators...

1820
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,710
who are sending me love...

1821
01:20:09,010 --> 01:20:14,150
when I'm standing as a candidate for first place.

1822
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:17,450
I could feel their love the most.

1823
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:18,820
Thank you.

1824
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,020
Good work.

1825
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:24,420
Sang Won in first place,

1826
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:27,360
please move to your seat.

1827
01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:32,430
Congratulations.

1828
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:34,070
Thank you.

1829
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,070
Congrats.

1830
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:37,770
Back in first place.

1831
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,340
Your ears turned red.

1832
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:47,010
(1st place)

1833
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:52,250
(He moved to the first-place seat.)

1834
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:00,130
Among the Top Eight,

1835
01:21:00,190 --> 01:21:02,900
we have the announcement for numbers 2 and 3 remaining.

1836
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:05,270
Will Leo place 2nd for the 1st time?

1837
01:21:06,030 --> 01:21:09,040
This time, we'll change the announcement method.

1838
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:13,040
I'm going to give you two...

1839
01:21:13,870 --> 01:21:16,240
these cards.

1840
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,510
You will check your card.

1841
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:21,080
The rankings are on them.

1842
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:26,049
Then, you will sit in the seat according to your ranking.

1843
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:27,550
(Numbers 2 and 3 will sit in their seats after checking them.)

1844
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:29,289
Thank you.

1845
01:21:29,290 --> 01:21:30,919
(The two participants got the cards.)

1846
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,060
This is nerve-racking.

1847
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:38,430
(The two checked their rankings.)

1848
01:21:38,830 --> 01:21:40,530
I'd be able to tell if I could see Leo's face.

1849
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:42,999
What's the result?

1850
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,739
(What does his look mean?)

1851
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:46,270
An Xin doesn't look so happy.

1852
01:21:47,070 --> 01:21:48,339
An Xin isn't so glad,

1853
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:50,040
and Leo accepts it right away.

1854
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:52,410
Did Leo place second?

1855
01:21:52,810 --> 01:21:53,910
Let's go.

1856
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:55,850
Did An Xin place third?

1857
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:57,980
What's the result?

1858
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:04,159
(He's crossing his arms. What does it mean?)

1859
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,460
I'm so curious.

1860
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:07,629
Where will they sit?

1861
01:22:07,630 --> 01:22:09,799
Which participant will sit in the second-place seat,

1862
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,730
and which participant will sit in the third-place seat?

1863
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:19,440
(What are their rankings?)

1864
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:20,840
Now,

1865
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:23,310
go to your seats!

1866
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:33,690
Go to your seats!

1867
01:22:38,490 --> 01:22:40,129
An Xin placed second,

1868
01:22:40,130 --> 01:22:42,199
and Leo placed third.

1869
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,260
Congratulations.

1870
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:44,860
Congrats.

1871
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:49,499
Zhou An Xin in second place.

1872
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:52,939
With a high score of 5,736,338,

1873
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:56,810
he placed second.

1874
01:22:57,980 --> 01:22:59,009
Seriously?

1875
01:22:59,010 --> 01:23:00,950
What is that figure? It's like they're from a different world.

1876
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:04,380
I placed second again.

1877
01:23:04,650 --> 01:23:06,990
I'm exhilarated.

1878
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:10,660
I lack in many ways,

1879
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:14,860
so I'll work harder.

1880
01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:18,530
I will not let you down.

1881
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:20,670
I'll keep working hard.

1882
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:21,970
Thank you.

1883
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:28,680
And Leo in third place.

1884
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:32,910
With a score of 4,070,925,

1885
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:35,050
he placed third.

1886
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,550
Being on this show,

1887
01:23:38,990 --> 01:23:43,160
there are many moments when you doubt yourself.

1888
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:46,390
But when I look at the ranking that I get in return,

1889
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:50,030
I realize that there are a lot of people rooting for me...

1890
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:52,099
and that I can be...

1891
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:54,799
more confident.

1892
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,640
I sincerely thank you for letting me...

1893
01:23:58,410 --> 01:24:02,180
get to the Final Live Show, which is an honorable opportunity.

1894
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:06,610
- Thank you. - Congratulations.

1895
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:09,849
We have the final Top Eight members.

1896
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:11,380
(The announcement of the new Top 8 ends.)

1897
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:14,220
The Third Survivor Announcement on BOYS II Planet.

1898
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:19,190
We've announced all the rankings from the Top 8 to 15th place.

1899
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:22,530
There is only one seat...

1900
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:25,530
for 16th place remaining.

1901
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:30,769
(Final Survivor, 16th place)

1902
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:33,409
(14th, Jang Han Eum, 16th, Kang Woo Jin)

1903
01:24:33,410 --> 01:24:35,480
(13th, Park Jun Il, 2nd Survivor Announcement Ranking)

1904
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:37,180
I wonder who it is.

1905
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:42,980
Of the nine members awaiting the announcement,

1906
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,690
only 1 participant in 16th place...

1907
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:49,960
will advance to the Final Live Show.

1908
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:53,030
Brace yourselves.

1909
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:56,730
I have a feeling it's Zi Hao.

1910
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:58,029
He's got a shot.

1911
01:24:58,030 --> 01:24:59,900
(17th, Li Zi Hao)

1912
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:01,270
I think it's Masato.

1913
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:02,270
(9th, Masato)

1914
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:06,570
Who is the last participant to advance to the Final Live Show...

1915
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:09,180
and perform in front of the Star Creators again?

1916
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:11,180
It's so hard to guess.

1917
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:12,980
I have no clue.

1918
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:16,120
The 3 candidates competing for the last spot, 16th place,

1919
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:19,690
to perform at the final match...

1920
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:22,990
will be revealed now.

1921
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:25,730
Three? My gosh.

1922
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,500
My gosh. For 16th, 17th, and 18th places?

1923
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:31,360
I think it's the three of you.

1924
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:35,170
I think you will be named.

1925
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:36,300
Stop lying.

1926
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:39,410
(20th, Na Yun Seo)

1927
01:25:42,210 --> 01:25:44,810
(The Last Survivor in 16th Place)

1928
01:25:46,210 --> 01:25:47,210
Gosh, it's those three.

1929
01:25:47,211 --> 01:25:49,519
(Candidates for the Last Survivor: Masato, Jang Han Eum, Kang Woo Jin)

1930
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:50,850
I wonder who it will be.

1931
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:56,620
This is a strong group.

1932
01:25:57,420 --> 01:26:00,330
(By default, Na Yun Seo is eliminated.)

1933
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,870
The first candidate is Masato.

1934
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:09,070
The second candidate is Jang Han Eum.

1935
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:12,610
The third candidate is Kang Woo Jin.

1936
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:15,680
Among these 3 candidates for 16th place,

1937
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:19,350
only one of them will survive and remain on the show.

1938
01:26:19,780 --> 01:26:20,810
Gosh, seriously.

1939
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:23,580
How did this happen?

1940
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:25,820
Gosh, I can't believe this.

1941
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:30,560
I will start with the participant in 18th place...

1942
01:26:30,660 --> 01:26:34,030
who will have to leave the show.

1943
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:35,330
I hate this.

1944
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,370
- This is so cruel. - Right.

1945
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:43,300
- This is tough. - This is always tough to watch.

1946
01:26:44,970 --> 01:26:46,040
It's okay.

1947
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:50,579
The participant who came close to advancing,

1948
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:51,880
but got eliminated in 18th place is...

1949
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:00,090
It's Jang Han Eum.

1950
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:04,319
(Jang Han Eum is eliminated in 18th place.)

1951
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:05,630
It's Jang Han Eum.

1952
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:11,330
Thank you.

1953
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:14,570
Good job.

1954
01:27:15,670 --> 01:27:16,940
It's very different from what I expected.

1955
01:27:18,810 --> 01:27:21,809
First of all, I was so happy...

1956
01:27:21,810 --> 01:27:24,010
to get to know everyone for the past few months.

1957
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,380
As I worked with a lot of people here,

1958
01:27:26,710 --> 01:27:29,620
I've learned so much in the end.

1959
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:32,320
Knowing that brings me a huge relief.

1960
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:34,550
I'll work harder now.

1961
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:37,560
I hope we can meet as top idol stars one day. Thank you.

1962
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:39,530
He's so cool.

1963
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:47,500
(The Last Survivor in 16th Place)

1964
01:27:47,501 --> 01:27:49,100
Only two participants remain now.

1965
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,500
I will now announce...

1966
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:56,280
the last survivor in 16th place who will remain on the show.

1967
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:57,380
(3rd Survivor Announcement)

1968
01:27:57,381 --> 01:27:59,980
(The Last Survivor in 16th Place)

1969
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:03,380
We were on the same team.

1970
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:05,420
Who do you think it will be?

1971
01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:08,090
Gosh, this one is so hard.

1972
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:09,990
Who do you think it will be?

1973
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:11,360
Masato?

1974
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:14,790
- Kang Woo Jin. - Really?

1975
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:19,570
Will Masato be in 16th place who took the killing part...

1976
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:21,730
of "Sugar HIGH" in the third mission?

1977
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:25,369
Or will Kang Woo Jin take 16th place who demonstrated stable singing...

1978
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:28,070
during the performance of "Sugar HIGH?"

1979
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,439
Why am I nervous?

1980
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:35,550
(Who will be the last survivor in 16th place?)

1981
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:36,980
The participant in 16th place is...

1982
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:43,220
It's...

1983
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:53,600
(A conflict breaks out at the beginning of their practice.)

1984
01:28:54,130 --> 01:28:55,169
(I feel insulted.)

1985
01:28:55,170 --> 01:29:01,040
(The 2nd showdown occurs in the dorm.)

1986
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:05,180
(The participants become sensitive before the final mission.)

1987
01:29:06,810 --> 01:29:07,849
(The final mission remains challenging to the end.)

1988
01:29:07,850 --> 01:29:09,480
(You can push them out.)

1989
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,319
- Gosh, this is too much. - Nice.

1990
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:13,090
- Push everyone out. - Like this.

1991
01:29:13,190 --> 01:29:14,219
Should I push you out?

1992
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:16,359
(They push and get pushed to get the song and part they want.)

1993
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:17,719
Will he be pushed out this easily?

1994
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:22,830
(They push and get pushed to get the song and part they want.)

1995
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:30,839
(For each song, 2 participants will be chosen for the killing part.)

1996
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:31,870
(To be continued)

1997
01:29:32,970 --> 01:29:35,940
I will announce the participant in 16th place.

1998
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:37,980
Why am I nervous?

1999
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:40,680
I don't know anymore.

2000
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:43,020
I think it will be Masato.

2001
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:47,489
The participant in 16th place is...

2002
01:29:47,490 --> 01:29:51,720
(Who will be the last survivor to advance to the final mission?)

2003
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:55,430
It's Kang Woo Jin.

2004
01:30:00,370 --> 01:30:01,429
It's Kang Woo Jin.

2005
01:30:01,430 --> 01:30:03,340
(Surprised)

2006
01:30:07,410 --> 01:30:10,809
(The last participant to join, Kang Woo Jin in 16th place)

2007
01:30:10,810 --> 01:30:11,880
Congratulations.

2008
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:14,050
- Good job. - Thanks.

2009
01:30:19,050 --> 01:30:20,050
Congratulations.

2010
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:23,420
I never imagined Masato not making it to the final mission.

2011
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:24,920
This makes no sense.

2012
01:30:26,490 --> 01:30:27,490
Masato...

2013
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:33,069
Participant Kang Woo Jin, you pulled off a dramatic survival,

2014
01:30:33,070 --> 01:30:34,070
holding onto the same rank...

2015
01:30:34,071 --> 01:30:35,969
from the previous announcement ceremony.

2016
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:37,370
Congratulations on your survival.

2017
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:44,010
I didn't think I would make it this time.

2018
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:49,049
So I kept thinking about what speech to give...

2019
01:30:49,050 --> 01:30:50,580
when my elimination was announced.

2020
01:30:51,150 --> 01:30:54,090
The fact that I gave up first made me feel sorry...

2021
01:30:54,190 --> 01:30:56,119
to the Star Creators...

2022
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:59,790
who believe in me more than I believe in myself.

2023
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:02,230
I will work harder for the final mission,

2024
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:05,460
so I can put on a better performance for them.

2025
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:07,030
Thank you.

2026
01:31:12,740 --> 01:31:15,540
(Woo Jin heads over to the seat for 16th place.)

2027
01:31:21,180 --> 01:31:24,050
This is not what I had in mind. Seriously.

2028
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:30,019
First of all, thank you so much.

2029
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:31,020
And...

2030
01:31:34,690 --> 01:31:37,660
first off, while being on the show,

2031
01:31:40,630 --> 01:31:42,700
I learned so much about dancing,

2032
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:46,440
and singing. These guys who are sitting here...

2033
01:31:49,610 --> 01:31:50,810
taught me so much.

2034
01:31:51,610 --> 01:31:54,880
I've grown so much as a performer...

2035
01:31:55,550 --> 01:31:56,820
from BOYS II PLANET.

2036
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:59,190
I know this isn't the end for me.

2037
01:31:59,290 --> 01:32:02,089
I'll strive harder...

2038
01:32:02,090 --> 01:32:03,860
to shine once more.

2039
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:06,960
I'll be Masato, the one who always works hard.

2040
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:09,060
Thank you so much.

2041
01:32:19,710 --> 01:32:22,480
At the Third Survivor Announcement of BOYS II PLANET,

2042
01:32:22,740 --> 01:32:26,850

Well done.

Good job.

Saying goodbye to them...

Everyone, great job.

2105
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:38,270
It was the same for me.

2106
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:44,609
You'll get another chance. There will be a place for you.

2107

Well done.

I feel relieved.

2121
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:19,850
Then why are you crying?

2122
01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:26,920
- You did such a great job. - Well done.

2123
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:30,360
Unfortunately, I got eliminated.

2124
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:32,660
I earned a lot from it.

2125
01:36:32,930 --> 01:36:34,030
It was a great opportunity.

2126
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:36,200
It will be unforgettable.

2127
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:38,030
Good job.

2128
01:36:40,230 --> 01:36:41,700
Make your debut, okay?

2129
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:44,800
- I'm sorry. - No, you did a good job.

2130
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,969
Why are you crying so much?

2131
01:36:47,970 --> 01:36:50,080
You did well.

2132
01:36:54,180 --> 01:36:56,080
- Don't suffer too much. - Okay.

2133
01:36:57,050 --> 01:36:58,250
It's okay.

2134
01:36:58,550 --> 01:37:01,920
You still have to do well without me.

2135
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:10,029
I was very happy to meet you.

2136
01:37:10,030 --> 01:37:11,059
Thank you.

2137
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:12,329
Don't say that.

2138
01:37:12,330 --> 01:37:14,169
- Are you going to cry? - No, I won't cry today.

2139
01:37:14,170 --> 01:37:16,269
Last time, I cried because my friends left.

2140
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:17,539
I'm not going to cry because I'm leaving.

2141
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:19,370
I'm leaving because I deserve it.

2142
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:22,880
(Li Zi Hao fills the farewell moment with warm laughter.)

2143
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:24,979
BOYS II PLANET is a show...

2144
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:27,710
that helped me revive.

2145
01:37:27,910 --> 01:37:29,579
I wasn't popular,

2146
01:37:29,580 --> 01:37:34,350
and I wasn't sure if I should become an idol singer or not.

2147
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:37,489
After every performance,

2148
01:37:37,490 --> 01:37:41,029
I got more and more fans.

2149
01:37:41,030 --> 01:37:43,400
It encouraged me to work harder.

2150
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:45,700
From meeting many people...

2151
01:37:48,570 --> 01:37:51,970
It helped me gain more confidence.

2152
01:37:53,510 --> 01:37:56,580
Performing on a show like this...

2153
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:03,250
It was like an unbelievable dream.

2154
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:06,749
I experienced so many things for the first time on the show.

2155
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:08,050
It made me happy.

2156
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:14,730
I made many good friends.

2157
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:19,330
Even though it was difficult,

2158
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:22,770
I had friends who could laugh with me.

2159
01:38:23,370 --> 01:38:25,940
The fact that I made such friends...

2160
01:38:26,370 --> 01:38:27,439
- We can do it. - We can do it.

2161
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:28,510
That's the biggest gain.

2162
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:34,279
Being loved by the Star Creators...

2163
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:36,580
made me very happy.

2164
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:40,920
Your nose is running, but why aren't you crying?

2165
01:38:44,620 --> 01:38:46,490
Don't cry.

2166
01:38:47,890 --> 01:38:50,999
I would like to continue working hard.

2167
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,199
I'd like to meet the guys who debut on the show...

2168
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:54,800
again on the same stage.

2169
01:38:55,530 --> 01:38:56,640
I feel confident.

2170
01:38:57,470 --> 01:38:59,040
I can't believe that this is the last time.

2171
01:38:59,810 --> 01:39:01,740
(Groaning)

2172
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,210
One, two, three.

2173
01:39:05,140 --> 01:39:06,749
- Max the power. - Max the power.

2174
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:09,149
Those who remain and those who got eliminated.

2175
01:39:09,150 --> 01:39:11,520
I hope that they all become successful.

2176
01:39:12,380 --> 01:39:14,919
I won't be able to forget it.

(3rd Survivor Announcement, 16 survivors)

2181
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:24,900
There's hardly anyone.

2182
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:26,370
There are only a few of us left.

2183
01:39:27,270 --> 01:39:29,700
This is the last time. It's finally here.

2184
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:32,140
(Only 8 seats remain for the debut group.)

2185

2188
01:39:45,450 --> 01:39:49,360
(Many participants left.)

2189
01:39:50,190 --> 01:39:55,390
(The remaining ones start their day today.)

2190
01:39:55,590 --> 01:39:57,659
I'm very grateful to those...

2191
01:39:57,660 --> 01:39:59,830
who support me.

2192
01:39:59,870 --> 01:40:01,999
I'd really like to show...

2193
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,270
what I haven't shown yet.

2194
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:05,999
I didn't expect...

2195
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,110
myself to come this far.

2196
01:40:10,210 --> 01:40:12,110
He did it. How many times must I tell you?

2197
01:40:12,710 --> 01:40:14,580
What are you talking about? I didn't do it.

2198
01:40:15,250 --> 01:40:16,479
You pressed it.

2199
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:18,720
(Due to the sound of the production crew's discussion, )

2200
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:21,090
(the interview stops momentarily.)

2201
01:40:21,490 --> 01:40:23,760
(At that moment)

2202
01:40:26,230 --> 01:40:27,689
What do you want to do?

2203
01:40:27,690 --> 01:40:28,790
(The staff member goes out to see what's going on.)

2204
01:40:32,770 --> 01:40:34,870
(That startled me.)

2205
01:40:36,140 --> 01:40:37,470
Come here.

2206
01:40:37,770 --> 01:40:38,800
Darn it.

2207
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:41,210
Darn it.

2208
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,639
I didn't. Darn it.

2209
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:47,710
(The discussion is getting more violent.)

2210
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:50,720
It feels like...

2211
01:40:50,721 --> 01:40:51,819
(Leo is being interviewed next door.)

2212
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:53,450
I told you already.

2213
01:40:58,560 --> 01:40:59,590
Hey.

2214
01:41:00,090 --> 01:41:01,290
Do I look that easy to you?

2215
01:41:03,660 --> 01:41:04,959
Are you kidding me?

2216
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:05,960
(As the sound of the crew coordinating grows louder)

2217
01:41:05,961 --> 01:41:07,730
Do I look that easy to you?

2218
01:41:08,930 --> 01:41:10,070
Do I look that easy to you?

(The participant who finished his interview is also shocked.)

2221
01:41:18,140 --> 01:41:20,750
- Are you kidding me? - Come inside.

2222
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:24,880
(That's how the morning interview ended.)

2223
01:41:26,890 --> 01:41:29,390
While I was getting interviewed,

2224
01:41:30,390 --> 01:41:31,790
the staff members got into a fight.

2225
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:32,990
What?

2226
01:41:33,090 --> 01:41:35,060
There are new members in the production crew.

2227
01:41:35,630 --> 01:41:37,130
They're like MZers.

2228
01:41:37,630 --> 01:41:38,729
(The staff members got into a fight, and they're like MZers?)

2229
01:41:38,730 --> 01:41:40,130
They were yelling outside.

2230
01:41:41,230 --> 01:41:43,069
You know what? A moment ago...

2231
01:41:43,070 --> 01:41:44,269
(The problematic Generation MZ staff member comes up.)

2232
01:41:44,270 --> 01:41:46,240
You shouldn't talk to your senior like that.

2233
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:48,640
Mind your own business.

2234
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:53,649
How dare you curse at your senior?

2235
01:41:53,650 --> 01:41:54,750
(Frozen)

2236
01:41:54,810 --> 01:41:55,950
You said that you'd do it.

2237
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:58,520
Goodness.

2238
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:01,789
You're supposed to do it.

2239
01:42:01,790 --> 01:42:03,189
You learned how to do it yesterday.

2240
01:42:03,190 --> 01:42:04,990
It's offensive.

2241
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,490
Darn it.

2242
01:42:08,990 --> 01:42:10,799
- Hey. - Why you...

2243
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:11,800
(They start to get physical.)

2244
01:42:11,801 --> 01:42:12,870
Darn it.

2245
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:15,400
Do you have a pass?

2246
01:42:15,530 --> 01:42:16,869
You don't even have a pass.

2247
01:42:16,870 --> 01:42:18,569
You can't be a staff member without a pass.

2248
01:42:18,570 --> 01:42:19,640
Don't act up.

2249
01:42:19,870 --> 01:42:22,110
- What's going on? - Don't you hear them fighting?

2250
01:42:22,270 --> 01:42:24,379
- Are they fighting? - I don't know them.

2251
01:42:24,380 --> 01:42:25,810
- What? - They aren't participants.

2252
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:27,050
Gosh.

2253
01:42:27,510 --> 01:42:28,579
- Darn it. - Oh, my.

2254
01:42:28,580 --> 01:42:30,120
(What's going on?)

2255
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:32,720
Shouldn't we stop them?

2256
01:42:34,290 --> 01:42:36,490
Don't get involved.

2257
01:42:36,590 --> 01:42:38,289
- Go ahead and hit me. - You aren't even worth...

2258
01:42:38,290 --> 01:42:39,320
Go ahead and hit me.

2259
01:42:39,630 --> 01:42:41,290
It's you who deserves a punch.

2260
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:42,790
You're shorter than me.

2261
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:44,100
Darn it.

2262
01:42:46,030 --> 01:42:47,399
You should stop them.

2263
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:49,769
- Should I stop them? - I can't get involved.

2264
01:42:49,770 --> 01:42:50,870
Let's see.

2265
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:54,670
I can't get involved in that fight.

2266
01:42:55,170 --> 01:42:57,009
- You're stronger than me. - How...

2267
01:42:57,010 --> 01:42:58,309
We should do something.

2268
01:42:58,310 --> 01:43:00,510
Please go and stop them.

2269
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,050
I'm scared.

2270
01:43:04,420 --> 01:43:05,820
(Don't be scared.)

2271
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:09,659
(By your side, )

2272
01:43:09,660 --> 01:43:11,590
(there's the wolf king.)

2273
01:43:13,330 --> 01:43:15,460
(A familiar melody is playing somewhere.)

2274
01:43:16,090 --> 01:43:19,570
Gosh, I'm so hot.

2275
01:43:21,930 --> 01:43:24,199
(We were fooled.)

2276
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:25,740
(The staff member who caused a stir all morning)

2277
01:43:28,670 --> 01:43:32,680
(The two who captivated the world after debuting as Wanna One)

2278
01:43:33,350 --> 01:43:36,210
(Master Ha Sung Woon who built his music world as a solo artist)

2279
01:43:36,780 --> 01:43:38,819
(Master Lee Dae Hwi, the lead vocalist of AB6IX...)

2280
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:40,850
(with the competence of a producer)

2281
01:43:43,860 --> 01:43:46,730
You've been working very hard,

2282
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:48,589
and you've been under stress.

2283
01:43:48,590 --> 01:43:50,229
So we did it to make you laugh.

2284
01:43:50,230 --> 01:43:52,360
- It's us who got stressed out. - We got stressed out.

2285
01:43:52,700 --> 01:43:54,769
You're very good at acting. I was really startled.

2286
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:56,199
- Their acting was... - Goodness.

2287
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:57,569
I thought that it was real.

2288
01:43:57,570 --> 01:43:58,639
By the way,

2289
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:00,670
- I thought that it was real. - did you curse at me?

2290
01:44:01,170 --> 01:44:02,940
I couldn't help but curse.

2291
01:44:03,310 --> 01:44:05,010
- So you had a lot bottled up. - No.

2292
01:44:05,710 --> 01:44:08,910
Be nice to each other when you debut, okay?

2293
01:44:08,980 --> 01:44:10,020
Okay.

2294
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:12,279
- Bye, guys. - Go and wash up.

2295
01:44:12,280 --> 01:44:14,049
- Get washed up. - Thank you.

2296
01:44:14,050 --> 01:44:16,050
(After a bit of a rowdy morning, )

2297
01:44:16,790 --> 01:44:17,790
(the two of them reenter looking neat.)

2298
01:44:17,791 --> 01:44:19,320
Hello, everyone.

2299
01:44:19,590 --> 01:44:21,890
- Hello, it's nice to meet you. - Hello.

2300
01:44:22,830 --> 01:44:24,000
Hello.

2301
01:44:24,260 --> 01:44:26,129
Although we met earlier,

2302
01:44:26,130 --> 01:44:28,200
we'll give our official greeting.

2303
01:44:28,370 --> 01:44:31,969
Hello. I'm the Planet Master of the final mission, Ha Sung Woon.

2304
01:44:31,970 --> 01:44:34,269
I'm Planet Master Lee Dae Hwi. It's nice to meet you.

2305
01:44:34,270 --> 01:44:36,979
(Welcome.)

2306
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:38,009
Hello.

2307
01:44:38,010 --> 01:44:39,310
The thing is,

2308
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:41,979
we aren't ordinary Planet Masters.

2309
01:44:41,980 --> 01:44:43,780
- We're extraordinary. - Yes.

2310
01:44:43,850 --> 01:44:46,989
That was why we made a unique entrance. How was it?

2311
01:44:46,990 --> 01:44:48,449
- It was fun. - It was fun.

2312
01:44:48,450 --> 01:44:50,560
I had so much fun too.

2313
01:44:50,860 --> 01:44:52,920
Actually, we're here...

2314
01:44:53,830 --> 01:44:57,930
to bring more anxiety to you guys.

2315
01:44:58,230 --> 01:45:00,100
We don't want that.

2316
01:45:01,070 --> 01:45:02,430
More anxiety.

2317
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:03,940
Another cause of anxiety?

2318
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:07,169
Now, shall we reveal something you're really curious about,

2319
01:45:07,170 --> 01:45:09,169
the final mission?

2320
01:45:09,170 --> 01:45:10,410
- Yes. - Yes.

2321
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:13,209
- I'm nervous. - Let's go.

2322
01:45:13,210 --> 01:45:14,949
- Let's go. - I'm nervous.

2323
01:45:14,950 --> 01:45:18,380
We'll reveal the last mission...

2324
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:20,419
for debut.

2325
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:22,089
- Okay. - Let's go.

2326
01:45:22,090 --> 01:45:23,259
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2327
01:45:23,260 --> 01:45:24,359
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2328
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:27,259
- Final Debut Battle. - Debut Battle.

2329
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:28,459
(Final Debut Battle)

2330
01:45:28,460 --> 01:45:30,800
It's the Final Debut Battle.

2331
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:32,699
For the Final Debut Battle,

2332
01:45:32,700 --> 01:45:34,529
you'll be divided into 2 groups of 8,

2333
01:45:34,530 --> 01:45:36,440
which is the number of the final debut members.

2334
01:45:36,740 --> 01:45:41,040
Your competence will be judged one last time before the debut.

2335
01:45:41,170 --> 01:45:42,710
(Nervous)

2336
01:45:42,770 --> 01:45:45,410
Since you need to show your talent to your heart's content,

2337
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:46,909
this mission...

2338
01:45:46,910 --> 01:45:49,350
will also use new songs that were made exclusively for you.

2339
01:45:50,150 --> 01:45:53,219
You listened to the new songs during the Survivor Announcement.

2340
01:45:53,220 --> 01:45:57,060
(The new songs for the final mission were revealed.)

2341
01:45:57,320 --> 01:46:00,689
Now, the full choreography videos for the new songs...

2342
01:46:00,690 --> 01:46:03,560
for the final mission will be revealed.

2343
01:46:04,130 --> 01:46:05,429
Let's go.

2344
01:46:05,430 --> 01:46:07,129
- I'm curious. - I was the most curious about it.

2345
01:46:07,130 --> 01:46:08,869
I'll decide after watching the videos.

2346
01:46:08,870 --> 01:46:11,940
This is the first new song of the Final Debut Battle.

2347
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:13,540
It's "Brat Attitude."

2348
01:46:14,810 --> 01:46:16,069
(Final mission song, "Brat Attitude")

2349
01:46:16,070 --> 01:46:17,110
Let's go.

2350
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:18,939
("Brat Attitude" is a song about paving one's own path...)

2351
01:46:18,940 --> 01:46:20,550
(with the explosive beat that's a mix of hip-hop and EDM.)

2352
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:25,150
What's that?

2353
01:46:26,020 --> 01:46:27,690
What's that?

2354
01:46:30,590 --> 01:46:32,619
The choreography for "Brat Attitude" is so cool.

2355
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:35,230
It's a song with the style I wanted.

2356
01:46:40,270 --> 01:46:41,530
I like it a lot.

2357
01:46:43,370 --> 01:46:44,899
"Brat Attitude..."

2358
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:47,740
is the song I'm determined to perform.

2359
01:46:55,850 --> 01:46:58,250
I like this one a lot.

2360
01:46:58,550 --> 01:47:01,050
Both the song and choreography are my type.

2361
01:47:01,490 --> 01:47:03,190
I was like, "It's cool. I want to do it."

2362
01:47:03,390 --> 01:47:06,830
This time, I'll show them the cuddly cat that does hip-hop.

2363
01:47:07,890 --> 01:47:09,659
Watching the choreography video makes me want the song more.

2364
01:47:09,660 --> 01:47:12,030
Who wants this song?

2365
01:47:13,770 --> 01:47:15,899
One, two, three,

2366
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:17,600
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

2367
01:47:17,970 --> 01:47:19,600
Ten? More than half want this song.

2368
01:47:20,270 --> 01:47:21,669
Without even listening to the next song?

2369
01:47:21,670 --> 01:47:22,970
I think the competition will be fierce.

2370
01:47:23,740 --> 01:47:25,240
The competition will be fierce.

2371
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:28,950
The next song is "Never Been 2 Heaven."

2372
01:47:29,110 --> 01:47:30,180
Never.

2373
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:32,819
- I'm looking forward to the song. - I like the title.

2374
01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:34,620
- "Never Been 2 Heaven." - Let's go.

2375
01:47:34,690 --> 01:47:35,690
("Never Been 2 Heaven" is about the youth's dazzling moments...)

2376
01:47:35,690 --> 01:47:36,690
(with the funky rhythm and upbeat vocal and rap.)

2377
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:41,630
- It's nice. - It's nice.

2378
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:45,130
This song is so nice.

2379
01:47:45,230 --> 01:47:46,430
I really like it.

2380
01:47:49,570 --> 01:47:50,870
It's like a musical.

2381
01:47:51,470 --> 01:47:54,439
My heart was shouting at me...

2382
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:56,010
to pick this song.

2383
01:48:00,410 --> 01:48:01,410
My goodness.

2384
01:48:01,850 --> 01:48:02,950
So happy.

2385
01:48:03,350 --> 01:48:04,450
There are many elements.

2386
01:48:08,790 --> 01:48:09,990
It's such a nice song.

2387
01:48:10,190 --> 01:48:11,990
It's really refreshing.

2388
01:48:12,820 --> 01:48:14,429
Perhaps it'll suit me.

2389
01:48:14,430 --> 01:48:16,459
I haven't had a chance to give...

2390
01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:18,899
this style of performance on BOYS II PLANET.

2391
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:20,700
So, I want to give it a go.

2392
01:48:21,100 --> 01:48:22,399
This song is really good.

2393
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,239
The choreography videos for the new songs...

2394
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:26,070
have been revealed.

2395
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:29,240
(They become more excited.)

2396
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:32,979
Did you decide on which song to perform?

2397
01:48:32,980 --> 01:48:34,980
- Yes. - Yes.

2398
01:48:35,710 --> 01:48:37,879
From the moment I listened to "Never Been 2 Heaven,"

2399
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:39,650
I've really wanted to perform it.

2400
01:48:39,990 --> 01:48:42,349
"Brat Attitude" is really cool.

2401
01:48:42,350 --> 01:48:44,059
It's number one in my mind.

2402
01:48:44,060 --> 01:48:45,520
"Never Been 2 Heaven..."

2403
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:48,329
is a style of a song that puts me under a lot of pressure.

2404
01:48:48,330 --> 01:48:51,830
I certainly wanted to choose "Brat Attitude."

2405
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,629
I think many other participants...

2406
01:48:54,630 --> 01:48:57,069
will want "Never Been 2 Heaven."

2407
01:48:57,070 --> 01:48:58,600
I'm worried about that.

2408
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:02,270
I really need to give a cool performance since it's the finals.

2409
01:49:02,570 --> 01:49:04,179
But I won't get to choose.

2410
01:49:04,180 --> 01:49:06,340
I won't get the song I want.

2411
01:49:07,150 --> 01:49:09,480
(A bit later)

2412
01:49:09,810 --> 01:49:12,620
Now comes the information you must be the most curious about,

2413
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:15,790
the method of choosing the song and the team members.

2414
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:19,060
- Are you curious? - Yes, we're very curious.

2415
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:21,589
What you see before you are...

2416
01:49:21,590 --> 01:49:24,999
the songs and their parts for the Final Debut Battle.

2417
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,130
(The songs and their parts for the Final Debut Battle)

2418
01:49:26,330 --> 01:49:28,599
The final mission will be different from the previous ones.

2419
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:30,799
The song selection and part distribution...

2420
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:33,970
will take place here at the same time.

2421
01:49:34,570 --> 01:49:38,840
The participant of the lowest rank, Kang Woo Jin,

2422
01:49:38,910 --> 01:49:41,450
will stand at the desired song and its part.

2423
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:45,550
Then the participant of the next lowest rank will go.

2424
01:49:45,850 --> 01:49:48,790
If a participant with a lower rank...

2425
01:49:48,950 --> 01:49:51,290
is standing at the place he wants,

2426
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:53,290
he can push him off.

2427
01:49:54,030 --> 01:49:55,330
People will get pushed off.

2428
01:49:55,890 --> 01:49:57,129
In that case,

2429
01:49:57,130 --> 01:49:59,500
I'll get pushed off relentlessly. I'm worried about that.

2430
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:01,469
The participant who gets pushed off...

2431
01:50:01,470 --> 01:50:04,670
won't go for another part.

2432
01:50:04,770 --> 01:50:05,870
- No? - What?

2433
01:50:06,370 --> 01:50:07,639
Will the others decide on his part?

2434
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:08,810
I think the others will decide on his part.

2435
01:50:09,270 --> 01:50:12,240
He'll go back where he came from.

2436
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:15,479
Until everyone's part is decided,

2437
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:16,649
he'll wait.

2438
01:50:16,650 --> 01:50:19,780
- My goodness. - Seriously, it's too much.

2439
01:50:20,220 --> 01:50:22,490
Once everyone else has chosen his part,

2440
01:50:22,790 --> 01:50:24,689
the participants who got pushed off...

2441
01:50:24,690 --> 01:50:27,760
will stand before their desired songs once more.

2442
01:50:27,990 --> 01:50:31,930
Then they must get chosen by the participants whose songs...

2443
01:50:32,330 --> 01:50:33,600
have been determined.

2444
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:37,040
There won't be hope if you get pushed off.

2445
01:50:37,470 --> 01:50:39,040
Not getting pushed off is important.

2446
01:50:39,340 --> 01:50:43,270
By the way, isn't the most important part missing?

2447
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:44,610
The killing part.

2448
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:48,580
That's right. The killing part is missing.

2449
01:50:49,150 --> 01:50:51,320
The killing part of the final mission...

2450
01:50:51,420 --> 01:50:53,720
won't be decided by you.

2451
01:50:54,250 --> 01:50:55,290
I knew it.

2452
01:50:55,350 --> 01:50:57,089
The killing part of the final mission...

2453
01:50:57,090 --> 01:51:00,390
will be decided by the global Star Creators' votes.

2454
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:03,259
However, not all participants...

2455
01:51:03,260 --> 01:51:05,530
will try out for the killing part.

2456
01:51:05,660 --> 01:51:06,999
- What? - What?

2457
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,269
- Then what? - Really?

2458
01:51:08,270 --> 01:51:09,430
Just the Top Eight?

2459
01:51:09,630 --> 01:51:11,269
Once the teams get decided,

2460
01:51:11,270 --> 01:51:13,239
you'll do peer review...

2461
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:16,810
and pick two killing part candidates per team.

2462
01:51:18,540 --> 01:51:21,809
Then the Star Creators will watch the killing part videos...

2463
01:51:21,810 --> 01:51:23,820
of the two candidates...

2464
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:27,620
and pick the one who suits the song's killing part better.

2465
01:51:28,150 --> 01:51:30,760
Since it's up to the Star Creators,

2466
01:51:30,890 --> 01:51:32,959
it's the true killing part.

2467
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:35,230
That's why I really want to do it this time.

2468
01:51:36,030 --> 01:51:40,500
Now, the song and part decision will begin now.

2469
01:51:41,070 --> 01:51:42,130
Where should I go?

2470
01:51:42,430 --> 01:51:43,840
What should I do?

2471
01:51:43,940 --> 01:51:45,170
Don't choose the main vocalist.

2472
01:51:46,270 --> 01:51:48,640
Sub vocalist three and up are bound to get pushed off.

2473
01:51:49,210 --> 01:51:51,580
I can hear everyone racking their brains.

2474
01:51:51,980 --> 01:51:54,350
(I have a headache.)

2475
01:51:54,680 --> 01:51:56,779
As per the last global voting,

2476
01:51:56,780 --> 01:52:00,849
the participant in 16th place, Kang Woo Jin,

2477
01:52:00,850 --> 01:52:02,090
will go first.

2478
01:52:02,250 --> 01:52:03,320
Let's go, Woo Jin.

2479
01:52:03,990 --> 01:52:06,890
Woo Jin will definitely choose "Never Been 2 Heaven," right?

2480
01:52:07,230 --> 01:52:09,030
(Revealing the mission songs)

2481
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:13,470
It has a mischievous and fun vibe.

2482
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:16,200
I wanted to perform "Never Been 2 Heaven" more.

2483
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:18,440
If it's up to me,

2484
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:20,000
I want to be the main vocalist for that team.

2485
01:52:20,540 --> 01:52:23,540
(He wanted to be the main vocalist for "Never Been 2 Heaven.")

2486
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:28,250
(Heading to the main vocalist for "Never Been 2 Heaven")

2487
01:52:31,050 --> 01:52:32,180
The main vocalist?

2488
01:52:34,820 --> 01:52:36,520
(Kang Woo Jin stops at the main vocalist part.)

2489
01:52:36,650 --> 01:52:39,259
(He moves from the main vocalist...)

2490
01:52:39,260 --> 01:52:41,830
(to the sub vocalist 5.)

2491
01:52:41,990 --> 01:52:43,729
Kang Woo Jin chose...

2492
01:52:43,730 --> 01:52:45,259
"Never Been 2 Heaven..."

2493
01:52:45,260 --> 01:52:47,900
and sub vocalist five.

2494
01:52:48,170 --> 01:52:49,770
- He won't get pushed off. - No.

2495
01:52:50,070 --> 01:52:51,270
He's really smart.

2496
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:54,009
I really wanted to be the main vocalist,

2497
01:52:54,010 --> 01:52:55,439
but I knew that I'd get pushed off.

2498
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:57,239
So I focused on the song...

2499
01:52:57,240 --> 01:52:59,280
and tried out for the sub vocalist five part.

2500
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:03,410
Jun Lee Jeong in 15th place, please go ahead.

2501
01:53:03,780 --> 01:53:05,950
He won't suddenly go to Woo Jin, will he?

2502
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:07,590
Will he push off Woo Jin?

2503
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:10,820
Lee Jeong, I'm really sorry.

2504
01:53:11,220 --> 01:53:12,420
Lee Jeong.

2505
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:13,929
I think he'll push him off.

2506
01:53:13,930 --> 01:53:16,860
(What will be Lee Jeong's choice?)

2507
01:53:18,900 --> 01:53:20,970
(He chooses sub vocalist 4 of "Never Been 2 Heaven.)

2508
01:53:21,230 --> 01:53:23,799
If I dance happily to this song...

2509
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:25,640
in the final round,

2510
01:53:25,770 --> 01:53:27,270
I'll be able...

2511
01:53:27,370 --> 01:53:30,140
to arouse feel-good energy.

2512
01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:32,079
(Lee Jeong and Woo Jin made a safe choice...)

2513
01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:33,679
(to avoid getting pushed off.)

2514
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:35,980
(Up next is Park Dong Gyu in 14th place.)

2515
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:37,880
I'll go for the part I want. I don't know.

2516
01:53:38,180 --> 01:53:40,320
I don't know. I'll leave it up to fate.

2517
01:53:40,950 --> 01:53:44,090
(When the new songs for the finals were revealed earlier, )

2518
01:53:44,260 --> 01:53:46,019
(Park Dong Gyu became obsessed...)

2519
01:53:46,020 --> 01:53:47,790
(with the sub vocalist 1 part of "Brat Attitude.")

2520
01:53:48,030 --> 01:53:49,590
Sub vocalist one is the best.

2521
01:53:49,790 --> 01:53:53,499
(But higher-ranked participants showed interest...)

2522
01:53:53,500 --> 01:53:55,330
(in the sub vocalist 1 part as well.)

2523
01:53:55,770 --> 01:53:56,900
I'm very torn.

2524
01:53:58,070 --> 01:53:59,070
Let's go.

2525
01:53:59,740 --> 01:54:00,810
Which part will Dong Gyu choose?

2526
01:54:04,580 --> 01:54:06,680
(He chooses sub vocalist 1 of "Brat Attitude.")

2527
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:09,180
To be honest, I went there thinking that I'd get pushed off.

2528
01:54:09,210 --> 01:54:11,520
Still, I liked that part the most.

2529
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:13,519
I thought I could do a good job,

2530
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:15,119
so I didn't try to think too much...

2531
01:54:15,120 --> 01:54:17,190
and just went straight for where I wanted to go.

2532
01:54:18,090 --> 01:54:19,819
Participant Kim Jun Min.

2533
01:54:19,820 --> 01:54:23,600
You have chosen first sub-rapper of "Brat Attitude."

2534
01:54:24,330 --> 01:54:28,130
Next, in 12th place, participant Chen Kai Wen. You may go.

2535
01:54:28,630 --> 01:54:30,540
I'm scared of Chen Kai Wen now.

2536
01:54:30,870 --> 01:54:32,140
I feel like I'll be pushed out.

2537
01:54:32,640 --> 01:54:34,470
(As soon as that was said, )

2538
01:54:36,470 --> 01:54:38,679
(Chen Kai Wen approaches Kim Jun Min.)

2539
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:40,380
- No. - For real?

2540
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:43,650
(Chen Kai Wen stands behind Kim Jun Min.)

2541
01:54:44,620 --> 01:54:45,880
Will he go for it?

2542
01:54:46,250 --> 01:54:48,220
(Chen Kai Wen hesitates as he stands behind.)

2543
01:54:48,390 --> 01:54:49,690
It's okay.

2544
01:54:49,890 --> 01:54:51,319
(As soon as he hears that it's okay...)

2545
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:52,360
I'm sorry.

2546
01:54:54,930 --> 01:54:57,000
(Chen Kai Wen pushes Kim Jun Min off.)

2547
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:06,040
- He was the first to be pushed off. - Yes.

2548
01:55:06,540 --> 01:55:07,809
I thought I'd get pushed off,

2549
01:55:07,810 --> 01:55:09,140
but I didn't know it would happen right away.

2550
01:55:09,640 --> 01:55:10,840
I can't help it, though.

2551
01:55:11,810 --> 01:55:13,650
There's a really cool part in the first sub-rapper part.

2552
01:55:13,780 --> 01:55:15,380
(Exhaling)

2553
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:17,580
(The part that got Chen Kai Wen hooked)

2554
01:55:19,420 --> 01:55:20,819
This part is so cool.

2555
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:23,420
So, I was drawn to it.

2556
01:55:24,090 --> 01:55:25,159
This is so scary.

2557
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:28,260
(The participants realize that anyone can get pushed out.)

2558
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:30,030
I was so surprised.

2559
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:32,030
I was really nervous.

2560
01:55:32,630 --> 01:55:33,699
The main rapper...

2561
01:55:33,700 --> 01:55:34,899
The second sub-vocalist...

2562
01:55:34,900 --> 01:55:37,370
He chose the third sub-vocalist.

2563
01:55:37,900 --> 01:55:40,909
Next, it's participant Chung Sang Hyeon in eighth place.

2564
01:55:40,910 --> 01:55:41,940
You may go.

2565
01:55:43,010 --> 01:55:44,210
Hey, Sang Hyeon...

2566
01:55:44,780 --> 01:55:46,240
might come.

2567
01:55:47,310 --> 01:55:48,950
I haven't had a good rap part so far.

2568
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:51,819
The rap parts I got were too short,

2569
01:55:51,820 --> 01:55:54,719
like a couple of measures in the second verse.

2570
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:56,190
I think that was really disappointing.

2571
01:55:57,860 --> 01:56:00,090
- The hip-hop cuddly cat. - The hip-hop cuddly cat's choice...

2572
01:56:01,630 --> 01:56:02,860
He's going to Kang Min!

2573
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:05,959
(Will Yoo Kang Min in 11th place get pushed off just like this?)

2574
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:07,169
He's going to Kang Min!

2575
01:56:07,170 --> 01:56:08,800
(Will Yoo Kang Min in 11th place get pushed off just like this?)

2576
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:10,639
Should I push you?

2577
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:12,069
- Should I push you? - No.

2578
01:56:12,070 --> 01:56:13,269
- Shouldn't I? - Please don't.

2579
01:56:13,270 --> 01:56:14,309
Should I push?

2580
01:56:14,310 --> 01:56:16,570
"Should I push or shouldn't I?"

2581
01:56:17,710 --> 01:56:19,009
What? "Should I push?"

2582
01:56:19,010 --> 01:56:20,079
(Watching the show from afar)

2583
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:22,080
(What will Chung Sang Hyeon choose?)

2584
01:56:24,550 --> 01:56:25,879
(He gives up the main rapper part...)

2585
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:27,650
(of "Never Been 2 Heaven" and moves away.)

2586
01:56:29,490 --> 01:56:31,089
(Yoo Kang Min takes a huge breath of relief.)

2587
01:56:31,090 --> 01:56:32,660
Kang Min is so relieved.

2588
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:39,059
What is this? Seriously?

2589
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:40,769
(Chung Sang Hyeon goes over to Chen Kai Wen right away.)

2590
01:56:40,770 --> 01:56:42,600
He was so surprised.

2591
01:56:43,230 --> 01:56:46,400
He's contemplating between taking the main or sub-rapper parts.

2592
01:56:47,340 --> 01:56:48,570
The cuddly cat is a total beast.

2593
01:56:49,010 --> 01:56:51,480
(The beastly cuddly cat eyes its prey.)

2594
01:56:52,110 --> 01:56:53,139
I'm sorry.

2595
01:56:53,140 --> 01:56:54,509
(Chung Sang Hyeon in 8th place chooses the 1st sub-rapper part...)

2596
01:56:54,510 --> 01:56:56,810
(in "Brat Attitude," pushing out Chen Kai Wen.)

2597
01:56:59,950 --> 01:57:01,050
That's a popular part.

2598
01:57:02,420 --> 01:57:04,219
(Already, two people have been pushed out of...)

2599
01:57:04,220 --> 01:57:09,590
(the 1st sub-rapper part of "Brat Attitude.")

2600
01:57:11,130 --> 01:57:13,429
I think Jun Min is smiling.

2601
01:57:13,430 --> 01:57:14,430
I know.

2602
01:57:14,530 --> 01:57:16,330
Can you relate to how he feels?

2603
01:57:16,900 --> 01:57:19,340
No. I wasn't happy.

2604
01:57:19,470 --> 01:57:21,710
I felt like, "I knew that part would be popular."

2605
01:57:22,510 --> 01:57:24,880
- Jun Min, you're not alone. - Yes.

2606
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:28,250
I originally wanted to be the main rapper,

2607
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:30,480
but Xin Long is above me,.

2608
01:57:30,580 --> 01:57:33,149
So even if I took the main rapper part, I knew I'd get pushed off.

2609
01:57:33,150 --> 01:57:34,920
I think that was why I chose the first sub-rapper part.

2610
01:57:35,690 --> 01:57:39,860
From now on, the pushing game seems to be starting in earnest.

2611
01:57:40,260 --> 01:57:41,260
Oh, my.

2612
01:57:41,261 --> 01:57:42,330
This is so scary.

2613
01:57:43,390 --> 01:57:47,230
Next, in sixth place, it's participant He Xin Long.

2614
01:57:47,530 --> 01:57:49,430
Participant He Xin Long, you're a rapper, right?

2615
01:57:49,730 --> 01:57:50,740
Yes.

2616
01:57:51,700 --> 01:57:56,870
(He Xin Long mainly had rap parts in previous performances.)

2617
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:00,010
Main rapper. I kept it empty.

2618
01:58:00,780 --> 01:58:02,150
I think he'll go to the main rapper part.

2619
01:58:03,150 --> 01:58:05,320
Main rapper. Please.

2620
01:58:06,350 --> 01:58:08,389
He's going towards "Brat Attitude."

2621
01:58:08,390 --> 01:58:09,749
(But He Xin Long doesn't go to the main rapper spot...)

2622
01:58:09,750 --> 01:58:11,020
(and keeps hanging around Chung Sang Hyeon.)

2623
01:58:11,490 --> 01:58:14,160
- Here... - More and more...

2624
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:15,659
Participant Chung Sang Hyeon...

2625
01:58:15,660 --> 01:58:17,829
You happily pushed someone else off when it was your turn.

2626
01:58:17,830 --> 01:58:19,129
- I know. - But now,

2627
01:58:19,130 --> 01:58:21,000
he must've thought that he would be in danger.

2628
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:23,530
Should I go?

2629
01:58:24,370 --> 01:58:26,039
- Sorry. - Be careful as you step down.

2630
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:27,639
(Chung Sang Hyeon is out. He Xin Long, in 6th place, )

2631
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:29,370
(chooses the 1st sub-rapper part in "Brat Attitude.")

2632
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:33,610
Sang Hyeon is being pushed out?

2633
01:58:34,480 --> 01:58:35,680
- This is scary. - What is going on?

2634
01:58:36,380 --> 01:58:39,179
(The number of Pushed-off Princes goes up to 3.)

2635
01:58:39,180 --> 01:58:40,380
First sub-rapper!

2636
01:58:41,220 --> 01:58:42,620
That rap part.

2637
01:58:43,190 --> 01:58:44,890
Xin Long pushed me off.

2638
01:58:45,120 --> 01:58:46,560
He should've taken the main rapper part.

2639
01:58:46,890 --> 01:58:48,959
The reason why I chose the first sub-rapper part was...

2640
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:52,560
because I wanted to do it along with the killing part.

2641
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:55,200
The main rapper and killing part...

2642
01:58:55,630 --> 01:58:57,940
They overlap way too much in the beginning and end.

2643
01:58:57,970 --> 01:59:00,940
It would be hard in terms of the movement too.

2644
01:59:01,240 --> 01:59:04,980
So, I wanted to do the killing part and the first sub-rapper part.

2645
01:59:06,010 --> 01:59:09,109
Next, in fifth place, it's participant Zhang Jia Hao.

2646
01:59:09,110 --> 01:59:10,110
You may go.

2647
01:59:10,620 --> 01:59:11,920
Let's push Xin Long off.

2648
01:59:12,580 --> 01:59:13,950
If he really pushes Xin Long off, it'll seriously...

2649
01:59:15,020 --> 01:59:19,290
(But Zhang Jia Hao really approaches He Xin Long.)

2650
01:59:19,460 --> 01:59:20,790
(For real?)

2651
01:59:20,890 --> 01:59:22,360
Is he being pushed off right away?

2652
01:59:22,460 --> 01:59:24,500
Why is this part so popular? It's as popular as Seongsu-dong.

2653
01:59:24,660 --> 01:59:26,800
(What will Zhang Jia Hao choose?)

2654
01:59:27,130 --> 01:59:28,130
Okay.

2655
01:59:30,130 --> 01:59:31,939
Participant Zhang Jia Hao...

2656
01:59:31,940 --> 01:59:35,570
chose the main rapper part in "Brat Attitude."

2657
01:59:36,370 --> 01:59:40,010
Next, in fourth place, participant Kim Geon Woo.

2658
01:59:40,780 --> 01:59:43,150
He has come to the "Never Been 2 Heaven" side.

2659
01:59:44,750 --> 01:59:46,220
Hang on. Hey!

2660
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:49,620
Okay, will participant Yumeki get pushed off?

2661
01:59:50,190 --> 01:59:52,159
Having been pushed off... Well...

2662
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:53,319
- They are... - There's nothing to lose.

2663
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:54,490
Just push everyone!

2664
01:59:54,860 --> 01:59:56,530
- Just push them all off! - Like this.

2665
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:58,000
- Push them all! - This is...

2666
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:00,870
Yumeki, I'm sorry.

2667
02:00:01,470 --> 02:00:02,529
Yumeki, I'm sorry.

2668
02:00:02,530 --> 02:00:03,969
(Yumeki is out. Kim Geon Woo chooses the 3rd sub-vocalist part.)

2669
02:00:03,970 --> 02:00:05,400
- Oh, dear. - Bye.

2670
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:08,110
Oh, dear.

2671
02:00:08,870 --> 02:00:10,410
Master!

2672
02:00:10,780 --> 02:00:12,080
- What do I do? - What will happen?

2673
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:13,710
It's so cruel.

2674
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:15,410
I was really upset.

2675
02:00:16,050 --> 02:00:18,980
Actually, the three guys in front of me are all vocalists.

2676
02:00:19,250 --> 02:00:21,949
Even if I take the 1st or 2nd sub-vocalist parts,

2677
02:00:21,950 --> 02:00:24,519
I could be pushed off, for sure. Because of those thoughts,

2678
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:26,820
I chose the third sub-vocalist part.

2679
02:00:27,390 --> 02:00:29,260
But the choreography for this...

2680
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:32,330
There was something like this.

2681
02:00:33,060 --> 02:00:34,529
(A cute signature dance move...)

2682
02:00:34,530 --> 02:00:36,670
(in the chorus of "Never Been 2 Heaven")

2683
02:00:36,970 --> 02:00:39,470
I am a little worried,

2684
02:00:39,670 --> 02:00:42,540
but what can I do? I'll have to try hard and make it work.

2685
02:00:43,770 --> 02:00:46,780
In third place, participant Lee Leo. You may go.

2686
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:48,750
- I'm curious about Leo. - What will happen?

2687
02:00:49,250 --> 02:00:52,480
Lee Leo has been talked about for his main vocalist role.

2688
02:00:52,950 --> 02:00:56,119
(Lee Leo left a strong impression with his main vocalist parts...)

2689
02:00:56,120 --> 02:00:58,660
(in past performances.)

2690
02:01:00,020 --> 02:01:02,990
Right now, the main vocalist parts are empty for both songs, Leo.

2691
02:01:04,330 --> 02:01:06,030
I hope you choose wisely.

2692
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:08,600
(What will Lee Leo choose?)

2693
02:01:09,530 --> 02:01:10,970
He's going towards "Never Been 2 Heaven."

2694
02:01:13,370 --> 02:01:14,970
- Have you decided? - Yes.

2695
02:01:15,240 --> 02:01:16,570
He didn't choose the main vocalist part.

2696
02:01:16,870 --> 02:01:20,010
He chose the 1st sub-vocalist part in "Never Been 2 Heaven."

2697
02:01:20,710 --> 02:01:24,080
Originally, I was going to choose the main vocalist part,

2698
02:01:24,220 --> 02:01:26,249
but An Xin was the person after me.

2699
02:01:26,250 --> 02:01:28,790
He said he'd go for the main vocalist part.

2700
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:31,460
(Before choosing the mission song)

2701
02:01:32,120 --> 02:01:33,759
(An Xin tries singing "Never Been 2 Heaven...")

2702
02:01:33,760 --> 02:01:35,690
(as soon as he hears it.)

2703
02:01:36,390 --> 02:01:37,630
Are you going to do the main vocalist part?

2704
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:39,130
I want to go for the main vocalist part too.

2705
02:01:39,530 --> 02:01:41,470
- Can you do a good job? - Of course.

2706
02:01:42,470 --> 02:01:44,369
He could push me off in this situation.

2707
02:01:44,370 --> 02:01:47,300
I had no choice but to go to the first sub-vocalist part.

2708
02:01:48,310 --> 02:01:51,709
Also, all of the performances I've given on BOYS II PLANET...

2709
02:01:51,710 --> 02:01:56,180
have been sexy, dark, and cool.

2710
02:01:57,050 --> 02:02:00,690
I thought I should do something entirely different.

2711
02:02:01,220 --> 02:02:02,619
Honestly, I feel lost too.

2712
02:02:02,620 --> 02:02:04,060
I haven't done anything like this before.

2713
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:06,690
So, I think I should try hard.

2714
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:08,489
- Let's go. - An Xin.

2715
02:02:08,490 --> 02:02:10,389
(Next up, it's Zhou An Xin in 2nd place.)

2716
02:02:10,390 --> 02:02:12,800
What? He has decided. Oh, that is...

2717
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:15,900
"Never Been 2 Heaven."

2718
02:02:16,630 --> 02:02:18,640
He chose the main vocalist part.

2719
02:02:20,240 --> 02:02:23,940
I want to show a refreshing and cute vibe.

2720
02:02:25,110 --> 02:02:26,110
(A preview of his cuteness)

2721
02:02:28,910 --> 02:02:30,350
You've waited for a long time.

2722
02:02:30,720 --> 02:02:33,719
In 1st place, participant Lee Sang Won. You may go.

2723
02:02:33,720 --> 02:02:35,290
(Lastly, in 1st place, Lee Sang Won sets off.)

2724
02:02:35,590 --> 02:02:36,790
This is so scary.

2725
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:38,560
Over here?

2726
02:02:39,220 --> 02:02:41,330
- Striding over? - Oh, he's striding over.

2727
02:02:41,460 --> 02:02:44,030
(What will Lee Sang Won choose?)

2728
02:02:45,830 --> 02:02:48,600
Will he go for the main vocalist part?

2729
02:02:49,670 --> 02:02:50,800
Main vocalist?

2730
02:02:54,510 --> 02:02:56,170
(A legal U-turn)

2731
02:02:56,770 --> 02:02:59,040
He made a U-turn!

2732
02:02:59,540 --> 02:03:01,149
- He made a U-turn! - A U-turn.

2733
02:03:01,150 --> 02:03:02,309
(His heart drops.)

2734
02:03:02,310 --> 02:03:04,320
- He did a U-turn at the end. - He knows show business.

2735
02:03:05,180 --> 02:03:08,590
(What will Lee Sang Won really choose?)

2736
02:03:09,790 --> 02:03:11,359
Okay, participant Lee Sang Won...

2737
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:15,190
chose the second sub-vocalist part in "Never Been 2 Heaven."

2738
02:03:15,530 --> 02:03:18,600
This time, I really wanted to try a song with a refreshing vibe.

2739
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:23,470
(So far, Lee Sang Won has been doing songs with strong concepts.)

2740
02:03:26,540 --> 02:03:29,870
I think I wanted to show the Star Creators...

2741
02:03:30,240 --> 02:03:33,640
that I could do this well in a song like this.

2742
02:03:34,510 --> 02:03:37,580
With that, the first team selection is over.

2743
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:39,979
There are participants who were pushed off...

2744
02:03:39,980 --> 02:03:43,020
due to their low ranks and don't have songs and parts yet.

2745
02:03:43,220 --> 02:03:46,060
Please move to the song that you'd like to sing.

2746
02:03:46,820 --> 02:03:49,760
(Chung Sang Hyeon and Yumeki choose "Brat Attitude.")

2747
02:03:50,230 --> 02:03:51,529
(Chen Kai Wen chooses "Never Been 2 Heaven...")

2748
02:03:51,530 --> 02:03:53,460
(in the 2nd song selection.)

2749
02:03:53,660 --> 02:03:56,729
(Meanwhile, Kim Jun Min is still contemplating.)

2750
02:03:56,730 --> 02:03:58,369
The main vocalist part is still open over there...

2751
02:03:58,370 --> 02:03:59,770
and the 2nd and 3rd sub-rapper parts.

2752
02:04:00,070 --> 02:04:01,670
The sub-rapper part is open for this song.

2753
02:04:02,040 --> 02:04:04,740
If I go over here, it felt like I should do the main vocalist part.

2754
02:04:05,010 --> 02:04:06,240
That felt like too much pressure.

2755
02:04:06,940 --> 02:04:08,610
- I think this is right. - Okay.

2756
02:04:08,910 --> 02:04:10,410
It's divided into 2 against 2 for now.

2757
02:04:13,750 --> 02:04:14,789
Come on.

2758
02:04:14,790 --> 02:04:18,320
(Team "Never Been 2 Heaven" chose Kim Jun Min after discussing.)

2759
02:04:18,490 --> 02:04:22,630
Now, we'll decide the parts for "Brat Attitude."

2760
02:04:23,990 --> 02:04:25,399
You're going there.

2761
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:26,599
You're going to go there.

2762
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:30,170
(Yumeki in 9th place chooses sub-rapper 3.)

2763
02:04:30,370 --> 02:04:33,869
Chen Kai Wen automatically becomes...

2764
02:04:33,870 --> 02:04:36,539
the main vocalist for "Brat Attitude."

2765
02:04:36,540 --> 02:04:38,040
(He's in despair.)

2766
02:04:41,610 --> 02:04:44,080
You can do it, Kai Wen.

2767
02:04:48,290 --> 02:04:50,859
I've never been a main vocalist.

2768
02:04:50,860 --> 02:04:55,360
So I'm worried if I would be able to do well.

2769
02:04:55,960 --> 02:04:57,029
("Brat Attitude" Chen Kai Wen: main vocalist, )

2770
02:04:57,030 --> 02:04:58,099
(Park Dong Gyu: sub-vocalist 1,)

2771
02:04:58,100 --> 02:04:59,159
(Chuei Li Yu: sub-vocalist 2, Kim Jun Seo: sub-vocalist 3,)

2772
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:00,229
(Zhang Jia Hao: main rapper, He Xin Long: sub-rapper 1,)

2773
02:05:00,230 --> 02:05:01,269
(Chung Sang Hyeon: sub-rapper 2, Yumeki: sub-rapper 3)

2774
02:05:01,270 --> 02:05:02,299
(Zhou An Xin: main vocalist, Lee Leo: sub-vocalist 1,)

2775
02:05:02,300 --> 02:05:04,099
(Lee Sang Won: sub-vocalist 2, Kim Geon Woo: sub-vocalist 3)

2776
02:05:04,100 --> 02:05:05,100
(Jun Lee Jeong: sub-vocalist 4, Kang Woo Jin: sub-vocalist 5,)

2777
02:05:05,101 --> 02:05:06,170
(Yoo Kang Min: main rapper, Kim Jun Min: sub-rapper)

2778
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:08,010
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2779
02:05:08,540 --> 02:05:10,210
This is our last practice room.

2780
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:12,979
- The last practice room. - Our last practice room...

2781
02:05:12,980 --> 02:05:15,680
What's this?

2782
02:05:16,810 --> 02:05:17,920
There's a doll as well.

2783
02:05:18,180 --> 02:05:19,520
(There's a cute doll in Team Brat Attitude's practice room.)

2784
02:05:19,880 --> 02:05:21,619
(There's one here as well.)

2785
02:05:21,620 --> 02:05:22,719
(Team "Never Been 2 Heaven" 's practice room)

2786
02:05:22,720 --> 02:05:24,360
What's this cute doll?

2787
02:05:25,390 --> 02:05:27,989
- Why is it so cute? - It's so cute.

2788
02:05:27,990 --> 02:05:29,059
(Who are these cute friends?)

2789
02:05:29,060 --> 02:05:30,359
It's so cute.

2790
02:05:30,360 --> 02:05:31,600
It has a mic too.

2791
02:05:31,700 --> 02:05:33,699
(Mic)

2792
02:05:33,700 --> 02:05:35,029
Is this our team's character?

2793
02:05:35,030 --> 02:05:37,299
It's red. It's...

2794
02:05:37,300 --> 02:05:38,370
Planet C.

2795
02:05:38,570 --> 02:05:41,140
(A bandana in the same color as BOYS II PLANET C)

2796
02:05:42,810 --> 02:05:44,510
Shall we give it a cute name?

2797
02:05:45,440 --> 02:05:46,479
Well...

2798
02:05:46,480 --> 02:05:47,510
(Thinking)

2799
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:53,980
Since our song title is "Brat Attitude," Atti?

2800
02:05:54,080 --> 02:05:55,919
Shall we go with Atti? That's cute.

2801
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:57,019
- Atti? - Let's go with Atti.

2802
02:05:57,020 --> 02:05:58,989
- Atti. - Atti.

2803
02:05:58,990 --> 02:06:00,689
Atti as the song title is "Brat Attitude."

2804
02:06:00,690 --> 02:06:01,959
- Okay. - That's cute.

2805
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:02,960
Nice.

2806
02:06:02,961 --> 02:06:04,499
Shall we name it?

2807
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:05,600
- Name? - Yes.

2808
02:06:05,700 --> 02:06:07,000
What should we name it?

2809
02:06:07,300 --> 02:06:09,700
Heavenie, like pretty.

2810
02:06:09,800 --> 02:06:10,800
That's nice.

2811
02:06:11,570 --> 02:06:12,570
Yevenie?

2812
02:06:13,170 --> 02:06:16,770
Yevenie?

2813
02:06:17,110 --> 02:06:18,180
It has four fingers.

2814
02:06:19,110 --> 02:06:20,740
Eight fingers.

2815
02:06:21,150 --> 02:06:22,580
It has eight fingers.

2816
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:24,849
- That's the same as us. - Eight.

2817
02:06:24,850 --> 02:06:26,179
It sounds like a group.

2818
02:06:26,180 --> 02:06:27,989
- Eight fingers. - Efing.

2819
02:06:27,990 --> 02:06:28,990
Efing sounds nice.

2820
02:06:28,991 --> 02:06:30,419
Efing, short for eight fingers.

2821
02:06:30,420 --> 02:06:32,320
- Efing sounds nice. - Do you like it as well?

2822
02:06:32,720 --> 02:06:34,459
- He likes it. - He likes it.

2823
02:06:34,460 --> 02:06:35,989
- Okay. - Nice to meet you.

2824
02:06:35,990 --> 02:06:36,990
Congratulations.

2825
02:06:37,290 --> 02:06:41,130
(Please take care of us well.)

2826
02:06:41,300 --> 02:06:43,029
Shall we select a leader?

2827
02:06:43,030 --> 02:06:44,030
- Okay. - Okay.

2828
02:06:44,540 --> 02:06:46,699
(Who...)

2829
02:06:46,700 --> 02:06:48,910
(will be the leader?)

2830
02:06:51,080 --> 02:06:53,580
I recommend myself.

2831
02:06:54,040 --> 02:06:57,150
I came to the finals, and what I regret...

2832
02:06:57,720 --> 02:06:59,780
is that I haven't been a leader.

2833
02:07:00,620 --> 02:07:03,120
We should first pick a leader.

2834
02:07:04,050 --> 02:07:06,689
(He Xin Long gave Kim Geon Woo the leader position...)

2835
02:07:06,690 --> 02:07:09,330
(during the 2nd mission.)

2836
02:07:09,660 --> 02:07:13,259
So I want to create...

2837
02:07:13,260 --> 02:07:17,200
good memories and a good performance with my team members this time.

2838
02:07:17,800 --> 02:07:19,199
- Okay. - Good.

2839
02:07:19,200 --> 02:07:20,200
Good.

2840
02:07:21,140 --> 02:07:24,980
I can lead the team performance-wise,

2841
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:26,909
and I'm also the oldest here.

2842
02:07:26,910 --> 02:07:29,150
- Right. - I'll take care...

2843
02:07:29,350 --> 02:07:33,320
of all my cute brothers with responsibility.

2844
02:07:33,880 --> 02:07:35,619
(How will Team "Brat Attitude" select their leader?)

2845
02:07:35,620 --> 02:07:37,589
Say the members are not practicing.

2846
02:07:37,590 --> 02:07:39,689
How will the leaders react?

2847
02:07:39,690 --> 02:07:41,860
Why don't we do a role play with that situation?

2848
02:07:42,190 --> 02:07:44,060
- I like that. - I think that's good.

2849
02:07:44,260 --> 02:07:47,360
(The 2 leader candidates will have a quick role play test!)

2850
02:07:47,460 --> 02:07:48,899
(Leader candidate 1, He Xin Long)

2851
02:07:48,900 --> 02:07:52,369
It's really hard for me, Xin Long.

2852
02:07:52,370 --> 02:07:53,540
I don't want to do this.

2853
02:07:55,670 --> 02:07:57,270
He lies down like this.

2854
02:07:57,670 --> 02:08:00,640
(What will He Xin Long, the leader candidate, do?)

2855
02:08:01,950 --> 02:08:06,449
I will never let anyone do that.

2856
02:08:06,450 --> 02:08:07,819
(He's serious.)

2857
02:08:07,820 --> 02:08:08,820
I...

2858
02:08:10,650 --> 02:08:14,220
will bring a blanket and pillow for him right away.

2859
02:08:16,060 --> 02:08:17,960
For better sleep.

2860
02:08:18,730 --> 02:08:21,070
(Leader candidate 1 He Xin Long even takes care of their sleep.)

2861
02:08:21,900 --> 02:08:23,899
That's because this is the final performance.

2862
02:08:23,900 --> 02:08:26,369
We have to maintain a good condition.

2863
02:08:26,370 --> 02:08:27,399
That's a twist.

2864
02:08:27,400 --> 02:08:30,110
I'll even give you a massage.

2865
02:08:30,310 --> 02:08:32,840
- That's a good twist. - I'll be nice to him.

2866
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:36,180
I'll say, "Let's practice after five minutes," and go.

2867
02:08:36,610 --> 02:08:37,820
(Let's practice after 5 minutes.)

2868
02:08:39,750 --> 02:08:40,779
That's nice.

2869
02:08:40,780 --> 02:08:43,249
I'll be a caring leader.

2870
02:08:43,250 --> 02:08:44,320
A caring leader.

2871
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:46,020
(Leader candidate 2, Yumeki)

2872
02:08:47,190 --> 02:08:49,590
This isn't correct.

2873
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:50,990
Do you want to leave?

2874
02:08:52,100 --> 02:08:53,659
Guys.

2875
02:08:53,660 --> 02:08:54,769
(Yumeki, the leader candidate, goes to the fighting members.)

2876
02:08:54,770 --> 02:08:56,529
Did something happen?

2877
02:08:56,530 --> 02:08:58,899
He's being weird.

2878
02:08:58,900 --> 02:09:00,470
I just don't like this.

2879
02:09:00,900 --> 02:09:02,239
I was just staying quiet,

2880
02:09:02,240 --> 02:09:04,239
and he suddenly hit me.

2881
02:09:04,240 --> 02:09:05,710
If you're having a hard time...

2882
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:09,309
(What will Yumeki, the leader candidate, do?)

2883
02:09:09,310 --> 02:09:11,920
If you're having a hard time, I'll give you some snacks.

2884
02:09:12,980 --> 02:09:15,319
- A leader who gives snacks. - Giving snacks.

2885
02:09:15,320 --> 02:09:17,750
- Snacks for Chung Sang Hyeon. - Today,

2886
02:09:17,860 --> 02:09:21,189
we'll cover our part for 30 minutes and go home.

2887
02:09:21,190 --> 02:09:22,229
Okay.

2888
02:09:22,230 --> 02:09:24,660
Let's do it efficiently.

2889
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:28,030
(The quick role play test for the 2 leader candidates end.)

2890
02:09:28,200 --> 02:09:29,729
We'll announce the results.

2891
02:09:29,730 --> 02:09:33,440
The leader of Team "Brat Attitude..."

2892
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:38,140
(Who will be the leader of Team Brat Attitude?)

2893
02:09:38,980 --> 02:09:41,850
is Yumeki.

2894
02:09:42,350 --> 02:09:43,380
Thank you.

2895
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:46,850
Those who want Xin Long to be the leader, raise your hands.

2896
02:09:47,580 --> 02:09:49,750
Those who want Yumeki to be the leader, raise your hands.

2897
02:09:50,090 --> 02:09:52,319
I liked the blanket,

2898
02:09:52,320 --> 02:09:54,860
but Yumeki said he would give me snacks.

2899
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:57,360
I chose Yumeki because I wanted the snacks.

2900
02:09:57,730 --> 02:10:00,100
- Congratulations. - Please take good care of us.

2901
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:01,769
(The members of Team Brat Attitude congratulate him.)

2902
02:10:01,770 --> 02:10:02,800
Thank you.

2903
02:10:03,470 --> 02:10:04,739
(Team "Brat Attitude" 's leader selection ends.)

2904
02:10:04,740 --> 02:10:06,039
(Leader: Yumeki)

2905
02:10:06,040 --> 02:10:07,040
- Okay. - Let's go.

2906
02:10:07,041 --> 02:10:08,370
We're left with the killing part.

2907
02:10:08,910 --> 02:10:10,810
You will run an internal evaluation...

2908
02:10:10,910 --> 02:10:14,510
and select two candidates for the killing part position.

2909
02:10:14,780 --> 02:10:18,049
The Star Creators will watch the videos...

2910
02:10:18,050 --> 02:10:19,720
of the two killing part candidates of each team...

2911
02:10:20,280 --> 02:10:22,719
will decide the killing part...

2912
02:10:22,720 --> 02:10:24,090
that suits the song better.

2913
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:30,189
Then, shall we watch the killing part?

2914
02:10:30,190 --> 02:10:31,200
Yes.

2915
02:10:31,460 --> 02:10:33,460
Which part should we practice?

2916
02:10:36,500 --> 02:10:41,100
(The killing part of "Brat Attitude")

2917
02:10:43,670 --> 02:10:45,310
I wanted to try the killing part.

2918
02:10:46,610 --> 02:10:47,840
This part is so cool.

2919
02:10:49,180 --> 02:10:51,879
The song was a hip-hop song,

2920
02:10:51,880 --> 02:10:54,480
so I thought I would have to take the killing part.

2921
02:10:54,820 --> 02:10:55,920
I'm confident.

2922
02:10:56,020 --> 02:10:57,889
It's my kind of song.

2923
02:10:57,890 --> 02:11:00,490
If I show them properly, they will choose me.

2924
02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:05,200
(He Xin Long gets surprised after seeing something.)

2925
02:11:05,400 --> 02:11:07,430
Why is my part 13 seconds?

2926
02:11:09,900 --> 02:11:13,700
(He took the sub-rapper 1 position after pushing out Chung Sang Hyeon.)

2927
02:11:14,710 --> 02:11:17,410
I chose to be sub-rapper one...

2928
02:11:17,870 --> 02:11:22,110
because I wanted to do the killing part as well.

2929
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:25,650
(He chose to be sub-rapper 1 to take the killing part.)

2930
02:11:26,280 --> 02:11:28,290
I forgot to check the duration.

2931
02:11:29,290 --> 02:11:31,790
(I didn't think my part would be 13 seconds long.)

2932
02:11:32,220 --> 02:11:35,690
(He is reminded of his 4-second part.)

2933
02:11:35,930 --> 02:11:38,560
I was so flustered. I'd be doomed if I don't get the killing part.

2934
02:11:40,660 --> 02:11:43,300
(He Xin Long starts practicing the killing part.)

2935
02:11:45,240 --> 02:11:47,540
You can do this move two times and jump right away.

2936
02:11:55,480 --> 02:11:58,750
(Park Dong Gyu has memorized the choreography in 10 minutes.)

2937
02:12:02,290 --> 02:12:04,660
I tend to be quick in learning the choreography,

2938
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:06,860
but other teammates were quicker.

2939
02:12:07,560 --> 02:12:09,090
So I felt anxious.

2940
02:12:14,360 --> 02:12:16,130
He's done learning the choreography? So quickly?

2941
02:12:16,470 --> 02:12:17,969
Did he really learn it so quickly?

2942
02:12:17,970 --> 02:12:19,400
That's impossible.

2943
02:12:19,640 --> 02:12:20,870
He really learned it all?

2944
02:12:23,210 --> 02:12:25,380
(About 10 minutes ago)

2945
02:12:25,580 --> 02:12:27,840
(Park Dong Gyu watches the choreography video.)

2946
02:12:28,910 --> 02:12:32,250
I tend to be fast in learning the choreography.

2947
02:12:34,250 --> 02:12:38,020
I think I learned it in five minutes and started practicing.

2948
02:12:39,090 --> 02:12:40,920
I learned it all.

2949
02:12:41,190 --> 02:12:42,690
Did you watch the part after this?

2950
02:12:47,730 --> 02:12:50,730
I think Dong Gyu did the best.

2951
02:12:51,270 --> 02:12:54,470
So I was a bit worried.

2952
02:12:55,610 --> 02:12:58,210
They were all great dancers.

2953
02:12:58,780 --> 02:13:00,940
I think I'm worried...

2954
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:03,680
because of Yumeki and Jia Hao.

2955
02:13:04,510 --> 02:13:07,880
(A subtle tension was in the air among the participants.)

2956
02:13:09,090 --> 02:13:11,789
I really want to get the killing part.

2957
02:13:11,790 --> 02:13:13,590
(Zhang Jia Hao practiced silently.)

2958
02:13:13,990 --> 02:13:15,030
Okay.

2959
02:13:16,060 --> 02:13:17,090
I'm done.

2960
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:20,300
While practicing,

2961
02:13:20,700 --> 02:13:24,969
I could get used to it quicker than I thought.

2962
02:13:24,970 --> 02:13:27,470
That raised my confidence.

2963
02:13:27,870 --> 02:13:29,640
(Maximum confidence level)

2964
02:13:30,010 --> 02:13:31,639
It's really cool.

2965
02:13:31,640 --> 02:13:33,080
It's similar to this.

2966
02:13:33,840 --> 02:13:35,450
- Great. - You're the best.

2967
02:13:36,410 --> 02:13:39,450
You're next to the best.

2968
02:13:46,390 --> 02:13:48,960
Since the signal song, I became the candidate...

2969
02:13:49,230 --> 02:13:52,400
for the killing part five times.

2970
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:57,170
(He tried to get the killing part in every mission.)

2971
02:13:57,730 --> 02:14:00,400
But I've never succeeded in getting it.

2972
02:14:01,910 --> 02:14:03,640
I don't know.

2973
02:14:03,740 --> 02:14:06,740
I'm always left with that one step.

2974
02:14:08,910 --> 02:14:10,580
But that one step...

2975
02:14:10,910 --> 02:14:13,150
- Let's do this. - Yes.

2976
02:14:13,580 --> 02:14:15,090
I've never been able to take that step.

2977
02:14:17,050 --> 02:14:18,290
It was very disappointing.

2978
02:14:23,590 --> 02:14:28,130
I wonder if I've been too desperate.

2979
02:14:28,730 --> 02:14:30,729
I also want the killing part.

2980
02:14:30,730 --> 02:14:33,540
(He desperately wanted it every time.)

2981
02:14:34,640 --> 02:14:36,569
My dance didn't suit the song...

2982
02:14:36,570 --> 02:14:38,910
because it screamed, "Please."

2983
02:14:39,740 --> 02:14:44,349
Perhaps that kept my dance from being suitable for the song.

2984
02:14:44,350 --> 02:14:46,780
Thus, I danced in a more relaxed way this time...

2985
02:14:47,820 --> 02:14:50,550
with the thought of showing what I can do well.

2986
02:14:51,860 --> 02:14:53,959
I'll do the killing part...

2987
02:14:53,960 --> 02:14:56,030
for the final performance.

2988
02:14:56,590 --> 02:15:00,600
I'll give a cool final performance...

2989
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:02,400
that'll surprise everyone.

2990
02:15:03,470 --> 02:15:06,339
I'll be passionate for the final performance.

2991
02:15:06,340 --> 02:15:08,640
"If I can't get it here, I won't get it anywhere."

2992
02:15:08,840 --> 02:15:12,110
(Who will get the killing part of "Brat Attitude?")

2993
02:15:13,910 --> 02:15:16,509
Now, shall we choose the leader?

2994
02:15:16,510 --> 02:15:17,510
- Okay. - Okay.

2995
02:15:17,750 --> 02:15:20,020
Does anyone want to be the leader?

2996
02:15:26,290 --> 02:15:27,420
It's about time I become one.

2997
02:15:28,890 --> 02:15:31,059
- He raised his hand right away. - Jun-miney.

2998
02:15:31,060 --> 02:15:32,200
Seriously, it's about time I become one.

2999
02:15:33,160 --> 02:15:36,400
(The leader of WHIB, Kim Jun Min)

3000
02:15:37,870 --> 02:15:41,869
(He attempted to be the leader during the 2nd mission, )

3001
02:15:41,870 --> 02:15:43,740
(but lost the competition.)

3002
02:15:43,910 --> 02:15:44,940
Jun-miney.

3003
02:15:45,310 --> 02:15:46,940
Jun Min, why don't you persuade us?

3004
02:15:47,680 --> 02:15:48,709
(The team members aren't easy to appease.)

3005
02:15:48,710 --> 02:15:50,209
- His ability to handle things. - That's right.

3006
02:15:50,210 --> 02:15:51,349
His ability to handle an emergency.

3007
02:15:51,350 --> 02:15:52,779
- He needs to handle things. - That's right.

3008
02:15:52,780 --> 02:15:53,950
- Let's see if he can do it. - How cool.

3009
02:15:53,980 --> 02:15:56,050
(Thus began a test on Kim Jun Min's leadership.)

3010
02:15:56,490 --> 02:15:58,050
- Let's complain. - Let's do it.

3011
02:15:58,220 --> 02:15:59,460
Set, go.

3012
02:16:00,760 --> 02:16:03,360
- I really don't want to practice. - I'm exhausted.

3013
02:16:03,990 --> 02:16:05,960
I'm exhausted. I want to sleep.

3014
02:16:06,260 --> 02:16:09,229
Jun Min, I'm in 11th place. I want to be at the front.

3015
02:16:09,230 --> 02:16:10,599
I'm getting covered too much.

3016
02:16:10,600 --> 02:16:11,740
Where's my beverage?

3017
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:13,299
(He feels dizzy.)

3018
02:16:13,300 --> 02:16:15,110
- Jun Min. - Wake me when you guys are done.

3019
02:16:15,210 --> 02:16:16,570
This isn't mine.

3020
02:16:17,140 --> 02:16:18,170
All right, everyone.

3021
02:16:18,280 --> 02:16:21,210
(Will he be able to handle the situation like the leader?)

3022
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:22,979
I'm the leader, right?

3023
02:16:22,980 --> 02:16:25,450
Seriously, what I want to ask... What I want to say is...

3024
02:16:26,180 --> 02:16:28,020
- Seriously. - Gosh, my beverage.

3025
02:16:28,290 --> 02:16:29,389
You're too...

3026
02:16:29,390 --> 02:16:30,419
(The disappointing leadership makes them whine even more.)

3027
02:16:30,420 --> 02:16:31,690
What's wrong with our leader?

3028
02:16:31,860 --> 02:16:32,919
(The first test fails.)

3029
02:16:32,920 --> 02:16:35,129
(How will Kim Jun Min handle a fight between the members?)

3030
02:16:35,130 --> 02:16:36,189
Cue.

3031
02:16:36,190 --> 02:16:37,730
What's your problem?

3032
02:16:38,430 --> 02:16:39,529
Perform properly.

3033
02:16:39,530 --> 02:16:40,759
Didn't I perform properly?

3034
02:16:40,760 --> 02:16:42,900
Did I do anything wrong? What's up with you?

3035
02:16:42,970 --> 02:16:44,769
- You should've toned it down. - It'll pass.

3036
02:16:44,770 --> 02:16:45,969
What did I do wrong?

3037
02:16:45,970 --> 02:16:47,269
Did I do anything wrong?

3038
02:16:47,270 --> 02:16:48,369
Come on.

3039
02:16:48,370 --> 02:16:50,139
- How is it my fault? - It isn't my fault, is it?

3040
02:16:50,140 --> 02:16:51,839
It isn't my fault that he's so tall.

3041
02:16:51,840 --> 02:16:53,839
Performing diligently doesn't cut it.

3042
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:55,080
It's true that you're short.

3043
02:16:56,850 --> 02:16:58,179
(The actors fail to become absorbed in their emotions.)

3044
02:16:58,180 --> 02:17:00,120
(Again, action.)

3045
02:17:00,250 --> 02:17:02,389
- Just accept that I'm a bit short. - Come on.

3046
02:17:02,390 --> 02:17:04,049
I can't get taller even if I do jump roping.

3047
02:17:04,050 --> 02:17:05,119
You guys should talk later.

3048
02:17:05,120 --> 02:17:06,719
I told you to take supplements!

3049
02:17:06,720 --> 02:17:08,060
- You guys should talk later. - This is driving me crazy.

3050
02:17:08,430 --> 02:17:10,129
- What do you want me to do? - Woo Jin, stop him.

3051
02:17:10,130 --> 02:17:11,189
(The team members' emotions run high.)

3052
02:17:11,190 --> 02:17:12,600
What did I do wrong?

3053
02:17:13,100 --> 02:17:16,099
I want to do well, okay?

3054
02:17:16,100 --> 02:17:19,039
(Radio silence)

3055
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:21,140
- Hurry up and do something. - You aren't very competent.

3056
02:17:25,440 --> 02:17:27,139
(He has no words.)

3057
02:17:27,140 --> 02:17:28,210
We had to stop them.

3058
02:17:28,980 --> 02:17:30,609
(The second test fails.)

3059
02:17:30,610 --> 02:17:31,979
(How will Kim Jun Min handle a physical fight?)

3060
02:17:31,980 --> 02:17:33,850
- Get ready. Set, go. - Set, go.

3061
02:17:34,450 --> 02:17:36,849
- What did I do wrong? - Hey.

3062
02:17:36,850 --> 02:17:38,959
- What did I do wrong? - Stop it.

3063
02:17:38,960 --> 02:17:40,359
What's your problem?

3064
02:17:40,360 --> 02:17:42,489
Where is the leader?

3065
02:17:42,490 --> 02:17:43,530
(He's here.)

3066
02:17:45,460 --> 02:17:47,200
(Where was the leader?)

3067
02:17:47,460 --> 02:17:48,969
- What did I do wrong? - Hey.

3068
02:17:48,970 --> 02:17:52,039
(The moment the physical fight occurred)

3069
02:17:52,040 --> 02:17:53,040
(Standing awkwardly)

3070
02:17:53,041 --> 02:17:57,410
(Unable to stop them, he stayed in the back.)

3071
02:17:59,340 --> 02:18:00,480
He was at the very back.

3072
02:18:01,110 --> 02:18:02,179
What was that?

3073
02:18:02,180 --> 02:18:03,249
(The 2 actors become angry.)

3074
02:18:03,250 --> 02:18:05,180
(I want to stop acting!)

3075
02:18:06,620 --> 02:18:08,289
I realized something.

3076
02:18:08,290 --> 02:18:09,589
I'm sure everyone realized that we shouldn't fight...

3077
02:18:09,590 --> 02:18:10,849
- because our leader is like this. - That's right.

3078
02:18:10,850 --> 02:18:12,319
That's right. Fighting won't get us anywhere.

3079
02:18:12,320 --> 02:18:14,689
Our leader is soft-hearted, so we shouldn't fight.

3080
02:18:14,690 --> 02:18:15,759
Okay.

3081
02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:17,429
This will be the last performance, so we should be amicable.

3082
02:18:17,430 --> 02:18:19,299
- That's right. - That's right.

3083
02:18:19,300 --> 02:18:21,229
- That's right. - Well said.

3084
02:18:21,230 --> 02:18:22,570
If Jun Min is the leader, we won't fight.

3085
02:18:22,670 --> 02:18:23,829
Jun Min is...

3086
02:18:23,830 --> 02:18:24,899
(Laughing)

3087
02:18:24,900 --> 02:18:26,170
overly nice.

3088
02:18:26,540 --> 02:18:27,800
He couldn't do anything.

3089
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,270
It was cute.

3090
02:18:30,070 --> 02:18:31,370
We can help him.

3091
02:18:32,880 --> 02:18:34,839
I'll struggle if something like that actually occurs.

3092
02:18:34,840 --> 02:18:36,579
I felt relieved...

3093
02:18:36,580 --> 02:18:39,049
to get past the difficult process and finally become the leader.

3094
02:18:39,050 --> 02:18:40,979
It's the last time I can be the leader here.

3095
02:18:40,980 --> 02:18:43,650
I'll help everyone so that they'll perform without any regrets.

3096
02:18:44,320 --> 02:18:45,559
("Never Been 2 Heaven" Leader, Kim Jun Min)

3097
02:18:45,560 --> 02:18:47,959
We've had three performances.

3098
02:18:47,960 --> 02:18:50,460
Has anyone not done the killing part once?

3099
02:18:50,890 --> 02:18:52,229
Many of us haven't.

3100
02:18:52,230 --> 02:18:53,799
(Kang Woo Jin, Zhou An Xin, Kim Geon Woo, and Jun Lee Jeong)

3101
02:18:53,800 --> 02:18:56,699
I see. The members who haven't done it...

3102
02:18:56,700 --> 02:18:58,099
- must want the part more. - Right.

3103
02:18:58,100 --> 02:19:00,270
If we don't get it this time, the chance will be gone.

3104
02:19:01,140 --> 02:19:02,470
That's why we want the part more.

3105
02:19:03,140 --> 02:19:04,710
I really want to killing part.

3106
02:19:04,910 --> 02:19:06,909
Except for the signal song,

3107
02:19:06,910 --> 02:19:10,180
I haven't had the killing part for the competition.

3108
02:19:10,380 --> 02:19:14,149
Since it's the final performance, I want to take the killing part...

3109
02:19:14,150 --> 02:19:15,950
and become the main character.

3110
02:19:16,550 --> 02:19:20,560
I've been trying out for the killing part nonstop.

3111
02:19:21,290 --> 02:19:25,960
(Zhou An Xin tried to get the killing part since "Whiplash.")

3112
02:19:26,330 --> 02:19:29,430
(He tried to get the killing part for "Breathe.")

3113
02:19:29,730 --> 02:19:31,629
(He tried to get the killing part for "Chains" as well, )

3114
02:19:31,630 --> 02:19:33,570
(but it didn't happen.)

3115
02:19:33,870 --> 02:19:36,069
I haven't had it once.

3116
02:19:36,070 --> 02:19:40,410
So, I want to do the killing part this time.

3117
02:19:41,110 --> 02:19:43,679
Since this is my last chance, I feel more ambitious.

3118
02:19:43,680 --> 02:19:46,280
I can perform this song well.

3119
02:19:49,450 --> 02:19:51,550
- The notes are high. - They're too high.

3120
02:19:52,860 --> 02:19:54,590
I don't think I can do it because of the vocal range.

3121
02:19:56,360 --> 02:19:59,829
To be honest, I thought Zhou An Xin suited the song.

3122
02:19:59,830 --> 02:20:01,030
It made me wary.

3123
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:03,899
Keep practicing the vocals. I'll go over the dance.

3124
02:20:03,900 --> 02:20:04,900
(They begin practicing for the killing part.)

3125
02:20:04,901 --> 02:20:06,370
(Kim Jun Min learns the dance for the team.)

3126
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:08,539
I'm determined to lead the choreography...

3127
02:20:08,540 --> 02:20:11,270
and create a neat performance.

3128
02:20:11,410 --> 02:20:12,579
Shall we try it first?

3129
02:20:12,580 --> 02:20:14,979
(Kim Jun Min teaches the choreography he has learned.)

3130
02:20:14,980 --> 02:20:18,149
And 1, 2, 3, and 4.

3131
02:20:18,150 --> 02:20:20,819
Five, six, seven, eight.

3132
02:20:20,820 --> 02:20:22,419
Jun Min, do the feet go...

3133
02:20:22,420 --> 02:20:23,589
One, two.

3134
02:20:23,590 --> 02:20:26,189
- That's right. One, two. - One, two.

3135
02:20:26,190 --> 02:20:28,019
After you do this,

3136
02:20:28,020 --> 02:20:30,090
- do you start from here? - You proceed right away like this.

3137
02:20:30,290 --> 02:20:31,689
- Jun Min. - Yes?

3138
02:20:31,690 --> 02:20:33,360
I don't understand the beat.

3139
02:20:33,630 --> 02:20:35,469
Eight, one.

3140
02:20:35,470 --> 02:20:37,529
(Jun Min teaches them diligently for the perfect performance.)

3141
02:20:37,530 --> 02:20:39,499
Seven, eight.

3142
02:20:39,500 --> 02:20:41,540
Five, six, seven, eight.

3143
02:20:41,940 --> 02:20:43,569
Two, three, four,

3144
02:20:43,570 --> 02:20:45,639
five, six, seven, eight.

3145
02:20:45,640 --> 02:20:47,409
In the previous performances,

3146
02:20:47,410 --> 02:20:48,479
I was very lucky...

3147
02:20:48,480 --> 02:20:50,949
to get the parts that made me stand out.

3148
02:20:50,950 --> 02:20:52,779
But for the final, for the first time,

3149
02:20:52,780 --> 02:20:55,550
I got the sub rapper that gives me a single part in the second verse.

3150
02:20:55,650 --> 02:20:58,759
The killing part was the only way I could make up for it.

3151
02:20:58,760 --> 02:21:00,119
But when I looked around,

3152
02:21:00,120 --> 02:21:01,659
there were so many members who suited the song.

3153
02:21:01,660 --> 02:21:03,189
But I wanted it too.

3154
02:21:03,190 --> 02:21:04,730
Because of that, I was a bit confused.

3155
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:09,400
(Here's another person who's confused.)

3156
02:21:10,700 --> 02:21:14,340
It's my first time doing a song with such a concept.

3157
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:20,440
(Lee Sang Won was far from the bright concept.)

3158
02:21:21,680 --> 02:21:24,079
"I'll never be able to pull off the killing part."

3159
02:21:24,080 --> 02:21:25,320
I had that thought.

3160
02:21:25,420 --> 02:21:27,850
I become serious when I perform.

3161
02:21:28,220 --> 02:21:29,450
How will I smile on the stage?

3162
02:21:29,920 --> 02:21:32,390
It's because you've only done serious songs.

3163
02:21:32,890 --> 02:21:34,820
(Very worried)

3164
02:21:35,330 --> 02:21:36,459
(He pulls up the corners of his mouth.)

3165
02:21:36,460 --> 02:21:38,530
I was a bit worried.

3166
02:21:39,230 --> 02:21:40,900
This choreography is hard.

3167
02:21:41,060 --> 02:21:43,430
It was the concept I had never tried in my life.

3168
02:21:43,970 --> 02:21:45,570
I look like a fool. This choreography is hard.

3169
02:21:48,640 --> 02:21:50,610
You shouldn't dance in a cute way.

3170
02:21:51,310 --> 02:21:52,340
You do look cute.

3171
02:21:53,180 --> 02:21:54,639
(Where am I? Who am I? The dance shows his confusion.)

3172
02:21:54,640 --> 02:21:56,250
- You do look cute. - Even I don't think...

3173
02:21:56,380 --> 02:21:58,549
this concept suits me.

3174
02:21:58,550 --> 02:22:00,079
I need to do my best.

3175
02:22:00,080 --> 02:22:01,620
I feel very lost, to be honest.

3176
02:22:01,950 --> 02:22:03,049
Shall we do three run-throughs in a cute way?

3177
02:22:03,050 --> 02:22:04,950
- Smile too. - Let's stay cheerful.

3178
02:22:10,830 --> 02:22:11,959
I thought...

3179
02:22:11,960 --> 02:22:14,530
that I'd be able to pull off the killing part very well.

3180
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:18,229
(Who will be the 2 candidates...)

3181
02:22:18,230 --> 02:22:21,470
(for the killing part of "Never Been 2 Heaven?")

3182
02:22:22,670 --> 02:22:23,740
One more time.

3183
02:22:26,480 --> 02:22:28,109
(Peer review for choosing the killing part candidates)

3184
02:22:28,110 --> 02:22:30,910
Let's begin the peer review for "Brat Attitude."

3185
02:22:31,350 --> 02:22:34,279
Hello, I'm Chuei Li Yu for "Brat Attitude."

3186
02:22:34,280 --> 02:22:37,189
This is a genre I've never tried,

3187
02:22:37,190 --> 02:22:39,390
but I'll do my best.

3188
02:22:39,720 --> 02:22:41,259
- Good luck. - Let's go.

3189
02:22:41,260 --> 02:22:42,290
Come on.

3190
02:22:42,860 --> 02:22:46,660
(Candidate 1 for the killing part, Chuei Li Yu)

3191
02:22:54,540 --> 02:22:55,609
Okay.

3192
02:22:55,610 --> 02:22:57,269
(He overcame the pressure and performed well.)

3193
02:22:57,270 --> 02:22:58,270
Okay, Li Yu.

3194
02:22:58,271 --> 02:23:00,780
It'll be refreshing if Li Yu does it.

3195
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:04,309
Hello, I'm He Xin Long.

3196
02:23:04,310 --> 02:23:06,619
This killing part is very important to me,

3197
02:23:06,620 --> 02:23:08,350
so I'll do my best.

3198
02:23:08,420 --> 02:23:10,050
- All right. - Let's go, He Xin Long.

3199
02:23:11,250 --> 02:23:14,260
I'll get the killing part no matter what.

3200
02:23:14,460 --> 02:23:17,890
(Candidate 2 for the killing part, He Xin Long)

3201
02:23:22,370 --> 02:23:24,400
(He Xin Long forgets the dance momentarily.)

3202
02:23:26,200 --> 02:23:28,340
(He Xin Long freestyles until the end.)

3203
02:23:31,870 --> 02:23:33,110
Okay.

3204
02:23:33,780 --> 02:23:35,010
He freestyled it.

3205
02:23:35,710 --> 02:23:37,179
It's okay.

3206
02:23:37,180 --> 02:23:38,450
(The team members console the disappointed He Xin Long.)

3207
02:23:38,580 --> 02:23:40,150
- It was cool. - It's okay.

3208
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:42,790
(He Xin Long is upset about the mistake.)

3209
02:23:43,950 --> 02:23:45,290
The cuddly cat that's a brat.

3210
02:23:45,860 --> 02:23:48,960
(Candidate 3 for the killing part, Chung Sang Hyeon)

3211
02:23:52,330 --> 02:23:54,860
(Candidate 4 for the killing part, Kim Jun Seo)

3212
02:24:00,840 --> 02:24:03,370
(Candidate 5 for the killing part, Chen Kai Wen)

3213
02:24:15,220 --> 02:24:17,450
(You're the best.)

3214
02:24:17,550 --> 02:24:19,860
Dong Gyu, you can do it.

3215
02:24:20,260 --> 02:24:23,459
I believe you'll get lots of votes as people see your effort.

3216
02:24:23,460 --> 02:24:24,490
Go for it.

3217
02:24:25,400 --> 02:24:27,730
- Go for it! - A cheering message to himself.

3218
02:24:29,930 --> 02:24:32,940
(Dong Gyu is doing live as well.)

3219
02:24:43,780 --> 02:24:44,810
(Dong Gyu's peer review ends.)

3220
02:24:45,420 --> 02:24:47,980
(Killing part candidate 7, Yumeki)

3221
02:25:02,400 --> 02:25:04,730
(They clap for leader Yumeki.)

3222
02:25:04,830 --> 02:25:06,970
That's not fair.

3223
02:25:07,470 --> 02:25:08,539
Yumeki did so well.

3224
02:25:08,540 --> 02:25:10,240
Let's go.

3225
02:25:10,410 --> 02:25:12,480
I really want to do the killing part.

3226
02:25:12,910 --> 02:25:14,780
I hope I will be picked.

3227
02:25:14,880 --> 02:25:16,480
(Killing part candidate 8, Zhang Jia Hao)

3228
02:25:30,960 --> 02:25:32,760
(The peer review for the killing part ends.)

3229
02:25:33,230 --> 02:25:35,529
He keeps doing this with his head.

3230
02:25:35,530 --> 02:25:37,130
He even dances sexily to a hip-hop song.

3231
02:25:38,070 --> 02:25:39,539
Who should it be?

3232
02:25:39,540 --> 02:25:41,840
(They vote for 2 members to perform the killing part.)

3233
02:25:42,470 --> 02:25:47,680
(All 16 participants will cast a vote.)

3234
02:25:52,550 --> 02:25:54,420
(The killing part peer review ends.)

3235
02:25:58,390 --> 02:25:59,560
I made a mistake.

3236
02:26:00,360 --> 02:26:01,959
This would be...

3237
02:26:01,960 --> 02:26:04,659
the very last performance,

3238
02:26:04,660 --> 02:26:06,300
so I desperately wanted to do well.

3239
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:08,830
Like last time,

3240
02:26:09,330 --> 02:26:10,670
my memory...

3241
02:26:10,830 --> 02:26:11,870
I see.

3242
02:26:12,640 --> 02:26:15,610
I feel like my brain is that of an old man.

3243
02:26:16,510 --> 02:26:17,610
What?

3244
02:26:19,080 --> 02:26:21,580
(What is he talking about?)

3245
02:26:21,680 --> 02:26:23,650
My brain isn't functioning properly.

3246
02:26:23,710 --> 02:26:25,550
- It's not working so well. - Okay.

3247
02:26:25,650 --> 02:26:28,079
I think everyone learns differently...

3248
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:29,389
in terms of speed.

3249
02:26:29,390 --> 02:26:31,450
(Feeling bad)

3250
02:26:31,890 --> 02:26:34,920
I'll tell you the result of the peer review.

3251
02:26:40,460 --> 02:26:42,329
Here we go.

3252
02:26:42,330 --> 02:26:43,430
- Okay. - Yes.

3253
02:26:43,770 --> 02:26:45,670
"Killing part candidate 1, Yumeki."

3254
02:26:46,400 --> 02:26:48,639
"Reason. He danced the most stably."

3255
02:26:48,640 --> 02:26:49,640
Right.

3256
02:26:49,810 --> 02:26:51,340
"Killing part candidate 2,"

3257
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:53,939
"Zhang Jia Hao."

3258
02:26:53,940 --> 02:26:55,439
(Jia Hao gets 1 vote.)

3259
02:26:55,440 --> 02:26:56,680
"Reason."

3260
02:26:56,780 --> 02:26:58,480
- "I liked the vibe." - So did I.

3261
02:26:58,710 --> 02:27:00,220
I'll move on.

3262
02:27:00,720 --> 02:27:02,889
"Killing part candidate 1, Zhang Jia Hao."

3263
02:27:02,890 --> 02:27:04,920
(Jia Hao has 2 votes.)

3264
02:27:05,120 --> 02:27:07,459
"Killing part candidate 2, Yumeki."

3265
02:27:07,460 --> 02:27:09,190
(Yumeki has 2 votes.)

3266
02:27:09,390 --> 02:27:11,589
"Killing part candidate 1, Yumeki."

3267
02:27:11,590 --> 02:27:12,899
(2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, and 0 votes)

3268
02:27:12,900 --> 02:27:14,729
"Killing part candidate 2, Zhang Jia Hao."

3269
02:27:14,730 --> 02:27:15,870
(3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, and 0 votes)

3270
02:27:16,470 --> 02:27:18,099
- It's only those two. - I know.

3271
02:27:18,100 --> 02:27:19,240
(Jia Hao and Yumeki are both in the lead.)

3272
02:27:19,570 --> 02:27:21,970
I was constantly nervous.

3273
02:27:22,940 --> 02:27:24,310
"Killing part candidate 1,"

3274
02:27:25,710 --> 02:27:26,780
"Park Dong Gyu."

3275
02:27:27,210 --> 02:27:29,810
(Dong Gyu gets 1 vote.)

3276
02:27:29,910 --> 02:27:31,609
"He was well-balanced,"

3277
02:27:31,610 --> 02:27:34,119
"so I thought he'd be a good pivot point."

3278
02:27:34,120 --> 02:27:35,380
Thank you.

3279
02:27:35,480 --> 02:27:37,949
"Killing part candidate 2, Park Dong Gyu."

3280
02:27:37,950 --> 02:27:39,419
(Dong Gyu has 2 votes.)

3281
02:27:39,420 --> 02:27:40,990
- Dong Gyu. - Oh, boy.

3282
02:27:41,660 --> 02:27:43,560
"I think he'll be good."

3283
02:27:45,860 --> 02:27:48,100
(The effective candidates: Jia Hao, Yumeki, and Dong Gyu)

3284
02:27:48,660 --> 02:27:50,330
The two candidates for the killing part...

3285
02:27:50,930 --> 02:27:52,400
of "Brat Attitude" are...

3286
02:27:57,240 --> 02:27:58,269
Yumeki...

3287
02:27:58,270 --> 02:28:01,010
(Yumeki is the final candidate with 10 votes.)

3288
02:28:01,180 --> 02:28:03,280
I hope he calls my name.

3289
02:28:04,050 --> 02:28:06,280
I genuinely want to be a candidate for the killing part.

3290
02:28:07,280 --> 02:28:08,280
And...

3291
02:28:09,120 --> 02:28:10,319
Zhang Jia Hao.

3292
02:28:10,320 --> 02:28:12,120
(Yumeki is the final candidate with 9 votes.)

3293
02:28:17,730 --> 02:28:20,960
I got more votes than I expected,

3294
02:28:21,830 --> 02:28:23,200
so I was pleased.

3295
02:28:24,270 --> 02:28:26,569
- Let's go! - Go, Yumeki!

3296
02:28:26,570 --> 02:28:27,900
- All right. - Let's go!

3297
02:28:29,010 --> 02:28:30,139
Thank you.

3298
02:28:30,140 --> 02:28:31,210
(The killing part candidates: Jia Hao and Yumeki)

3299
02:28:32,040 --> 02:28:34,880
We'll begin the peer review for "Never Been 2 Heaven."

3300
02:28:35,540 --> 02:28:38,710
Lee Jeong was the only one who's performed a cheerful song.

3301
02:28:39,150 --> 02:28:41,049
It was a refreshing choreography,

3302
02:28:41,050 --> 02:28:42,950
so I thought I'd be good at it.

3303
02:28:43,050 --> 02:28:44,650
I wanted to get the killing part this time.

3304
02:28:45,090 --> 02:28:46,389
I'm the performer of the killing part...

3305
02:28:46,390 --> 02:28:47,719
for "Never Been 2 Heaven,"

3306
02:28:47,720 --> 02:28:49,060
Jun Lee Jeong.

3307
02:28:50,960 --> 02:28:52,530
We didn't give you the part yet!

3308
02:28:52,930 --> 02:28:53,930
Let's go!

3309
02:28:56,030 --> 02:28:59,840
(Candidate 1 for the killing part, Jun Lee Jeong)

3310
02:29:05,170 --> 02:29:07,540
(He finishes with a cute heart.)

3311
02:29:07,780 --> 02:29:08,840
So cute.

3312
02:29:09,380 --> 02:29:11,410
(Candidate 2 for the killing part, Kang Woo Jin)

3313
02:29:14,150 --> 02:29:15,850
(His mind went blank.)

3314
02:29:16,120 --> 02:29:18,020
- It's all right! - Keep going!

3315
02:29:18,320 --> 02:29:19,490
(Sighing)

3316
02:29:19,590 --> 02:29:21,259
I was sad that I didn't get to show them...

3317
02:29:21,260 --> 02:29:22,660
my full potential.

3318
02:29:22,990 --> 02:29:24,660
(The peer review for Lee Jung and Woo Jin ends.)

3319
02:29:25,030 --> 02:29:27,100
(The remaining candidates have only performed dark songs.)

3320
02:29:27,130 --> 02:29:29,470
(Who will go first?)

3321
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:33,699
(Malfunctioning body)

3322
02:29:33,700 --> 02:29:36,970
(Malfunctioning face)

3323
02:29:37,210 --> 02:29:38,240
I...

3324
02:29:38,840 --> 02:29:40,009
You already look cute.

3325
02:29:40,010 --> 02:29:41,179
Adorable!

3326
02:29:41,180 --> 02:29:44,350
"I'm cute."

3327
02:29:44,450 --> 02:29:47,550
(Candidate 3 for the killing part, Kim Jun Min)

3328
02:29:50,350 --> 02:29:51,490
It's so powerful.

3329
02:29:52,020 --> 02:29:53,160
It's powerful and cheerful.

3330
02:29:54,620 --> 02:29:56,560
(He did the cheerful dance in his style.)

3331
02:29:58,560 --> 02:29:59,630
Thank you.

3332
02:30:00,560 --> 02:30:04,400
(Candidate 4 for the killing part, Lee Leo)

3333
02:30:04,430 --> 02:30:06,040
(Biting his lips)

3334
02:30:06,100 --> 02:30:08,040
(This cheerful song is from the underworld.)

3335
02:30:13,240 --> 02:30:15,010
(And lethal cheerfulness at the end)

3336
02:30:20,650 --> 02:30:22,019
Be confident.

3337
02:30:22,020 --> 02:30:23,389
(Sang Won goes after Leo.)

3338
02:30:23,390 --> 02:30:26,390
(Anxious)

3339
02:30:26,720 --> 02:30:28,560
I've never seen Sang Won dance to a cheerful song.

3340
02:30:28,660 --> 02:30:30,160
(Deadly and sexy)

3341
02:30:30,890 --> 02:30:33,060
(Can he pull off a cheerful song as well?)

3342
02:30:36,030 --> 02:30:38,130
(Candidate 5 for the killing part, Lee Sang Won)

3343
02:30:38,230 --> 02:30:40,070
(Can he transform into a cheerful singer?)

3344
02:30:48,110 --> 02:30:51,280
(Why are they laughing?)

3345
02:30:51,510 --> 02:30:55,650
(Sang Won forgets the dance and freestyles it.)

3346
02:30:58,490 --> 02:30:59,919
His facial expressions are on point.

3347
02:30:59,920 --> 02:31:00,960
Cutie.

3348
02:31:04,590 --> 02:31:07,030
(He does his best to make it cheerful.)

3349
02:31:12,270 --> 02:31:13,470
How did you make it so cute?

3350
02:31:14,040 --> 02:31:15,640
That was Sang Won in 2016.

3351
02:31:16,140 --> 02:31:17,140
It was cute.

3352
02:31:17,240 --> 02:31:20,080
I did my best to look cute.

3353
02:31:20,480 --> 02:31:23,310
(Candidate 6 for the killing part, Yoo Kang Min)

3354
02:31:23,480 --> 02:31:24,480
It's bright.

3355
02:31:29,920 --> 02:31:33,159
(You can clearly tell that he's done this theme before.)

3356
02:31:33,160 --> 02:31:35,420
- He proved it. - It was charming.

3357
02:31:35,620 --> 02:31:37,889
I thought Kang Min would be the perfect member...

3358
02:31:37,890 --> 02:31:39,560
to sing the killing part.

3359
02:31:39,900 --> 02:31:42,130
(There are only two members left.)

3360
02:31:42,260 --> 02:31:43,399
(The performers of the Signal Song's killing part, )

3361
02:31:43,400 --> 02:31:44,530
(Zhou An Xin and Kim Geon Woo)

3362
02:31:45,300 --> 02:31:47,270
(Candidate 7 for the killing part, Kim Geon Woo)

3363
02:31:57,380 --> 02:32:01,880
(Geon Woo got some moves wrong.)

3364
02:32:05,860 --> 02:32:07,390
Well done!

3365
02:32:07,620 --> 02:32:08,660
No!

3366
02:32:09,290 --> 02:32:11,130
I desperately wanted the part,

3367
02:32:11,330 --> 02:32:12,730
and my mind went blank.

3368
02:32:14,230 --> 02:32:15,360
It was a bummer.

3369
02:32:16,270 --> 02:32:20,200
(Candidate 8 for the killing part, Zhou An Xin)

3370
02:32:25,570 --> 02:32:26,640
He's a good fit.

3371
02:32:34,050 --> 02:32:37,120
I think his cute facial expressions will go well with the song.

3372
02:32:38,090 --> 02:32:39,660
Who should I vote for?

3373
02:32:41,820 --> 02:32:43,230
Who should I pick as the second candidate?

3374
02:32:45,460 --> 02:32:47,229
(Who will be the 2 candidates...)

3375
02:32:47,230 --> 02:32:49,200
(for the killing part of "Never Been 2 Heaven?")

3376
02:32:49,370 --> 02:32:51,230
We have the result, guys.

3377
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,869
(Team "Never Been 2 Heaven" also gets the killing part result.)

3378
02:32:55,870 --> 02:32:58,540
(Who will be the 2 candidates?)

3379
02:32:58,810 --> 02:33:00,040
- I'll start. - Yes.

3380
02:33:03,650 --> 02:33:05,380
"Killing part candidate 1, Sang Won."

3381
02:33:05,950 --> 02:33:07,220
"I liked his facial expressions."

3382
02:33:07,480 --> 02:33:09,920
So did I. "Killing part candidate 2, Leo."

3383
02:33:09,990 --> 02:33:11,719
He's the perfect fit for the song.

3384
02:33:11,720 --> 02:33:13,720
- What? - You're a good fit for the song.

3385
02:33:14,220 --> 02:33:16,330
(Sang Won and Leo got one vote each.)

3386
02:33:16,430 --> 02:33:17,590
First, Kang Min.

3387
02:33:17,760 --> 02:33:19,529
"You're the most stable, and you're good."

3388
02:33:19,530 --> 02:33:23,130
"Your cuteness is driving me insane. The best."

3389
02:33:23,670 --> 02:33:25,270
Second, Zhou An Xin.

3390
02:33:25,430 --> 02:33:28,670
"You proved that you matched the song. The best."

3391
02:33:30,240 --> 02:33:31,940
"Killing part candidate 1, Yoo Kang Min."

3392
02:33:32,070 --> 02:33:34,179
"I can picture him performing the killing part of this song."

3393
02:33:34,180 --> 02:33:35,209
"I think he'll pull it off."

3394
02:33:35,210 --> 02:33:37,280
"Killing part candidate 1, Yoo Kang Min. He did it best."

3395
02:33:37,450 --> 02:33:38,849
"Killing part candidate 1, Yoo Kang Min."

3396
02:33:38,850 --> 02:33:40,450
"Kang Min."

3397
02:33:41,220 --> 02:33:42,849
"Killing part candidate 1, Yoo Kang Min."

3398
02:33:42,850 --> 02:33:44,720
- "He matches the song." - Kang Min got a lot of votes.

3399
02:33:45,990 --> 02:33:48,590
I'm so worried.

3400
02:33:49,530 --> 02:33:51,890
"Killing part candidate 2, An Xin."

3401
02:33:51,960 --> 02:33:54,330
"His cute looks match the song."

3402
02:33:54,600 --> 02:33:55,600
Next.

3403
02:33:55,730 --> 02:33:57,730
"Killing part candidate 1, Lee Sang Won."

3404
02:33:58,170 --> 02:33:59,200
"He's cute."

3405
02:34:00,070 --> 02:34:01,999
"Killing part candidate 2, Kim Geon Woo."

3406
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,169
"Killing part candidate 1, Jun Lee Jeong. Lee Sang Won."

3407
02:34:04,170 --> 02:34:05,470
"Lee Jeong. Yoo Kang Min."

3408
02:34:05,910 --> 02:34:07,309
"Killing part candidate 1, Zhou An Xin."

3409
02:34:07,310 --> 02:34:08,479
"He matches the song's vibe,"

3410
02:34:08,480 --> 02:34:10,280
"and I think he'll be great after practice."

3411
02:34:11,410 --> 02:34:14,720
The last person wrote it.

3412
02:34:15,480 --> 02:34:17,319
Is that all? It must be Geon Woo.

3413
02:34:17,320 --> 02:34:18,320
Yes, that's all.

3414
02:34:18,590 --> 02:34:19,760
Who will it be?

3415
02:34:20,920 --> 02:34:21,990
I have no idea.

3416
02:34:22,420 --> 02:34:23,830
We'll be in trouble.

3417
02:34:24,690 --> 02:34:26,530
(Sighing)

3418
02:34:31,100 --> 02:34:34,969
(Who will be the 2 candidates for the killing part...)

3419
02:34:34,970 --> 02:34:37,769
(on Team "Never Been 2 Heaven?")

3420
02:34:37,770 --> 02:34:40,079
The candidate chosen...

3421
02:34:40,080 --> 02:34:43,079
by ten or so members is...

3422
02:34:43,080 --> 02:34:44,479
(The first killing part candidate)

3423
02:34:44,480 --> 02:34:46,050
- Kang Min. - Okay.

3424
02:34:46,250 --> 02:34:47,380
Thank you.

3425
02:34:48,050 --> 02:34:49,119
Next is...

3426
02:34:49,120 --> 02:34:52,350
(Who's the second killing part candidate?)

3427
02:34:52,790 --> 02:34:53,990
He had the most votes.

3428
02:34:54,490 --> 02:34:55,659
Congratulations.

3429
02:34:55,660 --> 02:34:56,890
(To be continued)

3430
02:34:57,390 --> 02:34:59,659
The candidate chosen...

3431
02:34:59,660 --> 02:35:02,770
by ten or so members is...

3432
02:35:04,100 --> 02:35:05,730
- Kang Min. - Okay.

3433
02:35:05,900 --> 02:35:06,970
Thank you.

3434
02:35:07,540 --> 02:35:08,639
Next is...

3435
02:35:08,640 --> 02:35:11,769
(Who's the second killing part candidate?)

3436
02:35:11,770 --> 02:35:13,380
An Xin has the most votes.

3437
02:35:13,580 --> 02:35:15,380
- Okay. - Thank you.

3438
02:35:16,080 --> 02:35:17,150
Congratulations.

3439
02:35:17,810 --> 02:35:19,480
We're roommates.

3440
02:35:20,650 --> 02:35:22,790
What's wrong?

3441
02:35:23,190 --> 02:35:25,820
I'm a little bummed out.

3442
02:35:26,660 --> 02:35:28,420
I did my best, but no one voted for me.

3443
02:35:28,960 --> 02:35:30,629
(Eyes quivering)

3444
02:35:30,630 --> 02:35:31,790
I didn't know.

3445
02:35:32,460 --> 02:35:33,900
It's my first time experiencing it.

3446
02:35:35,560 --> 02:35:36,570
Zero votes.

3447
02:35:36,900 --> 02:35:38,930
It was the first time no one wrote down my name.

3448
02:35:40,940 --> 02:35:43,340
I have to admit that it felt strange.

3449
02:35:44,370 --> 02:35:47,240
Here's a temporary killing part sticker.

3450
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:48,310
Thank you.

3451
02:35:48,780 --> 02:35:49,810
Thank you.

3452
02:35:50,910 --> 02:35:53,149
Can you pose like this while looking at each other?

3453
02:35:53,150 --> 02:35:54,580
That pose seems perfect.

3454
02:36:00,260 --> 02:36:01,389
(Flustered)

3455
02:36:01,390 --> 02:36:02,929
I take good care of An Xin.

3456
02:36:02,930 --> 02:36:04,259
An Xin is so clever.

3457
02:36:04,260 --> 02:36:05,430
Detecting abyss.

3458
02:36:05,560 --> 02:36:08,200
- I will work hard with An Xin. - Yes.

3459
02:36:08,600 --> 02:36:09,670
We can do it.

3460
02:36:12,430 --> 02:36:14,869
The upcoming performance is...

3461
02:36:14,870 --> 02:36:18,110
my last chance to show why people should choose me.

3462
02:36:18,740 --> 02:36:20,540
As this is my last chance,

3463
02:36:20,940 --> 02:36:23,580
I'll defend the killing part.

3464
02:36:26,250 --> 02:36:29,420
I'll think of it as my last time in life.

3465
02:36:29,550 --> 02:36:31,850
That's how I want to prepare for the upcoming performance.

3466
02:36:33,290 --> 02:36:36,430
Among all the songs I performed so far,

3467
02:36:36,730 --> 02:36:40,700
I'll be able to show my charms the best with this song.

3468
02:36:42,730 --> 02:36:44,329
(On the Final Live Show next week, )

3469
02:36:44,330 --> 02:36:46,000
(who will get the killing part?)

3470
02:36:46,700 --> 02:36:48,569
Star Creators around the world.

3471

(there was never a moment...)

02:37:27,380 --> 02:37:29,850
(when I didn't feel desperate.)

3490
02:37:30,910 --> 02:37:34,520
(I desperately want to debut.)

3491
02:37:34,980 --> 02:37:37,089
(I'd like to make it to Top 8.)

3492
02:37:37,090 --> 02:37:38,750
(I really want to debut.)

02:37:43,060 --> 02:37:47,160
(I love my dream so much that I can't give up.)

3495
02:37:47,460 --> 02:37:49,000
(I refuse to give up.)

3496
02:37:50,800 --> 02:37:53,040

3499

(to show my everything.)

3500
02:38:03,050 --> 02:38:04,650
(I will keep this position.)

3501
02:38:08,380 --> 02:38:09,750
- I want to debut. - I want to debut.

(Episode 11: Firing the Light, Solar)

3503
02:38:12,320 --> 02:38:13,460
