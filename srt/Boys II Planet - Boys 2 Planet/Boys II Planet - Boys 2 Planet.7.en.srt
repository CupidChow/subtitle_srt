(The One Star participants beat the All Star participants...)

7
00:00:16,707 --> 00:00:18,416
(and acquired the benefit of 100,000 points.)

8
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:20,276
(It's the rebellion of 2 Star and 1 Star participants.)

9
00:00:20,277 --> 00:00:21,286
(The rebellion...)

10
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:22,486
(of the lower classes...)

11

The First Survivor Announcement on BOYS II PLANET.

16
00:00:40,403 --> 00:00:41,413
This is scary.

17
00:00:42,303 --> 00:00:43,512
Please.

18
00:00:43,513 --> 00:00:44,513

24

"This is a space where you can honestly share things..."

31
00:01:30,863 --> 00:01:33,323
"You couldn't tell others about your day."

32
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,632
"Feel free to express and record your emotions."

33
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:39,033
(Planet Diary Room, a private space to share their thoughts)

34
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:43,633
A lot of things will change starting from tomorrow.

35
00:01:44,603 --> 00:01:46,903
I don't know...

36
00:01:47,873 --> 00:01:49,473
what the result will be.

37
00:01:50,373 --> 00:01:53,143
My biggest worry was getting to know 80 people...

38
00:01:53,543 --> 00:01:56,453
and becoming comfortable around them.

39
00:01:56,813 --> 00:02:00,483
I became very affectionate of them in a short period of time.

40
00:02:01,323 --> 00:02:03,293
I was really happy.

41
00:02:04,493 --> 00:02:06,363
During my stay at Planet Camp,

42
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:10,663
I became more desperate.

43
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:14,333
I've never been this desperate in my life.

44
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:19,803
(They're so desperate to debut that they can't give up.)

45
00:02:21,013 --> 00:02:22,843
I have to do well. I can't go back home.

46
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:25,213
I don't want to go home.

47
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:27,352
Star Creators, please help me.

48
00:02:27,353 --> 00:02:28,853
I want to survive one more round.

49
00:02:29,613 --> 00:02:32,923
I want to make it to the final round and debut.

50
00:02:34,093 --> 00:02:35,992
I hope to survive.

51
00:02:35,993 --> 00:02:37,899
(I really want to survive until the end. Please...)

52
00:02:37,923 --> 00:02:41,033
I hope to return to this room and write in Planet Diary again.

53
00:02:41,993 --> 00:02:44,303
I will survive, no matter what.

54
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:49,473
I really want to debut on BOYS II PLANET.

55
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:55,172
You can't go home until I get eliminated.

56
00:02:55,173 --> 00:02:57,143
Neither can you.

57
00:02:58,213 --> 00:03:02,113

(1st Survivor Announcement)

67
00:03:37,453 --> 00:03:38,682
(The participants enter for the 1st Survivor Announcement.)

68
00:03:38,683 --> 00:03:39,683
Let's go.

69
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:43,923
- Hello, Heui Chan. - Hello.

70
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,092
Zi Hao, why don't we do a nice pose together?

71
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,163
That sounds good.

72
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,433
(They start with an intense sexy pose.)

73
00:03:53,403 --> 00:03:55,373
(Followed by a spectacular performance)

74
00:04:00,913 --> 00:04:02,973
(Andrew's soulful "Rising Sun")

75
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,683
That's insanely soulful.

76
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,313
How well will they do?

77
00:04:07,713 --> 00:04:09,412
(The Neunga Boy appears.)

78
00:04:09,413 --> 00:04:11,282
- It's Neunga Boy. - Okay.

79
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:12,353
Hi, Neunga Boy.

80
00:04:14,393 --> 00:04:18,193
("Neunga" echoed endlessly in the practice room.)

81
00:04:19,323 --> 00:04:21,933
("Neunga" echoes again today.)

82
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:28,903
(Love is spreading as much as "neunga.")

83
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,373
Come here.

84
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,872
(Making a love dive into his arms?)

85
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:33,873
(That's embarrassing.)

86
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:36,073
(You have a place here too.)

87
00:04:36,173 --> 00:04:37,913
(Are they also in love mode?)

88
00:04:38,013 --> 00:04:40,333
Yi Chen, where did you go again in the middle of practice?

89
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:42,352
(This scene is...)

90
00:04:42,353 --> 00:04:43,983
Where is he? Hurry back.

91
00:04:45,923 --> 00:04:47,993
(Yi Chen was missing endlessly.)

92
00:04:48,423 --> 00:04:49,923
(A meme of searching for Yi Chen)

93
00:04:52,063 --> 00:04:53,462
Where did you go? Hurry up.

94
00:04:53,463 --> 00:04:54,762
There he is.

95
00:04:54,763 --> 00:04:55,833
I'm in your heart.

96
00:04:56,693 --> 00:04:58,103
(I agree with that.)

97
00:04:58,563 --> 00:04:59,632
There they are.

98
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,072
- They're here. - Gosh.

99
00:05:01,073 --> 00:05:02,409
(The main character of another famous scene)

100
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:04,372
(He Xin Long stayed by Na Yun Seo's side...)

101
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:06,273
(as Yun Seo was scared of sleeping alone.)

102
00:05:07,513 --> 00:05:08,912
(Since I've been in the rain before, )

103
00:05:08,913 --> 00:05:10,273
(I'll hold the umbrella for you.)

104
00:05:10,813 --> 00:05:11,942
("I'll hold the umbrella for you?" What a sweet comment?)

105
00:05:11,943 --> 00:05:13,082
(It made me cry so much.)

106
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,152
(Is this where you enter under an umbrella?)

107
00:05:14,153 --> 00:05:15,729
(Gather if you want to be He Xin Long's umbrella.)

108
00:05:15,753 --> 00:05:18,622
It's raining suddenly. I have no umbrella.

109
00:05:18,623 --> 00:05:21,353
Yun Seo.

110
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:26,263
(His heart flutters.)

111
00:05:26,363 --> 00:05:29,332
(Exploding with reaction)

112
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,602
- I'll hold the umbrella for you. - Thank you.

113
00:05:31,603 --> 00:05:34,202
He's finally holding the umbrella for him.

114
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:35,203
Finally.

115
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:36,272
(Appearing behind them)

116
00:05:36,273 --> 00:05:38,402
(Another popular couple)

117
00:05:38,403 --> 00:05:39,403

(Clapping endlessly)

121
00:05:49,113 --> 00:05:51,193

122
00:05:51,783 --> 00:05:52,783

I love that.

127

(Clapping)

128
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:10,733
He clearly took revenge on him.

(The handsome participants appear next.)

130
00:06:15,573 --> 00:06:17,243

Oh, my.

That's cute.

(Winking)

135
00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:33,393
That's cheating.

136
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,463
That's amazing.

137
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:38,063
I want to look like them for one day.

That's huge.

All eight participants on the team...

184
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:55,773
were given benefits based on their class.

185
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:59,003
Against the All Star team,

186
00:08:59,103 --> 00:09:03,343
"Plot Twist" Team 2 of 1 Star Class won.

187
00:09:03,973 --> 00:09:06,843
They each received 300,000 points.

188
00:09:07,483 --> 00:09:09,253
They won 300,000 points? I'm so jealous.

189
00:09:10,053 --> 00:09:11,623
I envy them.

190
00:09:12,923 --> 00:09:15,523
The First Survivor Announcement on BOYS II PLANET.

191
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:19,223
Surviving participants from 1st to 47th place...

192
00:09:19,563 --> 00:09:21,233
have been decided.

193
00:09:21,593 --> 00:09:25,533
However, as for the last survivor in 48th place,

194
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:28,033
the accumulated number of votes...

195
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:31,573
and the result of Last Survivor Live Voting will be combined.

196
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:34,842
That's how the last survivor will be determined.

197
00:09:34,843 --> 00:09:36,412
This is frightening.

198
00:09:36,413 --> 00:09:38,713
No, we can't be one of the candidates.

199
00:09:39,043 --> 00:09:40,513
I'm very nervous.

200
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,213
I might not make the cut.

201
00:09:42,753 --> 00:09:45,553
His fate will depend on the Last Survivor Voting.

202
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:49,153
I will now reveal the four candidates...

203
00:09:51,363 --> 00:09:52,423
for the 48th place.

204
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:55,962
(Candidates for the Last Survivor in 48th Place)

205
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:57,263
I can't look.

206
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,903
It makes me feel so...

207
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,203
Right away? Now?

208
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,803
I hope that they aren't on our team.

209
00:10:07,913 --> 00:10:10,113
Please, everyone on our team must survive.

210
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,683
(Candidates for the Last Survivor in 48th Place)

211
00:10:13,683 --> 00:10:14,782
(Candidates for the Last Survivor)

212
00:10:14,783 --> 00:10:15,982
(1. Yoon Min, 2. Bang Jun Hyuk, )

213
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:17,423
(3. Lee Dong Heon, 4. Zhang Shun Yu)

214
00:10:17,823 --> 00:10:22,053
- What? - Look at that.

215
00:10:24,053 --> 00:10:25,793
I don't believe this.

216
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:29,733
Among these 4, only 1 of them...

217
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:33,233
will continue their journey.

218
00:10:34,103 --> 00:10:35,273
It doesn't make sense.

219
00:10:36,073 --> 00:10:37,903
I'm getting lots of thoughts.

220
00:10:38,503 --> 00:10:42,773
Before the First Survivor Announcement,

221
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:46,743
I will explain how it will be done.

222
00:10:47,443 --> 00:10:50,653
Teams 1 and 2 that competed with the same song...

223
00:10:51,223 --> 00:10:53,052
on the 1-on-1 Class Battle...

224
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,393
will both come to the stage,

225
00:10:55,523 --> 00:10:58,293
and the announcement will proceed.

226
00:10:58,923 --> 00:11:03,233
Ranks 1 to 10, the 10 candidates for Top 8...

227
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:07,002
and the 4 candidates for rank 48, the last survivor,

228
00:11:07,003 --> 00:11:09,103
will not be called out.

229
00:11:09,473 --> 00:11:12,373
The 47th participant will also not be called out.

230
00:11:12,943 --> 00:11:16,713
So, even if your name wasn't called out,

231
00:11:16,773 --> 00:11:18,642
you may be a candidate for Top Eight...

232
00:11:18,643 --> 00:11:21,613
or the 47th participant and thus survive.

233
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:23,483
Seriously.

234
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:26,083
- This will give you false hope. - Rank 47.

235
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,653
In the rankings revealed on the third week,

236
00:11:28,923 --> 00:11:32,463
there were shocking changes.

237
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,593
Did the person in first place change?

238
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:35,963
I'm ready.

239
00:11:36,393 --> 00:11:38,833
You can never put your guard down.

240
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:42,503
The First Survivor Announcement of BOYS II PLANET.

241
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:48,513
Before we begin that,

242
00:11:50,473 --> 00:11:51,713
There's something more.

243
00:11:52,013 --> 00:11:55,482
We heard there was a heated competition at Planet Camp...

244
00:11:55,483 --> 00:11:58,853
with so much passion as in the ranking competition.

245
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:00,282
It was fun.

246
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:02,822
Let's check what competition it was...

247
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:05,563
on the screen.

248
00:12:06,863 --> 00:12:08,333
This is going to be fun.

249
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:11,443
(1st Survivor Announcement)

250
00:12:13,203 --> 00:12:14,463
The weather is so good.

251
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:16,053
It's like we came out on a walk.

252
00:12:16,473 --> 00:12:20,342
(The participants all gather somewhere.)

253
00:12:20,343 --> 00:12:21,373
Let's go in.

254
00:12:21,843 --> 00:12:22,973
What is this?

255
00:12:23,613 --> 00:12:26,043
Planet Alpha Visual Contest.

256
00:12:26,283 --> 00:12:28,282
There are life-size cutouts for everyone.

257
00:12:28,283 --> 00:12:29,889
(80 life-size cutouts welcome the participants.)

258
00:12:29,913 --> 00:12:31,429
We have to choose the person with the best looks.

259
00:12:31,453 --> 00:12:32,483
This is too easy.

260
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:33,583
Is it?

261
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,052
- He's good-looking. - Tall and great body proportions.

262
00:12:36,053 --> 00:12:38,092
There's a very cute person.

263
00:12:38,093 --> 00:12:39,093
The person I picked...

264
00:12:39,094 --> 00:12:40,692
(Who will rank 1st in the Planet Alpha Visual Contest?)

265
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,613
First place in Planet Alpha Visual Contest is...

266
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:45,003
(It will be revealed soon!)

267
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:47,033
(Exclaiming)

268
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:48,173
What is it?

269
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:49,433
(The first voters: Jo Gye Hyeon and Zhang Jia Hao)
What is this?

270
00:12:53,343 --> 00:12:54,402
There are so many people.

271
00:12:54,403 --> 00:12:56,743
(80 life-size cutouts are waiting to be chosen.)

272
00:12:56,973 --> 00:12:58,382
- Sato. - Goodness.

273
00:12:58,383 --> 00:12:59,543
Sato's picture came out nice.

274
00:12:59,743 --> 00:13:00,783
Thank you.

275
00:13:01,353 --> 00:13:03,013
Where am I?

276
00:13:03,413 --> 00:13:04,582
I'm over there.

277
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,753
(Hi)

278
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:10,292
Why is mine between them?

279
00:13:10,293 --> 00:13:11,592
(The legendary trainee, Jo Gye Hyeon, very handsome)

280
00:13:11,593 --> 00:13:13,492
I want my cutout moved.

281
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:14,523
Why is mine there?

282
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:16,763
The person I voted for...

283
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:18,463
was Yoo Kang Min.

284
00:13:19,203 --> 00:13:20,233
Kang Min.

285
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,132
He stood right next to me...

286
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:24,503
when shooting the opening.

287
00:13:25,403 --> 00:13:27,603
I was really shocked. He's just good-looking.

288
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:28,713
Yes.

289
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:31,512
Of course, Hao.

290
00:13:31,513 --> 00:13:32,543
Yes.

291
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:34,783
The person I voted for...

292
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,052
was Kang Min.

293
00:13:37,053 --> 00:13:38,053
Leo.

294
00:13:38,054 --> 00:13:39,382
(Han Harry June voted for Leo.)

295
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:41,222
Since you voted for different people,

296
00:13:41,223 --> 00:13:42,353
would you like a battle?

297
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:45,023
First of all, Kang Min's lips are as pretty as cherries.

298
00:13:45,663 --> 00:13:48,333
(Lips like cherry that Dong Heon approved of)

299
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:53,233
Leo has good proportions.

300
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:55,502
(Lee Leo was born with good proportions.)

301
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:57,733
(Proportion?)

302
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:00,303
You punk.

303
00:14:00,803 --> 00:14:02,943
You can be tall here.

304
00:14:03,673 --> 00:14:04,683
He's taller.

305
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:06,512
Why are you doing this?

306
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:07,883
He raised him.

307
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:10,113
- Go up. - Why are you doing this?

308
00:14:10,213 --> 00:14:11,622
- Go up. - Look at that.

309
00:14:11,623 --> 00:14:13,753
Look. You have great proportions.

310
00:14:14,123 --> 00:14:15,923
(Dreams come true.)

311
00:14:16,153 --> 00:14:17,923
I voted for Zhang Jia Hao.

312
00:14:18,663 --> 00:14:20,123
I like...

313
00:14:20,463 --> 00:14:21,563
serious faces.

314
00:14:21,963 --> 00:14:23,163
That doesn't sound nice.

315
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:24,702
Serious?

316
00:14:24,703 --> 00:14:26,603
I like faces that look fierce.

317
00:14:27,503 --> 00:14:30,472
Skinny and long body and delicate nose.

318
00:14:30,473 --> 00:14:31,743
He's really handsome.

319
00:14:32,573 --> 00:14:34,343
A cool charm.

320
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,443
We're both Zhangs. I like him more because of that.

321
00:14:37,813 --> 00:14:39,583
I love you, Jia Hao.

322
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,753
Goodness. He's cute.

323
00:14:43,613 --> 00:14:45,223
- Cute. - Cute.

324
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:46,723
I choose...

325
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,253
Sang Won.

326
00:14:48,623 --> 00:14:49,723
He's handsome.

327
00:14:50,853 --> 00:14:53,362
I like faces with a pure image...

328
00:14:53,363 --> 00:14:56,532
like Sang Won.

329
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:58,503
- He's handsome. - That's a movie.

330
00:14:58,763 --> 00:15:02,573
The jaw line looks really great.

331
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:06,103
Pretty eyes, nose, and lips.

332
00:15:06,743 --> 00:15:08,143
He has perfect proportions.

333
00:15:09,513 --> 00:15:10,613
They chose each other.

334
00:15:11,173 --> 00:15:12,183
Leo.

335
00:15:13,783 --> 00:15:15,912
He's fair, pretty, and so handsome.

336
00:15:15,913 --> 00:15:17,913
His head is tilted at a perfect angle,

337
00:15:18,923 --> 00:15:21,523
and he looks like a model.

338
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:23,192
They're all handsome.

339
00:15:23,193 --> 00:15:24,223
(Checking his looks)

340
00:15:24,353 --> 00:15:25,363
I envy them.

341
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,992
(Singing)

342
00:15:28,993 --> 00:15:30,833
(They walk cheerfully.)

343
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:35,102
- Let's go. - Let's go.

344
00:15:35,103 --> 00:15:36,173
Let's go.

345
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,673
(Amid so many good-looking participants, )

346
00:15:43,813 --> 00:15:46,012
(one person confidently stands at the center.)

347
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:48,812
(His name...)

348
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:51,213
(is Li Zi Hao.)

349
00:15:55,793 --> 00:15:57,892
Li Zi Hao.

350
00:15:57,893 --> 00:16:00,892
(Li Zi Hao)

351
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,493
- Li Zi Hao! - Li Zi Hao!

352
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:04,563
He's the main visual.

353
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:06,603
Right at the center.

354
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,873
What's wrong?

355
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,872
I didn't think I'd be at the center.

356
00:16:12,873 --> 00:16:14,443
You're the center member.

357
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:18,812
(They quickly make their choice.)

358
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:19,943
They chose.

359
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:22,252
I chose He Xin Long from our team.

360
00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:24,752
He's really like an alpha male.

361
00:16:24,753 --> 00:16:26,483
Do you know what I mean? Alpha.

362
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:28,293
He kills people with his face.

363
00:16:29,393 --> 00:16:30,552
He's from our team.

364
00:16:30,553 --> 00:16:32,193
(He shoots people with his face.)

365
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:35,733
What's that?

366
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,033
What am I going to do?

367
00:16:42,973 --> 00:16:44,073
Zi Hao.

368
00:16:45,973 --> 00:16:49,173
(He's touched.)

369
00:16:50,873 --> 00:16:51,983
That's loyalty.

370
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,083
This is it.

371
00:16:55,953 --> 00:16:58,183
It makes your heart warm.

372
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:02,393
If you could be born again, would you like to be born as Li Zi Hao?

373
00:17:02,793 --> 00:17:03,853
Me?

374
00:17:04,493 --> 00:17:07,963
I think there will be better choices.

375
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:13,102
(Their friendship is only allowed in this life.)

376
00:17:13,103 --> 00:17:14,133
Hey.

377
00:17:15,903 --> 00:17:17,732
No.

378
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:18,772
(Laughing)

379
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:19,842
After the profiles were released,

380
00:17:19,843 --> 00:17:22,142
your looks became a hot topic.

381
00:17:22,143 --> 00:17:23,143
Yes.

382
00:17:23,413 --> 00:17:26,112
I was honestly shocked by the official picture.

383
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:27,742
But my face...

384
00:17:27,743 --> 00:17:30,953
is a bit difficult.

385
00:17:31,213 --> 00:17:32,483
I have a strong look.

386
00:17:32,983 --> 00:17:34,723
I think it's really nice.

387
00:17:35,493 --> 00:17:39,722
I really like it because I can get more attention.

388
00:17:39,723 --> 00:17:44,633
Also, there are many memes made with my face.

389
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:47,063
You can freely use it.

390
00:17:47,403 --> 00:17:48,933
I'm happy.

391
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:54,103
The heated competition at Planet Camp...

392
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:57,543
was Planet Alpha Visual Contest.

393
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:01,183
The first place was born from a fierce battle.

394
00:18:01,883 --> 00:18:04,082
- It will be revealed here. - Now?

395
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,182
Who would it be?

396
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:08,223
Out of the six final candidates,

397
00:18:08,323 --> 00:18:11,622
the candidate voted first as the official visual member...

398
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:14,933
will be announced.

399
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,733
This will be an honor.

400
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:21,032
- You'll keep this forever. - The most handsome participant.

401
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,402
The most handsome person.

402
00:18:22,403 --> 00:18:23,832
- That will last forever. - The most handsome person.

403
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,573
Personally, I think it's Li Zi Hao.

404
00:18:25,643 --> 00:18:27,102
- Me too. - Who is it?

405
00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:28,842
This makes you excited.

406
00:18:28,843 --> 00:18:30,163
I wouldn't object to anyone here.

407
00:18:30,673 --> 00:18:31,843
Let's go, Hao.

408
00:18:32,283 --> 00:18:33,383
Either of us.

409
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:38,013
The official visual participant of BOYS II PLANET...

410
00:18:38,213 --> 00:18:39,213
is...

411
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:40,753
Right away?

412
00:18:40,883 --> 00:18:43,322
(Drumroll)

413
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:44,723
I think it's Sang Won.

414
00:18:45,493 --> 00:18:46,563
Commercial.

415
00:18:47,223 --> 00:18:49,833
Lee Sang Won. Congratulations.

416
00:18:50,693 --> 00:18:55,773
(Alpha Visual winner, Lee Sang Won)

417
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:58,773
(Alpha Visual winner, Lee Sang Won)

418
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:00,373
(Exclaiming)

419
00:19:03,673 --> 00:19:05,083
First of all,

420
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:08,413
I'm very flustered.

421
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:12,183
I'm very...

422
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:14,053
(Sighing)

423
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,993
It has started.

424
00:19:16,993 --> 00:19:21,523
(We can't listen to his speech without increasing the speed.)

425
00:19:23,893 --> 00:19:25,632
(We'll replace the long speech with a clip.)

426
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:28,803
The participants chose me.

427
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:31,173
I think it's a great honor.

428
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:35,073
Also, I think all of us look good.

429
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:37,873
I want you to know that.

430
00:19:38,783 --> 00:19:39,783
Thank you.

431
00:19:39,784 --> 00:19:42,212
(BOYS II PLANET official top visual member. Thank you.)

432
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:43,982
(Lee Sang Won)

433
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:46,982
Yes. He was also very humble.

434
00:19:46,983 --> 00:19:48,922
The top visual participant.

435
00:19:48,923 --> 00:19:51,023
We heard Lee Sang Won's speech.

436
00:19:51,553 --> 00:19:53,993
We will officially begin...

437
00:19:54,223 --> 00:19:58,333
the First Survivor Announcement...

438
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:00,903
now.

439
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,933
(1st Survivor Announcement)

440
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,773
You know,

441
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,572
some participants won the 300,000 benefit points.

442
00:20:09,573 --> 00:20:11,442
- Right. - I can't predict anything.

443
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:12,882
- They'll all go to the front. - Right.

444
00:20:12,883 --> 00:20:16,483
It's better for the latter team if the former team doesn't get called.

445
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,853
I think the rankings will be different from last time.

446
00:20:20,023 --> 00:20:21,423
I think it's going to change a bit.

447
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:25,762
The first team whose survivors will be announced first...

448
00:20:25,763 --> 00:20:27,393
- Which team? - Which team will it be?

449
00:20:27,663 --> 00:20:29,132
I want to go first,

450
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:30,293
but I also want to go last.

451
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:32,603
Let it not be "Whiplash."

452
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:36,632
As long as it's not us.

453
00:20:36,633 --> 00:20:37,733
- Not us, please. - No.

454
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:39,443
- Please. - I can't look.

455
00:20:41,243 --> 00:20:44,443
- It's Team "Rising Sun." - What?

456
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:46,543
Team "Rising Sun?"

457
00:20:46,643 --> 00:20:47,912
It's "Rising Sun?"

458
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,653
Let's go, Ye Chan.

459
00:20:50,353 --> 00:20:52,022
(TVXQ! "Rising Sun")

460
00:20:52,023 --> 00:20:55,523
Team "Rising Sun," please come forward.

461
00:20:55,553 --> 00:20:56,692
Oh, my gosh!

462
00:20:56,693 --> 00:20:57,722
Gosh, let's go.

463
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,363
Let's go.

464
00:20:59,723 --> 00:21:00,892
- That's nerve-racking. - Let's go.

465
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:02,233
It's really happening.

466
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:03,633
Go, Team!

467
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,433
I actually feel at ease.

468
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,173
- I am terrified. - Me too.

469
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:11,473
I've only seen this on TV.

470
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:14,303
- I've only seen it happen on TV. - It's my third time.

471
00:21:14,443 --> 00:21:16,043
- It's your third time? - Yes.

472
00:21:16,273 --> 00:21:18,443
I can't believe I get to see this with my eyes.

473
00:21:18,743 --> 00:21:19,913
I don't believe it.

474
00:21:20,283 --> 00:21:22,653
- I'm really scared. - Seriously.

475
00:21:22,953 --> 00:21:24,853
- I think they will all move up. - Go, guys!

476
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:27,723
Won Jun is in danger.

477
00:21:28,317 --> 00:21:31,917
I wonder if Sato made it into the Top Ten.

478
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,010
Let's go, Harry!

479
00:21:34,623 --> 00:21:37,463
Team "Rising Sun" was the only one...

480
00:21:37,593 --> 00:21:39,233
to battle within the same rank.

481
00:21:39,703 --> 00:21:41,463
- Both did well. - They both did well.

482
00:21:42,173 --> 00:21:43,673
I hope everyone survives.

483
00:21:45,473 --> 00:21:48,113
(Kim Dong Yun became the leader for the first time and struggled.)

484
00:21:49,243 --> 00:21:51,342
(But he didn't give up...)

485
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,243
(and prepared harder for his team.)

486
00:21:54,843 --> 00:21:56,952
(And "Rising Sun" Team 2 was able to perform...)

487
00:21:56,953 --> 00:21:59,053
(with stellar teamwork.)

488
00:21:59,823 --> 00:22:02,823
(Team 2 put on a very impressive performance.)

489
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,192
(Team 1 delivered a powerful performance, )

490
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:09,533
(setting the standard for group choreography.)

491
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:12,932
(Team 2, Individual Score 464, Team Score 188, Total Score 652)

492
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:14,002
(Team 1 wins, Team 2 loses.)

493
00:22:14,003 --> 00:22:16,033
(Team 1 won the 1-on-1 Class Battle.)

494
00:22:16,133 --> 00:22:18,703
(Team 1 won 100,000 benefits.)

495
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:22,743
"Rising Sun" Team One won the battle...

496
00:22:22,813 --> 00:22:24,573
and the team benefits.

497
00:22:24,813 --> 00:22:26,783
Did the benefits...

498
00:22:27,043 --> 00:22:29,553
increase the number of survivors from Team One?

499
00:22:29,983 --> 00:22:32,523
I will announce the result.

500
00:22:34,523 --> 00:22:36,353
I didn't want to find it out this soon.

501
00:22:36,793 --> 00:22:37,893
Oh, dear.

502
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,103
Don't you think there will be more survivors though?

503
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,162
The ranking of the top-scoring participant...

504
00:22:42,163 --> 00:22:45,533
who survived from Team "Rising Sun" is…

505
00:22:46,303 --> 00:22:48,063
My guess is 12th place.

506
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,933
Is the highest ranking 11th place?

507
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,373
It's 11th place.

508
00:22:54,143 --> 00:22:56,112
(Survivor, 11th Place)

509
00:22:56,113 --> 00:22:57,212
- That's really high. - The 11th place?

510
00:22:57,213 --> 00:22:58,612
- It's you. - It must be you.

511
00:22:58,613 --> 00:22:59,913
- It's you. - Is it me?

512
00:23:00,483 --> 00:23:01,542
Is it me?

513
00:23:01,543 --> 00:23:03,612
- Sato? - Masato.

514
00:23:03,613 --> 00:23:06,053
(8th Place, Masato, Week 3 interim ranking)

515
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,783
It has to be Masato.

516
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,323
It could be Sun Heng Yu.

517
00:23:09,623 --> 00:23:11,022
Sun Heng Yu and Masato?

518
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:12,323
Sun Heng Yu.

519
00:23:12,863 --> 00:23:15,693
I can't believe this participant ranked 11th place.

520
00:23:15,793 --> 00:23:17,463
- What? - "This participant?"

521
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:20,502
It's exceeding my expectations from the beginning.

522
00:23:20,503 --> 00:23:22,502
- Jun Il. - Right.

523
00:23:22,503 --> 00:23:24,033
There's Jun Il too.

524
00:23:24,173 --> 00:23:26,503
The participant in 11th place...

525
00:23:26,743 --> 00:23:29,049
impressed Star Creators around the world with the effort...

526
00:23:29,073 --> 00:23:31,112
- and determination... - Heng Yu?

527
00:23:31,113 --> 00:23:33,382
- he showed during practice. - Isn't it Sato?

528
00:23:33,383 --> 00:23:34,483
It must be Sato then.

529
00:23:34,743 --> 00:23:36,082
(During the Signal Song Training, )

530
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,489
(everyone thought Masato would receive No Star.)

531
00:23:37,513 --> 00:23:40,082
(But with his dedication and determination, )

532
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,693
(he practiced endlessly and ended up surviving.)

533
00:23:43,393 --> 00:23:45,473
Wasn't Masato the one who showed it during practice?

534
00:23:45,623 --> 00:23:46,822
It could be Sun Heng Yu.

535
00:23:46,823 --> 00:23:48,983
Sun Heng Yu? He practiced until his voice went hoarse.

536
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:55,003
(Sun Heng Yu strained his throat from his passionate practice.)

537
00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:56,673
I couldn't sing at all.

538
00:23:58,533 --> 00:24:03,813
(Even if he wasn't feeling well, he didn't give up and did his best.)

539
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:10,952
He is also a participant with exceptional sensitivity...

540
00:24:10,953 --> 00:24:13,423
- Heng Yu. - and empathy.

541
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:15,423
- It must be Sato. - His MBTI type is...

542
00:24:16,553 --> 00:24:18,722
INFP.

543
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:20,323
- Who is it? - Who is it?

544
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:21,622
(INFP shyly points at himself.)

545
00:24:21,623 --> 00:24:22,833
- Sato? - It's Sato.

546
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:24,863
- It's Sato. - It's Sato.

547
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,933
- You are INFP too? - That's going too far.

548
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,702
- You are INFP too? - I am INFP too.

549
00:24:29,703 --> 00:24:31,803
- You are INFP too? - I'm INFP too.

550
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:33,402
- Really? - What?

551
00:24:33,403 --> 00:24:34,842
Are they the same type?

552
00:24:34,843 --> 00:24:36,142
- They are both INFP? - What?

553
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:37,813
- They are both INFP? - Heng Yu too?

554
00:24:37,973 --> 00:24:39,413
- No way. - Gosh.

555
00:24:40,543 --> 00:24:41,642
Does it make sense?

556
00:24:41,643 --> 00:24:42,983
It has to be one of them.

557
00:24:43,183 --> 00:24:44,683
No wonder we clicked.

558
00:24:45,723 --> 00:24:47,622
This person who ranked 11th place...

559
00:24:47,623 --> 00:24:49,143
will be the first person to survive...

560
00:24:49,193 --> 00:24:50,793
in the First Survivor Announcement.

561
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:52,793
I will announce who it is.

562
00:24:53,523 --> 00:24:55,063
The 11th place is really high.

563
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,593
If Sato ranked 11th place,

564
00:24:57,193 --> 00:24:58,433
it means his ranking went down.

565
00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:00,303
Is it Sato?

566
00:25:00,703 --> 00:25:02,033
- I am not sure. - Masato.

567
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:05,233
The All Star Survivor who ranked 11th place.

568
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:07,743
It has to be Heng Yu.

569
00:25:08,003 --> 00:25:09,312
- Is it Sato? - Sun Heng Yu.

570
00:25:09,313 --> 00:25:10,543
- Is it Heng Yu? - Sato?

571
00:25:10,973 --> 00:25:12,043
I'm really not sure.

572
00:25:12,713 --> 00:25:14,043
- This is so scary. - Gosh.

573
00:25:14,343 --> 00:25:16,553
- I hope Masato will make it. - The things they say...

574
00:25:17,313 --> 00:25:18,453
I think it's Masato.

575
00:25:19,883 --> 00:25:22,323
It's Sun Heng Yu of Team One.

576
00:25:23,993 --> 00:25:25,693
Well done, you.

577
00:25:26,223 --> 00:25:27,463
Good job.

578
00:25:27,963 --> 00:25:29,032
Good job.

579
00:25:29,033 --> 00:25:30,533
- He's amazing. - Thank you.

580
00:25:30,793 --> 00:25:32,913
- He ranked 11th place. I envy him! - That's amazing.

581
00:25:33,103 --> 00:25:34,903
He did well.

582
00:25:35,003 --> 00:25:36,072
Good job, Sun Heng Yu.

583
00:25:36,073 --> 00:25:37,732
Well done, Sun Heng Yu!

584
00:25:37,733 --> 00:25:39,403
- He's amazing. - Sun Heng Yu!

585
00:25:39,503 --> 00:25:41,173
I got chills. Gosh.

586
00:25:41,543 --> 00:25:43,042
The 11th place is really high.

587
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:44,749
Driven by an unwavering desire for the stage,

588
00:25:44,773 --> 00:25:46,712
he touched the hearts...

589
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:48,783
of Star Creators across the globe.

590
00:25:49,113 --> 00:25:50,683
Congratulations on your survival.

591
00:25:50,953 --> 00:25:52,052
Thank you.

592
00:25:52,053 --> 00:25:53,822
(Sun Heng Yu, who became the first to survive, ranks 11th.)

593
00:25:53,823 --> 00:25:55,793
The 11th place is really high.

594
00:25:55,953 --> 00:25:58,153
His throat was in bad condition, and he still did well.

595
00:25:58,193 --> 00:26:00,193
I wonder what the next ranking will be.

596
00:26:00,423 --> 00:26:02,433
I think it will be 12th and 13th place next.

597
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:06,662
I will continue with the next announcement.

598
00:26:06,663 --> 00:26:08,002
I'm so nervous. Gosh.

599
00:26:08,003 --> 00:26:10,073
The next survivor's ranking...

600
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,703
is 30th place.

601
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,302
- What? - Just like that?

602
00:26:13,303 --> 00:26:14,942
It's such a sharp drop.

603
00:26:14,943 --> 00:26:15,973
Just like that?

604
00:26:16,273 --> 00:26:17,573
How can it drop so sharply?

605
00:26:17,773 --> 00:26:19,253
- It's 30th place? - It's 30th place?

606
00:26:19,483 --> 00:26:20,612
I think it's Jun Il.

607
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:21,643
Could it be Hai?

608
00:26:22,153 --> 00:26:23,253
There's Dong Yun too.

609
00:26:24,153 --> 00:26:25,623
The participant who ranked 30th...

610
00:26:26,283 --> 00:26:28,553
has the Korean consonant ieung in his name.

611
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:29,923
It's Jun Il.

612
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:31,123
It must be Jun Il.

613
00:26:32,093 --> 00:26:34,199
His name contains at least two Korean consonants, ieung.

614
00:26:34,223 --> 00:26:35,763
It's not Jun Il.

615
00:26:35,993 --> 00:26:37,693
- Dang Hong Hai. - Dang Hong Hai.

616
00:26:37,993 --> 00:26:40,563
- It's you. - Ye Chan.

617
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:42,432
Yeom Ye Chan.

618
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:43,873
- Yeom Ye Chan. - It's not me.

619
00:26:44,233 --> 00:26:45,272
Dong Yun.

620
00:26:45,273 --> 00:26:46,373
- Dong Yun. - Right.

621
00:26:47,743 --> 00:26:49,843
I will reveal the participant who ranked 30th.

622
00:26:49,973 --> 00:26:52,212
The 2 Star survivor who ranked 30th.

623
00:26:52,213 --> 00:26:54,913
(Dang Hong Hai, Kim Dong Yun, Yeom Ye Chan)

624
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:56,752
It's Dang Hong Hai of Team One.

625
00:26:56,753 --> 00:26:58,922
(The survivor who ranked 30th is Dang Hong Hai of Team 1.)

626
00:26:58,923 --> 00:26:59,982
Congratulations.

627
00:26:59,983 --> 00:27:01,382
- Well done. - Well done.

628
00:27:01,383 --> 00:27:02,522
You went through so much.

629
00:27:02,523 --> 00:27:03,999
("Rising Sun" Team 2 members congratulate him.)

630
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:05,693
Dang Hong Hai's name has many of ieung.

631
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:07,813
I can't believe I get to see you here.

632
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:10,333
- I'm so glad. - I know.

633
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:12,433
We were both Team C.

634
00:27:13,363 --> 00:27:15,873
If the announcement is made in descending order...

635
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:18,173
What would the next rank be?

636
00:27:18,433 --> 00:27:20,373
The ranking of the next survivor...

637
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:22,243
is 35th.

638
00:27:23,213 --> 00:27:25,273
- It's Jun Il. - It's Jun Il.

639
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:26,613
There's Dong Yun too.

640
00:27:26,843 --> 00:27:28,782
I never know because I didn't receive any benefits.

641
00:27:28,783 --> 00:27:31,013
Ye Chan originally ranked 35th, right?

642
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:33,083
- It could be Ye Chan. - Ye Chan.

643
00:27:33,253 --> 00:27:36,492
I graduated from Hanlim Arts School.

644
00:27:36,493 --> 00:27:37,952
- It's Ye Chan. - It's Ye Chan.

645
00:27:37,953 --> 00:27:38,962
It's him.

646
00:27:38,963 --> 00:27:40,122
(Park Jun Il graduated from Hanlim Arts School.)

647
00:27:40,123 --> 00:27:41,622
Practical Dance Major.

648
00:27:41,623 --> 00:27:43,263
The participant who ranked 35th...

649
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:45,032
and I graduated from the same high school.

650
00:27:45,033 --> 00:27:46,632
(They all graduated from Hanlim Arts School.)

651
00:27:46,633 --> 00:27:48,562
Yeom Ye Chan went to Hanlim Arts School too.

652
00:27:48,563 --> 00:27:50,973
It might be Harry June or Jun Il.

653
00:27:51,273 --> 00:27:53,303
The survivor who ranked 35th is...

654
00:27:53,443 --> 00:27:54,602
- Harry June? - Is it Harry June?

655
00:27:54,603 --> 00:27:56,342
(Han Harry June 47th, Park Jun Il 33rd)

656
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:57,513
(Yeom Ye Chan 35th)

657
00:27:57,713 --> 00:27:58,982
It's Park Jun Il.

658
00:27:58,983 --> 00:28:02,713
(Park Jun Il from Team 1 ranked 35th.)

659
00:28:02,813 --> 00:28:04,013
- Congratulations. - Good job.

660
00:28:04,213 --> 00:28:06,023
Everyone is from Team One.

661
00:28:06,553 --> 00:28:09,422
In charge of the killing part of "Rising Sun" Team One,

662
00:28:09,423 --> 00:28:10,993
he made himself known.

663
00:28:11,393 --> 00:28:12,822
Congratulations on your survival.

664
00:28:12,823 --> 00:28:15,192
- So many from Team 1. - They are all from Team 1.

665
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,963
(Park Jun Il, 35th)

666
00:28:17,993 --> 00:28:19,333
Sun Heng Yu.

667
00:28:19,763 --> 00:28:21,433
How does it feel to survive?

668
00:28:22,673 --> 00:28:26,803
Honestly, I had no idea that so many Star Creators...

669
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:30,443
would be cheering for me.

670
00:28:31,213 --> 00:28:33,982
I feel like I'm rewarded...

671
00:28:33,983 --> 00:28:35,443
for all the hard work I've put in.

672
00:28:36,113 --> 00:28:37,452
I'm very grateful.

673
00:28:37,453 --> 00:28:40,183
Everyone from "Rising Team" Team 1 and 2 did well.

674
00:28:40,983 --> 00:28:42,353
I will be waiting from above.

675
00:28:42,623 --> 00:28:44,023
I know you will come up.

676
00:28:44,123 --> 00:28:45,153
Thank you.

677
00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:52,033
Please move to your assigned seat...

678
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:53,603
according to your rank.

679
00:28:58,173 --> 00:29:00,003
Since I was given one more chance,

680
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:02,813
I won't miss this chance and move up to All Star.

681
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,112
I will not disappoint them...

682
00:29:07,113 --> 00:29:08,443
and make a debut.

683
00:29:10,283 --> 00:29:11,683
The first All Star.

684
00:29:12,153 --> 00:29:13,253
Right.

685
00:29:13,453 --> 00:29:15,283
We already have the first All Star.

686
00:29:16,023 --> 00:29:17,193
So high.

687
00:29:17,493 --> 00:29:18,653
So high.

688
00:29:21,063 --> 00:29:22,093
Nice seat.

689
00:29:22,223 --> 00:29:23,232
Thank you.

690
00:29:23,233 --> 00:29:26,063
(Everyone envies the All Star seat.)

691
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:28,933
Team "Rising Sun."

692
00:29:29,503 --> 00:29:32,003
Among the remaining 12 participants,

693
00:29:32,443 --> 00:29:35,043
will there be another survivor whose name will be called?

694
00:29:35,613 --> 00:29:37,772
- There must be. - There must be.

695
00:29:37,773 --> 00:29:38,873
Is there one?

696
00:29:41,543 --> 00:29:42,883
There is...

697
00:29:43,253 --> 00:29:44,313
No way.

698
00:29:46,123 --> 00:29:47,223
A survivor left.

699
00:29:48,183 --> 00:29:50,723
- Stop it. - He's mean.

700
00:29:51,353 --> 00:29:52,693
My heart hurts.

701
00:29:53,663 --> 00:29:55,663
You have to go.

702
00:29:55,993 --> 00:29:57,793
I don't know now.

703
00:29:59,663 --> 00:30:02,433
The rank of the survivor whose name will be called now...

704
00:30:04,733 --> 00:30:06,843
is 37th.

705
00:30:07,443 --> 00:30:09,543
(Survivor, 37th Place)

706
00:30:09,673 --> 00:30:11,312
The participant ranking 37th...

707
00:30:11,313 --> 00:30:13,142
is an experienced trainee...

708
00:30:13,143 --> 00:30:15,482
who sang a duet...

709
00:30:15,483 --> 00:30:17,783
in the Class Placement Match.

710
00:30:17,853 --> 00:30:19,953
- Dong Yun. - Either Harry or Dong Yun.

711
00:30:20,523 --> 00:30:21,853
There's Ye Chan too.

712
00:30:22,183 --> 00:30:23,922
- Three participants. - Three participants.

713
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:25,662
- Ye Chan, get moving. - Three participants.

714
00:30:25,663 --> 00:30:26,963
- No. - Let's get going.

715
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:28,923
Let's go, Harry.

716
00:30:29,026 --> 00:30:30,266
Let's go, Harry.

717
00:30:30,633 --> 00:30:33,163
If it's accumulated, Ye Chan's rank might be higher.

718
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:34,463
I didn't get the benefit.

719
00:30:34,863 --> 00:30:35,872
Dong Yun?

720
00:30:35,873 --> 00:30:37,233
Dong Yun is also pretty high up.

721
00:30:37,533 --> 00:30:38,602
(47th, Han Harry June, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

722
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,603
- This is wild. - You can still do it.

723
00:30:41,103 --> 00:30:43,742
Here's the 37th-place participant.

724
00:30:43,743 --> 00:30:45,072
Harry, it's all about drive. Let's go.

725
00:30:45,073 --> 00:30:46,142
(47th, Han Harry June, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

726
00:30:46,143 --> 00:30:48,312
The participant to be ranked 37th in the 2 Star Class is...

727
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:51,653
(Who will be 37th in the 2 Star Class?)

728
00:30:51,913 --> 00:30:53,153
Whoever it is...

729
00:30:53,683 --> 00:30:54,953
This is so nerve-racking.

730
00:30:57,793 --> 00:30:58,823
Please.

731
00:31:01,423 --> 00:31:03,432
(Everyone's on the edge of their seat.)

732
00:31:03,433 --> 00:31:04,433
Seriously.

00:31:04,434 --> 00:31:07,132
(47th, Han Harry June, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

734
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:08,233
(Exclaiming)

735
00:31:08,803 --> 00:31:09,832
That startled me.

736
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:10,972
(38th, Kim Dong Yun, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

737
00:31:10,973 --> 00:31:13,073
(35th, Yeom Ye Chan, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

738
00:31:13,403 --> 00:31:15,002
- I'm so nervous. - Same.

739
00:31:15,003 --> 00:31:16,312
(Ham Hyun Seo, 1 Star)

740
00:31:16,313 --> 00:31:17,512
Please tell us.

741
00:31:17,513 --> 00:31:18,643
This is killing me.

742
00:31:21,243 --> 00:31:22,452
It's Kim Dong Yun.

743
00:31:22,453 --> 00:31:23,712
(Dong Yun is 37th.)

744
00:31:23,713 --> 00:31:25,453
Dong Yun!

745
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:26,783
Congrats.

746
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:30,453
- Dong Yun. - He did it without the benefit.

747
00:31:30,623 --> 00:31:32,123
He's gone through a lot.

748
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:33,823
Please do it for Hyeop too.

749
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:37,393
Good work, Dong Yun.

750
00:31:37,693 --> 00:31:39,063
Our leader.

751
00:31:39,533 --> 00:31:40,863
The first survivor of Team Two.

752
00:31:41,403 --> 00:31:42,702
(1st round voting score: 285,462, 2nd round Korea vote count: 97,484)

(2nd round converted voting score: 892,690)

755
00:31:45,273 --> 00:31:46,402
The next highest-ranking participant...

756
00:31:46,403 --> 00:31:49,213
to survive within Team "Rising Sun" is...

757
00:31:49,913 --> 00:31:51,043
So, there's more.

758
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:53,713
Maybe 30th or 40th?

759
00:31:54,243 --> 00:31:55,713
He's ranked 39th.

760
00:31:56,113 --> 00:31:57,153
Really?

761
00:31:57,813 --> 00:32:00,123
- This is tough. - There's another one.

762
00:32:00,683 --> 00:32:01,882
(47th, Han Harry June, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

763
00:32:01,883 --> 00:32:03,053
This is driving me insane.

764
00:32:03,453 --> 00:32:05,023
The 39th-place participant is...

765
00:32:05,863 --> 00:32:08,423
skilled and experienced.

766
00:32:08,463 --> 00:32:10,162
It's either Harry or Ye Chan.

767
00:32:10,163 --> 00:32:11,592
- It must be Harry. - They both fit the description.

768
00:32:11,593 --> 00:32:13,562
- It's Harry or Ye Chan. - I can't predict it.

769
00:32:13,563 --> 00:32:14,662
But Ye Chan...

770
00:32:14,663 --> 00:32:15,933
Let's go, Ye Chan.

771
00:32:16,203 --> 00:32:18,103
And it turns out...

772
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,603
that he changed his hair color today.

773
00:32:20,743 --> 00:32:22,672
They both dyed their hair!

774
00:32:22,673 --> 00:32:23,873
They both did!

775
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:26,213
And he looks very pretty.

776
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:30,313
Stop doing this to us!

777
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,023
They both dyed their hair.

778
00:32:33,383 --> 00:32:35,453
- We both did. - Yes, you did.

779
00:32:36,223 --> 00:32:38,992
But Harry received the benefit.

780
00:32:38,993 --> 00:32:40,022
He did.

781
00:32:40,023 --> 00:32:42,662
I will announce the 39-place participant.

782
00:32:42,663 --> 00:32:44,263
I think it's Ye Chan.

783
00:32:44,433 --> 00:32:45,532
- I have... - Number 39...

784
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:47,013
- a feeling that it's Harry. - Harry.

785
00:32:47,103 --> 00:32:48,733
- I bet it's Harry. - Harry.

786
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,033
Ye Chan.

787
00:32:52,273 --> 00:32:53,543
Tell us now.

788
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:57,913
- It's Yeom Ye Chan. - Ye Chan!

789
00:32:59,583 --> 00:33:01,843
Ye Chan!

790
00:33:02,483 --> 00:33:03,553
Nice.

791
00:33:03,753 --> 00:33:06,182
- Congratulations! - This is great.

792
00:33:06,183 --> 00:33:08,022
- Well done. - You're not crying, are you?

793
00:33:08,023 --> 00:33:09,123
(39th, Yeom Ye Chan)

794
00:33:09,923 --> 00:33:11,023
He's done it.

795
00:33:13,123 --> 00:33:14,593
Congratulations on surviving.

796
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,839
There aren't any other survivors on our team now.

797
00:33:16,863 --> 00:33:17,863
Oh, no.

798
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:20,132
I hope it doesn't end like this.

Team "Rising Sun" Two.

801
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,643
It was my first time being a leader,

802
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:30,213
so I wasn't nearly as good as Dong Heon.

803
00:33:30,613 --> 00:33:31,913
- But... - You did great.

804
00:33:32,173 --> 00:33:34,413
The teammates thankfully followed me,

805
00:33:34,883 --> 00:33:37,752
so I believe we pulled off...

806
00:33:37,753 --> 00:33:39,823
a meaningful performance.

807
00:33:40,523 --> 00:33:42,752
I don't think I'll ever be able to forget...

808
00:33:42,753 --> 00:33:45,123
the performance and the teammates of Team "Rising Sun" Two.

809
00:33:45,353 --> 00:33:47,363
I want to sincerely thank them.

810
00:33:51,693 --> 00:33:54,932
The members of Team "Rising Sun" One.

811
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:57,202
Although we competed with each other,

812
00:33:57,203 --> 00:34:00,443
I learned a lot from you.

813
00:34:01,203 --> 00:34:04,273
I hope that both teams can move on to the next one.

814
00:34:04,413 --> 00:34:05,443
Thank you.

815
00:34:08,043 --> 00:34:11,113
Now, please move to the seat of your ranking.

816
00:34:11,753 --> 00:34:13,853
- What was my ranking? - You're 39th.

817
00:34:14,383 --> 00:34:15,822
He doesn't even know where he's ranked.

818
00:34:15,823 --> 00:34:17,053
He forgot his number.

Among the ten remaining participants,

823
00:34:30,273 --> 00:34:32,973
will there be more members to survive?

824
00:34:33,543 --> 00:34:35,473
- There has to be. - I bet there are.

825
00:34:35,743 --> 00:34:37,643
I believe there are more.

There's more. It must be.

833

There is none.

834
00:34:59,603 --> 00:35:00,633

835
00:35:00,903 --> 00:35:04,833
(The Survivor Announcement for Team "Rising Sun" is over.)

three members of Team One...

842

and two members of Team Two have survived.

843

Who knows? One of us could be ranked 47th.

844

I'm scared.

845
00:35:31,063 --> 00:35:32,663
We can still place 47th.

846
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:34,262
It's not over yet.

847
00:35:34,263 --> 00:35:35,732
You're right. It's not over yet.

It's not over yet.

852
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:46,343
- It's not over. - It's fine.

853
00:35:47,043 --> 00:35:48,143
It's okay.

854
00:35:48,683 --> 00:35:49,883
I feel terrible.

855

We don't know yet, Harry.

856
00:35:53,283 --> 00:35:54,383
I'm having a breakdown.

857
00:35:56,623 --> 00:35:58,353
I didn't know how nerve-racking it was.

858
00:35:58,853 --> 00:36:00,122
- Seriously. - Yun Seo, are you having fun?

No.

00:36:12,633 --> 00:36:13,903
Will it be our team?

864
00:36:14,203 --> 00:36:16,213
- I think it's us. - Team "KILL THE ROMEO."

865

I feel like it's our turn.

866
00:36:19,613 --> 00:36:20,643
Oh, man.

867
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:22,043
It is...

00:36:24,153 --> 00:36:25,852
Team "KILL THE ROMEO."

869
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:29,852
(Team "KILL THE ROMEO" will be called for survival next.)

870
00:36:29,853 --> 00:36:30,893
It's us.

871
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:35,292
(Team 2 was faced with a crisis from early on.)

872
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:38,992
(Their teamwork wasn't so good until the day of the rehearsal.)

873
00:36:38,993 --> 00:36:40,763
(Stop fighting. It's not a good look.)

874
00:36:41,303 --> 00:36:44,403
(Who will survive from Team "KILL THE ROMEO" 2?)

875
00:36:47,603 --> 00:36:48,842
(And Team "KILL THE ROMEO" 1)

876
00:36:48,843 --> 00:36:50,412
- Oh, gosh. - It'll be all right.

877
00:36:50,413 --> 00:36:51,472
- Let's go. - No!

878
00:36:51,473 --> 00:36:52,473
I choose Li Zi Hao.

879
00:36:52,474 --> 00:36:54,943
(They were very affectionate from when the team was formed.)

880
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:59,213
(But they were severely criticized during the interim check, )

881
00:36:59,523 --> 00:37:03,653
(and Yang Heui Chan replaced Xue Su Ren as the leader.)

882
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:07,392
(The team's bond grew stronger after that.)

883

I love you.

884
00:37:08,763 --> 00:37:12,962

(for winning the 1-on-1 Class Battle.)

00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:20,503
Good luck.

889
00:37:20,873 --> 00:37:22,242
Maybe it's Li Zi Hao.

890
00:37:22,243 --> 00:37:23,543
There's He Zhong Xing too.

891
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:25,812

I'm so nervous.

896
00:37:32,313 --> 00:37:33,852
I'm sure you'll survive.

(41th, Tatsuki, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

898
00:37:35,123 --> 00:37:36,193
Please.

The highest-ranking participant...

900
00:37:37,993 --> 00:37:40,793
to survive within Team "KILL THE ROMEO" is...

901
00:37:41,223 --> 00:37:42,323
What's the number?

902
00:37:43,293 --> 00:37:45,133
Ranked 26th.

903
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,803
Number 26?

904
00:37:47,033 --> 00:37:48,513
The highest is in the Two Star Class?

905
00:37:49,063 --> 00:37:50,832
Sen?

906
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:52,233
(23rd, Sen, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

907
00:37:52,273 --> 00:37:53,643
It's either Zhong Xing or Sen.

908
00:37:54,573 --> 00:37:55,843
There's also Li Zi Hao.

909
00:37:56,243 --> 00:37:58,273
The 26th-place participant...

910
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:01,913
was born in the winter.

911
00:38:02,043 --> 00:38:03,113
I was born in the summer.

912
00:38:04,153 --> 00:38:05,883
What? Born in the winter?

913
00:38:06,353 --> 00:38:08,623
Li Zi Hao's hair color suits the theme of winter.

914
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,722
(But he was born in autumn.)

915
00:38:10,723 --> 00:38:12,323
When was Zhong Xing born?

916
00:38:12,653 --> 00:38:13,863
Today is his birthday.

917
00:38:14,263 --> 00:38:16,462
I like the way they announce it.

918
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:17,663
When was Sen born?

919
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:19,093
I have no idea.

920
00:38:19,393 --> 00:38:21,002
But you're in the same agency. Don't you know his birthday?

921
00:38:21,003 --> 00:38:22,003
Winter?

922
00:38:22,163 --> 00:38:24,103
Were you born in the winter?

923
00:38:24,233 --> 00:38:25,432
Yes, I was.

924
00:38:25,433 --> 00:38:27,073
(Birthday, December 25, 2005)

925
00:38:27,503 --> 00:38:28,903
Do you know Tatsuki's birthday?

926
00:38:29,543 --> 00:38:30,643
No?

927
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:35,343
(Another participant who was born in the winter)

928
00:38:35,743 --> 00:38:37,483
The 26th-place participant.

929
00:38:38,253 --> 00:38:40,183
Who will it be?

930
00:38:40,553 --> 00:38:42,452
- From Team One, - Let's go.

931
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:43,453
Sen.

932
00:38:43,553 --> 00:38:44,553
(Sen from Team 1 is the 26th-place survivor.)

933
00:38:44,554 --> 00:38:45,693
Let's go, Sen!

934
00:38:46,593 --> 00:38:48,123
Congratulations.

935
00:38:48,323 --> 00:38:50,132
Let's go.

936
00:38:50,133 --> 00:38:52,293
(26th, 2,174,115 points, Sen)

937
00:38:52,593 --> 00:38:56,003
(He first joined with He Jia Hao from the same agency.)

938
00:38:56,373 --> 00:38:59,173
I had a really hard time after seeing my friend go.

939
00:39:00,073 --> 00:39:03,773
(And his journey on BOYS II PLANET began fresh.)

940
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:08,013
But I made a lot of friends while I was here,

941
00:39:08,943 --> 00:39:10,353
and I felt consoled.

942
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,623
I even received such a high ranking today,

943
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:17,653
so I'm impressed.

944
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,863
- He's crying. - Don't cry.

945
00:39:21,623 --> 00:39:22,992
(1st round voting score: 839,138, 2nd round Korea vote count: 90,133)

946
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:24,513
(2nd round global vote count: 647,373)

947
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:29,032
All right. The ranking of the next survivor...

948
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,372
(51st, Xue Su Ren, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

949
00:39:30,373 --> 00:39:31,709
(66th, Sho, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

950
00:39:31,733 --> 00:39:33,242
is 31st.

951
00:39:33,243 --> 00:39:34,542
(Number 31)

952
00:39:34,543 --> 00:39:35,572
Number 31?

953
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:37,073
This might be Li Zi Hao.

954
00:39:37,813 --> 00:39:39,373
Zhong Xing, what was your last ranking?

955
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,483
I think I was ranked 32nd, but I'm not sure.

956
00:39:42,643 --> 00:39:43,653
Give us a hint.

957
00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:45,913
The 31st-place survivor's...

958
00:39:46,153 --> 00:39:48,522
distinct character...

959
00:39:48,523 --> 00:39:51,392
(Distinct character)

960
00:39:51,393 --> 00:39:53,593
caught the eyes...

961
00:39:53,923 --> 00:39:55,592
of the Star Creators...

962
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:56,832
- Is it Zhong Xing? - across the globe.

963
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:57,933
He's laughing too.

964
00:39:58,093 --> 00:39:59,662
He has a very distinct character.

965
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:00,703
Your MBTI-type is SEXY!

966
00:40:05,873 --> 00:40:09,303
(The sexy guy, He Zhong Xing)

967
00:40:10,373 --> 00:40:11,812
He could step forward right now.

968
00:40:11,813 --> 00:40:13,343
But there's also Li Zi Hao.

969
00:40:13,513 --> 00:40:15,033
- It's not me. - It could also be him.

970
00:40:15,243 --> 00:40:16,813
He also has a unique style.

971
00:40:17,013 --> 00:40:19,353
(When filming the 1-on-1 Class Battle)

972
00:40:19,653 --> 00:40:22,122
(The titan of all titans)

973
00:40:22,123 --> 00:40:24,523
(Li Zi Hao dominated the atmosphere.)

974
00:40:24,693 --> 00:40:26,262
(- He's got a strong mindset. - You're a gentleman, not a titan.)

975
00:40:26,263 --> 00:40:28,539
(I sincerely root for him. His Cart Titan image is so cute.)

976
00:40:28,563 --> 00:40:30,203
Don't they both have distinct characters?

977
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:31,563
The sexy guy or the titan.

978
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:32,763
@merge with next

979
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:35,602
And this participant is beloved by many...

980
00:40:35,603 --> 00:40:37,103
for his one-of-a-kind appearance.

981
00:40:37,203 --> 00:40:40,102
- Hao, is he talking about you? - No.

982
00:40:40,103 --> 00:40:42,372
- Is it you? - What do you mean?

983
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,373
- Li Zi Hao. - You do have...
a one-of-a-kind appearance.

984
00:40:44,374 --> 00:40:45,734
He has a one-of-a-kind appearance?

985
00:40:45,913 --> 00:40:49,183
I will now announce the participant who has survived in 31st place.

986
00:40:50,983 --> 00:40:52,412
- My gosh. I was right. - Oh, my.

987
00:40:52,413 --> 00:40:54,853
Please tell us already.

988
00:40:55,183 --> 00:40:57,592
- It's Li Zi Hao. - Hey.

989
00:40:57,593 --> 00:40:59,152
- Hey. I told you. - My gosh.

990
00:40:59,153 --> 00:41:00,553
(Li Zi Hao survives in 31st place.)

991
00:41:01,923 --> 00:41:02,923
I believed in you.

992
00:41:03,393 --> 00:41:04,433
Let's go.

993
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:07,403
He is indeed a one-of-a-kind guy.

994
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:09,533
Congratulations on your survival.

995
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,102
- Hao. - That was great.

996
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:13,372
(Li Zi Hao, 31st, 1,838,909 points)

997
00:41:13,373 --> 00:41:14,573
His ranking went up a lot.

998
00:41:14,673 --> 00:41:15,903
He does have a special look.

999
00:41:16,943 --> 00:41:20,383
Will there be more survivors from Team "KILL THE ROMEO?"

1000
00:41:21,243 --> 00:41:23,352
- Come on. There must be more. - Yes.

1001
00:41:23,353 --> 00:41:24,659
(61st, Yang Heui Chan Week 3 Interim Ranking)

1002
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:26,422
It could be Tatsuki.

1003
00:41:26,423 --> 00:41:29,692
Excluding the Top 8 candidates and the participant in 47th place,

1004
00:41:29,693 --> 00:41:32,092
is there another survivor from Team "KILL THE ROMEO?"

1005
00:41:32,093 --> 00:41:33,893
- I wonder if there are any. - There must be.

1006
00:41:34,563 --> 00:41:36,433
- Yes, there is. - Yes.

1007
00:41:37,093 --> 00:41:40,133
- Let's go. Let's go, Zhong Xing. - Who will it be?

1008
00:41:41,003 --> 00:41:43,903
This participant came in 36th place.

1009
00:41:47,203 --> 00:41:49,303
- Who is it? - That was my first ranking.

1010
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:50,973
That spot will be filled.

1011
00:41:51,613 --> 00:41:52,942
- This will go to Zhong Xing. - I want that spot.

1012
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:53,943
Please.

1013
00:41:54,343 --> 00:41:56,082
- I will survive, no matter what. - I...

1014
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:57,382
- I think Tatsuki will be called. - Tatsuki?

1015
00:41:57,383 --> 00:41:59,512
Yes. He was in 41st place. He has a shot.

1016
00:41:59,513 --> 00:42:01,452
- It could be him with the benefit. - Right. It might be him.

1017
00:42:01,453 --> 00:42:02,822
Tatsuki has a shot too.

1018
00:42:02,823 --> 00:42:03,952
- Tatsuki? - It could be him.

1019
00:42:03,953 --> 00:42:05,252
- Tatsuki or Zhong Xing. - Tatsuki?

1020
00:42:05,253 --> 00:42:08,362
He received the Lose Sticker during the interim check...

1021
00:42:08,363 --> 00:42:10,133
for the 1-on-1 Class Battle.

1022
00:42:10,233 --> 00:42:11,553
Did Tatsuki get the Lose Sticker?

1023
00:42:11,633 --> 00:42:15,033
(When Zhong Xing received the Lose Sticker, )

1024
00:42:15,903 --> 00:42:18,503
(Tatsuki also received the Lose Sticker.)

1025
00:42:19,073 --> 00:42:20,433
Both of them got the Lose Sticker.

1026
00:42:20,503 --> 00:42:22,343
And did this participant...

1027
00:42:25,443 --> 00:42:28,283
throw away this Lose Sticker or not?

1028
00:42:30,383 --> 00:42:33,753
(Zhong Xing threw away the sticker without hesitation.)

1029
00:42:33,823 --> 00:42:35,663
- It was a good throw. - That was pretty cool.

1030
00:42:35,723 --> 00:42:37,453
(Everyone mimics He Zhong Xing.)

1031
00:42:37,723 --> 00:42:38,922
- He tossed it then. - Like this?

1032
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:40,763
- It has to be He Zhong Xing. - He Zhong Xing?

1033
00:42:41,923 --> 00:42:42,962
He Zhong Xing?

1034
00:42:42,963 --> 00:42:45,493
- It's He Zhong Xing. - He tossed it then.

1035
00:42:46,233 --> 00:42:50,133
(Possessed by He Zhong Xing)

1036
00:42:53,343 --> 00:42:54,473
This is fun.

1037
00:42:55,003 --> 00:42:56,103
Please.

1038
00:42:56,543 --> 00:42:58,073
I'll announce it right away.

1039
00:42:58,373 --> 00:43:00,383
The participant in 36th place is...

1040
00:43:01,143 --> 00:43:02,582
I don't know who it's going to be.

1041
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:04,463
(Which participant will survive in 36th place?)

1042
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:05,752
It's He Zhong Xing.

1043
00:43:05,753 --> 00:43:09,583
(He Zhong Xing survives in 36th place.)

1044
00:43:10,593 --> 00:43:11,993
How sexy!

1045
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,462
Sit down.

1046
00:43:13,463 --> 00:43:15,639
- Zhong Xing, happy birthday. - This is your birthday present.

1047
00:43:15,663 --> 00:43:16,832
Sexy!

1048
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:18,563
We need someone like him on the show.

1049
00:43:18,933 --> 00:43:20,462
(What kind of person is he?)

1050
00:43:20,463 --> 00:43:22,602
- Zhong Xing. - Zhong Xing.

1051
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:23,603
(Give me a hug.)

1052
00:43:24,633 --> 00:43:27,102
(Do you remember...)

1053
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:30,573
(the memories we shared together?)

1054
00:43:33,073 --> 00:43:34,143
Why not?

1055
00:43:34,743 --> 00:43:37,303
- Zhong Xing didn't give him a hug. - Zhong Xing didn't hug him.

1056
00:43:38,053 --> 00:43:39,893
- Why not? - Zhong Xing didn't give him a hug.

1057
00:43:41,283 --> 00:43:43,193
- He really won't do it. - No hugs.

1058
00:43:43,593 --> 00:43:46,323
Your survival on the show is the best birthday present.

1059
00:43:47,363 --> 00:43:48,363
Right.

1060
00:43:48,393 --> 00:43:49,539
(He Zhong Xing, 36th, 1,633,150 points)

1061
00:43:49,563 --> 00:43:51,333
So far, 2 participants from Team 1...

1062
00:43:51,433 --> 00:43:55,733
and 1 participant from Team 2 have officially survived.

1063
00:43:57,003 --> 00:43:59,073
As for the next survivor...

1064
00:44:00,903 --> 00:44:04,213
(Excluding the Top 8 and 47th place, only 8 spots remain.)

1065
00:44:04,313 --> 00:44:06,843
(A total of 13 participants wait for the announcement.)

1066
00:44:07,483 --> 00:44:10,152
Gosh, why isn't he saying anything? Please tell us already.

1067
00:44:10,153 --> 00:44:12,483
My gosh. This is so nerve-racking.

1068
00:44:13,383 --> 00:44:15,423
The next survivor is in 38th place.

1069
00:44:18,293 --> 00:44:19,353
In 38th place?

1070
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:23,022
- They're taking all the spots. - Right.

1071
00:44:23,023 --> 00:44:25,532
- Between them? - Gosh, their rankings were close.

1072
00:44:25,533 --> 00:44:27,693
- That row keeps getting full. - I can't make it then.

1073
00:44:27,903 --> 00:44:29,973
Please. Leave some spots for me.

1074
00:44:31,073 --> 00:44:33,943
- Xue Su Ren? - It has to be you.

1075
00:44:34,103 --> 00:44:35,643
The participant in 38th place...

1076
00:44:35,903 --> 00:44:38,073
picked dance as the position...

1077
00:44:38,573 --> 00:44:41,382
where he felt the strongest.

1078
00:44:41,383 --> 00:44:45,182
- Gosh, Xue Su Ren. - Xue Su Ren.

1079
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,313
Xue Su Ren!

1080
00:44:46,923 --> 00:44:48,183
- Xue Su Ren. - Is it him?

1081
00:44:48,653 --> 00:44:50,422
He used to be a dancer too.

1082
00:44:50,423 --> 00:44:51,852
Tatsuki probably chose dance too.

1083
00:44:51,853 --> 00:44:52,992
It must be Tatsuki.

1084
00:44:52,993 --> 00:44:54,313
- He was in 41st place. - Please.

1085
00:44:54,623 --> 00:44:55,693
Who is it?

1086
00:44:56,423 --> 00:44:59,032
Sho was confident about K-pop dance.

1087
00:44:59,033 --> 00:45:01,033
He was even more confident than Yumeki.

1088
00:45:02,003 --> 00:45:04,903
(During their practice for the Signal Song Test)

1089
00:45:05,533 --> 00:45:08,743
(Sho demonstrated brimming confidence about K-pop dance.)

1090
00:45:11,173 --> 00:45:12,613
Tatsuki is here.

1091
00:45:13,073 --> 00:45:15,213
This participant will join the rest of the survivors.

1092
00:45:16,753 --> 00:45:18,129
- It's Tatsuki or Xue Su Ren. - Xue Su Ren.

1093
00:45:18,153 --> 00:45:19,153
It's...

1094
00:45:19,853 --> 00:45:20,923
I think it's Tatsuki.

1095
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:25,652
It's Tatsuki.

1096
00:45:25,653 --> 00:45:27,322
(Tatsuki survives in 38th place.)

1097
00:45:27,323 --> 00:45:29,323
- I told you. - Well done.

1098
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:30,993
Great job.

1099
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:33,463
He went up by three places.

1100
00:45:33,763 --> 00:45:34,883
I told you he would make it.

1101
00:45:34,933 --> 00:45:35,933
- Gosh. - What a relief.

1102
00:45:35,934 --> 00:45:38,734
- Congratulations on your survival. - Congratulations, Tatsuki. Great.

1103
00:45:39,733 --> 00:45:41,742
This is getting interesting now.

1104
00:45:41,743 --> 00:45:43,343
I'll be going home. I'm serious.

1105
00:45:44,873 --> 00:45:46,072
I hope Xue Su Ren makes it.

1106
00:45:46,073 --> 00:45:48,183
- Make sure to survive, Hao. - I...

1107
00:45:51,413 --> 00:45:54,553
(Four survivors were announced from the group so far.)

1108
00:45:54,983 --> 00:45:58,122
In Team "KILL THE ROMEO," there are...

1109
00:45:58,123 --> 00:45:59,123
Star Yang.

1110
00:46:01,163 --> 00:46:02,222
There are no more survivors?

1111
00:46:02,223 --> 00:46:03,592
Judging by how he lowered his voice, there must be more.

1112
00:46:03,593 --> 00:46:06,193
There are more survivors.

1113
00:46:07,033 --> 00:46:08,203
Please.

1114
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:10,173
Heui Chan.

1115
00:46:11,003 --> 00:46:12,273
Let's go, Heui Chan.

1116
00:46:13,373 --> 00:46:15,903
- Xue Su Ren. - Let's go, Su Ren.

1117
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:19,713
This is the last survivor from Team "KILL THE ROMEO."

1118
00:46:20,313 --> 00:46:21,553
- The last survivor. - My gosh.

1119
00:46:21,983 --> 00:46:24,153
It might be either Heui Chan or Su Ren.

1120
00:46:24,413 --> 00:46:26,012
- It must be you. - Let's go.

1121
00:46:26,013 --> 00:46:30,393
The next participant came in 46th place.

1122
00:46:30,553 --> 00:46:32,633
- It's right there. - That's so close to 47th place.

1123
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,962
(Everyone is chattering nervously as it's right before the cut.)

1124
00:46:34,963 --> 00:46:36,493
That was super close.

1125
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:38,692
He's just scraping through.

1126
00:46:38,693 --> 00:46:41,033
- That's crazy. - In Hu.

1127
00:46:41,563 --> 00:46:43,403
- No, you'll be fine. - In Hu.

1128
00:46:43,703 --> 00:46:45,502
Please make it, Heui Chan.

1129
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:48,003
Personally, I want both guys from DKB to advance.

1130
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:50,143
Hang in there.

1131
00:46:51,413 --> 00:46:52,843
You might have a shot at this one.

1132
00:46:53,813 --> 00:46:56,752
Please, Star Yang. Please, Su Ren.

1133
00:46:56,753 --> 00:46:58,713
The participant in 46th place...

1134
00:46:58,813 --> 00:47:00,752
Getting placed in 46th place was just hanging by a thread.

1135
00:47:00,753 --> 00:47:02,423
Gosh, seriously. Who's in 46th place?

1136
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:06,662
It's Xue Su Ren.

1137
00:47:06,663 --> 00:47:10,333
(Xue Su Ren survives in 46th place.)

1138
00:47:11,463 --> 00:47:12,592
(Xue Su Ren, 46th place, 740,634 points)

1139
00:47:12,593 --> 00:47:14,433
- That's crazy. It went up a lot. - Don't cry.

1140
00:47:14,663 --> 00:47:15,733
Good for him.

1141
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:17,872
I do envy him.

1142
00:47:17,873 --> 00:47:20,242
- Good luck, Xue Su Ren. Let's go! - Good luck.

1143
00:47:20,243 --> 00:47:21,272
Why are you crying?

1144
00:47:21,273 --> 00:47:22,743
Great job, Su Ren.

1145
00:47:23,343 --> 00:47:24,842
(1st round voting score: 104,66 points)

1146
00:47:24,843 --> 00:47:26,342
(2nd round global vote count: 320,804 points)

1147
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,883
Don't cry, baby.

1148
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:30,382
His soulmate, Li Zi Hao,

1149
00:47:30,383 --> 00:47:31,913
- Give me a hug. - is over the moon.

1150
00:47:32,653 --> 00:47:34,153
Congratulations on your survival.

1151
00:47:40,263 --> 00:47:41,263
(Kissing)

1152
00:47:42,523 --> 00:47:44,992
- Gosh, that's too much. - They can never break up.

1153
00:47:44,993 --> 00:47:46,392
(Covering his mouth)

1154
00:47:46,393 --> 00:47:47,802
What's wrong with him?

1155
00:47:47,803 --> 00:47:49,733
- Was that on the lips? - I don't know.

1156
00:47:50,803 --> 00:47:51,972
That's intense.

1157
00:47:51,973 --> 00:47:54,673
- I don't think this can air on TV. - Wait.

1158
00:47:55,443 --> 00:47:57,573
(Sighing)

1159
00:48:00,013 --> 00:48:04,253
Li Zi Hao. Could you say a word to Yang Heui Chan...

1160
00:48:04,453 --> 00:48:07,953
who must wait for more announcements later?

1161
00:48:09,923 --> 00:48:12,322
(Yang Heui Chan and Li Zi Hao formed a friendship...)

1162
00:48:12,323 --> 00:48:14,723
(after performing together as a team.)

1163
00:48:17,133 --> 00:48:22,533
Thank you for everything, Heui Chan.

1164
00:48:24,733 --> 00:48:27,203
- Is he saying goodbye? - What was that?

1165
00:48:27,303 --> 00:48:30,072
Actually, he can survive if he gets placed in 47th place.

1166
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,143
What did you say?

1167
00:48:31,473 --> 00:48:34,983
No. He still has a shot at surviving in 47th place.

1168
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:37,513
He can still survive.

1169
00:48:37,683 --> 00:48:42,722
I see. I'm sorry, Heui Chan.

1170
00:48:42,723 --> 00:48:43,723
It's okay.

1171
00:48:45,793 --> 00:48:47,192
He practically pushed Heui Chan out.

1172
00:48:47,193 --> 00:48:48,793
He's not eliminated yet.

1173
00:48:49,523 --> 00:48:51,192
He really is something else.

1174
00:48:51,193 --> 00:48:53,432
(I still love you, Hao.)

1175
00:48:53,433 --> 00:48:56,833
Those of you who survived, congratulations once again.

1176
00:48:58,533 --> 00:48:59,733
That row is completely full.

1177
00:49:04,513 --> 00:49:07,713
Forty-eight survivors feel fewer than I expected.

1178
00:49:08,413 --> 00:49:10,353
There's only one survivor from All Stars.

1179
00:49:12,113 --> 00:49:14,553
Here's the next team for the announcements.

1180
00:49:14,653 --> 00:49:16,453
I'm getting a feeling it's Team "Plot Twist."

1181
00:49:16,723 --> 00:49:18,893
Team "S-Class?" Team "Plot Twist?"

1182
00:49:18,993 --> 00:49:21,863
- Or it could be Team "Whiplash." - Team "Whiplash."

1183
00:49:24,233 --> 00:49:25,863
(Teasing them with the suspense)

1184
00:49:26,033 --> 00:49:28,162
(Tell us already. We're feeling dizzy.)

1185
00:49:28,163 --> 00:49:29,703
- Please. - All right.

1186
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:31,232
(Slowing down on his own)

1187
00:49:31,233 --> 00:49:33,173
- My heart is aching. - Please.

1188
00:49:33,643 --> 00:49:36,203
Tell us. Please?

1189
00:49:36,603 --> 00:49:37,642
It's "S-Class."

1190
00:49:37,643 --> 00:49:39,913
(The next announcements are for Team "S-Class.")

1191
00:49:44,683 --> 00:49:47,653
("S-Class" by Stray Kids)

1192
00:49:47,883 --> 00:49:50,752
(Song Min Jae's charisma stood out in Team 2.)

1193
00:49:50,753 --> 00:49:54,423
(Team 1 showed the class of Team All Stars.)

1194
00:49:54,523 --> 00:49:55,899
(Team 1 won with the total points of 1,256.)

1195
00:49:55,923 --> 00:49:59,463
(Team 1 won 100,000 points as the benefit.)

1196
00:49:59,733 --> 00:50:01,303
A lot of them will be up here.

1197
00:50:01,933 --> 00:50:03,903
So many people will survive from Team One.

1198
00:50:04,573 --> 00:50:06,293
I think most of the All Stars will survive.

1199
00:50:06,373 --> 00:50:07,503
The All Star Avengers.

1200
00:50:07,903 --> 00:50:10,612
My gosh, Team "S-Class" has so many strong participants.

1201
00:50:10,613 --> 00:50:11,819
(Many high-ranking participants are in Team "S-Class.")

1202
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:13,112
We can pretty much assume...

1203
00:50:13,113 --> 00:50:14,382
the eight All Stars will take the spots.

1204
00:50:14,383 --> 00:50:15,383
Right.

1205
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,952
The surviving participant with the highest ranking...

1206
00:50:17,953 --> 00:50:19,913
in Team "S-Class" is...

1207
00:50:20,013 --> 00:50:21,693
- It must be quite high. - I think so too.

1208
00:50:21,753 --> 00:50:22,753
Twelfth?

1209
00:50:23,593 --> 00:50:25,422
It's 18th place.

1210
00:50:25,423 --> 00:50:26,553
- Really? - What?

1211
00:50:27,263 --> 00:50:28,893
What? Why is it so low?

1212
00:50:28,993 --> 00:50:30,492
Well, 8th, 9th, and 10th places...

1213
00:50:30,493 --> 00:50:32,133
- will be revealed later. - Their team...

1214
00:50:32,533 --> 00:50:34,003
But except for Kang Min...

1215
00:50:34,763 --> 00:50:36,162
- In the Top Eight, - Still.

1216
00:50:36,163 --> 00:50:38,132
- still... - Still, I mean,

1217
00:50:38,133 --> 00:50:39,803
he should be close to tenth place.

1218
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:42,003
The participant in 18th place.

1219
00:50:43,003 --> 00:50:44,443
Since the first episode,

1220
00:50:44,773 --> 00:50:47,713
has this person's name been in the top ten?

1221
00:50:50,983 --> 00:50:52,053
It has.

1222
00:50:52,313 --> 00:50:53,413
In the top ten?

1223
00:50:54,223 --> 00:50:55,303
- Who is it? - The top ten?

1224
00:50:55,783 --> 00:50:56,783
Zhang Jia Hao?

1225
00:50:57,193 --> 00:50:58,622
Zhang Jia Hao, Chen Kai Wen.

1226
00:50:58,623 --> 00:50:59,853
- One of those two. - Right?

1227
00:51:02,163 --> 00:51:03,163
(6th place Chen Kai Wen, 8th place Zhang Jia Hao)

1228
00:51:03,164 --> 00:51:05,609
(The 2 participants were in 6th and 8th place in the 2nd episode.)

1229
00:51:05,633 --> 00:51:07,003
- Kai Wen. - Kai Wen.

1230
00:51:08,033 --> 00:51:09,532
- Hao? - Yes, Hao...

1231
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:10,533
I think so.

1232
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:11,832
The participant in 18th place is...

1233
00:51:11,833 --> 00:51:16,603
(Who will take 18th place?)

1234
00:51:18,013 --> 00:51:20,342
It's Zhang Jia Hao.

1235
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:22,383
(In 18th place, survivor Zhang Jia Hao from Team 1)

1236
00:51:22,483 --> 00:51:23,713
Nice!

1237
00:51:24,013 --> 00:51:25,353
- Good job. - Hao.

1238
00:51:28,653 --> 00:51:31,793
Participant Zhang Jia Hao, during the Class Placement Match...

1239
00:51:32,193 --> 00:51:33,452
(During the Class Placement Match for PLANET C, )

1240
00:51:33,453 --> 00:51:36,493
(Zhang Jia Hao performed with Zhou An Xin.)

1241
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,792
You showed us a good performance.

1242
00:51:38,793 --> 00:51:40,563
This is how you dance to K-pop.

1243
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:43,263
He received high praise from Master Back Koo Young,

1244
00:51:43,403 --> 00:51:45,803
and he proved his presence during the "S-Class" performance.

1245
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:47,903
Congratulations on your survival.

1246
00:51:48,743 --> 00:51:49,743
Let's go.

1247
00:51:50,413 --> 00:51:51,513
He's so handsome.

1248
00:51:51,813 --> 00:51:53,373
(Agreed)

1249
00:51:53,473 --> 00:51:54,513
He looks dashing.

1250
00:51:55,643 --> 00:51:57,383
The next participant to survive...

1251
00:51:57,583 --> 00:52:00,153
will be in 20th place.

1252
00:52:00,653 --> 00:52:01,753
Kai Wen? Hu Han Wen?

1253
00:52:02,183 --> 00:52:03,993
The person in 20th place...

1254
00:52:06,023 --> 00:52:07,093
is on Team One.

1255
00:52:08,363 --> 00:52:09,863
It could be Jun Min.

1256
00:52:09,923 --> 00:52:11,093
I think it's Jun Min.

1257
00:52:11,863 --> 00:52:13,762
He did so well on the killing part.

1258
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:14,803
That's true.

1259
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:21,102
(Kim Jun Min was in the spotlight for his amazing killing part.)

1260
00:52:21,103 --> 00:52:22,702
(They chose the killing part so well. He grabs my attention.)

1261
00:52:22,703 --> 00:52:24,872
(Jun Min seems like a Stray Kids member joining as a special guest.)

1262
00:52:24,873 --> 00:52:25,912
(Kim Jun Min has legendary vocal projection.)

1263
00:52:25,913 --> 00:52:27,259
(Kim Jun Min stands out above the rest.)

1264
00:52:27,283 --> 00:52:28,512
Gosh, is Jun Min in 20th place?

1265
00:52:28,513 --> 00:52:29,682
(Is Jun Min in 20th place?)

1266
00:52:29,683 --> 00:52:31,053
Jun Min's rank went up a lot.

1267
00:52:32,013 --> 00:52:33,823
The survivor in 20th place is...

1268
00:52:34,323 --> 00:52:35,623
- Jun Min? - Jun Min.

1269
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:37,523
Kim Jun Min.

1270
00:52:39,293 --> 00:52:40,792
Seo Won.

1271
00:52:40,793 --> 00:52:44,692
(In 20th place, survivor Seo Won from Team 1)

1272
00:52:44,693 --> 00:52:46,063
- Good job. - That's great.

1273
00:52:47,363 --> 00:52:48,683
Jun Min must be in the top eight.

1274
00:52:50,603 --> 00:52:51,603
I think so.

1275
00:52:52,633 --> 00:52:54,042
Seo Won's rank is really high.

1276
00:52:54,043 --> 00:52:55,403
(Seo Won, 20th, 2,773,500 points)

1277
00:52:55,903 --> 00:52:57,543
They have too many All Star members.

1278
00:52:57,713 --> 00:52:59,143
I think there will be one more.

1279
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:00,643
Next,

1280
00:53:01,213 --> 00:53:04,513
I will announce the participant in 21st place.

1281
00:53:05,013 --> 00:53:06,383
Is it the 21st right away?

1282
00:53:07,683 --> 00:53:09,083
They're all in there together.

1283
00:53:09,623 --> 00:53:11,853
The people ranked in the 20s must all be on that team.

1284
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:14,263
Will this actually be Jun Min?

1285
00:53:14,423 --> 00:53:15,463
Jun Min?

1286
00:53:16,323 --> 00:53:18,063
The participant in 21st place.

1287
00:53:18,493 --> 00:53:19,563
This person's name...

1288
00:53:21,503 --> 00:53:23,203
has a number in it.

1289
00:53:23,303 --> 00:53:25,233
Kim Jun Min. Park Dong Gyu.

1290
00:53:26,003 --> 00:53:27,003
Kim Si Hwan.

1291
00:53:27,773 --> 00:53:29,343
Jo Gye Hyeon. Kim In Hu.

1292
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,213
What number?

1293
00:53:32,143 --> 00:53:33,572
There's Wen. It sounds like One.

1294
00:53:33,573 --> 00:53:35,482
(Candidate 1: Chen Kai Wen, One)

1295
00:53:35,483 --> 00:53:36,543
Oh, it's one.

1296
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:38,183
Chen Kai "One."

1297
00:53:38,653 --> 00:53:39,853
Who else is there?

1298
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:42,552
- Hu Han Wen. - Oh, there's Hu Han Wen.

1299
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,953
(Candidate 2: Hu Han Wen, One)

1300
00:53:46,093 --> 00:53:47,323
Oh, Zhao Guang Xu.

1301
00:53:47,423 --> 00:53:48,522
I know. There are three of them.

1302
00:53:48,523 --> 00:53:49,763
(Candidate 3: Zhao Guang Xu, 5)

1303
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,563
The survivor in 21st place.

1304
00:53:51,993 --> 00:53:53,063
The participant is...

1305
00:53:54,163 --> 00:53:55,533
It could be Hu Han Wen.

1306
00:53:56,063 --> 00:53:57,732
(18th, Chen Kai Wen, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

1307
00:53:57,733 --> 00:53:59,633
It's Chen Kai Wen.

1308
00:54:06,113 --> 00:54:07,143
That's awesome.

1309
00:54:07,943 --> 00:54:09,713
Gosh, I was in 21st place.

1310
00:54:11,613 --> 00:54:13,253
- Good job. - Hao.

1311
00:54:14,283 --> 00:54:16,153
I finally got up to All Star.

1312
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:18,653
He finally went to All Star.

1313
00:54:19,353 --> 00:54:21,693
Getting 21st place without benefits is really high.

1314
00:54:22,363 --> 00:54:24,033
So many from PLANET C have gone up.

1315
00:54:24,833 --> 00:54:26,893
The next participant to survive...

1316
00:54:27,133 --> 00:54:28,532
is in 25th place.

1317
00:54:28,533 --> 00:54:29,902
(Survivor, 25th place)

1318
00:54:29,903 --> 00:54:31,103
It went down to Two Star.

1319
00:54:31,403 --> 00:54:32,473
You're right.

1320
00:54:32,873 --> 00:54:34,243
Gosh, Jun Min is going down?

1321
00:54:34,773 --> 00:54:36,303
I voted for Jun Min every day.

1322
00:54:37,513 --> 00:54:38,513
What about you?

1323
00:54:41,183 --> 00:54:42,483
The participant in 25th place.

1324
00:54:42,683 --> 00:54:45,213
His practice throughout the 1-on-1 Class Battle...

1325
00:54:45,753 --> 00:54:47,723
was full of many struggles.

1326
00:54:48,323 --> 00:54:49,352
(His hand goes up.)

1327
00:54:49,353 --> 00:54:50,453
Han Wen.

1328
00:54:52,953 --> 00:54:54,792
It could be In Hu.

1329
00:54:54,793 --> 00:54:56,023
In Hu had a tough time too.

1330
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:57,732
(During "S-Class" Team 1's practice)

1331
00:54:57,733 --> 00:54:59,332
(Worst participant: Kim In Hu, Reason: Couldn't see him very well)

1332
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:01,373
(Kim In Hu got harsh criticism in the peer review.)

1333
00:55:01,863 --> 00:55:03,779
(Worst participant: Kim In Hu, Reason: I'm not sure what he did.)

1334
00:55:03,803 --> 00:55:07,002
(Many participants chose him as the worst participant.)

1335
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:09,363
(Kim In Hu struggled a lot throughout the practice period.)

1336
00:55:09,503 --> 00:55:11,073
(Meanwhile, on Team 2...)

1337
00:55:13,713 --> 00:55:21,423
(Hu Han Wen received harsh training.)

1338
00:55:22,153 --> 00:55:23,483
It was more than tough.

1339
00:55:24,793 --> 00:55:26,493
The survivor in 25th place.

1340
00:55:26,693 --> 00:55:27,763
I'm certain it's In Hu.

1341
00:55:28,063 --> 00:55:29,422
Seriously. It's definitely In Hu.

1342
00:55:29,423 --> 00:55:30,423
Han Wen?

1343
00:55:30,424 --> 00:55:32,104
(26th, Hu Han Wen, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

1344
00:55:32,493 --> 00:55:33,632
It's Hu Han Wen.

1345
00:55:33,633 --> 00:55:37,603
(25th place survivor, Hu Han Wen from Team 2)

1346
00:55:40,743 --> 00:55:45,273
(Hu Han Wen runs into leader Song Min Jae's arms right away.)

1347
00:55:46,413 --> 00:55:48,212
Don't clap.

1348
00:55:48,213 --> 00:55:50,012
- I won't clap. - It'll trigger my PTSD.

1349
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,113
I won't clap.

1350
00:55:52,153 --> 00:55:54,852
As participant Hu Han Wen got ready for the performance of "S-Class,"

1351
00:55:54,853 --> 00:55:56,653
he went through so much heartache.

1352
00:55:57,023 --> 00:55:59,693
But he demonstrated his passion of never giving up...

1353
00:56:00,153 --> 00:56:01,693
and was cheered on by everyone.

1354
00:56:02,223 --> 00:56:04,093
No, you can't cry now.

1355
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:08,963
If I didn't have you guys,

1356
00:56:09,063 --> 00:56:12,573
I wouldn't be here now.

1357
00:56:13,133 --> 00:56:15,103
I feel all of your support,

1358
00:56:15,603 --> 00:56:17,943
and I will work even harder from now on.

1359
00:56:22,113 --> 00:56:23,883
Please move to your seat.

1360
00:56:25,013 --> 00:56:26,152
Good job.

1361
00:56:26,153 --> 00:56:27,452
Oh, the view is nice.

1362
00:56:27,453 --> 00:56:28,652
(Currently, three spots in the All Star zone have been filled...)

1363
00:56:28,653 --> 00:56:29,999
(with members from the "S-Class" teams.)

1364
00:56:30,023 --> 00:56:31,583
There are so many people from PLANET C.

1365
00:56:32,253 --> 00:56:34,263
The next survivor is...

1366
00:56:34,493 --> 00:56:36,063
in 27th place.

1367
00:56:36,963 --> 00:56:38,063
Dong Gyu, let's go.

1368
00:56:38,293 --> 00:56:40,362
I think it'll be Dong Gyu or Jun Min.

1369
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:41,363
(30th, Park Dong Gyu, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

1370
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:43,303
The participant in 27th place.

1371
00:56:43,703 --> 00:56:45,672
Whenever he goes on stage,

1372
00:56:45,673 --> 00:56:49,203
this participant's charisma explodes.

1373
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,113
That sounds like Jun Min.

1374
00:56:51,773 --> 00:56:53,143
There's Dong Gyu too.

1375
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:58,052
(The two participants showed off their charisma...)

1376
00:56:58,053 --> 00:57:00,653
(during the "S-Class" Team 1 performance.)

1377
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:04,653
The participant to take the honor of 27th place is...

1378
00:57:04,893 --> 00:57:05,893
Isn't it Jun Min?

1379
00:57:06,693 --> 00:57:07,723
Dong Gyu.

1380
00:57:12,693 --> 00:57:13,762
It's Kim Jun Min.

1381
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,832
(In 27th place, survivor Kim Jun Min from Team 1)

1382
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:19,133
Jun Min, you went up so much.

1383
00:57:20,073 --> 00:57:21,203
Congratulations, Jun Min.

1384
00:57:21,443 --> 00:57:23,102
Congratulations on your survival.

1385
00:57:23,103 --> 00:57:27,483
(Kim Jun Min, 27th, 2,119,619 points)

1386
00:57:28,113 --> 00:57:29,783
Jun Min is Two Star?

1387
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:32,313
That makes no sense. He had the killing part.

1388
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,382
(During the announcement for 20th place, )

1389
00:57:35,383 --> 00:57:37,352
(the participants expected Kim Jun Min's rank to be higher.)

1390
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:39,453
(During the announcement for 25th place)

1391
00:57:39,753 --> 00:57:41,369
Is Jun Min a candidate for the top eight?

1392
00:57:41,393 --> 00:57:44,293
(He was even mentioned as a candidate for the Top 8.)

1393
00:57:44,693 --> 00:57:47,303
Gosh, why is it such a shame that he went down to Two Star?

1394
00:57:48,103 --> 00:57:50,202
I have another chance now.

1395
00:57:50,203 --> 00:57:51,672
I'll always be humble and work hard...

1396
00:57:51,673 --> 00:57:54,102
so I can give more impressive performances.

1397
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:55,173
Thank you.

1398
00:57:57,143 --> 00:57:59,773
Right. The next participant to survive...

1399
00:58:00,213 --> 00:58:01,883
is in 29th place.

1400
00:58:02,283 --> 00:58:04,203
There are several people ranked in the 20s here.

1401
00:58:04,413 --> 00:58:05,583
There are several in the 20s.

1402
00:58:06,253 --> 00:58:08,153
They have so many people ranked in the 20s.

1403
00:58:08,653 --> 00:58:10,183
The participant in 29th place.

1404
00:58:10,423 --> 00:58:12,723
Among the vocalists and rappers,

1405
00:58:13,423 --> 00:58:14,663
this person is a rapper.

1406
00:58:14,993 --> 00:58:16,123
Dong Gyu, Si Hwan?

1407
00:58:18,033 --> 00:58:22,663
(Kim Si Hwan and Park Dong Gyu did a great job as rappers on Team 1.)

1408
00:58:22,763 --> 00:58:25,203
And during the first Class Placement Match,

1409
00:58:25,703 --> 00:58:28,573
he performed in a group of four.

1410
00:58:30,913 --> 00:58:32,773
- Oh, IST. - Oh, it's IST.

1411
00:58:34,213 --> 00:58:37,182
(Kim Si Hwan and Park Dong Gyu performed as a group of 4...)

1412
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:40,113
(during the 1st Class Placement Match.)

1413
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:41,853
- Then, it's 1 of these 2. - I know.

1414
00:58:42,053 --> 00:58:43,453
Oh, it's Dong Gyu.

1415
00:58:43,783 --> 00:58:45,093
You know it's Dong Gyu.

1416
00:58:45,223 --> 00:58:46,293
It's Dong Gyu.

1417
00:58:46,693 --> 00:58:47,763
I guess it's Dong Gyu.

1418
00:58:48,563 --> 00:58:50,483
(The younger members of IST are so cool-headed.)

1419
00:58:50,523 --> 00:58:51,592
It's Park Dong Gyu.

1420
00:58:51,593 --> 00:58:55,462
(In 29th place, survivor Park Dong Gyu from Team 1)

1421
00:58:55,463 --> 00:58:57,102
- I'm so proud of you. - Good job.

1422
00:58:57,103 --> 00:58:58,633
He did a great job.

1423
00:58:58,733 --> 00:59:00,702
Participant Park Dong Gyu grabbed our attention...

1424
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,672
- with his spirited performances. - Spirit.

1425
00:59:02,673 --> 00:59:04,672
(Park Dong Gyu emphasized spirit a lot during the class placement.)

1426
00:59:04,673 --> 00:59:07,642
(Drilling in the message of spirit on the younger members)

1427
00:59:07,643 --> 00:59:08,813
All Star.

1428
00:59:08,983 --> 00:59:11,583
(Park Dong Gyu led everyone from IST to All Star.)

1429
00:59:11,713 --> 00:59:13,953
He showed the potential as an all-rounder.

1430
00:59:14,383 --> 00:59:15,752
Congratulations on your survival.

1431
00:59:15,753 --> 00:59:18,293
(Park Dong Gyu, 29th, 1,952,689 points)

1432
00:59:18,793 --> 00:59:20,693
Dong Gyu's rank still went up.

1433
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:24,232
The next survivor who will get to continue...

1434
00:59:24,233 --> 00:59:25,493
onto the next mission is...

1435
00:59:26,293 --> 00:59:28,203
in 34th place.

1436
00:59:32,033 --> 00:59:34,503
- Didn't the rank suddenly drop? - I know.

1437
00:59:35,973 --> 00:59:37,512
Gosh, it can't go down so much all of a sudden.

1438
00:59:37,513 --> 00:59:39,349
(The survival rank suddenly dropped down to the mid 30s.)

1439
00:59:39,373 --> 00:59:40,783
Gye Hyeon went up a lot.

1440
00:59:41,843 --> 00:59:43,682
You can't be so sure about that.

1441
00:59:43,683 --> 00:59:45,683
I think it'll be Gye Hyeon. Anyone would think so.

1442
00:59:45,983 --> 00:59:47,013
In Hu.

1443
00:59:47,953 --> 00:59:48,953
Let's go.

1444
00:59:48,954 --> 00:59:50,459
(58th, Song Min Jae, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

1445
00:59:50,483 --> 00:59:52,152
The participant in 38th place.

1446
00:59:52,153 --> 00:59:54,793
Was this person the leader or the killing part on the team?

1447
00:59:56,163 --> 00:59:57,793
- He was. - He was not.

1448
00:59:59,233 --> 01:00:00,979
This person wasn't either one of those positions?

1449
01:00:01,003 --> 01:00:02,763
He was both the leader and the killing part.

1450
01:00:03,103 --> 01:00:04,203
It could be In Hu.

1451
01:00:04,973 --> 01:00:07,233
Either In Hu or Si Hwan.

1452
01:00:08,443 --> 01:00:09,543
That person is...

1453
01:00:10,043 --> 01:00:11,842
(46th, Kim Si Hwan, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

1454
01:00:11,843 --> 01:00:13,643
(54th, Kim In Hu, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

1455
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:14,942
It's Zhao Guang Xu.

1456
01:00:14,943 --> 01:00:16,782
(In 34h place, survivor Zhao Guang Xu from Team 2)

1457
01:00:16,783 --> 01:00:17,883
Nice.

1458
01:00:20,653 --> 01:00:22,053
- Yes. - Zhao Guang Xu.

1459
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:26,592
Zhao Guang Xu, with his never-give-up attitude and tenacity,

1460
01:00:26,593 --> 01:00:28,692
continuously made up for the parts he was lacking in...

1461
01:00:28,693 --> 01:00:30,793
and proved that he had grown.

1462
01:00:32,393 --> 01:00:36,033
(Zhao Guang Xu, 34th place, 1,735,494 points)

1463
01:00:36,463 --> 01:00:38,063
Please move to the seat of your ranking.

1464
01:00:40,733 --> 01:00:43,373
It doesn't make sense that Jun Min and Dong Gyu are Two Stars.

1465
01:00:44,213 --> 01:00:46,513
Being a Two Star really doesn't suit Jun Min.

1466
01:00:47,213 --> 01:00:50,143
(The 48 survivor seats are slowly filling up.)

1467
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,883
The rank of this survivor...

1468
01:00:54,583 --> 01:00:55,722
is 40th.

1469
01:00:55,723 --> 01:00:57,163
(The rank of this survivor is 40th.)

1470
01:00:57,383 --> 01:00:58,743
It goes down like this right away?

1471
01:00:59,553 --> 01:01:01,193
Gye Hyeon must survive too.

1472
01:01:02,163 --> 01:01:03,663
The participant in 40th...

1473
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:05,639
was in the main rapper and main vocalist position...

1474
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:10,463
during the 1-on-1 Class Battle.

1475
01:01:11,033 --> 01:01:12,303
Isn't it Gye Hyeon?

1476
01:01:13,103 --> 01:01:14,543
The main rapper is Si Hwan.

1477
01:01:14,673 --> 01:01:16,643
- Si Hwan. - The main vocalist is Gye Hyeon.

1478
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:18,513
It's Gye Hyeon or Si Hwan.

1479
01:01:19,273 --> 01:01:22,212
(Jo Gye Hyeon was the main vocalist of Team 1.)

1480

(Kim Si Hwan was the main rapper of Team 1.)

1481

(40th, Jo Gye Hyeon, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

1485

Kim Si Hwan.

1486
01:01:38,333 --> 01:01:40,333
It's Jo Gye Hyeon.

1487

(Jo Gye Hyeon survives in 40th place.)

1488

will there be any more names...

- From "S-Class." - Please!

1500

(Survivor, 43rd)

1507
01:02:33,813 --> 01:02:34,922
This must be the last chance.

1508
01:02:34,923 --> 01:02:36,763
(It's a risky position in survival with 43rd.)

1509

The participant in 43rd...

1510
01:02:38,623 --> 01:02:41,093
went up in ranks by a great margin...

1511
01:02:41,223 --> 01:02:43,793
after the 1-on-1 Class Battle was revealed.

1512
01:02:44,563 --> 01:02:45,763
It's In Hu.

1513
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,032
(He did go through a lot of difficulties...)

1514
01:02:49,033 --> 01:02:51,273
(during the 1-on-1Class Battle, )

1515

(but Kim In Hu showed a lot of development...)

(through the successful performance.)

1517
01:02:53,773 --> 01:02:55,143
Will In Hu survive?

1518
01:02:55,203 --> 01:02:56,603
Let's go, In Hu! Please!

1519
01:02:57,203 --> 01:02:59,073

is...

1524
01:03:14,253 --> 01:03:16,862
2005.

(Born in 2005)

There's only 45th place left now.

1590
01:06:33,653 --> 01:06:35,823
(There's only 45th place left excluding 47th place.)

1591
01:06:36,193 --> 01:06:37,693
Go through, Min Jae.

1592
01:06:38,793 --> 01:06:41,163
The next survivor of "S-Class..."

1593
01:06:41,633 --> 01:06:44,103
(58th, Song Min Jae, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

1594
01:06:46,833 --> 01:06:47,973
"Is non-existent."

1595
01:06:48,043 --> 01:06:49,143
is non-existent.

1596
01:06:53,043 --> 01:06:56,483
(The survivor announcement of "S-Class" is over.)

1597
01:07:07,693 --> 01:07:09,623
The ones that haven't been called yet...

1598
01:07:09,963 --> 01:07:12,762
can still survive in 47th place.

1599
01:07:12,763 --> 01:07:14,269
(Will Song Min Jae be able to survive by placing 47th?)

1600
01:07:14,293 --> 01:07:17,903
Now, the teams of "Plot Twist..."

1601
01:07:18,333 --> 01:07:19,472
(Sighing)

1602
01:07:19,473 --> 01:07:20,632
We know.

1603
01:07:20,633 --> 01:07:23,443
And "Whiplash" are the only teams left to be announced.

1604
01:07:25,013 --> 01:07:26,673
But before that,

1605
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:28,912
I've been told that...

1606
01:07:28,913 --> 01:07:31,653
the battle of the century happened.

1607
01:07:31,783 --> 01:07:33,753
We'll be witnessing that first before we return.

1608
01:07:33,913 --> 01:07:35,923
- Battle? - Let us find out...

1609
01:07:36,153 --> 01:07:38,193
what kind of battle it was right now.

1610
01:07:40,123 --> 01:07:41,893
(1st Survivor Announcement)

1611
01:07:42,793 --> 01:07:44,463
Let's go!

1612
01:07:44,893 --> 01:07:46,493
Again?

1613
01:07:47,193 --> 01:07:48,702
There's another surprise.

1614
01:07:48,703 --> 01:07:50,633
- Again! - What is it?

1615
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:52,773
What is it?

1616
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:54,873
There's another cover.

1617
01:07:57,703 --> 01:08:02,043
(PLANET C made a surprise appearance behind the cover in Episode 3.)

1618
01:08:02,543 --> 01:08:04,612
There's a surprise. The cover will drop down again.

1619
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:06,359
I don't have a clue about what it could be this time.

1620
01:08:06,383 --> 01:08:08,082
I'm curious about what kind of surprise it could be.

1621
01:08:08,083 --> 01:08:09,053
(The cover attracts everyone's expectation and attention.)

1622
01:08:09,054 --> 01:08:10,423
What could be behind that?

1623
01:08:11,123 --> 01:08:12,153
What?

1624
01:08:15,563 --> 01:08:17,062
(The cover wasn't needed.)

1625
01:08:17,063 --> 01:08:18,833
(A man confidently enters through the door.)

1626
01:08:24,263 --> 01:08:26,433
(Special Idol Master, Park Gun Wook, ZEROBASEONE)

1627
01:08:28,273 --> 01:08:30,042
(Through "BOYS PLANET Season One,")

1628
01:08:30,043 --> 01:08:32,723
(Park Gun Wook achieved his dream of making his ZEROBASEONE debut.)

1629
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,482
I was a participant in "BOYS PLANET..."

1630
01:08:35,483 --> 01:08:36,942
and I have returned as a Special Idol Master...

1631
01:08:36,943 --> 01:08:38,453
of BOYS II PLANET.

1632
01:08:38,483 --> 01:08:40,923
I'm Park Gun Wook of ZEROBASEONE. It's great to meet you all.

1633
01:08:42,923 --> 01:08:44,793
- This is crazy. Hello. - Hello.

1634
01:08:44,923 --> 01:08:46,223
He's so good-looking.

1635
01:08:46,693 --> 01:08:48,423
I am here...

1636
01:08:48,693 --> 01:08:51,933
- to give you all a sudden mission. - What?

1637
01:08:52,263 --> 01:08:53,293
Mission?

1638
01:08:53,733 --> 01:08:54,733
It's...

1639
01:08:56,963 --> 01:08:58,502
the Class Competition.

1640
01:08:58,503 --> 01:09:00,373
(The sudden mission is the Class Competition.)

1641
01:09:01,773 --> 01:09:03,542
One Stars against the Two Stars against the Three Stars?

1642
01:09:03,543 --> 01:09:04,942
- All Stars? - I feel relieved.

1643
01:09:04,943 --> 01:09:06,412
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1644
01:09:06,413 --> 01:09:07,813
Let's go, All Star!

1645
01:09:08,183 --> 01:09:10,583
Before I tell you about the sudden mission...

1646
01:09:10,643 --> 01:09:11,883
What is this about?

1647
01:09:12,153 --> 01:09:13,182
The benefit.

1648
01:09:13,183 --> 01:09:14,313
The benefit!

1649
01:09:14,883 --> 01:09:15,883
Please come out.

1650
01:09:17,023 --> 01:09:18,663
- "Please come out?" - "Please come out?"

1651
01:09:18,923 --> 01:09:21,363
(What is the benefit of the sudden mission?)

1652
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:29,103
(Making a grand appearance)

1653
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:32,173
- Fried chicken! - Yes. The benefit...

1654
01:09:32,433 --> 01:09:34,302
is 100 boxes of fried chicken.

1655
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:35,863
(A total of 100 boxes of fried chicken)

1656
01:09:36,173 --> 01:09:38,113
- There are 100 boxes? - There are 100 boxes?

1657
01:09:38,373 --> 01:09:40,243
It's fried chicken!

1658
01:09:41,683 --> 01:09:44,212
What will be the Class Competition...

1659
01:09:44,213 --> 01:09:46,553
with 100 boxes of fried chicken on the line?

1660
01:09:48,683 --> 01:09:49,753
It will now be revealed!

1661
01:09:50,383 --> 01:09:52,653
(It's about to get released with flashy lights!)

1662
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:55,763
Since it's for fried chicken, could it be Chicken Fight?

1663
01:09:59,833 --> 01:10:02,663
(The Class Competition mission finally gets revealed!)

1664
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:04,803
Is it really about dancing?

1665
01:10:05,573 --> 01:10:08,672
It's Planet Boy Fighter!

1666
01:10:08,673 --> 01:10:10,513
(Dance Battle of the boys, Planet Boy Fighter)

1667
01:10:11,613 --> 01:10:13,773
You can beat me down with one blow.

1668
01:10:14,573 --> 01:10:15,743
Bring it on!

1669
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:18,483
As it's a Class Competition,

1670
01:10:18,553 --> 01:10:21,483
there must be a captain for each class, right?

1671
01:10:24,383 --> 01:10:26,293
The father of BOYS II PLANET,

1672
01:10:26,653 --> 01:10:28,093
Back Koo Young!

1673
01:10:28,293 --> 01:10:30,093
The master of dancing,

1674
01:10:30,363 --> 01:10:31,463
KINKY!

1675
01:10:31,563 --> 01:10:32,843
(Two Star Captain, Master KINKY)

1676
01:10:32,893 --> 01:10:34,033
One Star Captain,

1677
01:10:34,493 --> 01:10:36,803
the energizer, it's Kany.

1678
01:10:37,903 --> 01:10:39,833
(One Star's clap to get the drop on)

1679
01:10:40,573 --> 01:10:43,103
(Revealing the captains of the different classes complete.)

1680
01:10:43,743 --> 01:10:46,273
- This is really crazy. - This is crazy.

1681
01:10:46,343 --> 01:10:48,703
- This is awesome. What should I do? - It's great, brother.

1682
01:10:48,783 --> 01:10:50,743
It's getting heated up already.

1683
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,753
But this is not the end.

1684
01:10:53,213 --> 01:10:55,252
There are special judges awaiting...

1685
01:10:55,253 --> 01:10:57,683
to judge your dance battles.

1686
01:10:58,193 --> 01:10:59,552
Let me introduce them right away.

1687
01:10:59,553 --> 01:11:00,592
Who are they?

1688
01:11:00,593 --> 01:11:03,023
The first special judge is...

1689
01:11:06,463 --> 01:11:07,593
me. Park Gun Wook.

1690
01:11:11,203 --> 01:11:12,772
- Gun Wook. - Gun Wook.

1691
01:11:12,773 --> 01:11:13,972
- Oh, my gosh. - Gun Wook.

1692
01:11:13,973 --> 01:11:15,343
- Gun Wook. - Gun Wook.

1693
01:11:16,473 --> 01:11:18,002
- Go! - Let's go.

1694
01:11:18,003 --> 01:11:19,113
Let's go.

1695
01:11:19,343 --> 01:11:22,513
Let me continue to introduce the next special judge.

1696
01:11:22,983 --> 01:11:25,283
The leader of WE DEM BOYZ, the hot dance crew...

1697
01:11:26,153 --> 01:11:28,253
- that shook the world. - I feel so good

1698
01:11:28,783 --> 01:11:29,852
It's Vata.

1699
01:11:29,853 --> 01:11:32,499
(Vata, the leader of WE DEM BOYZ, a dance crew that shook the world)

1700
01:11:32,523 --> 01:11:35,893
(The trend-maker that leads the choreography of K-pop)

1701
01:11:36,393 --> 01:11:39,393
(The leader of WE DEM BOYZ, Vata)

1702
01:11:40,093 --> 01:11:41,963
(Special judge, Vata)

1703
01:11:43,133 --> 01:11:45,533
(Passing out because he's so happy)

1704
01:11:45,803 --> 01:11:47,703
This is the last special judge.

1705
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:51,512
He's someone who would be happy to be here as much as I am.

1706
01:11:51,513 --> 01:11:53,913
The legendary teacher in the world of K-pop choreography.

1707
01:11:54,843 --> 01:11:56,743
It's choreographer, Choi Young Jun.

1708
01:11:57,443 --> 01:11:58,882
(For ZEROBASEONE, TWS, and more)

1709
01:11:58,883 --> 01:12:00,813
(The undisputed top K-pop choreographer)

1710
01:12:01,053 --> 01:12:02,282
(BOYS PLANET Season 1)

1711
01:12:02,283 --> 01:12:03,629
(The original dance master, Choi Young Jun)

1712
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:05,923
(Jumping up and down)

1713
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:16,233
(A participant tribute Signal Song dance)

1714
01:12:18,703 --> 01:12:21,743
Planet Boy Fighter. The rules are simple.

1715
01:12:22,003 --> 01:12:23,572
First, you select three participants...

1716
01:12:23,573 --> 01:12:25,573
that represent each class.

1717
01:12:26,343 --> 01:12:27,872
It will be done in a tournament format,

1718
01:12:27,873 --> 01:12:32,313
and one team will advance to the finals by default.

1719
01:12:32,683 --> 01:12:35,382
The first class to win will win the battle.

1720
01:12:35,383 --> 01:12:37,223
(The final will be decided by a single match.)

1721
01:12:37,583 --> 01:12:39,623
Personally, I want to see something.

1722
01:12:40,493 --> 01:12:42,363
A match between KINKY and Kany.

1723
01:12:42,793 --> 01:12:44,993
- We can't just stand by. - We've got to see this.

1724
01:12:45,163 --> 01:12:47,163
- We've got to see this. - We should have it done.

1725
01:12:47,333 --> 01:12:49,333
(Kany and KINKY's sudden dance battle)

1726
01:12:53,873 --> 01:12:54,903
Let's go.

1727
01:12:57,103 --> 01:12:58,342
(Rushing forward)

1728
01:12:58,343 --> 01:12:59,913
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1729
01:13:00,073 --> 01:13:01,713
Let's go.

1730
01:13:04,953 --> 01:13:07,683
(This time, Master KINKY takes the turn.)

1731
01:13:07,913 --> 01:13:09,053
This is it.

1732
01:13:16,793 --> 01:13:18,363
He's so relaxed.

1733
01:13:20,133 --> 01:13:21,193
Come in.

1734
01:13:26,473 --> 01:13:29,113
(Magical clapping that makes you clap along like you're possessed)

1735
01:13:30,003 --> 01:13:32,013
It's a clapping attack.

1736
01:13:34,413 --> 01:13:35,612
Gosh. It goes well together.

1737
01:13:35,613 --> 01:13:37,389
(The atmosphere is heated up with the warm-up battle.)

1738
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,552
(The battle begins.)

1739
01:13:38,553 --> 01:13:42,223
Then All Star and One Star participants,

1740
01:13:42,753 --> 01:13:45,293
who will compete in the first battle,

1741
01:13:45,493 --> 01:13:47,123
please come up to the stage.

1742
01:13:48,093 --> 01:13:50,622
Wait a minute, judges.

1743
01:13:50,623 --> 01:13:52,463
If you take a look at our team,

1744
01:13:53,693 --> 01:13:56,262
we are All Stars.

1745
01:13:56,263 --> 01:13:57,363
Yes, you are All Stars.

1746
01:13:57,533 --> 01:14:00,033
We don't consider such a thing like win by default.

1747
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:05,313
(We don't consider it.)

1748
01:14:05,873 --> 01:14:08,043
So they want to make their way up from the bottom.

1749
01:14:08,943 --> 01:14:10,583
Rock, paper, scissors.

1750
01:14:10,983 --> 01:14:12,453
(Rock and paper)

1751
01:14:13,353 --> 01:14:15,683
(Master KINKY takes the win by default fair and square.)

1752
01:14:16,323 --> 01:14:19,093
(Two Star moves up to the finals by default.)

1753
01:14:19,453 --> 01:14:21,993
Participants to fight in the first battle,

1754
01:14:22,363 --> 01:14:23,963
please come up to the stage.

1755
01:14:25,463 --> 01:14:27,092
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1756
01:14:27,093 --> 01:14:29,533
- Kim Jun Min. - Let's go.

1757
01:14:29,833 --> 01:14:31,503
Jun-miney, let's go.

1758
01:14:33,633 --> 01:14:34,703
He's strong.

1759
01:14:35,173 --> 01:14:36,743
Gosh. He's too strong.

1760
01:14:38,513 --> 01:14:41,143
Jun Min even came with a slicked-back hairstyle.

1761
01:14:42,743 --> 01:14:45,513
(Who is Kim Jun Min's opponent?)

1762
01:14:45,813 --> 01:14:46,882
You, go.

1763
01:14:46,883 --> 01:14:48,083
(Cute Arctic has been chosen.)

1764
01:14:48,153 --> 01:14:49,553
Let's go.

1765
01:14:49,653 --> 01:14:51,552
- Arctic. - Arctic.

1766
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:53,322
Let's go, Arctic.

1767
01:14:53,323 --> 01:14:54,822
(One Star Arctic participates in the preliminary match.)

1768
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,222
- Arctic. - Arctic.

1769
01:14:56,223 --> 01:14:57,862
- Hello. - Arctic.

1770
01:14:57,863 --> 01:15:00,732
- Arctic. - Arctic.

1771
01:15:00,733 --> 01:15:02,103
- Jun Min. - Jun Min.

1772
01:15:02,203 --> 01:15:04,403
(The cheering war has already begun.)

1773
01:15:04,603 --> 01:15:06,132
- Arctic. - Who should I cheer for?

1774
01:15:06,133 --> 01:15:07,403
- Arctic. - Arctic.

1775
01:15:07,733 --> 01:15:09,272
You should cheer for One Stars.

1776
01:15:09,273 --> 01:15:10,273
- Okay. - Arctic.

1777
01:15:10,274 --> 01:15:11,402
I'm looking forward to this.

1778
01:15:11,403 --> 01:15:12,542
I think they'll do a good job.

1779
01:15:12,543 --> 01:15:13,543
- Arctic. - Arctic.

1780
01:15:13,544 --> 01:15:15,243
Boys, max the power.

1781
01:15:16,383 --> 01:15:17,813
Music, start.

1782
01:15:18,783 --> 01:15:20,853
(All Star Kim Jun Min versus One Star Arctic)

1783
01:15:26,353 --> 01:15:28,092
They are not starting.

1784
01:15:28,093 --> 01:15:29,363
They aren't getting heated up.

1785
01:15:31,763 --> 01:15:32,992
They aren't getting heated up.

1786
01:15:32,993 --> 01:15:34,232
(Preheating's done.)

1787
01:15:34,233 --> 01:15:36,303
(All Star Kim Jun Min takes the start first.)

1788
01:16:00,123 --> 01:16:03,763
(Kim Jun Min's clean first strike)

1789
01:16:05,993 --> 01:16:07,392
(A sudden change in the eyes)

1790
01:16:07,393 --> 01:16:09,102
Arctic's eyes changed.

1791
01:16:09,103 --> 01:16:10,703
(How will Arctic dance to counter this?)

1792
01:16:17,203 --> 01:16:18,443
That's it.

1793
01:16:26,413 --> 01:16:27,413
- Come on. - Hey.

1794
01:16:28,453 --> 01:16:29,553
What is this?

1795
01:16:31,053 --> 01:16:32,093
What's this?

1796
01:16:42,133 --> 01:16:45,333
- Come on. - Come on.

1797
01:16:47,433 --> 01:16:48,643
Arctic.

1798
01:16:49,543 --> 01:16:50,743
He's good.

1799
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:57,142
(A dance that evokes admiration)

1800
01:16:57,143 --> 01:16:58,242
Let's go.

1801
01:16:58,243 --> 01:16:59,852
(One Stars are already enjoying the festive mood.)

1802
01:16:59,853 --> 01:17:01,313
- Gosh. - Yes.

1803
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:02,883
Wait.

1804
01:17:05,223 --> 01:17:07,093
Wait. Why are you so good?

1805
01:17:07,893 --> 01:17:12,633
Three, two, one.

1806
01:17:12,663 --> 01:17:15,133
(Fight over)

1807
01:17:16,533 --> 01:17:18,133
He's better than I thought.

1808
01:17:18,933 --> 01:17:20,493
- He listened to the music well. - Yes.

1809
01:17:20,633 --> 01:17:23,403
He looks innocent, but he dances well.

1810
01:17:24,173 --> 01:17:26,513
All Stars might be in a dangerous situation here.

1811
01:17:26,943 --> 01:17:28,782
I think our team will win this time.

1812
01:17:28,783 --> 01:17:31,463
From today on, we're going to have a comeback win for our One Star.

1813
01:17:31,883 --> 01:17:35,783
All Star versus One Star.

Let's go.

1821

Yes, come on.

1822
01:17:53,603 --> 01:17:55,173
- Come on. - Yes.

1823
01:17:55,603 --> 01:17:57,003
Well done.

Please play the music.

1829
01:18:07,553 --> 01:18:08,823
Let's go, Hsu Ching Yu.

1830
01:18:09,123 --> 01:18:10,153
Let's go.

1831
01:18:16,323 --> 01:18:18,123
Who's first?

1832
01:18:18,933 --> 01:18:20,133
It's his.

1833
01:18:21,903 --> 01:18:24,903
- Let's go. - Go Zhao Guang Xu.

1834
01:18:26,773 --> 01:18:28,003
Why are you doing that to me?

1835
01:18:29,573 --> 01:18:30,603
Come on.

1836
01:18:31,203 --> 01:18:32,313
What's that?

1837
01:18:32,643 --> 01:18:34,373
- Is he B-boying? - Is that B-boying?

1838
01:18:38,443 --> 01:18:42,383
(Mouth drops)

1839
01:18:46,423 --> 01:18:48,153
He's awesome.

1840
01:18:55,763 --> 01:18:56,863
Go.

1841
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:03,172
(It's Hsu Ching Yu's turn.)

1842
01:19:03,173 --> 01:19:04,843
Hsu Ching Yu.

1843
01:19:14,453 --> 01:19:15,782
Gosh.

1844
01:19:15,783 --> 01:19:16,953
(Surprised)

1845
01:19:17,523 --> 01:19:19,153
(Amazed)

1846
01:19:22,923 --> 01:19:23,993
That's crazy.

1847
01:19:25,633 --> 01:19:26,793
What is it?

1848
01:19:31,863 --> 01:19:33,003
He's lifting.

1849
01:19:33,173 --> 01:19:34,703
He's lifting. What is it?

1850
01:19:36,943 --> 01:19:38,443
Oh, my gosh.

1851
01:19:38,913 --> 01:19:40,513
Oh, my gosh.

1852
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:45,613
Gosh.

1853
01:19:46,753 --> 01:19:47,853
This is it.

1854
01:19:48,823 --> 01:19:50,383
Something shot out of his foot.

1855
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,862
(Dumbfounded)

1856
01:19:56,863 --> 01:19:57,963
This is crazy.

1857
01:19:58,493 --> 01:19:59,863
This is incredible.

1858

01:20:03,463 --> 01:20:04,663
This was really fun.

1887
01:21:20,773 --> 01:21:22,182
(Hsu Ching Yu of All Star goes first.)

1888
01:21:22,183 --> 01:21:24,143

Gosh, he's the real deal.

1893
01:21:40,093 --> 01:21:41,193
(That's it!)

1894
01:21:42,663 --> 01:21:44,103
Oh, my gosh!

1895
01:21:50,373 --> 01:21:51,743
Hey!

1896
01:21:52,713 --> 01:21:54,773
He's seriously insane. He's no joke.

1897
01:21:57,513 --> 01:21:59,383
How did he catch the background rhythm?

1898
01:22:00,283 --> 01:22:01,553
Arctic!

1899

That's insane.

1903

Three,

1904
01:22:21,873 --> 01:22:23,302
two,

1905
01:22:23,303 --> 01:22:25,072
one.

1906
01:22:25,073 --> 01:22:27,433
(Round 3 of the preliminaries ends for Planet Boy Fighter.)

1907
01:22:27,613 --> 01:22:30,313
- I can't predict the result. - I can't predict the result.

1908
01:22:30,643 --> 01:22:31,743
I can't choose.

1909
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:34,713
Master Back Koo Young, you seem a bit surprised.

1910
01:22:34,913 --> 01:22:36,913
What did you think after watching the performance?

1911
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:40,693
Me? I didn't watch the performance. I knew that Hsu Ching Yu would win.

1912
01:22:41,393 --> 01:22:42,423
Come on.

1913
01:22:43,223 --> 01:22:46,363
I knew that Hsu Ching Yu would win, so I sat down and did TikTok.

1914
01:22:47,233 --> 01:22:49,363
I saw him. Did you see him?

1915
01:22:49,463 --> 01:22:51,063
Did everybody see him?

1916
01:22:51,703 --> 01:22:53,173
I hope you all saw him.

1917
01:22:53,833 --> 01:22:55,433
That chicken is ours.

1918
01:22:56,043 --> 01:22:57,803
That chicken is ours.

Congratulations.

1928
01:23:18,363 --> 01:23:20,093

We don't know.

(Laughing)

1938
01:23:45,323 --> 01:23:47,452
- No one? - I'll go next.

1939
01:23:47,453 --> 01:23:49,623
- Okay. - Be quiet.

1940
01:23:49,793 --> 01:23:52,123
- I'll go next. - Dong Heon will go next.

1941
01:23:53,433 --> 01:23:55,233
Heui Chan, did you warm up?

1942
01:23:55,333 --> 01:23:56,333
I won't go next.

1943
01:23:57,103 --> 01:23:59,049
Everyone says that he won't go next. Is no one going next?

1944
01:23:59,073 --> 01:24:00,602
I told you that I was going next.

1945
01:24:00,603 --> 01:24:03,272
- Why don't you believe me? - Okay. I believe you.

1946
01:24:03,273 --> 01:24:05,813
- It's true. - Stay seated.

1947
01:24:06,473 --> 01:24:08,272
You have bad joints, so stay seated.

1948
01:24:08,273 --> 01:24:10,143
(Oh, okay.)

1949
01:24:10,483 --> 01:24:13,183
Now, which participants will represent their classes...

1950
01:24:13,283 --> 01:24:16,823
and participate in the final battle?

1951
01:24:17,653 --> 01:24:20,193
The participant who'll represent the All Star Class is...

1952
01:24:22,193 --> 01:24:23,922
(Who will it be?)

1953
01:24:23,923 --> 01:24:26,362
the epitome of talent, Jung Hyun Jun.

1954
01:24:26,363 --> 01:24:27,832
(Jung Hyun Jun of All Star enters the final round.)

1955
01:24:27,833 --> 01:24:29,433
Jung Hyun Jun.

1956
01:24:31,403 --> 01:24:33,673
- Let's go. - Yes.

1957
01:24:35,433 --> 01:24:37,142
The participant...

1958
01:24:37,143 --> 01:24:39,173
from Two Star Class...

1959
01:24:39,273 --> 01:24:44,143
who will crush Jung Hyun Jun is...

1960
01:24:44,743 --> 01:24:46,782
- Dong Heon, good luck. - Dong Heon, you can do it.

1961
01:24:46,783 --> 01:24:47,783
It's...

1962
01:24:47,784 --> 01:24:50,953
(So, who is it?)

1963
01:24:51,723 --> 01:24:52,752
Xue Su Ren.

1964
01:24:52,753 --> 01:24:54,822
- Xue Su Ren! - Let's go!

1965
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:56,363
Let's go!

1966
01:24:56,463 --> 01:24:59,463
- Xue Su Ren! - Let's go!

1967
01:24:59,863 --> 01:25:01,263
He was the main dancer.

1968
01:25:01,493 --> 01:25:03,103
Yes. He's really good.

1969
01:25:03,203 --> 01:25:05,403
Show them that you're the main dancer of PLANET C.

1970
01:25:06,003 --> 01:25:07,003
(Final Round)

1971
01:25:07,004 --> 01:25:08,902
(Jung Hyun Jun of All Star versus Xue Su Ren of Two Star)

1972
01:25:08,903 --> 01:25:11,543
- Boys, max the power! - Max the power!

1973
01:25:13,813 --> 01:25:14,973
Hyun Jun, show them!

1974
01:25:15,373 --> 01:25:16,933
(Jung Hyun Jun of All Star goes first.)

1975
01:25:20,313 --> 01:25:21,613
Rocking!

1976
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:24,252
(He commands the stage with the rocking dance.)

1977
01:25:24,253 --> 01:25:25,453
Rocking!

1978
01:25:35,393 --> 01:25:37,839
- He even provokes Xue Su Ren. - Xue Su Ren isn't looking at him.

1979
01:25:37,863 --> 01:25:38,863
Three,

1980
01:25:39,273 --> 01:25:40,273
two,

1981
01:25:40,633 --> 01:25:42,543
one.

1982
01:25:44,503 --> 01:25:45,503
Two,

1983
01:25:45,843 --> 01:25:47,972
one.

1984
01:25:47,973 --> 01:25:49,089
(He wraps up the performance by sticking 2 Star to the floor.)

1985
01:25:49,113 --> 01:25:50,212
Let's go!

1986
01:25:50,213 --> 01:25:51,589
(The spicy provocation makes Arctic pass out.)

1987
01:25:51,613 --> 01:25:53,553
(Xue Su Ren of 2 Star goes next.)

1988
01:26:08,093 --> 01:26:09,433
Hey, he's good.

1989
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:12,473
What's up with him?

1990
01:26:14,073 --> 01:26:15,233
What?

1991
01:26:26,583 --> 01:26:30,053
(Xue Su Ren's bottom dance livens up the atmosphere.)

1992
01:26:33,153 --> 01:26:34,153
Three,

1993
01:26:34,154 --> 01:26:35,223
two,

1994
01:26:35,323 --> 01:26:36,723
one.

1995
01:26:41,963 --> 01:26:43,603
Both of them have so much talent.

1996
01:26:43,703 --> 01:26:45,833
- Both of them were dancers. - I know.

1997
01:26:46,433 --> 01:26:47,833
It was so much fun.

1998
01:26:48,033 --> 01:26:49,603
They're really good.

1999
01:26:49,943 --> 01:26:51,872
It was insane. Their dance skills were seriously...

2000
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:53,113
They're really good.

2001
01:26:53,373 --> 01:26:55,249
It was a match between the talented participants.

2002
01:26:55,273 --> 01:26:57,612
Between Jung Hyun Jun of All Star...

2003
01:26:57,613 --> 01:27:00,753
and Xue Su Ren of Two Star, who will be the winner?

2004
01:27:03,653 --> 01:27:05,283
Xue Su Ren of Two Star is the winner.

2005
01:27:06,293 --> 01:27:07,492
Congratulations.

2006
01:27:07,493 --> 01:27:08,723
(Xue Su Ren of 2 Star wins.)

2007
01:27:09,093 --> 01:27:11,593
(Cheer for the great Xue Su Ren.)

2008
01:27:12,463 --> 01:27:15,462
(The chicken ceremony of victory)

2009
01:27:15,463 --> 01:27:19,002
Which class is the final winner? It's Two Star. Congratulations.

2010
01:27:19,003 --> 01:27:21,302
(The benefit, chicken enters.)

2011
01:27:21,303 --> 01:27:23,003
(They enjoy the smell first.)

2012
01:27:23,773 --> 01:27:24,843
Seriously.

2013
01:27:25,243 --> 01:27:28,813
Hey, it looks so tasty. Seriously.

2014
01:27:28,913 --> 01:27:31,713
Thank you for the food.

2015
01:27:36,723 --> 01:27:38,053
Who made this?

2016
01:27:38,523 --> 01:27:40,804
It's the tastiest chicken I've ever had. Gosh, this is...

2017
01:27:41,993 --> 01:27:44,193
I bet it tastes good with rice.

2018
01:27:44,863 --> 01:27:47,133
(They can't help but look.)

2019
01:27:47,293 --> 01:27:48,692
While the chicken is tasty,

2020
01:27:48,693 --> 01:27:50,333
- this is the taste of victory. - I know.

2021
01:27:52,573 --> 01:27:54,632
Let's eat this and cheer up even more. Let's go.

2022
01:27:54,633 --> 01:27:56,002
(This is torture.)

2023
01:27:56,003 --> 01:27:57,472
It's hard to watch them.

2024
01:27:57,473 --> 01:27:58,503
I'm hungry.

2025
01:27:58,943 --> 01:28:01,243
There are 100 chickens, right?

2026
01:28:01,713 --> 01:28:03,412
We didn't even get 30 chickens.

2027
01:28:03,413 --> 01:28:05,583
- Really? - That means 70 chickens remain.

2028
01:28:05,913 --> 01:28:06,952
No way.

2029
01:28:06,953 --> 01:28:09,152
Among the One Star and All Star participants,

2030
01:28:09,153 --> 01:28:12,022
is there anyone who can show his passion for chicken?

2031
01:28:12,023 --> 01:28:14,353
(Lee Sang Won revs himself up.)

2032
01:28:14,853 --> 01:28:16,423
- I'll go right away. - Okay.

2033
01:28:16,823 --> 01:28:17,923
Make it fun, Sang Won.

2034
01:28:20,233 --> 01:28:22,093
Gosh, you can't pass.

2035
01:28:23,633 --> 01:28:24,633
(What?)

2036
01:28:26,333 --> 01:28:27,773
But mochi can pass.

2037
01:28:32,713 --> 01:28:34,173
(He got chicken by acting cute.)

2038
01:28:35,883 --> 01:28:38,543
(Thanks to him, everyone enjoys the benefit.)

2039
01:28:40,283 --> 01:28:41,413
I'm so happy.

2040
01:28:41,913 --> 01:28:43,023
This is happiness.

2041
01:28:47,153 --> 01:28:48,253
It was insane.

2042
01:28:48,653 --> 01:28:52,222
All right. Please invite me when you have the next dance battle.

2043
01:28:52,223 --> 01:28:53,433
- Okay. - Okay.

2044
01:28:53,533 --> 01:28:54,593
Please join us.

2045
01:28:55,393 --> 01:28:58,203
The First Survivor Announcement of BOYS II PLANET.

2046
01:28:58,303 --> 01:29:00,803
Team "Rising Sun," Team "KILL THE ROMEO,"

2047
01:29:01,003 --> 01:29:02,173
and Team "S-Class."

2048
01:29:02,573 --> 01:29:04,973
The announcement for three teams has been made.

2049
01:29:05,073 --> 01:29:06,773
If we exclude the 10 Top 8 candidates...

2050
01:29:06,873 --> 01:29:10,613
as well as the 47th and 48th places,

2051
01:29:10,713 --> 01:29:13,553
only 16 seats remain.

2052
01:29:13,853 --> 01:29:16,953
- My goodness. - Are there only 16 seats?

2053
01:29:17,323 --> 01:29:18,383
It makes no sense.

2054
01:29:18,583 --> 01:29:19,593
That's a small number.

2055
01:29:20,193 --> 01:29:22,863
The next team whose results I'll announce is...

2056
01:29:23,223 --> 01:29:25,933
Team "Plot Twist."

2057
01:29:26,063 --> 01:29:28,093
- Okay. "Plot Twist." - Let's go.

2058
01:29:29,133 --> 01:29:30,163
Good luck.

2059
01:29:32,363 --> 01:29:33,633
It's a strong team.

2060
01:29:33,733 --> 01:29:35,303
Many members of this team will survive.

2061
01:29:37,503 --> 01:29:39,542
(9th, Kang Woo Jin, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2062
01:29:39,543 --> 01:29:41,343
(42nd, Jung Hyun Jun, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2063
01:29:41,713 --> 01:29:43,013
I'm so nervous.

2064
01:29:43,613 --> 01:29:45,383
My heart is about to jump out.

2065
01:29:46,283 --> 01:29:49,583
"Plot Twist" Team 2 of 1 Star...

2066
01:29:50,053 --> 01:29:52,923
won against Team One of All Star...

2067
01:29:53,023 --> 01:29:56,993
and received the best team benefit from 1-on-1 Class Battle,

2068
01:29:57,523 --> 01:29:59,563
three hundred thousand points.

2069
01:29:59,863 --> 01:30:01,133
That's right.

2070
01:30:01,393 --> 01:30:03,262
- Three hundred thousand points. - That's incredible.

2071
01:30:03,263 --> 01:30:05,533
Three hundred thousand points? That's unbelievable.

2072
01:30:05,803 --> 01:30:06,833
I'm jealous.

2073
01:30:07,203 --> 01:30:10,273
How will 300,000 points affect the outcome?

2074
01:30:11,243 --> 01:30:13,412
In Team "Plot Twist,"

2075
01:30:13,413 --> 01:30:16,943
the highest ranking of a survivor is...

2076
01:30:17,543 --> 01:30:19,143
the 12th place.

2077
01:30:19,383 --> 01:30:21,129
(4th, Chung Sang Hyeon, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2078
01:30:21,153 --> 01:30:22,513
- The 12th place? - That's insane.

2079
01:30:22,683 --> 01:30:23,753
That's high.

2080
01:30:24,123 --> 01:30:25,123
Who is it?

2081
01:30:25,453 --> 01:30:27,013
The participant who is in 12th place...

2082
01:30:27,193 --> 01:30:30,493
has vocals that are incredibly charming.

2083
01:30:31,163 --> 01:30:32,163
His voice?

2084
01:30:33,133 --> 01:30:34,163
Is it Woo Jin?

2085
01:30:34,663 --> 01:30:36,663
- Woo Jin. - Could it be Woo Jin?

2086
01:30:37,103 --> 01:30:39,202
(During the Class Placement Match)

2087
01:30:39,203 --> 01:30:41,803
(His sweet voice stood out during the performance.)

2088
01:30:42,803 --> 01:30:47,013
(Kang Woo Jin showcased his vocal skills.)

2089
01:30:47,343 --> 01:30:48,973
I think that it's Woo Jin.

2090
01:30:49,383 --> 01:30:50,513
It could be Han Eum.

2091
01:30:50,843 --> 01:30:51,843
Han Eum.

2092
01:30:51,883 --> 01:30:53,453
Han Eum has an attractive voice.

2093
01:30:53,983 --> 01:31:00,023
(Jang Han Eum's explosive singing in high notes is attractive.)

2094
01:31:00,393 --> 01:31:01,993
It's either Han Eum or Woo Jin.

2095
01:31:02,323 --> 01:31:03,823
Yun Seo also has an attractive voice.

2096
01:31:03,923 --> 01:31:05,223
I hope that it's me.

2097
01:31:05,793 --> 01:31:08,092
During the Class Placement Match,

2098
01:31:08,093 --> 01:31:09,503
he performed solo...

2099
01:31:09,833 --> 01:31:11,503
on stage.

2100
01:31:11,563 --> 01:31:12,703
Both of them did.

2101
01:31:12,873 --> 01:31:13,933
Both of them sang solo.

2102
01:31:14,103 --> 01:31:15,333
They both sang solo.

2103
01:31:15,603 --> 01:31:18,473
(Kang Woo Jin and Jang Han Eum performed solo during the match.)

2104
01:31:19,003 --> 01:31:20,012
Who could it be?

2105
01:31:20,013 --> 01:31:21,343
It's so hard to guess.

2106
01:31:21,643 --> 01:31:24,142
Based on the global voting,

2107
01:31:24,143 --> 01:31:25,943
the surviving participant in 12th place is...

2108
01:31:28,683 --> 01:31:29,852
Jang Han Eum.

2109
01:31:29,853 --> 01:31:32,553
(Jang Han Eum survives in 12th place.)

2110
01:31:36,493 --> 01:31:38,162
Han Eum ranked so high.

2111
01:31:38,163 --> 01:31:39,439
(Jang Han Eum moved up 7 places.)

2112
01:31:39,463 --> 01:31:40,823
Is it possible to move up so much?

2113
01:31:41,233 --> 01:31:43,193
I guess 300,000-something points are significant.

2114
01:31:43,333 --> 01:31:44,403
That's amazing.

2115
01:31:44,663 --> 01:31:47,273
The next participant is...

2116
01:31:47,803 --> 01:31:49,603
in 19th place.

2117
01:31:49,843 --> 01:31:51,473
The participant in 19th place was...

2118
01:31:51,703 --> 01:31:52,973
born in the Year of the Tiger.

2119
01:31:53,413 --> 01:31:54,933
Who was born in the Year of the Tiger?

2120
01:31:56,083 --> 01:31:57,183
Isn't it Xin Long?

2121
01:31:57,583 --> 01:31:58,583
No, it's not.
(He Xin Long was born in 2005, the Year of the Rooster.)

2122
01:31:59,584 --> 01:32:00,813
I think it's Lee Jeong.

2123
01:32:00,953 --> 01:32:02,152
Wasn't he born in the Year of the Sheep?

2124
01:32:02,153 --> 01:32:03,313
(Jun Lee Jeong in 34th place)

2125
01:32:03,423 --> 01:32:04,582
He was born in the Year of the Tiger.

2126
01:32:04,583 --> 01:32:06,653
(The tiger?)

2127
01:32:08,053 --> 01:32:09,623
- Were you born then? - Yes.

2128
01:32:09,993 --> 01:32:11,322
Yun Seo, you were born in the Year of the Tiger?

2129
01:32:11,323 --> 01:32:13,362
- It must be Yun Seo. - It's Yun Seo.

2130
01:32:13,363 --> 01:32:14,762
- Born in the Year of the Tiger. - Were you?

2131
01:32:14,763 --> 01:32:16,962
- Yes. - It's Yun Seo.

2132
01:32:16,963 --> 01:32:18,202
(So far, Na Yun Seo is the only one born in the Year of the Tiger.)

2133
01:32:18,203 --> 01:32:20,209
Maybe there's someone else born in the Year of the Tiger.

2134
01:32:20,233 --> 01:32:21,433
That's true.

2135
01:32:22,073 --> 01:32:23,393
- Is there anyone else? - Really?

2136
01:32:23,473 --> 01:32:24,772
I was born in the Year of the Tiger.

2137
01:32:24,773 --> 01:32:26,473
(Yi Chen is the hidden one born in 1998.)

2138
01:32:26,613 --> 01:32:28,053
I was born in the Year of the Tiger.

2139
01:32:31,183 --> 01:32:32,643
Then it must be Yi Chen.

2140
01:32:34,983 --> 01:32:37,023
Based on the global voting,

2141
01:32:37,323 --> 01:32:39,123
the surviving participant in 19th place is...

2142
01:32:39,823 --> 01:32:40,952
Yi Chen.

2143
01:32:40,953 --> 01:32:43,323
(Yi Chen survives in 19th place.)

2144
01:32:44,893 --> 01:32:45,963
He ranked that high?

2145
01:32:47,263 --> 01:32:50,603
Yi Chen who consistently delivered stable performances...

2146
01:32:50,763 --> 01:32:54,133
received the benefit and climbed up the rankings.

2147
01:32:54,373 --> 01:32:55,772
Congratulations on surviving.

2148
01:32:55,773 --> 01:32:57,643
(Yi Chen, 19th, 2,898,457 points)

2149
01:32:58,673 --> 01:32:59,773
(Sighing)

2150
01:33:00,543 --> 01:33:02,883
You've been sighing all day long.

2151
01:33:03,383 --> 01:33:05,143
I just need to survive.

2152
01:33:07,153 --> 01:33:10,353
The next surviving participant is...

2153
01:33:10,553 --> 01:33:12,353
in 22nd place.

2154
01:33:12,823 --> 01:33:16,393
He moved up to All Star Class after placing 22nd.

2155
01:33:16,523 --> 01:33:17,723
He's in his teens.

2156
01:33:18,223 --> 01:33:22,363
He's been complimented on his singing skills.

2157
01:33:22,593 --> 01:33:23,833
I wish I were still a teenager.

2158
01:33:24,233 --> 01:33:25,533
Isn't it Yun Seo?

2159
01:33:25,733 --> 01:33:26,733
Yun Seo.

2160
01:33:26,873 --> 01:33:30,473
- You're making me anticipate. - He's already smiling.

2161
01:33:30,873 --> 01:33:32,743
(During the Signal Song Test)

2162
01:33:33,013 --> 01:33:34,073
The vibe is...

2163
01:33:34,113 --> 01:33:39,183
(The Masters complimented on Na Yun Seo's singing.)

2164
01:33:39,343 --> 01:33:40,753
It must be Yun Seo.

2165
01:33:41,053 --> 01:33:42,483
Isn't Bo Wen also a teenager?

2166
01:33:42,983 --> 01:33:44,423
Isn't Bo Wen also a teenager?

2167
01:33:45,323 --> 01:33:46,893
There's also Bo Wen.

2168
01:33:47,323 --> 01:33:48,352
(During the Class Placement Match)

2169
01:33:48,353 --> 01:33:52,993
(Chen Bo Wen surprised the Masters with his amazing vocal skills.)

2170
01:33:53,563 --> 01:33:54,633
Bo Wen.

2171
01:33:55,193 --> 01:33:56,563
No, it's not me.

2172
01:33:56,763 --> 01:33:57,833
Who will it be?

2173
01:33:58,133 --> 01:33:59,472
There's also Woo Jin.

2174
01:33:59,473 --> 01:34:01,902
- It's you. - There's also...

2175
01:34:01,903 --> 01:34:03,172
- Be confident. - Or it's Bo Wen.

2176
01:34:03,173 --> 01:34:04,203
Be confident.

2177
01:34:04,473 --> 01:34:06,073
The surviving participant in 22nd place.

2178
01:34:07,713 --> 01:34:08,812
It's Na Yun Seo.

2179
01:34:08,813 --> 01:34:11,842
(Na Yun Seo survives in 22nd place.)

2180
01:34:11,843 --> 01:34:13,053
Congratulations.

2181
01:34:13,483 --> 01:34:15,212
Na Yun Seo made...

2182
01:34:15,213 --> 01:34:18,323
many Star Creators fall in love with his tough man's charms.

2183
01:34:18,553 --> 01:34:21,892
Lately, he boosted He Xin Long's self-esteem...

2184
01:34:21,893 --> 01:34:24,323
and became the admirable youngest.

2185
01:34:24,563 --> 01:34:26,533
Congratulations on your survival.

2186
01:34:27,033 --> 01:34:29,803
Yun Seo moved up seven places without getting the benefit.

2187
01:34:29,833 --> 01:34:31,063
Yun Seo is incredible.

2188
01:34:31,903 --> 01:34:33,583
I'm glad that I held the umbrella for him.

2189
01:34:35,533 --> 01:34:38,502
All the older team members have been caring.

2190
01:34:38,503 --> 01:34:40,372
As they guided me well,

2191
01:34:40,373 --> 01:34:43,183
I couldn't have accomplished this without them.

2192
01:34:43,583 --> 01:34:45,243
I will work harder from now on.

2193
01:34:49,553 --> 01:34:52,853
Surviving participants, congratulations again.

2194
01:34:55,053 --> 01:34:56,093
I'm jealous.

2195
01:34:56,663 --> 01:34:59,493
The next surviving participant is...

2196
01:34:59,563 --> 01:35:01,533
in 23rd place.

2197
01:35:03,403 --> 01:35:05,033
(The seat right next to his)

2198
01:35:05,203 --> 01:35:07,003
Right next to Yun Seo.

2199
01:35:07,503 --> 01:35:09,303
The participant in 23rd place...

2200
01:35:09,603 --> 01:35:11,472
consistently showed his skills.

2201
01:35:11,473 --> 01:35:14,173
He moved up the rankings from Week Three.

2202
01:35:14,543 --> 01:35:15,613
Who could it be?

2203
01:35:16,043 --> 01:35:17,143
Chen Bo Wen?

2204
01:35:17,643 --> 01:35:19,553
Or it could be Bo Heng.

2205
01:35:19,853 --> 01:35:21,183
There's also Tae Jo.

2206
01:35:21,753 --> 01:35:23,683
It could also be Hyun Jun.

2207
01:35:24,153 --> 01:35:25,183
Who is it?

2208
01:35:25,653 --> 01:35:26,653
I don't know.

2209
01:35:27,123 --> 01:35:28,493
Consistent skills?

2210
01:35:30,493 --> 01:35:31,723
Lee Jeong?

2211
01:35:32,293 --> 01:35:33,633
It sounds like Lee Jeong.

2212
01:35:34,593 --> 01:35:35,763
Lee Jeong?

2213
01:35:36,433 --> 01:35:38,102
I'll announce the All Star participant...

2214
01:35:38,103 --> 01:35:41,033
in 23rd place who survived based on the global voting.

2215
01:35:41,773 --> 01:35:43,543
The one in 23rd place is...

2216
01:35:45,073 --> 01:35:46,203
Jun Lee Jeong.

2217
01:35:46,343 --> 01:35:51,043
(Jun Lee Jeong survives in 23rd place.)

2218
01:35:51,783 --> 01:35:52,913
That's amazing.

2219
01:35:55,153 --> 01:35:57,023
Lee Jeong, you finally made it to All Star.

2220
01:35:57,953 --> 01:35:59,923
Lee Jeong created a drama.

2221
01:36:00,823 --> 01:36:04,023
(In 2 Star Class during the Class Placement Match)

2222
01:36:05,323 --> 01:36:08,163
(Jun Lee Jeong moved down to 1 Star after Signal Song Test.)

2223
01:36:09,293 --> 01:36:12,563
(He made and led his team.)

2224
01:36:13,273 --> 01:36:16,843
(He also overcame a conflict with his teammate.)

2225
01:36:18,143 --> 01:36:21,043
(Jun Lee Jeong completed it with an amazing performance.)

2226
01:36:22,043 --> 01:36:25,383
(He obtained 300,000 points by defeating the All Star team.)

2227
01:36:26,313 --> 01:36:29,982
(Jun Lee Jeong, 23rd, 2,486,764 points)

2228
01:36:29,983 --> 01:36:31,683
He moved up by a lot.

2229
01:36:31,983 --> 01:36:33,623
The 300,000 points are significant.

2230
01:36:34,493 --> 01:36:36,863
I'll announce the next survivor.

2231
01:36:37,063 --> 01:36:40,533
The next participant to survive is...

2232
01:36:40,693 --> 01:36:42,433
in 24th place.

2233
01:36:43,163 --> 01:36:44,632
It's consecutive.

2234
01:36:44,633 --> 01:36:45,732
(Na Yun Seo, Jun Lee Jeong, 24th place)

2235
01:36:45,733 --> 01:36:47,302
Placing 24th,

2236
01:36:47,303 --> 01:36:50,843
the last participant in All Star Class.

2237
01:36:50,873 --> 01:36:53,072
For the performance of "Plot Twist,"

2238
01:36:53,073 --> 01:36:55,173
he carried a bag.

2239
01:36:55,713 --> 01:36:56,783
A bag?

2240
01:36:57,343 --> 01:36:58,483
Isn't it Hyun Jun?

2241
01:36:58,943 --> 01:36:59,953
He had a panda bag.

2242
01:37:00,753 --> 01:37:01,913
I think it's Nian Bo Heng.

2243
01:37:02,083 --> 01:37:03,323
I think it's Nian Bo Heng.

2244
01:37:04,053 --> 01:37:05,153
Chen Bo Wen.

2245
01:37:05,923 --> 01:37:06,992
I also carried a bag.

2246
01:37:06,993 --> 01:37:07,993
(Candidate 4: Chung Sang Hyeon)

2247
01:37:07,994 --> 01:37:09,822
I will announce the participant...

2248
01:37:09,823 --> 01:37:12,093
in 24th place who survived based on the global voting.

2249
01:37:12,363 --> 01:37:13,633
The one in 24th place.

2250
01:37:15,733 --> 01:37:18,132
It's Nian Bo Heng.

2251
01:37:18,133 --> 01:37:21,373
(Nian Bo Heng survives in 24th place.)

2252
01:37:21,773 --> 01:37:24,073
- Congratulations. - Well done.

2253
01:37:24,203 --> 01:37:25,572
His voice is very charming.

2254
01:37:25,573 --> 01:37:27,673
Right, his voice is very low.

2255
01:37:28,673 --> 01:37:33,453
(Nian Bo Heng left a strong impression with his low voice.)

2256
01:37:36,783 --> 01:37:38,222
Placing 24th,

2257
01:37:38,223 --> 01:37:40,753
he took the last All Star seat.

2258
01:37:41,253 --> 01:37:42,653
Congratulations on your survival.

2259
01:37:43,363 --> 01:37:44,863
I wonder if there are more.

2260
01:37:45,293 --> 01:37:47,893
The next surviving participant is...

2261
01:37:48,063 --> 01:37:49,663
in 32nd place.

2262
01:37:49,933 --> 01:37:51,833
The one in 32nd place was...

2263
01:37:51,933 --> 01:37:56,133
born after 2008.

2264
01:37:56,803 --> 01:37:57,873
The year 2008?

2265
01:37:58,343 --> 01:37:59,373
Who is it?

2266
01:37:59,813 --> 01:38:01,413
That includes both of you.

2267
01:38:01,943 --> 01:38:03,783
- Arctic? - Arctic?

2268
01:38:04,383 --> 01:38:05,613
Dong B.

2269
01:38:06,213 --> 01:38:08,083
Dong Hyun was born in 2008.

2270
01:38:08,353 --> 01:38:09,413
He was also born in 2008.

2271
01:38:09,853 --> 01:38:11,683
(Chen Bo Wen was born in 2008.)

2272
01:38:12,023 --> 01:38:13,323
Bo Wen, please survive.

2273
01:38:14,423 --> 01:38:15,493
What about you, Hyun Jun?

2274
01:38:15,793 --> 01:38:17,762
I'm one of them, but I don't think it's me.

2275
01:38:17,763 --> 01:38:18,763
Why not?

2276
01:38:19,063 --> 01:38:20,532
I'll announce the participant...

2277
01:38:20,533 --> 01:38:22,863
in 32nd place who survived based on the global voting.

2278
01:38:23,403 --> 01:38:25,063
The surviving participant in 32nd place.

2279
01:38:26,233 --> 01:38:28,432
It's Chen Bo Wen.

2280
01:38:28,433 --> 01:38:32,743
(Chen Bo Wen survives in 32nd place.)

2281
01:38:32,843 --> 01:38:33,943
It's Chen Bo Wen.

2282
01:38:38,343 --> 01:38:40,413
Congratulations. Well done.

2283
01:38:40,913 --> 01:38:42,382
Congratulations on your survival.

2284
01:38:42,383 --> 01:38:43,863
(Chen Bo Wen, 32nd, 1,838,611 points)

2285
01:38:44,083 --> 01:38:45,883
The next surviving participant is...

2286
01:38:46,183 --> 01:38:47,593
in 41st place.

2287
01:38:48,493 --> 01:38:50,923
The one in 41st place is...

2288
01:38:51,623 --> 01:38:52,663
from Seoul...

2289
01:38:53,023 --> 01:38:55,833
- Seoul Metropolitan City. - He's not from Seoul.

2290
01:38:56,533 --> 01:38:58,063
Arctic, you aren't from Seoul.

2291
01:38:58,233 --> 01:38:59,873
(Arctic was born in Thailand.)

2292
01:39:00,003 --> 01:39:02,533
Please come, Arctic.

2293
01:39:02,833 --> 01:39:04,473
It could be Hyun Jun.

2294
01:39:05,073 --> 01:39:06,202
I'm from Changwon.

2295
01:39:06,203 --> 01:39:07,412
(Jung Hyun Jun is from Changwon.)

2296
01:39:07,413 --> 01:39:08,513
Isn't it Tae Jo?

2297
01:39:08,713 --> 01:39:10,142
Right, there's Tae Jo.

2298
01:39:10,143 --> 01:39:13,183
(Kim Tae Jo is from Daejeon.)

2299
01:39:13,553 --> 01:39:16,083
Who placed 41st?

2300
01:39:19,923 --> 01:39:22,192
It's Jung Hyun Jun.

2301
01:39:22,193 --> 01:39:26,862
(Jung Hyun Jun survives in 41st place.)

2302
01:39:26,863 --> 01:39:28,493
My goodness.

2303
01:39:29,063 --> 01:39:30,533
Hyun Jun.

2304
01:39:30,663 --> 01:39:31,803
He's good.

2305
01:39:32,633 --> 01:39:34,133
Congratulations on your survival.

2306
01:39:35,003 --> 01:39:38,242
Star Creators who support me,

2307
01:39:38,243 --> 01:39:40,772
I'd like to thank you...

2308
01:39:40,773 --> 01:39:43,413
for giving me another chance to perform on stage.

2309
01:39:43,783 --> 01:39:45,443
I moved up a lot,

2310
01:39:46,113 --> 01:39:48,682
but my dream is at a higher place.

2311
01:39:48,683 --> 01:39:51,052
I will work harder.

2312
01:39:51,053 --> 01:39:52,123
Thank you.

2313
01:39:53,753 --> 01:39:54,853
That's amazing.

2314
01:39:55,523 --> 01:39:57,792
Star Creators around the world.

2315
01:39:57,793 --> 01:39:58,992
Thank you.

2316
01:39:58,993 --> 01:40:01,892
Thank you for watching the show.

2317
01:40:01,893 --> 01:40:06,502
Thank you so much for your continuing support.

2318
01:40:06,503 --> 01:40:09,673
Without you guys, I wouldn't be here. Thank you very much.

2319
01:40:11,043 --> 01:40:12,173
That's great.

2320
01:40:14,373 --> 01:40:17,313
Surviving participants, congratulations again.

2321
01:40:18,083 --> 01:40:21,283
Please go to your seat according to your ranking.

2322
01:40:23,283 --> 01:40:24,723
What we did was so dramatic.

2323
01:40:27,493 --> 01:40:29,653
We finally made it.

2324
01:40:30,693 --> 01:40:33,092
The ranks that can survive...

2325
01:40:33,093 --> 01:40:36,763
in Team Plot Twist, excluding the 10 candidates for Top 8...

2326
01:40:36,903 --> 01:40:38,503
and 48th place candidate,

2327
01:40:38,803 --> 01:40:43,033
are 42nd and 45th places.

2328
01:40:43,273 --> 01:40:46,042
(39th, Kim Tae Jo, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2329
01:40:46,043 --> 01:40:47,973
(67th, No Hui Jun, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2330
01:40:48,373 --> 01:40:50,843
In Team Plot Twist,

2331
01:40:51,043 --> 01:40:52,643
more survivors...

2332
01:40:53,383 --> 01:40:54,483
I think there will be more.

2333
01:40:54,853 --> 01:40:55,953
There has to be.

2334
01:40:56,683 --> 01:40:57,683
Please.

2335
01:40:58,383 --> 01:41:00,723
(71st, Kim Dong Hyun B, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2336
01:41:01,893 --> 01:41:04,023
exist.

2337
01:41:08,933 --> 01:41:11,833
Next is the 42nd place.

2338
01:41:12,363 --> 01:41:13,633
Come, Arctic.

2339
01:41:13,903 --> 01:41:14,973
Dong Hyun.

2340
01:41:15,903 --> 01:41:17,073
You can do it.

2341
01:41:17,643 --> 01:41:18,703
Tae Jo has a chance.

2342
01:41:19,913 --> 01:41:22,443
The birthday of the participant in 42nd place...

2343
01:41:22,673 --> 01:41:24,313
has one digit.

2344
01:41:24,443 --> 01:41:26,113
Don't we all have one digit?

2345
01:41:26,183 --> 01:41:27,512
It's not higher than ten.

2346
01:41:27,513 --> 01:41:29,183
It's between 1st and 9th.

2347
01:41:29,883 --> 01:41:30,952
Mine has two digits.

2348
01:41:30,953 --> 01:41:32,022
(December 14, 2008)

2349
01:41:32,023 --> 01:41:33,182
Mine are also two digits.

2350
01:41:33,183 --> 01:41:34,192
(June 17, 2004)

2351
01:41:34,193 --> 01:41:35,793
It's not Arctic.

2352
01:41:35,853 --> 01:41:37,062
(Arctic isn't a candidate.)

2353
01:41:37,063 --> 01:41:38,123
It's not Arctic.

2354
01:41:38,723 --> 01:41:40,232
Participants whose birthday has one digit,

2355
01:41:40,233 --> 01:41:41,763
could you raise your hands?

2356
01:41:42,363 --> 01:41:44,903
(Team 1: Kim Tae Jo and Noh Hui Jun)

2357
01:41:45,003 --> 01:41:47,272
(Team 2: Arctic?)

2358
01:41:47,273 --> 01:41:50,073
(October 9, 2008)

2359
01:41:52,403 --> 01:41:53,873
What are you doing, Dong Gyu?

2360
01:41:54,273 --> 01:41:55,412
We have three participants.

2361
01:41:55,413 --> 01:41:56,943
You should leave IST.

2362
01:41:58,243 --> 01:41:59,282
His birthday had one digit?

2363
01:41:59,283 --> 01:42:00,782
I will announce the participant who was chosen by Star Creators...

2364
01:42:00,783 --> 01:42:04,122
to be in 42nd place and survived.

2365
01:42:04,123 --> 01:42:05,843
(67th, Noh Hui Jun, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2366
01:42:05,923 --> 01:42:07,922
The person in 42nd place...

2367
01:42:07,923 --> 01:42:09,443
(50th, Arctic, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2368
01:42:10,263 --> 01:42:12,623
is Kim Tae Jo.

2369
01:42:13,163 --> 01:42:14,393
It's done.

2370
01:42:15,663 --> 01:42:16,733
Tae Jo.

2371
01:42:17,203 --> 01:42:18,263
Well done.

2372
01:42:18,463 --> 01:42:20,073
His legs are weak.

2373
01:42:20,273 --> 01:42:21,432
Kim Tae Jo.

2374
01:42:21,433 --> 01:42:22,573
Yes.

2375
01:42:24,203 --> 01:42:25,403
Goodness.

2376
01:42:26,173 --> 01:42:27,472
Participant Kim Tae Jo...

2377
01:42:27,473 --> 01:42:29,913
is usually like a child,

2378
01:42:30,083 --> 01:42:31,813
but once he stands on the stage,

2379
01:42:31,843 --> 01:42:33,413
his eyes change.

2380
01:42:34,183 --> 01:42:35,813
Congratulations on surviving.

2381
01:42:38,223 --> 01:42:39,253
It's okay.

2382
01:42:40,453 --> 01:42:41,523
It's okay.

2383
01:42:42,253 --> 01:42:44,763
Please come, Arctic.

2384
01:42:45,093 --> 01:42:47,332
The participant in 42nd place was announced.

2385
01:42:47,333 --> 01:42:50,162
The only rank that can survive...

2386
01:42:50,163 --> 01:42:51,662
in Team Plot Twist...

2387
01:42:51,663 --> 01:42:55,203
is 45th place.

2388
01:42:56,003 --> 01:42:59,643
In Team Plot Twist, more survivors...

2389
01:43:00,313 --> 01:43:02,113
Exist.

2390
01:43:02,373 --> 01:43:04,513
Exist.

2391
01:43:05,913 --> 01:43:07,553
Exist.

2392
01:43:11,183 --> 01:43:12,183
Exist.

2393
01:43:14,423 --> 01:43:15,799
They also have the 45th participant?

2394
01:43:15,823 --> 01:43:16,863
That's amazing.

2395
01:43:17,293 --> 01:43:18,893
The participant in 45th place...

2396
01:43:19,093 --> 01:43:22,133
was an elimination candidate in the Week 3 Interim Ranking.

2397
01:43:22,633 --> 01:43:23,763
It's Arctic.

2398
01:43:24,463 --> 01:43:25,663
Please.

2399
01:43:25,833 --> 01:43:27,532
Hui Jun also has a chance.

2400
01:43:27,533 --> 01:43:29,172
It would be amazing if Hui Jun survives.

2401
01:43:29,173 --> 01:43:30,403
It would be amazing.

2402
01:43:30,773 --> 01:43:31,803
Dong Hyun B?

2403
01:43:32,673 --> 01:43:33,713
Dong Hyun.

2404
01:43:34,013 --> 01:43:36,613
(They send each other encouraging looks.)

2405
01:43:37,243 --> 01:43:38,482
I don't know about this.

2406
01:43:38,483 --> 01:43:39,542
(74th Hong Zhi Han, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2407
01:43:39,543 --> 01:43:41,352
I will announce the participant in 45th place...

2408
01:43:41,353 --> 01:43:43,283
who survived in the global voting.

2409
01:43:43,653 --> 01:43:45,652
The participant in 45th place who survived...

2410
01:43:45,653 --> 01:43:47,252
by the love of the Star Creators...

2411
01:43:47,253 --> 01:43:49,222
(67th, Noh Hui Jun, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2412
01:43:49,223 --> 01:43:51,363
(71st, Kim Dong Hyun B, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2413
01:43:52,293 --> 01:43:54,392
is Arctic.

2414
01:43:54,393 --> 01:43:59,103
(45th, survivor Arctic)

2415
01:43:59,363 --> 01:44:00,473
Arctic.

2416
01:44:01,733 --> 01:44:06,773
(Park Dong Gyu is relieved to hear Arctic's survival.)

2417
01:44:08,173 --> 01:44:11,743
If Arctic hadn't received the benefit,

2418
01:44:11,943 --> 01:44:14,083
he would have been in 55th place,

2419
01:44:14,153 --> 01:44:16,253
and would have had to leave BOYS II PLANET.

2420
01:44:16,583 --> 01:44:18,482
The benefit points served a great role.

2421
01:44:18,483 --> 01:44:19,699
(1st round voting score: 142,926 2nd round Korea vote count: 23,593)

2422
01:44:19,723 --> 01:44:21,222
The 300,000 points were significant.

2423
01:44:21,223 --> 01:44:22,793
It's significant.

2424
01:44:22,953 --> 01:44:25,063
Did you expect your name to be called at the end...

2425
01:44:25,093 --> 01:44:27,963
for the 45th place?

2426
01:44:28,363 --> 01:44:30,133
I never imagined it would be so.

2427
01:44:30,403 --> 01:44:34,703
I'm really thankful...

2428
01:44:34,803 --> 01:44:37,203
my ranking increased to 45th.

2429
01:44:39,203 --> 01:44:40,613
Well done, Arctic.

2430
01:44:42,073 --> 01:44:44,442
(The participants whose names weren't called...)

2431
01:44:44,443 --> 01:44:46,813
(return to their seats.)

2432
01:44:47,413 --> 01:44:50,453
I feel like a mother...

2433
01:44:50,683 --> 01:44:52,853
whose sons have gotten married.

2434
01:44:54,093 --> 01:44:55,323
That's how it feels.

2435
01:44:57,493 --> 01:44:58,723
It's a bit sad.

2436
01:45:01,573 --> 01:45:03,602
The last team whose survivors will be announced...

2437
01:45:03,603 --> 01:45:06,143
in the First Survivor Announcement...

2438
01:45:06,743 --> 01:45:08,212
is Team Whiplash.

2439
01:45:08,213 --> 01:45:10,683
- Let's go, Whiplash. - Let's go, Whiplash.

2440
01:45:11,043 --> 01:45:12,242
It's finally here.

2441
01:45:12,243 --> 01:45:13,753
(Sighing)

2442
01:45:13,798 --> 01:45:14,898
We've waited a long time.

2443
01:45:15,228 --> 01:45:16,838
They're strong.

2444
01:45:17,038 --> 01:45:18,868
They're all strong.

2445
01:45:19,298 --> 01:45:20,614
(2nd, Zhou An Xin, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2446
01:45:20,638 --> 01:45:23,108
(Whiplash Team 1 consisted of the top participants.)

2447
01:45:23,168 --> 01:45:26,308
Whiplash Team 1 was called the Avengers...

2448
01:45:26,578 --> 01:45:28,707
and earned a special benefit.

2449
01:45:28,708 --> 01:45:30,054
(Voted 1st as the performance people wanted to watch again)

2450
01:45:30,078 --> 01:45:32,077
(Team 2 performed against Team 1)

2451
01:45:32,078 --> 01:45:34,748
(the All Star Avengers)

2452
01:45:34,918 --> 01:45:36,957
(Team 2 showed the miracle of the 1 Stars...)

2453
01:45:36,958 --> 01:45:39,358
(with a score of 4 to 4, a tie.)

2454
01:45:39,418 --> 01:45:41,688
(The miracle of the 1 Stars)

2455
01:45:41,788 --> 01:45:45,198
(Who will survive in Team Whiplash?)

2456
01:45:45,358 --> 01:45:47,628
The first survivor of Team Whiplash.

2457
01:45:47,998 --> 01:45:49,298
This person...

2458
01:45:51,068 --> 01:45:52,898
is in 13th place.

2459
01:45:53,508 --> 01:45:55,338
(Survivor of Team Whiplash, 13th place)

2460
01:45:55,608 --> 01:45:56,738
That's high.

2461
01:45:56,938 --> 01:45:58,277
Ching Yu or Geon Woo.

2462
01:45:58,278 --> 01:45:59,307
(13th, Hsu Ching Yu, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2463
01:45:59,308 --> 01:46:00,408
Fan Zhe Yi?

2464
01:46:01,348 --> 01:46:02,908
The participant in 13th place...

2465
01:46:02,948 --> 01:46:04,748
was placed in the All Star Class...

2466
01:46:04,948 --> 01:46:06,518
in the Class Placement Match.

2467
01:46:07,288 --> 01:46:09,218
Weren't they all placed in the All Star Class?

2468
01:46:09,488 --> 01:46:11,358
Not Jun Seo and Yumeki.

2469
01:46:11,688 --> 01:46:14,058
- In PLANET C, Fan Zhe Yi... - That's right.

2470
01:46:14,188 --> 01:46:15,387
Fan Zhe Yi, Peng Jin Yu, and Sun Jia Yang.

2471
01:46:15,388 --> 01:46:16,664
They were in the All Star Class.

2472
01:46:16,688 --> 01:46:18,504
(During the Class Placement Match of PLANET C)

2473
01:46:18,528 --> 01:46:25,598
(Fan Zhe Yi, Peng Jin Yu, and Sun Jia Yang received All Stars.)

2474
01:46:25,798 --> 01:46:26,838
So many.

2475
01:46:27,738 --> 01:46:30,878
Between PLANET K and PLANET C,

2476
01:46:31,178 --> 01:46:32,508
- K? - C?

2477
01:46:33,278 --> 01:46:34,384
The participant is from PLANET C.

2478
01:46:34,408 --> 01:46:36,107
- It's Fan Zhe Yi. - It's Fan Zhe Yi.

2479
01:46:36,108 --> 01:46:37,818
It could be Sun Jia Yang.

2480
01:46:38,018 --> 01:46:39,278
Among us three?

2481
01:46:41,918 --> 01:46:44,658
(The three participants are holding hands.)

2482
01:46:44,818 --> 01:46:47,188
The All Star participant in 13th place...

2483
01:46:49,158 --> 01:46:50,427
is Fan Zhe Yi.

2484
01:46:50,428 --> 01:46:53,498
(Fan Zhe Yi survives in 13th place.)

2485
01:46:53,598 --> 01:46:55,098
That's really high.

2486
01:46:55,398 --> 01:46:57,368
Fan Zhe Yi is loved by the Star Creators...

2487
01:46:57,468 --> 01:47:00,567
with his tall height and charming air.

2488
01:47:00,568 --> 01:47:02,007
Congratulations on surviving.

2489
01:47:02,008 --> 01:47:05,138
(Fan Zhe Yi, 13th, 3,775,085 points)

2490
01:47:05,308 --> 01:47:07,507
It would be nice if they described me...

2491
01:47:07,508 --> 01:47:09,377
to have a charming air.

2492
01:47:09,378 --> 01:47:11,178
(Laughing)

2493
01:47:11,448 --> 01:47:13,648
The next survivor of Team Whiplash...

2494
01:47:14,748 --> 01:47:16,288
is in 14th place.

2495
01:47:16,548 --> 01:47:19,218
(Survivor of Team Whiplash, 14th place)

2496
01:47:19,418 --> 01:47:22,187
It's 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th.

2497
01:47:22,188 --> 01:47:23,597
They'll be announced in a row.

2498
01:47:23,598 --> 01:47:25,398
Last week, it was Yumeki.

2499
01:47:25,658 --> 01:47:26,658
Geon Woo?

2500
01:47:26,659 --> 01:47:27,927
(17th, Kim Geon Woo, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2501
01:47:27,928 --> 01:47:29,868
The participant in 14th place...

2502
01:47:29,898 --> 01:47:33,608
is short and precious.

2503
01:47:33,668 --> 01:47:35,708
- Sun Jia Yang. - It's going to be Sun Jia Yang

2504
01:47:36,408 --> 01:47:37,437
Jia Yang.

2505
01:47:37,438 --> 01:47:38,438
(Born in 2006 and 2010)

2506
01:47:38,439 --> 01:47:39,838
It could be Yumeki too.

2507
01:47:40,038 --> 01:47:42,048
Yumeki is short and precious too.

2508
01:47:42,308 --> 01:47:44,047
He also left a strong impression...

2509
01:47:44,048 --> 01:47:47,418
with his dance.

2510
01:47:47,648 --> 01:47:49,148
Did I dance?

2511
01:47:49,848 --> 01:47:50,988
Yumeki?

2512
01:47:51,658 --> 01:47:54,628
(Yumeki left a strong impression by dancing.)

2513
01:47:54,758 --> 01:47:57,197
Ching Yu also dances well.

2514
01:47:57,198 --> 01:47:58,628
I think it's Ching Yu.

2515
01:47:59,228 --> 01:48:00,597
(His dancing skills grabbed people's attention...)

2516
01:48:00,598 --> 01:48:01,998
(during the Class Placement Match.)

2517
01:48:02,668 --> 01:48:05,598
(He was the main dancer in "HOLA SOLAR," the signal song.)

2518
01:48:06,198 --> 01:48:07,768
- I think it's Ching Yu. - Yumeki?

2519
01:48:08,008 --> 01:48:11,038
(Who will be the survivor in 14th place?)

2520
01:48:11,208 --> 01:48:12,738
The survivor in 14th place...

2521
01:48:14,678 --> 01:48:17,017
is Hsu Ching Yu.

2522
01:48:17,018 --> 01:48:20,148
(Hsu Ching Yu survives in 14th place.)

2523
01:48:20,318 --> 01:48:22,118
His ranking is very high.

2524
01:48:22,348 --> 01:48:24,918
Congratulations, Ching Yu.

2525
01:48:25,288 --> 01:48:26,758
Ching Yu dances well.

2526
01:48:28,128 --> 01:48:30,327
- Well done. - Very good.

2527
01:48:30,328 --> 01:48:32,198
(Hsu Ching Yu, 14th, 3,717,670 points)

2528
01:48:32,328 --> 01:48:34,768
The next survivor from Team Whiplash...

2529
01:48:34,928 --> 01:48:36,197
In 15th place.

2530
01:48:36,198 --> 01:48:37,568
Is in 15th place.

2531
01:48:37,768 --> 01:48:38,897
(Survivor of Team Whiplash, 15th place)

2532
01:48:38,898 --> 01:48:40,638
They're going in order.

2533
01:48:41,038 --> 01:48:42,138
Is it Sun Jia Yang?

2534
01:48:42,338 --> 01:48:43,367
Sun Jia Yang.

2535
01:48:43,368 --> 01:48:44,477
Jia Yang.

2536
01:48:44,478 --> 01:48:45,784
(Will it be Sun Jia Yang in 12th place?)

2537
01:48:45,808 --> 01:48:47,378
I think it's Yumeki.

2538
01:48:47,948 --> 01:48:49,377
The participant in 15th place.

2539
01:48:49,378 --> 01:48:52,018
His height, according to the profile,

2540
01:48:52,948 --> 01:48:56,088
is 172cm.

2541
01:48:56,388 --> 01:48:58,488
Wasn't his height around 160 cm?

2542
01:48:59,558 --> 01:49:01,078
He could have written a taller height.

2543
01:49:01,388 --> 01:49:03,428
He can't be 172cm tall.

2544
01:49:05,058 --> 01:49:06,228
Is that you?

2545
01:49:07,298 --> 01:49:08,768
Maybe?

2546
01:49:08,998 --> 01:49:11,768
(Is Sun Jia Yang the survivor in 15th place?)

2547
01:49:11,968 --> 01:49:13,838
That's the same height in Kang Min's profile.

2548
01:49:13,938 --> 01:49:15,837
That's my real height.

2549
01:49:15,838 --> 01:49:17,338
- It's Yumeki. - Yumeki?

2550
01:49:18,178 --> 01:49:19,877
How tall are you, Yumeki?

2551
01:49:19,878 --> 01:49:20,878
I'm 172cm.

2552
01:49:21,078 --> 01:49:23,207
Isn't that you?

2553
01:49:23,208 --> 01:49:24,778
The survivor in 15th place...

2554
01:49:25,678 --> 01:49:26,748
Yumeki?

2555
01:49:26,848 --> 01:49:28,217
Is Sun Jia Yang.

2556
01:49:28,218 --> 01:49:29,647
(Sun Jia Yang survives in 15th place.)

2557
01:49:29,648 --> 01:49:30,758
Congratulations.

2558
01:49:33,588 --> 01:49:35,158
When did he become 172cm?

2559
01:49:35,288 --> 01:49:37,158
He put a taller height.

2560
01:49:37,658 --> 01:49:38,927
You lied.

2561
01:49:38,928 --> 01:49:42,368
I accept your ranking, but lying is a crime!

2562
01:49:42,598 --> 01:49:44,168
As long as he's cute.

2563
01:49:44,868 --> 01:49:47,767
I know...

2564
01:49:47,768 --> 01:49:50,037
that I have a cute boyish image...

2565
01:49:50,038 --> 01:49:52,137
to the fans.

2566
01:49:52,138 --> 01:49:54,947
But from now on, I'd like to show them...

2567
01:49:54,948 --> 01:49:59,048
a more mature and cool side of me.

2568
01:49:59,518 --> 01:50:01,818
Please cheer for me.

2569
01:50:02,148 --> 01:50:03,688
(Winking)

2570
01:50:04,658 --> 01:50:05,688
Cute.

2571
01:50:06,388 --> 01:50:08,288
Even his name is Jia Yang. He's so cute.

2572
01:50:10,898 --> 01:50:13,868
The next survivor from Team Whiplash...

2573
01:50:14,098 --> 01:50:15,797
(22nd, Peng Jin Yu, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2574
01:50:15,798 --> 01:50:18,468
(17th, Kim Geon Woo, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2575
01:50:18,768 --> 01:50:20,067
This is driving me crazy.

2576
01:50:20,068 --> 01:50:21,828
(31st, Kim Jae Hyun, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2577
01:50:23,068 --> 01:50:24,538
is in 16th place.

2578
01:50:24,708 --> 01:50:26,038
(16th place)

2579
01:50:26,278 --> 01:50:27,808
They're going in order.

2580
01:50:28,448 --> 01:50:30,568
(Those seats will be taken by Team Whiplash members.)

2581
01:50:31,078 --> 01:50:32,594
I think he's the center of BOYS II PLANET K.

2582
01:50:32,618 --> 01:50:34,548
I think he ranked 17th before.

2583
01:50:35,088 --> 01:50:37,018
I think Geon Woo must've made it.

2584
01:50:37,558 --> 01:50:38,818
Geon Woo or Yumeki.

2585
01:50:39,558 --> 01:50:40,918
The participant who ranked 16th...

2586
01:50:41,088 --> 01:50:43,928
received a Win...

2587
01:50:44,498 --> 01:50:46,138
in the 1-on-1 Class Battle interim check.

2588
01:50:46,458 --> 01:50:47,898
That means it's not from our team.

2589
01:50:48,328 --> 01:50:49,628
All of Team One received it.

2590
01:50:50,168 --> 01:50:51,968
- It's one of... - It must be one of us.

2591
01:50:52,838 --> 01:50:54,667
(While checking the result of the interim check...)

2592
01:50:54,668 --> 01:50:55,967
(They all won.)

2593
01:50:55,968 --> 01:50:57,907
(Gosh, they all won.)

2594
01:50:57,908 --> 01:51:01,378
(Against Team 2, everyone in "Whiplash" Team 1 had won.)

2595
01:51:01,478 --> 01:51:02,877
They all won.

2596
01:51:02,878 --> 01:51:04,217
(Who's the survivor from "Whiplash" Team 1 ranking 16th?)

2597
01:51:04,218 --> 01:51:05,948
- Is it Geon Woo? - Yumeki?

2598
01:51:06,118 --> 01:51:07,487
It has to be one of them.

2599
01:51:07,488 --> 01:51:08,994
(17th, Kim Geon Woo, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2600
01:51:09,018 --> 01:51:10,188
I don't know now.

2601
01:51:10,788 --> 01:51:11,858
Who could it be?

2602
01:51:13,288 --> 01:51:15,488
The occupant of the 16th-place survival seat is…

2603
01:51:17,658 --> 01:51:18,758
Geon Woo?

2604
01:51:19,298 --> 01:51:20,328
Yumeki?

2605
01:51:21,968 --> 01:51:23,068
It's Kim Geon Woo.

2606
01:51:23,328 --> 01:51:25,737
(The 16th-place survivor is Kim Geon Woo of Team 1.)

2607
01:51:25,738 --> 01:51:26,768
- Well done. - Well done.

2608
01:51:27,308 --> 01:51:28,408
Well done.

2609
01:51:31,008 --> 01:51:33,238
Every participant must be the same.

2610
01:51:33,808 --> 01:51:36,508
But I am desperate to make a debut...

2611
01:51:37,448 --> 01:51:38,577
through this program.

2612
01:51:38,578 --> 01:51:39,877
I will do my very best every moment...

2613
01:51:39,878 --> 01:51:42,488
so I can continue to move up. Thank you.

2614
01:51:43,488 --> 01:51:44,558
Let's go up.

2615
01:51:45,288 --> 01:51:46,518
- Congratulations. - Thanks.

2616
01:51:46,718 --> 01:51:47,788
Geon Woo.

2617
01:51:48,258 --> 01:51:50,997
(The participants congratulate him sincerely as he goes to his seat.)

2618
01:51:50,998 --> 01:51:52,028
Congratulations.

2619
01:51:57,238 --> 01:51:58,467
(Exclaiming)

2620
01:51:58,468 --> 01:51:59,538
So high.

2621
01:52:00,198 --> 01:52:02,207
(Team "Whiplash" members...)

2622
01:52:02,208 --> 01:52:04,308
(filled four All-Star seats.)

2623
01:52:04,578 --> 01:52:06,078
Which seats are left?

2624
01:52:06,408 --> 01:52:07,548
Three seats are left.

2625
01:52:07,778 --> 01:52:09,877
That's so little.

2626
01:52:09,878 --> 01:52:11,248
(Only three seats remain now.)

2627
01:52:11,518 --> 01:52:13,117
It's 17th, 28th, and 33rd.

2628
01:52:13,118 --> 01:52:14,287
(All Star 17th, 2 Star 28th, and 2 Star 33rd)

(53rd, Kim Daniel, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2630
01:52:16,948 --> 01:52:18,088
I want to go up.

2631
01:52:19,288 --> 01:52:20,488
I have no clue.

2632
01:52:21,028 --> 01:52:22,628
The rank of this survivor...

2633
01:52:23,588 --> 01:52:25,198
is 17th.

2634
01:52:25,958 --> 01:52:27,598
("Whiplash" by aespa, Survivor 17th)

2635
01:52:27,728 --> 01:52:29,168
The 17th-place participant...

2636
01:52:29,268 --> 01:52:32,668
was in charge of rapping in the "Whiplash" performance.

2637
01:52:33,038 --> 01:52:35,638
- Yumeki. - I think Yumeki will make it.

2638
01:52:36,438 --> 01:52:39,678
(Yumeki was Sub-rapper 3 in "Whiplash" Team 1.)

2639
01:52:40,408 --> 01:52:41,478
Is it Peng Jin Yu?

2640
01:52:41,608 --> 01:52:44,578
(Peng Jin Yu was Sub-rapper 1 in "Whiplash" Team 2.)

2641
01:52:45,078 --> 01:52:46,548
I have no idea who it is.

(14th, Yumeki, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2643
01:52:49,488 --> 01:52:50,658
The 17th-place survivor is..

2644
01:52:51,358 --> 01:52:53,118
- Yumeki. - Peng Jin Yu.

2645
01:52:56,228 --> 01:52:57,458
It's Yumeki.

2646
01:52:57,998 --> 01:52:59,028
Thank you.

2647
01:52:59,128 --> 01:53:00,628
- Well done. - You did really well.

2648
01:53:02,298 --> 01:53:05,768
He's the one who made "Whiplash" Team One.

2649
01:53:06,098 --> 01:53:07,668
Congratulations on your survival.

2650
01:53:08,638 --> 01:53:10,138
Good job, Yumeki.

2651
01:53:10,508 --> 01:53:14,778
I want to thank the Star Creators...

2652
01:53:14,978 --> 01:53:16,678
for supporting my new challenge.

2653
01:53:17,048 --> 01:53:19,047
I will do my best so I can repay you.

2654
01:53:19,048 --> 01:53:20,118
Thank you.

2655
01:53:20,378 --> 01:53:21,818
Go, Yumeki!

2656
01:53:23,688 --> 01:53:24,888
Two seats left.

2657
01:53:27,788 --> 01:53:29,928
The rank of the next survivor...

2658
01:53:30,228 --> 01:53:31,698
is 28th.

2659
01:53:32,128 --> 01:53:33,827
("Whiplash" by aespa, Survivor 28th)

2660
01:53:33,828 --> 01:53:36,027
Who's going to rank 28th?

2661
01:53:36,028 --> 01:53:37,998
Jae Hyun's ranking was higher.

2662
01:53:38,638 --> 01:53:41,068
Kim Jae Hyun!

2663
01:53:41,308 --> 01:53:45,278
The 28th-place participant's birthday has already passed.

2664
01:53:46,108 --> 01:53:47,208
Is it Jae Hyun?

2665
01:53:47,448 --> 01:53:48,508
Did his birthday pass?

2666
01:53:48,848 --> 01:53:51,118
I don't know his birthday. I forgot.

2667
01:53:52,118 --> 01:53:53,618
People will talk about this.

2668
01:53:54,788 --> 01:53:56,047
Whose birthday passed?

2669
01:53:56,048 --> 01:53:57,587
- Jae Hyun's passed. - He's passed?

2670
01:53:57,588 --> 01:53:58,817
Peng Jin Yu's passed too.

2671
01:53:58,818 --> 01:54:00,057
Both of their birthdays passed.

2672
01:54:00,058 --> 01:54:02,427
(Kim Jae Hyun was born in January.)

2673
01:54:02,428 --> 01:54:04,728
(Peng Jin Yu was born in March.)

2674
01:54:04,958 --> 01:54:06,627
The 28th-place survivor is...

2675
01:54:06,628 --> 01:54:08,497
(22th, Peng Jin Yu, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2676
01:54:08,498 --> 01:54:10,328
(31st, Kim Jae Hyun, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2677
01:54:11,838 --> 01:54:13,138
It's Peng Jin Yu.

2678
01:54:13,908 --> 01:54:15,767
(28th-place survivor is Peng Jin Yu of Team 2.)

2679
01:54:15,768 --> 01:54:16,868
- Well done. - Well done.

2680
01:54:18,108 --> 01:54:19,577
Congratulations on your survival.

2681
01:54:19,578 --> 01:54:21,678
(28th, Peng Jin Yu)

2682
01:54:22,008 --> 01:54:24,117
Now, only one person...

2683
01:54:24,118 --> 01:54:27,487
from Team "Whiplash" can survive.

2684
01:54:27,488 --> 01:54:29,624
(8th, 9th, 10th, 47th, 48th-place participants are excluded.)

2685
01:54:29,648 --> 01:54:31,817
(The remaining seat belongs to the 33rd-place survivor.)

2686
01:54:31,818 --> 01:54:33,187
(31st, Kim Jae Hyun, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2687
01:54:33,188 --> 01:54:35,028
- No. - It's you.

2688
01:54:35,688 --> 01:54:39,157
(53rd, Kim Daniel, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2689
01:54:39,158 --> 01:54:41,068
(57th, Rensho, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2690
01:54:41,328 --> 01:54:42,528
Now just one seat is left.

2691
01:54:42,798 --> 01:54:44,268
Who's going to sit on that chair?

2692
01:54:45,338 --> 01:54:48,507
(31st, Kim Jae Hyun, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2693
01:54:48,508 --> 01:54:51,337
(Kim Jae Hyun signed up for BOYS PLANET K with Na Yun Seo, )

2694
01:54:51,338 --> 01:54:53,638
(the same-age friend.)

2695
01:54:54,108 --> 01:54:55,208
Please.

2696
01:54:56,248 --> 01:54:57,718
Will Daniel survive?

2697
01:54:59,078 --> 01:55:02,017
(Kim Daniel perfectly handled the killing part.)

2698
01:55:02,018 --> 01:55:03,917
(He not only captured the hearts of the Star Creators on site...)

2699
01:55:03,918 --> 01:55:05,918
(but also the heart of the master.)

2700
01:55:06,258 --> 01:55:07,558
Oh, my gosh.

2701
01:55:08,028 --> 01:55:10,087
Among eight participants of Team "Whiplash,"

2702
01:55:10,088 --> 01:55:11,728
waiting for the result,

2703
01:55:11,928 --> 01:55:14,898
this 33rd-place survivor will be called out last.

2704
01:55:15,728 --> 01:55:16,728
(53rd, Kim Daniel, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2705
01:55:16,729 --> 01:55:18,497
(Who will be the 33rd-place survivor?)

2706
01:55:18,498 --> 01:55:20,258
(31st, Kim Jae Hyun, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2707
01:55:20,468 --> 01:55:21,508
Kim.

2708
01:55:22,008 --> 01:55:24,508
- Kim Jae Hyun? - Kim Daniel?

2709
01:55:27,178 --> 01:55:28,308
It's Jae Hyun.

2710
01:55:28,448 --> 01:55:30,977
(33rd-place survivor Kim Jae Hyun of Team 2)

2711
01:55:30,978 --> 01:55:31,978
Congratulations.

2712
01:55:34,048 --> 01:55:36,547
He's the official tough guy of BOYS II PLANET...

2713
01:55:36,548 --> 01:55:38,064
with an honest, effortlessly cool charm.

2714
01:55:38,088 --> 01:55:40,558
Congratulations on your survival, Jae Hyun.

2715
01:55:43,588 --> 01:55:47,058
My only friends were from the agency.

2716
01:55:47,598 --> 01:55:51,368
I'm very happy to have come to a new place...

2717
01:55:51,698 --> 01:55:54,368
and to have met good friends.

2718
01:55:54,638 --> 01:55:56,538
You are not eliminated yet,

2719
01:55:56,768 --> 01:55:58,778
so I really hope you will come up.

2720
01:55:59,208 --> 01:56:00,278
Thank you.

2721
01:56:01,548 --> 01:56:02,578
Cheers.

2722
01:56:05,478 --> 01:56:08,747
The 1st Survivor Announcement. Now the remaining are...

2723
01:56:08,748 --> 01:56:10,657
(The remaining seats are Top 8...)

2724
01:56:10,658 --> 01:56:14,928
Top 8, 47, and 48 participants.

2725
01:56:15,828 --> 01:56:18,298
Who would've ranked 48th?

2726
01:56:18,998 --> 01:56:20,998
Will they reveal the 47th place first?

2727
01:56:21,328 --> 01:56:24,438
Among 15 participants waiting for the announcement,

2728
01:56:24,798 --> 01:56:27,607
who will be the 12 participants that will continue...

2729
01:56:27,608 --> 01:56:29,268
the challenge on BOYS II PLANET?

2730
01:56:29,768 --> 01:56:32,138
And who will be the first one...

2731
01:56:32,438 --> 01:56:35,108
to be sitting on the Top Eight seat?

2732
01:56:35,578 --> 01:56:37,748
I will continue the announcement.

2733
01:56:38,778 --> 01:56:39,848
Let's go.

2734
01:56:43,818 --> 01:56:46,518
I will first reveal three contestants...

2735
01:56:46,918 --> 01:56:48,758
of Top Eight.

2736
01:56:50,228 --> 01:56:51,388
The contestants of Top Eight.

2737
01:56:51,598 --> 01:56:52,697
(PLANET Top 8 Contestants)

2738
01:56:52,698 --> 01:56:53,758
Who would it be?

2739
01:56:54,028 --> 01:56:56,328
- Sato. - Masato?

2740
01:56:56,928 --> 01:56:58,068
He Xin Long.

2741
01:56:58,338 --> 01:56:59,498
Who would it be?

2742
01:56:59,868 --> 01:57:01,067
(9th, Kang Woo Jin, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2743
01:57:01,068 --> 01:57:05,138
Let's find out whose name is on the Top Eight contestant list.

2744
01:57:06,008 --> 01:57:07,948
I will reveal the contestant.

2745
01:57:08,948 --> 01:57:10,918
Who is it going to be?

2746
01:57:13,118 --> 01:57:14,318
No way.

2747
01:57:16,688 --> 01:57:18,187
(Top 8 contestants)

2748
01:57:18,188 --> 01:57:20,788
(He Xin Long, Kang Woo Jin, Masato)

2749
01:57:24,258 --> 01:57:26,358
Xin Long keeps going up.

2750
01:57:26,898 --> 01:57:29,198
They are the contestants of Top Eight.

2751
01:57:29,628 --> 01:57:33,638
Among these 3 candidates, one will claim the 1st Top 8 seat...

2752
01:57:33,798 --> 01:57:35,237
chosen by Star Creators,

2753
01:57:35,238 --> 01:57:38,007
ranking eighth in the global vote.

2754
01:57:38,008 --> 01:57:39,488
(8th, Masato, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2755
01:57:39,538 --> 01:57:40,638
I envy them.

2756
01:57:41,308 --> 01:57:45,318
First, I will announce the tenth participant.

2757
01:57:46,618 --> 01:57:48,848
- Who do you think it is? - I have no idea.

2758
01:57:49,318 --> 01:57:54,728
This participant received 4,965,995 points.

2759
01:57:56,058 --> 01:57:57,188
It's another scale.

2760
01:57:57,328 --> 01:57:58,604
He received four million points.

2761
01:57:58,628 --> 01:58:00,458
- I'm nervous. - I'm nervous too.

2762
01:58:01,498 --> 01:58:03,444
The tenth place participant steadily climbed the ranks...

2763
01:58:03,468 --> 01:58:06,138
and secured a spot in the top tier.

2764
01:58:06,738 --> 01:58:07,967
Sato must be in Top Ten.

2765
01:58:07,968 --> 01:58:09,738
He Xin Long? Masato?

2766
01:58:09,968 --> 01:58:12,638
- Is it Woo Jin? - I have no clue.

2767
01:58:13,378 --> 01:58:15,048
The tenth place goes to...

2768
01:58:15,378 --> 01:58:16,408
Who is it?

2769
01:58:17,008 --> 01:58:20,048
(Who ranked 10th and missed the Top 8 place?)

2770
01:58:21,188 --> 01:58:22,248
It's Kang Woo Jin.

2771
01:58:23,218 --> 01:58:25,418
Thank you.

2772
01:58:26,288 --> 01:58:29,528
Woo Jin failed to enter Top Eight,

2773
01:58:29,758 --> 01:58:32,058
but he survived with a high rank, tenth.

2774
01:58:33,498 --> 01:58:35,827
Recently, I have been wondering...

2775
01:58:35,828 --> 01:58:38,038
if I deserve this much love.

2776
01:58:38,238 --> 01:58:40,068
And I am very grateful...

2777
01:58:40,238 --> 01:58:43,838
to Team "Plot Twist."

2778
01:58:43,938 --> 01:58:45,638
If I was alone,

2779
01:58:45,778 --> 01:58:49,508
I wouldn't have been able to receive such an overwhelming score.

2780
01:58:49,608 --> 01:58:51,518
And for that, I thank them a lot.

2781
01:58:54,718 --> 01:58:56,018
Great job, Woo Jin.

2782
01:59:00,218 --> 01:59:04,058
Now, I will announce the eighth-place survivor,

2783
01:59:04,228 --> 01:59:07,128
who will be the 1st one to sit in the Top 8 seat.

2784
01:59:07,258 --> 01:59:08,668
It's Top Eight now.

2785
01:59:09,128 --> 01:59:11,537
Between He Xin Long and Masato,

2786
01:59:11,538 --> 01:59:13,798
the participant whose name gets called ranks eighth.

2787
01:59:15,308 --> 01:59:18,778
The participant whose name doesn't get called will rank ninth.

2788
01:59:20,108 --> 01:59:22,207
According to Star Creator's global voting,

2789
01:59:22,208 --> 01:59:27,518
the 8th-place participant received 6,476,533 points.

2790
01:59:27,818 --> 01:59:29,248
That's too...

2791
01:59:30,618 --> 01:59:31,888
What kind of a score is that?

2792
01:59:32,388 --> 01:59:35,288
I can't even tell what kind of a number that is.

2793
01:59:35,388 --> 01:59:37,798
(Sen calmly counts the numbers.)

2794
01:59:37,928 --> 01:59:42,998
The 9th-place participant received 5,383,665 points.

2795
01:59:43,368 --> 01:59:48,038
The two participants' fate changed...

2796
01:59:48,138 --> 01:59:50,178
because of the vote difference of 1,092,868 points.

2797
01:59:50,308 --> 01:59:51,877
Gosh, 1.09 million points.

2798
01:59:51,878 --> 01:59:54,198
(1,092,868 points of vote difference decided their fates.)

2799
01:59:54,508 --> 01:59:55,678
That's a huge difference.

2800
01:59:56,378 --> 01:59:58,847
Between He Xin Long and Masato,

2801
01:59:58,848 --> 02:00:02,488
who will be the 1st person to sit in the Top 8 seat?

2802
02:00:03,148 --> 02:00:05,287
I think it could be Sato.

2803
02:00:05,288 --> 02:00:06,768
(8th, Masato, Week 3 Interim Racking)

2804
02:00:06,988 --> 02:00:10,388
(From the first day, he received attention for his stunning looks.)

2805
02:00:10,558 --> 02:00:13,498
(He's been handsome since kindergarten.)

2806
02:00:13,798 --> 02:00:15,297
(Masato showcased...)

2807
02:00:15,298 --> 02:00:16,868
(his tough charms.)

2808
02:00:17,098 --> 02:00:19,568
(Is Masato going to be the 1st one in Top 8?)

2809
02:00:19,698 --> 02:00:21,638
I really hope Xin Long will be chosen.

2810
02:00:21,938 --> 02:00:23,038
Brother.

2811
02:00:23,868 --> 02:00:25,277
(Reminiscing his past, He Xin Long...)

2812
02:00:25,278 --> 02:00:26,678
(looked after Na Yun Seo.)

2813
02:00:27,008 --> 02:00:29,408
I've been in the rain, so I need to hold up an umbrella.

2814
02:00:29,908 --> 02:00:31,117
(He Xin Long is a true all-rounder with character, talent, and charm.)

2815
02:00:31,118 --> 02:00:32,347
(- I came to see my umbrella. - I want to be his umbrella now.)

2816
02:00:32,348 --> 02:00:33,748
(Your future umbrellas are coming.)

2817
02:00:34,078 --> 02:00:36,447
(Will He Xin Long take 8th place?)

2818
02:00:36,448 --> 02:00:37,717
Who do you think it will be?

2819
02:00:37,718 --> 02:00:40,188
- Long! - Masato!

2820
02:00:40,488 --> 02:00:42,327
Eighth place chosen...

2821
02:00:42,328 --> 02:00:44,128
by the Star Creators is...

2822
02:00:44,228 --> 02:00:45,328
Who is it?

2823
02:00:45,698 --> 02:00:47,458
Will it be Sato or Xin Long?

2824
02:00:54,468 --> 02:00:56,768
Please tell us now.

2825
02:01:01,178 --> 02:01:04,208
Eighth place is Masato.

2826
02:01:04,948 --> 02:01:08,618
(8th, Masato)

2827
02:01:08,718 --> 02:01:10,048
Congrats, Sato.

2828
02:01:10,518 --> 02:01:13,487
Masato has been famous for his good looks...

2829
02:01:13,488 --> 02:01:15,887
since he was in kindergarten.

2830
02:01:15,888 --> 02:01:18,097
He won the glory of being the first one...

2831
02:01:18,098 --> 02:01:20,228
to be seated among the Top Eight.

2832
02:01:20,698 --> 02:01:24,738
I'm truly honored...

2833
02:01:25,268 --> 02:01:26,698
by this ranking,

2834
02:01:26,798 --> 02:01:30,208
and all I can say is, "Thank you."

2835
02:01:30,538 --> 02:01:33,777
Please keep rooting for me...

2836
02:01:33,778 --> 02:01:35,508
and keep your eyes on me. Thank you.

2837
02:01:38,748 --> 02:01:42,288
Although he couldn't join the Top Eight,

2838
02:01:42,388 --> 02:01:45,988
He Xin Long was ranked ninth, which is also very high.

2839
02:01:46,088 --> 02:01:47,358
Let's go, Xin Long!

2840
02:01:47,688 --> 02:01:50,588
I'm truly happy to receive...

2841
02:01:50,688 --> 02:01:52,427
all this love.

2842
02:01:52,428 --> 02:01:54,467
So, I will stay genuine, diligent, and humble...

2843
02:01:54,468 --> 02:01:56,527
to keep showing you...

2844
02:01:56,528 --> 02:01:58,498
amazing performances.

2845
02:01:58,598 --> 02:02:01,068
Now that I got rained on,

2846
02:02:01,168 --> 02:02:04,778
I will be the umbrella for those around me.

2847
02:02:04,878 --> 02:02:05,908
Thank you.

2848
02:02:08,808 --> 02:02:09,848
He put it so nicely.

2849
02:02:10,308 --> 02:02:12,478
- Long! - Yun Seo!

2850
02:02:13,678 --> 02:02:14,888
We survived.

2851
02:02:16,748 --> 02:02:18,017
(Masato heads to the 8th-place seat.)

2852
02:02:18,018 --> 02:02:19,157
I'm so jealous.

2853
02:02:19,158 --> 02:02:20,158
That's high up.

2854
02:02:20,418 --> 02:02:21,657
Eighth place.

2855
02:02:21,658 --> 02:02:22,887
(Masato is the first one to sit among the Top 8.)

2856
02:02:22,888 --> 02:02:23,987
He got a comfortable seat.

2857
02:02:23,988 --> 02:02:26,358
I'm so jealous.

2858
02:02:27,258 --> 02:02:30,698
I'm nervous. It's too much pressure.

2859
02:02:32,368 --> 02:02:35,807
Next, I will announce seventh place...

2860
02:02:35,808 --> 02:02:36,968
in the Top Eight.

2861
02:02:38,408 --> 02:02:41,477
(7th place)

2862
02:02:41,478 --> 02:02:44,108
There are no more candidates. They announce them right away.

2863
02:02:45,248 --> 02:02:47,378
The seventh-place participant...

2864
02:02:47,478 --> 02:02:49,247
served as the cornerstone of the team...

2865
02:02:49,248 --> 02:02:50,988
in the 1-on-1 Class Battle,

2866
02:02:51,188 --> 02:02:52,988
playing a central role in securing the win...

2867
02:02:53,588 --> 02:02:57,928
and driving the team toward a successful outcome.

2868
02:02:58,698 --> 02:02:59,758
Who is it?

2869
02:03:00,358 --> 02:03:01,368
One of the leaders?

2870
02:03:02,128 --> 02:03:03,198
Jun Seo?

2871
02:03:07,598 --> 02:03:08,608
Me?

2872
02:03:09,708 --> 02:03:14,708
(Jun Seo held the team together as the leader of Team "Whiplash" 1.)

2873
02:03:15,408 --> 02:03:16,508
Jun Seo?

2874
02:03:17,578 --> 02:03:18,618
Is it Kang Min?

2875
02:03:21,188 --> 02:03:22,247
(Kang Min served as the cornerstone...)

2876
02:03:22,248 --> 02:03:24,288
(of Team "S-Class" and looked after his teammates.)

2877
02:03:25,518 --> 02:03:26,587
It couldn't be me.

2878
02:03:26,588 --> 02:03:27,758
(Embarrassed)

2879
02:03:28,058 --> 02:03:29,188
Who would it be?

2880
02:03:30,958 --> 02:03:35,568
He survived with a total score of 6,550,521.

2881
02:03:36,498 --> 02:03:37,898
Six million?

2882
02:03:37,998 --> 02:03:41,968
Who will be the lucky participant to be ranked seventh?

2883
02:03:42,768 --> 02:03:43,968
I bet it's Jun Seo.

2884
02:03:44,778 --> 02:03:46,037
The seventh-place participant...

2885
02:03:46,038 --> 02:03:48,978
to be given the chance to keep pursuing his dream is...

2886
02:03:53,748 --> 02:03:55,448
(7th place)

2887
02:03:55,988 --> 02:03:58,988
(Who is the 7th-place survivor?)

2888
02:04:01,228 --> 02:04:03,587
It's Yoo Kang Min.

2889
02:04:03,588 --> 02:04:08,097
(7th, Yoo Kang Min)

2890
02:04:08,098 --> 02:04:11,798
With his usual confidence...

2891
02:04:11,898 --> 02:04:15,407
and quiet, thoughtful care for his teammates,

2892
02:04:15,408 --> 02:04:17,838
he captured the hearts of the Star Creators.

2893
02:04:18,278 --> 02:04:19,278
Congratulations.

2894
02:04:19,279 --> 02:04:20,838
(7th, Yoo Kang Min, 6,550,521 points)

2895
02:04:21,948 --> 02:04:23,824
He is cold on the outside and warm on the inside.

2896
02:04:23,848 --> 02:04:27,818
Thank you for trusting me and placing me in seventh.

2897
02:04:27,918 --> 02:04:32,618
I'll keep working at it to give you better performances.

2898
02:04:35,488 --> 02:04:36,488
Lastly,

2899
02:04:37,758 --> 02:04:40,498
Dong Heon is awaiting the announcement...

2900
02:04:41,998 --> 02:04:43,498
as a 48th-place candidate.

2901
02:04:45,068 --> 02:04:47,638
Is there anything you want to say to him?

2902
02:04:53,278 --> 02:04:55,948
I'm not sure what to say to him.

2903
02:04:59,818 --> 02:05:00,978
Aside from the rankings,

2904
02:05:01,748 --> 02:05:03,948
he'll always be my best brother.

2905
02:05:07,518 --> 02:05:09,958
Whatever happens, I will have faith in him.

2906
02:05:17,068 --> 02:05:19,898
(Kang Min sits in the 7th-place seat.)

2907
02:05:27,278 --> 02:05:30,877
Next, I will announce sixth place.

2908
02:05:30,878 --> 02:05:33,518
(Number 6)

2909
02:05:33,678 --> 02:05:35,718
The sixth-place participant...

2910
02:05:35,988 --> 02:05:38,358
became the center of attention for his looks...

2911
02:05:38,858 --> 02:05:42,188
as soon as the contestants were revealed.

2912
02:05:43,388 --> 02:05:44,468
There are too many, though.

2913
02:05:45,728 --> 02:05:48,228
They're all so handsome.

2914
02:05:49,268 --> 02:05:51,968
It's hard to say who's better-looking.

2915
02:05:53,568 --> 02:05:57,737
(The candidates' shiny looks)

2916
02:05:57,738 --> 02:06:00,008
Maybe he means the poster.

2917
02:06:00,508 --> 02:06:01,948
- Sang Hyeon? - Yes.

2918
02:06:02,048 --> 02:06:03,308
Li Yu or Sang Hyeon.

2919
02:06:03,878 --> 02:06:07,078
(The posters of these two were the talk of the town.)

2920
02:06:07,418 --> 02:06:08,748
Li Yu?

2921
02:06:09,118 --> 02:06:10,147
(3th, Chuei Li Yu, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2922
02:06:10,148 --> 02:06:14,288
(Who will be 6th place?)

2923
02:06:14,358 --> 02:06:16,288
The first digit of the score has changed.

2924
02:06:16,488 --> 02:06:17,958
(Exclaiming)

2925
02:06:18,098 --> 02:06:19,098
It's seven million?

2926
02:06:19,099 --> 02:06:23,368
With the score of 7,569,231,

2927
02:06:25,238 --> 02:06:28,108
this person was ranked sixth.

2928
02:06:29,108 --> 02:06:30,308
The sixth-place participant...

2929
02:06:30,938 --> 02:06:32,008
Who is it?

2930
02:06:32,308 --> 02:06:33,977
(No one can predict who placed 6th.)

2931
02:06:33,978 --> 02:06:37,708
(3th, Chuei Li Yu, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2932
02:06:40,378 --> 02:06:42,948
(6th place)

2933
02:06:43,448 --> 02:06:44,857
Or it's Jun Seo.

2934
02:06:44,858 --> 02:06:46,538
(6th, Kim Jun Seo, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2935
02:06:48,058 --> 02:06:49,857
(3rd, Chuei Li Yu, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2936
02:06:49,858 --> 02:06:50,858
(Who will be the 6th-place survivor?)

2937
02:06:50,859 --> 02:06:54,257
(6th, Kim Jun Seo, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2938
02:06:54,258 --> 02:06:57,228
(4th, Chung Sang Hyeon, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2939
02:06:58,398 --> 02:07:00,337
It's Chuei Li Yu.

2940
02:07:00,338 --> 02:07:03,407
(6th, Chuei Li Yu)

2941
02:07:03,408 --> 02:07:04,467
It's Chuei Li Yu.

2942
02:07:04,468 --> 02:07:05,478
(Surprised)

2943
02:07:08,948 --> 02:07:10,478
It was Li Yu?

2944
02:07:11,008 --> 02:07:12,548
Do I go out there?

2945
02:07:12,948 --> 02:07:14,817
(Looking around)

2946
02:07:14,818 --> 02:07:16,088
Please come forward.

2947
02:07:21,928 --> 02:07:23,057
Li Yu...

2948
02:07:23,058 --> 02:07:26,528
drew significant attention from the Star Creators...

2949
02:07:26,828 --> 02:07:28,698
as soon as the poster...

2950
02:07:28,798 --> 02:07:31,398
announcing the start of the program was released.

2951
02:07:31,668 --> 02:07:33,237
Congratulations on your survival.

2952
02:07:33,238 --> 02:07:34,968
(6th, Chuei Li Yu, 7,569,231 points)

2953
02:07:37,308 --> 02:07:40,107
Receiving all this love...

2954
02:07:40,108 --> 02:07:42,178
makes me emotional.

2955
02:07:42,848 --> 02:07:46,678
And my team, Team "Plot Twist" Two.

2956
02:07:46,778 --> 02:07:48,847
If it weren't for my teammates,

2957
02:07:48,848 --> 02:07:50,787
I wouldn't have made it...

2958
02:07:50,788 --> 02:07:53,417
so high in the rankings.

2959
02:07:53,418 --> 02:07:54,518
Thank you.

2960
02:08:03,268 --> 02:08:05,738
We will look forward to your future achievements.

2961
02:08:08,468 --> 02:08:13,007
(Li Yu sits in the 6th-place seat.)

2962
02:08:13,008 --> 02:08:16,878
Which participant was...

2963
02:08:17,478 --> 02:08:18,478
ranked fifth?

2964
02:08:19,318 --> 02:08:21,848
- Jun Seo? - Jun Seo.

2965
02:08:21,948 --> 02:08:23,988
The fifth-place survivor...

2966
02:08:24,418 --> 02:08:25,938
delivered an impressive performance...

2967
02:08:26,858 --> 02:08:28,388
in the Class Placement Match...

2968
02:08:28,688 --> 02:08:31,428
- with a song by ENHYPEN. - It's Jun Seo.

2969
02:08:31,728 --> 02:08:33,128
- That's me. - Jun Seo.

2970
02:08:34,098 --> 02:08:35,467
(Jun Seo performed...)

2971
02:08:35,468 --> 02:08:38,068
("Sweet Venom" by ENHYPEN in the Class Placement Match.)

2972
02:08:39,068 --> 02:08:40,568
- That's me. - It's either you or me.

2973
02:08:40,668 --> 02:08:42,008
It's between us?

2974
02:08:42,868 --> 02:08:45,238
Oh, Leo also performed that. And Sang Won.

2975
02:08:47,578 --> 02:08:50,578
(Leo and Sang Won performed "No Doubt" by ENHYPEN.)

2976
02:08:51,148 --> 02:08:53,847
But Zhou An Xin did a song by ENHYPEN too. "FEVER."

2977
02:08:53,848 --> 02:08:55,088
Oh, you're right.

2978
02:08:55,888 --> 02:08:57,808
(Zhou An Xin also performed "FEVER" by ENHYPEN.)

2979
02:08:58,388 --> 02:08:59,787
They all did songs by ENHYPEN.

2980
02:08:59,788 --> 02:09:01,727
All four of them performed songs by ENHYPEN.

2981
02:09:01,728 --> 02:09:04,227
- Wait. Did we? - Yes, all four of us.

2982
02:09:04,228 --> 02:09:05,627
(48th-place candidate, "Sweet Venom," "FEVER," "No Doubt")

2983
02:09:05,628 --> 02:09:07,527
But I bet it's me this time.

2984
02:09:07,528 --> 02:09:08,728
We don't know that yet.

2985
02:09:09,228 --> 02:09:12,967
You can rank high if you do a song by ENHYPEN.

2986
02:09:12,968 --> 02:09:15,408
The fifth-place participant...

2987
02:09:15,938 --> 02:09:17,608
performed...

2988
02:09:17,708 --> 02:09:20,638
"Whiplash" in the 1-on-1 Class Battle.

2989
02:09:20,808 --> 02:09:23,508
- It's just them. - I know.

2990
02:09:23,778 --> 02:09:26,177
(This is the zone for Team "Whiplash.")

2991
02:09:26,178 --> 02:09:28,078
- Gosh. - We know.

2992
02:09:29,048 --> 02:09:30,088
(Let's check again.)

2993
02:09:30,188 --> 02:09:31,564
(Leo, Jun Seo, Sang Won, and An Xin are all on the stage.)

2994
02:09:31,588 --> 02:09:33,617
I think it's either Leo or Jun Seo.

2995
02:09:33,618 --> 02:09:34,817
I bet it's Jun Seo.

2996
02:09:34,818 --> 02:09:36,457
(6th, Kim Jun Seo, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2997
02:09:36,458 --> 02:09:38,128
(5th, Lee Leo, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

2998
02:09:38,698 --> 02:09:43,228
With the score of 7,650,903,

2999
02:09:43,728 --> 02:09:46,867
- this participant placed fifth. - That's a lot of points.

3000
02:09:46,868 --> 02:09:47,868
That's wild.

3001
02:09:48,338 --> 02:09:49,937
The fifth-place survivor is...

3002
02:09:49,938 --> 02:09:51,207
(Leo and Jun Seo)

3003
02:09:51,208 --> 02:09:52,377
- Who is it? - Jun Seo?

3004
02:09:52,378 --> 02:09:53,978
- Jun Seo. - It has to be Jun Seo.

3005
02:09:56,048 --> 02:09:57,148
Lee Leo.

3006
02:09:58,618 --> 02:09:59,618
(5th, Lee Leo)

3007
02:09:59,619 --> 02:10:00,948
What's up?

3008
02:10:01,448 --> 02:10:02,448
Let's go, man.

3009
02:10:02,788 --> 02:10:05,688
- Leo! - What's up, Leo!

3010
02:10:07,188 --> 02:10:09,987
- Jun Seo must have ranked high. - He must have.

3011
02:10:09,988 --> 02:10:11,228
- Leo! - Leo!

3012
02:10:11,758 --> 02:10:13,528
- Hey! - What's going on?

3013
02:10:14,558 --> 02:10:19,437
Every performance...

3014
02:10:19,438 --> 02:10:22,768
meant so much to me.

3015
02:10:23,308 --> 02:10:27,278
So, I've always done my best in preparing for them.

3016
02:10:27,508 --> 02:10:29,607
Thanks to all the love you give me,

3017
02:10:29,608 --> 02:10:30,778
Your love and support...

3018
02:10:31,778 --> 02:10:33,118
bring me so much joy.

3019
02:10:33,278 --> 02:10:34,747
To show my gratitude to all the Star Creators...

3020
02:10:34,748 --> 02:10:36,188
who support me,

3021
02:10:36,588 --> 02:10:39,417
I will strive to be stronger...

3022
02:10:39,418 --> 02:10:41,788
and cooler.

3023
02:10:42,658 --> 02:10:44,258
I love you all. Thank you.

3024
02:10:44,858 --> 02:10:46,528
(5th place)

3025
02:10:49,828 --> 02:10:51,797
(Lee Leo heads to the spot for 5th place.)

3026
02:10:51,798 --> 02:10:53,367
- He's beloved everywhere. - Right.

3027
02:10:53,368 --> 02:10:54,568
- That's Leo. - Thank you.

3028
02:10:57,338 --> 02:10:58,538
Gosh, that's really high up.

3029
02:11:00,238 --> 02:11:02,708
- Goodness, this feels different. - It's heavy.

3030
02:11:08,918 --> 02:11:10,018
Next,

3031
02:11:10,118 --> 02:11:14,318
I will announce the participant in fourth place.

3032
02:11:16,158 --> 02:11:18,898
(4th place)

3033
02:11:19,728 --> 02:11:20,758
Gosh, fourth place.

3034
02:11:21,198 --> 02:11:22,597
I hope Sang Hyeon wins third place.

3035
02:11:22,598 --> 02:11:23,697
(4th, Chung Sang Hyeon, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

3036
02:11:23,698 --> 02:11:24,998
Don't you think he will?

3037
02:11:25,398 --> 02:11:26,598
It's either Jun Seo or him.

3038
02:11:27,868 --> 02:11:29,868
As for this participant in fourth place,

3039
02:11:30,268 --> 02:11:32,438
during the first Class Placement Match,

3040
02:11:32,878 --> 02:11:34,038
All Star...

3041
02:11:34,738 --> 02:11:35,808
All Star wasn't his class.

3042
02:11:36,278 --> 02:11:38,748
- It wasn't his class. - It wasn't.

3043
02:11:39,448 --> 02:11:40,717
I was the only one.

3044
02:11:40,718 --> 02:11:43,318
- No. Jun Seo and me. - All Star wasn't his class.

3045
02:11:43,848 --> 02:11:46,388
(All Star wasn't his class.)

3046
02:11:47,088 --> 02:11:50,187
(Kim Jun Seo performed "Sweet Venom" during the match.)

3047
02:11:50,188 --> 02:11:52,357
(In the end, he was placed in the 2 Star Class.)

3048
02:11:52,358 --> 02:11:55,897
(Chung Sang Hyeon performed a cheerful hip-hop performance.)

3049
02:11:55,898 --> 02:11:58,498
(He was also placed in the 2 Star Class.)

3050
02:12:00,098 --> 02:12:03,708
I will now announce the participant in fourth place.

3051
02:12:04,738 --> 02:12:05,838
Who will it be?

3052
02:12:06,838 --> 02:12:07,908
Let's see.

3053
02:12:08,648 --> 02:12:12,418
This participant received 7,936,328 points in total...

3054
02:12:12,778 --> 02:12:16,788
and secured a spot in the Top Eight with a high ranking.

3055
02:12:16,988 --> 02:12:19,618
- The score... - That's just some crazy score.

3056
02:12:20,118 --> 02:12:21,488
The fourth place goes to...

3057
02:12:21,758 --> 02:12:25,098
(It's either Jun Seo or Sang Hyeon. Who's in 4th place?)

3058
02:12:26,498 --> 02:12:28,327
It's Kim Jun Seo. Congratulations.

3059
02:12:28,328 --> 02:12:30,928
(Kim Jun Seo, 4th place in the Top 8)

3060
02:12:34,498 --> 02:12:35,907
- That's a huge jump. - Sang Hyeon.

3061
02:12:35,908 --> 02:12:38,068
Jun Seo, please come to the front.

3062
02:12:39,438 --> 02:12:40,478
(Amazed)

3063
02:12:41,678 --> 02:12:43,978
He Zhong Xing is all about being sexy and hot.

3064
02:12:44,978 --> 02:12:48,078
And Kim Jun Seo gives off the languid, sexy vibe.

3065
02:12:48,848 --> 02:12:50,448
(Laughing)

3066
02:12:51,548 --> 02:12:53,788
Kim Jun Seo with the languid, sexy vibe.

3067
02:12:54,058 --> 02:12:55,987
He continues to move up in the rankings...

3068
02:12:55,988 --> 02:12:58,088
thanks to his wealth of performance experience.

3069
02:12:58,328 --> 02:13:00,228
Congratulations on being placed in fourth.

3070
02:13:03,298 --> 02:13:05,338
(Copying Jun Seo)

3071
02:13:05,498 --> 02:13:06,538
I envy him.

3072
02:13:07,768 --> 02:13:11,367
(Kim Jun Seo, 4th, 7,936,328 points)

3073
02:13:11,368 --> 02:13:14,177
I'm sorry. I didn't see this coming.

3074
02:13:14,178 --> 02:13:15,678
I ended up with a high ranking.

3075
02:13:15,978 --> 02:13:17,307
So I'm struggling to find my words.

3076
02:13:17,308 --> 02:13:19,877
I'm so grateful to my team, Team "Whiplash,"

3077
02:13:19,878 --> 02:13:21,678
for putting their hearts into this battle.

3078
02:13:22,488 --> 02:13:25,487
The journey of BOYS II PLANET will end...

3079
02:13:25,488 --> 02:13:27,718
for some of the participants as of today.

3080
02:13:32,098 --> 02:13:35,828
The end of a journey is another phrase for a new beginning.

3081
02:13:36,268 --> 02:13:37,328
That's true.

3082
02:13:38,098 --> 02:13:39,698
You may be eliminated today,

3083
02:13:41,438 --> 02:13:44,337
but nothing can eliminate our youth.

3084
02:13:44,338 --> 02:13:45,708
So let's keep doing our best.

3085
02:13:46,278 --> 02:13:47,778
- Good luck. - Thank you.

3086
02:13:49,978 --> 02:13:52,417
Please take your seat.

3087
02:13:52,418 --> 02:13:53,717
(Kim Jun Seo heads to the seat for 4th place.)

3088
02:13:53,718 --> 02:13:54,778
Thank you.

3089
02:13:55,748 --> 02:13:57,688
- This is so cool. - I can't watch this.

3090
02:13:59,058 --> 02:14:00,388
Sang Hyeon...

3091
02:14:07,598 --> 02:14:08,668
Gosh, that's high up.

3092
02:14:08,868 --> 02:14:11,898
All right. Only 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places remain.

3093
02:14:12,168 --> 02:14:15,167
(The announcements for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places remain only.)

3094
02:14:15,168 --> 02:14:16,337
Hello.

3095
02:14:16,338 --> 02:14:17,937
(Peekaboo)

3096
02:14:17,938 --> 02:14:19,438
- Is it my turn? - His ears are red.

3097
02:14:20,108 --> 02:14:23,478
I will now announce the participants...

3098
02:14:23,608 --> 02:14:27,248
in the highest ranking group of the Top Eight.

3099
02:14:27,578 --> 02:14:30,248
It's the Top Three of BOYS II PLANET.

3100
02:14:30,788 --> 02:14:31,857
(Candidates for 1st Place)

3101
02:14:31,858 --> 02:14:33,018
Candidates for first place.

3102
02:14:33,318 --> 02:14:34,388
Let's go.

3103
02:14:35,458 --> 02:14:36,588
Candidates for first place.

3104
02:14:37,728 --> 02:14:39,997
I'm so envious. They're up for first place.

3105
02:14:39,998 --> 02:14:41,998
I will now reveal the three candidates...

3106
02:14:42,268 --> 02:14:45,737
for 1st place of the Top 8 on BOYS II PLANET.

3107
02:14:45,738 --> 02:14:47,998
- Come on. - Split the screen into three.

3108
02:14:50,368 --> 02:14:52,077
(Chung Sang Hyeon, Lee Sang Won, Zhou An Xin)

3109
02:14:52,078 --> 02:14:53,238
I knew it.

3110
02:14:53,938 --> 02:14:56,408
- Why did they lower their heads? - Why are you guys so shy?

3111
02:14:57,208 --> 02:14:59,128
Check out the chemistry of their faces. My gosh.

3112
02:14:59,218 --> 02:15:00,548
I don't know where to look.

3113
02:15:00,648 --> 02:15:03,918
Here are the candidates for 1st place of the Top 8.

3114
02:15:03,948 --> 02:15:05,488
Participant Chung Sang Hyeon.

3115
02:15:05,518 --> 02:15:07,017
Participant Lee Sang Won.

3116
02:15:07,018 --> 02:15:08,727
Participant Zhou An Xin.

3117
02:15:08,728 --> 02:15:10,728
Please come to the front.

3118
02:15:12,558 --> 02:15:13,558
Let's go.

3119
02:15:13,559 --> 02:15:16,039
(The 3 candidates for 1st place walk up for the announcement.)

3120
02:15:19,768 --> 02:15:21,597
They all look so handsome.

3121
02:15:21,598 --> 02:15:22,708
Let's see.

3122
02:15:22,868 --> 02:15:24,607
The three of them officially...

3123
02:15:24,608 --> 02:15:27,708
secured their spots on the show as the Top Three.

3124
02:15:27,838 --> 02:15:32,248
I will now announce the rankings...

3125
02:15:32,478 --> 02:15:33,718
of the three participants.

3126
02:15:34,578 --> 02:15:35,617
It's nerve-racking.

3127
02:15:35,618 --> 02:15:37,587
(4th, Chung Sang Hyeon, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

3128
02:15:37,588 --> 02:15:39,587
(2nd, Zhou An Xin, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

3129
02:15:39,588 --> 02:15:41,588
(1st, Lee Sang Won, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

3130
02:15:41,718 --> 02:15:42,887
I will start...

3131
02:15:42,888 --> 02:15:46,197
with the announcement for third place...

3132
02:15:46,198 --> 02:15:47,328
of the Top Eight.

3133
02:15:47,598 --> 02:15:48,898
(3rd place)

3134
02:15:49,198 --> 02:15:51,274
The 1st digit of the 3rd-place participant's total score...

3135
02:15:51,298 --> 02:15:53,598
has changed again.

3136
02:15:53,868 --> 02:15:55,137
He received a high score...

3137
02:15:55,138 --> 02:15:58,007
- of 8,071,897 points... - Gosh, 8 million points?

3138
02:15:58,008 --> 02:15:59,878
In total...

3139
02:16:00,008 --> 02:16:02,248
and secured third place.

3140
02:16:02,608 --> 02:16:04,977
- Eight million? - I guess that was possible.

3141
02:16:04,978 --> 02:16:07,348
A lot of people voted for him.

3142
02:16:07,778 --> 02:16:09,047
The third-place participant is...

3143
02:16:09,048 --> 02:16:11,217
- Sang Hyeon won third place? - But what if...

3144
02:16:11,218 --> 02:16:12,218
it's Zhou An Xin?

3145
02:16:12,219 --> 02:16:13,987
(4th, Chung Sang Hyeon, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

3146
02:16:13,988 --> 02:16:15,988
(2nd, Zhou An Xin, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

3147
02:16:16,128 --> 02:16:17,357
It's Chung Sang Hyeon.

3148
02:16:17,358 --> 02:16:20,658
(Chung Sang Hyeon is in 3rd place of the Top 8.)

3149
02:16:23,268 --> 02:16:25,298
- He's at his peak. - Third place? That's amazing.

3150
02:16:26,768 --> 02:16:29,237
I still have a long way to go.

3151
02:16:29,238 --> 02:16:31,138
And I have a lot to learn too.

3152
02:16:31,538 --> 02:16:35,207
But despite all that, you gave me endless love and attention.

3153
02:16:35,208 --> 02:16:37,577
With your help, I was able to win third place.

3154
02:16:37,578 --> 02:16:39,477
So I'd like to express my gratitude for that.

3155
02:16:39,478 --> 02:16:40,578
Thank you.

3156
02:16:44,618 --> 02:16:45,618
Good for him.

3157
02:16:46,888 --> 02:16:50,127
(Chung Sang Hyeon takes the seat for 3rd place.)

3158
02:16:50,128 --> 02:16:51,458
Hey, you're really up high.

3159
02:16:53,058 --> 02:16:55,967
Gosh, which one of them will win first place?

3160
02:16:55,968 --> 02:16:59,497
I will now announce the participant who will claim...

3161
02:16:59,498 --> 02:17:02,007
this big honor of winning 1st place among the Top 8...

3162
02:17:02,008 --> 02:17:04,338
at the First Survivor Announcement.

3163
02:17:06,108 --> 02:17:07,608
Gosh, it's first place.

3164
02:17:07,678 --> 02:17:08,678
Let's find out.

3165
02:17:08,679 --> 02:17:11,507
Will Zhou An Xin take first place?

3166
02:17:11,508 --> 02:17:13,017
Or will Sang Won maintain his place?

3167
02:17:13,018 --> 02:17:14,078
I can't wait to find out.

3168
02:17:16,248 --> 02:17:17,688
Which 1 of the 2...

3169
02:17:17,748 --> 02:17:21,118
will be at the top?

3170
02:17:21,588 --> 02:17:22,588
Zhou An Xin.

3171
02:17:22,758 --> 02:17:23,987
I think it will be Sang Won.

3172
02:17:23,988 --> 02:17:25,828
(Candidates for 1st Place)

3173
02:17:26,258 --> 02:17:30,727
Will Participant Zhou An Xin...

3174
02:17:30,728 --> 02:17:32,867
claim the honor of winning first place?

3175
02:17:32,868 --> 02:17:34,108
- Come on. - He totally got me.

3176
02:17:40,508 --> 02:17:42,277
(One must listen to the whole sentence in Korean.)

3177
02:17:42,278 --> 02:17:44,347
- He startled me. - My gosh.

3178
02:17:44,348 --> 02:17:45,517
He totally got me.

3179
02:17:45,518 --> 02:17:46,518
(They suddenly feel a surge of tension.)

3180
02:17:46,519 --> 02:17:47,599
- He got me. - My goodness.

3181
02:17:48,548 --> 02:17:50,287
- What is this? - I thought it was Zhou An Xin.

3182
02:17:50,288 --> 02:17:51,417
(Who will win the honor of winning 1st place?)

3183
02:17:51,418 --> 02:17:54,918
(To be continued)

3184
02:17:55,942 --> 02:17:59,471
I will now announce the participant who will claim...

3185
02:17:59,472 --> 02:18:02,011
this big honor of winning 1st place among the Top 8...

3186
02:18:02,012 --> 02:18:04,342
at the First Survivor Announcement.

3187
02:18:06,112 --> 02:18:08,581
- Gosh, it's first place. - Let's find out.

3188
02:18:08,582 --> 02:18:11,581
Will Zhou An Xin take first place?

3189
02:18:11,582 --> 02:18:13,051
Or will Sang Won maintain his place?

3190
02:18:13,052 --> 02:18:14,222
I can't wait to find out.

3191
02:18:16,292 --> 02:18:19,131
First of all, the first digit of the second-place participant's...

3192
02:18:19,132 --> 02:18:22,301
total score has changed again.

3193
02:18:22,302 --> 02:18:25,462
The score has gone over ten million points.

3194
02:18:27,372 --> 02:18:28,372
There's that big of a difference?

3195
02:18:28,373 --> 02:18:29,541
He received ten million points all by himself?

3196
02:18:29,542 --> 02:18:33,872
The participant in 2nd place received 11,275,276 points.

3197
02:18:34,212 --> 02:18:35,981
The score difference is huge then.

3198
02:18:35,982 --> 02:18:37,912
And as for the participant in first place,

3199
02:18:38,442 --> 02:18:40,681
Across 170 countries including Korea, Japan,

3200
02:18:40,682 --> 02:18:42,781
the US, France, the UK, Germany, and Canada,

3201
02:18:42,782 --> 02:18:45,321
he took first place...

3202
02:18:45,322 --> 02:18:47,592
in the vote count.

3203
02:18:48,922 --> 02:18:50,321
Across 170 countries?

3204
02:18:50,322 --> 02:18:55,562
He received 12,497,772 points in total...

3205
02:18:55,702 --> 02:18:59,872
and secured first place with an overwhelming score.

3206
02:19:00,002 --> 02:19:01,771
"An overwhelming score." It's impossible to beat.

3207
02:19:01,772 --> 02:19:03,302
That's just crazy.

3208
02:19:03,672 --> 02:19:05,271
How can we beat 170 countries?

3209
02:19:05,272 --> 02:19:07,141
We'll never come close.

3210
02:19:07,142 --> 02:19:10,242
Which 1 of the 2...

3211
02:19:10,942 --> 02:19:12,112
will be at the top?

3212
02:19:12,142 --> 02:19:13,651
Whoever comes out on top,

3213
02:19:13,652 --> 02:19:15,152
- no one can disagree. - My gosh.

3214
02:19:15,682 --> 02:19:16,821
Both of their scores are crazy.

3215
02:19:16,822 --> 02:19:20,021
I will now reveal the participant who has won the highest ranking...

3216
02:19:20,022 --> 02:19:21,051
on the show.

3217
02:19:21,052 --> 02:19:22,492
First place goes to...

3218
02:19:25,322 --> 02:19:27,032
- Is it time? - Zhou An Xin?

3219
02:19:28,132 --> 02:19:29,532
I think it will be Sang Won.

3220
02:19:30,262 --> 02:19:31,332
I'm so nervous.

3221
02:19:33,072 --> 02:19:34,872
I think I know.

3222
02:19:35,672 --> 02:19:37,242
(1st place candidate)

3223
02:19:37,742 --> 02:19:39,812
It's Lee Sang Won.

3224
02:19:39,942 --> 02:19:41,071
Congratulations.

3225
02:19:41,072 --> 02:19:43,752
(1st place survivor, Lee Sang Won, 2nd place survivor, Zhou An Xin)

3226
02:19:44,742 --> 02:19:46,612
(1st place)

3227
02:19:48,052 --> 02:19:49,322
He maintained his rank.

3228
02:19:49,722 --> 02:19:51,052
Gosh, Sang Won.

3229
02:19:51,782 --> 02:19:53,591
Gosh, he's overwhelmingly better.

3230
02:19:53,592 --> 02:19:55,821
Since the first week of the global vote,

3231
02:19:55,822 --> 02:19:58,421
participant Lee Sang Won didn't let anyone take...

3232
02:19:58,422 --> 02:19:59,761
the first place spot.

3233
02:19:59,762 --> 02:20:01,931
This time, he maintained his 1st place position in the Top 8,

3234
02:20:01,932 --> 02:20:05,262
dominating with overwhelmingly high points once again.

3235
02:20:05,362 --> 02:20:07,031
How do you feel...

3236
02:20:07,032 --> 02:20:09,802
to have won 1st place in the 1st Survivor Announcement?

3237
02:20:09,942 --> 02:20:13,711
Actually, before I came on this show,

3238
02:20:13,712 --> 02:20:17,442
I thought a lot to myself that I wouldn't have...

3239
02:20:17,812 --> 02:20:21,211
any reasons to perform on stage in the future.

3240
02:20:21,212 --> 02:20:24,521
Thanks to this great opportunity, I got to meet a great team...

3241
02:20:24,522 --> 02:20:26,221
and got to create a great performance.

3242
02:20:26,222 --> 02:20:29,261
So many people who cheer me on...

3243
02:20:29,262 --> 02:20:30,722
and send me love...

3244
02:20:31,322 --> 02:20:33,791
I want to tell them that I'm so grateful.

3245
02:20:33,792 --> 02:20:35,961
I still think that...

3246
02:20:35,962 --> 02:20:38,361
I don't deserve to be in this spot,

3247
02:20:38,362 --> 02:20:40,082
so I won't forget my original resolution...

3248
02:20:40,332 --> 02:20:43,171
or how desperate I felt.

3249
02:20:43,172 --> 02:20:45,841
I'll work hard so that I can maintain...

3250
02:20:45,842 --> 02:20:47,311
my first place rank until the end.

3251
02:20:47,312 --> 02:20:48,442
Thank you.

3252
02:20:49,342 --> 02:20:51,482
Yes!

3253
02:20:53,152 --> 02:20:55,981
Congratulations on your first place ranking.

3254
02:20:55,982 --> 02:20:57,951
Also, we will hear from participant Zhou An Xin,

3255
02:20:57,952 --> 02:21:01,122
who came in at second place.

3256
02:21:01,652 --> 02:21:04,122
First of all, I feel so great right now.

3257
02:21:04,522 --> 02:21:07,761
I am so grateful and honored...

3258
02:21:07,762 --> 02:21:09,461
that the Star Creators...

3259
02:21:09,462 --> 02:21:10,931
are cheering me on.

3260
02:21:10,932 --> 02:21:13,331
I will work even harder from now on.

3261
02:21:13,332 --> 02:21:14,871
I will continue to work hard...

3262
02:21:14,872 --> 02:21:17,441
and show everyone how much I can improve...

3263
02:21:17,442 --> 02:21:19,002
and give better performances.

3264
02:21:19,072 --> 02:21:21,012
Thank you for your support.

3265
02:21:28,782 --> 02:21:33,352
(Zhou An Xin sits in the 2nd place seat.)

3266
02:21:35,152 --> 02:21:38,661
Lastly, first place participant, Lee Sang Won.

3267
02:21:38,662 --> 02:21:41,062
Please move to your seat.

3268
02:21:45,602 --> 02:21:48,732
(1st place)

3269
02:21:48,902 --> 02:21:50,272
Gosh, that's so high up.

3270
02:21:50,602 --> 02:21:51,742
It's so high.

3271
02:21:53,472 --> 02:21:55,952
(Lee Sang Won goes up to his seat as people congratulate him.)

3272
02:21:57,682 --> 02:22:01,912
(The 1st owner of the 1st place seat in the survivor announcement)

3273
02:22:04,252 --> 02:22:06,992
This must be so much pressure on him as an INFP.

3274
02:22:12,632 --> 02:22:15,332
Through Star Creators' votes making up the results 100 percent,

3275
02:22:15,392 --> 02:22:18,302
the 1st Top 8 group on BOYS II PLANET...

3276
02:22:18,362 --> 02:22:19,572
has been put together.

3277
02:22:19,932 --> 02:22:21,032
Congratulations.

3278
02:22:26,572 --> 02:22:29,282
The seats from 1st place to 10th place have been filled.

3279
02:22:29,812 --> 02:22:32,712
Except for 48th place, whose candidates have been revealed,

3280
02:22:33,352 --> 02:22:36,422
there is only one rank that remains.

3281
02:22:36,822 --> 02:22:38,352
It's the 47th place.

3282
02:22:38,982 --> 02:22:42,922
From now on, I will reveal the person who ranked 47th place.

3283
02:22:43,822 --> 02:22:44,862
In 47th place?

3284
02:22:45,892 --> 02:22:46,892
Who could it be?

3285
02:22:47,592 --> 02:22:49,432
I can't even imagine who it might be.

3286
02:22:50,062 --> 02:22:51,261
(52nd, Guo Zhen, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

3287
02:22:51,262 --> 02:22:52,262
Who is it?

3288
02:22:52,263 --> 02:22:53,548
(60th, Aoshi, Week 3 Interim Ranking)

3289
02:22:53,572 --> 02:22:55,132
The participant in 47th place.

3290
02:22:55,872 --> 02:22:58,802
Among PLANET K and PLANET C,

3291
02:22:59,612 --> 02:23:00,692
this person is in PLANET...

3292
02:23:02,042 --> 02:23:03,042
K.

3293
02:23:03,612 --> 02:23:04,642
K?

3294
02:23:05,142 --> 02:23:06,182
C?

3295
02:23:06,482 --> 02:23:08,082
- C? - PLANET...

3296
02:23:09,152 --> 02:23:10,252
K.

3297
02:23:13,392 --> 02:23:15,652
Who will it be from PLANET K?

3298
02:23:16,192 --> 02:23:18,361
Also, in the 1-on-1 Class Battle...

3299
02:23:18,362 --> 02:23:19,992
for personal positions,

3300
02:23:20,292 --> 02:23:22,132
this person came close but lost.

3301
02:23:22,802 --> 02:23:25,131
- He lost? - He lost 1-on-1.

3302
02:23:25,132 --> 02:23:26,172
Oh, 1-on-1?

3303
02:23:26,202 --> 02:23:29,102
(During the 1-on-1 Class Battle result announcement, )

3304
02:23:29,172 --> 02:23:31,041
(the participant who ranked 47th place...)

3305
02:23:31,042 --> 02:23:33,542
(lost in the personal position battle.)

3306
02:23:34,472 --> 02:23:35,472
Daniel?

3307
02:23:35,872 --> 02:23:37,682
Daniel was so close but lost.

3308
02:23:37,842 --> 02:23:39,451
(Kim Daniel lost the 1st sub-vocalist position...)

3309
02:23:39,452 --> 02:23:41,081
(by only 6 points for "Whiplash.")

3310
02:23:41,082 --> 02:23:42,152
Please.

3311
02:23:42,982 --> 02:23:44,852
- Oh, is it Harry? - Harry?

3312
02:23:45,052 --> 02:23:47,068
- Harry lost by a small difference. - I think it might be Harry.

3313
02:23:47,092 --> 02:23:48,521
(Han Harry June lost by 15 votes...)

3314
02:23:48,522 --> 02:23:50,522
(in the first sub-rapper battle for "Rising Sun.")

3315
02:23:50,922 --> 02:23:52,092
Gosh, please, Harry.

3316
02:23:54,532 --> 02:23:57,861
I will reveal the surviving participant in 47th place...

3317
02:23:57,862 --> 02:23:58,931
as a result of the global vote.

3318
02:23:58,932 --> 02:24:00,232
(47th place)

3319
02:24:00,672 --> 02:24:03,642
The participant who, at 47th place, will get to dramatically survive...

3320
02:24:08,672 --> 02:24:09,982
It's Han Harry June.

3321
02:24:10,082 --> 02:24:13,081
(Han Harry June survives in 47th place.)

3322
02:24:13,082 --> 02:24:15,312
- I told you! - Harry!

3323
02:24:15,682 --> 02:24:16,822
It's Han Harry June.

3324
02:24:17,782 --> 02:24:19,721
- My gosh! Harry! - I told you!

3325
02:24:19,722 --> 02:24:21,021
- I told you! - My goodness.

3326
02:24:21,022 --> 02:24:22,862
- I knew you would make it! - Congratulations!

3327
02:24:23,762 --> 02:24:24,762
It's Han Harry June.

3328
02:24:24,763 --> 02:24:28,431
(The participants, except for the 4 candidates for 48th place, )

3329
02:24:28,432 --> 02:24:29,602
(are eliminated.)

3330
02:24:30,862 --> 02:24:32,831
(The participants sincerely congratulate Han Harry June...)

3331
02:24:32,832 --> 02:24:35,332
(on his survival at 47th place.)

3332
02:24:40,712 --> 02:24:41,772
Harry.

3333
02:24:42,682 --> 02:24:43,912
Hey, take good care of Harry.

3334
02:24:44,612 --> 02:24:46,882
Participant Han Harry June, please come to the front.

3335
02:24:47,552 --> 02:24:49,012
Participant Han Harry June,

3336
02:24:49,182 --> 02:24:52,052
as a talented dancer acknowledged by the Masters,

3337
02:24:52,692 --> 02:24:55,391
helped his colleagues in every way he could.

3338
02:24:55,392 --> 02:24:57,122
Congratulations on your survival.

3339
02:24:58,462 --> 02:25:00,062
Seriously, to be honest,

3340
02:25:00,262 --> 02:25:02,092
I had given up on everything.

3341
02:25:02,292 --> 02:25:03,602
I had given up,

3342
02:25:03,662 --> 02:25:06,432
but another great opportunity has come to me.

3343
02:25:06,632 --> 02:25:09,642
I can only think that I should work even harder.

3344
02:25:09,802 --> 02:25:10,972
Also,

3345
02:25:11,242 --> 02:25:13,571
Heui Chan.

3346
02:25:13,572 --> 02:25:16,812
I really relied on him a lot,

3347
02:25:16,882 --> 02:25:18,482
and I love that guy so much.

3348
02:25:18,612 --> 02:25:22,752
I'll try even harder for Heui Chan's sake...

3349
02:25:23,122 --> 02:25:25,921
and do my best so that I can shine brighter on stage.

3350
02:25:25,922 --> 02:25:29,862
And to the Star Creators who gave me another chance,

3351
02:25:30,192 --> 02:25:32,192
I want to thank them.

3352
02:25:32,362 --> 02:25:33,461
Thank you.

3353
02:25:33,462 --> 02:25:34,492
You're so cool.

3354
02:25:38,762 --> 02:25:40,872
Please move to your seat.

3355
02:25:40,932 --> 02:25:42,402
- Gosh, seriously! - Good job.

3356
02:25:43,272 --> 02:25:44,572
- Congratulations. - Harry.

3357
02:25:45,942 --> 02:25:49,941
Guys, take good care of Harry.

3358
02:25:49,942 --> 02:25:51,042
(Right then, )

3359
02:25:52,212 --> 02:25:56,052
(Han Harry June returns to the seats where they wait for announcements.)

3360
02:25:57,322 --> 02:25:58,382
Come here.

3361
02:25:59,992 --> 02:26:00,992
It's okay.

3362
02:26:00,993 --> 02:26:03,633
(He shares a final goodbye with his group member, Yang Heui Chan.)

3363
02:26:04,162 --> 02:26:05,522
- I'll do a good job. - Of course.

3364
02:26:06,062 --> 02:26:07,492
I'm about to cry.

3365
02:26:07,532 --> 02:26:08,532
Don't cry.

3366
02:26:08,662 --> 02:26:09,702
Show them!

3367
02:26:10,662 --> 02:26:13,532
(Show them.)

3368
02:26:15,602 --> 02:26:16,602
Let's go.

3369
02:26:17,972 --> 02:26:21,512
(His heart is heavy to see DKB member, Heui Chan's elimination.)

3370
02:26:27,352 --> 02:26:29,522
I'm really glad that Harry made it, at least.

3371
02:26:32,552 --> 02:26:34,422
All of the announcements are over...

3372
02:26:35,022 --> 02:26:38,262
except for the last one.

3373
02:26:40,092 --> 02:26:41,361
No.

3374
02:26:41,362 --> 02:26:42,538
(Candidate 1 for the final survivor at 48th place: Zhang Shun Yu)

3375

What will the result be?

3381
02:27:03,122 --> 02:27:04,751
Among the four participants,

3382
02:27:04,752 --> 02:27:06,622
sadly, three participants...

3383
02:27:06,792 --> 02:27:08,721
must leave this place today.

3384

3385

(although he ranked so close at 51st place.)

3403
02:28:06,882 --> 02:28:08,212
It's Zhang Shun Yu.

3404
02:28:10,722 --> 02:28:11,922
Hey, it's okay.

3405
02:28:15,392 --> 02:28:16,462
You did a good job.

Gosh, he worked so hard.

3425
02:29:24,422 --> 02:29:26,061

3426
02:29:26,062 --> 02:29:29,032
Will sadly be leaving BOYS II PLANET.

3427

between the two remaining participants,

3430
02:29:43,342 --> 02:29:46,552
I will announce the last survivor in 48th place.

3431
02:29:47,052 --> 02:29:49,282
If you get eliminated in 49th place, it'll be so...

3432
02:29:51,922 --> 02:29:54,242
It'll be so disappointing to get eliminated at this point.

3433
02:29:57,522 --> 02:29:59,832
The candidates for 48th place are Yoon Min...

3434
02:30:00,232 --> 02:30:01,592
and Lee Dong Heon.

3435
02:30:02,462 --> 02:30:05,401

3436
02:30:05,402 --> 02:30:07,802
by the Star Creators is...

3437
02:30:08,932 --> 02:30:13,142
(To be continued)

3438
02:30:13,518 --> 02:30:15,948

The last survivor in 48th place who got chosen...

3441
02:30:21,382 --> 02:30:23,822
by the Star Creators is...

3442
02:30:25,992 --> 02:30:27,092
Yoon Min.

3443
02:30:27,222 --> 02:30:31,462
(Yoon Min survives last in 48th place.)

3444
02:30:31,692 --> 02:30:32,832
Yoon Min.

3445
02:30:36,102 --> 02:30:37,701
Congratulations.

3446
02:30:37,702 --> 02:30:38,732

Yoon Min.

3449
02:30:53,552 --> 02:30:56,892
With his outstanding talent in all fields...

3450
02:30:57,152 --> 02:31:00,022
including vocal, rap, and dance,

3451
02:31:00,122 --> 02:31:02,562
Yoon Min is judged to be an all-rounder by everyone.

3452
02:31:03,292 --> 02:31:04,692
Congratulations on surviving.

3453
02:31:05,432 --> 02:31:08,132
The thing is, I'm not the type...

3454
02:31:08,432 --> 02:31:10,902
to have regrets about the decisions I made.

3455
02:31:11,072 --> 02:31:13,302
But when I thought about leaving the show,

3456
02:31:13,572 --> 02:31:16,301
I realized that not having a chance to sing properly here...

3457
02:31:16,302 --> 02:31:18,312
would make me regretful.

3458
02:31:18,442 --> 02:31:21,512
Since I've been picked as the last survivor today,

3459
02:31:21,982 --> 02:31:24,882
I'll give an impressive performance in the next round...

3460
02:31:25,012 --> 02:31:26,882
for the friends who are leaving early.

3461
02:31:27,122 --> 02:31:28,122
Thank you.

3462
02:31:30,892 --> 02:31:32,422
I'm the oldest one on the show.

3463
02:31:32,852 --> 02:31:35,361
I had many thoughts before entering the show.

3464
02:31:35,362 --> 02:31:38,462
I wondered if I'd take away the younger participants' chances.

3465
02:31:39,262 --> 02:31:40,361
I had many thoughts.

3466
02:31:40,362 --> 02:31:44,632
But I came here and ran diligently toward the goal with the others.

3467
02:31:44,772 --> 02:31:47,872
I had so much fun and learned many things.

3468
02:31:48,302 --> 02:31:51,242
I received incredible energy,

3469
02:31:51,442 --> 02:31:53,282
I love you guys. Thank you for your hard work.

3470
02:32:00,282 --> 02:32:03,722
As a result of the Star Creators' global voting,

3471

forty-eight participants survived...

3472
02:32:06,622 --> 02:32:10,392
to continue on with their journey to be the best boy group in K-pop.

02:33:08,522 --> 02:33:10,592
(10th, Kang Woo Jin, 9th, He Xin Long, )

3504
02:33:10,692 --> 02:33:12,421
(8th, Masato, 7th, Yoo Kang Min, 6th, Chuei Li Yu, )

3505
02:33:12,422 --> 02:33:14,191

3506
02:33:14,192 --> 02:33:18,061
(3rd, Chung Sang Hyeon, 2nd, Zhou An Xin, )

3507
02:33:18,062 --> 02:33:20,502
(1st, Lee Sang Won)

3508
02:33:21,132 --> 02:33:24,972
This is the result of the Star Creators' global voting.

3509
02:33:25,572 --> 02:33:27,342
The 48 survivors...

3510
02:33:28,002 --> 02:33:31,412
will prepare for a new mission to reach a higher place.

3511
02:33:33,012 --> 02:33:35,342
Also, BOYS II PLANET's...

3512
02:33:35,482 --> 02:33:39,312
third global voting will begin anew.

3513
02:33:39,582 --> 02:33:42,822
(Third global voting)

3514
02:33:44,022 --> 02:33:46,592
Please root for the boys who are waiting for your support...

3515
02:33:47,392 --> 02:33:50,632
through your precious votes.

3516
02:33:51,532 --> 02:33:55,862
Now, BOYS II PLANET's third global voting...

3517
02:33:56,832 --> 02:33:57,872
will begin.

3518
02:34:04,642 --> 02:34:06,041
The voting begins now.

3519
02:34:06,042 --> 02:34:07,282
(Third global voting is open.)

3520
02:34:11,812 --> 02:34:13,282
Star Creators around the world,

3521
02:34:13,482 --> 02:34:16,822
the third global voting that will decide who will enter...

3522
02:34:17,122 --> 02:34:19,652
the semi-final of BOYS II PLANET has begun.

3523
02:34:20,062 --> 02:34:22,262
You can participate in the third global voting...

3524
02:34:22,762 --> 02:34:25,232
on the official platform, Mnet Plus,

3525
02:34:25,392 --> 02:34:27,432
once a day.

3526
02:34:28,462 --> 02:34:30,402
Enter the BOYS II PLANET page,

3527
02:34:30,802 --> 02:34:32,101
(Participate in the 3rd global voting!)

3528
02:34:32,102 --> 02:34:33,442
click on the vote button,

3529
02:34:34,702 --> 02:34:37,011
and choose a total of five participants.

3530
02:34:37,012 --> 02:34:38,141
(Submit votes)

3531
02:34:38,142 --> 02:34:40,542
When you click on "Submit votes" at the bottom,

3532
02:34:41,012 --> 02:34:44,452
you'll receive a voting certificate. Then the voting process is complete.

3533
02:34:45,052 --> 02:34:47,682
Votes from Korea will make up for 50 percent...

3534
02:34:47,782 --> 02:34:49,821
and votes from other areas will make up for 50 percent...

3535
02:34:49,822 --> 02:34:50,822
of the result.

3536
02:34:51,452 --> 02:34:54,691
All votes will be converted into points.

3537
02:34:54,692 --> 02:34:55,761
(The voting process and results of BOYS II PLANET...)

3538
02:34:55,762 --> 02:34:56,961
(will be verified by Samil PwC, an external agency.)

3539
02:34:56,962 --> 02:35:00,362
The 3rd global voting will close at 10am...

3540
02:35:00,632 --> 02:35:02,662
on August 29, 2025.

3541
02:35:04,172 --> 02:35:06,572
Among the participants who will survive through the voting,

3542
02:35:07,042 --> 02:35:09,242
one will be the last survivor at the very bottom.

3543
02:35:09,602 --> 02:35:11,612
At 3pm, Friday,

3544
02:35:11,972 --> 02:35:13,381
on August 29, 2025,

3545
02:35:13,382 --> 02:35:16,282
this person will be decided through the Last Survivor Live Voting...

3546
02:35:16,412 --> 02:35:19,412
during the live streaming of the Second Survivor Announcement.

3547
02:35:20,052 --> 02:35:21,681
Star Creators around the world,

3548
02:35:21,682 --> 02:35:24,392
vote for the boys who ignite the fire in your heart.

3549
02:35:27,162 --> 02:35:29,822
(After the First Survivor Announcement)

3550
02:35:31,932 --> 02:35:32,992
You worked hard.

3551
02:35:35,332 --> 02:35:37,702
Guys, the oldest participant is leaving.

3552
02:35:37,972 --> 02:35:39,231
- Bye. - Thank you for your hard work.

3553
02:35:39,232 --> 02:35:40,571
Thank you for your hard work.

3554
02:35:40,572 --> 02:35:41,641
- Well done. - Well done.

3555
02:35:41,642 --> 02:35:43,411
- Well done, Dong Heon. - All right.

3556
02:35:43,412 --> 02:35:44,871
(Some show tears.)

3557
02:35:44,872 --> 02:35:45,872
Thank you for your hard work.

3558
02:35:45,873 --> 02:35:47,782
(Some show tears.)

3559
02:35:48,412 --> 02:35:49,412
You did well.

3560
02:35:50,712 --> 02:35:54,282
(Some accept the parting in a calm manner.)

3561
02:35:54,552 --> 02:35:55,652
Hey,

3562
02:35:56,522 --> 02:35:58,422
don't struggle because I'm gone.

3563
02:35:59,122 --> 02:36:00,462
Where is Hu Bao?

3564
02:36:01,122 --> 02:36:03,362
Hu Bao!

3565
02:36:03,363 --> 02:36:04,932
(Hu Bao is Hu Han Wen, )

3566
02:36:05,692 --> 02:36:09,662
(The newly formed friendship needs to be halted for a moment.)

3567
02:36:11,702 --> 02:36:12,832
Love you.

3568
02:36:14,302 --> 02:36:16,102
I'm going now. You need to fight on.

3569
02:36:16,542 --> 02:36:18,972
You're the only one left from "KILL THE ROMEO" Team Two.

3570
02:36:20,312 --> 02:36:21,712
Guo Zhen.

3571
02:36:22,712 --> 02:36:25,051
I'm okay. You should look after yourself.

3572
02:36:25,052 --> 02:36:27,452
- Well done. - Well done.

3573
02:36:27,682 --> 02:36:29,882
Why are you crying?

3574
02:36:30,752 --> 02:36:32,692
I can't suppress my tears at times like this.

3575
02:36:32,822 --> 02:36:34,321
I can't help but cry.

3576
02:36:34,322 --> 02:36:37,392
(Feeling sorry and disappointed makes him tear up.)

3577
02:36:39,792 --> 02:36:41,402
Have confidence. Cheer up.

3578
02:36:42,162 --> 02:36:44,432
We'll cheer up, so you need to cheer up as well.

3579
02:36:45,872 --> 02:36:47,572
Thank you. I'm glad that I met you here.

3580
02:36:49,442 --> 02:36:50,472
I'll get going.

3581
02:36:52,112 --> 02:36:53,642
Jae Hyun, work hard.

3582
02:36:54,712 --> 02:36:55,812
Fight on.

3583
02:36:56,512 --> 02:36:57,612
I'll root for you.

3584
02:36:58,452 --> 02:37:00,422
I have no regrets, but I'm disappointed.

3585
02:37:02,122 --> 02:37:06,052
I think BOYS II PLANET is the beginning of my dream.

3586
02:37:06,222 --> 02:37:09,322
I had a live performance for the first time on the show.

3587
02:37:09,622 --> 02:37:12,092
I met my fans for the first time on the show.

3588
02:37:13,062 --> 02:37:16,502
It was really nice because I could feel that...

3589
02:37:16,832 --> 02:37:19,232
this was what I truly wanted to do.

3590
02:37:19,472 --> 02:37:22,542
Thank you for giving me the best memories.

3591
02:37:23,002 --> 02:37:24,572
It was like a dream.

3592
02:37:27,282 --> 02:37:29,912
My dream ended at BOYS II PLANET,

3593
02:37:30,212 --> 02:37:32,512
but it didn't end entirely.

3594
02:37:32,812 --> 02:37:34,181
I believe...

3595
02:37:34,182 --> 02:37:37,352
that the stage that ended here will begin someplace else.

3596
02:37:37,592 --> 02:37:39,021
I'll work harder...

3597
02:37:39,022 --> 02:37:40,942
so that I can debut and meet other participants.

3598
02:37:41,122 --> 02:37:43,792
I won't give up on this dream.

3599
02:37:46,732 --> 02:37:47,861
One, two, three.

3600
02:37:47,862 --> 02:37:51,372
- Boys, max the power! - Boys, max the power!

3601
02:37:55,842 --> 02:38:00,982
(We root for the participants' dream that will burn strongly.)

3602
02:38:01,282 --> 02:38:03,442
The second class battle of BOYS II PLANET is...

3603
02:38:03,652 --> 02:38:05,511
(The 2nd class battle begins! The Class Switch Position Battle)

3604
02:38:05,512 --> 02:38:07,181
(The class is for stealing.)

3605
02:38:07,182 --> 02:38:08,751
(Seriously, this is...)

3606
02:38:08,752 --> 02:38:09,752
(a chance to turn the tables!)

3607
02:38:09,753 --> 02:38:11,151
(The result of the mission...)

3608
02:38:11,152 --> 02:38:12,252
(will change the class.)

3609
02:38:12,552 --> 02:38:16,391
(Anxiety looms over them.)

3610
02:38:16,392 --> 02:38:20,062
(Everyone, pay attention!)

3611
02:38:23,132 --> 02:38:24,732
(He Zhong Xing will be the leader.)

3612
02:38:25,032 --> 02:38:26,032
A round of applause.

3613
02:38:26,432 --> 02:38:28,571
(This is a mistake.)

3614
02:38:28,773 --> 02:38:31,412
(He Zhong Xing wants to leave the show.)

3615
02:38:31,512 --> 02:38:36,082
(The beginning of the intense drama)

3616
02:38:38,282 --> 02:38:39,382
Come here.

3617
02:38:39,482 --> 02:38:44,122
(The conflict escalates.)

3618
02:38:44,952 --> 02:38:47,121
(But where is...)

3619
02:38:47,122 --> 02:38:49,662
(the killing part?)

3620
02:38:51,162 --> 02:38:54,762
(Will the All Star participants be able to keep their class?)

3621
02:38:54,862 --> 02:38:57,301
(Next week, )

3622
02:38:57,302 --> 02:39:06,712
(the fancy performances will begin!)

3623
02:39:07,612 --> 02:39:11,152
(New songs for the semi-final will be revealed.)

3624
02:39:11,412 --> 02:39:13,582
(New song for the semi-final, "Lucky MACHO")

3625
02:39:13,682 --> 02:39:15,851
("Lucky MACHO")

3626
02:39:15,852 --> 02:39:23,761
(A hybrid hip-hop song that's based on trap and Miami bass...)

3627
02:39:23,762 --> 02:39:31,601
(which changes up the atmosphere many times...)

3628
02:39:31,602 --> 02:39:39,412
(through daring transitions)

3629
02:39:39,612 --> 02:39:41,812
(New song for the semi-final, "Chains")

3630
02:39:41,912 --> 02:39:43,911
("Chains")

3631
02:39:43,912 --> 02:39:51,912
(A song with the harmony between the dreamy piano sounds...)

3632
02:39:51,922 --> 02:39:59,922
(and heavy bass which delivers delicate emotions...)

3633
02:39:59,932 --> 02:40:07,932
(of people who are in intense atmosphere)

3634
02:40:13,212 --> 02:40:15,412
(New song for the semi-final, "Sugar HIGH")

3635
02:40:15,512 --> 02:40:17,551
("Sugar HIGH")

3636
02:40:17,552 --> 02:40:25,551
(A hybrid pop song which delivers the rhythmical expression...)

3637
02:40:25,552 --> 02:40:33,552
(of the first taste of sweet love...)

3638
02:40:33,562 --> 02:40:41,562
(through stylish and refreshing sounds)

3639
02:40:43,672 --> 02:40:45,842
(New song for the semi-final, "MAIN DISH")

3640
02:40:45,972 --> 02:40:48,081
("MAIN DISH")

3641
02:40:48,082 --> 02:40:54,751
(A song with explosive energy which delivers the ambition...)

3642
02:40:54,752 --> 02:41:01,391
(of becoming the main character through the old school vibe...)

3643
02:41:01,392 --> 02:41:08,032
(and the powerful beat with a mix of rock sounds)

3644
02:41:08,502 --> 02:41:11,801
Star Creators, you can participate in...

3645
02:41:11,802 --> 02:41:13,771
the New Song Matching Mission for the Semi-Final...

3646
02:41:13,772 --> 02:41:15,741
on the official platform, Mnet Plus, once.

3647
02:41:15,742 --> 02:41:17,672
(You can participate in it once.)

3648
02:41:18,012 --> 02:41:19,972
Enter the BOYS II PLANET page...

3649
02:41:20,242 --> 02:41:22,802
and click on the banner that reads, "New Song Matching Mission."

3650
02:41:23,182 --> 02:41:25,851
Select the participants who suit the new songs...

3651
02:41:25,852 --> 02:41:29,052
and click the "Submit" button. Then the participation is complete.

3652
02:41:29,852 --> 02:41:33,791
The New Song Matching Mission will close at 10am on August 16.

3653
02:41:33,792 --> 02:41:36,352
(The New Song Matching Mission will close at 10am on August 16.)
