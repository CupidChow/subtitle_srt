1
00:00:01,847 --> 00:00:03,446
(The 2nd mission of BOYS II PLANET, )

2
00:00:03,447 --> 00:00:05,317
(Class Switch Position Battle)

3
00:00:06,717 --> 00:00:08,416
(Regardless of the class, )

4
00:00:08,417 --> 00:00:11,857
(the members came together as teams and gave legendary performances.)

5
00:00:13,897 --> 00:00:15,257
The team that placed first is...

6
00:00:15,497 --> 00:00:17,273
(Team "LALALALA" placed 1st in the dance position.)

7
00:00:17,297 --> 00:00:18,326
(I'm so happy.)

8
00:00:18,327 --> 00:00:19,496
(I don't know if it's a dream...)

9
00:00:19,497 --> 00:00:20,796
(or a reality.)

10
00:00:20,797 --> 00:00:24,137
(After short-lived happiness, horror comes to them suddenly.)

11
00:00:25,137 --> 00:00:27,837
(Is there someone else in here besides us?)

12
00:00:31,877 --> 00:00:33,577
(Go down.)

13
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:37,117
(Go up.)

14
00:00:37,817 --> 00:00:43,357
(24 participants)

15
00:00:43,587 --> 00:00:44,786
(All of them will be eliminated!)

16
00:00:44,787 --> 00:00:47,426
(Their fates get divided at the Second Survivor Announcement.)

17
00:00:47,427 --> 00:00:49,127
(This is driving me crazy.)

18
00:00:55,367 --> 00:00:57,136
(There are times I hate myself.)

19
00:00:57,137 --> 00:00:59,907
(There are times I appear foolish.)

20
00:01:00,807 --> 00:01:02,577
(Who wants to try the killing part?)

21
00:01:03,447 --> 00:01:05,547
(So many participants want the killing part.)

22
00:01:06,877 --> 00:01:08,523
(Sang Won, aren't you going to go for it?)

23
00:01:08,547 --> 00:01:09,787
(Hey, go for the killing part.)

24
00:01:10,387 --> 00:01:11,486
(I don't have the confidence.)

25
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:15,017
(What happened to Lee Sang Won?)

26
00:01:36,237 --> 00:01:38,747
(Planet Camp)

27
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:42,377
(The rooms are empty.)

28
00:01:49,617 --> 00:01:52,387
(Where did the participants arrive late at night?)

29
00:01:58,797 --> 00:01:59,897
We're ruined.

30
00:02:02,797 --> 00:02:03,867
We're ruined.

31
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:06,237
- Hold on. - No.

32
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:07,576
Hold on.

33
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:08,577
(Shouting suddenly)

34
00:02:08,977 --> 00:02:10,007
What's going on?

35
00:02:11,147 --> 00:02:12,447
We're going to die!

36
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:15,277
Hey, is that a hospital?

37
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,477
- Is it an actual hospital? - It's game over.

38
00:02:19,547 --> 00:02:22,117
(A hospital that has been abandoned for a long time)

39
00:02:22,987 --> 00:02:24,857
Now, you...

40
00:02:26,587 --> 00:02:29,057
will get locked up in a deserted hospital.

41
00:02:31,227 --> 00:02:32,367
No way.

42
00:02:32,397 --> 00:02:33,967
Stop it, Mnet.

43
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:35,837
Your final goal is...

44
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:38,707
escaping the deserted hospital.

45
00:02:39,237 --> 00:02:42,207
Do your best to succeed in the mission.

46
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:44,846
- It's like an escape room. - Okay.

47
00:02:44,847 --> 00:02:46,576
I can't do this. I'm bad at an escape room.

48
00:02:46,577 --> 00:02:48,116
Geon Woo, are you good at scary stuff?

49
00:02:48,117 --> 00:02:49,877
- I'm really bad at it. - Same here.

50
00:02:50,117 --> 00:02:51,887
If you fail to escape...

51
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:55,257
Do we die?

52
00:02:55,557 --> 00:02:58,927
You'll need to spend the night inside the deserted hospital.

53
00:03:01,257 --> 00:03:02,296
Will we sleep here?

54
00:03:02,297 --> 00:03:03,967
That's just wrong.

55
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:08,267
Make sure to escape the hospital.

56
00:03:08,937 --> 00:03:11,937
(Horror Mission: Escape the Deserted Hospital)

57
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:14,276
The preliminary match begins now.

58
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,797
(Preliminary Match, Find the Name Tag)

59
00:03:16,637 --> 00:03:17,706
(Only 24 out of 48 participants escape...)

60
00:03:17,707 --> 00:03:18,987
(through the Preliminary Match.)

61
00:03:19,147 --> 00:03:20,976
(You can watch the Preliminary Match of the Deserted Hospital Escape...)

62
00:03:20,977 --> 00:03:22,417
(online on Tuesday, September 9.)

63
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:23,916
(24 participants escape the deserted hospital...)

64
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:26,247
(through the Preliminary Match.)

65
00:03:26,817 --> 00:03:28,886
(And 24 participants fail to escape.)

66
00:03:28,887 --> 00:03:31,657
To your right are the rules...

67
00:03:32,487 --> 00:03:33,827
of the hospital.

68
00:03:33,997 --> 00:03:34,997
That must be it.

69
00:03:34,998 --> 00:03:37,527
(The rules of the hospital await the 24 participants.)

70
00:03:38,527 --> 00:03:40,096
"General rules of the hospital."

71
00:03:40,097 --> 00:03:43,567
"Visits are allowed from 9am to 8pm."

72
00:03:44,637 --> 00:03:46,166
Then at 9am...

73
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:48,076
It's from 9am to 8pm.

74
00:03:48,077 --> 00:03:49,077
Afterward...

75
00:04:01,557 --> 00:04:03,886
- Hold on! - What?

76
00:04:03,887 --> 00:04:06,027
(Welcome. Is it your first time at the hospital?)

77
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:09,527
Now,

78
00:04:11,997 --> 00:04:13,797
the horror survival variety show,

79
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,407
- Hide-and-Seek will begin. - Please.

80
00:04:17,537 --> 00:04:18,707
Hurry up and go!

81
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:22,376
For 4,444 seconds,

82
00:04:22,377 --> 00:04:24,277
avoid the seeker ghosts...

83
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,177
and play Hide-and-Seek.

84
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:30,186
As you avoid the ghosts,

85
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:34,557
you must find eight puzzle pieces for escape.

86
00:04:35,257 --> 00:04:36,956
The participant who gets caught by a seeker...

87
00:04:36,957 --> 00:04:38,687
will get eliminated immediately.

88
00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:40,997
Then he'll get locked up in prison.

89
00:04:41,557 --> 00:04:44,627
Once you find all eight puzzle pieces,

90
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:48,067
you can escape from this hospital.

91
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:51,267
Let's go.

92
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:53,507
Now,

93
00:04:54,237 --> 00:04:55,907
let's begin.

94
00:04:59,347 --> 00:05:03,987
(BOYS II PLANET, Hide-and-Seek)

95
00:05:05,447 --> 00:05:08,216
(A seeker begins to move from the 3rd floor.)

96
00:05:08,217 --> 00:05:09,916
(Tatsuki, Park Dong Gyu, Yi Chen, and He Zhong Xing...)

97
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:12,157
(are looking for the puzzle pieces on the 2nd floor.)

98
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:15,197
I'm scared. I want to go home.

99
00:05:16,697 --> 00:05:18,566
(He suddenly hears bells.)

100
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:19,597
Oh, my.

101
00:05:21,397 --> 00:05:23,236
What's this sound?

102
00:05:23,237 --> 00:05:24,757
The bells must be attached to a ghost.

103
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:28,307
(A seeker begins to look for the participants.)

104
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:29,877
It's close.

105
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:35,277
Hey, I hear the bells.

106
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:39,187
It's coming.

107
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:40,957
Let's close the door.

108
00:05:41,487 --> 00:05:44,527
(Seeker shaman comes down to the 2nd floor.)

109
00:05:49,027 --> 00:05:50,396
(Following the traces of the participants, )

110
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:52,077
(he wanders around the deserted hospital.)

111
00:05:57,637 --> 00:06:01,177
(Unable to say anything, they hold their breath.)

112
00:06:01,877 --> 00:06:06,007
(The participants are hiding from the seeker.)

113
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:09,246
(Xue Su Ren, Kim Jun Min, and Jo Gye Hyeon...)

114
00:06:09,247 --> 00:06:10,846
(are searching the 1st floor.)

115
00:06:10,847 --> 00:06:11,847
Here.

116
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:19,887
Hold on. What are you doing here?

117
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:23,126
Let's search this place.

118
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:24,667
- Where are they? - Here.

119
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:27,967
(Xue Su Ren takes out a file from the shelf.)

120
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:29,996
(Something drops.)

121
00:06:29,997 --> 00:06:31,407
This isn't the exit.

122
00:06:32,637 --> 00:06:33,677
Hold on.

123
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:35,506
I found one.

124
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:36,706
(They find a puzzle piece.)

125
00:06:36,707 --> 00:06:37,777
I found one.

126
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:39,807
Let's go first.

127
00:06:41,147 --> 00:06:42,546
Where is the exit?

128
00:06:42,547 --> 00:06:44,447
Here. Come.

129
00:06:45,117 --> 00:06:47,917
(They carefully avoid the seeker to approach the exit.)

130
00:06:53,557 --> 00:06:55,997
Okay.

131
00:06:58,027 --> 00:06:59,066
All done.

132
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:00,443
(They put a puzzle piece by the exit on the 1st floor.)

133
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:02,937
Go in there.

134
00:07:03,437 --> 00:07:05,107
Go. Let's get it.

135
00:07:05,737 --> 00:07:06,766
Let's get it.

136
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:08,136
It was in the lobby, right?

137
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:10,306
Gosh, I'm so smart.

138
00:07:10,307 --> 00:07:11,347
I mean...

139
00:07:13,507 --> 00:07:17,947
(Seeker)

140
00:07:18,217 --> 00:07:21,657
(The ward upstairs is silent as if nobody was there.)

141
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:24,956
(Dong Gyu and Zhong Xing are hiding there.)

142
00:07:24,957 --> 00:07:29,157
(They're hiding behind the curtain.)

143
00:07:32,297 --> 00:07:37,507
(Fortunately, the seeker doesn't see them and walks away.)

144
00:07:41,037 --> 00:07:45,377
(The seeker goes to another room.)

145
00:07:51,887 --> 00:07:55,887
(Multiple participants are hiding here.)

146
00:07:55,987 --> 00:08:00,026
(Leo)

147
00:08:00,027 --> 00:08:02,327
(The seeker walks right by Leo.)

148
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:08,567
(Screaming)

149
00:08:13,537 --> 00:08:14,607
(Screaming)

150
00:08:22,217 --> 00:08:23,477
I'm so scared.

151
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:26,317
I found you, Kim Si Hwan

152
00:08:26,517 --> 00:08:29,386
- Let's go downstairs. - Run.

153
00:08:29,387 --> 00:08:31,327
Go downstairs.

154
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:33,157
Go down.

155
00:08:37,127 --> 00:08:39,067
Go upstairs.

156
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,007
Close the door.

157
00:08:44,837 --> 00:08:46,606
(The seeker patient is on the 1st floor.)

158
00:08:46,607 --> 00:08:48,507
(The seeker shaman is on the 2nd floor.)

159
00:08:49,037 --> 00:08:50,777
Ready or not,

160
00:08:51,077 --> 00:08:52,607
here come the two seekers!

161
00:09:05,187 --> 00:09:06,426
There's a mirror.

162
00:09:06,427 --> 00:09:08,596
Now, I can check my looks.

163
00:09:08,597 --> 00:09:10,896
Check my looks.

164
00:09:10,897 --> 00:09:12,597
I look average today.

165
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:14,367
You've always been handsome.

166
00:09:14,697 --> 00:09:15,697
You too.

167
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:19,867
(Tense)

168
00:09:20,207 --> 00:09:25,107
(There's a seeker right next to them.)

169
00:09:33,147 --> 00:09:35,817
(The seeker moves to another room.)

170
00:09:37,187 --> 00:09:39,186
(Gye Hyeon)

171
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:41,157
(New Wing Reception Desk)

172
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:43,827
(The seekers are roaming the 1st floor.)

173
00:09:46,027 --> 00:09:47,637
I can't see it. Is this it?

174
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,667
This isn't it.

175
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:55,807
I found it.

176
00:09:56,737 --> 00:09:58,447
It was in a medicine bag.

177
00:09:58,677 --> 00:09:59,876
Let's see.

178
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:01,817
(Dong Gyu and Woo Jin)

179
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,047
I found one.

180
00:10:06,017 --> 00:10:08,556
- I'll go stick it. - Good.

181
00:10:08,557 --> 00:10:10,117
(Woo Jin found the third puzzle piece.)

182
00:10:14,027 --> 00:10:16,626
(Su Ren goes through every corner of the room.)

183
00:10:16,627 --> 00:10:18,926
I found another one!

184
00:10:18,927 --> 00:10:20,997
- I found one more. Hurry. - Let me see.

185
00:10:21,097 --> 00:10:22,596
(A new seeker enters the 1st floor.)

186
00:10:22,597 --> 00:10:24,637
This is terrifying. I can't do this.

187
00:10:25,837 --> 00:10:26,837
They're here.

188
00:10:26,838 --> 00:10:28,737
They're coming! Close the door!

189
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,407
(Zi Hao swiftly runs away.)

190
00:10:32,547 --> 00:10:33,707
He's big.

191
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,317
He is.

192
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,046
Is he a bodybuilder?

193
00:10:37,047 --> 00:10:38,446
I bet he's 190cm tall.

194
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:39,887
A 190-centimeter-tall seeker?

195
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:42,087
We'll be beaten to death if he catches us.

196
00:10:45,827 --> 00:10:49,527
(Dong Yun and Jun Seo are on the 1st floor.)

197
00:10:56,637 --> 00:10:58,957
(Two seekers close in on them from both ends of the hall.)

198
00:11:00,737 --> 00:11:03,947
(Screaming and running away)

199
00:11:05,947 --> 00:11:07,616
We can't go downstairs.

200
00:11:07,617 --> 00:11:09,747
They're all down there.

201
00:11:13,347 --> 00:11:14,356
(Gye Hyeon confronts two seekers.)

202
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:16,486
Please don't catch me. Come on.

203
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:18,586
It's not fair if you all come for me!

204
00:11:18,587 --> 00:11:20,457
It hurts.

205
00:11:20,927 --> 00:11:23,326
Does it hurt? Guys, go away!

206
00:11:23,327 --> 00:11:25,627
(Other participants take the chance to run away.)

207
00:11:32,307 --> 00:11:35,307
(Sprinting to the 2nd floor)

208
00:11:40,347 --> 00:11:42,417
(Bursting open)

209
00:11:43,347 --> 00:11:45,187
(A silent scream)

210
00:11:49,487 --> 00:11:53,086
(Dong Yun and Dong Gyu are out.)

211
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,797
Dong Gyu!

212
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,897
I can't get out.

213
00:11:57,697 --> 00:12:01,237
(Heng Yu musters up his courage and escapes.)

214
00:12:05,137 --> 00:12:07,837
(He found a piece of the puzzle.)

215
00:12:15,347 --> 00:12:16,676
(Chen is out.)

216
00:12:16,677 --> 00:12:18,917
All right!

217
00:12:22,187 --> 00:12:24,627
(Sang Won is hiding in an awkward position.)

218
00:12:30,297 --> 00:12:31,626
You're out.

219
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,497
(Sang Won is out.)

220
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:35,797
Almost.

221
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:38,006
(Woo Jin, Geon Woo, Jun Min, )

222
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,367
(Zi Hao, Sen, Su Ren, and Heng Yu)

223
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:40,836
(Arctic, Jia Hao, Gye Hyeon, )

224
00:12:40,837 --> 00:12:42,797
(Bo Wen, Kai Wen, Tatsuki, Xin Long, and Han Wen)

225
00:12:45,847 --> 00:12:46,907
What's going on?

226
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:52,446
(The clock stops at 2,222 seconds.)

227
00:12:52,447 --> 00:12:55,457
(The seekers will be gone for 5 minutes now.)

228
00:12:58,087 --> 00:12:59,157
How many did we get?

229
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:02,197
- This must be it. - I found the moving one.

230
00:13:02,297 --> 00:13:03,297
How many?

231
00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:05,026
- One, two, three... - The big one.

232
00:13:05,027 --> 00:13:06,396
- We have four left. - Four more.

233
00:13:06,397 --> 00:13:08,766
- We need to go upstairs. - We're halfway there.

234
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:10,367
- Let's go. - Upstairs.

235
00:13:11,837 --> 00:13:13,666
The seekers are out. We can go now.

236
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,177
Please don't leave me alone.

237
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:18,406
We found two.

238
00:13:18,407 --> 00:13:20,407
- Two? Go downstairs. - Yes.

239
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:22,316
- Please don't leave me. - We need to find two more!

240
00:13:22,317 --> 00:13:23,376
Just two more!

241
00:13:23,377 --> 00:13:24,386
- Two more? - Two more?

242
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,786
- Yes, two more. - We're almost done, then. Let's go.

243
00:13:25,787 --> 00:13:26,847
Where are we going?

244
00:13:28,357 --> 00:13:30,117
It's game over.

245
00:13:32,227 --> 00:13:33,287
He left me again.

246
00:13:37,827 --> 00:13:39,097
We need two more.

247
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:40,997
Just two more.

248
00:13:42,867 --> 00:13:44,066
- Okay. - Two more.

249
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:45,706
(They only need 2 pieces to finish the puzzle.)

250
00:13:45,707 --> 00:13:47,477
This place is way too big, though.

251
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:49,276
I couldn't find it there. I looked through everywhere.

252
00:13:49,277 --> 00:13:50,337
Is it on the third floor?

253
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,077
(The siren goes off at that moment.)

254
00:13:53,347 --> 00:13:54,716
It's been five minutes.

255
00:13:54,717 --> 00:13:59,187
Ready or not, here we come.

256
00:13:59,787 --> 00:14:04,157
Ready or not, here we come.

257
00:14:04,257 --> 00:14:08,756
Ready or not, here we come.

258
00:14:08,757 --> 00:14:11,867
(The death angel joins as a seeker, so it's tougher to hide.)

259
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,407
(Rushing)

260
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:22,207
(The death angel follows immediately.)

261
00:14:22,307 --> 00:14:23,637
(The seekers move faster now.)

262
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:32,747
I caught you.

263
00:14:32,847 --> 00:14:35,757
(Sen is out.)

264
00:14:36,987 --> 00:14:38,756
Oh, I'm scared.

265
00:14:38,757 --> 00:14:39,886
(Survivors)

266
00:14:39,887 --> 00:14:41,326
(Li Zi Hao, He Xin Long, and Chen Kai Wen)

267
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:42,757
(3 survivors and 2 puzzle pieces)

268
00:14:43,057 --> 00:14:45,627
(Zi Hao found a box on the table.)

269
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:53,067
(Startled)

270
00:14:56,307 --> 00:15:00,577
(His legs gave out as he was startled.)

271
00:15:03,117 --> 00:15:05,446
(What's in the box?)

272
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:08,387
It's so gross. I put my hand in.

273
00:15:09,057 --> 00:15:11,287
- Did you find it? - Yes.

274
00:15:12,187 --> 00:15:14,456
- Is this the one? - It is.

275
00:15:14,457 --> 00:15:15,457
(Xin Long takes the piece out of the box instead.)

276
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,297
Why does it look so gross?

277
00:15:20,937 --> 00:15:22,867
(They're running out of time.)

278
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:33,207
(The hiders and the seekers)

279
00:15:36,847 --> 00:15:39,317
(They only need one more puzzle piece.)

280
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:42,887
(Did they find the final piece?)

281
00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:44,587
It's done!

282
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,926
(Zi Hao came with the final piece.)

283
00:15:46,927 --> 00:15:49,257
Okay. Let's go.

284
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:54,196
(The exit is open.)

285
00:15:54,197 --> 00:15:58,407
Xin Long! He's still inside.

286
00:16:03,237 --> 00:16:04,746
I'm the only one left.

287
00:16:04,747 --> 00:16:08,017
- Good work, everyone. - Good work.

288
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:13,317
(Goodbye.)

289
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:17,787
(Next time, you won't be able to escape.)

290
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:19,087
Escaped!

291
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:22,296
Let's go!

292
00:16:22,297 --> 00:16:24,396
(Sharing the joy of going home)

293
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:25,667
Let's go!

294
00:16:26,297 --> 00:16:28,567
Let's go!

295
00:16:29,037 --> 00:16:30,297
Let's go!

296
00:16:31,767 --> 00:16:34,676
(Xin Long is relieved and trudges out.)

297
00:16:34,677 --> 00:16:36,206
Let's go!

298
00:16:36,207 --> 00:16:37,207
(Approaching)

299
00:16:40,877 --> 00:16:41,877
(Screaming)

300
00:16:42,947 --> 00:16:44,176
(Check out the behind-the-scenes video of the Hide-and-Seek...)

301
00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:45,286
(on Mnet Plus on Tuesday, September 9)

302
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:46,317
I'm sorry!

303
00:16:46,717 --> 00:16:50,957
Why?

304
00:16:51,787 --> 00:16:56,027
(Episode 8: You And I Soar High)

305
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:01,837
(The Second Survivor Announcement has finally begun.)

306
00:17:02,697 --> 00:17:05,637
(Only 24 participants will be chosen by the Star Creators.)

307
00:17:06,437 --> 00:17:08,706
(The Top 8 are on the verge of their debut.)

308
00:17:08,707 --> 00:17:10,977
(And the final survivor, number 24)

309
00:17:11,977 --> 00:17:15,047
(Which participant will get to keep following his dreams?)

310
00:17:17,317 --> 00:17:19,287
(Second Survivor Announcement)

311
00:17:21,117 --> 00:17:23,187
(The first team enters with a sigh.)

312
00:17:23,317 --> 00:17:26,227
We're smiling more than we're sighing now. We are...

313
00:17:26,627 --> 00:17:28,597
- Team "Breathe." - Team "Breathe."

314
00:17:31,697 --> 00:17:33,617
- There they come. Who's that? - The cuddly cat.

315
00:17:35,937 --> 00:17:38,907
Hello. I'm...

316
00:17:46,977 --> 00:17:51,446
Hello. I'm from WAKEONE. I'm the cuddly cat who does hip-hop.

317
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:53,017
I'm Chung Sang Hyeon.

318
00:17:55,487 --> 00:17:57,627
- The cuddly cat. - The cuddly cat.

319
00:17:57,727 --> 00:17:59,607
- He's good. - He sounded just like Sang Hyeon.

320
00:17:59,987 --> 00:18:02,456
(I want to give you a peck on the cheek)

321
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,567
(I want to give you a hug)

322
00:18:04,827 --> 00:18:06,103
I want to give a peck on your cheek too.

323
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,567
(I can't let you do that.)

324
00:18:08,897 --> 00:18:10,566
(I'm holding it right in my hands)

325
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:12,007
(The microphone)

326
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:13,506
- "The microphone." - "The microphone."

327
00:18:13,507 --> 00:18:15,067
- "The microphone." - "The microphone."

328
00:18:15,777 --> 00:18:17,377
Hey, take your hands out of the pockets.

329
00:18:17,407 --> 00:18:18,946
- You do it 1st. - No, you go 1st.

330
00:18:18,947 --> 00:18:19,976
- You do it 1st. - You go 1st.

331
00:18:19,977 --> 00:18:20,977
- You do it 1st. - You do it 1st.

332
00:18:20,978 --> 00:18:22,178
(They're bickering intensely.)

333
00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:24,153
- You do it first. - Why are they fighting?

334
00:18:24,177 --> 00:18:25,216
Are they fighting again?

335
00:18:25,217 --> 00:18:27,217
(As the participants watch them bicker adorably, )

336
00:18:28,217 --> 00:18:32,487
(the ones who had a fight for real show up at that moment.)

337
00:18:33,927 --> 00:18:34,996
(Make yourself clear.)

338
00:18:34,997 --> 00:18:37,226
You're telling me to shut my mouth even if you do a bad job.

339
00:18:37,227 --> 00:18:38,227
What are you talking about?

340
00:18:38,228 --> 00:18:39,788
- What is your point? - I'm the leader.

341
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,437
(Team "Smoke" constantly fought without hesitation.)

342
00:18:43,397 --> 00:18:46,307
(Will they fight again today?)

343
00:18:47,777 --> 00:18:49,977
Give me a hug.

344
00:18:52,477 --> 00:18:54,247
(What's gotten into him?)

345
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:56,747
(Everyone is surprised by his unexpected gesture.)

346
00:18:58,217 --> 00:19:00,517
(Team "Smoke" shares a heartfelt hug.)

347
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,457
They must have made up.

348
00:19:05,487 --> 00:19:06,526
Thank you.

349
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:08,497
(The mood gets awkward after the hug.)

350
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:11,597
Sang Won, come here.

351
00:19:19,307 --> 00:19:21,607
Seriously. He looks handsome throughout the week.

352
00:19:21,737 --> 00:19:22,837
Come on.

353
00:19:24,507 --> 00:19:26,706
(They start walking on all fours all of a sudden.)

354
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,847
Oh, my gosh.

355
00:19:28,147 --> 00:19:29,746
(Team "LALALALA" put on an intense performance...)

356
00:19:29,747 --> 00:19:31,347
(with the werewolf concept.)

357
00:19:31,787 --> 00:19:33,787
Wait. It's a full moon.

358
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:36,287
Wait. It's a full moon.

359
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:40,057
A full moon?

360
00:19:40,687 --> 00:19:45,467
(Two wolves suddenly appear on stage.)

361
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:51,307
- They're werewolves. - Why are you guys trying so hard?

362
00:19:51,937 --> 00:19:53,366
- XXL - XXL

363
00:19:53,367 --> 00:19:54,636
That's our dream size.

364
00:19:54,637 --> 00:19:57,137
- We're Team XXS. - We're Team XXS.

365
00:19:57,537 --> 00:19:58,547
You guys can do it!

366
00:19:58,977 --> 00:20:00,297
Yun Seo, you still have a chance!

367
00:20:00,507 --> 00:20:02,016
Yun Seo, I don't think that's in the cards for you.

368
00:20:02,017 --> 00:20:03,677
(Yoo Kang Min, 174cm tall)

369
00:20:03,717 --> 00:20:04,747
It will be a challenge.

370
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:06,817
(Jun Lee Jeong, 178cm tall)

371
00:20:07,587 --> 00:20:10,587
(All the teams from all positions have entered.)

372
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:16,227
(It suddenly gets dark in the studio.)

373
00:20:16,897 --> 00:20:17,897
What's going on?

374
00:20:18,297 --> 00:20:19,397
What's going on?

375
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,896
- Who's pulling a prank on us? - This was sudden.

376
00:20:20,897 --> 00:20:22,497
- What's going on? - Is it a blackout?

377
00:20:22,737 --> 00:20:24,336
This show is sacred to us.

378
00:20:24,337 --> 00:20:26,107
Who would dare pull a prank like this?

379
00:20:29,577 --> 00:20:30,837
- No way. - What?

380
00:20:30,877 --> 00:20:32,447
Planet Master? Hey.

381
00:20:33,507 --> 00:20:34,577
What?

382
00:20:35,747 --> 00:20:37,217
- What is it? - What?

383
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:40,017
- What's going on? - What?

384
00:20:49,557 --> 00:20:52,227
(Planet Master SAN)

385
00:20:53,097 --> 00:20:55,196
(He's the lead vocalist...)

386
00:20:55,197 --> 00:20:57,297
(of the 4th-generation idol group, ATEEZ.)

387
00:20:58,737 --> 00:21:01,237
(Planet Master SAN)

388
00:21:04,307 --> 00:21:05,347
Check out his build.

389
00:21:05,377 --> 00:21:06,547
Gosh, his presence...

390
00:21:06,707 --> 00:21:08,016
- He's got a crazy presence. - This is crazy.

391
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,517
How can he look that good in a suit?

392
00:21:10,647 --> 00:21:11,687
He's so cool.

393
00:21:12,317 --> 00:21:14,017
His muscles are just insane.

394
00:21:15,717 --> 00:21:19,226
I'm the host of the Second Survivor Announcement.

395
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:21,957
I'm Planet Master SAN of ATEEZ.

396
00:21:24,227 --> 00:21:25,366
He's so cool.

397
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,967
I can't believe I'm seeing him in person.

398
00:21:28,967 --> 00:21:31,707
The Second Survivor Announcement of BOYS II PLANET...

399
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:33,267
will be held today.

400
00:21:35,507 --> 00:21:38,706
Solely based on the voting results of Star Creators,

401
00:21:38,707 --> 00:21:40,906
twenty-four participants out of forty-eight participants...

402
00:21:40,907 --> 00:21:42,776
will be ranked...

403
00:21:42,777 --> 00:21:45,546
and named All Stars who will move on as survivors.

404
00:21:45,547 --> 00:21:48,056
All of the Two Star participants...

405
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:50,487
ranked from 25th to 48th will be eliminated.

406
00:21:50,887 --> 00:21:53,227
Only the All Stars will get to remain on the show.

407
00:21:53,487 --> 00:21:54,927
I must be an All Star.

408
00:21:55,557 --> 00:21:57,457
They're eliminating so many participants.

409
00:21:58,327 --> 00:22:00,197
At the Second Survivor Announcement,

410
00:22:00,227 --> 00:22:03,166
the global vote counts and the benefit points...

411
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:04,466
from the second mission will be added...

412
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:06,267
which will decide the final survivors.

413
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:09,406
The participants divided into 12 teams...

414
00:22:09,407 --> 00:22:11,906
and executed a position they felt confident in.

415
00:22:11,907 --> 00:22:13,806
Through writing rap lyrics, arranging the songs,

416
00:22:13,807 --> 00:22:15,376
and creating choreography,

417
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:17,887
they clearly showcased their musical talent.

418
00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:20,446
As a result,

419
00:22:20,447 --> 00:22:23,487
twenty-four participants won the All Star class...

420
00:22:23,787 --> 00:22:25,787
and received 200,000 points as the benefit.

421
00:22:26,757 --> 00:22:29,796
Team "FAMOUS" won first place in the rap position.

422
00:22:29,797 --> 00:22:33,467
Team "Rose Blossom" won first place in the vocal position.

423
00:22:33,867 --> 00:22:36,737
Team "LALALALA" won first place in the dance position.

424
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:40,636
Everyone on the winning teams...

425
00:22:40,637 --> 00:22:43,177
received 50,000 points as the team benefit.

426
00:22:43,637 --> 00:22:45,347
Gosh, 50,000 points are a lot.

427
00:22:45,877 --> 00:22:47,876
Gosh, that could make a huge difference.

428
00:22:47,877 --> 00:22:48,917
Right.

429
00:22:49,817 --> 00:22:53,487
The participant in 24th place will be the lowest-ranked survivor.

430
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,656
The survivor will be chosen...

431
00:22:55,657 --> 00:22:58,056
based on the accumulated votes and the results...

432
00:22:58,057 --> 00:22:59,377
of the Last Survivor Live Voting.

433
00:22:59,857 --> 00:23:01,027
Please.

434
00:23:01,497 --> 00:23:02,627
My gosh.

435
00:23:03,057 --> 00:23:04,896
It will be the last spot to be an All Star.

436
00:23:04,897 --> 00:23:08,837
Which participant will survive in 24th place?

437
00:23:09,437 --> 00:23:14,137
(Candidates for the Last Survivor in 24th Place)

438
00:23:14,307 --> 00:23:15,737
I can't watch this.

439
00:23:16,637 --> 00:23:19,437
I hate being one of the candidates and not being one at the same time.

440
00:23:21,277 --> 00:23:23,776
I will now reveal the three candidates...

441
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,217
for the last survivor in 24th place.

442
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,747
Right now?

443
00:23:27,287 --> 00:23:30,087
Gosh, come on. Don't do that. I don't want to be one of them.

444
00:23:31,287 --> 00:23:32,647
Who would they be? I'm so nervous.

445
00:23:33,057 --> 00:23:34,526
Who are the candidates? I can't wait to find out.

446
00:23:34,527 --> 00:23:40,297
(Candidates for the Last Survivor in 24th Place)

447
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:42,696
(Park Dong Gyu, Fan Zhe Yi, Han Harry June)

448
00:23:42,697 --> 00:23:43,967
- What? - I'm suddenly nervous.

449
00:23:45,567 --> 00:23:46,837
- What? - I'm suddenly nervous.

450
00:23:48,907 --> 00:23:49,907
For real?

451
00:23:51,477 --> 00:23:52,777
Participant Park Dong Gyu.

452
00:23:53,277 --> 00:23:54,507
Participant Fan Zhe Yi.

453
00:23:54,777 --> 00:23:57,417
And Participant Han Harry June.

454
00:23:58,387 --> 00:24:00,067
Oh, no. I feel bad for Dong Gyu and Harry.

455
00:24:02,017 --> 00:24:04,117
But how come Fan Zhe Yi is one of the candidates?

456
00:24:04,487 --> 00:24:07,027
Gosh, his ranking dropped a lot.

457
00:24:08,227 --> 00:24:10,527
I just didn't want to go home like this.

458
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:12,467
That's all I could think about.

459
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:15,047
My gosh. This one is going to be so tough.

460
00:24:15,837 --> 00:24:17,736
After the First Survivor Announcement,

461
00:24:17,737 --> 00:24:18,937
the vote count had been reset.

462
00:24:19,137 --> 00:24:21,266
There had been significant changes across the entire ranking...

463
00:24:21,267 --> 00:24:23,037
including the Top Eight.

464
00:24:25,607 --> 00:24:29,347
A certain participant's ranking jumped up by over 20 places.

465
00:24:30,217 --> 00:24:31,347
Gosh, 20 places?

466
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:33,367
His ranking rose up by over 20 places.

467
00:24:35,587 --> 00:24:37,556
Who will be...

468
00:24:37,557 --> 00:24:40,357
the surviving 24 participants in this dramatic ranking shift?

469
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,927
The Second Survivor Announcement of BOYS II PLANET...

470
00:24:45,867 --> 00:24:46,867
will start...

471
00:24:49,997 --> 00:24:51,137
Actually, before that,

472
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:54,406
we're going to take a look...

473
00:24:54,407 --> 00:24:56,276
at the process of the third mission the participants...

474
00:24:56,277 --> 00:24:57,637
have been preparing for.

475
00:24:58,547 --> 00:25:01,107
It's been a challenging process. It's been so tough.

476
00:25:04,577 --> 00:25:07,317
(Several days ago)

477
00:25:07,447 --> 00:25:08,586
(Sighing)

478
00:25:08,587 --> 00:25:09,687
What's going on?

479
00:25:10,487 --> 00:25:12,187
What could this be now?

480
00:25:12,657 --> 00:25:14,127
There's a big screen here today.

481
00:25:14,957 --> 00:25:16,237
Are we going to watch something?

482
00:25:16,457 --> 00:25:17,797
I hope it's something fun.

483
00:25:18,367 --> 00:25:19,627
I wonder what we'll do today.

484
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:20,997
Let's see.

485
00:25:23,797 --> 00:25:27,967
(At that moment, someone is approaching the participants.)

486
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,847
(Who is this man?)

487
00:25:39,717 --> 00:25:42,417
(This is unbelievable!)

488
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,587
(Cheering)

489
00:25:43,687 --> 00:25:46,057
This can't be real. Hold on. This is...

490
00:25:46,687 --> 00:25:47,927
I never imagined...

491
00:25:48,927 --> 00:25:49,927
It's THE 8.

492
00:25:51,227 --> 00:25:55,567
(SEVENTEEN, the top K-pop boy group)

493
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:58,737
(Planet Master THE 8, the member of a performance-forward unit)

494
00:25:58,867 --> 00:26:02,207
Hello, participants of BOYS II PLANET.

495
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:04,846
I'm Planet Master THE 8 of SEVENTEEN.

496
00:26:04,847 --> 00:26:05,877
(Planet Master THE 8)

497
00:26:07,747 --> 00:26:08,777
This is awesome.

498
00:26:09,077 --> 00:26:10,347
I was so excited.

499
00:26:10,747 --> 00:26:13,586
I didn't know a member of SEVENTEEN would be here like this.

500
00:26:13,587 --> 00:26:15,317
So I was so surprised.

501
00:26:15,787 --> 00:26:18,326
It's great to meet you in person.

502
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,786
And you guys have excellent energy.

503
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,026
It's an honor.

504
00:26:22,027 --> 00:26:23,027
Gosh, no.

505
00:26:23,597 --> 00:26:25,067
This is incredible. Seriously.

506
00:26:26,097 --> 00:26:27,097
All right.

507
00:26:27,098 --> 00:26:30,737
I should tell you why I've come here today.

508
00:26:32,107 --> 00:26:33,437
I can sort of guess it.

509
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:38,606
I'm here to deliver the news about the mission...

510
00:26:38,607 --> 00:26:40,407
for the Third Class War.

511
00:26:40,607 --> 00:26:42,046
Oh, my gosh!

512
00:26:42,047 --> 00:26:43,517
The Third Class War.

513
00:26:43,817 --> 00:26:45,216
- Come on! - Oh, my gosh.

514
00:26:45,217 --> 00:26:46,217
Let's fight!

515
00:26:46,218 --> 00:26:47,887
It's the start of a new chapter.

516
00:26:48,217 --> 00:26:49,457
Let's do this.

517
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:53,957
The Third Class War of BOYS II PLANET.

518
00:26:54,627 --> 00:26:55,957
What is it?

519
00:26:58,167 --> 00:26:59,727
It's the Debut Concept Battle.

520
00:27:01,937 --> 00:27:03,567
- Debut Concept? - What's this now?

521
00:27:03,737 --> 00:27:04,867
I'm curious.

522
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:07,506
For the Debut Concept Battle,

523
00:27:07,507 --> 00:27:09,376
you will get to picture yourselves making a debut...

524
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:12,647
and execute various concepts with original songs.

525
00:27:13,947 --> 00:27:14,947
Original songs?

526
00:27:14,948 --> 00:27:16,016
As in our own song.

527
00:27:16,017 --> 00:27:17,297
- I'm so excited. - I'm curious.

528
00:27:17,517 --> 00:27:20,047
First of all, I wanted to listen to the song soon.

529
00:27:20,147 --> 00:27:22,956
I get to be the original singer and express it how I want to,

530
00:27:22,957 --> 00:27:26,657
so I thought I could show off my own colors.

531
00:27:27,327 --> 00:27:30,096
Since this mission includes new songs,

532
00:27:30,097 --> 00:27:32,866
you will also be participating in creating the choreography,

533
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:35,027
the movements on stage, and producing the song itself.

534
00:27:36,267 --> 00:27:37,767
Do we have to create something again?

535
00:27:37,967 --> 00:27:40,537
How am I going to come up with the choreography again?

536
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:42,836
(Just a cover dance)

537
00:27:42,837 --> 00:27:46,047
(The last mission was hard as they had to create the choreography.)

538
00:27:46,307 --> 00:27:47,507
My head is going to burst now.

539
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:51,377
So, starting now, the mission songs...

540
00:27:53,587 --> 00:27:54,687
will be revealed.

541
00:27:54,717 --> 00:27:55,987
Oh, my gosh!

542
00:27:56,687 --> 00:27:57,987
What will they be?

543
00:27:58,527 --> 00:27:59,647
I'm looking forward to this.

544
00:27:59,927 --> 00:28:01,057
Gosh, what are they like?

545
00:28:02,557 --> 00:28:03,997
Debut Concept Battle.

546
00:28:04,197 --> 00:28:05,627
This is the first new song.

547
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:08,196
(Semi-finals New Song: "Lucky MACHO")

548
00:28:08,197 --> 00:28:10,067
The new song is called "Lucky MACHO."

549
00:28:10,637 --> 00:28:12,107
So, it's a lucky manly man.

550
00:28:12,337 --> 00:28:13,337
("Lucky MACHO," a song in the hybrid hip-hop genre)

551
00:28:13,338 --> 00:28:15,178
(This new song presents various mood changes.)

552
00:28:15,677 --> 00:28:18,077
Gosh, that's so cool.

553
00:28:18,207 --> 00:28:19,547
The beat is so interesting.

554
00:28:21,277 --> 00:28:22,477
Get up.

555
00:28:25,387 --> 00:28:26,986
It has a fast beat,

556
00:28:26,987 --> 00:28:30,686
so I think it will make people excited as soon as they hear it.

557
00:28:30,687 --> 00:28:32,157
I really wanted to do this song.

558
00:28:32,387 --> 00:28:34,726
- They ripped it up. - That was so good.

559
00:28:34,727 --> 00:28:36,157
The first song is already so good.

560
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,367
But the choreography looks too hard.

561
00:28:38,727 --> 00:28:39,866
(Semi-finals New Song: "Chains")

562
00:28:39,867 --> 00:28:42,567
The second new song is called "Chains."

563
00:28:42,867 --> 00:28:43,867
("Chains," a new song that intertwines the emotions...)

564
00:28:43,868 --> 00:28:46,148
(between two people with a dreamy mood in a delicate way)

565
00:28:47,337 --> 00:28:49,777
- That's so cool! - This song is totally yours!

566
00:28:50,307 --> 00:28:51,677
I have a good feeling about this.

567
00:29:00,587 --> 00:29:01,957
I want to do this song so badly.

568
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:03,416
Gosh, this is it.

569
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:06,227
As I was watching, I thought, "I can't do any other song."

570
00:29:08,227 --> 00:29:09,657
All of the songs are so good.

571
00:29:09,997 --> 00:29:12,227
But we'll have to listen to the next song too.

572
00:29:13,567 --> 00:29:15,697
The third new song is called "Sugar HIGH."

573
00:29:15,997 --> 00:29:17,666
"Sugar HIGH."

574
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:19,113
- A cute one. - This one will be cute.

575
00:29:19,137 --> 00:29:20,266
("Sugar HIGH," a new song in the hybrid pop genre...)

576
00:29:20,267 --> 00:29:21,627
(that features a refreshing sound)

577
00:29:22,907 --> 00:29:25,447
I like this song! It's so nice to listen to.

578
00:29:25,547 --> 00:29:27,407
I want to do this one. It's nice.

579
00:29:27,707 --> 00:29:30,077
This song feels so happy.

580
00:29:30,617 --> 00:29:31,747
I'm happy.

581
00:29:31,947 --> 00:29:33,447
I really like it.

582
00:29:33,717 --> 00:29:35,256
Yun Seo should do "Sugar HIGH."

583
00:29:35,257 --> 00:29:36,657
I really want to do this.

584
00:29:36,757 --> 00:29:38,317
As long as it's not this one, I'm good.

585
00:29:38,487 --> 00:29:40,727
I've done too many songs with a refreshing concept.

586
00:29:40,957 --> 00:29:42,256
I want to do something kind of cool.

587
00:29:42,257 --> 00:29:44,296
- Manly man Na Yun Seo. - That's what I want to do.

588
00:29:44,297 --> 00:29:45,603
(Na Yun Seo, Look he strives for: A cool manly man)

589
00:29:45,627 --> 00:29:47,226
This is the final new song.

590
00:29:47,227 --> 00:29:48,596
So, there are four songs.

591
00:29:48,597 --> 00:29:52,007
The producer of the final new song is rather special.

592
00:29:52,637 --> 00:29:54,107
Is it WOOZI?

593
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,606
Could it be HUI?

594
00:29:55,607 --> 00:29:57,177
Shall we find out right now?

595
00:29:57,237 --> 00:29:58,306
Who is it?

596
00:29:58,307 --> 00:30:00,227
(Who is the producer of the final mission song?)

597
00:30:01,547 --> 00:30:02,617
Oh, what?

598
00:30:04,547 --> 00:30:05,586
Oh, what?

599
00:30:05,587 --> 00:30:07,787
- What? - What is this?

600
00:30:08,317 --> 00:30:09,317
Seriously?

601
00:30:09,587 --> 00:30:11,217
- Is it PLAVE? - PLAVE?

602
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:15,057
Hello, everyone on BOYS II PLANET!

603
00:30:15,327 --> 00:30:16,397
We are PLAVE!

604
00:30:17,157 --> 00:30:18,626
("PLAVE's Own New Song Streamed 11 Million Times Within 24 Hours")

605
00:30:18,627 --> 00:30:20,126
(The rising contenders in the music charts keep setting new records...)

606
00:30:20,127 --> 00:30:21,497
(with every album they release.)

607
00:30:21,697 --> 00:30:23,236
(The top global virtual boy group)

608
00:30:23,237 --> 00:30:24,666
("Sold-out Concerts and Modeling in Commercials,")

609
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:25,936
("Virtual Idols Are All the Rage, Even Without Human Counterparts")

610
00:30:25,937 --> 00:30:27,636
(PLAVE is an idol group that can write lyrics, compose, )

611
00:30:27,637 --> 00:30:29,607
(and produce their own songs.)

612
00:30:29,777 --> 00:30:31,876
We will be gifting you with a new song...

613
00:30:31,877 --> 00:30:33,607
that we've written and composed ourselves.

614
00:30:33,747 --> 00:30:35,647
Hey, I bet this one is going to be great.

615
00:30:36,047 --> 00:30:38,077
Every song they make is a hit.

616
00:30:38,447 --> 00:30:39,987
This is the final new song.

617
00:30:40,617 --> 00:30:41,886
("MAIN DISH," a new song that features an old-school vibe...)

618
00:30:41,887 --> 00:30:43,767
(combined with a rock sound and powerful beats)

619
00:30:46,057 --> 00:30:47,187
It's so passionate.

620
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:49,597
Gosh, they're such good dancers.

621
00:30:50,197 --> 00:30:52,466
Just the fact that this song was made by PLAVE...

622
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:55,266
makes this song that much more attractive.

623
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:57,197
To be honest, I was really drawn to this song.

624
00:30:57,667 --> 00:30:59,766
The songs for this mission are so nice.

625
00:30:59,767 --> 00:31:01,536
I personally like "Lucky MACHO" the most.

626
00:31:01,537 --> 00:31:03,737
But "Chains" does suit me the best.

627
00:31:03,807 --> 00:31:05,506
But "Sugar High" wasn't bad either.

628
00:31:05,507 --> 00:31:06,777
What should I go with?

629
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,416
Since this is a Debut Concept Battle,

630
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:11,153
I thought I should do what I'm good at rather than what I want to do.

631
00:31:11,177 --> 00:31:14,887
So, all four of the new songs have been revealed.

632
00:31:14,987 --> 00:31:16,057
However,

633
00:31:17,817 --> 00:31:21,057
sadly enough, all of the participants here...

634
00:31:21,127 --> 00:31:23,397
will not be able to...

635
00:31:25,297 --> 00:31:26,497
go on stage.

636
00:31:28,227 --> 00:31:29,397
I knew it.

637
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:30,837
This is survival.

638
00:31:31,197 --> 00:31:33,106
Only those who survive in the Second Survivor Announcement...

639
00:31:33,107 --> 00:31:35,006
and get All Star...

640
00:31:35,007 --> 00:31:37,607
will gain the right to perform on stage.

641
00:31:37,837 --> 00:31:40,147
- My gosh! - Gosh, please.

642
00:31:40,177 --> 00:31:42,217
I want to get All Star.

643
00:31:42,517 --> 00:31:45,547
I have to get All Star. Please.

644
00:31:45,847 --> 00:31:48,187
We can do it. We have the benefit.

645
00:31:49,787 --> 00:31:53,587
Since this mission will sort out the All Stars of the All Stars,

646
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:56,757
the benefit will be the highest ever as well.

647
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,197
Here's the most important part.

648
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,166
Benefit.

649
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:03,367
How much will it be?

650
00:32:04,867 --> 00:32:07,537
First, all members of the first place team...

651
00:32:07,637 --> 00:32:09,136
will receive 150,000 points,

652
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:11,506
and among the first place team members,

653
00:32:11,507 --> 00:32:15,247
the member with the highest personal points...

654
00:32:17,717 --> 00:32:20,687
will get an additional 150,000 points.

655
00:32:20,987 --> 00:32:22,687
Oh, that's huge.

656
00:32:22,917 --> 00:32:24,686
Then, you have to be number 1 among the number 1...

657
00:32:24,687 --> 00:32:26,287
in order to get 300,000 points.

658
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:29,356
Also, you will certainly get a chance...

659
00:32:29,357 --> 00:32:32,327
to appear on "M Countdown" with this mission.

660
00:32:32,497 --> 00:32:34,627
He said "certainly." There's more.

661
00:32:34,727 --> 00:32:37,036
Only the first place team will get...

662
00:32:37,037 --> 00:32:38,437
(Only?)

663
00:32:38,537 --> 00:32:40,637
A chance to have a meet-and-greet with their fans.

664
00:32:41,307 --> 00:32:43,176
A meet-and-greet in person, not online?

665
00:32:43,177 --> 00:32:45,137
Only the first place team overall...

666
00:32:45,207 --> 00:32:48,917
(The benefit during the 2nd Class War, an online meet-and-greet)

667
00:32:49,347 --> 00:32:50,446
(This time, they'll get to see their fans in person...)

668
00:32:50,447 --> 00:32:51,553
(with an offline meet-and-greet.)

669
00:32:51,577 --> 00:32:52,646
This time, it's for real.

670
00:32:52,647 --> 00:32:54,417
It's offline, not online.

671
00:32:54,487 --> 00:32:55,817
I really want to do that.

672
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,157
My gosh.

673
00:32:57,257 --> 00:32:58,986
I want to win first place...

674
00:32:58,987 --> 00:33:01,187
and have a meet-and-greet, no matter what.

675
00:33:01,587 --> 00:33:04,597
To win this incredible benefit,

676
00:33:04,727 --> 00:33:07,166
the most important thing would be...

677
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:10,067
about which song you will perform with which team members, right?

678
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:11,667
- Yes, that's important. - Yes.

679
00:33:12,037 --> 00:33:15,007
However, the song and team members...

680
00:33:16,807 --> 00:33:18,677
are not up to you to decide.

681
00:33:18,807 --> 00:33:20,377
- What? - What did he say?

682
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:24,116
For the mission song and team members of the Debut Concept Battle,

683
00:33:24,117 --> 00:33:26,647
the Star Creators have listened to the new songs in advance...

684
00:33:26,717 --> 00:33:28,786
and matched the participants...

685
00:33:28,787 --> 00:33:30,986
who are best suited for the song.

686
00:33:30,987 --> 00:33:31,987
(Your matching is complete.)

687
00:33:31,988 --> 00:33:34,656
- It has already been decided. - For real?

688
00:33:34,657 --> 00:33:35,856
If that's how it was decided,

689
00:33:35,857 --> 00:33:38,497
I'm happy with whatever song the Star Creators chose for me.

690
00:33:38,597 --> 00:33:40,226
(Please, Star Creators...)

691
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:42,666
You must be really curious about which song...

692
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:43,936
you've been matched with, right?

693
00:33:43,937 --> 00:33:45,136
- Yes. - Yes.

694
00:33:45,137 --> 00:33:46,577
That's what I want to know the most.

695
00:33:46,637 --> 00:33:47,967
Hurry up and tell us!

696
00:33:48,207 --> 00:33:51,277
I hope you survive in the Second Survivor Announcement...

697
00:33:51,307 --> 00:33:53,976
and prepare an amazing performance.

698
00:33:53,977 --> 00:33:56,977
This is where I will say goodbye.

699
00:33:57,177 --> 00:33:58,787
- Thank you. - Thank you.

700
00:33:58,817 --> 00:34:00,286
- You can do it! - We can do it!

701
00:34:00,287 --> 00:34:02,057
Bye!

702
00:34:02,117 --> 00:34:04,387
(Debut Concept Battle)

703
00:34:04,617 --> 00:34:06,356
I don't know if I'll get to survive, but...

704
00:34:06,357 --> 00:34:07,856
Whichever song I get...

705
00:34:07,857 --> 00:34:10,217
I think I'll do my best so that I don't have any regrets...

706
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:11,847
throughout the time I spend here.

707
00:34:14,067 --> 00:34:15,237
From now on,

708
00:34:15,737 --> 00:34:19,167
we'll reveal the results of the New Song Matching Vote.

709
00:34:19,967 --> 00:34:21,337
(Being silly with giddiness)

710
00:34:21,467 --> 00:34:23,177
Let's go!

711
00:34:24,407 --> 00:34:26,783
(How the results will be revealed for the New Song Matching)

712
00:34:26,807 --> 00:34:28,407
We have to open the door and go in.

713
00:34:28,577 --> 00:34:30,047
Oh, my gosh!

714
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:31,617
I'm so curious.

715
00:34:31,877 --> 00:34:33,047
"Sun Jia Yang."

716
00:34:33,217 --> 00:34:37,157
(After seeing the new song matching result written on the card)

717
00:34:37,217 --> 00:34:38,757
Where is he going?

718
00:34:39,087 --> 00:34:42,096
(They enter the door to the song they've been matched with...)

719
00:34:42,097 --> 00:34:45,127
(and check their team members.)

720
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:47,897
Okay, then. The first participant.

721
00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:50,137
Who will it be?

722
00:34:50,397 --> 00:34:51,867
No way. It can't be me, right?

723
00:34:52,537 --> 00:34:54,166
Participant Seo Won.

724
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:56,036
Come to the front and check your card.

725
00:34:56,037 --> 00:34:58,306
- Go on. - See you after.

726
00:34:58,307 --> 00:34:59,847
Am I the first?

727
00:35:00,107 --> 00:35:01,377
Let's go, Seo Won!

728
00:35:02,077 --> 00:35:04,437
Am I the first because my name is Seo Won, like number one?

729
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:08,817
I can't believe we're doing this again.

730
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:11,657
Gosh, I'm so curious.

731
00:35:11,857 --> 00:35:13,787
I feel like he's going to go to "Chains."

732
00:35:13,957 --> 00:35:16,297
I bet Seo Won wants to do "Sugar HIGH."

733
00:35:17,497 --> 00:35:20,627
I wanted to do "Sugar HIGH," no matter what.

734
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:23,596
I was sad I didn't get to perform "Say My Name" last season.

735
00:35:23,597 --> 00:35:25,067
I'll get rid of that sadness here.

736
00:35:27,237 --> 00:35:28,306
Gosh, he must be nervous.

737
00:35:28,307 --> 00:35:29,467
(He steps forward nervously.)

738
00:35:30,037 --> 00:35:32,247
(Has he been matched with the song he wanted?)

739
00:35:38,247 --> 00:35:40,686
(Seo Won gets matched with "Sugar HIGH.")

740
00:35:40,687 --> 00:35:42,087
(Bye-bye)

741
00:35:42,187 --> 00:35:43,616
Bye.

742
00:35:43,617 --> 00:35:45,887
We finally get to see Seo Won in a refreshing concept.

743
00:35:46,527 --> 00:35:48,697
That's right. The refreshing concept is for me.

744
00:35:49,757 --> 00:35:52,097
Who else will be the members for "Sugar HIGH?"

745
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:55,267
Next, participant Kim Tae Jo.

746
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:57,097
Participant Yeom Ye Chan.

747
00:35:57,667 --> 00:35:59,537
Is it the Chocos?

748
00:36:00,807 --> 00:36:02,137
(After waiting...)

749
00:36:02,207 --> 00:36:03,207
Boo!

750
00:36:03,837 --> 00:36:04,877
Boo!

751
00:36:06,377 --> 00:36:08,676
Hey, the Chocos are together.

752
00:36:08,677 --> 00:36:09,953
(Kim Tae Jo and Yeom Ye Chan, the Chocos, matched to "MAIN DISH")

753
00:36:09,977 --> 00:36:12,777
- We finally get to work together. - Finally, we get to work together.

754
00:36:13,687 --> 00:36:15,116
Okay, next is participant Yi Chen.

755
00:36:15,117 --> 00:36:16,993
(Next, Yi Chen will go up and check his matching result.)

756
00:36:17,017 --> 00:36:19,657
- Participant Yi Chen. - Will Yi Chen come to "MAIN DISH?"

757
00:36:19,787 --> 00:36:20,827
No way.

758
00:36:20,957 --> 00:36:23,427
Okay.

759
00:36:23,727 --> 00:36:25,996
If he comes to "MAIN DISH," will Ye Chan do a diss rap again?

760
00:36:25,997 --> 00:36:28,797
But he is more suited for "Lucky MACHO."

761
00:36:29,137 --> 00:36:31,367
That style is a bit more...

762
00:36:32,867 --> 00:36:34,666
- I see. - Hey, Chen.

763
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:36,947
(What will be the result of Yi Chen's New Song Matching?)

764
00:36:38,777 --> 00:36:40,207
(Ta-da)

765
00:36:40,777 --> 00:36:42,417
(Yi Chen is matched with "MAIN DISH.")

766
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,517
I felt like I was reliving a trauma.

767
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:47,917
(During the Class Switch Position Battle, )

768
00:36:48,047 --> 00:36:50,133
(Yeom Ye Chan and Yi Chen clearly had different opinions.)

769
00:36:50,157 --> 00:36:52,557
Why are we on the same team again?

770
00:36:53,057 --> 00:36:55,427
Why am I with you again? Okay, Tae Jo.

771
00:36:56,057 --> 00:36:58,397
If something like this happens once more,

772
00:36:58,797 --> 00:37:00,867
I thought I might not be able to do this.

773
00:37:02,337 --> 00:37:04,797
(Next up, it's Li Zi Hao.)

774
00:37:05,237 --> 00:37:07,237
I wanted to do "MAIN DISH" the most.

775
00:37:07,837 --> 00:37:09,077
Is Li Zi Hao getting "Chains?"

776
00:37:09,277 --> 00:37:11,677
I want to see Li Zi Hao perform "Sugar HIGH."

777
00:37:11,707 --> 00:37:13,227
Li Zi Hao does have a refreshing vibe.

778
00:37:13,877 --> 00:37:16,447
(Amid the interest of the other participants, )

779
00:37:16,977 --> 00:37:19,816
(what will Li Zi Hao's New Song Matching result be?)

780
00:37:19,817 --> 00:37:20,887
Li Zi Hao.

781
00:37:22,047 --> 00:37:23,117
Li Zi Hao.

782
00:37:23,357 --> 00:37:24,616
(A performance king with a different walking style)

783
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,757
That's a new style.

784
00:37:25,987 --> 00:37:26,987
Gosh.

785
00:37:27,757 --> 00:37:28,827
Oh, gosh.

786
00:37:29,857 --> 00:37:33,927
(He rolled all the way to his destination.)

787
00:37:37,597 --> 00:37:39,437
What did I tell you?

788
00:37:39,737 --> 00:37:40,737
Hey.

789
00:37:40,738 --> 00:37:43,837
Okay. Li Zi Hao.

790
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:46,177
He is definitely different.

791
00:37:46,647 --> 00:37:47,777
He is definitely different.

792
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:48,916
He will definitely go there.

793
00:37:48,917 --> 00:37:51,446
(A participant with unrivaled charm makes his appearance.)

794
00:37:51,447 --> 00:37:52,787
Zhong Xing, "Chains."

795
00:37:53,217 --> 00:37:55,717
Zhong Xing, do this before you open it.

796
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:57,457
I think he'll get "Chains."

797
00:37:57,657 --> 00:37:59,927
If it's Zhong Xing...

798
00:38:00,657 --> 00:38:02,357
(Everyone, be quiet.)

799
00:38:02,997 --> 00:38:05,927
The style I want the most...

800
00:38:06,227 --> 00:38:07,297
is sexy.

801
00:38:07,427 --> 00:38:08,596
So I think...

802
00:38:08,597 --> 00:38:11,167
I thought, "I will probably go to 'Chains'" after I heard it.

803
00:38:11,997 --> 00:38:13,366
(He Zhong Xing's vote, "Chains")

804
00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:15,127
(Are you ready to watch men, Star Creators?)

805
00:38:16,637 --> 00:38:17,677
It's different.

806
00:38:17,807 --> 00:38:19,606
So, if I go to "Chains" then,

807
00:38:19,607 --> 00:38:22,617
I thought I should show my style properly.

808
00:38:24,977 --> 00:38:26,016
Who is it?

809
00:38:26,017 --> 00:38:27,516
(Just then, the door for "MAIN DISH" opens.)

810
00:38:27,517 --> 00:38:28,587
Oh, my gosh.

811
00:38:29,117 --> 00:38:30,286
(Breaking everyone's expectations)

812
00:38:30,287 --> 00:38:32,047
(He Zhong Xing is matched with "MAIN DISH.")

813
00:38:32,387 --> 00:38:34,327
(Everyone's making a fuss.)

814
00:38:35,427 --> 00:38:37,596
Oh, no.

815
00:38:37,597 --> 00:38:38,756
(Li Zi Hao is terribly shocked.)

816
00:38:38,757 --> 00:38:39,767
Oh, no.

817
00:38:41,367 --> 00:38:43,196
- What? - Zhong Xing.

818
00:38:43,197 --> 00:38:44,936
I don't know.

819
00:38:44,937 --> 00:38:47,017
- You're not in "Chains?" - I can't believe I'm not.

820
00:38:48,037 --> 00:38:49,837
(He Zhong Xing checked the matching result.)

821
00:38:53,107 --> 00:38:55,977
Honestly, I didn't understand back then.

822
00:38:56,477 --> 00:38:58,547
(He Zhong Xing, "MAIN DISH")

823
00:38:59,487 --> 00:39:03,057
I don't think I'm really suitable for this song.

824
00:39:04,917 --> 00:39:07,587
I was just so confident about going to "Chains."

825
00:39:08,057 --> 00:39:09,427
Everyone's a rapper in the team.

826
00:39:10,197 --> 00:39:11,456
How many rappers do we have here?

827
00:39:11,457 --> 00:39:13,026
Why? Seriously.

828
00:39:13,027 --> 00:39:14,743
("MAIN DISH" has five rapper participants gathered.)

829
00:39:14,767 --> 00:39:16,597
(With the screams heard beyond the door...)

830
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:20,407
(the entire studio turned upside-down.)

831
00:39:21,307 --> 00:39:24,977
(There is one person who cannot laugh in midst of all this.)

832
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,546
Lee Jeong, let's go.

833
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:28,007
Lee Jeong, let's go to "MAIN DISH."

834
00:39:28,647 --> 00:39:31,246
- Your "MAIN DISH" is over there. - No, never.

835
00:39:31,247 --> 00:39:32,387
I'm going to starve.

836
00:39:33,547 --> 00:39:36,917
In the last mission, I had a difficult time.

837
00:39:37,457 --> 00:39:38,516
(1-on-1 Class Battle Rehearsal)

838
00:39:38,517 --> 00:39:40,157
(Yi Chen left in the middle of practice.)

839
00:39:40,327 --> 00:39:41,356
(Class Switch Position Battle)

840
00:39:41,357 --> 00:39:43,273
(Thanks to He Zhong Xing discussing about dropping out, )

841
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,527
(his past days were forever painful.)

842
00:39:45,827 --> 00:39:48,267
I hope the Star Creators would...

843
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:52,467
send me to "Chains."

844
00:39:52,937 --> 00:39:54,257
- Jun Lee Jeong. - Jun Lee Jeong.

845
00:39:54,307 --> 00:39:58,606
(His peers are wishing that Jun Lee Jeong won't starve.)

846
00:39:58,607 --> 00:40:01,176
- "MAIN DISH." - "MAIN DISH."

847
00:40:01,177 --> 00:40:02,977
(Why are you doing this to me?)

848
00:40:03,247 --> 00:40:04,517
I cheer for Lee Jeong.

849
00:40:05,047 --> 00:40:07,416
Please let me do "Chains," this once.

850
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:08,447
Please.

851
00:40:12,457 --> 00:40:15,897
(What is the result of Jun Lee Jeong's New Song matching?)

852
00:40:16,327 --> 00:40:17,457
Wait. He likes it.

853
00:40:17,827 --> 00:40:18,926
Just go straight to it.

854
00:40:18,927 --> 00:40:20,066
(Jun Lee Jeong is moving right away.)

855
00:40:20,067 --> 00:40:21,997
- He's going. - Really?

856
00:40:22,967 --> 00:40:24,037
Let's go.

857
00:40:24,497 --> 00:40:27,137
(Jun Lee Jeong is matched with "Chains.")

858
00:40:30,577 --> 00:40:32,137
Finally, he gets to do what he wants.

859
00:40:32,977 --> 00:40:33,977
(Gosh)

860
00:40:33,978 --> 00:40:35,446
(Jun Lee Jeong is matched as the first member for "Chains.")

861
00:40:35,447 --> 00:40:36,577
Gosh. I can't...

862
00:40:37,077 --> 00:40:38,447
I'm so happy.

863
00:40:40,517 --> 00:40:41,517
Gosh.

864
00:40:43,187 --> 00:40:44,887
I think Lee Jeong would tear up.

865
00:40:45,687 --> 00:40:47,357
I can't go to "Sugar HIGH." Please.

866
00:40:48,287 --> 00:40:49,927
(When the mission songs were revealed...)

867
00:40:52,227 --> 00:40:53,466
Anything but this is fine.

868
00:40:53,467 --> 00:40:54,803
(Na Yun Seo was reluctant about "Sugar HIGH.")

869
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,567
I've done refreshing style too much.

870
00:40:58,267 --> 00:40:59,436
Yun Seo, let's go.

871
00:40:59,437 --> 00:41:01,537
I want to do something cool.

872
00:41:02,237 --> 00:41:03,277
Please!

873
00:41:08,447 --> 00:41:10,617
(We support refreshing Na Yun Seo, from Star Creators)

874
00:41:11,277 --> 00:41:12,846
(Na Yun Seo is matched with "Sugar HIGH.")

875
00:41:12,847 --> 00:41:14,447
- Yun Seo. - Yun Seo.

876
00:41:15,387 --> 00:41:16,456
(Grunting)

877
00:41:16,457 --> 00:41:17,487
Seriously.

878
00:41:18,817 --> 00:41:20,357
Seriously.

879
00:41:20,527 --> 00:41:22,087
Why do I get a refreshing style, again?

880
00:41:23,197 --> 00:41:26,066
Since it's a refreshing style, I don't want it to be cute...

881
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:29,137
but I want to do a more mature refreshing style.

882
00:41:30,897 --> 00:41:32,607
Sun Jia Yang.

883
00:41:32,807 --> 00:41:34,436
Tatsuki, come here.

884
00:41:34,437 --> 00:41:35,506
(Tatsuki, Hsu Ching Yu, )

885
00:41:35,507 --> 00:41:36,977
It's Hsu Ching Yu.

886
00:41:37,837 --> 00:41:40,407
(and Masato are all matched with "Sugar HIGH.")

887
00:41:40,947 --> 00:41:42,746
The looks here are overpowering.

888
00:41:42,747 --> 00:41:44,546
- Yes, this is the visual team. - It's the visual team.

889
00:41:44,547 --> 00:41:46,186
("Sugar HIGH" has seven visual members.)

890
00:41:46,187 --> 00:41:48,047
All the cute guys went there.

891
00:41:48,147 --> 00:41:49,357
They are cute.

892
00:41:49,957 --> 00:41:50,957
(Following is the order of matching New Songs for Arctic.)

893
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:51,986
- I don't know. - Arctic.

894
00:41:51,987 --> 00:41:52,987
- Arctic. - Arctic.

895
00:41:52,988 --> 00:41:54,703
Just looking at Arctic, he's going to "Sugar HIGH."

896
00:41:54,727 --> 00:41:56,397
- Arctic. - Arctic.

897
00:41:56,627 --> 00:41:58,587
Don't you think Arctic will come to "Sugar HIGH?"

898
00:41:58,897 --> 00:42:01,327
(Arctic's cute image fits right into "Sugar HIGH.")

899
00:42:01,467 --> 00:42:02,766
Isn't Arctic going to "Sugar HIGH?"

900
00:42:02,767 --> 00:42:04,937
(Is the result for Arctic's matching, "Sugar HIGH?")

901
00:42:08,037 --> 00:42:09,107
- Gosh. - Arctic.

902
00:42:10,137 --> 00:42:13,277
(Arctic is matched with "Lucky MACHO.")

903
00:42:13,647 --> 00:42:15,446
Yes. We have one good dancer.

904
00:42:15,447 --> 00:42:16,477
We do.

905
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:18,117
We need a good dancer.

906
00:42:18,717 --> 00:42:20,287
We needed a good dancer.

907
00:42:20,587 --> 00:42:21,916
(Starting with Kim Jae Hyun's recruitment of skilled people...)

908
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:22,917
It looks fun.

909
00:42:23,887 --> 00:42:25,216
(Yumeki is matched with "Lucky MACHO.")

910
00:42:25,217 --> 00:42:26,387
Yumeki.

911
00:42:28,157 --> 00:42:29,397
- Yumeki. - Yumeki.

912
00:42:30,057 --> 00:42:33,126
(Xue Su Ren is matched with "Lucky MACHO.")

913
00:42:33,127 --> 00:42:35,897
(Han Harry June is matched with "Lucky MACHO.")

914
00:42:36,467 --> 00:42:37,566
Gosh, what a relief.

915
00:42:37,567 --> 00:42:39,106
(Kim Jun Min is also matched with "Lucky MACHO.")

916
00:42:39,107 --> 00:42:40,166
Jun Min.

917
00:42:40,167 --> 00:42:42,127
(Kim Jun Min is also matched with "Lucky MACHO.")

918
00:42:42,407 --> 00:42:44,707
They have strong dancers over there.

919
00:42:44,877 --> 00:42:46,076
- Yes. - Jun Mln.

920
00:42:46,077 --> 00:42:47,976
(Many dance position participants have gathered in "Lucky MACHO.")

921
00:42:47,977 --> 00:42:49,577
Let's go, Jun Min.

922
00:42:49,717 --> 00:42:50,777
Wait.

923
00:42:51,217 --> 00:42:52,717
Our team members are strong dancers.

924
00:42:53,087 --> 00:42:54,116
I'm in trouble.

925
00:42:54,117 --> 00:42:55,477
(I didn't want it to this extent.)

926
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:57,387
All the dance teachers went there.

927
00:42:57,587 --> 00:42:59,867
It's going to be hard to survive with dancing over there.

928
00:43:01,227 --> 00:43:02,697
Wait a second.

929
00:43:03,697 --> 00:43:05,357
I still...

930
00:43:05,557 --> 00:43:07,827
was attracted to "Lucky MACHO."

931
00:43:09,737 --> 00:43:12,066
I think he'll get "Chains." Dong Gyu will get "Chains."

932
00:43:12,067 --> 00:43:13,167
- No. - Dong Gyu.

933
00:43:13,737 --> 00:43:14,837
Oh, my gosh.

934
00:43:19,007 --> 00:43:20,107
Who is it?

935
00:43:22,207 --> 00:43:23,246
Really, you...

936
00:43:23,247 --> 00:43:26,447
(Park Dong Gyu is matched with "Lucky MACHO.")

937
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:29,787
Why don't you think about being apart from me?

938
00:43:31,117 --> 00:43:32,686
I'm never separated from him.

939
00:43:32,687 --> 00:43:34,586
(Kim Jun Min and Park Dong Gyu are in the same team again.)

940
00:43:34,587 --> 00:43:36,057
Jun Min...

941
00:43:36,297 --> 00:43:39,127
Mission's a mission,

942
00:43:39,497 --> 00:43:43,197
but from being a roommate until now, we were together so far.

943
00:43:44,337 --> 00:43:47,466
I felt like I couldn't break my connection...

944
00:43:47,467 --> 00:43:50,307
with Jun Min, no matter how hard I tried.

945
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:56,977
(With He Xin Long's joining, )

946
00:43:57,177 --> 00:43:58,277
This is going to be fun.

947
00:43:59,017 --> 00:44:00,017
It's going to be fun.

948
00:44:01,787 --> 00:44:03,217
"Lucky MACHO" is full.

949
00:44:04,257 --> 00:44:05,417
I can't go to "Lucky MACHO."

950
00:44:05,657 --> 00:44:06,887
I wanted to do "Lucky MACHO."

951
00:44:07,657 --> 00:44:09,327
How many went to "MAIN DISH?"

952
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,057
There are 9 spots left for "Chains." There are 9 left.

953
00:44:12,497 --> 00:44:14,017
"Sugar HIGH" also has many spots left.

954
00:44:14,567 --> 00:44:17,327
I'd feel anxious if there were fewer and fewer places I wanted to go.

955
00:44:18,267 --> 00:44:19,807
Gosh. Why is this so nerve-racking?

956
00:44:20,837 --> 00:44:22,317
Do you want "Chains," no matter what?

957
00:44:22,607 --> 00:44:24,367
I think I'll be depressed if I go elsewhere.

958
00:44:25,007 --> 00:44:28,347
I think I could do a good job if I go to "Chains."

959
00:44:30,377 --> 00:44:32,076
- Let's go. - Yes.

960
00:44:32,077 --> 00:44:35,117
(Lee Sang Won is matched with "Chains.")

961
00:44:35,687 --> 00:44:36,986
- It's done. - It's done.

962
00:44:36,987 --> 00:44:38,056
It's done.

963
00:44:38,057 --> 00:44:39,803
(Lee Sang Won succeeded in matching with "Chains.")

964
00:44:39,827 --> 00:44:40,857
This team is strong.

965
00:44:41,127 --> 00:44:43,956
(And there are people suffering here.)

966
00:44:43,957 --> 00:44:45,127
I seriously want... Please.

967
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:47,767
I wanted to do "Chains."

968
00:44:48,427 --> 00:44:52,367
It was a song that I would want to take over the killing part.

969
00:44:53,007 --> 00:44:55,543
- I think you'll go to "Sugar HIGH." - I think I'll go to "Sugar HIGH."

970
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,436
Kang Min, welcome to "Sugar HIGH."

971
00:44:57,437 --> 00:44:58,706
(The participants are expecting the matching with "Sugar HIGH...")

972
00:44:58,707 --> 00:45:00,107
(for Yoo Kang Min and Chuei Li Yu.)

973
00:45:00,147 --> 00:45:01,447
Honestly,

974
00:45:01,547 --> 00:45:04,917
I think people will think that I'm far from sexy.

975
00:45:05,477 --> 00:45:07,416
I was a bit nervous since I thought...

976
00:45:07,417 --> 00:45:09,317
I won't be able to join the song I wanted.

977
00:45:10,387 --> 00:45:13,187
(What are the results for the two who want "Chains?")

978
00:45:16,827 --> 00:45:18,197
- Gosh. - Isn't this right?

979
00:45:18,497 --> 00:45:19,827
Come on.

980
00:45:20,897 --> 00:45:21,927
- Yes. - Yes.

981
00:45:22,937 --> 00:45:23,937
(Sudden Stop)

982
00:45:24,067 --> 00:45:25,267
Isn't this the place?

983
00:45:25,637 --> 00:45:26,637
- What is it? - Yes.

984
00:45:26,638 --> 00:45:28,358
(Chuei Li Yu is matched with "Sugar HIGH.")

985
00:45:28,707 --> 00:45:31,407
(Goodbye, "Chains.")

986
00:45:31,907 --> 00:45:34,477
(Yoo Kang Min is done checking.)

987
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,876
Really?

988
00:45:35,877 --> 00:45:38,047
(He moved straight toward the door.)

989
00:45:38,377 --> 00:45:40,717
(What is the matching result?)

990
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,287
He's coming.

991
00:45:43,357 --> 00:45:44,386
He's coming.

992
00:45:44,387 --> 00:45:46,157
(Yoo Kang Min is matched with "Chains.")

993
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:49,796
(Team members in "Chains" are cheering.)

994
00:45:49,797 --> 00:45:50,997
Let's go, friend.

995
00:45:51,197 --> 00:45:52,827
Let's get tied up together.

996
00:45:54,197 --> 00:45:56,143
This is my first time teaming up with Yoo Kang Min.

997
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:57,297
It's done.

998
00:45:57,467 --> 00:45:59,167
It's done. There's no need to cry.

999
00:45:59,567 --> 00:46:00,707
He came.

1000
00:46:01,167 --> 00:46:03,176
- What is this? - Why are you all in "Chains?"

1001
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,307
Are they the Avengers again?

1002
00:46:04,877 --> 00:46:08,206
The members in "Chains" are high-rankers,

1003
00:46:08,207 --> 00:46:09,546
and their skills are great.

1004
00:46:09,547 --> 00:46:11,827
(Team "Chains" is formed with high-ranking participants.)

1005
00:46:11,877 --> 00:46:13,717
We became "Whiplash" number two.

1006
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,487
- Lee Leo, come here. - Come here, Lee Leo.

1007
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:23,157
- Leo must be nervous now. - He must be.

1008
00:46:23,657 --> 00:46:25,257
Lee Leo, come here.

1009
00:46:26,167 --> 00:46:27,196
Lee Leo, come here.

1010
00:46:27,197 --> 00:46:28,226
(Lee Leo is checking the matching result.)

1011
00:46:28,227 --> 00:46:29,227
Please.

1012
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:32,397
(Kim In Hu is waiting for his turn.)

1013
00:46:32,667 --> 00:46:33,807
He should try. Let's try.

1014
00:46:34,467 --> 00:46:35,867
- We only need to survive. - But...

1015
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:37,836
(One spot left in "Chains," and "Lucky MACHO" is closed.)

1016
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:39,376
(One spot left in "MAIN DISH,")

1017
00:46:39,377 --> 00:46:40,847
("Sugar HIGH" is closed.)

1018
00:46:41,977 --> 00:46:43,017
Leo.

1019
00:46:44,977 --> 00:46:46,847
- What is it? - Why?

1020
00:46:48,017 --> 00:46:49,247
Where do you want to go to?

1021
00:46:49,617 --> 00:46:50,657
I...

1022
00:46:51,057 --> 00:46:53,887
I think "MAIN DISH" was in the latter part.

1023
00:46:54,287 --> 00:46:57,827
I was slightly struck by "Chains."

1024
00:46:58,257 --> 00:46:59,297
Let's go.

1025
00:46:59,897 --> 00:47:00,966
Where are you going to?

1026
00:47:00,967 --> 00:47:02,247
(The person that wants "Chains")

1027
00:47:02,597 --> 00:47:03,636
(What is the result?)

1028
00:47:03,637 --> 00:47:04,637
Where are you going?

1029
00:47:05,997 --> 00:47:08,907
(Bye, In Hu.)

1030
00:47:12,477 --> 00:47:13,877
(Screaming)

1031
00:47:16,317 --> 00:47:17,317
(Screaming)

1032
00:47:18,547 --> 00:47:20,786
(No. Don't go, In Hu.)

1033
00:47:20,787 --> 00:47:22,046
(Wait for a while.)

1034
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,287
Gosh!

1035
00:47:24,017 --> 00:47:26,257
(Dumbfounded)

1036
00:47:27,057 --> 00:47:29,657
What's wrong? Why are you being like that?

1037
00:47:29,757 --> 00:47:31,427
Is someone getting beaten?

1038
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:34,597
- Will Leo get "MAIN DISH?" - Right.

1039
00:47:35,067 --> 00:47:36,897
What's going on?

1040
00:47:38,737 --> 00:47:41,507
(What will be the result of these two participants?)

1041
00:47:41,707 --> 00:47:43,107
Let's make it fun.

1042
00:47:47,507 --> 00:47:50,517
(Kim In Hu and Lee Leo come out from different doors.)

1043
00:47:51,177 --> 00:47:52,246
In Hu!

1044
00:47:52,247 --> 00:47:53,847
(Kim In Hu gets matched to "MAIN DISH.")

1045
00:47:54,187 --> 00:47:55,417
Welcome.

1046
00:47:55,917 --> 00:47:58,257
- Nice, In Hu! - We meet again.

1047
00:47:59,587 --> 00:48:01,527
(Sighing)

1048
00:48:01,987 --> 00:48:04,597
What's up, Leo?

1049
00:48:04,827 --> 00:48:06,626
- Nice! - Come to "Chains."

1050
00:48:06,627 --> 00:48:08,426
What's up, Leo? Come to "Chains."

1051
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,307
There are so many members from Team "Whiplash."

1052
00:48:10,967 --> 00:48:11,967
There are five?

1053
00:48:12,067 --> 00:48:13,936
- This is "Whiplash" Version Two. - These five.

1054
00:48:13,937 --> 00:48:16,307
(There are 5 people in "Chains" from "Whiplash" Team 1.)

(The New Song Matching ends.)

1072
00:48:39,227 --> 00:48:40,667
They're here.

1073
00:48:44,367 --> 00:48:46,236
(The new uniforms are here for the Debut Concept Battle.)

1074
00:48:46,237 --> 00:48:47,237
Let's go.

1075
00:48:47,607 --> 00:48:49,907
Here are your new uniforms.

1076
00:48:51,007 --> 00:48:52,977
(This is so exciting.)

1077
00:48:53,677 --> 00:48:56,037
The participants in the Top Eight, please raise your hands.

1078
00:48:56,647 --> 00:48:58,446
The participants in the Top Eight, please raise your hands.

1079
00:48:58,447 --> 00:49:01,387
(The Top 8 participants raise their hands from here and there.)

1080
00:49:02,017 --> 00:49:07,187
The special item for the Top Eight will be revealed.

1081
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,087
- Item! - Item?

1082
00:49:09,527 --> 00:49:11,857
(What is the special item for the Top 8?)

1083
00:49:14,227 --> 00:49:17,036
(The participants go wild.)

1084
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:19,277
This is it. This is why you want to be in the Top Eight.

1085
00:49:20,337 --> 00:49:21,507
It looks nice.

1086
00:49:23,537 --> 00:49:24,737
I want that.

1087
00:49:25,637 --> 00:49:26,777
It looks nice.

1088
00:49:27,107 --> 00:49:28,447
It looks stylish.

1089
00:49:29,377 --> 00:49:30,517
This is hip-hop.

1090
00:49:32,117 --> 00:49:34,617
I think it's shining because of the light.

1091
00:49:35,687 --> 00:49:37,687
Let me feel the material.

1092
00:49:37,887 --> 00:49:38,917
How's the material?

1093
00:49:42,327 --> 00:49:44,097
I've never worn anything like this.

1094
00:49:44,997 --> 00:49:46,727
(It even smells good.)

1095
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,927
This is two-way.

1096
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:51,596
- You can make it fit nicely. - It's worn like that these days.

1097
00:49:51,597 --> 00:49:53,967
- Right. Like this. - Gosh.

1098
00:49:54,537 --> 00:49:55,767
It looks really nice.

1099
00:49:56,337 --> 00:49:57,536
Do your best!

1100
00:49:57,537 --> 00:50:00,106
(The Top 8's celebratory performance for "HOLA SOLAR")

1101
00:50:00,107 --> 00:50:02,146
Hey!

1102
00:50:02,147 --> 00:50:03,617
Hey!

1103
00:50:14,127 --> 00:50:15,157
Hip-hop, man!

1104
00:50:24,697 --> 00:50:27,067
(Team "Lucky MACHO" practice room)

1105
00:50:27,437 --> 00:50:30,407
Harry June has become our leader.

1106
00:50:33,547 --> 00:50:34,677
Please lead us well.

1107
00:50:35,577 --> 00:50:39,317
(They check the choreography first before the part distribution.)

1108
00:50:39,447 --> 00:50:41,517
It was really impactful.

1109
00:50:41,617 --> 00:50:44,956
It was a strong hip-hop rhythm...

1110
00:50:44,957 --> 00:50:46,357
and that was what I loved about it.

1111
00:50:46,727 --> 00:50:50,726
It had a lot of moves that I used regularly.

1112
00:50:50,727 --> 00:50:52,527
I honestly think this song suits me the best.

1113
00:50:52,627 --> 00:50:54,827
(Awkward macho?)

1114
00:50:55,067 --> 00:50:56,467
We have to split the teams now.

1115
00:50:56,867 --> 00:51:00,067
(There are 6 spots for "Lucky MACHO.")

1116
00:51:00,367 --> 00:51:02,037
There must be 2 teams of 6.

1117
00:51:02,407 --> 00:51:03,606
- Right. - Right.

1118
00:51:03,607 --> 00:51:06,077
I've come up with 2 teams of 6.

1119
00:51:06,477 --> 00:51:09,817
(While the team members were listening to the song...)

1120
00:51:11,177 --> 00:51:13,416
Xin Long. Were you a rapper?

1121
00:51:13,417 --> 00:51:14,417
(Nodding)

1122
00:51:14,418 --> 00:51:16,986
You two are vocalists. You're in between.

1123
00:51:16,987 --> 00:51:18,416
(Leader Han Harry June came up with teams...)

1124
00:51:18,417 --> 00:51:19,963
(after finding out the positions of all 12 members.)

1125
00:51:19,987 --> 00:51:22,586
Me, Dong Gyu, He Xin Long, Chen Bo Wen,

1126
00:51:22,587 --> 00:51:24,387
Hu Han Won, and Arctic will be a team of six.

1127
00:51:24,627 --> 00:51:26,256
Yumeki, Jun Min, Dang Hong Hai, Nian Bo Heng,

1128
00:51:26,257 --> 00:51:27,943
Xue Su Ren, and Jae Hyun will be the other six.

1129
00:51:27,967 --> 00:51:30,496
If Jun Min and I end up in the same team again,

1130
00:51:30,497 --> 00:51:32,197
I thought it would feel too similar.

1131
00:51:32,467 --> 00:51:34,866
(Han Harry June and Kim Jun Min performed "like JENNIE" together...)

1132
00:51:34,867 --> 00:51:37,307
(during the Class Switch Position Battle.)

1133
00:51:37,537 --> 00:51:39,877
I separated myself from Jun Min on purpose.

1134
00:51:39,977 --> 00:51:42,347
I separated Dong Gyu and Yumeki.

1135
00:51:42,447 --> 00:51:44,846
I assigned the rappers.

1136
00:51:44,847 --> 00:51:46,486
I assigned the vocalists.

1137
00:51:46,487 --> 00:51:49,117
That was how I came up with the teams.

1138
00:51:49,817 --> 00:51:50,856
Killing part.

1139
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:51,886
(Team 1 starts with the part distribution right away.)

1140
00:51:51,887 --> 00:51:54,186
Can I see a show of hands for the killing part?

1141
00:51:54,187 --> 00:51:55,226
(Team 1 killing part volunteers, Arctic, He Xin Long, Han Harry June)

1142
00:51:55,227 --> 00:51:56,896
- I will volunteer too. - Okay.

1143
00:51:56,897 --> 00:51:58,856
Let's check out the vibes first.

1144
00:51:58,857 --> 00:52:00,767
Let's see who suits the song the most.

1145
00:52:01,197 --> 00:52:05,337
(Team 1 decides to check out the vibes for the killing part.)

1146
00:52:05,697 --> 00:52:07,377
(Candidate 1 for the killing part, Arctic)

1147
00:52:11,607 --> 00:52:12,737
- Okay. - Okay.

1148
00:52:13,247 --> 00:52:15,127
(Candidate 2 for the killing part, He Xin Long)

1149
00:52:19,017 --> 00:52:20,017
- Okay. - Okay.

1150
00:52:20,647 --> 00:52:22,647
(Candidate 3 for the killing part, Han Harry June)

1151
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,426
Here we go.

1152
00:52:29,427 --> 00:52:32,057
(Who will take the killing part in Team 1?)

1153
00:52:33,597 --> 00:52:35,926
It's you!

1154
00:52:35,927 --> 00:52:37,966
("Lucky MACHO" Team 1's killing part, Han Harry June)

1155
00:52:37,967 --> 00:52:39,297
I will do my best.

1156
00:52:40,507 --> 00:52:42,366
- Yes! - Killing part.

1157
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,006
(Han Harry June becomes the leader and also takes the killing part.)

1158
00:52:44,007 --> 00:52:46,377
Gosh! Thank you.

1159
00:52:46,777 --> 00:52:50,076
I have a mindset of wanting to do everything before I die.

1160
00:52:50,077 --> 00:52:51,597
To be honest, it will be tough for me.

1161
00:52:51,747 --> 00:52:54,647
I survived as the one in 47th place.

1162
00:52:55,687 --> 00:53:01,027
(He barely survived in 47th place in the 1st Survivor Announcement.)

1163
00:53:01,127 --> 00:53:06,527
(Han Harry June had to say goodbye to his teammate, Yang Heui Chan.)

1164
00:53:06,797 --> 00:53:09,027
I had to go up 20 ranks.

1165
00:53:09,667 --> 00:53:11,037
I do feel intimidated,

1166
00:53:11,297 --> 00:53:13,067
but I do not want to give up.

1167
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:17,376
I want to survive and keep my place as a leader...

1168
00:53:17,377 --> 00:53:20,707
along with my killing part. I really do.

1169
00:53:21,707 --> 00:53:24,417
(Team 2 starts deciding on the killing part as well.)

1170
00:53:24,577 --> 00:53:26,257
(Candidate 1 for the killing part, Yumeki)

1171
00:53:26,377 --> 00:53:27,886
(Candidate 2 for the killing part, Xue Su Ren)

1172
00:53:27,887 --> 00:53:29,463
(Candidate 3 for the killing part, Dang Hong Hai)

1173
00:53:29,487 --> 00:53:31,407
(Candidate 4 for the killing part, Nian Bo Heng)

1174
00:53:33,357 --> 00:53:34,857
Okay.

1175
00:53:35,127 --> 00:53:37,007
(Candidate 5 for the killing part, Kim Jun Min)

1176
00:53:39,297 --> 00:53:40,627
Okay.

1177
00:53:41,097 --> 00:53:43,067
One, two, three.

1178
00:53:43,437 --> 00:53:44,796
(Vote result: Kim Jun Min 5 votes, Yumeki 1 vote)

1179
00:53:44,797 --> 00:53:46,807
It's Jun Min.

1180
00:53:47,637 --> 00:53:49,637
The killing part is given to Jun Min.

1181
00:53:50,177 --> 00:53:52,037
(The killing part sticker gets delivered.)

1182
00:53:52,307 --> 00:53:54,207
Yumeki, to be honest...

1183
00:53:55,207 --> 00:53:56,347
- Jun Min. - Yes?

1184
00:53:56,947 --> 00:53:57,947
Well,

1185
00:53:59,747 --> 00:54:04,287
I want to challenge for the killing part again.

1186
00:54:04,387 --> 00:54:08,486
I do know that Jun Min is a better dancer...

1187
00:54:08,487 --> 00:54:09,657
- than I am, - Right.

1188
00:54:09,757 --> 00:54:12,297
But there's another part.

1189
00:54:12,397 --> 00:54:14,096
You want to try the other part as well?

1190
00:54:14,097 --> 00:54:15,997
Yes. I want to challenge him with that part.

1191
00:54:16,637 --> 00:54:18,466
If Jun Min is okay with that...

1192
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:20,566
I'm fine with that. Should we try that part?

1193
00:54:20,567 --> 00:54:23,577
We'll do that if Jun Min is okay with that.

1194
00:54:24,077 --> 00:54:25,606
I was a bit surprised,

1195
00:54:25,607 --> 00:54:27,253
but I understood where he was coming from.

1196
00:54:27,277 --> 00:54:29,277
There were a lot of desperate participants.

1197
00:54:29,477 --> 00:54:32,276
I thought that I could secure my spot...

1198
00:54:32,277 --> 00:54:34,587
after getting acknowledged by my teammates one more time.

1199
00:54:34,987 --> 00:54:36,887
Right. I'll go first.

1200
00:54:38,287 --> 00:54:42,887
(Nian Bo Heng shows his low-tone rap.)

1201
00:54:45,627 --> 00:54:47,126
- He has a really good voice. - Okay.

1202
00:54:47,127 --> 00:54:49,126
- Five, six, seven, eight. - Five, six, seven, eight.

1203
00:54:49,127 --> 00:54:54,666
(Kim Jun Min does the rap part with his unique tone.)

1204
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:56,307
(Impressed)

1205
00:54:57,237 --> 00:54:58,277
Okay.

1206
00:54:58,307 --> 00:55:00,446
The final winner of the killing part.

1207
00:55:00,447 --> 00:55:02,307
(Who will take the killing part in Team 2?)

1208
00:55:02,907 --> 00:55:05,516
It's Jun Min.

1209
00:55:05,517 --> 00:55:07,997
(Kim Jun Min keeps the killing part for "Lucky MACHO" Team 2.)

1210
00:55:08,147 --> 00:55:09,856
One, two, three.

1211
00:55:09,857 --> 00:55:12,856
(The other 4 all chose Kim Jun Min.)

1212
00:55:12,857 --> 00:55:13,887
Thank you.

1213
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,787
Congratulations.

1214
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,967
I got the killing part.

1215
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:23,497
I still feel anxious, though.

1216
00:55:24,537 --> 00:55:26,466
(Kim Jun Min is in danger of elimination...)

1217
00:55:26,467 --> 00:55:28,627
(after placing 27th in the 1st Survivor Announcement.)

1218
00:55:28,967 --> 00:55:30,107
I feel scared...

1219
00:55:30,437 --> 00:55:31,907
since I can't get eliminated.

1220
00:55:33,177 --> 00:55:35,276
(Dance practice begins under Han Harry June's lead.)

1221
00:55:35,277 --> 00:55:37,817
Forward. These moves are needed.

1222
00:55:38,077 --> 00:55:40,147
(Practicing along with the music)

1223
00:55:41,787 --> 00:55:47,157
(Kim Jae Hyun is struggling with the moves unlike the others.)

1224
00:55:47,527 --> 00:55:50,357
- What's wrong? You can't do it? - It's too fast.

1225
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,057
My head hurt so much.

1226
00:55:52,157 --> 00:55:54,697
The others were so good at dancing.

1227
00:55:54,897 --> 00:55:56,737
I was the only one that couldn't follow along.

1228
00:55:58,067 --> 00:56:00,567
I couldn't possibly do it with the skills that I had,

1229
00:56:01,307 --> 00:56:02,387
no matter how hard I tried.

1230
00:56:03,407 --> 00:56:05,313
There was no one in the team that I was close with too.

1231
00:56:05,337 --> 00:56:08,977
I felt lost as I thought that I had to get adjusted again.

1232
00:56:09,477 --> 00:56:14,317
Jae Hyun seemed to be very timid and shy.

1233
00:56:14,417 --> 00:56:16,657
We gave him a warm welcome.

1234
00:56:17,487 --> 00:56:18,487
(Last night)

1235
00:56:18,488 --> 00:56:20,528
(Kim Jae Hyun moved to the room of the older ones.)

1236
00:56:20,887 --> 00:56:21,927
Hello.

1237
00:56:22,157 --> 00:56:23,186
- Hello. - You're here?

1238
00:56:23,187 --> 00:56:24,326
What's up, man?

1239
00:56:24,327 --> 00:56:28,026
Congratulations!

1240
00:56:28,027 --> 00:56:30,367
Give him a hug, everyone!

1241
00:56:30,697 --> 00:56:34,506
There you go! Jae Hyun is here!

1242
00:56:34,507 --> 00:56:37,007
- The atmosphere is different here. - Right.

1243
00:56:37,107 --> 00:56:38,976
(The welcome ceremony isn't over yet.)

1244
00:56:38,977 --> 00:56:40,007
Take this!

1245
00:56:41,107 --> 00:56:42,647
What is going on?

1246
00:56:43,577 --> 00:56:44,577
Let's sleep.

1247
00:56:45,477 --> 00:56:46,947
This is driving me crazy.

1248
00:56:47,647 --> 00:56:50,357
(The method of the older ones to get close to him)

1249
00:56:50,617 --> 00:56:55,157
(Yun Seo's older members made him go to sleep in a calm manner.)

1250
00:56:55,657 --> 00:56:58,127
(Jae Hyun's older members are quite tough.)

1251
00:56:58,627 --> 00:57:00,227
This place is just crazy.

1252
00:57:01,027 --> 00:57:03,747
(Jae Hyun and the macho brothers got close to each other like that.)

1253
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,877
(Our Jae Hyun is struggling with the choreography?)

1254
00:57:07,067 --> 00:57:08,937
There will be an intense training session.

1255
00:57:09,037 --> 00:57:10,277
It will be quite scary.

1256
00:57:10,577 --> 00:57:14,746
(The training session for the youngest is on.)

1257
00:57:14,747 --> 00:57:16,207
Even harder! Five, six...

1258
00:57:18,147 --> 00:57:19,346
Again.

1259
00:57:19,347 --> 00:57:23,017
(The youngest is getting trained.)

1260
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:25,057
You can do it stronger.

1261
00:57:25,117 --> 00:57:26,863
(When Kim Jae Hyun doesn't put enough energy)

1262
00:57:26,887 --> 00:57:28,726
One and two!

1263
00:57:28,727 --> 00:57:30,596
- One and two! - That's it. Seven, eight.

1264
00:57:30,597 --> 00:57:32,326
One and two! Seven, eight.

1265
00:57:32,327 --> 00:57:33,327
(They repeat until it works.)

1266
00:57:33,328 --> 00:57:34,766
Seven, eight.

1267
00:57:34,767 --> 00:57:36,626
Stronger. Seven, eight.

1268
00:57:36,627 --> 00:57:38,036
You can do it even stronger. Seven, eight.

1269
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:39,897
That's right. That's how you should do it.

1270
00:57:40,737 --> 00:57:42,497
You can do it. There's nothing you can't do.

1271
00:57:42,767 --> 00:57:43,983
- You can do it. - You have to do it.

1272
00:57:44,007 --> 00:57:45,776
- You have to do it anyway. - You have to do it anyway.

1273
00:57:45,777 --> 00:57:47,457
You have to survive. What else can you do?

1274
00:57:49,307 --> 00:57:50,676
If I do it with an easygoing mindset...

1275
00:57:50,677 --> 00:57:52,777
since I'd probably be eliminated,

1276
00:57:52,847 --> 00:57:54,617
that wouldn't be nice.

1277
00:57:55,287 --> 00:57:56,817
I'd look irresponsible.

1278
00:57:57,617 --> 00:57:59,087
Let's not think about anything.

1279
00:57:59,817 --> 00:58:00,887
Let's first practice.

1280
00:58:01,057 --> 00:58:02,387
We never know what will happen.

1281
00:58:03,757 --> 00:58:06,057
I really did my best during practice.

1282
00:58:07,127 --> 00:58:09,427
The only thing I could do to overcome this...

1283
00:58:09,497 --> 00:58:11,937
was to practice.

1284
00:58:12,437 --> 00:58:14,337
I really want to survive.

1285
00:58:14,907 --> 00:58:16,107
I really want to do this.

1286
00:58:16,237 --> 00:58:18,237
"Lucky MACHO." This performance.

1287
00:58:20,647 --> 00:58:23,646
(This team is noisy from the start.)

1288
00:58:23,647 --> 00:58:27,016
We came here and were assigned the song...

1289
00:58:27,017 --> 00:58:29,346
by the Star Creators.

1290
00:58:29,347 --> 00:58:30,556
- Yes. - That's right.

1291
00:58:30,557 --> 00:58:31,587
Right.

1292
00:58:31,757 --> 00:58:33,356
(After Team "Sugar HIGH" was formed)

1293
00:58:33,357 --> 00:58:35,327
Everyone here looks cute.

1294
00:58:35,757 --> 00:58:39,957
You know the cute Tamagotchi characters, right?

1295
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:43,497
There were many Tamagotchi characters there,

1296
00:58:43,537 --> 00:58:46,037
so I thought the song suited the team very well.

1297
00:58:47,937 --> 00:58:51,007
(Team "Sugar HIGH" has members who suit the cute and pure song.)

1298
00:58:51,577 --> 00:58:53,746
Is there...

1299
00:58:53,747 --> 00:58:55,676
Is there anyone who wants to become a leader?

1300
00:58:55,677 --> 00:58:56,677
(It's time to choose the leader again.)

1301
00:58:56,678 --> 00:58:58,116
I have someone I want to recommend.

1302
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:59,176
I also do.

1303
00:58:59,177 --> 00:59:00,187
Me too.

1304
00:59:00,817 --> 00:59:01,817
Who is it?

1305
00:59:02,447 --> 00:59:03,786
Then...

1306
00:59:03,787 --> 00:59:05,147
I think I'm looking at the person.

1307
00:59:05,187 --> 00:59:06,956
Shall we all look at the person?

1308
00:59:06,957 --> 00:59:08,226
Who do you think should be the leader?

1309
00:59:08,227 --> 00:59:09,826
(No way.)

1310
00:59:09,827 --> 00:59:11,297
The person who is trembling.

1311
00:59:11,697 --> 00:59:13,696
- Seo Won. - Congratulations.

1312
00:59:13,697 --> 00:59:16,097
(Seo Won was unanimously chosen as the leader.)

1313
00:59:17,967 --> 00:59:21,167
The members are very young.

1314
00:59:21,907 --> 00:59:22,966
(Age: 18, 16, 16, 16, 15)

1315
00:59:22,967 --> 00:59:24,876
(It's the youngest team with an average age of 18.)

1316
00:59:24,877 --> 00:59:26,136
(Age: 16, 15, 19, 19, 18)

1317
00:59:26,137 --> 00:59:27,523
(It's the youngest team with an average age of 18.)

1318
00:59:27,547 --> 00:59:29,906
- I did expect this. - It was decided.

1319
00:59:29,907 --> 00:59:31,976
(It can't be helped.)

1320
00:59:31,977 --> 00:59:34,016
- It can't be helped. - The situation...

1321
00:59:34,017 --> 00:59:35,346
(Closing his eyes)

1322
00:59:35,347 --> 00:59:36,546
Can we talk comfortably?

1323
00:59:36,547 --> 00:59:38,086
- Sure. - Is that okay?

1324
00:59:38,087 --> 00:59:40,927
- I don't mind. - Really?

1325
00:59:41,157 --> 00:59:42,386
(What?)

1326
00:59:42,387 --> 00:59:43,387
Then...

1327
00:59:43,388 --> 00:59:44,397
(Sugar high)

1328
00:59:44,557 --> 00:59:45,897
(Sugar high)

1329
00:59:46,697 --> 00:59:48,197
Everyone.

1330
00:59:48,997 --> 00:59:50,697
- Hey. - Focus, everyone.

1331
00:59:50,767 --> 00:59:53,507
It just felt like this was a school.

1332
00:59:53,807 --> 00:59:56,366
I'll soothe and coax them with a mother's heart...

1333
00:59:56,367 --> 00:59:59,177
and fulfill the role of a leader well.

1334
01:00:00,447 --> 01:00:02,176
We have to divide...

1335
01:00:02,177 --> 01:00:04,377
- the parts now. - Yes.

1336
01:00:04,977 --> 01:00:06,546
(Currently, Team "Sugar HIGH" has 12 members.)

1337
01:00:06,547 --> 01:00:08,446
(But the number of members who will perform on stage...)

1338
01:00:08,447 --> 01:00:10,256
(is only 6!)

1339
01:00:10,257 --> 01:00:13,727
(So 2 members will take 1 part until the Survivor Announcement.)

1340
01:00:13,887 --> 01:00:16,527
The killing part is the most important part of a song.

1341
01:00:17,557 --> 01:00:22,997
(The killing part of "Sugar HIGH" has a pure and cute choreography.)

1342
01:00:23,737 --> 01:00:28,237
(Who will take the killing part of "Sugar HIGH?")

1343
01:00:28,437 --> 01:00:31,037
Who wants to take the killing part?

1344
01:00:32,007 --> 01:00:33,276
I'll try, at least.

1345
01:00:33,277 --> 01:00:34,376
I'll try.

1346
01:00:34,377 --> 01:00:35,746
I'll just try.

1347
01:00:35,747 --> 01:00:37,053
(Many members volunteered for the killing part.)

1348
01:00:37,077 --> 01:00:39,117
This makes me feel like I should also give it a go.

1349
01:00:40,547 --> 01:00:42,986
I was really shocked...

1350
01:00:42,987 --> 01:00:44,757
when we decided the killing part.

1351
01:00:45,787 --> 01:00:48,687
They were all very passionate, perhaps because they're young.

1352
01:00:50,197 --> 01:00:51,697
Is that the bravery of teenagers?

1353
01:00:55,097 --> 01:00:58,737
I thought this could be the last journey.

1354
01:00:58,967 --> 01:01:00,666
So even if I don't get to stand on stage,

1355
01:01:00,667 --> 01:01:02,637
I wanted to try to sing the killing part.

1356
01:01:02,807 --> 01:01:06,337
I need to focus and do well on this performance.

1357
01:01:06,637 --> 01:01:09,146
I really have to get the killing part.

1358
01:01:09,147 --> 01:01:10,546
(The members of team "Sugar HIGH" do their best...)

1359
01:01:10,547 --> 01:01:11,946
(since this could be their last chance.)

1360
01:01:11,947 --> 01:01:13,447
My voice changed even more.

1361
01:01:13,747 --> 01:01:15,847
- Did your vocal range drop more? - Yes.

1362
01:01:16,317 --> 01:01:18,117
This is the disadvantage of being a teenager.

1363
01:01:18,287 --> 01:01:21,886
Who wants to sing the killing part first?

1364
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:23,257
I'll go first.

1365
01:01:25,497 --> 01:01:29,696
(Candidate 1 for the killing part, Kang Woo Jin)

1366
01:01:29,697 --> 01:01:30,937
(Obsessed with Woo Jin)

1367
01:01:37,107 --> 01:01:39,837
(Candidate 2 for the killing part, Masato)

1368
01:01:46,277 --> 01:01:48,116
- His voice is nice. - He's good.

1369
01:01:48,117 --> 01:01:50,186
I couldn't hit the high notes,

1370
01:01:50,187 --> 01:01:52,187
so I had to change the lines.

1371
01:01:52,657 --> 01:01:55,427
(Candidate 3 for the killing part, Na Yun Seo)

1372
01:01:57,057 --> 01:02:01,367
(I feel like I'm about to black out)

1373
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:04,666
He's good.

1374
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:06,296
(Feeling proud)

1375
01:02:06,297 --> 01:02:07,736
If you sing it like that...

1376
01:02:07,737 --> 01:02:09,206
(Candidate 4 for the killing part, Chuei Li Yu)

1377
01:02:09,207 --> 01:02:10,706
(Candidate 5 for the killing part, Fan Zhe Yi)

1378
01:02:10,707 --> 01:02:12,906
(Candidate 6 for the killing part, Hsu Ching Yu)

1379
01:02:12,907 --> 01:02:15,077
(Candidate 7 for the killing part, Tatsuki)

1380
01:02:15,177 --> 01:02:18,217
(Candidate 8 for the killing part, Jung Hyun Jun)

1381
01:02:21,247 --> 01:02:23,817
(Jung Hyun Jun sang the killing part of "Plot Twist.")

1382
01:02:23,917 --> 01:02:28,887
(Candidate 9 for the killing part, Chung Sang Hyeon)

1383
01:02:29,157 --> 01:02:31,857
(The last candidate for the killing part, Seo Won)

1384
01:02:37,797 --> 01:02:38,967
He's really good.

1385
01:02:39,837 --> 01:02:42,606
- We sorted it out. - Yes.

1386
01:02:42,607 --> 01:02:43,906
The two members who will take the killing part position...

1387
01:02:43,907 --> 01:02:45,253
(Jang Han Eum, the sub-leader, announces the 2 members.)

1388
01:02:45,277 --> 01:02:48,906
(The leader and the sub-leader considered the many candidates.)

1389
01:02:48,907 --> 01:02:51,176
(They decided the members to take the killing part...)

1390
01:02:51,177 --> 01:02:53,417
(after a long discussion.)

1391
01:02:53,547 --> 01:02:55,867
The two members who will take the killing part position...

1392
01:02:56,447 --> 01:02:57,756
(Who will take the killing part in Team "Sugar HIGH?")

1393
01:02:57,757 --> 01:02:59,287
- Hyun Jun? - Hyun Jun.

1394
01:03:00,117 --> 01:03:01,927
- Woo Jin? - Woo Jin?

1395
01:03:02,387 --> 01:03:03,556
Is Seo Won...

1396
01:03:03,557 --> 01:03:05,097
(Killing part 1, Seo Won)

1397
01:03:06,457 --> 01:03:07,596
and Sato.

1398
01:03:07,597 --> 01:03:08,766
(Killing part 2, Masato)

1399
01:03:08,767 --> 01:03:11,697
These two will take the killing part.

1400
01:03:12,367 --> 01:03:13,436
Congratulations.

1401
01:03:13,437 --> 01:03:14,837
I was really happy.

1402
01:03:14,907 --> 01:03:16,937
I was really happy. It was like a dream.

1403
01:03:17,507 --> 01:03:18,637
Okay.

1404
01:03:19,907 --> 01:03:23,007
I wanted to take the killing part,

1405
01:03:23,207 --> 01:03:25,117
but I will do my best for my part.

1406
01:03:26,547 --> 01:03:28,547
- The rest... - Right.

1407
01:03:28,647 --> 01:03:30,656
We'll look at Masato.

1408
01:03:30,657 --> 01:03:31,833
(They divide into two teams and start practicing.)

1409
01:03:31,857 --> 01:03:33,217
Five, six.

1410
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:35,356
Like this.

1411
01:03:35,357 --> 01:03:37,157
- Nice. - "Nice."

1412
01:03:37,957 --> 01:03:39,796
(The practice proceeds smoothly under the leadership...)

1413
01:03:39,797 --> 01:03:41,626
(of Na Yun Seo and Hsu Ching Yu.)

1414
01:03:41,627 --> 01:03:42,667
You can come like this.

1415
01:03:43,697 --> 01:03:45,396
(He's very satisfied.)

1416
01:03:45,397 --> 01:03:47,666
Hsu Ching Yu and Na Yun Seo.

1417
01:03:47,667 --> 01:03:48,836
Our babies...

1418
01:03:48,837 --> 01:03:51,777
did so well as the performance leaders.

1419
01:03:51,977 --> 01:03:53,206
It's tough,

1420
01:03:53,207 --> 01:03:54,877
but I'm trying to do my best.

1421
01:03:55,747 --> 01:03:56,877
Let's do this.

1422
01:03:57,047 --> 01:03:58,677
I'll teach the center position first.

1423
01:03:59,817 --> 01:04:03,686
(Na Yun Seo is teaching the choreography.)

1424
01:04:03,687 --> 01:04:06,017
(Studying his face)

1425
01:04:06,187 --> 01:04:07,527
You can do it like this.

1426
01:04:09,187 --> 01:04:12,296
How do you do this?

1427
01:04:12,297 --> 01:04:13,766
- Which one? - This one.

1428
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:14,796
(The two participants help Masato who is struggling.)

1429
01:04:14,797 --> 01:04:16,126
The right hand goes like this?

1430
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,236
That's right.

1431
01:04:17,237 --> 01:04:18,997
The first move should look more bittersweet.

1432
01:04:20,097 --> 01:04:21,366
There are many young members,

1433
01:04:21,367 --> 01:04:23,337
but they're like adults during practice.

1434
01:04:23,837 --> 01:04:26,107
Tatsuki and Hyun Jun.

1435
01:04:26,507 --> 01:04:29,847
I think they actively led us.

1436
01:04:30,177 --> 01:04:32,347
They put in so much effort...

1437
01:04:32,647 --> 01:04:34,927
even when they didn't know how the rankings would end up.

1438
01:04:35,887 --> 01:04:37,457
Your head moves too fast here, Han Eum.

1439
01:04:38,057 --> 01:04:39,616
I thought I should also do my best...

1440
01:04:39,617 --> 01:04:42,457
like them.

1441
01:04:45,057 --> 01:04:47,566
- Hello. - Hello.

1442
01:04:47,567 --> 01:04:48,967
Team "Sugar HIGH."

1443
01:04:49,127 --> 01:04:51,666
I think the Star Creators...

1444
01:04:51,667 --> 01:04:54,007
put the right people here.

1445
01:04:54,667 --> 01:04:57,176
Your images go so well with the song.

1446
01:04:57,177 --> 01:04:58,177
(They were born to perform "Sugar HIGH.")

1447
01:04:58,178 --> 01:05:00,447
Did you practice the choreography?

1448
01:05:00,507 --> 01:05:01,507
Yes.

1449
01:05:01,707 --> 01:05:02,707
Let me see.

1450
01:05:02,708 --> 01:05:04,217
The youngest.

1451
01:05:04,247 --> 01:05:06,176
Show us the cuteness of the youngest members!

1452
01:05:06,177 --> 01:05:07,416
It's too sweet.

1453
01:05:07,417 --> 01:05:10,287
All the young members are good at dancing.

1454
01:05:10,717 --> 01:05:11,786
Let's go!

1455
01:05:11,787 --> 01:05:13,707
(How will the youngest of "Sugar HIGH" perform?)

1456
01:05:18,657 --> 01:05:20,057
- They're doing well. - How cute.

1457
01:05:31,237 --> 01:05:32,406
This is amazing.

1458
01:05:32,407 --> 01:05:33,477
Blood sugar spike.

1459
01:05:34,107 --> 01:05:36,507
Of course. Our youngest members.

1460
01:05:37,107 --> 01:05:39,417
Did you hear about the cat?

1461
01:05:39,717 --> 01:05:40,917
- The cat? - The cat?

1462
01:05:41,247 --> 01:05:42,247
What?

1463
01:05:43,547 --> 01:05:45,687
You can't tell if it's a cat or a person.

1464
01:05:46,187 --> 01:05:47,187
Really?

1465
01:05:47,188 --> 01:05:48,526
It was a cat?

1466
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:49,886
Is it the cat's perspective?

1467
01:05:49,887 --> 01:05:51,757
The cat stuck in my head.

1468
01:05:51,897 --> 01:05:52,956
Quite strongly.

1469
01:05:52,957 --> 01:05:54,727
I think it goes well with the lyrics.

1470
01:05:55,127 --> 01:05:57,736
Stay by my side. Don't leave me alone.

1471
01:05:57,737 --> 01:05:58,996
- It goes well. - Right.

1472
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:00,866
- It was used as a metaphor. - Yes.

1473
01:06:00,867 --> 01:06:02,666
I really liked the cat theme.

1474
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:05,737
I think we could use that well in the performance.

1475
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:08,546
It would be really nice...

1476
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:10,976
if you think about whether or not...

1477
01:06:10,977 --> 01:06:12,653
you'll apply that to the choreography or performance.

1478
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:14,016
I really like the cat.

1479
01:06:14,017 --> 01:06:16,316
But if we apply that, it will become cute.

1480
01:06:16,317 --> 01:06:18,387
Yun Seo doesn't want to be cute.

1481
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:21,257
I don't want to be cute.

1482
01:06:21,527 --> 01:06:22,986
You don't like cute things?

1483
01:06:22,987 --> 01:06:24,197
He wants to be cool.

1484
01:06:24,627 --> 01:06:26,556
Ask them to add in some gunshots in the dance break.

1485
01:06:26,557 --> 01:06:27,896
Bang.

1486
01:06:27,897 --> 01:06:29,466
(Shooting at the Star Creators)

1487
01:06:29,467 --> 01:06:30,467
That's right.

1488
01:06:31,797 --> 01:06:34,937
What came to my mind was cotton candy.

1489
01:06:35,107 --> 01:06:37,236
Amusement parks also come to my mind.

1490
01:06:37,237 --> 01:06:38,437
Like being in a dream.

1491
01:06:38,777 --> 01:06:41,346
You wake up and see the Star Creators.

1492
01:06:41,347 --> 01:06:44,546
When you listen to the song, it feels like a soda.

1493
01:06:44,547 --> 01:06:46,416
- Soda. - I was reminded of that.

1494
01:06:46,417 --> 01:06:47,687
We could dance on water too.

1495
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:51,216
You have many ideas now.

1496
01:06:51,217 --> 01:06:54,087
I think you'll create a very popular performance.

1497
01:06:55,387 --> 01:06:57,397
Also...

1498
01:06:57,927 --> 01:07:00,996
If I suddenly speak rationally, out of the 12 members,

1499
01:07:00,997 --> 01:07:02,697
only six may perform,

1500
01:07:03,697 --> 01:07:06,796
- or even fewer. - Right.

1501
01:07:06,797 --> 01:07:08,117
The members performing this song.

1502
01:07:09,107 --> 01:07:12,337
Even if this becomes our last practice,

1503
01:07:13,307 --> 01:07:16,676
I still think our team should do well.

1504
01:07:16,677 --> 01:07:18,077
- You're really good. - Seriously.

1505
01:07:19,017 --> 01:07:20,647
We'll help each other a lot...

1506
01:07:20,947 --> 01:07:22,917
and do this together.

1507
01:07:23,087 --> 01:07:25,717
The biggest worry I have...

1508
01:07:26,457 --> 01:07:28,786
is that I might get eliminated.

1509
01:07:28,787 --> 01:07:31,057
(He might not get to perform on the stage.)

1510
01:07:31,257 --> 01:07:32,656
If I survive,

1511
01:07:32,657 --> 01:07:34,367
I want to give the very best performance.

1512
01:07:36,497 --> 01:07:38,197
Just as I've done so far,

1513
01:07:38,497 --> 01:07:41,607
I want to give a good performance with the cool older members.

1514
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:45,877
Let's focus on survival, guys.

1515
01:07:46,177 --> 01:07:47,207
We must survive.

1516
01:07:47,447 --> 01:07:48,606
One, two, three.

1517
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,916
- "Sugar HIGH!" - "Sugar HIGH!"

1518
01:07:50,917 --> 01:07:53,037
(Which members will be able to perform "Sugar HIGH?")

1519
01:07:55,687 --> 01:07:56,847
Who likes the song?

1520
01:07:57,357 --> 01:07:58,357
It's so nice.

1521
01:07:58,358 --> 01:07:59,617
(Everyone raises his hand!)

1522
01:07:59,787 --> 01:08:00,926
(Who wants to perform this song?)

1523
01:08:00,927 --> 01:08:03,387
(Many participants wanted to perform "Chains.")

1524
01:08:03,457 --> 01:08:04,556
(They showed enthusiastic reactions when the song was revealed.)

1525
01:08:04,557 --> 01:08:06,697
- It's so cool. - I really want to perform it.

1526
01:08:08,827 --> 01:08:12,497
(Team "Chains" members were satisfied with the result.)

1527
01:08:12,867 --> 01:08:15,237
I like the song, but the issue is survival.

1528
01:08:16,037 --> 01:08:18,037
(Currently, Team "Chains" has 12 members.)

1529
01:08:18,337 --> 01:08:20,036
(But there will only be 6 final members for the song.)

1530
01:08:20,037 --> 01:08:22,176
I feel like readjusting the members...

1531
01:08:22,177 --> 01:08:23,507
will be very hard.

1532
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:27,117
My teammates are ranked very high.

1533
01:08:27,887 --> 01:08:29,486
Sang Won, Kang Min,

1534
01:08:29,487 --> 01:08:32,187
Jun Seo, Leo, and An Xin.

1535
01:08:32,457 --> 01:08:34,526
The 5 of them are in the top 8.

1536
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:35,556
(5 members of Team "Chains" are included in the top 8.)

1537
01:08:35,557 --> 01:08:37,697
Not everyone can perform the song in this situation.

1538
01:08:38,297 --> 01:08:41,167
It'll be really hard to secure my position.

1539
01:08:41,597 --> 01:08:42,967
Even if I survive,

1540
01:08:43,197 --> 01:08:45,397
I'm bound to get pushed off.

1541
01:08:46,667 --> 01:08:49,507
(It's time to decide on the leader of Team "Chains.")

1542
01:08:49,607 --> 01:08:51,977
Who wants to be the leader of Team "Chains?"

1543
01:08:52,407 --> 01:08:55,477
(Reading the room in the most intense way)

1544
01:08:57,417 --> 01:08:58,847
Since no one raised his hand,

1545
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:01,917
I thought, "Do I need to be the leader again?"

1546
01:09:03,517 --> 01:09:06,117
I've been the leader three times.

1547
01:09:07,957 --> 01:09:10,063
Someone who has never done it might want to give it a go.

1548
01:09:10,087 --> 01:09:11,157
That's right.

1549
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:12,496
(At that moment, Kim Geon Woo recommends Yoo Kang Min.)

1550
01:09:12,497 --> 01:09:14,143
- Kang Min, do you want to try it? - Try it.

1551
01:09:14,167 --> 01:09:15,197
Am I capable?

1552
01:09:18,637 --> 01:09:20,497
To be honest, I wanted to try it.

1553
01:09:21,267 --> 01:09:24,037
Does no one want the position?

1554
01:09:28,007 --> 01:09:29,747
It looked like Jun Seo wanted the position,

1555
01:09:30,047 --> 01:09:31,217
so I gave up.

1556
01:09:31,817 --> 01:09:32,847
In that case...

1557
01:09:33,577 --> 01:09:35,947
Okay. I'll be the leader for the fourth time.

1558
01:09:36,847 --> 01:09:38,287
I think I can put it here.

1559
01:09:39,757 --> 01:09:40,886
I'll put on the leader sticker.

1560
01:09:40,887 --> 01:09:41,987
- Okay. - Okay.

1561
01:09:42,387 --> 01:09:43,656
- Congratulations. - Okay.

1562
01:09:43,657 --> 01:09:45,273
(Congratulations on becoming the leader.)

1563
01:09:45,297 --> 01:09:48,097
I became the leader for the fourth time in a row.

1564
01:09:49,097 --> 01:09:50,226
(Signal Song Test)

1565
01:09:50,227 --> 01:09:53,267
(He began as the leader of Team 2 Star.)

1566
01:09:53,567 --> 01:09:54,606
(1-on-1 Class Battle)

1567
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:57,407
(He did well as the leader of "Whiplash" Team 1.)

1568
01:09:57,607 --> 01:09:58,706
(Class Switch Position Battle)

1569
01:09:58,707 --> 01:10:03,947
(In Team "Bad" as well, Kim Jun Seo became the leader.)

1570
01:10:03,977 --> 01:10:06,647
I don't think this has happened in other survival shows.

1571
01:10:07,217 --> 01:10:08,517
Let's go.

1572
01:10:09,647 --> 01:10:12,217
Raise your hand if you want the killing part.

1573
01:10:12,987 --> 01:10:14,457
One, two, three.

1574
01:10:15,087 --> 01:10:16,126
Four.

1575
01:10:16,127 --> 01:10:17,226
Five, six...

1576
01:10:17,227 --> 01:10:18,957
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1577
01:10:19,697 --> 01:10:25,797
(The killing part needs to portray the sexy mood of the song.)

1578
01:10:25,937 --> 01:10:27,466
(Not only that, it takes up a big chunk of the song.)

1579
01:10:27,467 --> 01:10:29,036
The song is 3 minutes and 20 seconds,

1580
01:10:29,037 --> 01:10:30,567
but the killing part is 70 seconds.

1581
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:32,097
It's nearly the entire song.

1582
01:10:35,047 --> 01:10:37,277
Isn't this killing part insane? It's 70 seconds long.

1583
01:10:37,917 --> 01:10:39,277
It's very long,

1584
01:10:39,347 --> 01:10:40,846
and I want to show myself more.

1585
01:10:40,847 --> 01:10:41,987
I really want to do it.

1586
01:10:42,447 --> 01:10:44,017
When I performed "Whiplash,"

1587
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:46,037
I couldn't do the killing part despite my wish.

1588
01:10:46,117 --> 01:10:48,757
When I performed "Breathe," I couldn't do it despite my wish.

1589
01:10:49,127 --> 01:10:51,797
Thus, I really want to do it this time.

1590
01:10:52,497 --> 01:10:56,327
(A total of 6 participants prepare for the killing part.)

1591
01:10:56,867 --> 01:10:57,897
Come here.

1592
01:10:59,067 --> 01:11:00,137
Come here.

1593
01:11:01,407 --> 01:11:02,466
(Kim Jun Seo suddenly calls over Lee Sang Won.)

1594
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:05,977
To be honest, I think you should do the killing part...

1595
01:11:06,807 --> 01:11:07,907
to make the song shine.

1596
01:11:09,707 --> 01:11:10,976
(When the participants were applying for the killing part)

1597
01:11:10,977 --> 01:11:12,817
Okay. Sang Won, aren't you going to go for it?

1598
01:11:12,877 --> 01:11:16,047
(Lee Sang Won didn't apply for the killing part.)

1599
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:18,257
(Nodding)

1600
01:11:19,917 --> 01:11:21,327
- Hey, go for it. - What?

1601
01:11:21,857 --> 01:11:23,127
I don't have the confidence.

1602
01:11:28,527 --> 01:11:30,726
If Sang Won does the killing part,

1603
01:11:30,727 --> 01:11:33,637
he'll lead the team to first place.

1604
01:11:34,937 --> 01:11:36,283
Even if we divide up the parts now,

1605
01:11:36,307 --> 01:11:37,736
the members will change.

1606
01:11:37,737 --> 01:11:40,537
Then we'll need to divide up the parts again.

1607
01:11:41,347 --> 01:11:42,747
(Scratching)

1608
01:11:42,777 --> 01:11:44,617
I want you to do it.

1609
01:11:47,847 --> 01:11:50,717
You'll regret it if we can't change who gets the killing part later.

1610
01:12:03,067 --> 01:12:04,167
Let's go.

1611
01:12:06,397 --> 01:12:08,437
(The first applicant, Chen)

1612
01:12:14,137 --> 01:12:15,707
Okay.

1613
01:12:17,347 --> 01:12:18,977
- He has a nice voice. - Okay.

1614
01:12:19,047 --> 01:12:20,746
(Then Yoo Kang Min, Jun Lee Jeong, and Kim Geon Woo try out...)

1615
01:12:20,747 --> 01:12:22,417
(for the killing part.)

1616
01:12:28,227 --> 01:12:31,927
(Next, Zhou An Xin tries out for the killing part.)

1617
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:42,337
May I give it another try?

1618
01:12:44,137 --> 01:12:45,677
Let's check out Zhang Jia Hao first.

1619
01:12:45,937 --> 01:12:48,176
- Okay. - All right.

1620
01:12:48,177 --> 01:12:51,216
A sexy concept like this one really suits...

1621
01:12:51,217 --> 01:12:52,647
Zhang Jia Hao.

1622
01:12:52,747 --> 01:12:56,217
I felt like I hadn't shown a good performance.

1623
01:12:56,287 --> 01:12:58,056
"What will I do if I can't do the killing part?"

1624
01:12:58,057 --> 01:12:59,857
I worried about that a lot.

1625
01:13:00,417 --> 01:13:02,657
(Lastly, Zhang Jia Hao tries out for the killing part.)

1626
01:13:10,297 --> 01:13:12,037
(Impressed)

1627
01:13:16,307 --> 01:13:17,636
An Xin, if you're dissatisfied,

1628
01:13:17,637 --> 01:13:19,736
do you want to try again?

1629
01:13:19,737 --> 01:13:21,177
- Yes. - Okay.

1630
01:13:21,477 --> 01:13:23,047
It's the very last try, okay?

1631
01:13:23,307 --> 01:13:24,377
- All right. - Okay.

1632
01:13:33,957 --> 01:13:35,386
- It's okay. - It's okay.

1633
01:13:35,387 --> 01:13:36,757
- Well done. - It was good.

1634
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:38,297
All right.

1635
01:13:38,957 --> 01:13:41,296
I think it should definitely go to Zhang Jia Hao.

1636
01:13:41,297 --> 01:13:43,396
His dance was really nice.

1637
01:13:43,397 --> 01:13:44,896
He had a really good vibe.

1638
01:13:44,897 --> 01:13:46,837
My choice is Zhang Jia Hao as well.

1639
01:13:48,037 --> 01:13:50,036
In terms of dance, Zhang Jia Hao is unrivaled.

1640
01:13:50,037 --> 01:13:53,007
His dance and expressions were different.

1641
01:13:53,337 --> 01:13:56,546
Zhang Jia Hao comes to mind first when I think of a sexy concept.

1642
01:13:56,547 --> 01:13:57,893
(Zhang Jia Hao made his presence known with his sexy dance.)

1643
01:13:57,917 --> 01:13:59,746
We'll announce the result.

1644
01:13:59,747 --> 01:14:01,286
(Which member of Team "Chains" will get the killing part?)

1645
01:14:01,287 --> 01:14:04,317
All right. The first killing part goes...

1646
01:14:08,557 --> 01:14:10,827
to Zhang Jia Hao. Congratulations.

1647
01:14:11,857 --> 01:14:12,996
Thank you.

1648
01:14:12,997 --> 01:14:14,837
(Team "Chains," Killing Part 1, Zhang Jia Hao)

1649
01:14:15,267 --> 01:14:16,297
All right.

1650
01:14:17,567 --> 01:14:18,666
The next one goes to...

1651
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:20,513
(Which member of Team "Chains" will get the second killing part?)

1652
01:14:20,537 --> 01:14:21,637
The next one goes to...

1653
01:14:24,167 --> 01:14:25,177
Zhou An Xin.

1654
01:14:25,607 --> 01:14:29,206
(Team "Chains," Killing Part 2, Zhou An Xin)

1655
01:14:29,207 --> 01:14:30,776
- All right. - Thank you.

1656
01:14:30,777 --> 01:14:31,877
An Xin.

1657
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:34,687
The killing part is the face of the performance.

1658
01:14:35,517 --> 01:14:36,547
I vote for An Xin.

1659
01:14:37,317 --> 01:14:39,617
I think An Xin should be a candidate.

1660
01:14:40,417 --> 01:14:42,487
His voice was very nice.

1661
01:14:43,457 --> 01:14:45,427
- An Xin. - Thank you.

1662
01:14:45,697 --> 01:14:46,996
(Zhou An Xin finally seized his first killing part.)

1663
01:14:46,997 --> 01:14:48,667
- Finally. - Thank you.

1664
01:14:49,027 --> 01:14:50,967
- Good luck. Well done. - Okay.

1665
01:14:51,437 --> 01:14:52,537
I'm so happy.

1666
01:14:52,937 --> 01:14:55,207
I'll work the hardest.

1667
01:14:56,407 --> 01:14:57,977
(All Star Camp)

1668
01:14:59,207 --> 01:15:01,006
(Zhou An Xin visits Lee Sang Won's room.)

1669
01:15:01,007 --> 01:15:02,147
What is it?

1670
01:15:04,307 --> 01:15:05,576
- Are you disappointed? - What?

1671
01:15:05,577 --> 01:15:06,577
Are you disappointed?

1672
01:15:08,117 --> 01:15:09,247
I'm disappointed.

1673
01:15:09,517 --> 01:15:10,846
- Then why didn't you go for it? - What?

1674
01:15:10,847 --> 01:15:11,917
Why didn't you go for it?

1675
01:15:14,017 --> 01:15:15,227
I lacked confidence.

1676
01:15:16,857 --> 01:15:19,556
It's true that I've become timid.

1677
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:21,367
The killing part felt like a burden.

1678
01:15:21,927 --> 01:15:24,896
(Team "like JENNIE" tasted a bitter loss...)

1679
01:15:24,897 --> 01:15:28,207
(during the Class Switch Position Battle.)

1680
01:15:28,367 --> 01:15:31,737
(The team ranked the lowest within the dance position.)

1681
01:15:34,977 --> 01:15:36,777
Did I ruin the quality of the performance...

1682
01:15:36,977 --> 01:15:38,537
as the member who did the killing part?

1683
01:15:38,947 --> 01:15:40,746
I did think that the result...

1684
01:15:40,747 --> 01:15:42,317
might be my fault.

1685
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,757
I don't know.

1686
01:15:45,457 --> 01:15:47,257
Once the team members come down to six,

1687
01:15:48,427 --> 01:15:50,157
the parts will get redistributed.

1688
01:15:50,657 --> 01:15:52,357
I don't know if I'll give it a try then.

1689
01:15:52,897 --> 01:15:54,897
If I give it a try then,

1690
01:15:54,927 --> 01:15:56,227
I'll feel bad for you.

1691
01:15:57,727 --> 01:15:59,597
It doesn't matter. It's for the performance.

1692
01:15:59,697 --> 01:16:00,897
It's for a good performance.

1693
01:16:01,067 --> 01:16:02,967
I'll give it a try again.

1694
01:16:04,237 --> 01:16:05,637
(The day ends.)

1695
01:16:07,637 --> 01:16:11,777
(The practice room for Team "Chains")

1696
01:16:11,917 --> 01:16:14,416
(The two killing part members are practicing side by side.)

1697
01:16:14,417 --> 01:16:16,917
Hao and I are very close.

1698
01:16:18,617 --> 01:16:20,716
We entered the show as the same team.

1699
01:16:20,717 --> 01:16:23,557
We were the killing part candidates for the Signal Song Test.

1700
01:16:23,757 --> 01:16:27,897
This time as well, Hao and I became the killing part candidates.

1701
01:16:30,067 --> 01:16:32,867
I'm nervous because Hao is really good at this song.

1702
01:16:34,367 --> 01:16:35,466
Gosh, Hao.

1703
01:16:35,467 --> 01:16:36,506
(Last night, Zhou An Xin's room)

1704
01:16:36,507 --> 01:16:38,677
Why is Hao in the same team as me?

1705
01:16:39,307 --> 01:16:41,477
Hao can dance so well.

1706
01:16:41,977 --> 01:16:43,617
You just need to focus on your own thing.

1707
01:16:43,877 --> 01:16:47,247
My heart aches when I compete against Hao.

1708
01:16:47,417 --> 01:16:49,847
But this is a survival show.

1709
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:53,516
I need to be better at the killing part...

1710
01:16:53,517 --> 01:16:54,657
in order to survive.

1711
01:16:56,587 --> 01:16:58,156
I feel bad for Hao,

1712
01:16:58,157 --> 01:17:01,697
but I'll practice hard and do the killing part better.

1713
01:17:03,227 --> 01:17:10,037
(What will become of the killing part of Team "Chains?")

1714
01:17:11,737 --> 01:17:13,406
What's he saying?

1715
01:17:13,407 --> 01:17:14,876
What's he saying?

1716
01:17:14,877 --> 01:17:16,797
(Which practice room is full of scary comments?)

1717
01:17:17,277 --> 01:17:20,377
(Chen is angry?)

1718
01:17:21,077 --> 01:17:22,247
What's he saying?

1719
01:17:22,687 --> 01:17:25,056
(Team "MAIN DISH" is practicing hard.)

1720
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:26,716
It's mainly rock sounds.

1721
01:17:26,717 --> 01:17:28,256
There's a big blow.

1722
01:17:28,257 --> 01:17:29,657
I thought we could make it cool.

1723
01:17:31,627 --> 01:17:32,997
The choreography was nice,

1724
01:17:33,157 --> 01:17:36,396
and I thought it would suit my voice.

1725
01:17:36,397 --> 01:17:37,527
I was dying to perform.

1726
01:17:38,337 --> 01:17:39,936
(Let's go, we're the main dish)

1727
01:17:39,937 --> 01:17:42,637
(How were the parts assigned?)

1728
01:17:42,807 --> 01:17:44,776
Let's pick our leader first.

1729
01:17:44,777 --> 01:17:45,937
Who wants to be the leader?

1730
01:17:46,107 --> 01:17:48,606
- Me. - Okay.

1731
01:17:48,607 --> 01:17:49,806
- Li Zi Hao. - Li Zi Hao.

1732
01:17:49,807 --> 01:17:51,247
I agree.

1733
01:17:51,447 --> 01:17:53,377
He's been doing this longer than me,

1734
01:17:53,547 --> 01:17:55,347
and I thought he'd have more experience.

1735
01:17:55,417 --> 01:17:56,616
I trust him.

1736
01:17:56,617 --> 01:17:58,687
I believe he'll lead us well.

1737
01:17:59,457 --> 01:18:02,057
(Zi Hao is the leader of Team "MAIN DISH.")

1738
01:18:03,257 --> 01:18:04,757
Let's go, Leader.

1739
01:18:06,197 --> 01:18:09,267
Shall we distribute the parts now?

1740
01:18:09,497 --> 01:18:10,627
Let's do it.

1741
01:18:12,137 --> 01:18:14,177
It's my 1st time distributing parts with 12 people.

1742
01:18:14,337 --> 01:18:16,237
Two people have to sing a part.

1743
01:18:17,367 --> 01:18:18,407
- All right. - Rapper.

1744
01:18:18,577 --> 01:18:20,883
- Who wants to be the main rapper? - Who wants to be the main rapper?

1745
01:18:20,907 --> 01:18:22,006
Show of hands.

1746
01:18:22,007 --> 01:18:23,376
(The signal song's main rapper, Choco1's rapper, DRIPPIN's rapper)

1747
01:18:23,377 --> 01:18:26,016
(The signal song's rap unit, rapper)

1748
01:18:26,017 --> 01:18:27,247
We have six people.

1749
01:18:28,587 --> 01:18:31,356
There were too many participants who were rappers.

1750
01:18:31,357 --> 01:18:33,817
And they were all so good.

1751
01:18:34,187 --> 01:18:35,727
Is anyone ready?

1752
01:18:36,157 --> 01:18:38,596
- I'll go first. - Okay.

1753
01:18:38,597 --> 01:18:39,597
Si Hwan.

1754
01:18:40,897 --> 01:18:45,437
(The main rapper's part is characterized by its intensity.)

1755
01:18:47,067 --> 01:18:49,407
(Candidate 1 for the main rapper, Kim Si Hwan)

1756
01:18:55,377 --> 01:18:56,607
"Good luck."

1757
01:18:57,177 --> 01:18:59,976
(Candidate 2 for the main rapper, Kim Dong Yun)

1758
01:18:59,977 --> 01:19:03,286
(Candidate 3: Yeom Ye Chan, Candidate 4: Li Zi Hao)

1759
01:19:03,287 --> 01:19:06,556
(Candidate 5 for the main rapper, He Zhong Xing)

1760
01:19:06,557 --> 01:19:07,916
(Impressed)

1761
01:19:07,917 --> 01:19:09,927
- He's got the same tone. - That was insane.

1762
01:19:09,987 --> 01:19:11,826
- I like it. - He's good.

1763
01:19:11,827 --> 01:19:13,397
Thank you.

1764
01:19:13,757 --> 01:19:15,897
- Tae Jo? - Let's go.

1765
01:19:16,027 --> 01:19:17,196
- You have to. - Okay.

1766
01:19:17,197 --> 01:19:19,066
- Rapping is all about confidence. - Okay.

1767
01:19:19,067 --> 01:19:20,766
- He's good on stage. - He is.

1768
01:19:20,767 --> 01:19:22,337
I'm not on the stage, so...

1769
01:19:22,407 --> 01:19:23,707
- It is practice. - Yes.

1770
01:19:28,807 --> 01:19:32,247
(Tae Jo made a mistake in the rapping part.)

1771
01:19:35,387 --> 01:19:38,217
We listened to Tae Jo's rap part, and I was shocked...

1772
01:19:38,487 --> 01:19:39,687
by how bad he was.

1773
01:19:40,357 --> 01:19:41,387
Okay.

1774
01:19:41,857 --> 01:19:43,027
We have the result.

1775
01:19:43,287 --> 01:19:45,427
The main rapper is Si Hwan.

1776
01:19:46,027 --> 01:19:48,826
(Team "MAIN DISH" Main Rapper 1, Kim Si Hwan)

1777
01:19:48,827 --> 01:19:50,196
Zhong Xing is the other main rapper.

1778
01:19:50,197 --> 01:19:52,077
(Team "MAIN DISH" Main Rapper 2, He Zhong Xing)

1779
01:19:55,867 --> 01:19:58,976
We'll get the applicants for the first sub-rapper.

1780
01:19:58,977 --> 01:20:00,457
Who wants to be the first sub-rapper?

1781
01:20:00,837 --> 01:20:01,876
- Hao? - Me.

1782
01:20:01,877 --> 01:20:03,106
(Zi Hao, Ye Chan, and Dong Yun apply.)

1783
01:20:03,107 --> 01:20:04,277
Let's listen to them.

1784
01:20:05,047 --> 01:20:07,247
(But Tae Jo isn't applying.)

1785
01:20:08,547 --> 01:20:09,616
- Tae Jo. - Yes?

1786
01:20:09,617 --> 01:20:11,137
You're not going to try it out, right?

1787
01:20:11,457 --> 01:20:13,257
Will you? Do you want to?

1788
01:20:13,857 --> 01:20:15,287
Just try it. It's fine.

1789
01:20:15,687 --> 01:20:16,957
If you want to, I mean.

1790
01:20:19,957 --> 01:20:21,567
I had already given up.

1791
01:20:21,997 --> 01:20:24,767
I knew that I had to do it,

1792
01:20:25,167 --> 01:20:26,537
but I just couldn't.

1793
01:20:27,097 --> 01:20:29,966
(2 Star Camp)

1794
01:20:29,967 --> 01:20:31,336
(Zi Hao, Guang Xu, Bo Wen, and Zhong Xing)

1795
01:20:31,337 --> 01:20:32,677
(Knocking)

1796
01:20:33,937 --> 01:20:35,477
- Is... - Yes?

1797
01:20:36,107 --> 01:20:38,277
- Zi Hao inside? - He's taking a shower.

1798
01:20:38,547 --> 01:20:40,446
- A shower? Okay. - Who was it?

1799
01:20:40,447 --> 01:20:42,747
(Zi Hao is showering while singing the signal song.)

1800
01:20:44,017 --> 01:20:45,017
(20 minutes later)

1801
01:20:45,018 --> 01:20:47,086
(Zi Hao's bathroom concert is at its climax.)

1802
01:20:47,087 --> 01:20:48,387
- Zi Hao. - Yes?

1803
01:20:48,527 --> 01:20:49,687
- Still in the shower? - Yes.

1804
01:20:50,787 --> 01:20:52,197
Oh, he's still in the shower.

1805
01:20:54,327 --> 01:20:56,166
- Zi Hao! - Yes?

1806
01:20:56,167 --> 01:20:58,067
- Someone's looking for you. - What?

1807
01:20:58,867 --> 01:21:00,336
One of our teammates came by twice.

1808
01:21:00,337 --> 01:21:02,366
You need to finish up. He's been looking for you.

1809
01:21:02,367 --> 01:21:03,436
Okay.

1810
01:21:03,437 --> 01:21:07,507
(Zi Hao's room)

1811
01:21:07,907 --> 01:21:12,047
(Tae Jo waits for him by the staircase.)

1812
01:21:13,347 --> 01:21:14,547
What are you doing here?

1813
01:21:14,717 --> 01:21:16,147
I'm waiting for Zi Hao.

1814
01:21:23,187 --> 01:21:27,657
(10 more minutes passed.)

1815
01:21:28,627 --> 01:21:31,167
(Tae Jo is back.)

1816
01:21:31,567 --> 01:21:33,337
- Hey. - Hi.

1817
01:21:34,067 --> 01:21:35,507
Do you want a snack?

1818
01:21:35,867 --> 01:21:36,867
Thanks.

1819
01:21:37,567 --> 01:21:39,977
You're not feeling so well today, right?

1820
01:21:41,337 --> 01:21:42,907
I'm not.

1821
01:21:44,107 --> 01:21:45,977
Why not? Didn't you want to be on this team?

1822
01:21:46,447 --> 01:21:47,817
I was glad to be on the team.

1823
01:21:48,317 --> 01:21:50,287
But no matter how hard I practice...

1824
01:21:51,317 --> 01:21:53,087
- You feel like being eliminated. - I do.

1825
01:21:53,587 --> 01:21:55,387
So, I was out of it.

1826
01:21:56,127 --> 01:21:57,727
I didn't want to practice.

1827
01:21:58,197 --> 01:21:59,296
I thought,

1828
01:21:59,297 --> 01:22:01,617
"Why do I have to practice when I won't be able to do it?"

1829
01:22:01,697 --> 01:22:03,097
I saw it. It shows.

1830
01:22:03,867 --> 01:22:06,067
You were totally out of it.

1831
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:08,767
There was no glow in your eyes.

1832
01:22:10,667 --> 01:22:12,536
(Zi Hao watched Tae Jo closely...)

1833
01:22:12,537 --> 01:22:14,907
(when distributing the parts.)

1834
01:22:16,677 --> 01:22:18,107
Honestly,

1835
01:22:18,377 --> 01:22:21,117
I think 99 percent of our team will be eliminated.

1836
01:22:21,277 --> 01:22:22,286
(37th, 34th, 19th, 40th, 36th, and 39th)

1837
01:22:22,287 --> 01:22:24,716
(The members of Team "MAIN DISH" aren't ranked high enough.)

1838
01:22:24,717 --> 01:22:27,656
(28th, 31st, 42nd, 48th, 43rd, and 44th)

1839
01:22:27,657 --> 01:22:29,927
I don't want to be eliminated either.

1840
01:22:31,754 --> 01:22:33,327
We'll have to hang in there.

1841
01:22:34,027 --> 01:22:35,067
Hang in there!

1842
01:22:35,897 --> 01:22:36,967
Endure it!

1843
01:22:37,797 --> 01:22:39,496
- Endure it! - You're so...

1844
01:22:39,497 --> 01:22:40,996
(Laughing)

1845
01:22:40,997 --> 01:22:42,737
Where does your energy come from?

1846
01:22:44,667 --> 01:22:45,707
I tell myself,

1847
01:22:46,237 --> 01:22:49,476
"I can't give up before my fans do."

1848
01:22:49,477 --> 01:22:51,917
(I can't give up before my fans do.)

1849
01:22:54,577 --> 01:22:56,887
Imagine how disappointed they'd be...

1850
01:22:58,457 --> 01:23:01,726
when they rooted for me and voted for me.

1851
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:03,087
(Zi Hao, I'm always on your side.)

1852
01:23:03,387 --> 01:23:05,827
I don't know how this will turn out,

1853
01:23:06,327 --> 01:23:08,767
but I don't want to care too much about the rankings.

1854
01:23:09,397 --> 01:23:12,837
I'll focus on what I can do at the moment.

1855
01:23:14,137 --> 01:23:19,207
I think it's your job to stay mentally strong.

1856
01:23:19,637 --> 01:23:23,376
Everyone has a building inside them.

1857
01:23:23,377 --> 01:23:24,377
Okay.

1858
01:23:25,517 --> 01:23:27,197
If you don't stay mentally strong like me,

1859
01:23:28,717 --> 01:23:31,447
that building collapses.

1860
01:23:32,287 --> 01:23:37,127
Once it collapses, it won't be easy to fix it.

1861
01:23:37,287 --> 01:23:42,266
(Zi Hao warmly comforts Tae Jo.)

1862
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:44,696
Mnet, that was a great line by me.

1863
01:23:44,697 --> 01:23:45,836
Make sure to air it.

1864
01:23:45,837 --> 01:23:47,567
(Air this part.)

1865
01:23:49,967 --> 01:23:51,777
It's similar to that umbrella quote.

1866
01:23:52,837 --> 01:23:55,947
(I've been rained on, so it's my turn to hold the umbrella.)

1867
01:23:56,147 --> 01:23:58,777
(Laughing)

1868
01:23:59,077 --> 01:24:01,177
What are you talking about?

1869
01:24:02,387 --> 01:24:03,417
You're funny.

1870
01:24:04,017 --> 01:24:06,117
Tae Jo, your smile makes me happy.

1871
01:24:08,227 --> 01:24:10,427
I was deeply touched.

1872
01:24:10,619 --> 01:24:12,319
I wanted to learn from him.

1873
01:24:13,209 --> 01:24:14,978
He believed in me,

1874
01:24:15,026 --> 01:24:16,526
so I was going to work hard.

1875
01:24:17,997 --> 01:24:21,737
(He got himself together, thanks to Zi Hao.)

1876
01:24:26,177 --> 01:24:29,046
(The next day)

1877
01:24:29,047 --> 01:24:30,807
We're actually meeting them?

1878
01:24:31,162 --> 01:24:32,902
- I'm nervous. - I can't wait.

1879
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,946
We should ask them...

1880
01:24:34,947 --> 01:24:36,687
what type of attitude we should have.

1881
01:24:36,887 --> 01:24:39,157
(Team "MAIN DISH" is gathered in front of a screen.)

1882
01:24:39,487 --> 01:24:40,587
I'm nervous.

1883
01:24:46,327 --> 01:24:48,697
(PLAVE appears.)

1884
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:50,326
- Hello! - Hello!

1885
01:24:50,327 --> 01:24:53,036
(Their first meeting with PLAVE, the producers.)

1886
01:24:53,037 --> 01:24:54,237
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

1887
01:24:54,437 --> 01:24:56,007
- Hello. - It's a pleasure.

1888
01:25:00,077 --> 01:25:01,237
Let's take our seats.

1889
01:25:01,607 --> 01:25:02,747
This is pretty awkward.

1890
01:25:03,607 --> 01:25:04,777
- They're so cool. - Awesome.

1891
01:25:06,677 --> 01:25:07,947
I was exhilarated.

1892
01:25:08,017 --> 01:25:10,446
It was like a meet-and-greet over a video call.

1893
01:25:10,447 --> 01:25:13,057
It was fascinating to think that they were looking at me.

1894
01:25:13,357 --> 01:25:15,657
They're so handsome.

1895
01:25:16,357 --> 01:25:17,987
Yes, we think so too.

1896
01:25:18,557 --> 01:25:19,626
Well, they're celebrities.

1897
01:25:19,627 --> 01:25:22,397
We don't have any pores.

1898
01:25:22,727 --> 01:25:25,696
(PLAVE's type of joke)

1899
01:25:25,697 --> 01:25:27,436
We worked really hard on this song.

1900
01:25:27,437 --> 01:25:28,467
We did.

1901
01:25:28,807 --> 01:25:30,606
We can't wait to find out how you interpreted it.

1902
01:25:30,607 --> 01:25:32,106
- I'm dying to know. - So am I.

1903
01:25:32,107 --> 01:25:33,737
So, can we see it?

1904
01:25:34,577 --> 01:25:35,776
- Let's go! - Okay.

1905
01:25:35,777 --> 01:25:37,246
(Performing in front of PLAVE)

1906
01:25:37,247 --> 01:25:38,417
Good luck!

1907
01:25:50,557 --> 01:25:51,557
Thank you.

1908
01:25:52,927 --> 01:25:54,656
- There you have it. - That's it.

1909
01:25:54,657 --> 01:25:56,196
- Yes, they're number one. - Let's do this!

1910
01:25:56,197 --> 01:25:57,466
Your energy is so "MAIN DISH."

1911
01:25:57,467 --> 01:25:59,547
You're definitely placing first. I love your energy.

1912
01:26:00,437 --> 01:26:02,366
Now that we've met,

1913
01:26:02,367 --> 01:26:04,766
I'll give you some pointers.

1914
01:26:04,767 --> 01:26:06,507
- Sure. - We'd like that.

1915
01:26:07,037 --> 01:26:08,576
When you go, "Taste the main dish,"

1916
01:26:08,577 --> 01:26:10,547
- you sweep your hand, right? - Yes.

1917
01:26:13,377 --> 01:26:15,717
Go like this to make it sexier.

1918
01:26:16,347 --> 01:26:17,963
- As if you were using your tongue. - Like this.

1919
01:26:17,987 --> 01:26:20,456
We came up with this move...

1920
01:26:20,457 --> 01:26:23,927
from how we lick the food off the knife.

1921
01:26:25,957 --> 01:26:27,226
It'd look cooler...

1922
01:26:27,227 --> 01:26:29,167
if you could express that and make it sexier.

1923
01:26:30,027 --> 01:26:33,467
We actually came up with the introduction.

1924
01:26:33,767 --> 01:26:34,767
Okay.

1925
01:26:34,768 --> 01:26:37,407
There will be food in the introduction.

1926
01:26:37,807 --> 01:26:41,807
Mean comments about us will pop out,

1927
01:26:42,047 --> 01:26:44,406
and we'll break them and start...

1928
01:26:44,407 --> 01:26:46,047
by saying, "Whatever."

1929
01:26:46,177 --> 01:26:49,547
(What does PLAVE think about their introduction?)

1930
01:26:51,347 --> 01:26:54,017
That was my original intention!

1931
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:56,187
Let's go!

1932
01:26:57,627 --> 01:26:59,326
We keep coming up with new ideas...

1933
01:26:59,327 --> 01:27:02,697
and brainstormed together.

1934
01:27:02,727 --> 01:27:04,997
I was proud to get their compliments.

1935
01:27:05,597 --> 01:27:07,396
- I love it. - Yes.

1936
01:27:07,397 --> 01:27:10,007
You'll keep coming up with new ideas,

1937
01:27:10,167 --> 01:27:12,136
and we'll meet on the day we record the song, right?

1938
01:27:12,137 --> 01:27:13,777
We'll revise some parts that day.

1939
01:27:14,407 --> 01:27:15,807
- Sure. - Great.

1940
01:27:16,147 --> 01:27:17,276
Actually...

1941
01:27:17,277 --> 01:27:20,677
Our overall rankings...

1942
01:27:21,347 --> 01:27:25,617
(Team "MAIN DISH" is at risk of getting eliminated.)

1943
01:27:25,817 --> 01:27:28,686
I'm not sure if we can all survive until the recording session.

1944
01:27:28,687 --> 01:27:30,233
But we'll do our best to prepare for this.

1945
01:27:30,257 --> 01:27:32,797
If we do survive, we'll definitely come and see you.

1946
01:27:32,897 --> 01:27:34,956
- Gosh, we ought to meet. - We must meet.

1947
01:27:34,957 --> 01:27:36,773
- I'll meet you in person for sure. - No matter what.

1948
01:27:36,797 --> 01:27:38,026
- I'll remember all of you. - Let's focus on the meeting.

1949
01:27:38,027 --> 01:27:39,737
- If not, I'll meet you in private. - Yes.

1950
01:27:40,167 --> 01:27:41,536
We'd be grateful if you could remember us.

1951
01:27:41,537 --> 01:27:43,007
- We'll try to be there. - Yes.

1952
01:27:44,437 --> 01:27:48,106
It'd be amazing if we could meet all of you at the session.

1953
01:27:48,107 --> 01:27:49,576
- Yes. - My gosh.

1954
01:27:49,577 --> 01:27:51,537
- You can do it. You can survive. - You got this.

1955
01:27:52,247 --> 01:27:53,577
I really hope we can all survive.

1956
01:27:54,477 --> 01:27:58,556
So many of us on Team "MAIN DISH" hold ranks...

1957
01:27:58,557 --> 01:28:00,657
in the 30s and 40s.

1958
01:28:01,657 --> 01:28:04,226
- This can be a good performance. - Right, as long as we survive...

1959
01:28:04,227 --> 01:28:05,496
I agree.

1960
01:28:05,497 --> 01:28:07,156
If I were to perform this song, I could kill it.

1961
01:28:07,157 --> 01:28:08,157
- I could kill it too. - You can do it.

1962
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:09,666
We'll be grateful...

1963
01:28:09,667 --> 01:28:11,227
- once we get to perform this. - Right.

1964
01:28:11,267 --> 01:28:12,797
Even when we're practicing,

1965
01:28:14,237 --> 01:28:16,007
I can't help but sigh.

1966
01:28:16,507 --> 01:28:19,037
I feel very insecure. Of course, I feel utterly anxious.

1967
01:28:19,977 --> 01:28:21,236
(Kim Si Hwan: 43rd place, Kim In Hu: 44th place, )

1968
01:28:21,237 --> 01:28:22,376
(Yoon Min: 48th place)

1969
01:28:22,377 --> 01:28:23,777
It will be a pity, though.

1970
01:28:24,777 --> 01:28:26,146
I do want to perform this song.

1971
01:28:26,147 --> 01:28:28,107
- This song? - I want to finish this performance.

1972
01:28:30,347 --> 01:28:31,617
Of all teams,

1973
01:28:32,817 --> 01:28:36,357
our team feels the saddest and most disappointed.

1974
01:28:36,457 --> 01:28:37,787
But we're happy at the same time.

1975
01:28:38,287 --> 01:28:39,627
I love my team.

1976
01:28:40,097 --> 01:28:42,867
I think Team "MAIN DISH" is the best team there is.

1977
01:28:43,427 --> 01:28:46,187
I really hope all of us can survive and do this performance together.

1978
01:28:46,837 --> 01:28:49,267
But it's highly likely that won't be the case.

1979
01:28:50,237 --> 01:28:52,507
But we'll do our best until the end.

1980
01:28:52,977 --> 01:28:55,053
If we don't give in and keep working hard instead...

1981
01:28:55,077 --> 01:28:57,677
Honestly, we don't know when we'll get a chance like this again.

1982
01:28:58,647 --> 01:29:01,577
I hope at least six of us remain to perform this song.

1983
01:29:02,917 --> 01:29:06,017
(They become more desperate for their survival.)

1984
01:29:09,457 --> 01:29:12,057
(1 day before the 2nd Survivor Announcement)

1985
01:29:12,657 --> 01:29:14,227
Hey, you!

1986
01:29:14,327 --> 01:29:16,096
Han Harry June!

1987
01:29:16,097 --> 01:29:17,227
In Hu!

1988
01:29:18,067 --> 01:29:21,396
Fan Zhe Yi! I believe that you can do better!

1989
01:29:21,397 --> 01:29:23,506
You've been working hard until now.

1990
01:29:23,507 --> 01:29:25,337
I don't want to be eliminated.

1991
01:29:25,637 --> 01:29:27,406
I want to see through the performance...

1992
01:29:27,407 --> 01:29:28,877
I've been practicing!

1993
01:29:29,177 --> 01:29:33,217
I want to dance again in front of the Star Creators.

1994
01:29:33,317 --> 01:29:34,976
(Let's go, Tatsuki!)

1995
01:29:34,977 --> 01:29:39,187
I'll make it so that this year becomes my last training year.

1996
01:29:39,287 --> 01:29:41,386
I don't want to lose this opportunity.

1997
01:29:41,387 --> 01:29:43,427
I'll put on a perfect performance.

1998
01:29:44,287 --> 01:29:47,497
Yoon Min, you're on this show, so there are no regrets.

1999
01:29:47,957 --> 01:29:49,467
I did my best for the performance.

2000
01:29:50,197 --> 01:29:52,397
After surviving once, I want to stay on.

2001
01:29:52,697 --> 01:29:57,037
I want to survive this round again, so I can nail this performance.

2002
01:29:57,867 --> 01:30:01,977
I'd like to perform as many times as possible before getting eliminated.

2003
01:30:04,277 --> 01:30:06,246
This chance to perform on stage is so valuable.

2004
01:30:06,247 --> 01:30:07,717
I'm desperate for it too.

2005
01:30:08,647 --> 01:30:10,847
I want to show my talent on stage even a second longer.

2006
01:30:21,157 --> 01:30:22,467
Please help me debut!

2007
01:30:24,867 --> 01:30:26,767
I'm going to make a debut through this show!

2008
01:30:31,937 --> 01:30:32,937
Please.

2009
01:30:34,237 --> 01:30:35,907
Give me one more chance.

2010
01:30:38,407 --> 01:30:42,746
We will now begin the Second Survivor Announcement...

2011
01:30:42,747 --> 01:30:46,057
that was decided solely based on the votes of the Star Creators.

2012
01:30:46,157 --> 01:30:48,056
- Okay. - Okay. Let's go.

2013
01:30:48,057 --> 01:30:49,137
- Good luck. - We got this.

2014
01:30:49,427 --> 01:30:50,427
We can do this.

2015
01:30:51,997 --> 01:30:53,056
Please let me advance.

2016
01:30:53,057 --> 01:30:55,397
(2nd Survivor Announcement)

2017
01:30:55,697 --> 01:30:57,667
Please.

2018
01:30:58,227 --> 01:31:01,036
The Second Survivor Announcement will name the survivors...

2019
01:31:01,037 --> 01:31:02,437
from each position.

2020
01:31:02,967 --> 01:31:05,536
Once the survivors from the three positions are named,

2021
01:31:05,537 --> 01:31:08,137
the 9 candidates for the Top 8, the participant in 23rd place,

2022
01:31:08,337 --> 01:31:12,416
and the last survivor in 24th place will be revealed.

2023
01:31:12,417 --> 01:31:13,946
I will now reveal the first position...

2024
01:31:13,947 --> 01:31:15,907
whose the first group of survivors will be named.

2025
01:31:17,017 --> 01:31:18,137
I bet it's the rap position.

2026
01:31:18,717 --> 01:31:20,086
This has to be the vocal position.

2027
01:31:20,087 --> 01:31:22,207
- Let it be the dance position. - The dance position?

2028
01:31:22,587 --> 01:31:23,987
If I go last again,

2029
01:31:24,757 --> 01:31:26,897
- there might not be a spot for me. - Right.

2030
01:31:27,257 --> 01:31:29,697
The first group of survivors will come from...

2031
01:31:34,167 --> 01:31:35,967
the vocal position.

2032
01:31:37,267 --> 01:31:39,807
- Let's go. - I had a feeling.

2033
01:31:40,807 --> 01:31:43,147
(Survivor Announcement, Vocal)

2034
01:31:43,547 --> 01:31:46,047
I'm curious about Jun Il's ranking in this group.

2035
01:31:46,577 --> 01:31:48,217
I bet his ranking climbed a lot.

2036
01:31:48,917 --> 01:31:50,747
I bet Jae Hyun's ranking went up too.

2037
01:31:51,487 --> 01:31:53,086
- Tae Jo's ranking went up too. - Right.

2038
01:31:53,087 --> 01:31:54,417
(Complimenting himself)

2039
01:31:54,587 --> 01:31:55,927
They must be so nervous.

2040
01:31:56,627 --> 01:31:58,757
The participants in the vocal position...

2041
01:31:59,897 --> 01:32:01,496
(They arranged the song with their own interpretation.)

2042
01:32:01,497 --> 01:32:03,497
arranged the song with their own interpretation...

2043
01:32:04,667 --> 01:32:06,766
and breathed a new charm into the song.

2044
01:32:06,767 --> 01:32:09,567
(The 4 teams from the vocal position brought a new charm to the song.)

2045
01:32:11,107 --> 01:32:14,477
(The participants who took over the class won 200,000 points.)

2046
01:32:14,637 --> 01:32:18,107
Based on the evaluations, Team "Rose Blossom" was chosen...

2047
01:32:18,307 --> 01:32:21,717
as the top team in their position and received the benefit.

2048
01:32:25,417 --> 01:32:27,886
Sixteen participants performed on stage...

2049
01:32:27,887 --> 01:32:29,487
as vocalists.

2050
01:32:29,587 --> 01:32:31,757
How many of them will take the seats as survivors?

2051
01:32:31,957 --> 01:32:34,957
And which team will produce the most survivors?

2052
01:32:35,357 --> 01:32:36,997
I'll reveal the results now.

2053
01:32:39,397 --> 01:32:41,413
There aren't a lot of spots left for the middle group.

2054
01:32:41,437 --> 01:32:42,437
Right.

2055
01:32:42,737 --> 01:32:45,307
Except for the places in 23rd, 24th, and 9th...

2056
01:32:45,407 --> 01:32:46,737
and the Top Eight,

2057
01:32:47,677 --> 01:32:49,647
only 13 participants can be named.

2058
01:32:49,947 --> 01:32:51,346
There aren't a lot of chairs left.

2059
01:32:51,347 --> 01:32:52,623
(Only 13 places can be announced now.)

2060
01:32:52,647 --> 01:32:53,846
If a lot of them are called now,

2061
01:32:53,847 --> 01:32:55,367
there won't be many seats left for us.

2062
01:32:55,717 --> 01:32:56,717
Right.

2063
01:32:56,917 --> 01:32:58,747
The Top Eight won't be called now.

2064
01:32:58,857 --> 01:33:00,687
So many of them could be in the Top Eight.

2065
01:33:01,017 --> 01:33:02,287
There are five of them.

2066
01:33:02,387 --> 01:33:04,427
Five of them are from the Top Eight?

2067
01:33:05,157 --> 01:33:07,126
The participants who were in the Top Eight previously...

2068
01:33:07,127 --> 01:33:09,267
might not want to be called now.

2069
01:33:09,367 --> 01:33:11,367
That's a different kind of nervousness.

2070
01:33:11,627 --> 01:33:13,097
I'd like to feel that too.

2071
01:33:14,397 --> 01:33:16,206
The first survivor to take a seat...

2072
01:33:16,207 --> 01:33:18,467
at the Second Survivor Announcement...

2073
01:33:18,937 --> 01:33:21,937
received the highest score in the vocal position.

2074
01:33:22,807 --> 01:33:23,967
I wonder what the ranking is.

2075
01:33:25,177 --> 01:33:26,616
This participant is in tenth place.

2076
01:33:26,617 --> 01:33:27,776
(Surprised)

2077
01:33:27,777 --> 01:33:28,777
(Oh, my!)

2078
01:33:28,778 --> 01:33:29,786
That's what he's starting with?

2079
01:33:29,787 --> 01:33:31,216
He'll start with tenth place right away?

2080
01:33:31,217 --> 01:33:33,257
(Survivor in 10th place)

2081
01:33:33,357 --> 01:33:35,557
- That's quite high. - We're starting with a high rank.

2082
01:33:36,527 --> 01:33:37,627
I wonder who it is.

2083
01:33:38,427 --> 01:33:40,997
Coming in at 10th place, as for the 1st survivor,

2084
01:33:41,657 --> 01:33:44,967
Participant Jun Lee Jeong...

2085
01:33:48,737 --> 01:33:50,667
Participant Jun Lee Jeong is over there.

2086
01:33:50,737 --> 01:33:52,307
I bet they were on the same team.

2087
01:33:53,437 --> 01:33:54,637
And this participant...

2088
01:33:56,277 --> 01:33:57,577
They never shared a room.

2089
01:33:58,207 --> 01:34:01,117
- have been... - Have they been roommates?

2090
01:34:02,647 --> 01:34:04,247
Roommates.

2091
01:34:05,657 --> 01:34:06,916
Who is it then?

2092
01:34:06,917 --> 01:34:08,357
Team "Plot Twist."

2093
01:34:08,557 --> 01:34:10,087
It's Li Yu.

2094
01:34:10,587 --> 01:34:12,196
There's Woo Jin too.

2095
01:34:12,197 --> 01:34:15,356
We were all roommates.

2096
01:34:15,357 --> 01:34:16,467
Right.

2097
01:34:16,897 --> 01:34:19,067
(While practicing for "Plot Twist" as Team 2)

2098
01:34:19,397 --> 01:34:21,797
(Jun Lee Jeong's room was quite crowded.)

2099
01:34:23,867 --> 01:34:26,077
(Here are his roommates from before.)

2100
01:34:26,437 --> 01:34:27,806
Woo Jin, Han Eum,

2101
01:34:27,807 --> 01:34:29,607
Sang Hyeon, and Li Yu.

2102
01:34:30,607 --> 01:34:32,247
How did he end up with so many roommates?

2103
01:34:33,417 --> 01:34:34,447
I loved you guys.

2104
01:34:35,547 --> 01:34:36,547
And...

2105
01:34:36,947 --> 01:34:38,116
(There's more?)

2106
01:34:38,117 --> 01:34:40,557
He's quite tall as his height is over 180cm.

2107
01:34:40,957 --> 01:34:42,427
Is it Han Eum?

2108
01:34:42,527 --> 01:34:43,726
It's Woo Jin.

2109
01:34:43,727 --> 01:34:45,486
(They naturally look up.)

2110
01:34:45,487 --> 01:34:47,227
It's either Han Eum or Woo Jin.

2111
01:34:47,427 --> 01:34:49,196
It's between Woo Jin and Han Eum.

2112
01:34:49,197 --> 01:34:50,773
(The tall participants of the show, Kang Woo Jin and Jang Han Eum)

2113
01:34:50,797 --> 01:34:52,197
No, Li Yu too.

2114
01:34:52,797 --> 01:34:54,096
- Li Yu... - Is he taller than 180cm?

2115
01:34:54,097 --> 01:34:56,407
- He's 181cm tall. - Right, Li Yu is over 180cm too.

2116
01:34:56,507 --> 01:34:57,736
(Surprisingly, Chuei Li Yu is quite tall too.)

2117
01:34:57,737 --> 01:34:58,867
(Chuei Li Yu, 180cm tall)

2118
01:35:00,337 --> 01:35:01,337
This is sad.

2119
01:35:01,338 --> 01:35:02,647
(Yoo Kang Min, 174cm tall)

2120
01:35:03,147 --> 01:35:05,406
I will now announce the survivor in tenth place,

2121
01:35:05,407 --> 01:35:07,477
the first participant to take the chair.

2122
01:35:08,117 --> 01:35:11,247
My gosh, that's a high rank. I'm so envious.

2123
01:35:12,047 --> 01:35:13,957
The survivor in tenth place is...

2124
01:35:14,357 --> 01:35:16,027
I'm calling it. It's Woo Jin.

2125
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:18,256
(10th place, Kang Woo Jin, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2126
01:35:18,257 --> 01:35:19,257
Is it Han Eum?

2127
01:35:19,258 --> 01:35:20,633
(12th place, Jang Han Eum, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2128
01:35:20,657 --> 01:35:23,726
It might be Han Eum. Han Eum got the benefit.

2129
01:35:23,727 --> 01:35:24,727
Right.

2130
01:35:24,728 --> 01:35:26,837
(Survivor in 10th place)

2131
01:35:26,897 --> 01:35:29,937
(Who's the survivor in 10th place?)

2132
01:35:31,237 --> 01:35:33,506
It's Chuei Li Yu.

2133
01:35:33,507 --> 01:35:35,876
(Chuei Li Yu survives in 10th place.)

2134
01:35:35,877 --> 01:35:38,276
(As usual, he doesn't know how to react.)

2135
01:35:38,277 --> 01:35:39,517
It's Li Yu?

2136
01:35:42,487 --> 01:35:44,217
- His ranking dropped a lot. - It's Li Yu?

2137
01:35:45,717 --> 01:35:48,916
From the 1st Survivor Announcement, his ranking dropped by 4 places.

2138
01:35:48,917 --> 01:35:50,786
But Participant Chuei Li Yu still secured a spot on the show...

2139
01:35:50,787 --> 01:35:52,257
with a high rank.

2140
01:35:52,357 --> 01:35:53,956
Congratulations on making it through.

2141
01:35:53,957 --> 01:35:55,326
(Chuei Li Yu, 10th place, 4,764,725 points)

2142
01:35:55,327 --> 01:35:57,727
But tenth place is still very high.

2143
01:35:58,527 --> 01:35:59,537
I'm envious.

2144
01:36:00,637 --> 01:36:03,807
I'm telling myself... I mean, this is a bummer.

2145
01:36:05,567 --> 01:36:07,507
But I'll keep working hard.

2146
01:36:07,607 --> 01:36:12,007
I'll do my best to make it back to my initial spot.

2147
01:36:17,717 --> 01:36:20,657
The rank of the next survivor to take the chair...

2148
01:36:21,117 --> 01:36:23,827
- Eleventh place? - What? Already?

2149
01:36:24,157 --> 01:36:26,397
I think 11th and 12th places might come from this group.

2150
01:36:26,827 --> 01:36:28,697
- It's 13th place. - Did he say 13th?

2151
01:36:28,957 --> 01:36:30,197
It's 13th place?

2152
01:36:32,337 --> 01:36:34,597
(Survivor in 13th place)

2153
01:36:34,967 --> 01:36:36,687
I guess a lot of our rankings have shifted.

2154
01:36:36,867 --> 01:36:38,387
I get the feeling that it might be me.

2155
01:36:39,107 --> 01:36:40,507
- Woo Jin? - I'm scared.

2156
01:36:40,837 --> 01:36:41,877
Or Han Eum?

2157
01:36:42,647 --> 01:36:44,977
No, the next one will be Han Eum for sure.

2158
01:36:45,447 --> 01:36:46,947
He got 250,000 extra points.

2159
01:36:48,217 --> 01:36:49,687
The participant in 13th place...

2160
01:36:49,787 --> 01:36:53,817
has never held this rank before on BOYS II PLANET.

2161
01:36:54,557 --> 01:36:56,433
So it can't be someone who's been in 13th place.

2162
01:36:56,457 --> 01:36:58,587
Who held 13th place in the 1st announcement?

2163
01:36:59,527 --> 01:37:01,626
(Fan Zhe Yi held 13th place in the 1st Survivor Announcement.)

2164
01:37:01,627 --> 01:37:03,987
(13th place, Fan Zhe Yi, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2165
01:37:04,167 --> 01:37:06,297
It could be good news or bad news.

2166
01:37:08,297 --> 01:37:09,367
Is it me?

2167
01:37:10,867 --> 01:37:12,236
Gosh, I doubt it's you.

2168
01:37:12,237 --> 01:37:14,197
I was a bit shocked after seeing Li Yu's ranking.

2169
01:37:15,947 --> 01:37:18,247
I will reveal the participant in 13th place.

2170
01:37:22,017 --> 01:37:23,446
(10th place, Kang Woo Jin, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2171
01:37:23,447 --> 01:37:24,687
Seriously, this...

2172
01:37:25,917 --> 01:37:28,117
How many times do I have to do this so I'm not nervous?

2173
01:37:28,457 --> 01:37:30,087
I think it's me.

2174
01:37:30,827 --> 01:37:32,527
It wouldn't make sense if it's Kang Min.

2175
01:37:33,197 --> 01:37:36,096
Han Eum, Woo Jin, or Heng Yu. It's 1 of the 3.

2176
01:37:36,097 --> 01:37:37,873
(12th Jang Han Eum, 10th Kang Woo Jin, 11th Sun Heng Yu)

2177
01:37:37,897 --> 01:37:40,066
It could be anyone. It wouldn't be strange.

2178
01:37:40,067 --> 01:37:41,187
(Vocal Survivor, 13th place)

2179
01:37:41,997 --> 01:37:43,066
I'll announce right away.

2180
01:37:43,067 --> 01:37:44,706
(26th place, Sen, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2181
01:37:44,707 --> 01:37:47,107
(35th place, Park Jun Il, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2182
01:37:47,177 --> 01:37:48,237
It's...

2183
01:37:48,677 --> 01:37:50,146
(10th place, Kang Woo Jin, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2184
01:37:50,147 --> 01:37:52,153
(12th place, Jang Han Eum, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2185
01:37:52,177 --> 01:37:53,976
Park Jun Il.

2186
01:37:53,977 --> 01:37:55,847
(Park Jun Il survives in 13th place.)

2187
01:37:58,147 --> 01:37:59,956
- Really? - Park Jun Il.

2188
01:37:59,957 --> 01:38:01,286
(Park Jun Il, 13th place, 4,013,108 points)

2189
01:38:01,287 --> 01:38:03,126
(Korea vote count: 449,730)

2190
01:38:03,127 --> 01:38:04,127
(Jun Il's ranking went up as many as 22.)

2191
01:38:04,128 --> 01:38:05,927
Hey.

2192
01:38:06,127 --> 01:38:07,447
- Congratulations. - It's Jun Il?

2193
01:38:12,837 --> 01:38:14,697
How many ranks did he go up?

2194
01:38:14,837 --> 01:38:16,136
He was in 38th place last time.

2195
01:38:16,137 --> 01:38:17,467
(He was in 35th place.)

2196
01:38:18,437 --> 01:38:20,537
- Thirteenth? - Hey.

2197
01:38:20,877 --> 01:38:24,147
(He performed Team 1's killing part for "Rising Sun")

2198
01:38:24,347 --> 01:38:25,446
Park Jun Il.

2199
01:38:25,447 --> 01:38:32,187
(Park Jun Il survived in 35th place in the 1st Survivor Announcement.)

2200
01:38:32,587 --> 01:38:35,417
(He faced a crisis in the Class Switch Position Battle...)

2201
01:38:35,457 --> 01:38:38,086
(but proved his existence through a successful performance.)

2202
01:38:38,087 --> 01:38:41,727
(He received the benefit points with tears of joy.)

2203
01:38:43,627 --> 01:38:45,067
This is real victory.

2204
01:38:46,197 --> 01:38:47,637
Congratulations, Jun Il.

2205
01:38:48,097 --> 01:38:52,166
Park Jun Il survived in 35th place in the 1st Survivor Announcement.

2206
01:38:52,167 --> 01:38:54,936
He went up 22 ranks...

2207
01:38:54,937 --> 01:38:56,846
and now stands close to debut.

2208
01:38:56,847 --> 01:38:58,176
Congratulations on your survival.

2209
01:38:58,177 --> 01:38:59,423
(Park Jun Il, 13th place, 4,013,108 points)

2210
01:38:59,447 --> 01:39:01,077
The ranks totally changed.

2211
01:39:02,847 --> 01:39:04,987
Actually, when I received the previous ranking,

2212
01:39:06,117 --> 01:39:09,857
I thought that was the furthest I would go.

2213
01:39:10,427 --> 01:39:13,057
I will try my best...

2214
01:39:13,597 --> 01:39:16,966
to go even higher.

2215
01:39:16,967 --> 01:39:18,027
Thank you so much.

2216
01:39:20,667 --> 01:39:21,767
That's cool.

2217
01:39:23,067 --> 01:39:25,166
We kept having survivors...

2218
01:39:25,167 --> 01:39:27,177
from Team "Rose Blossom."

2219
01:39:28,837 --> 01:39:30,547
Now it's the 14th.

2220
01:39:31,207 --> 01:39:34,277
The ranking of the next survivor...

2221
01:39:35,917 --> 01:39:37,547
is the 14th.

2222
01:39:37,947 --> 01:39:39,116
(Survivor in 14th place)

2223
01:39:39,117 --> 01:39:40,157
Right away.

2224
01:39:40,257 --> 01:39:41,657
- It's going in order. - Right.

2225
01:39:42,757 --> 01:39:45,457
The places are being filled.

2226
01:39:47,227 --> 01:39:49,367
The rankings are all high.

2227
01:39:49,867 --> 01:39:51,367
It's really not easy.

2228
01:39:52,097 --> 01:39:54,636
My predicted ranking was the 14th.

2229
01:39:54,637 --> 01:39:55,667
In my opinion.

2230
01:39:56,307 --> 01:39:57,667
I think that could be me.

2231
01:39:58,837 --> 01:40:00,537
The participant in 14th place...

2232
01:40:01,377 --> 01:40:04,277
had a solo performance on BOYS II PLANET.

2233
01:40:05,977 --> 01:40:07,047
Heng Yu.

2234
01:40:07,417 --> 01:40:09,177
Woo Jin, Han Eum.

2235
01:40:09,547 --> 01:40:12,916
(Sun Heng Yu, Kang Woo Jin, and Jang Han Eum...)

2236
01:40:12,917 --> 01:40:16,287
(had solo performances.)

2237
01:40:16,787 --> 01:40:18,907
Heng Yu, Woo Jin, and Han Eum keep getting mentioned.

2238
01:40:18,957 --> 01:40:20,917
And the part the participant wanted to improve...

2239
01:40:21,027 --> 01:40:23,127
written on the Alpha Introduction...

2240
01:40:26,397 --> 01:40:28,537
was dancing.

2241
01:40:28,867 --> 01:40:30,066
- What did you write? - Both of them.

2242
01:40:30,067 --> 01:40:31,343
- I wrote dancing. - I wrote dancing.

2243
01:40:31,367 --> 01:40:34,276
- What did you write? - I was the main dancer.

2244
01:40:34,277 --> 01:40:37,207
(Sun Heng Yu, the main dancer of BLANK2Y)

2245
01:40:37,347 --> 01:40:39,717
- That's right. I'm sorry. - I was in the dance position.

2246
01:40:40,217 --> 01:40:42,177
- I'm sorry. - I wasn't in the vocal position.

2247
01:40:42,547 --> 01:40:43,547
I was in the dance position.

2248
01:40:43,548 --> 01:40:45,286
It's either you or me.

2249
01:40:45,287 --> 01:40:47,047
(Kang Woo Jin quickly returns to his place.)

2250
01:40:47,087 --> 01:40:48,857
The participant who will survive...

2251
01:40:49,487 --> 01:40:51,856
(Who will be the survivor in 14th place?)

2252
01:40:51,857 --> 01:40:54,057
(Survivor in 14th place)

2253
01:40:55,697 --> 01:40:56,796
is Jang Han Eum.

2254
01:40:56,797 --> 01:40:59,296
(Jang Han Eum survives in 14th place.)

2255
01:40:59,297 --> 01:41:02,137
- Well done. - Yes, Han Eum.

2256
01:41:02,667 --> 01:41:03,667
Congratulations.

2257
01:41:04,107 --> 01:41:05,637
The rankings changed so much.

2258
01:41:06,207 --> 01:41:08,177
Three members from "Rose Blossom" survived.

2259
01:41:09,177 --> 01:41:10,347
The places are running out.

2260
01:41:12,277 --> 01:41:13,676
Congratulations on surviving.

2261
01:41:13,677 --> 01:41:16,246
(Jang Han Eum, 14th place, 3,991,799 points)

2262
01:41:16,247 --> 01:41:17,347
I envy him.

2263
01:41:19,957 --> 01:41:22,586
I really thank the Star Creators...

2264
01:41:22,587 --> 01:41:25,927
who support me when I'm lacking in many ways.

2265
01:41:26,527 --> 01:41:28,826
I'll put even more effort from now on.

2266
01:41:28,827 --> 01:41:29,827
Thank you.

2267
01:41:34,697 --> 01:41:37,567
You may move to the seat of your ranking.

2268
01:41:40,107 --> 01:41:41,337
He became 13th from 35th.

2269
01:41:41,837 --> 01:41:44,247
- It's amazing. - He became a human.

2270
01:41:45,047 --> 01:41:46,117
Good for him.

2271
01:41:47,247 --> 01:41:50,317
I'll announce the participant who will survive next.

2272
01:41:51,947 --> 01:41:53,657
It's the participant in 15th place.

2273
01:41:54,517 --> 01:41:55,556
Right away?

2274
01:41:55,557 --> 01:41:57,957
(Survivor in 15th place)

2275
01:41:58,187 --> 01:41:59,727
They took all of those.

2276
01:42:00,097 --> 01:42:01,557
They're all on that line.

2277
01:42:02,997 --> 01:42:04,957
So many vocalist participants are getting called.

2278
01:42:05,727 --> 01:42:06,736
There wouldn't be many seats left.

2279
01:42:06,737 --> 01:42:08,297
Right. There must be a lot of pressure.

2280
01:42:10,067 --> 01:42:12,166
The rank of the participant in 15th place...

2281
01:42:12,167 --> 01:42:13,207
is declining.

2282
01:42:13,807 --> 01:42:14,906
It's Woo Jin.

2283
01:42:14,907 --> 01:42:16,646
It's either Woo Jin or Heng Yu.

2284
01:42:16,647 --> 01:42:18,453
(10th place, Kang Woo Jin 11th place, Sun Heng Yu)

2285
01:42:18,477 --> 01:42:19,576
Or Kang Min?

2286
01:42:19,577 --> 01:42:21,623
(7th place, Yoo Kang Min, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2287
01:42:21,647 --> 01:42:22,917
I'll announce it right away.

2288
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:24,586
(10th place, Kang Woo Jin, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2289
01:42:24,587 --> 01:42:25,786
I think it's going to be me.

2290
01:42:25,787 --> 01:42:26,856
(10th, Kang Woo Jin, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2291
01:42:26,857 --> 01:42:28,963
(11th, Sun Heng Yu, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2292
01:42:28,987 --> 01:42:30,357
I'm getting nervous.

2293
01:42:33,057 --> 01:42:34,227
It's Sun Heng Yu.

2294
01:42:35,757 --> 01:42:41,437
(Sun Heng Yu survives in 15th place.)

2295
01:42:42,097 --> 01:42:44,367
Woo Jin would be there.

2296
01:42:46,107 --> 01:42:47,636
His ranking declined a little,

2297
01:42:47,637 --> 01:42:50,147
but Sun Heng Yu showed us another side of him.

2298
01:42:50,507 --> 01:42:51,707
Congratulations on surviving.

2299
01:42:53,177 --> 01:42:54,177
Congratulations.

2300
01:42:54,917 --> 01:42:58,717
I feel relieved by the fact that I survived,

2301
01:42:59,517 --> 01:43:00,617
but I also think...

2302
01:43:01,717 --> 01:43:03,527
it's a really heartbreaking place to be.

2303
01:43:04,127 --> 01:43:06,657
I'm reminded of Yoon Min, who led me,

2304
01:43:06,757 --> 01:43:10,067
and Lee Dong Hyun during "Rising Sun."

2305
01:43:10,427 --> 01:43:13,097
I get to think...

2306
01:43:13,267 --> 01:43:15,237
I'm learning so many good things from here.

2307
01:43:15,497 --> 01:43:17,667
I want to thank them,

2308
01:43:18,667 --> 01:43:20,877
and thank you for letting me survive.

2309
01:43:26,217 --> 01:43:29,417
I'll announce the next survivor.

2310
01:43:30,587 --> 01:43:31,617
The 16th place.

2311
01:43:31,747 --> 01:43:33,317
It's the participant in 16th place.

2312
01:43:33,717 --> 01:43:35,557
- What's going on? - What's going on?

2313
01:43:36,957 --> 01:43:39,156
There's more? Goodness.

2314
01:43:39,157 --> 01:43:40,427
(Survivor in 16th place)

2315
01:43:40,497 --> 01:43:41,656
(The vocalist participants have been surviving in a row.)

2316
01:43:41,657 --> 01:43:43,417
They keep going in. There are no seats left.

2317
01:43:44,597 --> 01:43:45,627
We're in trouble.

2318
01:43:47,397 --> 01:43:49,037
The participant in 16th place...

2319
01:43:50,167 --> 01:43:52,506
performed SEVENTEEN's song...

2320
01:43:52,507 --> 01:43:53,707
on the last mission.

2321
01:43:54,037 --> 01:43:55,336
(The candidate is in Team "Run to You.")

2322
01:43:55,337 --> 01:43:56,547
Woo Jin.

2323
01:43:57,647 --> 01:43:59,247
- I think it's Sen. - Sen?

2324
01:43:59,577 --> 01:44:01,417
(26th, Sen, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2325
01:44:01,617 --> 01:44:02,987
I think it's going to be Woo Jin.

2326
01:44:03,447 --> 01:44:05,787
Woo Jin could be somewhere higher.

2327
01:44:07,017 --> 01:44:08,956
The participant in 16th place...

2328
01:44:08,957 --> 01:44:11,057
voted by the Star Creators all over the world is...

2329
01:44:12,187 --> 01:44:14,296
(26th place, Sen, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2330
01:44:14,297 --> 01:44:16,026
(48th place, Yoon Min, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2331
01:44:16,027 --> 01:44:18,203
(10th place, Kang Woo Jin, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2332
01:44:18,227 --> 01:44:20,497
From Team "Run to You."

2333
01:44:24,137 --> 01:44:25,237
It's Kang Woo Jin.

2334
01:44:26,337 --> 01:44:28,376
(Kang Woo Jin survives in 16th place.)

2335
01:44:28,377 --> 01:44:29,477
Well done.

2336
01:44:30,207 --> 01:44:31,307
What was Woo Jin's ranking?

2337
01:44:32,507 --> 01:44:33,547
He was in tenth place.

2338
01:44:34,817 --> 01:44:36,216
His ranking dropped a lot.

2339
01:44:36,217 --> 01:44:37,687
Right. His ranking dropped.

2340
01:44:39,217 --> 01:44:40,956
(Kang Woo Jin survived in 10th place...)

2341
01:44:40,957 --> 01:44:42,717
(at the 1st Survivor Announcement.)

2342
01:44:44,257 --> 01:44:47,527
(Despite his performance in "Run to You...")

2343
01:44:47,927 --> 01:44:49,926
("Run to You" by SEVENTEEN, Kang Woo Jin: 860 points)

2344
01:44:49,927 --> 01:44:54,797
(Kang Woo Jin failed to get the benefit points.)

2345
01:44:56,437 --> 01:44:57,836
Congratulations on surviving.

2346
01:44:57,837 --> 01:45:00,007
(Kang Woo Jin, 16th place, 3,121,531 points)

2347
01:45:00,237 --> 01:45:01,277
I guess he's disappointed.

2348
01:45:02,607 --> 01:45:03,807
His ranking dropped.

2349
01:45:06,217 --> 01:45:07,777
Actually...

2350
01:45:12,047 --> 01:45:13,057
I...

2351
01:45:16,657 --> 01:45:17,727
Why is he about to cry?

2352
01:45:18,587 --> 01:45:20,297
I kept...

2353
01:45:26,597 --> 01:45:30,067
My ranking kept dropping,

2354
01:45:31,107 --> 01:45:35,077
but I'll think of the Star Creators who support me...

2355
01:45:35,207 --> 01:45:39,106
and do my best so my ranking will go up.

2356
01:45:39,107 --> 01:45:40,117
Thank you.

2357
01:45:47,587 --> 01:45:49,827
The next survivor in the vocalist position...

2358
01:45:51,527 --> 01:45:52,587
I'm nervous.

2359
01:45:55,327 --> 01:45:57,796
There must be one, for sure.

2360
01:45:57,797 --> 01:45:59,443
(40th place, Jo Gye Hyeon, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2361
01:45:59,467 --> 01:46:01,637
Sen would go up.

2362
01:46:02,837 --> 01:46:03,837
The 20th?

2363
01:46:04,367 --> 01:46:05,607
Would it be the 17th?

2364
01:46:06,007 --> 01:46:09,406
(30th place, Dang Hong Hai, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2365
01:46:09,407 --> 01:46:11,807
(43rd place, Kim Si Hwan, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2366
01:46:13,017 --> 01:46:14,747
There are none.

2367
01:46:16,117 --> 01:46:17,147
There are none.

2368
01:46:22,057 --> 01:46:23,626
(There are no more survivors from the vocalist position.)

2369
01:46:23,627 --> 01:46:25,786
(48th place, Yoon Min, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2370
01:46:25,787 --> 01:46:28,397
(37th place, Kim Dong Yun, 1st Survivor, Announcement Ranking)

2371
01:46:28,997 --> 01:46:31,067
Even if your name wasn't mentioned now,

2372
01:46:31,927 --> 01:46:35,737
you may be a candidate for the Top 8 or the 23rd place.

2373
01:46:36,467 --> 01:46:39,537
So please wait for the results until the end.

2374
01:46:41,677 --> 01:46:43,307
Is this real?

2375
01:46:44,077 --> 01:46:47,247
(The participants in the vocalist position return to their seats.)

2376
01:46:54,217 --> 01:46:58,927
(Will there be additional survivors from the vocalist position?)

2377
01:46:59,257 --> 01:47:02,357
The Second Survivor Announcement of BOYS II PLANET.

2378
01:47:04,497 --> 01:47:06,467
Before I announce...

2379
01:47:07,067 --> 01:47:08,397
the next positions...

2380
01:47:11,507 --> 01:47:14,336
Something very strange and bizarre happened in Planet Camp...

2381
01:47:14,337 --> 01:47:17,346
without your knowledge.

2382
01:47:17,347 --> 01:47:18,747
Strange and bizarre?

2383
01:47:18,807 --> 01:47:19,877
Did something happen?

2384
01:47:20,147 --> 01:47:22,416
Let's watch the clip together...

2385
01:47:22,417 --> 01:47:24,517
to find out what happened.

2386
01:47:24,587 --> 01:47:25,786
(Anticipating)

2387
01:47:25,787 --> 01:47:27,387
- We'll watch a clip. - One, two, three.

2388
01:47:28,217 --> 01:47:29,287
What is it?

2389
01:47:31,587 --> 01:47:32,787
- Chun Bae? - It's Chun Bae.

2390
01:47:32,827 --> 01:47:34,103
(Thanks to Planet Guard Chun Bae who's working hard as usual, )

2391
01:47:34,127 --> 01:47:36,056
(it's a peaceful day at the Planet Camp.)

2392
01:47:36,057 --> 01:47:37,197
Please go inside.

2393
01:47:37,467 --> 01:47:39,396
- What's going on? - Hu Han Wen?

2394
01:47:39,397 --> 01:47:40,917
(Hu Han Wen carefully enters a place.)

2395
01:47:42,167 --> 01:47:43,237
What?

2396
01:47:44,867 --> 01:47:46,036
(The setup of today's shoot looks quite different.)

2397
01:47:46,037 --> 01:47:47,207
- What? - What's going on?

2398
01:47:47,377 --> 01:47:48,577
What did we do?

2399
01:47:49,337 --> 01:47:50,507
Did we do something?

2400
01:47:50,777 --> 01:47:52,777
(The participants entering after him...)

2401
01:47:54,617 --> 01:47:57,547
(are also puzzled by what's happening.)

2402
01:47:57,787 --> 01:47:59,217
What do you think people do here?

2403
01:48:00,017 --> 01:48:01,017
(Chuckling)

2404
01:48:01,018 --> 01:48:02,087
Product placement ads?

2405
01:48:02,887 --> 01:48:06,356
Lee Sang Won and Zhou An Xin...

2406
01:48:06,357 --> 01:48:07,626
Hu Han Wen...

2407
01:48:07,627 --> 01:48:09,456
Kim Geon Woo and Yoo Kang Min...

2408
01:48:09,457 --> 01:48:12,666
You guys have earned a chance to model...

2409
01:48:12,667 --> 01:48:15,297
for a Korean beauty and health store.

2410
01:48:16,167 --> 01:48:17,167
What?

2411
01:48:17,637 --> 01:48:18,667
- What? - I see.

2412
01:48:20,207 --> 01:48:21,236
Really?

2413
01:48:21,237 --> 01:48:23,377
I took it seriously and did my best.

2414
01:48:23,577 --> 01:48:25,907
(Use the new products...)

2415
01:48:26,547 --> 01:48:29,077
(to showcase your talent to become an advertising model.)

2416
01:48:29,517 --> 01:48:31,863
(The 3 participants chosen by the support of the Star Creators...)

2417
01:48:31,887 --> 01:48:34,587
(will receive a chance to be advertising models!)

2418
01:48:35,187 --> 01:48:36,756
Nice to meet you. I'm the director for the commercial.

2419
01:48:36,757 --> 01:48:38,287
- Hello. - Hello.

2420
01:48:38,427 --> 01:48:40,157
Gosh, that was legendary.

2421
01:48:40,357 --> 01:48:41,827
I remember that. Seriously.

2422
01:48:42,357 --> 01:48:43,866
You must be nervous.

2423
01:48:43,867 --> 01:48:45,567
- You can just relax. - Okay.

2424
01:48:46,467 --> 01:48:47,837
You can make a cute face, right?

2425
01:48:48,797 --> 01:48:49,907
He's a manly guy.

2426
01:48:50,607 --> 01:48:52,407
(I'm the manly guy, Kim Jae Hyun.)

2427
01:48:52,807 --> 01:48:54,807
Jae Hyun can't do it because he's so manly.

2428
01:48:55,207 --> 01:48:58,507
(His reputation as a manly guy versus a chance to be in an ad)

2429
01:48:59,247 --> 01:49:00,917
You can hydrate your skin with it.

2430
01:49:01,317 --> 01:49:02,716
It's great for soothing your skin.

2431
01:49:02,717 --> 01:49:04,557
(I'll be a gentle-hearted man just for today.)

2432
01:49:04,817 --> 01:49:06,017
It's the smile of capitalism.

2433
01:49:06,287 --> 01:49:07,887
- How cute. - That's cute.

2434
01:49:08,957 --> 01:49:11,727
Luxurious like I'm an S-Class

2435
01:49:12,457 --> 01:49:14,357
How much longer will you keep singing that?

2436
01:49:14,627 --> 01:49:17,227
- This is public humiliation. - I'm so upset now.

2437
01:49:17,427 --> 01:49:19,766
He Zhong Xing, in my opinion,

2438
01:49:19,767 --> 01:49:21,767
you look very sexy.

2439
01:49:22,797 --> 01:49:24,337
Sexy Boy!

2440
01:49:24,467 --> 01:49:25,667
I can't wait to see his clips.

2441
01:49:26,477 --> 01:49:29,806
So we'll go with a sexy concept for you.

2442
01:49:29,807 --> 01:49:30,847
Oh, my.

2443
01:49:33,447 --> 01:49:35,217
- They got rid of the table? - What is this?

2444
01:49:36,587 --> 01:49:38,247
That's his default position.

2445
01:49:38,917 --> 01:49:40,417
- My gosh. - Oh, my.

2446
01:49:41,287 --> 01:49:42,317
Cut. Okay.

2447
01:49:42,557 --> 01:49:44,457
(Shrieking)

2448
01:49:45,527 --> 01:49:47,657
(Sexiness overload)

2449
01:49:47,927 --> 01:49:50,166
Could you show me a seductive look?

2450
01:49:50,167 --> 01:49:51,196
(Is there another participant with seductive charms?)

2451
01:49:51,197 --> 01:49:53,067
Can I expose some of my skin?

2452
01:49:53,367 --> 01:49:55,167
(Do you not need me to show some of my skin?)

2453
01:49:55,537 --> 01:49:57,097
(Why is he showing us his naked belly?)

2454
01:49:58,107 --> 01:49:59,637
Li Zi Hao. What's wrong with you?

2455
01:49:59,807 --> 01:50:01,337
Why did you do that?

2456
01:50:01,737 --> 01:50:03,377
Can I expose some of my skin?

2457
01:50:03,447 --> 01:50:05,707
- Revealing your belly is okay. - Okay, my belly.

2458
01:50:05,977 --> 01:50:07,817
- Then like this. - Try it.

2459
01:50:09,277 --> 01:50:10,317
What?

2460
01:50:10,447 --> 01:50:12,187
My gosh, cover that up already.

2461
01:50:12,517 --> 01:50:14,486
- You can work out, right? - I can.

2462
01:50:14,487 --> 01:50:16,626
How many days do you need to get well-defined abs?

2463
01:50:16,627 --> 01:50:17,987
- I'll be honest. - Yes.

2464
01:50:18,487 --> 01:50:21,627
I can make that with makeup right now.

2465
01:50:21,697 --> 01:50:24,167
(I can make that with makeup right now.)

2466
01:50:24,267 --> 01:50:26,267
(Embarrassed and shy)

2467
01:50:26,567 --> 01:50:28,897
- Gosh, they're so mean. - This is enough!

2468
01:50:30,007 --> 01:50:31,906
I want to see nice chemistry from you two.

2469
01:50:31,907 --> 01:50:34,306
Gaze at each other affectionately and lovingly.

2470
01:50:34,307 --> 01:50:35,576
All right. Let's begin now.

2471
01:50:35,577 --> 01:50:36,623
(Lovingly? Affectionately?)

2472
01:50:36,647 --> 01:50:37,677
All right, action.

2473
01:50:37,777 --> 01:50:39,446
You can hydrate your skin with it.

2474
01:50:39,447 --> 01:50:41,047
It's great for soothing your skin.

2475
01:50:42,347 --> 01:50:46,116
(Showing off our good-looking participants)

2476
01:50:46,117 --> 01:50:47,287
They're so handsome.

2477
01:50:47,417 --> 01:50:48,917
- Great. - They're so handsome.

2478
01:50:49,117 --> 01:50:50,186
Gosh, Sang Won.

2479
01:50:50,187 --> 01:50:51,333
(They still look handsome in the studio.)

2480
01:50:51,357 --> 01:50:53,456
- Be manly for this concept. - Okay.

2481
01:50:53,457 --> 01:50:55,826
- Squeeze it out generously. - Okay.

2482
01:50:55,827 --> 01:50:56,827
All right.

2483
01:50:57,327 --> 01:50:59,066
Gosh, he's squeezing out a lot of it.

2484
01:50:59,067 --> 01:51:00,067
Action.

2485
01:51:00,897 --> 01:51:01,897
Slap him.

2486
01:51:03,167 --> 01:51:04,907
You can hydrate your skin with it.

2487
01:51:05,937 --> 01:51:07,007
It's...

2488
01:51:07,477 --> 01:51:08,776
(Laughing)

2489
01:51:08,777 --> 01:51:10,406
- No. - I'm sorry.

2490
01:51:10,407 --> 01:51:11,647
You have to do it.

2491
01:51:11,807 --> 01:51:12,807
Oh, my gosh.

2492
01:51:12,808 --> 01:51:14,593
(Feeling Sang Won's soft skin makes Zhou An Xin cry out.)

2493
01:51:14,617 --> 01:51:17,217
Have you ever seen commercials where they already have lotion on?

2494
01:51:17,317 --> 01:51:19,417
It's all over his hair.

2495
01:51:19,547 --> 01:51:20,856
Okay. Good job. Thank you.

2496
01:51:20,857 --> 01:51:22,157
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2497
01:51:22,887 --> 01:51:23,957
Is this a prank?

2498
01:51:24,887 --> 01:51:27,657
(Something is off.)

2499
01:51:28,327 --> 01:51:29,826
First of all,

2500
01:51:29,827 --> 01:51:32,526
we'll make it look like it's a shoot for a commercial.

2501
01:51:32,527 --> 01:51:35,337
- I see. Yes. - We're pulling a prank on them.

2502
01:51:36,267 --> 01:51:37,907
- It was a prank. - Right.

2503
01:51:38,107 --> 01:51:40,106
What? It wasn't a real commercial?

2504
01:51:40,107 --> 01:51:42,037
No wonder. They asked me to do weird things.

2505
01:51:42,537 --> 01:51:43,946
- We're counting on you. - I'll make it look natural.

2506
01:51:43,947 --> 01:51:45,177
- Yes, that's good. - Okay.

2507
01:51:45,207 --> 01:51:46,716
I see. He was an actor?

2508
01:51:46,717 --> 01:51:48,217
Right? He's an actor, isn't he?

2509
01:51:48,877 --> 01:51:50,417
I've seen him before!

2510
01:51:50,547 --> 01:51:52,987
- Come on out. - You can start, Geon Woo.

2511
01:51:53,087 --> 01:51:54,586
It's "silky, silky, silky lotion."

2512
01:51:54,587 --> 01:51:56,487
You must say "silky" three times.

2513
01:51:56,587 --> 01:51:58,987
Apply this silky, silky, silky lotion on you.

2514
01:51:59,127 --> 01:52:01,287
So the name of the lotion is Silky Silky Silky Lotion?

2515
01:52:01,427 --> 01:52:02,797
The name was fake too?

2516
01:52:02,827 --> 01:52:03,966
- No, that was real. - The name was real.

2517
01:52:03,967 --> 01:52:05,207
- It was, right? - It was real.

2518
01:52:05,297 --> 01:52:06,527
Silky Silky Silky Lotion.

2519
01:52:07,067 --> 01:52:10,207
Silky Silky Silky Lotion.

2520
01:52:10,267 --> 01:52:11,706
I heard you guys slapped each other pretty hard.

2521
01:52:11,707 --> 01:52:13,337
- Gosh. - Action.

2522
01:52:13,607 --> 01:52:18,677
(The two of them will compete to become an advertising model.)

2523
01:52:19,577 --> 01:52:21,377
(Hydrating his skin with a smashing spike)

2524
01:52:21,517 --> 01:52:22,777
(Screaming)

2525
01:52:24,587 --> 01:52:26,517
Apply this silky, silky, silky lotion on you.

2526
01:52:28,017 --> 01:52:29,317
What am I? Your sidekick?

2527
01:52:29,557 --> 01:52:30,957
(Pulling out a famous line)

2528
01:52:32,787 --> 01:52:33,956
This is entertaining.

2529
01:52:33,957 --> 01:52:35,057
Gosh, those two...

2530
01:52:37,467 --> 01:52:38,726
- We're still friends! - We're still friends!

2531
01:52:38,727 --> 01:52:40,467
(It's a happy ending.)

2532
01:52:40,667 --> 01:52:41,836
(Their deep friendship is more important than the ad.)

2533
01:52:41,837 --> 01:52:43,567
- They're pretty good actors. - Okay. Cut.

2534
01:52:43,707 --> 01:52:45,436
- Nicely done. - My gosh.

2535
01:52:45,437 --> 01:52:47,906
- I can't believe this was a prank. - I know, right?

2536
01:52:47,907 --> 01:52:49,936
This was the prank. What we did afterward was the real thing.

2537
01:52:49,937 --> 01:52:51,006
Right, that was the real thing.

2538
01:52:51,007 --> 01:52:52,923
(What is the strange incident that awaits the participants?)

2539
01:52:52,947 --> 01:52:54,876
- Hello. - Hello.

2540
01:52:54,877 --> 01:52:57,317
(Lee Jeong, Jun Min, and Kang Min enter an unfamiliar place.)

2541
01:52:57,547 --> 01:52:59,227
(Lee Jeong suddenly bursts into laughter.)

2542
01:52:59,547 --> 01:53:01,157
- Hello. - Good afternoon.

2543
01:53:01,257 --> 01:53:02,257
Hi.

2544
01:53:02,258 --> 01:53:04,257
(What's going on?)

2545
01:53:05,257 --> 01:53:07,377
(A mysterious foreigner shows up at the Planet Camp.)

2546
01:53:07,597 --> 01:53:10,726
A reporter came here to do a story...

2547
01:53:10,727 --> 01:53:12,226
on our program.

2548
01:53:12,227 --> 01:53:13,596
From which agency?

2549
01:53:13,597 --> 01:53:15,497
I'm a reporter at LA Times.

2550
01:53:15,567 --> 01:53:18,266
Hello. My name is Kim In Hu.

2551
01:53:18,267 --> 01:53:19,267
I'm so sorry.

2552
01:53:20,537 --> 01:53:23,136
Can you do it in English?

2553
01:53:23,137 --> 01:53:24,706
(They can only speak in English.)

2554
01:53:24,707 --> 01:53:25,776
I'm sorry.

2555
01:53:25,777 --> 01:53:27,146
Who is your role model?

2556
01:53:27,147 --> 01:53:29,146
It differs from that of celebrities...

2557
01:53:29,147 --> 01:53:31,347
in the Western entertainment industry.

2558
01:53:31,647 --> 01:53:33,987
- Okay. Let's go. - Great.

2559
01:53:37,327 --> 01:53:38,987
(Surprised)

2560
01:53:39,327 --> 01:53:41,196
- Hi. Good afternoon. - Hi.

2561
01:53:41,197 --> 01:53:42,457
Nice to meet you.

2562
01:53:42,957 --> 01:53:44,526
Let's check your microphone.

2563
01:53:44,527 --> 01:53:46,966
You need to put it on your clothes.

2564
01:53:46,967 --> 01:53:48,443
(They start hearing English as they get the microphone.)

2565
01:53:48,467 --> 01:53:49,597
You were nervous.

2566
01:53:49,767 --> 01:53:51,666
Can you please look at the camera...

2567
01:53:51,667 --> 01:53:55,077
and appeal to your Global Star Creators?

2568
01:53:55,577 --> 01:53:56,607
I see.

2569
01:53:57,277 --> 01:53:59,106
(You do it.)

2570
01:53:59,107 --> 01:54:00,516
(You go first.)

2571
01:54:00,517 --> 01:54:02,047
You first.

2572
01:54:02,277 --> 01:54:03,387
He used his shoulders.

2573
01:54:04,887 --> 01:54:07,187
Do you see the use of Korean lyrics...

2574
01:54:07,217 --> 01:54:09,716
as a challenge for K-pop's global reach?

2575
01:54:09,717 --> 01:54:11,927
Or is it one of its unique strengths?

2576
01:54:13,457 --> 01:54:15,617
(Sun Heng Yu picks up on one English word, challenge.)

2577
01:54:17,697 --> 01:54:19,097
(The "HOLA SOLAR" challenge?)

2578
01:54:19,227 --> 01:54:21,937
- Do you want the challenge? - The "HOLA SOLAR" challenge?

2579
01:54:22,037 --> 01:54:23,367
The "HOLA SOLAR" challenge?

2580
01:54:23,567 --> 01:54:24,727
- Seriously. - This is crazy.

2581
01:54:25,737 --> 01:54:27,036
(Challenge: A difficult task or problem...)

2582
01:54:27,037 --> 01:54:28,306
(that tests someone's abilities, strength, or determination)

2583
01:54:28,307 --> 01:54:29,436
(Challenge: An invitation to take part...)

2584
01:54:29,437 --> 01:54:30,623
(in a contest, activity, or popular online trend)

2585
01:54:30,647 --> 01:54:32,377
I thought it was an English listening test.

2586
01:54:33,177 --> 01:54:36,077
If K-pop were to influence other cultures,

2587
01:54:36,217 --> 01:54:38,887
what values do you believe it should convey?

2588
01:54:41,687 --> 01:54:43,187
Can you speak in Korean?

2589
01:54:43,387 --> 01:54:44,457
Excuse me?

2590
01:54:46,457 --> 01:54:48,657
Why did you ask her to speak in Korean?

2591
01:54:48,727 --> 01:54:50,567
(The out-of-the-box approach to learning)

2592
01:54:50,727 --> 01:54:52,426
The Korean concept of idols.

2593
01:54:52,427 --> 01:54:54,196
How does that differ from that...

2594
01:54:54,197 --> 01:54:56,236
of celebrities in the Western entertainment industry?

2595
01:54:56,237 --> 01:54:57,237
I see.

2596
01:54:57,467 --> 01:54:58,987
(Their forward head posture is cured.)

2597
01:55:00,407 --> 01:55:04,147
(Jun Min waits as he looks at Sang Won.)

2598
01:55:05,347 --> 01:55:07,267
- He's looking at Sang Won again. - Three times?

2599
01:55:13,857 --> 01:55:15,757
I understand, but...

2600
01:55:16,827 --> 01:55:19,387
(Then he didn't say anything after that.)

2601
01:55:20,197 --> 01:55:23,566
Could you share an interesting or memorable episode...

2602
01:55:23,567 --> 01:55:25,796
from your time on BOYS II PLANET?

2603
01:55:25,797 --> 01:55:27,213
(He's especially struggling to focus.)

2604
01:55:27,237 --> 01:55:30,607
She's asking us about interesting stories on the show.

2605
01:55:30,637 --> 01:55:32,337
(There are so many stories.)

2606
01:55:32,467 --> 01:55:34,337
- The second mission was "Bad." - Yes.

2607
01:55:34,437 --> 01:55:36,377
- So difficult. - So difficult.

2608
01:55:36,537 --> 01:55:39,206
Was "Rising Sun" difficult? Or was "Bad" more difficult?

2609
01:55:39,207 --> 01:55:43,077
- "Bad" was more difficult. - It was more difficult.

2610
01:55:43,417 --> 01:55:45,517
Mr. Dong Gyu was like a Spartan.

2611
01:55:47,887 --> 01:55:49,187
Mr. Dong Gyu?

2612
01:55:49,217 --> 01:55:50,357
A Spartan?

2613
01:55:50,657 --> 01:55:52,987
Mr. Jun Seo was an even bigger Spartan.

2614
01:55:53,957 --> 01:55:54,957
- Pardon? - It's...

2615
01:55:58,267 --> 01:56:00,027
(I'm sorry, but you might lose your status.)

2616
01:56:00,367 --> 01:56:02,487
(Masato had a tough time with the group of Spartans.)

2617
01:56:03,297 --> 01:56:06,207
- I'm very tired. - Spartan. Tired.

2618
01:56:07,377 --> 01:56:08,497
It must've been hard on you.

2619
01:56:08,877 --> 01:56:10,177
Your English is great.

2620
01:56:10,777 --> 01:56:11,897
English is about confidence.

2621
01:56:12,207 --> 01:56:13,916
Should cultural identities...

2622
01:56:13,917 --> 01:56:15,646
be something K-pop preserves?

2623
01:56:15,647 --> 01:56:18,417
Or should it adapt international preferences?

2624
01:56:19,047 --> 01:56:20,857
(English is about confidence.)

2625
01:56:21,057 --> 01:56:22,457
I want to say something.

2626
01:56:22,717 --> 01:56:24,187
The first one is...

2627
01:56:24,787 --> 01:56:26,757
(Show them your confidence.)

2628
01:56:26,897 --> 01:56:30,057
I'm so sorry, English teacher.

2629
01:56:30,597 --> 01:56:31,667
Me too.

2630
01:56:32,127 --> 01:56:33,467
Sorry, parents.

2631
01:56:36,867 --> 01:56:38,387
Why did you apologize to your parents?

2632
01:56:38,637 --> 01:56:40,066
Good job.

2633
01:56:40,067 --> 01:56:41,306
(They quickly wrap up the interview.)

2634
01:56:41,307 --> 01:56:43,546
- What? - That was a fun interview.

2635
01:56:43,547 --> 01:56:45,023
(They suddenly hear a familiar language.)

2636
01:56:45,047 --> 01:56:46,546
This is killing me.

2637
01:56:46,547 --> 01:56:47,877
(Come on.)

2638
01:56:48,977 --> 01:56:50,117
Well, I guess so.

2639
01:56:50,817 --> 01:56:52,646
How will K-pop influence...

2640
01:56:52,647 --> 01:56:54,316
the global music industry?

2641
01:56:54,317 --> 01:56:55,857
This was a prank too.

2642
01:56:55,957 --> 01:56:57,227
- What? - Come on.

2643
01:56:57,587 --> 01:56:59,726
Gosh, it was a prank. No wonder.

2644
01:56:59,727 --> 01:57:01,957
My gosh. That was so mean.

2645
01:57:02,327 --> 01:57:04,397
(A strange day at the Planet Camp is over.)

2646
01:57:05,267 --> 01:57:06,667
Gosh, that was funny.

2647
01:57:06,867 --> 01:57:08,067
That was funny.

2648
01:57:08,397 --> 01:57:10,767
It was a sweet break, albeit short.

2649
01:57:10,837 --> 01:57:14,007
We watched clips from a strange day at the Planet Camp together.

2650
01:57:15,507 --> 01:57:17,046
All right. Let's keep going...

2651
01:57:17,047 --> 01:57:19,947
with the Second Survivor Announcement.

2652
01:57:20,577 --> 01:57:22,917
The position we'll be announcing the survivors for next...

2653
01:57:24,017 --> 01:57:25,147
I think it'll be rap.

2654
01:57:25,447 --> 01:57:27,557
Dance? But it'll be dance, right?

2655
01:57:28,457 --> 01:57:30,216
- It's coming to the rappers. - It's coming to the rappers.

2656
01:57:30,217 --> 01:57:31,426
(The camera moves towards the rap participants.)

2657
01:57:31,427 --> 01:57:33,187
- It's coming to the rappers. - Don't come.

2658
01:57:34,157 --> 01:57:35,257
It's rap.

2659
01:57:35,997 --> 01:57:37,796
- Let's go. - Good luck!

2660
01:57:37,797 --> 01:57:39,027
Let's go, guys.

2661
01:57:40,497 --> 01:57:42,037
- Let's go. - Go!

2662
01:57:42,767 --> 01:57:45,837
(Survivor Announcement: Rap)

2663
01:57:46,137 --> 01:57:47,737
The performances for the rap position...

2664
01:57:49,577 --> 01:57:51,576
(With innovative ideas and self-written lyrics)

2665
01:57:51,577 --> 01:57:53,616
The lyrics that contained each person's own honest story...

2666
01:57:53,617 --> 01:57:55,317
left lasting impressions.

2667
01:57:56,047 --> 01:58:01,357
(The rap position teams competed against one another.)

2668
01:58:02,687 --> 01:58:06,086
And Team "FAMOUS" was voted the number one rap position team...

2669
01:58:06,087 --> 01:58:08,207
- and took the benefit. - Our team did insanely well!

2670
01:58:09,227 --> 01:58:11,466
Among the nine participants who performed on stage...

2671
01:58:11,467 --> 01:58:15,467
for the rap position, how many will take the survivor's seats?

2672
01:58:15,867 --> 01:58:17,807
I will reveal those results now.

2673
01:58:18,767 --> 01:58:20,607
Which rank was Jae Hyun?

2674
01:58:20,937 --> 01:58:22,806
I mean last week. Doesn't he have a good chance?

2675
01:58:22,807 --> 01:58:23,976
He got 250,000 points as his benefit.

2676
01:58:23,977 --> 01:58:25,047
- Right. - He does.

2677
01:58:25,277 --> 01:58:28,647
I think Lee Jeong could get around 11th or 12th place.

2678
01:58:29,117 --> 01:58:30,217
Gosh, Jun Lee Jeong.

2679
01:58:30,387 --> 01:58:32,987
Seeing how Jun Il shot up to 13th place...

2680
01:58:33,987 --> 01:58:35,217
I think he'll get a high rank.

2681
01:58:35,987 --> 01:58:38,356
The highest rank of the survivor...

2682
01:58:38,357 --> 01:58:40,257
in the rap position was...

2683
01:58:41,157 --> 01:58:43,257
- Seventeenth? - Twenty-second?

2684
01:58:44,067 --> 01:58:45,297
Which place will it be?

2685
01:58:46,297 --> 01:58:47,537
It's 12th place.

2686
01:58:48,137 --> 01:58:49,167
That's high.

2687
01:58:53,607 --> 01:58:54,707
It's really high.

2688
01:58:54,837 --> 01:58:58,647
(Rap, Survivor, 12th place)

2689
01:58:59,377 --> 01:59:00,577
Who is it?

2690
01:59:01,547 --> 01:59:03,046
- Li Zi Hao? - Li Zi Hao!

2691
01:59:03,047 --> 01:59:04,246
Hot pink Li Zi Hao?

2692
01:59:04,247 --> 01:59:05,493
(31st, Li Zi Hao, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2693
01:59:05,517 --> 01:59:06,786
I think this will be Lee Jeong.

2694
01:59:06,787 --> 01:59:08,793
(23rd, Jun Lee Jeong, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2695
01:59:08,817 --> 01:59:12,327
The participant who shot up in rank and took 12th place is...

2696
01:59:12,957 --> 01:59:14,957
(19th, Yi Chen, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2697
01:59:14,997 --> 01:59:16,427
- Shot up? - Yes.

2698
01:59:17,697 --> 01:59:20,067
Has this person had the leader sticker before?

2699
01:59:22,237 --> 01:59:23,266
Yes, he has?

2700
01:59:23,267 --> 01:59:24,343
(23rd, Jun Lee Jeong, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2701
01:59:24,367 --> 01:59:25,367
He hasn't.

2702
01:59:26,637 --> 01:59:27,677
He has.

2703
01:59:28,807 --> 01:59:30,137
Isn't it Zhong Xing?

2704
01:59:30,377 --> 01:59:31,447
Zhong Xing?

2705
01:59:32,147 --> 01:59:34,216
(He Zhong Xing put the leader sticker on his shirt...)

2706
01:59:34,217 --> 01:59:36,177
(with force on Team "Hot.")

2707
01:59:36,777 --> 01:59:37,847
He Zhong Xing!

2708
01:59:39,347 --> 01:59:41,516
(36th, He Zhong Xing, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2709
01:59:41,517 --> 01:59:42,657
(Gosh, 12th place.)

2710
01:59:42,887 --> 01:59:45,387
- It's really not me. It's not. - Ye Chan?

2711
01:59:46,387 --> 01:59:47,497
Ye Chan?

2712
01:59:47,827 --> 01:59:50,057
No way.

2713
01:59:50,467 --> 01:59:51,967
Lee Jeong has been the leader too.

2714
01:59:53,167 --> 01:59:54,667
Chen did get the sticker too.

2715
01:59:54,837 --> 01:59:56,037
Technically, he has.

2716
01:59:57,407 --> 02:00:00,707
(The leader sticker was on Yi Chen's shirt at first.)

2717
02:00:04,847 --> 02:00:09,417
(However, Yeom Ye Chan took the leader sticker off.)

2718
02:00:09,747 --> 02:00:11,046
(For your information, someone who had the sticker temporarily...)

2719
02:00:11,047 --> 02:00:12,527
(is also included in the candidates.)

2720
02:00:12,617 --> 02:00:14,386
The first survivor in the rap position...

2721
02:00:14,387 --> 02:00:16,517
who has been chosen by Star Creators.

2722
02:00:18,687 --> 02:00:21,556
(23rd, Jun Lee Jeong, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2723
02:00:21,557 --> 02:00:24,227
(36th, He Zhong Xing, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2724
02:00:24,597 --> 02:00:25,867
That participant is...

2725
02:00:33,307 --> 02:00:34,407
Jun Lee Jeong.

2726
02:00:35,407 --> 02:00:36,477
Let's go.

2727
02:00:37,037 --> 02:00:38,747
That's awesome.

2728
02:00:42,377 --> 02:00:43,447
Amazing.

2729
02:00:46,047 --> 02:00:48,316
- He went up. - Yes, Lee Jeong went up.

2730
02:00:48,317 --> 02:00:49,387
Go!

2731
02:00:51,687 --> 02:00:53,127
- Let's go. - That's good.

2732
02:00:53,427 --> 02:00:54,897
- Let's go. - "Hot."

2733
02:00:55,697 --> 02:00:58,066
He's totally the main character of an epic story.

2734
02:00:58,067 --> 02:00:59,327
He has always gone up in rank.

2735
02:00:59,897 --> 02:01:02,936
Participant Jun Lee Jeong even won the benefit...

2736
02:01:02,937 --> 02:01:04,713
when it was his first time in the rap position.

2737
02:01:04,737 --> 02:01:07,136
It's not that. Zhong Xing says he wants to leave.

2738
02:01:07,137 --> 02:01:10,807
(Jun Lee Jeong was always in the middle of conflicts.)

2739
02:01:11,307 --> 02:01:15,617
(However, he always overcame the crises...)

2740
02:01:16,177 --> 02:01:21,157
(and even took the benefit with the performance of "Hot.")

2741
02:01:21,787 --> 02:01:25,487
As a result, he shot up from 23rd place to 12th place...

2742
02:01:25,757 --> 02:01:27,997
and successfully survived with a high rank.

2743
02:01:28,327 --> 02:01:29,327
Congratulations.

2744
02:01:30,057 --> 02:01:31,227
Look at this guy.

2745
02:01:33,867 --> 02:01:37,536
I want to tell the Star Creators who gave me another chance...

2746
02:01:37,537 --> 02:01:39,567
to perform on stage that...

2747
02:01:40,007 --> 02:01:42,607
I am very grateful.

2748
02:01:43,377 --> 02:01:46,547
When I decided to appear on this show with Jun Min,

2749
02:01:48,147 --> 02:01:51,617
I was determined to debut here.

2750
02:01:52,787 --> 02:01:55,487
I haven't made it into the ranks of the debut group yet,

2751
02:01:55,987 --> 02:01:57,386
but I'll only think about debuting...

2752
02:01:57,387 --> 02:02:00,027
and try my very best.

2753
02:02:00,187 --> 02:02:02,257
I love you and thank you always.

2754
02:02:03,997 --> 02:02:05,027
Good job.

2755
02:02:05,867 --> 02:02:06,997
He's so cool.

2756
02:02:07,797 --> 02:02:10,967
The next participant to survive in the rap position is ranked...

2757
02:02:11,867 --> 02:02:13,337
I think it'll drop down a lot.

2758
02:02:14,177 --> 02:02:15,707
In 17th place.

2759
02:02:15,907 --> 02:02:16,907
(Kim Dong Yun)

2760
02:02:16,908 --> 02:02:17,977
That's high.

(Rap, Survivor, 17th place)

2762
02:02:22,247 --> 02:02:23,417
What? Who is it?

2763
02:02:23,747 --> 02:02:24,817
Is it Yi Chen?

2764
02:02:25,047 --> 02:02:27,047
(19th, Yi Chen, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2765
02:02:27,217 --> 02:02:28,457
Is it Seo Won?

2766
02:02:28,857 --> 02:02:30,157
It's Jae Hyun.

2767
02:02:30,487 --> 02:02:31,586
What do you mean, it's me?

2768
02:02:31,587 --> 02:02:32,956
You have 250,000 points.

2769
02:02:32,957 --> 02:02:33,997
It's not me.

2770
02:02:34,457 --> 02:02:36,027
The participant in 17th place...

2771
02:02:36,127 --> 02:02:39,827
has gone up in rank since the First Survivor Announcement.

2772
02:02:40,597 --> 02:02:41,737
Isn't it Zhong Xing?

2773
02:02:42,337 --> 02:02:43,337
Zhong Xing?

2774
02:02:43,338 --> 02:02:44,366
(36th, He Zhong Xing, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2775
02:02:44,367 --> 02:02:46,967
Who else has the benefit other than Zhong Xing?

2776
02:02:47,277 --> 02:02:48,676
- You. - I have it.

2777
02:02:48,677 --> 02:02:50,317
- There are 3... - He has 250,000 points.

2778
02:02:50,437 --> 02:02:51,976
- It's probably Jae Hyun, right? - Jae Hyun.

2779
02:02:51,977 --> 02:02:53,147
You think so, right?

2780
02:02:53,647 --> 02:02:57,586
Also, acting cute is this participant's strong suit.

2781
02:02:57,587 --> 02:02:59,317
- Acting cute? - Then, it's not me.

2782
02:02:59,887 --> 02:03:02,017
- I think it's Seo Won. - Oh, Seo Won?

2783
02:03:02,287 --> 02:03:03,926
Oh, Won! It's you.

2784
02:03:03,927 --> 02:03:05,187
I think it could be you.

2785
02:03:05,787 --> 02:03:07,957
You could say Li Zi Hao is cute too.

2786
02:03:08,397 --> 02:03:10,097
Li Zi Hao acts cute so much.

2787
02:03:10,827 --> 02:03:12,667
Li Zi Hao acted cute the most out of everyone.

2788
02:03:14,737 --> 02:03:17,436
Is there a participant who feels confident in acting cute?

2789
02:03:17,437 --> 02:03:18,667
(Anyone?)

2790
02:03:25,577 --> 02:03:26,577
My goodness.

2791
02:03:27,147 --> 02:03:28,217
My gosh.

02:03:31,787 --> 02:03:32,817
My gosh.

2793
02:03:39,157 --> 02:03:40,927
I can't go that far.

2794
02:03:41,727 --> 02:03:42,897
You're so adorable.

2795
02:03:43,827 --> 02:03:46,127
(The Planet Master has fallen for Li Zi Hao's charm.)

2796
02:03:46,467 --> 02:03:47,537
Okay, then.

2797
02:03:48,067 --> 02:03:51,007
I will reveal the participant who has survived with 17th place.

2798
02:03:51,737 --> 02:03:54,737
The survivor at 17th place who will get to continue his journey.

2799
02:03:56,277 --> 02:03:57,577
That person is...

2800
02:03:59,077 --> 02:04:00,107
Hao.

2801
02:04:00,877 --> 02:04:01,917
Won.

2802
02:04:03,677 --> 02:04:06,617
It's the adorable Li Zi Hao.

02:04:33,477 --> 02:04:35,577
Gosh, I'm so happy.

2811
02:04:35,777 --> 02:04:37,647
How many ranks did he go up?

2812
02:04:38,487 --> 02:04:40,187
Let's go!

2813
02:04:40,687 --> 02:04:41,857

- You have the best looks. - Let's go!

2817
02:04:48,897 --> 02:04:51,526
Yes, with the support of Star Creators giving him strength,

2818
02:04:51,527 --> 02:04:54,137
participant Li Zi Hao survived with a high rank.

2819
02:04:54,567 --> 02:04:55,637
Congratulations.

2820
02:04:59,307 --> 02:05:00,336
(Li Zi Hao, 17th, 3,074,115 points)

2821
02:05:00,337 --> 02:05:01,337
That's impressive.

2822
02:05:02,507 --> 02:05:03,777
Team "Hot" is so strong.

2823
02:05:04,607 --> 02:05:05,877
First of all,

2824
02:05:06,677 --> 02:05:10,617
I never imagined that I'd survive until this point.

2825
02:05:10,917 --> 02:05:13,917
That's because, even when I was a part of a group,

2826
02:05:14,217 --> 02:05:17,017
I was really not that popular.

2827
02:05:17,357 --> 02:05:20,257
I'm so grateful for everyone giving me...

2828
02:05:20,687 --> 02:05:24,797
so much love and support.

2829
02:05:25,297 --> 02:05:28,597
I want to keep going until the end with everyone here.

2830
02:05:29,197 --> 02:05:30,197
So,

2831
02:05:30,697 --> 02:05:33,307
I will show you with this next performance as well.

2832
02:05:33,437 --> 02:05:34,777
I love you, Star Creators.

2833
02:05:35,477 --> 02:05:37,207
- Thank you. - Let's go!

2834
02:05:39,477 --> 02:05:40,507
Good job.

2835
02:05:42,247 --> 02:05:44,416
Participant Li Zi Hao's performance of "Hot..."

2836
02:05:44,417 --> 02:05:46,247
became even more perfect...

2837
02:05:46,587 --> 02:05:49,617
thanks to Sang Won. How about you act cute to thank him?

2838
02:05:50,787 --> 02:05:52,226
(Sang Won told me)

2839
02:05:52,227 --> 02:05:53,486
(I have the best looks)

2840
02:05:53,487 --> 02:05:54,497
(Smooching)

2841
02:06:00,937 --> 02:06:02,337
Don't do that, Sang Won!

2842
02:06:05,607 --> 02:06:08,237
Please move to your seat.

2843
02:06:17,347 --> 02:06:20,047
I will continue to announce the survivors.

2844
02:06:20,217 --> 02:06:22,217
The next survivor in the rap position.

2845
02:06:23,117 --> 02:06:25,087
No way. The next survivor...

2846
02:06:25,757 --> 02:06:27,387
I think they'll be close in rank.

2847
02:06:27,627 --> 02:06:29,597
There's more.

2848
02:06:29,827 --> 02:06:30,927
I think there will be more.

2849
02:06:31,397 --> 02:06:32,567
And Zhong Xing.

2850
02:06:33,827 --> 02:06:35,797
The next survivor in the rap position.

2851
02:06:46,877 --> 02:06:48,617
- There are no more. - What?

2852
02:06:49,377 --> 02:06:50,447
What?

(33rd, Kim Jae Hyun, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2854
02:06:56,417 --> 02:06:58,156
Even if your name isn't called now,

2855
02:06:58,157 --> 02:07:01,427
you could become a candidate for the Top Eight or be ranked 23rd,

2856
02:07:01,527 --> 02:07:04,427
so please wait for the results until the end.

2857
02:07:05,297 --> 02:07:06,627

2859
02:07:13,907 --> 02:07:16,807
The announcements for two positions, vocals and rap, are now over.

2860
02:07:17,137 --> 02:07:20,407
Seven participants have confirmed their survival.

2861
02:07:20,507 --> 02:07:23,446
Excluding the candidate for the Top 8, 23rd, and 24th,

2862
02:07:23,447 --> 02:07:27,387
there are only six seats remaining.

2863
02:07:28,557 --> 02:07:30,417
The rest will be all dancers.

2864
02:07:30,857 --> 02:07:32,987
I'm nervous now that it's my turn soon.

2865
02:07:33,087 --> 02:07:35,196
It's all right. Don't be nervous.

2866
02:07:35,197 --> 02:07:37,697

There are so many dancers.

2869
02:07:44,707 --> 02:07:46,967
Only six of them will survive.

2870
02:07:47,067 --> 02:07:50,907
I don't mind placing last. Just let me keep doing this.

2871
02:07:51,177 --> 02:07:52,977

02:08:05,327 --> 02:08:07,827
Yumeki. Ching Yu.

2878
02:08:08,027 --> 02:08:09,156
Oh, there's Ching Yu too.

2879
02:08:09,157 --> 02:08:11,497
- Chen Kai Wen? - Zhang Jia Hao.

2880
02:08:11,767 --> 02:08:14,237
There are so many candidates qualified for the 11th place.

2881
02:08:15,897 --> 02:08:19,237
This participant stands out even more on the stage,

2882
02:08:20,867 --> 02:08:25,477
and he once shed tears on TV.

2883
02:08:26,007 --> 02:08:27,677
It's Jun Min.

2884
02:08:29,077 --> 02:08:31,287
(In the Class Switch Position Battle)

2885
02:08:32,787 --> 02:08:36,587
(Jun Min burst into tears when Kany comforted him.)

2886
02:08:39,227 --> 02:08:40,257
Jun Min.

2887
02:08:40,527 --> 02:08:41,896
Yumeki cried too.

2888
02:08:41,897 --> 02:08:43,827

After the rehearsal for "Whiplash."

2891
02:08:49,997 --> 02:08:52,507
- Su Ren. - Su Ren.

2892

(While preparing for the Class Switch Position Battle, )

2893
02:08:56,507 --> 02:08:59,807
(Su Ren burst into tears as he was upset.)

2894
02:09:00,077 --> 02:09:02,177

2895
02:09:03,847 --> 02:09:05,947
(From the Signal Song Test to now, )

2896
02:09:06,587 --> 02:09:09,587

(27th, Kim Jun Min, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

2900

And in the self-introduction, he wrote that his favorite song...

2901
02:09:21,497 --> 02:09:23,137
This will tell us if it's Jun Min or not.

2902
02:09:23,937 --> 02:09:25,166
(Jun Min's self-introduction)

2903

2905
02:09:30,777 --> 02:09:32,746
It was a song by Justin Bieber.

2906

- Is it you? - Yes.

2907
02:09:35,417 --> 02:09:36,546

2909
02:09:38,547 --> 02:09:40,747
Jun Min, your favorite song is a song by Justin Bieber?

2910
02:09:42,387 --> 02:09:44,116
Mine too.

2911
02:09:44,117 --> 02:09:45,127
You too?

2912
02:09:45,187 --> 02:09:47,856
- So did Geon Woo. - They have so much in common.

2913
02:09:47,857 --> 02:09:48,896
(They both chose a song by Justin Bieber.)

2914
02:09:48,897 --> 02:09:50,157
Did Gun Woo cry?

2915
02:09:50,257 --> 02:09:51,927
He cried when practicing "LALALALA."

2916
02:09:53,027 --> 02:09:56,567
(Geon Woo also cried before.)

2917
02:09:58,237 --> 02:10:00,637
- I can't tell anymore. - Me neither.

2918
02:10:00,767 --> 02:10:03,107
I will announce the 11th-place survivor.

2919
02:10:05,347 --> 02:10:06,377
It is...

02:10:08,677 --> 02:10:10,016
Kim Jun Min.

2921
02:10:10,017 --> 02:10:12,587
(Kim Jun Min survives in 11th place.)

2922
02:10:17,087 --> 02:10:18,827
Jun Min deserves it.

2923
02:10:19,157 --> 02:10:20,926
Jun Min and Lee Jeong can sit next to each other.

2924
02:10:20,927 --> 02:10:21,997
Both in one frame.

2925
02:10:22,657 --> 02:10:24,327
Congratulations on your survival.

2926
02:10:24,927 --> 02:10:27,126
From the last Survivor Announcement,

2927
02:10:27,127 --> 02:10:30,337
he went up 16 places.

2928
02:10:30,537 --> 02:10:33,306
(He went from 27th to 11th place.)

2929
02:10:33,307 --> 02:10:35,176
He's survived...

2930
02:10:35,177 --> 02:10:36,706
in 11th place, which is very high.

2931
02:10:36,707 --> 02:10:38,477
Did you see it coming?

2932
02:10:39,807 --> 02:10:42,247
Actually... Gosh.

2933
02:10:43,117 --> 02:10:46,116
I never knew I'd place so high.

2934
02:10:46,117 --> 02:10:50,517
I'd like to thank the Star Creators first.

2935
02:10:50,787 --> 02:10:53,226
And I want to thank the members...

2936
02:10:53,227 --> 02:10:56,196
of Team "like JENNIE."

2937
02:10:56,197 --> 02:10:57,457
Thank you so much.

2938
02:10:58,897 --> 02:11:00,467

2939
02:11:00,897 --> 02:11:02,436
- So cool. - That's amazing.

2940
02:11:02,437 --> 02:11:04,137
- Good. - Nice.

2941
02:11:04,367 --> 02:11:05,907
Please let me come with you.

2942
02:11:06,167 --> 02:11:08,807
The next survivor's ranking is...

2943
02:11:09,407 --> 02:11:12,007
(Dance, survivor, 18th place)

2944
02:11:12,207 --> 02:11:14,306
- It's 18th place. - It's 18th place.

2945
02:11:14,307 --> 02:11:16,176
That's my former ranking.

2946
02:11:16,177 --> 02:11:18,187
Oh, goodness.

2947
02:11:18,547 --> 02:11:20,616
The 18th-place participant earned an individual benefit...

2948
02:11:20,617 --> 02:11:22,687
in the second mission.

2949
02:11:22,917 --> 02:11:24,987
- Okay. - Yun Seo?

2950
02:11:26,427 --> 02:11:29,427
(He showed off his charms by performing "XXL.")

2951
02:11:29,527 --> 02:11:33,427
(Na Yun Seo, 1,420)

2952
02:11:33,597 --> 02:11:35,266
But so many people won the benefit.

2953
02:11:35,267 --> 02:11:36,497
An individual benefit?

2954
02:11:36,867 --> 02:11:38,066
Hao also won it.

2955
02:11:38,067 --> 02:11:39,267
We all won one.

2956
02:11:39,467 --> 02:11:41,406
(Showing impressive stage presence, )

2957
02:11:41,407 --> 02:11:43,907
(Jia Hao stayed in the All Star Class.)

2958
02:11:44,307 --> 02:11:46,606
(Kai Wen also pulled off the killing part perfectly...)

2959
02:11:46,607 --> 02:11:49,217
(to stay in the All Star Class and won the benefit.)

2960
02:11:49,377 --> 02:11:51,446
Geon Woo? It won't be Geon Woo, right?

2961
02:11:51,447 --> 02:11:52,617
I won the benefit too.

2962
02:11:52,887 --> 02:11:54,616
(Kim Geon Woo, 1,310)

2963
02:11:54,617 --> 02:11:58,287
(He also won an individual benefit.)

2964
02:11:58,487 --> 02:11:59,557
Gosh.

2965
02:12:00,687 --> 02:12:02,957
This participant's shoe size is...

2966
02:12:04,427 --> 02:12:07,227
You're 270mm, right, Yun Seo?

2967
02:12:07,327 --> 02:12:11,637
It's 265mm.

2968
02:12:12,207 --> 02:12:14,067
- Isn't it Yun Seo? - No.

2969
02:12:14,167 --> 02:12:17,307
(Geon Woo's shoe size is 280mm.)

2970
02:12:18,377 --> 02:12:20,176
- Whose shoe size is that? - Who is it?

2971
02:12:20,177 --> 02:12:21,737
How do you convert it to Chinese units?

2972
02:12:22,117 --> 02:12:24,347
How are Jia Yang's feet so small?

2973
02:12:24,787 --> 02:12:25,917
Sun Jia Yang.

2974
02:12:26,387 --> 02:12:27,886
- Jia Yang? - It can't be.

2975
02:12:27,887 --> 02:12:28,986
He didn't win the individual benefit.

2976
02:12:28,987 --> 02:12:30,057
He didn't?

2977
02:12:30,157 --> 02:12:32,226
There's no one.

2978
02:12:32,227 --> 02:12:34,556
- Who wears 265mm? - Jia Yang?

2979
02:12:34,557 --> 02:12:35,756
- Wait. There's no one. - But...

2980
02:12:35,757 --> 02:12:37,426
- Is it me? - Isn't it?

2981
02:12:37,427 --> 02:12:41,666
Can you raise your hand if you wear 265mm?

2982
02:12:41,667 --> 02:12:42,766
That's not my size anymore.

2983
02:12:42,767 --> 02:12:44,807
- There's no one. - Isn't it Yun Seo?

2984
02:12:45,937 --> 02:12:48,237
Maybe they don't know their shoe sizes.

2985
02:12:49,677 --> 02:12:51,576
I don't remember mine.

2986
02:12:51,577 --> 02:12:53,547
(Kai Wen doesn't remember his Korean shoe size.)

2987
02:12:53,707 --> 02:12:55,646
Wait. It's you, Yun Seo.

2988
02:12:55,647 --> 02:12:57,616
I wear 265mm if they're sneakers,

2989
02:12:57,617 --> 02:12:59,423
- Yes, so it's you. - but my feet grew along the way.

2990
02:12:59,447 --> 02:13:02,057
- Of course, they grow. - I used to wear 265mm.

2991
02:13:03,157 --> 02:13:04,826
- I don't think it's me. - No, it's you.

2992
02:13:04,827 --> 02:13:06,657
- My size changed. - Could it be Yun Seo?

2993
02:13:07,327 --> 02:13:09,057
He's the only one, then.

2994
02:13:09,157 --> 02:13:11,096
It's probably 41 or 42 in Chinese.

2995
02:13:11,097 --> 02:13:13,097
(Fan Zhe Yi)

2996
02:13:13,497 --> 02:13:16,237
It's 41 or 42? It's me.

2997
02:13:16,537 --> 02:13:18,136
- Seriously? - I think it's me.

2998
02:13:18,137 --> 02:13:19,907
- Kai Wen? - Kai, you wear 265mm?

2999
02:13:21,107 --> 02:13:23,507
- It's me. - Do you wear 265mm?

3000
02:13:23,607 --> 02:13:25,347
(Kai Wen's shoe size is 265mm.)

3001
02:13:26,547 --> 02:13:28,576
Has this participant's shoe...

3002
02:13:28,577 --> 02:13:31,887
come off on the stage or not?

3003
02:13:32,687 --> 02:13:34,316
It's not you. It's that kid.

3004
02:13:34,317 --> 02:13:36,857
- Has your shoe ever come off? - No.

3005
02:13:38,127 --> 02:13:39,327
It was Yun Seo.

3006
02:13:40,287 --> 02:13:42,657
It must be Sang Won.

3007
02:13:43,397 --> 02:13:44,457
It's Sang Won.

3008
02:13:44,727 --> 02:13:46,227
I wear 280mm.

3009
02:13:46,967 --> 02:13:50,066
If it's related to shoes coming off, Yun Seo is the only one.

3010
02:13:50,067 --> 02:13:52,036
- The 18th-place survivor... - Please.

3011
02:13:52,037 --> 02:13:53,866
- It has to be you. - It's you.

3012
02:13:53,867 --> 02:13:56,137
- Why are you worried? - It has to be you.

3013
02:13:56,237 --> 02:13:57,307
Please.

3014
02:13:58,147 --> 02:13:59,476
It's Chen Kai Wen.

3015
02:13:59,477 --> 02:14:01,747
(Chen Kai Wen survives in 18th place.)

3016
02:14:03,077 --> 02:14:04,077
Seriously?

3017
02:14:06,017 --> 02:14:08,487
When did your shoe come off?

3018
02:14:09,957 --> 02:14:11,857
When did his shoe come off?

3019
02:14:11,957 --> 02:14:14,386
It was a question. "Has it come off or not?"

3020
02:14:14,387 --> 02:14:15,897
(Realizing)

3021
02:14:16,097 --> 02:14:18,166
This can't be happening!

3022
02:14:18,167 --> 02:14:19,326
It's all right, Yun Seo.

3023
02:14:19,327 --> 02:14:21,267
It's fine. Calm down.

3024
02:14:21,967 --> 02:14:22,967
My heart dropped.

3025
02:14:23,237 --> 02:14:25,106
He went up three places...

3026
02:14:25,107 --> 02:14:27,136
and survived. Congratulations.

3027
02:14:27,137 --> 02:14:28,376
(Chen Kai Wen)

3028
02:14:28,377 --> 02:14:30,483
(Korean vote count: 186,458, global vote count: 1,406,473)

3029
02:14:30,507 --> 02:14:32,247
Your shoe size is 265mm?

3030
02:14:32,947 --> 02:14:34,376
- Right. - How are his feet so small?

3031
02:14:34,377 --> 02:14:35,377
He has such small feet.

3032
02:14:35,378 --> 02:14:37,377
Please tell us how you feel about surviving.

3033
02:14:38,547 --> 02:14:41,486
First of all, thank you so much.

3034
02:14:41,487 --> 02:14:42,986
I won't stop here.

3035
02:14:42,987 --> 02:14:45,756
I'm going to keep working hard to climb up.

3036
02:14:45,757 --> 02:14:47,156
I hope you keep rooting for me.

3037
02:14:47,157 --> 02:14:49,627
You all did great work, and thank you.

3038
02:14:56,437 --> 02:15:00,536
I will now announce the 19th-place survivor.

3039
02:15:00,537 --> 02:15:02,777
- It's 19th place. - Hao.

3040
02:15:02,877 --> 02:15:05,476
- It must be Zhang Jia Hao. - Hao.

3041
02:15:05,477 --> 02:15:07,076
It's Yumeki or Hao.

3042
02:15:07,077 --> 02:15:08,077
Or Ching Yu.

3043
02:15:08,647 --> 02:15:09,876
Zhang Jia Hao, Yumeki,

3044
02:15:09,877 --> 02:15:11,247
Hsu Ching Yu, and Na Yun Seo.

3045
02:15:11,617 --> 02:15:13,016
Why are there so many candidates?

3046
02:15:13,017 --> 02:15:14,046
Is it Ching Yu?

3047
02:15:14,047 --> 02:15:16,117
The 19th-place survivor...

3048
02:15:16,587 --> 02:15:19,027
has never dropped...

3049
02:15:20,027 --> 02:15:22,697
from the All Star Class.

3050
02:15:23,657 --> 02:15:25,526
(Startled)

3051
02:15:25,527 --> 02:15:27,296
He's never dropped from the All Star Class.

3052
02:15:27,297 --> 02:15:28,636
(Jia Hao has been an All Star in every mission.)

3053
02:15:28,637 --> 02:15:29,637
It's Hao.

3054
02:15:29,638 --> 02:15:31,198
But Yumeki has always been an All Star.

3055
02:15:31,467 --> 02:15:33,267
- He dropped this time. - This time.

3056
02:15:33,607 --> 02:15:34,937
(Yumeki, 720)

3057
02:15:35,037 --> 02:15:37,376
(Yumeki got the lowest score on the team...)

3058
02:15:37,377 --> 02:15:39,677
(and was placed in the 2 Star Class.)

3059
02:15:40,707 --> 02:15:42,817
- He dropped this time. - I apologize.

3060
02:15:43,547 --> 02:15:44,786
This time.

3061
02:15:44,787 --> 02:15:46,517
- So did I. - This time.

3062
02:15:47,247 --> 02:15:49,387
- Then, it's Jia Hao. - He did this time.

3063
02:15:49,587 --> 02:15:50,816
- Hao. - Hao?

3064
02:15:50,817 --> 02:15:53,256
- It's confirmed. - It's Jia Hao.

3065
02:15:53,257 --> 02:15:54,586
(Most of them expect it to be Jia Hao.)

3066
02:15:54,587 --> 02:15:56,356
Is there anyone else?

3067
02:15:56,357 --> 02:15:58,096
- No. - No?

3068
02:15:58,097 --> 02:15:59,266
I've always been an All Star too.

3069
02:15:59,267 --> 02:16:00,366
(16th, Kim Geon Woo, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3070
02:16:00,367 --> 02:16:01,537
It can't be.

3071
02:16:02,597 --> 02:16:03,637
Me too.

3072
02:16:04,167 --> 02:16:06,137
I'm serious.

3073
02:16:06,607 --> 02:16:09,836
Jia Hao, join us.

3074
02:16:09,837 --> 02:16:11,546
(18th, Zhang Jia Hao, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3075
02:16:11,547 --> 02:16:12,547
Geon Woo?

3076
02:16:13,507 --> 02:16:15,477
No, Geon Woo will be higher.

3077
02:16:16,077 --> 02:16:18,416
The 19th-place survivor is...

3078
02:16:18,417 --> 02:16:21,987
(Who will survive in 19th place?)

3079
02:16:24,727 --> 02:16:27,157
- Here it comes. - Zhang Jia Hao.

3080
02:16:31,157 --> 02:16:33,196
(Zhang Jia Hao survives in 19th place.)

3081
02:16:33,197 --> 02:16:34,866
You deserve it.

3082
02:16:34,867 --> 02:16:36,673
How do you say, "Congratulations," in Chinese?

3083
02:16:36,697 --> 02:16:39,307
- "Zhu he ni." - "Zhu he ni."

3084
02:16:40,407 --> 02:16:41,437
Congrats!

3085
02:16:41,837 --> 02:16:44,276
He's a brilliant participant who's always been an All Star.

3086

Congratulations on your survival.

(Jun Min moves to the 11th-place seat.)

3095
02:17:12,007 --> 02:17:13,267
This is incredible.

3096
02:17:14,207 --> 02:17:15,607
He's an impressive guy.

3097
02:17:16,137 --> 02:17:17,837
They will finally get to sit side by side.

3098
02:17:20,947 --> 02:17:23,617
(Kim Jun Min and Jun Lee Jeong of WHIB will sit side by side.)

3099
02:17:24,377 --> 02:17:25,417
Gosh, this is pretty high.

3100
02:17:26,017 --> 02:17:27,347
They must be so proud.

3101
02:17:27,547 --> 02:17:28,757
It's so touching.

3102
02:17:29,287 --> 02:17:30,387
Gosh, we're so high up.

3103
02:17:31,017 --> 02:17:32,127
That's great.

02:17:32,927 --> 02:17:34,587
Gosh, I miss Heui Chan.

3105
02:17:38,727 --> 02:17:40,267

3106
02:17:40,867 --> 02:17:41,867
in 20th place.

Is it Arctic?

(45th, Arctic, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3127
02:18:19,607 --> 02:18:21,266
- Weren't you on Team "Plot Twist?" - Was that a school uniform?

3128
02:18:21,267 --> 02:18:22,876
- Yes. - It looked like a school uniform.

3129
02:18:22,877 --> 02:18:24,877
What did you wear when you performed "Plot Twist?"

3130
02:18:25,307 --> 02:18:27,246
- Didn't you wear a school uniform? - I wore a tie.

3131
02:18:27,247 --> 02:18:28,277
Yes, I did.

3132
02:18:28,517 --> 02:18:29,517
What was that?

3133
02:18:30,277 --> 02:18:31,986
- Then I really hope it's me. - Was that the only song...

3134
02:18:31,987 --> 02:18:33,047
with school uniforms?

3135
02:18:33,517 --> 02:18:36,117
- "Tambourine" counts too. Yes. - They also wore school uniforms.

3136
02:18:36,657 --> 02:18:39,586
(Team "Tambourine" wore school uniforms on stage.)

(Hu Han Wen, Xue Su Ren, Tatsuki, and Yumeki)

Han Wen and Yumeki were on that team.

3139

Is it Yumeki? Or is it Su Ren?

3140

The top size of this participant...

3141
02:18:48,767 --> 02:18:51,397
isn't XXL. It's medium.

3142
02:18:52,207 --> 02:18:54,437
- Medium? - Shouldn't he be kind of small?

3143
02:18:54,537 --> 02:18:55,677
Who wears a medium?

3144
02:18:56,837 --> 02:18:58,036
- I don't know. - Raise your hand.

3145
02:18:58,037 --> 02:18:59,576
- Is your size medium too? - Me too.

3146
02:18:59,577 --> 02:19:00,577
Is that my size too?

02:19:00,807 --> 02:19:02,416

02:19:04,517 --> 02:19:05,517
(Everyone is checking their size.)

3150
02:19:05,518 --> 02:19:07,386
(32nd, Chen Bo Wen, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3151
02:19:07,387 --> 02:19:09,156
(8th, Masato, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3152
02:19:09,157 --> 02:19:10,677
- It's medium. - Lower your hands now.

3153
02:19:10,887 --> 02:19:12,256
(He's never worn a school uniform on stage.)

3154
02:19:12,257 --> 02:19:13,287
My size is medium too.

3155
02:19:14,357 --> 02:19:16,797
I will now announce the participant in 20th place.

3156
02:19:17,327 --> 02:19:18,497
I have no idea.

3157
02:19:19,527 --> 02:19:21,096
- Or a surprise? - There have been so many changes.

3158
02:19:21,097 --> 02:19:22,597
- I can't even guess. - Right.

3159
02:19:24,367 --> 02:19:25,767
The participant in 20th place is...

3160
02:19:31,877 --> 02:19:32,907
Na Yun Seo.

3161
02:19:34,047 --> 02:19:35,116
(Na Yun Seo survives in 20th place.)

3162
02:19:35,117 --> 02:19:36,976
- That's my Yun Seo. - Congratulations.

3163
02:19:36,977 --> 02:19:38,916
- Gosh. Come here, my baby. - Congratulations.

3164
02:19:38,917 --> 02:19:40,886
- Right here. - My baby.

3165
02:19:40,887 --> 02:19:42,186
My baby.

3166
02:19:42,187 --> 02:19:43,587
Yes, Yun Seo. I told you so.

3167
02:19:43,957 --> 02:19:45,227
His ranking went up too.

3168
02:19:45,787 --> 02:19:46,957
Congratulations.

3169
02:19:47,057 --> 02:19:48,297
Hey, Yun Seo.

3170
02:19:49,297 --> 02:19:51,226
My gosh. He was so worried.

3171
02:19:51,227 --> 02:19:52,427
He's finally going.

3172
02:19:52,567 --> 02:19:54,897
(Yun Seo is the best.)

3173
02:19:55,367 --> 02:19:56,566
Don't cry, Yun Seo.

3174
02:19:56,567 --> 02:19:58,606
(Na Yun Seo, 20th place, 2,587,433 points)

3175
02:19:58,607 --> 02:19:59,737
- There you go. - Yes.

3176
02:20:00,207 --> 02:20:01,367
Yun Seo.

3177
02:20:01,537 --> 02:20:03,337
Would you say you faced a crisis today?

3178
02:20:10,077 --> 02:20:12,887
I thought I might face a crisis today.

3179
02:20:14,487 --> 02:20:15,916
But in my opinion,

3180
02:20:15,917 --> 02:20:18,477
my real crisis was when my shoe came off during the performance.

3181
02:20:21,257 --> 02:20:22,327
That's all.

3182
02:20:24,057 --> 02:20:26,566
- That's it? - What's he saying?

3183
02:20:26,567 --> 02:20:28,097
He needs to practice public speaking.

3184
02:20:28,867 --> 02:20:30,566
His name hasn't been called yet.

3185
02:20:30,567 --> 02:20:32,236
He's your fellow trainee at CUBE.

3186
02:20:32,237 --> 02:20:35,707
Could you say something to Participant Kim Jae Hyun?

3187
02:20:36,677 --> 02:20:37,777
Well,

3188
02:20:43,217 --> 02:20:45,047
when we started our journey here,

3189
02:20:46,387 --> 02:20:48,047
we wanted to advance together...

3190
02:20:48,287 --> 02:20:50,657
or get eliminated together. That was our mindset,

3191
02:20:50,957 --> 02:20:53,587
and we've been working hard together.

3192
02:20:55,297 --> 02:20:57,726
I would like us to become All Stars together...

3193
02:20:57,727 --> 02:21:00,397
and each other's roommate.

3194
02:21:00,867 --> 02:21:02,037
I hope he makes it.

3195
02:21:02,237 --> 02:21:03,877
You guys should have tteokbokki together.

3196
02:21:04,337 --> 02:21:06,067
Jae Hyun, there's a spare room.

3197
02:21:06,937 --> 02:21:08,067
Tteokbokki sounds good.

3198
02:21:09,407 --> 02:21:12,577
The ranking of the next survivor in the dance position...

3199
02:21:16,077 --> 02:21:17,417
is 21st place.

3200
02:21:18,277 --> 02:21:20,787
(Survivor in 21st place)

3201
02:21:22,557 --> 02:21:24,756
- Excluding 23rd and 24th places, - After this...

3202
02:21:24,757 --> 02:21:26,427
there are only two spots left.

3203
02:21:27,127 --> 02:21:28,227
It's coming to an end.

3204
02:21:28,957 --> 02:21:32,497
The current class of the participant in 21st place...

3205
02:21:32,897 --> 02:21:33,927
Two Star?

3206
02:21:34,367 --> 02:21:35,436
(17th, Yumeki, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3207
02:21:35,437 --> 02:21:36,437
All Star?

3208
02:21:36,438 --> 02:21:37,973
(16th, Kim Geon Woo, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3209
02:21:37,997 --> 02:21:39,107
It's All Star.

3210
02:21:39,337 --> 02:21:41,777
There are Yumeki and Ching Yu.

3211
02:21:42,137 --> 02:21:43,307
There's also Sun Jia Yang.

3212
02:21:43,877 --> 02:21:45,507
It might be Sun Jia Yang.

3213
02:21:46,307 --> 02:21:48,277
Don't you think it might be Yumeki or Ching Yu?

3214
02:21:49,577 --> 02:21:51,946
The participant won the benefit on the show...

3215
02:21:51,947 --> 02:21:53,887
and performed on "M Countdown."

3216
02:21:54,287 --> 02:21:56,087
He must have been on Team "Whiplash" then.

3217
02:21:56,517 --> 02:21:57,816
(1-on-1 Class Battle, Special Benefit)

3218
02:21:57,817 --> 02:22:02,697

(Yumeki, Ching Yu, and Geon Woo performed on "M Countdown.")

3220
02:22:08,227 --> 02:22:09,466
Is it Geon Woo?

3221
02:22:09,467 --> 02:22:10,696
I see. It's Geon Woo.

3222
02:22:10,697 --> 02:22:12,783
(16th, Kim Geon Woo, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3223
02:22:12,807 --> 02:22:14,937
- Yumeki, Ching Yu... - Yumeki?

3224
02:22:15,807 --> 02:22:17,376
This participant has another chance...

3225
02:22:17,377 --> 02:22:19,107
to perform on stage. It is...

3226
02:22:21,207 --> 02:22:24,446
(Which participant in the dance position...)

3227
02:22:24,447 --> 02:22:27,687
(will survive in 21st place?)

3228
02:22:28,147 --> 02:22:29,557
It's Hsu Ching Yu.

3229
02:22:30,157 --> 02:22:32,486
- It's Hsu Ching Yu. - Gosh, Hsu Ching Yu.

3230

(Hsu Ching Yu survives in 21st place.)

3231
02:22:33,557 --> 02:22:34,917
- This is amazing. - Hsu Ching Yu.

3232
02:22:35,727 --> 02:22:36,827
It's Hsu Ching Yu.

3233
02:22:41,027 --> 02:22:43,137
- Well done. - Hsu Ching Yu.

3234
02:22:44,097 --> 02:22:45,366
Hsu Ching Yu's ranking...

3235
02:22:45,367 --> 02:22:47,206
dropped a few places,

3236
02:22:47,207 --> 02:22:49,737
but he safely secured a spot as a survivor.

3237
02:22:50,137 --> 02:22:51,536
Congratulations on making it through.

3238
02:22:51,537 --> 02:22:53,176
I told you that you weren't going anywhere.

3239
02:22:53,177 --> 02:22:54,207
Seriously.

3240
02:22:55,177 --> 02:22:56,276
Let's perform "Sugar HIGH."

3241
02:22:56,277 --> 02:22:57,377
- Okay. - I told you.

3242
02:22:58,587 --> 02:23:00,087
What a relief.

3243
02:23:00,747 --> 02:23:04,717
I'd like to thank the Star Creators who supported me.

3244
02:23:05,587 --> 02:23:09,427
I will work harder to rise to a higher ranking.

3245
02:23:10,227 --> 02:23:11,397
Kill the performance.

3246
02:23:11,927 --> 02:23:14,087
Gosh, there have been so many changes in the rankings.

3247
02:23:15,397 --> 02:23:16,937
All right.

Excluding the 9 candidates for the Top 8,

and the candidates for the last survivor,

3251
02:23:25,547 --> 02:23:27,347
only one spot remains now.

3252
02:23:27,807 --> 02:23:29,247
Gosh, only one spot remains.

3253

- Who will take that last spot? - Who will take it?

3254
02:23:32,247 --> 02:23:33,347
It's the last spot?

3255
02:23:34,347 --> 02:23:35,457
Yes, it's the last spot.

3256
02:23:35,517 --> 02:23:36,857
The last surviving rank...

(17th, Yumeki, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3267
02:24:04,217 --> 02:24:06,747
And he performed "Tambourine."

3268
02:24:07,017 --> 02:24:08,087
It's you.

3269

Let's go, Han Wen.

3271
02:24:11,657 --> 02:24:13,387
I might be Hu Han Wen.

3272
02:24:13,527 --> 02:24:15,457
Hu Han Wen won the benefit.

3273
02:24:16,997 --> 02:24:20,927
(Hu Han Wen put on a unique performance.)

3276
02:24:27,407 --> 02:24:30,176
- No, it's Yumeki. - Isn't it Han Wen?

3277
02:24:30,177 --> 02:24:31,946
- It must be 1 of the 2. - It's Yumeki.

3280
02:24:35,217 --> 02:24:36,446
I want us to prepare for it properly.

3281
02:24:36,447 --> 02:24:39,117
I want everyone to stand out during the performance.

3282

There's Su Ren too.

3285

my teammates worked really hard.

3304
02:25:41,807 --> 02:25:44,646
They did a great job following my lead.

3305
02:25:44,647 --> 02:25:47,046
So in the end, we put on a great performance.

3306
02:25:47,047 --> 02:25:49,856
I'll continue to show the best version of myself.

02:26:27,257 --> 02:26:31,126
The only remaining survivors now are the 9 candidates for the Top 8,

3322
02:26:31,127 --> 02:26:32,526
the participant in 23rd place,

3323
02:26:32,527 --> 02:26:35,296
and the last survivor from the three candidates...

3324
02:26:35,297 --> 02:26:36,437
for 24th place.

3325
02:26:37,697 --> 02:26:39,966
Only a total of 11 participants...

3326
02:26:39,967 --> 02:26:42,177
can take their seat to join the survivors.

3327
02:26:43,537 --> 02:26:44,577
And...

3328
02:26:44,807 --> 02:26:47,976
which participants will secure the Top Eight spots?

3329
02:26:47,977 --> 02:26:50,277
(Which of them will claim their spot in the Top 8?)

3330
02:26:50,577 --> 02:26:51,617
My gosh.

3331
02:26:52,917 --> 02:26:54,947
I will continue with the announcement.

3332
02:26:56,457 --> 02:26:59,056
I will start with two candidates...

3333
02:26:59,057 --> 02:27:01,157
for the participant in eighth place.

3334
02:27:02,597 --> 02:27:05,027
(8th Place Candidates)

3335
02:27:05,097 --> 02:27:07,497
Who are the candidates for eighth place?

3336
02:27:07,897 --> 02:27:08,897
It's Sato.

3337
02:27:08,898 --> 02:27:10,137
Kang Min or Sato?

3338
02:27:10,467 --> 02:27:11,467
I'm nervous.

3339
02:27:11,468 --> 02:27:14,407
(7th, Yoo Kang Min, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3340
02:27:14,467 --> 02:27:15,476
I wonder who they are.

3341
02:27:15,477 --> 02:27:16,636
(9th, He Xin Long, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3342
02:27:16,637 --> 02:27:20,177
Whose name will be included in the Top Eight candidates?

3343
02:27:20,707 --> 02:27:23,647
The candidates will be revealed on the screen.

3344
02:27:24,647 --> 02:27:25,786
This must be nerve-racking.

3345
02:27:25,787 --> 02:27:28,487
(Top 8 Candidates)

3346
02:27:35,657 --> 02:27:37,057
These are the Top Eight candidates.

3347
02:27:37,127 --> 02:27:39,497
Participants Masato, Yoo Kang Min...

3348
02:27:40,497 --> 02:27:42,237
Gosh, they both have insanely good looks.

3349
02:27:42,537 --> 02:27:43,767
Their looks are lethal.

3350
02:27:44,097 --> 02:27:46,567
The two participants, please come to the front.

3351
02:27:46,607 --> 02:27:48,337
I'll be back. Thank you.

3352
02:27:49,277 --> 02:27:50,337
See you later, Sato.

3353
02:27:51,177 --> 02:27:52,207
See you later.

3354
02:27:54,177 --> 02:27:56,716
Between participants Masato and Yoo Kang Min,

3355
02:27:56,717 --> 02:27:59,017
the participant whose name is called takes eighth place.

3356
02:27:59,047 --> 02:28:00,846
The participant whose name isn't called...

3357
02:28:00,847 --> 02:28:02,817
will automatically take ninth place.

3358
02:28:03,587 --> 02:28:05,687
Again... I'm in this position again.

3359
02:28:10,157 --> 02:28:12,927
(During the First Survivor Announcement)

3360
02:28:13,167 --> 02:28:17,666
(His name was called as a candidate for 8th place in the Top 8.)

3361
02:28:17,667 --> 02:28:20,867
(Masato took 8th place.)

3362
02:28:23,037 --> 02:28:24,607
Is Sato in eighth place again?

3363
02:28:27,377 --> 02:28:30,247
During the First Survivor Announcement,

3364
02:28:31,317 --> 02:28:33,847
both your names were in the Top Eight.

3365
02:28:34,847 --> 02:28:38,116
Coincidentally, in the interim rankings revealed in the sixth week,

3366
02:28:38,117 --> 02:28:39,727
participant Masato was in eighth place,

3367
02:28:40,327 --> 02:28:43,327
while participant Yoo Kang Min was in ninth.

3368
02:28:43,497 --> 02:28:47,527
Will their ranks remain the same?

3369
02:28:47,767 --> 02:28:50,567
Or will their ranks be switched?

3370
02:28:52,037 --> 02:28:54,766
As a result of the third global vote by Star Creators,

3371
02:28:54,767 --> 02:28:58,847
the participant in 8th place had 5,163,207 points.

3372
02:28:58,907 --> 02:28:59,946
Five million?

3373
02:28:59,947 --> 02:29:04,347
The participant in 9th place had 5,117,459 points.

3374
02:29:04,417 --> 02:29:06,047
The two participants had...

3375
02:29:06,287 --> 02:29:10,757
a small difference of 45,748 points that set their fates apart.

3376
02:29:13,287 --> 02:29:14,957
It's such a small difference.

3377
02:29:15,057 --> 02:29:16,957
It's such a narrow margin.

3378
02:29:18,397 --> 02:29:20,327
Will Sato be in eighth place again?

3379
02:29:20,667 --> 02:29:22,126
Not the pink-haired boy.

3380
02:29:22,127 --> 02:29:24,836
(Masato performed successfully as Sexy Sato...)

3381
02:29:24,837 --> 02:29:27,237
(in the Class Switch Position Battle.)

3382
02:29:27,607 --> 02:29:30,537
(Will he be able to maintain his rank of 8th place?)

3383
02:29:31,237 --> 02:29:32,547
Let's go, Sato.

3384
02:29:35,677 --> 02:29:40,347
(After facing reality as an experienced participant of 7 years, )

3385
02:29:40,647 --> 02:29:43,016
(Yoo Kang Min gave a sincere performance.)

3386
02:29:43,017 --> 02:29:45,387
(Will he take 8th place?)

3387
02:29:47,027 --> 02:29:49,326
Between participants Masato and Yoo Kang Min,

3388
02:29:49,327 --> 02:29:51,357
the person who will take the Top Eight seat is...

3389
02:29:54,367 --> 02:29:55,867
The person in the Top Eight is...

3390
02:29:56,537 --> 02:29:57,567
Who will it be?

3391
02:30:05,007 --> 02:30:06,147
Yoo Kang Min.

3392
02:30:07,447 --> 02:30:08,547
I'm in eighth place?

3393
02:30:09,177 --> 02:30:10,217
Congratulations.

3394
02:30:10,517 --> 02:30:11,517
He overtook him.

3395
02:30:11,977 --> 02:30:13,217
I'm so relieved.

3396
02:30:15,287 --> 02:30:19,157
Thank you so much for allowing me to come back...

3397
02:30:19,757 --> 02:30:22,227
to the Top Eight.

3398
02:30:22,797 --> 02:30:25,526
With the determination not to let the Star Creators down...

3399
02:30:25,527 --> 02:30:27,366
as they are cheering me on,

3400
02:30:27,367 --> 02:30:29,837
I will always work hard.

3401
02:30:29,867 --> 02:30:30,897
Thank you.

3402
02:30:31,897 --> 02:30:33,367
My brother is so cool.

3403
02:30:35,237 --> 02:30:37,206
I'm so grateful for the Star Creators...

3404
02:30:37,207 --> 02:30:41,577
who have always voted for me...

3405
02:30:41,647 --> 02:30:44,347
and my mom who is always cheering me on.

3406
02:30:44,417 --> 02:30:47,886
In the upcoming semi-finals,

3407
02:30:47,887 --> 02:30:50,756
I will perform with more confidence in myself.

3408
02:30:50,757 --> 02:30:51,837
Please look kindly upon me.

3409
02:30:53,157 --> 02:30:54,557
Cheer up, Sato!

3410
02:30:55,157 --> 02:30:57,097
- Congratulations. - Congratulations, Sato.

3411
02:30:57,827 --> 02:30:58,857
It's so high.

3412
02:30:58,997 --> 02:31:01,297
(Masato survives in 9th place.)

3413
02:31:01,427 --> 02:31:03,587
(Yoo Kang Min in 8th place goes up to the Top 8 seat.)

3414
02:31:06,007 --> 02:31:07,367
Go up even higher next time.

3415
02:31:07,637 --> 02:31:10,607
(Yoo Kang Min is the first to take his seat in the Top 8.)

3416
02:31:10,677 --> 02:31:11,707
I'm so relieved.

3417
02:31:13,247 --> 02:31:16,717
Next, I will announce the 7th place participant in the Top 8.

3418
02:31:17,477 --> 02:31:19,147
(7th place)

3419
02:31:19,547 --> 02:31:20,687
Seventh place.

3420
02:31:21,417 --> 02:31:22,417
Ching Yu?

3421
02:31:22,418 --> 02:31:23,516
(Hsu Ching Yu)

3422
02:31:23,517 --> 02:31:24,517
(Smiling)

3423
02:31:26,057 --> 02:31:28,156
The participant who came in at seventh place.

3424
02:31:28,157 --> 02:31:29,196
His birthday...

3425
02:31:29,197 --> 02:31:31,127
(Birthday?)

3426
02:31:31,257 --> 02:31:34,167
His birthday has the number 11 in it.

3427
02:31:34,327 --> 02:31:35,397
Eleven?

3428
02:31:35,527 --> 02:31:36,567
Who is it?

3429
02:31:36,767 --> 02:31:40,307
Which participant has the number 11 in his birthday?

3430
02:31:40,567 --> 02:31:43,007
(Who is it?)

3431
02:31:44,607 --> 02:31:45,676
My gosh.

3432
02:31:45,677 --> 02:31:48,007
How is this the same? How can this happen?

3433
02:31:48,247 --> 02:31:49,416
They even have this in common.

3434
02:31:49,417 --> 02:31:50,953
(Kim Geon Woo and He Xin Long sit side by side and raise their hands.)

3435
02:31:50,977 --> 02:31:52,817
Will it be Geon Woo or Xin Long?

3436
02:31:53,187 --> 02:31:54,187
Geon Star.

3437
02:31:54,188 --> 02:31:55,733
(Kim Geon Woo was born on April 11, 2003.)

3438
02:31:55,757 --> 02:31:56,886
It's He Xin Long.

3439
02:31:56,887 --> 02:31:58,527
(He Xin Long was born on March 11, 2005.)

3440
02:31:58,617 --> 02:31:59,657
Kim Geon Woo?

3441
02:32:00,027 --> 02:32:01,027
Xin Long?

3442
02:32:02,927 --> 02:32:04,597
- Oh, Jun Seo. - Jun Seo.

3443
02:32:04,697 --> 02:32:06,696
(Next to Kim Geon Woo and He Xin Long who raised their hands, )

3444
02:32:06,697 --> 02:32:08,443
(Kim Jun Seo is the third person to raise his hand.)

3445
02:32:08,467 --> 02:32:11,937
(Kim Jun Seo was born on November 20, 2001.)

3446
02:32:12,267 --> 02:32:13,407
Gosh, no way.

3447
02:32:13,707 --> 02:32:15,267
(Will Kim Jun Seo take 7th place?)

3448
02:32:15,637 --> 02:32:18,606
(Kim Jun Seo gave a sexy performance as the team leader...)

3449
02:32:18,607 --> 02:32:21,607
(and by singing the killing part for Team "Bad.")

3450
02:32:22,047 --> 02:32:23,717
Xin Long or Geon Woo?

3451
02:32:24,577 --> 02:32:28,847
(Kim Geon Woo and He Xin Long grew closer while practicing together.)

3452
02:32:29,857 --> 02:32:31,716
(Team "LALALALA" gave a strong performance...)

3453
02:32:31,717 --> 02:32:33,587
(as they transformed into wolves.)

3454
02:32:33,927 --> 02:32:36,827
(They took 1st place overall in the Class Switch Position Battle.)

3455
02:32:37,127 --> 02:32:38,257
Who will it be?

3456
02:32:39,467 --> 02:32:43,497
With a total of 6,011,169 points...

3457
02:32:43,767 --> 02:32:45,167
Over six million.

3458
02:32:45,807 --> 02:32:49,337
The lucky participant to take 7th place in the Top 8.

3459
02:32:49,837 --> 02:32:50,937
Who will it be?

3460
02:32:54,847 --> 02:32:56,077
In seventh place,

3461
02:33:03,557 --> 02:33:06,086
it's Kim Geon Woo.

3462
02:33:06,087 --> 02:33:08,757
(Top 8, 7th place, Kim Geon Woo)

3463
02:33:10,997 --> 02:33:12,697
Geon Woo rose up so much.

3464
02:33:13,267 --> 02:33:16,237
First, during the First Survivor Announcement,

3465
02:33:16,667 --> 02:33:19,836
I received the rank of 16th place.

3466
02:33:19,837 --> 02:33:22,366
I think I was really worried after that,

3467
02:33:22,367 --> 02:33:25,777
but I think this will become a reason for me to regain my strength.

3468
02:33:25,947 --> 02:33:30,617
Also, I want to say this to the Star Creators who are supporting me.

3469
02:33:30,717 --> 02:33:33,187
This time, I can sit on...

3470
02:33:33,917 --> 02:33:36,656
a better chair. A cushy chair.

3471
02:33:36,657 --> 02:33:38,893
(Thanks to the Star Creators, he gets a cushy 7th place chair.)

3472
02:33:38,917 --> 02:33:40,157
A better chair.

3473
02:33:40,887 --> 02:33:41,957
That's cute.

3474
02:33:42,427 --> 02:33:43,896
Thank you, my Star Creators.

3475
02:33:43,897 --> 02:33:44,997
Thank you. I love you.

3476
02:33:48,827 --> 02:33:49,897
Congratulations.

3477
02:33:56,607 --> 02:33:59,007
(Bouncing in his seat)

3478
02:33:59,177 --> 02:34:00,347
It's so soft.

3479
02:34:03,517 --> 02:34:05,817
Next, in 6th place of the Top 8.

3480
02:34:06,587 --> 02:34:08,687
- Gosh, it's 6th place. - It's 6th place.

3481
02:34:08,787 --> 02:34:09,787
Who will it be?

3482
02:34:09,788 --> 02:34:10,816
He Xin Long?

3483
02:34:10,817 --> 02:34:12,626
It's probably Xin Long or Jun Seo.

3484
02:34:12,627 --> 02:34:13,826
(9th place, He Xin Long, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3485
02:34:13,827 --> 02:34:15,026
(4th place, Kim Jun Seo, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3486
02:34:15,027 --> 02:34:16,927
The person who took sixth place...

3487
02:34:17,257 --> 02:34:18,873
On his team, this participant has personally ranked...

3488
02:34:18,897 --> 02:34:21,097
- First place? - first place before.

3489
02:34:23,297 --> 02:34:25,167
(An unspoken sign)

3490
02:34:26,037 --> 02:34:27,506
(Played an active part as the team leader of Team "Bad...")

3491
02:34:27,507 --> 02:34:30,027
(and sang the killing part in the Class Switch Position Battle)

3492
02:34:30,307 --> 02:34:32,477
(Kim Jun Seo came in 1st place within his team.)

3493
02:34:33,777 --> 02:34:35,207
Did Xin Long get first place too?

3494
02:34:35,747 --> 02:34:37,277
- Oh, you're right. - Yes.

3495
02:34:39,077 --> 02:34:40,287
Did you get first place?

3496
02:34:41,387 --> 02:34:42,417
On my team.

3497
02:34:43,717 --> 02:34:46,426
(He Xin Long sang the killing part and expressed...)

3498
02:34:46,427 --> 02:34:49,697
(a fierce wolf in the Class Switch Position Battle.)

3499
02:34:50,297 --> 02:34:54,697
(In the end, he took 1st place on Team "LALALALA.")

3500
02:34:55,367 --> 02:34:57,013
- Xin Long and me. - Xin Long? It's Xin Long.

3501
02:34:57,037 --> 02:34:58,167
Oh, you? Okay.

3502
02:34:58,967 --> 02:35:01,337
(Proving that he's a natural on stage, )

3503
02:35:02,137 --> 02:35:06,347
(Chung Sang Hyeon ranked 1st place on Team "Queencard.")

3504
02:35:06,647 --> 02:35:09,217
(6th place)

3505
02:35:09,277 --> 02:35:11,177
Also, in this mission,

3506
02:35:11,277 --> 02:35:13,046
more than four people formed a team...

3507
02:35:13,047 --> 02:35:14,887
- Then, it's not Jun Seo. - It's not Jun Seo.

3508
02:35:15,087 --> 02:35:17,207
(4th, Kim Jun Seo, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3509
02:35:17,487 --> 02:35:18,557
Is it Xin Long?

3510
02:35:19,487 --> 02:35:20,787
It's either me or Xin Long.

3511
02:35:22,157 --> 02:35:23,257
It must be Xin Long.

3512
02:35:23,797 --> 02:35:25,867
It could be Sang Hyeon too.

3513
02:35:26,067 --> 02:35:28,427
The person who took 6th place in the Top 8.

3514
02:35:29,197 --> 02:35:30,997
Please let me go up just one more step.

3515
02:35:32,707 --> 02:35:35,007
It's Chung Sang Hyeon.

3516
02:35:36,137 --> 02:35:37,237
Let's go.

3517
02:35:38,277 --> 02:35:39,977
Why did he drop so much?

3518
02:35:40,647 --> 02:35:43,917
(Top 8, 6th place, Chung Sang Hyeon)

3519
02:35:44,347 --> 02:35:45,547
It's Sang Hyeon.

3520
02:35:46,947 --> 02:35:48,486
Sang Hyeon seems flustered.

3521
02:35:48,487 --> 02:35:50,617
(Chung Sang Hyeon, 6th, 6,235,782 points)

3522
02:35:50,657 --> 02:35:54,227
First, I did drop from 3rd place to 6th,

3523
02:35:54,457 --> 02:35:55,956
but I will keep trying...

3524
02:35:55,957 --> 02:35:59,056
and do my best to go back up to that spot.

3525
02:35:59,057 --> 02:36:00,127
Thank you.

3526
02:36:00,767 --> 02:36:01,997
Good job, Sang Hyeon.

3527
02:36:02,867 --> 02:36:05,906
To all the Star Creators who voted and believed in me,

3528
02:36:05,907 --> 02:36:08,967
I'll work really hard to become someone truly worthy of your love.

3529
02:36:09,067 --> 02:36:10,107
Thank you.

3530
02:36:12,077 --> 02:36:13,447
He's good at English like me.

3531
02:36:14,247 --> 02:36:15,707
I think he's better than you.

3532
02:36:16,147 --> 02:36:17,217
Thank you.

3533
02:36:18,647 --> 02:36:20,617
The hip-hop cuddly cat.

3534
02:36:20,747 --> 02:36:22,447
(6th place)

3535
02:36:22,917 --> 02:36:25,557
But how far will Xin Long go up?

3536
02:36:26,057 --> 02:36:27,456
Xin Long is no joke.

3537
02:36:27,457 --> 02:36:29,533
(9th, He Xin Long, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3538
02:36:29,557 --> 02:36:31,457
I will continue with the announcements.

3539
02:36:32,097 --> 02:36:33,567
Which participant will take...

3540
02:36:33,697 --> 02:36:35,967
fifth place in the Top Eight?

3541
02:36:37,467 --> 02:36:38,997
Hang on. Fifth place?

3542
02:36:39,467 --> 02:36:40,937
Leo was in fifth place last time.

3543
02:36:42,137 --> 02:36:44,777
This participant who will take the fifth place spot...

3544
02:36:45,337 --> 02:36:47,407
In the Class Switch Position Battle,

3545
02:36:47,907 --> 02:36:50,447
he was in charge of the killing part.

3546
02:36:50,847 --> 02:36:51,877
Jun Seo?

3547
02:36:52,477 --> 02:36:53,517
Is it Jun Seo?

3548
02:36:54,147 --> 02:36:58,887
(Kim Jun Seo was in charge of the killing part on Team "Bad.")

3549
02:36:59,587 --> 02:37:00,727
Is it Xin Long?

3550
02:37:01,087 --> 02:37:02,157
Xin Long.

3551
02:37:03,357 --> 02:37:07,697
(He Xin Long performed the killing part on Team "LALALALA.")

3552
02:37:10,367 --> 02:37:12,267
Jun Seo. Xin Long.

3553
02:37:12,637 --> 02:37:14,437
- It could be you too. - Yes, it could be me.

3554
02:37:14,967 --> 02:37:16,007
Leo too.

3555
02:37:17,777 --> 02:37:20,606
(Lee Leo performed the killing part...)

3556
02:37:20,607 --> 02:37:23,147
(in Team "Queencard" of the vocal position.)

3557
02:37:24,917 --> 02:37:26,687
I really can't make predictions this time.

3558
02:37:26,987 --> 02:37:29,417
Also, during the performance for the last competition,

3559
02:37:29,787 --> 02:37:31,517
this participant crawled on the floor.

3560
02:37:31,787 --> 02:37:33,327
What? What did he do on the floor?

3561
02:37:33,727 --> 02:37:34,887
Did he crawl?

3562
02:37:35,727 --> 02:37:36,856
He Xin Long.

3563
02:37:36,857 --> 02:37:38,977
All Team "LALALALA" members crawled on the floor onc.

3564
02:37:39,257 --> 02:37:41,366
(Team "LALALALA" showed a dance move...)

3565
02:37:41,367 --> 02:37:43,467
(of crawling on the floor.)

3566
02:37:46,107 --> 02:37:47,937
Jun Seo.

3567
02:37:48,307 --> 02:37:50,077
Jun Seo crawled on the floor properly.

3568
02:37:50,537 --> 02:37:52,077
Did he practically mop the floor?

3569
02:37:52,377 --> 02:37:54,207
That's right. Jun Seo mopped the floor.

3570
02:37:55,707 --> 02:37:56,976
(During the performance of "Bad,")

3571
02:37:56,977 --> 02:38:00,887
(Kim Jun Seo crawled on the floor while doing a dance move.)

3572
02:38:03,517 --> 02:38:04,617
Who is it?

3573
02:38:04,987 --> 02:38:08,557
With a score of 6,746,629 points...

3574
02:38:09,027 --> 02:38:11,107
Seriously, there isn't a big gap between the scores.

3575
02:38:11,357 --> 02:38:13,496
This participant will survive and perform...

3576
02:38:13,497 --> 02:38:15,397
before the Star Creators once more.

3577
02:38:15,967 --> 02:38:17,437
In fifth place is...

3578
02:38:17,697 --> 02:38:19,907
(9th place, He Xin Long, 4th place, Kim Jun Seo)

3579
02:38:20,537 --> 02:38:22,567
Kim Jun Seo.

3580
02:38:22,837 --> 02:38:25,507
(Top 8, 5th place, Kim Jun Seo)

3581
02:38:26,447 --> 02:38:28,347
You did a great job.

3582
02:38:30,047 --> 02:38:31,077
Thank you.

3583
02:38:32,117 --> 02:38:33,287
Jun Seo, congratulations.

3584
02:38:33,947 --> 02:38:35,647
Xin Long's ranking is so high.

3585
02:38:36,117 --> 02:38:38,056
How far will Xin Long go up?

3586
02:38:38,057 --> 02:38:39,116
(He Xin Long's name hasn't been called yet.)

3587
02:38:39,117 --> 02:38:41,187
I can't believe it.

3588
02:38:42,327 --> 02:38:45,926
I sincerely thank the Star Creators...

3589
02:38:45,927 --> 02:38:49,937
who gave me a very high ranking.

3590
02:38:50,437 --> 02:38:52,267
I continue to feel...

3591
02:38:52,637 --> 02:38:55,637
that I'm a lacking person who needs to grow further.

3592
02:38:56,177 --> 02:38:59,307
I'll only show a good side of me in the remaining time.

3593
02:38:59,747 --> 02:39:00,907
I'll work hard.

3594
02:39:03,647 --> 02:39:06,587
You're sitting in that seat because you deserve it.

3595
02:39:12,217 --> 02:39:16,257
I'll now announce the participant in 4th place among the Top 8.

3596
02:39:16,957 --> 02:39:18,397
Which participants remain?

3597
02:39:18,757 --> 02:39:19,997
Xin Long, An Xin,

3598
02:39:20,667 --> 02:39:21,827
Sang Won, and Leo.

3599
02:39:22,967 --> 02:39:24,637
The participant in fourth place...

3600
02:39:25,097 --> 02:39:28,937
moved up the ranking compared to the last Survivor Announcement.

3601
02:39:29,907 --> 02:39:31,407
Leo and Xin Long.

3602
02:39:32,337 --> 02:39:33,407
Xin Long.

3603
02:39:34,677 --> 02:39:36,007
Leo was in fifth place.

3604
02:39:37,277 --> 02:39:40,147
And on BOYS II PLANET, this participant gained...

3605
02:39:40,587 --> 02:39:42,687
a cute younger brother.

3606
02:39:43,217 --> 02:39:44,517
What? It's Xin Long.

3607
02:39:45,217 --> 02:39:46,357
It's Xin Long.

3608
02:39:46,727 --> 02:39:47,987
Good.

3609
02:39:48,057 --> 02:39:49,286
(On BOYS II PLANET, )

3610
02:39:49,287 --> 02:39:51,527
(He Xin Long gained a cute younger brother, Na Yun Seo.)

3611
02:39:51,897 --> 02:39:53,067
It's Yun Seo.

3612
02:39:53,697 --> 02:39:55,367
I don't know if Yun Seo is cute.

3613
02:39:55,527 --> 02:39:56,566
(Joking)

3614
02:39:56,567 --> 02:39:57,636
I'm not cute.

3615
02:39:57,637 --> 02:39:58,973
(He suddenly cracks his knuckles.)

3616
02:39:58,997 --> 02:40:00,237
I'm a cool younger brother.

3617
02:40:00,437 --> 02:40:01,737
I guess it isn't Xin Long.

3618
02:40:02,407 --> 02:40:04,477
Leo also gained cute younger brothers.

3619
02:40:05,037 --> 02:40:06,177
Is it Leo?

3620
02:40:07,807 --> 02:40:09,646
(Through the "Queencard" performance, )

3621
02:40:09,647 --> 02:40:13,087
(Lee Leo gained cute younger brothers.)

3622
02:40:13,517 --> 02:40:14,747
I think it's Leo.

3623
02:40:15,587 --> 02:40:18,787
With a score of 7,106,072 points...

3624
02:40:19,687 --> 02:40:20,857
It's really high.

3625
02:40:21,487 --> 02:40:23,296
- Did he say 7 million? - He said 7.1 million.

3626
02:40:23,297 --> 02:40:24,427
Did he say 7.1 million?

3627
02:40:25,327 --> 02:40:26,597
The number suddenly went up.

3628
02:40:27,427 --> 02:40:28,967
The participant in fourth place is...

3629
02:40:29,497 --> 02:40:32,197
(9th place, He Xin Long 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3630
02:40:33,337 --> 02:40:35,137
He Xin Long. Congratulations.

3631
02:40:35,267 --> 02:40:39,977
(Top 8, 4th place, He Xin Long)

3632
02:40:40,207 --> 02:40:41,307
My goodness.

3633
02:40:42,547 --> 02:40:43,577
It's nice.

3634
02:40:46,487 --> 02:40:49,017
Xin Long's ranking moved up so much.

3635
02:40:49,617 --> 02:40:50,956
(From 9th to 4th, he moved up 5 places.)

3636
02:40:50,957 --> 02:40:53,187
- Impressive. - Congratulations.

3637
02:40:53,557 --> 02:40:54,727
That's incredible.

3638
02:40:56,327 --> 02:40:57,847
Xin Long made a legendary achievement.

3639
02:40:58,327 --> 02:41:00,327
How are you feeling right now?

3640
02:41:00,567 --> 02:41:03,197
(4th place, He Xin Long, 7,106,072 points)

3641
02:41:04,437 --> 02:41:05,996
(Xin Long suddenly dances...)

3642
02:41:05,997 --> 02:41:09,007
(to "Ice On My Teeth" by ATEEZ.)

3643
02:41:13,307 --> 02:41:15,577
I totally want to dance right now.

3644
02:41:15,907 --> 02:41:17,247
- Is that so? - Yes.

3645
02:41:17,917 --> 02:41:19,917
(Going overboard)

3646
02:41:20,617 --> 02:41:22,717
(Laughing)

3647
02:41:22,787 --> 02:41:24,657
(Singing gibberish)

3648
02:41:25,387 --> 02:41:28,557
My legs are weak.

3649
02:41:29,057 --> 02:41:31,427
He must be so happy. Oh, my.

3650
02:41:32,027 --> 02:41:33,396
(4th place)

3651
02:41:33,397 --> 02:41:36,437
Firstly, I'm always thankful.

3652
02:41:36,767 --> 02:41:40,267
I want to show a better side of me.

3653
02:41:41,007 --> 02:41:43,407
I wouldn't be here without the fans.

3654
02:41:43,577 --> 02:41:45,876
Let's protect each other and move forward...

3655
02:41:45,877 --> 02:41:48,177
in the upcoming journey.

3656
02:41:48,847 --> 02:41:50,077
I love you guys. Thank you.

3657
02:41:54,047 --> 02:41:58,917
(He Xin Long heads over to his seat.)

3658
02:41:59,117 --> 02:42:01,387
Xin Long doesn't know failures.

3659
02:42:02,857 --> 02:42:04,527
The wolf king, Xin Long.

3660
02:42:07,167 --> 02:42:08,466
(Second Survivor Announcement)

3661
02:42:08,467 --> 02:42:11,467
Now, among the Top Eight of BOYS II PLANET,

3662
02:42:11,667 --> 02:42:13,406
I'll announce the participants of the highest rankings,

3663
02:42:13,407 --> 02:42:15,766
- the top three. - Oh, my.

3664
02:42:15,767 --> 02:42:17,106
(5th place, Lee Leo, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3665
02:42:17,107 --> 02:42:18,977
- Is it Leo? - Gosh, Leo.

3666
02:42:19,377 --> 02:42:21,347
Trainee A with An Xin.

3667
02:42:21,547 --> 02:42:23,523
(1st, Lee Sang Won, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3668
02:42:23,547 --> 02:42:26,416
(Planet Top 8, 1st place candidates)

3669
02:42:26,417 --> 02:42:27,686
Lee Leo must be nervous.

3670
02:42:27,687 --> 02:42:30,257
- It says, "First place candidate." - Let's go, Leo.

3671
02:42:30,717 --> 02:42:31,757
How about Leo?

3672
02:42:31,917 --> 02:42:33,886
Of course, he's in there. It's those three.

3673
02:42:33,887 --> 02:42:35,487
We practically have all the results now.

3674
02:42:36,927 --> 02:42:38,427
Did the second place change?

3675
02:42:39,297 --> 02:42:42,197
(1st, Lee Sang Won, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3676
02:42:42,327 --> 02:42:43,866
The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places are incredible.

3677
02:42:43,867 --> 02:42:45,467
In the Second Survivor Announcement,

3678
02:42:45,567 --> 02:42:48,537
who will have the honor of taking the first place seat?

3679
02:42:49,307 --> 02:42:50,437
Who will it be?

3680
02:42:51,207 --> 02:42:53,477
I'll announce the 3 1st place candidates.

3681
02:42:54,247 --> 02:42:55,777
I want to be included in the trio.

3682
02:42:56,207 --> 02:42:57,846
- Who will they be? - Three parts.

3683
02:42:57,847 --> 02:42:59,477
(Planet Top 8, 1st place candidates)

3684
02:42:59,577 --> 02:43:01,847
(The 1st place candidates at the top 3 are revealed.)

3685
02:43:03,987 --> 02:43:05,587
Sang Won, Leo, and An Xin.

3686
02:43:05,757 --> 02:43:06,826
Sang, Le, and An.

3687
02:43:06,827 --> 02:43:09,157
The three of them are perfect.

3688
02:43:09,657 --> 02:43:11,827
Lee Leo can't hide his smile.

3689
02:43:13,027 --> 02:43:14,426
They're the first place candidates.

3690
02:43:14,427 --> 02:43:15,867
- How cute. - Lee Sang Won,

3691
02:43:16,267 --> 02:43:17,637
Lee Leo,

3692
02:43:18,067 --> 02:43:19,437
and Zhou An Xin.

3693
02:43:19,707 --> 02:43:21,767
The three participants, please come forward.

3694
02:43:22,537 --> 02:43:23,607
This is incredible.

3695
02:43:24,777 --> 02:43:27,076
(The top 3 move to the podium.)

3696
02:43:27,077 --> 02:43:28,077
They're so charismatic.

3697
02:43:29,607 --> 02:43:31,716
In this Survivor Announcement,

3698
02:43:31,717 --> 02:43:33,593
will we see a participant with ten million points?

3699
02:43:33,617 --> 02:43:34,617
Seriously.

3700
02:43:34,618 --> 02:43:36,387
Will Sang Won get ten million points?

3701
02:43:37,487 --> 02:43:39,156
I'm curious about Sang Won's score.

3702
02:43:39,157 --> 02:43:40,157
I know.

3703
02:43:42,387 --> 02:43:43,457
They're cool.

3704
02:43:44,097 --> 02:43:45,537
I'm curious about all three of them.

3705
02:43:45,597 --> 02:43:46,897
Leo has moved up a lot.

3706
02:43:47,197 --> 02:43:49,366
Unlike the First Survivor Announcement,

3707
02:43:49,367 --> 02:43:51,737
we have a new first place candidate.

3708
02:43:52,067 --> 02:43:53,507
It's Leo's first time.

3709
02:43:53,707 --> 02:43:55,136
The participant who became a first place candidate...

3710
02:43:55,137 --> 02:43:56,507
for the first time, Lee Leo.

3711
02:43:56,777 --> 02:43:58,377
It's a cause for celebration.

3712
02:43:58,707 --> 02:44:01,346
It must feel strange to become a first place candidate...

3713
02:44:01,347 --> 02:44:04,817
alongside the younger brother you dote on, Lee Sang Won.

3714
02:44:06,587 --> 02:44:09,447
Yes. I never imagined becoming...

3715
02:44:09,687 --> 02:44:11,916
a first place candidate...

3716
02:44:11,917 --> 02:44:14,527
alongside the younger brother I dote on, Sang Won.

3717
02:44:14,787 --> 02:44:17,997
Still, standing here with him fills me with emotions.

3718
02:44:18,197 --> 02:44:20,127
It feels really great. Thank you.

3719
02:44:26,607 --> 02:44:28,637
Okay. Zhou An Xin.

3720
02:44:29,137 --> 02:44:31,807
You became a first place candidate today as well.

3721
02:44:32,277 --> 02:44:36,477
Are you hoping to take first place this time?

3722
02:44:36,817 --> 02:44:38,317
- Of course. - Of course.

3723
02:44:41,917 --> 02:44:42,947
Yes.

3724
02:44:43,287 --> 02:44:46,057
I want to take first place.

3725
02:44:48,457 --> 02:44:50,426
There you go. Yes.

3726
02:44:50,427 --> 02:44:51,467
- Zhou An Xin. - Let's go.

3727
02:44:52,057 --> 02:44:53,127
You're cool.

3728
02:44:53,327 --> 02:44:54,467
He should hope for it.

3729
02:44:54,897 --> 02:44:55,966
Now,

3730
02:44:55,967 --> 02:44:59,237
I'll announce the rankings of the 3 1st place candidates.

3731
02:45:00,137 --> 02:45:03,707
First comes the participant who came in third place by the results...

3732
02:45:04,177 --> 02:45:06,377
of the Star Creators' global voting.

3733
02:45:07,007 --> 02:45:08,877
This participant will be revealed first.

3734
02:45:09,577 --> 02:45:11,277
Who is that? Who?

3735
02:45:11,377 --> 02:45:12,777
What if An Xin came in third place?

3736
02:45:12,877 --> 02:45:14,993
(2nd place, Zhou An Xin, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3737
02:45:15,017 --> 02:45:16,697
The participant who came in third place...

3738
02:45:16,957 --> 02:45:21,387
ranked 1st in terms of votes in 133 regions.

3739
02:45:21,457 --> 02:45:22,457
First?

3740
02:45:22,458 --> 02:45:23,496
- He received... - Did he say 133?

3741
02:45:23,497 --> 02:45:26,426
A high score...

3742
02:45:26,427 --> 02:45:28,627
- of 7,935,026 points... - It's close to 8 million.

3743
02:45:28,767 --> 02:45:30,536
And came in third place.

3744
02:45:30,537 --> 02:45:31,567
Third place?

3745
02:45:31,837 --> 02:45:32,967
That's insane.

3746
02:45:33,207 --> 02:45:34,537
He received so many votes.

3747
02:45:34,937 --> 02:45:38,277
Who is the participant who came in third place...

3748
02:45:38,707 --> 02:45:41,106
through the results of the fierce global voting?

3749
02:45:41,107 --> 02:45:43,446
(2nd place, Zhou An Xin, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3750
02:45:43,447 --> 02:45:46,347
(1st place, Lee Sang Won, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3751
02:45:46,617 --> 02:45:47,947
I think it's Leo.

3752
02:45:48,587 --> 02:45:49,957
Could it be An Xin?

3753
02:45:50,357 --> 02:45:51,957
I think it might be An Xin.

3754
02:45:53,087 --> 02:45:54,186
(Who will be in 3rd place?)

3755
02:45:54,187 --> 02:45:55,257
I'm curious.

3756
02:45:56,287 --> 02:45:58,197
It's Lee Leo.

3757
02:46:03,337 --> 02:46:04,597
Leo is cool.

3758
02:46:05,267 --> 02:46:06,366
(3rd place, Lee Leo, 7,935,026 points)

3759
02:46:06,367 --> 02:46:07,807
Okay. Firstly,

3760
02:46:08,637 --> 02:46:10,477
I sincerely thank...

3761
02:46:11,207 --> 02:46:14,006
the Star Creators for putting me...

3762
02:46:14,007 --> 02:46:16,617
in the unbelievably high ranking of third place.

3763
02:46:17,647 --> 02:46:18,947
So that I won't let you down,

3764
02:46:19,217 --> 02:46:21,717
I'll do my best during the remaining time.

3765
02:46:21,847 --> 02:46:24,117
And also to the global Star Creators,

3766
02:46:25,057 --> 02:46:26,817
I just want to say that I'm really grateful.

3767
02:46:27,027 --> 02:46:30,857
I can't stress enough how grateful I am to you guys.

3768
02:46:31,127 --> 02:46:34,067
I'll do my best every day to make you guys proud.

3769
02:46:34,427 --> 02:46:35,467
I love you guys.

3770
02:46:37,667 --> 02:46:39,497
Please move to your seat.

3771
02:46:46,037 --> 02:46:48,777
(3rd place)

3772
02:46:49,747 --> 02:46:50,777
Thank you.

3773
02:46:59,087 --> 02:47:02,486
Now, I'll reveal the participant who will take the first place...

3774
02:47:02,487 --> 02:47:06,097
in the Second Survivor Announcement of BOYS II PLANET.

3775
02:47:06,257 --> 02:47:07,266
My goodness.

3776
02:47:07,267 --> 02:47:09,867
It's a match between An Xin and Sang Won again.

3777
02:47:10,537 --> 02:47:11,837
It's a battle again.

3778
02:47:12,137 --> 02:47:13,883
As for the participant who took second place,

3779
02:47:13,907 --> 02:47:16,707
the first number of his score changed twice this time.

3780
02:47:17,107 --> 02:47:20,477
With a score of 9,878,363.

3781
02:47:20,747 --> 02:47:21,906
Gosh, that's insane.

3782
02:47:21,907 --> 02:47:25,376
And the participant in 1st place was the only person among the 48...

3783
02:47:25,377 --> 02:47:27,087
to get more than ten million points.

3784
02:47:28,017 --> 02:47:30,616
A total of 12 million...

3785
02:47:30,617 --> 02:47:32,917
- and 617,136 points. - He said 12 million.

3786
02:47:33,357 --> 02:47:35,956
- Did he say 12 million? - With that overwhelming score,

3787
02:47:35,957 --> 02:47:38,097
this person took first place.

3788
02:47:38,197 --> 02:47:39,427
You can't catch up to that.

3789
02:47:40,097 --> 02:47:42,217
If it's 12 million, will it be the same as last time?

3790
02:47:42,427 --> 02:47:44,196
- Gosh, this is unbelievable. - It was 1st and 2nd combined.

3791
02:47:44,197 --> 02:47:45,336
This time, it's just the third vote.

3792
02:47:45,337 --> 02:47:47,567
Between participants Zhou An Xin and Lee Sang Won,

3793
02:47:48,037 --> 02:47:50,637
who will shine in the 1st place seat...

3794
02:47:51,237 --> 02:47:54,107
of the Top 8 in the 2nd Survivor Announcement?

3795
02:47:55,147 --> 02:47:56,147
This is insane.

3796
02:47:56,447 --> 02:47:57,647
Is it An Xin?

3797
02:47:57,947 --> 02:48:00,416
This is Sang Won. It has to be Sang Won after that.

3798
02:48:00,417 --> 02:48:02,147
Whoever gets first place deserves it.

3799
02:48:04,987 --> 02:48:06,556
I'll reveal the first place participant...

3800
02:48:06,557 --> 02:48:08,127
who will rise to the top.

3801
02:48:08,927 --> 02:48:10,457
I've seen this image before.

3802
02:48:11,357 --> 02:48:13,837
(The 2 participants were candidates for 1st place before too.)

3803
02:48:15,197 --> 02:48:16,497
Who's first?

3804
02:48:19,497 --> 02:48:21,507
The person in first place is...

3805
02:48:24,707 --> 02:48:25,737
Who could it be?

3806
02:48:30,047 --> 02:48:31,816
It's Lee Sang Won. Congratulations.

3807
02:48:31,817 --> 02:48:32,976
(Top 8, 2nd place, Zhou An Xin, Top 8, 1st place, Lee Sang Won)

3808
02:48:32,977 --> 02:48:34,846
The first place never changes.

3809
02:48:34,847 --> 02:48:36,967
Gosh, he really is the unchanging first place winner.

3810
02:48:39,887 --> 02:48:41,827
Change your name to Lee Sang One.

3811
02:48:41,927 --> 02:48:43,757
- Lee Sang One. - Lee Sang One.

3812
02:48:43,857 --> 02:48:45,557
Twelve million points? That's incredible.

3813
02:48:46,767 --> 02:48:48,567
Actually, first off,

3814
02:48:50,267 --> 02:48:53,466
I've come to receive so much attention,

3815
02:48:53,467 --> 02:48:57,107
deep affection, and deep love from many people.

3816
02:48:57,837 --> 02:49:00,207
I think I've spent the past few weeks...

3817
02:49:00,307 --> 02:49:02,607
wondering if this is really true.

3818
02:49:02,707 --> 02:49:05,246
I know that each of these moments...

3819
02:49:05,247 --> 02:49:08,587
are so special and precious.

3820
02:49:08,887 --> 02:49:12,187
I've concluded that I should believe in those...

3821
02:49:12,987 --> 02:49:14,887
who cherish me.

3822
02:49:15,687 --> 02:49:18,257
And I want to promise that I will show everyone...

3823
02:49:18,357 --> 02:49:21,927
my best performances until the very end.

3824
02:49:22,867 --> 02:49:24,537
Thank you, truly.

3825
02:49:27,037 --> 02:49:28,037
I love you.

3826
02:49:31,107 --> 02:49:32,806
Actually, this time...

3827
02:49:32,807 --> 02:49:34,846
(Zhou An Xin, 2nd place, 9,878,363 points)

3828
02:49:34,847 --> 02:49:38,717
I was really anxious, and I worried a lot too.

3829
02:49:38,817 --> 02:49:41,917
But when I look at this ranking now,

3830
02:49:42,017 --> 02:49:45,717
I'm just so grateful to the Star Creators.

3831
02:49:46,117 --> 02:49:49,127
I will continue to be thankful...

3832
02:49:49,227 --> 02:49:53,427
and never forget it.

3833
02:49:53,697 --> 02:49:55,673
I will try harder to show you an even better version of myself.

3834
02:49:55,697 --> 02:49:59,196
Also, I will become a more perfect person.

3835
02:49:59,197 --> 02:50:00,207
Thank you.

3836
02:50:03,437 --> 02:50:06,777
Please move to your seats.

3837
02:50:16,857 --> 02:50:17,887
Thank you.

3838
02:50:25,697 --> 02:50:30,367
(And Lee Sang Won goes up to the 1st place seat.)

3839
02:50:33,097 --> 02:50:36,337
Sang Won is bearing the weight of the crown today as well.

3840
02:50:42,977 --> 02:50:45,117
It's so high up. It's such a long walk.

3841
02:50:46,477 --> 02:50:48,147
- Thank you. - That's awesome.

3842
02:50:52,417 --> 02:50:56,656
(Second Survivor Announcement, Top 8, 1st place, Lee Sang Won)

3843
02:50:56,657 --> 02:50:58,827
- It just feels like his seat. - I know.

3844
02:51:01,127 --> 02:51:03,736
The seats from 1st to 9th place have been filled.

3845
02:51:03,737 --> 02:51:06,697
Except for 24th place, for which the candidates have been revealed,

3846
02:51:06,907 --> 02:51:08,807
only one rank remains.

3847
02:51:09,937 --> 02:51:11,507
It's the 23rd place.

3848
02:51:13,207 --> 02:51:16,917
Now, I will reveal the person who took 23rd place.

3849
02:51:17,017 --> 02:51:19,717
- Who could it be? - Who is it? Gosh, seriously.

3850
02:51:21,047 --> 02:51:24,186
- Jae Hyun, let's go. - It's not me.

3851
02:51:24,187 --> 02:51:25,717
In Hu.

3852
02:51:26,287 --> 02:51:28,687
- There's Xie Su Ren too. - Xie Su Ren.

3853
02:51:28,857 --> 02:51:29,927

3854
02:51:30,997 --> 02:51:33,927
(40th place, Jo Gye Hyeon, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3855

Zhong Xing.

3856
02:51:35,227 --> 02:51:36,396
(36th place, He Zhong Xing, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3857
02:51:36,397 --> 02:51:37,466
Jia Yang.

3858
02:51:37,467 --> 02:51:39,673
(15th place, Sun Jia Yang, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3859
02:51:39,697 --> 02:51:41,337
The participant in 23rd place...

3860
02:51:41,667 --> 02:51:44,236
In the second mission, he received a personal benefit.

3861
02:51:44,237 --> 02:51:45,337
He did?

3862
02:51:46,437 --> 02:51:49,106
(The person who took 23rd place either went up to All Star...)

3863
02:51:49,107 --> 02:51:51,747
(or maintained his All Star Class.)

3864
02:51:52,317 --> 02:51:55,016
- Jae Hyun. Please. - It's Jae Hyun.

3865
02:51:55,017 --> 02:51:57,987
(36th place, He Zhong Xing, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3866
02:51:58,357 --> 02:51:59,586
Is it Gye Hyeon?

3867
02:51:59,587 --> 02:52:01,107
(Jo Gye Hyeon, 1,330 points, All Star)

3868
02:52:03,957 --> 02:52:05,056
Hu Han Wen.

3869
02:52:05,057 --> 02:52:07,203
He got the benefit because he went up from 2 Star to All Star.

3870
02:52:07,227 --> 02:52:09,166
(Kim In Hu, 1,150 points, All Star)

3871
02:52:09,167 --> 02:52:11,237
(Arctic, 1,240 points, All Star)

3872
02:52:11,437 --> 02:52:13,706
As a result of the global voting, the surviving...

3873
02:52:13,707 --> 02:52:16,337
participant in 23rd place will be revealed.

3874
02:52:16,537 --> 02:52:17,937
- Gosh, no way. - My goodness.

3875
02:52:22,677 --> 02:52:25,677
As a result of the global voting of the Second Survivor Announcement,

3876
02:52:25,777 --> 02:52:28,917
the participant who dramatically survived at 23rd place is...

3877
02:52:30,017 --> 02:52:31,787
- Who is it? - Who could it be?

3878
02:52:33,557 --> 02:52:34,557
Who is it?

3879
02:52:35,887 --> 02:52:38,096
- Jae Hyun? - I think it's Jae Hyun.

3880
02:52:38,097 --> 02:52:40,967
(To be continued)

3881
02:52:41,097 --> 02:52:43,996
As a result of the global voting of the Second Survivor Announcement,

3882
02:52:43,997 --> 02:52:47,237
the participant who dramatically survived at 23rd place is...

3883
02:52:48,267 --> 02:52:50,037
- Who is it? - Who could it be?

3884
02:52:51,837 --> 02:52:52,907
Who is it?

3885
02:52:54,347 --> 02:52:56,247
- Jae Hyun? - I think it's Jae Hyun.

3886
02:52:56,877 --> 02:53:00,986
It's Hu Han Wen.

3887
02:53:00,987 --> 02:53:06,316
(Hu Han Wen survives in 23rd place.)

3888
02:53:06,317 --> 02:53:08,626
- So dramatic! - It's so dramatic!

3889
02:53:08,627 --> 02:53:09,857
I never even imagined.

3890
02:53:12,497 --> 02:53:15,666
Participant Hu Han Wen would've been up for elimination...

3891
02:53:15,667 --> 02:53:17,067
had he not gotten the benefit.

3892
02:53:17,767 --> 02:53:20,366
This reminds me just how precious benefits really are.

3893
02:53:20,367 --> 02:53:22,336
Congratulations on your survival.

3894
02:53:22,337 --> 02:53:23,936

3896
02:53:25,577 --> 02:53:28,447
Participant Hu Han Wen, please tell us how you feel.

3897
02:53:32,617 --> 02:53:35,917
Actually, today,

3898
02:53:36,317 --> 02:53:38,517
I didn't prepare an acceptance speech.

3899
02:53:38,617 --> 02:53:43,357
That's because I didn't think I'd be able to survive.

3900
02:53:51,237 --> 02:53:53,336
- Don't cry. - Why are you crying?

3901
02:53:53,337 --> 02:53:54,467
Why are you crying?

3902
02:53:57,307 --> 02:53:58,407
It's okay.

3903
02:53:58,507 --> 02:54:03,147
Because everyone deserves to stay here more than I do.

3904
02:54:03,817 --> 02:54:06,217
If I don't have...

3905
02:54:07,947 --> 02:54:11,356
those of you who came here with me from PLANET C,

3906
02:54:11,357 --> 02:54:13,757
I honestly don't know what I'd do here.

3907
02:54:15,827 --> 02:54:19,957
I'm so grateful to have met so many new friends here.

3908
02:54:20,057 --> 02:54:24,867
To the Star Creators who allowed me to survive this long,

3909
02:54:25,267 --> 02:54:27,537
thank you so much.

3910
02:54:30,837 --> 02:54:32,137
You're the best!

3911
02:54:35,607 --> 02:54:39,147

3913
02:54:41,217 --> 02:54:44,317
Now, it's time to announce the last survivor.

3914
02:54:44,917 --> 02:54:50,496
(Last Survivor, 24th place)

3915
02:54:50,497 --> 02:54:52,127
This is what I've been waiting for.

3916
02:54:55,067 --> 02:54:58,996
Only 1 of the 3 candidates for 24th place...

3917
02:54:58,997 --> 02:55:01,767
will be able to stay at BOYS II PLANET.

3918
02:55:06,707 --> 02:55:08,747
This is the cruelest part.

3919
02:55:10,717 --> 02:55:13,946
I will reveal the participant who must leave BOYS II PLANET...

3920
02:55:13,947 --> 02:55:15,017
at 26th place.

3921
02:55:17,517 --> 02:55:19,717
This part. I seriously can't watch this part.

3922

(29th place, Park Dong Gyu, 1st Survivor Announcement Ranking)

3923
02:55:23,257 --> 02:55:24,857
This is so hard.

3924
02:55:26,197 --> 02:55:28,027
The participant in 26th place is...

3925
02:55:31,167 --> 02:55:32,497
Han Harry June.

3926
02:55:33,367 --> 02:55:36,667
(26th place, Han Harry June)

3927
02:55:36,837 --> 02:55:38,277
Han Harry June.

3928
02:55:40,907 --> 02:55:41,947
You did well.

3929
02:55:42,147 --> 02:55:44,477
Gosh, you've been through so much, DKB's...

3930
02:55:45,647 --> 02:55:46,717
Harry June.

3931
02:55:49,987 --> 02:55:53,287
Seriously, thanks to Team "like JENNIE,"

3932
02:55:54,987 --> 02:55:58,396
I was able to create such a beautiful,

3933
02:55:58,397 --> 02:56:01,397
cool, and great performance.

3934
02:56:01,827 --> 02:56:04,497
I want to say that I'm so grateful.

3936
02:56:14,647 --> 02:56:16,307
Well done, really.

3937
02:56:17,277 --> 02:56:19,176
Out of the two remaining participants,

3938
02:56:19,177 --> 02:56:21,316
one will remain in BOYS II PLANET,

3939
02:56:21,317 --> 02:56:23,747
and the other will leave.

3940
02:56:24,417 --> 02:56:27,257

3941
02:56:28,257 --> 02:56:30,356

Dong Gyu.

3952
02:56:54,747 --> 02:56:57,156
Will it be Fan Zhe Yi who showed us a new charm...

3953
02:56:57,157 --> 02:56:59,216
through "LALALALA..."

3954
02:56:59,217 --> 02:57:02,157
in the team that won the Class Switch Position Battle?

3955
02:57:02,657 --> 02:57:03,687
Or...

3956
02:57:05,227 --> 02:57:06,997
will it be Park Dong Gyu...

3957
02:57:07,367 --> 02:57:09,966
who created the choreography...

3958
02:57:09,967 --> 02:57:13,097

3973
02:58:20,937 --> 02:58:22,307
You survived.

Fan Zhe Yi...

3975
02:58:29,277 --> 02:58:30,946
He wasn't even a candidate...

3976
02:58:30,947 --> 02:58:33,877
for the final survivor just ten hours ago.

3977
02:58:34,617 --> 02:58:36,516
His ranking rose after the show aired,

3978
02:58:36,517 --> 02:58:39,916
and he survived a dramatic survival.

3979
02:58:39,917 --> 02:58:40,987
Congratulations.

02:58:45,627 --> 02:58:47,296
(24th place, Park Dong Gyu, 2,680,058 points)

3981
02:58:47,297 --> 02:58:50,397
I'm holding my tears because of this person.

3982
02:58:53,497 --> 02:58:55,436
As a roommate,

3983
02:58:55,437 --> 02:58:57,577
whenever we had worries or struggles,

3984
02:58:58,337 --> 02:58:59,437
we would...

3985
02:59:07,387 --> 02:59:08,387
So...

3986
02:59:08,887 --> 02:59:10,287
We would talk a lot.

3987
02:59:26,967 --> 02:59:28,937
I've been having some worries lately.

3988
02:59:30,107 --> 02:59:32,707
I'm not particularly outstanding in anything.

3989
02:59:33,307 --> 02:59:35,277
You're really handsome.

3990
02:59:35,747 --> 02:59:37,977
You rap well and you sing well.

3991
02:59:38,477 --> 02:59:40,397
There were many participants who performed well.

3992
02:59:40,577 --> 02:59:42,016
What does that matter?

3993
02:59:42,017 --> 02:59:45,857
As the years go by, my self-esteem keeps dropping.

3994
02:59:46,217 --> 02:59:47,257
You can still do it.

3995
02:59:47,557 --> 02:59:50,387
(Han Harry June listened to Park Dong Gyu's worries.)

3996
02:59:50,757 --> 02:59:51,797
So...

3997
02:59:53,457 --> 02:59:56,497
when I had a hard time while preparing the performance,

3998
02:59:57,697 --> 03:00:00,037
he kept giving me confidence...

3999
03:00:01,267 --> 03:00:04,937
and lifted me up a lot. So I want to thank him.

4000
03:00:10,977 --> 03:00:12,547
- Let's go! - Let's go!

4001
03:00:15,187 --> 03:00:16,287
That's cool!

4002
03:00:18,787 --> 03:00:23,287
(Each other's presence gave them great strength.)

4003
03:00:23,557 --> 03:00:25,326
You have to debut. Okay?

4004
03:00:25,327 --> 03:00:26,556
I'll really do my best.

4005
03:00:26,557 --> 03:00:27,567
Don't get scared.

4006
03:00:31,767 --> 03:00:32,867
You worked hard!

4007
03:00:34,037 --> 03:00:35,836
- You're awesome, Dong Gyu. - Congratulations, Dong Gyu.

4008
03:00:35,837 --> 03:00:37,007

Fan Zhe Yi in 25th place...

4011
03:00:50,547 --> 03:00:53,557
will unfortunately be leaving BOYS II PLANET.

4012
03:00:54,627 --> 03:00:59,657
Thank you so much, Star Creators.

4013
03:01:00,557 --> 03:01:04,267
I'll work even harder from now on.

4014
03:01:04,667 --> 03:01:06,037
Please look forward to that.

4015
03:01:10,937 --> 03:01:12,706
This really isn't the end.

4016
03:01:12,707 --> 03:01:15,147

after the third global voting.

4021

there are participants who will leave BOYS II PLANET.

4040
03:02:10,167 --> 03:02:12,367
Today is just one of the countless processes.

4041
03:02:12,797 --> 03:02:14,636
I believe you have stepped a step closer...

4042
03:02:14,637 --> 03:02:18,537

4043

4049
03:02:43,727 --> 03:02:44,737

Boys!

03:02:50,367 --> 03:02:52,807
- Max the power! - Max the power!

4053
03:02:57,077 --> 03:02:58,817
Star Creators all around the world,

4054
03:02:58,977 --> 03:03:00,746
the fourth global voting...

4055
03:03:00,747 --> 03:03:03,146
that will decide the participants to advance to the finals...

4056
03:03:03,147 --> 03:03:05,087

4071
03:03:41,557 --> 03:03:43,156

4072
03:03:43,157 --> 03:03:46,697

4073
03:03:48,097 --> 03:03:49,926
Next week, the Semi-finals New Song Streaming Evaluation...

4074
03:03:49,927 --> 03:03:52,997
will take place.

4075
03:03:53,497 --> 03:03:55,066
The New Song Streaming Evaluation...

4076
03:03:55,067 --> 03:03:57,166
will be held on the major music streaming platforms in Korea.

4077
03:03:57,167 --> 03:03:58,736
("Lucky MACHO," "Chains," "Sugar HIGH," "MAIN DISH")

4078
03:03:58,737 --> 03:04:00,306
Based on the new song chart rankings...

4079
03:04:00,307 --> 03:04:02,706
and the streaming evaluation results at the close of the voting,

4080
03:04:02,707 --> 03:04:04,716
all the participants of the song...

4081
03:04:04,717 --> 03:04:06,377
will be given benefit points.

4082
03:04:06,817 --> 03:04:08,486
The maximum benefit points participants can receive...

4083
03:04:08,487 --> 03:04:10,916
as a result of the new song streaming evaluation...

4084
03:04:10,917 --> 03:04:12,117
is 200,000 points.

4085
03:04:13,017 --> 03:04:15,826
This score will be reflected on the final score of participants...

4086
03:04:15,827 --> 03:04:18,107
that will be revealed at the Third Survivor Announcement.

4087
03:04:18,827 --> 03:04:21,167
(The Second Survivor Announcement ends.)

4088
03:04:25,697 --> 03:04:26,766
What are you doing?

4089
03:04:26,767 --> 03:04:28,213
(The time of parting has come again.)

4090
03:04:28,237 --> 03:04:29,966
- I'll say it. - Well done.

4091
03:04:29,967 --> 03:04:30,977
Goodness.

4092
03:04:31,607 --> 03:04:32,937
Why are you crying?

4093
03:04:33,677 --> 03:04:36,647
I wasn't crying, but I teared up because you cried.

4094
03:04:37,077 --> 03:04:38,357
What else could I do? I was sad.

4095
03:04:39,847 --> 03:04:41,917
It's okay. I expected it.

4096
03:04:43,547 --> 03:04:44,787
I've never seen you cry.

4097
03:04:46,817 --> 03:04:48,727
He's secretly crying here too.

4098
03:04:48,827 --> 03:04:50,687
I didn't cry when Jia Han Yu left.

4099
03:04:52,597 --> 03:04:53,896
It would make you cry.

4100
03:04:53,897 --> 03:04:56,697
- It's because you did your best. - It's heartbreaking to see him cry.

4101
03:04:56,997 --> 03:04:58,236
It's because you were serious.

4102
03:04:58,237 --> 03:05:00,866
(Those who will remain can't stop crying either.)

4103
03:05:00,867 --> 03:05:02,267
Thank you.

4104
03:05:04,007 --> 03:05:06,576
I've been praying for you, but you got eliminated.

4105
03:05:06,577 --> 03:05:08,306
Your speech made me cry.

4106
03:05:08,307 --> 03:05:10,307
I really don't want to go back.

4107
03:05:11,077 --> 03:05:13,817
I really don't want to leave.

4108
03:05:16,287 --> 03:05:17,957
You have to become a rapper now.

4109
03:05:18,487 --> 03:05:20,487
- Not a rap rookie. - Rap rookie.

4110
03:05:21,327 --> 03:05:23,157
I feel like crying because I feel sorry.

4111
03:05:24,127 --> 03:05:25,607
Go up higher if you're going to stay.

4112
03:05:26,557 --> 03:05:28,026
You don't have to go so high, but you should do your best.

4113
03:05:28,027 --> 03:05:29,027
Okay.

4114
03:05:29,127 --> 03:05:31,466
Let's keep in touch.

4115
03:05:31,467 --> 03:05:32,596
(The participants comfort themselves by promising to meet next time.)

4116
03:05:32,597 --> 03:05:34,137
- Be happy. - Okay.

4117
03:05:34,197 --> 03:05:35,667
- Good luck to you too. - Okay.

4118
03:05:36,207 --> 03:05:39,607
What I'm taking home from BOYS II PLANET...

4119
03:05:39,977 --> 03:05:41,407
are the people.

4120
03:05:41,507 --> 03:05:44,276
We practiced together every day,

4121
03:05:44,277 --> 03:05:48,547
we laughed, and we fought.

4122
03:05:49,417 --> 03:05:53,657
I think I made a precious memory...

4123
03:05:53,857 --> 03:05:57,087
that I wouldn't forget in this life.

4124
03:05:57,557 --> 03:05:59,273
I want to thank everyone who holds a beautiful memory...

4125
03:05:59,297 --> 03:06:02,367
of me here.

4126
03:06:03,527 --> 03:06:07,067
I enjoyed every moment I spent here.

4127
03:06:07,807 --> 03:06:09,237
I was really happy.

4128
03:06:10,167 --> 03:06:11,276
Boys!

4129
03:06:11,277 --> 03:06:14,176
- Max the power! - Max the power!

4130
03:06:14,177 --> 03:06:16,006
(We cheer for the participants' dreams...)

4131
03:06:16,007 --> 03:06:18,477
(that will burn brightly.)

4132
03:06:18,577 --> 03:06:20,577
(The participants are in the practice room again.)

4133
03:06:20,617 --> 03:06:21,887
Suddenly...

4134
03:06:21,987 --> 03:06:23,546
(Teams "MAIN DISH" and "Lucky MACHO" recruit again.)

4135
03:06:23,547 --> 03:06:24,556
Is he alone?

4136
03:06:24,557 --> 03:06:25,817
He's alone in "MAIN DISH."

4137
03:06:25,917 --> 03:06:28,957
(Li Zi Hao was the only survivor out of the 12 members.)

4138
03:06:29,087 --> 03:06:31,327
Those who want to join "MAIN DISH," please come forward.

4139
03:06:35,467 --> 03:06:36,726
I'm lonely.

4140
03:06:36,727 --> 03:06:38,697
I just don't know what to do.

4141
03:06:39,267 --> 03:06:41,567
(What will happen to Team "MAIN DISH?")

4142
03:06:42,067 --> 03:06:43,506
(Interim Check)

4143
03:06:43,507 --> 03:06:46,136
You made this choreography with Koo Young, right?

4144
03:06:46,137 --> 03:06:47,636
Do you like it, Yumeki?

4145
03:06:47,637 --> 03:06:51,377
I edited many parts.

4146
03:06:54,747 --> 03:06:57,316
They'd be sad.

4147
03:06:57,317 --> 03:06:59,017
Why?

4148
03:06:59,057 --> 03:07:00,657
Because it's not good.

4149
03:07:01,957 --> 03:07:03,656
(The interim check for Team "Chains" follows.)

4150
03:07:03,657 --> 03:07:04,727
Let's do this.

4151
03:07:09,227 --> 03:07:11,336
Sang Won is weak.

4152
03:07:11,337 --> 03:07:13,437
- It's very weak. - It looks weak.

4153
03:07:13,467 --> 03:07:15,307
But Zhang Jia Hao said he did well.

4154
03:07:18,637 --> 03:07:20,777
My eyes were caught on only you.

4155
03:07:21,507 --> 03:07:23,347
Really.

4156
03:07:23,477 --> 03:07:24,747
I got mad.

4157
03:07:27,347 --> 03:07:28,347
No.

4158
03:07:30,247 --> 03:07:32,657
(What will happen to Team "Chains?")
