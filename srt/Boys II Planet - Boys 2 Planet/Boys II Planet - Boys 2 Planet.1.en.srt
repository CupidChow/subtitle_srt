(The voting process and results of BOYS II PLANET...)

00:00:19,511 --> 00:00:21,451
(will be verified by Samil PwC, an external agency.)

3
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:25,121
(The BOYS II PLANET crew will work hard to make a good show.)

4
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,361
Debut.

5
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:34,391
The journey of debuting.

6
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:40,531
And here...

7
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:45,941
are the boys who desperately want to debut.

8
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:54,051
The world-scale debut project...

9
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:57,281
for the top boy group in the K-pop scene, BOYS II PLANET.

10
00:00:57,951 --> 00:00:59,951
The boys' challenge to reach the top...

11
00:01:00,491 --> 00:01:02,251
will begin now.

12
00:01:04,761 --> 00:01:06,321
BOYS II PLANET...

13
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:09,731
has a very interesting universe.

14
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:12,601
The show will begin...

15
00:01:16,071 --> 00:01:17,341
not as one planet...

16
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:21,571
but two.

17
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:27,781
PLANET K.

18
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:30,851
- BOYS II PLANET K. - BOYS II PLANET K.

19
00:01:32,721 --> 00:01:34,091
PLANET C.

20
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:37,721
- BOYS II PLANET C. - BOYS II PLANET C.

21
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:43,131
Only the boys who proved their worth...

22
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:45,901
through fierce competition in their respective planets...

23
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:49,331
will meet on one planet, BOYS II PLANET,

24
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:52,071
and acquire qualifications to continue competing for the debut.

25
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:57,681
PLANET K and PLANET C.

26
00:01:58,241 --> 00:01:59,611
Between the two planets,

27
00:01:59,711 --> 00:02:04,181
you're watching the beginning of PLANET K.

28
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:12,761
(BOYS II PLANET C will air tomorrow night at 9:20pm.)

29
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:18,861
From now on, they have only one purpose.

30
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:25,971
It's to become the best and realize the dream of debuting.

31
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:40,921
The journey of BOYS II PLANET K has begun.

32
00:02:41,951 --> 00:02:43,321
To reach this point,

33
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:46,261
the boys will go through many things.

34
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:48,331
Competition.

35
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:51,001
Despair. Friendship.

36
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:53,061
Hope.

37
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:56,631
At the end of the journey, who will reach the top...

38
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,671
and realize their dream of debuting?

39
00:03:04,881 --> 00:03:06,911
Their fate depends on you guys,

40
00:03:07,411 --> 00:03:10,921
the fans around the world who are also called Star Creators.

41
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:12,951
Star Creators,

42
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:15,621
you're the sun to the boys.

43
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:18,791
Your intense energy is the only thing...

44
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,391
that can make them debut.

45
00:03:25,231 --> 00:03:26,401
Star Creators,

46
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:31,141
who among these boys will ignite your passion?

47
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:33,471
Boys!

48
00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:34,941
- Make some power! - Make some power!

49
00:03:49,491 --> 00:03:51,291
Star Creators around the world.

50
00:03:51,391 --> 00:03:54,661

75
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:16,871
(The participants arrive at the studio.)

76
00:05:20,481 --> 00:05:21,511
It's starting.

77
00:05:25,081 --> 00:05:27,621
- Let's go. - Let's go!

78
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:30,861
Hello.

79
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:33,021
Did you say hello 3 times because there are 3 cameras?

80
00:05:33,021 --> 00:05:34,091
Yes, that's right.

81
00:05:36,531 --> 00:05:39,001
(A participant who looks quite young also arrives.)

82
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:41,131
(The youngest, 15-year-old participant and his mother)

83
00:05:41,131 --> 00:05:43,731
(His mother came to send him off.)

84
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:44,771
Good luck.

85
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:46,171
- Don't get hurt. - I love you.

86
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:48,441
My dear son.

87
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,411
Here you go. Go and do everything you want.

88
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:55,851
I love you, my son. Goodbye.

89
00:05:59,051 --> 00:06:00,051
Oh, no.

90
00:06:01,321 --> 00:06:02,751
I didn't want to cry.

91
00:06:05,321 --> 00:06:06,991
I've never been apart from my son.

92
00:06:09,631 --> 00:06:12,561
(The participants take the first step toward their debut.)

93
00:06:13,601 --> 00:06:15,671
I'm finally on BOYS II PLANET.

94
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:17,801
It's a chance to show myself.

95
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:20,501
As much as I can, no matter what...

96
00:06:20,611 --> 00:06:22,011
To leave no regrets...

97
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:23,671
It will probably be my last chance.

98
00:06:23,671 --> 00:06:25,441
I will do my best.

99
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:31,651

(The first participants to enter the waiting room)

103
00:06:42,961 --> 00:06:43,961
We have name tags.
(The name tags welcome the participants.)

104
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:46,001
We have name tags.

105
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:49,971
Hello, I'm Park Dong Gyu, and I'm signed with IST Entertainment.

106
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:51,371
I'm Kim Si Hwan.

107
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:52,901
I'm Rensho.

108
00:06:53,141 --> 00:06:54,211
I'm Arctic.

109
00:06:54,511 --> 00:06:57,041
It finally started.

110
00:06:57,841 --> 00:07:00,181
My heart fluttered.

111
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:02,751
I'm in such a great mood, so I'll work out.

112
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:05,521
Rensho is good.

113
00:07:05,621 --> 00:07:08,721
(He's in love with working out. Who is Rensho?)

114
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:10,591
(During the "Signal Song" performance,)

115
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,421
(he was the push-up fairy at the end.)

116
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:14,831
Do you usually work out?

117
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:18,231
I hate working out.

118
00:07:18,661 --> 00:07:21,671
(Rensho doesn't like to work out.)

119
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:23,971
I can do acrobatics.

120
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:26,271
I practiced judo when I was in middle school.

121
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:34,251
(Rensho doesn't like to work out, but he's athletic and muscular.)

122
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:35,381
Rensho.

123
00:07:35,381 --> 00:07:36,581
(Rensho relaxed tension by working out.)

124
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,321
- Rensho, work out a lot. - Wait.

125
00:07:38,321 --> 00:07:39,321
What's this?

126
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:42,051
(They noticed a message on paper.)

127
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:43,091
- What's this? - What?

128
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,891
- Let's see. - Here it is.

129
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:48,791
What is it?

130
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:49,961
(What caught IST Entertainment trainees' attention)

131
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:53,401
(The first performance playlist)

132
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:55,571
- What's "Here I Am?" - "HIP?"

133
00:07:56,071 --> 00:07:57,131
MAMAMOO?

134
00:07:58,671 --> 00:07:59,841
"Maverick."

135
00:08:00,401 --> 00:08:02,771
The playlist.

136
00:08:02,771 --> 00:08:03,841
(Suddenly, he gets nervous again.)

137
00:08:03,841 --> 00:08:04,881
Gosh, DEUX?

138
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:06,981
- There's also "SAY MY NAME." - What?

139
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:08,781
"BANG BANG BANG."

140
00:08:09,211 --> 00:08:11,151
There were also many difficult songs.

141
00:08:11,251 --> 00:08:13,381
I thought, "We should do well."

142
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:15,551
I was quite nervous,

143
00:08:15,651 --> 00:08:17,321
but I didn't want to make my friends more nervous.

144
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:19,921
We've worked hard until now. You can do it, right?

145
00:08:19,921 --> 00:08:21,231
We can do it.

146
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:22,591
- We can do it. - Yes!

147
00:08:22,591 --> 00:08:25,561
Dong Gyu has leadership qualities.

148
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:29,201
(Participant Park Dong Gyu livens up the mood for the team.)

149
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:32,671
He's trustworthy, and he's a good leader.

150
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:33,701
Let's do a cheer.

151
00:08:33,901 --> 00:08:35,041
One, two, three.

152
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,541
- Yes! - Yes!

153
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,541
Let's go.

154
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,341
- This is good. Keep up the spirit. - This is good.

155
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:40,981
Great, stay confident.

156
00:08:48,191 --> 00:08:51,191
(Where did they arrive after passing the dark tunnel?)

157
00:08:54,631 --> 00:08:55,831
Why is it so dark?

158
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:57,701
The place is...

159
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:05,001
- My goodness. - What's that?

160
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,391
It's the golden sun.

161
00:09:23,051 --> 00:09:25,261
It's so huge that it fills my heart with awe.

162
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,731
There was something enormous like the sun...

163
00:09:27,731 --> 00:09:29,691
behind the seat for the first-place winner.

164
00:09:29,691 --> 00:09:32,831
It looked like it had a lot of power.

165
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:40,501
- My goodness. - What's that?

166
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:42,011
- What's that? - Oh, my.

167
00:09:46,611 --> 00:09:49,911
The scale was huge, and the set was so high.

168
00:09:49,911 --> 00:09:51,581
It had an amazing aura.

169
00:09:51,581 --> 00:09:53,721
(The scale is impressive.)

170
00:09:53,721 --> 00:09:56,491
I thought, "It must have cost a lot of money."

171
00:09:56,951 --> 00:09:58,661
(In awe with the size of BOYS II PLANET K)

172
00:09:58,661 --> 00:09:59,661
BOYS II PLANET.

173
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:02,691
- There are only eight seats. - You're right.

174
00:10:03,131 --> 00:10:05,101
- I'd love to be in it. - They look beautiful.

175
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:06,731
(8 members in the final debut group?)

176
00:10:08,271 --> 00:10:09,301
What's going on?

177
00:10:10,531 --> 00:10:13,441
"BOYS II PLANET is a strict hierarchy-based competition,"

178
00:10:13,441 --> 00:10:15,471
"divided into All Star, Two Star, and One Star."

179
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:18,411
"Your survival or elimination is determined solely by your rank."

180
00:10:18,611 --> 00:10:20,141
There are 1 Star, 2 Star,

181
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:22,551
- and... - Three Star equals All Star.

182
00:10:22,551 --> 00:10:23,851
You're right.

183
00:10:23,951 --> 00:10:25,021
It's written on the steps.

184
00:10:26,121 --> 00:10:27,181
How we're seated...

185
00:10:27,181 --> 00:10:30,051
From the bottom, there are 1 Star, 2 Star, and All Star.

186
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:31,791
There are three classes.

187
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,961
There weren't many seats for All Star.

188
00:10:33,961 --> 00:10:37,161
I'm worried about not making it to All Star.

189
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:39,431
I'm determined to become All Star...

190
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,631
and get close to first place.

191
00:10:44,441 --> 00:10:45,971
They have cushions.

192
00:10:46,571 --> 00:10:47,841
These look so nice.

193
00:10:48,411 --> 00:10:49,441
They sparkle.

194
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:52,041
Which seat did you pick?

195
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:54,611
I sat on the seat for fourth place.

196
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:57,181
Don't you want the seat for first place?

197
00:10:57,651 --> 00:11:02,521
It had no support for the back.

198
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:04,861
(I'm the seat for 1st place.)

199
00:11:05,261 --> 00:11:07,021
- This is amazing. - It's nice.

200
00:11:07,191 --> 00:11:09,231
- I love it. - I can see the stage so clearly.

201
00:11:09,231 --> 00:11:10,431
(IST Entertainment trainees sat in Top 8 seats.)

202
00:11:10,431 --> 00:11:11,961
Which agency members are coming next?

203
00:11:11,961 --> 00:11:12,961
- I know. - I know.

204
00:11:13,831 --> 00:11:15,671
- iNKODE? - iNKODE?

205
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:20,371
(iNKODE, an agency founded by Kim Jae Joong)

206
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:24,241
(What kind of participants will be coming out?)

207
00:11:24,241 --> 00:11:28,981
- Hello. - Hello.

208
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:31,121
They look so handsome.

209
00:11:32,051 --> 00:11:33,721
He looks like Im Si Wan.

210
00:11:34,551 --> 00:11:37,251
Hello, I'm Masato from Japan.

211
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:39,191
(When his profile was revealed)

212
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:40,621
(Masato looks like Im Si Wan.)

213
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:42,091
(I had similar thoughts. He also reminded me of Im Si Wan.)

214
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:43,631
(I love the look in his eyes.)

215
00:11:43,731 --> 00:11:45,701
Were you confident about your appearance?

216
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:48,031
When I was in kindergarten,

217
00:11:48,131 --> 00:11:51,871
I realized that I was handsome.

218
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:53,371
(In kindergarten?)

219
00:11:53,371 --> 00:11:56,971
Please look at the camera and show off your good looks.

220
00:11:58,711 --> 00:12:01,011
(Showing off his good looks)

221
00:12:03,051 --> 00:12:04,621
Could you smile...

222
00:12:04,621 --> 00:12:08,221
- Could you smile more? - Could you smile more?

223
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:11,161
(Waiting again for him to show off his good looks)

224
00:12:11,961 --> 00:12:13,821
(Forcing himself to smile)

225
00:12:14,431 --> 00:12:16,261
(Trembling)

226
00:12:17,491 --> 00:12:19,931
(Laughing)

227
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:22,701
(The handsome boy isn't used to showing off.)

228
00:12:23,971 --> 00:12:25,271
He's the most handsome.

229
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:27,471
(Masato sat in the first-place seat.)

230
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:30,411
What's going on?

231
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:34,481
(Suddenly, a high note echos in the studio.)

232
00:12:34,911 --> 00:12:36,181
What was that?

233
00:12:37,051 --> 00:12:39,821
What's up, everyone?

234
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:41,151
(Shout, everyone.)

235
00:12:41,251 --> 00:12:43,451
(Just shout for now.)

236
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:45,121
I can tell his personality already.

237
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:50,161
What's up, everyone? I'm WAVE Trainee Ryan from the US.

238
00:12:51,361 --> 00:12:52,601
I can't wait to get to know them.

239
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:54,701
I will become their friend right away.

240
00:12:54,931 --> 00:12:57,471
Everyone looks so handsome.

241
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,741
(Complimenting on their looks to get to know them)

242
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:01,011
He seems so cheerful.

243
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:03,141
Oh, what's up?

244
00:13:04,311 --> 00:13:07,441
(Which participant got caught on Ryan's energetic radar?)

245
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:09,281
Hey, brother.

246
00:13:09,651 --> 00:13:12,681
I've been close to Jun Il for a long time.

247
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:15,021
What? Oh, my gosh.

248
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:16,391
(Which one now?)

249
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:18,191
- Jun Ho. - Brother.

250
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:19,291
(Participant Oh Jun Ho from With Us Entertainment)

251
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,461
(Does he know him too?)

252
00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:21,861
I haven't seen you in a long time.

253
00:13:21,961 --> 00:13:24,331
- What? - It's like a family reunion.

254
00:13:24,331 --> 00:13:25,361
Is that Masato?

255
00:13:26,061 --> 00:13:28,201
- Oh, my gosh. - How does he know so many people?

256
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:29,771
He knows everyone.

257
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:33,101
(Which participant will follow Ryan?)

258
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:35,041
- WakeOne. - WakeOne?

259
00:13:36,171 --> 00:13:37,311
There are cameras.

260
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:39,681
All white.

261
00:13:40,411 --> 00:13:41,481
So young.

262
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:43,711
My charm point...

263
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,981
is my strong ankles.

264
00:13:52,091 --> 00:13:53,091
What?

265
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:57,561
What?

266
00:14:00,261 --> 00:14:01,271
That's a rare talent.

267
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:02,431
I feel pain just by watching him.

268
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:05,641
I think these five people would dance...

269
00:14:05,641 --> 00:14:07,471
- I think they'd dance well. - really well.

270
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:09,371
- Most of the agencies in Korea... - Most of the agencies.

271
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:10,841
are represented here.

272
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,781
I wonder who will come next.

273
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,611
- SEOUL A. - SEOUL A.

274
00:14:16,111 --> 00:14:17,921
- Are they coming in regions? - Yes.

275
00:14:17,921 --> 00:14:20,251
Hello. I'm Kwon Gyu Hyung.

276
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:21,691
I'm Park Ji Min.

277
00:14:21,691 --> 00:14:24,221
(Starting with the shy participants from Seoul,)

278
00:14:24,621 --> 00:14:25,991
There are four.

279
00:14:26,361 --> 00:14:27,361
(participants from each region appear.)

280
00:14:27,361 --> 00:14:28,991
- They're from Gyeonggi. - Gyeonggi.

281
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:30,231
I'm from Gyeonggi Province.

282
00:14:31,461 --> 00:14:32,461
Hello.

283
00:14:32,461 --> 00:14:34,161
- Boryeong? - Isn't the mud festival there?

284
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,371
I'm Tomoya from Hokkaido.

285
00:14:37,131 --> 00:14:39,001
Even from Japan?

286
00:14:39,241 --> 00:14:42,211
- Cheongju. - They're coming from every region.

287
00:14:43,211 --> 00:14:44,381
- Kim Dong Hyun? - Kim Dong Hyun.

288
00:14:45,111 --> 00:14:48,011
(Same name and same outfit color)

289
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:58,091
(Double windmill spin)

290
00:14:58,091 --> 00:14:59,191
Goodness.

291
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:01,161
(That's unbelievable.)

292
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:02,191
Is he human?

293
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,461
- Daegu. - Even from Daegu?

294
00:15:07,801 --> 00:15:11,001
(He seems very determined.)

295
00:15:12,441 --> 00:15:14,471
He is charismatic.

296
00:15:15,811 --> 00:15:17,741
(Confident and relaxed)

297
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:19,941
(Making noises with his mouth)

298
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:21,151
(Clearing his throat)

299
00:15:21,851 --> 00:15:23,651
Smile.

300
00:15:24,521 --> 00:15:28,051
(They get off determined with a fake smile.)

301
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,821
(Many boys get out of the car.)

302
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:34,361
(Who is this participant who brought many friends with him?)

303
00:15:34,361 --> 00:15:36,531
Hello. I'm Baek Jae Hyeon.

304
00:15:36,961 --> 00:15:38,161
Be at ease.

305
00:15:38,161 --> 00:15:40,001
- You came here from Daegu. - Right.

306
00:15:40,001 --> 00:15:41,171
I'll go get first place.

307
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,831
- It's nothing hard. - Right.

308
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:44,201
- See you. - Okay.

309
00:15:44,641 --> 00:15:46,541
Get ready. Take it out.

310
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,441
(What did his friends prepare?)

311
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:50,941
Baek Jae Hyeon, the pride of Yeungnam High School!

312
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,781
- Go and set the stage on fire! - You can do it!

313
00:15:54,781 --> 00:15:57,381
- Baek Jae Hyeon, let's go! - Let's go!

314
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:00,281
Baek Jae Hyeon.

315
00:16:00,721 --> 00:16:03,091
- Will he go to the first seat? - Right.

316
00:16:03,091 --> 00:16:04,221
(You can remove people from their seats.)

317
00:16:04,221 --> 00:16:05,921
(If someone is sitting in your desired seat,)

318
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:07,661
(you may remove them.)

319
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:09,661
(Currently sitting in 1st place: GREAT M's Park Nu Ri)

320
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,431
He's really confident.

321
00:16:12,901 --> 00:16:14,971
- Hello. - Hello.

322
00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:16,171
Hello.

323
00:16:18,871 --> 00:16:19,871
He just goes forward.

324
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:21,071
I think he will come.

325
00:16:21,641 --> 00:16:23,571
(Everyone's eyes are on him.)

326
00:16:23,771 --> 00:16:25,141
He's looking at the first place.

327
00:16:26,281 --> 00:16:27,681
He's just looking up.

328
00:16:29,351 --> 00:16:30,381
Hey.

329
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:32,921
This is mine. I should win first place.

330
00:16:33,121 --> 00:16:34,491
Go and set the stage on fire!

331
00:16:35,321 --> 00:16:36,491
(Intimidated)

332
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:38,461
(They have an arm wrestle to get the 1st place seat.)

333
00:16:40,461 --> 00:16:41,731
- That's how it goes? - Really?

334
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:44,701
(Baek Jae Hyeon wins.)

335
00:16:44,701 --> 00:16:46,531
Baek Jae Hyeon, the pride of Yeungnam High School!

336
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:48,431
- He's really amazing. - He went there.

337
00:16:49,071 --> 00:16:51,741
Look behind. It's pretty.

338
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:53,471
It's really big.

339
00:16:54,371 --> 00:16:55,371
First place.

340
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:57,711
- Why does it shine so much? - It's cool.

341
00:16:57,711 --> 00:16:59,441
I want to sit in the first place's seat.

342
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:03,311
(Many participants sat in the 1st place's seat.)

343
00:17:03,311 --> 00:17:05,381
- Shall we do push-ups? - Okay.

344
00:17:05,521 --> 00:17:07,921
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

345
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,621
How can they do so many?

346
00:17:10,091 --> 00:17:12,291
- Twenty-seven. - He bulked up. It's so clear.

347
00:17:12,321 --> 00:17:13,361
Goodness.

348
00:17:13,921 --> 00:17:15,291
- He's falling behind. - Thirty-one.

349
00:17:16,261 --> 00:17:18,361
(Heo Ji O wins.)

350
00:17:18,661 --> 00:17:21,971
He's really well-built. His muscles are very defined.

351
00:17:21,971 --> 00:17:23,331
(He took the 1st place's seat with his arm muscles.)

352
00:17:23,431 --> 00:17:26,441
I'll challenge you with height.

353
00:17:26,441 --> 00:17:28,041
(A challenge in height)

354
00:17:28,141 --> 00:17:30,411
Height? That's a bit cruel.

355
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:31,711
Who is taller?

356
00:17:33,281 --> 00:17:34,441
Myeong Su.

357
00:17:34,581 --> 00:17:35,881
(The 1cm pride)

358
00:17:35,881 --> 00:17:37,681
Please step down. Thank you.

359
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,251
- That's cruel. - It's really cruel.

360
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,621
He took it with his physical trait.

361
00:17:41,851 --> 00:17:43,951
(If only I were 1cm taller...)

362
00:17:44,221 --> 00:17:45,821
- Below the stage... - What?

363
00:17:45,821 --> 00:17:47,091
He was doing acrobatics.

364
00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:48,561
(The physical ability challenge isn't over.)

365
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:50,891
Goodness.

366
00:17:52,401 --> 00:17:53,601
Let's go, Jun Il!

367
00:17:53,931 --> 00:17:56,231
(I'll show you.)

368
00:17:56,231 --> 00:17:58,001
(They're excited.)

369
00:18:00,341 --> 00:18:02,941
(Acrobatic: 0, Fun: 5)

370
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,511
Where is he going?

371
00:18:06,581 --> 00:18:07,641
I fell behind.

372
00:18:07,641 --> 00:18:11,111
(Everyone wants to sit in the 1st place's seat.)

373
00:18:11,781 --> 00:18:13,221
(And...)

374
00:18:13,481 --> 00:18:14,721
He's coming.

375
00:18:15,321 --> 00:18:17,851
- Who is it? - His footsteps are calm.

376
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:21,431
His height...

377
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:23,161
They're all tall.

378
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:24,191
What do I do?

379
00:18:24,661 --> 00:18:26,461
Our growth plates are still open.

380
00:18:26,461 --> 00:18:27,831
Right.

381
00:18:27,831 --> 00:18:29,701
- Hello. - Hello.

382
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:30,771
Hello.

383
00:18:31,771 --> 00:18:32,901
(Exclaiming)

384
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:33,901
He's good-looking.

385
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,771
He's like a model.

386
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:38,911
He's so good-looking.

387
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:42,111
He walked from afar, and he looked so handsome.

388
00:18:44,181 --> 00:18:46,081
Geon Woo is so cool.

389
00:18:46,551 --> 00:18:48,291
He came right out of a comic book.

390
00:18:48,621 --> 00:18:49,921
I just stared at him.

391
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:56,291
How old are you?

392
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:59,401
I was born in 2003.

393
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:00,461
I was born in 2003 too.

394
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:01,971
- You were born in 2003? - Yes. Nice to meet you.

395
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:03,301
Nice to meet you.

396
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,271
The two handsome guys met.

397
00:19:05,271 --> 00:19:06,971
Why are they all so handsome?

398
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:10,041
- He really looks like Kim Ji Woong. - Right.

399
00:19:10,841 --> 00:19:12,681
He looks like Kim Gyu Vin.

400
00:19:12,711 --> 00:19:14,281
I think he looks like Kim Jun Su.

401
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:16,611
- FNC? - Awesome.

402
00:19:16,611 --> 00:19:17,681
(Kenshiro and Chuei Li Yu appear next.)

403
00:19:17,681 --> 00:19:19,051
Chuei Li Yu.

404
00:19:19,481 --> 00:19:20,881
I guess being handsome is a basic requirement.

405
00:19:22,191 --> 00:19:23,751
- They look so handsome. - Right.

406
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:25,061
They're all handsome.

407
00:19:25,721 --> 00:19:26,761
Including me.

408
00:19:27,261 --> 00:19:28,261
(He just laughs.)
Why are you laughing?

409
00:19:29,261 --> 00:19:31,091
(Which participant will appear next?)

410
00:19:31,091 --> 00:19:32,631
- WAKEONE! - WAKEONE?

411
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:33,661
Another one?

412
00:19:33,901 --> 00:19:35,431
There's another team?

413
00:19:37,671 --> 00:19:39,071
H?

414
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:40,371
H?

415
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,741
What does H mean?

416
00:19:41,741 --> 00:19:42,841
Hangook?

417
00:19:42,911 --> 00:19:43,971
Honja.

418
00:19:44,571 --> 00:19:45,681
Honja.

419
00:19:45,741 --> 00:19:48,611
(The trainees of WAKEONE_H appear.)

420
00:19:50,081 --> 00:19:51,111
- Hello. - Hello.

421
00:19:51,551 --> 00:19:54,691
I'm the puppy-like cat who raps in WAKEONE, Chung Sang Hyeon.

422
00:19:55,421 --> 00:19:57,591
- Hip-hop. - H for hip-hop.

423
00:19:57,591 --> 00:19:59,021
His tone says he does hip-hop.

424
00:20:00,921 --> 00:20:02,991
Hello. I'm the president of PLANET CLUB,

425
00:20:02,991 --> 00:20:05,531
Chung Sang Hyeon of WAKEONE who does hip-hop.

426
00:20:05,531 --> 00:20:09,971
I'm a hip-hop unit trainee, Chung Sang Hyeon.

427
00:20:09,971 --> 00:20:11,771
(All right, Sang Hyeon. We get you're a hip-hop unit trainee.)

428
00:20:11,771 --> 00:20:14,871
(Hip-hop Chung Sang Hyeon is known all around.)

429
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:17,871
- Please show us your charm. - Show us.

430
00:20:18,411 --> 00:20:21,341
(Chung Sang Hyeon confidently walks forward.)

431
00:20:24,251 --> 00:20:27,051
(What charm will Chung Sang Hyeon show them?)

432
00:20:28,751 --> 00:20:30,751
(A seriously cute face)

433
00:20:31,391 --> 00:20:33,261
(It's hip-hop?)

434
00:20:35,331 --> 00:20:36,531
That's cute.

435
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:38,701
(WAKEONE_H with an unexpected charm joined.)

436
00:20:38,701 --> 00:20:39,861
Who's next?

437
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:42,101
Who will come next?

438
00:20:43,371 --> 00:20:44,531
CUBE!

439
00:20:45,241 --> 00:20:46,841
(Masato is excited from seeing a participant from CUBE.)

440
00:20:46,841 --> 00:20:47,941
CUBE.

441
00:20:48,141 --> 00:20:49,641
Next would be CUBE.

442
00:20:50,071 --> 00:20:51,111
CUBE?

443
00:20:51,211 --> 00:20:52,341
CUBE?

444
00:20:52,341 --> 00:20:53,881
Why do you like CUBE so much?

445
00:20:54,951 --> 00:20:56,781
(It's the name he wanted to see so much.)

446
00:20:57,351 --> 00:21:00,021
- Hello. They look young. - Hello.

447
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,491
(They first sit on the floor before even greeting them.)

448
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:05,021
What's happening?

449
00:21:13,131 --> 00:21:14,361
Delinquent boys.

450
00:21:15,231 --> 00:21:16,931
- Should we start? - Show them.

451
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:21,201
- Hello! - Hello!

452
00:21:21,201 --> 00:21:22,341
(Greeting politely)

453
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,711
We're from CUBE,

454
00:21:25,711 --> 00:21:28,151
- and we were born in 2010. - We're 15.

455
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:30,381
Born in 2010.

456
00:21:30,451 --> 00:21:32,521
What's happening to the world?

457
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:35,151
- I'm a tough guy, Na Yun Seo. - I'm a tough guy, Kim Jae Hyun.

458
00:21:35,151 --> 00:21:36,391
(We're tough guys.)

459
00:21:36,391 --> 00:21:37,421
They were both born in 2010?

460
00:21:37,521 --> 00:21:38,661
Tough guy.

461
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:48,431
I can't see the letters.

462
00:21:49,171 --> 00:21:50,901
All Star, Two Star, One Star

463
00:21:50,901 --> 00:21:51,971
"Regardless of your assigned rank,"

464
00:21:51,971 --> 00:21:53,041
"sit with your team wherever you want."

465
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,171
(Regardless of your assigned rank,)

466
00:21:54,171 --> 00:21:55,211
(sit with your team wherever you want.)

467
00:21:57,341 --> 00:21:59,081
What does that mean?

468
00:22:00,411 --> 00:22:02,811
(The trainees of CUBE go to their seats.)

469
00:22:05,281 --> 00:22:06,951
I don't think we should make eye contact with them.

470
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,321
Young people are scary.

471
00:22:08,321 --> 00:22:09,321
(Spreading their legs)

472
00:22:09,321 --> 00:22:11,421
Let's put it here.

473
00:22:11,421 --> 00:22:14,221
(The etiquette of the tough guys)

474
00:22:14,221 --> 00:22:16,631
(Staring)

475
00:22:16,991 --> 00:22:18,161
Delinquent students.

476
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:21,261
(Which participant will appear after the delinquent students?)

477
00:22:21,301 --> 00:22:22,301
- GRID? - GRID?

478
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:23,401
Where is that?

479
00:22:23,401 --> 00:22:24,401
GRID?

480
00:22:26,901 --> 00:22:28,141
Are they coming?

481
00:22:28,311 --> 00:22:30,741
(Two participants from an unfamiliar agency come to the stage.)

482
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:32,311
Who are they?

483
00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:37,881
It's him!

484
00:22:37,881 --> 00:22:38,921
(Na Yun Seo recognized the two participants right away.)

485
00:22:38,921 --> 00:22:40,121
- Hello! - Hello!

486
00:22:43,521 --> 00:22:44,651
Why are their faces so small?

487
00:22:45,561 --> 00:22:48,331
(The details of the participants from GRID are revealed.)

488
00:22:48,331 --> 00:22:50,561
(Lee Leo, 3 years 7 months)

489
00:22:50,561 --> 00:22:53,531
(Lee Sang Won, 6 years)

490
00:22:53,531 --> 00:22:54,631
He's...

491
00:22:55,101 --> 00:22:59,071
I think all trainees know them.

492
00:22:59,441 --> 00:23:01,711
Trainee A.

493
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:03,871
They were in Trainee A.

494
00:23:05,681 --> 00:23:06,681
What?

495
00:23:06,781 --> 00:23:08,381
Leo!

496
00:23:08,711 --> 00:23:10,851
- Leo! Trainee A! - What?

497
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:12,751
Sang Won!

498
00:23:12,881 --> 00:23:14,821
(Murmuring)

499
00:23:14,821 --> 00:23:17,921
(Many participants recognize them.)

500
00:23:17,921 --> 00:23:20,821
I knew they were in Trainee A,

501
00:23:20,821 --> 00:23:22,431
Big Hit Music's debut team.

502
00:23:22,431 --> 00:23:25,661
They were the core members too.

503
00:23:25,661 --> 00:23:28,161
I watched YouTube a lot for a while.

504
00:23:28,161 --> 00:23:30,431
I watched the videos on their channel.

505
00:23:30,431 --> 00:23:32,541
(Trainee A, gaining fans even before their debut)

506
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:33,741
(Trainee A with a global fandom before their debut,)

507
00:23:33,741 --> 00:23:34,941
(building anticipation)

508
00:23:34,941 --> 00:23:36,771
I enjoyed their videos so much,

509
00:23:36,771 --> 00:23:39,211
but at some point, they disappeared.

510
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:40,441
(No content available)

511
00:23:40,441 --> 00:23:42,181
(What will happen to Trainee A of Big Hit Music?)

512
00:23:42,181 --> 00:23:44,681
I wondered where they went.

513
00:23:44,851 --> 00:23:46,221
When they appeared...

514
00:23:47,081 --> 00:23:48,821
It's Lee Sang Won and Lee Leo.

515
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:51,761
I got goosebumps.

516
00:23:51,761 --> 00:23:53,061
I was starstruck.

517
00:23:53,621 --> 00:23:55,461
Hello. I am Lee Leo,

518
00:23:55,461 --> 00:23:57,161
trainee of GRID Entertainment. It's nice to meet you all.

519
00:23:57,161 --> 00:23:59,301
I am Lee Sang Won. Hello.

520
00:24:00,531 --> 00:24:01,631
No way.

521
00:24:02,071 --> 00:24:03,501
- Is this real? - It's real.

522
00:24:03,671 --> 00:24:05,741
They're real. Gosh.

523
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:09,311
I can't believe I get to see them in person.

524
00:24:09,971 --> 00:24:12,841
(They are sticking the Star stickers.)

525
00:24:12,941 --> 00:24:14,881
- They exude a special vibe. - They do.

526
00:24:15,211 --> 00:24:18,181
(They all watch Sang Won and Leo.)

527
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:20,751
My eyes are blinded.

528
00:24:21,451 --> 00:24:23,591
(Kim Jae Hyun's vision)

529
00:24:23,691 --> 00:24:25,061
Good thing I wore lenses.

530
00:24:25,161 --> 00:24:26,891
- I told you to wear them too. - I know.

531
00:24:28,991 --> 00:24:31,091
- I'm dizzy. - I'm dumbfounded.

532
00:24:31,631 --> 00:24:34,261
Who's... They are too...

533
00:24:35,071 --> 00:24:38,341
Big of stars to be here.

534
00:24:39,371 --> 00:24:40,401
(Yokohama)

535
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:41,541
From Yokohama!

536
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:44,311
He must be a really talented person.

537
00:24:44,711 --> 00:24:45,741
Yokohama?

538
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:47,441
- There he is. - Who could it be?

539
00:24:47,641 --> 00:24:48,811
He's coming out.

540
00:24:49,311 --> 00:24:50,551
I'm curious.

541
00:24:54,321 --> 00:24:55,691
- What? - What's wrong?

542
00:24:56,221 --> 00:24:57,251
What?

543
00:24:57,251 --> 00:24:58,621
(Shocked again, blinded again)

544
00:24:58,621 --> 00:24:59,721
Who is it?

545
00:25:03,361 --> 00:25:04,491
- No way. - What?

546
00:25:07,231 --> 00:25:08,331
- What? - It's him?

547
00:25:09,631 --> 00:25:13,041
(Who's the man from Yokohama that shocked everyone?)

548
00:25:13,401 --> 00:25:14,801
I felt a little dizzy.

549
00:25:15,411 --> 00:25:16,511
Why is he here?

550
00:25:16,941 --> 00:25:17,971
What?

551
00:25:18,381 --> 00:25:20,281
What's going on? What is this?

552
00:25:20,281 --> 00:25:22,511
I will greet everyone. Hello.

553
00:25:22,811 --> 00:25:25,251
- I was speechless. - No way.

554
00:25:25,481 --> 00:25:26,521
I...

555
00:25:28,221 --> 00:25:29,421
It's Yumeki.

556
00:25:29,621 --> 00:25:32,291
I am Yumeki from Japan.

557
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:34,221
- Wait. - You got to be kidding me.

558
00:25:34,621 --> 00:25:36,261
- You got to be kidding me. - No way.

559
00:25:37,361 --> 00:25:38,531
He's that Yumeki?

560
00:25:38,531 --> 00:25:40,001
- He is. - What?

561
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:41,061
- He's Yumeki. - Is he?

562
00:25:41,101 --> 00:25:42,101
It's him.

563
00:25:42,271 --> 00:25:44,431
He's the super-popular dancer from 1MILLION DANCE STUDIO.

564
00:25:46,601 --> 00:25:49,271
He's very popular in the dance scene.

565
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:52,241
He proved his dance skills on "Street Man Fighter."

566
00:25:53,711 --> 00:25:56,351
He has choreographed for popular idols too.

567
00:25:56,351 --> 00:25:58,081
I've copied his dances many times.

568
00:25:59,181 --> 00:26:02,691
Every idol trainee watches his videos...

569
00:26:02,721 --> 00:26:04,351
and tries to copy him as closely as possible.

570
00:26:05,421 --> 00:26:07,221
He was the trainer on a Japanese survival show.

571
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:11,491
(Yumeki was the trainer of a survival show in Japan.)

572
00:26:12,831 --> 00:26:13,961
(Let's do it again.)

573
00:26:13,961 --> 00:26:15,931
(I don't know what you were trying to show.)

574
00:26:15,971 --> 00:26:18,871
(Yumeki was known for his objective criticisms and piercing eyes.)

575
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:21,271
He should be a master. Why is he here?

576
00:26:21,911 --> 00:26:23,511
Oh, my gosh.

577
00:26:23,971 --> 00:26:25,641
I am super thrilled.

578
00:26:25,781 --> 00:26:29,951
The dancer I like is right before my eyes.

579
00:26:29,981 --> 00:26:32,381
We are going to be practicing together.

580
00:26:33,321 --> 00:26:34,951
This is legendary.

581
00:26:35,221 --> 00:26:36,691
- We can't compete with him. - Wait.

582
00:26:37,351 --> 00:26:38,591
This is mad.

583
00:26:38,821 --> 00:26:40,161
This is unbelievable.

584
00:26:40,161 --> 00:26:41,261
(Yumeki, who surprised everyone, takes a seat too.)

585
00:26:41,261 --> 00:26:43,431
That's not the zone for One Stars.

586
00:26:43,531 --> 00:26:44,891
That's the winners' seat.

587
00:26:45,431 --> 00:26:46,461
I should've sat there.

588
00:26:47,001 --> 00:26:48,571
As it gets nearer to the end...

589
00:26:49,431 --> 00:26:50,701
He's not the last one.

590
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:52,701
- Right. - There are more.

591
00:26:52,701 --> 00:26:54,241
- What? - No way.

592
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:55,271
(There are still empty seats.)

593
00:26:55,311 --> 00:26:57,141
BOYS II PLANET is...

594
00:26:57,141 --> 00:26:58,411
They really went all for it.

595
00:26:59,341 --> 00:27:01,981
Are they going to bring in even more amazing talents?

596
00:27:02,181 --> 00:27:04,411
Gosh, this is a legendary show.

597
00:27:07,381 --> 00:27:09,291
(Experienced participant)

598
00:27:10,091 --> 00:27:11,121
My goodness.

599
00:27:12,461 --> 00:27:14,191
- Experienced participant. - Experienced participant.

600
00:27:14,321 --> 00:27:16,231
- Experienced participant. What? - Experienced participant?

601
00:27:17,091 --> 00:27:18,761
Are we going to see the real idols?

602
00:27:19,201 --> 00:27:20,231
Gosh.

603
00:27:20,331 --> 00:27:21,361
(Experienced participant)

604
00:27:27,071 --> 00:27:28,071
What is that?

605
00:27:28,711 --> 00:27:29,741
What is that?

606
00:27:33,081 --> 00:27:34,741
- What the... - What?

607
00:27:35,211 --> 00:27:36,351
What?

608
00:27:47,561 --> 00:27:49,561
- No way. - Wait.

609
00:27:50,831 --> 00:27:52,001
Oh, my gosh.

610
00:27:58,601 --> 00:28:00,301
(Experienced participant)

611
00:28:01,401 --> 00:28:02,811
Is this right? Wait.

612
00:28:04,371 --> 00:28:05,941
VERIVERY member is here.

613
00:28:05,981 --> 00:28:07,111
Harry June?

614
00:28:07,281 --> 00:28:08,281
Of DKB.

615
00:28:08,281 --> 00:28:09,581
It's Seo Won.

616
00:28:09,811 --> 00:28:12,181
What? They're all participating?

617
00:28:12,421 --> 00:28:13,881
Can we even fight them?

618
00:28:14,451 --> 00:28:17,021
It's going to be really hard.

619
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:18,421
I'm terrified.

620
00:28:20,221 --> 00:28:22,391
Almost everyone I can think of is here.

621
00:28:23,991 --> 00:28:25,461
I want to see their faces.

622
00:28:26,301 --> 00:28:27,601
Can I have one of your lenses?

623
00:28:28,631 --> 00:28:30,001
They've already put the stickers.

624
00:28:30,301 --> 00:28:32,101
- Three Stars? - They all...

625
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:34,601
They all put Three Stars on themselves.

626
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:37,771
"The All Star seats are reserved..."

627
00:28:38,171 --> 00:28:39,241
No way.

628
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:41,681
No way. I don't believe it.

629
00:28:42,751 --> 00:28:45,321
(The All Star seats are reserved for the experienced participants.)

630
00:28:47,781 --> 00:28:48,851
This isn't right.

631
00:28:49,191 --> 00:28:50,621
No way.

632
00:28:51,151 --> 00:28:52,491
(Please move to lower-ranked seats.)

633
00:28:52,491 --> 00:28:55,431
(The participants have to move from the All Star seats.)

634
00:28:55,431 --> 00:28:56,831
I tried so hard to keep this seat.

635
00:28:57,661 --> 00:28:59,061
I felt very upset.

636
00:28:59,161 --> 00:29:01,401
We were asked to move,

637
00:29:01,401 --> 00:29:02,901
and that made me feel pitiful.

638
00:29:03,131 --> 00:29:04,371
It felt good.

639
00:29:04,731 --> 00:29:07,241
I felt sorry, but it had to be done.

640
00:29:07,301 --> 00:29:08,671
We are experienced participants,

641
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:10,871
so this is the right way.

642
00:29:11,571 --> 00:29:14,211
The upper seats are empty.

643
00:29:14,311 --> 00:29:15,311
I know.

644
00:29:23,691 --> 00:29:24,721
VERIVERY.

645
00:29:25,361 --> 00:29:26,421
Seven years.

646
00:29:26,691 --> 00:29:27,721
Seven years of experience.

647
00:29:27,721 --> 00:29:29,161
No way.

648
00:29:29,661 --> 00:29:31,161
They are the most experienced of all.

649
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:36,531
(They are the all-rounder group that represent the 4th generation.)

650
00:29:37,171 --> 00:29:39,401
(VERIVERY)

651
00:29:39,401 --> 00:29:42,771
VERIVERY is a very popular group.

652
00:29:42,871 --> 00:29:44,871
Perhaps it came from all the years of experience.

653
00:29:44,871 --> 00:29:46,611
They had this incredible aura...

654
00:29:46,611 --> 00:29:48,881
and chill energy about them.

655
00:29:49,381 --> 00:29:51,711
It wasn't our intention,

656
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,381
but we took the All Star seats away from you.

657
00:29:53,381 --> 00:29:56,891
I'm sure some of you might be upset.

658
00:29:57,051 --> 00:29:59,191
We will win your approval through our performance.

659
00:30:04,061 --> 00:30:06,161
- Hello. - Hello.

660
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:08,361
- It's nice to meet you all. - Hello.

661
00:30:09,371 --> 00:30:10,901
Hello.

662
00:30:11,171 --> 00:30:13,301
(VERIVERY heads to the top of the All Star zone.)

663
00:30:13,301 --> 00:30:15,311
It's high. It's very high.

664
00:30:15,311 --> 00:30:16,611
- It's high. - My legs.

665
00:30:18,311 --> 00:30:19,811
(VERIVERY takes the top 1, 2, 3 seats.)

666
00:30:19,811 --> 00:30:20,881
Gosh, the top.

667
00:30:21,641 --> 00:30:22,811
So it begins.

668
00:30:23,311 --> 00:30:25,451
(Following VERIVERY, the experienced participants greet everyone.)

669
00:30:25,451 --> 00:30:26,551
DKB.

670
00:30:27,021 --> 00:30:28,251
MCND.

671
00:30:29,051 --> 00:30:32,391
(K-Pop's popular performance groups, DKB...)

672
00:30:32,391 --> 00:30:35,161
(and MCND)

673
00:30:35,531 --> 00:30:36,891
Do you know my team?

674
00:30:37,031 --> 00:30:38,161
- We do. - We do.

675
00:30:38,591 --> 00:30:41,601
If you do, we will prove it to you with our performance.

676
00:30:43,201 --> 00:30:44,271
I am terrified.

677
00:30:44,771 --> 00:30:46,801
We will show you how you play...

678
00:30:46,801 --> 00:30:48,471
on stage.

679
00:30:50,771 --> 00:30:53,481
On stage, we will show you that we have enough talent...

680
00:30:53,481 --> 00:30:54,681
to receive three stars.

681
00:30:54,681 --> 00:30:55,681
They are amazing.

682
00:30:56,081 --> 00:30:57,211
I feel drained.

683
00:30:57,951 --> 00:31:00,421
The competition is too fierce.

684
00:31:01,321 --> 00:31:02,691
That's what makes it fun.

685
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:04,451
(The experienced participants fearlessly fill the All Star zone.)

686
00:31:04,451 --> 00:31:06,091
- We are experienced participants. - Come.

687
00:31:06,221 --> 00:31:07,791
- Good job waiting a long time. - Yes.

688
00:31:10,391 --> 00:31:12,761
(The experienced participants filled the All Star seats.)

689
00:31:14,631 --> 00:31:15,871
I can't stop staring at them.

690
00:31:16,431 --> 00:31:17,671
This is ridiculous.

691
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:23,271
A lot of experienced participants participated in the show.

692
00:31:23,371 --> 00:31:24,971
I feel intimidated.

693
00:31:24,971 --> 00:31:27,511
This competition is going to be much harder...

694
00:31:27,811 --> 00:31:29,051
than I expected.

695
00:31:29,151 --> 00:31:30,511
The experienced participants sat in the All Star zone.

696
00:31:31,011 --> 00:31:32,581
That put a lot of pressure on me.

697
00:31:32,821 --> 00:31:34,581
We had to do really well.

698
00:31:34,721 --> 00:31:36,391
We have to do whatever we can do...

699
00:31:36,391 --> 00:31:38,251
to keep the seat.

700
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:40,091
I have to give my all.

701
00:31:40,521 --> 00:31:41,891
I'm here to make a debut, after all.

702
00:31:42,691 --> 00:31:45,531
(BOYS II PLANET K is finally ready.)

703
00:31:46,401 --> 00:31:49,231
(The lights dim at the studio.)

704
00:31:50,931 --> 00:31:52,141
What's going on?

705
00:31:53,941 --> 00:31:55,811
(Drawing their attention)

706
00:31:56,511 --> 00:31:59,041
Eighty boys, welcome.

707
00:31:59,881 --> 00:32:02,981
This is BOYS II PLANET, where burning passion...

708
00:32:03,411 --> 00:32:05,081
fuels the journey to the top.

709
00:32:08,721 --> 00:32:10,591
On BOYS II PLANET,

710
00:32:11,021 --> 00:32:13,321
there is more than one planet.

711
00:32:14,761 --> 00:32:15,831
There is more than one planet.

712
00:32:16,031 --> 00:32:17,061
How many then?

713
00:32:17,261 --> 00:32:19,331
PLANET K and PLANET C.

714
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:21,901
Two planets exist.

715
00:32:22,301 --> 00:32:23,371
What?

716
00:32:23,471 --> 00:32:24,971
Where you are now...

717
00:32:25,471 --> 00:32:26,841
is PLANET K.

718
00:32:27,501 --> 00:32:29,411
In another space,

719
00:32:29,641 --> 00:32:32,481
the story of PLANET C is starting to unfold.

720
00:32:35,011 --> 00:32:36,081
What?

721
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:37,411
What?

722
00:32:37,851 --> 00:32:39,151
That's not us.

723
00:32:39,821 --> 00:32:41,321
(Hello.)

724
00:32:41,421 --> 00:32:42,791
Hello.

725
00:32:43,391 --> 00:32:45,021
- Hi. - No way.

726
00:32:47,121 --> 00:32:48,291
- It's real time. - Where is that?

727
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:51,991
Turns out there's another planet called PLANET C.

728
00:32:52,201 --> 00:32:54,801
I am curious about what kind of trainees are there.

729
00:32:54,801 --> 00:32:56,001
It was fascinating.

730
00:32:56,571 --> 00:32:57,731
PLANET K and PLANET C.

731
00:32:58,531 --> 00:33:01,041
The boys who survive on their planet...

732
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:02,311
will meet on the planet...

733
00:33:02,611 --> 00:33:04,371
called BOYS II PLANET...

734
00:33:04,541 --> 00:33:07,241
and continue the survival competition.

735
00:33:07,781 --> 00:33:10,211
Only the boys who manage to survive until the end...

736
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:12,111
and reach the very top...

737
00:33:12,321 --> 00:33:14,321
will achieve the dream of making a debut.

738
00:33:14,821 --> 00:33:15,951
We have to make a debut.

739
00:33:16,191 --> 00:33:17,551
We got this.

740
00:33:17,991 --> 00:33:20,091
The 80 participants gathered here...

741
00:33:20,591 --> 00:33:23,261
will be judged on their talent, charm,

742
00:33:23,691 --> 00:33:26,231
and potential as a K-pop idol.

743
00:33:26,231 --> 00:33:28,601
and the result will be revealed as "class."

744
00:33:29,371 --> 00:33:30,631
I'm starting to get nervous.

745
00:33:31,071 --> 00:33:33,501
One Star is the lowest class.

746
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:35,241
That's me.

747
00:33:35,741 --> 00:33:37,441
Above it is Two Star.

748
00:33:38,311 --> 00:33:40,581
The highest class, All Star.

749
00:33:41,711 --> 00:33:43,851
These are the three classes.

750
00:33:44,051 --> 00:33:45,781
After every mission,

751
00:33:45,781 --> 00:33:47,481
the participants in the lowest class...

752
00:33:47,981 --> 00:33:49,021
No way.

753
00:33:49,221 --> 00:33:50,321
What happens?

754
00:33:50,521 --> 00:33:52,661
will be instantly eliminated.

755
00:33:53,961 --> 00:33:58,331
(All members of the lowest class will be eliminated every mission.)

756
00:33:58,331 --> 00:34:01,131
It's not just some of them. It's the whole class.

757
00:34:01,901 --> 00:34:03,671
Oh, no.

758
00:34:04,201 --> 00:34:08,441
Then, who are the most important people...

759
00:34:08,541 --> 00:34:10,971
who will determine your class and debut?

760
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:13,641
It's the fans from all over the world...

761
00:34:13,881 --> 00:34:16,511
who will cheer you up with their sunlike energy,

762
00:34:16,881 --> 00:34:18,581
Star Creators.

763
00:34:19,051 --> 00:34:20,181
Star Creators!

764
00:34:21,781 --> 00:34:23,121
We love you.

765
00:34:24,091 --> 00:34:26,391
Show them your passion and energy...

766
00:34:26,891 --> 00:34:31,131
and ignite a fire in the hearts of the Star Creators.

767
00:34:32,131 --> 00:34:33,301
- We'll light a fire. - Yes!

768
00:34:33,361 --> 00:34:34,601
We can do it.

769
00:34:35,361 --> 00:34:38,531
Now, I introduce you...

770
00:34:38,831 --> 00:34:41,671
the best of the best in various fields of K-pop,

771
00:34:41,971 --> 00:34:46,081
the Masters, who will guide you through your growth.

772
00:34:47,981 --> 00:34:49,081
I can't wait to find out.

773
00:34:49,181 --> 00:34:50,381
I wonder who they are.

774
00:34:50,851 --> 00:34:51,951
(K-pop Masters)

775
00:34:52,111 --> 00:34:53,321
Vocal Master.

776
00:34:53,821 --> 00:34:55,751
- Vocals! - Who is it?

777
00:34:55,891 --> 00:34:57,221
- Who is it? - Who is it?

778
00:34:57,491 --> 00:34:58,591
Who is it?

779
00:34:59,021 --> 00:35:01,261
Vocal Masters, Lee Seok Hoon...

780
00:35:01,721 --> 00:35:02,891
and ONESTAR.

781
00:35:03,391 --> 00:35:06,201
(Giving a shout)

782
00:35:06,201 --> 00:35:07,231
(Lee Seok Hoon and ONESTAR)

783
00:35:08,631 --> 00:35:09,871
(He gave the participants feedback with a level head...)

784
00:35:09,871 --> 00:35:11,771
(and advice with a warm heart in Season 1.)

785
00:35:11,771 --> 00:35:15,541
(Seok Hoon was a reliable mentor for the participants.)

786
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:18,711
(ONESTAR brilliantly guided the way...)

787
00:35:18,711 --> 00:35:20,841
(with his bright energy...)

788
00:35:20,841 --> 00:35:22,881
(in Season 1.)

789
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:27,621
Their aura is off the charts.

790
00:35:28,991 --> 00:35:30,121
Vocal Master.

791
00:35:30,121 --> 00:35:31,191
(The third Vocal Master)

792
00:35:31,851 --> 00:35:32,991
It's a woman.

793
00:35:34,221 --> 00:35:36,061
Vocal Master, Hyolin.

794
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:38,531
(Surprised)

795
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:39,931
Is this for real?

796
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:43,101
(Hyolin is a powerful vocalist who dominates the stage...)

797
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:45,671
(and is the leader of SISTAR, a girl band representing K-pop.)

798
00:35:46,571 --> 00:35:47,671
I did not see that coming.

799
00:35:47,671 --> 00:35:49,311
It's an insane group of Masters.

800
00:35:49,671 --> 00:35:50,671
(Announcing the Masters)

801
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:52,581
Are we seeing the Dance Masters now?

802
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:54,141
Dance Master...

803
00:35:55,181 --> 00:35:56,281
(Dance Master)

804
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:57,351
Baek Koo Young.

805
00:35:58,451 --> 00:35:59,751
(Covering his mouth)

806
00:36:02,021 --> 00:36:03,151
(Baek Koo Young)

807
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:04,191
This is incredible.

808
00:36:04,351 --> 00:36:06,591
We shouldn't be cheering, though. We're in big trouble.

809
00:36:07,261 --> 00:36:08,491
Honestly, I was scared...

810
00:36:08,721 --> 00:36:11,691
because he seemed terrifying in the first season.

811
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:14,101
(Koo Young made everyone tense...)

812
00:36:14,101 --> 00:36:17,471
(with his straightforward criticisms.)

813
00:36:18,071 --> 00:36:19,401
We need to dance hard.

814
00:36:20,801 --> 00:36:21,871
Dance Master...

815
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:23,211
Who is it?

816
00:36:23,341 --> 00:36:24,411
KINKY.

817
00:36:28,741 --> 00:36:30,411
(A sensational choreographer who leads the K-pop dance trend.)

818
00:36:30,411 --> 00:36:32,181
(He's worked with aespa, Red Velvet, and STAYC.)

819
00:36:32,181 --> 00:36:35,751
(KINKY is a detail-oriented performance director.)

820
00:36:36,421 --> 00:36:37,421
Unbelievable.

821
00:36:37,521 --> 00:36:38,821
(KINKY)

822
00:36:39,921 --> 00:36:41,021
Dance Master...

823
00:36:42,691 --> 00:36:43,731
What?

824
00:36:45,561 --> 00:36:47,401
Dance Master Kany.

825
00:36:49,101 --> 00:36:51,131
- It's Kany! - Oh, my gosh!

826
00:36:51,701 --> 00:36:53,241
But she's literally world-class.

827
00:36:53,471 --> 00:36:54,841
(The lead choreographer for global pop stars...)

828
00:36:54,841 --> 00:36:56,441
(such as Michael Jackson and Beyonce.)

829
00:36:56,441 --> 00:36:59,241
(Kany, a world-class choreographer)

830
00:36:59,681 --> 00:37:00,841
This is insane.

831
00:37:02,811 --> 00:37:03,851
Kany!

832
00:37:03,981 --> 00:37:05,651
Finally, the Masters I've been dying to know.

833
00:37:05,651 --> 00:37:07,181
Who would be the Rap Masters?

834
00:37:07,521 --> 00:37:08,581
Rap Master...

835
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:12,991
(This rap sounds familiar!)

836
00:37:13,321 --> 00:37:16,361
(Who's the Rap Master that's making everyone wild?)

837
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:18,291
There's no way!

838
00:37:18,891 --> 00:37:20,031
Rap Master...

839
00:37:20,831 --> 00:37:21,901
Justhis.

840
00:37:22,331 --> 00:37:25,501
(They can't believe it.)

841
00:37:25,871 --> 00:37:26,941
This is crazy.

842
00:37:27,741 --> 00:37:29,711
(Justhis is a top-class rapper...)

843
00:37:29,711 --> 00:37:32,581
(that leads the hip-hop industry in Korea.)

844
00:37:33,641 --> 00:37:35,011
Show me the money!

845
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:36,851
(Feeling dizzy)

846
00:37:37,011 --> 00:37:38,251
I love you!

847
00:37:38,681 --> 00:37:39,721
This is amazing.

848
00:37:40,581 --> 00:37:42,621
(The legendary Masters of BOYS II PLANET K)

849
00:37:42,621 --> 00:37:43,751
This is a legendary cast.

850
00:37:44,021 --> 00:37:45,691
I still can't believe it. It feels like I'm dreaming.

851
00:37:46,421 --> 00:37:47,991
Their aura was so strong.

852
00:37:48,421 --> 00:37:49,931
I'm ready to learn from them.

853
00:37:53,701 --> 00:37:56,301
Welcome to BOYS II PLANET, everyone.

854
00:37:56,671 --> 00:37:59,971
(It's nice to meet you.)

855
00:38:00,301 --> 00:38:04,041
Starting now, a desperate competition begins...

856
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:07,041
to prove your own class.

857
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:11,511
The fierce class war of the show begins...

858
00:38:12,351 --> 00:38:14,251
with the Class Placement Match.

859
00:38:14,681 --> 00:38:17,051
War that places us in different classes?

860
00:38:18,221 --> 00:38:19,991
After the Class Placement Match,

861
00:38:19,991 --> 00:38:23,261
you will be placed in your respective classes.

862
00:38:23,261 --> 00:38:26,131
(Classes: All Star, 2 Star, and 1 Star)

863
00:38:26,831 --> 00:38:28,031
And there's more.

864
00:38:28,631 --> 00:38:30,301
(What else?)

865
00:38:32,441 --> 00:38:34,741
If the Masters decide...

866
00:38:34,841 --> 00:38:40,581
that you do not deserve a class at all,

867
00:38:42,511 --> 00:38:43,981
you will be placed in the No Star Class...

868
00:38:44,211 --> 00:38:45,251
Wait.

869
00:38:46,051 --> 00:38:47,151
No way.

870
00:38:47,781 --> 00:38:48,851
and...

871
00:38:50,551 --> 00:38:52,591
be eliminated on the spot.

872
00:38:54,561 --> 00:38:55,561
No Star.

873
00:38:55,561 --> 00:38:59,731
(A new rule of BOYS II PLANET)

874
00:38:59,731 --> 00:39:01,861
(Participants in the No Star Class...)

875
00:39:01,861 --> 00:39:03,871
(are instantly eliminated.)

876
00:39:04,771 --> 00:39:05,901
Be eliminated on the spot.

877
00:39:08,271 --> 00:39:09,341
That's so cruel.

878
00:39:09,941 --> 00:39:11,411
After the very first performance?

879
00:39:11,671 --> 00:39:13,111
I wasn't expecting that.

880
00:39:13,511 --> 00:39:15,311
It's too harsh.

881
00:39:15,711 --> 00:39:18,711
I was hoping they wouldn't place me in the No Star Class.

882
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:20,621
We really have to do well.

883
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:22,281
Let's do well.

884
00:39:22,421 --> 00:39:23,921
We can get the All Star Class.

885
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:26,761
My goal was to get All Star.

886
00:39:27,521 --> 00:39:30,131

Okay. Let's go!

I have.

00:40:45,201 --> 00:40:48,941
(pH-1 was a Rap Master in the previous season.)

914
00:40:49,311 --> 00:40:51,041
He was too kind, though.

915
00:40:51,271 --> 00:40:53,341
Then, I should be hard on them.

916
00:40:53,741 --> 00:40:55,181
(Expected to spit straight facts)

917
00:40:55,781 --> 00:40:58,051
Before we see the first team,

918
00:40:58,051 --> 00:41:00,981
this Class Placement Match is where we judge...

919
00:41:01,321 --> 00:41:04,421
your talent, charisma, and potential.

920
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:06,521
- Does everyone understand? - Yes.

921
00:41:07,321 --> 00:41:09,831
Then, let's bring out the first team.

922
00:41:10,231 --> 00:41:12,731
- Let's go! - Let's go!

923
00:41:13,001 --> 00:41:14,301
Who's the first to go?

924
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:16,301
(Who will perform first in the Class Placement Match?)

925
00:41:17,571 --> 00:41:18,771
Oh, it's IST.

926
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:21,241
- IST Entertainment. - I'm excited.

927
00:41:21,241 --> 00:41:22,441
(The trainees of IST will open the Class Placement Match.)

928
00:41:23,711 --> 00:41:24,811
- Hello! - Hello!

929
00:41:25,141 --> 00:41:27,941
We're a team of trainees...

930
00:41:27,941 --> 00:41:30,181
from IST Entertainment.

931
00:41:30,911 --> 00:41:33,381
Hello, I'm in IST Entertainment,

932
00:41:33,381 --> 00:41:35,021
and my name is Park Dong Gyu.

933
00:41:35,251 --> 00:41:37,721
I'm the leader of this team.

934
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:41,021
The members are very proud of their skills.

935
00:41:41,021 --> 00:41:42,791
We're certain that people will say,

936
00:41:43,031 --> 00:41:45,061
"How are trainees that good?"

937
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:47,931
I think it's all about the spirit.

938
00:41:48,531 --> 00:41:50,131
- Spirit. - It's about the spirit.

939
00:41:51,101 --> 00:41:52,201
Are you guys ready?

940
00:41:52,201 --> 00:41:53,441
Let's put our hands together.

941
00:41:53,841 --> 00:41:54,901
(Cheering)

942
00:41:55,401 --> 00:41:57,011
Let's put our hands together, guys.

943
00:41:57,011 --> 00:41:58,541
(They keep their spirits high, even in the green room.)

944
00:41:59,111 --> 00:42:00,211
Let's put our hands together.

945
00:42:00,281 --> 00:42:01,511
With the fifth member.

946
00:42:02,181 --> 00:42:03,581
(Me?)

947
00:42:03,581 --> 00:42:04,611
Okay.

948
00:42:04,611 --> 00:42:06,021
(Unexpectedly lifting his spirit)

949
00:42:06,351 --> 00:42:07,651
It's all about the spirit.

950
00:42:07,651 --> 00:42:08,721
Right.

951
00:42:08,781 --> 00:42:10,021
Spirit.

952
00:42:10,021 --> 00:42:11,121
It's all about the spirit, guys.

953
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:15,091
(Spreading the importance of the spirit)

954
00:42:15,521 --> 00:42:18,491
(Dong Gyu's Spirit Theory almost brainwashes them.)

955
00:42:18,491 --> 00:42:20,601
On stage, one's spirit and confidence...

956
00:42:20,601 --> 00:42:22,061
play a huge part,

957
00:42:22,131 --> 00:42:23,431
so I kept telling my teammates.

958
00:42:24,071 --> 00:42:26,171
(As a result)

959
00:42:26,501 --> 00:42:27,671
We're Team Spirit.

960
00:42:27,671 --> 00:42:28,701
(Brainwashed)

961
00:42:29,641 --> 00:42:31,511
- Hello! - Hello!

962
00:42:31,511 --> 00:42:32,841
(The IST trainees enter with their spirits high.)

963
00:42:32,941 --> 00:42:34,081
- Okay. - Hello.

964
00:42:34,241 --> 00:42:35,441
I like their energy.

965
00:42:35,911 --> 00:42:36,911
- Hello. - Hello.

966
00:42:37,011 --> 00:42:38,611
(Getting polite as their spirits are so high.)

967
00:42:38,611 --> 00:42:39,751
Six, seven.

968
00:42:40,021 --> 00:42:41,321
Get out of my way, y'all!

969
00:42:41,321 --> 00:42:42,421
Get out of my way!

970
00:42:42,421 --> 00:42:43,691
Get out of my way, y'all!

971
00:42:43,691 --> 00:42:44,821
Get out of my way!

972
00:42:44,851 --> 00:42:47,161
(Nobody can stop us)

973
00:42:47,521 --> 00:42:49,761
(Acknowledging their spirit)

974
00:42:49,761 --> 00:42:51,091
- Hi, everyone. - Hi, everyone.

975
00:42:51,091 --> 00:42:53,061
We're the trainees from IST Entertainment,

976
00:42:53,061 --> 00:42:55,831
here to show you our various charms.

977
00:42:56,101 --> 00:42:57,731
- We hope you enjoy our show! - We hope you enjoy our show!

978
00:42:57,731 --> 00:42:59,331
(We hope you enjoy our show!)

979
00:42:59,331 --> 00:43:00,841
(Their spirits fill the studio.)

980
00:43:00,841 --> 00:43:03,211
Let's go!

981
00:43:03,711 --> 00:43:05,041
Good energy.

982
00:43:05,611 --> 00:43:07,881
I can tell that their spirits are high.

983
00:43:08,241 --> 00:43:10,711
Yes, we expect to see such confidence from these trainees.

984
00:43:11,211 --> 00:43:12,511
- Standby. - Okay.

985
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,281
(They get ready for their first performance.)

986
00:43:14,481 --> 00:43:15,721
Rensho, come forward.

987
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:16,791
To the center.

988
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:17,991
(Dong Gyu, their leader, helps them with their positions.)

989
00:43:18,121 --> 00:43:19,991
Get into position. Good.

990
00:43:20,391 --> 00:43:23,591
When the whole band gets along well,

991
00:43:23,691 --> 00:43:25,161
it means the leader is doing his job.

992
00:43:25,431 --> 00:43:27,331
Weren't you the leader of SISTAR?

993
00:43:27,501 --> 00:43:28,561
I was.

994
00:43:29,061 --> 00:43:30,871
(She ends up praising herself.)

995
00:43:30,871 --> 00:43:31,971
(High spirits)

996
00:43:31,971 --> 00:43:34,501
(What type of performance will the IST trainees give?)

997
00:43:36,541 --> 00:43:38,041
("Misfit" by Kim Si Hwan, Rensho, Park Dong Gyu, and Arctic)

998
00:44:45,671 --> 00:44:46,811
Yes, let's go!

999
00:45:05,191 --> 00:45:06,361
They're killing it.

1000
00:45:18,871 --> 00:45:20,381
- My gosh. - Oh, my!

1001
00:45:20,911 --> 00:45:22,641
(A standing ovation)

1002
00:45:23,881 --> 00:45:26,151
- This is what I'm talking about. - This is it.

1003
00:45:30,191 --> 00:45:31,451
Gosh, that was cool.

1004
00:45:31,891 --> 00:45:32,921
That was amazing.

1005
00:45:32,921 --> 00:45:35,861
(The experienced participants are surprised by their skills.)

1006
00:45:35,961 --> 00:45:37,031
They're so good.

1007
00:45:38,261 --> 00:45:41,031
When they started to perform, I saw how good they were.

1008
00:45:41,031 --> 00:45:42,331
They nailed it.

1009
00:45:42,831 --> 00:45:44,171
I was slightly nervous then.

1010
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,831
That was good.

1011
00:45:47,171 --> 00:45:48,441
(Trailing off)

1012
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:51,011
We should be able to listen to your voices like this.

1013
00:45:51,011 --> 00:45:53,281
That way, we can actually evaluate your talent...

1014
00:45:53,281 --> 00:45:55,241
and share some feedback about your performance.

1015
00:45:55,641 --> 00:45:57,781
You guys held nothing back and did a great job.

1016
00:45:57,881 --> 00:46:00,251
I really liked the sense of unity the four of you showed us...

1017
00:46:00,251 --> 00:46:02,581
through this performance. And I liked your energy too.

1018
00:46:03,091 --> 00:46:04,791
- Dong Gyu, you're the leader. - Yes.

1019
00:46:05,321 --> 00:46:07,691
- You have a beautiful voice. - Thank you.

1020
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:10,991
I'd like to listen to you sing without any music.

1021
00:46:11,191 --> 00:46:12,531
Sure. I can do that.

1022
00:46:12,531 --> 00:46:14,331
(He's requested to sing on the spot for better evaluations.)

1023
00:46:21,971 --> 00:46:22,971
Oh, my.

1024
00:46:39,391 --> 00:46:43,061
(Dong Gyu sings, shifting between low notes and falsetto.)

1025
00:46:44,291 --> 00:46:47,231
- Hey, he's good! - My gosh.

1026
00:46:47,231 --> 00:46:48,261
- Thank you. - Gosh.

1027
00:46:49,201 --> 00:46:50,331
What? Why is he so good?

1028
00:46:50,701 --> 00:46:52,931
Dong Gyu should be a ballad singer.

1029
00:46:53,401 --> 00:46:55,971
His vocal style is different from that...

1030
00:46:55,971 --> 00:46:57,411
- of idol stars these days. - Right.

1031
00:46:57,511 --> 00:46:58,541
But I find his style charming.

1032
00:46:58,541 --> 00:47:00,841
Yes, it's very charming. I enjoyed your performance.

1033
00:47:00,841 --> 00:47:01,881
Thank you.

1034
00:47:02,511 --> 00:47:03,711
I bet they'll all get the All Star Class.

1035
00:47:03,951 --> 00:47:06,651
I really thought we could all get the All Star Class.

1036
00:47:07,151 --> 00:47:09,421
Well, Si Hwan.

1037
00:47:09,521 --> 00:47:10,551
Yes.

1038
00:47:10,551 --> 00:47:12,551
When you rapped...

1039
00:47:12,891 --> 00:47:16,291
(During their performance, Kim Si Hwan had a major rap part.)

1040
00:47:16,531 --> 00:47:20,461
When you rapped, I noticed that you were rushing your beats.

1041
00:47:20,761 --> 00:47:24,501
And you tend to slur your pronunciation.

1042
00:47:24,701 --> 00:47:27,271
It'd be nice if you could pay attention to that.

1043
00:47:28,171 --> 00:47:30,711
(The Masters begin discussing classes for the participants.)

1044
00:47:30,841 --> 00:47:32,911
Shouldn't all of them be placed in the All Star Class?

1045
00:47:33,341 --> 00:47:35,741
Si Hwan's rap could've been better, though.

1046
00:47:36,811 --> 00:47:38,981
Si Hwan's dance was a bit disappointing.

1047
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,281
He was barely keeping up toward the end.

1048
00:47:41,681 --> 00:47:44,021
We will announce the classes for participants from IST.

1049
00:47:44,551 --> 00:47:48,021
Participant Park Dong Gyu. We are placing you...

1050
00:47:48,821 --> 00:47:49,891
The All Star Class?

1051
00:47:49,891 --> 00:47:51,191
The All Star Class? Or the Two Star Class?

1052
00:47:51,491 --> 00:47:53,031
We are placing you...

1053
00:47:54,131 --> 00:47:55,861
in the All Star Class.

1054
00:47:55,861 --> 00:47:58,401
Thank you.

1055
00:48:01,271 --> 00:48:02,271
Congratulations.

1056
00:48:02,271 --> 00:48:03,611
You're the first one to be placed in the All Star Class.

1057
00:48:04,071 --> 00:48:05,071
The first participant in the All Star Class.

1058
00:48:05,471 --> 00:48:06,481
I'm envious.

1059
00:48:07,611 --> 00:48:11,681
Participant Rensho. We are placing you...

1060
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:12,681
(Rensho's class will be announced next.)

1061
00:48:12,751 --> 00:48:14,981
- in the All Star Class. - Thank you.

1062
00:48:15,381 --> 00:48:18,221
(The second participant to be placed in the All Star Class)

1063
00:48:18,221 --> 00:48:19,221
Thank you.

1064
00:48:21,591 --> 00:48:23,991
Arctic. We are placing you...

1065
00:48:25,161 --> 00:48:27,531
- in the All Star Class. - Thank you.

1066
00:48:28,901 --> 00:48:31,401
- My gosh. - Oh, my gosh.

1067
00:48:31,401 --> 00:48:32,601
I guess all of them will be placed in the All Star Class.

1068
00:48:33,241 --> 00:48:35,971
(3 out of the 4 participants are placed in the All Star Class.)

1069
00:48:35,971 --> 00:48:37,541
Participant Kim Si Hwan.

1070
00:48:39,241 --> 00:48:41,381
(Rap Master Justhis pointed out...)

1071
00:48:41,381 --> 00:48:44,051
(a flaw in Kim Si Hwan's rap.)

1072
00:48:44,581 --> 00:48:46,281
We are placing you...

1073
00:48:46,281 --> 00:48:48,321
(What's Kim Si Hwan's class?)

1074
00:48:51,091 --> 00:48:52,091
Please.

1075
00:48:53,021 --> 00:48:55,721
in the All Star Class.

1076
00:48:55,721 --> 00:48:57,061
(Kim Si Hwan is placed in the All Star Class.)

1077
00:48:57,331 --> 00:48:58,361
In the All Star Class.

1078
00:48:59,661 --> 00:49:01,231
(All the trainees from IST are placed in the All Star Class.)

1079
00:49:01,231 --> 00:49:02,561
- We did it. - Yes!

1080
00:49:07,841 --> 00:49:09,001
Gosh, all of them are in the All Star Class?

1081
00:49:09,401 --> 00:49:10,641
That's amazing.

1082
00:49:11,571 --> 00:49:14,111
Actually, I'd like to say something about Si Hwan.

1083
00:49:14,111 --> 00:49:16,381
Given his rap and dance skills,

1084
00:49:16,381 --> 00:49:18,351
most of us thought he should be placed in the Two Star Class...

1085
00:49:18,351 --> 00:49:19,481
if this were an individual performance.

1086
00:49:19,481 --> 00:49:22,521
However, considering your teamwork,

1087
00:49:22,521 --> 00:49:26,221
the performance wouldn't have been the same without all four of you.

1088
00:49:26,321 --> 00:49:29,991
So we decided to place you in the All Star Class as well.

1089
00:49:29,991 --> 00:49:31,831
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1090
00:49:31,831 --> 00:49:33,331
They had great energy.

1091
00:49:33,601 --> 00:49:35,801
The trainees are determined to succeed on the show.

1092
00:49:38,731 --> 00:49:41,141
Gosh, this is nice. This is what a real team feels like.

1093
00:49:41,141 --> 00:49:42,441
Seriously. It's all thanks to you guys.

1094
00:49:45,111 --> 00:49:47,141
All of us were placed in the All Star Class.

1095
00:49:47,141 --> 00:49:49,011
So I'm over the moon.

1096
00:49:49,011 --> 00:49:50,281
I'm serious. I'm so happy.

1097
00:49:52,211 --> 00:49:53,881
They're all in the All Star Class.

1098
00:49:53,881 --> 00:49:55,321
Things are going well now.

1099
00:49:55,481 --> 00:49:57,121
Who's next?

1100
00:49:58,251 --> 00:49:59,551
(Experienced Participant, MCND)

1101
00:50:00,821 --> 00:50:01,961
An idol group.

1102
00:50:02,061 --> 00:50:03,791
They're experienced participants.

1103
00:50:03,891 --> 00:50:05,131
They're the first group of experienced participants, right?

1104
00:50:05,131 --> 00:50:06,291
Yes, they're the first group.

1105
00:50:06,831 --> 00:50:08,101
- It's the experienced participants. - They're performing early.

1106
00:50:09,361 --> 00:50:11,431
They made a debut six years ago.

1107
00:50:11,931 --> 00:50:13,841
It's impossible for us not to have high expectations.

1108
00:50:14,101 --> 00:50:15,141
Come on up to the stage.

1109
00:50:18,171 --> 00:50:20,111
(MCND shows up in the midst of everyone's expectations.)

1110
00:50:20,111 --> 00:50:22,111
- They've got a crazy presence. - They look cool.

1111
00:50:25,781 --> 00:50:28,551
My gosh, they're feeling confident. They're walking out slowly.

1112
00:50:28,851 --> 00:50:29,921
They're feeling confident.

1113
00:50:30,121 --> 00:50:31,221
Their gait is different.

1114
00:50:32,221 --> 00:50:34,391
(Unlike the trainees from IST who walked out with short strides,)

1115
00:50:35,191 --> 00:50:37,691
(the experienced participants walk out with a laid-back vibe.)

1116
00:50:37,691 --> 00:50:38,691
They're feeling confident.

1117
00:50:38,791 --> 00:50:39,931
Their gait is different.

1118
00:50:40,031 --> 00:50:41,431
They look confident.

1119
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:44,371
- Two, three. Don't move. Freeze. - Freeze.

1120
00:50:44,371 --> 00:50:46,301
- Hello. We're MCND. - Hello. We're MCND.

1121
00:50:48,571 --> 00:50:50,471
They sound relaxed from the tone of their voice.

1122
00:50:51,671 --> 00:50:54,081
The name of our group, MCND,

1123
00:50:54,181 --> 00:50:55,611
means "crazy ones on stage."

1124
00:50:56,811 --> 00:50:58,981
When we're on stage, our energy is on fire.

1125
00:50:58,981 --> 00:51:01,881
We're crazy performers with unique charms.

1126
00:51:02,151 --> 00:51:03,321
That's us, MCND.

1127
00:51:03,321 --> 00:51:05,051
(They're nicknamed crazy performers who rock the stage.)

1128
00:51:05,491 --> 00:51:06,991
"Experienced Participant Song Min Jae,"

1129
00:51:06,991 --> 00:51:08,061
"you have three stars."

1130
00:51:08,061 --> 00:51:09,661
Are we going to lose the stars if we mess up?

1131
00:51:09,861 --> 00:51:11,061
That won't happen to us.

1132
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:13,091
Why? Because we've been doing this for six years.

1133
00:51:13,191 --> 00:51:15,601
Watch out. Here comes MCND.

1134
00:51:17,031 --> 00:51:20,571
"Crazy" here is a huge compliment, isn't it?

1135
00:51:20,571 --> 00:51:22,541
That's why we love that nickname.

1136
00:51:22,641 --> 00:51:24,571
Crazy talented performers.

1137
00:51:24,671 --> 00:51:26,111
Gosh, it suits them well.

1138
00:51:26,111 --> 00:51:29,211
They walked out really slowly. I thought they were crazy for real.

1139
00:51:31,081 --> 00:51:33,481
(That's so funny.)

1140
00:51:35,021 --> 00:51:37,851
Most of the participants must be your juniors.

1141
00:51:38,391 --> 00:51:40,921
As experienced participants, say something to them.

1142
00:51:43,121 --> 00:51:45,761
I'll show you what professional performers can do.

1143
00:51:47,361 --> 00:51:49,361
- He sounds scary. - He's scary.

1144
00:51:49,361 --> 00:51:51,571
My gosh, I'm so scared.

1145
00:51:51,571 --> 00:51:53,901
Gosh, I love it. I love his confidence.

1146
00:51:53,901 --> 00:51:55,201
They indeed have six years of experience.

1147
00:51:55,741 --> 00:51:57,471
- They sound confident. - You guys really have to kill it.

1148
00:51:57,471 --> 00:52:00,081
Given what you just said, you must nail this. Okay?

1149
00:52:00,511 --> 00:52:01,741
I bet they're good.

1150
00:52:01,841 --> 00:52:04,311
I wonder how good these experienced participants are.

1151
00:52:05,111 --> 00:52:07,121
Just like our name, MCND, we must rock this performance...

1152
00:52:07,121 --> 00:52:08,581
as crazy performers.

1153
00:52:12,321 --> 00:52:15,491
("BANG BANG BANG" by Noh Hui Jun, Bang Jun Hyuk, Song Min Jae)

1154
00:52:19,891 --> 00:52:20,931
I'm seeing some confidence.

1155
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,941
Is he really singing this live?

1156
00:52:51,731 --> 00:52:52,931
Is he really singing it live?

1157
00:52:53,531 --> 00:52:54,901
Gosh, he's such a good singer.

1158
00:53:12,681 --> 00:53:13,681
Experienced participants are indeed different.

1159
00:53:19,551 --> 00:53:21,121
I do have to give it to them.

1160
00:53:21,121 --> 00:53:22,161
Seriously.

1161
00:53:22,261 --> 00:53:24,391
(But it's hard to read the Masters' facial expressions.)

1162
00:53:24,391 --> 00:53:26,661
- They sang really well live. - I thought it was their concert.

1163
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,061
Six years of experience do make a difference.

1164
00:53:28,531 --> 00:53:31,301
Well,

1165
00:53:33,441 --> 00:53:35,801
- you're a good singer. - Thank you.

1166
00:53:36,201 --> 00:53:38,211
It's clear that experienced participants sure are different.

1167
00:53:38,271 --> 00:53:39,441
How many stars will they get?

1168
00:53:39,741 --> 00:53:41,881
Honestly, they could all get three.

1169
00:53:41,881 --> 00:53:42,911
What will it be?

1170
00:53:43,341 --> 00:53:44,511
This is what I think.

1171
00:53:44,651 --> 00:53:46,651
- Oh, right. Okay, then hang on. - Yes.

1172
00:53:46,721 --> 00:53:48,021
Agreed?

1173
00:53:48,021 --> 00:53:49,081
(Which class will MCND get as the first experienced participants?)

1174
00:53:49,081 --> 00:53:51,291
All right. Song Min Jae.

1175
00:53:52,721 --> 00:53:54,221
- Three. - I think he'll get three stars.

1176
00:53:55,121 --> 00:53:57,161
Two Star.

1177
00:53:57,161 --> 00:53:58,791
(Song Min Jae, 2 Star)

1178
00:54:00,301 --> 00:54:02,601
(His class is lower than what the participants expected.)

1179
00:54:04,071 --> 00:54:05,101
What, really?

1180
00:54:05,131 --> 00:54:06,271
He didn't get three?

1181
00:54:06,301 --> 00:54:07,601
I bet one of them will get three, at least.

1182
00:54:08,501 --> 00:54:09,771
Noh Hui Jun.

1183
00:54:09,771 --> 00:54:10,771
I'm sure he got three.

1184
00:54:11,511 --> 00:54:12,571
Two Star.

1185
00:54:13,681 --> 00:54:14,841
Two Star.

1186
00:54:17,811 --> 00:54:20,551
And lastly, Bang Jun Hyuk.

1187
00:54:21,721 --> 00:54:25,191
(Bang Jun Hyuk's performance was lacking during his rap part.)

1188
00:54:28,461 --> 00:54:30,191
One Star.

1189
00:54:30,431 --> 00:54:31,631
- Oh, my gosh. - What?

1190
00:54:31,631 --> 00:54:32,631
(Bang Jun Hyuk, 1 Star)

1191
00:54:32,631 --> 00:54:35,701
(Song Min Jae: 2 Star, Noh Hui Jun: 2 Star, Bang Jun: 1 Star)

1192
00:54:38,001 --> 00:54:39,831
I honestly want to give him no stars.

1193
00:54:41,671 --> 00:54:44,441
Didn't he fail to impress as an experienced participant?

1194
00:54:47,911 --> 00:54:49,441
They're way too strict.

1195
00:54:49,441 --> 00:54:51,681
It didn't feel like he deserved One Star.

1196
00:54:52,051 --> 00:54:55,181
From the way you spoke, you guys sounded like scary, crazy punks.

1197
00:54:55,181 --> 00:54:56,351
But just now, you seemed too mild.

1198
00:54:56,421 --> 00:54:59,321
It feels like your energy, as it gets delivered to the audience,

1199
00:54:59,321 --> 00:55:01,461
is a bit too low.

1200
00:55:01,461 --> 00:55:03,261
But I think that's because...

1201
00:55:03,261 --> 00:55:04,731
of your line of sight.

1202
00:55:04,731 --> 00:55:07,231
Hey, that's a really precise comment.

1203
00:55:07,231 --> 00:55:09,131
You have six years of experience.

1204
00:55:09,131 --> 00:55:10,871
They didn't look at us but at the cameras.

1205
00:55:11,801 --> 00:55:12,901
(MCND, as experienced participants,)

1206
00:55:12,901 --> 00:55:14,001
(are used to making eye contact with the camera.)

1207
00:55:14,471 --> 00:55:15,771
Your line of sight is pointed downward.

1208
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:17,671
(As the camera moves,)

1209
00:55:17,671 --> 00:55:19,771
(his line of sight was fixed on the camera,)

1210
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:21,841
(which was why his energy felt weak.)

1211
00:55:23,381 --> 00:55:27,921
(His line of sight naturally follows the camera.)

1212
00:55:29,421 --> 00:55:30,851
But that is...

1213
00:55:30,851 --> 00:55:33,021
If they were really good, even if they looked at the camera,

1214
00:55:33,021 --> 00:55:34,821
they would've been able to mesmerize us.

1215
00:55:34,821 --> 00:55:36,891
They should've looked at the camera and at us too.

1216
00:55:37,761 --> 00:55:39,591
- They were only focused on one. - That's right.

1217
00:55:40,131 --> 00:55:42,831
But you can't help but look at the camera when it comes in.

1218
00:55:42,831 --> 00:55:44,601
- That's true. - That's what experience is.

1219
00:55:45,771 --> 00:55:48,101
If you perhaps want an extra test, you can discuss it among yourselves.

1220
00:55:48,341 --> 00:55:50,441
(An extra test?)

1221
00:55:50,441 --> 00:55:51,541
And please tell us.

1222
00:55:52,441 --> 00:55:55,481
If you can't agree with the class that you got from the Masters,

1223
00:55:55,581 --> 00:55:57,011
you can ask the Masters...

1224
00:55:58,181 --> 00:56:00,851
for an extra test.

1225
00:56:02,251 --> 00:56:05,191
When requesting extra tests, you must take it seriously.

1226
00:56:05,351 --> 00:56:09,221
As a result of the extra test, your class might go up than before,

1227
00:56:09,961 --> 00:56:11,191
but it could also go down.

1228
00:56:13,131 --> 00:56:14,361
Gosh, that's crazy.

1229
00:56:14,431 --> 00:56:15,761
That's such a huge gamble.

1230
00:56:16,061 --> 00:56:17,471
I don't think we can do that rashly.

1231
00:56:18,601 --> 00:56:20,671
If you perhaps want an extra test, you can discuss it among yourselves.

1232
00:56:20,671 --> 00:56:21,841
And please tell us.

1233
00:56:21,841 --> 00:56:22,841
Okay.

1234
00:56:22,841 --> 00:56:24,111
I'm sure they want to go for it.

1235
00:56:24,411 --> 00:56:26,741
But you have to consider that your class might drop.

1236
00:56:26,741 --> 00:56:27,811
That's right.

1237
00:56:27,811 --> 00:56:28,841
You'll do it, right?

1238
00:56:29,441 --> 00:56:31,711
- Let's do it right away. - Okay.

1239
00:56:31,711 --> 00:56:34,651
- All right. - We will do the extra test.

1240
00:56:36,021 --> 00:56:37,051
Please get ready.

1241
00:56:37,321 --> 00:56:38,621
He's taking off his jacket.

1242
00:56:38,851 --> 00:56:40,191
- He looks kind of mad. - Right.

1243
00:56:40,721 --> 00:56:43,561
That's right. You should prove that you're crazy punks.

1244
00:56:44,361 --> 00:56:45,361
I'm curious.

Okay.

(What will be the results of MCND's extra test?)

The experienced participants, Team MCND's class...

1252
00:57:18,991 --> 00:57:21,231
after your extra test...

1253
00:57:25,371 --> 00:57:26,531
remains unchanged.

(Experienced participants, MCND)

1256
00:57:31,611 --> 00:57:33,881
(Bang Jun Hyuk's class is confirmed as 1 Star.)

1257
00:57:34,081 --> 00:57:36,311
- I can't believe it. - This isn't easy.

1258
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:40,651
Gosh, the judges sure are strict on evaluating experienced participants.

1259
00:57:45,351 --> 00:57:48,761
(MCND is at a loss for words at their lower than expected classes.)

1260
00:57:50,021 --> 00:57:51,161
I'm totally out of it right now.

1261
00:57:52,191 --> 00:57:54,061
I felt really bad.

1262
00:58:02,071 --> 00:58:03,671
I will prove my true skills...

1263
00:58:03,871 --> 00:58:07,041
and try hard to get a higher class.

1264
00:58:08,781 --> 00:58:10,681
- The standards are too high. - For real.

1265
00:58:11,111 --> 00:58:13,511
But then, who will get three Stars?

1266
00:58:15,451 --> 00:58:17,191
Let's meet the next team.

1267
00:58:17,921 --> 00:58:19,751
(CUBE)

1268
00:58:19,751 --> 00:58:20,821
They're from CUBE.

1269
00:58:20,821 --> 00:58:22,161
(Kim Jae Hyun, Na Yun Seo)

1270
00:58:22,161 --> 00:58:23,491
They look really young.

1271
00:58:23,621 --> 00:58:25,631
- They look like they're nine. - Like elementary school kids.

1272
00:58:27,401 --> 00:58:29,301
- Cute babies? - Babies.

1273
00:58:35,001 --> 00:58:36,041
Do they have lollipops in their mouths?

1274
00:58:40,241 --> 00:58:42,381
Are the bandages meant to threaten us?

1275
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:44,881
- Hello. - Hello.

1276
00:58:46,081 --> 00:58:47,321
- Our final education level is... - Our final education level is...

1277
00:58:47,321 --> 00:58:48,721
- completing elementary school. - Completing elementary school?

1278
00:58:48,721 --> 00:58:49,721
- Completing elementary school? - Completing elementary school?

1279
00:58:49,951 --> 00:58:51,051
I'm manly man, Na Yun Seo.

1280
00:58:51,051 --> 00:58:52,551
And I'm manly man, Kim Jae Hyun.

1281
00:58:53,721 --> 00:58:54,791
It's nice to meet you.

1282
00:58:55,591 --> 00:58:59,561
Your final level of education is completing elementary school?

1283
00:59:03,001 --> 00:59:04,471
But why is that?

1284
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,871
If they only completed elementary school...

1285
00:59:06,601 --> 00:59:07,701
Then, did they drop out of school?

1286
00:59:09,871 --> 00:59:11,671
It's because we haven't completed middle school yet.

1287
00:59:11,811 --> 00:59:13,271
Oh, you're still working on it.

1288
00:59:13,271 --> 00:59:14,711
Gosh, that surprised me.

1289
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:16,781
If you say that in such a scary tone...

1290
00:59:16,781 --> 00:59:19,011
- They're 8th graders. - Oh, you're in 8th grade.

1291
00:59:19,011 --> 00:59:20,181
I'm in ninth grade.

1292
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:21,521
(Bursting into laughter)

1293
00:59:21,521 --> 00:59:22,521
He's so clear.

1294
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:24,021
Ninth grade. Right.

1295
00:59:24,321 --> 00:59:26,651
So, Jae Hyun.

1296
00:59:27,221 --> 00:59:29,621
You look quite extraordinary. What's your position?

1297
00:59:30,361 --> 00:59:31,891
I rap and dance.

1298
00:59:32,261 --> 00:59:33,901
Oh, rap and dance.

1299
00:59:33,901 --> 00:59:36,431
Which rapper do you like, by chance?

1300
00:59:37,201 --> 00:59:39,531
Don't you know Justhis here very well?

1301
00:59:41,671 --> 00:59:43,701
I don't listen to Korean rap very much.

1302
00:59:44,671 --> 00:59:46,911
- My gosh. - He shouldn't have said that.

1303
00:59:47,441 --> 00:59:48,681
He doesn't listen to Korean hip-hop?

1304
00:59:48,681 --> 00:59:50,881
- I'll work even harder. - Oh, no.

1305
00:59:51,651 --> 00:59:52,981
The way he speaks is totally Gen Z.

1306
00:59:52,981 --> 00:59:54,951
No, aren't they called Gen Alpha?

1307
00:59:55,381 --> 00:59:57,691
- I'm so curious to see them. - I'm curious too.

1308
01:00:01,621 --> 01:00:03,361
You haven't checked your in-ear device, have you?

1309
01:00:03,961 --> 01:00:05,291
Isn't it all good if I can hear?

1310
01:00:07,431 --> 01:00:09,131
I love that kid.

1311
01:00:09,201 --> 01:00:10,671
You can hear your own mic, right?

1312
01:00:10,771 --> 01:00:11,801
That's true hip-hop.

1313
01:00:11,801 --> 01:00:13,101
Isn't it all good if I can hear?

1314
01:00:13,871 --> 01:00:15,841
- That is true. - Yes, true.

1315
01:00:15,841 --> 01:00:18,811
(What will the performance by Gen Alpha trainees from CUBE be like?)

1316
01:00:18,811 --> 01:00:21,541
- Hey, those are school chairs. - They're school chairs.

1317
01:00:21,541 --> 01:00:22,781
(2 chairs stand side by side.)

1318
01:00:23,111 --> 01:00:24,951
It looks like they're about to do something.

1319
01:00:25,911 --> 01:00:26,951
("Boy In Luv" by Kim Jae Hyun and Na Yun Seo)

1320
01:00:26,951 --> 01:00:29,021
Gosh, I really want to ask her out. Are you going to or not?

1321
01:00:29,021 --> 01:00:30,051
It is kind of awkward.

1322
01:00:30,321 --> 01:00:31,551
"Are you going to or not?"

1323
01:00:31,951 --> 01:00:33,791
It is kind of awkward. But who?

1324
01:00:33,791 --> 01:00:35,091
Me? The Star Creators.

1325
01:00:35,091 --> 01:00:36,491
We're manly men. We have to do it.

1326
01:00:36,491 --> 01:00:38,031
- Are you going to or not? Let's go. - Are you going to or not? Let's go.

1327
01:00:53,571 --> 01:00:54,641
Wait, what?

1328
01:01:22,871 --> 01:01:23,871
What is this?

1329
01:01:28,681 --> 01:01:29,781
Gosh, they're so good.

1330
01:01:31,111 --> 01:01:32,181
They're good at singing live.

1331
01:01:57,411 --> 01:01:58,471
What is this?

1332
01:02:11,521 --> 01:02:13,821
(The older guys have become their fans.)

1333
01:02:13,891 --> 01:02:15,691
- They're so cool. - That was insane.

1334
01:02:15,791 --> 01:02:17,231
They really are manly men.

1335
01:02:17,561 --> 01:02:19,431
Hey, they're manly men for sure.

1336
01:02:19,761 --> 01:02:21,261
Why are kids so good these days?

1337
01:02:21,401 --> 01:02:23,261
These guys are incredible.

1338
01:02:23,561 --> 01:02:25,571
Where do kids like these keep coming from?

1339
01:02:25,571 --> 01:02:26,631
Seriously.

1340
01:02:26,771 --> 01:02:30,941
You guys literally took the whole scene by yourselves.

1341
01:02:31,071 --> 01:02:32,941
And it was amazing.

1342
01:02:32,941 --> 01:02:35,511
Your singing, I think, was very stable. At your age,

1343
01:02:35,511 --> 01:02:37,851
that's very impressive. So, congratulations.

1344
01:02:39,651 --> 01:02:41,781
You were nodding along. Did you understand everything?

1345
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:43,621
What did she say?

1346
01:02:43,921 --> 01:02:45,721
She said our vocals were stable...

1347
01:02:45,721 --> 01:02:47,091
(Really?)

1348
01:02:47,091 --> 01:02:48,391
(And?)

1349
01:02:48,491 --> 01:02:49,691
That was all I heard.

1350
01:02:49,691 --> 01:02:50,731
(Laughing)

1351
01:02:51,331 --> 01:02:53,061
- Good job. - Thank you.

1352
01:02:54,631 --> 01:02:56,161
How can kids born in 2010 be...

1353
01:02:56,901 --> 01:02:58,131
- so good? - Good job, guys.

1354
01:02:58,671 --> 01:02:59,771
Shall we discuss their classes?

1355
01:03:00,701 --> 01:03:02,271
Okay. Please wait a minute.

1356
01:03:02,271 --> 01:03:03,341
- Okay. - Okay.

1357
01:03:04,711 --> 01:03:07,411
First off, they're constantly mad except when they're performing.

1358
01:03:07,541 --> 01:03:09,441
You can't provoke them. They only have fun while performing.

1359
01:03:09,441 --> 01:03:10,681
These kids are just mad.

1360
01:03:10,911 --> 01:03:12,011
Let's let them go quickly.

1361
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:16,881
Okay, so here are your scores.

1362
01:03:17,151 --> 01:03:20,661
Kim Jae Hyun. Your score is...

1363
01:03:21,961 --> 01:03:23,021
Two Star.

1364
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:24,731
Thank you.

1365
01:03:25,961 --> 01:03:27,301
I'd be satisfied with two Stars.

1366
01:03:27,901 --> 01:03:31,301
Na Yun Seo. Your score is...

1367
01:03:34,371 --> 01:03:36,341
- All Star. - I think he'll get Three Star.

1368
01:03:37,911 --> 01:03:39,341
Two Star.

1369
01:03:40,411 --> 01:03:41,411
Two Star.

1370
01:03:42,481 --> 01:03:43,511
Gosh!

1371
01:03:43,881 --> 01:03:45,981
- He did do well. - Great job.

1372
01:03:47,081 --> 01:03:49,881
But doesn't he deserve all three?

1373
01:03:49,921 --> 01:03:51,791
I think he looks even better because he's young.

1374
01:03:51,791 --> 01:03:53,891
I think he's at a place to learn.

1375
01:03:54,761 --> 01:03:55,821
Congratulations!

1376
01:03:55,821 --> 01:03:57,691
- Thank you. - Great job.

1377
01:03:58,061 --> 01:03:59,861
Okay. Two Star is a decent score.

1378
01:04:01,061 --> 01:04:03,161
I didn't do anything when I was 15.

1379
01:04:03,201 --> 01:04:05,501
Gosh, same here. I was just busy attending classes.

1380
01:04:06,471 --> 01:04:07,571
If you want to achieve the All Star level,

1381
01:04:07,571 --> 01:04:09,371
- how well must you do? - Tell me about it.

1382
01:04:09,371 --> 01:04:11,271
It's tough to achieve the All Star level.

1383
01:04:12,041 --> 01:04:14,611
(The Class Placement Match continues in the drought of All Stars.)

1384
01:04:15,281 --> 01:04:16,641
Who will appear next?

1385
01:04:17,581 --> 01:04:18,851
Oh, Jeonju!

1386
01:04:18,851 --> 01:04:20,081
Oh, it's Jeonju Entertainment.

1387
01:04:20,081 --> 01:04:22,021
It's my favorite entertainment company.

1388
01:04:22,021 --> 01:04:23,421
- I love Jeonju too. - Jeonju Entertainment.

1389
01:04:23,421 --> 01:04:24,591
I love Jeonju.

1390
01:04:24,591 --> 01:04:26,751
It's fascinating to see a name of a place.

1391
01:04:26,791 --> 01:04:28,091
Jeonju.

1392
01:04:28,091 --> 01:04:29,721
Jeonju? Where is that?

1393
01:04:29,721 --> 01:04:30,891
It's the land of bibimbap.

1394
01:04:31,031 --> 01:04:32,391
It's the land of bibimbap?

1395
01:04:32,731 --> 01:04:33,991
Let's go!

1396
01:04:35,731 --> 01:04:37,161
My gosh.

1397
01:04:37,301 --> 01:04:38,671
He's tall and handsome.

1398
01:04:38,901 --> 01:04:40,771
How are his body proportions like that?

1399
01:04:42,271 --> 01:04:43,571
He's good-looking.

1400
01:04:49,011 --> 01:04:50,141
Why is his face so small?

1401
01:04:52,881 --> 01:04:54,151
Gosh, Geon Woo!

1402
01:04:54,221 --> 01:04:55,721
- Sorry? - Geon Woo.

1403
01:04:56,051 --> 01:04:57,251
Doesn't he look great?

1404
01:04:57,281 --> 01:04:59,291
I thought he was someone you already knew.

1405
01:05:00,151 --> 01:05:01,561
Is Kang Min's rival here?

1406
01:05:01,691 --> 01:05:03,521
(My rival?)

1407
01:05:04,161 --> 01:05:05,231
Hello.

1408
01:05:05,661 --> 01:05:06,761
I am Kim Geon Woo.

1409
01:05:07,031 --> 01:05:08,601
As I'm desperate about making my debut,

1410
01:05:08,801 --> 01:05:11,171
I will make sure to do my best at every moment.

1411
01:05:11,331 --> 01:05:12,601
I will do my best. Thank you.

1412
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,301
That was neat.

1413
01:05:15,941 --> 01:05:17,511
Your eyes and the way you talk...

1414
01:05:17,671 --> 01:05:18,941
remind me of a student president.

1415
01:05:20,241 --> 01:05:21,281
Thank you.

1416
01:05:21,541 --> 01:05:23,111
He was a trainee for quite a while.

1417
01:05:25,081 --> 01:05:28,821
I was in SOURCE MUSIC and CUBE.

1418
01:05:30,121 --> 01:05:31,651
(SOURCE MUSIC, 8 months)

1419
01:05:31,651 --> 01:05:33,191
(He was a trainee for 4 years and 9 months.)

1420
01:05:33,191 --> 01:05:34,961
(CUBE, 3 years 1 month, Bill Entertainment, 1 year)

1421
01:05:35,261 --> 01:05:36,961
I did make it...

1422
01:05:37,931 --> 01:05:40,231
- right before making my debut. - Hello!

1423
01:05:40,331 --> 01:05:42,231
- Hello! - As I appeared in shows,

1424
01:05:42,501 --> 01:05:44,501
I really thought that...

1425
01:05:44,501 --> 01:05:47,231
I was going to make my debut.

1426
01:05:48,141 --> 01:05:50,171
But with every chance I got,

1427
01:05:53,011 --> 01:05:55,481
I ended up failing.

1428
01:05:56,941 --> 01:05:58,411
"Is this not my calling?"

1429
01:05:58,411 --> 01:06:01,521
"Am I forcing myself to follow this path?"

1430
01:06:01,521 --> 01:06:03,481
I was led to these thoughts because of that.

1431
01:06:03,481 --> 01:06:04,491
(His dream of making his debut crumbled right before his eyes.)

1432
01:06:04,491 --> 01:06:05,491
(He felt anxious that this wasn't his calling.)

1433
01:06:06,691 --> 01:06:08,521
I believe I have nowhere else to go...

1434
01:06:08,591 --> 01:06:10,321
and nowhere else to hide.

1435
01:06:10,661 --> 01:06:11,791
I'm making this challenge with that thought in mind.

1436
01:06:13,331 --> 01:06:14,931
To me, BOYS II PLANET...

1437
01:06:15,301 --> 01:06:17,061
is my last opportunity...

1438
01:06:17,301 --> 01:06:19,301
to make my dream come true.

1439
01:06:19,301 --> 01:06:21,441
(His last opportunity to make his dream come true)

1440
01:06:22,241 --> 01:06:25,611
Is there something you desperately want to hear after performing?

1441
01:06:29,641 --> 01:06:31,211
"Where have you been all this time?"

1442
01:06:33,811 --> 01:06:35,651
- This is what I want to hear. - Okay.

1443
01:06:35,851 --> 01:06:37,421
- Get ready to perform. - Right.

1444
01:06:38,691 --> 01:06:40,721
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1445
01:06:40,821 --> 01:06:41,821
Let's go!

1446
01:06:43,961 --> 01:06:45,291
- He has really long legs. - Right.

1447
01:06:45,291 --> 01:06:47,031
It will be unfair if he can dance well as well.

1448
01:06:48,701 --> 01:06:50,301
It isn't over until it's over.

1449
01:06:51,131 --> 01:06:54,801
I was determined to show everything I have worked on...

1450
01:06:55,601 --> 01:06:57,171
and to make a new start.

1451
01:07:00,511 --> 01:07:02,881
("SWEAT" by Kim Geon Woo)

1452
01:07:09,081 --> 01:07:10,081
It's neat.

1453
01:07:16,091 --> 01:07:17,121
He's singing live?

1454
01:07:23,461 --> 01:07:24,501
It's neat.

1455
01:07:41,521 --> 01:07:42,651
It's neat.

1456
01:07:49,121 --> 01:07:50,321
Okay!

1457
01:08:08,141 --> 01:08:10,011
- He's really good. - Very neat.

1458
01:08:10,041 --> 01:08:11,381
He sings really well live.

1459
01:08:11,611 --> 01:08:12,651
He sings well live.

1460
01:08:13,311 --> 01:08:14,351
He's incredible.

1461
01:08:14,421 --> 01:08:15,521
He feels like someone who has made his debut.

1462
01:08:16,051 --> 01:08:17,181
He sings really well live.

1463
01:08:17,181 --> 01:08:18,251
- Right. - He's good.

1464
01:08:18,251 --> 01:08:20,851
I think he'll do really well with signal songs.

1465
01:08:24,021 --> 01:08:25,061
Thank you.

1466
01:08:26,331 --> 01:08:28,161
(What will the Masters think about his performance?)

1467
01:08:30,601 --> 01:08:32,071
Where have you been all this time?

1468
01:08:33,271 --> 01:08:36,201
(Geon Woo hears what he desperately wanted to hear.)

1469
01:08:36,271 --> 01:08:37,401
Your live singing is great.

1470
01:08:37,401 --> 01:08:38,541
Thank you.

1471
01:08:39,471 --> 01:08:41,711
You must've practiced a lot.

1472
01:08:41,711 --> 01:08:43,541
I believe your time as a trainee...

1473
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:46,251
was fruitful.

1474
01:08:46,911 --> 01:08:49,521
(The best compliment to reward his past times)

1475
01:08:49,521 --> 01:08:50,651
Thank you.

1476
01:08:51,451 --> 01:08:52,521
But...

1477
01:08:56,161 --> 01:08:59,931
there's a specific attitude that you have when you perform.

1478
01:09:00,131 --> 01:09:02,461
There's a unique characteristic that participants have...

1479
01:09:02,461 --> 01:09:04,161
who have been trainees for a long time.

1480
01:09:04,901 --> 01:09:06,531
Rather than enjoying the performance,

1481
01:09:06,701 --> 01:09:09,801
they tend to look too desperate.

1482
01:09:09,801 --> 01:09:11,671
That sort of desperation...

1483
01:09:11,771 --> 01:09:14,581
could go against the charms...

1484
01:09:14,581 --> 01:09:16,481
that the participants have.

1485
01:09:19,281 --> 01:09:20,951
It felt like my head got hit by a hammer.

1486
01:09:21,281 --> 01:09:24,391
I didn't realize that I could...

1487
01:09:24,621 --> 01:09:25,791
look desperate on stage as well.

1488
01:09:26,921 --> 01:09:28,521
- Two Star? - Two Star?

1489
01:09:28,621 --> 01:09:30,991
I think he might become an All Star as he did really well.

1490
01:09:31,891 --> 01:09:34,291
Participant Kim Geon Woo's class...

1491
01:09:34,761 --> 01:09:36,061
will now be revealed.

1492
01:09:37,301 --> 01:09:38,501
Participant Kim Geon Woo.

1493
01:09:39,231 --> 01:09:41,701
Participant Kim Geon Woo's class...

1494
01:09:41,701 --> 01:09:44,041
(What is the result of Geon Woo's Class Placement Match?)

1495
01:09:47,781 --> 01:09:48,841
We are placing you in...

1496
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:56,681
(Which class has Kim Geon Woo been placed in?)

1497
01:10:03,721 --> 01:10:04,761
(Smiling)

1498
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:15,041
We are placing you in the All Star Class.

1499
01:10:15,141 --> 01:10:17,001
(Kim Geon Woo is placed in the All Star Class.)

1500
01:10:17,141 --> 01:10:18,941
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

1501
01:10:18,941 --> 01:10:20,011
We are placing you in the All Star Class.

1502
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:23,111
Congratulations.

1503
01:10:24,881 --> 01:10:27,051
We had a heated discussion based on your result.

1504
01:10:27,511 --> 01:10:29,651
He deserves to be a Two Star based on his dancing.

1505
01:10:29,721 --> 01:10:31,991
But his live singing was really good.

1506
01:10:31,991 --> 01:10:34,421
It was neat. He can take a role as a member.

1507
01:10:34,421 --> 01:10:36,961
- That is all we're looking for. - Right.

1508
01:10:37,061 --> 01:10:39,731
He feels like an idol star with his overall balance.

1509
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:42,301
Through the performances that you will show us...

1510
01:10:42,301 --> 01:10:44,131
in BOYS II PLANET,

1511
01:10:44,131 --> 01:10:47,431
I hope that you will bring out the charms that are within you.

1512
01:10:47,431 --> 01:10:49,171
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

1513
01:10:50,471 --> 01:10:51,511
Thank you.

1514
01:10:53,311 --> 01:10:56,111
I've plucked up my courage to be here...

1515
01:10:56,341 --> 01:10:59,951
and I think I've made a really good start.

1516
01:11:00,181 --> 01:11:01,551
I realized...

1517
01:11:02,481 --> 01:11:04,851
that I was still someone with a sense of worth.

1518
01:11:08,691 --> 01:11:11,691
He really felt like an idol star.

1519
01:11:13,131 --> 01:11:14,961
There needs to be an All Star from the experienced participants too.

1520
01:11:14,961 --> 01:11:16,331
(Feeling worried)

1521
01:11:17,261 --> 01:11:19,901
Two, three. Hello! From being hip prospects,

1522
01:11:19,971 --> 01:11:21,901
we want to become hip gentlemen as Choco1.

1523
01:11:22,571 --> 01:11:24,571
(Bowing)

1524
01:11:24,911 --> 01:11:26,741
Hello! From being hip prospects,

1525
01:11:26,741 --> 01:11:28,581
we want to become hip gentlemen as Choco1.

1526
01:11:28,681 --> 01:11:29,911
Let's practice our greeting.

1527
01:11:30,981 --> 01:11:32,511
(These two participants are strangely obsessed...)

1528
01:11:32,511 --> 01:11:34,051
(about their greeting.)

1529
01:11:34,051 --> 01:11:35,621
(Stuttering)

1530
01:11:36,021 --> 01:11:37,251
Do it again.

1531
01:11:37,721 --> 01:11:39,821
(2nd attempt)

1532
01:11:40,121 --> 01:11:43,291
(They continue to work on their greeting endlessly.)

1533
01:11:44,161 --> 01:11:45,591
- Two, three. Thank you. - Thank you.

1534
01:11:46,691 --> 01:11:49,301
(How will the slightly clumsy hip-hop duo do?)

1535
01:11:49,501 --> 01:11:51,031
We'll have the next participants.

1536
01:11:51,971 --> 01:11:53,101
(Experienced participant, Choco)

1537
01:11:53,101 --> 01:11:54,101
Choco?

1538
01:11:54,771 --> 01:11:55,971
Sounds delicious.

1539
01:11:57,241 --> 01:11:59,071
- Hello. - Hello.

1540
01:11:59,071 --> 01:12:00,471
- Gosh. - Hello.

1541
01:12:01,141 --> 01:12:02,881
- They look flashy. - Hello.

1542
01:12:02,881 --> 01:12:04,241
Oh, okay.

1543
01:12:05,011 --> 01:12:06,111
His hairstyle...

1544
01:12:07,581 --> 01:12:10,051
That's cute. He's a demon.

1545
01:12:10,681 --> 01:12:12,991
Gosh, their outfits are intense.

1546
01:12:13,321 --> 01:12:14,821
- Please introduce yourselves. - Right.

1547
01:12:15,491 --> 01:12:16,861
(Feeling nervous)

1548
01:12:18,631 --> 01:12:22,361
(They got it down after 50 attempts.)

1549
01:12:22,801 --> 01:12:24,331
We'll greet you. Two, three.

1550
01:12:24,331 --> 01:12:25,331
- Hello! - Hello!

1551
01:12:25,331 --> 01:12:27,031
From being hip prospects...

1552
01:12:27,131 --> 01:12:30,471
From being hip prospects...

1553
01:12:31,541 --> 01:12:35,111
(The hip prospects slowly wither away.)

1554
01:12:36,411 --> 01:12:37,811
Do it again! Hold on!

1555
01:12:37,981 --> 01:12:38,981
(Screaming)

1556
01:12:39,511 --> 01:12:42,081
- That was cute. - Choco1, Choco2!

1557
01:12:42,981 --> 01:12:44,181
That was cute.

1558
01:12:45,151 --> 01:12:46,221
We'll do it right away.

1559
01:12:46,921 --> 01:12:48,961
Ready, action!

1560
01:12:49,091 --> 01:12:50,521
- Two, three. Hello! - Hello!

1561
01:12:50,521 --> 01:12:51,531
- From... - From being...

1562
01:12:51,531 --> 01:12:52,661
(Failing again from the start)

1563
01:12:52,791 --> 01:12:56,161
- From... - From being hip-hop prospects...

1564
01:12:56,301 --> 01:12:58,371
We want to become hip-hop gentlemen as Choco1.

1565
01:12:58,371 --> 01:13:00,131
Born-to-be hip-hop, Yeom Ye Chan!

1566
01:13:01,271 --> 01:13:02,471
Oh, yes! Locking!

1567
01:13:02,471 --> 01:13:04,401
I'm locking hip-hop dancer, Kim Tae Jo.

1568
01:13:04,401 --> 01:13:06,611
- Two, three. Thank you. - Thank you.

1569
01:13:06,641 --> 01:13:08,041
Nice one!

1570
01:13:08,981 --> 01:13:11,651
Who are these guys?

1571
01:13:13,911 --> 01:13:15,851
How old are you two?

1572
01:13:16,121 --> 01:13:17,651
I was born in 2008.

1573
01:13:18,091 --> 01:13:19,121
What?

1574
01:13:19,151 --> 01:13:20,821
I was born in 2010.

1575
01:13:20,891 --> 01:13:22,121
(What?)

1576
01:13:22,221 --> 01:13:23,391
- What? - What?

1577
01:13:24,661 --> 01:13:25,891
That was yesterday.

1578
01:13:26,261 --> 01:13:28,231
At what age did you two make your debuts?

1579
01:13:28,431 --> 01:13:29,461
That's what I want to ask.

1580
01:13:29,701 --> 01:13:32,771
I did make my debut when I was in seventh grade.

1581
01:13:32,901 --> 01:13:34,031
- What? - What?

1582
01:13:35,941 --> 01:13:37,341
It's kind of funny to be this surprised.

1583
01:13:37,771 --> 01:13:39,241
You and I are too surprised.

1584
01:13:39,241 --> 01:13:40,611
(Covering the mouth)

1585
01:13:40,611 --> 01:13:41,641
Gosh.

1586
01:13:42,111 --> 01:13:43,111
(Gosh...)

1587
01:13:43,111 --> 01:13:44,311
They are babies.

1588
01:13:45,081 --> 01:13:46,181
They are young.

1589
01:13:47,651 --> 01:13:49,351
I debuted when I was in seventh grade.

1590
01:13:49,521 --> 01:13:51,121
But I don't think that was official.

1591
01:13:51,851 --> 01:13:53,891
In fact, we didn't debut officially...

1592
01:13:54,321 --> 01:13:57,821
(The first project-like performance on a music show was the last.)

1593
01:13:57,821 --> 01:14:00,461
It has been almost three years since we performed.

1594
01:14:01,531 --> 01:14:02,861
I'm not sure if I can do well.

1595
01:14:04,031 --> 01:14:06,901
Pre-debut is also a debut.

1596
01:14:07,831 --> 01:14:09,371
(Choco1 is performing in almost 3 years...)

1597
01:14:09,371 --> 01:14:11,641
(with the experienced participant title.)

1598
01:14:14,011 --> 01:14:15,611
Don't be discouraged without even trying.

1599
01:14:15,881 --> 01:14:17,911
I think you could do this with more confidence.

1600
01:14:18,451 --> 01:14:20,151
- Yes. - We'll show you.

1601
01:14:20,151 --> 01:14:21,351
(Their confidence is recharged with the Masters' encouragement.)

1602
01:14:21,351 --> 01:14:23,421
- Go for it. - Way to go.

1603
01:14:23,821 --> 01:14:24,921
Let's go.

1604
01:14:25,991 --> 01:14:27,191
Choco one, two.

1605
01:14:27,921 --> 01:14:31,121
(What performance will the youngest experienced participants show?)

1606
01:14:31,291 --> 01:14:34,391
I can understand why they made a mistake earlier in their greeting.

1607
01:14:34,661 --> 01:14:35,901
Now that I know their age.

1608
01:14:36,661 --> 01:14:39,171
Tae Jo is a kid who listened to Pororo a couple of years ago.

1609
01:14:39,331 --> 01:14:40,371
Gosh.

1610
01:14:41,031 --> 01:14:42,201
What do you think will happen?

1611
01:14:44,871 --> 01:14:46,711
We should also get All Star.

1612
01:14:47,871 --> 01:14:48,911
Let's go.

1613
01:14:49,641 --> 01:14:51,211
Come on Choco.

1614
01:14:52,651 --> 01:14:54,181
("HIP" by MAMAMOO)

1615
01:15:15,641 --> 01:15:16,841
Why does he have so much power?

1616
01:15:17,741 --> 01:15:19,341
- What is this? - Gosh. They are good.

1617
01:15:21,811 --> 01:15:22,911
Who are these guys?

1618
01:15:54,211 --> 01:15:55,381
Is this real?

1619
01:15:56,941 --> 01:15:58,411
- They are amazing. - I got goosebumps.

1620
01:16:04,951 --> 01:16:06,891
- This is mad. - They are crazy.

1621
01:16:18,171 --> 01:16:21,271
(Class Placement Match)

1622
01:16:23,641 --> 01:16:24,671
What is this?

1623
01:16:25,111 --> 01:16:26,541
- This is mad. - This is mad.

1624
01:16:27,111 --> 01:16:28,411
- This is crazy. - This is crazy.

1625
01:16:28,411 --> 01:16:29,581
Don't they deserve All Star?

1626
01:16:29,581 --> 01:16:31,081
- I think this could be All Star. - This is All Star.

1627
01:16:31,311 --> 01:16:32,751
- They sing well. - They're good at singing, rapping,

1628
01:16:32,751 --> 01:16:34,151
even their dancing is powerful.

1629
01:16:34,311 --> 01:16:35,921
- They're good. - There weren't any minor moves.

1630
01:16:35,921 --> 01:16:37,121
Did they mumble on purpose?

1631
01:16:37,121 --> 01:16:38,121
(Reasonable doubt)

1632
01:16:38,121 --> 01:16:39,821
Looking at you,

1633
01:16:39,921 --> 01:16:43,261
it seems that you have great dancing skills.

1634
01:16:43,261 --> 01:16:45,361
You would have been out of breath,

1635
01:16:45,361 --> 01:16:48,801
but you rapped as such while dancing like that.

1636
01:16:48,801 --> 01:16:50,101
(Nailed the rap with powerful dance moves)

1637
01:16:50,531 --> 01:16:52,071
I want to dance like that.

1638
01:16:52,801 --> 01:16:55,341
- Me too. - I'll never dance like that ever.

1639
01:16:56,801 --> 01:16:59,011
Your rap was great, really.

1640
01:16:59,041 --> 01:17:01,641
If you could rap to this extent at this age...

1641
01:17:01,641 --> 01:17:03,211
and perform this well...

1642
01:17:04,281 --> 01:17:06,781
I can't dare imagine how far you can go.

1643
01:17:06,911 --> 01:17:08,181
- It was a great stage. - Thank you.

1644
01:17:08,181 --> 01:17:09,221
Thank you.

1645
01:17:09,881 --> 01:17:10,951
Thank you.

1646
01:17:11,591 --> 01:17:14,551
We will announce the classes for Team Choco1.

1647
01:17:15,621 --> 01:17:17,621
- Participant Yeom Ye Chan. - Yes.

1648
01:17:18,931 --> 01:17:20,991
Participant Yeom Ye Chan, we are placing you...

1649
01:17:21,561 --> 01:17:22,631
All Star?

1650
01:17:23,131 --> 01:17:24,601
- All Star. - All Star.

1651
01:17:26,171 --> 01:17:28,071
- in All Star Class. - Thank you.

1652
01:17:29,201 --> 01:17:30,741
(The first All Star from the experienced participants is born.)

1653
01:17:32,241 --> 01:17:33,311
Thank you.

1654
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,741
We have an All Star from our group.

1655
01:17:35,341 --> 01:17:37,011
Yeom Ye Chan is mad.

1656
01:17:37,011 --> 01:17:38,551
His rap is crazy.

1657
01:17:39,181 --> 01:17:41,011
Participant Kim Tae Jo, we are placing you...

1658
01:17:41,351 --> 01:17:42,721
I think he will get All Star.

1659
01:17:43,121 --> 01:17:45,751
Tae Jo did so well with his singing at the beginning.

1660
01:17:46,491 --> 01:17:47,691
(Participant Kim Tae Jo's vocal...)

1661
01:17:47,691 --> 01:17:48,921
(caught people's ears from the beginning.)

1662
01:17:49,391 --> 01:17:50,421
All Star?

1663
01:17:51,691 --> 01:17:53,231
Congratulations. We are placing you in All Star Class.

1664
01:17:53,231 --> 01:17:55,661
(Kim Tae Jo receives All Star)

1665
01:17:55,661 --> 01:17:57,661
Thank you.

1666
01:18:00,771 --> 01:18:03,401
(The experienced participants are congratulating...)

1667
01:18:03,401 --> 01:18:04,971
(the first All Star Class together.)

1668
01:18:05,871 --> 01:18:07,041
Gosh. Both of them got All Star.

1669
01:18:07,041 --> 01:18:08,281
(Kim Tae Jo and Yeon Ye Chan: All Star Class)

1670
01:18:08,281 --> 01:18:09,781
- Thank you. - Congratulations.

1671
01:18:09,781 --> 01:18:11,241
Since both you received the All Star Class,

1672
01:18:11,241 --> 01:18:13,111
why don't you...

1673
01:18:14,681 --> 01:18:16,721
do the greeting once more to celebrate?

1674
01:18:16,721 --> 01:18:17,881
The one you kept on getting wrong.

1675
01:18:17,881 --> 01:18:18,951
We are the future hip-hop...

1676
01:18:19,191 --> 01:18:21,121
(The only flaw in their performance today)

1677
01:18:21,351 --> 01:18:22,691
Do that before you leave the stage.

1678
01:18:22,691 --> 01:18:23,821
(A golden opportunity to make up for the mistake)

1679
01:18:24,661 --> 01:18:25,791
What was it?

1680
01:18:26,131 --> 01:18:27,361
Two, three, hello.

1681
01:18:27,531 --> 01:18:30,131
And then it was aspiring...

1682
01:18:30,301 --> 01:18:31,361
They forgot.

1683
01:18:31,531 --> 01:18:33,331
They didn't forget the rap, but they forgot that.

1684
01:18:33,701 --> 01:18:35,841
The man who fears self-introduction more than rapping.

1685
01:18:36,041 --> 01:18:37,101
Yeon Ye Chan.

1686
01:18:37,101 --> 01:18:38,441
(He turned his back on the master and is doing a special training.)

1687
01:18:38,611 --> 01:18:40,611
(The tension is like something before the final stage.)

1688
01:18:40,911 --> 01:18:42,181
Let's see if they are good this time.

1689
01:18:42,841 --> 01:18:44,441
Two, three. Hello.

1690
01:18:44,681 --> 01:18:46,311
From a hip aspiring...

1691
01:18:46,711 --> 01:18:48,551
Hip Choco Entertainment...

1692
01:18:48,981 --> 01:18:50,051
Choco1... Yes.

1693
01:18:50,921 --> 01:18:52,691
(Laughing)

1694
01:18:52,991 --> 01:18:54,151
Choco1...

1695
01:18:56,291 --> 01:18:57,291
(Leave immediately.)

1696
01:18:57,291 --> 01:18:58,731
Please leave the stage.

1697
01:18:59,061 --> 01:19:01,191
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1698
01:19:01,661 --> 01:19:02,731
Gosh.

1699
01:19:05,031 --> 01:19:06,601
(Their exiting timing is perfect.)

1700
01:19:07,931 --> 01:19:09,241
Good. It turned out the way I wanted.

1701
01:19:09,401 --> 01:19:12,071
(Becoming a fan of Choco1, completed)

1702
01:19:12,941 --> 01:19:15,441
Everyone enjoy your meal, and then we will resume with filming.

1703
01:19:15,441 --> 01:19:16,681
(A sweet mealtime amidst the heated Class Placement Match)

1704
01:19:17,281 --> 01:19:18,751
- It's food. - It's food.

1705
01:19:18,751 --> 01:19:21,351
- It's food. - Everyone, enjoy.

1706
01:19:21,781 --> 01:19:22,781
(Experienced participants' waiting room)

1707
01:19:22,781 --> 01:19:24,251
You must feel relieved now that you're done.

1708
01:19:24,721 --> 01:19:26,191
No, I don't feel relieved.

1709
01:19:27,291 --> 01:19:29,161
What stage are you looking forward to?

1710
01:19:29,661 --> 01:19:31,121
Looking forward? Wouldn't that be the same for everyone?

1711
01:19:31,421 --> 01:19:32,831
Isn't it Yumeki's performance?

1712
01:19:33,561 --> 01:19:35,301
- Right. - That's right.

1713
01:19:35,301 --> 01:19:37,101
- I'm curious. - Seriously. I so agree.

1714
01:19:38,371 --> 01:19:39,631
(Trainee and Regular participants' waiting room)

1715
01:19:39,631 --> 01:19:41,101
I always wanted to learn.

1716
01:19:41,701 --> 01:19:43,771
How's the food? Is everyone okay with it?

1717
01:19:43,971 --> 01:19:45,371
How was the performance? Was it fun?

1718
01:19:45,641 --> 01:19:47,611
It's not my first. English is my first language.

1719
01:19:47,611 --> 01:19:48,911
But I got better at Korean.

1720
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:55,581
(Two people are taking a seat in the corner.)

1721
01:19:55,921 --> 01:19:57,021
It was great.

1722
01:19:57,321 --> 01:19:59,151
It's more comfortable to talk here, so it's good.

1723
01:20:04,291 --> 01:20:06,791
(They are not on mute.)

1724
01:20:06,931 --> 01:20:09,001
- Did you know you were before him? - No, I didn't.

1725
01:20:09,461 --> 01:20:12,271
(They are not on mute.)

1726
01:20:12,831 --> 01:20:14,901
(Loud)

1727
01:20:15,641 --> 01:20:18,171
(They are not on mute. Introverts' mealtime)

1728
01:20:18,171 --> 01:20:19,541
We are definitely introverts.

1729
01:20:26,011 --> 01:20:29,451
I didn't speak with other guys.

1730
01:20:30,121 --> 01:20:32,021
I was nervous, that's why.

1731
01:20:35,061 --> 01:20:38,091
There were a lot of amazing people than I thought.

1732
01:20:40,491 --> 01:20:44,061
I was worried about the kind of performance I could show.

1733
01:20:45,431 --> 01:20:46,601
I'm so scared.

1734
01:20:49,041 --> 01:20:51,541
(So their mealtime ended in silence.)

1735
01:20:51,871 --> 01:20:54,841
(What will be the fate of these two people?)

1736
01:20:55,241 --> 01:20:56,811
Next participant, please come on stage.

1737
01:20:57,711 --> 01:20:58,911
(FNC Entertainment)

1738
01:20:58,911 --> 01:21:00,051
FNC Entertainment?

1739
01:21:00,411 --> 01:21:01,611
- It's FNC Entertainment. - Gosh. It's FNC Entertainment.

1740
01:21:01,611 --> 01:21:03,121
FNC Entertainment.

1741
01:21:03,121 --> 01:21:04,251
Really?

1742
01:21:04,721 --> 01:21:06,591
(FNC Entertainment has created FTISLAND,)

1743
01:21:06,591 --> 01:21:08,221
(CNBLUE,)

1744
01:21:08,221 --> 01:21:10,121
(AOA)

1745
01:21:10,121 --> 01:21:11,791
(SF9,)

1746
01:21:11,791 --> 01:21:14,061
(and P1Harmony.)

1747
01:21:14,431 --> 01:21:17,201
FNC Entertainment is a company with a history.

1748
01:21:20,701 --> 01:21:22,241
They are from FNC Entertainment?

1749
01:21:22,701 --> 01:21:24,301
They are cute.

1750
01:21:25,811 --> 01:21:27,341
(He opened his curtain of bangs.)

1751
01:21:27,911 --> 01:21:28,981
They are cute.

1752
01:21:30,081 --> 01:21:31,911
Chuei Li Yu is good-looking.

1753
01:21:34,451 --> 01:21:36,151
I saw Li Yu somewhere.

1754
01:21:37,221 --> 01:21:39,621
(Where did I see him?)

1755
01:21:40,321 --> 01:21:41,521
(What is the identity of...)

1756
01:21:41,521 --> 01:21:43,261
(Participant Chuei Li Yu from FNC?)

1757
01:21:43,621 --> 01:21:45,191
(Shoot the light, Solar)

1758
01:21:45,591 --> 01:21:48,761
(The man behind the pre-released mood poster)

1759
01:21:48,761 --> 01:21:50,061
(- I like you. - Why are you doing this do me?)

1760
01:21:50,061 --> 01:21:52,601
(Participant Chuei Li Yu...)

1761
01:21:52,601 --> 01:21:55,101
(gathered attention with his looks.)

1762
01:21:55,741 --> 01:21:57,071
I'm waking up.

1763
01:21:57,371 --> 01:21:59,411
Chuei Li Yu is really good-looking.

1764
01:22:00,911 --> 01:22:04,341
I'm really curious to know if you have the skills to match your looks.

1765
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:06,481
Please get ready for your performance.

1766
01:22:07,011 --> 01:22:08,251
I can't help but look forward.

1767
01:22:09,881 --> 01:22:10,881
Let's go.

1768
01:22:10,881 --> 01:22:11,991
(Will they satisfy everyone's expectations?)

1769
01:22:13,351 --> 01:22:16,691
("If I'm S, Can You Be My N?" by Chuei Li Yu and Kenshiro)

1770
01:23:23,521 --> 01:23:24,561
That was cute.

1771
01:23:24,921 --> 01:23:26,831
Their pitch was a bit flat.

1772
01:23:27,661 --> 01:23:28,661
Thank you.

1773
01:23:30,801 --> 01:23:32,301
Well... It was like...

1774
01:23:34,771 --> 01:23:36,271
It was like...

1775
01:23:39,471 --> 01:23:41,511
a diligently-prepared...

1776
01:23:45,251 --> 01:23:47,911
dance cover team.

1777
01:23:48,581 --> 01:23:50,581
The skills were very lacking.

1778
01:23:53,091 --> 01:23:55,721
The pitches were all over the place.

1779
01:23:57,791 --> 01:24:00,191
Still, within the group,

1780
01:24:00,691 --> 01:24:03,561
Chuei Li Yu stood out the most.

1781
01:24:04,531 --> 01:24:07,631
Strangely, his pitch was correct for the highest notes.

1782
01:24:14,171 --> 01:24:16,011
(How strange!)

1783
01:24:16,211 --> 01:24:17,981
His voice wavered for the lower notes,

1784
01:24:17,981 --> 01:24:19,751
but his pitch was correct for the highest notes.

1785
01:24:20,151 --> 01:24:22,121
If he goes through more detailed training,

1786
01:24:22,121 --> 01:24:24,151
he'll be able to become a better vocalist.

1787
01:24:24,151 --> 01:24:25,181
We enjoyed the performance.

1788
01:24:25,721 --> 01:24:27,251
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1789
01:24:28,761 --> 01:24:30,391
We'll announce the result.

1790
01:24:30,661 --> 01:24:33,891
Kenshiro and Chuei Li Yu.

1791
01:24:33,891 --> 01:24:35,561
(What's Kenshiro and Chuei Li Yu's class?)

1792
01:24:36,831 --> 01:24:37,831
One Star.

1793
01:24:37,831 --> 01:24:39,931
- Thank you. - Thank you for your hard work.

1794
01:24:40,531 --> 01:24:42,801
If you want an extra test,

1795
01:24:42,801 --> 01:24:44,501
talk among yourselves and let us know.

1796
01:24:45,001 --> 01:24:46,811
I don't think they'll want it.

1797
01:24:47,011 --> 01:24:49,541
They'll be torn since they both got One Star.

1798
01:24:50,841 --> 01:24:51,841
What should we do?

1799
01:24:52,481 --> 01:24:53,481
What should we do?

1800
01:24:54,251 --> 01:24:56,381
An extra test comes with a risk.

1801
01:24:56,381 --> 01:24:57,621
- That's right. It does. - Yes.

1802
01:24:58,351 --> 01:25:00,891
(The result of the extra test...)

1803
01:25:00,891 --> 01:25:03,561
(could get them eliminated with No Star.)

1804
01:25:03,561 --> 01:25:05,121
Since you got One Star,

1805
01:25:05,121 --> 01:25:07,961
an extra test could be dangerous.

1806
01:25:11,901 --> 01:25:13,871
We're going to be more strict.

1807
01:25:15,201 --> 01:25:16,401
Think it through.

1808
01:25:19,041 --> 01:25:22,281
The decision to give you 1 Star was made with a score of 4 to 3.

1809
01:25:24,681 --> 01:25:28,481
(What will be the decision of Chuei Li Yu and Kenshiro?)

1810
01:25:30,821 --> 01:25:33,291
(A bit later, the two of them come down the stage.)

1811
01:25:34,321 --> 01:25:37,121
(Which decision did they make?)

1812
01:25:43,601 --> 01:25:45,801
(Chuei Li Yu and Kenshiro, 1 Star)

1813
01:25:45,901 --> 01:25:48,301
In the end, we didn't take an extra test.

1814
01:25:50,541 --> 01:25:51,801
I was very disappointed.

1815
01:25:53,041 --> 01:25:56,611
Had I plucked up my courage, my current situation...

1816
01:25:58,541 --> 01:26:00,081
could've been different.

1817
01:26:02,381 --> 01:26:05,891
If you get One Star, it might be better to forgo it.

1818
01:26:06,451 --> 01:26:08,521
If I get One Star, I'd take an extra test.

1819
01:26:08,761 --> 01:26:10,121
- If you get One Star? - Yes.

1820
01:26:10,121 --> 01:26:11,591
You go home if you lose a star.

1821
01:26:13,031 --> 01:26:14,731
If I get No Star, you'd have to take it.

1822
01:26:16,601 --> 01:26:18,231
(As the Class Placement Match determines the participants' fate,)

1823
01:26:18,231 --> 01:26:19,971
(their anxiey regarding elimination grows.)

1824
01:26:20,531 --> 01:26:21,931
Next participant, please come on out.

1825
01:26:23,441 --> 01:26:24,901
GREAT M?

1826
01:26:25,371 --> 01:26:27,411
We're meeting all the agencies.

1827
01:26:29,111 --> 01:26:30,611
(Shouting)

1828
01:26:30,641 --> 01:26:31,641
Oh, my.

1829
01:26:33,251 --> 01:26:34,481
(Shouting)

1830
01:26:34,481 --> 01:26:36,381
- Hello. - Hello.

1831
01:26:36,381 --> 01:26:37,621
(They shout loudly as they enter.)

1832
01:26:38,281 --> 01:26:39,291
They startled me.

1833
01:26:41,121 --> 01:26:43,521
- They have the fighting spirit. - They're energetic. It's nice.

1834
01:26:44,691 --> 01:26:47,161
Yoon Chan and Nu Ri. Two months? Four months?

1835
01:26:48,491 --> 01:26:50,431
Has he only been a trainee for two months?

1836
01:26:51,661 --> 01:26:54,571
(He shouted loudly during the preliminary audition.)

1837
01:26:54,571 --> 01:26:56,171
I came to Seoul with everything on the line.

1838
01:26:56,171 --> 01:26:57,741
I'm the man who never gives up,

1839
01:26:57,841 --> 01:26:59,771
Park Nu Ri!

1840
01:26:59,871 --> 01:27:02,141
I'll survive with this spirit.

1841
01:27:02,841 --> 01:27:03,981
(Preliminary promotion shoot)

1842
01:27:03,981 --> 01:27:05,111
(The very best, Park Nu Ri)

1843
01:27:05,811 --> 01:27:09,421
So that sweat will fall from my face instead of water,

1844
01:27:09,421 --> 01:27:11,481
I'll give good performances.

1845
01:27:11,821 --> 01:27:13,421
(Shouting)

1846
01:27:13,891 --> 01:27:16,221
(The trainee of 2 months, Park Nu Ri is full of spirit.)

1847
01:27:18,491 --> 01:27:19,691
Let's prepare for the stage.

1848
01:27:21,361 --> 01:27:22,401
I think they'll do well.

1849
01:27:23,501 --> 01:27:24,501
- Good luck. - Let's see.

1850
01:27:24,861 --> 01:27:27,601
(How will the performance by the passionate Park Nu Ri turn out?)

1851
01:27:28,871 --> 01:27:31,601
("Candy" by Park Nu Ri and Lee Yoon Chan)

1852
01:27:58,731 --> 01:28:00,131
His voice is really nice.

1853
01:28:16,221 --> 01:28:19,791
(Park Nu Ri doesn't sing during his part.)

1854
01:28:20,421 --> 01:28:21,791
You can't hear him, right?

1855
01:28:21,891 --> 01:28:25,121
(Park Nu Ri doesn't sing the chorus together.)

1856
01:28:28,231 --> 01:28:31,231
(Lee Yoon Chan's singing wraps up the performance.)

1857
01:28:34,201 --> 01:28:35,571
I think he was out of tune.

1858
01:28:36,401 --> 01:28:37,871
Yoon Chan,

1859
01:28:40,071 --> 01:28:42,381
- you're good at singing live. - Thank you.

1860
01:28:42,381 --> 01:28:44,681
- Your voice and tone are nice. - Thank you.

1861
01:28:45,441 --> 01:28:50,021
However, Nu Ri's vocals made me go...

1862
01:28:57,221 --> 01:28:59,861
However, Nu Ri's vocals made me go,

1863
01:29:02,701 --> 01:29:05,301
"Will he be able to become a singer?"

1864
01:29:05,301 --> 01:29:07,731
It made me think that.

1865
01:29:11,541 --> 01:29:13,911
Your position is a vocalist.

1866
01:29:14,411 --> 01:29:15,411
Me?

1867
01:29:17,081 --> 01:29:18,081
Isn't it?

1868
01:29:22,111 --> 01:29:24,951
I'm a visual.

1869
01:29:36,501 --> 01:29:39,231
I see. All right. Okay.

1870
01:29:42,471 --> 01:29:45,741
I rarely become speechless. I was so startled.

1871
01:29:52,311 --> 01:29:55,181
In any case, Nu Ri, you're here...

1872
01:29:55,181 --> 01:29:56,721
to become a singer, right?

1873
01:29:58,151 --> 01:30:00,191
Nu Ri, although you're here,

1874
01:30:00,291 --> 01:30:03,821
this isn't a stage anyone can enter easily.

1875
01:30:06,031 --> 01:30:07,691
It's a place that requires seriousness.

1876
01:30:12,771 --> 01:30:14,471
Isn't that right?

1877
01:30:18,441 --> 01:30:21,741
It's the strongest feedback we've heard today.

1878
01:30:22,811 --> 01:30:24,081
Give us some time to discuss among ourselves.

1879
01:30:27,251 --> 01:30:29,081
I saw an aspect I really didn't like.

1880
01:30:29,651 --> 01:30:31,251
- Nu Ri? - Yes.

1881
01:30:32,591 --> 01:30:34,621
(I'm a visual.)

1882
01:30:37,661 --> 01:30:39,291
(Sucking in a breath)

1883
01:30:39,991 --> 01:30:41,731
This is driving me crazy.

1884
01:30:43,461 --> 01:30:47,101
We'll announce the classes for Team GREAT M.

1885
01:30:47,371 --> 01:30:49,801
Lee Yoon Chan's class is...

1886
01:30:53,141 --> 01:30:55,571
- One Star. - Thank you.

1887
01:30:55,571 --> 01:30:56,641
(Lee Yoon Chan, 1 Star)

1888
01:30:57,581 --> 01:30:59,351
Now, Park Nu Ri.

1889
01:30:59,651 --> 01:31:01,751
Park Nu Ri's class is...

1890
01:31:02,781 --> 01:31:03,851
What is it?

1891
01:31:09,421 --> 01:31:11,591
Park Nu Ri's class is...

1892
01:31:12,991 --> 01:31:14,961
(Park Nu Ri)

1893
01:31:14,961 --> 01:31:16,061
No Star.

1894
01:31:16,061 --> 01:31:17,461
(Park Nu Ri, No Star)

1895
01:31:17,461 --> 01:31:18,531
No Star.

1896
01:31:19,301 --> 01:31:21,371
(Since it's the first No Star,)

1897
01:31:21,371 --> 01:31:24,801
(participants become shocked.)

1898
01:31:25,571 --> 01:31:27,371
Bro, what?

1899
01:31:27,471 --> 01:31:28,541
That's crazy.

1900
01:31:28,641 --> 01:31:29,811
No Star.

1901
01:31:35,311 --> 01:31:38,991
Discuss among yourselves about an extra test and let us know.

1902
01:31:38,991 --> 01:31:40,291
(If they don't take an extra test,)

1903
01:31:40,291 --> 01:31:41,621
(Park Nu Ri will get eliminated with No Star.)

1904
01:31:41,621 --> 01:31:43,391
(But if they take an extra test,)

1905
01:31:43,491 --> 01:31:46,591
(Lee Yoon Chan will face the danger of becoming No Star.)

1906
01:31:47,791 --> 01:31:48,831
What do you want to do?

1907
01:31:49,461 --> 01:31:51,031
- I think we should do it. - Okay.

1908
01:31:51,031 --> 01:31:52,031
All right.

1909
01:31:53,201 --> 01:31:56,501
We'll take an extra test.

1910
01:31:57,571 --> 01:31:59,011
(Extra test)

1911
01:31:59,011 --> 01:32:03,241
(He decided to take an extra test to save Nu Ri from elimination.)

1912
01:32:03,241 --> 01:32:06,481
It'll be hard to move up a class through an extra test.

1913
01:32:06,911 --> 01:32:09,821
They'll need to show a completely different side.

1914
01:32:14,891 --> 01:32:17,661
("Lie" by Park Nu Ri and Lee Yoon Chan)

1915
01:32:18,991 --> 01:32:20,461
They'll show their vocals.

1916
01:33:07,171 --> 01:33:08,641
I think his voice is gone.

1917
01:33:09,011 --> 01:33:10,441
What is he going to do? Seriously.

1918
01:33:23,961 --> 01:33:26,031
We'll announce the classes...

1919
01:33:26,031 --> 01:33:27,991
after the extra test.

1920
01:33:28,291 --> 01:33:31,561
Park Nu Ri's class is...

1921
01:33:32,031 --> 01:33:34,371
By any chance,

1922
01:33:36,441 --> 01:33:40,011
may I just say one thing?

1923
01:33:52,851 --> 01:33:55,191
As I got very nervous during the performance,

1924
01:33:55,751 --> 01:33:56,861
I...

1925
01:33:58,491 --> 01:33:59,661
He might burst into tears.

1926
01:34:00,261 --> 01:34:01,291
Oh, no.

1927
01:34:02,731 --> 01:34:05,361
I didn't do so well.

1928
01:34:08,671 --> 01:34:11,271
If you could give me one more chance as One Star...

1929
01:34:11,701 --> 01:34:15,911
If you could give me one more chance...

1930
01:34:19,011 --> 01:34:21,981
I will practice much harder than anyone else here.

1931
01:34:29,861 --> 01:34:30,991
How shall I put it?

1932
01:34:33,831 --> 01:34:38,361
We can't decide based on your plea.

1933
01:34:38,361 --> 01:34:40,571
We will make an accurate judgment.

1934
01:34:41,631 --> 01:34:44,801
(The Masters start discussing to decide the class.)

1935
01:34:45,741 --> 01:34:46,811
I don't know,

1936
01:34:47,141 --> 01:34:49,411
but the story and the desperation...

1937
01:34:49,411 --> 01:34:52,081
I don't care about the story or the desperation.

1938
01:34:52,181 --> 01:34:55,011
I didn't say that I'll change.

1939
01:34:55,011 --> 01:34:56,851
I'd like to give him another chance.

1940
01:34:57,051 --> 01:34:58,981
We'd be giving him a chance out of pity.

1941
01:34:59,791 --> 01:35:01,321
- That's true. - Right.

1942
01:35:01,591 --> 01:35:05,021
(The Masters have a lot on their mind.)

1943
01:35:08,331 --> 01:35:09,731
Our discussion is over.

1944
01:35:10,261 --> 01:35:11,801
I don't think he'll be No Star.

1945
01:35:11,801 --> 01:35:13,271
I think he'll stay No Star.

1946
01:35:13,371 --> 01:35:15,271
Participant Park Nu Ri's class was...

1947
01:35:16,001 --> 01:35:17,141
No Star.

1948
01:35:19,571 --> 01:35:22,171
I'll announce his class after the extra test.

1949
01:35:22,411 --> 01:35:25,811
Participant Park Nu Ri's class is...

1950
01:35:33,591 --> 01:35:35,651
No Star. There's no change in your class.

1951
01:35:35,651 --> 01:35:36,691
Well done.

1952
01:35:37,821 --> 01:35:39,631
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1953
01:35:39,631 --> 01:35:41,161
Good job.

1954
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:44,001
(Park Nu Ri, No Star)

1955
01:35:44,001 --> 01:35:45,971
He's the first No Star.

1956
01:35:47,271 --> 01:35:48,271
- So soon... - Just like that?

1957
01:35:49,441 --> 01:35:51,101
Is he eliminated so soon?

1958
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:53,741
Does he have to pack up and go home?

1959
01:35:54,341 --> 01:35:56,981
I'd feel very upset if I got eliminated now.

1960
01:35:59,281 --> 01:36:01,681
(Park Nu Ri's suitcase is waiting for him.)

1961
01:36:01,681 --> 01:36:04,521
(Let's go, Park Nu Ri.)

1962
01:36:08,591 --> 01:36:10,491
As it was my first performance,

1963
01:36:10,661 --> 01:36:12,731
I was extremely nervous.

1964
01:36:17,161 --> 01:36:18,431
You've done very well.

1965
01:36:20,701 --> 01:36:23,101
My heart was beating fast, and my hands were shaking.

1966
01:36:24,741 --> 01:36:28,071
I think I made a lot of mistakes.

1967
01:36:31,581 --> 01:36:34,251
Based on what I know of him, I'd like to place him somewhere.

1968
01:36:34,711 --> 01:36:37,251
If he had potential,

1969
01:36:37,251 --> 01:36:39,421
I'd be willing to train him.

1970
01:36:39,421 --> 01:36:40,821
His potential didn't come through.

1971
01:36:43,761 --> 01:36:45,891
(I will practice as hard as Nu Ri.)

1972
01:36:45,891 --> 01:36:47,431
(Let's go, Park Nu Ri.)

1973
01:36:47,431 --> 01:36:48,561
I'm getting scared.

1974
01:36:49,061 --> 01:36:50,631
I hope none of us will be No Star.

1975
01:36:50,901 --> 01:36:52,801
(I will shine.)

1976
01:36:53,071 --> 01:36:55,431
(The next performance is...)

1977
01:36:55,631 --> 01:36:57,041
Could it be "Here I Am?"

1978
01:36:58,641 --> 01:37:03,911
(The signal song from "Boys Planet," "Here I Am")

1979
01:37:08,251 --> 01:37:09,281
It brings back memories.

1980
01:37:09,621 --> 01:37:10,821
I haven't seen it in a long time.

1981
01:37:28,071 --> 01:37:29,441
(The choreographer of "Here I Am")

1982
01:37:59,401 --> 01:38:01,531
What? What is he doing?

1983
01:38:06,471 --> 01:38:07,511
What is he doing?

1984
01:38:30,331 --> 01:38:32,501
Thank you.

1985
01:38:33,631 --> 01:38:35,471
- Is it over? - Is it over?

1986
01:38:35,531 --> 01:38:37,671
- Oh, okay. - Thank you.

1987
01:38:41,641 --> 01:38:42,911
(Sniffling)

1988
01:38:45,411 --> 01:38:48,511
I thought that the music stopped in the middle of it.

1989
01:38:52,381 --> 01:38:54,791
(Staring blankly)

1990
01:38:55,551 --> 01:38:59,221
You should've winked or something.

1991
01:39:00,591 --> 01:39:02,761
How could you end while standing there?

1992
01:39:04,461 --> 01:39:06,531
We'll announce your class.

1993
01:39:10,771 --> 01:39:15,341
(The participants are leaving with their suitcase.)

1994
01:39:16,581 --> 01:39:17,641
You're No Star.

1995
01:39:17,641 --> 01:39:19,211
(Kim Won Bin, Moon Suhn Bin, and Kim Min Jun are all No Star.)

1996
01:39:19,751 --> 01:39:21,181
This is brutal.

1997
01:39:21,781 --> 01:39:23,621
Suddenly, I'm worried about us.

1998
01:39:24,181 --> 01:39:25,281
I'm scared of becoming No Star.

1999
01:39:26,991 --> 01:39:29,861
(Team Seoul A prepared "Say My Name" from Season 1.)

2000
01:39:35,231 --> 01:39:38,401
Compared to buskers on the streets,

2001
01:39:38,401 --> 01:39:40,001
you're worse than them.

2002
01:39:40,401 --> 01:39:41,531
You're No Star.

2003
01:39:44,841 --> 01:39:49,011
(The performances continue.)

2004
01:39:55,811 --> 01:39:56,851
This is a mess.

2005
01:39:57,721 --> 01:39:59,591
Who was the worst one?

2006
01:39:59,651 --> 01:40:01,351
All of them were bad. No one was better than the other.

2007
01:40:01,421 --> 01:40:03,621
To be honest, I'd give all of them zero.

2008
01:40:06,361 --> 01:40:08,031
Did anyone stand out to you?

2009
01:40:08,031 --> 01:40:09,901
No, they had no charm at all.

2010
01:40:10,261 --> 01:40:12,061
When I heard you sing,

2011
01:40:12,731 --> 01:40:15,701
I was reminded of a performance at Migliore in Dongdaemun.

2012
01:40:16,941 --> 01:40:18,071
You're No Star.

2013
01:40:20,311 --> 01:40:22,741
(While more and more are getting eliminated)

2014
01:40:24,241 --> 01:40:26,141
(An experienced participant appears.)

2015
01:40:26,141 --> 01:40:27,281
An experienced participant.

2016
01:40:27,411 --> 01:40:30,081
(How will Thanatorn of The Wind perform?)

2017
01:40:39,661 --> 01:40:42,531
We're placing Thanatorn, the experienced participant...

2018
01:40:43,231 --> 01:40:44,501
in the No Star Class.

2019
01:40:45,731 --> 01:40:46,931
(Kwon Gyu Hyung, Park Ji Min)

2020
01:40:47,331 --> 01:40:48,531
So many people got eliminated.

2021
01:40:48,531 --> 01:40:49,601
(Shin Jae Ha, Lee Won Woo, Cho Myeong Su, Yoo Ki Won)

2022
01:40:49,601 --> 01:40:51,001
(Thanatorn)

2023
01:40:51,501 --> 01:40:53,371
It's much more merciless...

2024
01:40:53,941 --> 01:40:55,011
than last year.

2025
01:40:56,811 --> 01:40:59,141
This time, it's very scary.

2026
01:40:59,611 --> 01:41:01,711
The passing criteria are extremely tough.

2027
01:41:02,481 --> 01:41:04,081
Their standards are so high.

2028
01:41:07,091 --> 01:41:09,491
(Meanwhile, behind the stage)

2029
01:41:10,091 --> 01:41:11,221
We're placing you in the No Star Class.

2030
01:41:12,291 --> 01:41:13,631
(Smiling)

2031
01:41:14,631 --> 01:41:16,361
(While participants are getting eliminated,)

2032
01:41:16,361 --> 01:41:18,961
(this participant keeps his cool.)

2033
01:41:19,261 --> 01:41:21,931
(Who is he?)

2034
01:41:22,201 --> 01:41:25,571
(Coming up soon)

2035
01:41:32,311 --> 01:41:33,311
Let's go.

2036
01:41:33,511 --> 01:41:36,781
(What kind of skills will he show?)

2037
01:41:37,281 --> 01:41:38,351
(Participant, Daegu)

2038
01:41:38,351 --> 01:41:39,421
"Daegu?"

2039
01:41:40,291 --> 01:41:43,191
(He appears with a warm welcome.)

2040
01:41:45,421 --> 01:41:47,131
He's giving off a serious vibe.

2041
01:41:47,131 --> 01:41:48,631
He seems manly.

2042
01:41:48,631 --> 01:41:49,731
He looks dignified.

2043
01:41:54,001 --> 01:41:55,071
Hello.

2044
01:41:56,001 --> 01:41:58,471
(His gentle and low voice surprises them.)

2045
01:41:58,471 --> 01:42:01,341
I'm an 18-year-old man from Daegu. I'm Baek Jae Hyeon.

2046
01:42:03,341 --> 01:42:04,441
Nice to meet you.

2047
01:42:05,711 --> 01:42:07,081
He's so tough.

2048
01:42:07,481 --> 01:42:09,821
Are you confident about doing well today?

2049
01:42:09,821 --> 01:42:12,921
I'm always ready.

2050
01:42:13,251 --> 01:42:16,461
(Everyone is in awe with his dignified spirit.)

2051
01:42:16,591 --> 01:42:19,561
All right, let's take a look at what you've got.

2052
01:42:22,791 --> 01:42:23,831
His tone of voice...

2053
01:42:24,031 --> 01:42:26,671
Yes, he sounds exactly like a rapper.

2054
01:42:29,601 --> 01:42:31,271
The edge of his hand looks unusual.

2055
01:42:31,271 --> 01:42:33,741
Yes, there must be something to it.

2056
01:42:35,571 --> 01:42:38,481
("Chk Chk Boom" by Baek Jae Hyeon)

2057
01:43:36,471 --> 01:43:37,801
Let's go!

2058
01:43:38,741 --> 01:43:40,441
Hey! Come on!

2059
01:43:41,071 --> 01:43:42,341
Come on!

2060
01:43:42,741 --> 01:43:43,981
Come on!

2061
01:43:46,181 --> 01:43:47,351
Let's go!

2062
01:43:49,651 --> 01:43:51,151
You can do it!

2063
01:43:55,821 --> 01:43:57,391
That was amazing!

2064
01:43:57,621 --> 01:43:58,761
What was that ending part?

2065
01:44:00,291 --> 01:44:03,931
(The stage that drew the most cheers)

2066
01:44:04,131 --> 01:44:05,461
What was that ending part?

2067
01:44:08,001 --> 01:44:09,971
His moves are addictive.

2068
01:44:11,941 --> 01:44:14,441
(They join in imitating Jae Hyeon's ending pose.)

2069
01:44:14,471 --> 01:44:15,911
- It's strange. - Right?

2070
01:44:18,981 --> 01:44:20,281
That's addictive.

2071
01:44:20,951 --> 01:44:22,351
I really...

2072
01:44:22,781 --> 01:44:26,621
want to go to a karaoke room with you.

2073
01:44:28,251 --> 01:44:31,521
Actually, the pitch wasn't accurate,

2074
01:44:31,521 --> 01:44:34,161
and your dance looked very awkward.

2075
01:44:34,331 --> 01:44:38,031
But the energy you gave everyone here...

2076
01:44:38,761 --> 01:44:41,031
was better than the energy of all the other stages.

2077
01:44:41,271 --> 01:44:43,471
- Thank you. - I enjoyed it. Thank you.

2078
01:44:44,041 --> 01:44:45,041
That's awesome!

2079
01:44:47,711 --> 01:44:49,671
You are No Star.

2080
01:44:49,811 --> 01:44:50,841
Thank you.

2081
01:44:54,511 --> 01:44:57,521
I'll try much more and show you a better stage.

2082
01:45:00,151 --> 01:45:01,751
(It's not over yet!)

2083
01:45:01,751 --> 01:45:04,721
(A more powerful stage is coming!)

2084
01:45:04,861 --> 01:45:11,161
(The All Star competition has become fiercer.)

2085
01:45:11,361 --> 01:45:16,001
(Many participants with great talents shock everyone.)

2086
01:45:16,031 --> 01:45:22,111
(A shocking result no one expected)

2087
01:45:22,311 --> 01:45:23,311
(Soon)

2088
01:45:23,311 --> 01:45:26,981
(The interim rankings for the 1st round is revealed.)

2089
01:45:28,111 --> 01:45:30,121
Let's have the next participant.

2090
01:45:31,581 --> 01:45:33,251
(WAKEONE)

2091
01:45:33,391 --> 01:45:34,621
WAKEONE.

2092
01:45:34,921 --> 01:45:36,021
Finally.

2093
01:45:36,821 --> 01:45:38,491
Tae Rae is from here, right?

2094
01:45:38,991 --> 01:45:42,561
(He participated in Season 1 as a trainee from WAKEONE.)

2095
01:45:42,861 --> 01:45:45,931
(Kim Tae Rae achieved his dream of making his debut.)

2096
01:45:46,801 --> 01:45:48,401
We really don't have much time now.

2097
01:45:48,401 --> 01:45:49,631
- Right? - Yes.

2098
01:45:49,631 --> 01:45:51,941
We're the Avengers of WAKEONE.

2099
01:45:51,941 --> 01:45:53,411
Let's show everything we can show,

2100
01:45:53,511 --> 01:45:55,041
and let us not regret anything after the stage.

2101
01:45:55,041 --> 01:45:56,141
- Yes. - Yes.

2102
01:45:56,141 --> 01:45:57,811
I'll come to watch the finals.

2103
01:45:58,911 --> 01:46:00,011
(Feeling reassured)

2104
01:46:00,151 --> 01:46:01,251
- One, two, three! - One, two, three!

2105
01:46:01,251 --> 01:46:02,681
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2106
01:46:04,381 --> 01:46:05,421
Do well.

2107
01:46:05,821 --> 01:46:09,321
- Hello. - Hello.

2108
01:46:09,321 --> 01:46:11,291
We're the global trainees group of WAKEONE.

2109
01:46:11,291 --> 01:46:12,991
- We're happy to meet you! - We're happy to meet you!

2110
01:46:13,431 --> 01:46:15,161
They're full of energy. That's nice.

2111
01:46:16,031 --> 01:46:17,231
They're cheerful and nice.

2112
01:46:17,801 --> 01:46:19,301
They're all foreigners except for one?

2113
01:46:20,701 --> 01:46:23,671
Only Sun Woo is Korean.

2114
01:46:24,001 --> 01:46:25,471
How old are you all?

2115
01:46:26,041 --> 01:46:28,041
Reeonn is the oldest.

2116
01:46:28,041 --> 01:46:30,941
- What? - He was born in 2007, and he's 17.

2117
01:46:31,511 --> 01:46:32,881
Who is the youngest?

2118
01:46:33,281 --> 01:46:35,681
These 2 were born in 2009, and they're 15.

2119
01:46:36,011 --> 01:46:37,351
Fifteen?

2120
01:46:37,581 --> 01:46:39,581
(Lee Dong Heon, 1995, the oldest of BOYS II PLANET K)

2121
01:46:40,521 --> 01:46:41,951
- They're really young. - I was born in 2007.

2122
01:46:41,951 --> 01:46:43,051
Does this make sense?

2123
01:46:43,051 --> 01:46:45,191
Fifteen and sixteen-year-old boys are already...

2124
01:46:45,221 --> 01:46:48,261
These boys have gathered from various countries.

2125
01:46:48,531 --> 01:46:49,931
It's really amazing.

2126
01:46:51,761 --> 01:46:52,861
Hello.

2127
01:46:53,401 --> 01:46:55,101
I'm from Taipei.

2128
01:46:55,101 --> 01:46:56,301
I'm from Japan.

2129
01:46:56,371 --> 01:46:58,201
- I'm from Thailand. - I'm from Japan.

2130
01:46:58,201 --> 01:46:59,341
(They decided to come to Korea to achieve their dream...)

2131
01:46:59,341 --> 01:47:00,441
(of becoming a K-pop idol.)

2132
01:47:00,871 --> 01:47:02,441
I wanted to become an idol.

2133
01:47:02,771 --> 01:47:05,811
I thought I should give it a try,

2134
01:47:06,041 --> 01:47:07,411
so I came here alone.

2135
01:47:08,911 --> 01:47:10,551
I'm a foreigner at the end of the day.

2136
01:47:10,621 --> 01:47:12,881
It's really difficult because of the language.

2137
01:47:13,691 --> 01:47:15,491
I want to debut.

2138
01:47:15,591 --> 01:47:18,791
To do that, I must practice.

2139
01:47:19,361 --> 01:47:21,891
Adapting to the environment.

2140
01:47:21,891 --> 01:47:23,501
Not being able to meet my parents.

2141
01:47:23,501 --> 01:47:25,501
That was quite hard.

2142
01:47:26,771 --> 01:47:28,531
It's really hard,

2143
01:47:28,531 --> 01:47:29,971
but since I gave up on everything and came to Korea...

2144
01:47:29,971 --> 01:47:32,701
because I wanted to become an idol,

2145
01:47:33,341 --> 01:47:37,041
I should do my best to make my debut in Korea.

2146
01:47:37,041 --> 01:47:38,311
(That's how much they want to achieve their dream of debuting.)

2147
01:47:41,311 --> 01:47:42,411
I feel proud of them.

2148
01:47:44,321 --> 01:47:47,321
Could you tell us...

2149
01:47:47,321 --> 01:47:48,951
what song you prepared, Hsu Ching Yu?

2150
01:47:49,151 --> 01:47:52,461
We came with "Oh Mymy : 7s" by TWS.

2151
01:47:53,261 --> 01:47:55,091
Hold on.

2152
01:47:55,331 --> 01:47:56,391
- Yes? - Did you...

2153
01:47:57,931 --> 01:48:00,131
Did you know...

2154
01:48:01,301 --> 01:48:03,101
the person who made...

2155
01:48:03,401 --> 01:48:05,371
the choreography for this song is here?

2156
01:48:05,401 --> 01:48:06,601
(Who is it?)

2157
01:48:06,811 --> 01:48:08,211
(Smiling)

2158
01:48:08,541 --> 01:48:09,571
Yes.

2159
01:48:10,011 --> 01:48:13,041
Participant Yumeki...

2160
01:48:14,081 --> 01:48:15,111
(He's shocked.)

2161
01:48:15,281 --> 01:48:16,281
(He's shocked.)

2162
01:48:17,481 --> 01:48:18,821
He worked on this too?

2163
01:48:19,281 --> 01:48:21,591
(The choreographer of "Oh Mymy : 7s," Yumeki)

2164
01:48:22,051 --> 01:48:23,521
Hello.

2165
01:48:24,661 --> 01:48:28,491
He's a choreographer I like.

2166
01:48:28,491 --> 01:48:29,891
I was nervous.

2167
01:48:30,061 --> 01:48:34,001
Which Dance Master do you want to meet?

2168
01:48:34,601 --> 01:48:37,371
I want Yumeki to be there.

2169
01:48:37,971 --> 01:48:41,911
I really like Yumeki.

2170
01:48:42,211 --> 01:48:44,881
I searched for his lessons...

2171
01:48:44,881 --> 01:48:46,341
and watched them.

2172
01:48:46,341 --> 01:48:47,381
(Hsu Ching Yu took Yumeki's dance lessons too.)

2173
01:48:47,851 --> 01:48:50,321
(When Yumeki appeared)

2174
01:48:50,581 --> 01:48:52,281
I'm Yumeki.

2175
01:48:52,821 --> 01:48:54,891
(Hsu Ching Yu was flustered to see him here as a participant,)

2176
01:48:54,891 --> 01:48:58,561
(not as a Dance Master.)

2177
01:48:58,791 --> 01:49:00,961
(WAKEONE's trainees will be performing...)

2178
01:49:00,961 --> 01:49:03,731
(in front of the original choreographer, Yumeki.)

2179
01:49:04,261 --> 01:49:05,861
Your stage will be performed in front of the choreographer.

2180
01:49:05,861 --> 01:49:07,471
I'm curious how it would be.

2181
01:49:08,431 --> 01:49:09,731
Please begin.

2182
01:49:09,731 --> 01:49:10,741
- Yes. - Yes.

2183
01:49:10,741 --> 01:49:11,941
Let's go!

2184
01:49:11,941 --> 01:49:13,371
- Let's go! - They must be very nervous.

2185
01:49:14,611 --> 01:49:16,371
It would feel different.

2186
01:49:17,281 --> 01:49:19,281
- We'll start. - The choreography is difficult.

2187
01:49:20,911 --> 01:49:23,851
We're performing in front of Yumeki,

2188
01:49:24,551 --> 01:49:25,851
so I'm very nervous,

2189
01:49:25,851 --> 01:49:27,521
but I should perform with confidence.

2190
01:49:28,391 --> 01:49:32,521
(What would "Oh Mymy : 7s" by WAKEONE's trainees be like?)

2191
01:49:33,461 --> 01:49:35,791
("Oh Mymy : 7s" by Reeonn, Shoya, Hsu Ching Yu, Tatsuki, and Sun Woo)

2192
01:49:36,331 --> 01:49:37,601
They have great facial expressions.

2193
01:49:49,711 --> 01:49:50,781
Goodness.

2194
01:49:53,211 --> 01:49:54,281
They're in sync.

2195
01:50:02,491 --> 01:50:03,591
The dance looks hard.

2196
01:50:06,261 --> 01:50:07,461
They dance so well.

2197
01:50:10,731 --> 01:50:11,931
Hsu Ching Yu is crazy.

2198
01:50:18,041 --> 01:50:19,141
They're so good.

2199
01:50:35,621 --> 01:50:36,921
They dance well!

2200
01:50:38,991 --> 01:50:41,061
Their timing matches perfectly.

2201
01:50:41,161 --> 01:50:42,431
Check out WAKEONE.

2202
01:50:44,401 --> 01:50:45,761
I should go to WAKEONE.

2203
01:50:48,131 --> 01:50:49,971
(That's how cool it was for him.)

2204
01:50:50,241 --> 01:50:51,601
You're good.

2205
01:50:52,041 --> 01:50:53,571
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2206
01:50:54,371 --> 01:50:56,881
Did you enjoy it too, Yumeki?

2207
01:50:58,241 --> 01:51:00,041
(What does the choreographer think?)

2208
01:51:01,181 --> 01:51:02,411
Yes. I enjoyed it.

2209
01:51:05,221 --> 01:51:06,251
Thank you.

2210
01:51:07,351 --> 01:51:10,161
Hsu Ching Yu danced...

2211
01:51:10,161 --> 01:51:12,321
quite comfortably...

2212
01:51:12,321 --> 01:51:13,691
and flexibly.

2213
01:51:14,361 --> 01:51:18,761
(Hsu Ching Yu left a strong impression.)

2214
01:51:19,001 --> 01:51:20,031
Thank you.

2215
01:51:20,501 --> 01:51:22,271
Could we see your freestyle dance?

2216
01:51:22,271 --> 01:51:23,301
Sure.

2217
01:51:23,331 --> 01:51:24,701
It's the first time seeing a freestyle dance.

2218
01:51:24,901 --> 01:51:26,441
What genre are you most confident in?

2219
01:51:26,641 --> 01:51:27,871
Hip-hop.

2220
01:51:29,141 --> 01:51:31,041
I'll play everything except for hip-hop.

2221
01:51:32,881 --> 01:51:34,011
Drop the music.

2222
01:51:42,691 --> 01:51:43,821
Goodness.

2223
01:51:45,191 --> 01:51:46,291
Let's go.

2224
01:51:56,671 --> 01:51:58,871
- How old is he again? - He's really good.

2225
01:52:17,361 --> 01:52:18,421
Okay.

2226
01:52:22,391 --> 01:52:24,531
He's a monster.

2227
01:52:25,161 --> 01:52:26,401
He's really good.

2228
01:52:26,931 --> 01:52:28,031
He's really good.

2229
01:52:28,801 --> 01:52:31,601
Maybe he'll have a dance battle against Yumeki later.

2230
01:52:32,101 --> 01:52:33,501
I can see...

2231
01:52:33,501 --> 01:52:36,241
that Hsu Ching Yu really loves to dance.

2232
01:52:36,411 --> 01:52:37,441
I do.

2233
01:52:38,181 --> 01:52:41,211
I'll announce the class of the participants of WAKEONE.

2234
01:52:43,651 --> 01:52:47,051
I'll announce the class of Hsu Ching Yu.

2235
01:52:47,191 --> 01:52:48,221
Yes.

2236
01:52:50,561 --> 01:52:51,691
He'll definitely get All Star.

2237
01:52:52,361 --> 01:52:53,761
We are placing you...

2238
01:52:54,931 --> 01:52:56,031
in the All Star Class.

2239
01:52:57,361 --> 01:52:59,231
(Hsu Ching Yu is placed in the All Star Class.)

2240
01:52:59,231 --> 01:53:00,601
Thank you.

2241
01:53:01,471 --> 01:53:02,471
Well done.

2242
01:53:03,331 --> 01:53:04,401
You're the best.

2243
01:53:04,401 --> 01:53:06,101
(Tatsuki and Shoya: Two Star, Hwang Sun Woo and Reeonn: One Star)

2244
01:53:06,171 --> 01:53:07,571
He deserves an All Star.

2245
01:53:07,571 --> 01:53:08,741
He really deserves it.

2246
01:53:09,041 --> 01:53:10,941
I think he's the best dancer I've seen so far.

2247
01:53:13,481 --> 01:53:14,611
I got an All Star Class.

2248
01:53:15,081 --> 01:53:16,951
I'll maintain my position in the All Star Class...

2249
01:53:16,951 --> 01:53:18,181
and make my debut.

2250
01:53:20,351 --> 01:53:22,721
(The Class Placement Match continues deep into the night.)

2251
01:53:23,051 --> 01:53:26,261
(They're given a short break time.)

2252
01:53:27,831 --> 01:53:30,231
(They're all enjoying the break in their own way.)

2253
01:53:30,231 --> 01:53:31,731
(Checking himself in the mirror)

2254
01:53:32,031 --> 01:53:34,131
(Experienced participants: Checking your looks is a qualification.)

2255
01:53:34,131 --> 01:53:35,831
(Focusing)

2256
01:53:35,831 --> 01:53:37,101
(Kim Geon Woo)

2257
01:53:37,101 --> 01:53:38,141
(Nodding)

2258
01:53:38,471 --> 01:53:39,641
He's super good-looking.

2259
01:53:39,841 --> 01:53:41,811
(Staring)

2260
01:53:42,071 --> 01:53:43,141
He looks like an actor.

2261
01:53:45,011 --> 01:53:46,481
He's just amazing.

2262
01:53:47,551 --> 01:53:49,711
He's so good-looking.

2263
01:53:50,921 --> 01:53:52,851
Kang Min is so handsome.

2264
01:53:54,151 --> 01:53:56,991
We're going to do a camera test.

2265
01:53:57,561 --> 01:53:58,921
(We're going to do a camera test.)

2266
01:53:59,561 --> 01:54:00,561
(Surprised)

2267
01:54:01,791 --> 01:54:02,861
What is it?

2268
01:54:03,591 --> 01:54:05,231
(Finished loading)

2269
01:54:05,231 --> 01:54:06,601
- Kang Min. - Yes?

2270
01:54:06,601 --> 01:54:08,471
You are at the set of BOYS II PLANET.

2271
01:54:08,601 --> 01:54:09,601
Right.

2272
01:54:09,601 --> 01:54:10,741
- Are you aware of that? - Yes.

2273
01:54:10,741 --> 01:54:11,741
All right.

2274
01:54:12,641 --> 01:54:14,071
(With the awakening of Kang Min,)

2275
01:54:14,441 --> 01:54:15,611
(the face attack begins.)

2276
01:54:15,611 --> 01:54:16,771
Look at those handsome faces.

2277
01:54:17,781 --> 01:54:19,681
- They are super good-looking. - Wild.

2278
01:54:20,281 --> 01:54:21,651
Show off your charm.

2279
01:54:22,011 --> 01:54:23,151
Bring it on, Kang Min.

2280
01:54:23,151 --> 01:54:24,151
(Provoking him)

2281
01:54:25,351 --> 01:54:26,721
(Excited)

2282
01:54:26,921 --> 01:54:31,391
(Seduce the Star Creator with your fatal charms.)

2283
01:54:32,821 --> 01:54:34,191
(Shouting)

2284
01:54:34,861 --> 01:54:35,991
My heart!

2285
01:54:36,531 --> 01:54:38,101
(Charm Battle Round 2)

2286
01:54:38,101 --> 01:54:39,131
(Surprised)

2287
01:54:39,131 --> 01:54:40,431
(Chuei Li Yu vs Lee Sang Won)

2288
01:54:43,101 --> 01:54:45,501
- Why so shy? - They are hiding.

2289
01:54:46,041 --> 01:54:47,411
Who's the guy wearing a hoodie?

2290
01:54:47,411 --> 01:54:48,471
(Interested)

2291
01:54:48,471 --> 01:54:49,941
He's really good-looking.

2292
01:54:50,111 --> 01:54:51,811
This battle is about who's prettier.

2293
01:54:52,811 --> 01:54:53,911
One, two.

2294
01:54:53,911 --> 01:54:57,551
(Show off your cuteness.)

2295
01:54:57,551 --> 01:54:58,581
They are cute.

2296
01:54:58,581 --> 01:55:00,791
(Shoot your energy to the Star Creator.)

2297
01:55:00,791 --> 01:55:02,121
Gosh. He's putting on a show.

2298
01:55:03,091 --> 01:55:04,491
(Cheering passionately)

2299
01:55:04,791 --> 01:55:07,761
That was perfect. Stop now.

2300
01:55:07,961 --> 01:55:10,561
(He loves to please his fans.)

2301
01:55:10,561 --> 01:55:11,601
Game over.

2302
01:55:11,601 --> 01:55:12,701
(He became Rensho's fan.)

2303
01:55:13,001 --> 01:55:14,501
That Japanese guy is...

2304
01:55:16,231 --> 01:55:17,271
(Thumb up)

2305
01:55:17,271 --> 01:55:18,271
good-looking.

2306
01:55:18,841 --> 01:55:20,101
He's funny,

2307
01:55:20,241 --> 01:55:22,711
and I think he's a sociable guy.

2308
01:55:23,011 --> 01:55:24,441
Do you think you can be friends?

2309
01:55:24,641 --> 01:55:26,211
I am quite shy,

2310
01:55:26,541 --> 01:55:29,111
so maybe only if he makes the first move.

2311
01:55:29,651 --> 01:55:32,121
It's actually pretty fun to watch.

2312
01:55:32,181 --> 01:55:33,921
It's fun. It's only going to get even more fun.

2313
01:55:34,091 --> 01:55:35,491
We haven't seen the good ones yet.

2314
01:55:37,821 --> 01:55:39,291
Let's watch the next team.

2315
01:55:39,291 --> 01:55:40,561
(The Class Placement Match continues. Who's next?)

2316
01:55:40,831 --> 01:55:41,831
(Participant - Boryeong)

2317
01:55:41,831 --> 01:55:43,231
Boryeong Entertainment?

2318
01:55:43,361 --> 01:55:45,901
Wait. Boryeong isn't the name of the agency, is it?

2319
01:55:45,901 --> 01:55:46,901
It's not.

2320
01:55:47,301 --> 01:55:49,371
- Boryeong? - Is it not Boryeong?

2321
01:55:49,501 --> 01:55:50,701
Boryeong Company?

2322
01:55:51,141 --> 01:55:52,201
Boryeong Company?

2323
01:55:52,201 --> 01:55:53,571
He must have come from Boryeong.

2324
01:55:53,571 --> 01:55:54,571
(He's done messing about.)

2325
01:55:54,971 --> 01:55:57,311
Woo Jin from Boryeong. Let's see it.

2326
01:56:00,181 --> 01:56:03,211
Hello.

2327
01:56:04,351 --> 01:56:05,481
He's tall.

2328
01:56:07,051 --> 01:56:08,551
He's got a very small head.

2329
01:56:08,951 --> 01:56:11,091
Goodness. You're like a model.

2330
01:56:13,691 --> 01:56:15,861
Are you very tall?

2331
01:56:15,861 --> 01:56:17,761
You seem to have great proportions, Woo Jin.

2332
01:56:17,901 --> 01:56:20,361
I am 185cm tall.

2333
01:56:21,631 --> 01:56:22,831
I envy you.

2334
01:56:22,831 --> 01:56:23,901
(He openly envies Woo Jin.)

2335
01:56:25,001 --> 01:56:26,341
Please give me a few inches.

2336
01:56:26,341 --> 01:56:27,411
(Kang Min is a little shorter than 180cm.)

2337
01:56:27,411 --> 01:56:28,611
Woo Jin, it says here...

2338
01:56:28,611 --> 01:56:30,981
that you can write songs and lyrics.

2339
01:56:31,511 --> 01:56:32,611
Yes. That's right.

2340
01:56:35,351 --> 01:56:37,851
Preparing to be a singer-songwriter,

2341
01:56:37,851 --> 01:56:39,221
I wrote songs and lyrics.

2342
01:56:39,381 --> 01:56:42,751
I went out with my guitar and busked on the streets too.

2343
01:56:45,161 --> 01:56:47,461
- Did you bring your guitar today? - Yes. I brought it.

2344
01:56:48,991 --> 01:56:51,401
Can we see you play it before we see the main performance?

2345
01:56:51,401 --> 01:56:52,461
- Yes. - Okay.

2346
01:56:53,531 --> 01:56:54,631
Right. Okay.

2347
01:56:55,831 --> 01:56:56,871
Yes!

2348
01:56:57,901 --> 01:56:58,971
It's an acoustic guitar.

2349
01:56:59,341 --> 01:57:01,471
I fantasize about playing a guitar.

2350
01:57:01,611 --> 01:57:02,911
It's so cool.

2351
01:57:04,541 --> 01:57:06,611
- He's a romantic. - His sentimentality passes.

2352
01:57:06,611 --> 01:57:07,981
(His sentimentality passes.)

2353
01:57:08,381 --> 01:57:10,051
- I will begin. - Okay.

2354
01:57:10,721 --> 01:57:12,051
Look at his long fingers.

2355
01:57:12,481 --> 01:57:14,151
- I am sorry. - What's wrong?

2356
01:57:14,651 --> 01:57:16,021
(I am sorry.)

2357
01:57:16,021 --> 01:57:17,391
I will raise the mic a little more.

2358
01:57:18,721 --> 01:57:20,361
He has to raise the mic. I see.

2359
01:57:21,061 --> 01:57:23,191
This is upsetting.

2360
01:57:23,191 --> 01:57:24,201
I am sorry.

2361
01:57:25,501 --> 01:57:26,561
"This is upsetting."

2362
01:57:27,401 --> 01:57:29,871
I think that's high enough to be my standing mic.

2363
01:57:30,601 --> 01:57:31,641
Gosh.

2364
01:57:31,641 --> 01:57:32,771
(Like this?)

2365
01:57:32,771 --> 01:57:33,871
I'm ready.

2366
01:57:40,441 --> 01:57:41,651
He must be so nervous.

2367
01:57:42,951 --> 01:57:45,581
("Easy for You to Say" by Kang Woo Jin)

2368
01:58:25,321 --> 01:58:26,361
What?

2369
01:58:29,261 --> 01:58:30,291
Are you kidding?

2370
01:58:53,251 --> 01:58:54,521
It was a test, right?

2371
01:58:54,791 --> 01:58:57,791
(That wasn't a test.)

2372
01:58:58,291 --> 01:58:59,391
Okay. You pass.

2373
01:59:00,491 --> 01:59:02,131
I think we don't need it.

2374
01:59:02,431 --> 01:59:04,901
When you sing well, you are sexy.

2375
01:59:05,601 --> 01:59:08,001
You look so good with that guitar.

2376
01:59:08,101 --> 01:59:11,041
I want to see what kind of a song he prepared as an idol.

2377
01:59:11,041 --> 01:59:12,171
Which song did you prepare?

2378
01:59:12,841 --> 01:59:16,671
I prepared to perform BoA's song "Atlantis Princess."

2379
01:59:17,611 --> 01:59:18,941
("Atlantis Princess" by BoA)

2380
01:59:18,941 --> 01:59:20,141
(A timeless hit by BoA,)

2381
01:59:20,141 --> 01:59:22,811
(loved for its clear and refreshing melody.)

2382
01:59:23,851 --> 01:59:24,981
I saw it on the list.

2383
01:59:25,321 --> 01:59:26,521
So it's him.

2384
01:59:26,981 --> 01:59:28,221

2387
01:59:31,121 --> 01:59:32,661
Atlantis...

2388
01:59:32,661 --> 01:59:34,261
There's "Atlantis Princess."

2389
01:59:34,491 --> 01:59:36,231
Look. There's "Atlantis Princess."

2390
01:59:36,631 --> 01:59:37,661
I can't wait to see it.

2391
01:59:38,861 --> 01:59:43,101
What made you suddenly want to become an idol?

2392
01:59:43,431 --> 01:59:48,011
I always wanted to be an idol.

2393
01:59:48,741 --> 01:59:51,411
But I am not a dancer.

2394
01:59:52,011 --> 01:59:54,111
So that fear made me hesitant.

2395
01:59:54,111 --> 01:59:55,111
But...

2396
01:59:55,751 --> 01:59:57,621
I love music,

2397
01:59:57,721 --> 01:59:59,581
and I love performing on stage.

2398
01:59:59,951 --> 02:00:01,851
But I can't dance.

2399
02:00:02,051 --> 02:00:04,121
I hesitated a ton before deciding to join.

2400
02:00:05,821 --> 02:00:07,091
But I didn't want to give up.

2401
02:00:07,091 --> 02:00:09,331
That's why I decided to join the competition.

2402
02:00:11,131 --> 02:00:13,601
("Atlantis Princess" by BoA)

2403
02:00:32,021 --> 02:00:33,181
What?

2404
02:00:33,181 --> 02:00:34,821
He's good!

2405
02:00:38,321 --> 02:00:39,391
What?

2406
02:00:39,391 --> 02:00:40,561
He's good!

2407
02:00:41,691 --> 02:00:42,761
He's good.

2408
02:00:49,301 --> 02:00:50,741
His movement is neat.

2409
02:01:04,151 --> 02:01:05,221
I got chills.

2410
02:01:14,561 --> 02:01:15,861
(Class Placement Match)

2411
02:01:16,531 --> 02:01:17,661
What?

2412
02:01:22,771 --> 02:01:23,801
No way.

2413
02:01:24,241 --> 02:01:26,141
(Loving the ending)

2414
02:01:26,441 --> 02:01:29,241
It's like a scene from a drama series.

2415
02:01:30,141 --> 02:01:33,541
He looks so innocent, doesn't he?

2416
02:01:33,741 --> 02:01:36,251
- He did well, didn't he? - Yes. I loved his vibe.

2417
02:01:36,251 --> 02:01:37,411
- It suits him so well. - I know.

2418
02:01:38,121 --> 02:01:39,151
We enjoyed it.

2419
02:01:39,151 --> 02:01:41,591
Woo Jin, your dance.

2420
02:01:44,661 --> 02:01:45,761
You can't dance.

2421
02:01:45,761 --> 02:01:48,361
(You can't dance.)

2422
02:01:49,131 --> 02:01:51,201
But it's charming.

2423
02:01:52,361 --> 02:01:53,431
It's strange.

2424
02:01:56,131 --> 02:01:57,601
- Yes. - I am sorry.

2425
02:01:58,541 --> 02:01:59,601
I disagree.

2426
02:02:02,071 --> 02:02:05,911
I think you have a very clean foundation.

2427
02:02:05,911 --> 02:02:07,781
Not a lot of people have that.

2428
02:02:08,211 --> 02:02:10,981
So I really enjoyed it, and I think we can make you grow.

2429
02:02:11,521 --> 02:02:12,981
So sorry, but I disagree with you.

2430
02:02:15,121 --> 02:02:16,121
What?

2431
02:02:16,121 --> 02:02:18,891
He doesn't even have a foundation.

2432
02:02:19,021 --> 02:02:20,321
He has the foundation.

2433
02:02:20,321 --> 02:02:22,261
- What kind of foundation? - Listen.

2434
02:02:22,261 --> 02:02:23,431
- Having a foundation... - Well...

2435
02:02:23,431 --> 02:02:25,231
A body foundation.

2436
02:02:25,231 --> 02:02:26,831
- Well... - It's very important.

2437
02:02:26,831 --> 02:02:28,331
To learn how to dance.

2438
02:02:28,431 --> 02:02:29,971
They are fighting because of you.

2439
02:02:30,131 --> 02:02:32,141
- I am sorry. - There's no need.

2440
02:02:32,271 --> 02:02:33,601
(We are good.)

2441
02:02:33,941 --> 02:02:35,171
- I love you. - Yes.

What Star will he get?

2443
02:02:38,241 --> 02:02:39,641
Will he get Three Star?

2444
02:02:39,841 --> 02:02:41,611
- Kang Woo Jin. - Yes.

2445
02:02:42,381 --> 02:02:44,651
Your score is...

2446
02:02:45,781 --> 02:02:46,851

Really? It really happened. No way.

2450
02:02:53,721 --> 02:02:55,131
Well done. You may leave the stage.

2451
02:02:56,261 --> 02:02:57,291
Thank you.

2452
02:02:57,831 --> 02:02:59,001
At the end of the day,

2453
02:02:59,631 --> 02:03:02,201
charm plays a lot of part.

2454
02:03:02,201 --> 02:03:03,201
I know.

2455
02:03:03,201 --> 02:03:04,541
Or if you don't have that charm,

2456
02:03:04,541 --> 02:03:06,871
you need to overcome it with talent.

2457
02:03:06,871 --> 02:03:07,941
- Yes. - Right.

2458
02:03:08,211 --> 02:03:13,141

2459
02:03:13,781 --> 02:03:15,111

2461
02:03:16,381 --> 02:03:17,981
I am in awe.

Thank you.

02:03:21,991 --> 02:03:23,091
Who is next?

2465
02:03:23,621 --> 02:03:25,361

02:03:51,551 --> 02:03:53,321
I can't believe they're here.

2472
02:03:56,691 --> 02:03:59,191
- VERIVERY is such a good performer. - Really?

2473
02:03:59,191 --> 02:04:00,361
They're well-known for their performances.

2474
02:04:01,661 --> 02:04:02,691
They're perfectly in sync.

2475
02:04:02,691 --> 02:04:04,861
They're famous for their synchronized dance.

2476
02:04:04,961 --> 02:04:07,261
The way they dance in sync is a textbook example.

2477
02:04:07,971 --> 02:04:08,971
In 1, 2.

(As soon as Kang Min's face is on the screen...)

2485

Kang Min is the best.

You're the only participant who finished his military service.

He's got a sharp angle.

2500
02:05:14,771 --> 02:05:18,901
It's been seven years since your debut,

2501
02:05:18,901 --> 02:05:21,111
so that makes you the oldest group among the experienced participants.

2502
02:05:21,141 --> 02:05:23,511
Will you tell us why you joined this program?

2503
02:05:25,941 --> 02:05:29,011
We were really torn about coming here.

2504
02:05:29,951 --> 02:05:30,951
(Preliminary audition)

2505
02:05:30,951 --> 02:05:32,721
Hello, everyone. Salute!

2506
02:05:33,581 --> 02:05:36,651
I was discharged from the Army only two days ago,

2507
02:05:36,851 --> 02:05:39,091
so I'm still getting used to the real world.

2508
02:05:40,221 --> 02:05:42,131
I had been held back for a year.

2509
02:05:43,691 --> 02:05:46,101
Ever since Dong Heon went to the Army,

2510
02:05:46,101 --> 02:05:47,801
we weren't exactly active.

2511
02:05:49,501 --> 02:05:52,971
I would tell them that honestly if they asked me.

2512
02:05:53,771 --> 02:05:55,011
I needed to make the debut.

2513
02:05:56,241 --> 02:06:00,181
I still had a strong desire to perform on stage.

2514
02:06:00,611 --> 02:06:03,081
I wanted to be a good singer once again.

2515
02:06:03,181 --> 02:06:05,851
Should I call it a challenge?

2516
02:06:06,321 --> 02:06:08,191
I'd call it a challenge.

2517
02:06:10,421 --> 02:06:13,421
I wanted to perform more through this program,

2518
02:06:13,921 --> 02:06:16,731
so I seized the opportunity. We'll do our best.

2519
02:06:20,861 --> 02:06:23,371
Many of these participants have high expectations for you.

2520
02:06:23,371 --> 02:06:25,041
- Can you live up to them? - Yes, we can.

2521
02:06:25,441 --> 02:06:26,971
I hope they watch us perform...

2522
02:06:27,171 --> 02:06:30,011
and learn a thing or two.

2523
02:06:30,211 --> 02:06:31,581
(Amazed)

2524
02:06:31,581 --> 02:06:33,741
(Exclaiming)

2525
02:06:33,741 --> 02:06:35,051
And learn a thing or two.

2526
02:06:37,851 --> 02:06:39,081
We'll see.

2527
02:06:43,121 --> 02:06:44,151
What is that?

2528
02:06:44,461 --> 02:06:45,491
What's that?

2529
02:06:46,091 --> 02:06:48,161
- What are those? - What is that?

2530
02:06:48,161 --> 02:06:49,161
(Their prop catches people's eyes.)

2531
02:06:49,661 --> 02:06:51,531
We meant to show them why K-pop is so popular,

2532
02:06:51,531 --> 02:06:55,871
and what kinds of performances VERIVERY gives.

2533
02:06:55,971 --> 02:06:57,401
We're getting all Stars, for sure.

2534
02:06:59,071 --> 02:07:00,771
("We Must Love" by ONF)

2535
02:07:07,781 --> 02:07:08,881
What was that?

2536
02:07:39,341 --> 02:07:41,311
I can't believe no one is rushing.

2537
02:07:58,701 --> 02:07:59,701
They're so good.

2538
02:08:07,911 --> 02:08:09,811
They're such good dancers.

2539
02:08:24,421 --> 02:08:25,491
They're perfectly in sync.

2540
02:08:31,901 --> 02:08:32,961
They sing in live so well.

2541
02:08:35,031 --> 02:08:36,231
Amazing vocals.

2542
02:08:42,941 --> 02:08:43,971
Okay.

2543
02:08:53,821 --> 02:08:55,221
They're so synchronized.

2544
02:09:03,991 --> 02:09:05,301
(Cheering)

2545
02:09:06,431 --> 02:09:09,101
They're certainly different.

2546
02:09:15,041 --> 02:09:17,611
- "Experienced participants." - Yes.

2547
02:09:17,941 --> 02:09:19,781
While watching it, I realized...

2548
02:09:19,781 --> 02:09:22,811
that you could never underestimate one's experience.

2549
02:09:22,911 --> 02:09:24,721
I watched it with such joy.

2550
02:09:24,921 --> 02:09:28,591
Kang Min, I'll tell you which part impressed me.

2551
02:09:28,991 --> 02:09:31,391
You were dancing with all your might,

2552
02:09:31,391 --> 02:09:34,861
yet you kept singing completely live.

2553
02:09:37,461 --> 02:09:40,861
I was touched because you thought...

2554
02:09:40,861 --> 02:09:44,001
it could help the other participants learn from you.

2555
02:09:44,801 --> 02:09:46,071
You performed the most enthusiastically...

2556
02:09:46,071 --> 02:09:47,641
even though you were the oldest band,

2557
02:09:47,741 --> 02:09:49,511
so I send you my applause.

2558
02:09:49,511 --> 02:09:50,671
- Thank you! - Thank you.

2559
02:09:52,411 --> 02:09:53,411
That was so cool.

2560
02:09:53,511 --> 02:09:56,211
They did way better than I expected.

2561
02:09:56,311 --> 02:09:57,551
Three Stars.

2562
02:09:57,981 --> 02:09:59,251
It's going to be all Stars.

2563
02:10:00,181 --> 02:10:01,891
I'll announce the result.

2564
02:10:02,351 --> 02:10:04,421
Gye Hyeon, we're placing you...

2565
02:10:04,421 --> 02:10:05,621
(Jo Gye Hyeon)

2566
02:10:05,621 --> 02:10:06,721
in the All Star Class.

2567
02:10:07,491 --> 02:10:08,631
Nice.

2568
02:10:09,831 --> 02:10:11,431
Dong Heon, we're placing you...

2569
02:10:13,461 --> 02:10:14,631
in the All Star Class.

2570
02:10:15,101 --> 02:10:16,171
Thank you!

2571
02:10:16,171 --> 02:10:17,431
(Dong Heon, All Star)

2572
02:10:17,831 --> 02:10:19,201
Kang Min, we're placing you...

2573
02:10:19,741 --> 02:10:20,901
"In the All Star Class."

2574
02:10:22,841 --> 02:10:26,281
(Seok Hoon suddenly stops speaking.)

2575
02:10:27,641 --> 02:10:28,651
What?

2576
02:10:28,911 --> 02:10:29,911
What's going on?

2577
02:10:34,521 --> 02:10:35,721
In the All Star Class.

2578
02:10:35,721 --> 02:10:37,791
(Yoo Kang Min, All Star)

2579
02:10:38,121 --> 02:10:39,221
(All members of VERIVERY are placed in the All Star Class.)

2580
02:10:39,221 --> 02:10:40,321
Great job, everyone.

2581
02:10:42,991 --> 02:10:45,061
(The 7-year-old band celebrates in an old-fashioned way.)

2582
02:10:45,061 --> 02:10:47,031
- Get off the stage like that. - Thank you.

2583
02:10:49,431 --> 02:10:51,201
(The All Star participants walk with light steps.)

2584
02:10:51,671 --> 02:10:54,471
They didn't get a single note wrong.

2585
02:10:57,741 --> 02:11:00,011
That's how experienced participants do it.

2586
02:11:00,341 --> 02:11:01,381
Fascinating.

2587
02:11:01,811 --> 02:11:03,981
"See? We're different from you."

2588
02:11:04,081 --> 02:11:06,221
"We made our debut for a reason."

2589
02:11:07,021 --> 02:11:08,051
They're here.

2590
02:11:08,051 --> 02:11:09,391
(Who are the next participants that surprised...)

2591
02:11:09,391 --> 02:11:10,721
(the confident experienced participants?)

2592
02:11:11,321 --> 02:11:12,621
(Trainees from GRID Entertainment)

2593
02:11:12,621 --> 02:11:13,621
Here they are.

2594
02:11:13,621 --> 02:11:14,761
(Finally)

2595
02:11:14,761 --> 02:11:15,891
At last.

2596
02:11:18,031 --> 02:11:20,201
Which participant seemed...

2597
02:11:20,201 --> 02:11:22,031
the most difficult to beat?

2598
02:11:22,031 --> 02:11:24,571
Leo and Sang Won from GRID Entertainment.

2599
02:11:24,571 --> 02:11:25,801
I watched their videos,

2600
02:11:25,801 --> 02:11:29,011
and they were even better than those who made their debut.

2601
02:11:29,011 --> 02:11:31,541
I expected them to be the best participants.

2602
02:11:32,411 --> 02:11:33,481
(Here's the information of the GRID trainees...)

2603
02:11:33,481 --> 02:11:34,981
(that made the experienced participants nervous.)

2604
02:11:34,981 --> 02:11:37,051
(Leo: 3 years and 7 months, Sang Won: 6 years)

2605
02:11:37,051 --> 02:11:38,921
Three years and seven months. Six years!

2606
02:11:39,351 --> 02:11:41,151
That's a long time.

2607
02:11:41,151 --> 02:11:42,551
(It's been 6 years since DKB made its debut.)

2608
02:11:42,551 --> 02:11:44,021
- Six years. - Sang Won has been a trainee...

2609
02:11:44,021 --> 02:11:45,021
for six years?

2610
02:11:45,261 --> 02:11:47,691
Let's meet them now. Come on out.

2611
02:11:48,431 --> 02:11:49,431
Let's go!

2612
02:11:49,431 --> 02:11:51,561
- Hello, everyone. - Hi.

2613
02:11:51,661 --> 02:11:53,661
- They're charismatic. - They look good.

2614
02:11:53,861 --> 02:11:54,971
They're good-looking.

2615
02:11:58,141 --> 02:12:00,001
He's very handsome.

2616
02:12:00,101 --> 02:12:01,511
He has a pretty-boy look.

2617
02:12:02,611 --> 02:12:03,711
He's really handsome.

2618
02:12:04,171 --> 02:12:06,681
I fell in love with a guy for the first time.

2619
02:12:07,211 --> 02:12:09,411
Sang Won. He's my type.

2620
02:12:11,881 --> 02:12:13,381
We'll introduce ourselves. In 2, 3.

2621
02:12:13,381 --> 02:12:14,381
- Hello. - Hello.

2622
02:12:14,381 --> 02:12:16,521
- We're trainees from GRID. - We're trainees from GRID.

2623
02:12:16,821 --> 02:12:18,221
I'm Lee Leo, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside,

2624
02:12:18,221 --> 02:12:19,821
full of unexpected charm.

2625
02:12:20,161 --> 02:12:21,361
I'm Lee Sang Won,

2626
02:12:21,561 --> 02:12:23,291
a sweet-and-salty bundle of quirky charm.

2627
02:12:23,391 --> 02:12:24,961
- It's nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you.

2628
02:12:30,831 --> 02:12:32,201
They look so nervous.

2629
02:12:34,041 --> 02:12:37,341
You two have been trainees for a very long time.

2630
02:12:37,341 --> 02:12:39,541
Did you spend all those years only in that agency?

2631
02:12:39,641 --> 02:12:42,451
I used to train in Big Hig Music.

2632
02:12:42,451 --> 02:12:43,881
Oh, Big Hit.

2633
02:12:43,881 --> 02:12:46,121
- Big Hit! - Big Hit.

2634
02:12:46,121 --> 02:12:49,421
- Big Hit. - The legendary Trainee A.

2635
02:12:49,891 --> 02:12:52,691
Trainee A. What's that?

2636
02:12:52,991 --> 02:12:54,421
So, they were members of Trainee A.

2637
02:12:54,621 --> 02:12:55,631
Both of them?

2638
02:12:57,661 --> 02:12:58,961
I was a huge fan.

2639
02:13:00,301 --> 02:13:04,071
Sang Won and I were the original members.

2640
02:13:04,171 --> 02:13:06,701
Trainee A was going to make the debut.

2641
02:13:06,701 --> 02:13:08,411
("BTS's Junior Group Trainee A Unveiled")

2642
02:13:08,411 --> 02:13:09,741
(Leo and Sang Won gained...)

2643
02:13:09,741 --> 02:13:14,141
(a lot of attention before the debut as the trainees of Big Hit Music.)

2644
02:13:15,311 --> 02:13:17,651
(They've been working together to make the debut,)

2645
02:13:17,651 --> 02:13:19,081
(relying on each other as if they were brothers.)

2646
02:13:19,751 --> 02:13:22,351
But why couldn't you make the debut?

2647
02:13:24,551 --> 02:13:27,261
There were various reasons.

2648
02:13:28,561 --> 02:13:30,091
("Debut Canceled? Big Hit Trainees,")

2649
02:13:30,091 --> 02:13:31,601
("Trainee A, Halt SNS Updates")

2650
02:13:31,601 --> 02:13:33,101
("HYBE's Trainee A Fails to Debut")

2651
02:13:33,101 --> 02:13:36,171
At the time, I left the agency,

2652
02:13:36,971 --> 02:13:39,041
so I couldn't make my debut.

2653
02:13:48,611 --> 02:13:51,851
Back then, I didn't want to be a trainee anymore.

2654
02:13:54,121 --> 02:13:57,751
I worked at a cafe as a part-timer.

2655
02:14:00,321 --> 02:14:02,691
I was trying to figure out what to do with my life.

2656
02:14:03,761 --> 02:14:07,831
I wanted to quit being a trainee and give up on my dream.

2657
02:14:08,471 --> 02:14:09,671
I wanted to take a break.

2658
02:14:10,471 --> 02:14:12,101
It took a long time to find my way back.

2659
02:14:13,271 --> 02:14:14,641
One day, I called up Sang Won.

2660
02:14:14,741 --> 02:14:16,941
I told him I was going to audition for this show.

2661
02:14:17,911 --> 02:14:20,341
I asked him to join me, so we could debut together.

2662
02:14:21,481 --> 02:14:23,711
When Leo asked me to join him,

2663
02:14:23,711 --> 02:14:27,151
I realized that he still wanted to make a debut with me too.

2664
02:14:27,751 --> 02:14:29,751
It seemed Leo was also disappointed...

2665
02:14:29,751 --> 02:14:31,861
that we couldn't debut together...

2666
02:14:31,861 --> 02:14:34,761
in the same group. And I felt the same way too.

2667
02:14:36,331 --> 02:14:40,101
Once I made up my mind that I was going for this,

2668
02:14:40,261 --> 02:14:43,371
I wanted to see this through.

2669
02:14:44,771 --> 02:14:49,471
I thought of this as my last journey which helped me get my courage up.

2670
02:14:50,211 --> 02:14:51,911
(The two of them are standing here side by side...)

2671
02:14:51,911 --> 02:14:53,581
(after spending many years together.)

2672
02:14:53,581 --> 02:14:56,011
I'm not sure if I'm the only one who feels this way.

2673
02:14:56,381 --> 02:14:59,181
The two of them seem...

2674
02:14:59,181 --> 02:15:00,751
- very gloomy. - Yes, they look down.

2675
02:15:00,751 --> 02:15:02,021
- You guys look sad. - Yes.

2676
02:15:02,021 --> 02:15:05,261
I reckon that it must be because of the long years you put in...

2677
02:15:05,261 --> 02:15:07,091
as trainees.

2678
02:15:07,661 --> 02:15:10,291
Being a trainee is a tough thing as you know.

2679
02:15:10,291 --> 02:15:12,161
It's like waiting for something without any assurance of the future.

2680
02:15:12,161 --> 02:15:13,161
(Being a trainee means endless waiting without a promise.)

2681
02:15:13,161 --> 02:15:16,601
Let's say there's a bird that can fly to the end of the sky.

2682
02:15:16,771 --> 02:15:18,031
But if the bird stays only in the cage,

2683
02:15:18,031 --> 02:15:20,071
the cage is the only place the bird can fly around.

2684
02:15:20,241 --> 02:15:23,141
Trainees must feel like birds, locked up in the cage.

2685
02:15:23,311 --> 02:15:25,481
I hope you can let go of your frustration...

2686
02:15:25,481 --> 02:15:27,681
and disappointment through this performance.

2687
02:15:27,681 --> 02:15:29,281
I genuinely hope you can do that.

2688
02:15:29,281 --> 02:15:30,881
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2689
02:15:30,881 --> 02:15:32,451
- Good luck. - Thank you.

2690
02:15:32,451 --> 02:15:34,021
- You got this! - Let's go!

2691
02:15:34,021 --> 02:15:35,891
- You can do this. - Get ready for your performance.

2692
02:15:36,151 --> 02:15:37,721
- Gosh, I was really curious. - Let's go.

2693
02:15:37,721 --> 02:15:39,221
- I can't wait to check it out. - Good luck.

2694
02:15:39,221 --> 02:15:40,361
I can't wait to see it.

2695
02:15:40,521 --> 02:15:41,691
Why do they look so cool?

2696
02:15:42,191 --> 02:15:44,161
I was worried because they seemed so sad from the entrance.

2697
02:15:44,161 --> 02:15:45,261
Right? They seemed...

2698
02:15:45,301 --> 02:15:46,531
- Yes. From the entrance... - Now, it's better.

2699
02:15:46,831 --> 02:15:48,971
- I hope they're good. - Yes. I hope so too.

2700
02:15:49,531 --> 02:15:50,701
- Let's go. - Let's kill it.

2701
02:15:50,701 --> 02:15:52,441
- Let's kill it. - You can do it.

2702
02:15:55,141 --> 02:15:56,341
I was very nervous.

2703
02:15:56,571 --> 02:15:57,841
Since we've been trainees for a long time,

2704
02:15:57,841 --> 02:15:59,141
we should be able...

2705
02:15:59,141 --> 02:16:02,511
to do better and show them an amazing performance.

2706
02:16:03,411 --> 02:16:05,721
(What kind of performance will the trainees from GRID put on?)

2707
02:16:06,221 --> 02:16:07,681
Let's break out of the birdcage.

2708
02:16:07,821 --> 02:16:08,821
Let's go.

2709
02:16:12,491 --> 02:16:15,491
("No Doubt" by ENHYPEN performed by Lee Leo and Lee Sang Won)

2710
02:16:21,131 --> 02:16:22,131
Oh, my.

2711
02:16:25,641 --> 02:16:27,441
- Is he really singing it live? - My gosh.

2712
02:16:35,651 --> 02:16:36,981
My gosh!

2713
02:16:39,721 --> 02:16:40,921
They could debut as idol stars now.

2714
02:16:58,541 --> 02:16:59,541
Oh, yes.

2715
02:17:10,981 --> 02:17:12,321
Gosh, seriously.

2716
02:17:27,061 --> 02:17:28,101
This is amazing.

2717
02:17:29,301 --> 02:17:30,331
Let's fly!

2718
02:17:35,611 --> 02:17:37,811
Darn.

2719
02:17:38,481 --> 02:17:40,581
(Sang Won's shoe comes off during the performance.)

2720
02:17:41,211 --> 02:17:42,681
Didn't he say, "Darn?"

2721
02:17:44,381 --> 02:17:45,381
Darn.

2722
02:17:49,251 --> 02:17:50,421
What's this?

2723
02:17:56,031 --> 02:17:57,691
- Okay! - Nicely done!

2724
02:18:00,661 --> 02:18:02,231
Well done, Sang Won.

2725
02:18:03,271 --> 02:18:04,631
(They wrapped up the performance nicely,)

2726
02:18:04,631 --> 02:18:06,401
(but...)

2727
02:18:06,541 --> 02:18:07,771
"Darn."

2728
02:18:07,771 --> 02:18:09,011
(They can't still get over how he said, "darn.")

2729
02:18:09,011 --> 02:18:10,841
- Gosh, his shoe. - Oh, no.

2730
02:18:12,681 --> 02:18:15,081
I've never heard any participant say, "darn,"

2731
02:18:15,081 --> 02:18:16,511
in the middle of the performance.

2732
02:18:16,681 --> 02:18:18,551
- It's my 1st time hearing it. - It's my 1st time hearing it.

2733
02:18:18,551 --> 02:18:20,151
- It's my first time. - Can I try that?

2734
02:18:20,151 --> 02:18:21,681
I want to say, "Darn."

2735
02:18:21,681 --> 02:18:22,691
(He kneels down as he's embarrassed and sorry.)

2736
02:18:22,691 --> 02:18:24,391
It's okay, Sang Won.

2737
02:18:24,391 --> 02:18:25,521
We can understand that.

2738
02:18:26,991 --> 02:18:27,991
He's cute.

2739
02:18:28,461 --> 02:18:30,531
To be honest, Vocal Masters and I...

2740
02:18:30,531 --> 02:18:32,831
were quite worried because we didn't find anyone...

2741
02:18:33,101 --> 02:18:35,831
suitable for the chorus part. We were.

2742
02:18:36,631 --> 02:18:39,201
But we found you, Leo.

2743
02:18:39,201 --> 02:18:40,271
(We found you, Leo.)

2744
02:18:40,271 --> 02:18:41,941
- Come here, you. - You did well.

2745
02:18:43,071 --> 02:18:45,511
We loved your voice the moment you started singing.

2746
02:18:49,851 --> 02:18:52,721
- He's good. - We finally found the one.

2747
02:18:53,021 --> 02:18:54,081
I'm honored.

2748
02:18:54,121 --> 02:18:55,721
Sang Won, you're excellent too.

2749
02:18:55,721 --> 02:18:57,391
- Thank you. - You're an excellent vocalist.

2750
02:18:57,721 --> 02:19:00,391
They complimented you a lot for your singing skills.

2751
02:19:02,631 --> 02:19:04,531
- You guys danced very well too. - Yes.

2752
02:19:04,531 --> 02:19:06,431
- Thank you. - Your dancing was excellent.

2753
02:19:06,431 --> 02:19:08,901
Well, Sang Won made a mistake during the performance.

2754
02:19:08,901 --> 02:19:11,101
So you burst into laughter toward the end.

2755
02:19:11,331 --> 02:19:13,201
I loved seeing you smile like that.

2756
02:19:13,741 --> 02:19:16,741
I hope you can get your smile back soon...

2757
02:19:16,741 --> 02:19:18,711
- Okay. - and have more fun on stage.

2758
02:19:19,141 --> 02:19:21,481
I said, "Let's fly."

2759
02:19:21,481 --> 02:19:23,511
- Yes. - I hope you can show us that...

2760
02:19:23,511 --> 02:19:25,551
you will keep moving forward...

2761
02:19:25,551 --> 02:19:28,751
because there's no place to fall back on.

2762
02:19:28,751 --> 02:19:31,021
- Okay. We will. - I enjoyed it. Thank you.

2763
02:19:31,021 --> 02:19:32,591
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2764
02:19:33,321 --> 02:19:34,761
Let us discuss this. Give us a moment.

2765
02:19:36,791 --> 02:19:37,931
All Star.

2766
02:19:37,931 --> 02:19:39,061
(Everyone expects them to be in the All Star Class.)

2767
02:19:39,061 --> 02:19:40,531
I bet they'll end up in the All Star Class.

2768
02:19:40,601 --> 02:19:42,401
Personally, I want to see them perform again.

2769
02:19:43,601 --> 02:19:46,171
We'll announce the classes for trainees from GRID.

2770
02:19:46,171 --> 02:19:47,501
Participant Lee Leo.

2771
02:19:48,641 --> 02:19:49,641
We are placing you...

2772
02:19:49,641 --> 02:19:53,641
(Which class will Leo be placed in?)

2773
02:19:54,911 --> 02:19:56,651
in the All Star Class.

2774
02:19:56,651 --> 02:20:00,221
(Lee Leo is placed in the All Star Class.)

2775
02:20:02,121 --> 02:20:05,561
Participant Lee Sang Won. We are placing you...

2776
02:20:11,131 --> 02:20:12,201
Darn.

2777
02:20:12,401 --> 02:20:13,631
(During the performance,)

2778
02:20:13,631 --> 02:20:18,001
(Sang Won made a mistake as his shoe came off.)

2779
02:20:18,531 --> 02:20:23,771
(Which class will Sang Won be placed in?)

2780
02:20:24,211 --> 02:20:25,241
You're in the All Star Class.

2781
02:20:25,241 --> 02:20:27,441
(Lee Sang Won is placed in the All Star Class.)

2782
02:20:27,441 --> 02:20:28,581
Thank you.

2783
02:20:29,481 --> 02:20:30,911
Thank you so much for placing in the All Star Class.

2784
02:20:30,911 --> 02:20:31,951
I knew it.

2785
02:20:31,951 --> 02:20:33,551
Did you think you'd be placed in the All Star Class?

2786
02:20:34,081 --> 02:20:35,951
- No. - To be honest, no.

2787
02:20:36,621 --> 02:20:38,491
- They're finally smiling. - That's a big smile.

2788
02:20:38,491 --> 02:20:40,021
You had such good teeth.

2789
02:20:40,161 --> 02:20:41,961
- They're just kids. - They're lightening up.

2790
02:20:41,961 --> 02:20:44,561
Can we make one request?

2791
02:20:44,561 --> 02:20:45,661
Yes.

2792
02:20:45,661 --> 02:20:46,761
You prepared for the extra test, right?

2793
02:20:46,761 --> 02:20:48,461
- Yes. - Can you show us what you prepared?

2794
02:20:48,461 --> 02:20:49,631
We'll show you.

2795
02:20:49,831 --> 02:20:51,171
Okay, let's go.

2796
02:20:51,571 --> 02:20:54,441
A celebratory performance for the extra test.

2797
02:20:54,441 --> 02:20:55,711
This is really cool.

2798
02:20:55,711 --> 02:20:57,341
They're performing again after placing in the All Star Class.

2799
02:20:57,511 --> 02:20:59,611
- Are they just going to dance? - I guess so.

2800
02:21:00,241 --> 02:21:01,981
- Are they big? - I'm not sure.

2801
02:21:02,411 --> 02:21:03,411
Tie them twice.

2802
02:21:04,911 --> 02:21:06,121
(Tightening hard, so they stay on this time)

2803
02:21:06,121 --> 02:21:07,421
Leo told him to tie them twice.

2804
02:21:07,751 --> 02:21:09,691
It's hilarious how his shoe flew off.

2805
02:21:09,751 --> 02:21:10,891
Let's do it here.

2806
02:21:10,891 --> 02:21:11,921
(What did they prepare for the extra test?)

2807
02:21:12,121 --> 02:21:13,421
I bet they're going to crush it.

2808
02:21:13,821 --> 02:21:15,021
I'm so excited about this.

2809
02:21:20,431 --> 02:21:23,971
(To be continued)

2810
02:21:23,971 --> 02:21:24,971
Let's go.

2811
02:21:27,401 --> 02:21:28,441
My goodness!

2812
02:21:30,341 --> 02:21:32,981
(To celebrate their placement, they perform for the extra test.)

2813
02:21:34,281 --> 02:21:38,351
("Come Back Home" by Seo Taiji and Boys)

2814
02:21:38,351 --> 02:21:39,351
Let's go.

2815
02:21:42,221 --> 02:21:43,251
My goodness!

2816
02:21:46,461 --> 02:21:47,461
My goodness!

2817
02:21:53,761 --> 02:21:54,801
I'm getting goosebumps.

2818
02:22:33,541 --> 02:22:34,571
They're so good.

2819
02:22:41,641 --> 02:22:43,151
They totally killed it.

2820
02:22:46,551 --> 02:22:47,581
My gosh!

2821
02:22:50,491 --> 02:22:51,691
They were really different.

2822
02:22:51,691 --> 02:22:54,061
They seemed like they were kind of on a different level too.

2823
02:22:54,261 --> 02:22:55,431
Gosh, they're good.

2824
02:22:55,631 --> 02:22:57,191
They've already gone beyond the level of trainees.

2825
02:22:57,961 --> 02:22:59,031
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2826
02:22:59,031 --> 02:23:01,261
Gosh, you guys were dancing as if your bodies would break.

2827
02:23:01,261 --> 02:23:02,531
- That was great. - They're so good.

2828
02:23:02,531 --> 02:23:04,031
We'll pay to watch from now on.

2829
02:23:05,571 --> 02:23:06,901
- It was an honor. - Thank you.

2830
02:23:06,901 --> 02:23:08,371
Congratulations. I hope we get to see you for a while.

2831
02:23:08,371 --> 02:23:09,411
Bye.

2832
02:23:10,241 --> 02:23:12,581
- I'm sorry. - Gosh, no.

2833
02:23:13,541 --> 02:23:15,711
(He finishes his unforgettable first performance with an apology.)

2834
02:23:18,921 --> 02:23:20,551
Gosh, Leo, I'm so sorry.

2835
02:23:22,651 --> 02:23:24,721
(Sang Won felt bad about his mistake the whole time.)

2836
02:23:24,721 --> 02:23:25,961
For real.

2837
02:23:26,961 --> 02:23:28,291
I want to do it over.

2838
02:23:28,721 --> 02:23:31,161
Even right now, I want to do it over.

2839
02:23:31,331 --> 02:23:33,501
My shoe even flew off right then.

2840
02:23:33,501 --> 02:23:35,701
And I even blurted something out by mistake.

2841
02:23:36,971 --> 02:23:38,001
(Flustered)

2842
02:23:38,601 --> 02:23:41,701
That didn't happen because I normally swear a lot...

2843
02:23:41,701 --> 02:23:43,171
or anything like that.

2844
02:23:43,171 --> 02:23:44,471
I also don't know why...

2845
02:23:44,911 --> 02:23:48,181
(Explaining what happened for 3 minutes straight)

2846
02:23:48,311 --> 02:23:50,981
I was so grateful since the Masters seemed to let it go...

2847
02:23:50,981 --> 02:23:52,181
like it wasn't a big deal.

2848
02:23:52,421 --> 02:23:53,951
I should really work hard.

2849
02:23:55,691 --> 02:23:57,751
Let's meet the next participant. Please come on out.

2850
02:23:57,751 --> 02:23:59,421
(Who is the next participant?)

2851
02:23:59,421 --> 02:24:00,621
(Participant - Yokohama, Yumeki)

2852
02:24:00,621 --> 02:24:02,531
- Yumeki. - My gosh.

2853
02:24:02,531 --> 02:24:04,161
- He's here. - Gosh, hang on.

2854
02:24:04,231 --> 02:24:05,331
We're in huge trouble.

2855
02:24:05,861 --> 02:24:07,161
Gosh, here comes the top dog.

2856
02:24:09,371 --> 02:24:12,071
I'm sure many of you have been waiting for him.

2857
02:24:12,801 --> 02:24:15,101
- The next participant, come on out. - I'm so looking forward to this.

2858
02:24:15,341 --> 02:24:18,041
This is... Gosh, this is seriously...

2859
02:24:18,041 --> 02:24:19,381
Shouldn't we pay money to watch this?

2860
02:24:19,381 --> 02:24:21,081
When I practiced dancing at my company,

2861
02:24:21,081 --> 02:24:22,351
I'd always copy Yumeki's videos.

2862
02:24:22,351 --> 02:24:24,251
Hey, me too. He was always in the practice videos.

2863
02:24:24,251 --> 02:24:25,951
Seeing the person I copied with my own eyes...

2864
02:24:25,951 --> 02:24:26,951
I know. It doesn't feel real.

2865
02:24:26,951 --> 02:24:28,081
This makes no sense at all.

2866
02:24:28,281 --> 02:24:30,521
Koo Young, Yumeki was in 1MILLION DANCE STUDIO, right?

2867
02:24:30,551 --> 02:24:31,651
That's right.

2868
02:24:31,651 --> 02:24:32,761
He's here.

2869
02:24:33,891 --> 02:24:35,061
Hello.

2870
02:24:35,061 --> 02:24:37,791
(As everyone looks forward to his performance, Yumeki appears.)

2871
02:24:39,431 --> 02:24:41,231
Hello.

2872
02:24:41,231 --> 02:24:43,171
- I'm so looking forward to this. - This is unreal.

2873
02:24:43,171 --> 02:24:44,601
He should be up there.

2874
02:24:44,831 --> 02:24:45,901
I know, right?

2875
02:24:45,901 --> 02:24:47,301
Yes, let me introduce myself.

2876
02:24:47,301 --> 02:24:49,141
I'm from Yokohama, Japan.

2877
02:24:49,141 --> 02:24:50,441
My name is Yumeki.

2878
02:24:50,441 --> 02:24:51,571
Please look kindly upon me.

2879
02:24:54,881 --> 02:24:55,911
I mean...

2880
02:24:56,451 --> 02:24:59,551
Yumeki is such a famous dancer.

2881
02:24:59,551 --> 02:25:02,321
You could say that the K-pop scene can't do without him now.

2882
02:25:02,321 --> 02:25:05,091
He's a very active dancer and choreographer.

2883
02:25:05,091 --> 02:25:07,321
I'm pretty sure he choreographed TXT's song recently too.

2884
02:25:07,491 --> 02:25:10,431
I'm so surprised to meet you like this.

2885
02:25:11,191 --> 02:25:13,861
What made you want to apply to be on the show?

2886
02:25:14,931 --> 02:25:16,001
Actually,

2887
02:25:16,571 --> 02:25:20,841
as I've been working as a dancer and choreographer until now...

2888
02:25:22,101 --> 02:25:24,511
I'm Yumeki, and I'm a dancer.

2889
02:25:25,611 --> 02:25:28,411
I've been dancing for over ten years,

2890
02:25:28,411 --> 02:25:30,481
and I've been working as a choreographer and dancer...

2891
02:25:30,481 --> 02:25:31,511
for five years.

2892
02:25:33,151 --> 02:25:34,881
THE BOYZ, SHINee,

2893
02:25:35,381 --> 02:25:37,621
ITZY, and TWICE.

2894
02:25:38,421 --> 02:25:41,791
Recently, I'm working on TXT's choreography...

2895
02:25:41,791 --> 02:25:44,331
and ILLIT's choreography as well.

2896
02:25:45,661 --> 02:25:48,101
I was on a survival show...

2897
02:25:48,101 --> 02:25:50,201
on the same team as Master Back Koo Young.

2898
02:25:50,731 --> 02:25:52,701
(Yumeki was on "Street Man Fighter" with Master Back Koo Young...)

2899
02:25:52,701 --> 02:25:54,501
(as a member of the same crew in the past.)

2900
02:25:54,571 --> 02:25:55,941
While we were on "Street Man Fighter,"

2901
02:25:55,941 --> 02:25:57,671
we practically lived together every single day.

2902
02:25:58,841 --> 02:26:00,481
(Master Back Koo Young approved of his dance skills,)

2903
02:26:00,481 --> 02:26:02,081
(which he proved on "Street Man Fighter.")

2904
02:26:02,211 --> 02:26:05,411
I think I spent more time with him than with my own family.

2905
02:26:05,411 --> 02:26:09,091
He gave me lots of good feedback as a senior...

2906
02:26:09,151 --> 02:26:12,621
about my future and what I wanted to do from now on.

2907
02:26:13,361 --> 02:26:15,291
He was a huge help.

2908
02:26:16,261 --> 02:26:20,201
Ever since I was little, I've dreamt of becoming an idol.

2909
02:26:20,461 --> 02:26:23,031
But then, I became a dancer...

2910
02:26:23,101 --> 02:26:25,531
and got to see singers from nearby.

2911
02:26:25,601 --> 02:26:27,001
I envied them so much.

2912
02:26:27,901 --> 02:26:29,741
"Why can't I do it?"

2913
02:26:30,941 --> 02:26:33,041
"Isn't this what I want to do?"

2914
02:26:33,041 --> 02:26:34,141
(Yumeki asked himself that question.)

2915
02:26:34,611 --> 02:26:37,081
First of all, this is...

2916
02:26:38,081 --> 02:26:39,481
my first time to sing.

2917
02:26:40,281 --> 02:26:42,791
I felt that I was really bad at it.

2918
02:26:45,421 --> 02:26:46,721
It really is hard...

2919
02:26:47,521 --> 02:26:50,131
to dance while singing.

2920
02:26:52,931 --> 02:26:55,261
That's not it. From here...

2921
02:26:55,261 --> 02:26:57,031
Recently, for this audition,

2922
02:26:57,201 --> 02:26:59,541
I took singing lessons for the first time.

2923
02:27:00,501 --> 02:27:02,711
Actually, I was really worried,

2924
02:27:02,941 --> 02:27:05,341
but I wanted to show people my best performance.

2925
02:27:05,341 --> 02:27:08,411
So, I learned to sing for the first time too.

2926
02:27:08,941 --> 02:27:11,111
I don't think there will be another chance like this.

2927
02:27:11,111 --> 02:27:12,111
Not anymore.

2928
02:27:12,281 --> 02:27:14,651
I want to grasp this great opportunity...

2929
02:27:14,651 --> 02:27:17,451
and do well until the end, without any regrets.

2930
02:27:20,861 --> 02:27:23,031
- I'm glad you're here. - Yes, thank you.

2931
02:27:23,031 --> 02:27:24,131
You're so cool.

2932
02:27:24,531 --> 02:27:26,831
He's nervous.

2933
02:27:27,131 --> 02:27:28,731
Yumeki,

2934
02:27:28,731 --> 02:27:31,401
you're the choreographer who made the dance to "Oh Mymy : 7s"...

2935
02:27:31,401 --> 02:27:33,301
- that WAKEONE did earlier. - Yes.

2936
02:27:33,441 --> 02:27:35,371
(Yumeki is the choreographer who made the dance...)

2937
02:27:35,371 --> 02:27:37,641
(to "Oh Mymy : 7s," performed by the trainees of WAKEONE.)

2938
02:27:37,841 --> 02:27:40,611
Since it has come up, could we see the original dance?

2939
02:27:40,611 --> 02:27:41,611
Oh, really?

2940
02:27:43,051 --> 02:27:44,551
Yes, okay.

2941
02:27:44,551 --> 02:27:45,851
- My gosh. - Let's go.

2942
02:27:45,851 --> 02:27:46,851
(So expectant)

2943
02:27:46,921 --> 02:27:48,451
Can I really watch this for free?

2944
02:27:48,451 --> 02:27:49,691
Please play the song from the refrain.

2945
02:27:49,851 --> 02:27:51,091
The original choreographer's version.

2946
02:27:51,091 --> 02:27:52,121
I'm so curious.

2947
02:27:52,921 --> 02:27:54,891
("Oh Mymy : 7s" performed by the original choreographer)

2948
02:28:02,431 --> 02:28:03,771
It's so different.

2949
02:28:08,901 --> 02:28:11,241
- Is that the way he dances? - It feels totally different.

2950
02:28:17,981 --> 02:28:19,921
It seems like he uses his entire body.

2951
02:28:20,181 --> 02:28:21,321
It sure is different.

2952
02:28:21,321 --> 02:28:24,091
The original choreographer's version sure is different.

2953
02:28:24,091 --> 02:28:25,591
He's so good.

2954
02:28:25,691 --> 02:28:27,491
(Make some noise!)

2955
02:28:29,091 --> 02:28:31,031
- I'm asking as I'm really curious. - Yes?

2956
02:28:31,031 --> 02:28:33,831
You might have to do a mission with the choreography...

2957
02:28:33,831 --> 02:28:35,231
made by Master Back Koo Young.

2958
02:28:35,231 --> 02:28:36,231
Right. Yes.

2959
02:28:36,431 --> 02:28:37,671
(What about it?)

2960
02:28:37,771 --> 02:28:39,871
But what if you don't like his choreography?

2961
02:28:40,971 --> 02:28:42,941
(A very extreme balance game)

2962
02:28:42,941 --> 02:28:44,171
Then, what will you do?

2963
02:28:45,811 --> 02:28:46,811
Then,

2964
02:28:47,411 --> 02:28:49,351
I'm usually very stubborn.

2965
02:28:49,351 --> 02:28:50,381
Yes?

2966
02:28:54,121 --> 02:28:56,851
I will change it how I want to.

2967
02:28:57,651 --> 02:28:58,691
(Impressed)

2968
02:28:59,961 --> 02:29:01,121
Oh, okay.

2969
02:29:01,461 --> 02:29:03,691
I will take that into consideration as I evaluate him.

2970
02:29:03,791 --> 02:29:05,331
No, that's not true.

2971
02:29:05,631 --> 02:29:06,831
I'm just kidding.

2972
02:29:07,161 --> 02:29:10,001
I think of Yumeki as...

2973
02:29:10,701 --> 02:29:14,201
a friend I truly respect...

2974
02:29:14,401 --> 02:29:16,241
as a dancer and choreographer.

2975
02:29:16,871 --> 02:29:19,211
If Yumeki survives this level...

2976
02:29:19,211 --> 02:29:20,581
and goes onto the next mission...

2977
02:29:21,781 --> 02:29:22,981
Gosh, I feel so weird on the inside.

2978
02:29:23,181 --> 02:29:24,581
If he goes onto the next level,

2979
02:29:24,911 --> 02:29:26,281
I think I will be so happy.

2980
02:29:26,281 --> 02:29:28,581
I think I'll feel very happy, first and foremost.

2981
02:29:28,751 --> 02:29:30,091
Thank you.

2982
02:29:30,151 --> 02:29:31,191
Indeed.

2983
02:29:31,191 --> 02:29:33,921
All right. Participant Yumeki, please prepare for your performance.

2984
02:29:33,921 --> 02:29:35,021
- Okay. - Here we go.

2985
02:29:35,091 --> 02:29:36,161
(Yumeki finally gets ready for his performance.)

2986
02:29:36,161 --> 02:29:37,631
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2987
02:29:37,761 --> 02:29:39,601
I wonder what he'll do.

2988
02:29:39,661 --> 02:29:42,431
It's game over if he sings well too.

2989
02:29:42,531 --> 02:29:43,531
He must be nervous.

2990
02:29:43,531 --> 02:29:45,601
Gosh, I've never heard him sing before.

2991
02:29:45,601 --> 02:29:46,871
It's my first time to see him sing too.

2992
02:29:46,871 --> 02:29:48,641
- Same here. - Koo Young, did you know?

2993
02:29:48,641 --> 02:29:50,741
No, I had no idea.

2994
02:29:50,741 --> 02:29:52,371
- I found out when I got here. - You found out here?

2995
02:29:52,371 --> 02:29:53,841
- I found out after seeing this. - I was so surprised.

2996
02:29:53,841 --> 02:29:56,011
We worked on something together until very recently.

2997
02:29:56,011 --> 02:29:58,211
- Didn't you know either, KINKY? - No. He didn't mention anything.

2998
02:29:58,411 --> 02:29:59,581
Our eyes will get to feast on his performance.

2999
02:29:59,951 --> 02:30:01,281
But his singing...

3000
02:30:01,281 --> 02:30:02,891
We're choosing singers here.

3001
02:30:02,891 --> 02:30:03,951
That's the issue.

3002
02:30:04,621 --> 02:30:05,691
Do well.

3003
02:30:06,191 --> 02:30:07,861
All right. Here we go. Standby.

3004
02:30:08,761 --> 02:30:09,861
How will he do?

3005
02:30:10,531 --> 02:30:11,631
(What performance did Yumeki,)

3006
02:30:11,631 --> 02:30:12,761
(the talked-about participant, prepare?)

3007
02:30:24,171 --> 02:30:25,311
It's "Rainism."

3008
02:30:34,851 --> 02:30:36,191
Singing is the issue.

3009
02:30:41,291 --> 02:30:42,731
Yumeki's vocal skills are,

3010
02:30:42,961 --> 02:30:44,761
in my standards...

3011
02:30:45,531 --> 02:30:47,831
Gosh, what do we do?

3012
02:30:50,271 --> 02:30:53,341
Participant Yumeki's Class is...

3013
02:30:55,001 --> 02:30:56,111
Stars.

3014
02:30:59,141 --> 02:31:01,741
Gosh, my pride was really hurt. I thought,

3015
02:31:02,281 --> 02:31:05,381
"I guess this was how bad I was."

3016
02:31:06,151 --> 02:31:08,181
"I was so lacking."

3017
02:31:11,021 --> 02:31:13,091
"Why did I come here?"

3018
02:31:13,421 --> 02:31:16,791
(What will Yumeki's fate be?)

3019
02:31:17,091 --> 02:31:19,161
Now, we will reveal...

3020
02:31:19,161 --> 02:31:22,701
