Star Creators around the world.

40
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,840
To determine the boys' fate,

41
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,799
BOYS II PLANET C's first global voting is taking place now.

42
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,409
(BOYS II PLANET C's 1st global voting)

43
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,239
For the first global voting,

44
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,809
on Mnet Plus, the official platform,

45
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,049
you may vote once a day.

46
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,519
On the BOYS II PLANET webpage,

47
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,080
click on BOYS II PLANET C Voting.

48
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,290
Select a total of eight participants.

49
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,620
Once you click "Submit Vote" at the bottom,

50
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,930
you'll receive a voting certificate...

51
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,800
to confirm that you've voted.

52
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,700
Fifty percent of the voting result will reflect votes from Korea,

53
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,800
and the other 50 percent from the rest of the world.

54
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,110
The accumulated number of votes will be converted into scores.

55
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,810
The first global voting on BOYS II PLANET C will end...

56
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,980
later tonight.

57
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,620
Your choice will determine the boys' fate.

58
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,290
Star Creators,

59
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,419
vote for the boys who will set your heart on fire.

60
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,100
(Star Creators! Vote for the boys who will set your heart on fire.)

61
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:01,690
(Episode 2: Stronger Energy, Protect the All Star)

62
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,160
Let's move on to the next team.

63
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,029
What?

64
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,830
(Interested, focused)

65
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,800
(Amazed)

66
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,100
Team BOYS PLANET is on BOYS II PLANET C.

67
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,870
(They've already killed it.)

68
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,870
It's the best Team BOYS PLANET.

69
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,039
They were in Season One, right?

70
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,150
Aren't they your friends?

71
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,750
Yes, they are.

72
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,250
All three were in Season One.

73
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,919
(During Season 1, their skills were insufficient.)

74
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,019
(Cai Jin Xin, )

75
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,229
(Xuan Hao, )

76
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,990
(and Krystian)

77
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:49,700
(Unfortunately, Team BOYS PLANET was eliminated during the season.)

78
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,670
(Trying again in BOYS II PLANET C after 2 years)

79
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,469
(Staring)

80
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,540
He's handsome.

81
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,840
- He's good-looking. - Indeed.

82
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,380
He's gotten more handsome.

83
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,649
(Xuan Hao's looks were the talk of the town.)

84
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,019
(China's Park Bo Gum is good-looking.)

85
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,389
(Xuan Hao is the most handsome.)

86
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,710
(My 1st choice, Xuan Hao is hot.)

87
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,220
He looks a little like Park Bo Gum.

88
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,160
Xuan Hao is not that young.

89
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,760
He was born in 1995.

90
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,700
- He doesn't look like it. - He was born in 1995.

91
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,600
Thirty years old?

92
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,069
(Born in 2010)

93
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,569
Doesn't that mean he's the oldest here?

94
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,570
Probably.

95
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:30,070
Putting your ages aside,

96
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,080
why are you all trying out for the audition again?

97
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,450
After getting eliminated in "BOYS PLANET,"

98
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,320
I returned to China and shot a drama.

99
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,789
But during that process,

100
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,060
I couldn't give up my dream of becoming an idol.

101
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,630
I...

102
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,810
may be old, but I want to fulfill my last dream.

103
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,840
I'm more desperate than the younger participants.

104
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,580
I'm 30 years old. I need to debut.

105
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,060
This show is a great opportunity for me.

106
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,890
Honestly, I want to come in first place.

107
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,160
Goodness.

108
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,660
- Really? - Did you really write that?

109
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,130
This is the kind of nerve you need.

110
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,529
My goal is to win first place.

111
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,770
(1st place is mine.)

112
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,190
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

113
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,210
Two years have passed, and I'm on the stage again.

114
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,380
I want to show a new side of me.

115
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,950
I'm looking forward to it.

116
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,679
How exciting.

117
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,720
Good luck.

118
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,520
I'll see how they've changed over the past two years.

119
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,490
("Chk Chk Boom" by Stray Kids...)

120
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:55,491
(performed by Xuan Hao, Cai Jin Xin, and Krystian)

121
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,200
Look at those eyes.

122
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,059
(The atmosphere turned heavy after the performance.)

123
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,530
Maybe my expectations were too high.

124
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,260
- Wasn't it bad? - Yes.

125
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,200
Their dance skills are not that great.

126
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,300
It was like, "Nice, but they're experienced?"

127
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,100
Their dancing was weird.

128
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,540
The moves weren't in sync.

129
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,040
Here's a general critique.

130
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,939
There's still room for improvement...

131
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,310
in the overall balance.

132
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,920
I can't really tell if you've improved a lot since then.

133
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,290
We'll announce the result.

134
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,600
Oh, my gosh.

135
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,360
Participant Krystian...

136
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,200
- is placed in One Star. - Understood.

137
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,510
Participant Cai Jin Xin is placed in One Star.

138
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,179
(What is the class of Xuan Hao, the last participant?)

139
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,220
Participant Xuan Hao's class is...

140
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,859
- Two Star. - Thank you.

141
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,500
(2 Star for Xuan Hao of Team BOYS PLANET)

142
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,030
- Thank you. - Thank you.

143
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,800
Work harder. Work much harder, everyone.

144
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,039
We will. Bye.

145
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,270
- Bye. - Good.

146
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,840
(Their backs are full of regret.)

147
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,310
I feel a heavy burden.

148
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,690
(The next participant to appear)

149
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,420
What?

150
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,160
To think he'd be here.

151
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,100
(Singing)

152
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,860
(Who is the participant warming up quite differently?)

153
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,670
(Dang Hong Hai)

154
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:51,939
- You remember him, right? - I do.

155
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,070
What a pleasant surprise from a participant from Season One.

156
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,510
He's good-looking.

157
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,210
He's become cooler.

158
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,850
It's been a while.

159
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,190
Hi.

160
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,360
Look at his proportions.

161
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,660
- Isn't he like ten-head tall? - Hi.

162
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:20,060
Hi. I will become the highest and most dazzling highlight...

163
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,400
of BOYS II PLANET C. I'm in your care.

164
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,770
I'm so happy to see you.

165
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:30,610
Gosh. I felt an intense aura from him.

166
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,310
He's different from before. There's a calmness about him now.

167
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,510
And yet, I can sense he's utterly determined.

168
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,290
In the past, he was simply a bright kid.

169
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,460
How have you been?

170
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,090
During the two-year break,

171
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,200
I did some self-reflection.

172
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,376
- "Self-reflection." - "Self-reflection."

173
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,369
I studied my strengths and weaknesses...

174
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,940
and tried to find what suited me best.

175
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,440
And all I waited for was BOYS II PLANET C.

176
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,479
Goodness, how cool. It seems like even your Korean has gotten better.

177
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,319
You heard him, didn't you? "Self-reflection."

178
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,020
(Dang Hong Hai said "self-reflection.")

179
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,049
What do you regret from Season One?

180
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,490
(What do you regret from Season 1?)

181
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:23,090
I couldn't show off...

182
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,430
all my skills and charms.

183
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,670
(During Round 2, the Dual Position Battle, of BOYS II PLANET Season 1)

184
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,669
(He ranked 42nd, placing last on the team, and was eliminated.)

185
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,940
When I got eliminated in Season One,

186
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,080
I realized I was incompetent.

187
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,609
Hi. I'm Hai.

188
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,610
I'm Dang Hong Hai.

189
00:10:42,611 --> 00:10:45,080
I'm Dang Hong Hai, and I'm 22 years old.

190
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,420
That's why I decided...

191
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,620
to change.

192
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,220
I'm not even kidding when I say I only practiced.

193
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,589
One person doesn't get two chances.

194
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,060
(A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity)

195
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,900
Please get ready.

196
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,870
I believe it's my last chance.

197
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:10,310
Waiting for those two years felt like forever.

198
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,040
I have nothing to lose now.

199
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,880
I'm excited.

200
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,520
I missed the beat. I'm doomed.

201
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,230
He started too quickly.

202
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,859
("I'll See You There Tomorrow" by TOMORROW X TOGETHER...)

203
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,200
(performed by Dang Hong Hai)

204
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,560
Please.

205
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
(Impressed)

206
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,570
Yes.

207
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,680
Let's go.

208
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,980
Hey.

209
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,320
Let's go.

210
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,190
Yes.

211
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,339
What was that just now?

212
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,400
Magic.

213
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,980
That was magic.

214
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,090
He gives off idol vibes.

215
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,000
That was amazing.

216
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,430
I thoroughly enjoyed it.

217
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:21,469
You must have worked really hard until now.

218
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,280
Performing solo couldn't have been easy.

219
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,010
You had a great stage presence.

220
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,550
That idea of yours was smart too.

221
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,149
I appreciate how thoughtfully you prepared and executed...

222
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,720
every minute of the performance.

223
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,060
Thank you.

224
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,630
But...

225
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,400
But...

226
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,200
(Chief Master Kim Jae Joong reversed the mood.)

227
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,140
What?

228
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,310
If you perform...

229
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,650
the same way next time,

230
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,820
I think it's only fair that you get eliminated.

231
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,690
I see.

232
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,200
His missing the beat at the beginning stressed me out.

233
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,570
(He made a beat mistake right at the start.)

234
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,070
We'll announce Participant Dang Hong Hai's class.

235
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,310
Okay.

236
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,550
It must be All Star.

237
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,250
I think Two Star.

238
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,889
Participant Dang Hong Hai's class is...

239
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,589
(What is Dang Hong Hai's class?)

240
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,620
All Star.

241
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,589
All Star.

242
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,130
(Dang Hong Hai of Team DONGYO is placed in the All Star Class.)

243
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,130
You deserve it.

244
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,070
I love your current attitude.

245
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:59,540
You have good looks and wit.

246
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,740
I hope you don't disappoint us in the next performance.

247
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,380
Thank you.

248
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,480
(Great job.)

249
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,520
Okay. Are you going to clean the confetti?

250
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,620
(Laughing)

251
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,059
(Slowly)

252
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,390
I asked, and the production crew will clean it up.

253
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,060
He asked.

254
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,259
- Thank you. - Congratulations.

255
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,300
(Even his sincere wrap-up was very witty.)

256
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,669
- I've been bewitched. - By Dang Hong Hai?

257
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,840
His attitude is praiseworthy.

258
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,470
(After an extremely tense moment, )

259
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:44,550
(Dang Hong Hai has mixed feelings.)

260
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,230
I felt super happy.

261
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,700
But I also thought I shouldn't stop here.

262
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,300
With the duty to protect my All Star...

263
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,909
to the fullest, I will give it my all.

264
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,680
(I will become BOYS II PLANET C's highlight.)

265
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,110
(Dang Hong Hai left a long-lasting impression.)

266
00:16:14,111 --> 00:16:15,150
He was good.

267
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,650
(A round of applause)

268
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,150
Everyone is highly competent.

269
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,050
They're all talented.

270
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,160
- Hi. - Hi.

271
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,030
My name is Xue Su Ren.

272
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,890
- He was P1Harmony's backup dancer. - Backup dancer.

273
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,800
That participant is a great dancer.

274
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,740
("Ggum" by YEONJUN performed by Xue Su Ren and Ngan Chau Yuet)

275
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,070
I love Participant Xue Su Ren's tone.

276
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,540
I thought, "We've got a talent right here."

277
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,670
("Maverick" by THE BOYZ performed by Yi Chen and Ko Ming Chieh)

278
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,550
(Performances by talented participants continue.)

279
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,760
I'm about to play. Let's go!

280
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,430
I'm having fun.

281
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,199
My heart fluttered a lot...

282
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,670
as I watched you perform.

283
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,510
There are so many amazing participants.

284
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,679
Hello, I'm Peng Jin Yu.

285
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,009
He's a content creator?

286
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,379
The most popular video that I posted is...

287
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,109
a video of me singing when I was young.

288
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,149
Really?

289
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,749
It has about 90 million views.

290
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,990
Ninety million views?

291
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,920
(Singing a verse of the song of honor)

292
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,219
(Exclaiming)

293
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,730
It's him.

294
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,160
(A video of Peng Jin Yu's past that highlights his cute, chubby cheeks)

295
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,270
(His cuteness hasn't changed.)

296
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,670
("Miracle" by Super Junior performed by Peng Jin Yu)

297
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,849
(An unexpected vibe with a powerful dance break)

298
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,820
(Cheering)

299
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,520
(Showing unexpected charm with his cute looks and powerful dance moves)

300
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,329
If you were in a boy group,

301
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,760
you'd definitely obtain...

302
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:13,030
one of the positions. That's what I thought while watching you.

303
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,830
That's high praise.

304
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,499
We're placing you in the All Star Class. Congratulations.

305
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,340
(Peng Jin Yu of Team Liaoning is placed in the All Star Class.)

306
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,239
It's getting more and more interesting.

307
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,320
Yes, this is more interesting than BOYS II PLANET K.

308
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:32,220
(Which is the last team at the Class Placement Match?)

309
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,920
Boy Story.

310
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,290
(Boy Story that everyone has been waiting for)

311
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,460
This is really amazing.

312
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,430
They give off an incredible presence on stage.

313
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,200
How will I compete against Boy Story?

314
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,660
They look amazing.

315
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,269
You had a major concert after your debut.

316
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:56,410
For the three members of Boy Story,

317
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,409
appearing on this show...

318
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,640
must have not been easy.

319
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,180
It could be a loss for us.

320
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,680
As the audience, we feel more nervous for them.

321
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:12,760
(Why they decided to participate in BOYS II PLANET)

322
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,130
It's because...

323
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,560
(In the spotlight as soon as they debuted in 2018)

324
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,600
We graduated from Boy Story.

325
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,739
The first chapter of our teenage years...

326
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,780
has come to an end.

327
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,520
The past is already behind us.

328
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,220
We don't know what will happen in the future, but...

329
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,160
(Preliminary audition)

330
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,860
What I definitely felt is...

331
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,130
that we were on the rise right after our debut.

332
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,940
Then we stopped working as a group.

333
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,440
Overall,

334
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,140
we started going downhill.

335
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,650
(They spent more time rehearsing than performing on stage.)

336
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,780
Again.

337
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,180
Okay, let's do it one more time.

338
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,319
Despite my young age,

339
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,450
I always encouraged the other members.

340
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,519
Whenever we were preparing for our comeback,

341
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,390
this is what I told the members before every performance.

342
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,159
"We can do it."

343
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,199
As long as we work hard together,

344
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,700
the day will come...

345
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,170
when we shine the brightest.

346
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,540
But now...

347
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,569
(450,000 views, 1 year ago)

348
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,080
We weren't able to meet many people's expectations.

349
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,550
How long has it been since your debut?

350
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,349
It's been seven years.

351
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,990
(This year is Boy Story's 7th year since their debut.)

352
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:52,820
Which groups debuted around the same time as you?

353
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,530
Stray Kids, ITZY...

354
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,729
(From their trainee days to debut, fellow artists who were with them)

355
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,900
When I look at my peers who were active around the same time,

356
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:10,510
I wonder if my years of effort were all in vain.

357
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,210
For both the team and me,

358
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,850
I'm no longer sure if we can do it well.

359
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:28,730
I cannot handle this situation.

360
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,400
I didn't want to show this side of me.

361
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,310
We must succeed no matter what.

362
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,220
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

363
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,990
(Remembering the time he endured makes him burst into tears.)

364
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,929
We'd like to perform at a bigger event,

365
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,759
and we'd like a better opportunity.

366
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,569
My wish is...

367
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,030
that more people would watch us.

368
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:14,809
We'll work hard.

369
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,940
- Please support us. - Please support us.

370
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,710
Let's go.

371
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,710
They seem dignified.

372
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,880
- They debuted at such a young age. - Right.

373
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,550
It's starting now.

374
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,390
("Back Door" By Stray Kids...)

375
00:22:33,391 --> 00:22:34,906
(performed by Li Zi Hao, Jia Han Yu, and He Xin Long)

376
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:38,530
I'll pour my everything into it.

377
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,670
He looks so relaxed.

378
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,650
How are they so in sync?

379
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,190
Oh, my.

380
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,830
They look very stable.

381
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,190
It feels like I'm at a concert.

382
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:52,570
Oh, no.

383
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,480
- I'm so relieved. - Me too.

384
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,550
(Everyone applauds.)

385
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,719
- Thank you. - Thank you.

386
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,489
This is the skill of a current idol singer.

387
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,149
I thought that I was watching a music show.

388
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,390
You know what I mean?

389
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,360
That was incredible.

390
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,060
His singing was insane.

391
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,629
They performed like current idol singers.

392
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,400
I totally agree with you.

393
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,790
They're current idol singers.

394
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,929
Right,

395
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,270
but it felt like we were at their concert.

396
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,210
I feel relieved.

397
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,320
- I feel relieved. - It's not easy.

398
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,220
Was my singing okay?

399
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,190
It was amazing.

400
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:21,320
(Boy Story has been growing together on stage like this moment.)

401
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,799
I'll give you an honest comment.

402
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,870
(I'll give you an honest comment.)

403
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,640
(Nervous)

404
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:40,310
I'll give you an honest comment.

405
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,310
At first, I didn't think that you were singing live.

406
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,120
(Are they singing live?)

407
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,259
(His strong singing skills confused even the Masters.)

408
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,490
You did a wonderful job.

409
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,160
- Thank you. - The sound and the tone were good.

410
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,560
You have a great vibe and a great style.

411
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,830
He Xin Long, are you kind?

412
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,600
Me?

413
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,510
(What is he asking all of a sudden?)

414
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,969
- Yes, I'm kind. - Are you kind?

415
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:08,970
Yes.

416
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,840
If you're kind, you're an all-around idol singer.

417
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,580
"All-around?"

418
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,849
(He's all-around because he also has a sense of humor.)

419
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:17,880
All-around.

420
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,420
Thank you.

421
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,189
You have all the necessary qualities.

422
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,489
Among BOYS II PLANET participants,

423
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,959
like splash damage,

424
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,260
he'd generate a synergy effect.

425
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,030
You didn't work in vain.

426
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,900
- Thank you. - Thank you.

427
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,930
- We'll work hard. - We'll work hard.

428
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,846
When it comes to skills, Boy Story is in a league of its own.

429
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,199
We'll announce the result.

430
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,480
(What will be Team NCC's class?)

431
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,510
(Elimination gate)

432
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,380
Would it be necessary to open the gate?

433
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:55,390
Jia Han Yu of Team NCC.

434
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,759
We're placing you in the Two Star Class.

435
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,830
(Jia Han Yu of Team NCC, 2 Star)

436
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,999
Li Zi Hao, we're placing you in the Two Star Class.

437
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,029
(Li Zi Hao of Team NCC, 2 Star)

438
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,100
Why?

439
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,100
Why?

440
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,170
Too brutal.

441
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,239
He Xin Long's...

442
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,009
(What's the youngest member of Team NCC, He Xin Long's class?)

443
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,180
class is...

444
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,310
He's getting the All Star this time. There's no other way.

445
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,649
It's All Star. Congratulations.

446
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:34,360
(He Xin Long of Team NCC is placed in the All Star Class.)

447
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,630
(All the participants congratulate him.)

448
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,200
All Star!

449
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,070
(Team NCC)

450
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,339
The Masters have set...

451
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,710
a very high judging criteria.

452
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,839
They are a lot more experienced...

453
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,339
than the other participants,

454
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,579
and they have been trained for a long time.

455
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,249
That's why we set the bar high for them.

456
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,010
(They set a relatively higher bar for them.)

457
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:06,720
You are 20 and 21 years old.

458
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,790
But there was a sense of maturity.

459
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,960
I'm not just talking about your talent but also your looks.

460
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,270
I think it's wrong.

461
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,070
No way.

462
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,210
When you were dancing,

463
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,710
the way you controlled power... I could see you had mastery.

464
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,609
If you lose just a little bit of weight,

465
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:35,790
you will be able to put on a much better performance.

466
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,249
You have the talent,

467
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,289
but you need the body...

468
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,289
that supports it. That's the impression I got.

469
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,130
When we meet again next time,

470
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,570
I hope you will all pass with All Star.

471
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,629
(Well done, Boy Story!)

472
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,840
- Thank you. - Thank you.

473
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,240
- Thank you. - Jia Han Yu, lose weight.

474
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,010
I will.

475
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,540
Okay.

476
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,410
(His energetic footsteps show how happy he is.)

477
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,150
This is the new beginning of me.

478
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,450
Yes!

479
00:29:09,451 --> 00:29:11,720
All Star is now my past.

480
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,960
I will continue to get the All Star.

481
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,990
(Excited)

482
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,690
(At that moment, the members come out from the 2 Star Room.)

483
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,059
(Bowing politely)

484
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,400
Isn't he He Xin Long, the man who got the All Star?

485
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,469
I will raise my head when you tell me to.

486
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,170
It's a huge honor.

487
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,970
Don't. Don't do it.

488
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,970
- Let's do this! - Let's do this!

489
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,410
Let's do this!

490
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,980
(The boys congratulate him in a playful and loving way.)

491
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,980
(We are proud of our youngest!)

492
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,650
(Team NCC ends the Class Placement Match!)

493
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,560
The Class Placement Match is over.

494
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,330
Well done, dear participants.

495
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,730
Finally, it's over.

496
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:54,500
A total of 80 participants took part in the Class Placement Match.

497
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,930
The result we got is...

498
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,300
All Star. Congratulations.

499
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,840
Thirteen in the All Star Class.

500
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,040
It's Two Star.

501
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:03,710
Twenty-three in the Two Star Class.

502
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,110
It's One Star.

503
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:09,480
Thirty-one in the One Star Class.

504
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,510
It's No Star.

505
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,290
And 13 participants will be going home.

506
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,550
Qi Lin.

507
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,990
It's too bad. Too bad.

508
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,529
Now, please move...

509
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,100
to your new classes.

510
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,930
- Bye. - Bye.

511
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,400
(You are All Star too?)

512
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,640
(He's sad to move to a lower class.)

513
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,180
The three of us are still here.

514
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,210
Should we switch?

515
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,250
No.

516
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,510
(Playful)

517
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,420
It was our dream to move...

518
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,290
from a low place to a higher place.

519
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:53,760
I was really happy, but I was slightly nervous too.

520
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,960
The Two Star participants kept turning their heads.

521
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,660
It made me realize how much I wanted to keep the All Star.

522
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,429
From below, I looked up at the All Star Zone,

523
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,200
and it seemed to shine more.

524
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,169
Honestly, I was very jealous.

525
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:11,270
I will work hard to stand shoulder to shoulder with them.

526
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,609
There's still an unresolved feeling inside me.

527
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,510
I don't think I'm any less than the All Stars.

528
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,410
(Everyone is repositioned.)

529
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,049
The class of BOYS II PLANET C...

530
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:25,490
will become a very important criterion...

531
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,841
as we decide your survival and elimination in the future.

532
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,760
The next test that will...

533
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,660
determine your fate is...

534
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,000
(2nd Class Placement Match)

535
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,770
There's no time to catch our breath!

536
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,099
Another Class Placement Match?

537
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,300
There's a second match?

538
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,640
The Class Placement Match isn't over yet.

539
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,439
Through this test,

540
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,710
you have to prove yourself yet again.

541
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:52,019
It's my chance to show myself in a higher place.

542
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,320
I will catch up with them in no time.

543
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,190
The second Class Placement Match...

544
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,460
will determine your final class.

545
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,720
(What is this test about?)

546
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,330
It's Signal Song Test.

547
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,299
(The time has come.)

548
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,630
Let's go!

549
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,069
- It's making me nervous. - Isn't it too soon?

550
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,190
Let's see if it's difficult.

551
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:14,169
The Signal Song Test was something I could only see on TV.

552
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:16,139
We're going to be performing it?

553
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,109
It's the most nerve-racking moment in every competition I participate.

554
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:22,480
It's like I'm about to take another test that's very important in life.

555
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,280
The Signal Song Test is done...

556
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,420
in two levels of evaluation.

557
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,720
First, according to the Masters' evaluation,

558
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,820
your first class, ranging from All Star...

559
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,830
to One Star, will be decided.

560
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,360
Your class will decide your position on stage...

561
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,500
and how much you will be singing during the signal song performance.

562
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,669
How thrilling.

563
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,999
I was excited. I thought of it...

564
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,640
as a chance to go up higher.

565
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,539
The stage for the Signal Song Test portrays...

566
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:54,040
climbing to the highest place past a long road.

567
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,910
At the end of the road is the fierce sun,

568
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:59,250
which symbolizes the Star Creators.

569
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,679
How cool.

570
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,050
They used the real sun as the backdrop.

571
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,660
One Stars will stand on the road, which is at the bottom.

572
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,930
All Stars perform on the highest stand.

573
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,230
All Stars get to stand and perform in the center of the stage,

574
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,270
at the highest place.

575
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,506
The amount of stage time also varies depending on the class.

576
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,770
The higher your class, the more stage time you will get.

577
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:23,210
The lower your class, the less stage time you will get.

578
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:27,009
What? The discrepancy is too big.

579
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,510
I need to become All Star.

580
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,350
I’ll push myself to the limit for All Star.

581
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,820
Lastly,

582
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,050
No Star participants...

583
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:40,860
cannot perform on the stage of Signal Song Test.

584
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,190
(Very disappointed)

585
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:45,699
No matter what happens, I will not receive No Star.

586
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,700
(I think it's time I give my absolute everything.)

587
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,169
And there's one more thing.

588
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:53,600
The highlight of the signal song, the part everyone dreams of singing.

589
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,840
It's...

590
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,470
the killing part.

591
00:33:58,610 --> 00:33:59,710
Killing part.

592
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,409
The participant who gets the killing part...

593
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:07,219
will stand at the highest and the flashiest place on stage...

594
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,749
and make the Star Creators in the world...

595
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:14,160
clearly remember who you are.

596
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:18,190
I will do my best to get the killing part.

597
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:22,000
I will do my absolute best to get the killing part.

598
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:24,630
There's one more main evaluation left.

599
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:29,440
It's the individual evaluation from the global Star Creators.

600
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,479
According to your new class,

601
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,009
you will perform the signal song.

602
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,126
The clip of the signal song performance will be revealed,

603
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:39,680
and the Star Creators will evaluate you.

604
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,179
I'm so excited.

605
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:44,419
That I finally have a chance to show myself to the Star Creators.

606
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,720
I hope the Star Creators will recognize my hard work.

607
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,689
In the second Class Placement Match,

608
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:53,129
the Masters' scores and the Star Creators'...

609
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:56,229
Singal Song Individual Evaluation Score will be combined,

610
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:59,070
and your final class will be decided.

611
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,670
And...

612
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,710
The participant who gets No Star...

613
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,680
You did not survive.

614
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,480
Will be going home.

615
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:11,250
You will no longer continue to the next test.

616
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,020
No way. Is this really happening? It's too brutal.

617
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,890
No second chances.

618
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,119
Now, it's time to check the signal song of BOYS II PLANET C.

619
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,360
I'm ready right now.

620
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,860
Let's watch the video first.

621
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,460
It's coming.

622
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,570
(Zhang Hao)

623
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,000
It's Zhang Hao.

624
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,539
Dear participants of BOYS II PLANET C.

625
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,769
Hello. I am Zhang Hao of ZEROBASEONE.

626
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:40,080
Hello.

627
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,509
I was really surprised.

628
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,380
I never expected it to be Zhang Hao.

629
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:46,120
Here's why I suddenly came here today.

630
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,890
It's to show the choreography of the new signal song.

631
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:50,920
Choreography.

632
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,860
PLANET II PLANET's signal song is, "HOLA SOLAR."

633
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,790
- "HOLA?" - "HOLA?"

634
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,689
We will reveal it now.

635
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,759
- Hola. - Hola.

636
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,640
"HOLA SOLAR" is such a catchy name to remember.

637
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:01,730
"Hola."

638
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,640
Is he doing the dance moves?

639
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,940
He's doing this.

640
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,369
Isn't it the mirror mode?

641
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,440
Wait.

642
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,310
- Wait. - Yes?

643
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,580
Wait.

644
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,170
We will see it through this part.

645
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,170
We will see it through this part.

646
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,679
We will see it through this part.

647
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,089
(Why?)

648
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,920
(The sweetness doesn't last.)

649
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,159
That's it for the video.

650
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,206
(He's 200 percent satisfied with his job as the Chief Master.)

651
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,230
You remember the rules...

652
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,806
for the Class Placement Match, right?

653
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,300
- Yes. - Yes.

654
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,270
They are looking first.

655
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,870
(Laughing)

656
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,169
(Before the start of the Class Placement Match)

657
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,209
The participants who received All Star in the match...

658
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:46,179
will get a chance to learn...

659
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:51,080
the next test song.

660
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,349
I want to see more.

661
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,050
All Stars can see it first.

662
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,249
They will progress faster.

663
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,590
Right. That's a shame.

664
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:03,789
Two Stars and One Stars.

665
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:04,930
Please turn back...

666
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,300
right now.

667
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,370
(I'm upset.)

668
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,570
My goodness.

669
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,070
Oh, my gosh.

670
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,070
(This is fun.)

671
00:37:15,071 --> 00:37:16,170
(Feeling some pressure)

672
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:17,470
This is how they do it?

673
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,539
Please don't do this. It's so embarrassing.

674
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,610
Oh, gosh.

675
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,650
Then, let's play.

676
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,780
Prick your ears.

677
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:28,056
Open your eyes wide so that I can see the reflection in your eyes.

678
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,750
See the reflected images in their eyes.

679
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,190
(We're watching you.)

680
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,266
Do the participants up there copy the choreography?

681
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:35,520
They don't do it on purpose.

682
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,859
Would they copy it or not? Make a guess.

683
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,659
- I think they will right away. - I don't think they will.

684
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,399
- Really? - There are benefits at stake.

685
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,706
(That won't happen when there are benefits at stake.)

686
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,869
It starts now.

687
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,030
Are they going to copy it?

688
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,899
They shouldn't. Oh, my!

689
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,970
- Okay! - Yes.

690
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,270
(Masters shouldn't be so sure.)

691
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:52,880
No, you fools!

692
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:57,149
(All Star Class shows everything.)

693
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,180
Such fools. Goodness.

694
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,580
We can watch how they dance.

695
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,726
They're dancing in a mirror mode, which is even better.

696
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:03,920
They're being nice.

697
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:06,510
What's the difference from seeing it with my own eyes?

698
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,060
Benefits are at stake!

699
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,089
I couldn't see the video itself,

700
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:13,600
but participants in All Star seats copied it.

701
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,060
I fixed my eyes on it.

702
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,300
It's so difficult.

703
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,540
(More participants give up copying the high-level moves.)

704
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,310
It's so tough.

705
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,110
The song is so high-pitched.

706
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,020
Is that a dance break?

707
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,320
That's so hard.

708
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,490
They pick up the moves so quickly.

709
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,690
Chen Bo Wen is learning so fast.

710
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,919
(Amazed)

711
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,960
(Chen Bo Wen is a choreography copier.)

712
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:47,730
(Completely copying the finishing move too)

713
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,030
(Imitating)

714
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:54,199
Chen Bo Wen was right above me.

715
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,040
I picked up some moves watching him.

716
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,409
This song is much harder than "Here I Am."

717
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,779
In Season 1, there was only 1 move for the chorus.

718
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,039
But when I saw the All Star Class, their hands were moving like...

719
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,979
(So busy)

720
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,380
(Such busy hand moves)

721
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,219
Which of you will survive until the end...

722
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,890
and have your dream of debut come true...

723
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,420
depends on yourselves.

724
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,330
I will keep the All Star status until the end.

725
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,930
I hope you show us your best...

726
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,930
as much as you're desperate and passionate.

727
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:27,539
I think so many people want to take my place.

728
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:30,809
However, I will do my best to maintain my class.

729
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,480
Wait. I will go up no matter what.

730
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,540
I will keep my All Star for sure.

731
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,019
(The Signal Song training begins in earnest.)

732
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,379
When is it going to start?

733
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,589
I've started it already.

734
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,226
I should have shown a better performance earlier.

735
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,689
- It's very difficult. - It's okay.

736
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:46,959
I don't think you'll be good.

737
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,119
(Meeting with harsh criticism)

738
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,159
Just leave.

739
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,059
Why do you want to be here when you have no talent?

740
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,159
(Receiving scathing reviews)

741
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,559
You're not good enough to be here.

742
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,270
I think it's the worst, to be honest.

743
00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:01,970
(And the Final Class Announcement begins!)

744
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,209
Don't cry.

745
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:07,940
(What will happen to Planet C participants?)

746
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,350
(After the fierce Class Placement Match, )

747
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,620
(where do the participants head toward?)

748
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,366
(A charming and beautiful place like a village in a fairy tale)

749
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,989
(The shining dreams of participants will grow...)

750
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:20,220
(in Planet Camp.)

751
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,459
(So excited)

752
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,660
It's huge.

753
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,260
Look at those flags.

754
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,500
They're pink. They're pretty.

755
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,700
Let's go.

756
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:37,210
(Participants are standing by their classes.)

757
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,239
(The door opens at that moment.)

758
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,340
(Drawing attention)

759
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,750
(Dance Master Xiao Ting appears.)

760
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:47,020
- Hello! - Hello!

761
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,719
(An eye-opener)

762
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,790
Hello. I'm Dance Master Xiao Ting.

763
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,290
(We're glad to see you.)

764
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,089
I told you BOYS II PLANET C...

765
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:59,530
is operated by a complete class system, right?

766
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,799
Therefore, a different training uniform...

767
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,400
is given based on your class.

768
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,669
(BOYS II PLANET training uniforms are categorized into three classes.)

769
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:09,100
(One Star, Two Star, All Star)

770
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,271
(Only the All Star training uniform has gold stars on the shoulders.)

771
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,080
That looks fancy.

772
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,480
The stars are gold.

773
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,030
It looks much nicer in real life.

774
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,230
The purple one looks definitely nice.

775
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,800
The color brightens up the skin tone.

776
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,280
I want to wear the purple one too.

777
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,659
(Next, 2 Star Class)

778
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,629
My brother says the green color lingers

779
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:33,199
We're the safe class, so we're in green.

780
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,000
All Star Class has three stars on the shoulders.

781
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:40,040
(Last, 1 Star)

782
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,570
There will be no difference even if I wear this.

783
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,709
(He looks great in it.)

784
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:50,709
The All Star guys had gold stars on their shoulders,

785
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,950
so they looked shiny.

786
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,850
I just wanted to run to them, grab the clothes, and wear them.

787
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,950
I really enjoy it.

788
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:59,720
If other guys tell me that they envy me,

789
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,690
I'd say, "I can't help it."

790
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:04,030
But I'm going to keep this class.

791
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:07,700
It made the One Star Class competitive.

792
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:09,269
We all need to go up.

793
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:10,910
In this mission, I will definitely go up.

794
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:15,170
In BOYS II PLANET, everything is divided by class.

795
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,780
The dormitory is also given differently by class.

796
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,880
(All Star Class exclaims.)

797
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,550
This is too much.

798
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,579
I should have done better in the performance.

799
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,050
Does that mean we have no bed?

800
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,266
(Four people in One Star Class will use a quad room.)

801
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:35,496
(A quad room for One Star and a triple room for Two Star)

802
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,166
Do the All Star guys get a better room than these?

803
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:39,700
It's more special for All Star than other classes.

804
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,500
Two people can use a double room.

805
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,370
(It's great.)

806
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,799
(We feel so jealous.)

807
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,409
I hope everyone works hard...

808
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,239
and achieve the advantage for All Star.

809
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,840
- Yes! - We will!

810
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,110
(Set off for the dormitory for each class!)

811
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,579
(Firstly, heading toward the 2 Star Camp)

812
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,861
The bed is divided into the top bunk and the bottom bunk.

813
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,020
(The 2 Star Class will use a triple room.)

814
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:13,100
I honestly felt a bit scared back then.

815
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,000
(Intimidating aura)

816
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:20,500
(Broad-shouldered)

817
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:24,409
Anything's fine with me. Two of you can discuss it.

818
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:26,810
You can choose what you want first.

819
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,686
(Sang Lin's sweet nature gives him butterflies.)

820
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:31,210
Are you sure? Thank you.

821
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,850
I think he has a sweet nature inside.

822
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:40,259
It's so peaceful. I thought I'd have to fight.

823
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,066
(They choose the beds in a surprisingly peaceful manner.)

824
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:44,229
(Meanwhile, in the 1 Star Camp...)

825
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:45,530
Is the room large?

826
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:46,930
Oh, my goodness.

827
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:57,640
(The 1 Star room is definitely smaller than the 2 Star room.)

828
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,510
(The life of 1 Star isn't easy.)

829
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:03,050
(Soulless)

830
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,810
Let's pick our beds.

831
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,920
I will just use this one.

832
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,950
I want to use the upper bunk.

833
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,490
I want the upper bunk too.

834
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:12,450
- Then I will use this one. - Okay.

835
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,060
- All right. - Yes.

836
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:17,560
I'm going to sleep.

837
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:22,060
(Another 1 Star room)

838
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:24,169
(Zhang Shi Yi, 188cm tall, appears.)

839
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:25,600
Hello.

840
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:27,000
Hello.

841
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:33,310
This bed is a bit small for me.

842
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,140
(The bed is too small for Zhang Shi Yi.)

843
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,110
(Taller by a head)

844
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,109
How tall are you?

845
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,420
To be honest, I'm 190cm tall.

846
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:41,650
You're 190cm?

847
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:42,650
(Then...)

848
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,649
(Zhang Shi Yi is 10cm longer than the bed.)

849
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:47,490
The bed looks sturdy and safe, though.

850
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:48,660
(Emptying his mind)

851
00:44:48,661 --> 00:44:50,489
(Meanwhile, a suspicioius sound is heard in one room.)

852
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:52,430
(Busy shuffling something)

853
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,499
(What he's suffling are...)

854
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,370
(tarot cards.)

855
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:59,306
I need to see the difficulty of the Signal Song.

856
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:01,900
The 1st competition, the 2nd competition, and the Signal Song.

857
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:04,070
One card just slipped out.

858
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:07,409
Which card slipped out?

859
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:08,770
It could be a hint. Wait a second.

860
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,450
I found it. It's the Sun.

861
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:15,280
The Sun means a new life,

862
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:17,490
and there's a helper.

863
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,250
Then at this time,

864
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:22,160
the presence like the Sun who lifts us up...

865
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,790
are Star Creators?

866
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,029
(Just serious)

867
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:28,060
(Star Creators)

868
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:32,300
How large is a room for the All Star Class?

869
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:35,540
- I guess it's like a hotel suite. - A royal suite in a hotel.

870
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:39,410
(The All Star Camp is revealed.)

871
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,239
(A special benefit only the All Star Class can enjoy)

872
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,580
(A cozy rest area)

873
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,179
(Various kinds of snacks...)

874
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:50,390
(and cold drinks)

875
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:53,160
(A relaxing space only for the All Star Class)

876
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:54,790
Oh, my goodness!

877
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,560
You make me feel sexy

878
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,259
(Surprised)

879
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,330
What is this?

880
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
(I'm excited!)

881
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,670
(Huddled around)

882
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,040
(Eating snacks)

883
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,369
(This place is in charge of the rest for the All Star Class.)

884
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:13,410
Thank you.

885
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:18,150
I'd like to be an All Star for life.

886
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,656
(I, Xue Su Ren is determined to be an All Star for life.)

887
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,080
It's been a while.

888
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,290
(Laughing)

889
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:25,719
(A double room in All Star Camp)

890
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,120
(An individual refrigerator too)

891
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,390
I was so happy.

892
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:30,429
I felt really glad.

893
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:32,430
There are so many advantages when you're All Star.

894
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,930
I will definitely practice harder...

895
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,800
and maintain this class.

896
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:37,800
All right.

897
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:45,569
(All Star forever! We can do it!)

898
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:47,209
(All Star, 2 Star, 1 Star)

899
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:50,010
(While everyone dreams of All Star, the night deepens in Planet Camp.)

900
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,750
(The group training day of Signal Song)

901
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,120
I've already started dancing.

902
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:56,050
Is this how to do it?

903
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:58,420
- Isn't it in this direction? - Is it?

904
00:46:58,650 --> 00:46:59,990
It's the opposite direction.

905
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:02,060
That's right. It goes toward this direction.

906
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:03,989
Look at the All Star Class.

907
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:05,630
They look like they finished learning it.

908
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:08,600
But we haven't seen the dance video yet.

909
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,800
(The signal song's choreography was shown only to the All Stars.)

910
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,540
I should have done better in the first Class Placement Match.

911
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:20,310
The All Stars are already better than me,

912
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:24,150
so I'm worried that they're getting a head start.

913
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:29,080
When do we start? I can't wait to learn.

914
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,890
- Hello! - Hello!

915
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:32,789
- Hello. - Hello.

916
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:35,720
(The Masters, who will train them, enter at that moment.)

917
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:39,930
- Hello. - It's Master Lee Seok Hoon.

918
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:41,600
Is that a new Master?

919
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,900
Maybe.

920
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:46,069
Hi, I'm your Vocal Master,

921
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:47,100
Lee Seok Hoon.

922
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,470
- Hello! - Hello!

923
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,470
He's the Master from the last season.

924
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:55,280
(Cai Jin Xin's bitter memory)

925
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:58,509
(If you keep showing your shortcomings, )

926
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:01,320
(you're just someone who's not good enough.)

927
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,790
I am aware of your current skill levels.

928
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,689
I'm here to help you out.

929
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:08,850
(You can look forward to it.)

930
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,059
Master Lee Seok Hoon...

931
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,100
is very scary. He's a strict teacher.

932
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:16,800
The melody isn't that difficult, is it?

933
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:18,929
(Doubting their ears)

934
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,669
(Excuse me?)

935
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:21,739
(Laughing awkwardly)

936
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:22,869
Is it too high?

937
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:23,939
(Gesturing for help)

938
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,620
It's fine. You'll have to sing it, anyway.

939
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:29,880
We're going to start from the part before the chorus.

940
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,650
Oh, my gosh!

941
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,870
I can sing it, but will he be able to handle it?

942
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,700
I'm confident I can sing it. Are you confident you can hear it?

943
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:39,890
It's all good. I don't expect you to sing well.

944
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:42,159
(You're so scary.)

945
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,990
(Singing)

946
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,700
(Immersed)

947
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,469
(The participants perfectly live up to the Master's expectations.)

948
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,529
(Sol)

949
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,170
(Solar)

950
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:57,460
- Good. None of them is right. - That's what I'm talking about.

951
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:04,509
(Passionately singing the song in their own style)

952
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:06,349
- My voice is going to crack. - These notes are so high.

953
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:07,820
It's so high.

954
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,990
I don't know what to do because they're not Koreans.

955
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:12,750
Why is this so hard?

956
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,059
(Sang Lin shows off his amazing vocals.)

957
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:17,330
Thanks for singing.

958
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:21,900
We're going to take time to review your singing based on class.

959
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,170
I'll go more into details then.

960
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:27,669
Shall we begin, then?

961
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:29,810
- Yes! - Yes!

962
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:31,010
(Good luck!)

963
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:35,380
In the last season, they danced like princes, going, "I shine."

964
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:37,349
(Prince Hanbin's killing part)

965
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:39,550
They danced like Prince Charming.

966
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,519
But this dance is darker and more powerful.

967
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,150
That's what you need to keep in mind as you dance.

968
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,820
- Okay. - Okay.

969
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,290
One, two, three, four.

970
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,690
(The group training begins in earnest.)

971
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,229
(They do their best to memorize it while copying the Dance Masters.)

972
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:00,270
One, two, three, four.

973
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,509
I thought it'd be difficult.

974
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:05,510
It's pretty easy.

975
00:50:05,511 --> 00:50:07,709
Okay. We're going to split into classes now.

976
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:11,679
(Checking the All Star Class's choreography)

977
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,080
(The All Stars have learned most of the dance.)

978
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:17,850
(Fumbling)

979
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:20,590
(I've got my eye on you.)

980
00:50:20,591 --> 00:50:22,671
(Sun Heng Yu hasn't memorized the choreography yet.)

981
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:25,890
(All Star Lim Jack missed the beat.)

982
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,960
Come on, Lim Jack!

983
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,270
(You get a downvote.)

984
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:33,570
Some of the All Stars are lost.

985
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,270
(Guilty)

986
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:41,210
You need to leave if you can't copy this simple dance.

987
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:43,110
Lim Jack.

988
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:48,220
There's no one in front of me, so I can't copy anyone.

989
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:52,589
Are you always going to be in the back...

990
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:54,690
and copying the person in front of you in a group?

991
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:58,220
There are going to be many spots open in the All Star Class.

992
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:01,760
(Let's go to the All Star Class!)

993
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:03,060
Give us a chance.

994
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:06,569
Some All Stars were slow learners.

995
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,570
I'm confident I can make it to the All Star Class.

996
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,540
(Checking the 2 Star Class's choreography)

997
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,510
(Copying)

998
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:22,280
(He Zhong Xing is doing an entirely different dance.)

999
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,660
(I go my own way because I'm sexy.)

1000
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:34,260
(The Masters look cold after watching the 2 Stars.)

1001
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,329
- What is this? - You also messed up from the start?

1002
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:37,430
I also got it wrong.

1003
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:41,239
You have an attitude that no artist...

1004
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:44,170
should ever have.

1005
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:48,210
You smiled when you missed the beat.

1006
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,009
(Guo Zhen and Han Rui Ze laughed and fooled around...)

1007
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:52,780
(when they missed the beat.)

1008
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:56,020
Is that how you perform on stage?

1009
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,689
(No, sir.)

1010
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:00,320
(Reading his countenance)

1011
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:04,630
When we ask you to dance on camera, it isn't just...

1012
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:07,700
It isn't just...

1013
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:11,380
(He Zhong Xing is practicing while Koo Young is giving advice.)

1014
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:16,199
Listen to the Master when he's talking.

1015
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,240
(Furious)

1016
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:21,440
Such a free spirit.

1017
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,850
I thought, "Why is he telling me off?"

1018
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:27,950
Hi, rookies.

1019
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:30,020
Some of them will be good.

1020
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,850
(Lastly, the 1 Star Class)

1021
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:47,470
(The 1 Stars show off their neat dance moves.)

1022
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:51,240
(Well done!)

1023
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:54,410
They're so good.

1024
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:55,840
Jiang Fan.

1025
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:58,710
Jiang Fan, well done.

1026
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:01,119
He did.

1027
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,390
I don't think it'll be that tough for you to climb up.

1028
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,090
We should be nervous.

1029
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:07,660
I suddenly lost all confidence.

1030
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:11,690
We need to practice harder to stay in our class.

1031
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:17,470
But no one has beaten Lim Jack yet.

1032
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:18,699
Thank you, sir.

1033
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,870
That wasn't a compliment.

1034
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,640
(All Star Lim Jack failed to read the room.)

1035
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:25,570
(Come on, man.)

1036
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:30,710
If you get No Star...

1037
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:35,750
in the Signal Song Test, you can't step on the stage.

1038
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:37,490
Is that what you want?

1039
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,190
(The signal song group training ends in a tense vibe.)

1040
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:47,360
I have an important announcement to make.

1041
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,259
(An important...)

1042
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,770
(announcement?)

1043
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:53,070
The Masters have discussed,

1044
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,770
and we will announce the No Star Candidates.

1045
00:53:57,370 --> 00:53:58,570
What do they mean?

1046
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:00,910
No Star Candidates?

1047
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:03,580
Oh, my gosh.

1048
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:08,520
The No Star Candidates that the Masters have decided are...

1049
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:10,949
Zhao Guang Xu in the One Star Class...

1050
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:13,120
(1st No Star Candidate: 1 Star Zhao Guang Xu)

1051
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:20,700
(Zhao Guang Xu wasn't good enough in the group training session.)

1052
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:22,230
This is scary.

1053
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,899
He Zhong Xing in the Two Star Class.

1054
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:28,140
(2nd No Star Candidate: 2 Star He Zhong Xing)

1055
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,840
I don't exactly get what you mean.

1056
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:34,309
The people that the Master just called out are...

1057
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:36,140
No Star Candidates.

1058
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:41,480
I was pretty confident when I first joined this show.

1059
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,820
I wondered if I was that bad.

1060
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:47,520
In the All Star Class...

1061
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,940
An All Star is going to be a No Star Candidate?

1062
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:52,190
- Lim Jack. - Yes.

1063
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:53,630
(What just happened?)

1064
00:54:53,631 --> 00:54:55,830
- Oh, gosh. - Those are the No Star Candidates.

1065
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,570
Oh, Lim Jack.

1066
00:54:58,630 --> 00:54:59,829
(3rd No Star Candidate, All Star Lim Jack)

1067
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:00,970
Come on.

1068
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,910
The No Star Candidates...

1069
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,510
will remove all their stickers.

1070
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,610
- All the stickers? - There's no way.

1071
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:13,920
(The No Star Candidates remove the Star stickers.)

1072
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,950
- This is so harsh. - They have to remove them?

1073
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:26,759
At that moment, I realized...

1074
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,560
that I was the only No Star Candidate...

1075
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:31,330
in the Two Star Class.

1076
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,939
(Training time by class)

1077
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:38,209
- Hi, guys. - Hello!

1078
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,439
(Which class did Koo Young and Xiao Ting first visit?)

1079
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,510
- So, this is... - So many participants.

1080
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:47,620
(In the last Class Placement Match, )

1081
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,849
(there were many participants placed in the 1 Star Class.)

1082
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:56,020
The practice room for One Stars will be packed.

1083
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:58,236
I might smack the person in front of me as I dance.

1084
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,300
Seeing all these yellow shirts makes me feel dizzy.

1085
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:02,059
Did you practice a lot?

1086
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:03,399
- Yes! - Yes!

1087
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,229
The One Stars can't afford to make any mistakes...

1088
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:08,139
as you're on the verge of elimination.

1089
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:11,539
So, stay on your toes and do a good job. All right?

1090
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:12,770
- Yes. - Yes.

1091
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,409
Naturally, I want to be in the All Star Class...

1092
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:17,080
and dance on the highest stage.

1093
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:18,709
I'm going to practice hard...

1094
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:20,880
so that I can perform the signal song on the stage.

1095
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:25,049
First, we'll have to see how you do it now.

1096
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:26,690
You learned it once earlier, so...

1097
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:28,289
Aren't you guys too far back?

1098
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:30,230
(Far away)

1099
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:32,890
Are you afraid of me? I'm not that scary.

1100
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,400
- Yes. - Yes.

1101
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,070
(Master Koo Young in the eyes of these participants)

1102
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:39,100
(Have you been dancing to "Hero" for years?)

1103
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:42,169
(This is Koo Young that we're familiar with.)

1104
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:44,139
(Eyes rolling)

1105
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:45,710
That's the show's editing.

1106
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:46,939
(Laughing)

1107
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,509
(One person can't laugh.)

1108
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:50,280
And I've become nicer than last time.

1109
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:51,809
Really?

1110
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:54,079
Really.

1111
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:57,520
(Can gentle Master Koo Young keep this smile on his face?)

1112
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,749
(Evaluating them group by group as there are too many)

1113
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,460
Five, six, seven.

1114
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:10,870
(The 1 Star participants are lost from the get-go.)

1115
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:21,480
What a disaster.

1116
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,450
(Sighing)

1117
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:26,510
Have you not danced before?

1118
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,590
You guys are a total mess right now.

1119
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:36,490
(The participants in the next group haven't learned the dance either.)

1120
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:53,740
(Nervous)

1121
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,239
Realistically speaking, none of you...

1122
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,909
could actually go out right now...

1123
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:00,880
and confidently say you're preparing to debut as an idol star.

1124
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:06,789
Unless you want to go home now, you must step it up.

1125
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:09,190
You can't perform on stage if this is your level.

1126
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:11,790
If you want to stay like this, just go home.

1127
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:15,600
Why bother trying here when you have no talent?

1128
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:19,769
(Tension fills the room as harsh criticisms flood in.)

1129
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:21,569
Okay. Next. Let's watch the next group.

1130
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:23,740
(How will the next group perform?)

1131
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:32,410
(A participant grabs the masters' attention.)

1132
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:41,390
(Nodding)

1133
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:46,590
Jiang Fan.

1134
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:51,300
Jiang Fan was complimented earlier.

1135
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,969
(It was during the group training session.)

1136
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:55,269
Six, seven, eight.

1137
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:59,070
(Jiang Fan got a 1-on-1 lesson from Master Back Koo Young.)

1138
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,479
(Jiang Fan!)

1139
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,920
(You're doing what I taught you.)

1140
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:11,889
(Jiang Fan was complimented for learning quickly on his feet.)

1141
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:14,790
You're good.

1142
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:16,789
Keep working hard. Who knows?

1143
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:18,736
There might be a spot for you in the Two Star Class.

1144
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:19,890
Thank you.

1145
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,829
I can see that you're trying to polish it.

1146
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:25,600
It seems you're giving your best.

1147
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:28,239
I was so happy in that moment.

1148
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,369
My confidence took a hit then.

1149
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:32,640
But today, it feels like I'm building my confidence up.

1150
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:34,380
I can't wait to rank up to a higher class.

1151
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:38,210
All right. Next.

1152
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:39,210
(The last group in the 1 Star Class comes in.)

1153
00:59:39,211 --> 00:59:41,180
- Good luck. - You can do it.

1154
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,720
Zhao Guang Xu, you're a No Star Candidate.

1155
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:48,336
(Zhao Guang Xu doesn't have any Star stickers on his name tag.)

1156
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,920
(Zhao Guang Xu and Taiga are experienced participants in K-pop.)

1157
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,480
(Zhao Guang Xu was placed in the 1 Star Class.)

1158
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:04,540
(During the group training session)

1159
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:09,939
(Both of them performed poorly.)

1160
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:13,210
The No Star Candidates that the Masters have decided are...

1161
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,919
(The No Star Candidate in the 1 Star Class is...)

1162
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,020
(Zhao Guang Xu.)

1163
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,219
It was a pretty big blow to me.

1164
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:26,630
It felt like no one recognized my effort.

1165
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:30,400
At the same time, I was disappointed in myself.

1166
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,140
(Will he be able to show an improved side of himself?)

1167
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:41,770
(However, he's still struggling to keep up with the moves.)

1168
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,680
(He tries his best until the end.)

1169
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:52,790
Zhao Guang Xu, you're a No Star Candidate.

1170
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:55,360
If you can't show us you have any talent,

1171
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:58,560
you should think about packing up your stuff in advance.

1172
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:00,800
You must work hard.

1173
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,599
If you don't,

1174
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,480
you really might end up as a No Star next time.

1175
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:06,570
Then you'll be going home for real.

1176
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:10,370
It didn't feel good.

1177
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:13,609
Let's focus now.

1178
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:14,640
- Okay. - Okay.

1179
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:18,609
If you want to sing, raise your hand and come on out.

1180
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:19,780
Who wants to go first?

1181
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:21,880
(Me)

1182
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:23,820
- Huang Hsin Yu? - Yes.

1183
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:26,290
(Awkward)

1184
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:29,590
(Then Master Lee Seok Hoon points at Cai Jin Xin next.)

1185
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:33,290
Hold on. It was you, right?

1186
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:36,599
(He doesn't give up. He keeps raising his hand.)

1187
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,399
Okay. Let's go with Phoenix first.

1188
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,029
- Okay. Good job. - Thank you.

1189
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,000
(Please pick me next.)

1190
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,540
All right.

1191
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:48,840
(As there are many participants, it's hard to be noticed.)

1192
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,849
(Master Lee Seok Hoon finally spots Zhao Guang Xu.)

1193
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:51,950
I'm sorry.

1194
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:55,079
I'm sorry about that.

1195
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,180
- Right. - Good luck.

1196
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:57,926
Why did you end up as a No Star Candidate?

1197
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:00,050
Guang Xu, how did you end up as a No Star Candidate?

1198
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:01,690
I don't know.

1199
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:05,090
You don't know? Okay. Let's hear it then.

1200
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:10,899
(Zhao Guang Xu does his best to sing the song.)

1201
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:11,930
- Okay. - Thank you.

1202
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,470
I'll be honest.

1203
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:21,109
You're not a good singer.

1204
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:22,709
Your pitch is off.

1205
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:24,549
And your vocal register is on the low side too.

1206
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:26,280
You really need to work hard.

1207
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:30,180
I was pretty shocked this time.

1208
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,489
(He bursts into tears as he's upset.)

1209
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:41,259
I rarely cry.

1210
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:42,300
What's wrong?

1211
01:02:42,830 --> 01:02:44,900
Is this too tough on you, Zhao Guang Xu?

1212
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:48,900
I became the No Star Candidate...

1213
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:53,980
out of the blue. So...

1214
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:55,410
I'm a bit flustered.

1215
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:03,650
From now on, you can do better.

1216
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:06,519
Show me and your fellow participants...

1217
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,720
that you're giving your all.

1218
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,360
Show your hard effort to the Star Creators...

1219
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:13,830
all over the world.

1220
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:20,170
Then your history as the No Star Candidate...

1221
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,840
will give you a great story.

1222
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:27,810
Don't let that bring you down. Have fun.

1223
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,179
I thought about it...

1224
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:32,980
and realized that I shouldn't stay like this.

1225
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,619
I'm going to regain my confidence.

1226
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:38,420
And I plan to practice hard instead of sleeping.

1227
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:44,430
I'm going to get my class back.

1228
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:48,399
- Hello. - Hello.

1229
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,430
Hello.

1230
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:50,700
Did you practice?

1231
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:51,730
- Yes. - Yes.

1232
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:53,170
Okay.

1233
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:55,999
I'm going to work hard and join the All Star Class.

1234
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,170
I'm confident.

1235
01:03:57,870 --> 01:03:59,210
I'm just good at everything.

1236
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:00,550
I must be in the All Star Class.

1237
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:03,810
We're going to start individual training now.

1238
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:06,280
Raise your hand if you're confident in singing.

1239
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:08,280
- I'd like to go first. - Sure.

1240
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:09,750
- Li Zi Hao. - Yes.

1241
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:11,250
Let's try it.

1242
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,330
(His high notes don't quite live up to his confidence.)

1243
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:21,960
(He fails too.)

1244
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:26,530
(He fails as well.)

1245
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:28,699
Okay.

1246
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:29,700
(Stopping)

1247
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:33,869
You don't have a high vocal register.

1248
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:36,840
It's impossible for you to sing this part perfectly.

1249
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:39,550
I can't sing it. The notes are way too high.

1250
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:41,220
I really can't sing it.

1251
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,420
From what I've heard,

1252
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,650
it has nothing to do with your voice.

1253
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:47,860
You can't just sing falsetto.

1254
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,290
Listen up, guys.

1255
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,929
You must understand this about sounds.

1256
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:53,729
To make sounds, you must breathe out.

1257
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:55,029
(Master Lee Seok Hoon shows them the path of sounds.)

1258
01:04:55,030 --> 01:04:56,600
Then your voice must follow.

1259
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,570
(Focused)

1260
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,130
As for the path of sounds,

1261
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:03,340
it's falsetto, an easy technique you can execute.

1262
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,810
Falsetto

1263
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,340
Falsetto

1264
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,450
That's it.

1265
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:15,819
Remember that path.

1266
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:17,589
Keep practicing to sing through that path.

1267
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:20,250
You just need to remember that. It's easy. It's not hard.

1268
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:23,320
I'm happy to be learning from him.

1269
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:24,689
There's this Chinese proverb.

1270
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:26,289
A strict master shapes an excellent pupil.

1271
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:28,700
I'll do my best to be an All Star Pupil.

1272
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:31,930
(Let's walk the path to All Star together.)

1273
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,499
Who wants to go next? Do you want to try? Sure.

1274
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:35,570
I want to try it.

1275
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,870
Sure. Try it.

1276
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:38,690
Yes. You became a No Star Candidate, right?

1277
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:40,469
- He Zhong Xing. - Yes.

1278
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:43,810
(The No Star Candidate, He Zhong Xing, will try next.)

1279
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:45,970
Which position do you feel confident to take on?

1280
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:48,250
Rap, dance,

1281
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,850
- and being sexy. - And?

1282
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:54,390
And being sexy.

1283
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,459
- And what? Being sexy? - Sexy.

1284
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:59,060
This guy is ridiculous.

1285
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,459
Is that so? Okay.

1286
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:03,560
(I'll continue on my path.)

1287
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:05,970
Let's give it a try. Take it from the top.

1288
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:08,470
One, two, three, four.

1289
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:17,409
(What's up with his hand?)

1290
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:20,010
(Straining)

1291
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:28,790
(But he nails the last part.)

1292
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:31,130
- Sexy. - Sexy.

1293
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:32,659
Sexy.

1294
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:34,329
(Satisfied)

1295
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:35,759
Here's what I noticed.

1296
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,600
You clearly know what you want.

1297
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,900
You have this habit when you sing.

1298
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,110
Does your body tense up like this?

1299
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:45,540
Yes.

1300
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:50,180
You need to loosen up. Relax. Loosen up your body.

1301
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:52,310
Can I sing while lying down then?

1302
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:54,796
- What? - He asked to sing lying down.

1303
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:55,820
Go ahead.

1304
01:06:55,821 --> 01:06:57,949
If that's the best way to relax, go ahead.

1305
01:06:57,950 --> 01:07:00,960
(The final boss of relaxation, He Zhong Xing)

1306
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:03,360
Sing naturally.

1307
01:07:04,290 --> 01:07:07,060
(Full of anticipation)

1308
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:10,200
(He belts out a high note in a relaxed state.)

1309
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:14,000
Bang! Burn it up

1310
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:15,900
(So immersed)

1311
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,220
(The Vocal Master has never seen someone like He Zhong Xing before.)

1312
01:07:20,810 --> 01:07:22,880
(He gets a round of applause.)

1313
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:26,010
But...

1314
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:28,020
But...

1315
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:33,420
This isn't your solo piece. You'll be singing as a group.

1316
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:36,290
So, one vocalist can't stand out too much.

1317
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:37,960
You're doing the wrong thing.

1318
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:40,030
You're doing the wrong thing.

1319
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,120
Do you remember everything I've said so far?

1320
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:43,900
Practice it.

1321
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:46,470
That moment was definitely a huge blow.

1322
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:48,640
But...

1323
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,540
I have...

1324
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:53,840
my own unique style.

1325
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:56,516
(The one and only, perfectly He Zhong Xing's own style)

1326
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:58,279
So, I believe in myself.

1327
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,550
Shining forever.

1328
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:01,779
From what I heard outside,

1329
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:03,650
it sounded like you were practicing hard.

1330
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:05,450
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1331
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:07,320
Nice.

1332
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:11,389
First, I'll help you out with the details a bit more, okay?

1333
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:12,530
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

1334
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:17,599
(Master Back Koo Young teaches them the details step by step.)

1335
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:21,200
That's it. Your arms and stuff have to be in sync.

1336
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:27,410
Look.

1337
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,210
This dance looks cool only when it's synced.

1338
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:33,720
You have to do well with your hands, at least.

1339
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:35,750
- Shall we dance to the music? - Yes.

1340
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:39,120
(Will they be able to do well this time?)

1341
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,880
(Just his hand is facing the opposite direction.)

1342
01:08:47,730 --> 01:08:51,330
(He Zhong Xing's ending pose is different from the original dance.)

1343
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:54,170
He Zhong Xing.

1344
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:58,370
You just dance however you want.

1345
01:08:58,770 --> 01:09:01,410
(Group training)

1346
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:05,420
(He Zhong Xing wasn't able to follow along with the choreography.)

1347
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:06,950
(Fumbling)

1348
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:12,090
(He's even going the wrong way by himself.)

1349
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:15,360
(You can't tell who's a 2 Star and who's a 1 Star, can you?)

1350
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:20,421
(He also maintains his own style during the training for each class.)

1351
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:29,170
Well, it's like this.

1352
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:35,856
(He fails to beat around the bush and says, "You're really bad.")

1353
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,040
You're really bad.

1354
01:09:37,610 --> 01:09:39,450
How did you become a Two Star?

1355
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:44,320
At this rate, you might become a No Star. Will you be okay?

1356
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:46,950
You might become a No Star. Will you be okay?

1357
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:53,360
I need a lot of time to get the details right when I learn a dance.

1358
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:56,030
Is that so?

1359
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:58,100
This is literally driving me crazy.

1360
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:04,410
It really hurt my pride. Did I really do that badly?

1361
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,510
I also tried really hard.

1362
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,809
(Will participant He Zhong Xing be able to...)

1363
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:11,580
(get good results on the Signal Song Test?)

1364
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:15,150
(Soon, at 11pm sharp, the C 1st global voting will end.)

1365
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:16,980
The All Star practice room.

1366
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:22,190
Gosh, they have beverages.

1367
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:25,090
Oh, apple juice.

1368
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:26,860
Gosh, apple juice.

1369
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:28,430
They have sports drinks too.

1370
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:31,206
(There are snacks and drinks only in the All Star practice room.)

1371
01:10:31,230 --> 01:10:33,000
(Snack time begins right away.)

1372
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:34,540
It's so good.

1373
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,170
(Happy)

1374
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:38,940
Is this just in the All Star room?

1375
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:40,469
Only All Star.

1376
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:42,830
Really? Do they not have these in the other practice rooms?

1377
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:44,879
We can't go down.

1378
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,579
Oh, yes.

1379
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:48,119
- We have to work hard. - Okay.

1380
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,549
Let's practice until the early morning.

1381
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:50,989
Okay, let's practice together.

1382
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:52,949
No, only you.

1383
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:53,950
Only me?

1384
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,460
All right.

1385
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,360
I feel like something bad will happen.

1386
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:02,060
I feel like something bad will happen.

1387
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,039
(Snack time is over.)

1388
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:10,400
(The All Star participants start practicing in earnest.)

1389
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:13,710
- Oh, hello. - Hello.

1390
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:15,110
- Oh, what? - Hello.

1391
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:16,410
Hello.

1392
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:20,679
(A special lesson from Chief Master Kim Jae Joong)

1393
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:21,750
Are you doing well?

1394
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,249
(So happy)

1395
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:28,190
I think the other classes will be jealous.

1396
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:32,830
It was another reason why I wanted to maintain my All Star.

1397
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:35,400
I was so happy to meet Master Kim.

1398
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:36,860
But...

1399
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:39,046
(If your vocal cords aren't in good condition, )

1400
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:41,440
(couldn't you have tried harder to dance better?)

1401
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:44,340
(I think it would be fair for you to be scolded 100 times.)

1402
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:49,080
He was a little scary too.

1403
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:52,449
You have your pride as the All Star members.

1404
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:54,150
- Let's practice this well. - Okay.

1405
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:56,279
- I'll do my best. - Okay, good.

1406
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,550
Wait, who can sing the highest range here?

1407
01:11:58,720 --> 01:11:59,820
(Scanning)

1408
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:03,090
(Reading the room)

1409
01:12:05,090 --> 01:12:08,200
(Me)

1410
01:12:08,230 --> 01:12:09,900
It's Sun Heng Yu. Come here.

1411
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,330
Yes, sir.

1412
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:12,930
Sun Heng Yu, let's try it.

1413
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:15,900
(How will his high notes sound after confidently coming forward?)

1414
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:29,520
(He's good!)

1415
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:30,580
(Proud of him)

1416
01:12:30,581 --> 01:12:32,889
Good. From there, a little more...

1417
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:33,950
(A little more?)

1418
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:35,060
A little more...

1419
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,240
(Chief Master Kim Jae Joong demonstrates it himself.)

1420
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:41,999
Just feel the rhythm as you sing.

1421
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,860
Bang, burn it up

1422
01:12:43,930 --> 01:12:45,370
You could emphasize the latter part,

1423
01:12:45,470 --> 01:12:46,869
or you could stress the "Bang."

1424
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:48,199
Bang, burn it up

1425
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,200
You could do that too.

1426
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:51,910
If you keep using variations,

1427
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:53,539
it's more fun for the listeners,

1428
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:54,900
and it's more comfortable to sing.

1429
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,950
I love Master Kim Jae Joong so much.

1430
01:12:59,150 --> 01:13:01,120
(The beginning is sweet)

1431
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:03,049
(The mood of the All Star training is sweet in the beginning.)

1432
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:04,150
That's the vibe.

1433
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:06,620
Sun Jia Yang. Let's hear it.

1434
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,700
(Sun Jia Yang can't reach the high notes.)

1435
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,740
(Sun Jia Yang stopped singing in the middle of the song.)

1436
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:29,040
So...

1437
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:30,940
Well...

1438
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:34,920
Actually, with the way you're singing now,

1439
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:37,720
it's hard to even judge you.

1440
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:43,220
Could you maybe sing it one octave lower?

1441
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,860
I don't think I can do it.

1442
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:57,239
I'm here to help you.

1443
01:13:57,240 --> 01:14:00,140
You shouldn't say that you can't do it. Isn't that right?

1444
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,550
There are so many participants...

1445
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:08,249
who want to find any way to get another star.

1446
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:09,810
I feel like this spot is wasted on you.

1447
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:12,720
This is the worst, to be honest.

1448
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:21,560
- Okay, next. Let's go. - Yes.

1449
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:34,310
(Up)

1450
01:14:34,311 --> 01:14:36,280
(Lim Jack hasn't memorized the lyrics yet.)

1451
01:14:39,610 --> 01:14:41,420
Please play it once more.

1452
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,650
Please play it once more.

1453
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,790
Please play it once more.

1454
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:53,329
Chinese is harder than I thought.

1455
01:14:53,330 --> 01:14:56,010
(Lim Jack isn't fluent in Chinese as his mother tongue is English.)

1456
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:00,599
So...

1457
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,600
Are you tone-deaf?

1458
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:03,869
Aren't you tone-deaf?

1459
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:04,870
I'm not tone-deaf.

1460
01:15:04,871 --> 01:15:05,970
Okay, then.

1461
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:08,580
- Fly up - Fly up

1462
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,040
Fly up

1463
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:13,950
- Fly up - Fly up

1464
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,119
Fly up

1465
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,250
Fly up

1466
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,189
Up

1467
01:15:19,190 --> 01:15:21,590
Up

1468
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:23,260
Up

1469
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:26,230
You're tone-deaf.

1470
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,330
You are tone-deaf.

1471
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:31,469
- You have to admit that... - Yes.

1472
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:32,870
In order to grow.

1473
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:35,439
You can't hide that...

1474
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,100
with your bright energy as a facade.

1475
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:38,410
Also,

1476
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:42,480
I don't know why you're using the excuse of not knowing Chinese.

1477
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:45,479
If that's your reason,

1478
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:48,280
then are you confident that you can be the best by singing in English?

1479
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:49,950
Of course.

1480
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:53,750
Of course.

1481
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:55,790
Of course.

1482
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,460
But...

1483
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:00,390
(Stop talking.)

1484
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,000
(Please.)

1485
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,209
If you did as well as you did in the beginning,

1486
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:15,050
I would've just left you alone to joke around.

1487
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:17,279
But if you can't even find the right pitch,

1488
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,880
and yet, you're just going to give excuses and joke around,

1489
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,680
I think you have to leave.

1490
01:16:26,190 --> 01:16:28,589
Actually, when I see someone with Lim Jack's attitude,

1491
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:30,860
it doesn't look good, to be honest.

1492
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,529
He needs to be humble...

1493
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:34,560
and have the attitude of working hard to learn.

1494
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:40,370
(The All Star practice room is filled with silence.)

1495
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:43,999
(Which participant will have their training session next?)

1496
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,140
Zhou An Xin.

1497
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:58,919
(During the Class Placement Match, )

1498
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:03,460
(Zhou An Xin received high praise from the Masters.)

1499
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:06,750
I can get my hopes up, right?

1500
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:10,800
(Shaking)

1501
01:17:11,470 --> 01:17:12,530
Let's start.

1502
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,940
Just fly up

1503
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:19,010
Fly up

1504
01:17:19,011 --> 01:17:21,910
Just for you, solar

1505
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:24,750
Bang! Burn it up

1506
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:28,550
Bang! Burn it up

1507
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:33,619
I felt a bit nervous and my voice cracked.

1508
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:34,649
I'm sorry.

1509
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,260
Right. You didn't do well.

1510
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:40,560
You're really daunted right now.

1511
01:17:42,730 --> 01:17:44,800
During the main test,

1512
01:17:44,970 --> 01:17:46,630
I think you'll definitely make a mistake.

1513
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:49,440
(I think you'll definitely make a mistake.)

1514
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,810
(After the training session)

1515
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:56,380
I always feel nervous whenever I perform in front of the Master.

1516
01:17:57,540 --> 01:17:59,780
This is something I must overcome.

1517
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:07,790
(The next morning after training)

1518
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,890
(The All Star participants are still asleep.)

1519
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:15,200
(Zhou An Xin)

1520
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,330
(All Star practice room)

1521
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:28,640
(Zhou An Xin got up first and went to the practice room.)

1522
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:33,650
I want to practice the moves and singing perfectly.

1523
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:36,820
That way, I will not make mistakes even when I feel nervous.

1524
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:41,150
(All of the All Stars have entered the practice room.)

1525
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:43,359
(While the other participants are practicing...)

1526
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,360
(the dancing and singing separately, )

1527
01:18:47,230 --> 01:18:50,600
(Zhou An Xin is the only one working on both at the same time.)

1528
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:52,580
You got down the moves really quickly.

1529
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:54,330
A lot quicker than I thought.

1530
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,146
I think I can get it down by the end of today.

1531
01:18:56,170 --> 01:18:58,370
Zhou An Xin was really quick to progress.

1532
01:18:58,470 --> 01:18:59,590
I think he was the quickest.

1533
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,216
(Zhou An Xin tries to overcome his nervousness with practice.)

1534
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:06,010
I must work hard to keep my All Star position.

1535
01:19:09,850 --> 01:19:12,620
(It's raining at the BOYS II PLANET Camp.)

1536
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:16,590
(One person appears at the Planet Camp.)

1537
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:18,360
Here it is.

1538
01:19:21,930 --> 01:19:23,760
(BOYS II PLANET C's new Master, Zhang Hao)

1539
01:19:24,130 --> 01:19:25,130
(During "BOYS PLANET,")

1540
01:19:25,131 --> 01:19:27,600
(he got everyone's attention after placing 1st in Group G.)

1541
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:35,010
(Zhang Hao made his debut with ZEROBASEONE as the winner.)

1542
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:37,609
(The other participants are practicing...)

1543
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:38,710
(without knowing anything.)

1544
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:43,080
I'll go in now.

1545
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:46,920
(Peekaboo!)

1546
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,690
(Shocked)

1547
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:52,160
Oh, my gosh!

1548
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:54,530
(His legs give in.)

1549
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:56,030
Is this real?

1550
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:59,230
(How will the 2 Stars react to Zhang Hao's surprise visit?)

1551
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:04,240
(Finishing up the move first)

1552
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:05,909
(Getting up)

1553
01:20:05,910 --> 01:20:08,350
- We got to see you in person! - We got to see you in person!

1554
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:09,610
You look amazing.

1555
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:11,240
(The 1 Stars get thrilled too.)

1556
01:20:11,810 --> 01:20:13,349
(The surprise was a big success.)

1557
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:14,920
I got so surprised.

1558
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:16,950
I didn't think his face would be that small.

1559
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:18,620
He's so good-looking too.

1560
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:21,090
I want to try living with a face like that too.

1561
01:20:24,590 --> 01:20:26,530
Hello. I'm Zhang Hao of ZEROBASEONE.

1562
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:28,960
(Clapping)

1563
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:33,000
(He spots Dang Hong Hai.)

1564
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:34,629
(He reunites with Dang Hong Hai from Season 1.)

1565
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:37,000
It was great to see him after two years.

1566
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:38,740
It felt very strange, though.

1567
01:20:39,170 --> 01:20:41,140
We started at the same starting point,

1568
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:44,110
but one became a Special Master...

1569
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,761
and one made a new challenge during the following season.

1570
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:50,680
Am I right to call that situation quite upsetting?

1571
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:54,250
I thought to myself, "I'm going to make my debut like him too."

1572
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,020
Are you practicing with my dance video?

1573
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:58,290
- Yes. - Yes.

1574
01:20:58,930 --> 01:21:02,430
(Zhang Hao stars in the dance video that the participants watch.)

1575
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:04,830
How is it? Is the choreography okay?

1576
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:06,430
No. It's not okay.

1577
01:21:07,170 --> 01:21:08,370
It's quite hard.

1578
01:21:08,770 --> 01:21:10,139
Is this just a gesture,

1579
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:12,069
or is this a move?

1580
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:14,539
It starts together with the hand behind.

1581
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:16,509
(The All Stars ask the things they were curious about.)

1582
01:21:16,510 --> 01:21:18,010
The hand behind has to be used too.

1583
01:21:18,650 --> 01:21:19,949
(What are the 2 Stars curious about?)

1584
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:22,619
You have a lot of fans.

1585
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:23,719
Right.

1586
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:25,450
How do you win their love?

1587
01:21:26,450 --> 01:21:28,859
If you have an idol star that you like,

1588
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:32,030
you should make that person your role model.

1589
01:21:32,290 --> 01:21:35,000
You must make that person's strengths your own.

1590
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:37,830
Are there any senior celebrities that you know?

1591
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,169
- My role model? - Yes.

1592
01:21:39,170 --> 01:21:40,670
(My role model?)

1593
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:41,840
(Expectant)

1594
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:44,539
- Senior Sung Hanbin. - Senior Sung Hanbin?

1595
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:45,569
(Shy)

1596
01:21:45,570 --> 01:21:46,710
And not me?

1597
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:48,840
(I see how it is.)

1598
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:50,410
No!

1599
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:52,550
I like you too! I love you!

1600
01:21:53,650 --> 01:21:54,650
(Feeling his forehead)

1601
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:56,619
(Where is he feeling his forehead once again?)

1602
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:58,020
Show us!

1603
01:21:58,490 --> 01:21:59,890
(Show us!)

1604
01:22:00,050 --> 01:22:01,420
(What do they want?)

1605
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:03,290
During Season One...

1606
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:06,790
The star now is a triangle, but it was like this back then.

1607
01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:08,960
And there was a wink here.

1608
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:14,330
(The Ending Fairy you have ordered is here.)

1609
01:22:14,530 --> 01:22:15,940
(Heart beating after witnessing it)

1610
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,470
(Copying what's good)

1611
01:22:18,610 --> 01:22:21,210
I believe you all can make better endings than I.

1612
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:23,080
The signal song has the shooting part.

1613
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:24,879
I could get shot at like this.

1614
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,610
(Getting shot)

1615
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:29,920
(Copying what's good)

1616
01:22:29,921 --> 01:22:31,350
Then I can move my hair back.

1617
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:34,620
(Xie Bing Hua's ending fairy pose)

1618
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:37,030
(What detail did 2-Star Zhang Shun Yu come up with?)

1619
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:42,799
These specialties are what you have to show.

1620
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,160
Show off everything that you have.

1621
01:22:45,030 --> 01:22:46,950
His visit really helped and I felt really happy.

1622
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:50,639
He was a former participant of our program...

1623
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:54,109
and the success he has achieved...

1624
01:22:54,110 --> 01:22:57,740
is why I want to make him my role model.

1625
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:01,180
We all want to become the next Zhang Hao.

1626
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:03,950
I want to give everything I have to become like him.

1627
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,589
When you show your great effort...

1628
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:08,760
and signs of potential, you will become an All Star.

1629
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:10,460
Don't stay here as a One Star.

1630
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:12,760
(Energy up)

1631
01:23:13,890 --> 01:23:15,159
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1632
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,560
- Burn it up! - Burn it up!

1633
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:18,830
Let's go!

1634
01:23:19,630 --> 01:23:21,899
(After Special Idol Master Zhang Hao's visit, )

1635
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:24,170
(the lights are off and the practice rooms are empty.)

1636
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:32,210
(They all head somewhere as if they are possessed.)

1637
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:33,680
Gosh!

1638
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:35,650
- What is it? - What is it?

1639
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:37,920
- Gosh! - What is it?

1640
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:41,650
(What on earth has happened?)

1641
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:45,290
Hello?

1642
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:47,159
Hello?

1643
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:51,399
(They get connected to an unknown phone call.)

1644
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:52,599
Hey, Son!

1645
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:53,630
Hi, Mom!

1646
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:56,500
(Planet Payphone opens.)

1647
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:57,669
Yes, Son.

1648
01:23:57,670 --> 01:24:00,340
I only have three minutes on the phone.

1649
01:24:00,570 --> 01:24:03,080
I'll hang up as my two minutes are up.

1650
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:06,049
I got the most time as I was in the highest class.

1651
01:24:06,050 --> 01:24:07,409
(Time?)

1652
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:09,179
(A small gift for the participants)

1653
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:10,949
(All Star, 2 Star, 1 Star)

1654
01:24:10,950 --> 01:24:12,349
(However, the time is given based on each class!)

1655
01:24:12,350 --> 01:24:14,120
(When all the time given is used...)

1656
01:24:14,450 --> 01:24:15,460
(Call ending)

1657
01:24:16,990 --> 01:24:18,089
Is it over?

1658
01:24:18,090 --> 01:24:20,260
(The phone call ends automatically.)

1659
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:21,660
It's over.

1660
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:24,900
(Call the person you are reminded of the most at this moment.)

1661
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:29,100
What a trendy song.

1662
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:32,009
(Surprised)

1663
01:24:32,010 --> 01:24:33,710
Dad, it's me, Hsin Yu.

1664
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:36,610
I picked up after seeing that it was a Korean number.

1665
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:38,479
- Hello? Dad? - Hello?

1666
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:39,979
I only have two minutes.

1667
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:41,710
Do you have any questions for me?

1668
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:44,326
(Chen Li Chi's 2-minute time attack Q and A session starts!)

1669
01:24:44,350 --> 01:24:46,590
- Do you feel happy there? - I do feel happy!

1670
01:24:46,690 --> 01:24:48,819
Are you getting along with everyone there?

1671
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:50,020
I'm doing great with everyone.

1672
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:51,219
Is it cold there?

1673
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:52,729
There are more bugs, and it isn't cold.

1674
01:24:52,730 --> 01:24:55,330
- You have to cheer up. - I will. Stay safe.

1675
01:24:56,030 --> 01:24:57,099
- Bye. - Bye.

1676
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:59,069
(Phone call cleared)

1677
01:24:59,070 --> 01:25:00,170
Mom?

1678
01:25:00,670 --> 01:25:02,970
- Hey, Son! - Were you sleeping?

1679
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:06,870
No. I wasn't sleeping.

1680
01:25:07,010 --> 01:25:09,279
We were given time to make a phone call.

1681
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:10,910
That was why I called you.

1682
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:12,910
I see.

1683
01:25:13,410 --> 01:25:15,050
It's great to hear your voice.

1684
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:19,550
If it's too tough for you, just come back home.

1685
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:22,520
Did you miss me?

1686
01:25:22,690 --> 01:25:24,460
Of course, I missed you.

1687
01:25:27,430 --> 01:25:29,459
- Are you eating properly? - Yes.

1688
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:31,869
(Tearing up)

1689
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:35,130
I'm talking to you at a payphone.

1690
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:37,940
Are you crying?

1691
01:25:40,770 --> 01:25:41,910
I miss you.

1692
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:46,249
It's the day of the Signal Song Test tomorrow.

1693
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:47,579
(It's the day of the Signal Song Test tomorrow.)

1694
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:50,580
This path isn't as easy as I thought it would be.

1695
01:25:51,150 --> 01:25:52,950
It's really tough here.

1696
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:57,059
I've never been a trainee, and I had no experience.

1697
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:59,589
I'm a lot lacking in skill compared to the others.

1698
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:01,690
I think I'm feeling nervous.

1699
01:26:02,630 --> 01:26:04,829
I'm putting my mind and soul and everything to this,

1700
01:26:04,830 --> 01:26:07,330
but for some reason, the lyrics aren't staying in my head.

1701
01:26:07,570 --> 01:26:08,799
I think I'm an idiot.

1702
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,069
(I think I'm an idiot.)

1703
01:26:10,070 --> 01:26:11,300
You are.

1704
01:26:11,970 --> 01:26:13,510
No. What?

1705
01:26:14,070 --> 01:26:15,440
You're supposed to say I'm not.

1706
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:17,980
No. But you are.

1707
01:26:18,650 --> 01:26:19,810
(Call ending)

1708
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:25,080
I was talking, and it cut.

1709
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:26,490
Each person gets five minutes.

1710
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:29,190
(Idiot approved)

1711
01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:30,720
Hello?

1712
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:33,690
- Hello? - Hey, Mom.

1713
01:26:34,930 --> 01:26:36,530
- Are you crying? - I'm not.

1714
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:38,770
- Sorry? - I'm not crying.

1715
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:44,270
- Did you cry? - I'm not crying.

1716
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:45,570
I'm okay.

1717
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:50,109
Are things tough?

1718
01:26:50,110 --> 01:26:52,650
(Are things tough?)

1719
01:26:53,910 --> 01:26:55,010
Why are you crying?

1720
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:57,479
Things are tough.

1721
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:00,350
(Things are tough.)

1722
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:06,130
I wanted to see my parents as things were very tough.

1723
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:09,290
It doesn't matter what the results are.

1724
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,459
This process is also a complete story.

1725
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:14,029
This is a process of growth.

1726
01:27:14,030 --> 01:27:15,470
If you work hard,

1727
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:17,170
you won't have regrets.

1728
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:19,510
Mom is always cheering you on.

1729
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:22,639
No matter how well or badly I do...

1730
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,340
I always have my family behind me.

1731
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,909
It's okay. I'll do my best.

1732
01:27:26,910 --> 01:27:29,849
It's my choice. I will of course endure it.

1733
01:27:29,850 --> 01:27:30,919
Cheer me on.

1734
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:33,250
Cheer up, Son. I love you.

1735
01:27:33,490 --> 01:27:34,620
I love you.

1736
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:37,919
- Say bye to your brother. - Bye, brother.

1737
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,259
- Bye. - Say, "Go for it, brother."

1738
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:40,360
Go for it, brother.

1739
01:27:41,830 --> 01:27:45,430
I won't disappoint the people who like me and love me.

1740
01:27:45,870 --> 01:27:49,799
I will give my 10,000 percent effort.

1741
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,210
I want to keep my All Star position.

1742
01:27:52,670 --> 01:27:55,070
Let's all receive All Star tomorrow.

1743
01:27:59,310 --> 01:28:02,779
(Finally, the Signal Song Test has arrived.)

1744
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:04,079
(This is nerve-wracking.)

1745
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:10,190
(Hard work proven by competence)

1746
01:28:10,290 --> 01:28:16,730
(Whereas, who are the participants that made the Masters taken aback?)

1747
01:28:16,830 --> 01:28:18,969
(All Star Participant, whom everyone is paying attention to, appears!)

1748
01:28:18,970 --> 01:28:20,729
(Zhou An Xin's skills are solid.)

1749
01:28:20,730 --> 01:28:24,739
(What is the result for this Signal Song Test?)

1750
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:28,739
(What is the result for this Signal Song Test?)

1751
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:31,940
(What is the result for this Signal Song Test?)

1752
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:34,326
(Finally, the day of the Signal Song Test arrives.)

1753
01:28:34,350 --> 01:28:36,920
(How will the final Class for the participants change?)

1754
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:39,190
I'm slightly nervous.

1755
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:40,920
I'm so nervous.

1756
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:43,289
All Star.

1757
01:28:43,290 --> 01:28:44,719
I feel like I'm going into a battle.

1758
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:45,829
(Let's do this.)

1759
01:28:45,830 --> 01:28:47,530
I can do this. We can do this.

1760
01:28:48,530 --> 01:28:50,659
I'm really nervous.

1761
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:55,130
(The participants are waiting for the Signal Song Test.)

1762
01:28:55,870 --> 01:28:57,870
(At that very moment!)

1763
01:28:58,470 --> 01:29:01,670
(Surprised)

1764
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:05,810
(It has come!)

1765
01:29:06,650 --> 01:29:08,310
- He's so good-looking. - Hello.

1766
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:10,279
How can they become so amazing every day?

1767
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:12,150
They are all here.

1768
01:29:12,450 --> 01:29:14,289
(BOYS II PLANET C Masters gathered for the Signal Song Test.)

1769
01:29:14,290 --> 01:29:16,260
Gosh, I'm starting to get nervous now.

1770
01:29:17,090 --> 01:29:18,520
Hello, everyone.

1771
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:21,490
- Hello. - Hello.

1772
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:26,900
Today is the day of the second Class Placement Match...

1773
01:29:27,330 --> 01:29:29,900
that will determine your class anew.

1774
01:29:30,170 --> 01:29:31,170
I'm so nervous.

1775
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:33,069
It was so nerve-wracking.

1776
01:29:33,070 --> 01:29:35,170
With the Masters in front...

1777
01:29:35,510 --> 01:29:39,510
The test will be held in two rooms simultaneously.

1778
01:29:39,710 --> 01:29:42,649
Participants whose names are called should come out one by one...

1779
01:29:42,650 --> 01:29:44,196
and perform the Signal Song they have prepared...

1780
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:46,990
in front of the Masters.

1781
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,260
Participants in the same room...

1782
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:51,820
can check the skills...

1783
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:54,560
of other participants live.

1784
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:56,200
That's very stimulating.

1785
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:57,999
We can watch everyone's performance ourselves.

1786
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,430
I should check out your skills.

1787
01:29:59,830 --> 01:30:02,340
I'm relaxed. I should get All Star.

1788
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:06,509
I hope you all have the determination to get All Star.

1789
01:30:06,510 --> 01:30:10,640
Please show everything you have practiced so far.

1790
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:13,110
I can definitely do well.

1791
01:30:13,210 --> 01:30:16,319
I want to prove that I deserve All Star to the Masters.

1792
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,280
I am going to keep my position in All Star.

1793
01:30:18,890 --> 01:30:22,620
(What will be the result of the Signal Song Test?)

1794
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,859
(Team A and Team B)

1795
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:25,900
Are you all well prepared?

1796
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:27,089
- Yes. - Yes.

1797
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:28,290
I'm looking forward to it.

1798
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:31,629
Master Xiao Ting here today...

1799
01:30:31,630 --> 01:30:34,970
was in the first place in Group C in "Girls Planet 999."

1800
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,640
I hope you receive that good energy...

1801
01:30:38,740 --> 01:30:41,140
and that there will be a first place winner from this group.

1802
01:30:41,470 --> 01:30:43,679
Please cheer for each other.

1803
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:46,009
Let's have the first participant.

1804
01:30:46,010 --> 01:30:47,349
(Heart-beating)

1805
01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:48,579
First participant.

1806
01:30:48,580 --> 01:30:49,880
Who is it?

1807
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:51,319
I'm so nervous.

1808
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:53,150
Please, not me.

1809
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:55,620
(Chrisen Yang)

1810
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:57,389
(The 1st participant: 1 Star Leader Chrisen Yang)

1811
01:30:57,390 --> 01:30:59,359
- Let's go. - Let's go to Two Star.

1812
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:00,490
One Star Leader.

1813
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:01,890
Please do well.

1814
01:31:02,130 --> 01:31:04,200
(Shouting)

1815
01:31:05,530 --> 01:31:07,969
I'm the One Star Leader.

1816
01:31:07,970 --> 01:31:09,669
I said, "Okay, I can do this."

1817
01:31:09,670 --> 01:31:11,190
But honestly, I was so nervous inside.

1818
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:14,140
He must be so pressured since he's the first to go.

1819
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:17,410
(1 Star Chrisen Yang's Signal Song Test starts.)

1820
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:20,950
Okay.

1821
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:24,880
It's good.

1822
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:31,690
He'll get Two Star.

1823
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:37,430
Gosh.

1824
01:31:44,470 --> 01:31:46,310
His pitch is constantly off.

1825
01:31:48,070 --> 01:31:50,939
(1 Star Chrisen Yang's Signal Song Test is over.)

1826
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:52,550
Chrisen Yang.

1827
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:54,080
This is Two Star.

1828
01:31:54,081 --> 01:31:56,549
He's definitely a leader. The beat was on time.

1829
01:31:56,550 --> 01:31:58,450
Yes.

1830
01:31:58,890 --> 01:32:00,820
I thought I could get Two Star.

1831
01:32:01,290 --> 01:32:03,459
I think a participant of that level should be in...

1832
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:05,290
- Yes, that's right. - The singing was...

1833
01:32:05,490 --> 01:32:06,830
Right...

1834
01:32:07,590 --> 01:32:09,776
(What is the test result for 1 Star Participant Chrisen Yang?)

1835
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:11,200
(Chrisen Yang)

1836
01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:19,609
(Chrisen Yang maintains the 1 Star Class.)

1837
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:20,610
Okay.

1838
01:32:20,670 --> 01:32:21,939
This was Two Star worthy...

1839
01:32:21,940 --> 01:32:23,139
The level of completion was so high.

1840
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:25,209
Gosh. This is so strict.

1841
01:32:25,210 --> 01:32:26,530
I can't believe it's this strict.

1842
01:32:26,610 --> 01:32:28,186
I think the evaluation criteria have become higher.

1843
01:32:28,210 --> 01:32:31,420
I think it is stricter than the first Class Placement Match.

1844
01:32:32,550 --> 01:32:35,190
(The Signal Song Test continues for 1 Star Participants.)

1845
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:39,529
(Tap)

1846
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:41,230
(The original choreography video)

1847
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:49,640
This participant has never danced before.

1848
01:32:55,410 --> 01:32:56,640
Oh, dear.

1849
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:03,350
- This is definitely No Star, right? - Yes.

1850
01:33:03,580 --> 01:33:05,156
(What about the skills of another 1 Star Participant, Wang Sheng Lin?)

1851
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:06,190
It's not bad.

1852
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:12,530
It's not enough.

1853
01:33:13,730 --> 01:33:15,460
(Unclear lyrics)

1854
01:33:19,870 --> 01:33:20,930
(Keep going up!)

1855
01:33:21,870 --> 01:33:26,570
(Solar)

1856
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:30,640
His throat will be strained if he sings like that.

1857
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:36,420
It's ruined.

1858
01:33:36,650 --> 01:33:37,920
(Gosh.)

1859
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,120
(Oh, no.)

1860
01:33:39,490 --> 01:33:42,320
- Keep going up - Gosh, this is...

1861
01:33:47,290 --> 01:33:49,900
No. I think I'm going to make a mistake if I watch him.

1862
01:33:55,940 --> 01:33:58,340
This is a disaster.

1863
01:33:58,440 --> 01:34:00,810
The Masters are quiet. This one will be a No Star.

1864
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:02,809
I'm not sure about him either.

1865
01:34:02,810 --> 01:34:03,909
I'm sorry.

1866
01:34:03,910 --> 01:34:04,910
(Wang Sheng Lin: No Star)

1867
01:34:04,911 --> 01:34:06,250
(Xie Bing Hua: 1 Star)

1868
01:34:06,350 --> 01:34:07,649
I'm sorry.

1869
01:34:07,650 --> 01:34:09,549
(Weng Wei Dong: No Star)

1870
01:34:09,550 --> 01:34:11,719
I'm nervous all of a sudden.

1871
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:13,320
I'm really scared that I'll get No Star.

1872
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:20,890
(Zhao Guang Xu was selected as No Star Candidate.)

1873
01:34:22,430 --> 01:34:23,699
(It was very bad today. It's because I dropped down to No Star.)

1874
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:24,929
(Practice Log on the day of No Star Candidate Appointment)

1875
01:34:24,930 --> 01:34:26,199
(I really don't know how this happened.)

1876
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:27,369
(This hit me so badly. I will do my best to become All Star.)

1877
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:28,599
(Effort and more effort)

1878
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:31,000
I don't want to remain as a person who received No Star.

1879
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,509
But I think it became a motivation.

1880
01:34:34,510 --> 01:34:36,580
I really practiced a lot.

1881
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:40,249
I want to show the Masters...

1882
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:43,680
the accomplishments and charms of my practices quickly.

1883
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:45,380
(Zhao Guang Xu)

1884
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:48,519
Yes.

1885
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:50,620
(Let's go.)

1886
01:34:50,690 --> 01:34:52,160
He's in good condition today.

1887
01:34:52,390 --> 01:34:55,730
I'm No Star Participant...

1888
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:58,830
Zhao Guang Xu. Thank you in advance.

1889
01:34:59,070 --> 01:35:00,670
He doesn't seem to be too burdened.

1890
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:02,970
That is because I'm confident.

1891
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:04,600
Go for it.

1892
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:08,040
(Zhao Guang Xu's Signal Song Test starts.)

1893
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:15,919
I think that's a first from this group.

1894
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:17,180
He worked the hardest.

1895
01:35:24,090 --> 01:35:26,560
How is this the No Star Class?

1896
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:35,600
He listened to the song many times.

1897
01:35:39,210 --> 01:35:40,610
He really did work hard.

1898
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:49,280
(He ended with a fatal ending pose.)

1899
01:35:49,380 --> 01:35:51,179
- He's good. - He's satisfied.

1900
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:52,180
Thank you.

1901
01:35:52,181 --> 01:35:54,020
How is this the No Star Class?

1902
01:35:54,220 --> 01:35:56,420
- That's awesome. - He's good.

1903
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,560
I think he'll leave us.

1904
01:36:01,490 --> 01:36:03,729
- Good. - I think the song and the dance...

1905
01:36:03,730 --> 01:36:04,959
- were the best so far. - It was the best so far.

1906
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,569
But how is he a No Star Candidate?

1907
01:36:06,570 --> 01:36:07,810
I know. He was the best so far.

1908
01:36:08,070 --> 01:36:10,900
All Star. Please.

1909
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,470
(Zhao Guang Xu)

1910
01:36:12,570 --> 01:36:15,240
(What is Zhao Guang Xu's final class?)

1911
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:19,110
(Zhao Guang Xu ranks up from No Star Candidate to 2 Star.)

1912
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:22,080
It was a bit disappointing.

1913
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:24,549
But I thought I should level up no matter what.

1914
01:36:24,550 --> 01:36:27,449
(Zhao Guang Xu has a strong will to rank higher.)

1915
01:36:27,450 --> 01:36:30,060
I thought you'd get All Star.

1916
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:32,120
What are the criteria for All Star?

1917
01:36:33,130 --> 01:36:35,490
(I will set the criteria.)

1918
01:36:35,690 --> 01:36:36,700
(Jiang Fan)

1919
01:36:39,300 --> 01:36:42,769
(Jiang Fan goes up stage with everyone's anticipation.)

1920
01:36:42,770 --> 01:36:44,070
A dance teacher.

1921
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:45,769
Is he that good?

1922
01:36:45,770 --> 01:36:47,070
The evaluations are all good.

1923
01:36:47,310 --> 01:36:50,240
(Preliminary Peer review for Signal Song Test was done by Class.)

1924
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,809
(Which participant is expected to rank up by 1 Star Class?)

1925
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:55,479
I wrote Jiang Fan.

1926
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:56,819
- Jiang Fan. - Jiang Fan.

1927
01:36:56,820 --> 01:36:59,219
- Jiang Fan. - He's a secret member.

1928
01:36:59,220 --> 01:37:01,990
His dance is really perfect.

1929
01:37:02,090 --> 01:37:04,190
I expect that he will go to All Star.

1930
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:05,690
It's getting stronger.

1931
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:08,090
Start when you're ready. Music, cue.

1932
01:37:08,830 --> 01:37:11,099
(Clearing his throat)

1933
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:12,129
(Jiang Fan missed the beat in the introduction.)

1934
01:37:12,130 --> 01:37:13,930
- We'll play it again. - Okay.

1935
01:37:14,930 --> 01:37:16,170
He lost his voice.

1936
01:37:17,470 --> 01:37:20,109
He was sick a few days ago.

1937
01:37:20,110 --> 01:37:22,740
That's why he's taking care of his throat.

1938
01:37:24,510 --> 01:37:26,009
(2 days before the Signal Song Test)

1939
01:37:26,010 --> 01:37:27,010
(Coughing)

1940
01:37:27,780 --> 01:37:28,780
(Coughing)

1941
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:36,120
(He doesn't seem well during the practice.)

1942
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:37,919
I have an inflammation in my throat.

1943
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:40,089
My throat hurts. It hurts even when I swallow.

1944
01:37:40,090 --> 01:37:42,089
Starting from the first day of practice,

1945
01:37:42,090 --> 01:37:44,530
it was difficult to sing.

1946
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:52,400
My throat is damaged.

1947
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:55,410
I can't sing.

1948
01:37:57,010 --> 01:37:59,610
(He faces a crisis before the Signal Song Test.)

1949
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:01,580
Excuse me.

1950
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:04,350
I need to go to the hospital today.

1951
01:38:06,050 --> 01:38:08,289
I haven't been able to dance...

1952
01:38:08,290 --> 01:38:09,759
while singing perfectly.

1953
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,320
My throat is getting worse.

1954
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:14,590
I feel terrible.

1955
01:38:16,430 --> 01:38:19,159
(Will Jiang Fan be able to overcome this crisis?)

1956
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:21,160
He'll be All Star as long as he can sing properly.

1957
01:38:22,770 --> 01:38:25,970
(1 Star Jiang Fan's Signal Song Test starts.)

1958
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:33,980
He has the All Star vibe.

1959
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:36,079
- He's good. - They sing better than PLANET K.

1960
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:37,080
I agree.

1961
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:41,450
- Oh, my. - What?

1962
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:52,500
Look how powerful he is.

1963
01:38:53,730 --> 01:38:54,930
It looks nice and clean.

1964
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:04,980
Oh, my.

1965
01:39:12,220 --> 01:39:16,189
(1 Star Jiang Fan's Signal Song Test is over.)

1966
01:39:16,190 --> 01:39:17,560
He danced very well.

1967
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:18,760
He's good.

1968
01:39:19,090 --> 01:39:20,159
He looked sexy.

1969
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:21,389
(Impressed)

1970
01:39:21,390 --> 01:39:23,130
- He must be All Star. - This is...

1971
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:25,860
a K-pop trainee indeed.

1972
01:39:26,770 --> 01:39:29,369
(This is a K-pop trainee indeed.)

1973
01:39:29,370 --> 01:39:30,440
Well done.

1974
01:39:30,870 --> 01:39:33,169
I can't believe that I got such a review.

1975
01:39:33,170 --> 01:39:34,770
Thank you, Masters.

1976
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:40,980
(What's the result of 1 Star Jiang Fan's Signal Song Test?)

1977
01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:43,819
(Jiang Fan ranks up from 1 Star to All Star.)

1978
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:48,920
(Jiang Fan ranked up successfully from 1 star to All Star.)

1979
01:39:50,060 --> 01:39:52,689
I've never seen anyone dance with that vibe before.

1980
01:39:52,690 --> 01:39:54,170
He danced like a current idol singer.

1981
01:39:54,930 --> 01:39:56,230
The dance robot.

1982
01:39:56,830 --> 01:40:00,130
It felt like my dream came true.

1983
01:40:00,370 --> 01:40:02,569
I can't wait...

1984
01:40:02,570 --> 01:40:03,869
to find out how our performance will be.

1985
01:40:03,870 --> 01:40:06,550
I'm excited and looking forward to how it'll be captured on camera.

1986
01:40:07,010 --> 01:40:08,339
So this is the standard for All Star.

1987
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:10,039
(1st global voting will end.)

1988
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:12,080
Two Star Class, let's get started.

1989
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:14,249
(Let's go, 2 Star.)

1990
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:16,180
I like their spirit.

1991
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:19,649
I can't be satisfied with Two Star. I have to be All Star.

1992
01:40:19,650 --> 01:40:20,690
I can make it to All Star.

1993
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:21,850
I can do it.

1994
01:40:21,990 --> 01:40:23,960
I feel very desperate.

1995
01:40:24,460 --> 01:40:28,560
There aren't many opportunities like BOYS II PLANET C in life.

1996
01:40:28,790 --> 01:40:32,230
I'll do my best and get All Star.

1997
01:40:32,870 --> 01:40:35,270
- Two Star participants. - How will they do?

1998
01:40:36,540 --> 01:40:37,540
(Li Zi Hao)

1999
01:40:38,770 --> 01:40:41,540
Participant Li Zi Hao, please come up.

2000
01:40:41,870 --> 01:40:44,309
I'm confident about my dancing skills,

2001
01:40:44,310 --> 01:40:46,749
so I'm not worried about failing to get All Star.

2002
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:49,031
(How will Li Zi Hao perform during his Signal Song Test?)

2003
01:41:15,910 --> 01:41:18,140
(2 Star Li Zi Hao's Signal Song Test is over.)

2004
01:41:18,540 --> 01:41:20,580
(His ending pose is full of Boys II Planet spirit.)

2005
01:41:22,110 --> 01:41:23,119
That was clever.

2006
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:24,880
I can tell that he worked very hard.

2007
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:28,849
(Li Zi Hao maintains the 2 Star Class.)

2008
01:41:28,850 --> 01:41:30,560
Why are you still Two Star? You're good.

2009
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:33,560
He had a very hard time singing.

2010
01:41:33,930 --> 01:41:35,229
(Jia Han Yu)

2011
01:41:35,230 --> 01:41:36,630
The leader of Boy Story?

2012
01:41:36,860 --> 01:41:39,970
(2 Star Jia Han Yu's Signal Song Test starts.)

2013
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:46,940
He forgot the choreography. Oh, no.

2014
01:41:48,210 --> 01:41:49,450
He's having a mental breakdown.

2015
01:41:49,780 --> 01:41:51,410
Oh, no.

2016
01:41:54,810 --> 01:41:57,750
Watching him makes me more nervous. Oh, no.

2017
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:01,189
(Jia Han Yu drops from 2 Star to 1 Star.)

2018
01:42:01,190 --> 01:42:02,450
Something stopped.

2019
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:05,159
They seem more nervous than I expected.

2020
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:07,289
They can't seem to overcome the pressure.

2021
01:42:07,290 --> 01:42:08,560
Is he that nervous?

2022
01:42:08,590 --> 01:42:11,060
I can't breathe right now.

2023
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:13,170
My heart can't handle it.

2024
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:17,570
(2 Star Han Rui Ze's Signal Song Test starts.)

2025
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:21,370
(Flapping)

2026
01:42:24,110 --> 01:42:25,110
You're too fast.

2027
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:30,180
(The Masters try to keep the beat.)

2028
01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:38,060
Oh, no.

2029
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,530
Shouldn't he go again?

2030
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:47,780
(Han Rui Ze drops from 2 Star to No Star.)

2031
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:50,269
If they continue like this,

2032
01:42:50,270 --> 01:42:52,570
there will be an accident during the stage recording.

2033
01:42:55,140 --> 01:42:56,939
Does he always dance like that?

2034
01:42:56,940 --> 01:42:57,980
(Nodding)

2035
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:03,350
He looks frightening.

2036
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:23,700
(All of them drop to 1 Star.)

2037
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:28,469
Oh, my goodness.

2038
01:43:28,470 --> 01:43:31,480
Participant Zhang Shun Yu, please come out.

2039
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:35,209
Good luck.

2040
01:43:35,210 --> 01:43:37,320
- Let's go. - Good luck.

2041
01:43:38,420 --> 01:43:41,150
- Let's go. - Let's go, our youngest.

2042
01:43:41,390 --> 01:43:42,450
Is he the youngest?

2043
01:43:42,590 --> 01:43:44,419
I will do my best...

2044
01:43:44,420 --> 01:43:48,259
to perform perfectly.

2045
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:49,290
Don't be nervous.

2046
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:51,100
He looks nervous.

2047
01:43:53,170 --> 01:43:56,029
(Participant Zhang Shun Yu showed the best performance.)

2048
01:43:56,030 --> 01:43:59,000
Zhang Shun Yu, what do you think of Lin Qui Nan?

2049
01:43:59,610 --> 01:44:02,009
He is my cousin.

2050
01:44:02,010 --> 01:44:05,540
He takes good care of us, and he's very good to me.

2051
01:44:06,110 --> 01:44:08,680
I wanted to do a good job with the other three members,

2052
01:44:08,810 --> 01:44:09,850
but...

2053
01:44:11,350 --> 01:44:15,150
(2 Star Zhang Shun Yu got separated from Lin Qui Nan and Chen Yu Qi.)

2054
01:44:15,690 --> 01:44:16,760
This is hard.

2055
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,800
(The two of them returned to the dormitory.)

2056
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:29,800
This is annoying.

2057
01:44:30,770 --> 01:44:34,009
I don't want to become an idol anymore.

2058
01:44:34,010 --> 01:44:35,110
It's too difficult.

2059
01:44:35,670 --> 01:44:36,910
And so...

2060
01:44:38,180 --> 01:44:40,060
I'm going to tell them that I won't be staying.

2061
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:44,350
I'll talk to the staff tomorrow.

2062
01:44:44,450 --> 01:44:46,490
(Lin Qui Nan and Chen Yu Qi came to see the staff.)

2063
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:50,220
(After a careful discussion, they decided to leave the show.)

2064
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:54,760
He went back to China.

2065
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:59,560
He told me to stay until the end.

2066
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:02,100
I cried.

2067
01:45:04,540 --> 01:45:08,809
(Li Zi Hao kindly takes care of the youngest who feels upset.)

2068
01:45:08,810 --> 01:45:11,179
Don't sing. You'll damage your throat.

2069
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:12,180
Memorize the lyrics first.

2070
01:45:12,181 --> 01:45:15,180
The older boys take good care of me.

2071
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:18,420
I'll fight harder to stay.

2072
01:45:20,090 --> 01:45:22,420
Don't be nervous. Listen carefully to the beat.

2073
01:45:24,290 --> 01:45:26,210
(The younger members are also cheering for him.)

2074
01:45:27,630 --> 01:45:29,630
(2 Star Zhang Shun Yu's Signal Song Test starts.)

2075
01:45:32,260 --> 01:45:33,370
He was on beat.

2076
01:45:42,370 --> 01:45:43,880
His voice is changing due to puberty.

2077
01:46:09,430 --> 01:46:13,510
(The youngest is the best.)

2078
01:46:18,340 --> 01:46:20,149
Taking his puberty into account...

2079
01:46:20,150 --> 01:46:21,779
Right, taking that into account.

2080
01:46:21,780 --> 01:46:23,619
He sang with stability.

2081
01:46:23,620 --> 01:46:25,279
His performance was very good.

2082
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:26,749
I agree.

2083
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:28,650
Okay, you can relax.

2084
01:46:29,350 --> 01:46:30,359
(Thank you.)

2085
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:32,720
- Was he keeping his pose? - He was staying like this.

2086
01:46:34,730 --> 01:46:36,830
I liked how he bowed three times when he entered.

2087
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,360
- I like his attitude. - One bow for each star?

2088
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:45,139
It's probably because he learned taekwondo.

2089
01:46:45,140 --> 01:46:47,409
- Right, the manners. - He learned the manners.

2090
01:46:47,410 --> 01:46:48,439
Of course.

2091
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:50,200
(What will be the result for Zhang Shun Yu?)

2092
01:46:50,510 --> 01:46:52,679
(Zhang Shun Yu ranks up from 2 Star to All Star.)

2093
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:55,649
(We're proud of you, our youngest.)

2094
01:46:55,650 --> 01:46:56,850
Congratulations.

2095
01:46:57,180 --> 01:46:59,380
(Welcome.)

2096
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:00,749
(Sen)

2097
01:47:00,750 --> 01:47:03,020
I'm Sen from Japan, and I was born in 2005.

2098
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:04,520
Nice to meet you.

2099
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:06,730
Ready.

2100
01:47:06,990 --> 01:47:10,559
I don't speak Chinese yet.

2101
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:12,630
Everyone here uses Chinese.

2102
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:17,699
(The participants help Sen who can't speak Chinese.)

2103
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:20,170
If you don't understand, ask me.

2104
01:47:20,570 --> 01:47:21,610
Don't you feel lonely?

2105
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:23,510
What do you mean?

2106
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:26,340
To be in an environment where you don't speak the language.

2107
01:47:27,550 --> 01:47:30,179
(Li Zi Hao teaches him how to pronounce the Chinese lyrics.)

2108
01:47:30,180 --> 01:47:32,119
I'm learning Japanese,

2109
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:33,619
and Sen is learning Chinese.

2110
01:47:33,620 --> 01:47:35,750
Among Two Stars, we are the closest.

2111
01:47:40,730 --> 01:47:43,659
He's such a kind friend.

2112
01:47:43,660 --> 01:47:46,700
Thanks to him, I decided to try harder.

2113
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:49,669
He's Japanese.

2114
01:47:49,670 --> 01:47:52,000
Does he memorize and sing the lyrics in Chinese?

2115
01:47:53,140 --> 01:47:54,539
Start.

2116
01:47:54,540 --> 01:47:56,100
(2 Star Sen's Signal Song Test starts.)

2117
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:02,410
(Go, Sen!)

2118
01:48:08,990 --> 01:48:10,089
His pronunciation is good.

2119
01:48:10,090 --> 01:48:11,160
Is that right?

2120
01:48:14,830 --> 01:48:16,330
(Impressed)

2121
01:48:27,910 --> 01:48:29,470
He dances so cheerfully.

2122
01:48:32,180 --> 01:48:35,280
(2 Star Sen's Signal Song Test ends.)

2123
01:48:37,150 --> 01:48:40,649
He's a Japanese participant, yet he memorized the Chinese lyrics.

2124
01:48:40,650 --> 01:48:42,020
You did a good job.

2125
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:47,290
(Sen ranks up from 2 Star to All Star.)

2126
01:48:47,490 --> 01:48:49,659
(Thank you.)

2127
01:48:49,660 --> 01:48:52,760
(The 2 Star Signal Song Test continues.)

2128
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:55,406
(He’s had a serious look on his face the entire time.)

2129
01:48:55,430 --> 01:48:57,640
(What happened to him?)

2130
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:01,170
I feel very uncomfortable to be around people.

2131
01:49:02,910 --> 01:49:05,479
(He's awkward.)

2132
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:07,279
When we were practicing the Signal Song,

2133
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:11,320
I couldn't get used to being around so many people.

2134
01:49:11,380 --> 01:49:14,950
I've been practicing alone.

2135
01:49:15,690 --> 01:49:18,090
Many participants suspected me.

2136
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:20,829
"You don't practice while we practice."

2137
01:49:20,830 --> 01:49:21,929
"You don't work hard."

2138
01:49:21,930 --> 01:49:23,676
He Zhong Xing is the person I'm worried about the most among us.

2139
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:26,100
Whenever I saw him,

2140
01:49:26,260 --> 01:49:27,970
he wasn't practicing at all.

2141
01:49:28,370 --> 01:49:29,629
(Zhong Xing. It shows when someone slacks off...)

2142
01:49:29,630 --> 01:49:30,999
(while others are working hard.)

2143
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,369
(I think He Zhong Xing isn't feeling well.)

2144
01:49:32,370 --> 01:49:33,669
(He's been distracted during the practice.)

2145
01:49:33,670 --> 01:49:35,069
(He Zhong Xing. I've never seen him working hard, so I don't know.)

2146
01:49:35,070 --> 01:49:36,839
I'm just not used to practicing with everybody.

2147
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:39,880
I'm practicing hard alone.

2148
01:49:41,510 --> 01:49:42,980
I want to prove myself.

2149
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:45,750
I want to show everyone...

2150
01:49:45,950 --> 01:49:47,549
that I've been practicing hard too.

2151
01:49:47,550 --> 01:49:49,190
I want to show them that I can do it too.

2152
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:52,760
(Will he be able to show his talent and get over the rumor?)

2153
01:49:53,890 --> 01:49:57,399
(2 Star He Zhong Xing's Signal Song Test starts.)

2154
01:49:57,400 --> 01:49:59,430
- Gosh. - It's not bad.

2155
01:50:24,620 --> 01:50:26,090
He's fine. He's gotten a lot better.

2156
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:32,260
(2 Star He Zhong Xing's Signal Song Test ends.)

2157
01:50:34,700 --> 01:50:35,730
Sexy.

2158
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:40,870
You were a No Star contestant.

2159
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:44,156
I guess that didn't make you feel anxious enough.

2160
01:50:44,180 --> 01:50:46,279
(What?)

2161
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:48,749
I expected a lot from you, but it wasn't up to...

2162
01:50:48,750 --> 01:50:50,020
my standard.

2163
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:52,720
Good job.

2164
01:50:55,890 --> 01:50:58,660
(He Zhong Xing drops from 2 Star to 1 Star.)

2165
01:50:59,220 --> 01:51:00,960
It's okay.

2166
01:51:02,890 --> 01:51:05,059
Was his dance always that way?

2167
01:51:05,060 --> 01:51:07,430
I remember him being quite good when he first performed.

2168
01:51:08,170 --> 01:51:09,970
Master Kim Jae Joong said...

2169
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:12,600
he thought I didn't practice hard.

2170
01:51:14,810 --> 01:51:16,709
I just want to go home.

2171
01:51:16,710 --> 01:51:18,740
I'm very embarrassed.

2172
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:22,250
All Star. Let's start.

2173
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:24,280
Let's go. Finally.

2174
01:51:24,380 --> 01:51:25,950
Let's see how good you are, All Star.

2175
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:30,260
All Stars are all incredible people.

2176
01:51:30,390 --> 01:51:31,689
(Nian Bo Heng)

2177
01:51:31,690 --> 01:51:33,990
There's a little bit of difference.

2178
01:51:35,060 --> 01:51:36,189
Hello.

2179
01:51:36,190 --> 01:51:38,030
He's the one who rapped with a low-tone voice.

2180
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:39,230
Nian Bo Heng.

2181
01:51:40,970 --> 01:51:42,469
(Goodness. His voice is so low.)

2182
01:51:42,470 --> 01:51:43,769
(Nian Bo Heng received attention...)

2183
01:51:43,770 --> 01:51:45,050
(with his charmingly low voice.)

2184
01:51:45,100 --> 01:51:46,469
The first part is going to be great.

2185
01:51:46,470 --> 01:51:48,610
- All right - All right

2186
01:51:49,410 --> 01:51:51,109
You are originally a rapper.

2187
01:51:51,110 --> 01:51:53,650
Wasn't it hard to prepare for this?

2188
01:51:54,050 --> 01:51:57,350
Yes. It was a little difficult.

2189
01:51:57,450 --> 01:51:58,620
His vocal tone is very low.

2190
01:51:59,850 --> 01:52:02,890
I'm going to sing it well in a way that's fitting for a rapper.

2191
01:52:04,190 --> 01:52:07,790
I am going to show them the strength of my vocal tone.

2192
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:10,230
This is my strategy.

2193
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:14,360
(All Star Nian Bo Heng's Signal Song Test starts.)

2194
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:17,840
See?

2195
01:52:20,340 --> 01:52:21,410
He's like a voice actor.

2196
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:25,980
He's like energy bursting through the darkness.

2197
01:52:29,250 --> 01:52:30,250
Gosh.

2198
01:52:36,820 --> 01:52:38,090
This is charming.

2199
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:45,460
Not bad.

2200
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:48,470
(All Star Nian Bo Heng's Signal Song Test ends.)

2201
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,340
Well done.

2202
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:53,000
Thank you.

2203
01:52:53,170 --> 01:52:54,930
It was great when he first said "All right."

2204
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:57,280
- It was great. - All right

2205
01:52:57,380 --> 01:52:59,309
And it was incredible when he went "Bang."

2206
01:52:59,310 --> 01:53:00,709
(Everyone is in love with his low voice.)

2207
01:53:00,710 --> 01:53:02,109
He's got his own position in a group,

2208
01:53:02,110 --> 01:53:04,920
and his dance moves were quite good too, I thought.

2209
01:53:05,020 --> 01:53:06,179
- His dance is okay. - Yes.

2210
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:08,590
(Nian Bo Heng, All Star)

2211
01:53:08,820 --> 01:53:10,590
(Nian Bo Heng maintains the All Star Class.)

2212
01:53:10,790 --> 01:53:12,989
It was a challenge for me.

2213
01:53:12,990 --> 01:53:16,760
The masters approved my talent,

2214
01:53:16,900 --> 01:53:18,260
so I gained a little bit of pride.

2215
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:22,930
Next is Xue Su Ren. Please come out.

2216
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:25,140
(All Star Xue Su Ren's Signal Song Test starts.)

2217
01:53:29,470 --> 01:53:30,479
Yes.

2218
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:31,540
Great.

2219
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:36,310
Okay.

2220
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:39,920
His dance is amazing, isn't it?

2221
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:42,280
(All Star Sun Heng Yu's Signal Song Test starts.)

2222
01:53:47,990 --> 01:53:49,030
He's good.

2223
01:53:49,590 --> 01:53:51,930
(All Star Dang Hong Hai's Signal Song Test starts.)

2224
01:53:53,870 --> 01:53:54,899
(Proud)

2225
01:53:54,900 --> 01:53:56,300
His notes are in tune, aren't they?

2226
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:01,800
(All Star Chen Bo Wen's Signal Song Test starts.)

2227
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:06,480
(Amazing!)

2228
01:54:07,780 --> 01:54:09,380
It's really neat.

2229
01:54:14,190 --> 01:54:15,896
(All Star Chen Bo Wen's Signal Song Test ends.)

2230
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:17,519
(His heart aches.)

2231
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:19,660
It's like he controls each and every finger.

2232
01:54:20,230 --> 01:54:22,489
After watching the All Stars' talent,

2233
01:54:22,490 --> 01:54:25,360
I realized a rookie like me,

2234
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:27,330
a chick, couldn't compare to them.

2235
01:54:28,130 --> 01:54:29,899
The skill difference is...

2236
01:54:29,900 --> 01:54:30,970
It's too big, isn't it?

2237
01:54:31,070 --> 01:54:33,239
We divided them into classes...

2238
01:54:33,240 --> 01:54:34,720
after watching the first performance.

2239
01:54:34,870 --> 01:54:37,179
And we were more or less right.

2240
01:54:37,180 --> 01:54:38,180
Right.

2241
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:40,249
(Xue Su Ren, Dang Hong Hai, Chen Bo Wen, and Sun Heng Yu...)

2242
01:54:40,250 --> 01:54:41,349
(maintain the All Star Class.)

2243
01:54:41,350 --> 01:54:42,849
I'm glad All Star went last.

2244
01:54:42,850 --> 01:54:44,656
If they had performed first, I would have panicked.

2245
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:46,579
(He Xin Long)

2246
01:54:46,580 --> 01:54:48,089
(He Xin Long appears while All Stars are shining onstage.)

2247
01:54:48,090 --> 01:54:49,090
Go, Ha Xin Long!

2248
01:54:49,091 --> 01:54:50,560
- Let's go! - You got this!

2249
01:54:51,090 --> 01:54:52,160
Hello.

2250
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:55,630
I'm so excited. He's Boy Story.

2251
01:54:56,590 --> 01:54:57,760
(Sighing)

2252
01:54:58,630 --> 01:55:00,870
(Ha Xin Long seems nervous.)

2253
01:55:01,230 --> 01:55:03,870
(During the individual practice)

2254
01:55:05,770 --> 01:55:07,710
I'm not...

2255
01:55:07,870 --> 01:55:10,510
the type born with talent.

2256
01:55:10,740 --> 01:55:14,050
The people practicing with me learn and memorize fast.

2257
01:55:14,210 --> 01:55:16,580
But I learn at a slower pace.

2258
01:55:16,910 --> 01:55:18,220
You don't need to stress here.

2259
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:19,920
It's the right side that's important.

2260
01:55:21,220 --> 01:55:22,220
Look.

2261
01:55:22,650 --> 01:55:24,260
Great. It's already a lot better.

2262
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:26,790
How do you do this?

2263
01:55:27,860 --> 01:55:29,859
You can go like this.

2264
01:55:29,860 --> 01:55:31,340
So there's no need to grab the wrist.

2265
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:35,729
(At the dorm after the practice)

2266
01:55:35,730 --> 01:55:36,970
Are you going to sleep?

2267
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:40,269
Can you help me practice?

2268
01:55:40,270 --> 01:55:41,470
Of course.

2269
01:55:41,940 --> 01:55:44,140
Let's sing and dance together.

2270
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:45,440
Let's start from here.

2271
01:55:46,410 --> 01:55:48,950
I didn't earn this chance easily.

2272
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:52,749
I memorized everything.

2273
01:55:52,750 --> 01:55:54,490
I will be able to perform skillfully.

2274
01:55:55,290 --> 01:55:56,320
Yes!

2275
01:55:56,650 --> 01:55:57,720
Thank you.

2276
01:56:01,390 --> 01:56:04,600
(He holds the lyrics paper tightly, and the night deepens.)

2277
01:56:04,930 --> 01:56:06,399
I persuaded myself.

2278
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:08,360
That I simply didn't get great chances until now.

2279
01:56:09,330 --> 01:56:12,970
That I will be able to achieve my dream if I seize this chance.

2280
01:56:13,540 --> 01:56:16,810
He kept memorizing the lyrics even in the bathroom.

2281
01:56:16,940 --> 01:56:19,580
(All Star He Xin Long's Signal Song Test starts.)

2282
01:56:21,410 --> 01:56:22,610
Yes!

2283
01:56:23,780 --> 01:56:24,820
Another low voice.

2284
01:56:27,090 --> 01:56:28,489
That's the voice of a king.

2285
01:56:28,490 --> 01:56:30,190
Right. He is the king of low voice.

2286
01:56:35,390 --> 01:56:36,430
Nice.

2287
01:56:40,870 --> 01:56:42,950
The one with eight years of experience is different.

2288
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:54,350
He's good.

2289
01:56:56,280 --> 01:56:58,160
(All Star He Xin Long's Signal Song Test ends.)

2290
01:56:58,820 --> 01:57:01,090
He's a perfectly well-rounded idol.

2291
01:57:03,350 --> 01:57:04,460
What's that?

2292
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:06,690
- Is it a heart? - It's a heart.

2293
01:57:07,530 --> 01:57:08,790
- I like that. - Yes.

2294
01:57:09,090 --> 01:57:11,060
- All Star, 100 percent. - All Star.

2295
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:13,560
Actually, this is really hard.

2296
01:57:13,930 --> 01:57:15,829
- Of course. - While dancing like that,

2297
01:57:15,830 --> 01:57:17,539
- Right. - it's impossible to sing perfectly.

2298
01:57:17,540 --> 01:57:19,540
- It is. - But I did it.

2299
01:57:21,140 --> 01:57:23,309
There shouldn't be many people who do it well like you.

2300
01:57:23,310 --> 01:57:25,390
- Of course not. There shouldn't. - It's impossible.

2301
01:57:26,180 --> 01:57:27,810
(He Xin Long, All Star)

2302
01:57:28,110 --> 01:57:29,830
(He Xin Long maintains the All Star Class.)

2303
01:57:30,180 --> 01:57:32,050
I told you. You're All Star.

2304
01:57:32,250 --> 01:57:34,149
It's fun when they're good like him.

2305
01:57:34,150 --> 01:57:36,190
It's actually fun when they're that good.

2306
01:57:36,650 --> 01:57:38,689
Many of the All Star participants...

2307
01:57:38,690 --> 01:57:41,030
looked like professional dancers.

2308
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:43,860
His dancing and singing match so well...

2309
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,560
that he feels like an ace player.

2310
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:48,340
Next participant, please come up to the stage.

2311
01:57:49,730 --> 01:57:51,800
- Here he is. - That one is...

2312
01:57:53,370 --> 01:57:54,870
He needs to be humble.

2313
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:57,480
He might go down to Two Star.

2314
01:57:57,840 --> 01:57:59,880
(His appearance is enough to attract attention.)

2315
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:04,020
If you're going to be someone who fools around making excuses,

2316
01:58:04,220 --> 01:58:06,050
I think you need to get out of here.

2317
01:58:07,020 --> 01:58:08,320
It just made me feel...

2318
01:58:09,050 --> 01:58:10,560
disappointed in myself.

2319
01:58:11,090 --> 01:58:13,089
- Just teach me... - Okay.

2320
01:58:13,090 --> 01:58:15,060
- the last part. - Okay.

2321
01:58:16,030 --> 01:58:19,660
(Lim Jack practices actively.)

2322
01:58:19,860 --> 01:58:22,176
(The night deepens in silence as they prepare for tomorrow.)

2323
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:23,680
(Do you want to go to the dormitory?)

2324
01:58:23,870 --> 01:58:24,870
Are you going to go?

2325
01:58:24,940 --> 01:58:26,300
I'll practice a bit more.

2326
01:58:27,240 --> 01:58:29,210
Just a bit more. Five more minutes.

2327
01:58:30,070 --> 01:58:32,480
(The three of them are absorbed in practice.)

2328
01:58:33,510 --> 01:58:35,656
(He didn't put the lyrics down until he went to sleep.)

2329
01:58:35,680 --> 01:58:39,620
I really want all the Masters to be surprised.

2330
01:58:40,690 --> 01:58:41,750
I can do it.

2331
01:58:42,150 --> 01:58:43,190
Do a good job.

2332
01:58:43,990 --> 01:58:45,830
(All Star Lim Jack's Signal Song Test starts.)

2333
01:58:57,100 --> 01:58:58,140
What?

2334
01:58:58,400 --> 01:58:59,670
He's not in tune.

2335
01:59:03,810 --> 01:59:04,810
(Solar)

2336
01:59:05,910 --> 01:59:06,910
(Solar)

2337
01:59:07,350 --> 01:59:08,990
How come he's been in the All Star Class?

2338
01:59:09,950 --> 01:59:10,980
I know.

2339
01:59:13,750 --> 01:59:15,090
(Solar)

2340
01:59:15,790 --> 01:59:17,220
(Solar)

2341
01:59:20,530 --> 01:59:22,836
(The Signal Song Test of Lim Jack in the All Star Class is over.)

2342
01:59:22,860 --> 01:59:26,600
(The Masters look serious.)

2343
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,169
(Lim Jack drops from All Star to One Star.)

2344
01:59:28,170 --> 01:59:29,870
Oh, my goodness.

2345
01:59:30,570 --> 01:59:32,050
The All Star Class needs to win us...

2346
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:34,839
undoubtedly...

2347
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:38,010
so that we can certainly understand.

2348
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:40,439
I feel I'll go blank when I go up there later.

2349
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:42,026
I think I'll do as my instinct tells me.

2350
01:59:42,050 --> 01:59:45,050
(Other participants clearly feel the pressure.)

2351
01:59:45,680 --> 01:59:49,120
Here's the last participant in the All Star Class.

2352
01:59:49,590 --> 01:59:51,590
- At last. - Please.

2353
01:59:52,490 --> 01:59:53,520
Zhou An Xin.

2354
01:59:53,960 --> 01:59:55,029
Let's go!

2355
01:59:55,030 --> 01:59:56,260
(You can do it!)

2356
01:59:58,160 --> 02:00:01,330
(The last participant in the All Star Class, Zhou An Xin)

2357
02:00:03,630 --> 02:00:05,340
(Nervous)

2358
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:08,510
(You're so daunted now.)

2359
02:00:08,810 --> 02:00:10,779
(I'm sure you'll make a mistake.)

2360
02:00:10,780 --> 02:00:13,510
I always feel nervous in front of the Masters.

2361
02:00:13,740 --> 02:00:17,450
However, I think I can overcome the tension by practice.

2362
02:00:18,550 --> 02:00:21,290
I will do my best to maintain All Star.

2363
02:00:21,750 --> 02:00:23,219
Zhou An Xin is good.

2364
02:00:23,220 --> 02:00:24,920
Zhou An Xin is competent.

2365
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:30,320
(Zhou An Xin in the All Star Class starts his Signal Song Test.)

2366
02:00:55,950 --> 02:00:57,220
He's missing some parts.

2367
02:01:04,160 --> 02:01:05,160
- Goodness. - Solar

2368
02:01:05,161 --> 02:01:06,230
His power is too...

2369
02:01:08,070 --> 02:01:09,130
Okay.

2370
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:13,240
- Okay. - He's a good dancer.

2371
02:01:18,440 --> 02:01:21,160
(The Signal Song Test of Zhou An Xin in the All Star Class is over.)

2372
02:01:22,450 --> 02:01:23,749
(Sighing)

2373
02:01:23,750 --> 02:01:24,780
It's hard to decide.

2374
02:01:26,180 --> 02:01:27,920
Master Kim Jae Joong sighed.

2375
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:31,190
- Thank you for your work. - Thank you.

2376
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:34,230
His live singing is weak.

2377
02:01:35,430 --> 02:01:37,400
- All right. Good. - Okay. Good.

2378
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:39,399
(Anxious)

2379
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:40,460
Please.

2380
02:01:42,830 --> 02:01:44,900
- No. - I messed up.

2381
02:01:45,940 --> 02:01:47,299
(Zhou An Xin's class is pending.)

2382
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:49,709
I felt that I didn't show what I practiced enough.

2383
02:01:49,710 --> 02:01:50,810
It was very disappointing.

2384
02:01:51,180 --> 02:01:52,240
It's okay.

2385
02:01:57,210 --> 02:01:58,719
(With the disappointing results behind them, )

2386
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:00,800
(the Signal Song Test of every participant is over.)

2387
02:02:02,690 --> 02:02:05,159
Your classes are newly decided,

2388
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:07,120
so you will relocate now.

2389
02:02:07,690 --> 02:02:11,599
Participants who ranked up from One Star to All Star,

2390
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:13,699
move to the All Star platform now.

2391
02:02:13,700 --> 02:02:15,199
- Jiang Fan. - Jiang Fan.

2392
02:02:15,200 --> 02:02:16,399
(Jiang Fan ranks up from 1 Star to All Star.)

2393
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:17,600
From One Star to All Star!

2394
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:19,640
He also did a good job during training.

2395
02:02:19,740 --> 02:02:21,170
He went up.

2396
02:02:22,470 --> 02:02:26,109
Participants who ranked up from 1 Star to 2 Star...

2397
02:02:26,110 --> 02:02:27,510
will move to the Two Star platform.

2398
02:02:28,010 --> 02:02:29,010
Congratulations.

2399
02:02:30,050 --> 02:02:32,519
Participants who dropped to One Star...

2400
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:34,550
will move to the One Star platform.

2401
02:02:34,850 --> 02:02:35,950
Hang in there, everyone.

2402
02:02:36,890 --> 02:02:38,720
By this Master evaluation,

2403
02:02:39,090 --> 02:02:41,489
your classes are decided.

2404
02:02:41,490 --> 02:02:42,730
It looks totally different now.

2405
02:02:42,930 --> 02:02:44,130
Is there a No Star?

2406
02:02:44,460 --> 02:02:46,406
(Wang Sheng Lin, Weng Wei Dong, and Xie Jia Hui are No Stars.)

2407
02:02:46,430 --> 02:02:47,900
However,

2408
02:02:48,570 --> 02:02:51,470
after putting together the results from the two test rooms,

2409
02:02:51,770 --> 02:02:54,909
there are participants whose classes were changed.

2410
02:02:54,910 --> 02:02:57,191
(After a meeting, some participants' class were changed.)

2411
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:00,580
I feel so nervous now.

2412
02:03:00,780 --> 02:03:02,460
I think some people will become All Stars.

2413
02:03:02,810 --> 02:03:04,330
Participants whose names are called...

2414
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:08,750
will go to the platform of your new class.

2415
02:03:09,290 --> 02:03:11,490
Chrisen Yang in the One Star Class...

2416
02:03:11,820 --> 02:03:14,689
is ranked up to Two Star.

2417
02:03:14,690 --> 02:03:16,530
(Chrisen Yang ranks up from 1 Star to 2 Star.)

2418
02:03:18,430 --> 02:03:20,000
Please move to the Two Star platform.

2419
02:03:20,230 --> 02:03:23,329
(The first one whose class ranked up, Chrisen Yang)

2420
02:03:23,330 --> 02:03:26,869
In the One Star Class, Phoenix and Huang Hsin Yu...

2421
02:03:26,870 --> 02:03:28,439
are Two Stars now.

2422
02:03:28,440 --> 02:03:30,880
(Phoenix and Huang Hsin Yu rank up from 1 Star to 2 Star.)

2423
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:35,080
He has been looking serious.

2424
02:03:35,410 --> 02:03:37,880
He Zhong Xing in the One Star Class...

2425
02:03:39,620 --> 02:03:41,589
is a Two Star now.

2426
02:03:41,590 --> 02:03:42,749
(He Zhong Xing ranks up from 1 Star to 2 Star.)

2427
02:03:42,750 --> 02:03:44,230
Please move to the Two Star platform.

2428
02:03:45,160 --> 02:03:46,359
Is this real?

2429
02:03:46,360 --> 02:03:47,390
Or am I dreaming?

2430
02:03:47,660 --> 02:03:49,460
I felt so happy.

2431
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:53,930
In the Two Star Class, Li Zi Hao...

2432
02:03:57,100 --> 02:03:59,139
is an All Star now.

2433
02:03:59,140 --> 02:04:00,940
(Li Zi Hao ranks up from 2 Star to All Star.)

2434
02:04:02,370 --> 02:04:03,510
You can drag him.

2435
02:04:05,540 --> 02:04:06,680
I didn't expect this.

2436
02:04:07,310 --> 02:04:08,380
Thank you!

2437
02:04:08,910 --> 02:04:12,020
In the Two Star Class, Ko Ming Chieh and Taiga...

2438
02:04:12,580 --> 02:04:14,950
are All Stars now. Congratulations.

2439
02:04:15,890 --> 02:04:18,359
(While many participants are ranking up)

2440
02:04:18,360 --> 02:04:21,030
The participants whose classes are changed.

2441
02:04:21,990 --> 02:04:23,060
There are no more.

2442
02:04:24,230 --> 02:04:26,760
Now, due to disagreement among the Masters,

2443
02:04:27,060 --> 02:04:31,699
participants whose classes are pending are left.

2444
02:04:31,700 --> 02:04:33,299
(The final class announcement for participants with class pending)

2445
02:04:33,300 --> 02:04:35,070
I will announce it now.

2446
02:04:35,170 --> 02:04:37,209
Participant with class pending, Dong Jing Kun,

2447
02:04:37,210 --> 02:04:39,509
(What's the test result of Dong Jing Kun?)

2448
02:04:39,510 --> 02:04:40,909
please move to the Two Star platform.

2449
02:04:40,910 --> 02:04:42,750
(Dong Jing Kun drops from All Star to 2 Star.)

2450
02:04:44,280 --> 02:04:46,819
Participant Chen Kai Wen, please move to the Two Star platform.

2451
02:04:46,820 --> 02:04:48,500
(Chen Kai Wen maintains the 2 Star Class.)

2452
02:04:49,950 --> 02:04:51,020
The last one...

2453
02:04:52,020 --> 02:04:54,889
whose class is pending, Participant Zhou An Xin.

2454
02:04:54,890 --> 02:04:58,130
(The last participant with class pending, Zhou An Xin)

2455
02:04:58,600 --> 02:04:59,800
Was Zhou An Xin good?

2456
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:02,369
I think he was a bit nervous.

2457
02:05:02,370 --> 02:05:03,370
- Yes, - Right.

2458
02:05:03,730 --> 02:05:06,900
He didn't sing some of the lyrics.

2459
02:05:08,510 --> 02:05:10,069
(During the Signal Song Test, )

2460
02:05:10,070 --> 02:05:12,639
(Zhou An Xin sang off-key.)

2461
02:05:12,640 --> 02:05:13,679
(Goodness)

2462
02:05:13,680 --> 02:05:14,680
(His power is too weak.)

2463
02:05:15,850 --> 02:05:17,510
(He's a good dancer.)

2464
02:05:20,620 --> 02:05:21,849
(Sighing)

2465
02:05:21,850 --> 02:05:22,949
(It's hard to decide.)

2466
02:05:22,950 --> 02:05:24,419
(Zhou An Xin's singing wasn't as good as his dancing.)

2467
02:05:24,420 --> 02:05:26,259
(Zhou An Xin, class pending)

2468
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:28,589
I felt that I didn't show what I practiced enough.

2469
02:05:28,590 --> 02:05:29,630
It was very disappointing.

2470
02:05:31,100 --> 02:05:32,459
Participant Zhou An Xln.

2471
02:05:32,460 --> 02:05:34,136
(What's the final class of Zhou An Xin with his class pending?)

2472
02:05:34,160 --> 02:05:37,530
Frankly, I thought I'd drop from All Star to Two Star.

2473
02:05:39,640 --> 02:05:41,239
(Sighing)

2474
02:05:41,240 --> 02:05:44,340
(What does his sigh mean?)

2475
02:05:44,580 --> 02:05:45,840
Why is he sighing?

2476
02:05:46,410 --> 02:05:47,440
All Star.

2477
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:52,449
Please move to the All Star platform.

2478
02:05:52,450 --> 02:05:54,750
(Zhou An Xin maintains the All Star Class.)

2479
02:05:55,950 --> 02:05:56,990
Thank you.

2480
02:05:58,420 --> 02:05:59,420
(Staggering)

2481
02:05:59,421 --> 02:06:01,990
(He gets weak in the knees as he feels nervous.)

2482
02:06:03,060 --> 02:06:04,160
You're really mean.

2483
02:06:05,600 --> 02:06:06,830
You're bad.

2484
02:06:07,130 --> 02:06:10,429
(Zhou An Xin succeeds in maintaining All Star.)

2485
02:06:10,430 --> 02:06:13,200
I didn't know I'd receive All Star.

2486
02:06:14,540 --> 02:06:15,840
I will work harder from now on.

2487
02:06:16,610 --> 02:06:17,680
Yes!

2488
02:06:21,150 --> 02:06:23,979
(They come to the Signal Song studio at last.)

2489
02:06:23,980 --> 02:06:25,080
I can't see anything.

2490
02:06:26,580 --> 02:06:28,320
(At that moment)

2491
02:06:28,890 --> 02:06:30,419
(They begin to stir in the studio.)

2492
02:06:30,420 --> 02:06:32,060
What's that?

2493
02:06:33,060 --> 02:06:36,260
(Revealing the Signal Song stage that will blaze like a flame)

2494
02:06:36,660 --> 02:06:39,230
(Amazed)

2495
02:06:39,530 --> 02:06:40,600
This is...

2496
02:06:41,100 --> 02:06:42,860
It's totally different from what I imagined.

2497
02:06:43,530 --> 02:06:45,639
(Exclaiming to see the extraordinary scale)

2498
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:46,700
I got goosebumps!

2499
02:06:48,640 --> 02:06:49,910
At that moment, I just...

2500
02:06:50,010 --> 02:06:51,479
The Signal Song gave me...

2501
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:53,440
the feeling of a boy with burning passion.

2502
02:06:53,610 --> 02:06:56,250
This is insane. I was shocked.

2503
02:06:59,220 --> 02:07:01,390
- But All Star... - The All Star Class is maybe...

2504
02:07:02,790 --> 02:07:04,189
- located in the top place. - Really?

2505
02:07:04,190 --> 02:07:06,710
(The All Star Class will be on the highest place on the stage.)

2506
02:07:06,860 --> 02:07:08,689
(Amazed)

2507
02:07:08,690 --> 02:07:10,230
I'm so jealous.

2508
02:07:11,030 --> 02:07:12,300
Oh, my gosh.

2509
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:13,999
That made me...

2510
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:17,470
so regretful.

2511
02:07:17,670 --> 02:07:20,040
- You want to go up there, right? - Yes.

2512
02:07:20,440 --> 02:07:21,909
(Everyone covets the All Stars' spot.)

2513
02:07:21,910 --> 02:07:23,940
If only I could go back to the All Star Class.

2514
02:07:24,040 --> 02:07:26,739
Now, I'll tell you how the killing part begins.

2515
02:07:26,740 --> 02:07:28,850
(The killing part scene will be revealed.)

2516
02:07:29,780 --> 02:07:30,849
(After the Signal Song Test)

2517
02:07:30,850 --> 02:07:35,119
We're now going to choose who will play the killing part.

2518
02:07:35,120 --> 02:07:39,159
(The highlight of the signal song, the killing part)

2519
02:07:39,160 --> 02:07:40,289
Let's go with him.

2520
02:07:40,290 --> 02:07:42,459
The All Star that was acknowledged by the Masters...

2521
02:07:42,460 --> 02:07:43,989
and the performer of the killing part...

2522
02:07:43,990 --> 02:07:45,929
will be decided by combining...

2523
02:07:45,930 --> 02:07:49,299
the Masters' evaluation scores...

2524
02:07:49,300 --> 02:07:50,670
and the participants' votes.

2525
02:07:51,440 --> 02:07:53,740
The three candidates for the killing part.

2526
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,069
Looking good!

2527
02:07:55,070 --> 02:07:56,070
(They look great.)

2528
02:07:56,071 --> 02:07:57,639
You look awesome!

2529
02:07:57,640 --> 02:08:00,310
Nian Bo Heng, Zhang Jia Hao, and Zhou An Xin.

2530
02:08:02,650 --> 02:08:07,150
We will now select the final winner...

2531
02:08:07,350 --> 02:08:08,950
to perform the killing part.

2532
02:08:09,550 --> 02:08:11,819
(Thrilled)

2533
02:08:11,820 --> 02:08:14,060
The first candidate is...

2534
02:08:15,330 --> 02:08:16,389
Nian Bo Heng.

2535
02:08:16,390 --> 02:08:17,829
(The first killing part candidate: Nian Bo Heng)

2536
02:08:17,830 --> 02:08:19,760
- He's so cool, right? - I know.

2537
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:22,600
(How will he pull off the killing part?)

2538
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:24,680
(Killing part candidate number 1: Nian Bo Heng)

2539
02:08:26,100 --> 02:08:28,210
I'm nervous for him.

2540
02:08:32,940 --> 02:08:34,280
His voice is so deep.

2541
02:08:38,020 --> 02:08:39,940
(Killing part candidate number 2: Zhang Jia Hao)

2542
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:42,020
He looks so youthful.

2543
02:08:43,650 --> 02:08:45,620
(Killing part candidate number 3: Zhou An Xin)

2544
02:08:45,990 --> 02:08:47,090
He's a good singer.

2545
02:08:48,830 --> 02:08:51,159
(The killing part test ends.)

2546
02:08:51,160 --> 02:08:53,700
Now, you may begin voting.

2547
02:08:53,900 --> 02:08:55,699
(The boys decide discreetly.)

2548
02:08:55,700 --> 02:08:57,229
I want to vote for him.

2549
02:08:57,230 --> 02:08:58,640
I want to vote for this guy.

2550
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:00,940
I'm not sure who to vote for.

2551
02:09:02,210 --> 02:09:04,940
The killing part of the signal song goes to...

2552
02:09:08,050 --> 02:09:09,410
They must be so nervous.

2553
02:09:11,520 --> 02:09:12,550
Who will it be?

2554
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:17,119
Zhou An Xin. Congratulations.

2555
02:09:17,120 --> 02:09:19,590
(Zhou An Xin gets the killing part.)

2556
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:22,930
First off, it's truly an honor.

2557
02:09:23,190 --> 02:09:25,360
And I'm determined to pull it off.

2558
02:09:26,660 --> 02:09:30,570
(And he gets the honor to be the first one to step on the stage.)

2559
02:09:33,740 --> 02:09:36,339
(This is the spot for the killing part performer.)

2560
02:09:36,340 --> 02:09:37,410
I'm in my element.

2561
02:09:37,740 --> 02:09:39,010
I'm so jealous.

2562
02:09:40,010 --> 02:09:41,380
Let's start rehearsing.

2563
02:09:44,980 --> 02:09:48,620
(The participants are finally on the stage for the signal song.)

2564
02:09:51,050 --> 02:09:52,890
My heart was full.

2565
02:09:53,560 --> 02:09:56,530
I'm going to show them my absolute best.

2566
02:09:58,600 --> 02:10:00,159
Well done, everyone.

2567
02:10:00,160 --> 02:10:01,520
(The day of the signal song shoot)

2568
02:10:02,600 --> 02:10:04,240
(The participants are getting dolled up.)

2569
02:10:05,270 --> 02:10:07,599
(The All Stars get their exclusive badges.)

2570
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:09,740
Do you want one? Be an All Star first.

2571
02:10:12,280 --> 02:10:15,110
(Ready to step on the stage)

2572
02:10:15,310 --> 02:10:16,449
They look great.

2573
02:10:16,450 --> 02:10:18,731
(The Masters paid a surprise visit for the participants.)

2574
02:10:19,050 --> 02:10:20,620
They look way more handsome.

2575
02:10:21,150 --> 02:10:22,289
(Kai Wen looking haggard)

2576
02:10:22,290 --> 02:10:23,550
He's good-looking.

2577
02:10:24,150 --> 02:10:27,859
Music in 3, 2, 1.

2578
02:10:27,860 --> 02:10:29,820
(They start filming the signal song performance.)

2579
02:10:34,430 --> 02:10:36,390
- He deserves that killing part. - I know, right?

2580
02:10:37,800 --> 02:10:39,369
That's awesome.

2581
02:10:39,370 --> 02:10:41,170
(The song begins with a catchy introduction.)

2582
02:10:44,640 --> 02:10:45,780
He's pretty good too.

2583
02:10:46,240 --> 02:10:49,280
(Focusing on how they look different onstage)

2584
02:10:49,910 --> 02:10:51,920
(The 2 Stars enter next.)

2585
02:10:53,550 --> 02:10:54,989
(The 1 Stars enter last.)

2586
02:10:54,990 --> 02:10:56,420
There are the No Stars.

2587
02:10:57,590 --> 02:10:59,460
- Down there? - Yes.

2588
02:10:59,890 --> 02:11:01,810
(The No Stars will perform on the bottom floor.)

2589
02:11:02,430 --> 02:11:04,700
I'm below the stage during this performance.

2590
02:11:07,260 --> 02:11:08,769
I was finally performing the long-awaited song,

2591
02:11:08,770 --> 02:11:12,100
and I couldn't even be on the stage.

2592
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:14,070
It's very upsetting.

2593
02:11:15,370 --> 02:11:17,010
Hi, guys.

2594
02:11:18,210 --> 02:11:20,940
- Hello! - Hello.

2595
02:11:22,380 --> 02:11:23,380
(Tense)

2596
02:11:23,381 --> 02:11:26,749
The Masters have been watching you film...

2597
02:11:26,750 --> 02:11:29,090
the performance. Did anyone know?

2598
02:11:29,350 --> 02:11:31,290
(Not a chance.)

2599
02:11:31,590 --> 02:11:33,289
(Never let your guard down.)

2600
02:11:33,290 --> 02:11:36,460
In the Signal Song Test's Masters' Evaluations,

2601
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:39,259
some participants were ranked up,

2602
02:11:39,260 --> 02:11:41,100
while some were dropped.

2603
02:11:41,570 --> 02:11:42,700
But...

2604
02:11:43,570 --> 02:11:46,800
your classes have yet to be decided.

2605
02:11:47,700 --> 02:11:48,780
(2nd Class Placement Match)

2606
02:11:49,710 --> 02:11:51,479
Oh, my gosh. That scared me.

2607
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:53,910
(2nd Class Placement Match)

2608
02:11:55,580 --> 02:11:58,020
From now on, the Star Creators will be...

2609
02:11:58,120 --> 02:12:02,420
the judges of your Signal Song Test.

2610
02:12:03,620 --> 02:12:06,119
The Star Creators will place you into different classes...

2611
02:12:06,120 --> 02:12:07,919
just from this one performance.

2612
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:09,229
Based on the results,

2613
02:12:09,230 --> 02:12:12,229
your final survival will be determined.

2614
02:12:12,230 --> 02:12:13,870
(The final stage to determine their fate)

2615
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:15,900
I was concerned.

2616
02:12:16,970 --> 02:12:20,900
I was thinking that I might be eliminated this time.

2617
02:12:22,770 --> 02:12:24,540
I'm a little scared.

2618
02:12:25,940 --> 02:12:27,900
(After the signal song was announced on June 13)

2619
02:12:28,280 --> 02:12:29,280
(BOYS II PLANET)

2620
02:12:29,281 --> 02:12:31,296
(the show became the Number 1 non-drama content on TV and OTT.)

2621
02:12:31,320 --> 02:12:32,619
(Thanks to the Star Creators' enthusiastic response, )

2622
02:12:32,620 --> 02:12:34,820
(the global cumulative vote count reached 132,791,951.)

2623
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:38,320
My heart started racing all of a sudden.

2624
02:12:38,420 --> 02:12:42,860
I couldn't believe that I was performing on this stage.

2625
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:44,429
It feels like a dream.

2626
02:12:44,430 --> 02:12:45,860
Thank you for your faith in me,

2627
02:12:46,330 --> 02:12:49,370
and I'll live up to the trust of the Masters and participants.

2628
02:12:52,070 --> 02:12:53,399
(The last night before the Final Class Announcement)

2629
02:12:53,400 --> 02:12:55,240
Should we start packing now?

2630
02:12:56,040 --> 02:13:00,310
(The participants pack their things before leaving.)

2631
02:13:01,140 --> 02:13:03,310
(And...)

2632
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:07,219
(they brace themselves...)

2633
02:13:07,220 --> 02:13:09,490
(separately.)

2634
02:13:12,460 --> 02:13:13,780
When did you put these photos up?

2635
02:13:17,060 --> 02:13:20,000
(The photos on the doors of the Class Placement Match)

2636
02:13:21,160 --> 02:13:23,370
That was a month ago.

2637
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:26,870
Time really flies.

2638
02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:31,120
Do you think all three of us will survive?

2639
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:35,526
The problem is that we don't know how many of us they'll eliminate.

2640
02:13:35,550 --> 02:13:39,420
And we're One Stars right now.

2641
02:13:39,980 --> 02:13:42,889
We're most likely to be eliminated.

2642
02:13:42,890 --> 02:13:44,789
Yes, we're at risk.

2643
02:13:44,790 --> 02:13:47,120
Star Creators, help us out.

2644
02:13:48,790 --> 02:13:49,990
Please look at us.

2645
02:13:50,760 --> 02:13:52,900
We can also shine on that stage.

2646
02:13:54,360 --> 02:13:56,100
No matter what happens tomorrow,

2647
02:13:56,500 --> 02:13:58,239
I'll be glad...

2648
02:13:58,240 --> 02:14:00,500
about getting the most wonderful opportunity ever.

2649
02:14:00,970 --> 02:14:03,010
I realized how tough it's been.

2650
02:14:03,510 --> 02:14:05,410
But I enjoyed the process.

2651
02:14:06,910 --> 02:14:08,509
For the first time in my life,

2652
02:14:08,510 --> 02:14:14,580
I met the people who also did what I loved.

2653
02:14:16,890 --> 02:14:19,560
It's like I found a new home.

2654
02:14:24,390 --> 02:14:26,029
It's all right.

2655
02:14:26,030 --> 02:14:28,500
You can do it. You're so cute.

2656
02:14:29,730 --> 02:14:33,000
Thanks for staying by my side every day.

2657
02:14:34,570 --> 02:14:36,409
(Tearing up as well)

2658
02:14:36,410 --> 02:14:40,940
I hope we all make our debut.

2659
02:14:43,780 --> 02:14:46,140
(The night at the Planet Camp goes by as they make wishes.)

2660
02:14:49,420 --> 02:14:50,789
(The day of the Final Class Announcement)

2661
02:14:50,790 --> 02:14:53,989
Today, you will get the results of the Signal Song Test,

2662
02:14:53,990 --> 02:14:57,860
which will determine your fate.

2663
02:14:58,530 --> 02:15:00,059
This is pretty scary, no?

2664
02:15:00,060 --> 02:15:01,200
I'm so nervous.

2665
02:15:01,470 --> 02:15:05,139
The Signal Song Test of the second Class Placement Match...

2666
02:15:05,140 --> 02:15:06,569
(2nd Class Placement Match)

2667
02:15:06,570 --> 02:15:08,309
(Signal Song Test, Masters' Evaluations)

2668
02:15:08,310 --> 02:15:09,909
(Star Creators' Individual Performance Evaluations)

2669
02:15:09,910 --> 02:15:11,340
(Final Class Placement)

2670
02:15:12,510 --> 02:15:15,479
In the second Class Placement Match,

2671
02:15:15,480 --> 02:15:17,780
all participants will be assessed as one group,

2672
02:15:18,180 --> 02:15:19,880
whether you're in Planet C or Planet K.

2673
02:15:20,850 --> 02:15:23,519
Your final classes will be determined...

2674
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:26,590
based solely on the evaluation results.

2675
02:15:26,820 --> 02:15:27,859
We can do this.

2676
02:15:27,860 --> 02:15:29,380
I'm going to be in the All Star Class.

2677
02:15:29,730 --> 02:15:32,900
The No Stars who fail to belong to a class this time...

2678
02:15:35,100 --> 02:15:36,770
will be eliminated.

2679
02:15:37,730 --> 02:15:38,940
(Shaking their heads)

2680
02:15:40,140 --> 02:15:42,339
There's still hope.

2681
02:15:42,340 --> 02:15:44,540
Getting out of the No Star Class.

2682
02:15:46,080 --> 02:15:48,179
Participants whose names are called,

2683
02:15:48,180 --> 02:15:51,309
please turn over your class card on the table...

2684
02:15:51,310 --> 02:15:54,519
to check your final class.

2685
02:15:54,520 --> 02:15:56,090
The class is on the back of the card!

2686
02:15:56,650 --> 02:16:00,760
Who will smile, and who will be left in tears?

2687
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:05,400
Your final classes will be announced now.

2688
02:16:06,500 --> 02:16:07,899
(What will happen to them?)

2689
02:16:07,900 --> 02:16:09,429
Please don't kick me out.

2690
02:16:09,430 --> 02:16:10,969
Let's cheer up, everyone.

2691
02:16:10,970 --> 02:16:12,599
First...

2692
02:16:12,600 --> 02:16:13,639
We're starting right away!

2693
02:16:13,640 --> 02:16:14,839
I'm terrified.

2694
02:16:14,840 --> 02:16:16,640
I can feel my heart rate going up.

2695
02:16:17,210 --> 02:16:19,439
(Whose class will be determined first?)

2696
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:23,380
All Star He Xin Long.

2697
02:16:23,810 --> 02:16:25,650
(Me?)

2698
02:16:27,020 --> 02:16:29,620
(Relieved for now)

2699
02:16:30,050 --> 02:16:31,589
I bet He Xin Long will be an All Star.

2700
02:16:31,590 --> 02:16:33,489
He's been in the All Star Class the whole time...

2701
02:16:33,490 --> 02:16:35,160
since the Class Placement Match.

2702
02:16:35,930 --> 02:16:39,129
(He Xin Long has always been in the All Star Class.)

2703
02:16:39,130 --> 02:16:40,360
(He Xin Long, All Star)

2704
02:16:40,600 --> 02:16:41,830
He's definitely an All Star.

2705
02:16:42,030 --> 02:16:43,470
Boy Story's hope!

2706
02:16:45,800 --> 02:16:47,599
(He can't find his photo.)

2707
02:16:47,600 --> 02:16:49,309
(Getting playful)

2708
02:16:49,310 --> 02:16:51,509
You're eliminated if you fail to find your card in five seconds.

2709
02:16:51,510 --> 02:16:52,780
(Rushing)

2710
02:16:54,210 --> 02:16:55,210
Are you nervous?

2711
02:16:55,480 --> 02:16:58,320
This is making me so nervous.

2712
02:16:58,380 --> 02:17:00,449
(I'm right here.)

2713
02:17:00,450 --> 02:17:01,850
(Inhaling sharply)

2714
02:17:03,290 --> 02:17:05,119
(What's He Xin Long's final class?)

2715
02:17:05,120 --> 02:17:06,519
It has to be All Star.

2716
02:17:06,520 --> 02:17:08,560
It's All Star, right? I'm so nervous.

2717
02:17:08,990 --> 02:17:12,700
I think that side might be better.

2718
02:17:13,930 --> 02:17:15,930
(Is he heading to the No Star sign?)

2719
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,029
(That can't be.)

2720
02:17:18,030 --> 02:17:20,040
(What? Where is he going?)

2721
02:17:20,540 --> 02:17:21,670
What? We don't know either.

2722
02:17:22,310 --> 02:17:24,346
(Did All Star He Xin Long get placed in the No Star Class?)

2723
02:17:24,370 --> 02:17:25,810
- All Star. - Let me check it first.

2724
02:17:26,480 --> 02:17:29,049
(He Xin Long is checking his class far away from them.)

2725
02:17:29,050 --> 02:17:30,209
(Sighing)

2726
02:17:30,210 --> 02:17:31,610
(What's He Xin Long's final class?)

2727
02:17:32,080 --> 02:17:33,080
Two Star?

2728
02:17:33,480 --> 02:17:35,090
(What will it be?)

2729
02:17:35,490 --> 02:17:37,620
(He Xin Long's final class is All Star.)

2730
02:17:38,150 --> 02:17:40,390
(He's indeed the hope of Boy Story.)

2731
02:17:40,820 --> 02:17:42,160
The first All Star.

2732
02:17:42,290 --> 02:17:45,000
He's popular and talented.

2733
02:17:45,500 --> 02:17:47,100
That's so cool.

2734
02:17:47,560 --> 02:17:49,146
Let's continue with the next participant.

2735
02:17:49,170 --> 02:17:51,130
Nian Bo Heng from the All Star Class.

2736
02:17:53,070 --> 02:17:54,670
Nian, let's go!

2737
02:17:55,070 --> 02:17:56,910
Gosh, he was in the rap unit.

2738
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:58,609
- It has to be All Star. - It must be All Star.

2739
02:17:58,610 --> 02:18:02,410
(He stood out as a part of the rap unit in the signal song.)

2740
02:18:03,310 --> 02:18:06,050
(What's Nian Bo Heng's final class?)

2741
02:18:10,890 --> 02:18:12,260
He doesn't look so happy.

2742
02:18:13,390 --> 02:18:15,160
(Nian Bo Heng's final class is All Star.)

2743
02:18:15,790 --> 02:18:18,800
(Lim Jack is genuinely happy for him.)

2744
02:18:20,760 --> 02:18:23,729
I'll work harder, so I can put on a better performance.

2745
02:18:23,730 --> 02:18:24,730
Thank you.

2746
02:18:24,731 --> 02:18:25,770
Next participant.

2747
02:18:26,140 --> 02:18:27,399
Zhou An Xin.

2748
02:18:27,400 --> 02:18:28,569
(Participant Zhou An Xin from the All Star Class)

2749
02:18:28,570 --> 02:18:29,969
He'll be in the All Star no matter what.

2750
02:18:29,970 --> 02:18:31,490
He doesn't even need to flip the card.

2751
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:33,639
(He grabs it...)

2752
02:18:33,640 --> 02:18:35,950
(and quickly scans it.)

2753
02:18:41,550 --> 02:18:43,490
(He goes straight to the All Star sign.)

2754
02:18:43,590 --> 02:18:44,966
I knew it the moment his name was called.

2755
02:18:44,990 --> 02:18:46,019
He didn't even pretend.

2756
02:18:46,020 --> 02:18:47,190
I'm so envious.

2757
02:18:48,060 --> 02:18:49,389
Dang Hong Hai.

2758
02:18:49,390 --> 02:18:50,870
(Next up is All Start Dang Hong Hai.)

2759
02:18:52,300 --> 02:18:53,959
He'll be placed in the All Star Class for sure.

2760
02:18:53,960 --> 02:18:55,370
It has to be All Star.

2761
02:18:58,270 --> 02:18:59,440
I bet it's All Star.

2762
02:19:00,100 --> 02:19:05,909
(Is his final class All Star as expected?)

2763
02:19:05,910 --> 02:19:07,510
(Is he going to the 2 Star sign?)

2764
02:19:09,580 --> 02:19:10,610
For real?

2765
02:19:11,580 --> 02:19:13,660
His individual performance video got a lot of views.

2766
02:19:14,550 --> 02:19:17,690
What did I do wrong to be placed in the Two Star Class?

2767
02:19:18,590 --> 02:19:20,496
The other All Star participants went to Two Star.

2768
02:19:20,520 --> 02:19:22,189
(The final class for Jiang Fan...)

2769
02:19:22,190 --> 02:19:23,529
(and Sun Heng Yu is 2 Star.)

2770
02:19:23,530 --> 02:19:24,859
(All Star participants got placed in a lower class.)

2771
02:19:24,860 --> 02:19:26,260
(Shaking)

2772
02:19:30,500 --> 02:19:32,999
(Bian Shi Yu...)

2773
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:34,899
(and Li Zi Hao also dropped from All Star to 2 Star.)

2774
02:19:34,900 --> 02:19:38,440
All the talented ones were placed in the Two Star Class.

2775
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:41,110
More of them should move down. Leave some room for us.

2776
02:19:41,780 --> 02:19:44,350
(All Star Ko Ming Chieh is called out next.)

2777
02:19:48,420 --> 02:19:50,119
(He walks past the 2 Star Zone.)

2778
02:19:50,120 --> 02:19:52,190
(Ko Ming Chieh goes to the 1 Star Zone.)

2779
02:19:55,290 --> 02:19:56,329
Did you really get One Star?

2780
02:19:56,330 --> 02:19:57,330
(Ko Ming Chieh's final class is 1 Star.)

2781
02:19:57,331 --> 02:19:58,759
To One Star from All Star?

2782
02:19:58,760 --> 02:20:01,260
He was an All Star. How did he end up as a One Star?

2783
02:20:01,560 --> 02:20:02,670
One Star.

2784
02:20:02,870 --> 02:20:04,530
If an All Star can become a One Star...

2785
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:07,000
(Sniffling)

2786
02:20:08,510 --> 02:20:09,610
(Sniffling)

2787
02:20:09,810 --> 02:20:11,369
(All Star Chen Bo Wen tears up out of fear.)

2788
02:20:11,370 --> 02:20:12,610
It's all right.

2789
02:20:13,310 --> 02:20:15,610
No one thought you were bad after watching your video.

2790
02:20:16,150 --> 02:20:17,150
(Sniffling)

2791
02:20:17,151 --> 02:20:19,850
I was worried if I could survive.

2792
02:20:20,520 --> 02:20:23,020
(What's All Star Chen Bo Wen's final class?)

2793
02:20:27,320 --> 02:20:30,760
(What does his tear mean?)

2794
02:20:35,470 --> 02:20:38,130
(Chen Bo Wen's final class is All Star.)

2795
02:20:38,370 --> 02:20:39,499
(Smiling)

2796
02:20:39,500 --> 02:20:41,239
(The participants congratulates him.)

2797
02:20:41,240 --> 02:20:42,609
(Babying him)

2798
02:20:42,610 --> 02:20:44,910
I wasn't going to cry.

2799
02:20:45,540 --> 02:20:46,740
He cried.

2800
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:49,779
(The final class for the former All Stars is announced.)

2801
02:20:49,780 --> 02:20:51,356
Many All Stars are in the Two Star Class.

2802
02:20:51,380 --> 02:20:54,450
I wonder who's going to be an All Star then.

2803
02:20:54,780 --> 02:20:56,220
I'm sure Fan Zhe Yi can rank up.

2804
02:20:56,690 --> 02:20:58,590
I bet Fan Zhe Yi will be an All Star.

2805
02:20:59,160 --> 02:21:00,259
Fan Zhe Yi.

2806
02:21:00,260 --> 02:21:01,620
(What's Fan Zhe Yi's final class?)

2807
02:21:01,690 --> 02:21:03,860
(Fan Zhe Yi smiles after checking the result.)

2808
02:21:03,990 --> 02:21:05,959
(Is it All Star?)

2809
02:21:05,960 --> 02:21:07,830
(Is it 2 Star?)

2810
02:21:08,060 --> 02:21:11,329
(Fan Zhe Yi's final class is 1 Star.)

2811
02:21:11,330 --> 02:21:12,810
He's a One Star when he's so popular?

2812
02:21:12,940 --> 02:21:15,240
You didn't take the wrong one? Are you sure?

2813
02:21:15,370 --> 02:21:17,640
If he ends up as a One Star, what will happen to us?

2814
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:18,979
Huang Hsin Yu.

2815
02:21:18,980 --> 02:21:21,080
(Huang Hsin Yu's final class will be announced.)

2816
02:21:21,880 --> 02:21:23,779
(What does his bright smile mean?)

2817
02:21:23,780 --> 02:21:25,450
- Is it good news? - All Star?

2818
02:21:25,850 --> 02:21:27,180
It might be 2 or 1 Star.

2819
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:29,890
(What's Huang Hsin Yu's final class?)

2820
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:33,419
(Where's he going?)

2821
02:21:33,420 --> 02:21:35,459
(Huang Hsin Yu's final class is No Star.)

2822
02:21:35,460 --> 02:21:36,590
You're lying!

2823
02:21:39,500 --> 02:21:41,360
- You're acting, right? - You're lying!

2824
02:21:43,800 --> 02:21:44,870
He got a No Star?

2825
02:21:47,600 --> 02:21:48,740
He really got a No Star.

2826
02:21:49,910 --> 02:21:51,709
(The result shocks everyone.)

2827
02:21:51,710 --> 02:21:52,839
I can't believe this.

2828
02:21:52,840 --> 02:21:53,909
Oh, no.

2829
02:21:53,910 --> 02:21:55,549
He went from Two Star to No Star?

2830
02:21:55,550 --> 02:21:57,050
Oh, no.

2831
02:21:58,050 --> 02:22:00,520
What? I didn't even cry. Why are you crying?

2832
02:22:00,780 --> 02:22:02,990
What? I didn't even cry. Why are you crying?

2833
02:22:03,950 --> 02:22:05,460
It's okay.

2834
02:22:06,760 --> 02:22:07,860
What is it?

2835
02:22:08,120 --> 02:22:09,290
I want to cry too.

2836
02:22:10,030 --> 02:22:11,229
Wong Sik Hei.

2837
02:22:11,230 --> 02:22:12,399
(Wong Sik Hei's final class is No Star.)

2838
02:22:12,400 --> 02:22:14,230
(Phoenix's final class is No Star.)

2839
02:22:14,700 --> 02:22:17,700
(Zheng Ren Yu's final class is No Star.)

2840
02:22:17,770 --> 02:22:23,110
(Qiao Guan Zhen's final class is No Star.)

2841
02:22:23,210 --> 02:22:24,510
No.

2842
02:22:25,170 --> 02:22:26,839
(Tension fills the room...)

2843
02:22:26,840 --> 02:22:29,040
(as more participants are placed in the No Star Class.)

2844
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:32,350
(Tears fall and sighs follow as the result is hard to take in.)

2845
02:22:33,480 --> 02:22:35,990
(Getting emotional)

2846
02:22:36,250 --> 02:22:37,589
(Remaining participants)

2847
02:22:37,590 --> 02:22:39,519
(4 in the 2 Star Class and 22 in the 1 Star Class)

2848
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:43,330
As for the remaining spots,

2849
02:22:46,030 --> 02:22:49,399
there are only three left.

2850
02:22:49,400 --> 02:22:50,570
- What? - What?

2851
02:22:51,200 --> 02:22:52,760
What will happen to the One Star Class?

2852
02:22:52,970 --> 02:22:54,040
This is too harsh.

2853
02:22:54,440 --> 02:22:56,439
(There are far too few spots left...)

2854
02:22:56,440 --> 02:22:58,440
(for the number of participants remaining.)

2855
02:22:58,540 --> 02:23:00,509
Who will be the last three survivors...

2856
02:23:00,510 --> 02:23:03,680
that can remain on the show?

2857
02:23:04,780 --> 02:23:06,780
I think it will be Hu Han Wen and He Zhong Xing.

2858
02:23:07,220 --> 02:23:09,720
I think Chen Kai Wen has a shot at making it.

2859
02:23:09,950 --> 02:23:11,519
I think you will advance too.

2860
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:12,520
Lim Jack too.

2861
02:23:13,020 --> 02:23:14,160
I want to advance.

2862
02:23:14,690 --> 02:23:17,130
(Who will be the last 3 survivors?)

2863
02:23:17,260 --> 02:23:18,330
Krystian.

2864
02:23:18,800 --> 02:23:20,100
Chen Kai Wen.

2865
02:23:20,730 --> 02:23:21,970
Chen Kai Wen will make it.

2866
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:25,000
(The two participants check their class card.)

2867
02:23:27,940 --> 02:23:30,710
(Krystian smiles after checking his class.)

2868
02:23:33,340 --> 02:23:37,680
(On the other hand, Chen Kai Wen frown.)

2869
02:23:37,850 --> 02:23:39,680
He doesn't look happy.

2870
02:23:42,590 --> 02:23:44,250
(Chen Kai Wen's final class is 1 Star.)

2871
02:23:44,290 --> 02:23:45,960
One Star?

2872
02:23:46,060 --> 02:23:47,060
His class went down too.

2873
02:23:48,930 --> 02:23:52,500
(On the other hand, Krystian smiled. What's his final class?)

2874
02:23:53,960 --> 02:23:56,270
(Is he going straight to the No Star Zone?)

2875
02:23:57,900 --> 02:23:58,999
(Krystian's final class is No Star.)

2876
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:00,770
It's okay, Krystian.

2877
02:24:01,370 --> 02:24:02,869
Hu Han Wen.

2878
02:24:02,870 --> 02:24:05,440
(He anxiously checks his class card.)

2879
02:24:09,950 --> 02:24:11,050
(Bowing)

2880
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:14,649
(He bows to everyone.)

2881
02:24:14,650 --> 02:24:16,119
(Is he saying goodbye?)

2882
02:24:16,120 --> 02:24:17,320
No. It can't be.

2883
02:24:17,950 --> 02:24:19,459
I bet he passed. Look at him smiling.

2884
02:24:19,460 --> 02:24:21,389
(Where is he pointing at?)

2885
02:24:21,390 --> 02:24:22,830
(The No Star Zone)

2886
02:24:23,890 --> 02:24:25,089
(It can't be!)

2887
02:24:25,090 --> 02:24:28,600
(The participants can't believe it and check his class card.)

2888
02:24:33,400 --> 02:24:36,409
Gosh, I was mistaken.

2889
02:24:36,410 --> 02:24:39,540
(Look at this silly guy.)

2890
02:24:42,380 --> 02:24:44,749
(He flounders out of embarrassment.)

2891
02:24:44,750 --> 02:24:46,620
You gave us a scare!

2892
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:50,390
(I survived.)

2893
02:24:50,420 --> 02:24:52,990
(He pretended to be cool only 1 minute ago.)

2894
02:24:53,090 --> 02:24:54,319
Thank you.

2895
02:24:54,320 --> 02:24:56,060
(Hu Han Wen's final class is 1 Star.)

2896
02:24:57,960 --> 02:24:59,400
This is the last spot.

2897
02:25:01,560 --> 02:25:03,730
As for the remaining spots,

2898
02:25:03,970 --> 02:25:05,699
there's only one left.

2899
02:25:05,700 --> 02:25:07,070
I think Lim Jack will advance.

2900
02:25:08,910 --> 02:25:11,239
(2 Star He Zhong Xing's final class will be revealed.)

2901
02:25:11,240 --> 02:25:12,320
There's only one spot left.

2902
02:25:12,580 --> 02:25:13,610
Oh, no.

2903
02:25:14,180 --> 02:25:15,380
I probably won't advance.

2904
02:25:16,680 --> 02:25:17,710
I'm nervous.

2905
02:25:17,980 --> 02:25:19,750
(What's He Zhong Xing's final class?)

2906
02:25:24,020 --> 02:25:26,589
(Smiling)

2907
02:25:26,590 --> 02:25:28,090
What does that mean, Zhong Xing?

2908
02:25:28,490 --> 02:25:30,689
(He Zhong Xing walks over with a straight face on.)

2909
02:25:30,690 --> 02:25:31,789
He looks so serious.

2910
02:25:31,790 --> 02:25:33,576
Given his facial expression, it must be a No Star.

2911
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:38,840
(Will He Zhong Xing be able to become the last survivor?)

2912
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,639
(Smiling)

2913
02:25:43,640 --> 02:25:45,409
What does that mean, Zhong Xing?

2914
02:25:45,410 --> 02:25:50,810
(Will He Zhong Xing be able to take the last spot?)

2915
02:25:50,910 --> 02:25:54,180
I hope I can stay here on the show a little longer.

2916
02:25:54,450 --> 02:25:56,490
I just want to survive.

2917
02:25:57,050 --> 02:26:00,160
I really don't want to get dropped out.

2918
02:26:00,360 --> 02:26:04,230
(Where has He Zhong Xing arrived at last?)

2919
02:26:04,660 --> 02:26:06,930
(BOYS II PLANET's final survivor, He Zhong Xing)

2920
02:26:06,960 --> 02:26:09,369
(He Zhong Xing's final class, 1 Star)

2921
02:26:09,370 --> 02:26:13,100
Yes, the final survivor was participant He Zhong Xing.

2922
02:26:17,640 --> 02:26:19,610
The final class announcement of...

2923
02:26:19,710 --> 02:26:22,450
the Second Class Placement Match has come to an end.

2924
02:26:23,010 --> 02:26:26,379
Sadly, the participants who have been eliminated...

2925
02:26:26,380 --> 02:26:30,490
will be leaving BOYS II PLANET as of today.

2926
02:26:30,920 --> 02:26:34,860
Today may be the last day of your journey at BOYS II PLANET,

2927
02:26:35,160 --> 02:26:38,030
but I believe your music has only just begun.

2928
02:26:38,130 --> 02:26:39,290
Thank you for your hard work.

2929
02:26:39,460 --> 02:26:41,160
- Good job! - Good job!

2930
02:26:41,500 --> 02:26:42,530
Good job!

2931
02:26:42,870 --> 02:26:45,369
The 28 of you who have survived...

2932
02:26:45,370 --> 02:26:48,940
the second class placement match, congratulations.

2933
02:26:49,210 --> 02:26:50,310
Thank you.

2934
02:26:51,540 --> 02:26:52,540
However,

2935
02:26:53,880 --> 02:26:57,910
the survival competition only begins now.

2936
02:26:58,050 --> 02:27:00,096
With the surviving participants of "BOYS II PLANET K,"

2937
02:27:00,120 --> 02:27:03,890
who have beaten the fierce competition,

2938
02:27:03,950 --> 02:27:06,020
you will be competing for your chance to debut.

2939
02:27:07,320 --> 02:27:09,559
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2940
02:27:09,560 --> 02:27:10,930
Don't embarrass PLANET C!

2941
02:27:13,530 --> 02:27:14,859
(2nd Class Placement Match Signal Song Test Final Class)

2942
02:27:14,860 --> 02:27:16,129
(All Star: Chen Bo Wen, He Xin Long, Hong Zhi Han, Nian Bo Heng, )

2943
02:27:16,130 --> 02:27:17,499
(Zhang Jia Hao, Zhou An Xin)

2944
02:27:17,500 --> 02:27:19,339
(Two Star: Bian Shi Yu, Dang Hong Hai, Jiang Fan, Li Zi Hao, Sen, )

2945
02:27:19,340 --> 02:27:21,399
(Sun Heng Yu, Taiga, Xue Su Ren, Zhang Shun Yu)

2946
02:27:21,400 --> 02:27:22,739
(One Star: Chen Kai Wen, Chrisen Yang, Dong Jing Kun, Fan Zhe Yi, )

2947
02:27:22,740 --> 02:27:24,009
(Guo Zhen, He Zhong Xing, Hong Zhi Hao, Hu Han Wen, Ko Ming Chieh, )

2948
02:27:24,010 --> 02:27:25,509
(Peng Jin Yu, Sun Jia Yang, Yi Chen, Zhao Guang Xu)

2949
02:27:25,510 --> 02:27:26,679
(No Star: Cai Jin Xin, Chen Jin Xin, Chen Li Chi, Chen Zi Shuo, )

2950
02:27:26,680 --> 02:27:27,909
(Dong Zi Qi, Han Rui Ze, He Jun Jin, Huang Hsin Yu, Jia Han Yu, )

2951
02:27:27,910 --> 02:27:29,479
(Krystian, Lim Jack, Lin Ching En, Long Guo Hao, Ngan Chau Yuet)

2952
02:27:29,480 --> 02:27:30,879
(Wang Dong Yi, Wang Sheng Lin, Wang Zhong Zhi, Weng Wei Dong, )

2953
02:27:30,880 --> 02:27:32,279
(Wong Sik Hei, Xie Bing Hua, Xie Jia Hui, Xie Yu Xin, Xuan Hao, )

2954
02:27:32,280 --> 02:27:33,826
(Yang Jia Peng, Yuan Wei, Zhang Shi Yi, Zhang Yi Hua, Zhang Yu Xi)

2955
02:27:33,850 --> 02:27:35,379
(The time to say goodbye has come after the Final Class Announcement.)

2956
02:27:35,380 --> 02:27:36,719
Good job, everyone!

2957
02:27:36,720 --> 02:27:39,520
(The time to say goodbye has come after the Final Class Announcement.)

2958
02:27:39,660 --> 02:27:45,390
(The participants cry tears of sadness.)

2959
02:27:45,630 --> 02:27:46,860
I'm leaving now.

2960
02:27:47,260 --> 02:27:50,900
No.

2961
02:27:52,270 --> 02:27:54,439
Let's keep in touch.

2962
02:27:54,440 --> 02:27:58,140
I think I became a family with many people here.

2963
02:27:58,940 --> 02:28:00,079
I'll vote for you.

2964
02:28:00,080 --> 02:28:01,840
Really? Spread the word for me.

2965
02:28:02,350 --> 02:28:04,810
As I run on the road to my dream,

2966
02:28:07,320 --> 02:28:08,920
I don't feel like I'm alone anymore.

2967
02:28:09,350 --> 02:28:11,190
- Just one kiss. - No.

2968
02:28:11,590 --> 02:28:13,820
- Then, no kiss. I'll just hug you. - Okay.

2969
02:28:13,920 --> 02:28:15,060
I'm lying.

2970
02:28:17,330 --> 02:28:20,400
(What does BOYS II PLANET C mean to me?)

2971
02:28:20,830 --> 02:28:23,830
I think it lets me dream.

2972
02:28:24,970 --> 02:28:27,970
When the fireworks and confetti were flying through the air...

2973
02:28:28,200 --> 02:28:30,810
during the signal song performance,

2974
02:28:31,170 --> 02:28:33,280
I really felt as though I was dreaming.

2975
02:28:34,080 --> 02:28:36,710
BOYS II PLANET C has made me grow a lot more.

2976
02:28:39,180 --> 02:28:41,550
You're too tall. I have to get on my tiptoes to hug you.

2977
02:28:42,950 --> 02:28:44,289
- I'll find my strength. - Yes, you can do this.

2978
02:28:44,290 --> 02:28:46,720
(For your sake as well)

2979
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:52,029
(We're competitors...)

2980
02:28:52,030 --> 02:28:55,699
(We're competitors...)

2981
02:28:55,700 --> 02:28:58,830
(but also companions.)

2982
02:28:59,400 --> 02:29:01,539
(Also, )

2983
02:29:01,540 --> 02:29:04,340
(we are each others' teachers.)

2984
02:29:04,740 --> 02:29:07,580
One day in the future, I will take the time to remember these memories.

2985
02:29:14,020 --> 02:29:16,420
I don't think this is the end, though.

2986
02:29:16,990 --> 02:29:21,090
I won't give up on my dreams just like this.

2987
02:29:21,520 --> 02:29:23,860
This is the real beginning now.

2988
02:29:24,730 --> 02:29:26,659
I will return before the Star Creators...

2989
02:29:26,660 --> 02:29:28,460
with much more to show you.

2990
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:31,480
The rainbow will rise after the rain.

2991
02:29:34,500 --> 02:29:35,709
BOYS PLANET!

2992
02:29:35,710 --> 02:29:38,710
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2993
02:29:39,110 --> 02:29:43,710
(To be continued)

2994
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:47,320
The boys of BOYS II PLANET C...

2995
02:29:47,780 --> 02:29:50,089
who have survived the Class Placement Match...

2996
02:29:50,090 --> 02:29:52,459
and continue their journey in BOYS II PLANET...

2997
02:29:52,460 --> 02:29:54,490
have been decided.

2998
02:29:55,520 --> 02:29:56,760
Now, these boys...

2999
02:29:56,890 --> 02:29:59,400
will officially compete with the survivors...

3000
02:29:59,660 --> 02:30:02,130
of BOYS II PLANET K starting next week,

3001
02:30:02,370 --> 02:30:04,100
on a single planet called BOYS II PLANET,

3002
02:30:04,330 --> 02:30:07,540
to debut.

3003
02:30:09,370 --> 02:30:11,969
And the second global voting to determine...

3004
02:30:11,970 --> 02:30:14,939

3006
02:30:17,150 --> 02:30:20,850
This is how you can vote.

3007
02:30:21,450 --> 02:30:22,549
(BOYS II PLANET's 2nd global voting opens on July 26 at 12am.)

3008
02:30:22,550 --> 02:30:25,320
For the second global voting,

3009
02:30:25,420 --> 02:30:27,889
on Mnet Plus, the official platform,

3010
02:30:27,890 --> 02:30:30,090
you may vote once a day.

3011
02:30:31,190 --> 02:30:33,460
On BOYS II PLANET webpage,

3012
02:30:34,830 --> 02:30:36,270

3013
02:30:37,130 --> 02:30:39,640
Select a total of eight participants.

3014
02:30:40,570 --> 02:30:43,740
Once you click "Submit Vote" at the bottom,

3015
02:30:43,770 --> 02:30:45,440
you'll receive a voting certificate...

3016
02:30:45,570 --> 02:30:47,210
to confirm that you've voted.

3017
02:30:47,780 --> 02:30:50,380
Fifty percent of the voting result will reflect votes from Korea,

3018
02:30:50,580 --> 02:30:54,150
and the other 50 from the rest of the world.

3019
02:30:54,350 --> 02:30:55,849
The accumulated number of votes...

3020
02:30:55,850 --> 02:30:58,190
will be converted into scores.

3021
02:30:58,490 --> 02:31:01,519
The second global voting...

3022
02:31:01,520 --> 02:31:03,559
on BOYS II PLANET will end...

3023
02:31:03,560 --> 02:31:06,200
on Friday, August 8, 2025, at 10am.

3024
02:31:07,100 --> 02:31:09,060
Star Creators around the world.

3025
02:31:09,130 --> 02:31:12,500
Vote for the boys who will set your heart on fire.

3026
02:31:13,400 --> 02:31:15,176
(The participants are gathered in the hall after the announcement.)

3027
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:16,610
Too many people were eliminated.

3028
02:31:17,040 --> 02:31:18,916
All of the One Star participants were eliminated.

3029
02:31:18,940 --> 02:31:20,810
(Right then!)

3030
02:31:21,280 --> 02:31:23,210
(Someone opens the door and walks in.)

3031
02:31:25,110 --> 02:31:27,020
- Hello. - What?

3032
02:31:27,150 --> 02:31:29,120
(They all bow.)

3033
02:31:29,990 --> 02:31:31,620
- Hello. - What?

3034
02:31:32,420 --> 02:31:33,489
Hello.

3035
02:31:33,490 --> 02:31:34,596
(Chief Master Kim Jae Joong pays them a surprise visit.)

3036
02:31:34,620 --> 02:31:36,090
(Happy to see him)

3037
02:31:36,160 --> 02:31:37,229
Have you been doing well?

3038
02:31:37,230 --> 02:31:38,430
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

3039
02:31:39,200 --> 02:31:41,530
I was so surprised and happy.

3040
02:31:42,770 --> 02:31:46,270
I thought, "He should be in Vietnam."

3041
02:31:46,840 --> 02:31:50,609
As soon as I got back to Korea, I came to meet you guys.

3042
02:31:50,610 --> 02:31:52,979
I came straight here after getting off the plane.

3043
02:31:52,980 --> 02:31:54,656
(Master Kim Jae Joong came running to see the participants.)

3044
02:31:54,680 --> 02:31:56,549
(So touched)

3045
02:31:56,550 --> 02:31:57,780
Thank you.

3046
02:32:05,150 --> 02:32:08,020
(They feel like a part of their hearts are empty.)

3047
02:32:10,030 --> 02:32:12,160
I don't see a lot of people.

3048
02:32:12,900 --> 02:32:15,329
(The participants used to fill the large hall.)

3049
02:32:15,330 --> 02:32:17,470
(But now, there are only 28 participants left.)

3050
02:32:18,600 --> 02:32:19,700
It's a shame.

3051
02:32:23,510 --> 02:32:26,639
Still, although I feel bad for those who have left,

3052
02:32:26,640 --> 02:32:28,340
I hope you survive until the end...

3053
02:32:28,610 --> 02:32:31,080
and do your best to become a member...

3054
02:32:31,280 --> 02:32:33,480
of the group that gets to debut.

3055
02:32:33,780 --> 02:32:35,320
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

3056
02:32:36,090 --> 02:32:37,190
Honestly,

3057
02:32:38,420 --> 02:32:39,960
more than half of us were eliminated.

3058
02:32:41,620 --> 02:32:43,860
(More participants were eliminated than they expected.)

3059
02:32:43,930 --> 02:32:45,190
I promised myself.

3060
02:32:45,860 --> 02:32:47,900
I will really show everyone for my own sake...

3061
02:32:48,160 --> 02:32:50,000
and for the sake of those who were eliminated.

3062
02:32:51,770 --> 02:32:54,240
I will work as hard as I can.

3063
02:32:55,500 --> 02:32:58,110
I will show people the best performance...

3064
02:32:59,240 --> 02:33:01,810
and go to the finals.

3065
02:33:03,010 --> 02:33:04,779
I can do it. Goals should always be set high.

3066
02:33:04,780 --> 02:33:06,049
I will become number one.

3067
02:33:06,050 --> 02:33:07,780
(I will become number 1.)

3068
02:33:08,320 --> 02:33:09,790
I will work harder...

3069
02:33:10,920 --> 02:33:12,600
so that I can show people who I really am.

3070
02:33:14,320 --> 02:33:17,260
For my family and fans,

3071
02:33:17,590 --> 02:33:18,890
I will make it, no matter what.

3072
02:33:20,200 --> 02:33:22,360
I will keep working hard from now on,

3073
02:33:22,700 --> 02:33:25,230
and I won't let everyone down.

3074
02:33:25,870 --> 02:33:26,939
Let's go!

3075
02:33:26,940 --> 02:33:28,440
- Let's go. - Let's go.

3076
02:33:28,800 --> 02:33:32,170
Let's do our best until the end.

3077
02:33:32,440 --> 02:33:33,540
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

3078
02:33:35,510 --> 02:33:37,979
- You can do it! - We can do it!

3079
02:33:37,980 --> 02:33:39,050
Let's go!

3080
02:33:40,050 --> 02:33:42,450
I will make my dream come true, no matter what.

3081
02:33:44,720 --> 02:33:48,660
(We cheer for the future of all participants of BOYS II PLANET C.)
