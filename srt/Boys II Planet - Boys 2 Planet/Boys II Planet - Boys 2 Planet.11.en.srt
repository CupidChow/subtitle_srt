1
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,889
(The rankings changed a lot at the Second Survivor Announcement.)

2
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,889
(All rankings, including the top 8)

3
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:21,989
(10th, Chuei Li Yu, 4,764,725 points)

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,630
(9th, Masato, 5,117,459 points)

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,199
(Kim Geon Woo became the new addition to the top 8.)

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,430
("Better chair!")

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,270
(Kim Geon Woo and He Xin Long were the new additions to the top 8.)

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,970
(I can't believe I'm so close to reaching the 8th place.)

9
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,039
(We'll be able to reach it if we stretch out our hands.)

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,440
(Let's move up to the top 8.)

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,179
(3rd, Lee Leo)

12
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,209
(You know that I'm good, right?)

13
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,249
(12th, Jun Lee Jeong)

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,510
(The competition was very fierce.)

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,819
(4th, He Xin Long versus 11th, Kim Jun Min)

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,520
(I came this far, so I must get the killing part.)

17
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,590
(I'll show everyone that I'll survive until the end.)

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,920
(He's really good.)

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,320
(He's on another level.)

20
00:00:53,321 --> 00:00:54,560
(Sang Won must be upset.)

21
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,529
(1st place, Lee Sang Won versus 19th place, Zhang Jia Hao)

22
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,530
(I was so surprised.)

23
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:02,829
(You shouldn't do that.)

24
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:03,870
(15th place, Sun Heng Yu versus...)

25
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,569
(What are you trying to say?)

26
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,640
All right.

27
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,439
(What are you trying to say to me?)

28
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,440
(1 of the top 8 participants: You shouldn't do that.)

29
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,579
(Everyone is desperate.)

30
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,609
(I want to do well...)

31
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,620
(and move up.)

32
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,650
(Finally, the semi-finals begin.)

33
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,219
(4 teams with 4 characters)

34
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,220
(Performances of various concepts grab the eyes.)

35
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,660
(He was born to do the killing part.)

36
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:52,950
(Episode 9, Max the Power)

37
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,860
(After the Survivor Announcement, 4 teams gather around again.)

38
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,730
(Practice room for Team "Lucky MACHO")

39
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,930
A lot of members are gone.

40
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,629
We used to practice as a group of 12 members.

41
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,630
I know.

42
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:11,600
The practice room looks big.

43
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,839
(The empty practice room makes them feel the void even more.)

44
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,779
In any case, we need to bring members...

45
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,580
- from another team. - That's right.

46
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,820
(Team "Lucky MACHO" needs 6 members.)

47
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,750
We need one more member.

48
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,019
Team "Chains" has so many members.

49
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,990
- That team has 11 members, right? - Yes.

50
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,060
I see.

51
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,560
(Team "Chains" members still fill up the practice room.)

52
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,030
- Eleven of us survived. - I know.

53
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,130
Shall we have a round of applause first?

54
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,500
Many members survived.

55
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,500
I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing.

56
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,170
Most of the members will go to Team "MAIN DISH."

57
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,710
I'm so scared.

58
00:02:51,711 --> 00:02:54,110
I don't want to go to Team "MAIN DISH."

59
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,020
I told myself that I'd try hard to defend my place.

60
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,489
(Everyone is deep in thought.)

61
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,619
It's hard to be on a survival show.

62
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,820
(What will become of Team "Chains?")

63
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,889
(Just like Team "Chains,")

64
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,029
(Team "MAIN DISH" had a lot of members.)

65
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,430
(Only Li Zi Hao's sigh remains in Team "MAIN DISH.")

66
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,569
What should I do?

67
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,969
(Talking loudly)

68
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,940
(He hears people talk loudly in the neighboring practice room.)

69
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,170
I'm jealous that there are a lot of members.

70
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,370
I'm the only one in the team.

71
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,840
There's one member.

72
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,480
There's no time.

73
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,950
There are no teammates.

74
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,950
There's nothing.

75
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,220
There are songs other participants want.

76
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,429
I don't think many participants will go,

77
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,090
"I want to perform 'MAIN DISH.'"

78
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:49,570
(Meanwhile, Team "Sugar HIGH" needs to let go of 1 member.)

79
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,909
Is there anyone in here...

80
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,510
who wants to go to another team?

81
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,350
What are we going to do?

82
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,119
What are we going to do?

83
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,090
(Who will be let go from Team "Sugar HIGH?")

84
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,850
Team "Sugar HIGH" and Team "Chains," please gather around.

85
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,660
(Team "Sugar HIGH" and Team "Chains" gather around in the practice room.)

86
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,829
I was most curious about how the teams...

87
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,130
would be restructured.

88
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,499
(At that moment, Team "MAIN DISH" and Team "Lucky MACHO" enter.)

89
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,939
Li Zi Hao!

90
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,669
(At that moment, Team "MAIN DISH" and Team "Lucky MACHO" enter.)

91
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,710
Xin Long!

92
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,440
Let's go!

93
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,980
Is Li Zi Hao the only one?

94
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,580
I know. There's only one member.

95
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,950
Team "Lucky MACHO" needs one more member.

96
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,820
We'll begin restructuring the teams.

97
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,949
(The methods of team restructuring)

98
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,649
(1. Team "MAIN DISH" and Team "Lucky MACHO...")

99
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,349
(will urge other participants to join the teams.)

100
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,289
(2. Participants from Team "Sugar HIGH" and...)

101
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,089
(Team "Chains" who want to move to a new team will apply.)

102
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,589
(3. The team members will be picked...)

103
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,860
(to fill up 6 spots.)

104
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,100
Firstly, our team...

105
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,829
has developed the performance a lot...

106
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,800
in terms of the choreography and structure.

107
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,840
"Lucky MACHO" weighs on my mind.

108
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,469
From the moment I listened to it,

109
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,280
I thought it was a nice song.

110
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,950
(Revealing the mission songs)

111
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,250
I like the beat.

112
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,120
(Exclaiming)

113
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,850
Does anyone want to perform "Lucky MACHO?"

114
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,120
(Lee Leo liked "Lucky MACHO.")

115
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,490
May I check out the video of the choreography?

116
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,660
(Lee Leo wants to check the choreography video.)

117
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,929
Why don't the participants...

118
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,830
who want to apply for the team watch it together?

119
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,469
Gather around.

120
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,369
(The participants who want to join Team "Lucky MACHO" gather around.)

121
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,540
Let's watch it first.

122
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,740
There are a lot.

123
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,470
That's good.

124
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,009
(Many participants show interest.)

125
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,540
Let's watch it first.

126
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,340
- All right. - What is it?

127
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,880
(Li Zi Hao hears the news and walks over.)

128
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,620
You can't watch it.

129
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
(Can't I watch it?)

130
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,389
Your team will be dissolved without you. You can't switch teams.

131
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,790
(Feeling said, Li Zi Hao goes back.)

132
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,419
(Lee Leo focuses on...)

133
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,260
(the choreography video.)

134
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,130
- Leo must be thinking about it. - What?

135
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,259
I think Leo is thinking about switching teams.

136
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,530
I really hope he joins us.

137
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,200
Then we'll be able to rip up the stage.

138
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm very conflicted.

139
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,769
You'll pick "Lucky MACHO," right?

140
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:09,770
I'm not sure yet.

141
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,209
I wanted to say, "You should stay,"

142
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,709
but I didn't.

143
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,810
Leo is the type of guy to go if he wants to, even if I say that.

144
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,180
I didn't want to affect his decision.

145
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,919
- I want to pick "Lucky MACHO." - "Lucky MACHO?"

146
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,920
(Yun Seo is interested in "Lucky MACHO.")

147
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,130
It's so good.

148
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,160
It's the type of vibe that I pursue.

149
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,000
I wanted to give a cool performance.

150
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,830
If you want to switch to "Lucky MACHO,"

151
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,040
you can stand in front of them.

152
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,680
- Five, four, three, - You're really going?

153
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,810
- two, one. - I'll give it a try.

154
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,019
(Yun Seo, Ching Yu, and Jun Il)

155
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,620
(3 participants applied.)

156
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,849
On Team "Lucky MACHO,"

157
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,760
there was Yumeki, who was my favorite.

158
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,790
Two of our teammates went.

159
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,300
We couldn't lose either of them.

160
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,329
The only members who knew...

161
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,399
how to learn the dance moves fast...

162
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,429
were Yun Seo and Ching Yu.

163
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,640
(Yun Seo and Ching Yu were in charge of the choreography.)

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,310
I don't want any of them to leave.

165
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,309
(Meanwhile, Leo is still deciding.)

166
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,280
Let's give Leo 30 seconds.

167
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,609
Wait.

168
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,880
Give me a second!

169
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,080
Five, four, three,

170
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,150
- two, one. - Seriously?

171
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,160
(There are 4 applicants now.)

172
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,190
(Who's the final applicant to Team "Lucky MACHO?")

173
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,400
(Yun Seo, Ching Yu, Jun Il, and...)

174
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,770
(Chen Kai Wen is the last applicant to Team "Lucky MACHO.")

175
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,070
I was surprised.

176
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:46,700
I thought he would want to perform "Chains."

177
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,209
(After checking the choreography of "Lucky MACHO")

178
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,280
I like "Lucky MACHO" too.

179
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,840
Do you think I'll be kicked out?

180
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,510
I think anyone can be kicked out.

181
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,750
I don't like being embarrassed, so I'd rather leave on my own.

182
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:03,350
(He thought he'd be kicked out of Team "Chains.")

183
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,559
(Meanwhile, Leo ended up staying.)

184
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,160
I was dying to perform that song,

185
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,959
but I was worried...

186
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,629
that I'd fall behind...

187
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,500
as we didn't have much time left.

188
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,170
Then...

189
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,139
- First... - First...

190
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,740
I badly want this song.

191
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,670
(It's finally time to pick a member.)

192
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,440
(Jun Min walks toward Yun Seo.)

193
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:31,680
(Who will Team "Lucky MACHO" pick?)

194
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,890
(Jun Il joins Team "Lucky MACHO.")

195
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,270
We picked Jun Il after much deliberation.

196
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,229
In the last mission,

197
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,470
I liked how he performed.

198
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,810
I put faith in him.

199
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,280
- Let's go. - I'll do my best.

200
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,349
(Team "Lucky MACHO")

201
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,779
(Kim Jun Min, Park Dong Gyu, Park Jun Il, )

202
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,250
(Yumeki, He Xin Long, and Hu Han Wen)

203
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,020
(It's time for Team "MAIN DISH" to scout a member.)

204
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,320
Solo!

205
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,659
I know that none of you wants...

206
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,960
to come to Team "MAIN DISH."

207
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:19,000
But we don't have a choice. Some of you have to come.

208
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,469
We certainly don't have a choice.

209
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,769
- That's true. - That's true.

210
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,770
He's right.

211
00:09:24,771 --> 00:09:27,140
If you want the killing part,

212
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,040
you can come and take it.

213
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,419
- I like that! - Every line he says is impressive.

214
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,820
Is there a member you want?

215
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,390
I want the members of Team "Chains."

216
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,059
- Team "Chains." - Team "Chains."

217
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,519
Which one of us especially?

218
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,290
You should come.

219
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,000
There's a team that wants me! That feels good.

220
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
Sorry.

221
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,169
I feel bad for Hao,

222
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,930
but I don't have other songs in mind.

223
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,940
I'll play it.

224
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,670
(What are you talking about?)

225
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,069
That's the killing part, right?

226
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,410
Yes, the killing part.

227
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,039
(The introduction is the killing part...)

228
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,549
(that starts the song off strongly.)

229
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,849
What are you talking about?

230
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,309
What are you talking about?

231
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,580
What are you talking about?

232
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,720
It's pretty cool.

233
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,260
Whose part is this?

234
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,960
The main rapper.

235
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,300
The main rapper is...

236
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,769
It's a song...

237
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:32,469
in which rappers stand out more than the vocalists,

238
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,610
so I didn't exactly have a place there.

239
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,980
They're all great dancers.

240
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,150
That was cool.

241
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,580
It looks tough.

242
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,120
Just watching it drained me.

243
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,360
- I like it, but the dance is too... - Tough?

244
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,789
I watched the "MAIN DISH" performance,

245
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,660
and it was less impressive than "Lucky MACHO."

246
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,899
The genre was punk and rock.

247
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,970
It's not a genre that I normally listen to.

248
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,170
Step forward if you want to join this team.

249
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,349
(They only move their hips up and down.)

250
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,410
What's going on?

251
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,120
(Who made Zi Hao smile?)

252
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,990
(Heng Yu and Kai Wen step forward.)

253
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,790
I like this part.

254
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,660
I love this part.

255
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,270
(Kai Wen was impressed the whole time he watched.)

256
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,370
(What about Heng Yu?)

257
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,040
I like songs that are more intense.

258
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,810
I'm already leaning toward "MAIN DISH."

259
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,679
(They got 2 out of 5 members.)

260
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,180
Ten, nine,

261
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,550
- One of us has to go. - eight,

262
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,419
- We don't have a choice. - seven...

263
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,749
(Team "Sugar HIGH" must release a member.)

264
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,520
- Six, - No one's coming.

265
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,720
- five, four, - Someone has to.

266
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,330
Three, two, one,

267
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,230
zero.

268
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,530
They're short of three members.

269
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,769
(Heng Yu and Kai Wen join Team "MAIN DISH.")

270
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,569
The two have joined Team "MAIN DISH."

271
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,570
(Team "MAIN DISH")

272
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:13,899
(Li Zi Hao, Sun Heng Yu, and Chen Kai Wen)

273
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,409
(They need 3 more members.)

274
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,810
Team "Sugar HIGH" and Team "Chains..."

275
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,079
will have to pick...

276
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,380
Two of them and one of us have to go.

277
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,950
I'm staying.

278
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,219
I think I'll pick a member...

279
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,990
whom I think isn't suited for this song...

280
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:36,290
or who's leaning toward other songs.

281
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,700
Okay.

282
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,530
- Okay. - Let's go.

283
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,670
I thought I'd be kicked out.

284
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,840
"Who would want me?"

285
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,609
I was afraid.

286
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,069
I'm confident I can pull off this song,

287
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,179
and I want to give a good performance.

288
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,639
I never want to be released.

289
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,480
I can't predict what will happen at all.

290
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,119
(1 hour later)

291
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,049
(In front of the practice room for Team "Chains")

292
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,990
What on earth is this show?

293
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,290
- Do we have a tissue? - That's fine.

294
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:15,330
(How did the reformation go for Team "Chains?")

295
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,840
(Back to 1 hour ago)

296
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,869
What do we do?

297
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,509
(How will the two teams choose whom to release?)

298
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:25,109
If you fail to be assigned to a part...

299
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,280
during the reassignment, you will be released.

300
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,380
I'm doomed.

301
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,950
It's fair, though.

302
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,660
Let's pick the main vocalist first.

303
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,159
Woo Jin and I were the main vocalists.

304
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,360
Woo Jin, what do you think about this?

305
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,759
I want to try out for the first sub-vocalist position.

306
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,629
I see. Then, I'll be the main vocalist.

307
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,600
Woo Jin will be the first sub-vocalist.

308
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,669
And Sang Hyeon will be the main rapper.

309
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:58,040
Masato will be the sub-rapper and sing the killing part.

310
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:02,579
Now, the 2nd and 3rd sub-vocalists.

311
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,709
These two remain.

312
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,179
Why don't you sing this part first?

313
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,150
Then, we'll take a vote or have a discussion.

314
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,990
(Li Yu goes first.)

315
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,830
(Ching Yu goes next.)

316
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,830
(Yun Seo goes last.)

317
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,910
I honestly think we should give him the part.

318
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,110
That's obvious.

319
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,879
But the problem is who should take this part?

320
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,410
Is it Ching Yu or Yun Seo?

321
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,720
I think we'll choose between the two youngest members.

322
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,619
Performance-wise, Ching Yu is better.

323
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,089
But that doesn't mean that Yun Seo is a bad dancer.

324
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,190
That's also true.

325
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,930
We've discussed it,

326
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,870
and Li Yu will be the second sub-vocalist.

327
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:55,970
What?

328
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,670
And the third sub-vocalist...

329
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,769
(The 3rd sub-vocalist's part lasts 11 seconds.)

330
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,640
I'm happy with short parts too.

331
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,240
I badly want to sing "Sugar HIGH."

332
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,109
And the third sub-vocalist...

333
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,050
(Who will be released from Team "Sugar HIGH?")

334
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,950
(Meanwhile, Team "MAIN DISH" awaits new members.)

335
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,420
Who will it be?

336
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,490
Just come.

337
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,590
(Someone enters the practice room.)

338
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,329
We have a dancer!

339
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,469
- Welcome. - Hi.

340
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,470
(Ching Yu joins Team "MAIN DISH.")

341
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,140
(During the reassignment earlier)

342
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,009
We've decided on Yun Seo.

343
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,610
(Ching Yu will be released.)

344
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,980
It's fine.

345
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,480
I almost teared up, but I held it.

346
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,120
I didn't want them to feel bad.

347
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,290
So, I didn't cry.

348
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,290
Yun Seo.

349
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,100
I hope you do a good job as the performance leader.

350
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,070
I mean it.

351
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,399
(Debut Concept Battle: Kang Woo Jin, Na Yun Seo, Masato, )

352
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,500
(Jang Han Eum, Chung Sang Hyeon, and Chuei Li Yu)

353
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,210
Trust me.

354
00:16:10,211 --> 00:16:11,709
We'll be able to put on a great performance together.

355
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,140
- I'll work harder. - Okay?

356
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,779
He's a great dancer.

357
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,679
We've got someone who can help us with the dance.

358
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,680
I'm so happy.

359
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,050
Who do you think will join us from the other team?

360
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,980
Jia Hao?

361
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,420
Jia Hao?

362
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:25,059
(Team "Chains" has begun redividing up the song...)

363
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,660
(as they need to send out 2 of their teammates.)

364
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,459
It won't be possible for me...

365
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,890
to take it personally if I have to leave.

366
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,060
If I get pushed out,

367
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,170
I'll be quite disappointed.

368
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,940
(Which 2 participants will be kicked out of the team?)

369
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,540
I really want to remain on the team.

370
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:44,210
I think I can manage to stay on the team.

371
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,610
I'm confident.

372
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,140
Raise your hands if you want to be the main vocalist.

373
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,279
(Yoo Kang Min and Lee Leo apply for the main vocalist position.)

374
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,580
Let's hear it.

375
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:57,250
(Candidate 1 for the main vocalist: Lee Leo)

376
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,600
You know that I'm usually good.

377
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,500
I'm usually good.

378
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,540
(Candidate 2 for the main vocalist: Yoo Kang Min)

379
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,770
I can't do it.

380
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,610
Can't I try it one more time?

381
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,980
Okay. This is the last time.

382
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,880
I'm sorry. Could I try it one last time, please?

383
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,550
I think I can do it.

384
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:34,060
(Yoo Kang Min sings the main vocalist's part again.)

385
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,259
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

386
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,760
Okay. Nice try.

387
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,060
Nice try.

388
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,960
I can't sing it powerfully.

389
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,270
Raise your hands if you want Kang Min to take this position.

390
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,380
Leo will take the position.

391
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,779
Thank you.

392
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,940
(Main Vocalist of Team "Chains," Lee Leo)

393
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,479
- Come on. - Leo...

394
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,350
became an official member of Team "Chains."

395
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,190
Leo took the main vocalist position.

396
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,919
His voice suited the song very well.

397
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,090
So I'll go after the first sub-vocalist position.

398
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,460
(Splitting up the song before the Survivor Announcement)

399
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,160
(Yoo Kang Min applied for the 1st sub-vocalist position.)

400
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,930
(He showed stable singing skills.)

401
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,540
(Yoo Kang Min took the 1st sub-vocalist position.)

402
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,680
Does anyone want to try out for the first sub-vocalist position?

403
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,709
(A total of 4 people apply for the position.)

404
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,180
Hold on. One, two, three... Four people.

405
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,820
A lot of us on the team are vocalists. So naturally,

406
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,890
the competition was quite fierce.

407
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,430
(Candidate 1: Kim Geon Woo)

408
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,230
(Candidate 2: Jun Lee Jeong)

409
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,160
(Candidate 3: Zhou An Xin)

410
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,200
(Candidate 4: Yoo Kang Min)

411
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,010
Okay.

412
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,050
Gosh, this is hard.

413
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,420
Raise your hands if you want Kang Min to take the position.

414
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,819
(Kang Min didn't get a single vote once again.)

415
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,730
Raise your hands if you want An Xin to take the position.

416
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,129
(Zhou An Xin receives a total of 3 votes.)

417
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,999
- It's An Xin. - Thank you.

418
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
(1st Sub-Vocalist of Team "Chains," Zhou An Xin)

419
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,770
Everyone did well.

420
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,500
We still have a lot of positions left.

421
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,970
(However, as they continue to assign the positions...)

422
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,340
Okay. I'm good.

423
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,780
Nice try.

424
00:19:35,781 --> 00:19:38,020
- All right. - Next up is Jia Hao.

425
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,550
I didn't know what to do there either.

426
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,089
Objectively speaking,

427
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,060
it was the right decision not to vote for him.

428
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,990
But personally, I felt bad to Kang Min.

429
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,769
We only have one position left.

430
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:57,830
(In no time, there's only one sub-rapper position left.)

431
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,799
Who wants to try out for the sub-rapper position?

432
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,870
(This is the last position before the release.)

433
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,940
(Zhang Jia Hao goes for it right away.)

434
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,010
(But...)

435
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,750
(Kang Min doesn't try out for the position.)

436
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,720
- Is it just Kang Min now? - Yes.

437
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,390
Why don't you try it out, though? You should still try.

438
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,590
I don't think there's a position for me...

439
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,390
on this team.

440
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,170
I'll join the other team and try to find a better position.

441
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,310
Are you sure about this?

442
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,080
I'm fine.

443
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,950
Actually, I avoided looking his way.

444
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,020
Honestly, it felt like I had to walk on eggshells around him.

445
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,960
I thought he might punch me if I approached him.

446
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,560
I suddenly felt this dark aura from him.

447
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:05,239
(After they finish reassigning the positions, )

448
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,640
(Kang Min leaves the practice room quietly.)

449
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,310
(He paces around the hallway and spends some alone time.)

450
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,620
I had a lot on my mind then.

451
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,159
When they were reassigning the positions,

452
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,229
I felt that they didn't need me.

453
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,360
That realization hit me hard.

454
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,400
It was quite unsettling.

455
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,239
- Who is it? - He's here.

456
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,010
(Practice room for Team "MAIN DISH")

457
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:47,009
(Kang Min enters their practice room.)

458
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,650
- Yoo Kang Min! - Yes!

459
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,150
- Yoo Kang Min! - Kang Min!

460
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,159
I had never imagined that Kang Min would join us.

461
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,220
It was so wild.

462
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,390
What could they be thinking, giving us the lucky charm?

463
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,159
Honestly, I wanted to work with Kang Min.

464
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,260
- Yoo Kang Min! - Yoo Kang Min!

465
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,629
- Yoo Kang Min! - Yoo Kang Min!

466
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,730
(Team "MAIN DISH" gives him the biggest welcome ever.)

467
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,300
- You don't look so happy. - No.

468
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,769
- Are you okay? - We must crush them.

469
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,709
- We ought to crush them. - Seriously. We...

470
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,410
I'm going to beat them. I'll bring our team to victory.

471
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,810
Team "MAIN DISH" welcomed me wholeheartedly. I was grateful.

472
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:25,179
We've got a great rapper, a great singer,

473
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,550
a great dancer,

474
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,789
and an ace. You're an all-round performer.

475
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,649
I'm the good-looking one here.

476
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,419
We're the good-looking ones on the team. Right?

477
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,559
- Okay. - Let's go.

478
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,359
I'm so happy that we're on the same team.

479
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,299
Who will be the last to join us? Who will it be?

480
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,400
Hurry up.

481
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
There he is.

482
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,870
Who is it?

483
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,110
(The identity of the last member makes them shout for joy.)

484
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,440
I was surprised.

485
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,940
It was beyond my imagination.

486
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,440
Who would have thought someone from the Top Eight would join us?

487
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,549
(Kim Jun Seo joins Team "MAIN DISH.")

488
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,620
Jun Seo is joining us.

489
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,480
- Hey, you. - Jun Seo is here.

490
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:02,520
- What? - What?

491
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,620
(When Kang Min gave up trying out for the sub-rapper position...)

492
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:11,389
I feel the same way. Rap isn't my main talent.

493
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,400
It's only right to leave the team if there isn't a position for me.

494
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,130
I'll be all right.

495
00:23:17,131 --> 00:23:18,140
(Kim Jun Seo gave up on the last sub-rapper position.)

496
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,269
(Debut Concept Battle: Kim Geon Woo, Lee Leo, Lee Sang Won, )

497
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,210
(Zhang Jia Hao, Jun Lee Jeong, and Zhou An Xin)

498
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,310
(Debut Concept: Kim Jun Seo, Li Zi Hao, Sun Heng Yu, )

499
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,309
(Hsu Ching Yu, Yoo Kang Min, and Chen Kai Wen)

500
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,180
- Let's do our best. - Let's do our best.

501
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,550
Okay.

502
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,549
The look on your face... You seem so angry.

503
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,790
No, I'm good.

504
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:43,229
(Practice room for Team "Lucky MACHO")

505
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,329
- Welcome. - Welcome.

506
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,500
Thank you for picking me.

507
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,870
Gosh, no. Thank you for joining us.

508
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,300
Let's pick the leader now.

509
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,339
Our leader is...

510
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,010
(Previously, Han Harry June was the leader.)

511
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,540
It's Han Harry June.

512
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:04,680
(Unfortunately, he was eliminated in 26th place.)

513
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,520
- Do your best. - Okay. I'll do my best. I promise.

514
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,720
Who wants to be the leader?

515
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,629
(Park Dong Gyu volunteers for the leader position.)

516
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,660
Dong Gyu.

517
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,960
Anyone else?

518
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,269
For the leader position?

519
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,370
(No one volunteers for the leader position.)

520
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,070
For the leader position?

521
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:27,900
Actually,

522
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,470
I wanted to be a leader at least once on the show.

523
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,850
(What will Kim Jun Min decide to do?)

524
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,419
Should we let Dong Gyu be our leader? Shall we?

525
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,489
- Sure. - Okay.

526
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,989
- Thank you. - We'll trust you with this.

527
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,160
He's the leader of our team.

528
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,189
- It's Dong Gyu. - Things are moving fast here.

529
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,260
(New Leader of Team "Lucky MACHO," Park Dong Gyu)

530
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,030
When I saw Dong Gyu volunteering for it,

531
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,929
I knew he would do a good job.

532
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,370
I had faith in him.

533
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,199
(Ever since arriving at the Planet Camp, )

534
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,139
(Kim Jun Min and Park Dong Gyu have been each other's first roommates.)

535
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,510
(They were also roommates when they were on Team "S-Class.")

536
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,280
(Throughout the 4 months of staying at the camp, )

537
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,849
(the two participants have been roommates.)

538
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:13,850
(Actually, when their class dropped to 2 Star...)

539
00:25:13,851 --> 00:25:15,320
(Room 202: Kim Jun Min and Park Dong Gyu)

540
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,619
It reminds me of the time when I met you for the first time.

541
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,720
(Jun Min and Dong Gyu became roommates again.)

542
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:26,360
(They met again as roommates until the semi-finals.)

543
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,030
(Jun Min has been watching Dong Gyu more closely than anyone.)

544
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,670
I think Dong Gyu is mature.

545
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:33,899
I took a step back.

546
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,470
(Jun Min didn't volunteer as he believed in Dong Gyu.)

547
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,370
- Go for it, Dong Gyu. - It's my first time.

548
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,410
- Thank you. It's my first time. - Go for it, Dong Gyu.

549
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,650
Putting a sticker on my chest...

550
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,749
made me feel weird.

551
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,149
(Park Dong Gyu puts on his first special sticker.)

552
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,150
- Okay. - Thank you.

553
00:25:50,151 --> 00:25:53,460
Actually, I volunteered for the position many times.

554
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:58,500
(Park Dong Gyu volunteered to be the leader of Team "S-Class.")

555
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,500
(He hoped to be the leader of Team "Bad.")

556
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:07,740
(Park Dong Gyu yielded the leader position to other members.)

557
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,710
It's my third time being the leader.

558
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,740
I want to be a historic leader.

559
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,610
(Park Dong Gyu had given up the leader position every time.)

560
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,680
It made me feel very good.

561
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:24,720
Who wants the killing part?

562
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,160
Raise your hand.

563
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,259
(4 people volunteer for the killing part...)

564
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,429
(including Kim Jun Min who originally had it.)

565
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,230
- I want it. - Of course.

566
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,200
Why don't we dance the chorus part of the first verse?

567
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:40,340
(The killing part is the chorus with the essential dance section.)

568
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,370
(Killing part candidate 1, Kim Jun Min)

569
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,880
(Killing part candidate 2, He Xin Long)

570
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,859
Okay.

571
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:04,360
(Killing part candidate 3, Yumeki, candidate 4, Park Dong Gyu)

572
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,069
(Park Jun Il and Hu Han Wen didn't volunteer for the killing part.)

573
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,200
(They decide who gets the killing part.)

574
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:13,070
- All four of them are good. - Yes.

575
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,110
Jun Min...

576
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,639
and Xin Long.

577
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,080
(Kim Jun Min, He Xin Long, the final killing part candidates)

578
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:25,380
(Who will get the killing part?)

579
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,720
(At that moment, Hu Han Wen brings out the two.)

580
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,159
- Okay. - Okay.

581
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,759
We'd like to see each of you one more time.

582
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,930
- Could you do it together? - Okay.

583
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,870
Both of you stand out a lot.

584
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,999
If you could dance together...

585
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I understand.

586
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,640
(He Xin Long versus Kim Jun Min)

587
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:07,420
It was Xin Long who had good energy.

588
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:11,860
However, Jun Min's movement...

589
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,230
including his dance lines didn't have much clarity.

590
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,999
It's a matter of personal taste.

591
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,340
I agree with you.

592
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,970
Yes, we made our decision.

593
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,480
When the song was playing,

594
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,280
I didn't hear the lyrics at all.

595
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,010
I thought that it was a different song.

596
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,920
- Here I go. - Okay.

597
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,979
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

598
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,290
(Who will perform the killing part on Team "Lucky MACHO?")

599
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,290
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

600
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,730
(Kim Jun Min)

601
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,700
("Lucky MACHO" killing part, Kim Jun Min)

602
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,230
Yes.

603
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,599
Raise your hand if you think Jun Min did well. One, two, three.

604
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,240
(3 out of 4 picked Kim Jun Min.)

605
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,009
You have to do a good job.

606
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,240
I will.

607
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:02,380
(Their practice starts in full swing under Yumeki's lead.)

608
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,350
We have to move at this moment.

609
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,879
- That's right. - Do we move then?

610
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,550
- Yes. - It's the opposite.

611
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,790
- You know... - Yes?

612
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,419
The part that rhymes?

613
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,630
These words should be more accented.

614
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,699
(Park Dong Gyu teaches him in detail.)

615
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,330
- Loudly like this. - Ha.

616
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,940
(A few minutes later)

617
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,709
It's okay.

618
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:33,010
(Leader Dong Gyu looks after Han Wen who has a hard time singing.)

619
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,850
Practice slowly, okay?

620
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,350
(Watching carefully)

621
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,360
Dong Gyu didn't usually take the lead,

622
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,459
but now he's stepping up more than anyone.

623
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,860
He has changed a lot.

624
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:52,299
There are many participants who supported me...

625
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,900
but had to leave.

626
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,100
Thus, I feel a sense of responsibility.

627
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,940
I also feel very determined to do well.

628
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,469
As the leader, I want to guide this team...

629
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,810
and use our next performance...

630
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,340
to shake up the rankings.

631
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,980
(The practice room for Team "Sugar HIGH")

632
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:16,320
(There's only silence among Team "Sugar HIGH.")

633
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,619
(As a result of the team reorganization, )

634
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,690
(Hsu Ching Yu was eliminated from Team "Sugar HIGH.")

635
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,660
I feel very bad for him.

636
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:26,430
It's quite sad.

637
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:32,099
Unfortunately, Ching Yu had to leave.

638
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,369
For Ching Yu's sake,

639
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:38,640
we should work harder for the performance.

640
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:42,950
Now, I'll only focus on performing well.

641
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,749
Let's work hard together as a team and do our best.

642
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,780
We can do it.

643
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,450
Since I'm not competent in dance choreography,

644
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,860
I'd like Yun Seo to be the performance leader.

645
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,860
That sounds good.

646
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,360
I feel pressured.

647
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,629
I had my peers who led the performance...

648
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,299
with me.

649
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,300
(Na Yun Seo and Hsu Ching Yu led the practice together.)

650
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,470
Now I'm the only performance leader.

651
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,209
Did everyone's part change...

652
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,369
except me and Sato?

653
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,580
We have to revise the dance formation.

654
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,409
Woo Jin, Li Yu,

655
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,649
and Yun Seo's parts changed.

656
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,949
(Now that the parts are reassigned, )

657
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,320
(he has to revise the dance formation by himself.)

658
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,090
Again...

659
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,750
Our performance leader.

660
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,920
Gosh, I don't think this is right.

661
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,029
I feel very pressured.

662
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,830
I should take responsibility.

663
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,630
Woo Jin, you're here.

664
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,499
- Li Yu, you're here. - Yes.

665
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,970
- I should come up to here. - Do I come back out?

666
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,239
Sato, stand here.

667
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,570
In between people.

668
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:46,240
I have to revise the dance formation first.

669
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,880
- Let's do it. - Okay.

670
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:52,180
(The team members practice the new dance formation.)

671
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,380
We're too crowded here.

672
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,420
(Crowded)

673
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:59,459
You should be number 1. Here's number 2.

674
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,789
- Okay. - And...

675
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,330
Sang Hyeon, you can move up more.

676
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,090
And so...

677
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:08,200
(The practice is led by Na Yun Seo.)

678
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,300
The other side.

679
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,970
(The team members are also confused about the dance.)

680
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,370
Everyone is getting it wrong.

681
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,240
By the way, after one...

682
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,010
(They practice again with the music.)

683
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,580
- Move out of my way. - Please.

684
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,950
- Move out of my way. - Please.

685
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,920
- Move out of my way, please. - When should I step aside?

686
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,419
(While everyone is messing up loudly, )

687
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:36,160
(one person is getting it wrong quietly.)

688
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,800
(Masato)

689
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,560
All of you got it wrong.

690
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,440
The guys were too slow at picking up the choreography.

691
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,099
Based on our positions,

692
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,539
many of us have vocal positions.

693
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,610
(Main position: Vocal)

694
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,539
For the choreography, Yun Seo led us a lot.

695
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,510
I'll do my best to keep up.

696
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,509
Can you show me the last part of the choreography?

697
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,220
- What? - Can you show me the choreography?

698
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,520
One, two, three.

699
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,620
- Do you want me to show you? - Yes.

700
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:04,990
I'll show you.

701
00:33:04,991 --> 00:33:07,019
In the beginning of the song...

702
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,129
(He approaches the others to give a private lesson.)

703
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,360
This is your part.

704
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,299
- I have a question for you. - Yes?

705
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,199
What's the movement when we sing "thrilling?"

706
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,769
Do we get together after this part?

707
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,169
How does it go?

708
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,340
You do this over here.

709
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,270
Do we smile in this part?

710
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,140
- Yes. - Okay.

711
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,809
- Yun Seo? - Yun Seo.

712
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,239
- Let's do it, Yun Seo. - Yun Seo.

713
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,879
(In their desperate search for Yun Seo, )

714
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,180
(night settles over Planet Camp.)

715
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,010
Excuse me.

716
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,250
I'm taking a break for three minutes.

717
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,819
- No. - Take a break for five minutes.

718
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,890
I just need some water.

719
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:38,960
This is hard.

720
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:46,300
(Chugging water)

721
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:51,900
Goodness.

722
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,999
We'll do it up to the chorus of the second verse.

723
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,010
Okay.

724
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,469
- At the center... - I'm worried.

725
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,040
We might face a challenge.

726
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,810
After that, we do it together from here.

727
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,779
(Will Performance Leader Na Yun Seo...)

728
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,050
(be able to complete "Sugar HIGH" safely?)

729
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,580
(The practice room for Team "Chains")

730
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,150
(2 members were eliminated from Team "Chains.")

731
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:13,220
The vibe is...

732
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:16,690
Suddenly, I feel a huge sense of guilt.

733
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,999
I know that it's sad,

734
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,570
but the semi-finals are coming up soon.

735
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,400
We should cheer up and do our best.

736
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:30,569
- We can do it. Let's do it. - Okay.

737
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:33,440
(Team "Chains" tries to liven up the mood.)

738
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,209
Last time,

739
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:40,349
An Xin and Jia Hao had the killing part.

740
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:42,080
Now that the members have changed,

741
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,020
we should pick a new member.

742
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,920
Who wants to volunteer for the killing part?

743
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,260
(Zhou An Xin and Zhang Jia Hao volunteer immediately.)

744
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,630
(Just then, all eyes turn in one direction.)

745
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,530
(Lee Sang Won volunteers for the killing part.)

746
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,800
(All members of Team "Chains" seem surprised.)

747
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,200
(What's the reason?)

748
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,639
(Before the 2nd Survivor Announcement)

749
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,210
(Raise your hand if you want to go for the killing part.)

750
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,910
(While assigning the killing part)

751
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,910
(Sang Won didn't volunteer for the killing part.)

752
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,350
What about you, Sang Won?

753
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,320
- Go for it. - What?

754
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,990
I don't feel confident enough.

755
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,020
("LALALALA" by Stray Kids, 1st place)

756
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,429
For our "like JENNIE" performance,

757
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,699
I had the killing part.

758
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,259
If I had done better,

759
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,770
the result could have been better.

760
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,570
I was afraid of the killing part.

761
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,469
I couldn't raise my hand.

762
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:40,980
I gave up on trying from the start.

763
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,510
Who wants to try it?

764
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,179
- Me. - Okay.

765
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:48,580
(Lee Sang Won watched others try for the killing part.)

766
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:50,350
While watching other people,

767
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,320
I wondered why I didn't try it.

768
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:55,390
Is it right to run away because I'm scared?

769
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,229
The Star Creators must have...

770
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,159
given me this song...

771
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,670
because they wanted to see a certain side of me.

772
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,040
I thought that I shouldn't run away...

773
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,910
and that I should show them...

774
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,980
how I challenge myself in any way I can.

775
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,110
- Let's go. - Okay.

776
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,320
I was really worried.

777
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,520
Sang Won and Jia Hao.

778
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,650
To be honest, I'm not really confident.

779
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,690
(Killing part candidate 1, Zhou An Xin)

780
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:45,140
(Killing part candidate 2, Zhang Jia Hao)

781
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,450
Good.

782
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,650
He's charismatic,

783
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,820
and he's good at making strong facial expressions.

784
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,390
I'm a little worried,

785
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,190
but I thought that I should never fall behind.

786
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,900
(Killing part candidate 3, Lee Sang Won)

787
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,420
He's good.

788
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,990
- They were both good. - Right.

789
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:37,090
I just felt a little disappointed in my performance.

790
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:40,260
I think Sang Won is really good at using his facial expressions,

791
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,629
and Hao has such sexy looks...

792
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,970
that go well with the song.

793
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,970
I don't think there was anyone who wasn't suited for the part.

794
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,069
Then, now,

795
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,710
we'll vote for the killing part.

796
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:54,739
Shall we point to the person who we think...

797
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,150
should do the killing part?

798
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,980
Gosh, please let it be me.

799
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,550
It has to be me.

800
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,350
I really want the killing part.

801
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,090
One, two, three.

802
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:10,259
(Lee Sang Won)

803
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,059
(Zhang Jia Hao)

804
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,259
(Only Kim Geon Woo's vote remains.)

805
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,400
(Who will get the final vote?)

806
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,670
(Lee Sang Won, 2)

807
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:21,800
We've decided that Lee Sang Won will do the killing part.

808
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:27,180
(Lee Sang Won takes the killing part in Team "Chains.")

809
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,179
Give him a round of applause.

810
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,009
(Lee Sang Won took the killing part after an intense competition.)

811
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,450
I was happy,

812
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,690
but I also felt bad...

813
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,320
toward Hao and An Xin.

814
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:42,930
Still, since my teammates trusted me and voted for me,

815
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,530
I thought that I should work myself to the bone...

816
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:48,260
to give an impressive performance.

817
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,730
I'll try to make you feel proud to be on our team.

818
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,809
Then, shall we divide up the parts?

819
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:57,810
- Let's do that. - Let's go.

820
00:38:57,811 --> 00:38:59,380
Then, let's decide the killing part first.

821
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,840
Who wants to do the killing part?

822
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,549
(Li Zi Hao was the killing part before.)

823
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,480
(The new killing part challenger, Yoo Kang Min)

824
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,180
Gosh, this is hard.

825
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,420
If you want the killing part,

826
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,390
then...

827
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:14,260
you can come and take it

828
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,889
(He said that he'd give up the killing part...)

829
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,429
(to gather team members, but...)

830
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,460
I like that.

831
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,830
Honestly, Kang Min was so...

832
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,870
You can just tell that he has a different look in his eyes.

833
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,340
The applicants are Li Zi Hao and Kang Min.

834
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,509
Then, you can learn the song.

835
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,669
"What are you talking about?"

836
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,309
You can start there.

837
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,379
- Oh, the song? - Until "Main dish."

838
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,380
Okay.

839
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,949
(The chorus expresses the concept of the song well.)

840
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:42,019
Show us some of the choreography too.

841
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,290
Because this killing part is different from other songs.

842
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,419
- The choreography is important? - The choreography is important.

843
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,659
Hang on, then. The choreography...

844
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,159
Yes, learn that first.

845
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,930
(Application requirements for the killing part 2, Learn choreography)

846
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,659
(He must learn the song and dance within a short period...)

847
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,900
(and try out for the killing part. How will it go?)

848
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,870
I must take the killing part, no matter what.

849
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,870
This is what I came here to do.

850
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:04,710
I don't think there's a role for me to play here.

851
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,710
I'll go and look for a better spot.

852
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,809
Did you get angry just now?

853
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:12,950
Your expression doesn't look great.

854
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,220
- I mean, I'm not happy. - Sure.

855
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,620
You got pushed out.

856
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,360
(Yoo Kang Min starts practicing the killing part.)

857
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,329
I really couldn't lose this.

858
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,430
If I don't do this,

859
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,370
there was nothing more I could do here.

860
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,780
Kang Min was so passionate.

861
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:43,409
He was dancing as if his body was going to shatter.

862
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,980
He looked like a madman.

863
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,920
What are you talking about?

864
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,820
Kang Min sure is crazy.

865
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:54,020
He didn't seem like the Kang Min that I knew.

866
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,460
Everyone was so scared.

867
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,800
I pretty much almost cried.

868
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:04,499
(He practices the killing part for 10 minutes nonstop.)

869
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,629
I'm ready now.

870
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,700
- Oh, are you? - Yes.

871
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,040
Please, let's get it now.

872
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,110
(Yoo Kang Min was determined to try out for the killing part.)

873
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,240
What are you talking about?

874
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:22,920
(Dancing as if his body would shatter)

875
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,430
How can I beat that version of Kang Min?

876
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,230
That version of Kang Min. He was just...

877
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,860
full of fury.

878
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,030
How can I beat the furious version of Kang Min?

879
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,300
(Li Zi Hao tries out for the killing part once more.)

880
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,300
What are you talking about?

881
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,939
(Li Zi Hao tries his best...)

882
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,610
(to beat the furious version of Yoo Kang Min.)

883
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:53,520
Yes, that's it.

884
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,850
I think he was somewhat overwhelmed by Kang Min's spirit.

885
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:58,889
Kang Min practiced for ten minutes.

886
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:01,420
Are you sure you practiced this for a week?

887
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,359
It looks like Kang Min practiced for about a week.

888
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,600
That's the feeling that I got.

889
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:14,570
I'll announce the killing part for Team "MAIN DISH."

890
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,670
I can never lose this.

891
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:19,610
That's the thought I mostly had.

892
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,080
The killing part for Team "MAIN DISH" is...

893
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,079
Let's go, Yoo!

894
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,279
(Yoo Kang Min takes the killing part for Team "MAIN DISH.")

895
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,349
- Let's go, Kang Min! - Congratulations, Kang Min.

896
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,420
Let's go.

897
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,150
Kang Min really did so well.

898
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,860
I'll put the sticker on you.

899
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:36,289
(Li Zi Hao takes off his killing part sticker.)

900
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:37,430
Where should I put it?

901
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,530
Here. No, above here.

902
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,160
You have so many stars.

903
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,200
Congratulations!

904
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:44,600
- Congratulations! - Thank you.

905
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,139
I'll work hard.

906
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,670
- You should work hard. - I'll work hard.

907
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,940
You really did well.

908
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:52,210
I felt so bad towards Hao and so grateful too.

909
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,879
I think I had more of a sense of responsibility...

910
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,410
to do that much better.

911
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,220
I will really work hard.

912
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:03,650
Okay.

913
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:09,190
(Team "MAIN DISH" learns the choreography from Li Zi Hao.)

914
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,559
That's right.

915
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,159
(In focus mode as he bites down on his lips)

916
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,799
(The team members try the choreography...)

917
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,000
(that they just learned with the music.)

918
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,310
Let's try it again.

919
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:28,510
(They practice over and over without music.)

920
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:34,720
Kang Min's spirit was no joke.

921
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:37,120
His gaze. It was on fire.

922
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,430
Kang Min's fury.

923
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:47,230
I think that's a weapon for our team to win.

924
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:53,570
(Morning dawns at Planet Camp.)

925
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,840
(Chun Bae is going to work.)

926
00:43:58,270 --> 00:43:59,410
He's coming.

927
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:03,480
(The participants start their day with a run.)

928
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,849
Desperation is one thing,

929
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:08,149
but I think I started to become extremely determined.

930
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:11,320
I should show everyone that this performance...

931
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,860
isn't the end for sure.

932
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,389
I'm in 16th place,

933
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:21,159
so I'm right on the threshold of the finals.

934
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,969
I still have a lot that I want to show people.

935
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:24,800
I definitely want to perform in the finals.

936
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,939
At least once.

937
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,240
I just want to show everyone what I can do just one more time.

938
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,079
I think this performance can show...

939
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,720
more than 100 percent of our desperation.

940
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,490
And give an even better performance.

941
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:55,430
(Yoo Kang Min)

942
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,200
(They burned every ounce of energy they had.)

943
00:44:59,201 --> 00:45:00,470
That's what I call "MAIN DISH."

944
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:02,069
- Let's go! - Let's go!

945
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,470
(Chun Bae rolls around too.)

946
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,140
- The last lap. - The last one.

947
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:09,579
The semi-finals are such a precious opportunity for me.

948
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,580
I want to give a performance with no regrets.

949
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:14,049
I will make my part, which lasts ten seconds,

950
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:16,689
shine the brightest...

951
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:18,290
and show everyone what I've got.

952
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,159
I can't back off any further now.

953
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,460
I think this will be my last chance to take a leap forward.

954
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,530
I will just practice to death.

955
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:33,070
I want to give an impressive performance...

956
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,240
with the song that the Star Creators chose for me.

957
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,109
(Their cheering fans are all lined up, )

958
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:44,179
(and you can't even see where the line ends.)

959
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,249
(Kim Jun Min, Lee Sang Won)

960
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:46,349
(Dong Gyu, please marry me.)

961
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:47,450
- I love you. - I love you.

962
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:50,520
(The Star Creators begin entering one by one.)

963
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:52,320
What is this? Oh, my.

964
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,160
- What is this? - Say something.

965
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:57,389
(A booth where they can cheer for their favorite participants)

966
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:58,859
I gave up on my college entrance exams and came here.

967
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,029
- What should I say? - Meki.

968
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,099
I love you.

969
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:04,900
Yun Seo, please do many great performances and debut. Let's go!

970
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:07,439
Li Zi Hao, the fans won't give up on you.

971
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,809
So you shouldn't give up either. Let's go! Love you.

972
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:12,369
Masato, you can make your debut.

973
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:14,679
- I think I'm going to cry. - You go first.

974
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,609
- Don't cry. - You're crying.

975
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:18,409
Number one in looks, Li Zi Hao. Let's go.

976
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:19,719
Lee Leo, let's go.

977
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,780
- Let's go. - Chung San Hyeon, let's go!

978

- Lee Sang Won, burn it up - Lee Sang Won, burn it up

979

- Lee Leo, burn it up - Lee Leo, burn it up

980
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:27,459
- Love you. - Love you.

981
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,789
- Let's go. - Let's go.

982
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:30,730
- Lee Leo, come here. - Lee Leo, come here.

983
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:33,360
(Lee Leo is here.)

984
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,370
Gosh, this is so pretty.

985
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:45,340
(The looks are becoming more and more bling-bling.)

986
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,110
You look really handsome today.

987
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:50,450
You too.

988
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:54,379
The face is shining brighter today.

989
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:57,320
This is the magic of a glowing face.

990
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,020
I've become so handsome.

991
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,689
(Star Creators, you just wait.)

992
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,959
(Star Creators have filled up the seats.)

993
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,459
(Why is this so nerve-racking?)

994
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,860
(Kim Jun Seo, Lee Leo, Hu Han Wen)

995
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,939
(Give me a hug, Chung Sang Hyeon.)

996
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,970
(Woo Jin's beauty advances into the universe.)

997
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:20,379

Lee Sang Won.

1000
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:24,279
(Great to see you.)

1001
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,179
Great to see you.

1002
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:27,650
(Lee Jeong)

1003
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,820
I want to make a performance that I won't regret.

1004
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:34,520
I will try to show my unique charms.

1005
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,029
I think this might be the last chance to leap forward.

1006
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:38,260
I have to go to the finals.

1007
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:42,060
I want to be Masato that will shine the most.

1008
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:46,400
Honestly, who knows who will make it to the finals or not?

1009
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,300
I just want to do well.

1010
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,809

(BOYS II PLANET Planet Master, THE 8)

1016
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,269
This is crazy.

1017
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:21,270
Hello, Star Creators.

1018
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,770
I'm THE 8 from SEVENTEEN.

1019
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:24,270
(Sun Heng Yu)

1020
00:48:24,271 --> 00:48:25,310
THE 8.

1021
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:28,240
After the announcement of the Second Survivor Announcement,

1022
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:31,879
only 24 final All Stars survived...

1023
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,650
and made it to the Semi-finals today.

1024
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:39,790
There's only one stage left before the final live broadcast...

1025
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:42,120
that will determine their debut.

1026
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,530
This is the stage...

1027
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,960
through which they will advance to the final stage.

1028
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,400
Now, we will reveal...

1029
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,170
the semi-finals mission of BOYS II PLANET.

1030
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:53,940
(Lee Sang Won)

1031
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,710
It is Debut Concept Battle.

1032
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:03,509
The Debut Concept Battle is a mission where we can check...

1033
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:06,850
the various concepts participants will present after their debut.

1034
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:10,520
The top team and participant will be chosen...

1035
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:15,220
through votes from on-site Star Creators.

1036
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,089
Now, the semi-finals mission,

1037
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:21,200
the Debut Concept Battle, begins.

1038
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,769

1039
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:26,740
- Max the power. - Max the power.

(A talented idol, Park Dong Gyu, Leo)

1041
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,040
(Hu Han Wen)

1042
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:35,579
Since they've all survived this far,

1043
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,579
to some extent, their skills are...

1044
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,719
- Guaranteed. - Yes. It is guaranteed.

1045
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,579
I really think the team that has spirit...

1046
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:44,219
and dominate the stage will do well here.

1047
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,220
That's right.

1048
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,160
(Master Lee Seok Hoon checks the first performer of the stage.)

1049
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:51,660
Shall we get uplifted?

1050
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:53,359
The first stage is...

1051
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,559
a hip-hop song that expresses the confidence...

1052
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,229
to show ourselves as we are.

1053
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:59,329

This is a performance I was really looking forward to. "Lucky MACHO."

00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:21,020
(He Xin Long, you should debut.)

1065
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,960
(Park Dong Gyu, I love you.)

1066
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,770
(Park Jun Il)

1067
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:32,569
- Vroom, Hello. - Vroom, Hello.

1068
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:35,800
We're the team that will take you, Star Creators, to your destination.

1069
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,670
- We are Team Triple Seven. - We are Team Triple Seven.

1070
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:43,249
I am Jun Min, the first runner of the killing part...

1071
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,380
that will run to the hearts of Star Creators.

1072
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,880
(Kim Jun Min, The main character on stage)

1073
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,649
(Starting the engine for an extreme introvert)

1074
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:50,720
(Studying the faces of people)

1075
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,689
Jun Min really plucked up his courage here.

1076
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:53,690
He's cute.

1077
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:57,759
I am the youngest by age and the last in rank as well.

1078
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,960
I am Park Dong Gyu, who wants to be recognized as the leader...

1079
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:02,659
and main vocalist of "Lucky MACHO."

1080
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,969
(Park Dong Gyu, I love you.)

1081
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:05,700
(Dong Gyu, heart)

1082
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:07,470
"Lucky MACHO."

1083
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:09,570
Gosh, his voice.

1084
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,340
"Lucky MACHO."

1085
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:15,709
I am the third runner, He Xin Long, who is afraid of motorcycles.

1086
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:17,580
(Park Jun Il)

1087
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:20,680
Ready to run with the Star Creators.

1088
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:22,219
Vroom.

1089
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:24,820
I am Park Jun Il, the fourth runner.

1090
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,959
The fifth runner, who has returned with a new look,

1091
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,560
is not the main dancer today, but Yumeki, the rapper.

1092
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,900
I am the last runner, Hu Han Wen.

1093
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,300
Let's start together.

1094
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,870
He looks like he will ride a bicycle.

1095
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:41,940
"Lucky MACHO" is...

1096
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,110
"Lucky MACHO" was great from the interim check.

1097
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,110
- Hello. - Hello.

1098
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,220
It's good to see you.

1099
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:56,179
This is how the teams are made, right?

1100
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,189
- Yes. - Yes.

1101
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:59,350
- All of them are All Stars. - They are?

1102
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,420
All Stars are the ones that are left.

1103
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,729
Since there are 24 of them here we could divide them into 8,

1104
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:06,390
- and we can have 3 teams made. - That's right.

1105
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,729
Shall we do that then? Shall we organize it like that?

1106
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:10,429
Thank you for watching BOYS II PLANET...

1107
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:11,770
- so far. - Thank you.

1108
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:14,500
I wish they all debuted.

1109
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,340
I hope they all debut and do well.

1110
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:18,039
- Let's see then. - Yes.

1111
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,169
Let's start with "Lucky MACHO."

1112
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:20,310
(Team "Lucky MACHO" is the first for the interim check.)

1113
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:21,640
I'm looking forward.

1114
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,309
Two, three.

1115
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:24,349
- Hello. - Hello.

1116
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:25,809
We are Team "Lucky MACHO."

1117
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,550
- We hope you enjoy. - We hope you enjoy.

1118
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:31,949
Dong Gyu, you are the main vocalist.

1119
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:32,950
Yes, that is correct.

1120
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:37,460
I want to listen to Dong Gyu do the main vocalist part.

1121
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:40,430
(He tried for the main vocalist part with the members' suggestion.)

1122
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:45,970
(Park Dong Gyu effortlessly performed the main vocalist part.)

1123
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,799
- I'll do my best. - Yes.

1124
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,070
(Park Dong Gyu confirmed for the main vocalist part)

1125
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,709
Okay, let's see.

1126
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:51,739
- Yes. - Yes.

1127
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,339
Please know that we'll be more strict...

1128
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,879
as some of the choreographers are in the room, okay?

1129
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:56,880
- Yes. - Yes.

1130
00:52:56,881 --> 00:52:58,280
I was worried a lot.

1131
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,250
I'm in trouble. I should do a good job.

1132
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:05,150
(Killing part Kim Jun Min takes the start.)

1133
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,050
Yes.

1134
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,350
- Nice. - They are really good.

1135
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,920
So...

1136
00:53:38,921 --> 00:53:41,690
(So what are the Masters' evaluations?)

1137
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,929
I'm actually not going to say a lot. I'm really proud of you guys.

1138
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:48,330
For the short time that you guys had...

1139
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:53,129
if it is this well as it is right now, I'm really proud of you all.

1140
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:56,069
And the killing part is great, Jun Min.

1141
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:57,170
It's really cool.

1142
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:58,310
Thank you.

1143
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:01,039
Dong Gyu, you sing well.

1144
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,040
- Thank you. - He sang well.

1145
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,409
I think this team should do exactly as you did now.

1146
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,419
You've done a good job.

1147
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:08,519
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1148
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,189
(Interim check ended with a positive evaluation.)

1149
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:11,190
Well done.

1150
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,719
- Hello. - Hello.

1151
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,720
(After the interim check ended)

1152
00:54:13,721 --> 00:54:15,559
(What did Team "MAIN DISH" find?)

1153
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,529
(The results of Masters' evaluation of the interim check)

1154
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:19,529
Indeed, Team "Lucky MACHO" is the first.

1155
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:21,330
Jun Min won first place.

1156
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,500
Jun Min.

1157
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:26,840
Indeed, he's my friend.

1158
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,300
You are my friend.

1159
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:31,810
(Team "Lucky MACHO" finally checked the results.)

1160
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:35,540
(Self-celebration for winning first place)

1161
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:42,980
(A steady applause that brings something to mind)

1162
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:46,150
- First of all... - I'm really happy.

1163
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:48,559
- Is this for real? - We became a first place team.

1164
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,029
You know that, right?

1165
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:51,560
If you become first place here, you can't become first place there.

1166
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:58,200
(Master Na Yun Seo's crisis theory of First place in interim check)

1167
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:00,069
If you become first place here, you can't become first place there.

1168
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:01,939
- We need to break that. - We need to break that.

1169
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:02,940
You know what it is.

1170
00:55:02,941 --> 00:55:04,239
Let's try to break the jinx.

1171
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,570
We made a pledge to break it ourselves.

1172
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:10,810
(That night)

1173
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:15,650
(Team "Lucky MACHO" is wrapping up the day.)

1174
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:17,619
(Exclaiming)

1175
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:19,420
- How is it? - It's good.

1176
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:23,190
Why can't I believe it's the semi-finals?

1177
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:24,590
It is unbelievable.

1178
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:26,330
How did we live through?

1179
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,130
- Seriously. - How did I live through?

1180
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:35,640
(Kim Min Jun and Park Dong Gyu survived with dramatic rank rise.)

1181
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:39,309
We first came here...

1182
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:40,939
- with the IST guys. - We did.

1183
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:45,580
- I came with big ambitions. - Right.

1184
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,550
You are All Stars.

1185
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:51,220
I thought we should all go to the finals.

1186
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:56,589
I thought that, but the world isn't easy.

1187
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:57,630
That's right.

1188
00:55:58,190 --> 00:55:59,890
- There are so many that are great. - Right.

1189
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,700
There are so many people that are charming.

1190
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:06,069
This was why I really thought this was true.

1191
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:09,000
Every detail must be done with a lot of effort.

1192
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,310
I've really felt that as well.

1193
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:13,269
Let's get the draft and end things tomorrow.

1194
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:14,810
- Let's ask for that. - Right.

1195
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:17,010
I think that's only right. Let's finish everything tomorrow.

1196
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:18,950
We'll gather on the 1st floor by 9am, right?

1197
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,450
Right.

1198
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:21,580
I should get up early.

1199
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:24,420
I want to reach the final.

1200
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:27,159
- Can we go? - Will Dong Gyu go for it?

1201
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,360
(That night deepens.)

1202
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,459
All Star Camp, it's currently 8:50am.

1203
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,659
It's 9am in 10 minutes.

1204
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,570
Please gather by that time on the first floor.

1205
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:40,840
(A while later)

1206
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,370
Hello.

1207
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:46,469
(Park Dong Gyu is the first to get to work...)

1208
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:49,140
(along with Kim Jun Min.)

1209
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:51,109
(The participants gather on the 1st floor of the All Star Camp...)

1210
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:52,910
(and head to the practice room with the security team.)

1211
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:56,990
(The time to gather gets closer.)

1212
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:00,619
It's time to gather.

1213
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:01,920
Please come down.

1214
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:03,929
(The participants quickly get ready to get to work.)

1215
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:06,830
Please come down. It's 9:01am right now.

1216
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,370
(Kim Jun Min and Park Dong Gyu naturally wait for the others.)

1217
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:18,840
(During the Signal Song Test practice session)

1218
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:21,680
(Kim Jun Min and Park Dong Gyu came first.)

1219
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:25,710
(They calmly greeted the other participant.)

1220
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:29,820
(The next morning)

1221
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:33,760
(Kim Jun Min and Park Dong Gyu came 1st again.)

1222
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:36,220
(They were 1st even when preparing for the "S-Class" performance.)

1223
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,490
(They were first the next day as well.)

1224
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:42,359
(During the whole time in the camp, )

1225
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:46,000
(these two participants were never late even once.)

1226
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,599
It was a group life.

1227
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,840
I wanted to come out early even if the others were sleeping.

1228
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,180
Did we come down too quickly?

1229
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,049
(The moment when they just entered the camp)

1230
00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:00,079
- Oh, it's my roommate. - Hello.

1231
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,180
Hello.

1232
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,220
(Kim Jun Min and Park Dong Gyu met as roommates.)

1233
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:04,689
How old are you?

1234
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:07,219
- I was born in 2002. - I was born in 2005.

1235
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:08,320
I see.

1236
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:11,430
You can speak casually with me. I'll treat you as my older brother.

1237
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:15,599
(That was how the first morning of Planet Camp came.)

1238
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,330
(Thinking about whether to wake him up or not)

1239
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:20,099
We have to go down...

1240
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,269
- if we want to eat now. - Okay.

1241
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:23,969
(Kim Jun Min woke Park Dong Gyu up for the first morning.)

1242
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:26,309
(And even after that, )

1243
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:29,539
(Kim Jun Min woke Park Dong Gyu up every morning.)

1244
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:30,650
I think you should get up.

1245
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,979
- Dong Gyu, you should wash up. - Right.

1246
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,150
Hurry up and wash up.

1247
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:38,390
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1248
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:44,590
(Kim Jun Min is in charge of waking Park Dong Gyu up every morning.)

1249
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:46,460
Thanks to Jun Min,

1250
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,569
I was able to get up even when I was exhausted.

1251
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:52,270
Normally, when a person...

1252
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:54,269
is constantly stuck with another person,

1253
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:58,310
there are points of disappointment that can be found.

1254
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,709
But with Jun Min, he seemed to be greater...

1255
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:04,550
the more I got to know him.

1256
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:07,180
I've learned a lot from Jun Min,

1257
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,580
but I think keeping the basics...

1258
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,720
is the hardest thing to do.

1259
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:14,760
I think Dong Gyu...

1260
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:16,890
wakes up a lot better now than at the start.

1261
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,290
Dong Gyu, you should wash up.

1262
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:22,760
(Getting up right away)

1263
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,970
While being in a training camp,

1264
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,170
I believe that...

1265
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:29,469
taking care of each small detail...

1266
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:32,110
will bring positive results.

1267
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:36,040
And in the midst of survival...

1268
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,050
Could I call him a friend that I have found?

1269
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:42,120
(Like a cheeky friend at times)

1270
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:45,419
(Like a reliable older brother at times)

1271
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:48,089
A younger brother that I can rely on?

1272
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:49,219
It feels like I have found a younger brother...

1273
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,330
that feels like a friend.

1274
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:52,989
At that time, the semi-finals felt like...

1275
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:55,560
something that was going to happen after 40 years.

1276
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:57,329
(The two participants and roommates...)

1277
00:59:57,330 --> 00:59:58,629
(both became friends that they can rely on.)

1278
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:00,030
I feel very comfortable with him.

1279
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:03,070
No one else can be my roommate now.

1280
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:06,809
(After close friends Jun Min and Dong Gyu...)

1281
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:08,510
(arrive first, )

1282
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:14,580
(the other participants gather one by one.)

1283
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:17,820
I love it!

1284
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:20,019
(Team "Lucky MACHO" is having a massage session before practice.)

1285
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:21,090
Han Wen is good at this.

1286
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:24,960
It feels relieving.

1287
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:26,429
This one.

1288
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:27,529
(They warm themselves up diligently before practice.)

1289
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:28,660
Nice!

1290
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,099
This needs to be done.

1291
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,900
(Even his feet are very diligent.)

1292
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:34,939
I think it's because it goes up too much.

1293
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:37,340
(They start practicing in groups of two after warming up.)

1294
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:39,170
I think our team atmosphere is amazing.

1295
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:42,109
Dong Gyu led us really well too.

1296
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:44,310
(Practicing the pronunciation)

1297
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:47,079
Jun Min felt like a strong pillar for us.

1298
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,650
It's this sort of vibe.

1299
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,249
They're both very talented...

1300
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,820
and work really hard.

1301
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:55,720
I think I can work hard as well thanks to them.

1302
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:00,830
(Team "Lucky MACHO" carries on with the practice.)

1303
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:03,029
We went back to our roots...

1304
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:04,769
and we're doing everything with the mindset of,

1305
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:06,470
"Practice makes perfect."

1306
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:08,800
We will carry on...

1307
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,840
until we look impressive on stage.

1308
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:16,109
As we're in the same team,

1309
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:19,980
I will feel a lot happier if we all win together.

1310
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:23,789
- Lucky! MACHO! - Lucky! MACHO!

1311
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:25,190
Let's go!

1312
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:27,890
I really want to take first place.

1313
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,560
I want to do well.

1314
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:34,129
With a heart more desperate than anyone else,

1315
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:35,960
I want to show a great performance to everyone.

1316
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:40,600
Let's do well, babies.

1317
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:41,770
Let's do this, guys.

1318
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:02,160
It feels like a commercial.

1319
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:48,170
(Give me a hug, Chung Sang Hyeon.)

1320
01:02:48,171 --> 01:02:49,640
- I'm so excited. - Gosh!

1321
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,140
Here it comes.

1322
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:52,339
I'm nervous.

1323
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:53,510
I'm excited.

1324
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:57,679
("Lucky MACHO")

1325
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,180
- Yumeki! - Yes!

1326
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:09,760
(Give me a hug, Chung Sang Hyeon.)

1327
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:18,500
Let's go, Yumeki!

1328
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:50,500
Nice!

1329
01:03:58,740 --> 01:03:59,740
Come on!

1330
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:06,750
(Hu Han Wen)

1331
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:20,390
(Give me a hug, Chung Sang Hyeon.)

1332
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:42,350
Gosh, look at him smile!

1333
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:00,700
(Make your debut, He Xin Long.)

1334
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:20,020
(The most special one of the special ones, Kim Jun Min)

1335
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,360
(Leo)

1336
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
(Chen Kai Wen)

1337
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,630
He's really cool.

1338
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,529
(The birth of the new boy group with the romantic and energetic vibe)

1339
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:32,730
(You can watch the full version on YouTube and Mnet Plus.)

1340
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:36,129
(Park Dong Gyu)

1341
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:37,899
(Yumeki)

1342
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:39,529
(Park Jun Il)

1343
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:41,139
(Hu Han Wen)

1344
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:42,769
(He Xin Long)

1345
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:45,770
(Killing part: Kim Jun Min)

1346
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:49,480
That was really cool.

1347
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:51,080
They're quite good.

1348
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:53,609
That's amazing.

1349
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:55,220
Let's go, Jun Min!

1350
01:06:58,090 --> 01:06:59,250
Macho.

1351
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:01,890
Actually, no one here is bad at performing now.

1352
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,760
Everyone is good.

1353
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:06,159
Jun Min really portrayed...

1354
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,659
the vision of the killing part.

1355
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:10,600
When we actually created it, we didn't know who will...

1356
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:13,169
Who will take it or whatever,

1357
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:15,700
but Jun Min was actually a perfect match.

1358
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:18,969
There's no one who can nail the killing part like that...

1359
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:20,780
- with that tone. - That's right.

1360
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:22,780
Dong Gyu's vocals were so good.

1361
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:25,050
Even when you sing in falsetto,

1362
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:26,950
the notes often shake when you sing while dancing.

1363
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:28,679
Dong Gyu is really good.

1364
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:29,820
He has many talents.

1365
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:32,749
You could feel how much they practiced.

1366
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:34,690
Seriously. You could feel how much they practiced.

1367
01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:38,860
We'll begin the individual voting for Team "Lucky MACHO."

1368
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:41,359
If you think the participant did well,

1369
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,060
press "O."

1370
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:45,300
(Kim Jun Min, you're crazy!)

1371
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:47,300
The voting is closed.

1372
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:51,070
Well done.

1373
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:53,370
You did so well.

1374
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:55,410
Let's go, "Lucky MACHO."

1375
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:58,080
- I had fun thanks to you. - Right.

1376
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:01,250
I smiled during verse three because I was having so much fun.

1377
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:05,320
(Kim Jun Min's smile of happiness)

1378
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:08,660
It was an excited smile.

1379
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:10,990
In the last mission,

1380
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:13,629
I also had...

1381
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:15,530
self-doubt and anxiety,

1382
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:17,329
so I couldn't fully enjoy it.

1383
01:08:17,330 --> 01:08:19,270
This time, I feel so light.

1384
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:22,040
I think I gave it everything I had.

1385
01:08:24,210 --> 01:08:25,610
(Debut Concept Battle)

1386
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:27,640
This moment always makes me so nervous.

1387
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:28,840
It drives me crazy.

1388
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:30,310
I think my heart is about to stop.

1389
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:32,810
I think Dong Gyu's score will be really high this time.

1390
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:34,480
It wouldn't make sense if his score is low.

1391
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:37,020
- Dong Gyu's score has to be high. - Come on.

1392
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:41,659
(Main Vocal, Park Dong Gyu, Leader)

1393
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:42,890
(Main vocalist Park Dong Gyu: 1,730 points)

1394
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,590
(Main vocalist Park Dong Gyu: 1,730 points)

1395
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:53,469
(The participants are shocked by his high score.)

1396
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:55,470
(Wolf King He Xin Long is also shocked.)

1397
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,740
Macho ace Dong Gyu.

1398
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:59,639
I think they'll all have high scores.

1399
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:00,940
I think they'll all have high scores.

1400
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,409
Well done, Dong Gyu.

1401
01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:03,680
Thank you.

1402
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:07,550
(Will they continue getting high scores?)

1403
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,650
(Park Jun Il's score will be revealed next.)

1404
01:09:10,650 --> 01:09:11,890
(Sub vocalist 1 Park Jun Il: 960 points)

1405
01:09:11,950 --> 01:09:14,149
(Sub vocalist 1 Park Jun Il: 960 points)

1406
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,489
- Well done. - Well done!

1407
01:09:15,490 --> 01:09:17,289
- Well done. - Well done!

1408
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:19,290
- Jun Il! - Well done.

1409
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:20,630
(The participants are shocked by the unexpectedly low score.)

1410
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,860
You can never know what the audience thinks.

1411
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,900
(Main rapper He Xin Long's score will be revealed next.)

1412
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:27,769
- I'm looking forward to it. - Xin Long.

1413
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:28,900
(What is He Xin Long's score?)

1414
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:31,770
(Main rapper He Xin Long: 1,210 points)

1415
01:09:31,870 --> 01:09:33,409
(Main rapper He Xin Long: 1,210 points)

1416
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:35,079
- Well done. - Well done.

1417
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:36,879
- Well done. - Well done.

1418
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,750
(The team members encourage He Xin Long.)

1419
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:42,320
I really don't understand why Xin Long got 1,210 points.

1420
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,289
(The scores continue to be revealed.)

1421
01:09:44,290 --> 01:09:45,319
Let's go.

1422
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,320
(Hu Han Wen received a high score.)

1423
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,689
(Yumeki also received a high score.)

1424
01:09:49,690 --> 01:09:52,229
Let's go!

1425
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:53,559
Well done!

1426
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,330
(Leader Park Dong Gyu received the highest points so far.)

1427
01:09:55,530 --> 01:09:56,859
(Will Kim Jun Min get the highest score?)

1428
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,230
(The 1st in the team will be a candidate to get extra benefits.)

1429
01:09:58,300 --> 01:09:59,530
(Will he really get 2,000 points?)

1430
01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:01,370
Maybe 1,860 points?

1431
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:04,140
I think it will be 1,920 points.

1432
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:05,669
It would be high.

1433
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:07,039
Maybe he'll get the highest.

1434
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,639
About 1,980?

1435
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:09,809
(What score will killing part Kim Jun Min receive?)

1436
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:11,649
(Sub rapper 2 Kim Jun Min)

1437
01:10:11,650 --> 01:10:12,780
(Sub rapper 2 Kim Jun Min: 1,850 points)

1438
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:15,850
(Killing part and sub rapper 2 Kim Jun Min: 1,850 points)

1439
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:23,290
(Kim Jun Min received the highest score in the team.)

1440
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:24,660
This is right.

1441
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:26,959
(Park Dong Gyu and Kim Jun Min are in 1st and 2nd places.)

1442
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,460
You did so well.

1443
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,660
Well done.

1444
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:33,399
Most of all,

1445
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,870
Jun Min and I were 1st and 2nd side by side.

1446
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:37,340
That made me really glad.

1447
01:10:37,870 --> 01:10:40,040
I felt proud since we were 1st and 2nd together.

1448
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:43,440
We were capable people in the end.

1449
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:45,150
That came to my mind.

1450
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:46,950
I felt proud.

1451
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:53,450
(The team's crisis began.)

1452
01:10:53,520 --> 01:11:00,260
(It's hard to keep the killing part position.)

1453
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:06,530
(The conflict among the team members reached its peak.)

1454
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:08,540
(Yet the legend continues.)

1455
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:14,280
("MAIN DISH," bursting with energy and a fearless vibe)

1456
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:18,779
("Sugar HIGH" with ultimate cuteness and refreshing energy)

1457
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:23,850
("Chains," with a seriously charming energy)

1458
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:28,660
(All the semi-final performances will be revealed.)

1459
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:30,320
(And)

1460
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:37,830
(Shocking news that stuns everyone)

1461
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:40,129
(Soon, the interim rankings of the 4th round global voting...)

1462
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:42,070
(will be revealed.)

1463
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:46,110
The next song...

1464
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:48,980
captures the sweet and fluttering emotions of first love,

1465
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:52,079
expressed through a refreshing sound.

1466
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,150
"Sugar HIGH!"

1467
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:54,580
"Sugar HIGH."

1468
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:55,850
It's "Sugar HIGH."

1469
01:11:58,790 --> 01:12:00,289
Let's go, high sugar.

1470
01:12:00,290 --> 01:12:01,559
Let's go, high sugar content.

1471
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:02,820
(Laughing)

1472
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:15,640
Please introduce yourselves, Team "Sugar HIGH."

1473
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,109
We're looking for owners...

1474
01:12:19,110 --> 01:12:20,969
- who will raise us. - Who will raise us.

1475
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:25,410
- We're Team Kitty Kisses. - Team Kitty Kisses.

1476
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:27,980
(Macho kitty kisses)

1477
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:30,949
Hello. I'm looking for an owner who will love me.

1478
01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:33,450
I'm Tong Tong Sato, Masato.

1479
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:38,360
I'm Han Eum who is looking for an owner.

1480
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:41,930
I'm a cat, not a puppy-like cat. I'm Sang Hyeon.

1481
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:44,230
"I'm a cat, not a puppy-like cat."

1482
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:46,569
I'm looking for an owner who will hug me.

1483
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:48,140
I'm Li Yu.

1484
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:52,440
I'm looking for an owner who will put me to sleep well.

1485
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:53,870
I'm Woo Jin.

1486
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:56,640
I'm looking for an owner who will adore me.

1487
01:12:56,810 --> 01:12:58,310
I'm Yun Seo.

1488
01:12:58,680 --> 01:12:59,780
He's cute.

1489
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:03,019
Participant Na Yun Seo.

1490
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:05,350
How was it preparing for this performance?

1491
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,450
Well...

1492
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:10,390
I think we had a crisis during our practice this time.

1493
01:13:11,230 --> 01:13:12,259
(Interim Check D-day)

1494
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:14,060
Team "Sugar HIGH."

1495
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,870
Ching Yu, who expressed his ambitions here,

1496
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,629
moved to another team.

1497
01:13:19,630 --> 01:13:22,900
Who is leading the performances now?

1498
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:24,940
Our youngest, Yun Seo.

1499
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:27,239
That's my brother.

1500
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,979
Is there a member who doesn't listen to you?

1501
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:30,010
(Turning)

1502
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:31,780
(Looking away)

1503
01:13:31,850 --> 01:13:33,210
A member who doesn't listen?

1504
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:35,850
It's not about not listening to me. It's...

1505
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:39,920
Someone bullies me.

1506
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:41,920
- Who is it? - Someone bullies Yun Seo?

1507
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,690
- Who is it? - Who?

1508
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:44,930
Who is it?

1509
01:13:45,190 --> 01:13:46,259
How dare you.

1510
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:47,459
Who is it?

1511
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:48,959
(Who is the member who bullied Yun Seo, the youngest?)

1512
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:51,299
Tell us. Who bullied you?

1513
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:52,369
Tell me.

1514
01:13:52,370 --> 01:13:54,399
(They're ready to scold the person who bullied the youngest.)

1515
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,100
- Tell us. - Who is it?

1516
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:58,370
(Calm down.)

1517
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:00,870
Okay. Nice.

1518
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:03,710
Hold on.

1519
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:07,950
I love you, Yun Seo.

1520
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:11,490
You would have practiced. It's okay even if you're not perfect.

1521
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:13,649
- But it has to come out, okay? - Yes.

1522
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:14,990
- Shall we start? - Yes.

1523
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,620
- Let's go. - Everyone is cute there.

1524
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:18,830
They're cute.

1525
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:23,630
(The interim check for Team "Sugar HIGH" begins.)

1526
01:14:44,050 --> 01:14:46,520
(They're not in sync overall.)

1527
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:47,820
They're really not in sync.

1528
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,820
They went quite far with the song.

1529
01:14:52,830 --> 01:14:53,930
They'll even do this part?

1530
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:56,600
They went the furthest with the song.

1531
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:03,639
Until here? You covered quite a lot.

1532
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:04,939
They went quite far.

1533
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:07,010
Why did you block me?

1534
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,510
We're in trouble.

1535
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:12,680
They lack so much detail.

1536
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:14,850
You covered quite a lot.

1537
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:16,379
You chose to cover more of the song...

1538
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:17,620
than perfect it.

1539
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:19,819
- Yes. - Yes. We didn't have much time.

1540
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:21,390
That's why you covered more.

1541
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:23,420
About the dance...

1542
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:26,829
You would already know,

1543
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:30,330
but it's lacking so much detail so far.

1544
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:32,170
So...

1545
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:35,099
you will have to practice a lot.

1546
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:36,200
- Yes. - Yes.

1547
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,140
It's dinner.

1548
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,010
- Dinner. - Yes.

1549
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:44,110
Don't be like that.

1550
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:48,320
(Team "Sugar HIGH" freezes after seeing something.)

1551
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,820
We're doomed.

1552
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,220
(Master's evaluations on the Debut Concept Battle)

1553
01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:53,549
(Team "Sugar HIGH" was chosen as the team in last place.)

1554
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:54,960
We're in last place.

1555
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:56,920
We're really in last place.

1556
01:15:58,190 --> 01:15:59,389
(They're shocked by the unexpected result.)

1557
01:15:59,390 --> 01:16:00,629
(They're shocked by the unexpected result.)

1558
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:01,700
We're last.

1559
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:06,700
Last place.

1560
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:10,800
I think I'm on the verge of elimination for real.

1561
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:15,640
(The practice room after the interim check)

1562
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:17,739
I think we should...

1563
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:19,510
We should keep working on the details.

1564
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:22,480
It's not just about the details. We have to know them by heart.

1565
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:25,719
Your body faces the front the whole time,

1566
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:26,750
but your head moves like this.

1567
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:28,960
Your head moves like this.

1568
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:30,920
Your head moves like this.

1569
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:36,860
Let's try that a few more times.

1570
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:43,669
(They don't stop practicing until they get it right.)

1571
01:16:43,670 --> 01:16:44,770
Seven, eight.

1572
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:46,970
Again. Seven, eight.

1573
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:51,880
(Peer review the next day)

1574
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:54,280
(They perform "Sugar HIGH" in front of other participants.)

1575
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:57,349
(Woo Jin and Han Eum bumped into each other...)

1576
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:59,950
(while moving around.)

1577
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:05,830
(They bump into each other again.)

1578
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:10,060
Oh, no.

1579
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,139
(Team "Sugar HIGH" finished the performance...)

1580
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:18,810
(with a mistake.)

1581
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:22,979
Is that it?

1582
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:23,980
Yes.

1583
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:25,880
Good work.

1584
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:28,049
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1585
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:29,650
(The peer review for Team "Sugar HIGH" ends.)

1586
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,920
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1587
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:35,590
I forgot my position.

1588
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,290
(The teammates read Yun Seo's countenance.)

1589
01:17:42,130 --> 01:17:44,260
What are we going to do?

1590
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:57,140
We have the peer review result.

1591
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:00,149
I'll read them one by one.

1592
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:01,650
"Failure to check stage positions."

1593
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:02,880
"Failure to check stage positions."

1594
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:04,150
"Points to improve."

1595
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:07,050
"The dance wasn't ideal."

1596
01:18:07,190 --> 01:18:08,889
"They'll need to do a better job of executing the choreography."

1597
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:10,319
"Points to improve: Dance."

1598
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,029
- "Points to improve: Dance." - Dance.

1599
01:18:12,030 --> 01:18:13,089
Right.

1600
01:18:13,090 --> 01:18:15,060
(Most of them pointed out their dancing.)

1601
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:18,600
(They keep reading Yun Seo's face.)

1602
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:23,470
I led the performance,

1603
01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:27,110
but we placed last, so I doubted my leadership.

1604
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:32,110
I started faltering then.

1605
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:36,450
I didn't want to go back to singing bright songs.

1606
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:37,920
No!

1607
01:18:37,921 --> 01:18:39,950
(Yun Seo didn't want a bright song.)

1608
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:42,120
I'm ranked low, so...

1609
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:45,159
(His chance of survival is low as he's number 20.)

1610
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,690
It feels like it'll be my last performance.

1611
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,929
(Then, he got a chance to switch songs.)

1612
01:18:49,930 --> 01:18:51,569
I want to pick "Lucky MACHO."

1613
01:18:51,570 --> 01:18:54,170
I tried to pick the song I wanted.

1614
01:18:54,370 --> 01:18:57,140
(But Team "Lucky MACHO" chose Jun Il.)

1615
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:58,769
(He ended up staying...)

1616
01:18:58,770 --> 01:19:01,009
(and being the performance leader.)

1617
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:03,910
Now, I was left all alone to lead the team.

1618
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:06,450
What should I do?

1619
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,680
What can we do?

1620
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,920
From here? Are you okay?

1621
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:14,450
Yes.

1622
01:19:14,890 --> 01:19:17,920
But I struggled as I led them.

1623
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:19,660
(Worst team: Team "Sugar HIGH," Worst member: Masato)

1624
01:19:19,661 --> 01:19:23,160
(He tried hard, but the team was chosen as the worst.)

1625
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,000
I'm upset, that's all.

1626
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,510
I thought I did my best.

1627
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:38,910
(That night)

1628
01:19:39,850 --> 01:19:42,779
(He returned to the practice room after his interview.)

1629
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:45,150
(He's lost in thought.)

1630
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:48,859
(And Masato approaches him.)

1631
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:50,260
What's on your mind?

1632
01:19:54,730 --> 01:19:55,800
You know,

1633
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,730
I still think...

1634
01:19:57,930 --> 01:19:59,499
you can do this.

1635
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:03,270
I think we should focus on how we can pull this off.

1636
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:04,910
You can just tell us.

1637
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:07,270
And I'll help you.

1638
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,510
- So will Han Eum. - Okay.

1639
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,140
He's the leader, after all.

1640
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:13,580
They saw that I was having a breakdown,

1641
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:15,320
so they comforted me.

1642
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:16,780
Our Yun Seo.

1643
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:20,989
You're working so hard. I'll do my best.

1644
01:20:20,990 --> 01:20:22,360
We can do this.

1645
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,390
We're so sorry.

1646
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:26,560
- No. - We're sorry.

1647
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:29,730
We're constantly thinking about you.

1648
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:31,430
We're older than you, after all.

1649
01:20:32,330 --> 01:20:35,599
I believe that you mean a lot to the team.

1650
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:36,670
I mean it.

1651
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:39,340
You're almost the heart of our team.

1652
01:20:39,610 --> 01:20:41,640
I was so thankful for them.

1653
01:20:41,780 --> 01:20:43,039
I saw what they did,

1654
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:46,210
and I decided to stop being discouraged as I was a leader.

1655
01:20:46,810 --> 01:20:48,620
I motivated myself again.

1656
01:20:49,150 --> 01:20:52,649
I'm confident that we can sing "Sugar HIGH" well.

1657
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:55,360
I think we have great teamwork.

1658
01:20:55,690 --> 01:20:56,819
That's true.

1659
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:59,929
We spent five months together,

1660
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:01,229
so we grew really close.

1661
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:02,930
"Sugar HIGH" is...

1662
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:06,200
a bright and refreshing song, right?

1663
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:09,170
So, I wish we could practice with smiles on our faces.

1664
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:11,670
I want to give people a joyful performance.

1665
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:13,210
You've got this, right?

1666
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:17,040
- I think we can pull this off. - Definitely.

1667
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:20,110
We may not be good enough yet,

1668
01:21:20,510 --> 01:21:23,620
but this mission is titled the Debut Concept Battle.

1669
01:21:24,350 --> 01:21:27,019
So, we'll make the most of our bright concept...

1670
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:28,360
and practice with bright smiles.

1671
01:21:28,690 --> 01:21:29,789
Like this.

1672
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:31,589
- It's like the masked dance. - Exactly.

1673
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:32,630
It goes...

1674
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:36,729
If we smile on the stage as much as we do...

1675
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:38,229
during practice,

1676
01:21:38,230 --> 01:21:41,870
I think the happiness will reach the Star Creators.

1677
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:53,450
I hope you feel our bright and cheerful energy.

1678
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:56,079
We practiced hard enough.

1679
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,679
Let's do our best and smile until the end.

1680
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:58,949
In 1, 2, 3.

1681
01:21:58,950 --> 01:22:00,390
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1682
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:04,360
We'll give you the happiest...

1683
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:06,630
and sweetest performance ever.

1684
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:11,500
- I can't wait. - I bet the audience will love it.

1685
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:14,730
The only bright song of this mission.

1686
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:15,970
I hope they do well.

1687
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:22,609
- Good luck! - So cute!

1688
01:22:22,610 --> 01:22:24,009
- Good luck! - Good luck!

1689
01:22:24,010 --> 01:22:25,779
- I love you! - You've got this!

1690
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:27,180
- Good luck! - You can do it!

1691
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:30,150
Good luck!

1692
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,219
- Yun Seo! - Li Yu!

1693
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:33,949
- Li Yu! - Good luck!

1694
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:35,090
Good luck!

1695
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:37,320
Oh, my gosh.

1696
01:22:40,630 --> 01:22:41,860
Check out the stage.

1697
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:49,040
(Jang Han Eum)

1698
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:56,340
What?

1699
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:05,590
That looks sweet.

1700
01:23:11,890 --> 01:23:13,160
(Masato)

1701
01:23:26,970 --> 01:23:27,970
(Chuei Li Yu, Kang Woo Jin, Jang Han Eum)

1702
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:32,850
Adorable.

1703
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:41,820
Good luck!

1704
01:23:41,820 --> 01:23:42,820
(Jang Han Eum)

1705
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:44,720
Good luck!

1706
01:23:46,190 --> 01:23:47,229
You've got this!

1707
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:51,060
("Sugar HIGH")

1708
01:23:54,330 --> 01:23:55,540
It's cute.

1709
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:10,880
He's good.

1710
01:24:15,190 --> 01:24:16,190
(Lee Jeong is bound to make the debut.)

1711
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,480
Sato!

1712
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:02,200
(Masato is my bunny.)

1713
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:10,380
(Masato is my bunny.)

1714
01:25:20,650 --> 01:25:21,820
Go, Woo Jin!

1715
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:26,760
I love the vibe.

1716
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:36,840
Let's go!

1717
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:50,980
Sato!

1718
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:09,040
(Chung Sang Hyeon)

1719
01:26:14,010 --> 01:26:15,010
(Jang Han Eum)

1720
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:23,050
Gosh, they're good.

1721
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:37,460
(Jang Han Eum)

1722
01:26:47,910 --> 01:26:50,109
(The birth of the new boy group with the romantic and energetic vibe)

1723
01:26:50,110 --> 01:26:52,380
(You can watch the full version on YouTube and Mnet Plus.)

1724
01:26:54,510 --> 01:26:56,079
(Kang Woo Jin)

1725
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,679
(Na Yun Seo)

1726
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:59,219
(Jang Han Eum)

1727
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:00,789

(Chuei Li Yu)

1729
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:05,790
(Masato, Killing Part)

1730
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:12,400
- That was good. - They're so cute.

1731
01:27:12,870 --> 01:27:14,570
- They're so cute. - Gosh.

1732
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:16,870
It looks like Sato improved a lot thanks to me.

1733
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:21,240
- How neat. - I watched it at ease.

1734
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:23,380
First of all, their live vocals were stable.

1735
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:25,080
It was such a delight to watch them.

1736
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:26,579
Great job. Well done.

1737
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:28,619
- Great job, guys. - My gosh.

1738
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:30,649
(Team "Sugar HIGH" finishes their performance.)

1739
01:27:30,650 --> 01:27:32,319
This might be our last stage.

1740
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:33,790
- Come on. - Don't say that.

1741
01:27:34,020 --> 01:27:35,590
I'm glad we could end it on a good note.

1742
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:38,760
- Team Kitty Kisses! - Team Kitty Kisses!

1743
01:27:39,690 --> 01:27:41,090
All right. Let's go.

1744
01:27:41,630 --> 01:27:43,130
What if I rank last?

1745
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:44,929
Hey, Yun Seo.

1746
01:27:44,930 --> 01:27:46,430
- You'll get 2,000 points. Let's go. - No.

1747
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,500
(Debut Concept Battle: Team "Sugar HIGH")

1748
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:50,100
- I'm curious about their scores. - Han Eum first?

1749
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:53,910
(Everyone is curious about their results.)

1750
01:27:54,370 --> 01:27:56,110
Will Sato win first place?

1751
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:57,940
I don't know. I can't watch this.

1752
01:27:58,950 --> 01:28:03,420
(Masato showcased his adorable charm during the performance.)

1753
01:28:04,050 --> 01:28:05,890
(What's the final result?)

1754
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:08,760
(Masato: 1,360 points)

1755
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:10,719
(Masato gets 1,360 points.)

1756
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:12,730
- You can check it. Well done. - Gosh.

1757
01:28:13,490 --> 01:28:16,000
- That's a great score. - Good job.

1758
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:18,400
- Let's go, Han Eum. - Will he get about 2,000 points?

1759
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:20,130
About 3,000 points?

1760
01:28:20,330 --> 01:28:22,640
- Han Eum sang quite well. - He did a great job.

1761
01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:24,540
Han Eum's singing is always stable.

1762
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:26,540
(What's the score for the main vocalist, Jang Han Eum?)

1763
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:30,780
(Jang Han Eum demonstrated stable singing for high notes.)

1764
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:35,619
(Debut Concept Battle: Team "Sugar HIGH")

1765
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:36,919
(Jang Han Eum: 1,680 points)

1766
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,550
(Masato: 1,360 points, Jang Han Eum: 1,680 points)

1767
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:41,350
(Jang Han Eum gets 1,680 points.)

1768
01:28:42,660 --> 01:28:43,690
That's great.

1769
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:46,130
- I knew it'd be high. - I knew it.

1770
01:28:46,690 --> 01:28:47,989
(Kang Woo Jin: 1,510 points, Chuei Li Yu: 1,540 points)

1771
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:49,029
(Chung Sang Hyeon: 1,630 points)

1772
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:51,900
(All three participants received high scores.)

1773
01:28:53,770 --> 01:28:55,669
All three of us went over 1,500 points.

1774
01:28:55,670 --> 01:28:57,739
- Your scores are high as expected. - No.

1775
01:28:57,740 --> 01:28:58,870
They all did well.

1776
01:28:59,670 --> 01:29:00,910
- We all did well. - Yes.

1777
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,379
(Na Yun Seo is worried before his result comes out.)

1778
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:05,339
- You'll be fine. Don't worry. - Yun Seo.

1779
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:07,280
Yun Seo. I'm sure it will be high.

1780
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:09,550
- Don't get my hopes up. - It's okay.

1781
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:12,250
- Yun Seo, this move was strong. - It was pretty powerful.

1782
01:29:12,490 --> 01:29:14,520
- The hat did it for you. - You were so adorable.

1783
01:29:15,090 --> 01:29:17,590
(What's Na Yun Seo's score?)

1784
01:29:17,690 --> 01:29:19,289
(Debut Concept Battle: Team "Sugar HIGH")

1785
01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:20,290
(Na Yun Seo: 1,180 points)

1786
01:29:20,291 --> 01:29:22,700
(Yun Seo comes in last on his team.)

1787
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:26,429
- Okay. It went over 1,000 points. - Not bad.

1788
01:29:26,430 --> 01:29:27,430
Not bad.

1789
01:29:27,470 --> 01:29:28,600
It's not so bad.

1790
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:30,270
- Not a bad score. - Great job.

1791
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:31,670
- Great work. - Well done.

1792
01:29:32,540 --> 01:29:34,070
- Not a bad score. - Great job.

1793
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:35,170
- Good job. - Great work.

1794
01:29:35,171 --> 01:29:36,239
- Well done. - Hang in there.

1795
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:37,680
(They shower him with words of encouragement.)

1796
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:40,180
It's disappointing.

1797
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:44,180
But if I get another chance to perform on stage,

1798
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,290
I'd like to put on a cooler and more satisfying performance.

1799
01:29:47,050 --> 01:29:49,020
As for the next song,

1800
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,689
it combines rock and hip-hop with an explosive rap performance...

1801
01:29:51,690 --> 01:29:55,230
and highlights powerful vocals.

1802
01:29:55,330 --> 01:29:56,600
It's called "MAIN DISH."

1803
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,739
(Kim Jun Seo, Chen Kai Wen)

1804
01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:05,240
- Kai Wen! - Kai Wen!

1805
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:09,380
(The audience goes wild as the team emerges out.)

1806
01:30:14,950 --> 01:30:17,149
Hao, what's on the menu today?

1807
01:30:17,150 --> 01:30:18,450
It's...

1808
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:20,019
- Get the appetizer out of the way. - Get the appetizer out of the way.

1809
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:21,889
- Taste our main dish. - Taste our main dish.

1810
01:30:21,890 --> 01:30:22,919
(The best performance, "MAIN DISH")

1811
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:24,089
(You're the best, Kang Min.)

1812
01:30:24,090 --> 01:30:25,590
- Hello. - Hello.

1813
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:28,830
I'm Yoo Kang Min with the spicy mala-flavored killing part.

1814
01:30:28,930 --> 01:30:30,029
(Kang Min)

1815
01:30:30,030 --> 01:30:32,500
I'm the lovely strawberry flavor, Li Zi Hao.

1816
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:34,569
(Li Zi Hao, the best-looking one)

1817
01:30:34,570 --> 01:30:37,039
I've gone from a mild flavor to a spicy, punchy flavor.

1818
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:38,199
I'm Kim Jun Seo.

1819
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:41,039
I'm the blood-flavored and loud vocalist. I'm Sun Heng Yu.

1820
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:45,950
- I can harmonize with any flavors. - So cute.

1821
01:30:46,050 --> 01:30:48,110
I'm a rice flavor. I'm Chen Kai Wen.

1822
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:55,219
I'm Hsu Ching Yu, the youngest-flavored dancer.

1823
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:56,789
(Our youngest is killing it.)

1824
01:30:56,790 --> 01:30:58,159
(Kim Jun Seo, Hsu Ching Yu)

1825
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:00,189
Li Zi Hao, you're always cheerful.

1826
01:31:00,190 --> 01:31:02,960
How did the preparation for this performance go for you?

1827
01:31:03,630 --> 01:31:05,769
I always want to remain cheerful.

1828
01:31:05,770 --> 01:31:08,629
But it wasn't easy this time because...

1829
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:09,900
(How did the practice go for Team "MAIN DISH?")

1830
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:12,099
(The day of the interim check)

1831
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:17,380
All right. Let's do a revenge match on Team "Chains."

1832
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:19,050
"MAIN DISH."

1833
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:23,220
(Team "MAIN DISH" steps out to take revenge on Team "Chains.")

1834
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:30,390
We'll factor in the limited time you had to practice.

1835
01:31:30,490 --> 01:31:33,289
- Okay. Understood. - So no pressure. Okay?

1836
01:31:33,290 --> 01:31:34,290
- We'll do our best. - Okay.

1837
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:35,999
Hit it.

1838
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,160
(What kind of performance will Team "MAIN DISH" put on?)

1839
01:31:43,970 --> 01:31:45,000
Come on.

1840
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:14,600
Come on.

1841
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:17,740
What? I'm impressed.

1842
01:32:18,970 --> 01:32:19,970
That was nice.

1843
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:22,070
- They're good. - Well done.

1844
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:25,680
Their energy drove the performance.

1845
01:32:27,450 --> 01:32:29,520
Here's what I liked about your performance.

1846
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:31,480
You guys are angry right now.

1847
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:35,219
There's an unusual sense of anger...

1848
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:37,219
- within you guys. - And they need that.

1849
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:38,619
I've never seen this before...

1850
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:39,990
- during the interim check. - During the interim check.

1851
01:32:40,590 --> 01:32:43,560
You're the angriest one in the group.

1852
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:46,930
- I can tell... - That's true, though.

1853
01:32:47,830 --> 01:32:49,600
He looked really angry. It was a bit scary.

1854
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:55,010
(His anger was quite effective!)

1855
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:56,540
- You could even break those chains. - Team "Chains," you lost.

1856
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:00,580
Team "Chains," you lost. Sorry.

1857
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:04,679
- Kang Min, you're doing well. - Thank you.

1858
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:05,720
- You're doing a good job. - Yes.

1859
01:33:06,090 --> 01:33:07,920
I guess I had residual anger which I didn't know about.

1860
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:10,490
I was reminded of the time I spent practicing to perform "Chains."

1861
01:33:10,990 --> 01:33:13,730
I also remembered my experience during that process.

1862
01:33:13,930 --> 01:33:16,360
I guess the Masters saw it too.

1863
01:33:16,830 --> 01:33:18,100
I was happy about it.

1864
01:33:19,170 --> 01:33:21,800
(At the All Star Camp)

1865
01:33:22,770 --> 01:33:24,069
- Oh, my. - Who is it?

1866
01:33:24,070 --> 01:33:25,199
Hello.

1867
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:26,210
(Kang Min visits Jun Min and Dong Gyu.)

1868
01:33:26,410 --> 01:33:27,470
How is it?

1869
01:33:28,910 --> 01:33:29,980
Of course, it's tough.

1870
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:34,679
Have you tried performing it powerfully from start to finish?

1871
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:36,580
No. We haven't finished it yet.

1872
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:39,519
As for the remaining parts from Verse Two and on,

1873
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:42,490
we had to learn the moves quite quickly.

1874
01:33:43,060 --> 01:33:45,090
They can't sing the song properly while dancing.

1875
01:33:45,190 --> 01:33:46,530
I'm the only one who can.

1876
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:48,790
How's Jun Il's singing? Is it good?

1877
01:33:48,890 --> 01:33:50,729
- Jun Il? He's good. - Yes.

1878
01:33:50,730 --> 01:33:51,829
- Really? - Yes.

1879
01:33:51,830 --> 01:33:53,630
He memorizes the moves really quickly.

1880
01:33:53,730 --> 01:33:56,800
I taught him the moves, and he memorized them right away.

1881
01:33:57,900 --> 01:33:59,240
What a relief, seriously.

1882
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:01,739
Heng Yu is in trouble.

1883
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:03,310
- I see. The choreography? - Yes.

1884
01:34:04,210 --> 01:34:07,050
But Heng Yu... Was it "Never?"

1885
01:34:07,310 --> 01:34:09,880
When he performed that song, his dancing was really good.

1886
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:13,219
(Sun Heng Yu showcased advanced dance skills...)

1887
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:15,790
(during the Class Placement Match.)

1888
01:34:16,090 --> 01:34:19,830
So he told me that he joined the show as a dancer.

1889
01:34:20,590 --> 01:34:22,600
But he's slow at memorizing the moves.

1890
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:28,200
(During the group training session of Team "MAIN DISH")

1891
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:36,280
(Sun Heng Yu continues to get the same move wrong.)

1892
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:38,440
Okay. Heng Yu.

1893
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:41,149
Something looked off.

1894
01:34:41,150 --> 01:34:43,850
It was you. You were off.

1895
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:46,090
It was me? I'm sorry.

1896
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:48,650
No need to apologize to me.

1897
01:34:50,390 --> 01:34:52,289
- Practicing should do it, right? - Totally.

1898
01:34:52,290 --> 01:34:54,730
- Practicing should help, right? - Yes.

1899
01:34:55,530 --> 01:34:56,559
Trust me on this.

1900
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:59,899
Once I memorize the moves, I know I can kill it.

1901
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:02,500
Gosh, I'm sure you'll memorize everything by tomorrow.

1902
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:04,170
I'm not sure about that.

1903
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:07,809
No, he told us to trust him.

1904
01:35:07,810 --> 01:35:09,539
I need at least three days.

1905
01:35:09,540 --> 01:35:11,309
- Three days? - See? Three days.

1906
01:35:11,310 --> 01:35:12,610
We'll have to perform by then.

1907
01:35:13,050 --> 01:35:14,349
Our rehearsal is around the corner.

1908
01:35:14,350 --> 01:35:15,350
(Team "MAIN DISH" faces an unexpected problem.)

1909
01:35:15,351 --> 01:35:16,380
I'm in trouble.

1910
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:20,089
Everyone, line up.

1911
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:21,350
Should we review Verse Two?

1912
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:24,619
Ching Yu, can you set the tone for this part?

1913
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:26,130
- Yes, Ching Yu has to do it. - Set the tone.

1914
01:35:27,930 --> 01:35:30,760
(Grooving with unique hip-hop steps)

1915
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:32,870
- Try to look annoying. - Right.

1916
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,430
I don't know how to explain this.

1917
01:35:38,670 --> 01:35:40,039
Since he's got talent,

1918
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:41,440
does he not want us to learn from him?

1919
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:42,780
No.

1920
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:45,880
You can't move your chest like this.

1921
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:48,250
(It should be like this.)

1922
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:50,650
- Heng Yu, come on. - Gosh, that's so wrong.

1923
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:52,349
I really don't know how to do it. Teach me.

1924
01:35:52,350 --> 01:35:53,890
- Please teach me. - I don't know.

1925
01:35:54,450 --> 01:35:56,720
I see. Ching Yu is completely jutting out his bottom.

1926
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:00,760
(Sun Heng Yu says that he gets it, but he's still the same.)

1927
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:05,730
You're overdoing it.

1928
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:07,530
To be honest,

1929
01:36:08,030 --> 01:36:09,870
you look like a giraffe with skinny legs.

1930
01:36:11,170 --> 01:36:13,240
- A newborn giraffe? - Exactly.

1931
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:16,680
(Sun Heng Yu gets the same part wrong.)

1932
01:36:17,010 --> 01:36:18,179
That was wrong.

1933
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:19,780
- What are you doing? - What's the matter?

1934
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:21,349
- He got it wrong. - The choreography?

1935
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:23,220
He's the only one doing the opposite.

1936
01:36:23,350 --> 01:36:25,479
What's confusing about it?

1937
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:26,820
It shouldn't be confusing.

1938
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:30,159
(After going over the choreography, they try it again.)

1939
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:32,120
(Sun Heng Yu keeps messing up the same section.)

1940
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:33,630
Something seems different.

1941
01:36:34,260 --> 01:36:35,730
Something seems different.

1942
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,229
Didn't someone get it wrong?

1943
01:36:37,230 --> 01:36:40,330
Yes, Heng Yu got it wrong.

1944
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:44,069
- My dream. - Change.

1945
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:45,169
Wait a minute.

1946
01:36:45,170 --> 01:36:47,110
Heng Yu, you have to do the same.

1947
01:36:48,370 --> 01:36:50,579
(Sun Heng Yu is staying still while everyone is moving their arms.)

1948
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:52,379
Don't we also do this in the back?

1949
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:53,880
- Right. - It's the same for everyone.

1950
01:36:54,310 --> 01:36:55,849
Please don't make mistakes.

1951
01:36:55,850 --> 01:36:57,080
I have to look at the overall formation.

1952
01:36:57,850 --> 01:37:00,050
Heng Yu is having a hard time keeping up.

1953
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:03,760
The progress is slower than I expected.

1954
01:37:04,490 --> 01:37:05,520
And...

1955
01:37:06,090 --> 01:37:08,759
I don't want to waste my first time...

1956
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:10,400
performing the killing part.

1957
01:37:11,260 --> 01:37:13,269
I'm much slower than everyone else...

1958
01:37:13,270 --> 01:37:15,700
at memorizing the choreography.

1959
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:17,600
I have a hard time memorizing it.

1960
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:20,870
I feel very angry at myself.

1961
01:37:21,470 --> 01:37:24,039
(Kang Min and Ching Yu began their 1-on-1 coaching for Sun Heng Yu.)

1962
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:25,080
Heng Yu, that's wrong.

1963
01:37:25,540 --> 01:37:29,479
One, two, and three, four, and five. And...

1964
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:30,750
You were slow at "and," right?

1965
01:37:34,090 --> 01:37:35,090
No.

1966
01:37:36,790 --> 01:37:38,119
- Is that right? - No.

1967
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:40,559
You need to be on the beat.

1968
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:41,590
Okay.

1969
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:43,730
Heng Yu, this is...

1970
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:47,470
We can't spend so much time on this.

1971
01:37:48,130 --> 01:37:50,570
I'm sorry. I'll practice two times more.

1972
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:58,340
(The private coaching for Sun Heng Yu continues.)

1973
01:37:58,510 --> 01:37:59,549
And.

1974
01:37:59,550 --> 01:38:00,550
(Kang Min is frustrated by Heng Yu who doesn't get the choreography.)

1975
01:38:00,551 --> 01:38:01,610
Think about the "and."

1976
01:38:01,910 --> 01:38:03,719
You aren't thinking.

1977
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:04,980
If you think about it, you'll get it right away.

1978
01:38:06,620 --> 01:38:10,020
I don't know. The other teams are probably more prepared.

1979
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:14,130
This isn't just about me doing well.

1980
01:38:15,530 --> 01:38:17,930
- Let's practice. - Let's do it quickly.

1981
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:19,800
Do it again. Don't make mistakes.

1982
01:38:20,170 --> 01:38:21,630
Let's start from "main dish."

1983
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:25,670
(On the day of the rehearsal)

1984
01:38:25,870 --> 01:38:26,939
Please get ready.

1985
01:38:26,940 --> 01:38:27,969
- Okay. - Okay.

1986
01:38:27,970 --> 01:38:29,040
(Team "MAIN DISH" gets ready for the rehearsal.)

1987
01:38:32,910 --> 01:38:36,219
Sun Heng Yu doesn't seem to be doing well.

1988
01:38:36,220 --> 01:38:37,350
Does he have a sore throat?

1989
01:38:40,220 --> 01:38:42,820
(The rehearsal for Team "MAIN DISH" starts.)

1990
01:38:47,390 --> 01:38:50,560
(Full of fierceness)

1991
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:02,680
(Among the fierce members)

1992
01:39:04,910 --> 01:39:07,850
(Sun Heng Yu's face looks stiff.)

1993
01:39:09,650 --> 01:39:10,650
Go for it.

1994
01:39:12,350 --> 01:39:18,720
(The rehearsal for Team "MAIN DISH" is over.)

1995
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:20,529
Gosh, that was strong.

1996
01:39:20,530 --> 01:39:22,289
- Cut. - That was crazy.

1997
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:23,360
Thank you.

1998
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:25,130
- That was... - Thank you.

1999
01:39:26,230 --> 01:39:28,200
Heng Yu is completely out of it.

2000
01:39:33,210 --> 01:39:36,040
You all did so great. That was great.

2001
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:38,040
- Thank you. - You did an amazing job.

2002
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:42,850
Heng Yu, are you not feeling well today? How are you?

2003
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:44,820
He's having a hard time focusing.

2004
01:39:47,350 --> 01:39:49,250
It's quite difficult for me.

2005
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:53,760
What's difficult?

2006
01:39:54,430 --> 01:39:55,489
It's okay.

2007
01:39:55,490 --> 01:39:59,869
(He has a hard time talking.)

2008
01:39:59,870 --> 01:40:01,930
I'm the only one messing it up.

2009
01:40:05,140 --> 01:40:07,910
- Breathe. - It's okay.

2010
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:11,080
I practiced every night, but I still can't do it.

2011
01:40:12,810 --> 01:40:14,450
I'm angry at myself.

2012
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:17,580
It happens.

2013
01:40:22,250 --> 01:40:23,260
Heng Yu.

2014
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:24,620
Yes?

2015
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:28,160
Get a grip.

2016
01:40:29,030 --> 01:40:30,060
Okay.

2017
01:40:33,070 --> 01:40:35,470
- You have to focus. - Okay.

2018
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:37,299
Some things can't be helped.

2019
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:39,199
Everyone else is...

2020
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:41,509
fired up and prepared.

2021
01:40:41,510 --> 01:40:44,839
You shouldn't let your depressed vibe...

2022
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:46,710
affect other members.

2023
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:50,949
I really liked it.

2024
01:40:50,950 --> 01:40:53,320
You have good energy, and you look prepared.

2025
01:40:53,550 --> 01:40:55,589
You don't have time for this.

2026
01:40:55,590 --> 01:40:57,489
Instead, try to concentrate.

2027
01:40:57,490 --> 01:41:00,430
You should show yourself on stage.

2028
01:41:01,030 --> 01:41:02,160
- Okay. - Yes.

2029
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:04,760
This is the semi-final round.

2030
01:41:04,930 --> 01:41:09,469
You can't ask for sympathy at this stage.

2031
01:41:09,470 --> 01:41:10,670
It's the semi-finals.

2032
01:41:12,470 --> 01:41:15,110
(After the rehearsal)

2033
01:41:16,010 --> 01:41:17,880
It's okay, Heng Yu.

2034
01:41:21,810 --> 01:41:25,119
Don't stress out about it.

2035
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:27,220
Everything will be better tomorrow.

2036
01:41:27,350 --> 01:41:29,759
I've been telling you. You just need to prepare yourself.

2037
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:32,059
Showcasing your skills on stage is more important.

2038
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:33,960
Don't feel pressured. It's okay.

2039
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:36,360
Seriously.

2040
01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:38,830
- Heng Yu. - Yes?

2041
01:41:39,700 --> 01:41:41,530
- Heng Yu. - Yes?

2042
01:41:42,270 --> 01:41:45,540
I know that you messed up the notes and the timing.

2043
01:41:51,810 --> 01:41:52,910
You can't do that.

2044
01:41:56,850 --> 01:41:58,380
What do you want to say exactly?

2045
01:42:01,450 --> 01:42:03,590
What do you want to say to me exactly?

2046
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:05,719
(Kang Min is angry at Heng Yu for lowering the team's morale.)

2047
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:06,930
You shouldn't have done that.

2048
01:42:09,390 --> 01:42:10,700
- That's enough. - Move away.

2049
01:42:17,670 --> 01:42:21,040
(The team's atmosphere gets tense.)

2050
01:42:22,010 --> 01:42:25,640
(Sun Heng Yu bursts into tears again.)

2051
01:42:29,250 --> 01:42:34,350
(The conflict gets deeper for Team "MAIN DISH.")

2052
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:38,960
Does he even see us as a team right now?

2053
01:42:39,190 --> 01:42:40,490
Does he see me as part of the team?

2054
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:43,760
Jun Seo, am I wrong?

2055
01:42:46,630 --> 01:42:47,999
(Sighing)

2056
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,670
The thing I was dreading came true.

2057
01:42:49,970 --> 01:42:51,270
I can't take it.

2058
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,210
His attitude didn't fit the vibe of our song.

2059
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:58,910
That's what made me angry.

2060
01:43:02,550 --> 01:43:06,389
(After the rehearsal, Kang Min and Heng Yu are...)

2061
01:43:06,390 --> 01:43:10,690
(lost in their own thoughts.)

2062
01:43:14,860 --> 01:43:17,760
To be honest, the upcoming performance is...

2063
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:20,870
the most important one for me.

2064
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:27,910
I have to look at the overall formation.

2065
01:43:28,610 --> 01:43:30,780
If I don't get recognized...

2066
01:43:32,010 --> 01:43:33,580
even after getting this chance,

2067
01:43:35,050 --> 01:43:37,420
I would suffer a lot.

2068
01:43:40,790 --> 01:43:42,490
What do you want to say exactly?

2069
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:45,589
I thought so many times that I could drop...

2070
01:43:45,590 --> 01:43:47,030
further in the rankings.

2071
01:43:47,630 --> 01:43:50,030
That's what made me feel even more anxious.

2072
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:53,730
I can understand both of them.

2073
01:43:55,900 --> 01:43:58,400
Our only goal is performing well.

2074
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:02,770
Everyone wants to move up to the final round...

2075
01:44:02,980 --> 01:44:04,240
and debut.

2076
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:09,480
(Team "MAIN DISH" gathers in one room.)

2077
01:44:09,481 --> 01:44:10,679
It's our first time together in a room.

2078
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:11,749
That's true.

2079
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:13,119
We were well prepared.

2080
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:14,549
We prepared a lot.

2081
01:44:14,550 --> 01:44:16,719
After watching our rehearsal,

2082
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:19,060
I didn't think that it was bad.

2083
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:21,030
Take a good rest tonight.

2084
01:44:21,730 --> 01:44:25,399
Throw away everything on your mind before tomorrow.

2085
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:27,129
Concentrate only on the performance.

2086
01:44:27,130 --> 01:44:28,900
- That sounds good. - That's amazing.

2087
01:44:28,970 --> 01:44:31,400
- Let's go, - Let's go, Li Zi Hao.

2088
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:34,339
- How do you feel? - Let's just go for it.

2089
01:44:34,340 --> 01:44:35,870
- Let's go for it. - We can do it.

2090
01:44:35,940 --> 01:44:38,580
- Team "MAIN DISH." - Hey.

2091
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:41,379
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

2092
01:44:41,380 --> 01:44:44,319
- "MAIN DISH." - Let's go, brother.

2093
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:45,350
(How will their performance turn out?)

2094
01:44:45,580 --> 01:44:47,250
- Let's go. - Let's hurry and...

2095
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:53,330
(Amazing Performance, "MAIN DISH," I was born to watch this.)

2096
01:44:55,730 --> 01:44:57,000
(Jun Lee Jeong)

2097
01:45:00,670 --> 01:45:02,399
I'm determined not to lose.

2098
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:04,400
I want to turn everything around.

2099
01:45:05,140 --> 01:45:07,569
I hope that everyone can see...

2100
01:45:07,570 --> 01:45:08,810
how determined we are.

2101
01:45:09,910 --> 01:45:12,140
I don't want to ruin the performance no matter what.

2102
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:18,820
Will they show "MAIN DISH..."

2103
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:21,820
as a dish at a Michelin-starred restaurant?

2104
01:45:21,890 --> 01:45:24,320
- I hope that they do well. - They have to let themselves go.

2105
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:30,860
("MAIN DISH")

2106
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:51,720
(Kang Min)

2107
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:01,560
What's that?

2108
01:46:30,590 --> 01:46:31,619
(Kang Min, good luck.)

2109
01:46:31,620 --> 01:46:32,620
(Team "MAIN DISH" gives the best performance.)

2110
01:46:34,030 --> 01:46:35,260
Come on. Bring it on.

2111
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:42,370
(Kim Jun Seo)

2112
01:46:54,950 --> 01:46:55,950
That's it!

2113
01:47:28,650 --> 01:47:29,680
(Kim Jun Seo)

2114
01:47:35,420 --> 01:47:36,760
Kang Min is really good.

2115
01:48:10,590 --> 01:48:11,620
(Jun Seo, you deserve a pat.)

2116
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:30,280
Hey!

2117
01:48:36,950 --> 01:48:37,950
(Li Zi Hao, Chung Sang Hyeon, Yoo Kang Min)

2118
01:49:40,510 --> 01:49:42,309
(The birth of the new boy group with the romantic and energetic vibe)

2119
01:49:42,310 --> 01:49:43,980
(You can watch the full version on YouTube and Mnet Plus.)

2120

2121
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:48,849
(Hsu Ching Yu)

2122
01:49:48,850 --> 01:49:50,219
(Kim Jun Seo)

2123
01:49:50,220 --> 01:49:51,719
(Chen Kai Wen)

2124
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:53,189
(Sun Heng Yu)

2125
01:49:53,190 --> 01:49:55,160
(Yoo Kang Min)

2126
01:49:55,790 --> 01:49:56,800
Gosh, Kang Min.

2127
01:49:57,130 --> 01:49:59,299
Kang Min must've practiced with determination.

2128
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:00,500
My goodness.

2129
01:50:00,730 --> 01:50:03,169
Given the energy they've shown, they have a chance of placing first.

2130
01:50:03,170 --> 01:50:04,600
I agree.

2131
01:50:09,370 --> 01:50:11,139
Kang Min is insane.

2132
01:50:11,140 --> 01:50:12,439
It's best to show your spirit.

2133
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:13,779
He took all of my spirit.

2134
01:50:13,780 --> 01:50:14,880
He has it.

2135
01:50:14,950 --> 01:50:16,879
- Yoo Kang Min has it. - Definitely.

2136
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:18,320
Gosh, they're collapsing on the stage.

2137
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:25,719
- No wonder they collapsed. - It was intense.

2138
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:27,059
They poured everything into the performance.

2139
01:50:27,060 --> 01:50:28,959
What? The way they collapse looks pretty cool.

2140
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:30,030
Shall we do it as well?

2141
01:50:31,530 --> 01:50:34,570
Seriously, I'm so happy.

2142
01:50:36,170 --> 01:50:38,270
It seemed like a rough path, but...

2143
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:39,640
I can say with confidence...

2144
01:50:39,700 --> 01:50:41,510
that I was very happy.

2145
01:50:42,540 --> 01:50:45,310
I did my absolute best for today's performance.

2146
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:48,580
I showed everything I wanted to show.

2147
01:50:49,510 --> 01:50:52,920
I completed the performance well without any regrets.

2148
01:50:53,690 --> 01:50:55,590
(Debut Concept Battle, "MAIN DISH")

2149
01:50:56,690 --> 01:50:57,890
The time has come.

2150
01:50:58,160 --> 01:50:59,160
(It's time to see the result.)

2151
01:50:59,161 --> 01:51:00,760
This is more nerve-racking than performing.

2152
01:51:01,390 --> 01:51:02,560
Everyone did well.

2153
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:05,159
Seriously, I can't do this.

2154
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:06,200
Hold on.

2155
01:51:06,530 --> 01:51:08,129
If you don't have high expectations,

2156
01:51:08,130 --> 01:51:09,430
you won't be disappointed.

2157
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:12,800
I don't know.

2158
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:14,240
Placing first in the team?

2159
01:51:14,241 --> 01:51:17,380
Seriously. Honestly speaking, I can't be certain about it.

2160
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:20,010
I think Kang Min's score will be very high.

2161
01:51:20,850 --> 01:51:22,850
All the members had a great balance.

2162
01:51:23,010 --> 01:51:25,150
- My goodness. - My goodness.

2163
01:51:26,050 --> 01:51:30,290
(Why is everyone surprised by the result for Team "MAIN DISH?")

2164
01:51:30,490 --> 01:51:31,559
(Main vocalist Sun Heng Yu: 1,370 points)

2165
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:32,589
(Sub vocalist 1 Kim Jun Seo: 790 points)

2166
01:51:32,590 --> 01:51:33,590
(Sub vocalist 2 Yoo Kang Min: 1,930 points)

2167
01:51:33,591 --> 01:51:34,629
(Main rapper Li Zi Hao: 1,440 points)

2168
01:51:34,630 --> 01:51:35,759
(Sub rapper 1 Chen Kai Wen: 1,880 points)

2169
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:36,859
(Sub rapper 2 Hsu Ching Yu: 1,350 points)

2170
01:51:36,860 --> 01:51:39,560
(Yoo Kang Min scored the highest in Team "MAIN DISH.")

2171
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:42,030
- My goodness. - My goodness.

2172
01:51:42,170 --> 01:51:44,170
- My goodness. - My goodness.

2173
01:51:44,270 --> 01:51:46,470
Let's go, Kang Min!

2174
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:47,739
I was in a daze.

2175
01:51:47,740 --> 01:51:49,610
Seriously, it was something I had never imagined.

2176
01:51:50,210 --> 01:51:51,909
I felt like I had finally received recognition,

2177
01:51:51,910 --> 01:51:53,110
so I was very happy.

2178
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:55,979
To be honest, the benefit...

2179
01:51:55,980 --> 01:51:57,480
wasn't important to me anymore.

2180
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:01,050
It was 100 times better than your performance of "Breathe."

2181
01:52:01,850 --> 01:52:03,020
Your performance of "Breathe."

2182
01:52:03,990 --> 01:52:05,619
Did you say it was four times better?

2183
01:52:05,620 --> 01:52:07,430
- Kang Min is smiling now. - Where did number four come from?

2184
01:52:07,860 --> 01:52:10,899
(Chen Kai Wen placed 2nd in the team.)

2185
01:52:10,900 --> 01:52:12,259
Gosh, 1,880 points.

2186
01:52:12,260 --> 01:52:13,570
Is that score even possible?

2187
01:52:14,770 --> 01:52:16,070
How is it so high?

2188
01:52:17,470 --> 01:52:18,840
Well done.

2189
01:52:18,900 --> 01:52:21,839
The machine must be broken.

2190
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:24,040
- It must be broken. - "The machine must be broken."

2191
01:52:24,140 --> 01:52:25,680
The score is too high. It makes no sense.

2192
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:27,549
I hope we won't experience...

2193
01:52:27,550 --> 01:52:30,180
what happened in the second mission.

2194
01:52:30,820 --> 01:52:32,179
I hope we'll win.

2195
01:52:32,180 --> 01:52:34,449
Instead of failing or losing,

2196
01:52:34,450 --> 01:52:36,820
I hope we'll win.

2197
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:38,959
Let's fight on!

2198
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:40,460
Team "MAIN DISH," let's go! Let's place first!

2199
01:52:43,060 --> 01:52:44,800
I'll introduce the next performance.

2200
01:52:45,230 --> 01:52:46,330
This song...

2201
01:52:46,530 --> 01:52:48,830
expresses the attraction toward each other...

2202
01:52:48,930 --> 01:52:50,500
in a tantalizing...

2203
01:52:50,740 --> 01:52:52,800
and delicate manner.

2204
01:52:53,140 --> 01:52:54,509
(Leo, Geon Woo, Sang Won)

2205
01:52:54,510 --> 01:52:55,810
(Today's main character is Lee Leo.)

2206
01:52:56,340 --> 01:52:57,340
It's "Chains."

01:53:00,180 --> 01:53:01,349
(Zhang Jia Hao, Zhou An Xin)

2208
01:53:01,350 --> 01:53:02,880
(Lee Sang Won, I heart you.)

2209
01:53:02,950 --> 01:53:04,180
(Today's main character is Lee Leo.)

2210
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:06,319
Let's go up the stage prettily in a single file.

2211
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:08,520
- Okay. Yes. - Okay.

2212
01:53:08,690 --> 01:53:10,389
One, two, three.

2213
01:53:10,390 --> 01:53:11,760
- Let's fight on. - Let's fight on.

2214
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:14,160
Team "Chains," please come on out.

2215
01:53:17,300 --> 01:53:18,559
(Lee Sang Won, I heart you.)

2216
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:19,800
(Lee Sang Won, I love you. Geon Woo, good luck!)

2217
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:24,000
(Team "Chains" enters amidst loud cheers.)

2218
01:53:24,340 --> 01:53:25,900
They're so handsome.

2219
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:33,509
To Team "Chains," get tied up.

2220
01:53:33,510 --> 01:53:34,550
(Lee Sang Won, I heart you.)

2221
01:53:35,910 --> 01:53:37,450
Feel it.

2222
01:53:37,750 --> 01:53:38,780
(Zhang Jia Hao, Zhou An Xin, Lee Leo)

2223
01:53:39,380 --> 01:53:40,850
- Get wrapped up. - Get wrapped up.

2224
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:44,420
Oh, my gosh. Their visuals are crazy.

2225
01:53:44,590 --> 01:53:45,590
Two, three.

2226
01:53:45,591 --> 01:53:48,490
- Hello, we're Team Love Is. - Hello, we're Team Love Is.

2227
01:53:49,630 --> 01:53:50,799
- Love Is. - They did it.

2228

(Jun Lee Jeong)

2229
01:53:52,060 --> 01:53:53,400
Hello, I'm the one...

2230
01:53:53,830 --> 01:53:56,940
who'll get tied up in your gaze.

2231
01:53:57,100 --> 01:53:58,570
(Lee Sang Won)

2232
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:00,740
I'm the member with the killing part, Lee Sang Won.

2233
01:54:03,010 --> 01:54:04,639
I'm the one who wants to feel your love...

2234
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:06,810
with my entire body.

2235
01:54:07,180 --> 01:54:08,279
I'm Lee Jeong.

2236
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:10,719
I'm the one who'll tie you guys up with my cute acts,

2237
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:11,980
Zhou An Xin.

2238
01:54:12,950 --> 01:54:14,150
Check An Xin out.

2239
01:54:14,420 --> 01:54:15,750
Relax.

2240
01:54:16,150 --> 01:54:18,960
I'm the one who'll wrap you up with my charming voice.

2241
01:54:19,060 --> 01:54:20,489
I'm the main vocalist, Leo.

2242
01:54:20,490 --> 01:54:21,960
(Leo, Sang Won)

2243
01:54:22,030 --> 01:54:25,159
Hello, I'm the one who's tied up in your love.

2244
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:26,259
(Kim Geon Woo, I believe in you!)

2245
01:54:26,260 --> 01:54:27,999
I'm Geon Woo. I'm in your care.

2246
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,170
(Geon Woo)

2247
01:54:29,270 --> 01:54:32,300
I'm the one who'll lock you guys up by my side forever,

2248
01:54:32,500 --> 01:54:34,210
Zhang Jia Hao of Team Love Is.

2249
01:54:36,910 --> 01:54:39,979
The way he dances doesn't match his personality.

2250
01:54:39,980 --> 01:54:41,079
I know.

2251
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:42,379
I think that makes him charming.

2252
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:45,080
He suddenly transforms when the performance begins.

2253
01:54:46,850 --> 01:54:49,890
The member who has the killing part, Lee Sang Won.

2254
01:54:50,260 --> 01:54:52,919
Did you have any difficulties while preparing...

2255
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:54,430
for the killing part?

2256
01:54:54,730 --> 01:54:57,730
(Lee Sang Won)

2257
01:54:59,300 --> 01:55:02,330
(How was practice for Team "Chains?")

2258
01:55:02,670 --> 01:55:04,599
Team "Chains" members...

2259
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:06,399
have impressive rankings.

2260
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:08,169
- The rankings are impressive. - Yes.

2261
01:55:08,170 --> 01:55:09,939
This is almost a debut group.

2262
01:55:09,940 --> 01:55:11,640
(1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 12th, 19th)

2263
01:55:11,740 --> 01:55:13,880
- Only my ranking isn't high. - What?

2264
01:55:14,050 --> 01:55:15,750
Only my ranking...

2265
01:55:16,950 --> 01:55:20,390
The masters' favorite, Zhang Jia Hao.

2266
01:55:20,550 --> 01:55:21,720
That's right.

2267
01:55:22,390 --> 01:55:23,490
Thank you.

2268
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:27,389
Whenever we watch Zhang Jia Hao perform,

2269
01:55:27,390 --> 01:55:28,690
(Zhang Jia Hao has always received the masters' compliments.)

2270
01:55:29,130 --> 01:55:31,399
Kani and Hyolin...

2271
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:33,400
keep praising him. They love him very much.

2272
01:55:34,070 --> 01:55:35,969
But your ranking keeps falling, right? You must be disappointed.

2273
01:55:35,970 --> 01:55:36,970
Yes.

2274
01:55:37,270 --> 01:55:40,440
I noticed that you also got the smallest part.

2275
01:55:40,940 --> 01:55:44,110
(Zhang Jia Hao got the smallest part that was about 8 seconds long.)

2276
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:45,840
It's disappointing,

2277
01:55:45,910 --> 01:55:47,549
but I'll do my best...

2278
01:55:47,550 --> 01:55:50,050
and perform for eight seconds...

2279
01:55:50,380 --> 01:55:52,880
as if it was a killing part.

2280
01:55:53,890 --> 01:55:55,590
He even has a great mindset.

2281
01:55:55,990 --> 01:55:57,790
- He's cool. - Yes.

2282
01:55:57,920 --> 01:55:59,920
- Who is the killing part? - Sang Won.

2283
01:56:00,220 --> 01:56:01,830
- Again? - Yes, again.

2284
01:56:02,260 --> 01:56:03,859
Sang Won is always the killing part.

2285
01:56:03,860 --> 01:56:05,300
It's his third time doing the killing part.

2286
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:06,400
You're right.

2287
01:56:07,070 --> 01:56:10,669
Actually, at first, I wasn't going to do it.

2288
01:56:10,670 --> 01:56:11,700
- Yes. - Okay.

2289
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:13,400
But I kept regretting it,

2290
01:56:13,540 --> 01:56:15,639
and I thought there must be a reason...

2291
01:56:15,640 --> 01:56:17,640
why my fans chose this song for me.

2292
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:20,649
So, I went for it, and my teammates voted for me.

2293
01:56:20,650 --> 01:56:21,650
I see.

2294
01:56:22,450 --> 01:56:23,680
Nicely said.

2295
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:24,979
I'm really looking forward to this.

2296
01:56:24,980 --> 01:56:26,880
I'm looking forward to seeing this team the most.

2297
01:56:26,980 --> 01:56:28,250
All of their members are talented.

2298
01:56:28,550 --> 01:56:30,289
(They're about to start the interim check of Team "Chains.")

2299
01:56:30,290 --> 01:56:31,820
What is that?

2300
01:56:32,890 --> 01:56:34,030
They tied him up.

2301
01:56:34,190 --> 01:56:35,459
- What is that? - They tied him up.

2302
01:56:35,460 --> 01:56:37,299
(Team "Chains" prepared a performance using a chain.)

2303
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:39,460
- They tied his hands together. - The concept is impressive.

2304
01:56:39,700 --> 01:56:40,769
(Thinking deeply)

2305
01:56:40,770 --> 01:56:41,930
You know, Koo Young...

2306
01:56:43,270 --> 01:56:45,040
What kind of videos does he watch?

2307
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:46,399
(Back Koo Young, the choreographer of "Chains")

2308
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:47,470
(Simply smiling)

2309
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:49,540
(The interim check of Team "Chains" begins.)

2310
01:56:49,870 --> 01:56:51,710
- They have a clear concept. - It's already impressive.

2311
01:57:03,620 --> 01:57:07,289
You and me, the cold moonlight

2312
01:57:07,290 --> 01:57:10,500
Go deeper, shoot them

2313
01:57:13,330 --> 01:57:15,900
Deeper, Love is chain

2314
01:57:17,070 --> 01:57:19,500
Your shade

2315
01:57:19,770 --> 01:57:22,539
I will only be tied up by you

2316
01:57:22,540 --> 01:57:25,340
Not faking it, faking it A white moon shines down

2317
01:57:25,740 --> 01:57:27,109
I go crazy for you

2318
01:57:27,110 --> 01:57:28,910
A white moon shines down

2319
01:57:29,180 --> 01:57:30,849
I go crazy for you

2320
01:57:30,850 --> 01:57:32,319
Chain

2321
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:33,320
That's insane.

2322
01:57:34,420 --> 01:57:36,050
Chain

2323
01:57:38,120 --> 01:57:39,690
Chain

2324
01:57:40,060 --> 01:57:41,559
Okay, cut!

2325
01:57:41,560 --> 01:57:44,059
(The interim check for Team "Chains" is over.)

2326
01:57:44,060 --> 01:57:46,230
(What will the Masters' say for their review?)

2327
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:48,000
Zhang Jia Hao.

2328
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:50,540
(Zhang Jia Hao)

2329
01:57:51,740 --> 01:57:53,740
You're so visible, no matter where you are.

2330
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:57,510
For real. In my eyes, you were just so visible. Only you.

2331
01:57:57,780 --> 01:57:59,440
- Thank you. - You were very visible.

2332
01:58:02,680 --> 01:58:04,249
Hao didn't have very many parts. He must be sad.

2333
01:58:04,250 --> 01:58:05,349
Hao is so good.

2334
01:58:05,350 --> 01:58:06,779
- This song suits him so well. - Yes.

2335
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:08,489
Hao was originally a candidate for the killing part.

2336
01:58:08,490 --> 01:58:09,790
Oh, really?

2337
01:58:10,050 --> 01:58:12,560
I'm really sorry, all of a sudden, but could we...

2338
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:15,790
I'm really sorry, all of a sudden, but could we...

2339
01:58:16,130 --> 01:58:19,230
Who were the candidates for the killing part again?

2340
01:58:19,630 --> 01:58:22,329
(Who were the candidates for the killing part again?)

2341
01:58:22,330 --> 01:58:23,429
(Zhang Jia Hao, Zhou An Xin, and Lee Sang Won)

2342
01:58:23,430 --> 01:58:25,369
Sang Won, An Xin, and Jia Hao?

2343
01:58:25,370 --> 01:58:26,770
(The three of them tried out for the killing part when dividing parts.)

2344
01:58:26,940 --> 01:58:28,770
Could we see it once more...

2345
01:58:29,270 --> 01:58:30,580
like when you tried out for the killing part?

2346
01:58:30,740 --> 01:58:32,680
Could we see it once more...

2347
01:58:33,010 --> 01:58:34,380
like when you tried out for the killing part?

2348
01:58:35,110 --> 01:58:36,380
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

2349
01:58:36,450 --> 01:58:37,450
Okay.

2350
01:58:37,451 --> 01:58:39,220
(The Masters' sudden request)

2351
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:45,859
Sang Won seemed a little weak just now.

2352
01:58:45,860 --> 01:58:47,060
Right, he was too weak.

2353
01:58:47,330 --> 01:58:48,960
- It wasn't enough, was it? - No.

2354
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:55,330
Let's go.

2355
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:57,000
Sang Won must feel bad about this.

2356
01:58:58,970 --> 01:59:00,540
I think it hurt my pride.

2357
01:59:00,710 --> 01:59:02,170
I was just mad.

2358
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:06,980
(Zhang Jia Hao's killing part performance)

2359
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:25,600
He's so good. His dance is totally different.

2360
01:59:32,770 --> 01:59:33,840
My gosh.

2361
01:59:36,510 --> 01:59:38,680
- Next. - An Xin.

2362
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:44,880
Go, Zhou An Xin!

2363
01:59:44,980 --> 01:59:46,849
(He declares defeat even before he starts.)

2364
01:59:46,850 --> 01:59:48,120
Are you not going to do it at all?

2365
01:59:49,420 --> 01:59:52,619
(I won't. I can't.)

2366
01:59:52,620 --> 01:59:54,129
Hey, just get up there!

2367
01:59:54,130 --> 01:59:55,160
You have to do it!

2368
01:59:55,830 --> 01:59:57,529
- Why? Won't you do it? - I won't do it.

2369
01:59:57,530 --> 01:59:58,559
- Come on. - It's okay.

2370
01:59:58,560 --> 01:59:59,860
I won't do the killing part.

2371
02:00:00,630 --> 02:00:02,070
Okay. Let's see Sang Won, then.

2372
02:00:03,900 --> 02:00:07,610
To be honest, I felt like my skills were being doubted.

2373
02:00:08,570 --> 02:00:10,370
It really hurt my pride.

2374
02:00:14,450 --> 02:00:17,079
- All right. Let's go! - Let's go!

2375
02:00:17,080 --> 02:00:21,420
(Lee Sang Won is more serious than ever.)

2376
02:00:32,660 --> 02:00:34,000
He uses his facial expressions well.

2377
02:00:36,270 --> 02:00:38,940
I love how Sang Won uses his facial expressions.

2378
02:00:43,170 --> 02:00:44,310
Yes.

2379
02:00:45,110 --> 02:00:46,140
Yes.

2380
02:00:51,980 --> 02:00:54,419
- Why is he so sexy? - I know, he's sexy.

2381
02:00:54,420 --> 02:00:55,449
Gosh, so sexy.

2382
02:00:55,450 --> 02:00:57,190
Sang Won sure is good at expressing the song's colors.

2383
02:00:57,860 --> 02:00:59,160
- They're totally different. - Yes, they're different.

2384
02:00:59,390 --> 02:01:01,060
- They have different vibes. - Okay, got it.

2385
02:01:01,430 --> 02:01:02,890
I think it's a matter of preference.

2386
02:01:04,460 --> 02:01:05,859
So, you're both good.

2387
02:01:05,860 --> 02:01:07,229
- Yes, they are. - Right.

2388
02:01:07,230 --> 02:01:09,830
You're both... Actually, this isn't something...

2389
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:13,069
- that we can decide for you. - Of course not.

2390
02:01:13,070 --> 02:01:14,070
Absolutely.

2391
02:01:14,071 --> 02:01:16,539
Actually, I'm just going to say this honestly.

2392
02:01:16,540 --> 02:01:18,880
I expected way more in the killing part.

2393
02:01:19,540 --> 02:01:20,849
If you want to do the killing part again,

2394
02:01:20,850 --> 02:01:22,510
I need you to kill it a little bit more.

2395
02:01:23,550 --> 02:01:26,579
This time, I was also worried about the killing part myself.

2396
02:01:26,580 --> 02:01:27,920
That made me mad.

2397
02:01:28,820 --> 02:01:30,920
It really hurt my pride too.

2398
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:42,000
It made me want to do better out of spite.

2399
02:01:42,470 --> 02:01:45,070
Hao would also be perfect in the killing part,

2400
02:01:45,240 --> 02:01:48,510
but I wanted to hear that it was better because Sang Won did it.

2401
02:01:49,140 --> 02:01:50,680
I thought I should really try hard to the death...

2402
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:55,710
and truly prove myself this time.

2403
02:01:56,810 --> 02:01:59,520
(Practice room of Team "Chains")

2404
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:03,320
So deeper, Love is Chain

2405
02:02:03,550 --> 02:02:04,689
Again.

2406
02:02:04,690 --> 02:02:07,729
(Lee Sang Won starts practicing alone after the interim check.)

2407
02:02:07,730 --> 02:02:08,760
Okay.

2408
02:02:09,460 --> 02:02:12,430
So deeper, Love is Chain

2409
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:16,670
I thought that I should really try hard to the death this time.

2410
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:18,170
(Sweating bullets)

2411
02:02:19,200 --> 02:02:21,110
Since this is my third time doing the killing part,

2412
02:02:21,370 --> 02:02:24,279
I will show everyone why I have to do the killing part...

2413
02:02:24,280 --> 02:02:25,680
in "Chains," no matter what.

2414
02:02:28,510 --> 02:02:30,109
(All Star Camp)

2415
02:02:30,110 --> 02:02:31,549
(Lee Sang Won comes back after practicing late into the night.)

2416
02:02:31,550 --> 02:02:33,180
(His roommate, Zhou An Xin, wakes up from his sleep.)

2417
02:02:33,380 --> 02:02:35,490
- You're back. - Yes, you went to bed early.

2418
02:02:37,320 --> 02:02:38,619
(Sighing)

2419
02:02:38,620 --> 02:02:39,760
I'm so tired.

2420
02:02:44,130 --> 02:02:47,570
(Zhou An Xin just hugs Lee Sang Won without saying a word.)

2421
02:02:48,230 --> 02:02:50,940
Sang Won, don't worry too much about the Masters' review.

2422
02:02:53,340 --> 02:02:55,769
(Lee Sang Won)

2423
02:02:55,770 --> 02:02:57,610
I'm more worried about Hao.

2424
02:02:59,380 --> 02:03:01,480
Hao is so good and really impressive.

2425
02:03:01,710 --> 02:03:04,350
I think he'd do the killing part so well.

2426
02:03:06,220 --> 02:03:07,950
I felt sorry for some reason.

2427
02:03:08,120 --> 02:03:09,190
Right.

2428
02:03:12,020 --> 02:03:14,060
I kept worrying about Hao.

2429
02:03:14,660 --> 02:03:18,560
Actually, this performance isn't just for me to shine by myself.

2430
02:03:19,930 --> 02:03:23,500
(Sang Won goes to see the leader, Jun Lee Jeong, in his room.)

2431
02:03:24,170 --> 02:03:26,670
Hao keeps weighing on my mind.

2432
02:03:27,710 --> 02:03:28,870
I thought about it,

2433
02:03:29,070 --> 02:03:31,240
and Hao doesn't have very many parts.

2434
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:34,509
(It kept weighing on Lee Sang Won's mind...)

2435
02:03:34,510 --> 02:03:37,980
(that Zhang Jia Hao's parts were only 8 seconds long.)

2436
02:03:38,550 --> 02:03:42,150
I was wondering if he and I could switch parts.

2437
02:03:42,390 --> 02:03:43,650
Well...

2438
02:03:44,620 --> 02:03:47,630
It's your part, so I'll go with your decision.

2439
02:03:49,130 --> 02:03:52,030
(A night of contemplation passes by.)

2440
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:55,100
Sang Won has the killing part,

2441
02:03:55,470 --> 02:03:57,430
so if Hao could take the third sub-vocalist part,

2442
02:03:58,100 --> 02:04:00,769
I think we could structure the song...

2443
02:04:00,770 --> 02:04:03,070
to show off each of our charms.

2444
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:04,910
That's why I want to switch parts.

2445
02:04:05,310 --> 02:04:06,379
Okay.

2446
02:04:06,380 --> 02:04:08,949
(Thanks to Sang Won's opinion, )

2447
02:04:08,950 --> 02:04:11,219
(Sang Won and Jia Hao will switch parts.)

2448
02:04:11,220 --> 02:04:14,520
I was grateful that he switched parts with me.

2449
02:04:14,850 --> 02:04:20,120
I will try that much harder to give a good performance.

2450
02:04:21,390 --> 02:04:24,330
So, this part, you go... Two, and...

2451
02:04:25,130 --> 02:04:27,400
- When you do this, it's one, and... - One.

2452
02:04:27,900 --> 02:04:29,430
Shines

2453
02:04:30,100 --> 02:04:32,200
- Yes, I think that's good. - Okay.

2454
02:04:34,940 --> 02:04:39,179
(They learn the choreography according to their switched parts.)

2455
02:04:39,180 --> 02:04:40,180
Okay.

2456
02:04:40,181 --> 02:04:41,649
- You can do it however you want. - Okay.

2457
02:04:41,650 --> 02:04:42,850
You can do it your own way.

2458
02:04:43,180 --> 02:04:44,620
Hao, this part...

2459
02:04:44,980 --> 02:04:47,050
(Sang Won asks for Jia Hao's help for the killing part.)

2460
02:04:47,750 --> 02:04:50,649
(Jia Hao demonstrates.)

2461
02:04:50,650 --> 02:04:51,719
Oh, this...

2462
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:52,919
(Flustered)

2463
02:04:52,920 --> 02:04:54,760
- What? Which part? - How do you do that?

2464
02:04:54,890 --> 02:04:56,130
- What? - You're literally like a snake.

2465
02:04:57,460 --> 02:04:59,300
- First, you stop. - Stop.

2466
02:05:00,730 --> 02:05:02,300
Then, move slowly.

2467
02:05:03,230 --> 02:05:04,240
(Inhaling)

2468
02:05:05,270 --> 02:05:06,270
(Inhaling)

2469
02:05:06,271 --> 02:05:07,609
- That tastes better. - It's tasty.

2470
02:05:07,610 --> 02:05:09,770
It's so tasty. I know that too.

2471
02:05:10,310 --> 02:05:12,280
It's like eating at a Michelin-star restaurant.

2472
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:16,049
- Yes. So, one and... - One and...

2473
02:05:16,050 --> 02:05:17,079
That's it.

2474
02:05:17,080 --> 02:05:19,319
(Team "Chains" perfects their performance...)

2475
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:21,249
(as they rely on one another.)

2476
02:05:21,250 --> 02:05:22,850
Since my teammates trusted in me,

2477
02:05:23,050 --> 02:05:25,519
I tried hard so that I could repay them...

2478
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:27,489
as the killing part.

2479
02:05:27,490 --> 02:05:29,460
- Again. - This part? Okay.

2480
02:05:30,130 --> 02:05:33,700
You and me, the cold moonlight

2481
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:37,270
(The day of the rehearsal)

2482
02:05:37,770 --> 02:05:40,570
(Team "Chains" prepares for the rehearsal.)

2483
02:05:42,940 --> 02:05:45,840
I see that you've had some changes in parts, right?

2484
02:05:45,980 --> 02:05:47,040
- Yes. - Yes.

2485
02:05:48,010 --> 02:05:49,150
I'm looking forward to it.

2486
02:05:49,980 --> 02:05:52,180
(The rehearsal begins amid the Masters' expectations.)

2487
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:01,030
(Right. This is it.)

2488
02:06:13,240 --> 02:06:14,470
Yes!

2489
02:06:18,580 --> 02:06:20,179
(The rehearsal ends with applause.)

2490
02:06:20,180 --> 02:06:22,850
- Goodness. - That was sexy.

2491
02:06:23,710 --> 02:06:24,750
Killing part.

2492
02:06:27,320 --> 02:06:29,550
You really suit the killing part.

2493
02:06:29,990 --> 02:06:30,990
Thank you.

2494
02:06:34,990 --> 02:06:38,960
Sang Won performing the killing part today...

2495
02:06:39,500 --> 02:06:41,230
seemed like Sang Won we had never seen before.

2496
02:06:41,330 --> 02:06:42,330
I was very shocked.

2497
02:06:42,331 --> 02:06:45,100
I once again thought you really had...

2498
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:46,200
a great potential to grow.

2499
02:06:46,300 --> 02:06:47,370
As for Zhang Jia Hao,

2500
02:06:48,710 --> 02:06:52,279
you're this.

2501
02:06:52,280 --> 02:06:54,349
You're really cool. You did so well.

2502
02:06:54,350 --> 02:06:56,180
It was so nice...

2503
02:06:56,650 --> 02:06:58,720
that I wanted to watch your performance quickly.

2504
02:06:59,150 --> 02:07:01,419
At the end, what matters is how much...

2505
02:07:01,420 --> 02:07:03,720
of the impression lingers when you go back home.

2506
02:07:05,290 --> 02:07:07,120
I think I would remember this performance.

2507
02:07:07,860 --> 02:07:09,160
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2508
02:07:11,530 --> 02:07:12,800
It felt good.

2509
02:07:15,370 --> 02:07:18,670
I had a hard time preparing for "Chains."

2510
02:07:20,840 --> 02:07:23,970
But I didn't give up. I endured and practiced.

2511
02:07:24,810 --> 02:07:27,850
I think that was how we could create this performance.

2512
02:07:29,180 --> 02:07:32,349
I could show myself on stage...

2513
02:07:32,350 --> 02:07:34,550
through this song.

2514
02:07:35,750 --> 02:07:39,060
I was really happy and thankful.

2515
02:07:39,820 --> 02:07:43,590
Star Creators, we will perform a performance...

2516
02:07:44,290 --> 02:07:45,560
that won't disappoint you.

2517
02:07:47,230 --> 02:07:49,370
- Will it start? - They should nail it.

2518
02:07:50,700 --> 02:07:52,570
Sexy!

2519
02:07:53,170 --> 02:07:55,239
Didn't they say, "You're sexy, JUSTHIS?"

2520
02:07:55,240 --> 02:07:56,740
What? JUSTHIS?

2521
02:07:57,110 --> 02:07:59,010
I think they said, "JUSTHIS is sexy!"

2522
02:07:59,910 --> 02:08:02,710
Let's rewind that.

2523
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:04,579
Let's see "Chains."

2524
02:08:04,580 --> 02:08:06,780
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2525
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:09,290
Can Yun Seo really watch this?

2526
02:08:09,390 --> 02:08:11,659
- No. - Close your eyes, Yun Seo.

2527
02:08:11,660 --> 02:08:12,789
Close your eyes.

2528
02:08:12,790 --> 02:08:14,260
(No, I won't.)

2529
02:08:50,790 --> 02:08:51,800
(Leo)

2530
02:08:58,240 --> 02:08:59,240
(Lee Sang Won)

2531
02:09:08,650 --> 02:09:09,850
(Lee Jeong)

2532
02:09:17,390 --> 02:09:19,820
It looks like they'll really set the stage on fire.

2533
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:27,830
(Jun Lee Jeong will be debuting.)

2534
02:09:41,480 --> 02:09:42,949
Hold on. What was that introduction?

2535
02:09:42,950 --> 02:09:44,350
The introduction was crazy.

2536
02:09:56,030 --> 02:09:57,059
(Lee Sang Won)

2537
02:09:57,060 --> 02:09:58,100
(Jun Lee Jeong)

2538
02:10:01,170 --> 02:10:05,140
("Chains")

2539
02:10:09,210 --> 02:10:10,210
(Lee Sang Won)

2540
02:10:10,211 --> 02:10:11,710
(Jun Lee Jeong)

2541
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:32,800
(Sang Won)

2542
02:10:37,330 --> 02:10:38,540
Look at that line.

2543
02:10:44,780 --> 02:10:46,040
That's so sexy.

2544
02:10:49,180 --> 02:10:50,180
(Jun Lee Jeong)

2545
02:10:57,220 --> 02:10:58,220
(Jun Lee Jeong will be debuting.)

2546
02:10:58,620 --> 02:10:59,620
(Leo)

2547
02:11:02,990 --> 02:11:03,990
Yes!

2548
02:11:09,730 --> 02:11:10,730
(Leo)

2549
02:11:16,210 --> 02:11:17,210
(Lee Jeong)

2550
02:11:34,060 --> 02:11:35,060
(Jun Lee Jeong will be debuting.)

2551
02:11:36,760 --> 02:11:37,760
(I heart you, Lee Sang Won.)

2552
02:11:44,700 --> 02:11:45,700
(Lee Sang Won)

2553
02:11:51,610 --> 02:11:52,610
(Chuei Li Yu)

2554
02:12:27,510 --> 02:12:28,510
(Zhou An Xin, cat ears)

2555
02:12:28,510 --> 02:12:29,510
(Leo)

2556
02:12:58,140 --> 02:13:00,580
Sang Won is determined today.

2557
02:13:48,660 --> 02:13:50,059
(Kim Geon Woo)

2558
02:13:50,060 --> 02:13:51,399
(Sang Won, heart)

2559
02:13:51,400 --> 02:13:53,059
(Lee Leo)

2560
02:13:53,060 --> 02:13:54,629
(Jun Lee Jeong)

2561
02:13:54,630 --> 02:13:56,369
(Zhou An Xin)

2562
02:13:56,370 --> 02:13:57,999
(Kim Geon Woo)

2563
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,699
(Zhang Jia Hao)

2564
02:13:59,700 --> 02:14:03,940
(Killing part: Lee Sang Won)

2565
02:14:04,140 --> 02:14:06,339
(The birth of the new boy group with the romantic and energetic vibe)

2566
02:14:06,340 --> 02:14:08,510
(You can watch the full version on YouTube and Mnet Plus.)

2567
02:14:13,080 --> 02:14:14,549
That was so sexy.

2568
02:14:14,550 --> 02:14:16,190
It's so crazy.

2569
02:14:16,590 --> 02:14:19,619
Could you turn the air conditioner down a little?

2570
02:14:19,620 --> 02:14:21,889
It's so warm because of the performance.

2571
02:14:21,890 --> 02:14:22,960
Make it stronger.

2572
02:14:23,930 --> 02:14:26,230
When "Love Shot" by EXO first came out,

2573
02:14:26,730 --> 02:14:29,129
I thought, "Why is that so sexy?" That's what it feels like.

2574
02:14:29,130 --> 02:14:30,970
- It has that feeling. - It just rushed to me.

2575
02:14:31,070 --> 02:14:33,570
It's like they're openly saying, "We're sexy,"

2576
02:14:33,670 --> 02:14:35,939
"so look at us and scream!"

2577
02:14:35,940 --> 02:14:39,309
Sang Won was born to take the killing part.

2578
02:14:39,310 --> 02:14:40,310
That's right.

2579
02:14:40,311 --> 02:14:43,479
Sang Won always gets told at the interim checks...

2580
02:14:43,480 --> 02:14:46,449
or the rehearsals...

2581
02:14:46,450 --> 02:14:47,680
that something is lacking overall.

2582
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:51,619
But in the end, he performs the killing part like that on stage.

2583
02:14:51,620 --> 02:14:52,620
That's right.

2584
02:14:52,621 --> 02:14:54,560
- It shows so well on stage. - So well.

2585
02:14:55,060 --> 02:14:57,060
I think...

2586
02:14:57,330 --> 02:14:59,399
Zhang Jia Hao's choreography was incredible.

2587
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:00,899
- I don't think... - That captivated me.

2588
02:15:00,900 --> 02:15:02,700
- anyone can dance like that. - I know.

2589
02:15:03,100 --> 02:15:05,170
I was so surprised when he leaned to one side and used his pelvis.

2590
02:15:05,200 --> 02:15:08,310
He put his hand in his top and gave a thrust. Yes, that part.

2591
02:15:10,040 --> 02:15:12,109
Take it out. Come on.

2592
02:15:12,110 --> 02:15:14,440
- He was good. He was pretty good. - Seriously.

2593
02:15:14,580 --> 02:15:15,980
It was a hit.

2594
02:15:16,110 --> 02:15:17,910
They were on par with Team "MAIN DISH."

2595
02:15:19,820 --> 02:15:20,820
Hao, what did you say?

2596
02:15:20,821 --> 02:15:22,120
They were on par with Team "MAIN DISH."

2597
02:15:22,150 --> 02:15:23,690
- You're right. - Yes.

2598
02:15:24,190 --> 02:15:26,519
No. I think we did better.

2599
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:28,760
I think Team "Sugar HIGH" did a bit better.

2600
02:15:30,460 --> 02:15:32,860
- He's confident. - Seriously.

2601
02:15:35,470 --> 02:15:37,400
The fact that I could prepare and show a performance like this...

2602
02:15:37,530 --> 02:15:39,869
with these members and this song...

2603
02:15:39,870 --> 02:15:41,510
made me very thankful.

2604
02:15:42,570 --> 02:15:44,069
- Well done. - Well done.

2605
02:15:44,070 --> 02:15:45,609
- Well done. - Well done.

2606
02:15:45,610 --> 02:15:46,640
You guys did an amazing job.

2607
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:47,910
We went through a lot.

2608
02:15:48,510 --> 02:15:49,709
- My heart feels light. - I know.

2609
02:15:49,710 --> 02:15:51,850
- Everyone did well. - I'm seriously proud of you guys.

2610
02:15:51,950 --> 02:15:53,850
- I have no regrets. - Let's go.

2611
02:15:53,950 --> 02:15:55,119
- Yes. - You have no regrets...

2612
02:15:55,120 --> 02:15:56,289
- since our stage was high-quality. - Okay.

2613
02:15:56,290 --> 02:15:58,120
Let's have a group hug instead of doing a cheer.

2614
02:15:59,420 --> 02:16:01,259
- No, don't sit down. - No.

2615
02:16:01,260 --> 02:16:03,260
- Let's have a group hug. - A group hug.

2616
02:16:03,460 --> 02:16:06,260
- You worked hard. - You worked hard. Well done.

2617
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:07,830
Seriously.

2618
02:16:10,030 --> 02:16:13,140
(The result will be announced now.)

2619
02:16:14,040 --> 02:16:15,309
(Debut Concept Battle, "Chains")

2620
02:16:15,310 --> 02:16:16,540
Will I be the first one?

2621
02:16:17,340 --> 02:16:18,409
Let's go.

2622
02:16:18,410 --> 02:16:20,140
I still have PTSD.

2623
02:16:20,840 --> 02:16:22,280
I still have it bad.

2624
02:16:23,280 --> 02:16:24,379
(Lee Leo: 910 points)

2625
02:16:24,380 --> 02:16:27,320
(Everyone was surprised by Lee Leo's score.)

2626
02:16:30,090 --> 02:16:31,819
- I still have PTSD. - It'll be very high this time.

2627
02:16:31,820 --> 02:16:33,659
I got good reactions last time as well.

2628
02:16:33,660 --> 02:16:34,790
However, I placed last.

2629
02:16:35,090 --> 02:16:36,529
Leo, let's move up.

2630
02:16:36,530 --> 02:16:37,729
Don't say that.

2631
02:16:37,730 --> 02:16:38,999
I just need to score higher than 500 points.

2632
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,160
- Come on. - It's best not to expect anything.

2633
02:16:41,930 --> 02:16:43,600
It was definitely nerve-racking.

2634
02:16:43,930 --> 02:16:46,370
Participants who were behind me kept saying,

2635
02:16:46,400 --> 02:16:48,410
"Your score will be high this time."

2636
02:16:48,440 --> 02:16:50,170
I thought, "Will it be high this time?"

2637
02:16:51,310 --> 02:16:52,439
Right now...

2638
02:16:52,440 --> 02:16:54,380
(Main vocalist Lee Leo: 1,140 points)

2639
02:16:54,440 --> 02:16:56,449
(Main vocalist Lee Leo: 1,140 points)

2640
02:16:56,450 --> 02:16:57,710
You did well.

2641
02:16:58,620 --> 02:16:59,750
All right.

2642
02:16:59,820 --> 02:17:01,850
- It's higher than 500 points. - It's higher than 500 points.

2643
02:17:02,650 --> 02:17:05,190
I had hoped for a better result, so I'm a bit disappointed.

2644
02:17:06,490 --> 02:17:07,519
(Sub vocalist 1 Zhou An Xin: 1,310 points)

2645
02:17:07,520 --> 02:17:08,729
(Sub vocalist 2 Kim Geon Woo: 1,670 points)

2646
02:17:08,730 --> 02:17:10,860
(Zhou An Xin gets 1,310 points. Kim Geon Woo gets 1,670 points.)

2647
02:17:18,270 --> 02:17:19,470
Well done.

2648
02:17:22,670 --> 02:17:24,370
(It's time for Sang Won's score to be revealed.)

2649
02:17:24,870 --> 02:17:26,439
Will Sang Won get 2,500 points?

2650
02:17:26,440 --> 02:17:27,839
The cheers were unrivaled.

2651
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:29,310
I'm sure he'll get 2,000 points.

2652
02:17:32,950 --> 02:17:35,649
(Debut Concept Battle, "Chains")

2653

(Sub rapper Lee Sang Won: 1,820 points)

2654
02:17:39,260 --> 02:17:41,790
(Lee Sang Won gets 1,820 points.)

2655
02:17:46,330 --> 02:17:47,330
He deserves it.

2656
02:17:47,830 --> 02:17:48,900
Okay.

2657
02:17:50,630 --> 02:17:52,269
(Main rapper Jun Lee Jeong: 1,210 points)

2658
02:17:52,270 --> 02:17:54,039
(Jun Lee Jeong gets 1,210 points.)

2659
02:17:54,040 --> 02:17:55,440
- Okay. - All right.

2660
02:17:55,840 --> 02:17:58,240
- Hao's score... - Hao.

2661
02:17:58,580 --> 02:18:00,039
Doing this was unfair.

2662
02:18:00,040 --> 02:18:02,150
- This alone got him 1,000 points. - Doing this...

2663
02:18:02,650 --> 02:18:03,850
I'm in trouble.

2664
02:18:04,350 --> 02:18:06,579
Even when I got good reactions,

2665
02:18:06,580 --> 02:18:11,020
I didn't receive a high score.

2666
02:18:11,320 --> 02:18:12,620
So, I was worried.

2667
02:18:13,860 --> 02:18:15,060
Personally,

2668
02:18:15,330 --> 02:18:16,660
I want his score to be higher than mine.

2669
02:18:18,300 --> 02:18:19,300
Seriously.

2670
02:18:25,870 --> 02:18:27,039
(Debut Concept Battle, "Chains")

2671
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:28,100

(Lee Sang Won congratulates Zhang Jia Hao.)

2675
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:39,320
- Well done. - Thank you for your hard work.

2676
02:18:40,120 --> 02:18:42,150
To be honest, I want to tell Hao...

2677
02:18:42,190 --> 02:18:45,689
that I wanted to give him a half of the killing part.

2678
02:18:45,690 --> 02:18:48,859
He did incredibly well.

2679
02:18:48,860 --> 02:18:52,760
I also want to tell other members that I'm thankful for them...

2680
02:18:53,600 --> 02:18:55,429
for allowing me...

2681
02:18:55,430 --> 02:18:57,530
to perform with them.

2682
02:18:59,600 --> 02:19:01,639
- You guys worked hard. - Everyone has a high score.

2683
02:19:01,640 --> 02:19:03,009
- Let's go. - It was very cool.

2684
02:19:03,010 --> 02:19:04,439
- Well done. - Thank you for your hard work.

2685
02:19:04,440 --> 02:19:06,510
- I got more than 1,000 points. - That's right.

2686
02:19:12,720 --> 02:19:14,279
The semi-final mission...

2687
02:19:14,280 --> 02:19:17,450
of BOYS II PLANET has come to an end.

2688
02:19:17,850 --> 02:19:19,989
The result of the semi-final mission...

2689
02:19:19,990 --> 02:19:22,790
has determined the teams' scores.

2690
02:19:23,890 --> 02:19:26,630
Even if you received a disappointing score,

2691
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:29,500
being on the team that places first...

2692
02:19:29,670 --> 02:19:33,400
will give you a team benefit of 150,000 points.

2693
02:19:35,770 --> 02:19:38,809
Also, who will take...

2694
02:19:38,810 --> 02:19:40,910
the individual benefit in addition?

2695
02:19:42,980 --> 02:19:44,249
(Yoo Kang Min: 1,930 points)

2696
02:19:44,250 --> 02:19:46,779
(1st place participant in the 1st place team...)

2701
02:19:57,160 --> 02:19:58,230
Hundred and fifty thousand points.

2702
02:19:58,330 --> 02:19:59,730
I really want the benefit.

2703
02:20:00,230 --> 02:20:02,229
When Kang Min and I competed during the Survivor Announcement,

2704
02:20:02,230 --> 02:20:04,330
I would've won if I had 150,000 points.

2705
02:20:04,730 --> 02:20:05,739
You're right.

2706
02:20:05,740 --> 02:20:08,170
In eighth place is Yoo Kang Min.

2707
02:20:08,270 --> 02:20:11,069
(Due to the difference of 45,748 points, )

2708
02:20:11,070 --> 02:20:13,880
(Masato placed 9th.)

2709
02:20:14,140 --> 02:20:16,349
I really need that gap...

2710
02:20:16,350 --> 02:20:17,510
right now.

2711
02:20:17,910 --> 02:20:18,980
Please.

2712
02:20:20,120 --> 02:20:22,190
Which team's score will be revealed first?

2713
02:20:23,990 --> 02:20:25,620
It's Team "MAIN DISH."

2714
02:20:26,060 --> 02:20:27,190
Our team will go first.

2715
02:20:28,190 --> 02:20:29,729
(If Team "MAIN DISH" places 1st, Yoo Kang Min will receive...)

2716
02:20:29,730 --> 02:20:31,260
(the benefit of 300,000 points.)

2717
02:20:31,490 --> 02:20:32,799
(Redistributing the parts in Team "Chains")

2718
02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:37,900
(Yoo Kang Min was let go from Team "Chains.")

2719
02:20:39,340 --> 02:20:44,270
(But he got the killing part in Team "MAIN DISH.")

2720
02:20:45,740 --> 02:20:47,580
(Yoo Kang Min: 1,930 points)

2721
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:52,079
(Will he be able to receive the benefit of 300,000 points?)

2722
02:20:52,080 --> 02:20:53,220
Personally speaking,

2723
02:20:54,920 --> 02:20:56,250
I really want it.

2724
02:21:00,290 --> 02:21:02,760
The final score is 440 points.

2725
02:21:03,560 --> 02:21:04,889
- I don't know. - I don't know.

2726
02:21:04,890 --> 02:21:06,030
I hope it's a high score.

2727
02:21:06,760 --> 02:21:08,800
We won't know until we see the next team's score.

2728
02:21:09,030 --> 02:21:11,300
Now comes the result for Team "Sugar HIGH."

2729
02:21:12,140 --> 02:21:15,370
(What will be the final score for Team "Sugar HIGH?")

2730
02:21:16,310 --> 02:21:18,509
(Team "Sugar HIGH" gave...)

2731
02:21:18,510 --> 02:21:21,310
(a successful performance with the refreshing concept.)

2732
02:21:24,180 --> 02:21:27,920
I want to perform for the final before going home.

2733
02:21:31,990 --> 02:21:34,860
The final score is 540 points.

2734
02:21:35,630 --> 02:21:37,959
(The final score for Team "Sugar High," 540 points)

2735
02:21:37,960 --> 02:21:39,100
Over 500 points?

2736
02:21:39,460 --> 02:21:40,500
That's so high.

2737
02:21:41,430 --> 02:21:43,199
Oh, my gosh.

2738
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:44,870
(Team "Sugar HIGH" scored higher than Team "MAIN DISH.")

2739
02:21:44,900 --> 02:21:45,970
It's too bad.

2740
02:21:46,670 --> 02:21:48,910
(Now, 2 teams remain.)

2741
02:21:55,310 --> 02:21:58,279
(Team "Lucky MACHO" left a strong impression...)

2742
02:21:58,280 --> 02:22:00,450
(with a charismatic performance.)

2743
02:22:08,320 --> 02:22:11,229
(Team "Chains" showed a stylish performance...)

2744
02:22:11,230 --> 02:22:13,530
(with controlled sexiness.)

2745
02:22:18,770 --> 02:22:21,539
(Will there be the 1st place team among the 2 remaining teams?)

2746
02:22:21,540 --> 02:22:23,209
(Will Team "Sugar HIGH" remain in 1st place?)

2747
02:22:23,210 --> 02:22:26,680
I thought Team "Chains" would place first.

2748
02:22:26,810 --> 02:22:29,850
The audience's reactions were... As soon as I heard them,

2749
02:22:30,810 --> 02:22:32,550
I thought, "Team 'Chains' will place first."

2750
02:22:32,950 --> 02:22:35,950
(The participants are expecting Team "Chains" to place 1st.)

2751
02:22:38,350 --> 02:22:40,490
Here comes the result for Team "Lucky MACHO."

2752
02:22:41,260 --> 02:22:42,530
Please.

2753
02:22:45,360 --> 02:22:46,360
Please.

2754
02:22:54,470 --> 02:22:56,810
The final score is 670 points.

2755
02:22:57,470 --> 02:22:58,570
It's very high.

2756
02:22:59,540 --> 02:23:03,480
Only the result for Team "Chains" remains.

2757
02:23:04,780 --> 02:23:06,620
Please, dear Lord.

2758
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:11,920
(Which team will take 1st place and acquire 150,000 points?)

2759
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:15,730
I'm more worried than excited.

2760
02:23:16,160 --> 02:23:17,290
When I performed "Queencard..."

2761
02:23:18,660 --> 02:23:21,760
(Lee Leo performed "Queencard" for Class Switch Position Battle.)

2762
02:23:23,030 --> 02:23:24,530
The reactions were very nice.

2763
02:23:25,270 --> 02:23:27,470
The final score is 1,020 points.

2764
02:23:27,870 --> 02:23:32,240
(Team "Queencard" placed last in the vocal position.)

2765
02:23:33,880 --> 02:23:35,350
I don't know what will happen.

2766
02:23:36,680 --> 02:23:37,709
(The 19th place, Zhang Jia Hao, might not advance to the final...)

2767
02:23:37,710 --> 02:23:38,749
(without the benefit.)

2768
02:23:38,750 --> 02:23:42,920
Team "Lucky MACHO" had a score that was much higher,

2769
02:23:42,950 --> 02:23:44,290
so I was very worried.

2770
02:23:45,150 --> 02:23:47,590
Here comes the result for Team "Chains."

2771
02:23:52,860 --> 02:23:58,370

(Debut Concept Battle)

2774
02:24:10,250 --> 02:24:12,779
(What were the final results that surprised everyone?)

2775
02:24:12,780 --> 02:24:14,520
Gosh, how many points?

2776
02:24:16,320 --> 02:24:19,360
("Chains," 1,110 points, 1st place)

2777
02:24:25,160 --> 02:24:27,530
The final score is 1,110 points.

2778
02:24:27,900 --> 02:24:28,970
My gosh.

2779
02:24:29,700 --> 02:24:32,070
The final 1st-place team is Team "Chains."

2780
02:24:32,970 --> 02:24:35,339
Team "Chains," you have won the benefit...

2781
02:24:35,340 --> 02:24:37,740
of 150,000 points. Congratulations, all of you.

2782
02:24:38,040 --> 02:24:40,179
- Thank you. - Congratulations!

2783

(All members of Team "Chains" receive 150,000 points as benefits.)

2784
02:24:42,410 --> 02:24:45,009
- You're going to "M Countdown!" - You're going to "M Countdown."

2785

(Benefit for Team "Chains": Appearance on "M Countdown")

2786

2788

(Team benefit: 150,000 points, Personal benefit: 150,000 points)

2789
02:24:50,420 --> 02:24:53,120
Since appearing on BOYS II PLANET, this was...

2790
02:24:54,620 --> 02:24:56,390
the moment I had the highest level of dopamine, I guess?

2791
02:24:56,730 --> 02:24:58,330
That's what this moment was like.

2792
02:24:58,560 --> 02:24:59,660
It's a shame.

2793
02:25:02,570 --> 02:25:05,640
However, that's not the last of the benefits.

2794
02:25:06,200 --> 02:25:07,870

Hey, it's soda.
