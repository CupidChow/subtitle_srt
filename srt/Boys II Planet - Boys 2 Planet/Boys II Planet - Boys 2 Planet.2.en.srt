00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,570
Debut.

00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,740
The journey of debuting.

6
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,810
And here...

7
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,520
are the boys who desperately want to debut.

8
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,660
The world-scale debut project...

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,330
for the top boy group in the K-pop scene, BOYS II PLANET.

10
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,170
The boys' challenge to reach the top...

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,570
will begin now.

12
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,710
BOYS II PLANET...

13
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,410
has a very interesting universe.

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,880
The show will begin...

15
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,720
not as one planet...

16
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,790
but two.

17
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,060
PLANET K.

18
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,960
- BOYS II PLANET K. - BOYS II PLANET K.

19
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,230
PLANET C.

20
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,770
- BOYS II PLANET C. - BOYS II PLANET C.

21
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,810
Only the boys who proved their worth...

22
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,450
through fierce competition in their respective planets...

23
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,780
will meet on one planet, BOYS II PLANET,

24
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,820
and acquire qualifications to continue competing for the debut.

25
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,820
PLANET K and PLANET C.

26
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,860
Between the two planets,

27
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,160
you're watching the beginning of PLANET C.

28

(BOYS II PLANET K airs every Thursday at 9:20pm.)

29
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,280
From now on, they have only one purpose.

30
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,520
It's to become the best and realise the dream of debuting.

31
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,930
The journey of BOYS II PLANET C has begun.

32
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,669
To reach this point,

33
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,770
the boys will go through many things.

34
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,710
Competition.

35
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,240
Despair. Friendship.

36
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,450
Hope.

37
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,780
At the end of the journey, who will reach the top...

38
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,050
and realise their dream of debuting?

39
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,230
Their fate depends on you guys,

40
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,200
the fans around the world who are also called Star Creators.

41
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,130
Star Creators,

42
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,770
you're the sun to the boys.

43
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,270
Your intense energy is the only thing...

44
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,340
that can make them debut.

45
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,950
Star Creators,

46
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,320
who among these boys will ignite your passion?

47
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,190
- Boys! - Max the power!

48
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,800

We're members of the Chinese Dragon Taekwondo Demonstration Team.

90

"Never give up."

103
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,930
(Okay!)

104
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,870
Is it spelled with "nea?"

105
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,200
Is it "neaver?"

106
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,400
(Let's stay out of this.)

107
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,740
Isn't "never" spelled n, a, v, e, r?

108
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,009
(Is it an "a" or an "e?")

109
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:48,450
(The "never" dispute is never ending.)

(Surprised)

121
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,600
That's so cool.

122
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,169
It was overwhelming.

123
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,710
It's as tall as the pyramid.

124
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,990
Those are the eight debut seats.

125
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,350
I already want to sit in the number one spot.

126
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,550
(He's full of passion.)

127
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,920
- Let's go. - Oh, my gosh.

128
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,120
It's so cool.

129
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,290

"Your survival or elimination is determined solely by your rank."

134
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,940
We'll be divided into three classes.

00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,380
All Star, Two Star, and One Star.

136
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,710
(The seats have been divided into 3 classes.)

137
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,220

How many do we stick on?

141
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,020
All of them. All Star.

142
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:44,160
I stuck on all stars as I'm confident.

143
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,369
Half of the participants...

144
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,800
will recognise me.

145
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,240

(Lin Qui Nan, THE 8 of SEVENTEEN)

151
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,550
Why did you quit taekwondo and decide to become an actor?

152
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,490
I won all the awards I could possibly win.

153
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,260
From now on, my dream is to become an idol.

154
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,130
I'm here to make my debut.

155

156
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,960
(How exciting.)

157
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,730
Right now, I'm invincible.

(Is he going to take the first place's seat straightaway?)

159

(The one who has taken the throne)

161
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,980
Yes.

162
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,879
The first place's seat is the best.

163
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,380
It's like I've become the king.

164
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,089
(Watch as the king dances.)

165
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,019
(Dancing)

166
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,120
(What is wrong with him?)

167
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,160
(Team Ningbo has taken the top 4 spots.)

168
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,929
But this is...

169
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,070
- We're standing out too much. - Exactly.

170
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,439
Let's show them what we've got.

171
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,799
We'll get a chance to prove ourselves.

172
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,669
Yes. The others must acknowledge us.

173
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,740
You're right.

174
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,749
(Team Ningbo humbly takes the seats starting from 5th place.)

175
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,910
When is the next team coming?

176
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,849
(That very team is here!)

177
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,150
Team Beijing.

178
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,720
They have four members.

179
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,020
I'm excited.

180
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,460
I want us to compete against each other.

181
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,459
(Facing Team Ningbo for the first time)

182
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,360
(What is Team Beijing like?)

183
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,260
Hello.

184
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,200
(Feeling awkward)

185
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,650
(Caught off guard by Team Beijing's unexpected cuteness, )

186
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,570
(he ended up greeting them back.)

187
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,170
(How adorable.)

188
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,286
(The deadly cuteness killed his competitive edge.)

189
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,110
(How did Team Beijing make a good impression?)

190
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,580
It must be our cuteness.

191
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,620
I'm the cute type.

192
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,320
I can catch people's eyes.

193
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,420
(Jia Yang has captured everyone's heart.)

194
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,390
Sun Jia Yang? He's cute.

195
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,330
(The team's class is determined by...)

196
00:10:55,331 --> 00:10:56,336
(the other participants' first-impression votes.)

197
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,360
(Surprised)

198
00:10:57,361 --> 00:10:58,400
Look at that.

199
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,769
The team's class is determined by...

200
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,650
the other participants' first-impression votes.

201
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,540
(First-impression votes?)

202
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,070
Do we evaluate them?

203
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,840
We must get a lot of votes.

204
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,849
(A catchy first impression is a must when it comes to idols!)

205
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,149
(First impression rank voting)

206
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,649
(Participants vote for teams based on first impressions.)

207
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,456
(The entire team receives the same rank based on the final results.)

208
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,549
(What is the first impression voting?)

209
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,890
An idol's looks and first impression are important.

210
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,860
(Voting sincerely)

211
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,630
I don't think our first impression was bad.

212
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,600
I think we'll get an All Star.

213
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,370
(The classes will now be announced.)

214
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,809
(He's smiling?)

215
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,686
(What is Team Beijing's first impression class?)

216
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,510
(Team Beijing gets No Star.)

217
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,080
(A shocking result that makes them question their own eyes)

218
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,379
(This must be a dream.)

219
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,380
Zero stars?

220
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,680
This is like a public execution.

221
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,919
At first, I thought the screen was broken.

222
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,020
Something wasn't right.

223
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,960
It was far from what I had imagined.

224
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,190
No Star.

225
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,500
(Sighing)

226
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:09,969
Because our makeup and clothes looked cute,

227
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,370
we must've looked like pushovers.

228
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,510
We look like kindergarteners.

229
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,210
I will compete against you with my charms.

230
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,379
(I can do well, right?)

231
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,809
(Which team will enter next?)

232
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,120
Chuanyu.

233
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,849
- Chuanyu. - Chuanyu.

234
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,450
(What kind of participants will appear?)

235
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,819
(Tall)

236
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,719
Oh, my gosh.

237
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,129
Why are they all so tall?

238
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,429
(Experienced: Chuanyu)

239
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,629
(Experienced: THE LINE STAR)

240
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,930
He's tall.

241
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,329
(Experienced: TEN Entertainment)

242
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,929
(Tall participants keep coming in.)

243
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:43,029
(Experienced: LIANCHENG Entertainment)

244
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,800
(Looking intense)

245
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,770
He's not giving off a friendly vibe.

246
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,839
He looks scary.

247
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,850
(Who said that?)

248
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,549
(Backing down)

249
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,790
I can't wait to see who's next.

250
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,990
(Shocked)

251
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,090
(Just how long are his legs?)

252
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,200
(A stunning proportion, even from a distance)

253
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,300
(Tall)

254
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,069
He's super tall.

255
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,939
What do kids these days eat to grow that tall?

256
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,099
I know, right?

257
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,369
His legs are longer than my lifespan.

258
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,370
(Laughing)

259
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:24,280
(Zhang Shi Yi is debating where to sit.)

260
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,440
(He's really tall.)

261
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,010
(What?)

262
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,720
(Zhang Shi Yi walks past Team Beijing.)

263
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,789
(Amazed)

264
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,059
(Why next to us?)

265
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,260
You're really tall.

266
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,260
(Hurry up and sit down.)

267
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,329
I have a feeling the next person is with a company.

268
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,330
TOP CLASS?

269
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:48,399
YUE HUA?

270
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,470
WAKEONE?

271
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,240
(Experienced)

272
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,069
- It's Chromosome. - Chromosome.

273
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,686
(What is Chromosome everyone is so hyped about?)

274
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,140
(LAY ZHANG's company)

275
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,340
(The former EXO member who successfully became a solo artist)

276
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,880
(Chromosome, the Chinese company established by LAY ZHANG)

277
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,550
The competition just got harder.

278
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,179
(Interested)

279
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,420
(Focused)

280
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,920
There's only him.

281
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,360
Gosh, look at his proportion.

282
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,330
He's got a nice proportion. I'm jealous.

283
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:23,430
I'm Chen Kai Wen, a trainee at Chromosome Entertainment.

284
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,069
You can tell he's got skills.

285
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,370
A Chromosome Entertainment trainee is top-tier.

286
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,269
I'm good at everything from singing, dancing, to rapping.

287
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,840
My goal is to become an all-around idol.

288
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,379
(An all-around idol?)

289
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,050
An idol with perfect skills.

290
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,050
I bet he's in 1st place. He's here to win 1st place.

291
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,619
I'm looking forward to Chromosome.

292
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,520
We should check out his ability.

293
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,260
(Which first impression class is Chen Kai Wen in?)

294
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,080
(Chen Kai Wen of Team Chromosome: All Star)

295
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,290
Thank you.

296
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,029
I was over the moon to get an All Star.

297
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,770
I want to keep receiving the All Star.

298
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,700
He's got a lot of stars on him.

299
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,120
I think it was intentional.

300
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,370
(He's got 12 stars.)

301
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:07,280
(The star-rich Chen Kai Wen sits in the 6th place.)

302
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,109
(The participants have now gathered at the Star Zone.)

303
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,250
How old are you?

304
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,020
- I was born in 2005. - Me too.

305
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,719
(We're the same age.)

306
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,920
I was born in 2002.

307
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,190
He looks quite young.

308
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,590
(The participant looks young.)

309
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,760
(Who?)

310
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,259
(I was born...)

311
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,830
(in 2010.)

312
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,330
What?

313
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,239
(Chattering)

314
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,340
Oh, my gosh.

315
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,340
If he was born in 2010, he is 15 now.

316
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,610
He was born when you were ten years old.

317
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,440
That's really young.

318
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,779
Let's stop talking about our age.

319
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,850
Let's move on, Producer.

320
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,220
(Production crew: Okay.)

321
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,160
(Regular participant)

322
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,920
- "Regular participant." - "Regular participant."

323
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,159
Does that mean they're not in any company?

324
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,530
Individual trainee.

325
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,830
What was on the screen when we came out?

326
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,130
Experienced.

327
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,170
Those in a company are "experienced."

328
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,790
Those without one must be "regular participant."

329
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,610
He's our first regular participant.

330
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,640
(Shanghai)

331
00:16:11,641 --> 00:16:13,780
(Who is the first regular participant?)

332
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,510
He's here.

333
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,320
(The one who is walking in with a big smile)

334
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,450
(Fan Zhe Yi, who made headlines with his looks)

335
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:24,689
(What's his name?)

336
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:25,859
(I found a gem.)

337
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,959
(I've decided to debut you. Please debut.)

338
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,130
(Who is he? Please tell me.)

339
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,660
Look at his prominent nose.

340
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,030
I can see the shadow cast by his nose.

341
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,530
He's really good-looking.

342
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,470
He's super tall.

343
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,839
(He's got the looks as well as the height.)

344
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,900
What a cool guy.

345
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,380
I'm Fan Zhe Yi, an individual trainee.

346
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,640
I'm currently attending Shanghai University.

347
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,779
(He was known for his looks even back in his university days.)

348
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,150
I'm 187cm tall.

349
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,990
(Showing off his impressive physique)

350
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,990
I've been cast in almost every audition show in China.

351
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:03,560
But I waited until I could apply for this show.

352
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,300
(Another regular participant is Team Guangdong.)

353
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,170
The goal is always to get an All Star.

354
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,710
Take good care of the stars on your body!

355
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,380
What?

356
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,379
Get on our bad side,

357
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,149
and we'll...

358
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,910
- take them all. - Take them all.

359
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,380
(An icy atmosphere)

360
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,760
Did everyone get intimidated by me?

361
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,900
(What's the result of the passionate participants?)

362
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,859
(Team Guangdong gets No Star.)

363
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,560
That was too arrogant.

364
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,100
It really upset me.

365
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,929
Why did I get a No Star?

366
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,300
I'll appear first.

367
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,370
I'll take the center. You two stand on either side of me.

368
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,680
Doesn't he seem a bit angry?

369
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,680
This show scares me.

370
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,110
(An even heavier atmosphere)

371
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,649
(Can the next team turn change the mood?)

372
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:00,650
(Participant)

373
00:18:00,651 --> 00:18:01,920
(Jiang Zhe Hu)

374
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,059
(Team Jiang Zhe Hu is wearing intense outfits.)

375
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,420
The red makes a strong impression.

376
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,230
Their presence is no joke.

377
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,570
(Nervous)

378
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,240
Sexy and hot, shining forever.

379
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,869
Sexy and hot, shining forever.

380
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,479
I will reveal my sexy charm to you.

381
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,540
I'm He Zhong Xing.

382
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,910
(Attacking with his sharp jawline)

383
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,519
(A sexy boy with a character appeared.)

384
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,980
(That's an extraordinary guy.)

385
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,620
Let's all be sexy!

386
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,620
(A sexy applause?)

387
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,120
(A cute applause here)

388
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,289
I actually think I'm sexy.

389
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,260
I'm confident that I'll get All Star.

390
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,240
(The result is that he got Two Star.)

391
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,800
Two Star?

392
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,840
He must be hurt.

393
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,070
A sexy boy never gets hurt. You're so sexy.

394
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,210
Hello.

395
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,510
You're sexy too.

396
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,350
(A cute boy is confused.)

397
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,320
(He Zhong Xing keeps going up the stairs.)

398
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,650
(Striding up)

399
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,960
(Is he aiming for the 1st place seat?)

400
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,959
(Making a right turn in haste)

401
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,989
(The sexy boy's destination is the 8th place seat.)

402
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:20,729
My birthday is August 8,

403
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,800
so eight is my lucky number.

404
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,470
(He Zhong Xing wants to take the 8th place seat.)

405
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,139
(The seat displacement rule)

406
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,216
(A participant who wins a 1:1 match can take Top 8 seats.)

407
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,810
(A challenger can decide on how to match.)

408
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,910
This is interesting.

409
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,150
How about a staring contest?

410
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,550
Okay.

411
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:47,090
(He Zhong Xing versus Chen Yu Qi, a staring contest for the 8th place)

412
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,690
Three, two, one. Start.

413
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,540
Gosh, the atmosphere is tense.

414
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,510
I will show you what the epitome of sexiness is.

415
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:11,109
(Provoking in a sexy manner)

416
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,420
(Shocked)

417
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,449
(Chen Yu Qi attacks the sexy boy with his spirit.)

418
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,750
(So excited)

419
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,329
(The 1st crisis for He Zhong Xing)

420
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,729
(Bring it on.)

421
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,929
(They're having a staring contest. Do not misunderstand the situation.)

422
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:29,600
(Craziness versus craziness)

423
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,130
(Reaching his hand in a sexy way)

424
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,239
(Flustered by Chen Yu Qi's counterattack)

425
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,980
(He Zhong Xing fails.)

426
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,540
That's amazing!

427
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,549
(I can't fail like this.)

428
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,080
Anyone wants to take the sexy battle?

429
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,920
I'm confident that I can win if it's about being sexy!

430
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,780
I can try!

431
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,120
(A new sexy challenger appears!)

432
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,259
Battle! Sexy!

433
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,890
You've got a rival for being sexy!

434
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,730
(A sexy battle happening on the 1st place seat)

435
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,040
I'm sexier than you.

436
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,869
(When you sit on the seat, )

437
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,110
(I lie on.)

438
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,840
That's so unfair.

439
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,080
(See how sexy I am.)

440
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,080
(Dumbfounded)

441
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
(It's not over yet.)

442
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,450
(Stop it.)

443
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,720
(In a trance)

444
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,090
You win.

445
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,730
(Sexy King takes 5th place just for being sexy.)

446
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,320
(Starting with Zhang Yu Xi sitting on the 1st place seat, )

447
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,499
(the seat displacement gets more intense.)

448
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,540
(The battle gets even fiercer.)

449
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,840
The B of BOYS II PLANET means "battle."

450
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,170
(The next team appears.)

451
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,709
(No way.)

452
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,110
BOYS PLANET?

453
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,010
- The one in Season 1. - The last season?

454
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,650
Oh, my gosh.

455
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,819
Who could it be?

456
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,820
I'm curious.

457
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,889
(Who are in Team BOYS PLANET?)

458
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,490
Krystian. I see.

459
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,960
Cai Jin Xin.

460
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,660
Xuan Hao.

461
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:06,600
(Three participants who showed good performances in Season 1)

462
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,746
(They're here to try again, overcoming the pain of elimination!)

463
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:10,770
Seniors!

464
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,200
It feels like I'm back in the last season.

465
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,240
(This is fascinating.)

466
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,680
(Which seat will Team BOYS PLANET take?)

467
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,339
(Xuan Hao challenges He Jun Jin.)

468
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,580
Why don't you walk forward and see who steps back first?

469
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,519
- All right. - Oh, my goodness!

470
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,089
We get close by walking forward, right?

471
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,820
- Okay. I'll go first. - Okay.

472
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,919
(Which one is going to win?)

473
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,260
(Surprised)

474
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,700
(He Jun Jin makes a sudden move.)

475
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,960
I need to show him what I got.

476
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,269
(Xuan Hao gets even closer.)

477
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,840
(Shocked)

478
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,100
Are we allowed to broadcast this?

479
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:55,950
Sexy.

480
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,279
Neither of them is stepping back.

481
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,880
What happens if they actually kiss?

482
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,060
- Is it all right to air this scene? - Unbelievable.

483
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,790
(Can't believe what he's seeing)

484
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,429
(Extremely focused despite the fuss)

485
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,869
(Slightly flustered)

486
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,100
Oh, my gosh.

487
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,540
I think they've already kissed.

488
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,440
Is this a dating reality show or what?

489
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,840
(This dating show is exciting.)

490
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,850
(Is this BOYS II LOVE?)

491
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,320
(This is getting romantic.)

492
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,560
What have I seen?

493
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,030
(Still in the battle amid explosive responses)

494
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,360
(You'd better give it up now.)

495
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:51,840
(Amazed to see how competitive his team member is)

496
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,400
(Attacking with his intense gaze)

497
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,040
(Eyes shaking)

498
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,740
(He Jun Jin loses.)

499
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,950
(A relaxed smile)

500
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:05,420
(The best-ever battle in the history of idol survival shows)

501
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,320
No one can beat him in this.

502
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,420
(Trembling)

503
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,620
(Laughing)

504
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,060
I went blank.

505
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,130
That's what a senior is.

506
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,230
He's amazingly motivated.

507
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,130
He was determined to win from the beginning.

508
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,590
All the seats will be taken soon.

509
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,869
(Seats are taken after the fierce seat displacement.)

510
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:33,010
(Now only 1 Star seats are left.)

511
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:35,710
I'm so excited to see the next team.

512
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,290
I guess they're regular participants.

513
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,850
Experienced participants.

514
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,320
- They must be experienced. - Right.

515
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,419
(Who are the next participants?)

516
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,249
(Experienced participants)

517
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,060
Experienced participants.

518
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,360
You got it right.

519
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,360
Is it going to be a strong team, appearing later in the show?

520
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,630
It must be a strong one.

521
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,099
Has anyone in a Korean agency appeared so far?

522
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,100
I don't know.

523
00:24:54,101 --> 00:24:56,382
The agency names aren't shown on the name tags this time.

524
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,980
I want to see who they are.

525
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,009
(Experienced participants in K-pop)

526
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,310
(A new class revealed)

527
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,380
Experienced participants in K-pop?

528
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,840
What?

529
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,710
No way. Is this true?

530
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,550
I'm a bit scared.

531
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,120
What does that mean?

532
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,290
Are they trained in a Korean agency?

533
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,520
Experienced participants in K-pop.

534
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,560
Let's see how much they're experienced.

535
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,360
Who are you?

536
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,700
What's that?

537
00:25:33,701 --> 00:25:35,340
Is it supposed to open?

538
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,160
They're appearing like that?

539
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,050
What's going on here?

540
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,810
Who are they?

541
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,380
They're totally strong ones!

542
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,049
They're appearing like that?

543
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,010
They're different from the way they're appearing.

544
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,459
How come there are so many of them?

545
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,580
There are so many like that?

546
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,330
They're shaking us up.

547
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,599
What's going on? Are they here to beat opponents?

548
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,699
He looks like the final boss.

549
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,700
(Who's the last one of the experienced participants in K-pop?)

550
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,870
- Boy Story! - Boy Story!

551
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,170
A boy band in JYP.

552
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,740
There's a legion of them.

553
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,280
They're in Korean agencies.

554
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,210
Dang Hong Hai was in Season 1 of BOYS PLANET.

555
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,550
Dang Hong Hai's eyes look very cold.

556
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,719
I know He Xin Long. He's in Boy Story.

557
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,990
Why is he here?

558
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,590
We can't beat them.

559
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,090
I'm scared.

560
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,130
Their spirit should be so strong.

561
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,400
We haven't seen their performance yet, though.

562
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,330
I'm burning with fighting spirit.

563
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,440
Why is he looking at us with his nostrils held so high?

564
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,769
This isn't going to be easy.

565
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,210
It's worth trying, though.

566
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:49,479
(A former K-pop idol group member...)

567
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,120
(or a trainee in a K-pop agency)

568
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,120
Their class is already decided.

569
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,290
They're All Star.

570
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,060
Why are they already All Star when we haven't voted yet?

571
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,590
All Star seats...

572
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,810
(All Star seats belong to experienced participants in K-pop.)

573
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,039
All Star seats belong to experienced participants in K-pop?

574
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
Come on!

575
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,010
Wait. What's going on here?

576
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,980
(Perplexed to see what he didn't expect)

577
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,680
Experienced participants and regular participants...

578
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:32,360
need to vacate the All Star seats now?

579
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,760
Do all of us have to go down?

580
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,129
They will come up here and kick all of us out.

581
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:41,330
(Experienced participants in K-pop will take All Star seats.)

582
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,270
All Star seats are for us.

583
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,970
They need to yield the seat to us.

584
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,800
I have no experience in K-pop.

585
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,280
I only have experience in C-pop.

586
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,170
We need to give up the upper seats for them.

587
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,980
I can't take this!

588
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,240
I will go against you with a tumbling match!

589
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,280
To be honest, I was irritated.

590
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:59,480
Why do we have to go down?

591
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,620
You need to come down, because I'm here!

592
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,410
We quibbled over the seats, but we handed them over at the end.

593
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,290
This makes my blood burn.

594
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,390
I'm so furious now.

595
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,930
Taking our seats only because of being experienced in K-pop?

596
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,570
It makes no sense.

597
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:21,640
Do they really have the skills that befit All Star?

598
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,580
(Which ones with experience in K-pop will take the All Star seats?)

599
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,580
(Who's the first participant with experience in K-pop?)

600
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,310
Hi.

601
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,779
Was he in the last season? He looks familiar.

602
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,920
He was in the last season.

603
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,389
(He starred in Season 1 of BOYS PLANET.)

604
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:40,620
(Dang Hong Hai was loved for his bright energy.)

605
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,830
Dang Hong Hai has changed a lot.

606
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,700
I'll keep it simple.

607
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,640
I'm here to debut.

608
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,309
- That's scary. - I'm in your care.

609
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,586
(His provocative greeting overwhelmed everyone.)

610
00:28:58,610 --> 00:28:59,939
What did he say he was here to do?

611
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,110
He's here to debut.

612
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:05,150
(Dang Hong Hai takes the 8th place seat.)

613
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,520
- Wake up! - Wake up!

614
00:29:06,521 --> 00:29:08,319
Hello, we're trainees under WakeOne.

615
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,349
I'm Ko Ming Chieh.

616
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,220
I'm Yi Chen. We're in your care.

617
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,020
It's Kim Tae Rae's agency.

618
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,889
(The group that debuted through BOYS PLANET, )

619
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,860
(ZEROBASEONE is under WakeOne.)

620
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,330
It's ZEROBASEONE's agency.

621
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,669
We're trainees from iNKODE.

622
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,970
I'm He Jia Hao.

623
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,070
I'm Sen.

624
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,810
(iNKODE is a K-pop agency that was founded by Kim Jae Joong.)

625
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,650
iNKODE! It's Kim Jae Joong's agency.

626
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:39,920
Aren't their speech and image systematic?

627
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,696
How should I say it? It seems like they've been trained systematically.

628
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,850
He's handsome.

629
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,920
That participant looks cool.

630
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,290
They look like American teenagers.

631
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,659
(Experienced participant in K-pop)

632
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,359
(The next teams are NOUER...)

633
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,530
(and NCC.)

634
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:59,200
(Zhou An Xin and Zhang Jia Hao of NOUER say hello first.)

635
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,540
(I'm becoming absorbed.)

636
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,310
(I can't believe it.)

637
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,810
He looks like a statue.

638
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,780
I love you.

639
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,750
(What is he looking at?)

640
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,790
(Attacking with his looks)

641
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,720
(Even the manly man, Sang Lin becomes a fan.)

642
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:24,790
My name is Zhang Jia Hao and I've trained for five years.

643
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,630
Hello, my name is Zhou An Xin and I've trained for three years.

644
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,230
They look talented.

645
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,340
I think that team will be popular this season.

646
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:33,969
Hello, we're...

647
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,510
- Boy Story. - Boy Story.

648
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:39,010
(Cheering)

649
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,580
They debuted a long time ago.

650
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:47,250
(Boy Story is a Chinese boy group Park Jin Young produced.)

651
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,319
(After debuting as freelancers in 2017)

652
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,190
(these talented idols swept various award ceremonies.)

653
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,259
No way.

654
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,960
I never imagined it.

655
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,660
It's a pretty popular boy group in China.

656
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:03,599
We'll make sure to seize our chance here...

657
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,940
so that we can take the bigger stage and realise our dream.

658
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,769
Please look forward to it.

659
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,010
We're in your care.

660
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,680
- Thank you. - They sure are different.

661
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,080
(Team NCC goes up to the All Star seats.)

662
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,180
Look at the way they're sitting.

663
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,050
Look at the way they're sitting.

664
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,820
Go to the first place seat.

665
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,250
(The 1st place seat is still empty.)

666
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,790
What? Won't they take it?

667
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:30,690
(They take the empty All Star seats, not the 1st place seat.)

668
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,230
The first place is too much.

669
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,970
(What will Team NOUER do?)

670
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,400
Go to the first place seat.

671
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,340
(Zhou An Xin takes the 3rd place seat.)

672
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,610
Number one!

673
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:54,050
(Zhang Jia Hao takes the 1st place seat.)

674
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,190
I still have a lot to learn,

675
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,520
so I think Hao suits the first place seat.

676
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,590
(All participants have entered.)

677
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,999
Currently, All Star is just based on the first impression.

678
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,730
I can take it with my skills later.

679
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,599
You guys may be experienced in K-pop,

680
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,470
but my performance doesn't lack in any way.

681
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,109
So those participants debuted.

682
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,739
Who cares?

683
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,150
I think it'll be worthwhile to take them on.

684
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:27,720
There are no teams that make me wary.

685
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,790
I'm confident.

686
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,210
I'm confident that I'll do better.

687
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,960
I'm a strong man.

688
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,790
Once an All Star participant, always an All Star participant.

689
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,529
What?

690
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:44,470
(The studio suddenly goes dark.)

691
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,370
Here it comes.

692
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:55,380
Welcome, 80 boys.

693
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:59,719
This is where the passion to reach the top burns bright,

694
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,550
BOYS II PLANET.

695
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,349
I'm getting goosebumps.

696
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,250
I suddenly got goosebumps too.

697
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:08,560
In BOYS II PLANET,

698
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,660
there isn't only one planet.

699
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,770
PLANET C and PLANET K are...

700
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,239
the two planets that exist.

701
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,700
Two planets.

702
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,480
You're in PLANET C.

703
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,079
PLANET C.

704
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,180
At a different place,

705
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:32,880
PLANET K's story is beginning.

706
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,640
Is it getting filmed at the same time?

707
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,390
(Who are they?)

708
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,599
It's PLANET K!

709
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,800
PLANET K is blue.

710
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,770
(They face the participants of PLANET K on the screen.)

711
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,140
Is that PLANET K?

712
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,699
Hello.

713
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,940
- Hello. - It feels so strange.

714
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,369
Can they see us?

715
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,110
It feels like a time slip.

716
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,740
A parallel universe.

717
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,350
PLANET C and PLANET K.

718
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,950
The boys who survived in their respective planets...

719
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,790
will meet in the one and only planet,

720
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,320
BOYS II PLANET...

721
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,519
- and continue competing... - We have to meet!

722
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,360
For survival in earnest.

723
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:16,889
That means PLANET K is also...

724
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,770
Do we need to compete against PLANET K as well?

725
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:22,059
Only the boys who survive the process...

726
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,030
and reach the very top...

727
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:26,640
will realise their dream of debuting.

728
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,969
It's the beginning of the cruel competition.

729
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:31,770
I think the competition will be fierce this season.

730
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:35,310
The participants are divided into three statuses.

731
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,210
Those who have worked as a member of a K-pop boy group...

732
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,319
or joined a K-pop agency...

733
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,120
to receive professional training and management are...

734
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,060
experienced participants in K-pop.

735
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,360
We're the top.

736
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,590
Those who have joined an agency...

737
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,430
to receive management despite having no ties to K-pop...

738
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,370
or debuted in the past are...

739
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,830
experienced participants.

740
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,970
They're simply "experienced participants".

741
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,739
Lastly...

742
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,869
Is it my turn?

743
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:07,979
Those without an agency or support...

744
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,079
- who came here with only a dream... - It's me.

745
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,080
Are regular participants.

746
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,780
(They're incredible.)

747
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:18,750
But from now on, your status...

748
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,330
won't be important.

749
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,990
Not important.

750
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:28,459
You'll be judged for your skills, charms, and potential...

751
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,070
as a member of a K-pop boy group.

752
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,970
Potential.

753
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,370
The result will be the class.

754
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,809
(Class)

755
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:42,110
The current class won't be the final one.

756
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:45,150
The lowest class is One Star.

757
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,150
Above it is Two Star.

758
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,920
Three Star?

759
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,660
The top class is All Star.

760
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:53,819
- All Star. - All Star.

761
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,730
We've got to get All Star.

762
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:57,790
I'll get there soon.

763
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,600
The participants will be divided into these three classes.

764
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,640
At the end of each mission, the lowest class members...

765
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,170
will be eliminated right away.

766
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:12,610
(Shocked)

767
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,879
Will they be eliminated right away?

768
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,726
Will they be eliminated right away after each mission?

769
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,210
BOYS II PLANET doesn't disappoint.

770
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:22,049
In that case, which important people make the decisions...

771
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,620
regarding your class and the fate of your debut?

772
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:25,920
Who are they?

773
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,690
With their energy like the sun,

774
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,530
the fans around the world will give you strength.

775
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,330
They're the Star Creators.

776
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,699
Creators.

777
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,169
Star Creators.

778
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,729
Gosh, the sun.

779
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,440
I loved how they got compared to the sun.

780
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,569
With your passion and energy,

781
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:45,209
ignite the fire in the hearts of the Star Creators...

782
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,780
around the world.

783
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,610
I'm in your care.

784
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,149
Please vote for me.

785
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,310
I love you guys.

786
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,950
Now let's meet...

787
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:56,089
the top K-pop experts from different fields...

788
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,419
who will help the participants grow.

789
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,489
I introduce the Masters...

790
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:02,330
of BOYS II PLANET C.

791
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,690
We should get up, right?

792
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,130
(Everyone gets up.)

793
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,500
I'm nervous.

794
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,370
Vocal Master.

795
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,870
Vocal Master.

796
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,640
Who is it?

797
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,340
- Who is it? - Who is it?

798
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,640
Vocal Master, Hyolin.

799
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,710
My goodness!

800
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,479
(Oh, my!)

801
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,150
I know her. Oh, my gosh.

802
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,919
(With her powerful singing skills and performance skills, )

803
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,720
(she's the perfect vocalist who never let us down.)

804
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,660
(Vocal Master, Hyolin)

805
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:37,959
Vocal Master, Dance Master.

806
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,229
- Are they men? - They seem familiar.

807
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,670
I can recognise them from their silhouettes.

808
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,930
ONESTAR. Back Koo Young.

809
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,640
They actually came!

810
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,799
Let's go!

811
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,870
(Make some noise.)

812
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,469
(Vocal Master of BOYS PLANET, Season 1...)

813
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,009
(with unrivalled variety show skills.)

814
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:56,580
(ONESTAR is a textbook vocalist with exemplary vocalization.)

815
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,980
(And)

816
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,519
(From the choreography of the top idols in Korea...)

817
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,219
(to the choreography of "Here I Am,")

818
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,950
(a signal song of BOYS PLANET, Season 1.)

819
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,389
(Back Koo Young is a legendary choreographer...)

820
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,690
(in the K-pop dance scene.)

821
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,560
I can really feel that I'm on BOYS II PLANET.

822
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,300
"Did you only practise 'Kick It' for years?"

823
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,130
(Did you only practise "Kick It" for years?)

824
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,400
Do you all want to be demoted?

825
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,730
I'm very afraid to be criticized by him.

826
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,770
I'm ready to be criticized.

827
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,340
Dance Master Jrick.

828
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,080
Jrick.

829
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,720
He choreographed "Guilty" by TAEMIN.

830
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,410
He is KAI's choreographer.

831
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,379
(A rising performance director who gains attention...)

832
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,720
(for creating trendy K-pop choreography)

833
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:42,159
He creates very trendy choreography.

834
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,260
Personally, I can't wait for his lessons.

835
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,060
Is it Rap Master next?

836
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,899
Dance Master.

837
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,959
(Another Dance Master)

838
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,030
Are there three of them?

839
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,700
- Who is it? - It looks like a woman.

840
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,310
Dance Master Xiao Ting.

841
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:57,410
(Screaming)

842
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,810
Xiao Ting.

843
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:02,280
(Xiao Ting)

844
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:05,080
(Standing ovation)

845
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,750
I got goosebumps.

846
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:13,189
(She made her debut with Kep1er on "Girls Planet 999.")

847
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,289
(A member of a talented girl group)

848
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:18,730
(Kep1er's beautiful main dancer)

849
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:21,200
(Welcome)

850
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,830
- So beautiful. - Oh, my gosh.

851
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,640
Master Xiao Ting is perfect in many ways.

852
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,509
Master Xiao Ting also became...

853
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,570
an idol singer through a survival show.

854
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:34,540
So she will probably be stricter than others.

855
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,809
(Did you really practise?)

856
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:39,419
(It was infuriating to watch.)

857
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,980
(I don't think you worked hard.)

858
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,189
The next Master.

859
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,320
I bet it's Rap Master.

860
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,730
Rap Master Justhis.

861
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,559
- It's Justhis. - He looks amazing.

862
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,930
I didn't expect it at all.

863
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:56,529
(Dominating the stage with powerful rap)

864
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:57,829
(The leading figure in South Korea's hip-hop scene)

865
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,770
(The top-tier rapper, Justhis)

866
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,170
He must have a strong personality.

867
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,279
Swagger.

868
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,380
He's so laid-back.

869
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,909
Master Justhis was wearing sunglasses.

870
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,410
I really wanted to see him take off his sunglasses.

871
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,379
(Hard outside but soft inside)

872
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,290
(Master Justhis's unexpected charm is coming soon.)

873
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,290
The lineup is incredible.

874
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,260
And...

875
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,690
It's the last one.

876
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,160
Who could it be?

877
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:30,900
The Chief Master on BOYS II PLANET C.

878
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,270
I'm getting goosebumps.

879
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,799
We want to know.

880
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,170
Chief Master...

881
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,070
Kim Jae Joong.

882
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,040
Kim Jae Joong.

883
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,210
Kim Jae Joong!

884
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:44,480
(Unbelievable)

885
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:48,750
He has been my role model.

886
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,889
- His face is so small. - He's really handsome.

887
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,789
He looks incredible. He's amazing.

888
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,960
He looks like he's in his early 20s.

889
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,730
Twenty...

890
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,359
five years old?

891
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,200
- He was born in 1986. - What?

892
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,600
Is this K-pop?

893
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,029
(Is this K-pop?)

894
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,669
The Master lineup is incredible.

895
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,309
Oh, my gosh.

896
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,369
(An amazing lineup)

897
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,539
I was very shocked.

898
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:14,040
All of a sudden, a living legend was...

899
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,849
standing in front of me.

900
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,580
I couldn't believe it.

901
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:20,920
Eighty participants, nice to meet you.

902
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,020
(Nice to meet you too)

903
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,920
I can't believe Master Kim Jae Joong is here.

904
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,690
To debut as a K-pop boy group,

905
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,860
an intense survival competition will begin.

906
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,200
(Sighing)

907
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:34,810
The competition is in full swing now.

908
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,070
What will be the first test...

909
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,640
to determine your fate?

910
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,700
The first performance.

911
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,610
It's Class Placement Match.

912
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,040
(Class Placement Match)

913
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,010
I'm nervous.

914
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:50,779
Experienced participants in K-pop have either made...

915
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,619
their debut as an idol singer...

916
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:55,349
or received professional training.

917
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:59,020
Recognised as being closer to their debut as a K-pop boy group,

918
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,920
they're currently sitting in All Star seats.

919
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:06,000
However, your class won't be important from now on.

920
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,206
I'm determined to move up to All Star Class.

921
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,400
I can turn the tables.

922
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:11,076
I want to see how strong the experienced participants are.

923
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,170
Give it a try.

924
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,339
After watching your performance,

925
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,269
the Masters will judge you...

926
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,880
based on your skills, charms, and potential.

927
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:24,349
Among All Star, 2 Star, 1 Star,

928
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:27,050
we will decide your class.

929
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,350
I will definitely get All Star.

930
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:35,090
However, if you fail to show the Masters anything,

931
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:39,400
you'll be disgraced to No Star.

932
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,460
And,

933
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,200
right after that,

934
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,670
you'll be eliminated.

935
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,710
You'll be eliminated.

936
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,870
- Eliminated right away? - After the first performance?

937
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,640
- Oh, my gosh. - My gosh.

938
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,450
- Oh, my gosh. - My gosh.

939
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,050
No Star participants...

940
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,740
must go through the elimination gate...

941
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,620
and leave BOYS II PLANET C.

942
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:11,060
You can't return ever again.

943
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,430
That's scary.

944
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,659
That's thrilling.

945
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,099
We have to pack up and go home.

946
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,129
Isn't this the first time such a thing happened...

947
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,100
on a survival show?

948
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:22,140
I'm very scared and nervous.

949
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,639
Being placed in One Star is okay,

950
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,180
but I should never get No Star.

951
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,350
All right.

952
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,410
I can't wait any longer.

953
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,119
To determine your class...

954
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,320
I really want to get All Star.

955
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:37,990
Class Placement Match...

956
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:39,789
I consider myself All Star.

957
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:41,989
- I must get All Star. - Let's get All Star.

958
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,130
It starts now.

959
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:44,990
Let's go.

960
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:46,830
- We can do it. - We can do it.

961
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,129
(Class Placement Match to determine the participants' fate)

962
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:50,429
(What will be the result?)

963
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:56,569
(Class Placement Match finally started.)

964
00:43:56,570 --> 00:44:03,549
(The participants put everything on the line for their survival.)

965
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:11,089
(What does the future hold for the participants?)

966
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:12,759
(Coming up soon)

967
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,330
(Interim rankings from the 1st round of voting)

968
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:20,760
(Before Class Placement Match that will start soon)

969
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,069
- What did you write? - I wrote...

970
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:26,939
(The new Chief Master is getting prepared.)

971
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,570
You'll see a few who will shock you.

972
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:31,069
I can't wait.

973
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:32,979
(Anticipating and excited)

974
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,179
(He can't wait to meet them.)

975
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:35,210
You know what?

976
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:38,380
I'm worried about the language difference.

977
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:40,696
I wonder if their pronunciation will be good.

978
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,320
Pronunciation was hard for me back then.

979
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:45,219
(When she appeared on "Girls Planet 999")

980
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:50,290
(Master Xiao Ting wasn't good at speaking Korean.)

981
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:54,060
You were quite good at speaking Korean.

982
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,000
Thank you.

983
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,200
Class Placement Match.

984
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:02,570
Let's meet the first team.

985
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,640
It's the first one.

986
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:06,430
I'm really looking forward to it.

987
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:10,549
(Regular participants)

988
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,430
- Regular participants? - Regular participants?

989
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,590
- Regular participants? - Regular participants?

990
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:16,750
- Jiang Zhe Hu? - Jiang Zhe Hu.

991
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,120
- Jiang Zhe Hu? - Jiang Zhe Hu.

992
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,589
Sexy.

993
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:25,689
- Sexy. - Sexy men.

994
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:26,800
Sexy.

995
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,360
Gosh, Jiang Zhe Hu.

996
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:30,799
- Sexy. - They have a strong presence.

997
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,520
- Sexy men. - They look like runway models.

998
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,760
- He's very handsome. - Yes.

999
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:38,070
(Their first appearance grabs everyone's attention.)

1000
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:39,910
(His looks pierce the screen.)

1001
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,450
Hello, I'm Zheng Kun.

1002
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,010
Are you ready for a blow of my sweetness?

1003
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,520
This is captivating Yuan Wei.

1004
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,520
Hello, everyone.

1005
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:59,860
What do you think my captivating charm is?

1006
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:05,376
(What do you think my captivating charm is?)

1007
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,970
- Sexy. - Sexy.

1008
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:09,570
Sexy and hot, shining forever.

1009
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:11,910
He Zhong Xing, yes.

1010
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,510
Sexy.

1011
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:17,750
Isn't he born...

1012
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,850
- to be an idol singer? - Right.

1013
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:22,180
He reminds me of Felix.

1014
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,590
His gaze gives me that feeling.

1015
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,920
- The same hairstyle? - Felix.

1016
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,389
He doesn't look like a regular participant.

1017
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:29,910
He has the potential to become a star.

1018
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:37,170
(You can feel his sexy vibe from afar.)

1019
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:39,430
I'm not sexy enough. I need to be sexier.

1020
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:40,700
I'm not sexy enough.

1021
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,539
I'm ready to show you my sexy charms.

1022
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:45,740
I'm He Zhong Xing.

1023
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,750
I was born sexy and hot.

1024
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:53,449
Hey, sexy.

1025
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:54,650
How do I look now?

1026
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,220
Do I look sexy?

1027
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,050
Do I look sexy today?

1028
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,590
Who looks sexier? Me or him?

1029
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:06,260
- Answer me. - You're sexier, of course.

1030
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:08,500
What do you think, everyone?

1031
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:12,329
As you've impressed me with your looks,

1032
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,300
I'm looking forward to your performance as well.

1033
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,410
- Let's see your performance. - Yes.

1034
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:18,340
Let's go.

1035
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:22,910
Their poses look good.

1036
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:26,520
I hope their skills will be as strong as their appearance.

1037
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:30,950
I will show you my sexy charms.

1038
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,721
("On and On" by VIXX performed by Yuan Wei, Zheng Kun, He Zhong Xing)

1039
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,870
BOYS II PLANET.

1040
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,050
Sexy, you ready?

1041
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:40,120
Let's go!

1042
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:43,860
Let's go!

1043
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,270
(Zheng Kun, late on the beat)

1044
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,409
Sexy.

1045
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:07,250
(Sexy until the end)

1046
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:09,110
How can the regular participants be so good?

1047
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,690
That was wild. They are totally crazy, aren't they?

1048
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:17,290
The team of regular participants exceeded my expectations,

1049
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:19,390
and that makes me very happy.

1050
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,960
He Zhong Xing, who called himself sexy...

1051
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:25,300
from the start...

1052
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,770
really stood out.

1053
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,310
You prepared it well.

1054
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:35,309
I think you are all being too generous...

1055
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:38,150
just because they are regular participants.

1056
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,249
From a vocal standpoint,

1057
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:44,620
the excitement seemed to overpower the focus.

1058
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:52,160
(Their vocals didn't meet the expectations.)

1059
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,700
We will discuss your class.

1060
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:57,569
I think they will either all get Two Star...

1061
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:59,930
or He Zhong Xing will be the only one getting the Two Star.

1062
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,969
I think He Zhong Xing will get the All Star.

1063
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:05,490
He's got a chance to get the All Star.

1064
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:08,179
- The center one. - Yes?

1065
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,809
I think he could be All Star.

1066
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:10,850
All Star?

1067
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,909
I will announce the class.

1068
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:14,096
(What will be the fate of Team Zhang Zhe Hou?)

1069
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,180
I'm nervous.

1070
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:18,949
(The door suddenly opens from behind.)

1071
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:19,959
Oh, my.

1072
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,360
The gate has to open first, I guess.

1073
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,490
If you get placed in the No Star Class,

1074
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,930
you will exit...

1075
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:33,800
through that gate.

1076
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,809
(Shocked)

1077
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:38,709
- What? - My heart is pounding.

1078
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:40,280
No, no.

1079
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:42,410
I am so nervous.

1080
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:46,110
I didn’t expect someone to get eliminated in the first performance.

1081
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:48,540
Are they really going to eliminate people...

1082
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:52,750
in the Class Placement Match?

1083
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,889
I will announce their class.

1084
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:58,466
(No Star participant will be eliminated right away.)

1085
00:50:58,490 --> 00:50:59,800
Yuan Wei.

1086
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,100
We are placing you...

1087
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:07,070
in the One Star Class.

1088
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:09,370
Thank you.

1089
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:12,969
Zheng Kun.

1090
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:15,640
(Which class will Zheng Kun be placed in?)

1091
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,540
We are placing you in the No Star Class.

1092
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:21,619
(Zheng Kun becomes the first one to be placed in the No Star Class.)

1093
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,679
In the No Star Class.

1094
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,560
(The first No Star announcement shocks everyone.)

1095
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:31,130
The first one is a very bad dancer.

1096
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,300
(He was a beat late when he danced.)

1097
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:38,930
He seems to lack a solid understanding of dance.

1098
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:44,009
(Which class will He Zhong Xing be placed?)

1099
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:45,670
He Zhong Xing.

1100
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,740
Honestly, he showcased his charms.

1101
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,310
He Zhong Xing's class is...

1102
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,350
I think they might give me the All Star.

1103
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,330
We are placing He Zhong Xing...

1104
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:12,769
in the Two Star Class.

1105
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:14,370
(He Zhong Xing of Zhang Zhe Hou, 2 Star)

1106
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,510
(The high judging standard shocks the participants.)

1107
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,139
I am not satisfied.

1108
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,686
(I'm not satisfied to be placed in the 2 Star Class.)

1109
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:24,910
I didn't expect that.

1110
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,180
But he's a regular participant.

1111
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:30,389
Let's talk about that performance.

1112
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:31,849
He Zhong Xing was very clever.

1113
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:36,689
He completed the performance with his face and expressions.

1114
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:38,889
As Dance Master, I would say,

1115
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:41,830
to have a lasting career in this field, you’ll need to...

1116
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:45,830
work more on your fundamentals and refine your dance skills.

1117
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:48,970
I don't think I am bad.

1118
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,270
I have my own unique charms.

1119
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,680
I will stop here.

1120
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:57,610
(Team Zhang Zhe Hou got a No Star.)

1121
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:02,050
Zheng Kun, do you wish to take an extra test?

1122
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,189
(Extra...)

1123
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:06,790
(test?)

1124
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,220
No Star participants,

1125
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:11,930
if you are not satisfied with the No Star,

1126
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,860
you will get one more chance...

1127
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,700
to take the extra test.

1128
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:23,140
(Zheng Kun got one last chance.)

1129
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:24,570
This is hard.

1130
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:27,880
I am sure he wants it.

1131
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,610
I will take the chance.

1132
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,109
(Extra Test)

1133
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:33,950
This is the first extra test.

1134
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:36,620
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1135
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:38,850
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1136
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,060
(He chose the vocal category for the extra test.)

1137
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:45,790
("Colour" by Zheng Kun)

1138
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:12,820
His tone fits the song perfectly.

1139
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:17,689
I will announce Zheng Kun's Class after the extra test.

1140
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:18,970
(What will be Zheng Kun's fate?)

1141
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:21,130
I came all the way to Korea to become an idol.

1142
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,200
I am worried that I might be going home.

1143
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:28,839
We are placing Zheng Kun...

1144
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,200
(What is Zheng Kun's final class?)

1145
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,340
in the One Star Class. Congratulations.

1146
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:37,010
Thank you, Masters.

1147
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:39,310
I will prove myself to you.

1148
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,320
(Zheng Kun, One Star)

1149
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,620
That is so touching.

1150
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,440
I will do everything I can to make it up to the All Star Class.

1151
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:50,090
Sexy and hot.

1152
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:52,589
(You hear his voice again just when you thought you forgot it.)

1153
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:53,930
Sexy and hot.

1154
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:55,930
All Star.

1155
00:54:55,931 --> 00:54:59,100
I will come back to get you next time.

1156
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:05,310
Gosh, that startled me.

1157
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,810
I get startled whenever that gate opens.

1158
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:10,880
Why do I feel more nervous?

1159
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:14,779
This is fun. It's fun watching.

1160
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,150
It's fun watching.

1161
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:17,620
But it's frightening to perform.

1162
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,050
I feel the same.

1163
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:21,760
Time for the next team. Who is it going to be?

1164
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,859
- Experienced participant. - Experienced participant.

1165
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,059
Experienced participant.

1166
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:28,360
Experienced participant. How experienced are they?

1167
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,130
They have to be good, don't they?

1168
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:36,339
- Chromosome Entertainment. - Chromosome Entertainment.

1169
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:39,310
That's Lay's agency.

1170
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,439
There was one person from there on the first season.

1171
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,580
- Wang Zihao. - That's him.

1172
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:46,719
(In the 1st season of BOYS PLANET, )

1173
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,079
(Wang Zihao showed off his unrivalled dance skills.)

1174
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:52,090
(Park Geon Uk, Wang zihao)

1175
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,936
(How talented the participant from Chromosome Entertainment be?)

1176
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,029
(Clattering)

1177
00:55:57,030 --> 00:56:00,500
(The mysterious sound echoes across the set.)

1178
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,100
What is this?

1179
00:56:02,101 --> 00:56:03,230
What's this sound?

1180
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:07,940
(What?)

1181
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,440
(What is that?)

1182
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:12,610
What is that?

1183
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,810
- That was what he was playing. - So that was it.

1184
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:16,139
(It's a traditional instrument, wooden clapper.)

1185
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,710
(Clinking)

1186
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:19,750
Let's go!

1187
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:22,279
- Hello, everyone. - Cool!

1188
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:25,850
Thank you in advance for your support.

1189
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:28,660
- That was cool. - Cool.

1190
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:32,430
Hello, I am Chen Kai Wen from Chromosome Entertainment.

1191
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:35,030
You're from Chromosome Entertainment.

1192
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:38,429
Someone from there joined the first season.

1193
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:40,970
- Wang Zihao. - It's Wang Zihao.

1194
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:43,370
Yes. I know. I know Zihao.

1195
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:45,109
He knows Zihao.

1196
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:48,810
He danced so well that he won my approval.

1197
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,410
I dance a little better than him.

1198
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,480
(Look at that confidence.)

1199
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,480
(Is that right?)

1200
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:57,889
As the test song, you chose "Get a Guitar" by RIIZE.

1201
00:56:57,890 --> 00:56:58,890
Yes.

1202
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,560
"Get a Guitar."

1203
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:02,690
I sang that song for the audition.

1204
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:04,689
You sang? You can't dance, can you?

1205
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:05,690
(Shaking his head)

1206
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:08,960
I actually choreographed...

1207
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:11,800
this song, you see.

1208
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,560
You know the importance of the steps, right?

1209
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,640
Okay.

1210
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,939
("Get a Guitar" by RIIZE)

1211
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:23,480
(The choreography is known for its intricate footwork.)

1212
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:25,810
Please perform.

1213
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,080
He's a trainee from Lay's agency.

1214
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,020
I'm excited.

1215
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:34,490
("Get a Guitar" by RIIZE performed by Chen Kai Wen)

1216
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:43,030
Great balance.

1217
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:02,220
Do well. It's here.

1218
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:05,450
You know the importance of the steps, right?

1219
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,900
Even a dance break!

1220
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:34,680
His dance moves are so neat.

1221
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,020
He's very stable.

1222
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:45,190
That was cool.

1223
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,000
Chen Kai Wen,

1224
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,469
this is a very difficult song to dance to.

1225
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:53,839
But I was impressed by how you overcame it...

1226
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:54,970
with effort.

1227
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:00,710
I didn't see any weaknesses in dancing or singing.

1228
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:03,240
I'll announce your class.

1229
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,480
All Star.

1230
00:59:07,481 --> 00:59:09,280
Chen Kai Wen, we're placing you...

1231
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:11,149
in the Two Star Class.

1232
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:13,790
(Chen Kai Wen of Team Chromosome is placed in the Two Star Class.)

1233
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:15,190
Oh, my gosh.

1234
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:18,190
(The result shocks everyone.)

1235
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:19,460
Why, though?

1236
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:20,929
But he danced so well.

1237
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:22,030
(Chromosome, Chen Kai Wen)

1238
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:24,199
What did you think about his dance?

1239
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,300
I loved it.

1240
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,640
- He's a great dancer. - His tempo control was on point.

1241
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,200
His vocals could have been better.

1242
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,980
(His vocals weren't as good as his dancing.)

1243
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,280
The evaluative criteria were higher than I thought.

1244
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:40,680
I saw how difficult it was to get All Star,

1245
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,080
so I felt more pressured.

1246
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:47,360
I was so bummed that I had to remove a Star.

1247
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,759
(Sighing)

1248
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:54,160
I don't think I handled it so well.

1249
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,270
That's a shame.

1250
00:59:57,570 --> 00:59:59,830
There's no wow factor.

1251
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:02,269
- It was ordinary. - It was.

1252
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:04,046
(Who's the next participant while everyone thinks it's a shame?)

1253
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:05,440
(Regular participant)

1254
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:06,870
They're regular participants.

1255
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,239
(Shanghai)

1256
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,180
- Shanghai! - Shanghai!

1257
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:12,110
(Quickly scanning)

1258
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:14,520
They're pretty tall.

1259
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:18,120
Rich Shanghai boys!

1260
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:22,420
(All eyes are drawn to their overwhelming presence.)

1261
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,790
They look like models.

1262
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:26,230
The rich boys are here.

1263
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:27,830
Shanghai.

1264
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,760
(Drums)

1265
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:36,210
(Is that melody what I think it is?)

1266
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:37,709
It's "Shanghai Romance!"

1267
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:40,540
(Here goes "Shanghai Romance.")

1268
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,320
- Is that "Shanghai Romance?" - Yes.

1269
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:45,630
(The Masters are satisfied.)

1270
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:48,120
They're tall and handsome.

1271
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:49,620
(Cutesy)

1272
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,750
- He's 17 years old? - He's 17!

1273
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,189
He's 17.

1274
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:55,190
(Chen Bo Wen is 17 years old, the youngest of Team Shanghai.)

1275
01:00:55,191 --> 01:00:56,359
When they entered,

1276
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,660
one of them stood out to me.

1277
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:01,460
They're pretty tall.

1278
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,230
(Checking his name)

1279
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:07,240
(Which of these four stood out to him?)

1280
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,470
- Fan Zhe Yi. - Yes?

1281
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:11,970
(Looking intently)

1282
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:17,280
You're handsome.

1283
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:19,530
(He doesn't know how to respond.)

1284
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:20,980
I said, "You're handsome."

1285
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,450
I love that.

1286
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:25,419
What? That was too honest.

1287
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:28,019
Does it make you feel good when people say you're handsome?

1288
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:29,220
It's thrilling.

1289
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:31,159
I love hearing that.

1290
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,360
I was so glad.

1291
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:37,029
Because the first thing the fans see is your looks.

1292
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:39,900
The looks come first in being an idol singer.

1293
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:42,140
And your skills come second.

1294
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,769
Usually, when a participant is...

1295
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:48,510
so attractive and good-looking...

1296
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:50,850
(Sighing)

1297
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:53,310
You think he'll lack the skills?

1298
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:57,450
I tend to think, "He must lack the skills."

1299
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:00,560
(Let's check out Team Shanghai's skills.)

1300
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:02,230
Get ready for your performance.

1301
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:03,889
- Good luck! - Good luck!

1302
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:04,890
Good luck!

1303
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:06,889
("Devil Game" by ZEROBASEONE)

1304
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,490
(Performed by Yang Jia Peng, Chen Bo Wen, Fan Zhe Yi, Hu Han Wen)

1305
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:26,410
- What? - What is with him?

1306
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:28,280
The good dancer is Chen Bo Wen.

1307
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:41,760
They're good.

1308
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,760
(He doesn't miss the camera until the end.)

1309
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:08,466
- Who is this guy? - How come he's so good?

1310
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:11,230
Look at him. His moves flow like water.

1311
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:18,470
- Let's go! - Go!

1312
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,239
- Let's go! - Go!

1313
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,240
Let's go!

1314
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,090
Chen Bo Wen is...

1315
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:12,190
Thank you for watching.

1316
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:15,360
- They were the best ones. - I'm so shocked.

1317
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:16,890
I was caught off guard.

1318
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,930
How can regular participants give us a performance...

1319
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:22,260
of such quality?

1320
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,269
I even noticed some skilfulness...

1321
01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:28,240
that I could hardly believe you were regular participants.

1322
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,939
(Point 1: Making eye contact with the camera)

1323
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:32,869
(Point 2: Bold moves that aren't expected from regular participants)

1324
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:34,980
(Point 3: Confidently pulling off the high notes)

1325
01:04:36,110 --> 01:04:37,350
You did really well.

1326
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,280
I have a feeling...

1327
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,850
that some participants on this team will get All Star.

1328
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:46,020
I bet it's Hu Han Wen or Chen Bo Wen.

1329
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:47,490
I think it's Chen Bo Wen.

1330
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,120
I was so surprised when Chen Bo Wen danced.

1331
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:52,860
I think it's Fan Zhe Yi.

1332
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:56,830
(What's the result of Team Shanghai that got all the compliments?)

1333
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:02,739
Hello.

1334
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:06,170
(Hu Han Wen and Yang Jia Peng got 2 Stars.)

1335
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,949
BOYS II PLANET C!

1336
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:12,356
(Chen Bo Wen is placed in the All Star Class.)

1337
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:15,350
(Which class is Fan Zhe Yi placed in?)

1338
01:05:17,790 --> 01:05:19,390
Fan Zhe Yi.

1339
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:26,560
There were some points deducted.

1340
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:38,370
(He's laughing all of a sudden.)

1341
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:44,410
Koo Young, you were...

1342
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:46,280
very conscious of him.

1343
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:48,520
I meant to give him no Stars... Never mind.

1344
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:51,689
- What's your opinion? - Two, two, two, and three.

1345
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:52,750
Two, two, two, and three?

1346
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:55,720
You can't give the third guy All Star?

1347
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,590
He's so tall that I'm jealous.

1348
01:05:58,690 --> 01:05:59,860
(Laughing)

1349
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:02,360
That could happen.

1350
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:04,029
I'd say I was jealous.

1351
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:06,106
(His points were deducted due to Koo Young's jealousy.)

1352
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:08,369
Jae Joong is tall, so he must know...

1353
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:11,970
how tougher it is and how much more effort it takes...

1354
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:14,080
for a tall person to dance.

1355
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:15,540
So, I was doubtful.

1356
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,550
I was doubtful, but...

1357
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:21,250
Fan Zhe Yi...

1358
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,980
(What's Fan Zhe Yi's class?)

1359
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:26,189
is placed in the All Star Class.

1360
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:27,190
(Fan Zhe Yi, All Star)

1361
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:29,320
Thank you!

1362
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:32,829
The first participants to be placed in the All Star Class, guys.

1363
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:33,859
Give it up!

1364
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:35,460
(Everyone claps.)

1365
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:39,770
Congratulations.

1366
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,169
The evaluation I wanted to get the most was...

1367
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:44,810
that it was a complete performance.

1368
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:47,110
Let's practise one more time.

1369
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:49,940
We'll check our stage positions once more.

1370
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:51,550
Check our positions!

1371
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:56,420
(Fan Zhe Yi led the practise until the performance began.)

1372
01:06:58,190 --> 01:07:01,189
The looks come first in being an idol singer.

1373
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:03,090
And your skills come second.

1374
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:07,190
But I believe my skills matter more than my looks.

1375
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:11,430
- Such a handsome group. - I know, right?

1376
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:13,800
Do you want to know my honest thoughts?

1377
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:15,950
"I want to bring them to my company."

1378
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:17,610
(They're that good-looking.)

1379
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:19,590
Should their looks be involved in judging them?

1380
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:20,709
Of course.

1381
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:21,939
I've been involving them this whole time.

1382
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:24,110
- Seriously? But I never did. - Yes.

1383
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,349
Isn't that what you call attractiveness?

1384
01:07:26,350 --> 01:07:27,830
Yes, it's important for idol singers.

1385
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:30,989
There are so many handsome guys this time.

1386
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:34,119
They're all pretty and glowing.

1387
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,619
(For the Star Creators)

1388
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:37,320
He looks like a prince.

1389
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,260
(Prince Charming appears in BOYS II PLANET C.)

1390
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:42,860
How can someone's face be so small?

1391
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:49,570
(There are handsome boys everywhere.)

1392
01:07:49,770 --> 01:07:51,040
(Staring)

1393
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,709
(Everyone's impressed.)

1394
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:56,439
(The most handsome participant enters.)

1395
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,980
His face is so small.

1396
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:01,849
(He's the best-looking participant.)

1397
01:08:01,850 --> 01:08:03,480
He looks like an idol singer.

1398
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:07,659
(Let's take our time to appreciate his looks.)

1399
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:09,389
(He approves of his looks.)

1400
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:11,889
(Another participant draws their attention.)

1401
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:15,160
(Looking cute)

1402
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:18,770
(He's super focused on fixing his makeup during the break.)

1403
01:08:19,230 --> 01:08:21,470
(Who is this participant, making sure he looks amazing?)

1404
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:23,699
The camera won't look at you.

1405
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:24,770
It's moving away.

1406
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:26,710
(Teasing)

1407
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,880
(Seizing the opportunity to be on camera)

1408
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:29,980
(Struggling)

1409
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,050
You're so mean.

1410
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:34,179
If I make it to the first round, I'll do a cute performance.

1411
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:35,720
Should I try a cute performance too?

1412
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:38,019
(He was born to be sexy.)

1413
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:40,150
(But he'll go after a cute theme?)

1414
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:41,859
(What do you say? Aren't you curious about my cute side?)

1415
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:43,920
(A sexy clip deserves another look.)

1416
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:46,180
You should go with a sexy theme. That suits you well.

1417
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:49,730
(What kind of performance will Sun Jia Yang put on?)

1418
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,870
He has a cute, boyish charm.

1419
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:53,300
They look cute.

1420
01:08:53,301 --> 01:08:54,576
(The youthful team, Team Beijing, has experienced participants.)

1421
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,170
Sun Jia Yang is super cute.

1422
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:58,540
I want him to be my younger brother.

1423
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,080
Sun Jia Yang has a refreshing charm.

1424
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,480
He's cute.

1425
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,449
Judging by your facial expressions and attitudes,

1426
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:08,079
I'm getting a feeling that you're going for the cute look.

1427
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,480
Am I right?

1428
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:13,650
Yes, that's right. We prepared a cheerful and energetic song too.

1429
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:16,290
Well, if you're going for the cute look,

1430
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:17,790
show us your cute acts.

1431
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:19,630
(It's time to check out their cute acts.)

1432
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:21,130
(Cute acts?)

1433
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:26,130
All right. Three, two, one.

1434
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,340
(Letting his guard down)

1435
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:32,510
One.

1436
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:34,780
(A cute clip deserves another look.)

1437
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:38,209
He doesn't have to do anything. He's already cute.

1438
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:39,309
- It wasn't over the top. - Right.

1439
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:40,680
That was nice.

1440
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:42,450
I've already become Sun Jia Yang's fan.

1441
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:44,890
If cute charms are the deciding factor,

1442
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:46,950
I'd be in the top ten.

1443
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:49,190
(Sun Jia Yang is confident about his cute charms.)

1444
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,730
Even his name sounds cute. Sun Jia Yang.

1445
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:54,030
My gosh.

1446
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:56,029
- I'm sorry. Did you hear that? - The name...

1447
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:57,406
(Only Sun Jia Yang should do the cute act.)

1448
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:59,900
(What kind of performance did Team Beijing prepare?)

1449
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:01,469
We prepared to perform...

1450
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:03,570
Boy Story's "Pump! t Up" today.

1451
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:06,270
(Boy Story?)

1452
01:10:06,370 --> 01:10:07,440
They're here.

1453
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:09,040
It's a huge honour.

1454
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,350
- Good luck. - Good luck.

1455
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:16,719
(Boy Story's refreshing charm stands out in "Pump! t Up.")

1456
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:19,040
(Jia Han Yu, Li Zi Hao, and He Xin Long wrote the lyrics.)

1457
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:21,660
(They will perform in front of the original singers.)

1458
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:24,260
The original singers are going to watch this?

1459
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,460
- Good luck. - They're the real judges now.

1460
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:30,829
(During breaktime before the performance)

1461
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:33,770
It feels surreal that we'll perform in front of the original singers.

1462
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:35,600
I'm a bit scared.

1463
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:39,310
(We're watching you.)

1464
01:10:39,370 --> 01:10:40,940
I'm very scared right now.

1465
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,980
(I'm scared.)

1466
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:45,280
I'm getting a mental breakdown.

1467
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:48,280
Seriously. I'm having a mental breakdown.

1468
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:50,450
- How can we ask them? - Just go to them straight.

1469
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,950
Say hello to them. Say, "Hello, sir."

1470
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:54,619
(Help me out here.)

1471
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:56,666
(The little lamb musters up his courage and approach them.)

1472
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:57,989
May I sit with you guys?

1473
01:10:57,990 --> 01:10:59,160
Go ahead.

1474
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:01,960
Well...

1475
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,030
(What brings him here?)

1476
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:07,200
(You can do this.)

1477
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:08,440
How old are you?

1478
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:10,800
I'm 19 years old.

1479
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:12,990
Why do you look so much younger?

1480
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:14,780
You look like a four-year-old.

1481
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:17,310
(They tease him, so he won't be so nervous.)

1482
01:11:17,410 --> 01:11:21,150
Did you know that we're performing your song for our performance?

1483
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:22,619
Yes, we know.

1484
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:25,020
- It's "Pump! t Up." - So...

1485
01:11:25,390 --> 01:11:29,590
Is there any tip you can share with us regarding the performance?

1486
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,729
- Look cheerful and innocent. - Cheerful and innocent.

1487
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:33,159
The one in the center must look hip.

1488
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,606
And the rest of you should focus on keeping up with the choreography.

1489
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:36,476
That way, the one in the center will stand out.

1490
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:37,620
Just smile when you perform.

1491
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:39,169
- I see. Smile. - "Everybody..."

1492
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:41,170
We'll do our best to deliver a good performance.

1493
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:42,739
(His mission is complete.)

1494
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:45,021
(He manages to get the advice from the original singers.)

1495
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:47,880
(Good luck, Team Beijing!)

1496
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:50,140
(We got this!)

1497
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:52,049
Dancing in front of the original singers...

1498
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:53,480
must be a lot of pressure.

1499
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:55,820
The pressure would've driven me to death if I were them.

1500
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,560
The members of Boy Story are standing up.

1501
01:11:57,850 --> 01:11:59,120
They'll watch standing up.

1502
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:01,100
That's the best form of respect.

1503
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:03,360
How cute. Do well.

1504
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:07,630
(How will their version of "Pump! t Up" look?)

1505
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:10,159
("Pump! t Up" by Boy Story)

1506
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:12,600
(Performed by Sun Jia Yang, Qi Lin, Chrisen Yang, He Jun Jin)

1507
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:34,360
He's cute.

1508
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,320
He's cuter than me.

1509
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:38,660
My gosh, he's so cute.

1510
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,270
Yes!

1511
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,090
They're good.

1512
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:15,700
Okay.

1513
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,340
That's such a cute part.

1514
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,110
Hey!

1515
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:43,360
(Staggering)

1516
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:48,599
(Their performance begins...)

1517
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:51,500
(and ends with a cute act.)

1518
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:57,570
Boy Story seems happy with it.

1519
01:13:58,270 --> 01:13:59,640
How adorable.

1520
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:02,010
The guy in the white shirt is so cute, bro.

1521
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,010
He has a small build, but he's got big energy.

1522
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,450
Watching this performance makes me want to learn the choreography.

1523
01:14:08,150 --> 01:14:10,880
(He can't say no to dancing even when he's sleepy.)

1524
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:12,966
(Team Beijing has won over the hearts of the participants.)

1525
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:15,160
(How will the Masters evaluate?)

1526
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:16,719
- They did a good job. - They're good.

1527
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:17,790
Everyone is good.

1528
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:19,460
But...

1529
01:14:20,430 --> 01:14:23,260
- no one left an impression on me. - Same here.

1530
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,729
(Their feedback is not ideal unlike the expectations.)

1531
01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:27,330
(What are the results for Team Beijing?)

1532
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:29,176
I doubt anyone will end up in the No Star Class.

1533
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,440
They were all very expressive.

1534
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,539
Gosh, we were so busy discussing this among ourselves.

1535
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:35,980
We forgot to give you our feedback.

1536
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:38,610
All right. Team Beijing. You're experienced participants.

1537
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:42,150
Does this mean we loved your performance that much?

1538
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:47,620
I want the stars even if it's just one.

1539
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:50,790
We'll announce your classes.

1540
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:56,660
I'm nervous. Why am I nervous, though?

1541
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:58,630
Two Star? One Star?

1542
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:00,970
Sun Jia Yang.

1543
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,970
The atmosphere seemed nice, though.

1544
01:15:04,070 --> 01:15:05,869
(If this is about cute charms, he'll be in the All Star Class.)

1545
01:15:05,870 --> 01:15:07,670
(What will Sun Jia Yang's class be?)

1546
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:13,880
You're in the All Star Class. Congratulations.

1547
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:21,560
You received high scores...

1548
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:24,220
from 5 of the 7 Masters here.

1549
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:28,030
(Right after their performance...)

1550
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:29,700
Gosh, I must be going crazy.

1551
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:32,476
(It means he loved the performance like crazy.)

1552
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:33,730
Gosh, he's so cute.

1553
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:35,599
To be honest, no one except for him...

1554
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,540
- left an impression on me. - Same here.

1555
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,710
Out of all the participants we evaluated so far,

1556
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:41,340
he's the best idol material.

1557
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:43,410
He's very good.

1558
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:47,150
His movements were clean even during the parts that weren't his.

1559
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:49,079
His singing was stable...

1560
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,680
even when he had danced energetically.

1561
01:15:52,050 --> 01:15:53,819
(He Jun Jin: 2 Star, Sun Jia Yang, All Star, )

1562
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:55,520
(Chrisen Yang: 1 Star, Qi Lin: No Star)

1563
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:58,089
I can't believe I'm in the All Star Class.

1564
01:15:58,090 --> 01:15:59,930
I only dreamed of being placed there.

1565
01:16:01,230 --> 01:16:03,270
I'm going to treat it as if my life depended on it.

1566
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:07,270
I'm placed in the All Star Class. I ought to give it my all.

1567
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:13,370
(I'll give it my 100 percent and become a better person. Let's go!)

1568
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:16,510
(The Class Placement Match is getting heated as it progresses.)

1569
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,410
Let's continue with the next team.

1570
01:16:20,610 --> 01:16:21,850
(Surprised)

1571
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,250
- My gosh. - Gosh.

1572
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:27,019
(Experienced participants, Team Ningbo, are up next.)

1573
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:28,020
Ningbo.

1574
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:30,790
Hey, what's up?

1575
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:32,190
Let's go!

1576
01:16:33,530 --> 01:16:35,760
(Make some noise!)

1577
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:38,199
Why are they cheering for Team Ningbo?

1578
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,369
- Are they cheering for the region? - I wonder why too.

1579
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:41,600
Hello, everyone. We are...

1580
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:44,669
- Dragon Boys. - Dragon Boys.

1581
01:16:44,670 --> 01:16:46,410
Only one of them surely stands out.

1582
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,980
- Lin Qui Nan. - Check out his vibe.

1583
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:51,980
I had no idea Lin Qui Nan would be on the show.

1584
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:53,930
There goes another spot in the debut team.

1585
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:57,620
Lin Qui Nan filmed a movie with Jackie Chan.

1586
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:03,490
I started learning taekwondo at the age of six.

1587
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:05,310
I've been practising it for ten years.

1588
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:10,100
I won over 300 medals from minor and major competitions.

1589
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:15,500
One day, I won a big award at a competition. Ever since then,

1590
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:19,540
people in the film industry started to show an interest in me.

1591
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:23,040
And two months ago,

1592
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:27,950
I filmed an action movie with Jackie Chan in Macau.

1593
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:30,019
(During breaktime)

1594
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:33,349
Last month, I just finished my movie with Jackie Chan.

1595
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:36,190
- For real? - Of course, I'm not lying to you.

1596
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,629
Do you know who else was there? JUN of SEVENTEEN.

1597
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:40,630
- Really? - Yes. He's my friend.

1598
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:42,350
Do you know how many followers he has?

1599
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:43,800
A hundred thousand?

1600
01:17:44,030 --> 01:17:46,000
I'll tell you. I have six million fans.

1601
01:17:46,230 --> 01:17:47,469
- Really? - Yes.

1602
01:17:47,470 --> 01:17:50,240
My gosh. You're a real celebrity.

1603
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:51,909
(How will his journey to become a K-pop idol turn out?)

1604
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:52,969
We look forward to an amazing performance from you.

1605
01:17:52,970 --> 01:17:54,040
Please get ready.

1606
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:55,840
Let's go!

1607
01:17:55,940 --> 01:17:57,280
- Let's go! - My gosh.

1608
01:17:58,050 --> 01:17:59,080
Lin Qui Nan!

1609
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:00,480
Get ready.

1610
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:07,190
That's an original way of getting ready.

1611
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,830
Actually, I wanted to participate in the 1st season 2 years ago.

1612
01:18:12,930 --> 01:18:16,829
But I couldn't participate because I had to shoot the movie.

1613
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:19,930
This year, I made sure to take time out of my schedule for this show.

1614
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:21,640
I will get the best results.

1615
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:23,599
Gosh, I'm looking forward to this.

1616
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:24,700
Something big is coming.

1617
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:29,579
("TURN UP" by Nick Chou)

1618
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:32,300
(Performed by Dong Jing Kun, Lin Qui Nan, Zhang Shun Yu, Chen Yu Qi)

1619
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:36,119
Their movements look disciplined, indeed.

1620
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,280
They're perfectly in sync.

1621
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:57,800
Let's go!

1622
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:00,410
Let's go!

1623
01:19:08,350 --> 01:19:10,230
- Lin Qui Nan fell, right? - He made a mistake.

1624
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:42,950
Go!

1625
01:19:46,290 --> 01:19:48,020
I got goosebumps.

1626
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:52,630
- Go! - That was so high.

1627
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Turn up

1628
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:03,400
What's up with this team?

1629
01:20:06,170 --> 01:20:07,540
Dong Jing Kun is amazing.

1630
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,420
What in the...

1631
01:20:18,190 --> 01:20:19,219
That was so cool.

1632
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:21,020
- That pumped me up. - Gosh, that was nice.

1633
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:23,790
- He went so high. - All Star!

1634
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:29,699
Maybe it's because you did taekwondo,

1635
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,800
but I thought your moves looked very disciplined.

1636
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:35,700
You showed the audience a performance worth cheering for.

1637
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:37,669
All four of you rapped,

1638
01:20:37,670 --> 01:20:41,170
but this participant had a particularly good tone.

1639
01:20:43,310 --> 01:20:46,280
Participant Dong Jing Kun.

1640
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:49,750
At first, when you started rapping, it was so good.

1641
01:20:50,750 --> 01:20:53,270
(Dong Jing Kun caught Justhis' attention with his unique tone.)

1642
01:20:54,590 --> 01:20:57,590
At first, when you started rapping, it was so good.

1643
01:20:58,090 --> 01:21:00,990
I thought you had a good tone for rapping.

1644
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:02,430
And today,

1645
01:21:04,730 --> 01:21:07,900
participant Zhang Shun Yu...

1646
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:13,140
I thought you had a distinctive tone and you did well.

1647
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:15,480
I enjoyed your performance.

1648
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:20,050
I think there will be 2 or 3 All Stars at most.

1649
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:22,096
The guy on the left will get All Star for sure.

1650
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,819
And I think Lin Qui Nan will get it too.

1651
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:27,390
I think the other 2 will get 2 Stars.

1652
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:32,690
Dong Jing Kun from Team Ningbo with experienced participants...

1653
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:36,229
You are in the All Star Class.

1654
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:38,200
(Team Ningbo's Dong Jing Kun, All Star)

1655
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:40,670
Thank you.

1656
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:42,470
He deserves All Star.

1657
01:21:42,970 --> 01:21:45,210
Next, participant Zhang Shun Yu.

1658
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:48,639
You are in the Two Star Class.

1659
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,120
(Team Ningbo's Zhang Shun Yu, 2 Star)

1660
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:55,120
Next, participant Lin Qui Nan.

1661
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,440
There's a possibility that Lin Qui Nan gets All Star.

1662
01:21:58,490 --> 01:22:00,150
I think Lin Qui Nan will get All Star.

1663
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:05,560
- All Star. - All Star.

1664
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:07,189
You are in the One Star Class.

1665
01:22:07,190 --> 01:22:08,476
(Team Ningbo's Lin Qui Nan, 1 Star)

1666
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:09,700
You are in the One Star Class.

1667
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,230
Oh, man.

1668
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:12,700
Oh, my gosh.

1669
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:14,100
You are in the One Star Class.

1670
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:17,770
(Lin Qui Nan got the lowest class in his team.)

1671
01:22:20,570 --> 01:22:21,880
Why did I get One Star?

1672
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:26,050
You seem particularly nervous today.

1673
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:28,150
Aside from your mistake where you fell...

1674
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:29,380
Let's go!

1675
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:36,219
Your facial expressions or gestures didn't seem natural.

1676
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:39,290
Your nervousness seemed to come through a little more.

1677
01:22:40,290 --> 01:22:41,450
Thank you for your hard work.

1678
01:22:48,770 --> 01:22:51,740
I made a mistake that only rookies would make on stage.

1679
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:54,570
I feel really bad.

1680
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:57,880
I just ruined it.

1681
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:01,349
Since they had techniques, your eyes are drawn to them.

1682
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:02,919
Didn't he jump about 3m high?

1683
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:04,180
It was over 3m.

1684
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,519
He went up to the third floor.

1685
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,019
I'm so curious about the next team.

1686
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:09,236
(Who will perform after the talented and experienced Team Ningbo?)

1687
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:10,660
Who is it?

1688
01:23:11,490 --> 01:23:13,029
(Experienced participants in K-pop)

1689
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:14,089
(Finally, here come the experienced participants in K-pop!)

1690
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:15,930
Experienced participants in K-pop.

1691
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,300
They're the first ones.

1692
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,800
I'm curious how good the experienced participants in K-pop will be.

1693
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:25,110
Please come on out.

1694
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:28,510
- Hello. - Hello, we're 16-year-old trainees.

1695
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:30,079
They're babies.

1696
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,240
They were born in 2009?

1697
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:33,350
Oh, one of them is an active idol now.

1698
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:36,480
I'm a member of the K-pop idol group, EASTSHINE.

1699
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:39,300
Even an active member of an idol group is here.

1700
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:41,519
My position on the team is the youngest member.

1701
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:42,689
(I'm the youngest member.)

1702
01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:43,719
At his age, he's living in Korea...

1703
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:44,889
- all by himself. - He's 16 years old.

1704
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:48,529
When you left your family and came to Korea,

1705
01:23:48,530 --> 01:23:50,060
wasn't it hard for you?

1706
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:52,130
I also miss my mom a lot, and...

1707
01:23:52,830 --> 01:23:54,830
Yes, I'm really sad.

1708
01:23:55,370 --> 01:23:57,739
Participant Wong Sik Hei, do you miss your mom a lot?

1709
01:23:57,740 --> 01:23:58,809
Yes.

1710
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:01,270
Can you look at the camera and send your mom a video message?

1711
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:03,410
In the front here.

1712
01:24:10,950 --> 01:24:13,390
Don't do this. The baby will cry.

1713
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:16,389
Hi, Mom.

1714
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:18,489
(Hi, Mom.)

1715
01:24:18,490 --> 01:24:19,990
I miss you a lot.

1716
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:23,000
I'll make you proud by being here.

1717
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:25,950
And thank you so much for always supporting me, no matter what.

1718
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:28,200
Thank you.

1719
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:32,470
Gosh, I want to cry too. I miss my mom.

1720
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:36,140
I'm really about to cry.

1721
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:40,930
Has it been a long time since you've lived apart from your mom?

1722
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:46,220
Yesterday...

1723
01:24:46,690 --> 01:24:47,820
I saw her yesterday.

1724
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:50,289
- You saw your mom yesterday? - What's this?

1725
01:24:50,290 --> 01:24:52,290
(Everyone is flabbergasted.)

1726
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:53,860
That was unexpected.

1727
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:56,220
All right. Please get ready for your performance.

1728
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,700
Shall we see how good the experienced participants are?

1729
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:00,400
Let's go.

1730
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:03,399
("Earth, Wind, and Fire" by BOYNEXTDOOR)

1731

(Performed by Wong Sik Hei and Phoenix)

1732
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:07,440
BOYS II PLANET C, let's go!

1733
01:25:32,970 --> 01:25:34,529
Gosh...

1734
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:35,640
This is...

1735
01:25:37,770 --> 01:25:39,440
To be honest,

1736
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:41,510
- that was all over the place. - It was.

1737
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:42,840
Nothing was in sync.

1738
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:45,650
In the level of experienced participants in K-pop,

1739
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:48,010
this was rather disappointing.

1740
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:49,720
They're so strict.

1741
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:51,860
If that team gets One Star, we'll get No Stars.

1742
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:53,319
(Experienced participants in K-pop)

1743
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,320
(Amid the serious mood, more experienced participants appear.)

1744
01:25:54,321 --> 01:25:56,490
We'll meet the next participant.

1745
01:25:59,390 --> 01:26:01,660
- He definitely looks pretty. - He's beautiful.

1746
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:05,000
Your looks really caught my eye.

1747
01:26:05,530 --> 01:26:08,130
Is there anything in particular that you do to manage your looks?

1748
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:10,470
(His secret weapon)

(A makeup box)

1750
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:14,986
This is a gua sha. It gets rid of puffiness in your face.

1751
01:26:15,010 --> 01:26:16,479
I always take care of my hair.

1752
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:18,280
This is what I do to look prettier on screen.

1753
01:26:18,610 --> 01:26:20,180
I think looks are really important.

1754
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:24,080
Skincare, makeup, and hair.

1755
01:26:24,950 --> 01:26:26,590
Oh, I did my nails too.

1756
01:26:28,050 --> 01:26:30,010
I did it at home by myself, early in the morning.

1757
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:31,930
Master Justhis has nail art too.

1758
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:34,430
You do your nails?

1759
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:38,400
(Master Justhis' unexpected charm)

1760
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:40,810
That participant went to the finals on a different show.

1761
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:44,160
("Candy" by NCT DREAM performed by Xie Bing Hua)

1762
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:46,670
Candy!

1763

Candy!

1764
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:26,540
I think he's going to get No Star.

1765
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:31,020
Oh, dear. What will we do?

1766
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:33,720
I feel like he's in a dangerous situation.

1767
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:35,290
I was...

1768
01:27:35,890 --> 01:27:37,020
a little angry.

1769
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:40,030
Gosh, that's scary.

1770
01:27:40,660 --> 01:27:42,230
That was like a school talent show.

1771
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:48,130
I started losing my voice since yesterday.

1772
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:52,010
If your vocal cords aren't in good condition,

1773
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:56,440
couldn't you have tried harder to dance better?

1774
01:27:57,110 --> 01:27:59,810
- He's seriously angry. - It's understandable.

1775
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:02,661
If you're not feeling well, why not go and get some rest?

1776
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:05,550
I should say that I'm sick before my next performance too.

1777
01:28:09,290 --> 01:28:10,489
I was disappointed.

1778
01:28:10,490 --> 01:28:12,850
I thought he should've given a more impressive performance.

1779
01:28:13,130 --> 01:28:14,760
He had to look better than me.

1780
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:16,760
My gosh.

1781
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:19,029
- Gosh. - This is tough.

1782
01:28:19,030 --> 01:28:21,999
What do we do? We have to find someone.

1783
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,169
Especially from the experienced participants in K-pop.

1784
01:28:23,170 --> 01:28:26,709
Right. Their performances were a lot more disappointing.

1785
01:28:26,710 --> 01:28:28,109
Their performances were relatively more disappointing.

1786
01:28:28,110 --> 01:28:30,580
It's because they must've been under the supervision...

1787
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,150
of their teachers in their agencies.

1788
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:33,250
This is tough.

1789
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:36,720
We'll move on to the next group.

1790
01:28:37,450 --> 01:28:39,649
Experienced participant in K-pop

1791
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:40,749
(Where is the next experienced participant in K-pop from?)

1792
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:43,490
- Gosh! - Hey!

1793
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:45,929
- My goodness! - It's iNKODE!

1794
01:28:45,930 --> 01:28:46,960
Gosh.

1795
01:28:47,830 --> 01:28:49,199
INKODE is next.

1796
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,200
(1 minute ago)

1797
01:28:50,201 --> 01:28:52,399
- The CEO is feeling nervous. - What? It's iNKODE right away?

1798
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,400
There are participants from iNKODE too.

1799
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:56,440
INKODE is the company Jae Joong established.

1800
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:58,639
("Kim Jae Joong Has Founded New Agency")

1801
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:00,116
(iNKODE, the agency founded by K-pop legend, Kim Jae Joong)

1802
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:04,780
(He started making idol groups starting with SAY MY NAME.)

1803
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,450
So he's the CEO.

1804
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:09,049
When the participants from iNKODE are up,

1805
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:11,750
Jae Joong's vote will be taken away from him.

1806
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:18,590
My goodness. They are participants of the Chief Master's agency.

1807
01:29:18,690 --> 01:29:21,330
Team iNKODE, please come up on stage.

1808
01:29:21,660 --> 01:29:23,059
They are from the Chief Master's agency?

1809
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:24,060
Right.

1810
01:29:24,061 --> 01:29:25,360
(Really?)

1811
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:27,529
They are finally here.

1812
01:29:27,530 --> 01:29:28,569
(Team iNKODE enters while feeling very shy.)

1813
01:29:28,570 --> 01:29:30,070
(Feeling shy)

1814
01:29:30,170 --> 01:29:31,670
They must feel so nervous.

1815
01:29:31,770 --> 01:29:34,810
And he's not even in the corner. He's right in the middle.

1816
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:37,979
I knew that they were going to participate,

1817
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:41,380
but these two wouldn't have known that I was going to be here.

1818
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:46,220
(The moment the Chief Master entered)

1819
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:50,460
What? Hold on.

1820
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:53,060
Why is our CEO here?

1821
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:55,360
He's our agency's CEO.

1822
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:59,146
- You were surprised, weren't you? - I see.

1823
01:29:59,170 --> 01:30:01,100
- They just found out earlier? - That's amazing.

1824
01:30:01,670 --> 01:30:02,870
That would be really shocking.

1825
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:06,569
May I ask how long you two have been trainees for?

1826
01:30:06,570 --> 01:30:08,940
It's been for around five months.

1827
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:11,309
- That isn't that long. - Five months?

1828
01:30:11,310 --> 01:30:14,580
It's been for around two years.

1829
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:15,820
Two years?

1830
01:30:15,850 --> 01:30:17,150
There's quite a difference.

1831
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,119
It's the Class Placement Match.

1832
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:23,189
- Gosh. I'm feeling nervous. - Let's begin. Please get ready.

1833
01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:24,260
- Okay. - Okay.

1834
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:25,360
Let's go!

1835
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:28,260
I will evaluate them a lot more objectively.

1836
01:30:31,330 --> 01:30:32,569
("CROWN" by TOMORROW X TOGETHER...)

1837
01:30:32,570 --> 01:30:33,890
(performed by Sen and He Jia Hao)

1838
01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:22,220
Sen is quite talented.

1839
01:31:37,430 --> 01:31:40,869
(The masters look grim after the performance.)

1840
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:42,300
(Peeking)

1841
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:45,369
(Feeling anxious)

1842
01:31:45,370 --> 01:31:47,269
I think there's something growing on your head, Jae Joong.

1843
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:50,640
Don't talk to me. Just go ahead with the evaluation.

1844
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:52,680
Something growing on his head?

1845
01:31:52,910 --> 01:31:54,379
(What will they think about Team iNKODE?)

1846
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:56,820
I'll start with Sen.

1847
01:31:57,580 --> 01:31:59,920
Your stability as a vocalist is incredible.

1848
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:01,790
- Yes. - Right.

1849
01:32:01,790 --> 01:32:02,790
(He's right!)

1850
01:32:02,791 --> 01:32:05,360
On the other hand, He Jia Hao,

1851
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:09,600
most of your notes throughout the song were flat.

1852
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:13,700
(He Jia Hao looked unstable while singing out of tune.)

1853
01:32:13,930 --> 01:32:15,299
There was quite a difference with the time as trainees,

1854
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:18,269
but I believe Sen's singing was a lot better.

1855
01:32:18,270 --> 01:32:20,310
This is what I want to point out. Thank you.

1856
01:32:20,970 --> 01:32:23,880
- He Jia Hao? He was nervous. - Right.

1857
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:26,880
(It's time for the masters to discuss their classes.)

1858
01:32:28,550 --> 01:32:33,249
(A heavy breath of silence passes by.)

1859
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:35,689
Was there someone who got an All Star...

1860
01:32:35,690 --> 01:32:38,120
out of the experienced participants in K-pop?

1861
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:39,260
Not yet.

1862
01:32:40,190 --> 01:32:43,500
Sen has been training for only five months.

1863
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,999
- He's a strong All Star candidate. - I know.

1864
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,570
I think He Jia Hao will get either a One or Two Star.

1865
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:52,370
I will start with Sen.

1866
01:32:52,710 --> 01:32:53,810
Sen, we are placing you...

1867
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:56,379
in the Two Star Class.

1868
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:57,460
(Team iNKODE's Sen, 2 Star)

1869
01:32:57,580 --> 01:32:59,050
He's only in the Two Star Class?

1870
01:32:59,150 --> 01:33:00,990
Then He Jia Hao will be in the One Star Class.

1871
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:02,620
And He Jia Hao.

1872
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:04,319
One Star.

1873
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:05,420
- One Star? - Right.

1874
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:10,920
I think this is right if we are to be objective.

1875
01:33:14,690 --> 01:33:17,090
(What is He Jia Hao's class with his disappointing singing?)

1876
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:19,629
We are placing you in the No Star Class.

1877
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:22,030
(Team iNKODE's He Jia Hao gets placed in the No Star Class.)

1878
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,169
I think it was because he was an experienced participant in K-pop.

1879
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:28,250
There was that much more of an expectation from him.

1880
01:33:28,910 --> 01:33:32,040
I couldn't believe it.

1881
01:33:33,410 --> 01:33:35,719
Is there another song prepared for the extra test...

1882
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:38,320
to make up for your No Star performance?

1883
01:33:38,650 --> 01:33:39,750
Yes.

1884
01:33:39,850 --> 01:33:41,220
- Okay. That's good. - Let's go.

1885
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:43,320
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1886
01:33:44,260 --> 01:33:45,460
(Extra test)

1887
01:33:45,590 --> 01:33:48,490
(He Jia Hao prepares for the extra test.)

1888
01:33:50,730 --> 01:33:53,570
- Do well, Hao! - Okay!

1889
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,500
(Sighing)

1890
01:33:59,270 --> 01:34:02,139
Why did you let out such a long sigh?

1891
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:03,140
Exactly.

1892
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:13,790
("Who" by Liao Juntao performed by He Jia Hao)

1893
01:34:36,310 --> 01:34:37,340
Thank you.

1894
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:43,650
(What did the masters think about the performance?)

1895
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:45,860
Won't they put him in the One Star Class?

1896
01:34:46,450 --> 01:34:48,619
He Jia Hao, we are placing you...

1897
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:49,780
(What is He Jia Hao's class?)

1898
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:53,059
in the No Star Class.

1899
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:54,189
(Team iNKODE's He Jia Hao gets placed in the No Star Class.)

1900
01:34:54,190 --> 01:34:55,190
Right.

1901
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,100
Thank you.

1902
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:01,100
We are placing you in the No Star Class.

1903
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:07,510
Gosh, how can this happen?

1904
01:35:08,310 --> 01:35:10,010
My gosh.

1905
01:35:10,610 --> 01:35:15,049
All of the participants that are here with the same dream...

1906
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:17,750
are working hard to sing and dance...

1907
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:19,420
on the same stage.

1908
01:35:19,850 --> 01:35:24,460
That was why we had to be objective with our evaluation.

1909
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:26,030
Please make sure to understand that.

1910
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:29,530
I don't think I would've been able to say that in his position.

1911
01:35:29,630 --> 01:35:30,990
How would he be feeling right now?

1912
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:35,330
After going through this experience, I hope that you will...

1913
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:37,400
work 2 to 3 times harder.

1914
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:39,240
Right. Understood, sir.

1915
01:35:45,710 --> 01:35:46,750
It's okay.

1916
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:49,620
Don't cry.

1917
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:51,520
Good luck!

1918
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:52,889
Gosh.

1919
01:35:52,890 --> 01:35:54,790
Sen has to do well now.

1920
01:35:54,890 --> 01:35:56,760
- Right. - Until the end.

1921
01:35:57,620 --> 01:35:59,260
Sen should try to survive until the end.

1922
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:09,370
(His tears won't stop out of disappointment.)

1923
01:36:12,370 --> 01:36:14,610
I'm sorry, sir. I have disappointed you.

1924
01:36:16,210 --> 01:36:18,040
I will work hard to become a better person.

1925
01:36:24,220 --> 01:36:25,679
The CEO would feel even worse.

1926
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:27,590
This is upsetting and heartbreaking.

1927
01:36:27,690 --> 01:36:30,120
No way.

1928
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:32,320
I'm so hungry.

1929
01:36:33,930 --> 01:36:35,930
(They're tired, hungry, and don't feel warmed up.)

1930
01:36:36,430 --> 01:36:37,500
I want some pizza.

1931
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:40,230
(Eating in his imagination)

1932
01:36:42,540 --> 01:36:43,570
Eat all you want.

1933
01:36:43,970 --> 01:36:45,300
I'm so hungry.

1934
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,840
- Enjoy your meal. - Enjoy your meal.

1935
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:50,379
- Oh, my gosh! - Gosh!

1936
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:52,809
- It's so good! - Thank you.

1937
01:36:52,810 --> 01:36:54,109
(The dining areas are separated based on class.)

1938
01:36:54,110 --> 01:36:55,410
Gosh, this is so good!

1939
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:57,150
The meat is delicious.

1940
01:36:57,880 --> 01:36:59,790
(Eating wildly)

1941
01:36:59,950 --> 01:37:01,249
(Makeup room)

1942
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:02,289
What is this?

1943
01:37:02,290 --> 01:37:04,619
(The participants are dolling themselves up after eating.)

1944
01:37:04,620 --> 01:37:08,630
The regular participants were good.

1945
01:37:09,130 --> 01:37:11,810
You're talking about the team that did the ZEROBASEONE song, right?

1946
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:16,170
(Team Shanghai produced the first All Star Class.)

1947
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:17,870
They were amazing.

1948
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:20,840
The experienced participants in K-pop.

1949
01:37:21,270 --> 01:37:23,040
Out of those participants,

1950
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:25,680
weren't there some that didn't do really well?

1951
01:37:26,150 --> 01:37:28,309
They're just participants from K-pop agencies.

1952
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:30,750
It doesn't necessarily mean they're that talented.

1953
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,040
I understand why He Jia Hao got eliminated.

1954
01:37:33,690 --> 01:37:36,560
He did do worse than Sen who was on his team.

1955
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:39,929
It's okay.

1956
01:37:39,930 --> 01:37:41,129
(The waiting room of the experienced ones feels down.)

1957
01:37:41,130 --> 01:37:43,300
The standards were quite high today.

1958
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:46,130
The regular participants were given good scores.

1959
01:37:46,230 --> 01:37:47,876
The scores given for the experienced participants in K-pop...

1960
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:50,600
were quite harsh.

1961
01:37:51,270 --> 01:37:53,139
(The experienced participants in K-pop...)

1962
01:37:53,140 --> 01:37:54,460
(get placed in the 1 Star Class.)

1963
01:37:56,780 --> 01:37:58,079
(You are placed in the No Star Class.)

1964
01:37:58,080 --> 01:37:59,080
Seriously?

1965
01:37:59,650 --> 01:38:01,009
(The experienced participants in K-pop...)

1966
01:38:01,010 --> 01:38:02,349
(were given lower classes than what was expected.)

1967
01:38:02,350 --> 01:38:05,680
(Won't Boy Story get placed in the 2 Star Class at this rate?)

1968
01:38:06,390 --> 01:38:09,819
(I kept trying to stay on my toes.)

1969
01:38:09,820 --> 01:38:13,860
(I thought that I had to work much harder.)

1970
01:38:13,990 --> 01:38:17,929
(The ongoing challenge of charming participants)

1971
01:38:17,930 --> 01:38:21,599
(Will they show a performance that exceeds expectations?)

1972
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:25,069
(Class Placement Match at crossroads of survival and elimination)

1973
01:38:25,070 --> 01:38:29,539
(Which participant will leave with No Star Class?)

1974
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:32,279
(The next hot topic team to appear)

1975
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:34,849
(Boy Story, an idol in their 8th year since debut)

1976
01:38:34,850 --> 01:38:37,980
(Will they be able to prove their abilities?)

1977
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:41,989
We will then meet the next participant.

1978
01:38:41,990 --> 01:38:43,536
(Class Placement Match continues with disappointing results.)

1979
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:44,819
(The next performance is done by...)

1980
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:46,500
He is an experienced participant in K-pop.

1981
01:38:47,330 --> 01:38:49,130
He is an individual participant.

1982
01:38:49,730 --> 01:38:50,730
Individual participant?

1983
01:38:51,230 --> 01:38:52,230
Individual participant?

1984
01:38:52,231 --> 01:38:53,970
(Sun Heng Yu)

1985
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:57,500
(Who is the participant that participated as an Individual Team?)

1986
01:39:01,170 --> 01:39:02,170
Hello.

1987
01:39:02,710 --> 01:39:06,280
I'm an individual trainee. K-pop...

1988
01:39:07,850 --> 01:39:09,690
(Participant Sun Heng Yu seems to be nervous.)

1989
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:13,720
- It's okay. - Slowly.

1990
01:39:14,420 --> 01:39:17,420
I'm an experienced participant in K-pop, Sun Heng Yu.

1991
01:39:18,590 --> 01:39:20,359
I have experience...

1992
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:23,130
being in a K-pop idol group before.

1993
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:26,630
(He debuted as BLANK2Y.)

1994
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:29,870
(Participant Sun Heng Yu was in a K-pop boy group.)

1995
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:32,810
He debuted in Korea before.

1996
01:39:33,340 --> 01:39:34,910
It's a group I've never heard of.

1997
01:39:35,170 --> 01:39:37,110
It's a group without much recognition.

1998
01:39:38,140 --> 01:39:41,579
In fact, while I was active,

1999
01:39:41,580 --> 01:39:45,150
I've met Master Kim Jae Joong before.

2000
01:39:46,550 --> 01:39:48,120
Have you heard of BLANK2Y?

2001
01:39:50,990 --> 01:39:52,360
BLANK2Y...

2002
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:54,760
(Drawing all attention)

2003
01:39:54,761 --> 01:39:56,630
(BLANK2Y...)

2004
01:39:57,060 --> 01:39:58,830
(Nervous with anticipation)

2005
01:40:00,930 --> 01:40:02,970
Honestly, I don't really remember.

2006
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:04,140
It's okay.

2007
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:09,379
I think that after watching your performance today,

2008
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:12,079
it will be decided whether you’ll be a name that will be remembered...

2009
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:14,909
or a name that will not be remembered...

2010
01:40:14,910 --> 01:40:16,010
(Gulp)

2011
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:17,779
in the future.

2012
01:40:17,780 --> 01:40:19,850
- I hope you'll do your best. - Yes.

2013
01:40:22,290 --> 01:40:24,319
After BLANK2Y's last stage,

2014
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:26,159
we took a break for one year.

2015
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:28,390
And eventually the team broke up.

2016
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:32,030
After that, the company disregarded me.

2017
01:40:35,230 --> 01:40:37,869
I looked for part-time jobs due to financial problems.

2018
01:40:37,870 --> 01:40:41,770
Even when I was working, I kept thinking of myself on stage.

2019
01:40:43,410 --> 01:40:46,650
That's why I want to show myself on stage more.

2020
01:40:47,810 --> 01:40:50,210
I would be grateful if you could see me with a generous eye.

2021
01:40:53,790 --> 01:40:55,649
- Well done. - Are we done?

2022
01:40:55,650 --> 01:40:56,659
I can do a girl group dance...

2023
01:40:56,660 --> 01:40:58,140
- as a special skill. - Oh, I forgot.

2024
01:40:59,490 --> 01:41:01,230
Well done.

2025
01:41:01,330 --> 01:41:02,330
(Right!)

2026
01:41:02,331 --> 01:41:04,030
I'll try singing a pop song.

2027
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:05,160
Let's see.

2028
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:06,769
I'll sing "The Little Prince."

2029
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:07,800
I'll do beatbox.

2030
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:11,470
(He did his best in the preliminary audition.)

2031
01:41:13,670 --> 01:41:17,080
I washed grills and dishes at a barbecue restaurant.

2032
01:41:17,180 --> 01:41:20,350
I used to work 12 hours a day.

2033
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:24,380
But even after the team broke up...

2034
01:41:24,650 --> 01:41:26,450
the only thing I could do was sing and dance.

2035
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:29,350
Without it...

2036
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:34,790
That's what a singer is.

2037
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:37,500
That's all there is.

2038
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:39,830
Right.

2039
01:41:40,570 --> 01:41:42,400
I really think this is my last chance.

2040
01:41:42,770 --> 01:41:45,170
I came here thinking about giving up.

2041
01:41:46,910 --> 01:41:48,440
(Gosh...)

2042
01:41:48,940 --> 01:41:50,080
He's really desperate.

2043
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:52,320
I can't even imagine that mind.

2044
01:41:53,980 --> 01:41:55,780
I really want to debut.

2045
01:41:56,010 --> 01:41:58,180
I came here to debut.

2046
01:41:58,250 --> 01:42:00,350
I will show you that potential.

2047
01:42:02,350 --> 01:42:03,390
Let's try everything.

2048
01:42:03,860 --> 01:42:04,990
I wish he does well.

2049
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:06,730
He will.

2050
01:42:13,170 --> 01:42:15,470
("NEVER" by Sons of People performed by Sun Heng Yu)

2051
01:43:53,670 --> 01:43:57,400
(A lingering feeling that doesn't go away easily)

2052
01:43:57,940 --> 01:43:58,940
Ever.

2053
01:43:59,870 --> 01:44:00,940
For me...

2054
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:05,140
this was the most touching performance today.

2055
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:06,550
Thank you.

2056
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:10,150
I'm not sure why but I kept on tearing up.

2057
01:44:25,060 --> 01:44:27,200
I could feel your energy.

2058
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:29,130
Well...

2059
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:32,939
I think it was a performance that transcended many things.

2060
01:44:32,940 --> 01:44:34,070
I enjoyed it. Thank you.

2061
01:44:34,170 --> 01:44:35,469
Thank you.

2062
01:44:35,470 --> 01:44:37,270
(Participant Sun Heng Yu was highly praised.)

2063
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:38,540
I'm sorry...

2064
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:41,180
I couldn't remember you.

2065
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:42,910
It's fine.

2066
01:44:43,350 --> 01:44:46,490
I think you will be remembered.

2067
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:50,020
I couldn't believe it.

2068
01:44:50,620 --> 01:44:52,160
I want to boast about it outside.

2069
01:44:52,990 --> 01:44:54,260
He really does want to debut.

2070
01:44:54,690 --> 01:44:56,600
I could feel his hardship so far.

2071
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:58,760
He's really sexy.

2072
01:44:59,630 --> 01:45:01,430
Your class has been determined.

2073
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:07,070
Participant Sun Heng Yu, we are placing you...

2074
01:45:09,170 --> 01:45:12,740
- in All Star Class. - All Star.

2075
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:14,779
- All Star Class. - All Star.

2076
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:15,909
(Sun Heng Yu received All Star.)

2077
01:45:15,910 --> 01:45:17,080
Thank you.

2078
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:19,689
- Congratulations. - Thank you so much.

2079
01:45:19,690 --> 01:45:20,690
I'll do my best.

2080
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:26,390
- This is so touching. - There is drama here.

2081
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:33,730
Did I really do well?

2082
01:45:34,130 --> 01:45:35,130
Was I good?

2083
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:44,310
I was so happy that I was able to prove myself...

2084
01:45:44,610 --> 01:45:46,880
in a place where I had to prove myself.

2085
01:45:48,150 --> 01:45:49,950
The level of the participants... Why is it?

2086
01:45:50,380 --> 01:45:53,250
- Their level is high. - Exactly.

2087
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:56,089
Has it started from "Girls Planet 999?"

2088
01:45:56,090 --> 01:45:59,559
Gradually we had a great example...

2089
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:00,560
- emerged... - Exactly.

2090
01:46:00,561 --> 01:46:01,659
- Like Xiao Ting. - Like Xiao Ting.

2091
01:46:01,660 --> 01:46:02,806
- We should... - Were you here?

2092
01:46:02,830 --> 01:46:05,130
We have a great teacher and...

2093
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:06,160
This is why...

2094
01:46:06,161 --> 01:46:08,269
- the Chinese guys are improving. - They really are a pair.

2095
01:46:08,270 --> 01:46:11,031
(Who's the next participant that the perfect pair Masters will meet?)

2096
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:17,580
Everybody.

2097
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:19,340
Oh, my!

2098
01:46:20,610 --> 01:46:22,110
Super girl.

2099
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:23,580
(Encouraging a response)

2100
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:25,150
Super girl.

2101
01:46:28,150 --> 01:46:29,390
(Confused)

2102
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:31,220
They'll be embarrassed.

2103
01:46:31,390 --> 01:46:33,489
(He burst out laughing from the greatest silence ever.)

2104
01:46:33,490 --> 01:46:36,730
It looks like the response was not agreed upon.

2105
01:46:37,230 --> 01:46:38,729
You are my...

2106
01:46:38,730 --> 01:46:40,630
Baby girl, man.

2107
01:46:41,170 --> 01:46:42,230
Such a high energy.

2108
01:46:42,470 --> 01:46:43,640
Baby, girl, man?

2109
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:45,916
Please get ready and we'll watch your performance.

2110
01:46:45,940 --> 01:46:46,940
("Super Girl" by Super Junior-M)

2111
01:46:46,941 --> 01:46:48,901
(Performed by Zheng En, Can Ruo, Yu Xi, Jiang Yu)

2112
01:46:56,310 --> 01:46:57,380
Gosh.

2113
01:47:16,770 --> 01:47:18,530
They are doing it in the opposite direction.

2114
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:26,140
I'm annoyed.

2115
01:47:27,980 --> 01:47:30,026
(The mood is different from before the performance.)

2116
01:47:30,050 --> 01:47:31,350
You were really bad.

2117
01:47:31,620 --> 01:47:34,126
You looked like employees playing around in front of the boss...

2118
01:47:34,150 --> 01:47:37,860
at the karaoke after a company dinner.

2119
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:40,636
You really looked like a disorderly group of people.

2120
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:43,730
I don't think it was a problem of one single individual.

2121
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:46,870
I wanted to ask, did you practise?

2122
01:47:51,770 --> 01:47:52,770
We did practise.

2123
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:55,240
Then I have nothing else to say, but that it was not enough.

2124
01:47:56,610 --> 01:47:59,310
It really made me on the verge of being angry.

2125
01:47:59,850 --> 01:48:01,850
They made Master Xiao Ting angry.

2126
01:48:03,110 --> 01:48:04,119
You receive No Star Class.

2127
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:05,896
(Wang Can Ruo, Li Zheng En, Zhang Yu Xi, Han Jiang Yu: No Star)

2128
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:08,526
(Who will be the next participant to appear in this cold atmosphere?)

2129
01:48:08,550 --> 01:48:10,860
Oh gosh.

2130
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:15,259
My goodness. How come it's raining so much?

2131
01:48:15,260 --> 01:48:16,859
Zeng Shang Xuan! Wait for me!

2132
01:48:16,860 --> 01:48:18,060
I brought an umbrella.

2133
01:48:18,130 --> 01:48:19,230
(Laughing)

2134
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:20,770
What's their concept?

2135
01:48:21,030 --> 01:48:22,199
They look like Boy Scouts.

2136
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:23,916
They look like employees in an amusement park.

2137
01:48:23,940 --> 01:48:26,469
(Another participant appearing next)

2138
01:48:26,470 --> 01:48:28,040
Gosh, he's shining.

2139
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:29,240
(Focused)

2140
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:31,080
That's a Justhis' style.

2141
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:34,310
I guess his agency has a lot of money.

2142
01:48:35,450 --> 01:48:38,580
(What performances will be done by these two eye-catching teams?)

2143
01:48:40,620 --> 01:48:43,500
("Naughty Boy" by PENTAGON performed by Lin Xin Rui and Zeng Shang Xuan)

2144
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:50,760
(The same choreography, but different dance moves)

2145
01:48:55,330 --> 01:48:56,430
Oh, my goodness.

2146
01:49:02,440 --> 01:49:03,840
They move to different beats.

2147
01:49:05,310 --> 01:49:07,650
(Stepping)

2148
01:49:15,950 --> 01:49:19,360
Were your steps not in sync on purpose?

2149
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:22,090
(Silent)

2150
01:49:22,630 --> 01:49:24,200
("BANG BANG BANG" by BigBang)

2151
01:49:26,630 --> 01:49:27,630
(Startled)

2152
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:33,070
Let's go!

2153
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:48,320
Wait. Wait a second.

2154
01:49:52,290 --> 01:49:53,930
Look how Master Hyolin is laughing.

2155
01:49:56,190 --> 01:49:57,260
Calm down.

2156
01:49:58,030 --> 01:49:59,030
Calm down!

2157
01:50:08,870 --> 01:50:10,210
Just enjoy it!

2158
01:50:10,610 --> 01:50:12,290
(Masters decide to enjoy his performance.)

2159
01:50:19,750 --> 01:50:21,950
(Singing all together)

2160
01:50:31,230 --> 01:50:32,760
Here you go!

2161
01:50:35,270 --> 01:50:37,740
(The performance sniped at everyone's heart.)

2162
01:50:39,570 --> 01:50:40,670
He hit my heart.

2163
01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:45,460
Listen to what I say without getting hurt.

2164
01:50:45,540 --> 01:50:48,350
Your skill isn't good enough to stand on this stage.

2165
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:51,780
It's like a talent show.

2166
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:53,220
Oh, my goodness.

2167
01:50:53,690 --> 01:50:57,020
You're not even on the level that we can judge.

2168
01:50:57,120 --> 01:50:58,520
There was no balance at all.

2169
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,820
It was a total disaster.

2170
01:51:01,690 --> 01:51:03,160
It's just No Star.

2171
01:51:03,830 --> 01:51:04,960
No Star.

2172
01:51:05,700 --> 01:51:06,799
No Star.

2173
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:08,599
(Lin Xin Rui and Zeng Shang Xuan get No Star.)

2174
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:09,930
Oh, my goodness.

2175
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:12,669
- Why? - Whenever someone is eliminated,

2176
01:51:12,670 --> 01:51:13,809
Xiao Ting is almost crying.

2177
01:51:13,810 --> 01:51:15,169
(Experienced in a survival show)

2178
01:51:15,170 --> 01:51:16,340
She knows how they feel.

2179
01:51:16,410 --> 01:51:19,979
They leave here, do the elimination interview, and go home.

2180
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:21,579
That's the worst part, you know.

2181
01:51:21,580 --> 01:51:24,480
You need to do the interview when you're already eliminated.

2182
01:51:24,620 --> 01:51:26,820
I've experienced it myself in "The Street Man Fighter."

2183
01:51:27,120 --> 01:51:30,019
(He can totally relate to how participants feel.)

2184
01:51:30,020 --> 01:51:32,890
(He was eliminated in "Street Man Fighter.")

2185
01:51:33,430 --> 01:51:34,459
(Sad)

2186
01:51:34,460 --> 01:51:36,460
I'm sitting between two people who experienced it.

2187
01:51:36,590 --> 01:51:40,170
(Can the next participant break the chain of No Star?)

2188
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:42,430
Who's coming next?

2189
01:51:42,770 --> 01:51:44,369
(Nian Bo Heng and Lim Jack)

2190
01:51:44,370 --> 01:51:46,269
- Here they are. - Is his name Lim Jack?

2191
01:51:46,270 --> 01:51:48,209
- Jack! - Jack!

2192
01:51:48,210 --> 01:51:49,240
Jack.

2193
01:51:49,810 --> 01:51:50,810
Lim Jack?

2194
01:51:50,910 --> 01:51:52,180
You know Lim Jack?

2195
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:56,710
(The Jack that every participant knows appears!)

2196
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:57,920
Yeah!

2197
01:51:58,450 --> 01:52:00,420
(Cheerful from his appearance)

2198
01:52:00,550 --> 01:52:02,720
(Laughing)

2199
01:52:02,750 --> 01:52:03,920
Let's get it.

2200
01:52:04,190 --> 01:52:05,720
(Anxious)

2201
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:07,030
What's up, guys?

2202
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:08,560
What was that?

2203
01:52:08,561 --> 01:52:09,690
What's up, guys?

2204
01:52:10,430 --> 01:52:11,460
(Squeezing his eyes shut)

2205
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:13,199
I love you!

2206
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:14,330
I love you more.

2207
01:52:14,670 --> 01:52:15,730
Please.

2208
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:17,569
He's controlling Jack.

2209
01:52:17,570 --> 01:52:19,269
- Gosh, I feel drained. - I feel drained.

2210
01:52:19,270 --> 01:52:20,546
(He's so energetic even before the performance.)

2211
01:52:20,570 --> 01:52:23,009
Lim Jack? He's the most memorable one because...

2212
01:52:23,010 --> 01:52:24,439
he was so noisy.

2213
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:26,409
I felt so drained.

2214
01:52:26,410 --> 01:52:27,450
(Sighing)

2215
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:30,520
You were in BOYS PLANET, right?

2216
01:52:31,150 --> 01:52:32,179
- Yes. - Great.

2217
01:52:32,180 --> 01:52:33,219
(Dang Hong Hai was caught in Lim Jack's talk radar.)

2218
01:52:33,220 --> 01:52:36,549
When you perform alone, your mistake looks so visible.

2219
01:52:36,550 --> 01:52:38,196
Don't you feel afraid when you perform alone?

2220
01:52:38,220 --> 01:52:40,260
My singing ability isn't good enough.

2221
01:52:40,430 --> 01:52:43,290
What if I want to poop while I'm filming?

2222
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:45,000
I want to look handsome.

2223
01:52:45,860 --> 01:52:47,420
(Expressing handsomeness with his body)

2224
01:52:49,370 --> 01:52:51,300
(Feeling drained in real-time)

2225
01:52:52,240 --> 01:52:53,670
My name is Jack.

2226
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:55,510
My name is Nian Bo Heng.

2227
01:52:56,040 --> 01:52:58,079
- Listen to his voice. - His voice sounds nice.

2228
01:52:58,080 --> 01:52:59,940
How come his voice sounds so awesome?

2229
01:53:00,510 --> 01:53:03,780
In this team, I'm the one with the cute concept.

2230
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:05,750
(Making a heart shape)

2231
01:53:06,620 --> 01:53:07,850
(So suddenly?)

2232
01:53:08,020 --> 01:53:09,890
(Can't decide whether he should respond)

2233
01:53:09,950 --> 01:53:11,060
(That's cute.)

2234
01:53:11,490 --> 01:53:14,160
And I'm the one with the cool concept.

2235
01:53:14,330 --> 01:53:17,130
(Imitating what looks cool right away)

2236
01:53:17,330 --> 01:53:18,860
They're so different, though.

2237
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:21,600
One looked mature,

2238
01:53:22,230 --> 01:53:23,700
and the other looked cheerful.

2239
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:25,699
We're Jack...

2240
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:26,739
And I'm Nian.

2241
01:53:26,740 --> 01:53:28,869
We're both the same age, 19.

2242
01:53:28,870 --> 01:53:30,379
I'm from Sydney, Australia.

2243
01:53:30,380 --> 01:53:32,079
I was born in China and raised in New York.

2244
01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:34,110
He's more experienced than me, I'd say.

2245
01:53:34,150 --> 01:53:36,249
I take his feedback really well,

2246
01:53:36,250 --> 01:53:38,680
and then I just try to keep it in mind.

2247
01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:40,920
(Preliminary audition)

2248
01:53:42,190 --> 01:53:44,520
(Acting charming)

2249
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:46,519
Then you haven't danced at all before?

2250
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:48,230
Regarding dancing,

2251
01:53:48,330 --> 01:53:51,230
I've practised for about a month.

2252
01:53:52,130 --> 01:53:53,159
All right. Let's practise.

2253
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:54,176
(The standby zone before the performance)

2254
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:56,369
(Lim Jack and Nian Bo Heng work on the choreography for the intro.)

2255
01:53:56,370 --> 01:53:58,270
No, it's not right.

2256
01:53:58,700 --> 01:54:00,939
(Nian Bo Heng tells Jack the beat he missed.)

2257
01:54:00,940 --> 01:54:02,740
One, two, three, go.

2258
01:54:03,070 --> 01:54:04,080
Are you ready?

2259
01:54:04,310 --> 01:54:05,580
One, two, three.

2260
01:54:06,950 --> 01:54:08,410
What was it?

2261
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:09,710
You can't mess this up.

2262
01:54:11,650 --> 01:54:12,720
I don't remember.

2263
01:54:12,980 --> 01:54:17,719
I'm worried because Lim Jack has practised for a short time.

2264
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:19,320
If Lim Jack gets No Star,

2265
01:54:19,990 --> 01:54:21,060
what will happen to me?

2266
01:54:22,430 --> 01:54:23,960
Let's watch your performance.

2267
01:54:25,130 --> 01:54:26,830
I have a feeling that they're good.

2268
01:54:27,830 --> 01:54:30,640
Please have no expectations!

2269
01:54:30,870 --> 01:54:32,300
"Please have no expectations."

2270
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:34,640
I hope they do a good job.

2271
01:54:35,410 --> 01:54:37,856
They shouldn't do as the team that did "Everyone looks at us."

2272
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:39,280
Everyone looks at us

2273
01:54:40,610 --> 01:54:42,050
I have no confidence at all.

2274
01:54:42,550 --> 01:54:44,720
I'll try my best.

2275
01:54:45,150 --> 01:54:46,180
However,

2276
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:47,720
do not expect anything.

2277
01:54:52,090 --> 01:54:55,029
(The intro part didn't work well until the performance.)

2278
01:54:55,030 --> 01:54:57,360
(Would they be able to pull it off?)

2279
01:55:00,970 --> 01:55:03,251
("TAP" by TAEYONG performed by Nian Bo Heng and Lim Jack)

2280
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:07,670
There they go.

2281
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:33,230
That's the best rap I heard today.

2282
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:38,240
I think they're good.

2283
01:55:53,890 --> 01:55:55,450
Their facial expressions are very nice.

2284
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:23,979
Jack!

2285
01:56:23,980 --> 01:56:25,680
(You're the best.)

2286
01:56:28,220 --> 01:56:30,150
- They're good. - His dance is very groovy.

2287
01:56:30,190 --> 01:56:31,670
- The one in green. - He's different.

2288
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:33,196
You think so? I meant the one in white.

2289
01:56:33,220 --> 01:56:35,729
They have totally different colours,

2290
01:56:35,730 --> 01:56:37,229
but they're both very attractive.

2291
01:56:37,230 --> 01:56:39,060
They're different, but this combination is...

2292
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:41,000
- They can work together. - Right.

2293
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:43,429
One was like NCT DREAM,

2294
01:56:43,430 --> 01:56:45,040
and the other was like Stray Kids.

2295
01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:47,410
Honestly, they're both good.

2296
01:56:47,910 --> 01:56:49,610
I guess both will get Two Star.

2297
01:56:49,940 --> 01:56:51,139
No, All Star.

2298
01:56:51,140 --> 01:56:52,340
Both of them?

2299
01:56:53,710 --> 01:56:54,909
Experienced participants in K-pop,

2300
01:56:54,910 --> 01:56:57,230
Team Bill and Needslab. The classes will now be announced.

2301
01:57:04,890 --> 01:57:06,190
What is he doing?

2302
01:57:08,030 --> 01:57:09,590
(I'm too scared to hear it.)

2303
01:57:10,090 --> 01:57:11,860
We are placing Nian Bo Heng...

2304
01:57:13,130 --> 01:57:14,729
in the All Star Class.

2305
01:57:14,730 --> 01:57:15,806
(Nian Bo Heng in Team Bill and Needslab gets All Star.)

2306
01:57:15,830 --> 01:57:16,870
In the All Star Class.

2307
01:57:18,940 --> 01:57:19,970
It's not you.

2308
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:22,010
(Not me. I see.)

2309
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:23,470
Thank you.

2310
01:57:25,340 --> 01:57:26,610
Participant Lim Jack.

2311
01:57:30,110 --> 01:57:31,780
We are placing Lim Jack...

2312
01:57:35,390 --> 01:57:38,060
(Spitting out the water)

2313
01:57:39,690 --> 01:57:40,790
What do you think?

2314
01:57:41,030 --> 01:57:42,260
Please give me One Star.

2315
01:57:43,130 --> 01:57:44,400
"Please give me One Star?"

2316
01:57:44,460 --> 01:57:45,836
Do you want me to give you One Star?

2317
01:57:45,860 --> 01:57:48,100
- All right, then. - We can give him One Star.

2318
01:57:49,270 --> 01:57:51,469
If you want to give me more stars...

2319
01:57:51,470 --> 01:57:53,500
(This is crazy.)

2320
01:57:54,310 --> 01:57:55,830
"If you want to give me more stars..."

2321
01:57:56,070 --> 01:57:57,280
Please give me.

2322
01:57:57,840 --> 01:57:58,980
Give him All Star.

2323
01:57:59,780 --> 01:58:00,880
So cute.

2324
01:58:01,450 --> 01:58:02,610
I love him.

2325
01:58:03,610 --> 01:58:05,080
We are placing Lim Jack...

2326
01:58:07,550 --> 01:58:08,789
Congratulations. You're in All Star Class.

2327
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:11,110
(Lim Jack of Team Bill and Needslab is in All Star Class.)

2328
01:58:12,390 --> 01:58:13,596
Congratulations. It's All Star.

2329
01:58:13,620 --> 01:58:16,490
(Screaming)

2330
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:19,260
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2331
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:20,729
(2 All Star assignments double the happiness.)

2332
01:58:20,730 --> 01:58:22,330
Let's go!

2333
01:58:22,730 --> 01:58:24,439
Well done. You guys can go now.

2334
01:58:24,440 --> 01:58:25,800
(Already?)

2335
01:58:25,940 --> 01:58:27,239
(Laughing)

2336
01:58:27,240 --> 01:58:28,640
(Hurry up and go.)

2337
01:58:29,370 --> 01:58:31,139
(Do we really need to leave?)

2338
01:58:31,140 --> 01:58:32,810
- Hurry up and go. - Thank you.

2339
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:35,010
(Goodbye kiss)

2340
01:58:35,110 --> 01:58:36,380
That really woke me up.

2341
01:58:37,180 --> 01:58:38,626
Had they continued a while longer, I would've been drained.

2342
01:58:38,650 --> 01:58:41,990
Will you be able to take on Lim Jack for lessons?

2343
01:58:42,090 --> 01:58:44,189
I don't do it. I'll make my junior do it.

2344
01:58:44,190 --> 01:58:45,460
(The junior)

2345
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:49,890
(Next day)

2346
01:58:53,300 --> 01:58:55,629
(You put on the stickers very nicely.)

2347
01:58:55,630 --> 01:58:59,000
(They won't leave a mark if you take them off.)

2348
01:59:02,270 --> 01:59:06,180
(What happened to Lim Jack?)

2349
01:59:06,980 --> 01:59:08,109
Congratulations. It's All Star.

2350
01:59:08,110 --> 01:59:11,450
(Which participants will enter after the chatty Lim Jack?)

2351
01:59:11,620 --> 01:59:12,920
We'll check out the next team.

2352
01:59:14,490 --> 01:59:16,090
Experienced participant in K-pop?

2353
01:59:16,620 --> 01:59:17,660
NOUER.

2354
01:59:18,290 --> 01:59:19,419
(I see.)

2355
01:59:19,420 --> 01:59:21,090
The first place.

2356
01:59:21,860 --> 01:59:23,190
The first place, right?

2357
01:59:23,690 --> 01:59:25,260
The first place seat.

2358
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:28,200
- The first place. - Zhang Jia Hao and Zhou An Xin.

2359
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:32,199
They took the seats of higher places,

2360
01:59:32,200 --> 01:59:34,669
so I expected them to have good skills.

2361
01:59:34,670 --> 01:59:36,040
I was excited.

2362
01:59:36,570 --> 01:59:37,710
I'm excited.

2363
01:59:38,210 --> 01:59:39,280
Here they come.

2364
01:59:42,150 --> 01:59:44,020
- They're handsome. - They're cool.

2365
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:47,520
(Their fancy looks catch the eye.)

2366
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:50,860
- Hello. - Hello.

2367
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:53,260
He's so handsome.

2368
01:59:54,530 --> 01:59:55,990
Zhou An Xin is so handsome.

2369
01:59:57,430 --> 01:59:58,760
Please introduce yourselves.

2370
01:59:58,930 --> 02:00:02,069
I'm the man who fills the stage with passion,

2371
02:00:02,070 --> 02:00:03,199
Zhang Jia Hao.

2372
02:00:03,200 --> 02:00:05,199
I'm the man with charming dimples,

2373
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:06,600
Zhou An Xin.

2374
02:00:08,440 --> 02:00:09,710
Charming dimples.

2375
02:00:10,010 --> 02:00:11,379
That was neat.

2376
02:00:11,380 --> 02:00:14,579
We've been together for a long time.

2377
02:00:14,580 --> 02:00:15,609
It has been years.

2378
02:00:15,610 --> 02:00:18,020
We know each other very well.

2379
02:00:18,680 --> 02:00:22,190
You guys must have good teamwork.

2380
02:00:23,750 --> 02:00:24,760
(Nodding)

2381
02:00:27,690 --> 02:00:30,230
(Team NOUER freezes upon receiving a question.)

2382
02:00:33,060 --> 02:00:35,270
Both of you guys seem very nervous.

2383
02:00:35,430 --> 02:00:36,730
Please relax.

2384
02:00:37,130 --> 02:00:38,270
(Relaxing)

2385
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:40,270
(Relaxing)

2386
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:46,880
The first performance is very important, so we're a bit...

2387
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:48,180
nervous.

2388
02:00:49,580 --> 02:00:51,580
Hao, look at this.

2389
02:00:53,450 --> 02:00:54,989
(Being experienced participants in K-pop, )

2390
02:00:54,990 --> 02:00:56,489
(they wore All Star name tags before taking the stage.)

2391
02:00:56,490 --> 02:00:58,460
- Three stars are good, right? - I think so.

2392
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:02,389
We don't have the vibe of the experienced participants.

2393
02:01:02,390 --> 02:01:04,629
(Zhou An Xin)

2394
02:01:04,630 --> 02:01:06,130
Experienced participants in K-pop.

2395
02:01:06,930 --> 02:01:09,170
The status puts a bit of pressure on me.

2396
02:01:09,530 --> 02:01:10,600
It's scary.

2397
02:01:11,770 --> 02:01:15,410
We're experienced participants in K-pop on this show.

2398
02:01:15,940 --> 02:01:18,740
If we don't give a good performance,

2399
02:01:19,410 --> 02:01:20,850
people will be disappointed.

2400
02:01:22,650 --> 02:01:24,950
(Standby Zone before taking the stage)

2401
02:01:25,550 --> 02:01:30,890
(The two participants look nervous.)

2402
02:01:33,220 --> 02:01:37,060
(Their hearts beat fast as time goes on.)

2403
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:42,970
Relax and prepare for the performance comfortably.

2404
02:01:43,570 --> 02:01:45,739
Does the participant who took the first place seat survive...

2405
02:01:45,740 --> 02:01:47,000
until the end?

2406
02:01:47,610 --> 02:01:49,110
No.

2407
02:01:51,640 --> 02:01:53,280
- Will they do well? - I don't know.

2408
02:01:53,880 --> 02:01:55,400
One of them took the first place seat.

2409
02:01:55,650 --> 02:01:57,450
It'll be awkward if they don't do well.

2410
02:01:58,620 --> 02:02:00,750
They look really nervous.

2411
02:02:01,820 --> 02:02:03,319
(Will they surpass everyone's expectations...)

2412
02:02:03,320 --> 02:02:05,120
(despite the pressure and nervousness?)

2413
02:02:07,460 --> 02:02:10,530
("FEVER" by ENHYPEN performed by Zhang Jia Hao and Zhou An Xin)

2414
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:21,770
(To be continued)

2415
02:02:23,670 --> 02:02:26,480
("FEVER" by ENHYPEN performed by Zhang Jia Hao and Zhou An Xin)

2416
02:03:19,930 --> 02:03:21,130
How are they so good?

2417
02:03:22,370 --> 02:03:23,630
Is this AR or what?

2418
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,640
- Oh, yes. - Yes.

2419
02:03:28,240 --> 02:03:29,970
- Oh, yes. - Yes.

2420
02:03:47,990 --> 02:03:49,160
Let's go!

2421
02:03:56,870 --> 02:03:57,970
All right.

2422
02:04:02,940 --> 02:04:04,910
(Everyone cheers.)

2423
02:04:07,110 --> 02:04:09,410
I can't believe it.

2424
02:04:12,820 --> 02:04:13,980
They were really cool.

2425
02:04:14,490 --> 02:04:15,689
They could debut right away.

2426
02:04:15,690 --> 02:04:18,560
They danced in such a refreshing way.

2427
02:04:18,860 --> 02:04:20,829
Seriously, when they said hello,

2428
02:04:20,830 --> 02:04:22,260
I wondered if they were tired.

2429
02:04:22,330 --> 02:04:23,389
I know.

2430
02:04:23,390 --> 02:04:26,800
I worried that they wouldn't be able to show a good performance.

2431
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:28,700
What a twist.

2432
02:04:28,930 --> 02:04:30,129
They have unexpected charms.

2433
02:04:30,130 --> 02:04:32,700
They're usually quiet, but they become cool when they dance.

2434
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:33,840
Everyone,

2435
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:38,479
this is how you do the K-pop dance.

2436
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:39,480
(Startled)

2437
02:04:39,480 --> 02:04:40,480
This is how you do it.

2438
02:04:40,580 --> 02:04:43,579
You guys gave a very nice performance.

2439
02:04:43,580 --> 02:04:45,480
It was almost flawless.

2440
02:04:45,780 --> 02:04:48,990
Not many male idols pull off that dance.

2441
02:04:49,350 --> 02:04:52,789
Even major idols find it hard to maintain their pitch...

2442
02:04:52,790 --> 02:04:54,660
- while dancing... - That's right.

2443
02:04:54,760 --> 02:04:55,829
Like that.

2444
02:04:55,830 --> 02:04:57,330
I thought it was AR.

2445
02:04:57,800 --> 02:04:59,159
(He mistook it for AR...)

2446
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:02,970
(when Team NOUER showed their solid live singing skills.)

2447
02:05:03,470 --> 02:05:04,900
The tone was like AR.

2448
02:05:05,070 --> 02:05:06,539
How were their vocals so steady...

2449
02:05:06,540 --> 02:05:07,860
when the dance moves were so big?

2450
02:05:07,940 --> 02:05:09,910
- They're so cool. - They're so cool.

2451
02:05:11,180 --> 02:05:13,480
Now, we'll discuss the class.

2452
02:05:13,810 --> 02:05:15,326
They won't even need to think about it.

2453
02:05:15,350 --> 02:05:16,550
Both of them did so well.

2454
02:05:16,780 --> 02:05:18,650
I think it'll be double All Star.

2455
02:05:19,020 --> 02:05:20,449
Don't open the elimination gate.

2456
02:05:20,450 --> 02:05:21,450
(My goodness)

2457
02:05:21,590 --> 02:05:22,819
No explanations are needed.

2458
02:05:22,820 --> 02:05:25,419
Zhang Jia Hao and Zhou An Xin,

2459
02:05:25,420 --> 02:05:26,619
you get All Star. Congratulations.

2460
02:05:26,620 --> 02:05:27,660
(Team NOUER, All Star)

2461
02:05:28,090 --> 02:05:29,160
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2462
02:05:30,860 --> 02:05:33,230
You guys were up there, right?

2463
02:05:33,530 --> 02:05:34,800
Hurry up and go back there.

2464
02:05:35,670 --> 02:05:36,769
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2465
02:05:36,770 --> 02:05:38,499
Thank you for your hard work. See you again.

2466
02:05:38,500 --> 02:05:39,900
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2467
02:05:40,570 --> 02:05:41,839
They defended their seats.

2468
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:42,840
(You guys are the best!)

2469
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:44,110
(I love you.)

2470
02:05:44,280 --> 02:05:45,609
- "I love you." - "I love you."

2471
02:05:45,610 --> 02:05:46,639
Someone confessed his love.

2472
02:05:46,640 --> 02:05:48,040
(BOYS II PLANET C is full of love.)

2473
02:05:48,150 --> 02:05:50,849
They're four years apart.

2474
02:05:50,850 --> 02:05:53,650
I'm surprised that the younger one is equally matched.

2475
02:05:53,950 --> 02:05:56,350
- It was the best performance. - Yes.

2476
02:05:56,490 --> 02:05:57,890
- It was nearly the top one. - Yes.

2477
02:05:58,060 --> 02:06:01,360
It was a model example of a K-pop performance.

2478
02:06:03,430 --> 02:06:06,829
(They're celebrating in a timid way.)

2479
02:06:06,830 --> 02:06:08,600
We got All Star.

2480
02:06:08,870 --> 02:06:10,070
We were so happy.

2481
02:06:11,170 --> 02:06:15,070
We'll show our best selves and debut no matter what.

2482
02:06:15,770 --> 02:06:17,250
- Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

2483
02:06:17,310 --> 02:06:18,339
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2484
02:06:18,340 --> 02:06:20,680
(Let's go!)

2485
02:06:22,150 --> 02:06:23,349
The next participants.

2486
02:06:23,350 --> 02:06:24,679
(It's time for the next participants.)

2487
02:06:24,680 --> 02:06:25,680
(My goodness)

2488
02:06:26,450 --> 02:06:27,850
It's coming.

2489
02:06:29,250 --> 02:06:30,649
Let's go.

2490
02:06:30,650 --> 02:06:32,250
(Jia Han Yu, He Xin Long, and Li Zi Hao)

2491
02:06:32,360 --> 02:06:33,819
(Participants cheer as soon as the profiles are revealed.)

2492
02:06:33,820 --> 02:06:34,830
Let's go!

2493
02:06:35,260 --> 02:06:36,690
Here comes a big one.

2494
02:06:38,730 --> 02:06:40,100
Boy Story!

2495
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:42,130
I see. Boy Story.

2496
02:06:43,100 --> 02:06:44,130
Hello.

2497
02:06:44,940 --> 02:06:45,970
What?

2498
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:49,070
The members Park Jin Young produced?

2499
02:06:50,510 --> 02:06:51,990
They must be under a lot of pressure.

2500
02:06:58,820 --> 02:06:59,920
They grew up a lot.

2501
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:01,520
(That was so sudden.)

2502
02:07:02,620 --> 02:07:03,650
- Hello. - Hello.

2503
02:07:06,690 --> 02:07:09,060
(Why was Jae Joong startled?)

2504
02:07:10,090 --> 02:07:11,860
Please introduce yourselves.

2505
02:07:13,130 --> 02:07:15,630
Hello, we're Team NCC.

2506
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,800
- Boy Story. - Boy Story.

2507
02:07:18,270 --> 02:07:20,399
(Everyone, scream.)

2508
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:23,439
I'm Leader Jia Han Yu.

2509
02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:24,980
- Thank you. - I'm Li Zi Hao.

2510
02:07:27,810 --> 02:07:30,849
(At that moment)

2511
02:07:30,850 --> 02:07:32,720
He Xin Long, let's go.

2512
02:07:33,180 --> 02:07:34,180
He's well received.

2513
02:07:35,490 --> 02:07:38,960
(The passionate applause continues.)

2514
02:07:39,160 --> 02:07:42,030
Hello, I'm the youngest member of Boy Story.

2515
02:07:42,930 --> 02:07:44,229
(In charge of rap, dance, )

2516
02:07:44,230 --> 02:07:46,300
(and low notes, He Xin Long)

2517
02:07:47,630 --> 02:07:50,600
During their performances,

2518
02:07:50,700 --> 02:07:51,969
they swept the audience off their feet.

2519
02:07:51,970 --> 02:07:53,199
(Boy Story received a lot of love from the Chinese audience.)

2520
02:07:53,200 --> 02:07:55,670
- No, that's not it. - Thank you.

2521
02:07:58,140 --> 02:08:00,339
(A Chinese boy group that Park Jin Young created in 2018)

2522
02:08:00,340 --> 02:08:02,550
(He Xin Long, Jia Han Yu, Li Zi Hao)

2523
02:08:03,680 --> 02:08:06,049
(The First Boy Group from China to Chart on the US Billboard Charts)

2524
02:08:06,050 --> 02:08:08,490
(With Skills, Boy Story Brought Chinese Culture to the World)

2525
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:11,260
I was very excited during my debut.

2526
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:14,120
I was the happiest...

2527
02:08:14,730 --> 02:08:15,770
every time I was on stage.

2528
02:08:18,830 --> 02:08:21,099
If they had debuted then, it would've been seven years.

2529
02:08:21,100 --> 02:08:22,200
Yes, seven years.

2530
02:08:22,630 --> 02:08:24,330
They're my seniors.

2531
02:08:25,770 --> 02:08:26,899
But they're only 20 years old.

2532
02:08:26,900 --> 02:08:29,109
(21, 20, 21 years old)

2533
02:08:29,110 --> 02:08:31,639
I was the oldest when we debuted.

2534
02:08:31,640 --> 02:08:33,580
I was 12 years old.

2535
02:08:33,680 --> 02:08:37,820
The youngest was born in 2007. He was 9 years old back then.

2536
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:39,819
Nine years old?

2537
02:08:39,820 --> 02:08:41,389
(He debuted at the age of 9?)

2538
02:08:41,390 --> 02:08:43,219
- Yes, that's right. - That's right.

2539
02:08:43,220 --> 02:08:44,349
(Their average debut age is 11.)

2540
02:08:44,350 --> 02:08:48,490
For the three members of Boy Story,

2541
02:08:49,130 --> 02:08:54,030
appearing on this show must have not been easy.

2542
02:08:54,230 --> 02:08:55,900
It could be a loss for us.

2543
02:08:57,800 --> 02:08:59,639
(Boy Story that debuted 8 years ago)

2544
02:08:59,640 --> 02:09:02,709
I'd like to know why you decided to participate.

2545
02:09:02,710 --> 02:09:06,240
(Why they decided to participate in BOYS II PLANET)

2546
02:09:13,350 --> 02:09:16,790
I didn't want to show this side of me.

2547
02:09:27,330 --> 02:09:31,340
I cannot handle it.

2548
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:35,040
(What happened to them?)

2549
02:09:38,310 --> 02:09:40,810
(Everyone is looking forward to Boy Story's performance.)

2550
02:09:41,910 --> 02:09:43,080
Even I feel nervous.

2551
02:09:44,550 --> 02:09:46,780
- Are they that competent? - I can't wait to find out.

2552
02:09:49,090 --> 02:09:50,320
It's starting now.

2553
02:09:56,330 --> 02:09:59,800
I'll pour my everything into it.

2554
02:10:00,060 --> 02:10:04,940
(To be continued)

2555
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,069
For BOYS II PLANET C,

2556
02:10:07,070 --> 02:10:10,869
