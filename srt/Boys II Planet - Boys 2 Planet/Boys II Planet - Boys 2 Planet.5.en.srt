vote for the boys who will ignite the fire in your heart.

83

84
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,449
Participants of BOYS II PLANET K...

85
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,990
who survived through Class Placement Match,

86
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,319
I'm Planet Master Ong Seong Wu.

87
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,329
It's nice to meet you.

88
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,829
(Welcome.)

89
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,960
Planet Master.

90
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,200
I'm a true fan of his.

91
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,460
He's so cool.

92
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,500
Standing here and facing you guys...

93
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,900
brings back old memories.

94
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,770
When I received the first mission,

95
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,510
I was the most nervous.

96
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,580
The first step is the most important.

97
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,650
This is the beginning.

98
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,320
I was the most worried about the first mission.

99
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,690
I'll tell you the biggest reason why I'm here, okay?

100
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,590
Here comes the mission.

101
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,690
He'll deliver the mission.

102
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,829
My head is itching because I'm so nervous!

103
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,029
Isn't it because you didn't wash your hair?

104
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,060
No.

105
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Before I deliver the first mission,

106
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,010
I'll share an important piece of information.

107
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,686
Is there something important other than the mission?

108
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,009
Such words make me anxious.

109
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,339
- They make me anxious. - They make me anxious.

110
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,540
What could it be?

111
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,450
Why is there always a twist?

112
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,310
It'll be revealed right now!

113
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,719
What is it?

114
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,780
What will be revealed?

115
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,630
PLANET C participants won't appear, right?

116
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,719
What will we do...

117
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,596
if the curtain opens and PLANET C participants appear?

118
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,259
- PLANET C participants aren't here. - No?

119
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,530
They can't be this quiet.

120
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,560
There are so many of them.

121
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,160
All right. It'll be revealed right now!

122
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,900
(Their eyes go wide.)

123
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,040
What?

124
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,350
For goodness' sake.

125
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,820
(Zhou An Xin, the participant behind PLANET C's killing part)

126
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,849
What?

127
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,920
They're here.

128
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,990
What?

129
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,590
What?

130
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,819
(The unexpected first meeting...)

131
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,489
(leaves everyone speechless.)

132
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,660
They're the survivors of BOYS II PLANET C.

133
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,130
Why is the group so small?

134
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,269
There were only a few of them. That surprised me a bit.

135
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,199
There were many participants with a strong image.

136
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,840
I got the feeling that they were full of character.

137
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,149
Perhaps due to the large number of people,

138
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,080
there was a lot of energy.

139
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,650
I didn't know the participants, so I was a bit scared.

140
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,690
BOYS II PLANET K...

141
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,489
and BOYS II PLANET C's journeys have ended.

142
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,290
Fifty-two participants of PLANET K...

143
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,029
and 28 participants of PLANET C.

144
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,799
A total of 80 participants will enter a new competition...

145
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,070
for debut on BOYS II PLANET.

146
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,469
- Isn't it the original state? - Right. It's like the beginning.

147
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,670
We're back to 80 participants.

148
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,139
- Will we come together now? - My goodness.

149
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,970
We'll come together for real now.

150
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,879
(Sighing)

151
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,980
It has begun.

152
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,470
I worried that the participants of PLANET C might fall behind...

153
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,440
after joining the participants of PLANET K.

154
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,090
We didn't know much about the PLANET C participants.

155
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,360
So I thought, "It won't be easy."

156
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,889
Through the second Class Placement Match,

157
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,529
Masters' Evaluations of the Signal Song Test...

158
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,859
and the individual performance,

159
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,869
twenty-four All Star participants, twenty-four Two Star participants,

160
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,869
and 32 1 Star participants have been decided.

161
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,869
Rankings from the 1st to 80th place have been decided as well.

162
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,940
What?

163
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,340
Are there rankings?

164
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,240
How did I place?

165
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,610
Among 80 participants,

166
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,410
I must be 59th.

167
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,150
Your ranking...

168
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,649
(Where is it?)

169
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,750
is hidden...

170
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,689
inside your name tag.

171
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,059
(It's hidden inside your name tag.)

172
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,760
- What? - This is legendary.

173
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,289
- What? - No way.

174
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,730
There was something on the name tag.

175
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,000
It was covered.

176
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,620
(The ranking was on the name tag from the start.)

177
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,670
(Is it here?)

178
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,540
Now, check your ranking.

179
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,980
I don't want to look at it.

180
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,340
The rankings of BOYS II PLANET K's...

181
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,820
One Star participants will be revealed first.

182
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,950
It's so cruel.

183
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,250
(His heart rate goes up.)

184
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,590
Seriously.

185
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,620
(What will be the ranking for 1 Star participants?)

186
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:35,860
Please take a look at your ranking.

187
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,700
I'm okay as long as I didn't place 80th.

188
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,429
I placed 49th?

189
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,550
(Jun Lee Jeong placed 49th in Class Placement Match.)

190
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,939
This is important.

191
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,316
(Chuei Li Yu placed 55th in Class Placement Match.)

192
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,340
I placed 58th.

193
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:50,469
(Chung Sang Hyeon placed 58th in Class Placement Match.)

194
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,509
(Song Min Jae placed 78th, Bang Jun Hyuk placed 79th.)

195
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,580
- I placed 79th. - I placed 78th.

196
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,520
Next, Two Star participants, please take a look.

197
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,379
- What's your ranking? - I placed 48th.

198
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,926
(Oh Jun Ho placed 48th in Class Placement Match.)

199
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,089
(Lee Dong Heon placed 37th in Class Placement Match.)

200
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,420
It's hard to get All Star.

201
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,380
- I placed 26th. - I placed 27th.

202
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,530
- Who placed 25th? - In 25th place?

203
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,130
I placed 26th.

204
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,730
Could it be one of them?

205
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,300
From PLANET C?

206
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,839
Andrew placed 27th.

207
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,000
Han Harry June? Okay.

208
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,540
Lastly, All Star participants.

209
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,610
Please take a look at your ranking.

210
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,210
Who's in first place?

211
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,010
Who placed first?

212
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,550
(Did someone from PLANET K place 1st?)

213
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,990
Which place is Sang Won in?

214
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,220
Is Yumeki in first place?

215
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,660
(Let's take a look.)

216
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,999
(During the Signal Song individual performance evaluation, )

217
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,499
(Lee Sang Won and Yumeki received a lot of attention.)

218
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,539
What's their ranking?

219
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,500
(What will be Lee Sang Won and Yumeki's ranking?)

220
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,610
(Yumeki placed 1st in Class Placement Match.)

221
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,750
Oh, my.

222
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,480
Goodness.

223
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,090
I placed first.

224
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,559
I still can't believe it.

225
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,329
I want to make an amazing performance.

226
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,190
That's what I thought.

227
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,706
(Then what's Lee Sang Won's ranking?)

228
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,730
He placed second.

229
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,099
- Well done. - Good job.

230
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,100
He's in second place?

231
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,670
I was quite surprised.

232
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,010
It feels very heavy.

233
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,879
I placed fifth.

234
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,986
(Kim Geon Woo placed 5th in Class Placement Match.)

235
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,910
Masters' evaluations were included in deciding the ranking.

236
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,820
(PLANET C's ranking isn't revealed yet.)

237
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,249
(What will be the ranking for PLANET C participants?)

238
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,989
Now, I will announce the ranking...

239
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,790
for the surviving participants from PLANET C.

240
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,700
One Star Fan Zhe Yi from PLANET C, please step up.

241
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,169
He will announce it individually.

242
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,400
That's so harsh.

243
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:01,870
(Fan Zhe Yi's performance left a strong impression.)

244
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,880
Please take a look at your ranking.

245
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,580
(What will be Fan Zhe Yi's final ranking?)

246
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,289
(Fan Zhe Yi placed 59th in Class Placement Match.)

247
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:18,090
It's upsetting. I must go up.

248
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,859
Participant He Zhong Xing, please step up.

249
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,159
(He Zhong Xing's ranking is revealed next.)

250
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,560
He's a little...

251
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,630
He looks hip. Participant He Zhong Xing.

252
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,700
(Tearing off)

253
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,899
He checked.

254
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,340
One Star Yi Chen, please step up.

255
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,739
Yi Chen is in One Star Class?

256
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,300
(What will be Yi Chen's final ranking?)

257
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,710
Please take a look at your ranking.

258
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,650
(Yi Chen placed 80th, the last place in Class Placement Match.)

259
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,890
Oh, my gosh. Really?

260
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,589
He closed the door behind him.

261
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,329
I really gave it my all.

262
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,259
It's not that I'm not popular.

263
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,030
I was upset about my ranking.

264
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,600
Two Star Li Zi Hao from PLANET C, please step up.

265
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,969
(2 Star Li Zi Hao's final ranking is revealed.)

266
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,000
He looks amazing.

267
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,709
(Boy Story, a talented idol group who gained attention...)

268
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,180
(from being on BOYS II PLANET)

269
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,409
(He looked like a real idol star.)

270
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,150
(Yes, I totally agree.)

271
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,310
(He is an idol star.)

272
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,479
(Li Zi Hao placed 47th in Class Placement Match.)

273
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,880
I look forward to working with you.

274
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,789
I don't like my ranking.

275
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,089
Before, I was All Star.

276
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,630
I dropped to Two Star when I came here. It's upsetting.

277
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,730
Participant Sun Heng Yu.

278
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:35,899
(Sun Heng Yu is trying one last time without giving up on his dream.)

279
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,740
(He proved his skills during the Class Placement Match.)

280
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,709
(Sun Heng Yu placed 25th in Class Placement Match.)

281
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,379
He's the closest to being All Star.

282
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,980
I ranked the highest in Two Star Class. I felt thrilled.

283
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,280
PLANET C's All Star.

284
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,020
All Star is next.

285
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,790
Participant Hong Zhi Han, please come forward.

286
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,160
He's very polite.

287
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,200
Please take a look at your ranking.

288
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,569
(Hong Zhi Han placed 21st in Class Placement Match.)

289
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,769
Participant Chen Bo Wen placed 18th.

290
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,210
Participant Nian Bo Heng placed 17th.

291
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,839
Participant He Xin Long, please come forward.

292
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,580
(He Xin Long is called next.)

293
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,120
(What will be Idol Singer He Xin Long's final ranking?)

294
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,289
It's not what I expected.

295
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,189
I thought that I'd rank tenth place or higher.

296
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,920
Participant Zhang Jia Hao.

297
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,010
(Zhang Jia Hao placed 8th in Class Placement Match.)

298
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,160
He barely made the cut. He placed eighth.

299
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Automatically, Participant Zhou An Xin placed third.

300
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,070
Please stand according to your ranking.

301
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,039
He's number one when it comes to looks.

302
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,940
- Hello. - Hello.

303
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,709
This...

304
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,780
(Yoo Kang Min tells him to take off the sticker.)

305
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,020
He's definitely handsome.

306
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,349
I'm a little disappointed.

307
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,790
I'll work hard and place first.

308
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,829
BOYS II PLANET K, BOYS II PLANET C.

309
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,389
Based on the Class Placement Match,

310
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,360
your class and ranking have been determined.

311
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,200
- Hello. - It's starting now.

312
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,370
- We worked hard. - It's starting now. I'm here.

313
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,710
- I placed 43rd. - I placed 44th.

314
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,510
I was quite disappointed by my ranking.

315
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,410
I plan to work very hard.

316
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,279
I didn't expect to place last.

317
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,450
By working hard and doing my best, I'll go up.

318
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,360
I shouldn't settle for this ranking.

319
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,830
I'll survive until the end. I'm confident about it.

320
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,659
Now, I will announce...

321
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,300
the first class battle mission on BOYS II PLANET.

322
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,770
What will it be?

323
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,499
I'm so nervous.

324
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,609
It's finally here.

325
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,239
It's the start of a new chapter.

326
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,340
Things are about to get brutal.

327
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,910
Here's your first mission.

328
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,819
(Exclaiming)

329
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,850
What's that?

330
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,450
It's 1-on-1 Class Battle.

331
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,390
- What? - It's 1-on-1?

332
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,060
Who are we fighting against?

333
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,889
The 1-on-1 Class Battle is...

334
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:19,060
a head-on match between classes...

335
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,730
where you must win against the other rank.

336
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,469
With eight members from the same rank in each team,

337
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,869
there will be a total of ten teams.

338
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,909
Regardless of their rank,

339
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,480
teams who select the same song will perform.

340
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,379
The winning team will be determined...

341
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,220
by Star Creators' on-site voting.

342
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,720
All Star could compete against Two Star.

343
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,990
All Star Class will have the upper hand.

344
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,420
That's true.

345
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,390
It'd be fun to defeat All Star.

346
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,460
It will be worth trying. I must fight against higher classes.

347
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:56,130
Now, I have to tell you something serious.

348
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,839
(Everyone gets nervous.)

349
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,910
After the 1-on-1 Class Battle,

350
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,070
the 32 participants in One Star Class...

351
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,280
All of them will be eliminated.

352
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,670
(All 32 1 Star participants will be eliminated.)

353
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,390
Gosh, no.

354
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,796
- We must go up. - All of them will be eliminated.

355
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,659
Only 48 participants from All Star and 2 Star Class will survive...

356
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,859
and continue the competition.

357
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,559
(1 Star in 67th place)

358
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,430
- Only One Star is eliminated? - Yes.

359
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,629
If we don't win, we'll be eliminated.

360
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,700
We can go up.

361
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,639
(1 Star in 72nd place)

362
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,510
The thought of having to survive again...

363
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,309
I thought, "Please help me."

364
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,580
I'll use the risk of elimination as a driving force.

365
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,620
I believe that I can do it.

366
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,219
The benefit of this mission is...

367
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,550
big enough to completely change the classes.

368
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,560
If you win in a battle within the same rank,

369
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,659
you'll receive 100,000 points as a benefit.

370
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,560
- Hundred thousand? - Hundred thousand points?

371
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,169
In Season 1, 100,000 points were significant.

372
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,706
Your ranking will change with 100,000 points.

373
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,399
In a battle of 1 Star versus 2 Star,

374
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,470
if One Star Class wins,

375
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,769
the benefit will double.

376
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,079
(A benefit of 200,000 points)

377
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,756
- Two hundred thousand points? - Let's give it a try.

378
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,426
- This is great. We can do it. - Let's try.

379
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:20,120
In a battle of 1 Star versus All Star, if 1 Star Class wins...

380
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,990
Triple the benefit.

381
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,919
You will be given 300,000 points, which is 3 times the benefit.

382
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,629
(A benefit of 300,000 points)

383
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,860
If we win, we could turn the tables on All Star.

384
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,829
I snapped back into reality.

385
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,570
It felt like a lifeline had been thrown to me.

386
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:41,770
It's time to go up the ranks.

387
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,039
- This is seriously... - This is...

388
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,840
This is huge.

389
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,080
Bring it on.

390
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,919
The higher the rank of your opponent in the battle,

391
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,350
the more points you could possibly earn.

392
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,720
We're at a disadvantage.

393
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,520
Our classes could change instantly.

394
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,990
I must not lose.

395
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,730
This is not all for the benefits.

396
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,930
The team whose performance people want to see again the most...

397
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,769
will be given a chance to perform on "M Countdown."

398
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:13,839
(The team in 1st place will appear on "M Countdown.")

399
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,270
I'd love to be on that show.

400
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,470
- And... - Isn't that all?

401
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:22,009
A chance to appear on "STUDIO CHOOM," Mnet global video platform.

402
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,080
- Even on "STUDIO CHOOM?" - "STUDIO CHOOM."

403
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,520
(The benefit of the 1st mission continuing from Season 1)

404
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,919
- That's really huge. - That's huge.

405
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,089
It's so amazing that if I get that benefit,

406
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,400
I would want nothing more from BOYS II PLANET.

407
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,730
Now, I will reveal the mission songs...

408
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,970
of the first mission...

409
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,700
of BOYS II PLANET.

410
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,170
I'm really nervous.

411
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,540
(Exclaiming)

412
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,310
(Why are they all crouching?)

413
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:04,120
(The board goes up, and the mission songs get revealed.)

414
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,089
- MAMA? - MAMA!

415
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,210
Is it a performance that was on this awards ceremony?

416
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,659
This is the title track from the group...

417
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,430
that won Best New Artist at Mnet's year-end awards.

418
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,469
Which group won in 2024? I think it was TWS.

419
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,969
Then there could be...

420
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,770
Stray Kids as well.

421
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,940
In 2004?

422
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,369
I wasn't even born.

423
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,239
- What? - Wait.

424
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,009
The group that received lots of love last year...

425
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,516
- I think it's TWS. - I think it's TWS.

426
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,979
(Best New Artist of 2024 MAMA)

427
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,110
(Will it be TWS as everyone predicted?)

428
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,149
("Plot Twist" by TWS)

429
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:37,690
It's "Plot Twist" by TWS.

430
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,059
It's a trending group that won...

431
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,580
more than eight Best New Artist Award.

432
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,460
I definitely want to do this.

433
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,300
I want to do this.

434
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,770
- You want to do this? - Yes.

435
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,569
- I don't think this is my song. - "Plot Twist."

436
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,646
I don't really want to go...

437
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,540
with a cute style.

438
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,440
- This is the next song. - Stray Kids.

439
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,579
("S-Class" is a signature track...)

440
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,980
(that showcases Stray Kids' free-spirited and unique charm.)

441
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,449
That would be fun.

442
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,550
It's calling me.

443
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,289
I think it's calling me.

444
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:16,730
"KILL THE ROMEO" by ZEROBASEONE in 2023.

445
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,530
ZEROBASEONE!

446
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,899
("KILL THE ROMEO" by ZEROBASEONE)

447
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,169
ZEROBASEONE was awarded the Best New Artist Award...

448
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,370
in all the award shows they were nominated in.

449
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,209
I personally really wanted to do "KILL THE ROMEO."

450
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,780
I performed ZEROBASEONE's song...

451
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,649
in my first stage as well.

452
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,619
(Fan Zhe Yi received All Stars with "Devil Game" by ZEROBASEONE.)

453
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,650
I think that song suits my style.

454
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,720
I will reveal the third idol group's song.

455
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,390
(Covering his mouth)

456
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,266
(What's the mission song that received an explosive response?)

457
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,630
It's "Whiplash" by aespa.

458
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,499
(aespa won the Best New Artist Award in 2021 MAMA.)

459
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,200
(aespa's signature track with their metallic edge)

460
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,070
"Whiplash" by aespa!

461
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,170
Goodness!

462
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,639
I want this one.

463
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,740
"Whiplash?" This one?

464
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,439
It really is "Whiplash."

465
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,449
(They all hold the back of their necks.)

466
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,980
Yumeki looks like he would do it.

467
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,210
Look at his face.

468
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,220
Don't look at me.

469
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,549
- The last group's song. - I'm really curious.

470
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,749
If it's 2004...

471
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,120
That was before I was born.

472
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,890
TVXQ!

473
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:28,899
(TVXQ, the legendary K-pop artist)

474
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,169
(TVXQ's signature track with powerful and fiery performance)

475
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:37,070
(The high note pushed out with full force is the highlight.)

476
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,340
"Rising Sun."

477
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,750
I thought I would be in trouble if I got that song.

478
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,680
I don't know that song.

479
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,189
(Different reaction from the same song)

480
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,660
I was really happy.

481
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,890
I'm their fan as well.

482
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,860
I auditioned with TVXQ's songs.

483
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,830
I was all for that song.

484
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,969
All the songs of 1-on-1 Class Battle,

485
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,170
the first class battle, have been revealed.

486
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,940
Now, we will divide the teams.

487
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,800
How are the teams going to be decided?

488
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,096
You have to select members...

489
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,090
from the same class.

490
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,389
After the first-place participant forms his team,

491
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,519
the participant in the next place gets a chance...

492
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,460
to form his team.

493
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,260
So the people at the front will be choosing.

494
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,400
Yumeki will choose all the members?

495
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,230
He will create an Avengers team.

496
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,739
The participant who ranked first...

497
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,970
in the second Class Placement Match,

498
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,280
Yumeki, will be the first to select his team members.

499
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,080
Please come forward, Yumeki.

500
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,050
I'm curious who Yumeki would choose.

501
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,620
(They all try to win Yumeki's attention.)

502
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,120
I'm nervous.

503
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,830
I had a feeling...

504
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,729
that Yumeki liked me.

505
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,000
So I had some hope.

506
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,700
Please, Yumeki.

507
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,300
Please!

508
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,369
Did you decide the team member you want to work with?

509
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,110
Yes. I have already decided.

510
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,040
I want to give myself to him.

511
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,919
Please call out the names of the participants...

512
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,080
you want to form a team with.

513
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,550
The participant I will choose first...

514
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,790
is Zhou An Xin.

515
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,460
This is trouble.

516
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,799
It has begun.

517
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,969
You're already...

518
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,630
taking the participant in third place?

519
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:51,880
(PLANET C's killing part and overall 3rd place, Zhou An Xin)

520
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,910
It's already a legendary team.

521
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,050
My head is starting to hurt.

522
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,720
This is fun.

523
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,720
The participant I will choose next...

524
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,050
Please.

525
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,690
Is Lee Leo.

526
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,360
(That's me!)

527
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,200
(The happiest man in this moment)

528
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,240
I envy him.

529
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,270
Leo looks happy.

530
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,709
Kim Jun Seo.

531
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,039
Yoon Min.

532
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,480
Hsu Ching Yu.

533
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,280
Kim Geon Woo.

534
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,380
He took them all.

535
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,550
Vocal, dance, rap. They have it all.

536
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,350
Take it easy, Yumeki!

537
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,260
They took all the good participants.

538
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,159
(Exclaiming)

539
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,790
I'm in trouble.

540
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,660
I was getting more anxious.

541
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
- Have you decided? - Not yet?

542
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,830
I have.

543
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,140
You should do what you want.

544
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,839
I hope we get Sang Won.

545
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,409
Sang Won.

546
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,609
Seriously. Sang Won.

547
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,810
Please. Sang Won.

548
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,510
- Please select the last member. - Please, let it be Sang Won.

549
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,650
The last participant I will choose...

550
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,820
(Who is the last member of the All Start team of Yumeki?)

551
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,260
It's Lee Sang Won.

552
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,530
It's over. We can't beat them.

553
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,070
That's too much.

554
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,939
They have both killing part members...

555
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,410
and all the members of Trainee A.

556
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,039
How do we win against them?

557
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,040
(JUST Yumeki, PLANET C killing part, Trainee A, Kany's MAN, main rapper)

558
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,040
How do we win against them?

559
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,050
I'm really sorry, but how are we going to win?

560
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,550
We shouldn't be their opponent.

561
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,580
We should never be up against them.

562
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,150
That's a team we should avoid.

563
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,860
Yumeki was so mean.

564
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,719
How could he take everyone?

565
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,529
It's not fair that he takes them all.

566
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,760
I really didn't want to be the first team's opponent.

567
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,460
He took everyone here.

568
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,230
I became the person to choose.

569
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:57,570
I was confident.

570
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,299
I wanted to choose cool participants...

571
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,710
and create an amazing performance.

572
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,639
Yoo Kang Min, please come forward.

573
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,740
Let's go!

574
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,250
Let's go, Kang Min.

575
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,849
First, I will choose...

576
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,820
Jo Gye Hyeon.

577
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,090
He has to take Gye Hyeon.

578
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,630
I choose Kim Jun Min.

579
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:29,130
(He proved his skills starting with the Class Placement Match.)

580
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:32,570
Jun Min is scary.

581
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,700
I choose Kim In Hu.

582
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,010
I choose Park Dong Gyu.

583
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,510
I choose Zhang Jia Hao.

584
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:47,819
(He showed a top-tier performance at the Class Placement Match.)

585
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,889
Everyone...

586
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,590
(Zhang Jia Hao was praised by the Master.)

587
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,660
This is an Avengers team as well.

588
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,260
They're strong.

589
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,760
This team is also strong.

590
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,999
Then the remaining eight will become...

591
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
a team.

592
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,240
(The All Star zone is empty.)

593
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,800
We're doomed.

594
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,769
The participants who weren't chosen...

595
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,210
will automatically form a team.

596
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,679
I am an All Star, but I was not chosen.

597
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,680
I was a bit hurt.

598
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,620
(The three teams of All Stars were formed.)

599
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,789
(The Two Star members formed their teams too.)

600
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:26,760
(Xue Su Ren gets to choose his team.)

601
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,629
(Li Zi Hao calls Xue Su Ren from the back.)

602
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,759
How am I going to decide?

603
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,970
(But Xue Su Ren didn't hear him.)

604
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,770
Xue Su Ren.

605
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,940
(Xue Su Ren couldn't hear him until the end...)

606
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,610
Please pick me.

607
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,110
Please, Xue Su Ren.

608
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,149
(Li Zi Hao's words don't reach him.)

609
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,349
Please come forward, Xue Su Ren.

610
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:57,490
(It's time to form the team.)

611
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,460
(Xue Su Ren walks to the front.)

612
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:05,030
(He can't calm down.)

613
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,000
(He hopes he would see him at least now.)

614
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:16,369
(His heart doesn't reach him.)

615
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:19,579
Rank 35, Reeonn.

616
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:23,750
(But someone else's name gets called.)

617
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,719
Zhang Shun Yu.

618
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,819
Sen. Yang Heui Chan.

619
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,290
Tatsuki.

620
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,420
(He realizes the reality belatedly.)

621
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:38,160
(I guess we are unreachable.)

622
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,370
The last participant I will be choosing...

623
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,970
is Li Zi Hao.

624
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,070
Li Zi Hao.

625
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,210
Yes!

626
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,780
Hug me!

627
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,840
Hug me!

628
00:27:55,550 --> 00:28:00,650
(Finally, Li Zi Hao reaches him.)

629
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,350
Li Zi Hao kissed him.

630
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,490
(Acting cute)

631
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,230
Let's go!

632
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,659
- Let's go! - Let's go!

633
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:15,370
(Another 2-Star team is completed.)

634
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,270
(It's time for the 1-Star participants to choose.)

635
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,170
(Jun Lee Jeong has the chance to choose 1st.)

636
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,170
There's Jun Lee Jeong in the One Star team.

637
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,480
I think he is going to give his all to it.

638
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,940
Lee Jeong is upset.

639
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,210
I ranked 49th.

640
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,680
I didn't feel...

641
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,280
too great.

642
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,489
But I realized it wasn't the time to feel deflated.

643
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,420
And I toughened up.

644
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:42,660
Jun Lee Jeong, who ranked 49th, please come forward.

645
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:46,730
(What will Jun Lee Jeong's 1-Star team be like?)

646
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,670
He doesn't look happy.

647
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,470
Have you decided who to choose as your teammate?

648
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,070
Yes, I've decided.

649
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,010
When I saw the other two teams,

650
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,270
none of them could pull off the refreshing performance.

651
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,610
I thought, if I chose members...

652
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,949
who would shine the brightest and look the best...

653
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,250
when putting on the most refreshing performance,

654
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,280
I might have a chance to win.

655
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,150
The participant I choose is...

656
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,490
Chuei Li Yu.

657
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,030
I thought of Chuei Li Yu.

658
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,600
After I chose Li Yu,

659
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,746
it was easy to choose the ones that fit into it.

660
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,530
Jang Han Eum.

661
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,770
Chung Sang Hyeon.

662
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,240
Arctic.

663
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,910
Yi Chen.

664
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,880
Very strategic.

665
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,910
"Plot Twist" would be perfect for them.

666
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,280
If they sing "Plot Twist," it's going to be a huge hit.

667
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,520
They might actually be the strongest.

668
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:45,390
(All 80 participants are assigned to teams.)

669
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,890
Now, you will choose the mission song.

670
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,529
(Choosing the mission song is as important as teammates.)

671
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,959
- Let's go. - Here we go.

672
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,030
I'm nervous.

673
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,369
The higher-ranking teams...

674
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:57,400
will get to choose the mission song first.

675
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,000
The top-ranking All-Star, Yumeki,

676
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,410
please discuss with your teammates which song you will perform.

677
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,940
What would it be? I'm curious.

678
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,510
- That one? - That one?

679
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,856
- Are you okay with that? - Yes.

680
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,319
- Okay. - Let's go.

681
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,549
Let's go!

682
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,980
- It has to be this. - Okay.

683
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,820
I think they will choose "Rising Sun."

684
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,510
I think they will choose "Rising Sun."

685
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,220
The song we chose is...

686
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,630
Please.

687
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,160
Please choose "S-Class."

688
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,729
It's "Whiplash" by aespa.

689
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,700
(Yumeki chose "Whiplash" by aespa.)

690
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,640
Let go of your regrets.

691
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,770
Let go of "Whiplash."

692
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:39,780
Please move to where the song panel is.

693
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,350
Since they chose first, they are "Whiplash" Team One.

694
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,550
We'd better avoid them.

695
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,460
I think we'd better avoid them.

696
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,140
The leader of a team that wants to perform this song too...

697
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,420
should step forward.

698
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:55,260
You can choose the song regardless of your class.

699
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,430
No one?

700
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,330
If you win, One Star will get...

701
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,800
It's 30,000 points!

702
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,829
If I were One Star, I would've taken the chance.

703
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,216
I would've taken the chance if I were One Star.

704
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,440
Keep your eyes closed.

705
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,170
Honestly, if felt good.

706
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:12,210
We were the team people feared to challenge.

707
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,680
All right. There is no team willing to challenge them.

708
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,540
By the way, "Whiplash" is going to be incredible.

709
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,050
Our team members have so many strengths, you know.

710
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,896
- You're right. - There's just one shortcoming.

711
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,190
Who's going to take the killing part?

712
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:29,660
(Who will take the killing part of "Whiplash" Team 1?)

713
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,000
The team that ranks second...

714
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,730
is Yoo Kang Min's team.

715
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:38,130
Please tell us the group name and song title.

716
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,469
We will choose "S-Class."

717
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,539
(All Star Yoo Kang Min chooses Stray Kids' "S-Class.")

718
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,610
(Let's give up "S-Class.")

719
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,339
If we stand there with "S-Class..."

720
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,809
- People will challenge us. - But look.

721
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:48,509
We know we can perform "S-Class" well.

722
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,609
There's no reason why we shouldn't choose "S-Class."

723
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:50,809
- We are cool, you know. - We are cool.

724
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:51,909
- We are. - Let's choose the cool song.

725
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,219
- Let's do this. - Sounds great.

726
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,620
(Yoo Kang Min pushed for it confidently, and they chose it.)

727
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,989
The leader of a team...

728
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:01,320
that wants to perform this song as well should step forward.

729
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,429
I want to compete against the All Stars.

730
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,706
I want to compete against them too.

731
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:07,300
- It has a better vibe. - Please consider it.

732
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,206
(No team seems to be stepping forward.)

733
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,369
No one again?

734
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,970
I thought many teams would step forward.

735
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,699
- You thought many teams would? - Why do you say that?

736
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,170
I mean the song is that good.

737
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,670
The song is good. I'm sensitive right now.

738
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,080
The tension is already building.

739
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,409
(Meanwhile...)

740
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:24,150
If we want to win, we have to choose "S-Class."

741
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,620
But can I say something first?

742
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,120
To be honest,

743
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,559
we aren't exactly the Avengers.

744
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,989
That team is too strong.

745
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,230
We are bound to lose if we compete against them.

746
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,129
But everyone knows the song...

747
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,359
"Plot Twist."

748
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,459
And we can all sing it too.

749
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:44,069
I'm not confident that we can beat them with "Plot Twist."

750
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,569
But I am confident of winning.

751
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,440
I am worried about the vocals.

752
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,640
I am confident about my vocal.

753
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,980
No, we have to sing it too.

754
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,080
But I can't perform "S-Class."

755
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,180
What do you all think?

756
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,479
The All Stars are debating, aren't they?

757
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,050
And they too.

758
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,049
(At that moment, other teams choose "S-Class.")

759
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:07,689
(It's 1 Star Ham Hyun Seo's team...)

760
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:08,930
(and 2 Star Xue Su Ren's team.)

761
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,576
(All Star Jung Hyun Jun's team ends up giving up.)

762
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,059
I want to perform "S-Class,"

763
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,000
but we have to give up...

764
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,900
if we have to.

765
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,870
If you're worried that we aren't the cute type,

766
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,170
I think you are mistaken.

767
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,470
We can definitely pull it off.

768
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,010
That's what I think.

769
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,680
Okay.

770
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,349
(Jung Hyun Jun's team decides to go with "Plot Twist.")

771
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,820
(Noh Hui Jun persuaded them.)

772
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,649
My heart desired "S-Class."

773
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:40,260
But I couldn't be selfish and insist on choosing that.

774
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,690
So I gave up.

775
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,760
What do we do now?

776
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:44,959
Do we appeal ourselves to them?

777
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,640
- What now? - Maybe we will get to choose?

778
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,270
More than two teams have chosen the song.

779
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:52,030
So you will play a game to choose the song.

780
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,670
Let's do a dance battle.

781
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,140
Dance battle?

782
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:00,080
You will do a dizzying spinning race to grab the flag.

783
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,580
Oh, that.

784
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,810
That's fun.

785
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,949
At the start signal,

786
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:09,020
you will grab your nose and spin ten times in place.

787
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,519
Then you will run and grab the flag.

788
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,060
The team that gets the flag first will win the song.

789
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,430
In 3, 2, 1. Start.

790
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:21,000
- One, two, three, four. - One, two, three, four.

791
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,199
- Go. - Go.

792
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,430
(Which team will get "S-Class?")

793
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,140
Yes!

794
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,709
We got it.

795
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,910
(Chen Kai Wen wins the match.)

796
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,986
(All Star and 1 Star will compete against each other.)

797
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,440
Next up is...

798
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,280
All Star Jung Hyun Jun's team.

799
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:40,580
We want to choose TWS' "Plot Twist."

800
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,020
No way. They're choosing that?

801
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,560
But it won't match He Xin Long.

802
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,590
It looks like He Xin Long is frustrated.

803
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:52,530
I think a lot of people will want to go for "Plot Twist."

804
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,760
We have to choose it.

805
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,370
The leader of a team that wants to perform this song too...

806
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,770
should step forward.

807
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,210
Step forward.

808
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,580
(The most teams ever to take on the challenge)

809
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,749
(Sighing)

810
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,080
I suddenly feel so eager to win.

811
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,120
Do you think we're easy?

812
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,460
Bring it on!

813
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,319
(Laughing)

814
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,360
Great.

815
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,940
Are you water deer or what?

816
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,810
They are going to perform "Plot Twist" so well.

817
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,469
There's Arctic.

818
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:31,110
- Sang Hyeon. - Li Yu and Sang Hyeon too.

819
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,800
Daniel's team is good too.

820
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,810
It's okay. We got this.

821
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:39,580
(Kim Daniel, Xue Su Ren, Arctic, Kim Dong Hyun A)

822
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,879
Go, Xue Su Ren!

823
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,010
(Xue Su Ren's biggest fan)

824
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,819
As long as it's not Lee Jeong's team, I will be okay.

825
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,020
Please.

826
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,750
Go, Arctic!

827
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,890
- Start! - One!

828
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,530
- Two, three, four. - Two, three, four.

829
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,790
Go, Daniel!

830
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,630
(What's the result?)

831
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,870
We're in trouble.

832
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,576
(1 Star Jun Lee Jeong's team gets "Plot Twist.")

833
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,340
(Come here.)

834
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,940
Well done.

835
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,940
We have a chance.

836
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,380
(It's All Star versus 1 Star. Which team will win?)

837
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,380
The next in rank is...

838
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,120
Sun Heng Yu's team.

839
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,150
The song we chose is...

840
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,160
TVXQ's "Rising Sun."

841
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,460
No way.

842
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,530
I think they will perform it so well.

843
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,730
They are "Rising Sun" Team One.

844
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,000
We are choosing ZEROBASEONE's song,

845
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,670
"KILL THE ROMEO."

846
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,630
The leader of a team that wants to perform this song too...

847
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:41,970
should step forward.

848
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,880
(All of the remaining teams' leaders step forward.)

849
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,280
- Dopamine. - Dopamine.

850
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,720
All teams are out.

851
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:56,450
(Elephant Nose Flag Grab for the Team's Fate!)

852
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,890
(Which team will get "KILL THE ROMEO?")

853
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,300
(1 Star team's leader Kim Dong Hyun A wins.)

854
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:13,940
(The last 1 Star team gets "KILL THE ROMEO.")

855
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,610
(Groaning)

856
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,870
Okay.

857
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,280
Two teams remain now.

858
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:22,410
And two songs remain.

859
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,710
Who is going to come?

860
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:28,380
If you want "Whiplash," please step forward.

861
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,919
- You should go. - Go.

862
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,089
Get out there, Jae Hyun.

863
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,459
- Go. - Jae Hyun,

864
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,460
there's no one among us who can sing "Rising Sun."

865
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:36,529
Jae Hyun!

866
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,129
(But there are...)

867
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,799
(too many formidable participants.)

868
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,960
There's no one to sing it.

869
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,370
We don't have a main singer.

870
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,369
- We don't have any. - We don't!

871
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,439
Jae Hyun, there's no one else!

872
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,939
- Go! - Jae Hyun!

873
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,139
(A masculine roar...)

874
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,510
(and "Whiplash")

875
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,739
All right!

876
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,949

00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,680
("Let's Give It Our Best Shot")

887
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,950
(The 80 boys started distributing the parts.)

888
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,649
Before you begin distributing the parts,

889
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:38,150
you can vote for a leader.

890
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,560
A leader?

891
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,730
The leader holds full authority...

892
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,160
to make the final decisions on all parts,

893
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:48,500
including the killing part.

894
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,740
The leader gets to decide all of them.

895
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,070
I want to be the leader.

896
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,210
He's the king.

897
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,280
He is.

898
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,510
Can we get a show of hands for those who want to be the leader?

899
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,420
I was eager to do it.

900
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,790
I was the leader in the One Star Class,

901
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,870
and I can tell you that it's a lot of pressure.

902
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,160
(It's a lot of pressure.)

903
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,899
Although it's a lot of pressure,

904
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,499
someone has to take responsibility.

905
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,800
So, I'd like to be that one.

906
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,339
I want this team to be successful,

907
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,609
so I'd like to apply for the position.

908
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:37,009
Then, I have a recommendation.

909
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:38,150
- Who? - It is...

910
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:39,620
- Xue Su Ren? - Xue Su Ren.

911
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,219
He was the one who picked us.

912
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,649
He was the leader in the All Star Class.

913
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:43,790
- I see. - Really?

914
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:47,460
I think it's better for us to have him be the leader.

915
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,560
Let me make this clear.

916
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,589
Without Su Ren, we wouldn't have been here.

917
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,160
(Without Su Ren, we wouldn't have been here.)

918
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:59,840
(Li Zi Hao strongly recommends Xue Su Ren.)

919
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,370
What I felt was...

920
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:05,779
that Xue Su Ren and Li Zi Hao were in love.

921
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,010
They're practically in love.

922
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,549
If we're voting, I'm voting for Su Ren.

923
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,619
(I'll vote for him as our leader.)

924
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,949
Since Su Ren chose us,

925
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,290
I wanted to choose him back.

926
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,819
(When they were picking teammates)

927
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,189
(Xue Su Ren called Li Zi Hao's name last.)

928
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,190
(Baby!)

929
00:40:23,191 --> 00:40:24,990
(Give me a hug!)

930
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,130
Baby!

931
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,070
(Kissing)

932
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:33,070
(You're the best.)

933
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,640
Let's go!

934
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,569
What do you think?

935
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,851
There might be other teammates who want to be the leader.

936
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,250
I was a little intimidated.

937
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,180
So, I couldn't apply.

938
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,920
Then, who do you want?

939
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:51,720
Who should be the leader?

940
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,319
I personally recommend Heui Chan.

941
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,320
I'm voting for Su Ren.

942
00:40:55,321 --> 00:40:56,590
I vote for Heui Chan.

943
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:58,360
Who are you picking? Su Ren?

944
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,260
Who has the most votes right now?

945
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,170
Right now...

946
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,500
I think we should vote for Su Ren.

947
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,809
(Team 1 Leader Voting Status, Heui Chan: 2, Su Ren: 1)

948
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:15,970
(Team 1 Leader Voting Status, Heui Chan: 2, Su Ren: 2)

949
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:19,249
(Heui Chan and Su Ren are tied.)

950
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,349
This is tough.

951
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:23,350
(Sen holds the casting vote.)

952
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,420
This is... Sen.

953
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,760
It's up to you, Sen.

954
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:36,230
(What is his decision?)

955
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,540
Xue Su Ren.

956
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,200
- Su Ren. Okay. - Okay.

957
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,940
- Okay. - Congratulations.

958
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,170
- Su Ren. - Su Ren!

959
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:46,379
- Okay. - Okay.

960
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,139
- All right. - Congratulations.

961
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,026
(Xue Su Ren is the leader of "KILL THE ROMEO" Team 1.)

962
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,210
I was bummed out.

963
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,720
(Sighing)

964
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,619
("KILL THE ROMEO" by ZEROBASEONE)

965
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,950
(Meanwhile, )

966
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:00,560
(Team 2's part sheet is empty.)

967
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,429
We failed to assign the parts...

968
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:07,830
within the time limit.

969
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:09,850
(Team 2 assigning the parts)

970
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,430
Who can sing those high notes?

971
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:16,269
(The main singer must sing powerful, high notes, )

972
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:18,740
(which is the part by Tae Rae from ZEROBASEONE.)

973
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,210
It's a very important part.

974
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,130
It's too high. I don't think I can sing it.

975
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:25,509
It's too difficult.

976
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,750
Does anyone else want to try the main vocalist?

977
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:30,690
(No one's volunteering yet.)

978
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:31,790
Anyone else?

979
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:33,159
Because this is really important,

980
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,460
I want to try everyone.

981
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:39,400
(They don't seem interested in the main vocalist's part.)

982
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:43,570
No more main vocalist volunteers?

983
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,300
No one was stepping up...

984
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,240
since it was a part with a lot of pressure.

985
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,780
Everyone was reluctant,

986
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,110
so we were very self-conscious.

987
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,450
- Maybe. - Or...

988
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,209
- Do you want to try it? - No.

989
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,120
(Do you want to try the main vocalist's part?)

990
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,819
We could assign all the other parts first.

991
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,419
(Sho suggests that they assign the other parts first.)

992
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,660
I want to be the main rapper.

993
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,999
"KILL THE ROMEO" is...

994
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,800
a song with a sexy and intense image.

995
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:19,669
I thought that part could highlight...

996
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,140
my unexpected charms.

997
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:24,640
I want to be the main rapper.

998
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:26,870
I also want to be the main rapper.

999
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,750
(I also want to be the main rapper.)

1000
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:33,919
(Sho and He Zhong Xing volunteered for the main rapper's part.)

1001
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,920
Main rapper?

1002
00:43:34,921 --> 00:43:38,349
Let's just listen to "KILL THE ROMEO" more.

1003
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:40,760
And then, while we're in the practice room,

1004
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,860
we can decide on the other parts.

1005
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,030
(Who will be the main rapper of Team 2?)

1006
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:48,760
Okay, so...

1007
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,969
(Chrisen seems to have something to say.)

1008
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:53,370
Let's do...

1009
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,209
Is it okay if you be the sub-rapper?

1010
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:00,810
(Sho)

1011
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,409
Why?

1012
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:05,510
(Sho is flustered by the sudden suggestion.)

1013
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,349
He's like the smallest.

1014
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:09,350
(But Sho is the shortest.)

1015
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,930
I don't think it'll look so aggressive.

1016
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:19,629
(The leader thinks he's too short...)

1017
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,200
(to be the main rapper.)

1018
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,570
I don't think...

1019
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:25,970
this is fair.

1020
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,840
I agree...

1021
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:32,669
that I'm not suited for the song's vibe.

1022
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:37,110
However, assigning the parts without even listening first...

1023
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:40,250
doesn't sound so fair.

1024
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,290
It feels like you're abusing your power as the leader.

1025
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,890
The air turned cold.

1026
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,260
The leader wasn't wrong,

1027
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:55,060
but I believed he made a slip of the tongue.

1028
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:59,100
Maybe we could try it here.

1029
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,440
(Zhong Xing suddenly starts warming up.)

1030
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:09,040
(Zhong Xing tries out for the main rapper part.)

1031
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,720
(How he raps)

1032
00:45:14,721 --> 00:45:17,002
("The 2nd act won't be predictable since it's our story")

1033
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,190
(Satisfied)

1034
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,229
(Sho tries out for the main rapper part.)

1035
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:25,930
The 2nd act won't be predictable since it's our story

1036
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:29,130
(Exclaiming)

1037
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,400
Their main rapper is Li Zi Hao.

1038
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,869
(Team 1's main rapper is Li Zi Hao, )

1039
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:33,939
(who was the main rapper of a rap unit.)

1040
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,699
We might be able to mix it up by surprising them...

1041
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,240
with his cute image.

1042
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:39,510
Then, what should we do...

1043
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:41,810
with Zhong Xing?

1044
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:48,680
Trust me.

1045
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:50,690
This isn't a matter of trust.

1046
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,720
(What's Chrisen's decision as the leader?)

1047
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,330
Okay. Sho.

1048
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:58,330
Main rapper.

1049
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:00,060
Thank you.

1050
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,130
I wanted to go home at that time.

1051
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,139
(Can they finish assigning the parts?)

1052
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,210
("Plot Twist" by TWS)

1053
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,880
(Team 1 and Team 2 start assigning the parts.)

1054
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:23,190
The participants from Planet K are all beasts.

1055
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,649
Seriously.

1056
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,660
The Planet C participants are also beasts.

1057
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,289
Anyway, we were All Stars,

1058
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:32,060
who were proved to be good.

1059
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,830

1060
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:40,999
(Team 1's members' skills have already been approved.)

1061
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,270
- All Star. - All Star.

1062
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,640
("Plot Twist" Team 1 consists of formidable All Stars.)

1063
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:48,340
All Stars will always be All Stars.

1064
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:49,679
I think we'll win.

1065
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,910
How could we lose?

1066
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,789
(But He Xin Long seems down.)

1067
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:00,720
I didn't really want to sing this song by TWS.

1068
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:05,160
(When the songs for the 1-on-1 Class Battle were revealed)

1069
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:09,500
(Xin Long wanted a powerful song.)

1070
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,900
I was dying to sing the song by Stray Kids.

1071
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:17,869
(But he had to go against a team of All Stars...)

1072
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:19,609
(formed by Yoo Kang Min if he chose "S-Class.")

1073
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:21,810
Can I tell you my opinion first?

1074
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,749
We need to survive first...

1075
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:27,120
to do what we want in the coming missions.

1076
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,249
I'm a little worried about who will be the vocalist.

1077
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:30,289
I've got good vocals.

1078
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:31,466
I'm really confident that I can ace it.

1079
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:33,459
No. We have to sing the song too.

1080
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:36,120
Yes, he has a point. I must sing it with my low-pitched voice.

1081
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,230
Yes, you guys have low-pitched voices.

1082
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:41,200
But going for "S-Class" doesn't sound good in my opinion.

1083
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,670
- It is risky. - Yes, it is.

1084
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:48,840
I couldn't be selfish about it. So we didn't go for it.

1085
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:55,940
(Their long deliberation ended with "Plot Twist.")

1086
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,219
First of all, raise your hands if you want to be...

1087
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,380
the leader.

1088
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:03,120
I do want to try it out.

1089
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:05,949
(He Xin Long and Noh Hui Jun volunteer to become the leader.)

1090
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,060
I'd like to recommend Hui Jun.

1091
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,430
Hui Jun is an experienced participant.

1092
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:13,429
He has performed in a group before. So...

1093
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:14,459
(I'm also experienced.)

1094
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,730
I think Hui Jun will do a good job. And he's also the oldest among us.

1095
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:19,429
(It seems Hui Jun may become the leader.)

1096
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:20,899
(How will He Xin Long promote himself?)

1097
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:24,770
Okay. Then you should be the leader for this mission...

1098
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:28,710
to represent us. Why don't we do our best together?

1099
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:30,326
- So you want him to be the leader? - Yes.

1100
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:32,349
- Are you sure you're okay with it? - Yes. I'm good.

1101
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:35,380
I want to take the killing part and be the main rapper.

1102
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,720
So I gave up the leader position.

1103
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,160
(Noh Hui Jun is Team 1's leader for "Plot Twist.")

1104
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,630
- A sense of responsibility. - Let's go.

1105
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,429
Let's decide who will take the killing part.

1106
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:49,769
Let's check out facial expressions and gestures...

1107
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:51,929
that work well for "Plot Twist" and that you feel confident about.

1108
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:54,970
As we explore them together, I'll give it some thought.

1109
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:56,570
Okay.

1110
00:48:56,571 --> 00:48:57,669
Who wants to go first?

1111
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:59,070
- Can I go first? - You? Okay.

1112
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:02,680
(Candidate 1 for the killing part, Jung Hyun Jun)

1113
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:08,720
(Candidate 2 for the killing part, Chen Bo Wen)

1114
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:15,960
(Candidates 3 and 4, Na Yun Seo and Kim Tae Jo)

1115
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,860
They all knew the choreography to this song.

1116
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,460
But I didn't.

1117
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,229
- Who hasn't gone yet? - It's just me.

1118
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,830
Let me learn the ending pose.

1119
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,400
You want to do the ending pose too?

1120
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,070
My gosh. Seriously.

1121
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,939
(He Xin Long learns the choreography...)

1122
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,449
(from Chen Bo Wen at the last minute.)

1123
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:38,150
You don't have to try that hard.

1124
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:40,149
- Right. - Show us the facial expression.

1125
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:42,230
Then let me do the facial expression for the ending.

1126
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,320
(Candidate 5 for the killing part, He Xin Long)

1127
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:48,990
(He Xin Long does his best although he doesn't know the moves.)

1128
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:54,030
Gosh, that's cute.

1129
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,600
You did the ending pose.

1130
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:58,470
Even I think I look awkward.

1131
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,570
In my opinion...

1132
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,310
(How will the leader, Noh Hui Jun, decide?)

1133
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,410
Hyun Jun.

1134
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:08,880
Thank you. I'll do my best.

1135
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:11,850
Deep down, I was praying for it.

1136
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:14,320
But I'm quite disappointed.

1137
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:17,890
Then who wants to take the main rapper position?

1138
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:19,450
- Me. - Both of you?

1139
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,920
- Nian Bo Heng, you try it. - Okay.

1140
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:28,560
(Candidate 1 for the main rapper, Nian Bo Heng)

1141
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,800
He has a really deep voice.

1142
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,230
You're up, He Xin Long.

1143
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:37,840
(Candidate 2 for the main rapper, He Xin Long)

1144
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,009
(Nian Bo Heng and He Xin Long showcased similar deep voices.)

1145
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:43,209
The main rapper position goes to...

1146
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:46,110
(Who will be the main rapper for Team 1?)

1147
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,719
Nian Bo Heng.

1148
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:50,989
(Nian Bo Heng is Team 1's main rapper for "Plot Twist.")

1149
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:52,019
Thank you.

1150
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:54,589
(Naturally, He Xin Long takes the remaining rap part.)

1151
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:55,619
("Plot Twist")

1152
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:58,089
(The secondary rapper's part only lasts 4 seconds.)

1153
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:00,359
I only get four seconds. I don't even know...

1154
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,200
if the cameraman can capture me in these four seconds.

1155
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:09,400
I'm really worried.

1156
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:15,040
The leader for Team Two is...

1157
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,049
Jun Lee Jeong.

1158
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:19,331
(The leader of Team 2 for "Plot Twist" is Jun Lee Jeong.)

1159
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,220
- Be a good leader. - It suits you well.

1160
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,890
Let's pick the leader now.

1161
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:26,719
- Well, Lee Jeong... - Right.

1162
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,759
- formed this team. - I think...

1163
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,829
He's our parent. He picked all of us.

1164
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:31,830
- Well... - Right.

1165
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,499
I picked all of you because I was plotting a plan.

1166
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,730
You were plotting a plan.

1167
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:39,130
I chose all of you based on my plan.

1168
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,770
When I looked at the other groups,

1169
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:44,186
I noticed that no group could pull off the refreshing theme.

1170
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:46,039
Everyone wanted to go for "S-Class."

1171
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,010
I had a feeling that they all wanted to try "Whiplash."

1172
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:51,680
If I went all in to perform the refreshing theme...

1173
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,980
and chose the most suitable participants for it,

1174
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,420
I thought we would have a shot.

1175
00:51:56,950 --> 00:52:00,490
I think all of you have such distinct charms.

1176
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:04,290
And as for Li Yu, the truth is...

1177
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:09,200
I chose you for this song.

1178
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:13,340
(Impressed by the leader's plotting)

1179
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:16,610
I formed this team with you in mind.

1180
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,740
Li Yu was the first person that came to my mind.

1181
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,909
Actually, as for his first performance,

1182
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:27,420
he wore a school uniform or something.

1183
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,989
When I saw him, I thought he'd be great for a song by TWS.

1184
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:32,589
That crossed my mind.

1185
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:37,530
(Li Yu even performed a song by TWS during the Class Placement Match.)

1186
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:41,430
I think he left a strong impression on me with that performance.

1187
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,770
I thought he was a good match for the song.

1188
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,770
I had a feeling that he'd execute what I had in mind.

1189
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:51,309
I heard that you were hardworking and diligent...

1190
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:53,140
from other One Star participants.

1191
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,380
- You got this. - Thank you.

1192
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:59,550
(Expressing his real intention)

1193
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,020
I have high expectations of you.

1194
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:06,920
Lee Jeong thought highly of me.

1195
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:10,390
I keep telling myself that I must ace it.

1196
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:15,399
First of all, the rap parts are clearly divided.

1197
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,400
I'd like to pick the rappers first.

1198
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:21,740
(The main rapper stands out the most among other rap positions.)

1199
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,810
- Can everyone try the part? - Sure.

1200
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:27,580
(Candidate 1 for the main rapper, Kim Dong Hyun B)

1201
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:31,150
(Candidate 1 for the main rapper, Chung Sang Hyeon)

1202
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:34,380
Raise your hands if you want Sang Hyeon to be the main rapper.

1203
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,026
(Everyone except for the leader and Dong Hyun votes for him.)

1204
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,750
Sang Hyeon will be the main rapper.

1205
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:39,850
Okay.

1206
00:53:39,851 --> 00:53:41,720
All right. Let's go straight to...

1207
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,936
(Team 2 is dividing the parts smoothly.)

1208
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,759
(Team 2's main vocalist, Jang Han Eum)

1209
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,929
(Team 2's secondary vocalist, Kang Woo Jin)

1210
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:49,329
I'll be the second vocalist.

1211
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:53,870
With Yi Chen as the third vocalist, our performance will look solid.

1212
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:55,630
We're done dividing the song.

1213
00:53:56,100 --> 00:54:00,010
Is there anyone who would like to volunteer for the killing part?

1214
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:01,580
I'd like to see it.

1215
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,050
Li Yu.

1216
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,619
(The center of Lee Jeong's plan)

1217
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:10,020
(The leader's faith in Li Yu knows no bounds.)

1218
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:12,249
(Will Li Yu take the killing part just like this?)

1219
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:15,060
I'd like to try it too.

1220
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,090
I just want to try the dancing part in the beginning.

1221
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:22,530
(The main position of the intro will get a lot of attention.)

1222
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:25,229
(Afterward, this position will be the center of the song...)

1223
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:28,000
(and must set the tone for the performance.)

1224
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:30,169
If you want this position, you must do the whole thing.

1225
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:31,540
- Right. - Yes.

1226
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:36,680
(They narrow down to two candidates for the killing part.)

1227
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:40,720
(Leader Lee Jeong seems to have a lot on his mind.)

1228
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,720
(He chose his team with a plan in mind.)

1229
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,390
Is there someone you have in mind for the killing part?

1230
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:52,330
Honestly, given the divided parts of the song and so on,

1231
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:55,130
I would like Li Yu to take the position.

1232
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:58,430
(Li Yu had the killing part in his plan.)

1233
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:00,500
I really want to do the dance break.

1234
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,499
No, in the beginning.

1235
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,909
(Now, his original plan may change.)

1236
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:05,586
If you want this position, you must do the whole thing.

1237
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:06,980
- Right. - Yes.

1238
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:13,450
(Yi Chen performs the killing part to show his skills.)

1239
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:15,980
(On the other hand, Li Yu seems nervous.)

1240
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:18,250
- Li Yu. Be confident. - Li Yu.

1241
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:21,520
We'll decide after you sing.

1242
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,859
(Candidate 1 for the killing part, Chuei Li Yu)

1243
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,630
(Chuei Li Yu's pitch is shaky.)

1244
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:29,011
(On the other hand, Yi Chen is brimming with confidence.)

1245
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,400
(Three)

1246
00:55:32,401 --> 00:55:33,439
(Two)

1247
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,570
(One)

1248
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:41,380
Could you sing the ending part?

1249
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:45,909
(Li Yu's singing is still unstable.)

1250
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:47,180
(Meanwhile...)

1251
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,950
(Yi Chen easily sings it in falsetto.)

1252
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:56,260
- I really don't know. - I don't know.

1253
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,690
What do we do?

1254
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:01,429
We don't have much time left.

1255
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:03,750
- All right. Put your heads down. - Let's vote right away.

1256
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,700
- I won't vote on purpose. - Really?

1257
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,800
Raise your hands if you want Yi Chen to take it.

1258
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:12,770
(Yi Chen gets 2 votes.)

1259
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:15,610
Raise your hands if you want Li Yu to take it.

1260
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:16,810
(Li Yu gets 2 votes.)

1261
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:17,810
Okay.

1262
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,650
Okay. Open your eyes.

1263
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:23,650
(The vote comes out to a tie with 2 to 2.)

1264
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:28,760
(Who will take the killing part?)

1265
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:33,029
- Yi Chen will take it. - The killing part.

1266
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:34,060
Me?

1267
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:36,659
Me?

1268
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:37,930
(What happened?)

1269
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:41,440
(During the vote for the killing part)

1270
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:49,840
(3 people voted for Yi Chen including Dong Hyun B.)

1271
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:51,449
Really?

1272
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:52,609
(Yi Chen takes the killing part for Team 2.)

1273
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:54,180
- Congratulations. - Me?

1274
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,789
Thank you.

1275
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:58,450
- Nice try. - Thank you.

1276
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,720
I'll do my best to perform the song as if my life depended on it.

1277
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:04,460
- Great. - Thank you.

1278
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,260
Thank you so much.

1279
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:07,930
Good job.

1280
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:12,470
("Plot Twist")

1281
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,399
(Team 1 and Team 2 meet up in the practice room later.)

1282
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,070
Hyun Jun is a good match for the song.

1283
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:18,840
We chose Hyun Jun to take the killing part.

1284
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,880
Yi Chen has the killing part.

1285
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:27,819
"Could Yi Chen beat Hyun Jun?"

1286
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:30,750
That's the thought that stuck with me the most.

1287
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:33,089
(TVXQ "Rising Sun")

1288
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:35,219
- Do you know this song? - I know it so well.

1289
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:36,490
I was a member of Cassiopeia.

1290
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:38,759
I didn't know this song before.

1291
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:39,860
That's understandable.

1292
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:42,830
But I feel so reassured to have him on our team.

1293
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:44,769
- I trust him so much. - That's so sweet.

1294
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:46,070
Gosh, you're making me so...

1295
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,339
(During PLANET C's class placement match, )

1296
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,069
(the all-rounder Sun Heng Yu got All Star for his vocals and dance.)

1297
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:52,609
Heng Yu is really talented,

1298
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:53,810
and he seemed so reliable.

1299
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:55,579
(Eyes full of trust)

1300
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:58,910
Since some of us know this song and some of us don't,

1301
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,049
shall we listen to the song?

1302
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:01,120
- Okay. - Okay.

1303
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,649
(They listen to the song together first.)

1304
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:04,690
We'll be dancing here.

1305
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:06,189
(A high note that pierces their ears from the beginning)

1306
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:07,360
What is that?

1307
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:10,860
(The high notes just keep going higher.)

1308
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:13,900
(In awe)

1309
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:17,470
(Finally, the high notes in the highlight of "Rising Sun")

1310
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:24,209
For this song, the vocals are so important.

1311
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:26,509
Honestly, the main vocalist is the killing part.

1312
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:27,639
The main vocalist has a lot to sing too.

1313
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,139
The main vocalist has so much.

1314
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:30,140
Right.

1315
00:58:30,141 --> 00:58:32,179
But the main vocalist will be really hard.

1316
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:33,819
(The high notes in the highlight are also for the main vocalist.)

1317
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,049
The most important, the main vocalist.

1318
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:36,150
Who wants to try it?

1319
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:46,189
I really thought I couldn't do this, even in my next life.

1320
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:47,230
So, I gave up.

1321
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:49,399
Who wants to try it?

1322
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,799
(Sun Heng Yu carefully raises his hand.)

1323
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,900
- I... - Okay, then...

1324
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:54,670
considered this when I chose our team members.

1325
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:57,370
I'm after the main vocal position.

1326
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,870
Even before I chose team members, I had a plan in mind.

1327
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:01,539
Are you going to do "Rising Sun?"

1328
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:02,580
Me? Definitely.

1329
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:04,309
- Which part do you want to do? - Who?

1330
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:05,680
The highest part.

1331
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:08,049
- The main vocalist? - Yes, the main vocalist.

1332
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:09,610
- Can you reach all the notes? - I can.

1333
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,366
(Sun Heng Yu's high notes as he aims to become the main vocalist)

1334
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:15,020
(Peeking over)

1335
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:19,729
Okay.

1336
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:21,429
- Our team is so good. - We are.

1337
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:22,790
- You're really good. - Seriously.

1338
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,100
You're so good.

1339
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:25,629
You get the main part.

1340
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:28,739
(Sun Heng Yu becomes the main vocalist of "Rising Sun" Team 1.)

1341
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:29,970
- For real? - Yes.

1342
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:34,339
I heard that Sun Heng Yu was a good singer.

1343
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,440
I'm so happy with him.

1344
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:37,479
Since you're the main vocalist,

1345
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:38,650
please lead our vocals.

1346
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:40,750
Thank you so much. I'll work really hard.

1347
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:43,479
I got the main vocalist part as I had planned.

1348
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,749
I'm really confident that I can do well on stage.

1349
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,110
I think we'll win, no matter what.

1350
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,659
(Meanwhile, what about "Rising Sun" Team 2?)

1351
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:51,860
Has anyone thought about becoming the main vocalist?

1352
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:54,529
If you have the skills, I think it's good for you to...

1353
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:56,100
go for it without hesitation.

1354
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,669
First of all, I can't do it.

1355
00:59:57,670 --> 01:00:00,200
I can't sing that high either. So, I'll give up.

1356
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:01,899
Aside from wanting to do it,

1357
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:04,640
you can only do this if you have the skills.

1358
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:07,509
Well, we do have a lot of rappers.

1359
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:09,679
I'm good at dance and rap.

1360
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,379
I'm a rapper.

1361
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:13,919
My position is a rapper and a dancer too.

1362
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,279
The main vocalist does have the most parts to sing.

1363
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,920
I felt slightly pressured.

1364
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:20,090
I'll try.

1365
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:21,989
(Yusen tries out for the main vocalist part.)

1366
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:23,690
- Yusen! He'll try. - Yusen.

1367
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:25,289
- Yusen. Hello. - Good luck.

1368
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:26,976
Be sure to take the high parts, no matter what.

1369
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,130
That song has high notes in the highlight.

1370
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,600
Be sure to become the main vocalist.

1371
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:32,529
You could reach all the notes for "Firing the light, solar," right?

1372
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:34,470
Yes. Is it about that high?

1373
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:36,099
- Yes. - Is the pitch similar?

1374
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,870
- Yes. - Then, I can do it. Definitely.

1375
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:40,340
- I'll pass out the lyric sheet. - Okay.

1376
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:43,680
(Seo Won's words keep ringing in Yusen's head like an echo.)

1377
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:47,249
(Yusen looks for the main vocalist part first.)

1378
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:48,750
Be sure to become the main vocalist.

1379
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:50,750
It's 41 seconds?

1380
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:54,120
The parts that I remembered all belonged to the main vocalist.

1381
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:55,520
I really wanted to do it.

1382
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:58,089
(Candidate 1 for the main vocalist, Yusen)

1383
01:00:58,090 --> 01:00:59,406
Is there anyone else besides Yusen?

1384
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:02,070
(Able to speak 3 languages, he naturally translates for everyone.)

1385
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:05,269
(Jiang Fan steps up.)

1386
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:07,140
Jiang Fan.

1387
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:11,440
(Jiang Fan handled the signal song stably.)

1388
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:15,210
(He shot up from 1 Star to All Star class.)

1389
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:19,479
Honestly, I want to become the main dancer,

1390
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,850
but there is no such part.

1391
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:23,419
So, to challenge myself,

1392
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:27,590
I tried out for the main vocalist part.

1393
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:31,490
(Jiang Fan sings the main vocalist part first.)

1394
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:37,029
(Impressed)

1395
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:38,130
You have a great voice.

1396
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:39,799
But his throat doesn't seem to be in good condition.

1397
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,340
- Yes, a bit... - Does it hurt?

1398
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:43,199
(Jiang Fan's throat isn't doing well at the moment.)

1399
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,640
Oh, it hurts down here?

1400
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,540
(Next, Yusen sings the main vocalist part.)

1401
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:55,550
- Hey, that was stable. - He can reach those notes.

1402
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:58,049
I'm not used to it yet.

1403
01:01:58,050 --> 01:01:59,050
(Because he was born in 2008.)

1404
01:01:59,051 --> 01:02:01,619
First, from our team's capabilities,

1405
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:03,789
Yusen seemed to be the best singer.

1406
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:06,230
It was a little lacking, though.

1407
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:08,529
But if he focuses and practices,

1408
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:10,530
I figured he could totally do it.

1409
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,529
Jiang Fan has a good voice too,

1410
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:15,199
but I think Yusen could hit those notes quite stably.

1411
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,200
I agree.

1412
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:20,880
The main vocalist of "Rising Sun" Team Two is...

1413
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:24,709
Drum roll.

1414
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:26,610
The main vocalist...

1415
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,619
Yusen!

1416
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:29,819
("Rising Sun" Team 2's main vocal, Yusen)

1417
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,590
Thank you! I'll do my best!

1418
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,059
- Yusen. - Yusen, you really have...

1419
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:36,690
a huge responsibility, just as much as the killing part.

1420
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:39,159
I became the main vocalist in the first mission.

1421
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,441
I'll totally rip up the performance as the main vocalist.

1422
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,700
I'll practice hard.

1423

1424
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:52,570

(Singing)

1426
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:59,080
- Over there... - They're good too.

1427
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,480
It's Yusen.

1428
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,380
I heard it from nearby,

1429
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,990
but I didn't feel like he was my competition.

1430
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:08,320
("Rising Sun" practice room)

1431

(He can't escape the never-ending cycle of "For me.")

1436
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:25,909
He has the loudest voice,

1437
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:29,209
and it's good that he's doing this with so much passion,

1438
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:31,380
but I wish he could be a little quieter...

1439
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:34,820
(The high-note runaway engine just can't stop.)

1440

he just belts out those high notes like a siren.

1446
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,730
I don't know how his throat is still okay.

1447
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:53,050
It was fascinating to watch.

1454
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:17,929
and I was born in 2010.

1455
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:19,990
I'm most confident in dance and rap.

I'm Song Min Jae,

01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:23,900
and I dance and sing.

1458
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,529
I'm Ko Ming Chieh, a WAKEONE trainee.

1459
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:29,170
I've never learned K-pop dance.

I'm not represented by an agency.

1462
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:38,010
Vocals? Okay. Dance? Okay.

1463
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:39,980
Rap? A bit.

1464
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:42,520
It's okay.

1465
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:43,850
You can do it.

1466
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:46,690
For me, rap is...

1467
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:49,890
- It's okay. Sure. - Okay.

1468
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:52,929
Well, we met the participants from PLANET C for the first time.

1469
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:55,060
We didn't really know how talented they were.

1470
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:57,369
I was kind of worried.

1471
01:04:57,370 --> 01:04:59,850
They didn't look very confident from their facial expressions.

1472
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:01,640
We should try hard.

1473
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,839

You will begin dividing the parts from now on.

1476

You have to pick a leader to lead your team.

1477
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:15,679
The leader has the mighty authority to decide...

1478
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:19,189
who gets every single part, including the killing part,

Well, I do have experience.

1483
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:31,370
I thought I could be the leader to avoid frustration...

1484
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:34,900
and to take things in the direction I want to quickly.

1485
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:40,139
If you guys are okay with it, I'll do it.

1486
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:41,240

I also think that In Hu's voice suits the song better too.

1581
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:36,440
But the biggest reason I can't choose In Hu...

1582
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:38,610
is because of the last rap part.

1583
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,410
- Oh, right. - There's that part too.

1584
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:46,550
(There's a rap part that the main vocalist must perform.)

1585
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:51,060
(The two tried the last rap part a while ago.)

1586
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:53,329
(Jo Gye Hyeon did the rap part without any issues.)

1587
01:09:53,330 --> 01:09:54,399
Okay.

1588
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,500
What do I do?

1589
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,470
(Kim In Hu looked nervous on the other hand.)

1590
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:01,500
Bling bling, my class is S-Class

1591
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:03,939
Bling bling

1592
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:06,270
(He did the rap part with a stiff tone.)

1593
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:08,480
Well, I've never rapped before,

1594
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:11,150
and I don't have any confidence in myself.

1595
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:13,280
I'm not good at showing off myself.

1596
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:16,061
We have to decide based on the best we can get right now.

1597
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:20,320
I think you lost your points with that part.

1598
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:21,460
I agree.

1599
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:23,159
Can we decide on me getting the part then?

1600
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,690
- Yes. - Right. We can do that.

1601
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,460
We're all leaning toward Gye Hyeon getting the part.

1602
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:31,829
- You will use your throat a lot, - You did well, In Hu.

1603
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:33,330
- so always be careful. - Okay.

1604
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:35,900
There are still three parts left. It's okay.

1605
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:38,809
First sub-vocalist.

1606
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:40,639
I will go for this one, as I'm Seo Won.

1607
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:41,640
- Okay. - I'll go for it too.

1608
01:10:41,641 --> 01:10:43,180
Seo Won for this one.

1609
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:45,350
Kang Min will go for it too. What about you, In Hu?

1610
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:46,850
Well...

1611
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:49,300
The part is similar to the main vocalist's part.

1612
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:51,689
- I'm not confident in rapping. - I see.

1613
01:10:51,690 --> 01:10:54,320
So you want to get a part that doesn't have much rapping.

1614
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:55,659
- I don't have the confidence. - But if you look at the song,

1615
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:56,689
all parts have rapping.

1616
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:58,459
There are rap parts for the 2nd and 3rd sub-vocalists.

1617
01:10:58,460 --> 01:10:59,959
- For now... - For now...

1618
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:01,499
- Let's hear it first. - It'll be your call.

1619
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,500
- Okay. - Okay.

1620
01:11:03,730 --> 01:11:05,570
I didn't have any confidence in rapping,

1621
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:07,870
but all the vocalist parts had rapping.

1622
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:10,040
That was why I felt so intimidated.

1623
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,810
I just stayed still without making an attempt.

1624
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:18,210
(Kim In Hu delayed his part decision due to a lack of confidence.)

1625
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:21,450
The second sub-vocalist part is in the bridge.

1626
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,780
Third sub-vocalist.

1627
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:24,489
Third sub-vocalist.

1628
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:26,370
Okay. Let's go for the third sub-vocalist part.

1629
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:28,289
- In Hu. - Yes?

1630
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:31,090
Isn't the third sub-vocalist part quite doable, to be honest?

1631
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:33,890
I don't have the song down.

1632
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:37,230
If you don't take this part, you have to rap.

1633
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:40,670
This is just one line. You can practice for it.

1634
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,769
(Sighing)

1635
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:46,170
(Kim In Hu is passive about taking the parts.)

1636
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:47,840
Will you go for it, In Hu?

1637
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:51,779
But the third sub-vocalist part has a lot of rapping.

1638
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:53,079
But if you don't take this part,

1639
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,349
- you'll be rapping. - You'll be rapping anyway.

1640
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:55,910
- You have to take a rap part. - Right.

1641
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:58,950
I think you should make the decision.

1642
01:11:59,290 --> 01:12:00,350
It's all on you.

1643
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:02,390
Do you know the rap part, In Hu?

1644
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,490
- Sorry? - Do you know the rap part?

1645
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:06,760
- I do know it, but... - Right.

1646
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,920
Can you do the rap part when asked to do it right now?

1647
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:15,700
We can see how it is based on just the tone.

1648
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:17,740
"Kick it." This part.

1649
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:23,040
(Everyone is paying attention to Kim In Hu's part selection.)

1650
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:27,920
(He has stopped speaking.)

1651
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:34,249
(How will things pan out for Team 1 of "S-Class...")

1652
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:36,360
(in the midst of the cold atmosphere?)

1653
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,190
(Team 2 of "S-Class" is still practising.)

1654
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:41,859
(The participants are getting used to the song...)

1655
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:43,660
(before the part distribution.)

1656
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:45,770
(Checking)

1657
01:12:46,130 --> 01:12:47,200
(Checking)

1658
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,640
(Song Min Jae quietly looked at his teammates.)

1659
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,010
Try singing this part.

1660
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:59,250
(Kim Young Jun sings the vocalist part as per his request.)

1661
01:12:59,510 --> 01:13:00,779
Okay.

1662
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:02,080
Right. Thank you.

1663
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:05,390
(He moves over to someone else after hearing one line.)

1664
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:06,890
Try this part.

1665
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:10,220
(He makes Ham Hyun Seo do the rap part this time.)

1666
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:13,160
Okay. I got it.

1667
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:15,159
Can you try singing this part?

1668
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:19,900
(Song Min Jae hears all of his teammates' parts.)

1669
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:21,569
Without falling

1670
01:13:21,570 --> 01:13:22,970
I don't think I can do it.

1671
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:26,240
I heard from each teammate...

1672
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:27,640
on purpose.

1673
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,279
- Shall we give it a try? - Sorry?

1674
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,410
- Shall we give it a try now? - Try what?

1675
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,620
The part distribution. Should we practice more?

1676
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:35,849
- Sorry? - Will we decide...

1677
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:36,930
after practising some more?

1678
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:39,150
Well, we'll do it soon.

1679
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:41,120
Hold on.

1680
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:43,660
The part distribution...

1681
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,330
was already decided on my list.

1682
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:49,160
- Shall we all gather? - Yes.

1683
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:51,430
(Leader Song Min Jae gathers the teammates.)

1684
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:53,800
I wanted to be the main vocalist.

1685
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:57,970
I want to take the killing part.

1686
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:01,810
I personally want to take the killing part.

1687
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:06,780
(The participants prepare themselves before the part distribution.)

1688
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:10,180
I heard everyone try the parts.

1689
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:13,020
I came up with the parts while listening.

1690
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:15,230
I came up with the parts while listening.

1691
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:21,030
Including the killing part,

1692
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:24,570
the leader will be given a strong right...

1693
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:26,510
to be able to decide on all parts of the song.

1694
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:28,900
I will call out the parts I came up with.

1695
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:31,190
Young Jun will get the second sub-vocalist part.

1696
01:14:31,370 --> 01:14:32,730
Hyeon Seo will be the main rapper.

1697
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,139
You can take the second sub-rapper part.

1698
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:35,339
- Second sub-rapper? - Yes.

1699
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:37,610
Da Wit will take the third sub-rapper part.

1700
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:39,250
Right. Got it.

1701
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:41,580
The first sub-vocalist part...

1702
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:43,280
will be taken by me.

1703
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:49,590
It's quite disappointing,

1704
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:52,360
but I'm someone who can't complain.

1705
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,060
And...

1706
01:14:58,770 --> 01:14:59,770
well,

1707
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:02,040
you have to practice a lot.

1708
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:03,400
Right.

1709
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:04,500
Main vocalist.

1710
01:15:04,570 --> 01:15:06,010
- Thank you! - Make sure to do well.

1711
01:15:06,110 --> 01:15:07,110
Main vocalist.

1712
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:09,109
(Bowing)

1713
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:10,310
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1714
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:12,049
Let's do this!

1715
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:14,386
(The biggest beneficiary of the part distribution is made.)

1716
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:18,089
I was given the main vocalist part.

1717
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:22,490
I got really surprised when the leader gave me that part.

1718
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:25,760
I felt grateful that he trusted me.

1719
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:27,390
Let's do this.

1720
01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:28,730
And...

1721
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:31,000
the killing part...

1722
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:33,069
(What is Leader Song Min Jae's decision on the killing part...)

1723
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:34,700
(that everyone wishes to get?)

1724
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:39,039
I will take it for now.

1725
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:40,040
Okay.

1726
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:41,956
I definitely want to do the killing part.

1727
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:43,980
I imagined myself taking it.

1728
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:47,750
I will take it for now.

1729
01:15:48,150 --> 01:15:52,420
(The teammates get flustered by the leader's decision.)

1730
01:15:53,150 --> 01:15:54,910
To be honest, I thought it was quite unfair.

1731
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:57,260
To be honest, I couldn't understand the decision.

1732
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:01,400
There will be a lot of hardships and suffering,

1733
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:05,600
but the picture that I have in mind is perfect.

1734
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:07,900
I'm confident.

1735
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:10,970
Which team seems the strongest?

1736
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:12,769
Yumeki in the All Star Class.

1737
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:14,679
- The team with Yumeki. - Yumeki's team.

1738
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:15,710
Yumeki's team.

1739
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:18,210
I think it's Yumeki's team.

1740
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:21,050
The participants in the team were all high in rank.

1741
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:24,480
I believe it's a team with great balance.

1742
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:26,990
This team is so strong.

1743
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:31,560
(Zhou An Xin is the only PLANET C participant in Team 1.)

1744
01:16:31,730 --> 01:16:34,530
I think the participants in our team are all talented.

1745
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:35,860
I feel very nervous.

1746
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,200
I am Lee Leo, and I was born in 2002.

1747
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:42,170
I am Lee Sang Won, and I was born in 2003.

1748
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:44,869
Hello. I am An Xin, and I was born in 2006.

1749
01:16:44,870 --> 01:16:46,910
I am a vocalist.

1750
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:48,539
It's great to have you.

1751
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:49,909
Can we just call you An Xin?

1752
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:51,680
Yes. You can call me Xin.

1753
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:53,350
- Xin? - Xin?

1754
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:54,820
God?

1755
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:56,549
- God. - Okay.

1756
01:16:56,550 --> 01:16:57,996
(Team 1 of "Whiplash" has Xin with them.)

1757
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:00,150
(Meanwhile, Team 2 of "Whiplash...")

1758
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:02,419
(Solemn)

1759
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:03,490
Okay.

1760
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:05,690
(Sighing)

1761
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:08,030
(After their opponent was decided...)

1762
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:11,470
We're in trouble.

1763
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:13,870
Let's just enjoy ourselves before we go.

1764
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:15,870
I want to go back to Japan.

1765
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:18,340
(Their opponents make them want to go back home.)

1766
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:21,310
"Gosh, we're doomed."

1767
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:22,980
Our opponent was too strong.

1768
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:24,710
We have no hope.

1769
01:17:25,410 --> 01:17:26,849
What do we do now?

1770
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:28,196
(While everyone is feeling depressed...)

1771
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:30,350
He received All Star in his first performance.

1772
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:31,689
(Surprised)

1773
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:32,750
- Gosh. - Really?

1774
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:34,489
- All of us. - All of us.

1775
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:36,059
- All Star. - We were all All Star.

1776
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:40,060
(Change of mood)

1777
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:42,099
(PLANET C Class Placement Match)

1778
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:45,270
(Fan Zhe Yi left a strong impression with his looks and skills.)

1779
01:17:45,670 --> 01:17:48,739
(Sun Jia Yang caught people's eyes...)

1780
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:51,340
(with cuteness and overflowing talent.)

1781
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:56,980
(Peng Jin Yu showed unexpected charm with powerful dance.)

1782
01:17:57,580 --> 01:17:59,049
It's feasible.

1783
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:00,179
You did a good job picking them.

1784
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:01,460
(The one who picked the members)

1785
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,120
I knew everything.

1786
01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:06,120
I chose them since I thought they had basic skills.

1787
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:11,960
(Reaction of someone who knew everything but acted as he didn't)

1788
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:13,459
Since we are competing against such a strong team...

1789
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:14,899
we should do our best.

1790
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:16,899
- We can win. - We can win.

1791
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,069
- We can win. - We can do it.

1792
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:19,070
We can do it.

1793
01:18:19,071 --> 01:18:20,529
They are the Avengers.

1794
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:22,000
All we need to do is become Thanos.

1795
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:24,840
(Doesn't Thanos lose?)

1796
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:27,970
- Let's do this. - Let's do it.

1797
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,480
- For the main part... - Yes?

1798
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,480
The killing part is important.

1799
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:36,449
(The killing part of "Whiplash" left a strong impact.)

1800
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:38,820
It is such a famous chorus.

1801
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:40,349
And it's highly addictive.

1802
01:18:40,350 --> 01:18:42,359
I thought coming out for that one part...

1803
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:43,620
would be important.

1804
01:18:43,990 --> 01:18:45,360
I want to do the killing part.

1805
01:18:45,730 --> 01:18:46,789
Who wants to do it?

1806
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:47,929
(Applicants for the killing part: Kim Geon Woo, Kim Jun Seo, )

1807
01:18:47,930 --> 01:18:48,999
(Shou An Xin, Hsu Ching Yu)

1808
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,900
- I want to try out too. - Right.

1809
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:55,400
(Killing part candidate 1: Kim Geon Woo)

1810
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:58,910
(Killing part candidate 2: Zhou An Xin)

1811
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:02,810
(Candidate 3: Kim Jun Seo, Candidate 4: Hsu Ching Yu)

1812
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:06,950
(Killing part candidate 4: Lee Sang Won)

1813
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:09,520
(Satisfied)

1814
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:11,689
(3 people apart from the candidates discuss separately.)

1815
01:19:11,690 --> 01:19:13,066
Let's share our thoughts one by one.

1816
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:14,650
For me, it's Sang Won.

1817
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:16,030
- Geon Woo. - Me too. Geon Woo.

1818
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:17,720
I choose Geon Woo no matter.

1819
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:19,729
(Does the killing part go to Kim Geon Woo...)

1820
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:21,699
(with the result of 2 on 1?)

1821
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:23,560
If I dare tell you my thoughts,

1822
01:19:23,730 --> 01:19:26,870
the overall picture is important for this.

1823
01:19:27,070 --> 01:19:29,000
But he's the least one to not feel out of place.

1824
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:30,799
He is the most natural.

1825
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,046
And I thought he was the closest to the mood of the song.

1826
01:19:33,070 --> 01:19:34,569
Then let's choose from the two candidates.

1827
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:35,856
- Let's see them one by one again. - Okay.

1828
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,186
(Killing part candidate 1: Lee Sang Won)

1829
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:38,380
One look give them Whiplash

1830
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,150
Beat drop with a big flash

1831
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,020
Concentrate more, think fast

1832
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:43,780
You don't understand the reason

1833
01:19:44,650 --> 01:19:46,589
(Killing part candidate 2: Kim Geon Woo)

1834
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:48,320
Beat drop with a big flash

1835
01:19:48,490 --> 01:19:49,820
Concentrate more, think fast

1836
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:51,660
You don't understand the reason

1837
01:19:52,890 --> 01:19:55,930
For me, if you take a look at the mood of the song,

1838
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,759
there's this decadent charm...

1839
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,329
- in Sang Won. - Yes, that's right.

1840
01:19:59,330 --> 01:20:02,770
I thought of giving that a chance.

1841
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,870
I think he fits the part to become the face of the song, "Whiplash."

1842
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:09,310
I agree with him 100 percent.

1843
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:11,660
The one to take the part the killing part is...

1844
01:20:12,010 --> 01:20:13,079
- Sang Won. - Yes.

1845
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:15,550
(Lee Sang Won as Team 1's killing part for "Whiplash.")

1846
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:16,820
Let's do this.

1847
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:19,490
I thought that he absolutely played the part well.

1848
01:20:19,650 --> 01:20:20,930
I think we made a good decision.

1849
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:23,620
(Now, it's time to choose the main rapper.)

1850
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:25,830
(Main rapper candidate 1: Kim Geon Woo)

1851
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,690
Concentrate more, think fast

1852
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:29,859
(Main rapper candidate 2: Yoon Min)

1853
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:31,800
Beat drop with a big flash

1854
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:33,199
When I choose the members,

1855
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,200
I thought Yoon Min would be the main rapper.

1856
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:37,199
I painted such a picture,

1857
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,340
so I chose Yoon Min.

1858
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:42,809
Personally, I choose Geon Woo.

1859
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:44,540
(I choose Geon Woo.)

1860
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:47,080
When I see this, this is the first part.

1861
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:50,750
(The main rapper part opens the song.)

1862
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:54,420
If Geon Woo comes in with the husky tone first...

1863
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:56,689
and Yoon Min comes in after him,

1864
01:20:56,690 --> 01:20:58,629
I think it would feel better...

1865
01:20:58,630 --> 01:21:00,006
when you listen to the song and when you look at the stage.

1866
01:21:00,030 --> 01:21:01,089
(Agreeing)

1867
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:03,029
- I think that sounds right. - Right.

1868
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:04,129
I think that's important.

1869
01:21:04,130 --> 01:21:06,869
Since Leo has lots of experience with the vocal part,

1870
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:10,369
I think he thinks well about...

1871
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:12,439
who would fit better in what part.

1872
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:16,240
So I think we trusted Leo's opinion a lot.

1873
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:18,879
In conclusion, the part goes to Geon Woo.

1874
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,779
(Kim Geon Woo as Team 1's main rapper for "Whiplash")

1875
01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:21,849
- Really? - Yes.

1876
01:21:21,850 --> 01:21:23,779
We need someone to take the part as the main vocalist.

1877
01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:25,540
Who wants to take part as the main vocalist?

1878
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:27,120
(Raising the hand high)

1879
01:21:27,121 --> 01:21:28,890
- Yes. - Zhou An Xin. Good.

1880
01:21:29,290 --> 01:21:31,729
Honestly, I haven't seen his vocal skills.

1881
01:21:31,730 --> 01:21:33,230
So I worry about it a little.

1882
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:34,790
How will he do the part?

1883
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,299
(Zhou An Xin sings the main vocalist part.)

1884
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:44,339
It won't disappear

1885
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:46,209
Imprinted in the eye one time

1886
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:49,940
Unforgettable

1887
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:53,179
(Everyone approves of the stable vocal skills.)

1888
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:55,520
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1889
01:21:56,050 --> 01:21:57,079
Good job.

1890
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:58,350
He sings so well.

1891
01:21:58,590 --> 01:22:01,420
And somehow, he fits with the song well.

1892
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:02,890
I am so satisfied.

1893
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:05,590
I'll do my best from now on...

1894
01:22:05,730 --> 01:22:07,460
and show you my best side.

1895
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:09,700
(All the parts are divided.)

1896
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:14,100
(Team 1 and 2 for "Whiplash" gathered in the practice room.)

1897
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:18,170
(They don't know the parts for the opposing team.)

1898
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:23,616
The most important part is the killing part.

1899
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:24,739
We don't need to be deceiving.

1900
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:26,080
(Relentless footsteps)

1901
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:28,049
(Is Lee Leo in charge of Team 1's killing part?)

1902
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:29,720
(It isn't Lee Leo?)

1903
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:33,750
- You're not it. - It's me.

1904
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,089
(Lee Sang Won as Team 1's killing part for "Whiplash")

1905
01:22:35,090 --> 01:22:36,920
- Yes. - Let's go.

1906
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:38,330
Okay.

1907
01:22:38,490 --> 01:22:39,660
Let's go, Darina.

1908
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:41,929
The killing part goes to Daniel.

1909
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:43,159
(Kim Daniel as Team 2's killing part for "Whiplash")

1910
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,200
It's me.

1911
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,800
(Lee Sang Won versus Kim Daniel)

1912
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:50,770
I will easily tread on you.

1913
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:56,140
I trust that Sang Won will say something stronger than that.

1914
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:57,340
We have high expectations.

1915
01:22:57,610 --> 01:22:59,180
(What is Lee Sang Won's one word?)

1916
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:01,410
I will show you what killing part means.

1917
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,750
I will show you what killing part means.

1918
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:08,220
(Cheering)

1919
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:11,789
(It had zero impact with such a soft punch for his ambitions.)

1920
01:23:11,790 --> 01:23:12,930
No, this is his best.

1921
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:14,730
This was his best.

1922
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:16,700
- Main vocalist. - Okay.

1923
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:19,269
Guess who is our main vocalist.

1924
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:21,229
(Fan Zhe Yi as Team 2's main vocalist for "Whiplash")

1925
01:23:21,230 --> 01:23:22,299
Fan Zhe Yi.

1926
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:23,440
Fan Zhe Yi.

1927
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:25,309
- Please step forward. - That's it.

1928
01:23:25,310 --> 01:23:27,470
(Zhou An Xin as Team 1's main vocalist for "Whiplash")

1929
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:29,210
For real?

1930
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:30,679
(Zhou An Xin and Fan Zhe Yi as main vocalists)

1931
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:32,120
It's a competition between PLANET C.

1932
01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:35,379
(A showdown between the two who took 1st and 2nd place...)

1933
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:38,180
(on the 2nd episode of BOYS II PLANET C.)

1934
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:39,989
Who is sub-rapper number three?

1935
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:41,549
(Who will be final sub-rapper 3's battle opponent?)

1936
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:42,690
He's coming.

1937
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:46,890
(Rensho's threatening provocation)

1938
01:23:50,530 --> 01:23:52,769
(Team 1's sub-rapper 3, Yumeki's counterattack)

1939
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:54,830
(Yumeki versus Rensho)

1940
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:57,669
(If they deviate even a little, it's a fatal blow to each other.)

1941
01:23:57,670 --> 01:24:00,270
- Go. - Fight.

1942
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,350
- That was good. - Please stick your name.

1943
01:24:05,610 --> 01:24:08,286
(Team 1 and 2 for "Whiplash" have confirmed their battle opponents.)

1944
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:10,750
One, two, three, four.

1945
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:13,390
(Unlike Team 2 that is checking the choreography)

1946
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:14,589
Two, three.

1947
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:17,019
(Team 1 is already learning the choreography.)

1948
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:18,059
The move we did before.

1949
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:19,790
(Right after they chose their parts)

1950
01:24:20,190 --> 01:24:23,500
(Yumeki copied the choreography right then and there.)

1951
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:26,200
One, two, three, four,

1952
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:27,770
five, six, and...

1953
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:31,069
So I think we should each memorize our position.

1954
01:24:31,070 --> 01:24:33,069
Yes. We should learn our individual part.

1955
01:24:33,070 --> 01:24:35,239
(They checked their individual position according to the flow.)

1956
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:37,109
(Scanning the flow of movement)

1957
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:38,409
(They are moving with ease as if they were a team from before.)

1958
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:39,410
And moving...

1959
01:24:39,411 --> 01:24:41,931
(They are moving with ease as if they were a team from before.)

1960
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:44,480
Okay. That was good.

1961
01:24:44,481 --> 01:24:46,050
- That's good. - This feeling is good.

1962
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:48,320
I brought those who are good.

1963
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:50,620
I had no worries performance-wise.

1964
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:52,659
Five, six, seven.

1965
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:53,660
(On the other hand)

1966
01:24:53,661 --> 01:24:55,229
(Team 2 is practising under...)

1967
01:24:55,230 --> 01:24:56,870
(Lee Seung Baek and Rensho's leadership.)

1968
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:59,370
One, two, three.

1969
01:25:00,370 --> 01:25:01,870
One, two, what was it?

1970
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,600
Stop.

1971
01:25:04,601 --> 01:25:06,969
(Rensho pauses because he can't remember the choreography.)

1972
01:25:06,970 --> 01:25:10,910
(Fan Zhe Yi follows, thinking that it's a move.)

1973
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:14,380
(Rensho's choreography class resumes.)

1974
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:16,049
Are you moving to the left?

1975
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:17,319
Are you moving to the right here?

1976
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:19,320
- Am I going to the right? - I don't know.

1977
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:21,090
- Were you asking me? - Yes.

1978
01:25:22,590 --> 01:25:23,590
- Okay? - Yes.

1979
01:25:23,591 --> 01:25:24,620
- Do you know? - Yes.

1980
01:25:25,230 --> 01:25:26,830
- Who is this? - It's this.

1981
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:28,190
Who is this?

1982
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:30,829
Okay.

1983
01:25:30,830 --> 01:25:32,306
(Finally, he figured out the flow of movement?)

1984
01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:33,370
Seung Baek.

1985
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:35,030
Do this for me. I can't do this.

1986
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:36,840
- Which one? - I'm not smart enough.

1987
01:25:39,170 --> 01:25:42,040
(The gap between practising between the teams is widening.)

1988
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:44,380
We were slow in speed as well.

1989
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:48,250
So I felt bad for the other participants.

1990
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:51,020
I think I have to wake up.

1991
01:25:53,150 --> 01:25:54,389
(First class battle preparation)

1992
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:56,119
(The day in the practice room ended.)

1993
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:58,729
(It's the night where PLANET K and PLANET C meet their new roommates.)

1994
01:25:58,730 --> 01:25:59,730
(Exclaiming)

1995
01:25:59,731 --> 01:26:00,960
Why is it on the third floor?

1996
01:26:01,730 --> 01:26:02,900
Gosh. This is so heavy.

1997
01:26:03,730 --> 01:26:05,206
Gosh. It's crazy that we're on the third floor.

1998
01:26:05,230 --> 01:26:07,469
(Mass movement to welcome new roommates)

1999
01:26:07,470 --> 01:26:09,340
(What will happen tonight?)

2000
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:11,100
(Knocking)

2001
01:26:11,101 --> 01:26:12,310
(Who is it?)

2002
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:13,710
- Who is it? - Who?

2003
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:15,280
Are they here?

2004
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:17,110
Hey.

2005
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:19,309
Max the power.

2006
01:26:19,310 --> 01:26:21,609
- Max the power. - Max the power.

2007
01:26:21,610 --> 01:26:22,919
(Li Zi Hao and Xue Su Ren move in.)

2008
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,120
- Come on in. - My gosh.

2009
01:26:25,050 --> 01:26:27,210
- This is our room. - You have to take your shoes off.

2010
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:28,589
(Oh, right.)

2011
01:26:28,590 --> 01:26:29,989
(Li Zi Hao's shoes intruded into the room.)

2012
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:31,119
- What are you doing? - What are you doing?

2013
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,359
- I'm sorry. - Your shoes.

2014
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:33,459
I'm sorry.

2015
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:35,960
- You're in a hurry. - You're rushing.

2016
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,100
So, for now...

2017
01:26:39,630 --> 01:26:41,129
Make some noise!

2018
01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:42,939
(Welcome to the room.)

2019
01:26:42,940 --> 01:26:43,969
(All Star Camp)

2020
01:26:43,970 --> 01:26:45,469
- Hello. - You came.

2021
01:26:45,470 --> 01:26:46,470
(PLANET C's All Star Participants also completed the move-in.)

2022
01:26:46,471 --> 01:26:48,409
- You are my roommate. - Yes.

2023
01:26:48,410 --> 01:26:49,480
I've been waiting.

2024
01:26:50,610 --> 01:26:52,150
- What's up, Zhou An Xin? - Hi.

2025
01:26:52,610 --> 01:26:54,579
(A generous welcome for Zhou An Xin)

2026
01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:55,649
- Yes. - Yes.

2027
01:26:55,650 --> 01:26:56,779
("Whiplash" Team 1 became close really fast.)

2028
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:57,850
- Welcome. - Welcome.

2029
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:00,849
(He is impressed by the spacious and pleasant All Star Camp.)

2030
01:27:00,850 --> 01:27:02,019
Welcome.

2031
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:03,119
(He is camera-shy.)

2032
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,720
Wait. Zhou An Xin, your shoes...

2033
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:06,830
(Zhou An Xin walked in with his shoes on.)

2034
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:08,599
I'm sorry.

2035
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,429
(He left faster than light.)

2036
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:11,560
Let's go downstairs.

2037
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,730
- There's something really fun. - Let's go.

2038
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,739
Oh, my gosh.

2039
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:16,940
(Snack room only for All Star)

2040
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,720
(They have been upgraded with new snacks.)

2041
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:21,369
(The All Star snack room filled with...)

2042
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:24,979
(refreshing drinks and snacks of all kinds.)

2043
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:26,350
Gosh. Sprite. This is legendary.

2044
01:27:27,550 --> 01:27:29,049
(Taking a sip)

2045
01:27:29,050 --> 01:27:32,020
It's nice to mix the two of them.

2046
01:27:33,450 --> 01:27:35,319
(The electrifying taste of the outside world)

2047
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,389
This is it.

2048
01:27:36,390 --> 01:27:37,719
(Nian Bo Heng and Zhang Jia Hao join the group.)

2049
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:40,090
(PLANET K and C become one through snacks.)

2050
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:41,680
Do we get these snacks every day?

2051
01:27:41,860 --> 01:27:44,960
They disappear once in a while. They disappear when we eat them all.

2052
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:46,806
(They want to enjoy the perks of the All Star Class every day.)

2053
01:27:46,830 --> 01:27:47,999
(1 Star and 2 Star Camp)

2054
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,039
(Sighing)

2055
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,940
(Deep sighs echo in the camp.)

2056
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,770
(Kim Dong Yun is deep in thought.)

2057
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:56,030
I began to have a bit of a mental breakdown.

2058
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,309
Everyone was looking at me, the leader.

2059
01:27:59,310 --> 01:28:01,849
But I had no experience of being a leader.

2060
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:04,120
The position of the leader was too much.

2061
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:06,789
(Kim Dong Yun is the youngest one of a 6-member boy group, DRIPPIN.)

2062
01:28:06,790 --> 01:28:08,519
(He became the leader for the 1st time...)

2063
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:09,690
(in Team 2 for "Rising Sun.")

2064
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:11,380
It's my first time being a leader.

2065
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:13,990
I seriously don't know what to do.

2066
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:17,276
(The rookie leader, Kim Dong Yun is having a mental breakdown.)

2067
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:18,829
What should we do with practice?

2068
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:20,729
What comes first, the choreography or the formation?

2069
01:28:20,730 --> 01:28:22,069
- The choreography comes 1st. - The choreography comes 1st.

2070
01:28:22,070 --> 01:28:24,399
We should learn them at once when there isn't much time.

2071
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:26,160
(While the participants share their worries)

2072
01:28:26,370 --> 01:28:29,809
("Rising Sun" echoes in the dark corridor.)

2073
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:32,149
(Singing)

2074
01:28:32,150 --> 01:28:34,579
(Yusen practices the high notes while looking at the camera.)

2075
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:37,720
I'm going crazy. I don't think I can hit the high notes.

2076
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:41,590
If I make a mistake, it'll be a disaster.

2077
01:28:42,690 --> 01:28:43,760
It'll be over.

2078
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:46,490
I'm a bit nervous.

2079
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:48,700
Will I be able to do well?

2080
01:28:49,630 --> 01:28:52,470
I can't get eliminated here.

2081
01:28:53,930 --> 01:28:58,040
(The first mission of BOYS II PLANET begins in earnest.)

2082
01:28:58,870 --> 01:29:02,840
(Wanting to do well, they practice in the dormitory.)

2083
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:05,280
I'm very worried.

2084
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:09,480
"Will I be able to do well?" There's that anxiety.

2085
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:12,060
I'll need to practice as if my life depended on it.

2086
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,190
This is the actual beginning.

2087
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:15,690
Let's do well.

2088
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,990
(The 1st night deepens as they worry about the 1st stage.)

2089
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:25,700
(Good luck!)

2090
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:29,020
(We're doing well, so let's stay confident and be sexier!)

2091
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:34,540
I think this could be my first and last performance.

2092
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:38,610
We're the ones who could go home with a single mistake.

2093
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:40,380
We can't help but be more desperate.

2094
01:29:43,650 --> 01:29:45,520
(Good luck!)

2095
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:48,620
I feel like we can win.

2096
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:50,590
I don't think that we'll lose.

2097
01:29:51,020 --> 01:29:52,760
We can win, no matter what.

2098
01:29:56,230 --> 01:29:58,030
I won't leave any regrets in my life.

2099
01:29:58,230 --> 01:30:00,130
I'll show everyone what I can do.

2100
01:30:00,530 --> 01:30:03,400
(I'll create a miracle.)

2101
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:10,309
(The site of the 1-on-1 Class Battle)

2102
01:30:10,310 --> 01:30:15,920
(Many Star Creators gathered around to watch the first performances.)

2103
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:18,449
(Various signs contain heartfelt messages of support.)

2104
01:30:18,450 --> 01:30:21,389
Tofu with unexpected charms, Hsu Ching Yu, let's go!

2105
01:30:21,390 --> 01:30:23,289
Let's go! Let's debut!

2106
01:30:23,290 --> 01:30:24,290
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2107
01:30:24,291 --> 01:30:25,829
(Kim Jun Seo)

2108
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:27,659
Zhang Jia Hao, I love you.

2109
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:28,799
Yang Heui Chan, good luck!

2110
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,759
- Jae Hyun, let's debut! - Sang Won, let's debut!

2111
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:33,029
- Let's go to the finals! Good luck! - Let's go to the finals! Good luck!

2112
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:35,670
(Jun Lee Jeong, Kim Jun Min)

2113
01:30:35,770 --> 01:30:37,300
(What are the participants doing?)

2114
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:42,310
(They're getting transformed to meet the Star Creators.)

2115
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:43,809
(Star Creators, please wait.)

2116
01:30:43,810 --> 01:30:45,079
Are you very nervous?

2117
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:47,279
Yes, I'm very nervous.

2118
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:49,280
- Are you in good condition? - Con?

2119
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:51,019
(I still find Korean hard.)

2120
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:52,620
Everyone in our team is ugly.

2121
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:55,419
- Including you? - I'm in charge of the visuals.

2122
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:56,989
(I'm in charge of the visuals.)

2123
01:30:56,990 --> 01:30:59,430
We can do it. We can do it, Jun Ho.

2124
01:30:59,730 --> 01:31:00,959
(Feeling nervous and excited, )

2125
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:02,636
(they go to the stage for the first mission.)

2126
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:05,100
(Star Creators fill the audience's seats.)

2127
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:08,500
(Very excited)

2128
01:31:08,870 --> 01:31:10,070
Good luck!

2129
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:13,220
(The signal song, "HOLA SOLAR" marks the beginning of the first mission.)

2130
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:15,469
(Hsu Ching Yu, Jang Han Eum)

2131
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:16,780
(What? What's going on?)

2132
01:31:17,710 --> 01:31:19,630
(Silhouettes appear from the back of the stage.)

2133
01:31:21,010 --> 01:31:22,319
(Sang Won)

2134
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:23,480
(Lee Sang Won)

2135
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:27,089
(Participants appear between the audience's seats.)

2136
01:31:27,090 --> 01:31:29,920
I realized that many Star Creators were rooting for us.

2137
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:32,789
It felt very nice. It also felt strange.

2138
01:31:32,790 --> 01:31:34,359
(Yoo Kang Min)

2139
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:37,060
I was both nervous and very excited.

2140
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:41,299
There were more Star Creators than I had imagined,

2141
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:43,040
so I felt grateful.

2142
01:31:43,940 --> 01:31:46,410
(Star Creators capture the moment with their cameras.)

2143
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:48,810
(Chen Kai Wen)

2144
01:31:48,910 --> 01:31:50,509
(Star Creator's on-site fancam)

2145
01:31:50,510 --> 01:31:54,049
Jun Min!

2146
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:55,879
(Star Creator's on-site fancam)

2147
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:58,619
Show your charms!

2148
01:31:58,620 --> 01:31:59,920
Look over here!

2149
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,020
He Zhong Xing!

2150
01:32:03,190 --> 01:32:04,789
- He Xin Long! - He Xin Long!

2151
01:32:04,790 --> 01:32:08,230
When people chanted, "He Xin Long," I felt so happy.

2152
01:32:08,330 --> 01:32:12,200
The Star Creators were quite close, so I felt embarrassed.

2153
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:16,400
(They enter as they receive the Star Creators' support.)

2154
01:32:20,170 --> 01:32:23,009
I made an effort to make eye contact with everyone.

2155
01:32:23,010 --> 01:32:26,450
They even made me think, "I'll be able to perform well."

2156
01:32:26,550 --> 01:32:29,820
I was thankful and grateful. It was fascinating.

2157
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,090
(The studio suddenly turns dark.)

2158
01:32:43,330 --> 01:32:46,199
(Planet Master came to the site of the 1st class battle mission.)

2159
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:47,530
(Sang Won)

2160
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:52,000
(Who is it?)

2161
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:59,249
(Planet Master of BOYS II PLANET, Ong Seong Wu)

2162
01:32:59,250 --> 01:33:00,579
(Lee Sang Won)

2163
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:02,010
(Dong Hyun)

2164
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:06,190
(Planet Master, Ong Seong Wu)

2165
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:07,650
(Lee Sang Won, Chung Sang Hyeon)

2166
01:33:07,890 --> 01:33:09,620
Hello, Star Creators.

2167
01:33:09,820 --> 01:33:12,190
I'm Planet Master Ong Seong Wu.

2168
01:33:12,290 --> 01:33:15,630
(It's nice to meet you.)

2169
01:33:15,730 --> 01:33:18,459
Today, the participants of BOYS II PLANET...

2170
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:21,969
will give their performances for the first mission.

2171
01:33:21,970 --> 01:33:25,340
(Screaming)

2172
01:33:27,470 --> 01:33:30,410
The first mission of BOYS II PLANET is...

2173
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,710
(Drumroll)

2174
01:33:33,910 --> 01:33:35,650
(We're curious!)

2175
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:38,749
the 1-on-1 Class Battle.

2176
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:40,490
(1-on-1 Class Battle)

2177
01:33:40,590 --> 01:33:42,860
(1-on-1 Class Battle)

2178
01:33:43,290 --> 01:33:45,090
(The 1st mission, 1-on-1 Class Battle)

2179
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:46,929
The participants who were divided in accordance with their skills...

2180
01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:51,000
into All Star, 2 Star, and 1 Star Classes...

2181
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:54,400
will have a face-off for their pride in this mission.

2182
01:33:54,530 --> 01:33:56,699
The two teams that chose the same song...

2183
01:33:56,700 --> 01:34:00,369
among five songs will become rivals...

2184
01:34:00,370 --> 01:34:02,679
and perform for survival.

2185
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:04,479
(Very excited)

2186
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:06,679
Now, I'll explain how the voting works.

2187
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:09,079
Firstly, after the end of each team's performance,

2188
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:12,149
you'll press the O button if the performance was nice...

2189
01:34:12,150 --> 01:34:15,450
or the X button if the performance was lacking.

2190
01:34:16,090 --> 01:34:17,889
Secondly, there's the individual voting.

2191
01:34:17,890 --> 01:34:21,230
After the two teams finish performing the same song,

2192
01:34:21,330 --> 01:34:24,430
the participants who had the same position...

2193
01:34:24,530 --> 01:34:27,530
will compete for the 1-on-1 rival voting.

2194
01:34:27,630 --> 01:34:29,639
The final winner of the mission will be decided...

2195
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:33,410
by adding the team score and the individual score.

2196
01:34:33,570 --> 01:34:37,809
The 1st mission of BOYS II PLANET, 1-on-1 Class Battle,

2197
01:34:37,810 --> 01:34:40,780
will begin now.

2198
01:34:41,410 --> 01:34:42,419
Boys!

2199
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:45,249
- Max the power! - Max the power!

2200
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:46,649
(He Xin Long)

2201
01:34:46,650 --> 01:34:48,090
(Jun Seo)

2202
01:34:48,190 --> 01:34:50,990
(Amidst the Star Creators' cheers, how will the participants perform?)

2203
01:34:53,030 --> 01:34:54,629
In the 1-on-1 Class Battle,

2204
01:34:54,630 --> 01:34:56,759
the performing order is very important.

2205
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:59,899
How was it decided? Did they play rock-paper-scissors?

2206
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:01,130
This was used.

2207
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:06,209
(Two games for the performing order)

2208
01:35:06,210 --> 01:35:07,269
(1.30-second ASMR eating show)

2209
01:35:07,270 --> 01:35:08,439
(The team that eats more seaweed snacks...)

2210
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:09,656
(without going over 60 decibels in 30 seconds wins.)

2211
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:10,680
(2. Difficult eating show: The team that eats more snacks...)

2212
01:35:10,681 --> 01:35:12,410
(with long chopsticks in 80 seconds wins.)

2213
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:14,056
(One bite will determine their fates!)

2214
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:16,480
(Which team will get to decide when to perform?)

2215
01:35:18,150 --> 01:35:19,289
(30-second ASMR eating show, Round 1, "Rising Sun")

2216
01:35:19,290 --> 01:35:21,210
(Masato of Team 1 versus Kim Dong Hun of Team 2)

2217
01:35:21,390 --> 01:35:24,319
(Masato calms his mind before the game begins.)

2218
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:25,420
Good.

2219
01:35:26,030 --> 01:35:28,990
Masato, who comes to your mind right now?

2220
01:35:30,730 --> 01:35:33,199
Right now, my mom in Japan comes to my mind.

2221
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:34,229
(Thinking about her in this moment is a bit too much.)

2222
01:35:34,230 --> 01:35:36,190
He's thinking about his mom before eating snacks.

2223
01:35:37,340 --> 01:35:38,970
(Mom, are you doing well?)

2224
01:35:40,270 --> 01:35:42,270
I'll make sure to win.

2225
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:44,880
Go.

2226
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:48,080
(Crunching)

2227
01:35:48,081 --> 01:35:49,520
(Sensing a crisis)

2228
01:35:49,820 --> 01:35:51,980
(He's doing his best to melt the snacks.)

2229
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,219
(The screen didn't freeze.)

2230
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:55,100
(Everything stopped except for Masato's mouth.)

2231
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:57,719
(Masato cleared 1 snack.)

2232
01:35:57,720 --> 01:35:59,019
(Surprised)

2233
01:35:59,020 --> 01:36:00,630
(Shocked)

2234
01:36:01,930 --> 01:36:03,530
(He confidently picks up another snack.)

2235
01:36:04,660 --> 01:36:05,660
(Crunching)

2236
01:36:05,661 --> 01:36:06,700
You're out.

2237
01:36:06,930 --> 01:36:08,499
- Okay. - One snack.

2238
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:10,070
- One snack. It's okay. - Come on.

2239
01:36:10,570 --> 01:36:12,090
(This man suddenly gets on his knees.)

2240
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:13,509
What is he doing?

2241
01:36:13,510 --> 01:36:15,509
(His desperate wish is...)

2242
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:16,910
(Kim Dong Yun's victory.)

2243
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:19,080
(With Ye Chan's energy, Dong Yun starts.)

2244
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:26,489
(Just like Masato, he turns on his snack-melting skills.)

2245
01:36:26,490 --> 01:36:29,190
(Nervous)

2246
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:32,690
(Kim Dong Yun cleared 1 snack.)

2247
01:36:32,890 --> 01:36:34,229
(Dong Yun is the best.)

2248
01:36:34,230 --> 01:36:36,436
(Feeling more confident, Dong Yun picks up another snack.)

2249
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:37,460
You're out.

2250
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:39,730
He's good.

2251
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:41,399
You're good.

2252
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:44,140
(They flock over to the snacks as soon as the game ends.)

2253
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:45,369
(Masato of Team 1 won by eating 1 snack in 21 seconds.)

2254
01:36:45,370 --> 01:36:46,786
(Kim Dong Yun of Team 2 lost by eating 1 snack in 25 seconds.)

2255
01:36:46,810 --> 01:36:48,709
(For "Rising Sun," Team 1 will go 1st and Team 2 will go 2nd.)

2256
01:36:48,710 --> 01:36:50,710
We'll devour the stage.

2257
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,380
- It's savoury. - It's tasty.

2258
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:56,879
(Difficult eating show)

2259
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:58,019
(Round 2, "Plot Twist")

2260
01:36:58,020 --> 01:36:59,020
(Nian Bo Heng of Team 1 versus Kim Dong Hyun B of Team 2)

2261
01:36:59,021 --> 01:37:00,989
- Look. - I can do this.

2262
01:37:00,990 --> 01:37:02,589
- Hold on. - He can't pick anything up.

2263
01:37:02,590 --> 01:37:05,089
- Some parts don't work. - Hey, Dong Hyun.

2264
01:37:05,090 --> 01:37:06,410
Be funny so that it'll get aired.

2265
01:37:06,490 --> 01:37:08,160
- Lee Jeong. - We need to win.

2266
01:37:08,630 --> 01:37:10,459
(Will he be able to win while being funny?)

2267
01:37:10,460 --> 01:37:12,220
- Keep them as close as possible. - Set, go.

2268
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:14,699
- Use your long arms. - Good.

2269
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:15,799
Use your long arms.

2270
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:17,040
There you go. You can grab it.

2271
01:37:19,670 --> 01:37:21,069
(Nian Bo Heng of Team 1 succeeds in getting a snack with his long arms.)

2272
01:37:21,070 --> 01:37:22,879
- Come on. - Eat it.

2273
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:24,180
Oh, yes.

2274
01:37:24,610 --> 01:37:27,680
(Nian Bo Heng succeeds in eating 1 snack.)

2275
01:37:27,850 --> 01:37:30,120
- This won't work. - Please, Dong Hyun.

2276
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:31,980
That won't work, Dong Hyun.

2277
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:33,789
- Put your face closer. - Grab it and get close.

2278
01:37:33,790 --> 01:37:34,819
Put your face close to it.

2279
01:37:34,820 --> 01:37:36,560
Dong Hyun, you can stand up.

2280
01:37:36,820 --> 01:37:38,460
(There isn't much time left.)

2281
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:41,040
(Kim Dong Hyun B finally grabs a piece of rice cake.)

2282
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:45,100
Get the perfect shot for the show.

2283
01:37:45,101 --> 01:37:47,030
(His amazing throwing skill)

2284
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:51,240
Go for two.

2285
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:52,870
- What? - Go for two.

2286
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:54,469
- The score is 1 to 1. - Our scores tied.

2287
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:55,510
Well done.

2288
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:57,679
Start.

2289
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:59,380
- Let's go. - You can do it, Woo Jin.

2290
01:37:59,850 --> 01:38:02,010
- It's completely... - This isn't easy.

2291
01:38:02,450 --> 01:38:04,549
Hey.

2292
01:38:04,550 --> 01:38:05,550
No.

2293
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,419
(Moving delicately like he's playing an instrument)

2294
01:38:08,420 --> 01:38:09,689
No.

2295
01:38:09,690 --> 01:38:10,690
(Slurping)

2296
01:38:10,990 --> 01:38:12,490
(Chen Bo Wen eats 1.)

2297
01:38:12,930 --> 01:38:14,689
(Final score, Chen Bo Wen 1:0 Kang Woo Jin)

2298
01:38:14,690 --> 01:38:16,060
(Chen Bo Wen from Team 1 wins.)

2299
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:18,330
(Team 1 will perform "Plot Twist" 1st.)

2300
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:25,470
(Team 1, Lee Leo versus Team 2, Bang Jun Hyuk)

2301
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:27,540
(Lee Leo starts the game.)

2302
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:34,110
(Slowly)

2303
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:41,850
(Hold your laughter challenge suddenly starts.)

2304
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:44,019
(I won't look.)

2305
01:38:44,020 --> 01:38:45,220
Eat.

2306
01:38:45,860 --> 01:38:47,090
Eat.

2307
01:38:49,430 --> 01:38:50,499
Time is up.

2308
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:52,770
(Lee Leo, 0)

2309
01:38:52,970 --> 01:38:54,400
I bet Jun Hyuk is good at it.

2310
01:38:54,730 --> 01:38:55,930
I bet he's good.

2311
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:57,400
Start.

2312
01:38:58,570 --> 01:39:00,940
(Grabbing without hesitation)

2313
01:39:03,740 --> 01:39:05,540
(He clears 1 within 10 seconds.)

2314
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:08,620
(Surpassing Lee Leo's record, Bang Jun Hyuk's victory is secured.)

2315
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:11,619
(However, he continues the challenge.)

2316
01:39:11,620 --> 01:39:15,150
(Fascinated)

2317
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:18,790
(Bang Jun Hyuk clears 2.)

2318
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:20,260
Time is up.

2319
01:39:20,790 --> 01:39:21,889
(Final score, Lee Leo 0:2 Bang Jun Hyuk)

2320
01:39:21,890 --> 01:39:23,800
(Bang Jun Hyuk from Team 2 wins.)

2321
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:25,760
(Team 1 will perform "Whiplash" 1st.)

2322
01:39:26,430 --> 01:39:28,200
It's savoury and nicely crunchy.

2323
01:39:29,470 --> 01:39:32,339
(Team 1, Xue Su Ren versus Team 2, Guo Zhen)

2324
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:33,509
- Are you ready? - Yes.

2325
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:35,270
(- Are you ready? - Of course.)

2326
01:39:35,610 --> 01:39:36,779
- You can do it. - Let's go.

2327
01:39:36,780 --> 01:39:37,780
Good luck.

2328
01:39:37,781 --> 01:39:38,940
Guo Zhen looks confident.

2329
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:40,550
He does.

2330
01:39:41,950 --> 01:39:43,019
You can do it.

2331
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:44,500
(He can even make the snack nervous.)

2332
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:47,090
He's just as competitive.

2333
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:49,760
(I'll eat you all.)

2334
01:39:50,890 --> 01:39:52,829
(Who will be the winner to determine who performs first?)

2335
01:39:52,830 --> 01:39:54,189
- Start. - You can do it.

2336
01:39:54,190 --> 01:39:55,329
Good luck.

2337
01:39:55,330 --> 01:39:56,429
Take your time.

2338
01:39:56,430 --> 01:39:57,706
(Guo Zhen succeeds as soon as he starts.)

2339
01:39:57,730 --> 01:39:58,730
Okay.

2340
01:40:00,670 --> 01:40:02,369
They're really good.

2341
01:40:02,370 --> 01:40:04,270
(A neck-and-neck competition)

2342
01:40:04,670 --> 01:40:05,839
(The audience's heart is in their mouth.)

2343
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,110
Is it delicious?

2344
01:40:07,210 --> 01:40:08,309
(When Xue Su Ren eats a piece...)

2345
01:40:08,310 --> 01:40:09,410
Six.

2346
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:10,579
Seven.

2347
01:40:10,580 --> 01:40:12,140
(Guo Zhen also eats.)

2348
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:13,980
How is he so good?

2349
01:40:14,410 --> 01:40:16,850
- You don't need to look relaxed. - Eight.

2350
01:40:16,950 --> 01:40:18,149
There's no time for that.

2351
01:40:18,150 --> 01:40:20,326
(While Xue Su Ren takes his time, Guo Zhen eats 1 more.)

2352
01:40:20,350 --> 01:40:21,990
(Please win, Su Ren.)

2353
01:40:22,390 --> 01:40:23,620
Fourteen.

2354
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:25,319
He's winning.

2355
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:26,329
(As they eat 1 more simultaneously, the game ends.)

2356
01:40:26,330 --> 01:40:27,659
- H... - And so...

2357
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:29,459
- He ate 13. - He ate 13?

2358
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:31,500
You must be very hungry.

2359
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:32,560
Yes.

2360
01:40:33,170 --> 01:40:37,839
(Who is the winner of the neck-and-neck match?)

2361
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:41,309
Xue Su Ren 13, Guo Zhen 15. Guo Zhen wins.

2362
01:40:41,310 --> 01:40:43,179
(Guo Zhen from Team 2 is the winner.)

2363
01:40:43,180 --> 01:40:45,110
Guo Zhen!

2364
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:48,410
It's the best tteokbokki I ever had in Korea.

2365
01:40:50,150 --> 01:40:51,950
(Team 2 will perform "KILL THE ROMEO" 1st.)

2366
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:55,550
It's delicious.

2367
01:40:55,551 --> 01:40:56,589
(Congratulating himself for handling spiciness)

2368
01:40:56,590 --> 01:40:59,430
(Team 1, Kim Si Hwan versus Team 2, Chen Kai Wen)

2369
01:40:59,530 --> 01:41:01,159
- Oh, my. - Start.

2370
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:02,289
- Go. - Come on.

2371
01:41:02,290 --> 01:41:03,460
He'll be able to grab it.

2372
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:05,929
- He got it. - That's it.

2373
01:41:05,930 --> 01:41:07,130
Go.

2374
01:41:07,330 --> 01:41:08,600
It's okay.

2375
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:11,569
It's so much fun. What's going on here?

2376
01:41:11,570 --> 01:41:12,599
You can do it.

2377
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:13,639
(Chen Kai Wen grabs it successfully with the chopsticks.)

2378
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:15,120
(Will it go directly into his mouth?)

2379
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:17,910
(Chen Kai Wen eats 1.)

2380
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:19,980
(However, Team 1 keeps failing.)

2381
01:41:20,180 --> 01:41:21,309
What are you doing, Si Hwan?

2382
01:41:21,310 --> 01:41:23,180
Why are you so bad at using chopsticks?

2383
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:25,249
(Meanwhile, Chen Kai Wen eats 1 more.)

2384
01:41:25,250 --> 01:41:28,049
- He ate two. - Put it on the chopsticks instead.

2385
01:41:28,050 --> 01:41:29,790
That's it.

2386
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:35,589
(Will he be able to eat it?)

2387
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:36,600
Please!

2388
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:37,760
(Dropping)

2389
01:41:37,830 --> 01:41:40,329
(Team 1 writhes with disappointment.)

2390
01:41:40,330 --> 01:41:41,699
Why can't I eat it?

2391
01:41:41,700 --> 01:41:42,729
(Resentful)

2392
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:43,899
(The game is over.)

2393
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:45,070
That's so funny.

2394
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,309
Is the game over?

2395
01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:48,469
(Exhausted)

2396
01:41:48,470 --> 01:41:50,239
- It's really delicious. - It's very good.

2397
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:51,840
- Team Two wins. - That's disappointing.

2398
01:41:52,580 --> 01:41:55,179
(Chen Kai Wen from Team 2 wins.)

2399
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:56,320
I will succeed.

2400
01:41:56,950 --> 01:41:57,950
(Team 2 will perform "S-Class" 1st.)

2401
01:41:57,951 --> 01:41:59,719
We're successful.

2402
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:00,720
Did we succeed?

2403
01:42:00,721 --> 01:42:02,266
(Coming up soon, Team 2 will perform "S-Class.")

2404
01:42:02,290 --> 01:42:05,789
I will introduce the first team that's preparing...

2405
01:42:05,790 --> 01:42:08,630
for the 1-on-1 Class Battle.

2406
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:10,759
With seven music videos...

2407
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:13,199
surpassing 200 million views,

2408
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:15,669
this global iconic group is making new history in K-pop.

2409
01:42:15,670 --> 01:42:18,340
We have their song prepared.

2410
01:42:18,370 --> 01:42:21,639
It's "S-Class" by Stray Kids.

2411
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:23,079
("S-Class" by Stray Kids)

2412
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:24,579
It's a match between One Star and All Star.

2413
01:42:24,580 --> 01:42:25,840
This will be fun.

2414
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:27,809
- S-Class - S-Class

2415
01:42:27,810 --> 01:42:29,009
Their class will drop.

2416
01:42:29,010 --> 01:42:30,326
(Everyone is in love with "S-Class" in the waiting room.)

2417
01:42:30,350 --> 01:42:31,979
("S-Class" Team 1 appears in everyone's anticipation.)

2418
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:33,349
("S-Class" Team 2)

2419
01:42:33,350 --> 01:42:34,720
Let's go. It's showtime.

2420
01:42:38,060 --> 01:42:39,060
I can't wait.

2421
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:40,760
(Chen Kai Wen)

2422
01:42:42,330 --> 01:42:44,430
- This team... - They're a team of Avengers.

2423
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:48,199
"S-Class" All Star Team One, please introduce yourself.

2424
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:51,269
We're here to win the hearts of Star Creators.

2425
01:42:51,270 --> 01:42:52,740
(Yoo Kang Min)

2426
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:57,940
- We're All Star Special Forces. - We're All Star Special Forces.

2427
01:42:58,840 --> 01:42:59,960
(Yoo Kang Min, Jo Gye Hyeon)

2428
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:04,320
Next, "S-Class" 1 Star Team 2, please introduce yourself.

2429
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:07,690
Excuse me, girls.

2430
01:43:07,990 --> 01:43:10,160
We're very hungry.

2431
01:43:10,890 --> 01:43:12,660
Can you buy us food?

2432
01:43:13,790 --> 01:43:15,389
I'll buy you food.

2433
01:43:15,390 --> 01:43:17,759
What's on the menu?

2434
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:20,041
- We're Gukbap Special Team. - We're Gukbap Special Team.

2435
01:43:22,230 --> 01:43:23,839
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

2436
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:25,100
(Thank you for the 1st place.)

2437
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:27,670
(Laughing)

2438
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:31,440
The sound of Kany's laughter was fascinating.

2439
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:34,949
(Gukbap? I love it.)

2440
01:43:34,950 --> 01:43:37,149
Aren't you going to repeat it on YouTube?

2441
01:43:37,150 --> 01:43:38,526
(Kany loves "S-Class Team 2's introduction.)

2442
01:43:38,550 --> 01:43:39,819
(What's fun should be done one more time.)

2443
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:42,650
I'm sorry. I'll act professional.

2444
01:43:44,260 --> 01:43:45,900
I hope that Han Wen will sing well today.

2445
01:43:46,330 --> 01:43:49,730
I was shocked by him during the interim check.

2446
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:50,930
Me too.

2447
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:53,699
- Are you feeling well? - Yes.

2448
01:43:53,700 --> 01:43:54,730
Really?

2449
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:56,399
- Min Jae, - Yes?

2450
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:57,899
- isn't it too heavy for you? - What?

2451
01:43:57,900 --> 01:43:59,069
You have so many stickers on you.

2452
01:43:59,070 --> 01:44:01,609
Yes, they're a little heavy.

2453
01:44:01,610 --> 01:44:03,840
You're the leader, and you got the killing part.

2454
01:44:03,940 --> 01:44:05,780
Did you guys vote on it? How did you decide?

2455
01:44:06,550 --> 01:44:09,010
It was a unilateral decision.

2456
01:44:09,210 --> 01:44:11,049
(I see...)

2457
01:44:11,050 --> 01:44:13,050
Does anyone else want to sing the killing part?

2458
01:44:14,790 --> 01:44:16,290
I applied for it.

2459
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:18,519
- There are many others. - There are many.

2460
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:19,660
There are many others.

2461
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:22,060
He has control over his teammates.

2462
01:44:22,130 --> 01:44:24,359
Let's take a look.

2463
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:25,760
Let's take a look at One Star.

2464
01:44:25,830 --> 01:44:27,029
Oh, no.

2465
01:44:27,030 --> 01:44:28,100
I'm so nervous.

2466
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:30,299
(They're quite nervous before the interim check.)

2467
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:31,300
Why do I feel so nervous?

2468
01:44:40,810 --> 01:44:44,280
("S-Class" Team 2 is out of sync from the start.)

2469
01:44:55,890 --> 01:44:56,930
My goodness.

2470
01:45:12,210 --> 01:45:16,150
(They finish the performance out of sync for the interim check.)

2471
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:18,680
There's a clear difference in skills.

2472
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:23,260
In this case, Min Jae should...

2473
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:25,990
keep the killing part.

2474
01:45:26,190 --> 01:45:27,310
- Thank you. - You did well.

2475
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:32,559
Han Wen's position is written...

2476
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:34,099
as a dancer.

2477
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:36,440
Now he's the main vocalist.

2478
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:39,400
Will you be okay?

2479
01:45:39,770 --> 01:45:41,239
I can do it.

2480
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:42,739
- You can do it? - Yes.

2481
01:45:42,740 --> 01:45:44,979
I haven't heard his voice as the main vocalist.

2482
01:45:44,980 --> 01:45:46,039
- Han Wen? - Yes.

2483
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:47,679
- Can you sing with the lyrics? - Yes.

2484
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:48,710
Let's hear it.

2485
01:45:52,750 --> 01:45:55,620
(He sings the main vocalist's part while looking at the lyrics.)

2486
01:45:55,950 --> 01:45:58,920
(Han Wen hums the song, and he's out of tune.)

2487
01:46:03,630 --> 01:46:06,399
You said that you practised for 4 to 5 hours.

2488
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:07,400
That's correct.

2489
01:46:07,401 --> 01:46:09,001
Then why didn't you memorize the melody?

2490
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:11,370
This part is eight seconds.

2491
01:46:12,070 --> 01:46:13,969
If you can't memorize a melody of eight seconds,

2492
01:46:13,970 --> 01:46:15,739
how can you become a singer?

2493
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:18,239
If you give me some time, I'll do it well no matter what.

2494
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:20,980
I won't inconvenience other team members.

2495
01:46:21,350 --> 01:46:23,350
Is there anyone who wants to be the main vocalist?

2496
01:46:25,550 --> 01:46:28,689
(There's silence in the practice room.)

2497
01:46:28,690 --> 01:46:30,459
You want to become singers, don't you?

2498
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:32,790
How can you be so unwilling to sing?

2499
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:36,600
Did I misunderstand?

2500
01:46:37,130 --> 01:46:38,959
Did I not distribute the parts well?

2501
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:41,370
Was my decision too unilateral?

2502
01:46:42,070 --> 01:46:43,099
(Their vocal training time arrives with the rain.)

2503
01:46:43,100 --> 01:46:44,540
"S-Class" participants.

2504
01:46:46,370 --> 01:46:48,070
- Let's start right away. - Okay.

2505
01:47:06,590 --> 01:47:08,110
(Song Min Jae keeps the beat for him.)

2506
01:47:22,010 --> 01:47:24,910
(Hu Han Wen can't sing the main vocalist part at all.)

2507
01:47:26,550 --> 01:47:28,150
How are you going to do this?

2508
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,320
It's not splendid. It's zero points.

2509
01:47:37,790 --> 01:47:40,460
Can we keep trusting you with that?

2510
01:47:41,290 --> 01:47:43,630
Do you think you can do it, Min Jae?

2511
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:44,899
You are the leader.

2512
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:46,130
- Yes. - Right.

2513
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:48,800
No one volunteered...

2514
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,539
- to be the main vocalist. - No one?

2515
01:47:50,540 --> 01:47:52,600
No one. So it was going to be...

2516
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:55,510
either Han Wen or me.

2517
01:47:55,740 --> 01:47:58,480
Da Wit was a vocalist. Can't you take that part?

2518
01:47:59,010 --> 01:48:01,249
I don't think I can do it well.

2519
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:02,479
You don't think you can do it well?

2520
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:03,819
I think we would be similar.

2521
01:48:03,820 --> 01:48:05,060
You think you would be similar?

2522
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:07,160
Do you want to be the main vocalist, Young Jun?

2523
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:08,720
Well...

2524
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:11,919
(No one wants to be the main vocalist.)

2525
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:13,360
What are we going to do?

2526
01:48:14,260 --> 01:48:16,429
This is like teaching "S-Class..."

2527
01:48:16,430 --> 01:48:18,300
to kindergarten children.

2528
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:21,000
It doesn't seem like you want to do well.

2529
01:48:21,170 --> 01:48:23,376
I ask you to take another part, but you say you're not confident.

2530
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:25,070
Your pronunciation is all wrong too.

2531
01:48:25,770 --> 01:48:26,870
What should we do?

2532
01:48:28,510 --> 01:48:30,339
Right now, we're having trouble...

2533
01:48:30,340 --> 01:48:32,880
communicating.

2534
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:34,549
- You're the leader, Min Jae. - Yes.

2535
01:48:34,550 --> 01:48:36,480
- So either reassign the parts... - Yes.

2536
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:38,679
Or do something else...

2537
01:48:38,680 --> 01:48:39,990
with responsibility.

2538
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:41,250
All right.

2539
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:44,720
Sing it.

2540
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:46,630
(He starts training with Hu Han Wen.)

2541
01:48:46,730 --> 01:48:49,130
(He coaches the basic details first.)

2542
01:48:49,230 --> 01:48:50,899
First class

2543
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:52,159
First class

2544
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:54,499
First class, no. First class

2545
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:56,900
(They struggle even with one line.)

2546
01:48:57,170 --> 01:49:01,769
(Trying to keep the beat by clapping)

2547
01:49:01,770 --> 01:49:04,780
(Everything about his vocals feels shaky.)

2548
01:49:07,380 --> 01:49:10,250
Swerving, I'm speeding on serpent road

2549
01:49:13,050 --> 01:49:15,490
Luxurious like I'm an S-class

2550
01:49:15,550 --> 01:49:17,990
Best of the best on first class

2551
01:49:22,690 --> 01:49:26,060
Swerving, I'm speeding on serpent road

2552
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:28,629
Luxurious like I'm an S-class

2553
01:49:28,630 --> 01:49:31,100
Best of the best on first class

2554
01:49:31,670 --> 01:49:34,070
Little bit fast.

2555
01:49:34,210 --> 01:49:35,410
Do I have to switch the parts?

2556
01:49:35,770 --> 01:49:36,880
Should I switch parts?

2557
01:49:37,310 --> 01:49:38,780
Could you sing subvocal one?

2558
01:49:39,580 --> 01:49:42,550
(Song Min Jae asks Yang Da Wit to sing another part.)

2559
01:49:42,580 --> 01:49:43,979
I can't get that part.

2560
01:49:43,980 --> 01:49:45,219
Try this part.

2561
01:49:45,220 --> 01:49:46,460
(It's Kim Young Jun this time.)

2562
01:49:46,820 --> 01:49:50,320
(Hu Han Wen watches Leader Song Min Jae.)

2563
01:49:50,490 --> 01:49:51,689
I think I can do it.

2564
01:49:51,690 --> 01:49:54,060
If I'm given some time to practice,

2565
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:57,860
I can sing the main vocal part.

2566
01:49:58,230 --> 01:50:00,699
I need some time to be good at the main vocal part.

2567
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:03,600
I can do well if you trust me.

2568
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:07,910
If I don't do well even after I practice, switch me then.

2569
01:50:08,110 --> 01:50:10,810
(Hu Han Wen gets some time to practice alone.)

2570
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:13,650
Let's go and eat.

2571
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:15,209
- Aren't you going to eat? - Yes.

2572
01:50:15,210 --> 01:50:16,210
Okay.

2573
01:50:18,250 --> 01:50:22,020
(Hu Han Wen skips lunch and practices.)

2574
01:50:22,190 --> 01:50:24,460
Best of the best on first class

2575
01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:26,729
(Clapping)

2576
01:50:26,730 --> 01:50:28,230
Best of the best on

2577
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:31,500
Best of the best on first class

2578
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:36,500
(Hu Han Wen repeatedly practices.)

2579
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:40,470
(Lunchtime quickly ended.)

2580
01:50:44,280 --> 01:50:45,340
Shall we do it?

2581
01:50:46,510 --> 01:50:50,780
(Will Hu Han Wen keep the main vocal spot?)

2582
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:54,989
Luxurious like I'm an S-class

2583
01:50:54,990 --> 01:50:57,460
Best of the best on first class

2584
01:50:58,020 --> 01:50:59,220
Okay.

2585
01:50:59,590 --> 01:51:01,490
- Is it okay? - Okay.

2586
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:03,600
I made up my mind.

2587
01:51:04,260 --> 01:51:06,729
What I was most worried about...

2588
01:51:06,730 --> 01:51:08,000
was the main vocal part.

2589
01:51:09,170 --> 01:51:10,640
For now, I don't think...

2590
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:13,809
we'll change the main vocalist.

2591
01:51:13,810 --> 01:51:14,840
Right.

2592
01:51:15,910 --> 01:51:19,179
(Hu Han Wen thanks Song Min Jae for believing in him.)

2593
01:51:19,180 --> 01:51:21,880
- Good luck. - You have to practice a lot.

2594
01:51:22,110 --> 01:51:23,550
Why are you crying?

2595
01:51:23,620 --> 01:51:25,119
(He sheds tears of relief.)

2596
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:26,380
You shouldn't cry now.

2597
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:27,919
No.

2598
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:29,820
- Keep it in. - Don't cry.

2599
01:51:30,290 --> 01:51:32,760
I thought I could trust him with the part.

2600
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:35,590
I will keep the main vocalist part.

2601
01:51:35,660 --> 01:51:38,030
I will show my charm on stage...

2602
01:51:38,130 --> 01:51:40,970
and steal the hearts of the Masters.

2603
01:51:43,130 --> 01:51:44,139
(1-on-1 Class Battle Rehearsal)

2604
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:45,270
Standby!

2605
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:47,740
Give us the music.

2606
01:51:47,970 --> 01:51:51,780
("S-Class" Team 2 is rehearsing.)

2607
01:51:55,510 --> 01:51:56,680
Min Jae.

2608
01:51:57,250 --> 01:51:58,280
Hey.

2609
01:52:01,290 --> 01:52:02,590
He improved.

2610
01:52:03,190 --> 01:52:05,060
(The main vocalist part starts.)

2611
01:52:06,690 --> 01:52:07,730
Who is that?

2612
01:52:15,700 --> 01:52:17,300
He practised a lot.

2613
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:20,270
("S-Class" Team 2's rehearsal ends.)

2614
01:52:20,740 --> 01:52:23,210
Zhao Guang Xu and Chen Kai Wen...

2615
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:25,440
have improved a lot.

2616
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:27,449
- That's right. - I could see...

2617
01:52:27,450 --> 01:52:29,950
that you practised a lot.

2618
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:31,450
Thank you.

2619
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:33,749
Hyun Seo did better...

2620
01:52:33,750 --> 01:52:35,390
- than last time. - Yes.

2621
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:37,759
But you're still cute.

2622
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:39,860
- He's kind. - You seem too kind.

2623
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:41,760
You're too kind.

2624
01:52:41,830 --> 01:52:43,559
But this song is a very cool song.

2625
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:45,829
So I think you should have a different mindset...

2626
01:52:45,830 --> 01:52:48,069
when you're singing this song.

2627
01:52:48,070 --> 01:52:49,100
"I'm not Hyun Seo."

2628
01:52:49,530 --> 01:52:50,840
- Okay. - Something like that.

2629
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:53,900
Are you going to be all right, Han Wen?

2630
01:52:54,170 --> 01:52:55,570
I can do it.

2631
01:52:57,910 --> 01:53:00,109
The part might need to be changed.

2632
01:53:00,110 --> 01:53:01,649
Did your parts change? It didn't, right?

2633
01:53:01,650 --> 01:53:02,979
- It didn't. - You went with your parts.

2634
01:53:02,980 --> 01:53:04,520
- Yes. - In this case, Min Jae,

2635
01:53:07,490 --> 01:53:09,120
you should have changed the parts.

2636
01:53:09,890 --> 01:53:11,060
- Yes? - Yes.

2637
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:13,860
Han Wen's voice couldn't be heard.

2638
01:53:13,930 --> 01:53:14,960
All right.

2639
01:53:15,690 --> 01:53:17,899
I thought...

2640
01:53:17,900 --> 01:53:19,760
that was the best choice.

2641
01:53:20,130 --> 01:53:22,230
"Should I really have changed the parts?"

2642
01:53:22,700 --> 01:53:24,770
I kept having that thought.

2643
01:53:27,570 --> 01:53:29,310
But I have the determination...

2644
01:53:29,670 --> 01:53:32,680
that I will not show them...

2645
01:53:33,510 --> 01:53:35,380
an embarrassing performance.

2646
01:53:35,880 --> 01:53:37,780
I think we would have to do well.

2647
01:53:42,390 --> 01:53:45,360

01:54:02,510 --> 01:54:03,680

2649

2651
01:54:25,860 --> 01:54:27,799

2652
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:29,170
He has a nice voice.

2653

(Song Min Jae)

2654
01:54:33,910 --> 01:54:35,170
He's really sexy.

2656
01:54:50,990 --> 01:54:53,790
(Hu Han Wen's vocal skills were concerning.)

2657
01:54:56,330 --> 01:54:59,730
(Would he be able to perform without making mistakes?)

2658
01:55:08,270 --> 01:55:09,340
Wait.

2659
01:55:10,410 --> 01:55:11,480
That's trouble.

2660
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:18,350
Goodness.

2661
01:55:18,780 --> 01:55:19,980
Okay, let's go.

2662
01:55:27,330 --> 01:55:28,690
He can't sing.

2670
01:56:54,550 --> 01:56:55,910

Your brother's amazing.

2682

- That's my brother. - He's great.

2683
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:27,920
- Look at Hyun Seo. - Gosh.

2684
01:58:28,240 --> 01:58:29,940

Min Jae's happy that he did well.

2695

Min Jae did really well.

2696
01:58:48,490 --> 01:58:49,789
You see, this is what makes us happy.

2697
01:58:49,790 --> 01:58:51,259
- When we give feedback, - Right.

2698
01:58:51,260 --> 01:58:52,529
And the person reflects it,

2699
01:58:52,530 --> 01:58:54,329
- you feel so happy. - Right.

2700
01:58:54,330 --> 01:58:56,799
Hyun Seo was perfect.

2701
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:58,170
His eyes changed.

2702
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:00,869
And the main vocal.

2703
01:59:00,870 --> 01:59:02,870
- Han Wen? Right. He was... - It was a huge shame.

2704
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:05,139
The same thing happened...

2705
01:59:05,140 --> 01:59:07,079
during the interim check and the lesson.

2706
01:59:07,080 --> 01:59:08,779
He just couldn't get the key right there.

2707
01:59:08,780 --> 01:59:11,450
He ended up missing it again in the actual performance.

2708
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:16,750
("S-Class" Team 2 finishes the performance and comes down.)

2709

You are all really pumped up.

01:59:21,660 --> 01:59:22,830
Good vocal?

2711
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:26,160
Nice.

2712
01:59:29,970 --> 01:59:32,370
I want to tell you and the leader that I am really grateful.

2713
01:59:33,770 --> 01:59:34,870
It's okay. You did well.

2714
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:43,779
We could've done better.

2715
01:59:43,780 --> 01:59:45,619
But I'm proud of my team.

We're here to win.

2722
01:59:54,030 --> 01:59:56,290

(Why is In Hu so distracted?)

2738
02:00:29,130 --> 02:00:30,559
- I'm not confident in rapping. - You want to avoid...

2739
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:33,030
- rapping as much as possible. - Yes.

2740
02:00:33,260 --> 02:00:34,769
But everyone has to rap. Even the third person has to rap.

2741
02:00:34,770 --> 02:00:37,010
- Right. Everyone has to do it. - Everyone has to do it.

I was a little concerned about In Hu.

2745

02:03:01,580 --> 02:03:02,650
"Kim Jun Min."

2802
02:03:03,510 --> 02:03:05,449
Open parenthesis. "My brother is great."

2803
02:03:05,450 --> 02:03:06,649
"My brother is great."

2804
02:03:06,650 --> 02:03:08,050
(From Lee Jeong and Won Jun)

2805
02:03:08,250 --> 02:03:10,690
It's Jun Min again. The reason. "He's why the team exists."

2806
02:03:11,190 --> 02:03:12,819
- It's true. - "It was just perfect for him."

2807
02:03:12,820 --> 02:03:14,060
"It was a perfect performance."

2808
02:03:15,030 --> 02:03:16,130
I was so grateful.

2809
02:03:16,290 --> 02:03:19,730
It felt like my hard work had been approved.

2810
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:22,099
In Hu is the one who performed the worst.

2811
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:23,230
"He was hard to see."

2812
02:03:23,330 --> 02:03:25,000
"His presence was weak during his part."

2813
02:03:25,770 --> 02:03:27,770
He didn't like how In Hu lip-synced his part.

2814
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:31,340
(In Hu's small voice made them think that he was lip-syncing.)

2815
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:32,679
I guess they couldn't hear him.

2816
02:03:32,680 --> 02:03:34,679
- I couldn't hear him either. - Same here.

2817
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:36,080
It was my first time speaking.

2818
02:03:36,850 --> 02:03:37,879
This is going to hurt.

2819
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:39,120
- Read it. - Should I tell you?

2820
02:03:39,480 --> 02:03:41,490
The reason. "I don't know what he did."

2821
02:03:41,590 --> 02:03:44,159
("I don't know what he did.")

2822
02:03:44,160 --> 02:03:45,320
That's harsh.

2823
02:03:45,560 --> 02:03:47,929
- All right. - That one is harsh.

2824
02:03:47,930 --> 02:03:49,789
(Kim In Hu, last. Reason: I don't know what he did.)

2825
02:03:49,790 --> 02:03:51,550
- Don't cry. - You will get shaken mentally.

2826
02:03:52,060 --> 02:03:53,060
The peer review.

2827
02:03:53,060 --> 02:03:54,060
(Kim In Hu, All Star)

2828
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:55,499
Out of 64 people,

2829
02:03:55,500 --> 02:03:56,529
(Last: Kim In Hu)

2830
02:03:56,530 --> 02:03:58,170
about 60 people mentioned me.

2831
02:03:58,600 --> 02:04:00,446
The best one is Jun Min, and the worst one is you, In Hu.

2832
02:04:00,470 --> 02:04:02,340
Same thing here. Best, Jun Min. Worst, In Hu.

2833
02:04:02,540 --> 02:04:03,710
Jun Min and In Hu.

2834
02:04:04,040 --> 02:04:05,340
I was expecting it actually.

2835
02:04:06,110 --> 02:04:08,079
It's true that I'm still clumsy.

2836
02:04:08,080 --> 02:04:09,110
So...

2837
02:04:14,320 --> 02:04:17,190
(After the practice)

2838
02:04:17,720 --> 02:04:20,760
(Frustrated, he visits the planet diary room.)

2839
02:04:24,530 --> 02:04:26,300
All the other team members are good.

2840
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:29,900
But I'm struggling with my part.

2841
02:04:30,270 --> 02:04:32,170
I feel like my team doesn't need me.

2842
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:35,310
I'm not sure. I feel lost.

2843
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:38,140
I feel lost.

2844
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:42,200
Honestly, I don't have the confidence.

2845
02:04:45,150 --> 02:04:46,620
From the start, I've been...

2846
02:04:47,080 --> 02:04:49,390
pressured to be the All Star.

2847
02:04:49,890 --> 02:04:51,690
I can't get more parts.

2848
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:53,760
And that's damaging my confidence.

2849
02:04:54,460 --> 02:04:55,940
I feel like I'm not helping the team.

2850
02:04:56,430 --> 02:04:57,999
(In Hu shares his deepest feelings...)

2851
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:59,129
That's how I feel.

2852
02:04:59,130 --> 02:05:00,699
(with Yoo Kang Min.)

2853
02:05:00,700 --> 02:05:02,430
I didn't think you were thinking that way.

2854
02:05:02,900 --> 02:05:05,970
You got tested like everyone else, and you got the All Star.

2855
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:08,720
You've done nothing wrong in the process of going up.

2856
02:05:08,940 --> 02:05:10,169
You didn't take someone's place...

2857
02:05:10,170 --> 02:05:12,210
or prevent someone from practising.

2858
02:05:12,510 --> 02:05:15,250
So why would you feel pressured? There's no need for that.

2859
02:05:15,610 --> 02:05:17,650
You know you aren't bad.

2860
02:05:18,620 --> 02:05:19,680
You don't know that?

2861
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:21,750
I am not so sure.

2862
02:05:22,120 --> 02:05:23,249
You are good.

2863
02:05:23,250 --> 02:05:24,659
If you focus, you can do much better.

2864
02:05:24,660 --> 02:05:26,589
But you weren't yourself, and you couldn't focus.

2865
02:05:26,590 --> 02:05:28,630
I believe you can do better.

2866
02:05:29,260 --> 02:05:32,200
(Kang Min bluntly comforts In Hu.)

2867
02:05:33,300 --> 02:05:36,470
(After a long night full of thoughts, )

2868
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:39,439
("S-Class" Team 1 gives...)

2869
02:05:39,440 --> 02:05:41,370
(feedback to each other.)

2870
02:05:44,040 --> 02:05:46,479
(In Hu gives his everything to his part.)

2871
02:05:46,480 --> 02:05:48,550
(The team members watch In Hu carefully.)

2872
02:05:53,620 --> 02:05:54,719
His facial expression is good, isn't it?

2873
02:05:54,720 --> 02:05:56,549
- I loved your facial expression. - I loved it.

2874
02:05:56,550 --> 02:05:57,759
- It was the best. - The rap part gesture...

2875
02:05:57,760 --> 02:05:59,119
wasn't articulated enough.

2876
02:05:59,120 --> 02:06:00,619
You ended it too vaguely.

2877
02:06:00,620 --> 02:06:02,089
If you improve on that, it will be much better.

2878
02:06:02,090 --> 02:06:03,129
Yes.

2879
02:06:03,130 --> 02:06:04,930
The boys helped me out, and I was thankful.

2880
02:06:05,260 --> 02:06:06,400
He's handsome.

2881
02:06:06,700 --> 02:06:07,900
You are handsome.

2882
02:06:08,130 --> 02:06:09,229
(The boys shower him with praise to fill him up with confidence.)

2883
02:06:09,230 --> 02:06:10,530
His eyes were much alive.

2884
02:06:11,300 --> 02:06:12,399
(Gosh, you)

2885
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:13,600
Look how shy he is.

2886
02:06:17,370 --> 02:06:18,510
He was so kind.

2887
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:20,440
And that made me regain the confidence.

2888
02:06:20,780 --> 02:06:23,079
The key is low here, you know.

2889
02:06:23,080 --> 02:06:24,850
- Right. - I don't know how to sing it.

2890
02:06:25,420 --> 02:06:27,149
(He asks questions to the experienced boys.)

2891
02:06:27,150 --> 02:06:28,420
You need to do this much.

2892
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:31,920
I kept thinking about how to show myself better.

2893
02:06:32,020 --> 02:06:33,590
You have to be annoyed.

2894
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:36,389
We are not dancers.

2895
02:06:36,390 --> 02:06:38,930
So don't try to impress people through just dancing.

2896
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:41,600
I asked the boys about the gesture.

2897
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:43,429
I plan to practice the rap tone...

2898
02:06:43,430 --> 02:06:45,369
and other things endlessly.

2899
02:06:45,370 --> 02:06:46,539
Your body has to move back.

2900
02:06:46,540 --> 02:06:47,570
- Go. - Go.

2901
02:06:48,640 --> 02:06:50,769
(1 vs 1 Class Battle Rehearsal)

2902
02:06:50,770 --> 02:06:51,809
Standby.

2903
02:06:51,810 --> 02:06:52,840
- Yes. - Yes.

2904
02:06:53,080 --> 02:06:54,279
- Standby. - Let's go, guys.

2905
02:06:54,280 --> 02:06:56,110
Just perform as always.

2906
02:06:56,480 --> 02:06:57,760
I'm not worried about this team.

2907
02:06:58,980 --> 02:07:02,850
("S-Class" Team 1 prepares for the rehearsal seriously.)

2908
02:07:03,320 --> 02:07:04,620
They are All Stars.

2909
02:07:07,620 --> 02:07:10,360
("S-Class" Team 1 master check begins.)

2910
02:07:15,230 --> 02:07:16,300
Come on.

2911
02:07:19,670 --> 02:07:20,670
Yes!

2912
02:07:20,900 --> 02:07:22,539
("S-Class" Team 1's rehearsal...)

2913
02:07:22,540 --> 02:07:24,310
(made the masters go wild.)

2914
02:07:24,710 --> 02:07:26,040
Shining star

2915
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:34,649
- They're good. - Amazing!

2916
02:07:34,650 --> 02:07:36,120
- Thank you! - Thank you!

2917
02:07:38,720 --> 02:07:41,389
(Kani calls out In Hu's name at that moment.)

2918
02:07:41,390 --> 02:07:44,329
In Hu, I'm really proud.

2919
02:07:44,330 --> 02:07:46,299
I'm proud of you.

2920
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:48,099
(The other teammates are also proud of him.)

2921
02:07:48,100 --> 02:07:50,270
(In Hu finally shows a smile of relief.)

2922
02:07:50,470 --> 02:07:51,799
(Clapping)

2923
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:54,740
I was exhilarated when I got that compliment.

2924
02:07:54,840 --> 02:07:56,040
And I was proud.

2925
02:07:56,810 --> 02:07:58,510
Although my part is short,

2926
02:07:58,610 --> 02:08:00,140
I want to give them a good show.

2927
02:08:02,480 --> 02:08:05,280
- And the killing part by Jun Min. - Yes.

2928
02:08:07,890 --> 02:08:10,990
You're amazing.

2929
02:08:11,760 --> 02:08:12,789
Thank you.

2930
02:08:12,790 --> 02:08:14,589
If I were in my house,

2931
02:08:14,590 --> 02:08:16,929
I would vote for you, for real.

2932
02:08:16,930 --> 02:08:20,530
("S-Class" Team 1 finished rehearsing with favourable comments.)

2933
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:25,270
(Can they finish the performance without any mistakes?)

2934
02:08:25,400 --> 02:08:28,210
Kang Min is like a producer. He picked the perfect members.

2935
02:08:28,570 --> 02:08:29,810
They have good teamwork.

2936
02:08:30,010 --> 02:08:31,610
They could make their debut like this.

2937
02:08:32,240 --> 02:08:33,579
Jun Min is way too good.

2938
02:08:33,580 --> 02:08:36,279
I'm really expecting a lot.

2939
02:08:36,280 --> 02:08:38,120
Don't disappoint me, please.

2940
02:08:38,550 --> 02:08:41,590
(Good luck, guys.)

2941
02:08:42,250 --> 02:08:43,450
Look at Jun Min.

2942
02:08:44,190 --> 02:08:45,420
His aura is on another level.

2943
02:08:48,790 --> 02:08:49,860
Let's go!

2944
02:08:52,700 --> 02:08:54,060
That aura!

2945
02:08:54,400 --> 02:08:55,499
I'm so excited.

2946
02:08:55,500 --> 02:08:57,030
I can't handle it. My heart is racing.

2947
02:09:07,740 --> 02:09:08,880
(To be continued shortly)

2948
02:09:12,050 --> 02:09:13,080
Let's go!

2949
02:09:15,890 --> 02:09:17,350
That aura!

2950
02:09:17,550 --> 02:09:18,659
I'm so excited.

2951
02:09:18,660 --> 02:09:20,220
I can't handle it. My heart is racing.

2952
02:09:30,930 --> 02:09:32,170
(Gye Hyeon)

2953
02:09:34,970 --> 02:09:37,440
("S-Class")

2954
02:10:28,890 --> 02:10:29,990
Let's go!

2955
02:10:57,820 --> 02:10:58,890
Si Hwan!

2956
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:55,250
(Jung Hyun Jun, Hao)

2957
02:12:16,670 --> 02:12:17,700
Jun Min is so good!

2958
02:12:42,030 --> 02:12:43,090
What?

2959
02:12:51,030 --> 02:12:52,570
They're just having fun up there.

2960
02:13:01,080 --> 02:13:02,080
(The blazing ENERGY of the boys...)

2961
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:03,080
(striving to become a top K-pop boy group.)

2962
02:13:03,081 --> 02:13:04,556
(You can watch the full version on YouTube and Mnet Plus.)

2963
02:13:04,580 --> 02:13:07,020
(Make some noise!)

2964
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:14,389
- Star! - Star!

2965
02:13:14,390 --> 02:13:16,260
- They did well. - I mean...

2966
02:13:16,360 --> 02:13:19,730
Can I go to the Star Creator's seat? I'll vote.

2967
02:13:19,830 --> 02:13:22,329
You have to watch until the end. Their ending poses.

2968
02:13:22,330 --> 02:13:23,669
(All Star, Park Dong Gyu)

2969
02:13:23,670 --> 02:13:25,169

(All Star and killing part, Kim Jun Min)

2976
02:13:36,510 --> 02:13:39,119
Jun Min looks like a wolf right now.

2977
02:13:39,120 --> 02:13:40,549
He was perfect for this song.

2978
02:13:40,550 --> 02:13:44,860
When Jun Min showed up, only Kany and Hyolin screamed.

2979
02:13:46,060 --> 02:13:48,430
(1 minute ago)

2980
02:13:48,590 --> 02:13:50,560
- Yes! - What?

2981
02:13:50,760 --> 02:13:53,030
(Laughing)

2982
02:13:55,200 --> 02:13:56,899
It's just that he was so good.

2983
02:13:56,900 --> 02:13:58,939
That was a genuine reaction.

2984
02:13:58,940 --> 02:14:01,339
What I loved most about it was that all eight of them stood out.

2985
02:14:01,340 --> 02:14:02,439
That's true.

2986
02:14:02,440 --> 02:14:05,080
Even the member with the shortest part...

2987
02:14:05,180 --> 02:14:08,279
stood out. That's this team's main strength.

2988
02:14:08,280 --> 02:14:11,050
They're called a team because they can make up for...

2989
02:14:11,150 --> 02:14:13,349
and assist the member...

2990
02:14:13,350 --> 02:14:14,749
- who's lacking. - That's right.

2991
02:14:14,750 --> 02:14:16,490
And they showed the perfect example.

2992
02:14:17,150 --> 02:14:18,190
Oh, my gosh.

2993
02:14:18,990 --> 02:14:20,319
It's finally over.

2994
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:22,200
("S-Class" Team 1 comes down after performing.)

2995
02:14:22,260 --> 02:14:23,960
We did it!

2996
02:14:26,330 --> 02:14:28,230
- I didn't make any mistakes, right? - No.

2997
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,229
Finally, it's over.

2998
02:14:31,230 --> 02:14:33,770
(Well done.)

2999
02:14:34,100 --> 02:14:37,210
Both teams have performed "S-Class."

3000
02:14:37,310 --> 02:14:40,839
The two teams will come up to the stage for the vote.

3001
02:14:40,840 --> 02:14:42,710
(Yoo Kang Min)

3002
02:14:43,210 --> 02:14:45,449
("S-Class" Team 1 and Team 2 stand on the stage...)

3003
02:14:45,450 --> 02:14:47,620
(for the on-site voting.)

3004
02:14:48,420 --> 02:14:49,420
(Kai Wen, Hu Han Wen)

3005
02:14:52,690 --> 02:14:57,189
(Things are still hot, even after the performance.)

3006
02:14:57,190 --> 02:14:58,660
We will now begin voting.

3007
02:14:59,130 --> 02:15:01,160
First, the main vocalists of the two teams.

3008
02:15:01,530 --> 02:15:03,329
Jo Gye Hyeon from Team One.

3009
02:15:03,330 --> 02:15:05,099
(Team 1's main vocalist, Jo Gye Hyeon)

3010
02:15:05,100 --> 02:15:07,199
Hu Han Wen from Team Two.

3011
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:09,010
(Team 2's main vocalist, Hu Han Wen)

3012
02:15:09,140 --> 02:15:11,710
Press 1 if you think Team 1 did better,

3013
02:15:12,010 --> 02:15:15,109
and press 2 if you think Team 2 did better.

3014
02:15:15,110 --> 02:15:16,670
(Press the number of the team to vote.)

3015
02:15:18,780 --> 02:15:20,920
The voting is closed.

3016
02:15:22,050 --> 02:15:25,320
Next, the first sub-vocalists of both teams.

3017
02:15:25,860 --> 02:15:27,520
Yoo Kang Min from Team One.

3018
02:15:28,190 --> 02:15:30,129
(Yoo Kang Min)

3019
02:15:30,130 --> 02:15:33,329
Song Min Jae from Team Two. Please step forward.

3020
02:15:33,330 --> 02:15:34,459
(Song Min Jae)

3021
02:15:34,460 --> 02:15:36,230
(Song Min Jae killed it!)

3022
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:38,799
The second sub-vocalists.

3023
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:41,170
Seo Won and Kim Young Jun.

3024
02:15:41,510 --> 02:15:43,339
The third sub-vocalists.

3025
02:15:43,340 --> 02:15:46,110
Zhang Jia Hao and Ko Ming Chieh.

3026
02:15:46,310 --> 02:15:47,609
The main rappers.

3027
02:15:47,610 --> 02:15:49,549
The first sub-rappers.

3028
02:15:49,550 --> 02:15:51,449
The second sub-rappers.

3029
02:15:51,450 --> 02:15:53,120
The third sub-rappers.

3030
02:15:53,220 --> 02:15:55,920
The two teams, thank you for performing...

3031
02:15:56,020 --> 02:15:57,850
"S-Class" by Stray Kids.

3032
02:15:58,790 --> 02:16:00,919
The participants may now move to the waiting room.

3033
02:16:00,920 --> 02:16:03,000
(The position vote for Team 1 and Team 2 has ended.)

3034
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:08,399
(The result of "S-Class" 1-on-1 Class Battle)

3035
02:16:08,400 --> 02:16:09,900
All Stars versus All Stars.

3036
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,540
(Teams 1 and 2 tensely await the result.)

3037
02:16:12,970 --> 02:16:14,200
Is it showing up now?

3038
02:16:14,600 --> 02:16:16,040
I don't want to go home.

3039
02:16:16,810 --> 02:16:19,510
I think we may lose.

3040
02:16:20,840 --> 02:16:22,180
I wanted to win.

3041
02:16:22,910 --> 02:16:26,450
I just can't predict the winner.

3042
02:16:26,920 --> 02:16:28,689
The other team was so good, though.

3043
02:16:28,690 --> 02:16:29,690
Let's believe in ourselves.

3044
02:16:29,691 --> 02:16:31,859
I believe that we did better than them.

3045
02:16:31,860 --> 02:16:33,119
The other team did a great job too.

3046
02:16:33,120 --> 02:16:35,401
I thought that there was a chance we might end up losing.

3047
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:42,870
(The scoreboard for the 1-on-1 Class Battle is revealed.)

3048
02:16:43,130 --> 02:16:44,670
That startled me.

3049
02:16:45,400 --> 02:16:47,640
(Jo Gye Hyeon of Team 1 versus Hu Han Wen of Team 2)

3050
02:16:47,700 --> 02:16:49,810
Let's go, leader. Hu Han Wen!

3051
02:16:50,070 --> 02:16:51,070
- Gosh. - Let's go.

3052
02:16:51,071 --> 02:16:53,271
To be honest, I wasn't happy with my performance today.

3053
02:16:57,150 --> 02:16:59,280
(Main Vocalist Jo Gye Hyeon of Team 1 wins.)

3054
02:16:59,350 --> 02:17:00,920
(Disappointed)

3055
02:17:00,980 --> 02:17:02,419
- It's okay. - Nice try.

3056
02:17:02,420 --> 02:17:03,519
- It's all right. - It's okay.

3057
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:04,690
It was neck and neck.

3058
02:17:05,360 --> 02:17:07,660
I did win.

3059
02:17:08,090 --> 02:17:10,889
But this ambitious side of me...

3060
02:17:10,890 --> 02:17:13,100
wanted to win by a bigger margin.

3061
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:15,529
Gosh, I'm curious about this one.

3062
02:17:15,530 --> 02:17:19,100
(Yoo Kang Min of Team 1 versus Song Min Jae of Team 2)

3063
02:17:19,240 --> 02:17:21,840
(Song Min Jae wins.)

3064
02:17:22,770 --> 02:17:26,740
(Sub-vocalist 1 Song Min Jae of Team 2 wins.)

3065
02:17:27,510 --> 02:17:29,079
Gosh, Min Jae!

3066
02:17:29,080 --> 02:17:30,486
(The 46-point difference is quite huge.)

3067
02:17:30,510 --> 02:17:32,020
Min Jae got a lot of points.

3068
02:17:32,180 --> 02:17:33,850
I'm happy. This is fun.

3069
02:17:35,250 --> 02:17:36,789
(Park Dong Gyu versus Chen Kai Wen)

3070
02:17:36,790 --> 02:17:39,860
(The results for Sub-rapper 1 will be revealed right after.)

3071
02:17:39,920 --> 02:17:41,629
Let's go, Chen Kai Wen.

3072
02:17:41,630 --> 02:17:42,659
If Team Two wins this one again,

3073
02:17:42,660 --> 02:17:44,060
- it will be legendary. - Dong Gyu.

3074
02:17:44,590 --> 02:17:47,700
(What are the results that surprised everyone?)

3075
02:17:48,430 --> 02:17:50,400
(Sub-rapper 1 Chen Kai Wen of Team 2 wins.)

3076
02:17:50,700 --> 02:17:53,870
(Chen Kai Wen's victory surprises everyone.)

3077
02:17:53,970 --> 02:17:56,870
(Spinning in the air out of joy)

3078
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:59,910
Personally, I was really happy...

3079
02:18:00,080 --> 02:18:02,179
that I was able to execute...

3080
02:18:02,180 --> 02:18:04,580
my part of the performance.

3081
02:18:07,220 --> 02:18:08,420
Nice, Chen Kai Wen.

3082
02:18:09,350 --> 02:18:11,510
(Kim Jun Min of Team 1 versus Zhao Guang Xu of Team 2)

3083
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:13,589
- Okay. - How big will Jun Min's victory be?

3084
02:18:13,590 --> 02:18:14,960
Jun Min, give us a break!

3085
02:18:15,390 --> 02:18:16,830
I think Jun Min will get 200 points.

3086
02:18:18,460 --> 02:18:20,059
(Jun Min left a strong impression on the audience...)

3087
02:18:20,060 --> 02:18:22,129
(by nailing his performance on stage.)

3088
02:18:22,130 --> 02:18:24,930
(He had the killing part and was the 2nd sub-rapper.)

3089
02:18:26,040 --> 02:18:27,639
He's going to win for sure. There's no other way.

3090
02:18:27,640 --> 02:18:28,869
- Jun Min. - Is it 150 points?

3091
02:18:28,870 --> 02:18:29,969
(Zhao Guang Xu nervously waits for the results.)

3092
02:18:29,970 --> 02:18:31,709
Is it possible to win 200 points?

3093
02:18:31,710 --> 02:18:32,710
- Two hundred points? - Will he be the first to break it?

3094
02:18:32,711 --> 02:18:35,550
(What are the results for the 2nd sub-rappers?)

3095
02:18:38,150 --> 02:18:40,179
(Sub-rapper 2 Kim Jun Min of Team 1 wins.)

3096
02:18:40,180 --> 02:18:41,649
He has the highest points so far.

3097
02:18:41,650 --> 02:18:43,720
(Jun Min won by a landslide.)

3098
02:18:43,850 --> 02:18:45,959
(Each team has 2 winners so far.)

3099
02:18:45,960 --> 02:18:48,290
- I hope you win, Da Wit. - This is interesting.

3100
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:51,029
- Let's go, In Hu. - Yes.

3101
02:18:51,030 --> 02:18:53,160
First of all, I was disappointed.

3102
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:55,199
I had a very small part.

3103
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:57,720
So I didn't think I did well or was able to showcase my talent.

3104
02:18:58,570 --> 02:19:00,539
(Which participant won over the hearts of the Star Creators...)

3105
02:19:00,540 --> 02:19:02,470
(despite their short part?)

3106
02:19:02,510 --> 02:19:04,469
(Sub-rapper 3 Kim In Hu wins.)

3107
02:19:04,470 --> 02:19:06,410
In Hu.

3108
02:19:06,580 --> 02:19:08,210
I won.

3109
02:19:08,280 --> 02:19:09,879
Honestly, I didn't feel confident.

3110
02:19:09,880 --> 02:19:12,519
But there was a decent gap in the votes.

3111
02:19:12,520 --> 02:19:13,650
I was proud of myself.

3112
02:19:14,250 --> 02:19:15,289
Won.

3113
02:19:15,290 --> 02:19:16,349
(Sub-vocalist 2 Seo Won wins.)

3114
02:19:16,350 --> 02:19:18,690
(Sub-vocalist 3 Zhang Jia Hao wins.)

3115
02:19:18,720 --> 02:19:21,460
(Main Rapper Kim Si Hwan wins.)

3116
02:19:21,690 --> 02:19:23,390
- We won. - We won.

3117
02:19:23,530 --> 02:19:25,900
- Great job, everyone. - Well done.

3118
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:27,900
We lost, but we put up a good fight.

3119
02:19:28,360 --> 02:19:29,730
Six of us lost.

3120
02:19:29,900 --> 02:19:31,130
Only two of us won.

3121
02:19:31,300 --> 02:19:33,900
It was disappointing. And I felt bad for my team.

3122
02:19:34,300 --> 02:19:37,470
In the end, this wasn't what I had in mind.

3123
02:19:37,970 --> 02:19:39,509
"We could've done better."

3124
02:19:39,510 --> 02:19:42,510
I kept thinking that in my head.

3125
02:19:43,150 --> 02:19:45,979
As for the next song, it captures the feelings...

3126
02:19:45,980 --> 02:19:49,220
of the participants who are preparing to perform.

3127
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:52,619
The song portrays...

3128
02:19:52,620 --> 02:19:55,130
the thrill and the excitement young people feel...

3129
02:19:55,430 --> 02:19:57,230
before their first meeting.

3130
02:19:57,690 --> 02:20:01,430
It's "Plot Twist" by TWS.

3131
02:20:01,560 --> 02:20:03,930
("Plot Twist" by TWS)

3132
02:20:04,100 --> 02:20:05,799
(The waiting area for participants)

3133
02:20:05,800 --> 02:20:08,739
(The first meeting is always so hard)

3134
02:20:08,740 --> 02:20:10,939
(You too?)

3135
02:20:10,940 --> 02:20:12,710
(Me too!)

3136
02:20:12,810 --> 02:20:14,279
How cute.

3137
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:16,250
- Gosh, look at him. - He looks handsome.

3138
02:20:16,380 --> 02:20:17,810
("Plot Twist" by TWS)

3139
02:20:20,450 --> 02:20:22,920
I like Sang Hyeon. He's so handsome when he smiles.

3140
02:20:24,990 --> 02:20:26,289
("Plot Twist," Team 1: All Star, Team 2:1 Star)

3141
02:20:26,290 --> 02:20:28,210
("Plot Twist," Team 1: All Star, Team 2:1 Star)

3142
02:20:29,160 --> 02:20:31,829
(The cheering of the Star Creators doesn't seem to stop.)

3143
02:20:31,830 --> 02:20:33,930
Gosh, this one will be a close one.

3144
02:20:33,960 --> 02:20:35,870
- I can't wait. - Are they All Stars?

3145
02:20:35,930 --> 02:20:38,400
All Star Team One, please introduce yourselves.

3146
02:20:39,140 --> 02:20:41,240
- Hello, guys. - Hello, guys.

3147
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:44,840
We're transfer students from Planet High School.

3148
02:20:45,010 --> 02:20:47,310
We're in Class First Meeting.

3149
02:20:47,440 --> 02:20:49,249
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

3150
02:20:49,250 --> 02:20:50,810
I hope we can get along!

3151
02:20:50,910 --> 02:20:52,780
Team Two, please introduce yourselves too.

3152
02:20:53,350 --> 02:20:55,119
We may be...

3153
02:20:55,120 --> 02:20:57,190
- A bit awkward - A bit awkward

3154
02:20:57,250 --> 02:20:58,289
But just as planned...

3155
02:20:58,290 --> 02:21:00,060
- Give me a hug - Give me a hug

3156
02:21:00,160 --> 02:21:01,929
- We're Team As Planned. - We're Team As Planned.

3157
02:21:01,930 --> 02:21:04,506
- We hope you like our performance. - We hope you like our performance.

3158
02:21:04,530 --> 02:21:06,759
(Team 1: First Meeting, Team 2: As Planned)

3159
02:21:06,760 --> 02:21:09,870
Participant Noh Hui Jun of All Star Team 1,

3160
02:21:09,930 --> 02:21:12,139
the name of your team is First Meeting.

3161
02:21:12,140 --> 02:21:15,140
Then how was your first meeting with each other?

3162
02:21:16,540 --> 02:21:18,109
Our first meeting...

3163
02:21:18,110 --> 02:21:20,510
was a tough one if I'm being honest.

3164
02:21:20,580 --> 02:21:23,709
A few participants in Team One didn't suit...

3165
02:21:23,710 --> 02:21:25,050
the image of this song.

3166
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:26,520
Yes, I remember.

3167
02:21:28,220 --> 02:21:29,890
(The day of the interim check)

3168
02:21:29,990 --> 02:21:32,390
- Let's see it. - Okay. Get ready.

3169
02:21:38,230 --> 02:21:40,059
(Team 1 begins smoothly with Hyun Jun in the center.)

3170
02:21:40,060 --> 02:21:41,060
Come on.

3171
02:21:41,061 --> 02:21:42,330
Gosh, Hyun Jun is good.

3172
02:21:44,670 --> 02:21:47,970
(He Xin Long suddenly stops dancing.)

3173
02:21:51,410 --> 02:21:53,250
(He joins them again and tries to keep going.)

3174
02:21:59,080 --> 02:22:03,420
(He Xin Long leaves the formation again.)

3175
02:22:07,060 --> 02:22:08,790
- My gosh. - Oh, no.

3176
02:22:09,060 --> 02:22:13,500
(He Xin Long is unable to get back into the formation.)

3177
02:22:17,800 --> 02:22:21,540
(He's just standing there and watching his team perform.)

3178
02:22:26,440 --> 02:22:28,110
(Team 1's interim check is over.)

3179
02:22:28,440 --> 02:22:30,480
(How will the Masters evaluate?)

3180
02:22:30,580 --> 02:22:33,520
Hey, He Xin Long. What's going on? Did something happen?

3181
02:22:34,280 --> 02:22:35,390
Is something wrong?

3182
02:22:36,390 --> 02:22:38,550
I just forgot the moves.

3183
02:22:39,160 --> 02:22:40,490
I just forgot the moves.

3184
02:22:43,890 --> 02:22:44,959
You forgot...

3185
02:22:44,960 --> 02:22:46,159
(Shocked)

3186
02:22:46,160 --> 02:22:48,360
You left the formation because you forgot the moves?

3187
02:22:49,770 --> 02:22:51,100
Yes. I...

3188
02:22:56,940 --> 02:22:58,269
I've seen people pick and choose which part to sing,

3189
02:22:58,270 --> 02:23:00,840
but I've never seen anyone pick and choose what to perform.

3190
02:23:08,580 --> 02:23:11,249
If you're not going to perform, then get out of here now.

3191
02:23:11,250 --> 02:23:13,320
Why even bother having those star stickers?

3192
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:17,130
(Get out of here now.)

3193
02:23:19,860 --> 02:23:21,759
Don't you feel bad for the people in the One Star Class?

3194
02:23:21,760 --> 02:23:24,000
You've got 3 stickers when they only have 1.

3195
02:23:26,540 --> 02:23:27,840
What are you doing right now?

3196
02:23:28,740 --> 02:23:32,040
Because of you, I couldn't watch their performance.

3197
02:23:32,840 --> 02:23:34,440
So you're going to get in their way?

3198
02:23:42,350 --> 02:23:45,090
(The practice room for "Plot Twist")

3199
02:23:45,290 --> 02:23:48,090
(He Xin Long is sitting down with a long face.)

3200
02:23:51,660 --> 02:23:54,700
I felt so bad for my team.

3201
02:23:58,270 --> 02:24:01,270
All of a sudden, I couldn't remember anything.

3202
02:24:03,240 --> 02:24:04,310
I stopped.

3203
02:24:05,270 --> 02:24:08,180
Other members had to change their formation.

3204
02:24:08,880 --> 02:24:11,779
I thought that I shouldn't be in their way,

3205
02:24:11,780 --> 02:24:12,780
so I stepped out.

3206
02:24:12,781 --> 02:24:15,101
(He Xin Long stepped back not to mess up their movements.)

3207
02:24:16,820 --> 02:24:18,250
(Glancing)

3208
02:24:19,420 --> 02:24:21,159
(Approaching)

3209
02:24:21,160 --> 02:24:22,606
- Xin Long. - We have a lot of time left.

3210
02:24:22,630 --> 02:24:24,036
- Xin Long. - We have a lot of time left.

3211
02:24:24,060 --> 02:24:25,090
It's okay.

3212
02:24:26,960 --> 02:24:29,629
The team that doesn't do well during the interim check...

3213
02:24:29,630 --> 02:24:32,470
usually kills it on stage. You know?

3214
02:24:32,900 --> 02:24:34,940
Let's think of it as sacrificing our interim check.

3215
02:24:35,540 --> 02:24:37,140
Let's do our best to maintain our class.

3216
02:24:37,570 --> 02:24:39,110
- Let's maintain our class. - Yes.

3217
02:24:42,880 --> 02:24:43,910
Don't cry.

3218
02:24:44,050 --> 02:24:45,920
My part lasts three seconds. How can I do it?

3219
02:24:48,150 --> 02:24:50,310
It's embarrassing that my part only has three seconds.

3220
02:24:51,950 --> 02:24:54,390
I was confident before.

3221
02:24:55,290 --> 02:24:57,730
But now, my confidence level is dropping.

3222
02:24:58,800 --> 02:25:00,529
(During the part assignment, )

3223
02:25:00,530 --> 02:25:01,929
(He Xin Long...)

3224
02:25:01,930 --> 02:25:03,476
(and Noh Hui Jun volunteered to be the leader.)

3225
02:25:03,500 --> 02:25:04,906
(Noh Hui Jun was chosen as the leader.)

3226
02:25:04,930 --> 02:25:09,770
(He volunteered for the killing part too.)

3227
02:25:10,110 --> 02:25:14,310
(Jung Hyun Jun was chosen for the killing part.)

3228
02:25:14,580 --> 02:25:16,309
(He also volunteered to be the main rapper...)

3229
02:25:16,310 --> 02:25:18,050
(as his main talent is rap.)

3230
02:25:18,310 --> 02:25:21,280
(But Nian Bo Heng was chosen as the main rapper.)

3231
02:25:21,750 --> 02:25:22,819
(He Xin Long ended up with the smallest part.)

3232
02:25:22,820 --> 02:25:26,619
Everyone wants to take a bigger part.

3233
02:25:26,620 --> 02:25:29,230
But I ended up with the leftover part.

3234
02:25:29,290 --> 02:25:32,430
I don't know what I can show the audience with this.

3235
02:25:34,100 --> 02:25:36,430
I feel impatient.

3236
02:25:38,600 --> 02:25:43,110
(Na Yun Seo came to see He Xin Long in his room.)

3237
02:25:43,340 --> 02:25:45,140
- You didn't go to sleep yet? - No.

3238
02:25:45,270 --> 02:25:46,640
I just wanted to stop by.

3239
02:25:48,110 --> 02:25:49,250
Do you want some snacks?

3240
02:25:49,380 --> 02:25:50,550
Gosh, what is this?

3241
02:25:51,710 --> 02:25:52,919
(He Xin Long gives him the snack behind the closet.)

3242
02:25:52,920 --> 02:25:54,120
You worked hard.

3243
02:25:54,480 --> 02:25:55,800
Can I drop the honorifics to you?

3244
02:25:55,920 --> 02:25:57,590
- Sure. - How old are you?

3245
02:25:57,650 --> 02:25:59,890
I'm considered 16 years old in Korea.

3246
02:26:00,120 --> 02:26:03,060
Gosh, how come you're so good at dancing?

3247
02:26:03,330 --> 02:26:04,360
Gosh, no.

3248
02:26:05,190 --> 02:26:06,760
I was a trainee for a long time.

3249
02:26:07,100 --> 02:26:08,100
How many years?

3250
02:26:08,260 --> 02:26:10,070
Five years in total.

3251
02:26:10,330 --> 02:26:11,370
Five years?

3252
02:26:12,270 --> 02:26:13,510
You and I are in the same boat.

3253
02:26:13,940 --> 02:26:16,709
I made my debut when I was 12.

3254
02:26:16,710 --> 02:26:17,910
Gosh, when you were 12?

3255
02:26:18,510 --> 02:26:20,310
I made my debut eight years ago.

3256
02:26:20,710 --> 02:26:23,310
But I still get nervous.

3257
02:26:24,310 --> 02:26:25,620
Today was...

3258
02:26:25,820 --> 02:26:26,880
It was tough, wasn't it?

3259
02:26:27,550 --> 02:26:29,150
You will do well.

3260
02:26:29,950 --> 02:26:31,120
You're talented.

3261
02:26:32,390 --> 02:26:33,819
He came to my room,

3262
02:26:33,820 --> 02:26:36,529
and he told me his inner thoughts.

3263
02:26:36,530 --> 02:26:38,060
I was really thankful.

3264
02:26:40,960 --> 02:26:42,329
(The next day, they start out by practising as usual.)

3265
02:26:42,330 --> 02:26:43,570
(Staring)

3266
02:26:43,930 --> 02:26:45,229
Why are you looking at me?

3267
02:26:45,230 --> 02:26:46,870
(Shy)

3268
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:48,070
It's so much pressure.

3269
02:26:50,540 --> 02:26:53,040
(He Xin Long kept staring at Na Yun Seo.)

3270
02:26:53,710 --> 02:26:56,779
(He soon stands up...)

3271
02:26:56,780 --> 02:26:59,880
(and naturally joins Na Yun Seo.)

3272
02:27:02,790 --> 02:27:04,850
Yun Seo is young,

3273
02:27:05,760 --> 02:27:08,120
but he is so passionate.

3274
02:27:08,220 --> 02:27:09,630
And he has great energy.

3275
02:27:11,830 --> 02:27:13,000
(Tapping)

3276
02:27:13,060 --> 02:27:15,500
Can you teach me the first part once more?

3277
02:27:15,930 --> 02:27:17,469
Feeling, so

3278
02:27:17,470 --> 02:27:18,470
Good

3279
02:27:18,470 --> 02:27:19,470
Like that. Yes.

3280
02:27:20,440 --> 02:27:24,270
(He Xin Long gets his energy back as he practices with Na Yun Seo.)

3281
02:27:24,440 --> 02:27:25,440
One, two.

3282
02:27:25,440 --> 02:27:26,440
You're doing well.

3283
02:27:26,441 --> 02:27:27,880
(Thumbs-up)

3284
02:27:27,980 --> 02:27:29,609
I didn't want Xin Long to feel dejected.

3285
02:27:29,610 --> 02:27:31,530
I think that's why I practised with more energy.

3286
02:27:32,420 --> 02:27:33,420
Let's go!

3287
02:27:38,790 --> 02:27:40,719
It's like you're swimming, you know?

3288
02:27:40,720 --> 02:27:45,159
(Na Yun Seo leads the practice session's mood with energy.)

3289
02:27:45,160 --> 02:27:46,260
Tomorrow

3290
02:27:46,530 --> 02:27:48,970
- Look at him. - Boo.

3291
02:27:51,670 --> 02:27:54,669
(He Xin Long gets his confidence back, )

3292
02:27:54,670 --> 02:27:59,510
(and Na Yun Seo watches him practice.)

3293
02:28:01,210 --> 02:28:03,350
I'm not just saying this. You're really good.

3294
02:28:04,050 --> 02:28:05,050
(High-five)

3295
02:28:05,051 --> 02:28:07,080
Since I have a younger buddy who's watching me,

3296
02:28:07,250 --> 02:28:09,520
I want to regain my confidence...

3297
02:28:09,550 --> 02:28:11,190
and make my way back up again.

3298
02:28:13,220 --> 02:28:17,390
(That night, He Xin Long returns to his room after midnight.)

3299
02:28:17,890 --> 02:28:19,130
Were you hanging out somewhere?

3300
02:28:19,730 --> 02:28:21,460
I wasn't hanging out.

3301
02:28:21,530 --> 02:28:24,100
Yun Seo asked me to help him fall asleep.

3302
02:28:24,500 --> 02:28:25,570
He says he's scared.

3303
02:28:26,070 --> 02:28:27,140
Really?

3304
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:29,269
Xin Long, can you help me fall asleep?

3305
02:28:29,270 --> 02:28:30,646
(Na Yun Seo came to He Xin Long's room 1 hour ago.)

3306
02:28:30,670 --> 02:28:33,210
(Following Yun Seo)

3307
02:28:34,040 --> 02:28:35,750
Are you scared to sleep alone?

3308
02:28:36,350 --> 02:28:37,980
(Nodding)

3309
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:43,020
(He Xin Long stayed by Yun Seo's side until he fell asleep.)

3310
02:28:43,450 --> 02:28:45,890
I was scared to sleep alone when I was little too.

3311
02:28:45,920 --> 02:28:47,660
I...

3312
02:28:48,020 --> 02:28:50,790
I lived away from home since I was pretty young.

3313
02:28:51,230 --> 02:28:52,430
I was really scared by myself.

3314
02:28:53,460 --> 02:28:54,829
I was so sleepy myself,

3315
02:28:54,830 --> 02:28:57,370
but I remembered how scared I was as a kid.

3316
02:29:00,640 --> 02:29:01,839
I've been soaked in the rain before,

3317
02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:03,360
so I should hold the umbrella for him.

3318
02:29:05,540 --> 02:29:08,380
It was really hard for our team,

3319
02:29:09,110 --> 02:29:11,710
but we worked hard until now.

3320
02:29:12,720 --> 02:29:14,320
We'll perform with no regrets,

3321
02:29:15,750 --> 02:29:17,520
and we will win, no matter what.

3322
02:29:24,090 --> 02:29:26,830
("Plot Twist")

3323
02:29:32,940 --> 02:29:34,100
Gosh, they're good.

3324
02:29:55,620 --> 02:29:56,830
Nice, Hui Jun.

3325
02:30:03,630 --> 02:30:05,100
He's so cute.

3326
02:30:15,610 --> 02:30:16,780
(Hui Jun, I'm proud of you.)

3327
02:30:29,830 --> 02:30:30,930
Oh, nice.

3328
02:31:11,470 --> 02:31:12,700
That's so good.

3329
02:31:26,020 --> 02:31:27,050
Yes.

3330
02:31:34,260 --> 02:31:35,490
Oh, nice.

3331
02:32:13,260 --> 02:32:14,760
(Hi!)

3332
02:32:14,900 --> 02:32:16,299
(All Star, Kim Tae Jo)

3333
02:32:16,300 --> 02:32:17,669
(All Star, Hong Zhi Han)

3334
02:32:17,670 --> 02:32:19,129
(All Star, Chen Bo Wen)

3335
02:32:19,130 --> 02:32:20,739
(All Star, Noh Hui Jun)

3336
02:32:20,740 --> 02:32:22,569
(All Star, Nian Bo Heng)

3337
02:32:22,570 --> 02:32:23,839
(All Star, Na Yun Seo)

3338
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:25,879
(All Star, He Xin Long)

3339
02:32:25,880 --> 02:32:28,340
(All Star and killing part, Jung Hyun Jun)

3340
02:32:28,640 --> 02:32:30,109
(The blazing ENERGY of the boys...)

3341
02:32:30,110 --> 02:32:31,549
(striving to become a top K-pop boy group.)

3342
02:32:31,550 --> 02:32:33,456
(You can watch the full version on YouTube and Mnet Plus.)

3343
02:32:33,480 --> 02:32:35,350
- That was neat. - Their vocals were perfect.

3344
02:32:35,750 --> 02:32:36,850
They're good.

3345
02:32:37,050 --> 02:32:39,489
Hyun Jun was so perfect.

3346
02:32:39,490 --> 02:32:40,919
If you think about...

3347
02:32:40,920 --> 02:32:43,089
how He Xin Long was standing on the side during the interim check,

3348
02:32:43,090 --> 02:32:44,529
they've improved so much.

3349
02:32:44,530 --> 02:32:45,630
They did well, though.

3350
02:32:46,630 --> 02:32:48,230
They did such a great job.

3351
02:32:48,560 --> 02:32:49,899
(Added pressure)

3352
02:32:49,900 --> 02:32:52,100
(More added pressure)

3353
02:32:52,940 --> 02:32:55,399
The 1st meeting between 4 members from PLANET K...

3354
02:32:55,400 --> 02:32:57,670
and four members from PLANET C wasn't that easy.

3355
02:32:57,940 --> 02:32:59,639
But we were able to show that our hearts were united as one.

3356
02:32:59,640 --> 02:33:02,779
I think we gave the best performance we could.

3357
02:33:02,780 --> 02:33:04,380
I was so happy.

3358
02:33:05,980 --> 02:33:07,319
Okay, One Star.

3359
02:33:07,320 --> 02:33:09,719
I said this before, but this is the team...

3360
02:33:09,720 --> 02:33:11,096
and the song that might flip the results.

3361
02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:12,489
Gosh, if the benefit is 300,000 points,

3362
02:33:12,490 --> 02:33:15,260
all eight of these guys could go up in class.

3363
02:33:15,390 --> 02:33:16,929
I think Lee Jeong has good leadership skills.

3364
02:33:16,930 --> 02:33:18,650
- I remember... - If you watch them... Yes.

3365
02:33:21,030 --> 02:33:24,870
(During Team 2's practice session)

3366
02:33:28,740 --> 02:33:31,839
It's not like I can go around looking for you every time.

3367
02:33:31,840 --> 02:33:34,810
I think you've missed quite a lot of practice time with the team.

3368
02:33:34,910 --> 02:33:36,990
I think I haven't been able to communicate with you.

3369
02:33:39,050 --> 02:33:40,480
When we were practising together,

3370
02:33:41,580 --> 02:33:42,750
I followed along.

3371
02:33:45,820 --> 02:33:50,930
(What happened to Team 2?)

3372
02:33:55,660 --> 02:33:56,970
(I only have eyes for Li Yu.)

3373
02:34:05,070 --> 02:34:07,309
But seriously, this team's lineup is so strong.

3374
02:34:07,310 --> 02:34:09,380
This is a really strong team too.

3375
02:34:12,050 --> 02:34:13,050
Let's go.

3376
02:34:14,620 --> 02:34:16,790
("Plot Twist")

3377
02:34:16,820 --> 02:34:17,850
(Chung Sang Hyeon)

3378
02:34:18,150 --> 02:34:21,890
(To be continued)

3379
02:34:23,490 --> 02:34:25,290
Star Creators around the world.

3380
02:34:25,490 --> 02:34:27,160
To determine the boys' fate,

3381
02:34:27,500 --> 02:34:31,300
BOYS II PLANET's second global voting is taking place now.

3382
02:34:31,930 --> 02:34:34,440
For the second global voting,

3383
02:34:34,740 --> 02:34:37,110
on Mnet Plus, the official platform,

3384
02:34:37,370 --> 02:34:39,240
you may vote once a day.

3385
02:34:40,310 --> 02:34:42,410
On BOYS II PLANET webpage...

3386
02:34:42,780 --> 02:34:43,879
(Participate in the 2nd Global Voting!)

3387
02:34:43,880 --> 02:34:45,350
Click on BOYS II PLANET Voting.

3388
02:34:46,580 --> 02:34:48,849
Select a total of eight participants.

3389
02:34:48,850 --> 02:34:49,920
(Submit Vote)

3390
02:34:49,990 --> 02:34:52,590
Once you click "Submit Vote" at the bottom,

3391
02:34:52,820 --> 02:34:56,260
you'll receive a voting certificate to confirm that you've voted.

3392
02:34:56,990 --> 02:34:59,600
Fifty percent of the voting result will reflect votes from Korea,

3393
02:34:59,730 --> 02:35:03,030
and the other 50 from the rest of the world.

3394
02:35:03,200 --> 02:35:06,840
The accumulated number of votes will be converted into scores.

3395
02:35:07,100 --> 02:35:09,540
The second global voting on BOYS II PLANET will end...

3396
02:35:09,840 --> 02:35:14,110
on August 8, 2025, at 10am.

3397
02:35:15,980 --> 02:35:18,410
Among the surviving participants,

3398
02:35:18,980 --> 02:35:21,080
the last survivor at the bottom ranking...

3399
02:35:21,280 --> 02:35:24,250
will be determined at 3pm on August 8, 2025...

3400
02:35:24,790 --> 02:35:27,890
through the real-time voting for the last survivor...

3401
02:35:28,320 --> 02:35:31,290
during the live streaming of the First Survivor Announcement.

3402
02:35:31,860 --> 02:35:33,529
Star Creators around the world,

3403
02:35:33,530 --> 02:35:36,329
vote for the boys who will ignite the fire in your heart.

3404
02:35:36,330 --> 02:35:37,929
(Vote for the boys who will ignite the fire in your heart.)

3405
02:35:37,930 --> 02:35:40,040
(The 1-on-1 Class Battle continues.)

3406
02:35:41,070 --> 02:35:42,270
Who is that?

3407
02:35:42,340 --> 02:35:44,369
(Fancy performances keep people's eyes on the stage.)

3408
02:35:44,370 --> 02:35:45,640
(He does better on the stage.)

3409
02:35:48,980 --> 02:35:50,450
(The last performance is...)

3410
02:35:51,150 --> 02:35:54,220
("Whiplash" Team 1 with the All Star members rehearse.)

3411
02:35:56,190 --> 02:35:58,219
(The main vocalist, Zhou An Xin's voice is shaky.)

3412
02:35:58,220 --> 02:35:59,589
(1st PLUS ALPHA SUPPORT is open.)

3413
02:35:59,590 --> 02:36:00,919
(Check out the details on Mnet Plus, the official platform.)

3414
02:36:00,920 --> 02:36:03,730
(Did you take the stage thinking, "This is just a rehearsal?")

3415
02:36:06,360 --> 02:36:08,299
(This isn't a school festival.)

3416
02:36:08,300 --> 02:36:09,929
(This isn't a talent show!)

3417
02:36:09,930 --> 02:36:11,970
(It didn't feel like All Star.)

3418
02:36:12,840 --> 02:36:13,969
(I'm feeling...)

3419
02:36:13,970 --> 02:36:15,339
(really anxious about this.)

3420
02:36:15,340 --> 02:36:17,340
History

3421
02:36:17,810 --> 02:36:20,170
("Whiplash" Team 1 faces a crisis before taking the stage.)

3422
02:36:20,410 --> 02:36:21,939
(The notes are too high, )

3423
02:36:21,940 --> 02:36:23,549
(so I'm a bit nervous.)

3424
02:36:23,550 --> 02:36:26,880
(The performance begins amidst everyone's expectations.)

3425
02:36:27,220 --> 02:36:28,650
Oh, no.

3426
02:36:29,450 --> 02:36:31,389
(What are they going to do?)

3427
02:36:31,390 --> 02:36:35,660
(The results get announced.)

3428
02:36:35,990 --> 02:36:37,689
(I was nervous.)

3429
02:36:37,690 --> 02:36:39,560
("Whiplash" by aespa, Team 1 versus Team 2)

3430
02:36:39,860 --> 02:36:43,669
(A shocking result shatters everyone's expectations.)

3431
02:36:43,670 --> 02:36:45,329
(A fierce match for the pride of the class!)

3432
02:36:45,330 --> 02:36:46,800
(What will be the result?)
