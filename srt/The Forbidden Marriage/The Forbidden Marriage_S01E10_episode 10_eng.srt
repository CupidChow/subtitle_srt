00:00:35,424 --> 00:00:39,984
 This is a work of fiction. Characters, incidents, settings, titles, and content have no relevance to real life.

2
00:00:41,184 --> 00:00:43,784
I am deeply sorry for what I'm about to say ...

3
00:00:44,994 --> 00:00:48,390
but there is something you must know, Your Highness.

4
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,494

5
00:00:54,494 --> 00:00:59,824
King! W-W-Where is that girl right now?

6
00:00:59,824 --> 00:01:01,374
Grandmother.

7
00:01:01,374 --> 00:01:04,114
That girl called So Rang!

8
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:09,884
How could a swindler like her enter this place with her evil intentions?

9
00:01:09,884 --> 00:01:11,994
What do you mean, swindler?

10
00:01:12,904 --> 00:01:15,104
That cannot be true.

11
00:01:15,104 --> 00:01:19,754
Up until now, that wench has been completely fooling you, my king.

12
00:01:19,754 --> 00:01:22,254
I know that, due to the upcoming queen selection process,

13
00:01:22,254 --> 00:01:25,334
you hold many concerns regarding that girl, since she is close to me.

14
00:01:25,334 --> 00:01:28,804
And what if this grandmother is not wrong?

15
00:01:28,804 --> 00:01:32,184
Will you get rid of her, then?

16
00:01:33,254 --> 00:01:34,834
Choose.

17
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:37,964
If she is to never return to the palace,

18
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:41,734
I will overlook her crime of deceiving the king.

19
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:46,574
However, if she dares crawl back into the palace,

20
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:50,294
I will be sure to behead her.

21
00:01:53,374 --> 00:01:55,294
I heard about everything.

22
00:01:57,094 --> 00:01:59,874
That you don't have any spiritual power.

23
00:02:02,524 --> 00:02:05,494
Was that all a lie, too?

24
00:02:05,494 --> 00:02:09,194
That you could channel the spirit of the dead crown princess?

25
00:02:16,644 --> 00:02:18,304
What did you...

26
00:02:20,694 --> 00:02:23,144
just say?

27
00:02:35,524 --> 00:02:37,634
Was all of that

28
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:42,294
a lie?

29
00:02:45,044 --> 00:02:48,784
Since when and up to what point did you lie, exactly?

30
00:02:50,414 --> 00:02:51,964
Your Majesty...

31
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,714
So Rang,

32
00:02:56,904 --> 00:02:59,764
you cannot return to the palace anymore.

33
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,264
There is nothing else for you to report.

34
00:03:22,444 --> 00:03:23,954
One thing, though.

35
00:03:24,864 --> 00:03:28,464
Escort So Rang like a shadow so she may not be hurt

36
00:03:29,474 --> 00:03:30,824
and continue to protect her.

37
00:03:30,824 --> 00:03:32,684
Yes, Your Majesty.

38
00:03:57,854 --> 00:04:04,304
♫  On this night, when even the moon is asleep  ♫

39
00:04:04,304 --> 00:04:10,894
♫  Where are you going in such a rush?  ♫

40
00:04:12,244 --> 00:04:15,830
♫  Leaving on a long trip  ♫

41
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:19,610
♫  tonight without a word  ♫

42
00:04:19,614 --> 00:04:25,734
♫  Where are you going in such a rush?  ♫

43
00:04:41,294 --> 00:04:45,020
♫  Even if it is a bit foolish  ♫

44
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:55,260
♫  I still can't let you go for even a second  ♫

45
00:04:55,264 --> 00:04:58,724
 Just where did everything go wrong?

46
00:05:00,114 --> 00:05:02,504
 In the very beginning...

47
00:05:02,504 --> 00:05:05,334
 when I first met his majesty?

48
00:05:05,334 --> 00:05:09,734
 When I lied to his majesty about channeling spirits?

49
00:05:09,734 --> 00:05:11,234
 You do have a spirit on you.

50
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:15,564
 Perhaps when I saw his majesty in such a state, and wanted

51
00:05:15,564 --> 00:05:17,194
  to alleviate things just a bit?

52
00:05:17,194 --> 00:05:22,894
 If not... was it when I started swindling to make a living?

53
00:05:24,744 --> 00:05:27,514
 Just where did everything go wrong?

54
00:05:27,514 --> 00:05:32,404
 In the very beginning... when we captured So Rang?

55
00:05:32,404 --> 00:05:36,224
 When I brought So Rang... into his majesty's presence?

56
00:05:37,284 --> 00:05:39,754
 Or perhaps when I started becoming curious...

57
00:05:39,754 --> 00:05:42,744
 about who So Rang is?

58
00:05:42,744 --> 00:05:48,784
 If not... was it when I went to get a glimpse of my bride?

59
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,434
You should get going, too.

60
00:06:09,434 --> 00:06:11,924
I will continue to nurse the old man.

61
00:06:12,944 --> 00:06:14,904
But things are hard for you, too.

62
00:06:14,904 --> 00:06:17,084
You haven't even eaten.

63
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:30,154
I feel very remorseful... for what happened to you as well.

64
00:07:58,024 --> 00:08:01,324
 Born Sul Ro Romance

65
00:08:08,444 --> 00:08:11,224
Deok Hun, do you smell something burning?

66
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:14,734
The burning of a masterpiece*!
   (Sounds like "wood for burning" in Korean)

67
00:08:14,734 --> 00:08:16,594
This is daebak, I say!

68
00:08:16,594 --> 00:08:18,784
Finally, the time has come to fulfill our purpose.

69
00:08:18,784 --> 00:08:21,824
But if we say it's Painter Jeong's new work,

70
00:08:21,824 --> 00:08:23,874
everyone will expect to see lots of skin.

71
00:08:23,874 --> 00:08:26,054
Yet everyone in here is clean and fully clothed.

72
00:08:26,054 --> 00:08:28,474
It is a masterpiece encompassing the deeply rooted grudges and sorrows

73
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,504
of the Born Sul Ro living within the Marriage Ban era.

74
00:08:30,504 --> 00:08:33,204
This time around, let us go with its literary quality.

75
00:08:33,204 --> 00:08:35,544
Literary quality. Very well.

76
00:08:35,544 --> 00:08:37,404
Regardless, this is daebak!

77
00:08:37,404 --> 00:08:39,554
Daebak, indeed.

78
00:08:39,554 --> 00:08:42,914
Painter Jeong, this is daebak!

79
00:08:42,914 --> 00:08:46,584
Aigoo, aigoo. Oh, my.

80
00:08:47,384 --> 00:08:49,384
Have you possibly heard?

81
00:08:49,384 --> 00:08:54,504
If you bite down on a kitchen knife in the lavatory at midnight and stare at your face through the mirror,

82
00:08:54,504 --> 00:08:56,614
you can see the face of your future wife.

83
00:08:56,614 --> 00:08:58,144
So I tried it last night...

84
00:08:58,144 --> 00:09:00,994
And? Did you see something?

85
00:09:01,914 --> 00:09:03,534
Just a moth...

86
00:09:04,394 --> 00:09:06,094
A moth wife is not so bad.

87
00:09:06,094 --> 00:09:08,944
At least, it will come running to me should I turn on the lights.

88
00:09:08,944 --> 00:09:12,334
If you visit the shaman house in the upper village, they say they will hold a wedding for souls.

89
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:14,934
- Should we try that?
 - A ghost bride is not that bad, either.

90
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:17,294
You cannot see her, but she exists.

91
00:09:17,294 --> 00:09:21,614
Aigoo. I wonder if my wife is even born.

92
00:09:21,614 --> 00:09:23,504
- Frustrating. So frustrating.
 - Frustrating, yes.

93
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:26,964
Moth wife? Ghost wife?

94
00:09:27,854 --> 00:09:29,054
What's with him?

95
00:09:29,054 --> 00:09:32,354
Would you still be frustrated even after seeing this?

96
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:33,864
Aigoo, I am busy! So busy!

97
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,024
Just what is this?

98
00:09:36,024 --> 00:09:37,824
What is this?

99
00:09:38,604 --> 00:09:40,014
Let's see...

100
00:09:46,194 --> 00:09:48,324
Look at this!

101
00:09:48,324 --> 00:09:50,814
 Popularity Ranking

102
00:09:50,814 --> 00:09:54,164
 Born Sul Ro Romance

103
00:10:00,754 --> 00:10:02,324
 Born Sul Ro Romance

104
00:10:06,444 --> 00:10:09,034
 Born Sul Ro Romance

105
00:10:09,034 --> 00:10:11,594
Of course, Painter Jeong's new work must definitely be placed higher.

106
00:10:11,594 --> 00:10:14,264
When is the next volume coming out?

107
00:10:17,174 --> 00:10:20,254
Is this what heaven's fun feels like?

108
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:22,344
Look through it quickly.

109
00:10:27,644 --> 00:10:29,994
I can't believe this!... How can he end it here?

110
00:10:29,994 --> 00:10:31,954
Oh, no!

111
00:10:33,494 --> 00:10:36,734
The second volume. Give me the second volume.

112
00:10:37,314 --> 00:10:39,224
If you wait, you can read it for free.

113
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:41,604
I cannot wait any longer. I will happily pay for it!

114
00:10:41,604 --> 00:10:44,714
If you want the second volume, come to Shinwung Temple on the 15th.

115
00:10:44,714 --> 00:10:49,054
Shinwung Temple... You mean the Buddhist temple?

116
00:10:49,054 --> 00:10:52,324
It looks it's a bit difficult for you to get there, right?

117
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:56,994
You think I can't climb rocks at this rate?

118
00:10:57,734 --> 00:11:01,744
I informed the queen dowager about that wench being a swindler and I was able to kick her out of the palace, but ...

119
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:05,864
if a full-blown investigation ensues about this, things will get difficult.

120
00:11:05,864 --> 00:11:11,554
Because among that girl's lies, there is some truth to it.

121
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:15,324
As to why she had hidden her name until now.

122
00:11:15,324 --> 00:11:17,874
With the queen selection process upon us,

123
00:11:18,904 --> 00:11:21,144
we cannot spoil our plans.

124
00:11:21,144 --> 00:11:25,234
We have never kept a woman

125
00:11:25,234 --> 00:11:29,954
who was next to the king alive, not even once.

126
00:11:30,994 --> 00:11:33,854
Old Man, let's take your medicine.

127
00:11:34,634 --> 00:11:37,384
So Rang! Leave me and run away from here!

128
00:11:37,384 --> 00:11:38,844
Hurry!

129
00:11:38,844 --> 00:11:40,414
Old Man.

130
00:11:40,414 --> 00:11:43,294
- How can I leave you behind?
 - Your Highness,

131
00:11:43,294 --> 00:11:46,204
if they chase you to the mountains, head toward the ocean!

132
00:11:46,204 --> 00:11:48,004
Hurry!

133
00:11:48,004 --> 00:11:50,044
Now!

134
00:11:58,514 --> 00:12:00,444
Seriously...

135
00:12:01,214 --> 00:12:03,894
Why is he like that again?

136
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,554
Quickly, make your escape!

137
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:27,054
Quickly!

138
00:14:06,854 --> 00:14:08,674
So Rang.

139
00:17:53,284 --> 00:17:55,274
Are you all right?

140
00:17:58,254 --> 00:18:00,574
What happened?

141
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,444
What is that?

142
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:08,984
- Go check it out.
  - Yes, sir!

143
00:18:10,584 --> 00:18:13,104
There are two people!

144
00:18:16,314 --> 00:18:18,044
What about the woman who was with me?

145
00:18:18,044 --> 00:18:20,534
My daughter is taking care of her.

146
00:18:26,694 --> 00:18:29,934
 There's an extremely slim chance, but...

147
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:32,094
 upon great shock or trauma,

148
00:18:32,094 --> 00:18:36,214
 once paralyzed nerves may come back to life.

149
00:19:57,904 --> 00:20:00,234
What happened?

150
00:20:00,234 --> 00:20:02,014
So Rang.

151
00:20:05,814 --> 00:20:07,984
Did you, by chance...

152
00:20:09,564 --> 00:20:12,124
What were you thinking! Jumping in like that...

153
00:20:12,124 --> 00:20:16,364
You can't even use your arm! What if you had died?

154
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,684
Why would I die?

155
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,154
You...

156
00:20:23,154 --> 00:20:25,774
What happened to your arm?

157
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,734
Your arm... You can move it again?

158
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,224
Sin Won!

159
00:20:35,224 --> 00:20:37,394
My goodness!

160
00:20:37,394 --> 00:20:39,074
It's all right.

161
00:20:39,074 --> 00:20:41,484
- It's going to be all right now.
 - Come on!

162
00:20:43,824 --> 00:20:45,564
Really.

163
00:20:51,954 --> 00:20:56,324
What should I do if His Majesty returns to his previous state?

164
00:21:10,964 --> 00:21:12,734
Your Majesty.

165
00:21:12,734 --> 00:21:15,294
Are you healthy and  is your mind at peace?

166
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,894
I must be.

167
00:21:18,664 --> 00:21:20,534
Without fail.

168
00:21:22,154 --> 00:21:26,904
Whenever they killed those women, that is what they were hoping for.

169
00:21:29,104 --> 00:21:31,884
That I may not be healthy with my mind at peace.

170
00:21:41,874 --> 00:21:46,114
After enduring my crumbling emotions over and over again,

171
00:21:47,434 --> 00:21:50,124
I think I finally know.

172
00:21:52,114 --> 00:21:55,404
Why So Rang had to lie.

173
00:21:57,504 --> 00:22:00,804
 To bring me to my senses back then,

174
00:22:00,804 --> 00:22:04,184
 the very least she had to do was use deceit.

175
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:10,044
 Is it really you, Crown Princess?

176
00:22:10,044 --> 00:22:12,754
 This girl did not start this deceit with bad intention,

177
00:22:12,754 --> 00:22:14,524
 I am very well aware of that.

178
00:22:14,524 --> 00:22:17,664
 You have to let go of me,

179
00:22:18,694 --> 00:22:21,574
 so that I can depart from this world.

180
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:27,054
 If it were not for those words, she would not have been able to move my heart.

181
00:22:29,024 --> 00:22:33,674
 In order to help my fallen self get back on my feet.

182
00:22:34,264 --> 00:22:39,934
 To help my broken self be put back together and live.

183
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:44,314
 I will go beat up that ghost and come back.

184
00:22:44,314 --> 00:22:47,004
 So you may enjoy your meals.

185
00:22:47,004 --> 00:22:49,464
 All of So Rang's actions were imbued

186
00:22:49,464 --> 00:22:52,844
 with affection and concern for my well-being.

187
00:22:52,844 --> 00:22:58,994
It's because I realized that fact, that I have grown to love her.

188
00:23:01,374 --> 00:23:05,774
Your Majesty. A letter has arrived from outside the palace.

189
00:23:27,804 --> 00:23:30,024
Are you awake now?

190
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:38,294
My name is Seong Hwa Yun.

191
00:23:38,294 --> 00:23:40,284
And this is my home.

192
00:23:40,284 --> 00:23:44,494
His Excellency Seong, her father, is the one who rescued us.

193
00:23:45,334 --> 00:23:48,824
Really? Thank you, Miss.

194
00:23:50,374 --> 00:23:54,674
Those who were involved in this incident are currently under the impression that you are now dead.

195
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:55,654
What?

196
00:23:55,654 --> 00:23:58,074
I thought it would be safer to let it be known that way.

197
00:23:58,074 --> 00:23:59,564
So I let it be.

198
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:01,974
I sent a letter regarding this to Aedaldang.

199
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:05,044
So, I'm now a dead person?

200
00:24:05,634 --> 00:24:11,664
If the situation is that dangerous, how about the two of you stay here in our home?

201
00:24:11,664 --> 00:24:15,884
- Pardon?
 - Think about it. No one would ever imagine

202
00:24:15,884 --> 00:24:18,904
that you are staying at my house.

203
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:24,454
Though we are grateful for your offer, we cannot be of such inconvenience to your family.

204
00:24:27,704 --> 00:24:32,344
Not too long ago, something terrible almost happened to me as well.

205
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:42,834
I do not wish such a thing to happen to you, Miss.

206
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,950
- I'm cold. 
 - My goodness.

207
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,660
- When are they coming out?

208
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,964
- What is going on? 
 - The wait is killing me.

209
00:25:18,494 --> 00:25:21,384
Greetings. My name is Wang Bae.

210
00:25:21,384 --> 00:25:22,734
And I am Oh Deok Hun.

211
00:25:22,734 --> 00:25:25,964
I am Painter Jeong, the one who created this work.

212
00:25:30,364 --> 00:25:35,874
Today, we plan to distribute to you all... volume 2 of Born Sul Ro Romance!

213
00:25:35,874 --> 00:25:37,604
Volume 2!

214
00:25:37,604 --> 00:25:40,844
Volume 2, volume 2, volume 2, volume 2!

215
00:25:40,844 --> 00:25:45,184
Volume 2, volume 2, volume 2, volume 2, vol—

216
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:50,094
Wow!

217
00:25:50,094 --> 00:25:53,074
I waited so long for this!

218
00:25:53,074 --> 00:25:54,804
Let me see...

219
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:56,664
But why are you distributing all this for free?

220
00:25:56,664 --> 00:26:01,284
All of us share the same type of pain.

221
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:07,884
I once knew a friend who passed away after a lonely one-sided love.

222
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,100
When it was his time to go he said his greatest regret

223
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,504
was that his love was not fulfilled.

224
00:26:17,294 --> 00:26:20,674
Though all of you wish for a happy ending for the main characters of this story,

225
00:26:20,674 --> 00:26:22,804
it will not be easy during the Marriage Ban Era of Joseon.

226
00:26:22,804 --> 00:26:23,914
What do you mean?

227
00:26:23,914 --> 00:26:26,364
Then, are you saying this story ends without the two lovers being together?

228
00:26:26,364 --> 00:26:28,224
Why are we even reading this, then?

229
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,294
What we must change...

230
00:26:30,294 --> 00:26:33,224
is our future, not the ending of this story!

231
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:37,224
We must convey our sentiments to the government and be rid of this Marriage Ban.

232
00:26:37,224 --> 00:26:41,134
We must go and secure our rights!

233
00:26:42,474 --> 00:26:45,784
I, too... want to be in a relationship!

234
00:26:45,784 --> 00:26:49,444
Me, too! I want to be in love!

235
00:26:49,444 --> 00:26:52,114
I, too, want to be happy!

236
00:26:52,114 --> 00:26:53,974
- Me, too. Me, too.
 - Yes, me, too.

237
00:26:53,974 --> 00:26:55,754
Me, too! Me, too!

238
00:26:55,754 --> 00:26:57,564
Me, too!

239
00:26:57,564 --> 00:27:03,644
United under the name of Born Sul Ro Group, let us communicate our earnest intentions to the government!

240
00:27:03,644 --> 00:27:06,814
- That is right!
 - Yes, that is right!

241
00:27:16,364 --> 00:27:18,724
♫  Not able to take a husband  ♫

242
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:21,584
♫  Not even able to take a wife...  ♫

243
00:27:21,584 --> 00:27:23,744
 It is the seventh year of the Forbidden Marriage Edict.

244
00:27:23,744 --> 00:27:25,594
 Strange writings are covering the walls,

245
00:27:25,594 --> 00:27:28,914
 and children are running about singing a strange folk song.

246
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:34,024
 During the fall, a time of harvesting crops, there was snowfall, and frost developed instead.

247
00:27:34,024 --> 00:27:38,274
- Exhausted from the seven-year ban, your people's...
  - All because of the grudges of the Sul Ro people.

248
00:27:38,274 --> 00:27:40,244
protests are widely spread in this capital city.

249
00:27:40,244 --> 00:27:42,494
For the comfort and stability of your people, please end this Marriage Ban.

250
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,654
Please end the Marriage Ban.

251
00:27:45,654 --> 00:27:48,604
Please lift this restriction!

252
00:27:48,604 --> 00:27:51,734
Please lift this restriction!

253
00:27:51,734 --> 00:27:55,744
Please lift this restriction!

254
00:27:57,084 --> 00:27:59,134
Your Highness.

255
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:06,654
Are these all petitions to end the Marriage Ban?

256
00:28:06,654 --> 00:28:08,644
Yes, Your Highness.

257
00:28:10,214 --> 00:28:13,664
Where is the king right now?

258
00:28:24,974 --> 00:28:26,844
Your Majesty!

259
00:28:27,554 --> 00:28:31,094
Your Majesty, you must not be like this.

260
00:28:32,454 --> 00:28:34,514
Make it worse.

261
00:28:53,054 --> 00:28:57,444
The queen dowager approaches.

262
00:29:01,404 --> 00:29:03,974
Oh, Royal Grandmother!

263
00:29:07,334 --> 00:29:08,744
Aigoo, my king.

264
00:29:08,744 --> 00:29:13,344
My king. Aigoo, how did you become such a blasted loser?

265
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,584
What do you mean, blasted loser...

266
00:29:15,584 --> 00:29:17,744
- Aigoo, aigoo.
 - Let us go.

267
00:29:17,744 --> 00:29:21,114
Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo. Aigoo, what should we do!

268
00:29:21,114 --> 00:29:22,854
Your Highness, it is best to return at a later time...

269
00:29:22,854 --> 00:29:25,904
Some people never change.

270
00:29:25,904 --> 00:29:31,204
To have the king have his head on straight during such critical times

271
00:29:31,204 --> 00:29:33,824
would be of no use to us.

272
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:38,634
All we need to do is proceed with what we had planned instead of worrying about over there.

273
00:29:42,304 --> 00:29:45,544
Why in the world is the king like that?

274
00:29:45,544 --> 00:29:47,664
Is it because I expelled that girl?

275
00:29:47,664 --> 00:29:50,534
Is that something to drive him to want to die like that?

276
00:29:50,534 --> 00:29:55,054
Someone may think that this grandmother is killing her grandson!

277
00:29:56,054 --> 00:29:57,654
That girl...

278
00:29:57,654 --> 00:30:02,334
while she was outside the palace lost her life.

279
00:30:03,544 --> 00:30:06,604
I am talking about the girl named So Rang.

280
00:30:10,604 --> 00:30:15,154
I didn't e-expel her to have her killed...

281
00:30:15,154 --> 00:30:18,874
There were some people who were preying on her life.

282
00:30:18,874 --> 00:30:20,754
As you are well aware,

283
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,450
all the women by the king's side during the last seven years were eventually...

284
00:30:30,844 --> 00:30:35,754
Even this time around, is it the work of those same people?

285
00:30:35,754 --> 00:30:38,484
As it is difficult to kill her within the palace walls,

286
00:30:38,484 --> 00:30:42,904
it seems they were waiting for the opportunity to have her cast out.

287
00:30:42,904 --> 00:30:46,904
 There is something you must know, Your Highness.

288
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,244
Your suspicions were correct, Your Majesty.

289
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:15,494
By manipulating the queen dowager, someone attempted to cast out So Rang from the palace.

290
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:26,874
What do you think was the reason they manipulated the queen dowager?

291
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:34,064
Most probably it was to take control this nation's queen selection process.

292
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:39,934
They repeatedly murdered inside the palace for the last seven years and extended the Marriage Ban.

293
00:31:39,934 --> 00:31:45,734
Even for this queen selection, do you think they will let the royal family choose whom we want?

294
00:31:45,734 --> 00:31:50,344
First, thoroughly investigate those near the queen dowager.

295
00:31:50,344 --> 00:31:55,444
I shall follow your orders. But are you going somewhere?

296
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:01,714
Once a few more things are taken care of,

297
00:32:01,714 --> 00:32:04,404
no longer will there be a need for the kidnapping business.

298
00:32:04,404 --> 00:32:05,444
What?

299
00:32:05,444 --> 00:32:10,634
In the world where marriage was banned, it was a profitable business.

300
00:32:10,634 --> 00:32:15,654
But in the new world, we should look for a new way to make money.

301
00:32:15,654 --> 00:32:21,104
With the Investigation Bureau rummaging about,

302
00:32:21,104 --> 00:32:23,904
better to disband the organization

303
00:32:23,904 --> 00:32:27,694
and leave no corroborative evidence behind.

304
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,944
Once the hunting days are over,

305
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:35,400
will there be a reward?*
 (refers to the expression ""After a rabbit hunt is over, the now-useless hunting dog is boiled and eaten."."

306
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,380
 (Referring to saying "After a rabbit hunt is over, the now-useless hunting dog is boiled and eaten."

307
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:48,534
Why? Are you worried that I would devour my own hunting dog?

308
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:54,134
Rest assured. I will give you a new position.

309
00:32:54,134 --> 00:32:58,054
We will fill the spot for the new member of the royal family.

310
00:32:58,054 --> 00:33:01,234
What is there to worry about?

311
00:33:01,234 --> 00:33:04,154
Just focus on the remaining work.

312
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,394
Is it all right to walk around at night like this?

313
00:33:13,394 --> 00:33:17,664
Apparently, the kidnappers are after ladies from élite families.

314
00:33:17,664 --> 00:33:19,904
Not sure. I heard we're fine.

315
00:33:19,904 --> 00:33:22,904
I know no one from our Women's Association has been kidnapped.

316
00:33:22,904 --> 00:33:24,484
Is that so?

317
00:33:24,484 --> 00:33:26,154
See you tomorrow.

318
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:23,154
Why did you want to see me?

319
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:27,764
I received your letter.

320
00:34:27,764 --> 00:34:31,434
You said So Rang is safe without any injury?

321
00:34:31,434 --> 00:34:34,144
I thought you might be deeply upset.

322
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,034
I'm not upset at all.

323
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,894
Is your hand all right?

324
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,894
That's a relief.

325
00:34:55,894 --> 00:35:00,554
The first thing I did since I could start using my hand was writing to you.

326
00:35:00,554 --> 00:35:03,714
You should've included that in the letter, too, then.

327
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,884
Did I...

328
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,094
hurt you?

329
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,634
No.

330
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:25,064
I turned away without doing my duty to my king.

331
00:35:25,064 --> 00:35:28,884
I'm the one who betrayed you.

332
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,304
So I'm the one who should feel hurt.

333
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,804
Please do not care for someone like me.

334
00:35:37,804 --> 00:35:42,774
The greed I dared hold onto and the promise I could not keep...

335
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,744
I shall never be forgiven for that.

336
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:49,514
You never understand my feelings, even now.

337
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,524
My apologies, Your Majesty.

338
00:35:52,524 --> 00:35:55,284
Come back if you are sorry.

339
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,664
It might have been easy for you

340
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,544
to let go of me, but I do not...

341
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:08,044
find that easy.

342
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,684
Come back to me and be by my side.

343
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,554
Do I...

344
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:51,524
have the right to miss his majesty?

345
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,874
There you were.

346
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:06,604
Miss ...

347
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,640
Miss!

348
00:37:20,264 --> 00:37:23,924
They'd stop your tears.

349
00:37:23,924 --> 00:37:27,604
It's really waking me up!

350
00:37:27,604 --> 00:37:32,284
When it feels like everything's your fault, take a bit of them.

351
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:40,924
It's not that it feels like it's all my fault. It really is all my fault.

352
00:37:40,924 --> 00:37:44,604
Miss. I'm a swindler.

353
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:51,294
When I was swindling around trying to survive, I didn't even feel guilty.

354
00:37:51,294 --> 00:37:53,694
But I ended up

355
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:58,544
hurting someone seriously.

356
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,194
It was even...

357
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,644
someone who really loved me.

358
00:38:07,644 --> 00:38:11,704
That's why I'm being punished right now.

359
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,184
So...

360
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:19,214
I should certainly not be able to see him anymore.

361
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:23,204
But so shamelessly,

362
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,034
I keep wanting to see him.

363
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,574
I don't think you're a bad person.

364
00:38:34,574 --> 00:38:40,974
If you really had bad intensions, you wouldn't cry quietly every night.

365
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:49,874
It's just...all my fault.

366
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:56,400
Is it your fault that you almost died from falling off a cliff?

367
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,624
Is it your fault that you had to hide here because of that?

368
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,484
I think you're putting too much energy into blaming yourself.

369
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,184
Don't blame me. It's the fruit's fault.

370
00:39:14,184 --> 00:39:16,084
Miss, this is...

371
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,384
Where are you going?

372
00:39:21,384 --> 00:39:24,454
I think someone who needs to talk to you is waiting.

373
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,444
What were you doing?

374
00:39:45,444 --> 00:39:47,264
Nothing.

375
00:39:47,264 --> 00:39:52,454
I wanted to hide alone and cry a bit, but I couldn't.

376
00:39:52,454 --> 00:39:57,534
I think...that maiden is on another level.

377
00:39:57,534 --> 00:39:58,704
Not as much as you.

378
00:39:58,704 --> 00:40:00,374
She's a different breed than me.

379
00:40:00,374 --> 00:40:05,484
She's kind of...subtly unique.

380
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,664
Where have you been, by the way?

381
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:17,464
I...met with his majesty.

382
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,234
I see.

383
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,514
Well...

384
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,774
What did he say?

385
00:40:26,774 --> 00:40:29,564
He told me to come back to the palace.

386
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:34,584
Did you say you will?

387
00:40:35,774 --> 00:40:37,384
No.

388
00:40:37,944 --> 00:40:41,004
But it really woke me up.

389
00:40:41,004 --> 00:40:45,054
I didn't even think about what was good for his majesty.

390
00:40:46,164 --> 00:40:51,774
I don't think I understood how you and his majesty felt.

391
00:40:54,844 --> 00:40:56,644
I told you last time.

392
00:40:56,644 --> 00:40:59,674
That we should stop being friends.

393
00:40:59,674 --> 00:41:01,344
But...

394
00:41:04,244 --> 00:41:07,604
I think I could really be friends this time.

395
00:41:07,604 --> 00:41:11,204
Why all of a sudden?

396
00:41:11,204 --> 00:41:15,114
Being by his majesty's side suits you better.

397
00:41:16,064 --> 00:41:22,234
That made me think that I need to take you with me.

398
00:41:22,234 --> 00:41:26,474
To the place where you can smile.

399
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,104
You know.

400
00:41:31,104 --> 00:41:34,024
I can't do that anymore.

401
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:37,150
I think I'd only be satisfied to see you happy.

402
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:39,280
♫   In a story you shouldn't have heard  ♫

403
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,614
That way,

404
00:41:41,614 --> 00:41:44,720
I think I could be happy, too.

405
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,370
♫  when the stories you wanted to hear poured out endlessly  ♫

406
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:48,944
What do you say?

407
00:41:48,944 --> 00:41:51,540
Don't you think I'm a good friend now?

408
00:41:53,684 --> 00:41:55,194
What's the deal?

409
00:41:55,194 --> 00:41:59,020
You stopped being my friend, and now you want to make up.

410
00:42:00,654 --> 00:42:03,620
We're friends again, right?

411
00:42:06,034 --> 00:42:13,904
♫  crumble into pieces in the small gust which carries the warmth I craved  ♫

412
00:42:13,904 --> 00:42:18,140
Try cutting me off again.

413
00:42:19,134 --> 00:42:21,104
I won't take you back then.

414
00:42:21,104 --> 00:42:22,850
Fine.

415
00:42:32,074 --> 00:42:34,194
Thank you, Madam.

416
00:42:34,804 --> 00:42:36,404
I told you, I'm not married!

417
00:42:36,404 --> 00:42:40,184
Marriage is forbidden. Stop calling me a married woman.

418
00:42:40,184 --> 00:42:43,454
Where are the people who used to frequent here?

419
00:42:45,154 --> 00:42:50,444
One of them will drift apart from me.

420
00:42:51,134 --> 00:42:53,844
Because he couldn't have my heart.

421
00:42:55,044 --> 00:42:59,884
And the other one is...

422
00:43:03,734 --> 00:43:07,624
Is true love someone who makes you happy do death,

423
00:43:07,624 --> 00:43:11,034
or is it someone you feel like you'd die without them?

424
00:43:11,034 --> 00:43:12,304
Which one is it?

425
00:43:12,304 --> 00:43:15,654
There are things you only feel when you're detached.

426
00:43:15,654 --> 00:43:18,534
Love is the sense of longing.

427
00:43:19,614 --> 00:43:20,994
I don't know.

428
00:43:20,994 --> 00:43:22,864
Romance novels make it seem so easy.

429
00:43:22,864 --> 00:43:25,154
But why is it so hard in real life?

430
00:43:25,154 --> 00:43:29,944
Does a corner of your heart feel warm toward someone?

431
00:43:30,664 --> 00:43:33,484
Where does your heart lead to?

432
00:44:16,984 --> 00:44:19,544
You are?

433
00:44:19,544 --> 00:44:20,604
Yes.

434
00:44:20,604 --> 00:44:24,164
Apparently, I was chosen as a candidate for the selection.

435
00:44:26,624 --> 00:44:29,954
But I won't be chosen.

436
00:44:29,954 --> 00:44:31,744
I almost got kidnapped once.

437
00:44:31,744 --> 00:44:34,904
So I have a scar on my face.

438
00:44:34,904 --> 00:44:37,364
Also, there's a favorite candidate.

439
00:44:37,364 --> 00:44:41,184
Ye Hyeon Seon, the eldest daughter of the minister of personnel.

440
00:44:41,184 --> 00:44:46,294
Apparently, she is the most likely one to become the queen.

441
00:44:46,294 --> 00:44:48,784
 Is it all right to walk around at night like this?

442
00:44:48,784 --> 00:44:52,264
 Apparently, the kidnappers target ladies from élite families.

443
00:44:52,264 --> 00:44:53,694
 I heard we're fine.

444
00:44:53,694 --> 00:44:56,994
 I know no one from our Women's Association has been kidnapped.

445
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:58,574
 Is that so?

446
00:44:58,574 --> 00:45:00,314
 See you tomorrow.

447
00:45:01,204 --> 00:45:06,974
I think the fact that you almost got kidnapped but were let free, has to do with the Women's Association.

448
00:45:06,974 --> 00:45:08,344
By Women's Association, you mean ...

449
00:45:08,344 --> 00:45:11,754
It's a group started by Lady Seo, the wife of the minister of personnel.

450
00:45:11,754 --> 00:45:15,704
 They train young women who aspire to become the queen.

451
00:45:15,704 --> 00:45:19,694
 But apparently, the kidnappers avoid the women from the Women's Association.

452
00:45:19,694 --> 00:45:21,414
 Isn't that so strange?

453
00:45:21,414 --> 00:45:24,654
 To put it differently, the women who qualify for the selection

454
00:45:24,654 --> 00:45:27,894
 who are not part of the Women's Association are being kidnapped.

455
00:45:27,894 --> 00:45:34,244
And all of that is the effort to make Lady Seo's daughter the queen.

456
00:45:34,244 --> 00:45:39,964
She took my name to do such a thing?

457
00:45:42,044 --> 00:45:48,034
You told me... not to blame myself for something I'm not guilty of.

458
00:45:49,574 --> 00:45:51,384
Sin Won.

459
00:45:51,384 --> 00:45:54,214
I have only been running away all this time.

460
00:45:57,074 --> 00:46:01,714
 Also I even knew they killed my mother,

461
00:46:02,624 --> 00:46:07,344
 and they tried to kill me by any means.

462
00:46:08,674 --> 00:46:13,624
All this time I was busy running away.

463
00:46:13,624 --> 00:46:19,064
But I can't take it anymore.

464
00:46:19,064 --> 00:46:24,094
I am the real Ye Hyeon Seon.

465
00:46:29,214 --> 00:46:32,834
Miss, I need to ask you a favor.

466
00:46:35,494 --> 00:46:39,414
 A fortuneteller of the Physiognomy Division calculated the perfect time for the candidates' arrival.

467
00:46:39,414 --> 00:46:43,484
 October 9, 7-11 a.m. 
 The maidens will enter the palace around 7-11 a.m.

468
00:46:43,484 --> 00:46:45,924
 Tell the maidens from outside of Hanyang

469
00:46:45,924 --> 00:46:49,784
 to come to Hanyang the day before and be prepared.

470
00:46:49,784 --> 00:46:53,684
 One cannot dress extravagantly for the selection.

471
00:46:53,684 --> 00:46:56,594
 One should wear a yellow top and a red skirt,

472
00:46:56,594 --> 00:47:00,234
 but it cannot be made of patterned silk.

473
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:03,634
 One can powder her face, but she cannot wear rouge.

474
00:47:03,634 --> 00:47:06,084
You can't wear that!

475
00:47:06,084 --> 00:47:09,864
 I'll see them as they are.

476
00:47:09,864 --> 00:47:16,614
Throughout the entire selection process, there cannot be a single mistake!

477
00:47:16,614 --> 00:47:19,224
I will carry out your order.

478
00:48:11,834 --> 00:48:14,834
How did she make the cut with that?

479
00:48:17,314 --> 00:48:19,494
Give it to me, Miss.

480
00:48:30,954 --> 00:48:34,244
Was that wench still alive?

481
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:39,964
 Miss, I have a favor to ask you.

482
00:48:39,964 --> 00:48:44,844
 Please take me with you as your servant for the selection.

483
00:48:47,554 --> 00:48:50,704
Wow, you look beautiful.

484
00:48:57,034 --> 00:49:00,634
Did you think I was dead, Hyeon Hui?

485
00:49:02,834 --> 00:49:05,004
Let's go, Miss.

486
00:49:36,414 --> 00:49:40,140
 Cheongyeonru Pavilion

487
00:49:48,754 --> 00:49:53,300
 Cheongyeonru Pavilion

488
00:49:58,384 --> 00:50:04,274
You must be nervous and overwhelmed for coming here.

489
00:50:04,274 --> 00:50:08,364
But I think knowing how to stay calm at the moment like this

490
00:50:08,364 --> 00:50:13,184
is a true characteristic of a queen.

491
00:50:13,184 --> 00:50:18,340
 Butterflies that visit flowers

492
00:50:19,374 --> 00:50:24,594
 I'll judge your level of patience from the way you add stitches.

493
00:50:24,594 --> 00:50:29,154
 After you finish, I'll be able to judge each woman's character

494
00:50:29,154 --> 00:50:32,884
 based on the insight and skills behind the work.

495
00:50:44,704 --> 00:50:47,434
Hwa Yun of the Seong family. Answer me.

496
00:50:47,434 --> 00:50:52,644
What made you think you could enter the selection with a scarred face?

497
00:50:53,914 --> 00:50:55,544
To be honest,

498
00:50:55,544 --> 00:50:58,834
I almost got kidnapped about a month ago.

499
00:51:01,604 --> 00:51:04,734
Does it mean that something bad could've happened?

500
00:51:04,734 --> 00:51:07,314
Your family must have managed you poorly.

501
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,334
Thankfully, my father is skilled in martial arts.

502
00:51:09,334 --> 00:51:11,234
So he defeated them right away.

503
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:15,454
We select the best maiden of Joseon here and now.

504
00:51:15,454 --> 00:51:19,664
Even a small flaw cannot be tolerated.

505
00:51:20,754 --> 00:51:22,924
Hyeon Seon of the Ye family. Answer me.

506
00:51:22,924 --> 00:51:24,544
What do you think?

507
00:51:24,544 --> 00:51:27,284
Pardon me for speaking,

508
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:29,254
but if you collected enough good karma,

509
00:51:29,254 --> 00:51:31,564
bad things avoid you, as I heard.

510
00:51:31,564 --> 00:51:34,434
Since I was about to see the eldest member of the royal family,

511
00:51:34,434 --> 00:51:38,534
I worried my actions might upset the palace.

512
00:51:38,534 --> 00:51:43,044
So I avoided bad things and didn't listen to evil things.

513
00:51:43,044 --> 00:51:48,074
I thought presenting the cleanest body and mind

514
00:51:48,074 --> 00:51:50,104
is good manners.

515
00:51:50,104 --> 00:51:53,084
However, this might be a competition,

516
00:51:53,084 --> 00:51:56,954
but since she's a fellow woman who was brought here by heaven,

517
00:51:56,954 --> 00:51:58,934
I...

518
00:52:01,614 --> 00:52:06,004
would like to hide her flaw for her.

519
00:52:08,674 --> 00:52:12,404
The scar on the face fades over time,

520
00:52:12,404 --> 00:52:15,634
but the scar on the heart does not fade easily.

521
00:52:15,634 --> 00:52:19,174
Thinking about how I could have been taken to a strange place by the kidnappers,

522
00:52:19,174 --> 00:52:22,834
I still feel dizzy from fear,

523
00:52:24,854 --> 00:52:29,364
but I do not think that was my fault.

524
00:52:29,364 --> 00:52:30,814
What?

525
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:33,954
The kidnappers who were involved should be punished.

526
00:52:33,954 --> 00:52:36,764
The victim is not at fault.

527
00:52:36,764 --> 00:52:41,604
So my heart has not been flawed.

528
00:52:43,114 --> 00:52:48,744
If so, what did you think this was about before you came?

529
00:52:48,744 --> 00:52:51,964
It's easy to find flaws in one's appearance,

530
00:52:51,964 --> 00:52:54,974
but it's difficult to find flaws in one's character.

531
00:52:54,974 --> 00:53:01,264
I think that's why the country selects the queen in three rounds.

532
00:53:16,924 --> 00:53:21,774
 All the palace workers who participate in the selection are on our side,

533
00:53:21,774 --> 00:53:26,874
 but to be very cautious, we need another option just in case.

534
00:53:30,914 --> 00:53:32,964
Thank you for your hard work.

535
00:53:32,964 --> 00:53:35,414
I thought you might get tired from working all day.

536
00:53:35,414 --> 00:53:38,554
So I prepared some sweets.

537
00:53:44,074 --> 00:53:46,494
Seeing how thoughtful you are,

538
00:53:46,494 --> 00:53:51,144
makes me think highly of your lady, as well.

539
00:53:51,814 --> 00:53:53,364
Su Hyang!

540
00:53:57,094 --> 00:53:59,414
Could you give me one, too?

541
00:54:01,654 --> 00:54:05,344
Whose servant are you? How dare you behave so carelessly?

542
00:54:05,344 --> 00:54:11,484
Do you not know that the servant's small actions could affect the owner's reputation?

543
00:54:11,484 --> 00:54:15,304
If this servant bribed you,

544
00:54:15,304 --> 00:54:18,954
you could judge her owner's action based on that, too.

545
00:54:18,954 --> 00:54:22,804
Su Hyang, whose servant are you?

546
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:28,014
I was kidding.

547
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:30,974
You can't call some sweets a bribe.

548
00:54:30,974 --> 00:54:32,624
Right?

549
00:54:46,374 --> 00:54:52,104
I'm happy to see that you put so much effort into them.

550
00:54:52,104 --> 00:54:56,224
But I still need to pick the best one.

551
00:55:02,754 --> 00:55:06,724
Anyone would agree that this is the best.

552
00:55:06,724 --> 00:55:09,914
Whose work is this?

553
00:55:11,534 --> 00:55:14,314
Read the name tag.

554
00:55:16,654 --> 00:55:17,744
 Hyeon Seon of the Ye family, Daughter of the Minister of General Affairs

555
00:55:17,744 --> 00:55:20,514
It's the eldest daughter of the Minister of General Affairs,

556
00:55:20,514 --> 00:55:23,284
Hyeon Seon of the Ye family.

557
00:55:27,384 --> 00:55:30,564
 Hyeon Seon of the Ye family, daughter of the Minister of General Affairs

558
00:55:32,964 --> 00:55:35,304
Go ahead and stand up.

559
00:55:37,574 --> 00:55:40,164
I have a lot to learn, yet you picked mine.

560
00:55:40,164 --> 00:55:42,624
It's a great honor.

561
00:55:42,624 --> 00:55:46,314
You're so humble, too.

562
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:51,924
I think something went wrong.

563
00:55:51,924 --> 00:55:57,374
The maidens cannot speak unless they are asked a question.

564
00:56:11,224 --> 00:56:13,554
It would be impolite to see his face.

565
00:56:13,554 --> 00:56:17,304
Everyone, turn your head down.

566
00:56:48,184 --> 00:56:55,140
 Did he forget about the little old me?

567
00:56:55,994 --> 00:57:02,474
 Has he always been this out of reach?

568
00:57:02,474 --> 00:57:08,974
♫  Because I wonder if you know how I feel, because I long for you  ♫

569
00:57:08,974 --> 00:57:16,060
♫  Because I always want to see you  ♫

570
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,074
Pardon?

571
00:57:17,074 --> 00:57:19,534
They swapped their work with yours?

572
00:57:19,534 --> 00:57:22,664
I'm usually not afraid to speak up,

573
00:57:22,664 --> 00:57:25,014
but if I said the best one was mine,

574
00:57:25,014 --> 00:57:27,694
I would've seemed weird in that situation.

575
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:33,454
It seemed like all the court ladies and servants were playing ignorant.

576
00:57:33,454 --> 00:57:37,634
To be honest, I noticed something suspicious, too.

577
00:57:42,574 --> 00:57:45,394
 By the way, is it a white jade again?

578
00:57:45,394 --> 00:57:47,854
She bribed her with that expensive white jade?

579
00:57:47,854 --> 00:57:50,464
Yes, considering the situation,

580
00:57:50,464 --> 00:57:53,894
I think a lot of court ladies accepted it.

581
00:57:54,434 --> 00:57:59,234
Could there be a way to expose corruption?

582
00:58:01,364 --> 00:58:05,474
 Come back to me and be by my side.

583
00:58:30,834 --> 00:58:32,744
Your Majesty.

584
00:59:11,154 --> 00:59:15,810
 Yeong Seon of the Han family...

585
00:59:22,334 --> 00:59:27,434
These are the ones who made it to the second round of selection.

586
00:59:29,334 --> 00:59:33,194
We're working so hard to select the queen.

587
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:37,124
But if His Majesty ignores the queen...

588
00:59:37,854 --> 00:59:42,074
It'd be difficult to produce the heir again.

589
00:59:46,214 --> 00:59:49,324
Grandmother, you came.

590
00:59:49,324 --> 00:59:54,234
You must be busy picking the future granddaughter-in-law.

591
00:59:56,164 --> 01:00:00,984
Your Majesty, there will be a new member in the royal family soon.

592
01:00:00,984 --> 01:00:06,004
You should not be looking like this, should you?

593
01:00:08,664 --> 01:00:14,534
What can I possibly do? It's already a rigged game, anyway.

594
01:00:14,534 --> 01:00:16,814
What do you mean, rigged?

595
01:00:16,814 --> 01:00:21,294
I know you're drunk, but you should not speak that way.

596
01:00:21,294 --> 01:00:25,604
I carefully selected these maidens myself.

597
01:00:25,604 --> 01:00:29,074
Are you doubting me right now?

598
01:00:29,074 --> 01:00:32,604
I'm doubting the ones around you, not you.

599
01:00:32,604 --> 01:00:37,714
Apparently, they changed the ranking in the last selection, too.

600
01:00:37,714 --> 01:00:39,124
Who did that, anyway?

601
01:00:39,124 --> 01:00:43,974
How could you not know that everyone but you have been bribed?

602
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:48,494
There's no way my people would do that.

603
01:00:51,644 --> 01:00:53,484
What if...

604
01:00:54,254 --> 01:00:56,184
I'm not wrong?

605
01:00:56,184 --> 01:00:59,984
Will you punish them?

606
01:00:59,984 --> 01:01:00,954
Your Majesty.

607
01:01:00,954 --> 01:01:05,474
Did you not say there cannot be any scandal in this selection?

608
01:01:05,474 --> 01:01:11,134
I'll be the one to interrogate and I'll do the punishing as well.

609
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:12,684
Because they're my court ladies.

610
01:01:12,684 --> 01:01:14,544
That's right. You should.

611
01:01:14,544 --> 01:01:19,124
If so can I do the same, as well?

612
01:01:19,124 --> 01:01:25,034
I'll interrogate them if they work in my palace, and I'll punish them myself as well.

613
01:01:27,174 --> 01:01:31,054
It's up to me to decide if they should be forgiven and

614
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:33,364
be reinstated, as well.

615
01:01:37,774 --> 01:01:42,024
Is that girl alive?

616
01:01:44,454 --> 01:01:47,834
Investigate all the court ladies' houses.

617
01:01:47,834 --> 01:01:51,964
We need to find out who's behind the corruption of this selection.

618
01:01:51,964 --> 01:01:53,874
I'll carry out your order.

619
01:01:53,874 --> 01:01:55,744
Chief Royal Secretary.

620
01:01:56,874 --> 01:02:00,144
There's someone we need to bring back to the palace.

621
01:02:00,144 --> 01:02:03,154
Court Lady! Court Lady!

622
01:02:03,154 --> 01:02:04,144
Court Lady!

623
01:02:04,144 --> 01:02:06,104
Please don't!

624
01:02:06,104 --> 01:02:08,274
Court Lady! Please don't do this!

625
01:02:08,274 --> 01:02:09,634
Please forgive us!

626
01:02:09,634 --> 01:02:11,254
Please don't do this

627
01:02:11,254 --> 01:02:12,664
Court Lady!

628
01:02:12,664 --> 01:02:14,884
No!

629
01:02:14,884 --> 01:02:17,094
Please have mercy!

630
01:02:17,094 --> 01:02:19,674
Please!

631
01:02:26,484 --> 01:02:28,974
I'm Seol Seon Ho, who was appointed as a new officer

632
01:02:28,974 --> 01:02:31,184
for the royal guards. (  Naegeumwi - responsible for protecting the king and the royal family)

633
01:02:42,764 --> 01:02:46,444
Will you stay quiet even though there's evidence right here?

634
01:02:46,444 --> 01:02:48,904
We do not know anything about it.

635
01:02:48,904 --> 01:02:51,894
Someone snuck in and planted these in our room!

636
01:02:51,894 --> 01:02:55,994
A witness said you wore that jade hairpin when you were off-duty.

637
01:02:55,994 --> 01:02:58,954
Will you still continue to lie?

638
01:02:58,954 --> 01:03:02,454
I see you dare to insult his majesty right now.

639
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,900
Do you need to be tortured to tell the truth?

640
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:07,784
- Get started!
  - Yes, sir!

641
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:10,054
I'll talk!

642
01:03:13,284 --> 01:03:16,814
It's someone who's no longer at the palace.

643
01:03:16,814 --> 01:03:22,834
The jade hairpin was given by Court Lady Won Nyeo!

644
01:03:22,834 --> 01:03:25,504
What did you just say?

645
01:03:26,914 --> 01:03:31,294
How dare you name someone who's not here?

646
01:03:32,134 --> 01:03:36,164
Why did Head Court Lady Won give you the jade hairpins?

647
01:03:36,164 --> 01:03:39,294
She said she had an urgent request later.

648
01:03:39,294 --> 01:03:41,004
That's why she did it.

649
01:03:41,004 --> 01:03:45,124
Do you know Won Nyeo's whereabouts?

650
01:03:46,024 --> 01:03:47,584
Since she left the palace...

651
01:03:47,584 --> 01:03:50,504
Since her name was mentioned,

652
01:03:50,504 --> 01:03:51,864
we need to summon her to investigate.

653
01:03:51,864 --> 01:03:53,144
No way!

654
01:03:53,144 --> 01:03:56,244
Didn't this woman lie to divert the investigation?

655
01:03:56,244 --> 01:04:00,354
That's why we need to prove Court Lady Won's innocence by investigating.

656
01:04:20,404 --> 01:04:22,994
Have you been well?

657
01:04:22,994 --> 01:04:27,164
You should get ready to return to the palace.

658
01:04:28,004 --> 01:04:30,804
Why all of a sudden?

659
01:04:30,804 --> 01:04:35,784
His majesty summoned you back.

660
01:04:50,574 --> 01:04:55,554
♫  On this night, when even the moon is asleep  ♫

661
01:04:57,854 --> 01:05:00,940
 He'll probably punish me.

662
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:03,420
♫   Where are you going in such a rush?  ♫

663
01:05:04,964 --> 01:05:08,630
♫  Leaving on a long trip  ♫

664
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:12,320
♫  tonight without a word  ♫

665
01:05:12,324 --> 01:05:14,454
I need to ask for forgiveness.

666
01:05:14,454 --> 01:05:18,224
It'd be shameless to ask that,

667
01:05:18,224 --> 01:05:19,994
but still...

668
01:05:20,904 --> 01:05:22,714
But still...

669
01:05:34,034 --> 01:05:37,750
♫  Even if it is a bit foolish  ♫

670
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:46,460
♫  I still can't let you go for even a second  ♫

671
01:05:48,524 --> 01:05:51,874
♫  I'm sorry  ♫

672
01:05:51,874 --> 01:05:55,794
♫  It's all my fault  ♫

673
01:05:55,794 --> 01:06:01,654
♫  Come visit me even for a little while.  ♫

674
01:06:07,724 --> 01:06:13,050
♫  How can forget you?  ♫

675
01:06:14,934 --> 01:06:20,450
♫  How can I erase you?  ♫

676
01:06:22,134 --> 01:06:29,554
♫  You torment me in my dreams every night  ♫

677
01:06:29,554 --> 01:06:35,224
♫  How can you tell me to forget you?  ♫

678
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:45,620

679
01:06:47,644 --> 01:06:51,734
♫  Even on a day when the petals flutter  ♫

680
01:06:51,734 --> 01:06:54,724
 The Forbidden Marriage
 Preview

681
01:06:54,724 --> 01:06:55,794
 I missed you.

682
01:06:55,794 --> 01:06:58,644
 I can never lose you again.

683
01:06:58,644 --> 01:07:00,854
 We need to make sure to arrest all of them.

684
01:07:00,854 --> 01:07:02,744
 Is there anything I can do?

685
01:07:02,744 --> 01:07:06,134
 You can save me, can't you, Chief?

686
01:07:06,924 --> 01:07:07,784
 What's this?

687
01:07:07,784 --> 01:07:11,584
 Who put the sap in the teacup?

688
01:07:11,584 --> 01:07:13,894
 Put her in prison immediately!

689
01:07:13,894 --> 01:07:14,804
 Your Highness!

690
01:07:14,804 --> 01:07:17,914
 Do you know that we arrested the leader of the kidnappers?

691
01:07:17,914 --> 01:07:20,604
 How dare you go after me?

692
01:07:20,604 --> 01:07:22,814
 I can't relax even for a day.

693
01:07:22,814 --> 01:07:28,830
 Sometimes, you have to sacrifice yourself to reveal the truth.

694
01:07:31,254 --> 01:07:33,300
♫  Every night...  ♫
