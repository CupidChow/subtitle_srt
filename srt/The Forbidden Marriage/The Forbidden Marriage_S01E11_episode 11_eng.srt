1
00:00:35,274 --> 00:00:40,044
 This is a work of fiction. Characters, incidents, settings, titles, and content have no relevance to real life.

2
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:54,740

3
00:02:06,224 --> 00:02:08,664
I am sorry.

4
00:02:10,224 --> 00:02:12,794
It's all my fault.

5
00:02:15,184 --> 00:02:17,544
I missed you.

6
00:02:19,354 --> 00:02:23,174
I thought you would never forgive me.

7
00:02:26,124 --> 00:02:30,234
Though your words were lies, I know...

8
00:02:31,884 --> 00:02:35,224
your heart was sincere.

9
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:42,834
Do you know just how much I prayed that you would stay alive?

10
00:02:46,804 --> 00:02:50,174
It became clearer to me only after we were apart.

11
00:02:53,074 --> 00:02:55,194
The fact that...

12
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:01,484
I can never lose you.

13
00:03:07,684 --> 00:03:10,124
Thank you for staying alive.

14
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:12,334
For staying alive...

15
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:48,784
What?

16
00:03:48,784 --> 00:03:51,584
It is extremely plausible.

17
00:03:51,584 --> 00:03:56,634
Lady Seong received more attention than others during the early stages of the queen selection process.

18
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,474
Then again, my daughter will...

19
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:05,274
Once the Marriage Ban comes to an end,

20
00:04:05,274 --> 00:04:07,134
the kidnappers will blend in with the people as if nothing has ever happened.

21
00:04:07,134 --> 00:04:09,914
Then, it will become much more difficult to have them pay for their crimes.

22
00:04:09,914 --> 00:04:13,844
For that reason, we must arrest all of them without fail this time.

23
00:04:13,844 --> 00:04:15,894
Is there anything I can do?

24
00:04:15,894 --> 00:04:17,704
Do not get involved, Hwa Yun!

25
00:04:17,704 --> 00:04:21,514
But he says this is the last chance to catch those culprits.

26
00:04:30,644 --> 00:04:32,444
Chief.

27
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:35,824
I am the one those culprits are preying on.

28
00:04:35,824 --> 00:04:39,644
If needed, I am willing to serve as bait to hook them all by the mouth.

29
00:04:39,644 --> 00:04:41,264
We told you not to get involved.

30
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:45,744
Then you can save me, Chief.

31
00:04:46,664 --> 00:04:50,564
You owe our family for saving your life. Remember?

32
00:04:50,564 --> 00:04:52,424
Well...

33
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:51,554
Drag her away.

34
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,734
Whoa...

35
00:06:12,104 --> 00:06:14,684
- Open it.
 - Yes, sir.

36
00:06:34,024 --> 00:06:36,324
Raise your head.

37
00:06:46,344 --> 00:06:49,794
Whom did you expect to see? Why do you look that way?

38
00:06:49,794 --> 00:06:52,174
Damn it!

39
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,204
Drop your weapons!

40
00:07:24,184 --> 00:07:28,604
Gosh, I have to return this to Lady Seong in good condition.

41
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,774
 Episode 11

42
00:07:43,444 --> 00:07:45,384
I-I'm so sorry!

43
00:07:45,384 --> 00:07:46,884
I see...

44
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:50,884
You want to scratch me with that and have me fail the Queen Selection, don't you, wench?

45
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:52,724
There is no way. That is not so!

46
00:07:52,724 --> 00:07:57,814
If it is a maneuver to affect the queen selection, isn't that high treason?

47
00:07:57,814 --> 00:07:58,984
It is not so!

48
00:07:58,984 --> 00:08:03,674
You are more beautiful than the moon goddess today, Lady Hyeon Seon. No...

49
00:08:03,674 --> 00:08:05,914
Your Highness the Queen.

50
00:08:05,914 --> 00:08:08,334
You sure are quick to sweet-talk.

51
00:08:08,814 --> 00:08:11,264
And what happened to that Seong wench?

52
00:08:11,264 --> 00:08:13,054
Why is there no news of her yet?

53
00:08:13,054 --> 00:08:17,604
Since today is an important day, it is hard to meet with them and get a status report.

54
00:08:17,604 --> 00:08:23,514
However, do not worry. Your mother is not one to put all the eggs in one basket.

55
00:08:31,464 --> 00:08:33,474
Lady So Rang!

56
00:08:35,144 --> 00:08:39,544
I have come as your maid, so please speak down to me, My Lady.

57
00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:43,874
All right, So Rang. Let us go.

58
00:08:46,704 --> 00:08:49,224
She's good in talking down to me.

59
00:08:55,354 --> 00:08:59,254
Why is Lady Seong coming from that direction?

60
00:08:59,254 --> 00:09:04,354
My lady entered the palace earlier last night and stayed overnight at one of the palace annexes.

61
00:09:04,354 --> 00:09:07,374
That is not a fair thing to do.

62
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:10,234
Was it not an attempt to adapt to the palace by doing so?

63
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:12,114
I had my reasons.

64
00:09:12,114 --> 00:09:14,154
Someone was preying on my life outside the palace.

65
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,404
Goodness gracious.

66
00:09:16,404 --> 00:09:20,144
This is why they say it is important to practice good virtue all the time.

67
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:22,684
Oh, you are referring to what you said that time.

68
00:09:22,684 --> 00:09:25,784
Pretending to cover up a flaw for a friend during the queen selection.

69
00:09:25,784 --> 00:09:27,794
But instead, you rubbed it in.

70
00:09:27,794 --> 00:09:31,414
It is best for all of you to be careful in front of this lady.

71
00:09:31,414 --> 00:09:34,294
You never know what kind of flaw she will pick on.

72
00:09:35,184 --> 00:09:37,954
It is not wrong to say to be careful.

73
00:09:37,954 --> 00:09:40,344
This is a place of competition.

74
00:09:40,344 --> 00:09:43,744
We must beat one another in order to go on to the next step.

75
00:09:43,744 --> 00:09:46,514
That will happen as long as we are outstanding on our own accord.

76
00:09:46,514 --> 00:09:50,584
Earning points by claiming someone else's work as yours, on the other hand, is considered theft.

77
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:55,804
And to receive the protection of the palace ladies even while doing so, reveals the lowdown of this queen selection.

78
00:10:06,494 --> 00:10:08,544
Let us go, My Lady.

79
00:10:13,104 --> 00:10:15,134
 They are all the same bastards.

80
00:10:15,134 --> 00:10:18,484
 They tried to harm So Rang, and... after plotting the incidents of the fake crown princess...

81
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,984
 they killed the officer of the royal guard.

82
00:10:29,944 --> 00:10:32,254
You said you captured the leader of the kidnapper gang.

83
00:10:32,254 --> 00:10:34,044
Why did you suddenly ask to see this montage of the culprit?

84
00:10:34,044 --> 00:10:36,594
There is something I need to confirm.

85
00:10:38,954 --> 00:10:40,364
 Almost six-feet tall / Restless eyes, wrinkles on forehead / Scar on left cheek

86
00:10:40,364 --> 00:10:44,744
 Someone who claims to have killed the crown princess has appeared.

87
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:47,414
 Almost six-feet tall / Restless eyes, wrinkles on forehead / Scar on left cheek

88
00:11:01,224 --> 00:11:04,884
How much longer must I stay here?

89
00:11:04,884 --> 00:11:09,434
His excellency is already aware that I am here.

90
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:12,834
I must meet His excellency. Bring him to me.

91
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:22,674
What business would a mere kidnapper have with his excellency?

92
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:32,844
Well... he should not... treat me like that.

93
00:11:32,844 --> 00:11:37,304
Who knows what kind of things would pour out of my mouth?

94
00:11:37,304 --> 00:11:39,764
Go now and tell him.

95
00:11:39,764 --> 00:11:44,674
That I must meet him and tell him something.

96
00:13:43,554 --> 00:13:45,484
What's this?

97
00:13:47,054 --> 00:13:48,844
What is this?

98
00:13:51,184 --> 00:13:54,224
Why, what is going on?

99
00:13:56,414 --> 00:13:58,214
It seems to be scarlet fever.

100
00:13:58,214 --> 00:14:00,524
- A very scary form of smallpox.
- What did you say?

101
00:14:00,524 --> 00:14:03,114
Dismiss this maiden immediately!

102
00:14:09,784 --> 00:14:12,314
Take the tea table away, too!

103
00:14:16,624 --> 00:14:18,594
Smallpox, how so...

104
00:14:18,594 --> 00:14:20,934
The scariest thing is to bring in an infected outsider

105
00:14:20,934 --> 00:14:25,474
and have the infection spread within the palace.

106
00:14:26,994 --> 00:14:29,064
None of you behave rashly

107
00:14:29,064 --> 00:14:31,774
and summon a female physician at once to come and assess this situation!

108
00:14:31,774 --> 00:14:33,624
Yes, Your Highness.

109
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:39,264
My Lady... It is poison ivy.

110
00:14:47,604 --> 00:14:49,174
What should we do?

111
00:14:49,174 --> 00:14:51,384
My servant informed me earlier, that...

112
00:14:51,384 --> 00:14:55,554
my tea table has been switched to yours.

113
00:15:02,544 --> 00:15:05,454
Never mind. She says they were not switched.

114
00:15:05,454 --> 00:15:08,154
Why all the commotion?

115
00:15:08,154 --> 00:15:10,164
I am deeply overwhelmed to inform you, but...

116
00:15:10,164 --> 00:15:12,894
this does not seem to be a case of smallpox.

117
00:15:12,894 --> 00:15:14,584
What did you say?

118
00:15:16,364 --> 00:15:19,154
The tea does not smell of Chamdanggui* but of poison ivy lacquer.
  (Angelica gigas herb)

119
00:15:19,154 --> 00:15:20,654
That cannot be true.

120
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:25,934
How could someone bring a poisonous substance into this sacred place for queen selection?

121
00:15:31,124 --> 00:15:36,424
Then, will you believe me if I drink this tea and my body blisters all over?

122
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:51,834
Stop! That's enough.

123
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:53,804
Whether it is smallpox or poison ivy,

124
00:15:53,804 --> 00:15:57,454
the physician herself will determine once she examines the maiden.

125
00:15:58,754 --> 00:16:01,134
In that case, I would like to ask a question to Ye Hyeon Seon.

126
00:16:01,134 --> 00:16:04,534
All I simply said was that our tea tables were switched.

127
00:16:04,534 --> 00:16:08,734
Yet what was all the fuss she made, as if her tea was poisoned?

128
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,634
I feel wrongly accused, Your Highness.

129
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:14,264
I was simply scared that I might catch smallpox.

130
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:17,674
Though I can see clearly who in her evil mind is plotting such a terrible deed,

131
00:16:17,674 --> 00:16:20,764
but as a friend here under the same calling and heaven's will,

132
00:16:20,764 --> 00:16:23,754
I choose not to make spiteful remarks.

133
00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:38,354
Then, this man is...

134
00:16:38,354 --> 00:16:43,264
I believe he is the one responsible for the crown princess's death seven years ago.

135
00:16:43,264 --> 00:16:44,734
That is not all.

136
00:16:44,734 --> 00:16:47,704
In the case of impersonating the crown princess,

137
00:16:47,704 --> 00:16:50,574
they were trying to cut ties by killing Kim Eui  Jun with this knife.

138
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:55,004
Also, in the past, in her home

139
00:16:55,004 --> 00:16:58,334
he tried to harm her.

140
00:17:09,554 --> 00:17:12,314
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

141
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:30,334
Minister of Defense, Jo Seong Gyun.

142
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:45,434
Are you aware that the Investigation Bureau has now captured

143
00:17:45,434 --> 00:17:49,404
the leader of the kidnapper gang, the most wicked one of the Marriage Ban era?

144
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:54,204
I have heard and am aware.

145
00:17:54,204 --> 00:17:59,374
But upon investigating him, I learned something quite shocking.

146
00:17:59,374 --> 00:18:01,874
What would that be?

147
00:18:03,034 --> 00:18:07,404
I am at a loss for words, because it is so unbelievable.

148
00:18:07,404 --> 00:18:11,384
Thus, I have something to request of you.

149
00:18:11,384 --> 00:18:13,454
Please go ahead and give your command.

150
00:18:14,364 --> 00:18:19,484
I would like you to interrogate the man as the officer in charge, Minister of Defense.

151
00:18:26,154 --> 00:18:30,194
I will name the three ladies who hold the highest score.

152
00:18:34,744 --> 00:18:38,294
Park Yun Seo.

153
00:18:38,294 --> 00:18:43,304
Hong Hye Bin. And...

154
00:18:45,054 --> 00:18:49,114
Ye... Hyeon Seon.

155
00:18:49,114 --> 00:18:53,304
However, the grading does not end here.

156
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:04,954
This time around, the maidens will be evaluating one another.

157
00:19:04,954 --> 00:19:08,934
Then I will add these points to the scores amassed thus far,

158
00:19:08,934 --> 00:19:12,064
so be careful as you write your answers.

159
00:19:28,704 --> 00:19:33,344
The ranking has been completely reversed.

160
00:19:33,344 --> 00:19:37,304
The final... first place goes to...

161
00:19:39,374 --> 00:19:42,164
Seong Hwa Yun.

162
00:19:43,004 --> 00:19:44,754
My Lady.

163
00:19:46,704 --> 00:19:48,624
Wait!

164
00:19:50,094 --> 00:19:53,724
All the servants, make your way back here.

165
00:19:57,884 --> 00:19:59,984
Through the female physician's examination,

166
00:19:59,984 --> 00:20:03,964
the cause for the blisters was confirmed to be poison ivy sap.

167
00:20:03,964 --> 00:20:09,464
Then who put the poison ivy in the teacup?

168
00:20:11,434 --> 00:20:14,114
Everyone, reveal your hands.

169
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:52,764
What exactly... have you done here?

170
00:20:52,764 --> 00:20:54,234
No, Your Highness.

171
00:20:54,234 --> 00:20:57,994
This happened because I was trying to smell the tea after the fact.

172
00:20:57,994 --> 00:21:01,254
Had I known this was poison ivy sap, would I have dared to touch the tea?

173
00:21:01,254 --> 00:21:03,104
No need for your excuses!

174
00:21:03,104 --> 00:21:05,454
Put her in prison immediately!

175
00:21:05,454 --> 00:21:08,294
Your Highness! Your Highness, it is not so!

176
00:21:08,294 --> 00:21:10,554
Your Highness...

177
00:21:10,754 --> 00:21:12,814
Your Highness!

178
00:21:14,514 --> 00:21:17,104
Your Excellency. Your Excellency!

179
00:21:17,904 --> 00:21:21,804
Na Sang Ju keeps asking to see you.

180
00:21:21,804 --> 00:21:23,334
What should we do?

181
00:21:23,334 --> 00:21:28,384
Just how...could I manage to go there?

182
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:49,264
We prepared some meat soup as your final supper before death.

183
00:21:49,264 --> 00:21:51,674
Why so suspicious?

184
00:21:51,674 --> 00:21:53,424
It is ox-tail soup.

185
00:21:53,424 --> 00:21:57,344
Is it not fitting for you, who also has been cut off like a tail?

186
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,724
I'm having ox-head rice soup.

187
00:22:02,724 --> 00:22:06,014
For me, it is more important to catch the head of the culprits.

188
00:22:07,324 --> 00:22:09,764
If you are not going to eat it, leave it.

189
00:22:11,454 --> 00:22:14,314
I will place it on your memorial ceremony table.

190
00:22:15,314 --> 00:22:18,454
What do you mean, final supper before death?

191
00:22:18,454 --> 00:22:21,004
Then, do you think your superiors will leave you alone?

192
00:22:21,004 --> 00:22:25,304
Once you go into prison, starve yourself of all food and water.

193
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:30,704
Also, you never know when you might get stabbed, so always stand in the middle of the cell.

194
00:22:32,514 --> 00:22:35,704
Since you have done that all the time,

195
00:22:35,704 --> 00:22:38,474
you probably know better than I do.

196
00:22:48,754 --> 00:22:53,104
Your Majesty, I hear So Rang is in prison right now.

197
00:23:03,774 --> 00:23:07,884
She was personally imprisoned by the Queen Dowager herself.

198
00:23:07,884 --> 00:23:11,734
If you release her, the matter will become even bigger, Your Majesty.

199
00:23:22,544 --> 00:23:24,120
Wait here.

200
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

201
00:23:36,614 --> 00:23:38,614
Your Majesty.

202
00:23:43,324 --> 00:23:46,124
What happened?

203
00:23:49,164 --> 00:23:52,694
I am all right.

204
00:23:54,154 --> 00:23:57,544
I cannot be at peace even for a day.

205
00:24:05,874 --> 00:24:07,634
Open the door.

206
00:24:07,634 --> 00:24:09,744
But Your Majesty...

207
00:24:12,204 --> 00:24:15,194
I will be the one going inside.

208
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:21,924
Your Majesty, this is not a place for you to enter.

209
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:44,454
Your hands are too cold.

210
00:24:47,004 --> 00:24:51,314
This is not a heated room but a prison cell.

211
00:24:51,314 --> 00:24:56,374
If you stay in such a place, Your Majesty, you will hurt your health.

212
00:24:57,594 --> 00:25:00,644
What exactly happened?

213
00:25:01,364 --> 00:25:03,664
 When I found out you were a swindler,

214
00:25:03,664 --> 00:25:06,774
 I made a firm decision to punish you without fail

215
00:25:06,774 --> 00:25:09,564
 for deceiving the king and the royal family.

216
00:25:09,564 --> 00:25:15,084
 However, I left you alone because the king protected you as a king's royal chamber servant.

217
00:25:15,084 --> 00:25:21,434
 Yet what trickery are you scheming again to come into the place of queen selection?

218
00:25:21,434 --> 00:25:23,504
 I am not swindling, Your Highness.

219
00:25:23,504 --> 00:25:28,334
 Is it not already a swindle, claiming to be the servant of Seong Hwa Yun?

220
00:25:29,774 --> 00:25:34,034
 Are you determined to disrupt the queen selection process?

221
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:37,834
 In the hopes that you may receive a position?

222
00:25:37,834 --> 00:25:40,154
 I am...

223
00:25:40,154 --> 00:25:44,494
 only here to stop the person who must never be selected as queen.

224
00:25:44,494 --> 00:25:46,944
 You are already aware of

225
00:25:46,944 --> 00:25:50,584
 who that person is as well, Your Highness.

226
00:25:53,364 --> 00:25:56,734
 Our internal decision is also a part of the queen selection.

227
00:25:56,734 --> 00:25:58,884
 It is not something you should be involved in.

228
00:25:58,884 --> 00:26:04,104
 Then, what explains the poison ivy at the queen selection that is only a formality

229
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:07,534
 to accuse another maiden of having smallpox?

230
00:26:07,534 --> 00:26:12,304
 Your Highness is already aware

231
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:16,064
 of the things that are happening surrounding the queen selection.

232
00:26:16,064 --> 00:26:19,574
 Because you knew they were covering your eyes and ears

233
00:26:19,574 --> 00:26:24,094
 and that is why you had the maidens evaluate one another.

234
00:26:24,094 --> 00:26:29,054
 Moreover, I am well aware of why you have imprisoned me.

235
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:34,394
 Rather than accusing those who have served you for a long time, by sending me to prison,

236
00:26:34,394 --> 00:26:38,624
 perhaps you were hoping they would eventually repent for their wrong deeds.

237
00:26:40,094 --> 00:26:41,644
 How shrewd of you.

238
00:26:41,644 --> 00:26:47,744
 Therefore, I will remain in prison as Your Highness has commanded.

239
00:26:47,744 --> 00:26:53,844
 That is the one thing I can do to protect Your Highness's interests.

240
00:26:54,704 --> 00:27:00,784
 It is possible I may never release you and keep you locked up in prison forever.

241
00:27:00,784 --> 00:27:07,004
 Sometimes, you have to put your life on the line to reveal the truth.

242
00:27:09,084 --> 00:27:10,684
 Put your life on the line, you say?

243
00:27:10,684 --> 00:27:13,684
 If, as a result of this, the queen selection process were to continue smoothly,

244
00:27:13,684 --> 00:27:17,944
 just what importance would my life hold?

245
00:27:17,944 --> 00:27:20,314
Are you saying you entrusted your life to the great queen dowager?

246
00:27:20,314 --> 00:27:22,030
Are you not even scared of this place?

247
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,870
I, too...

248
00:27:24,404 --> 00:27:26,614
am scared.

249
00:27:28,134 --> 00:27:32,744
Previously when I was locked up in prison, I was so scared that...

250
00:27:32,744 --> 00:27:36,684
I tried to escape

251
00:27:36,684 --> 00:27:39,454
by means of deception and lies.

252
00:27:39,454 --> 00:27:43,660
However, I cannot do so this time.

253
00:27:44,274 --> 00:27:46,644
It is not the right thing to do, either.

254
00:27:47,574 --> 00:27:50,514
Will you continue to remain here, then?

255
00:27:51,884 --> 00:27:54,744
Do not worry, Your Majesty.

256
00:27:54,744 --> 00:28:00,134
Once the culprit of this case has been revealed,the corruption behind the queen selection

257
00:28:00,134 --> 00:28:03,944
will be exposed in every detail.

258
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:08,844
Still, So Rang...

259
00:28:11,284 --> 00:28:16,300
♫  On this night, when even the moon is asleep  ♫

260
00:28:17,764 --> 00:28:23,880
♫  Where are you going in such a rush?  ♫

261
00:28:25,724 --> 00:28:29,460
♫  Leaving on a long trip  ♫

262
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,110
♫  tonight without a word   ♫

263
00:28:33,114 --> 00:28:38,400
♫  where are you rushing to?  ♫

264
00:28:44,174 --> 00:28:46,960
It puzzles me...

265
00:28:47,514 --> 00:28:51,054
why I must be the one

266
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,664
to take upon such a task.

267
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:59,644
Please understand. If one is involved in the kidnapping case even by a little bit,

268
00:28:59,644 --> 00:29:04,504
would he not try to minimize the situation or defend the culprit?

269
00:29:05,874 --> 00:29:07,594
Let us go.

270
00:29:28,034 --> 00:29:33,574
So are you a remnant of the kidnapping gang?

271
00:29:33,574 --> 00:29:36,374
How determined you were...

272
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:41,234
to scorn this nation's royal family and kingdom!

273
00:29:41,904 --> 00:29:44,314
I will ask you one more time.

274
00:29:44,314 --> 00:29:49,794
Did you kidnap young women and sell them off?

275
00:30:01,004 --> 00:30:02,854
Minister of Defense.

276
00:30:07,234 --> 00:30:11,734
If he is the one exposed as the leader of the kidnappers,

277
00:30:12,574 --> 00:30:15,404
what punishment do you think is appropriate?

278
00:30:16,144 --> 00:30:18,824
Decapitation

279
00:30:18,824 --> 00:30:20,674
would probably be the case.

280
00:30:20,674 --> 00:30:23,004
And what if this man...

281
00:30:32,494 --> 00:30:34,894
is the one who killed

282
00:30:36,884 --> 00:30:41,884
the crown princess seven years ago?

283
00:30:43,464 --> 00:30:47,024
What punishment would you deem appropriate, then?

284
00:30:54,674 --> 00:30:58,984
The destruction... of his entire family seems appropriate.

285
00:30:58,984 --> 00:31:01,484
His entire family, you say?

286
00:31:04,304 --> 00:31:07,664
In that case, anyone who is blood-related to this man

287
00:31:08,464 --> 00:31:11,314
will no longer remain alive.

288
00:31:11,314 --> 00:31:15,704
The blood from all of his clan members will overflow into a bloody river.

289
00:31:16,714 --> 00:31:21,024
Of course, you should take upon administering that punishment, Minister.

290
00:31:21,884 --> 00:31:24,984
Without a doubt, Sire.

291
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:29,414
Ask him again.

292
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:40,900
Are you... a remnant of the kidnapping gang?

293
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:46,494
That word, "remnant"...

294
00:31:46,494 --> 00:31:49,104
is a bit regrettable.

295
00:31:49,104 --> 00:31:51,124
I am...

296
00:31:51,124 --> 00:31:55,824
the very leader of the kidnapper gang.

297
00:31:55,824 --> 00:32:01,044
Struggling to survive, I took to kidnapping women.

298
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:05,474
Your crimes are those of a ruffian.

299
00:32:05,474 --> 00:32:07,894
You are right.

300
00:32:07,894 --> 00:32:12,344
I kidnapped women who were unable to marry due to the Marriage Ban

301
00:32:12,344 --> 00:32:15,774
and sold them off to whomever paid me.

302
00:32:15,774 --> 00:32:18,644
The younger the age, the higher the price.

303
00:32:18,644 --> 00:32:23,094
I thoroughly ransacked secluded women's quarters to find young girls

304
00:32:23,094 --> 00:32:27,194
- to kidnap and sell them off.
 - You wretch!

305
00:32:27,194 --> 00:32:31,444
Even after such a shameless deed ...

306
00:32:31,444 --> 00:32:34,304
you dare to live?

307
00:32:35,324 --> 00:32:37,064
This is...

308
00:32:37,764 --> 00:32:40,244
nothing compared to other deeds I did.

309
00:32:40,244 --> 00:32:45,144
This year, I hanged a woman who pretended to be the crown princess in the palace.

310
00:32:45,144 --> 00:32:46,934
And by killing the captain of the royal guards,

311
00:32:46,934 --> 00:32:49,234
I cut off the tail so the person behind the scenes would not be revealed.

312
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:51,744
And just like that, every year...

313
00:32:51,744 --> 00:32:55,204
I hanged women in the crown princess' palace!

314
00:32:55,204 --> 00:32:59,564
And even seven years ago, upon receiving a commission,

315
00:32:59,564 --> 00:33:02,724
I killed a person within this palace.

316
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,574
And that person...

317
00:33:06,474 --> 00:33:08,400
was...

318
00:33:11,784 --> 00:33:13,654
the then crown princess.

319
00:33:15,304 --> 00:33:18,594
Ahn Ja Yeon.

320
00:33:24,864 --> 00:33:28,454
How dare you speak her name?

321
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:31,204
Answer me truthfully.

322
00:33:31,204 --> 00:33:34,604
Who ordered you to commit such deeds?

323
00:33:35,584 --> 00:33:40,924
Please withdraw... your sword, Your Majesty.

324
00:33:41,904 --> 00:33:45,624
You better confess now and speak.

325
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:49,684
Please withdraw your sword, Your Majesty.

326
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:57,094
I am planning on taking care of this based on national law.

327
00:34:04,484 --> 00:34:06,654
National law?

328
00:34:09,574 --> 00:34:12,564
Then I will ask you a question.

329
00:34:13,744 --> 00:34:17,504
The one who ordered this man to commit all these crimes,

330
00:34:18,504 --> 00:34:21,804
what do you think would be a suitable punishment?

331
00:34:25,604 --> 00:34:28,664
The national law seems to say this.

332
00:34:29,904 --> 00:34:33,014
Find the one who is responsible for the crime

333
00:34:34,264 --> 00:34:36,544
and execute him by tearing him into pieces.

334
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,644
Sit down.

335
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,854
You are doing this to pressure me, aren't you? So that I should do the investigation on the queen selection properly?

336
00:35:30,854 --> 00:35:33,034
How did you know?

337
00:35:33,954 --> 00:35:36,594
I am still searching constantly, so do not worry.

338
00:35:36,594 --> 00:35:39,684
How poison ivy got into the selection venue ...

339
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:46,074
Lady Hwa Yun was probably quite frightened, right?

340
00:35:46,074 --> 00:35:48,194
She probably was.

341
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:54,184
I heard ... about how you dressed up as a woman.

342
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,864
It is a shame that I was not able to see that.

343
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,804
It was probably best for your eye health that you did not see it.

344
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,604
How are you able to laugh?

345
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,594
I told you...that I will take you to a place where you can laugh.

346
00:36:15,594 --> 00:36:17,344
Just a bit longer.

347
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,494
Hold on for just a bit longer.

348
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,184
Yes.

349
00:36:31,234 --> 00:36:32,904
So Rang...

350
00:36:32,904 --> 00:36:35,174
Court Lady Won...

351
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:53,334
What have you been doing that you have not contacted me once?

352
00:36:53,334 --> 00:36:57,944
Then what have you done that you are here?

353
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,374
It is a long story.

354
00:37:02,374 --> 00:37:07,334
Well, so ... is it nice to be outside of the palace?

355
00:37:07,334 --> 00:37:09,764
Did you find your husband?

356
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:14,934
 Yes, it would be weird for him not to have remarried.

357
00:37:14,934 --> 00:37:19,634
 Let me just see his face once from afar and then go back.

358
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:24,934
 Hey! What are you doing with that heavy thing! I will carry it. I will do it.

359
00:37:24,934 --> 00:37:27,550
 - Mother! 
 - Oh, Beom Sang!

360
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,914
 - Yes, you have worked so hard.
 - Yeon Sil!

361
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,954
 - Let us eat.
 - Beom Sang, let us eat.

362
00:37:31,954 --> 00:37:34,504
 Today is soybean paste stew again.

363
00:37:34,504 --> 00:37:36,224
 - It is always soybean paste stew!
 - There are side dishes, too!

364
00:37:36,224 --> 00:37:38,404
 Aigoo, complaining about food...

365
00:37:38,404 --> 00:37:41,414
 - You are hungry, right?
 - Yes. Aigoo!

366
00:37:41,414 --> 00:37:44,414
 Let's go inside quickly.

367
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:51,364
 My younger sister raised my son...

368
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:56,054
It is quite the cruel fate, is it not?

369
00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:00,834
Then...what happened after that?

370
00:38:00,834 --> 00:38:04,894
I returned to Affection Village and stayed there.

371
00:38:04,894 --> 00:38:10,094
For all this time, I have been thinking much about fate.

372
00:38:10,094 --> 00:38:14,514
Perhaps fate was not for my husband and me to be together,

373
00:38:14,514 --> 00:38:17,904
but for my younger sister and my husband.

374
00:38:17,904 --> 00:38:20,944
And I was only the means by which they met.

375
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,114
 It is possible

376
00:38:27,114 --> 00:38:31,614
that my fate may not be much different.

377
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,184
My half-sister...

378
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,484
I heard the story as I was brought here.

379
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:43,014
That there is a maiden who is receiving massive support from the Inner Court.

380
00:38:43,014 --> 00:38:46,484
You are in here because of their slander.

381
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:56,304
You have to leave now.

382
00:38:56,304 --> 00:39:00,064
I will hear the details of your story later.

383
00:39:00,064 --> 00:39:04,974
However, I will not sit idly by and let you meet the same fate as me.

384
00:39:04,974 --> 00:39:07,434
I shall help you, So Rang.

385
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,964
Have you all been well?

386
00:39:24,964 --> 00:39:28,684
I heard that you have been looking for me quite earnestly.

387
00:39:28,684 --> 00:39:31,914
Let me take a look at the jade hairpins in question.

388
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:43,254
I have never seen those before.

389
00:39:43,254 --> 00:39:45,044
No!

390
00:39:45,044 --> 00:39:50,394
Court Lady Won definitely gave us the jade hairpins, saying that she had a big favor to ask later.

391
00:39:50,394 --> 00:39:54,954
It is clear she was trying to put in a candidate request for the queen selection process.

392
00:39:54,954 --> 00:39:58,104
Why would I have done such a thing?

393
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:01,504
You probably were bought over by someone.

394
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,854
From what I can see, you all are the ones who were bought off and conspired to all say the same thing.

395
00:40:05,854 --> 00:40:07,754
And that thing is the evidence of that.

396
00:40:07,754 --> 00:40:13,444
I never imagined that you all would do something like this in my absence!

397
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,994
Seol Hwa, it has been a long while.

398
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:29,214
Court Lady Won...

399
00:40:29,214 --> 00:40:32,774
Why are you here?

400
00:40:32,774 --> 00:40:37,234
When you first entered the palace, you asked to give you just one chance.

401
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:42,434
You needed to become a court lady to provide for your family, who was deep in debt.

402
00:40:42,434 --> 00:40:45,674
And when your youngest sibling came back to life after nearly starving to death,

403
00:40:45,674 --> 00:40:50,474
you said that I saved not just one life but eight lives.

404
00:40:50,474 --> 00:40:55,254
So then...is this also for your family's sake?

405
00:40:55,254 --> 00:40:57,214
Court Lady...

406
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:03,354
The tables have turned, and my life is in your hands now.

407
00:41:03,354 --> 00:41:06,964
If you do not tell the truth,

408
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,404
I will die.

409
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:17,774
I will ask you one more time.

410
00:41:17,774 --> 00:41:21,884
Did Head Court Lady Won really give you the jade hairpin?

411
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,544
That is...

412
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,334
Then who is the one who gave you the jade hairpin?

413
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,034
There were those who received jade hairpins,

414
00:41:38,034 --> 00:41:43,024
but some also received farmland to provide for their families outside of the palace.

415
00:41:43,024 --> 00:41:47,714
It is they...who have been assigned to the queen selection process.

416
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:51,604
By chance, do you know their names?

417
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:39,374
You have been through a lot. His majesty is waiting for you.

418
00:42:54,970 --> 00:43:01,004
♫  I think about only you all day.  ♫

419
00:43:01,004 --> 00:43:10,774
♫  Because I wonder if you know the way I feel  ♫

420
00:43:10,774 --> 00:43:14,744
♫  Because I long for you  ♫

421
00:43:14,744 --> 00:43:21,310
♫  Because I always want to see you  ♫

422
00:43:22,234 --> 00:43:28,334
♫  Even by chance, can you hear me?  ♫

423
00:43:28,334 --> 00:43:33,524
Of all the places, why did you wait for me here?

424
00:43:33,524 --> 00:43:38,004
I cannot do it today. I am too tired today.

425
00:43:38,004 --> 00:43:39,954
What a shame.

426
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:44,374
I was going to warm up your cold body.

427
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:51,094
You cannot tempt me like that, either. If you do, I cannot help but fall for it.

428
00:44:07,334 --> 00:44:11,544
So you are saying that he confessed to all the things he did?

429
00:44:11,544 --> 00:44:18,004
After all these years I have cared for him, he dares to bite me?

430
00:44:18,004 --> 00:44:19,614
What are you going to do?

431
00:44:19,614 --> 00:44:23,994
How could I let a dog that bit his owner stay alive?

432
00:44:36,154 --> 00:44:40,514
By chance, he would not have rambled on about everything yet, right?

433
00:44:40,514 --> 00:44:44,204
Even for things that are clear as day,

434
00:44:44,204 --> 00:44:47,374
when I say that they are not true,

435
00:44:47,374 --> 00:44:51,594
people accept what I say as truth.

436
00:44:51,594 --> 00:44:53,554
That is power.

437
00:44:53,554 --> 00:44:59,244
The one who planned the seven years of the Marriage Ban was me.

438
00:44:59,244 --> 00:45:03,234
Now, it is time to come up with the next plan.

439
00:45:03,234 --> 00:45:07,654
During this queen selection process, Hyeon Seon will become the head of the Inner Court,

440
00:45:07,654 --> 00:45:13,384
so the next royal power will also be in our hands.

441
00:45:13,384 --> 00:45:15,404
If that happens,

442
00:45:15,404 --> 00:45:20,914
then everything else will come to an end unbelievably easily.

443
00:45:20,914 --> 00:45:23,814
So easily that would even make you wonder.

444
00:45:23,814 --> 00:45:31,664
We must do whatever it takes to make my Hyeon Seon the mistress of the queen's palace.

445
00:45:31,664 --> 00:45:34,284
Come on now! I told you that I could not!

446
00:45:34,284 --> 00:45:36,914
How could I leak the secrets of the heavens so recklessly?

447
00:45:36,914 --> 00:45:41,114
Everyone in the country knows that two maidens are left from the three-part queen selection process.

448
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:44,074
We are asking you to tell us who you think will be the one out of the two.

449
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,044
Is that difficult?

450
00:45:45,044 --> 00:45:46,814
- That's right!
 - If you don't know, forget it.

451
00:45:46,814 --> 00:45:49,974
Hey! Who said I didn't know?

452
00:45:52,084 --> 00:45:57,684
Let me see. The maiden who will be selected as queen this time is...

453
00:45:57,684 --> 00:45:59,024
From the family of Seong.

454
00:45:59,024 --> 00:46:01,324
- Seong?
 - Or...

455
00:46:01,324 --> 00:46:03,014
- From the family of Ye?
 - Geez!

456
00:46:03,014 --> 00:46:06,234
I heard you got really sick. Did your spiritual power die?

457
00:46:06,234 --> 00:46:08,894
It is dead. It died!

458
00:46:08,894 --> 00:46:11,374
All right. So what is the important thing here?

459
00:46:11,374 --> 00:46:15,714
Once the queen selection is over, the Marriage Ban Edict will be repealed.

460
00:46:15,714 --> 00:46:17,654
- Then what do we need to do?
 - What?

461
00:46:17,654 --> 00:46:19,104
What else would it be?

462
00:46:19,104 --> 00:46:21,024
You all should come here to get your compatibility readings, of course!

463
00:46:21,024 --> 00:46:24,204
Are you not going to marry off your children?

464
00:46:24,204 --> 00:46:26,734
True, true. Just wait and see.

465
00:46:26,734 --> 00:46:28,904
In the upcoming torrent of wedding ceremonies,

466
00:46:28,904 --> 00:46:31,154
there will be a temporary boom in the wedding business.

467
00:46:31,154 --> 00:46:36,234
I heard that the linen shops and wedding gift shops are busy preparing for customers these days.

468
00:46:36,234 --> 00:46:38,784
You should also hurry up and get your things ready before it is too late!

469
00:46:38,784 --> 00:46:40,634
Really?

470
00:46:40,634 --> 00:46:42,444
A business boom will come upon us soon!

471
00:46:42,444 --> 00:46:45,174
Aigoo, I am so happy!

472
00:46:45,174 --> 00:46:47,194
Hae Yeong.

473
00:46:47,194 --> 00:46:49,554
Did you not say that we need to fix the eaves over there?

474
00:46:49,554 --> 00:46:52,564
Go and get a price for the repairs.

475
00:46:52,564 --> 00:46:55,784
But what if someone does get selected as queen?

476
00:46:55,784 --> 00:46:58,314
What about Eonni So Rang?

477
00:46:58,314 --> 00:47:01,144
She will live according to her fate, then.

478
00:47:01,894 --> 00:47:05,754
But what if the queen selection process goes wrong this time as well?

479
00:47:05,754 --> 00:47:08,554
Then there will be civil unrest across the nation.

480
00:47:08,554 --> 00:47:10,994
Y-Yes. Especially... what was that again?

481
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,924
Will the Born Sul Ro group sit idly by?

482
00:47:12,924 --> 00:47:18,214
- I heard that it was a group of disgruntled people from all over the nation. 
 - That's right.

483
00:47:18,214 --> 00:47:21,034
There will surely be trouble.

484
00:47:21,034 --> 00:47:22,114
Gosh, oh, no...

485
00:47:22,114 --> 00:47:23,964
That cannot happen.

486
00:47:23,964 --> 00:47:25,374
If this queen selection goes wrong as well,

487
00:47:25,374 --> 00:47:27,584
who knows how much longer they will extend the Marriage Ban!

488
00:47:27,584 --> 00:47:30,334
Deok Hun, we do not know that for sure.

489
00:47:30,334 --> 00:47:33,154
The queen selections have been canceled several times in the past seven years.

490
00:47:33,154 --> 00:47:36,114
We must somehow deliver our message to the royal family and the royal court.

491
00:47:36,114 --> 00:47:39,094
The desperate wishes of the Born Sul Ro.

492
00:47:39,094 --> 00:47:41,504
Our desperate wishes, yes.

493
00:47:41,504 --> 00:47:45,234
However, if things go wrong, we might be misunderstood.

494
00:47:45,234 --> 00:47:51,724
All we want is to deliver our wish, hope, and desire to meet a partner and get married,

495
00:47:51,724 --> 00:47:54,684
but what if it looks like a rebellion against the nation?

496
00:47:54,684 --> 00:47:56,944
It is not as if we are plotting treason.

497
00:47:56,944 --> 00:47:59,894
We might be accused of being traitors.

498
00:48:05,194 --> 00:48:08,464
- There is a way.
 - What is it?

499
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:19,484
What are you going to do with that?

500
00:48:37,274 --> 00:48:38,594
What is this?

501
00:48:38,594 --> 00:48:41,254
So did the two of them get together or not?

502
00:48:41,254 --> 00:48:44,134
What am I supposed to do if they end it here!

503
00:48:46,974 --> 00:48:48,944
 If you want the Born Sul Ro to meet their fated lover,

504
00:48:48,944 --> 00:48:52,794
 come to the front of the city gate on the day of the queen selection results.

505
00:49:05,774 --> 00:49:07,314
The prisoner has escaped!

506
00:49:07,314 --> 00:49:08,984
Search everywhere for him!

507
00:49:08,984 --> 00:49:10,634
Yes, sir!

508
00:49:50,334 --> 00:49:51,424
What did you say?

509
00:49:51,424 --> 00:49:53,464
The one named So Rang, who was released from prison,

510
00:49:53,464 --> 00:49:57,104
disappeared from the palace without a trace.

511
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,264
She could not have left the palace yet.

512
00:50:13,264 --> 00:50:16,544
Search everywhere, in every corner.

513
00:50:16,544 --> 00:50:18,424
Yes, Sire.

514
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,434
Your Majesty.

515
00:50:30,434 --> 00:50:33,844
Supposedly, there is someone who saw So Rang's movements last night.

516
00:50:33,844 --> 00:50:37,354
However, the place she was headed...

517
00:51:02,094 --> 00:51:03,104
What do you think?

518
00:51:03,104 --> 00:51:06,104
If we do this, we look pretty cute, so they will not arrest us.

519
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:10,854
Wow, we definitely do not look dangerous.

520
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:26,124
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

521
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:28,014
Repeal it! Repeal it!

522
00:51:28,014 --> 00:51:29,684
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

523
00:51:29,684 --> 00:51:31,534
Repeal it! Repeal it!

524
00:51:31,534 --> 00:51:34,804
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

525
00:51:34,804 --> 00:51:38,134
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

526
00:51:38,134 --> 00:51:41,584
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

527
00:51:41,584 --> 00:51:44,854
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

528
00:51:44,854 --> 00:51:48,314
Repeal the Marriage Bam Edict!

529
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:51,834
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

530
00:51:51,834 --> 00:51:55,424
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

531
00:51:55,424 --> 00:51:58,764
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

532
00:51:58,764 --> 00:52:02,054
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

533
00:52:02,054 --> 00:52:04,444
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

534
00:52:04,444 --> 00:52:06,094
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

535
00:52:06,094 --> 00:52:07,714
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

536
00:52:07,714 --> 00:52:09,314
Repeal it! Repeal it!

537
00:52:09,314 --> 00:52:12,734
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

538
00:52:12,734 --> 00:52:16,194
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

539
00:52:16,194 --> 00:52:19,544
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

540
00:52:19,544 --> 00:52:22,854
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

541
00:52:22,854 --> 00:52:26,434
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

542
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:29,404
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

543
00:52:29,404 --> 00:52:33,730
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

544
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:40,664
My Lord, are you all right?

545
00:52:41,724 --> 00:52:43,504
Just hold on for a bit longer.

546
00:52:43,504 --> 00:52:48,144
Today is the glorious day that our Hyeon Seon becomes the queen of this nation.

547
00:52:48,144 --> 00:52:50,714
Is that not why the queen dowager

548
00:52:50,714 --> 00:52:54,824
called us in privately since we will become the king's father- and mother-in-law?

549
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:04,704
You should wait here, Honorable Lady.

550
00:53:04,704 --> 00:53:07,964
We will escort his excellency inside.

551
00:53:10,304 --> 00:53:14,454
Do you not know who I am?

552
00:53:15,254 --> 00:53:21,264
All the court ladies who know you are at the interrogation site right now.

553
00:53:22,234 --> 00:53:27,834
Her highness the queen dowager has requested a one-on-one meeting with his excellency Ye.

554
00:53:29,054 --> 00:53:31,264
Step aside.

555
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:56,614
It has been a long time.

556
00:53:56,614 --> 00:54:00,994
I heard that your health was not good since you retired from your position.

557
00:54:00,994 --> 00:54:03,044
I am sorry, Your Highness.

558
00:54:03,044 --> 00:54:07,874
The reason why I asked to meet with you despite you not being physically well

559
00:54:07,874 --> 00:54:11,824
is because of your daughter, who has become a candidate for the queen selection.

560
00:54:11,824 --> 00:54:17,294
You must have worried a lot since you sent her off to such a big test, right?

561
00:54:17,294 --> 00:54:22,564
All the preparations were done by my wife, so I did nothing.

562
00:54:22,564 --> 00:54:24,614
I see.

563
00:54:25,234 --> 00:54:30,514
I, too, met your wife often.

564
00:54:30,514 --> 00:54:33,114
In order to be duly cautious with the queen selection,

565
00:54:33,114 --> 00:54:36,704
I received all the candidates' information from her,

566
00:54:36,704 --> 00:54:40,184
but I did not think that she would meet with the Inner Court's relatives

567
00:54:40,184 --> 00:54:44,764
and even with the court ladies.

568
00:54:46,254 --> 00:54:47,914
Is that so?

569
00:54:47,914 --> 00:54:52,774
Tell me more about your eldest daughter.

570
00:54:52,774 --> 00:54:55,264
Tell me what kind of child she is.

571
00:54:56,354 --> 00:54:58,354
My eldest daughter...

572
00:55:00,854 --> 00:55:06,604
was a troublemaker and a tomboy, but she was a wise child.

573
00:55:07,234 --> 00:55:13,224
Was not the daughter who is participating in the queen selection your eldest daughter?

574
00:55:13,224 --> 00:55:14,944
Pardon?

575
00:55:15,534 --> 00:55:18,134
O-Oh, yes, she is...

576
00:55:18,134 --> 00:55:20,434
My eldest daughter is Hyeon Seon.

577
00:55:20,434 --> 00:55:23,804
It has been a while since I have seen you, Your Highness, so I got a bit nervous...

578
00:55:23,804 --> 00:55:26,834
No. No.

579
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:32,044
Then, where is your other daughter?

580
00:55:32,044 --> 00:55:34,854
I heard that you had two daughters.

581
00:55:35,514 --> 00:55:37,304
Well—

582
00:55:37,304 --> 00:55:39,624
W-Well, the thing is...

583
00:56:03,964 --> 00:56:08,234
Both of you managed to get to this point after going through many difficulties.

584
00:56:08,234 --> 00:56:10,554
Once the three-part queen selection is finished today,

585
00:56:10,554 --> 00:56:16,354
I will immediately declare the results to everyone.

586
00:56:16,354 --> 00:56:20,004
The final question that I have prepared is...

587
00:56:20,004 --> 00:56:23,904
about why you need to become the queen of this nation.

588
00:56:23,904 --> 00:56:27,374
The two maidens here, answer me.

589
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:30,314
I am sorry to say this...

590
00:56:30,314 --> 00:56:32,474
but I...

591
00:56:32,474 --> 00:56:37,664
do not have a reason why I need to become the queen of this nation.

592
00:56:41,014 --> 00:56:45,984
Your answers are always shocking, Lady Seong.

593
00:56:45,984 --> 00:56:52,104
Then, do you desire Lady Ye Hyeon Seon to become queen?

594
00:56:59,634 --> 00:57:02,254
Yes. That is correct.

595
00:57:03,234 --> 00:57:05,134
Tell me clearly.

596
00:57:05,134 --> 00:57:08,514
Are you saying that you will withdraw from this?

597
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,944
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

598
00:57:29,944 --> 00:57:31,784
Repeal it! Repeal it!

599
00:57:31,784 --> 00:57:33,514
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

600
00:57:33,514 --> 00:57:35,424
Repeal it! Repeal it!

601
00:57:35,424 --> 00:57:38,424
Repeal it! Repeal it!

602
00:57:39,614 --> 00:57:43,604
I thought that the reason why I could not have a lover

603
00:57:43,604 --> 00:57:46,604
was because I was born lowly and pathetic.

604
00:57:46,604 --> 00:57:49,304
However, no matter how lowly I was born,

605
00:57:49,304 --> 00:57:52,794
I am still a human being, so would I not have the desire to love?

606
00:57:52,794 --> 00:57:54,664
Would I not have the desire to marry?

607
00:57:54,664 --> 00:57:57,284
That is right! That is right!

608
00:57:57,284 --> 00:57:59,074
That is right! That is right!

609
00:57:59,074 --> 00:58:03,124
Why is the nation making me live as a Sul Ro who cannot marry

610
00:58:03,124 --> 00:58:05,954
and a dishonorable son who breaks his parents' hearts,

611
00:58:05,954 --> 00:58:09,484
and like a castrated man who cannot bear children!

612
00:58:09,484 --> 00:58:12,814
The royal family must finish the queen selection process as soon as possible

613
00:58:12,814 --> 00:58:16,344
and repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

614
00:58:16,344 --> 00:58:18,764
Yes!

615
00:58:18,764 --> 00:58:21,024
Yes!

616
00:58:25,844 --> 00:58:29,494
Is trying to love someone a crime in this nation?

617
00:58:29,494 --> 00:58:33,714
Now, let us make our own paths!

618
00:58:33,714 --> 00:58:36,714
Yes!

619
00:58:36,714 --> 00:58:38,374
Yes!

620
00:58:38,374 --> 00:58:40,744
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

621
00:58:40,744 --> 00:58:42,674
Repeal it! Repeal it!

622
00:58:42,674 --> 00:58:44,884
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

623
00:58:44,884 --> 00:58:47,434
Repeal it! Repeal it!

624
00:58:47,434 --> 00:58:49,474
Repeal it! Repeal it!

625
00:58:49,474 --> 00:58:51,514
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

626
00:58:51,514 --> 00:58:52,994
Repeal it! Repeal it!

627
00:58:52,994 --> 00:58:54,304
What is this noise?

628
00:58:54,304 --> 00:58:56,324
I hear that the people have gathered like a cloud

629
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:59,354
in front of the palace to hear the results of the queen selection.

630
00:58:59,354 --> 00:59:03,014
However, we are going to turn them away for safety's sake,

631
00:59:03,014 --> 00:59:06,034
so they say it may be a bit noisy for a moment.

632
00:59:06,034 --> 00:59:07,924
No.

633
00:59:07,924 --> 00:59:13,844
All of them must have desperately longed for this day.

634
00:59:13,844 --> 00:59:19,354
I shall personally declare the results of the queen selection.

635
00:59:20,114 --> 00:59:25,264
Since you, the queen dowager, deigns to go out address the people personally,

636
00:59:25,264 --> 00:59:29,044
how could I not be present?

637
00:59:29,044 --> 00:59:33,244
Chief Royal Secretary, tell them to just go ahead and open up the palace gates.

638
00:59:33,244 --> 00:59:35,524
But, Your Majesty...

639
00:59:37,294 --> 00:59:41,314
Do you know whose name is written here?

640
00:59:41,314 --> 00:59:43,284
Regardless of whose name it is,

641
00:59:43,284 --> 00:59:46,154
it was the decision of the most esteemed Inner Court,

642
00:59:46,154 --> 00:59:49,524
so would it not be my duty to follow it?

643
00:59:49,524 --> 00:59:54,224
Repealing the Marriage Ban Edict of this country which has lasted for so long like this

644
00:59:54,854 --> 00:59:58,974
would be the way I can respond to the loud voices of the people.

645
01:00:05,504 --> 01:00:09,654
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

646
01:00:09,654 --> 01:00:13,824
Repeal the Marriage Ban Edict!

647
01:00:13,824 --> 01:00:15,924
Open the gates.

648
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:24,564
Soon, the royal family will declare the results of the queen selection process.

649
01:00:24,564 --> 01:00:30,014
His majesty the king said that he will hear it together with his people.

650
01:00:34,784 --> 01:00:36,624
What are you all doing?

651
01:00:36,624 --> 01:00:38,914
Everyone, come in.

652
01:00:45,284 --> 01:00:47,214
Why are we being let in?

653
01:00:47,864 --> 01:00:50,304
Is it all right for us to go inside?

654
01:00:50,304 --> 01:00:51,184
We should go!

655
01:00:51,184 --> 01:00:52,774
We should go!

656
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:54,084
Hurry up! We should go.

657
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:56,254
We should go.

658
01:00:56,254 --> 01:00:57,734
Go, go.

659
01:00:57,734 --> 01:01:00,604
O-Over there.

660
01:01:01,934 --> 01:01:04,044
Repeal!

661
01:01:09,244 --> 01:01:10,924
Oh, my goodness, what in the world is going on?

662
01:01:10,924 --> 01:01:14,034
Wow, we get to look around the palace!

663
01:01:23,824 --> 01:01:25,684
 The Marriage Ban Edict—

664
01:01:52,754 --> 01:01:58,124
Show your respect to his majesty the king by bowing your heads.

665
01:02:22,874 --> 01:02:25,574
Everyone, raise your heads.

666
01:02:46,604 --> 01:02:49,614
I also know.

667
01:02:49,614 --> 01:02:51,744
Seven years!

668
01:02:51,744 --> 01:02:56,104
What a long time it has been for the people...

669
01:02:56,104 --> 01:03:01,694
How much pain you have all suffered from the long-lasting Marriage Ban ...

670
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,794
However,

671
01:03:05,474 --> 01:03:08,484
there is something that I did not get to tell everyone.

672
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:12,464
The reason why the Marriage Ban lasted this long

673
01:03:12,464 --> 01:03:14,914
was because of horrific murders.

674
01:03:20,294 --> 01:03:24,064
Starting with the crown princess, who passed away seven years ago,

675
01:03:24,764 --> 01:03:28,294
horrific murders were committed every year inside the palace.

676
01:03:28,294 --> 01:03:30,404
So that no one could be selected as queen,

677
01:03:30,404 --> 01:03:33,144
so that no one could rise to the position of queen,

678
01:03:33,144 --> 01:03:39,044
each one of them was hung as a dead body.

679
01:03:41,124 --> 01:03:42,784
Even for this queen selection process,

680
01:03:42,784 --> 01:03:46,534
there was an attempt to kidnap the most likely candidate, but fortunately,

681
01:03:46,534 --> 01:03:48,784
we were able to prevent that from happening.

682
01:03:48,784 --> 01:03:52,914
And thus, we were finally able to select a queen.

683
01:03:54,734 --> 01:03:57,414
- Is that not good?
 - Right.

684
01:03:57,414 --> 01:04:01,504
All of this was thanks to you all, who endured the pain with me.

685
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:06,644
And thus, it is only right that I share this joy with you all.

686
01:04:06,644 --> 01:04:11,264
And so, the  queen dowager, who is the matriarch of the royal family,

687
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:15,674
will declare who will be the new queen.

688
01:04:37,174 --> 01:04:41,494
The new queen...

689
01:04:42,354 --> 01:04:44,134
is...

690
01:04:58,414 --> 01:05:01,354
Ye Hyeon Seon.

691
01:05:13,014 --> 01:05:15,194
Lord, it has happened!

692
01:05:15,194 --> 01:05:19,444
Our daughter has become the queen!

693
01:05:19,444 --> 01:05:23,024
The maiden who has been selected, please come up.

694
01:05:49,174 --> 01:05:51,204
Wait, that is...

695
01:06:03,184 --> 01:06:09,114
I called one person's name, and yet two maidens have come up.

696
01:06:09,114 --> 01:06:13,194
Who among you two is the real Ye Hyeon Seon?

697
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:45,630

698
01:06:54,794 --> 01:06:56,804
♫  On this night, when even the moon is asleep  ♫

699
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:59,344
 The Forbidden Marriage
 Preview

700
01:06:59,344 --> 01:07:02,074
 I am standing here to reveal the truth.

701
01:07:02,074 --> 01:07:03,104
 You know, right?

702
01:07:03,104 --> 01:07:05,144
 My daughter is the real Hyeon Seon.

703
01:07:05,144 --> 01:07:08,484
 I am sorry. Please forgive this terrible father of yours.

704
01:07:08,484 --> 01:07:10,674
 Father...

705
01:07:10,674 --> 01:07:13,984
 Can I continue to call  you So Rang?

706
01:07:13,984 --> 01:07:16,464
 Congratulations, Your Majesty.

707
01:07:16,464 --> 01:07:20,814
 I am planning on making the newlywed bride a widow.

708
01:07:20,814 --> 01:07:23,004
 What are you thinking about so intently?

709
01:07:23,004 --> 01:07:25,834
 That we could just be happy now. Something like that...

710
01:07:25,834 --> 01:07:29,924
 The commotion from the other day feels as if it was all a dream.
