 This is a work of fiction. Characters, incidents, settings, titles, and content have no relevance to real life.

2
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,800
I will be staying at my home for the next two days.

3
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,900
I know.

4
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,490
Sin Won, are you there?

5
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,100
All right. Well, return safely.

6
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:18,170

7
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,000
Stop.

8
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,030
Come down, Lady.

9
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,500
Lady, my foot. I told you I was a beggar.

10
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,640
Thank you for bringing me home.

11
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,920
I will be going.

12
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,400
Let's go.

13
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:44,340
Does he know that I am Ye Hyeon Seon or not?

14
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,330
Why is he so nice to me?

15
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,000
 Ye Hyeon Seon died then.

16
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,270
What is wrong, So Rang?

17
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,167
You scared me!

18
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:55,020
Why have you not gone home and why are you still here?

19
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,270
Why are you out here and not sleeping?

20
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,110
I just...

21
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,450
had a bad dream.

22
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,080
Why? Did something happen?

23
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,360
No. It's just ...

24
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,980
Are you not scared?

25
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,090
About what?

26
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:31,130
It isn't easy to become suddenly an inner court lady and serve the king.

27
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,150
Afraid?

28
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,500
He is actually cuter than I thought.

29
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,500
You say he is cute?

30
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,280
I mean...

31
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,770
Didn't you see him hold onto my sleeve because he was scared of ghosts?

32
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,540
I thought I'd die because he was so cute.

33
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,690
I am more worried

34
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,510
that his majesty might get confused.

35
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,590
About what?

36
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,200
You are channeling the spirit of the dead crown princess, so ...

37
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,860
would he not perhaps start seeing you as her?

38
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,600
It is frightening to have confused feelings.

39
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,920
Why are you closing your eyes?

40
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,030
I am tired.

41
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,240
I should... well...

42
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,240
go inside to sleep.

43
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,900
If you get scared, come out. I will be here.

44
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,670
Forget it.

45
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,910
I am not going to run away,

46
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,770
so you should also go home and sleep.

47
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,190
The order from the king is a serious thing.

48
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,870
Let us not get any closer.

49
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,750
I cannot have my true identity revealed.

50
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,870
That's right.

51
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:57,080
What does it matter who you were in the past?

52
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,200
 Episode 3

53
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,030
 Ten days ago, at an inn in Yanghwajin,

54
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:14,310
 a man appeared saying that he had killed the crown princess.

55
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,360
 And so, we are currently tracking him down.

56
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,220
Is anyone home?

57
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,310
Innkeeper!

58
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,210
That is how they operate.

59
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:50,040
Eliminating all forms of corroborative evidence.

60
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,630
If so, then what shall we do?

61
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,230
What if even more murders are committed?

62
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,930
I have a plan.

63
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,630
You should demonstrate to everyone

64
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,320
that you are physically strong.

65
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,600
How about you lead the court on a hunt?

66
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,660
Go hunting?

67
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,750
After seven years?

68
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,840
Use this opportunity to strengthen your influence over allies to the royals

69
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,030
and also stop the terrible rumors on the streets.

70
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,360
You have to make unexpected moves like this

71
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,170
so that they get flustered and make mistakes.

72
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,400
And if that happens,

73
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,430
they may leave an unexpected trail.

74
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,680
A hunting expedition...

75
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,710
Yes, Crown Princess.

76
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,800
Well...

77
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,880
will you take a look at what I have caught?

78
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,740
Surprise!

79
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,240
Your Highness! Your Highness!

80
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,640
- Crown Princess! 
 - Court Lady Kim, carry her inside!

81
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,350
Your Highness!

82
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,190
You are so cruel and disgusting.

83
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,240
- Wait, the thing is...
 - I kept hearing

84
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,750
the blood-curdling shriek of the roe deer.

85
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,120
How could you enjoy killing something as part of a celebration?

86
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,290
It's not that I enjoy it—

87
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,780
Please think about it.

88
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:06,870
For that roe deer, whether it has a mother or a baby,

89
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,150
it would have a family.

90
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,600
I heard that you were training from time to time with Chief Lee Sin Won.

91
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,500
If you train just a bit more...

92
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,660
Y-Your Majesty.

93
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:29,370
Do you think my skills are rusty?

94
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,610
I will set up a schedule for it.

95
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,760
Will you be able to carry this? It's heavy.

96
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,710
Of course.

97
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,470
Come here.

98
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,590
Welcome.

99
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,850
Choose one. What is with your shoes?

100
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,400
Come on, why would a wanderer like me wear flower slippers?

101
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,200
Why are you a wanderer?

102
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,740
You opened a grand teahouse in Insagol,

103
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,680
and you're now working in the palace, although it is temporary.

104
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,840
I will return to my old life.

105
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,200
You will go back to your wanderer life?

106
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,690
Well, I'm not sure.

107
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:51,650
Where is the place where I belong?

108
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,060
I am sure I will cause some big trouble if I stay in the palace.

109
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,390
That is who I am.

110
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,880
I cannot afford to die because of that.

111
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,520
Once Her Highness, the crown princess, departs to the afterlife, I will leave.

112
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,080
Come on. I told you I do not need new slippers.

113
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,640
I will buy them at a thrift market if I need them later.

114
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,790
Why would you buy used shoes?

115
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,750
Sit down.

116
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,590
Try putting them on.

117
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,300
From now, instead of dangerous places,

118
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,000
eat in a warm place and sleep in a nice place.

119
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,960
Only wear flower slippers from now on.

120
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,080
You do not know that, right?

121
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,680
If you buy a woman shoes, she runs away.

122
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,070
He suddenly decided to go hunting?

123
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,570
Yes.

124
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,360
And on that trip...

125
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:45,180
Why is His Majesty trying to get some sun all of a sudden?

126
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:51,900
How should we prepare that road so that it shines?

127
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,210
I heard that you were preparing to go on a hunting expedition.

128
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,490
Royal Grandmother!

129
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,310
Will you be able to go and do well there?

130
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:37,470
You are still physically unwell, so I am a bit worried.

131
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,790
Your Majesty!

132
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,390
You have hit it right on the bullseye!

133
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:55,570
It is a pheasant the size of a house, Your Majesty!

134
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,780
A pheasant?

135
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,050
With skills like that, you will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with anyone!

136
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,320
You know...

137
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,970
that the physical prowess of the king is the strength of the nation.

138
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,140
So you can quickly end the Marriage Ban Edict,

139
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,360
and produce an heir who can inherit the throne!

140
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,180
There is nothing to worry about!

141
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:22,130
Go ahead and catch more pheasants. I will be going.

142
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,690
I caught a pheasant...

143
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,960
Tell the royal clinic to make an herb tonic to boost the king's stamina.

144
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,730
Yes, Your Highness.

145
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,860
- Since the king's body lacks heat, red ginseng would be good. 
 - Yes.

146
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,510
Instead of supporting young people in their prime to have a higher birth rate!

147
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,660
Instead of supporting us!

148
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,010
They put us in jail for just looking at women.

149
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,810
- I feel it's so unfair!
 - I also feel it to be unfair!

150
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,930
- Please, someone, find my daughter!
 - Oh, my...

151
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:54,160
When she woke up in the morning, her daughter had been kidnapped.

152
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,110
This is why people call it Hell Joseon!

153
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,240
Yes, Hell Joseon!

154
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,340
- Deok Hun, let us go and grab some drinks!
 - Let's do that!

155
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,900
I suppose you have got a lot of complaints about this nation.

156
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:12,820
Ayooo!

157
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,240
What in the world? A kidnapping?

158
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,420
How can you live with such fear?

159
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,840
If I am under the law, then I have to obey the law.

160
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:28,220
But if I am above the law, then the law obeys me.

161
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,010
How do I get above the law?

162
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,260
Power.

163
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,750
As a woman?

164
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,970
By entering the palace and becoming a lady of the royal family.

165
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,030
Is that possible?

166
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,500
Of course.

167
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,860
If you would only join our Women's Association.

168
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,450
 Information on How to Join Women's Association 
 A Women's Association?

169
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,650
 It is a meeting for mothers who want their daughters to become the queen.

170
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,680
 Rather than waiting seven years to marry off their daughters to some strange man,

171
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,120
 they are eyeing the highest position.

172
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,770
 Once the selection of the queen starts,

173
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,200
 any family that is not part of our Women's Association

174
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,170
will not even be able to submit a single character of their daughter's name.

175
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,050
We have already plotted and colluded in that manner.

176
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:10,450
But there is only one position for the queen.

177
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:15,020
Although the competition may be fierce, we can increase your chances.

178
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,950
Really?

179
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,080
Aigoo. The joining fee is so expensive...

180
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,550
As long as you join,

181
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:28,610
your daughter's name will be delivered

182
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:32,690
directly to the head lady of the inner court.

183
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,120
She does not compare to my Hyeon Hui either.

184
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,370
Oh, my. Who is this?

185
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,960
Are you not Wun Jeong, who ran away from Gaegyeong?

186
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,860
What do you mean by a runaway courtesan?

187
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,660
You have got the wrong person.

188
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,570
I have never mentioned you being a courtesan.

189
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:55,390
It is a bit upsetting that you would pretend not to know me.

190
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,970
I did hear the news.

191
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,890
I heard that you were taken as a concubine of the Minister of Personnel Affairs

192
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,340
and you are now acting as his legal wife.

193
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,950
What in the world...

194
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:07,030
You do give off a madam feel, seeing you like this now.

195
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,360
I told you I am not her.

196
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,940
Oh, I heard you have one daughter.

197
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,790
What are you going to do? Even after the Marriage Ban Edict ends,

198
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:18,290
your daughter will become a concubine since that is your background.

199
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:33,460
Did I not tell you that I do not know anyone like that?

200
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,200
It appears you are headed to Hanyang for the first time in a while.

201
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,680
Then you should just quietly enjoy yourself.

202
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,770
Why are you sticking your nose in someone else's affairs?

203
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:48,580
I heard that the noses of people like that are cut off while asleep

204
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,950
and are sliced into sashimi,

205
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,740
and thin pieces in Hanyang.

206
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,090
Eonni!

207
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,840
You have to be careful wherever you go, all right?

208
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,940
Why all of a sudden?

209
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,120
Another young lady from a village south of us got kidnapped!

210
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,400
Isn't it the guy who had a crush on her who kidnapped her to live with her?

211
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,520
Everyone thought that and assumed she might have gotten married somewhere,

212
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,850
but one of the ladies who got kidnapped was found as a corpse in the ocean.

213
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,510
Oh, my...

214
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,530
Chief, what are you doing as the cane of the people,*
  (In Korea, that phrase is used for police, to mean they support the people)

215
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,440
not arresting people like that?

216
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,770
I know, right?

217
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,840
We have been investigating that at the Royal Investigation Bureau for several years already.

218
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,710
Then why are you not able to catch him yet?

219
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,740
How can we go around being so afraid like this?

220
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:35,000
It's too dangerous! For a beauty like me.

221
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,120
Will you be able to escape your fate by doing that?

222
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,260
Gosh, he scared me.

223
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,180
What is wrong with him? Is he Mi Chi Gwaeng Yi* today?
  (Sounds like "crazy person" in Korean)

224
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,260
Oh, so cold! It is so cold!

225
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,980
Watch out for the water!

226
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,790
My forehead!

227
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,090
Watch out for the trees!

228
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,530
Come on, Old Man. If you have a channeling ability,

229
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:58,940
do some prophesying instead of saying things that people already know.

230
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,540
- That scared me...
 - Constantly watch out for water...

231
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,420
and watch out for trees, you got that?

232
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,240
Why is this old man doing this to him?

233
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,000
Please be understanding. Our grandpa is a bit ill.

234
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,400
Beware of trees and beware of water.

235
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,130
And you, beware of men.

236
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,070
Ah, this is exhausting.

237
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,860
When is So Rang coming?

238
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,500
Your Majesty!

239
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,690
Were you looking for me?

240
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,150
What? How did you appear so suddenly?

241
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,230
I was told to go to my station as soon as I entered the palace,

242
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,510
so I came straight here.

243
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:27,010
I do not know who set the schedule like that, but...

244
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,000
Your Majesty, were you perhaps waiting for me?

245
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,430
M-M-Me? Why would I?

246
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,810
Well, I mean...

247
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:43,090
I was wondering if you might have been bored entertaining yourself.

248
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,250
Oh! Yes.

249
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,600
Well, I was looking for you to ask what tomorrow's weather will be like.

250
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,250
It will be an important day tomorrow, so will it rain or be clear?

251
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,690
Tomorrow's weather...

252
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,770
Well...

253
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,480
Do not worry!

254
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,940
Tomorrow's weather will be as bright as my face!

255
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,910
I guess you do have some channeling ability.

256
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,980
Of course!

257
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,860
It is pretty obvious that this is just a passing shower.

258
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,420
- Oh, my!
 - This much rain is nothing.

259
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,340
We should enter the palace quickly.

260
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,670
Your Majesty, the palace...

261
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,700
Aigoo, Your Majesty.

262
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,210
Aigoo, what to do!

263
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,190
- It is over there!
 - So Rang, are you here?

264
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,260
Is it the water ghost again?

265
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,810
Please just wait here for a moment.

266
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:19,030
I will go beat up that ghost and come back.

267
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,720
Beat up?

268
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,590
One moment.

269
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,100
What is this?

270
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,110
Who put this here?

271
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,170
Wait...

272
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,320
What is this?

273
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,770
Just do this, and it works?

274
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,440
Wait.

275
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,030
Oh, it is so easy!

276
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,570
Your Majesty!

277
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,750
I have done it!

278
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,690
I-I-It's a ghost!

279
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:49,970
No, it is me, So Rang!

280
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:01,000
 This for sure is high treason.

281
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,600
 Save me...please.

282
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,450
 Ye Hyeon Seon! Ye Hyeon Seon! Ye Hyeon Seon!

283
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,240
So Rang.

284
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,490
So Rang, are you all right?

285
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:30,700
Yes. I'm all right.

286
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,570
But by chance...

287
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,640
 Was I the only one to survive?

288
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,140
Sin Won, did we not forget something?

289
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:54,250
Your Majesty!

290
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,660
Your Majesty!

291
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,970
Your Majesty!

292
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,390
Your Majesty!

293
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,700
Your Majesty!

294
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,170
Your Majesty.

295
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:06,140
Your Majesty...

296
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,390
I have committed a sin deserving of death, Your Majesty!

297
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:14,210
It is all right. It is all right.

298
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,930
You don't seem to be all right...

299
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,030
I told you I am fine.

300
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,660
But how did you manage to survive?

301
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,540
Kill me, Your Majesty!

302
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,420
Sin Won.

303
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,700
Come over here.

304
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,000
- You...
 - Yes?

305
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,790
- Do you want to die?
 - Pardon?

306
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,750
How could you save that girl before me!

307
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,310
After all those years that we have been together as friends!

308
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,010
Your Majesty, let us go inside the palace quickly!

309
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,690
You are going to catch a cold like this...

310
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:01,000
- How could you...
 - Your Majesty, let us first go inside...

311
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,200
Aigoo... let us go in.

312
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,850
Your Majesty...

313
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:51,780
I will help you get changed.

314
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,440
Who would that benefit? Why would I ask you?

315
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,810
 Our king doesn't easily forget wrongs done against him ...

316
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:58,870
 What do I do?

317
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,550
I seem to remember you said I lack sexual allure?

318
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:04,060
Is that why you embraced Sin Won like that?

319
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,700
 You see? Look, look.

320
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,050
 How am I going to get out of this?

321
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,210
Your Majesty,

322
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:15,280
I will wipe off the water from your face.

323
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,130
No. It is fine.

324
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,330
I will do it myself. Give it to me.

325
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:22,910
No, I cannot.

326
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,500
Please, let me at least wipe off the water from your face.

327
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,040
I told you to give it to me.

328
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,950
- I told you, give it to me.
 - No, I cannot!

329
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,730
- Aigoo, you got so wet...
 - I told you to go away...

330
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,610
I-I am fine.

331
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:45,760
Aigoo. I will help you get changed.

332
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,810
I told you you cannot.

333
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,880
Can't I?

334
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:08,720
Aigoo. You must have been so cold.

335
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,740
All right.

336
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,160
I suppose...

337
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,930
something must have been terribly wrong with my eyes last time.

338
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:26,280
Did I say that Chief Lee Sin Won had a good body?

339
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,300
How could I have said such nonsense?

340
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,500
I mean, seeing your body up close... wow...

341
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,650
It is a work of art!

342
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:37,040
Oh, my! It is so hard. Is it made of stone?

343
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,190
Oh, my! Goodness!

344
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,560
Do you realize that only now?

345
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,140
When I look at you, Your Majesty,

346
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,580
it is like seeing a blue dragon rising into the sky,

347
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:50,280
exuding his energy and dignity to the whole world.

348
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,680
Honestly, I was extremely impressed today.

349
00:30:54,680 --> 00:31:00,580
The way you were wielding your sword, it was in perfect form.

350
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:04,970
I thought the god of war came down and was dancing in the moonlight.

351
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:08,670
Well, that- Wait, wait! Not there, not there!

352
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,170
I will do that area myself.

353
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,950
What is the matter?

354
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,390
I-I will put on my pants myself.

355
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:16,140
I will... I will put them on myself.

356
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,250
You go and turn around.

357
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,960
I will help you with that as well.

358
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,700
Just cover yourself with this and wait over there.

359
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,700
Yes.

360
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,360
 Hey, hey! Do not dare turn around!

361
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,230
Your Majesty.

362
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,780
Then,

363
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:49,190
will you forgive me for what happened today?

364
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:52,020
The butting of foreheads

365
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,990
and the splash, splash?

366
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:58,230
Do you think I will be able to forgive you?

367
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:05,450
I found out who was making that sound!

368
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,380
Who was it?

369
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,660
There was a maiden ghost bound to this world,

370
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:15,130
and she was crazy determined to try to seduce the king.

371
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,810
But who am I?

372
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,260
I am So Rang, who beats up ghosts!

373
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,340
With my amazing channeling ability, I shouted at her, "You wicked girl!

374
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,240
Where do you think this is that you are making ghost sounds here!"

375
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,760
Wham, bam! I beat her up and got rid of her.

376
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,160
- Really?
 - Listen.

377
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,700
You do not hear such noises anymore.

378
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:44,880
Since I managed to accomplish such a great feat,

379
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,740
shouldn't I be at least getting an honorary drink from the king?

380
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,630
But since I have a history of sin against you,

381
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:56,790
how about you just call it even?

382
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,200
- Call it even?
 - That's right.

383
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,760
Call it even.

384
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:06,020
 How do I get him to fall asleep tonight?

385
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,730
 If I have to be the one talking, my mouth will hurt.

386
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,680
 So I should get him to talk.

387
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,990
Your Majesty.

388
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:23,890
Do you think of anything when you look at the round moon?

389
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:25,340
The moon?

390
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,340
No.

391
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:39,320
What about any fun stories regarding alcohol?

392
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,800
 Surprise!

393
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,140
I have none of that as well.

394
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:56,140
You said you could not forget her,

395
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:00,890
but it appears you have been able to forget everything about the moon and alcohol.

396
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,560
Guilt, longing, and regret...

397
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,390
Which of the three

398
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,580
is responsible for

399
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,460
why you cannot promise to forget her?

400
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,760
Why is unfinished love not one of the choices?

401
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:27,380
Why did I not understand her more

402
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,130
and acknowledge her more, then?

403
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:34,240
It must have been hard for her to live in a palace so unfamiliar to her.

404
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,110
Then...

405
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,400
it is closer to regret, I see.

406
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:42,380
But do you know this?

407
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,340
A person who looks back on his past with regret

408
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:50,870
is still committing acts that he will regret later.

409
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:58,250
The way you are acting right now

410
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,170
is hurting others.

411
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:04,120
Who do you mean by others?

412
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,300
Your people.

413
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,920
I, too,

414
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:23,730
am one of your people.

415
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,400
W-What is this?

416
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,800
Huh?

417
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:26,050
A-Are you sleeping with your eyes open?

418
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,640
Whoa, this...

419
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,550
Wow...

420
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,900
Hey. Hey.

421
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,770
Hey. Hey, hey!

422
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:32,730
 She won't remember that I kissed her, right?

423
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:36,580
Of course, it was just a mistake. A mistake.

424
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,240
No need to have my heart flutter over this matter.

425
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,620
♫  On this night, where even the moon is asleep  ♫

426
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,050
What? What is going on?

427
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:52,200
Whoa, hey, hey. Stay still, my heart.

428
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,850
Stay still, I say.

429
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:55,400
This...

430
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,230
♫  A night where you're headed on a long journey  ♫

431
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:02,340
♫  Without even a word  ♫

432
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,640
 She won't remember that I kissed her, right?

433
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:17,220
♫  How can I forget you?  ♫

434
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:24,690
♫  You torment me by coming to me every night in my dream  ♫

435
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:30,460
♫  So how can you tell me to forget?  ♫

436
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:52,120
Shall I set it up again?

437
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:56,740
If it has already been found,

438
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,080
we should completely destroy the remains.

439
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,660
By the way,

440
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,480
do you perhaps know who came across this?

441
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,040
I heard an inner court  lady discovered it.

442
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,780
Look into who that inner court lady is.

443
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,130
How are the preparations for the hunt going?

444
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:20,380
Do not worry about that.

445
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,030
Tomorrow's weather

446
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:37,010
will be as bright as my face!

447
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:45,360
What is So Rang's schedule today?

448
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,710
It is her day off.

449
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:50,180
Perhaps because she fell in the water yesterday,

450
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:53,200
she seems to have some flu symptoms.

451
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,400
I see.

452
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,790
Today, I will be assisted by other inner court ladies,

453
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,860
so tell her to get plenty of rest in her quarters.

454
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,260
- This is ridiculous.
 - Seriously?

455
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,370
Is he crazy?

456
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:15,430
What good has he done that he sets up a royal procession just for a simple hunting trip?

457
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,560
It really makes my blood boil.

458
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,520
I should have found a husband sooner.

459
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,310
I want a husband, too...

460
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:27,770
I would like to get a good look at the king's face today.

461
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:31,870
What does he look like that he's stopping perfectly able-bodied men like us from getting married?

462
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:34,370
Come on! You should refer to it as "yongahn"!*
  (A formal word that means "king's face")

463
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:37,160
His majesty's crazy face.

464
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:42,610
Look here. Even if we get dragged away, we must say what is on our mind today.

465
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,730
Get lost, you crazy king!

466
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:47,960
Get lost!

467
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,630
We have more than enough energy left in us!

468
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:53,520
- We are going absolutely crazy here!
 - Going crazy!

469
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,630
Here comes his majesty!

470
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:06,210
He doesn't look crazy...

471
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:08,130
Crazy, yes, that's for sure...

472
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:09,970
but more like he's got crazy good looks...

473
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:12,540
Starting today, I'm going to strive to become the queen.

474
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:16,210
His elegance is extremely luxurious.

475
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:20,070
With such good looks, why is he not taking a queen?

476
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:31,430
If I knew this would happen, I should have revealed my face much sooner.

477
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:08,180
Have all the preparations been completed, Sin Won?

478
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,180
Who are you?

479
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:22,400
It is me, Your Majesty.

480
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,720
What are you, of all people, doing here?

481
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:30,380
 Take me with you.

482
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,900
 That is not somewhere you should be. You have a fever.

483
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,800
 Just take me with you, please? I heard that hunting is really fun.

484
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,010
 Why are you leaving me behind?

485
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,910
 Do you think working as an inner court lady is all fun and games?

486
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:43,250
 I heard today is your day off, too.

487
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,130
 I can change it! I can change it!

488
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:47,980
 Just take me with you, please? Please, Sin Won.

489
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:51,380
So you brought her here in disguise?

490
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,050
She is extremely stubborn.

491
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:57,700
It's not like you're some princess, nor are you a favored royal concubine.

492
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,450
You are merely a inner court lady.

493
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:01,070
How dare you throw a tantrum?

494
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:03,300
Your Majesty, I'm the exorcist.

495
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,790
Why do you think I got worried and followed you all the way here?

496
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:09,640
Ever since you had heard some strange noise at the pond by yourself,

497
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,820
do you not feel anything strange?

498
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:16,520
As if an apparition may be following you around...

499
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,780
- No.
 - No?

500
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:23,530
Even now! It just swept right past you just now! Like that!

501
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:26,810
The palace is on a site which by it's nature has good energy.

502
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:29,500
which prevents the spirits from harming you there,

503
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,510
but this place is an evil graveyard.

504
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:35,850
What will you do if the evil spirits cling to you while you are out here?

505
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:38,350
However, do not worry, Your Majesty.

506
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:40,700
This So Rang is here to save the day.

507
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:44,210
I will protect you, Your Majesty.

508
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,240
I think you'll be the biggest nuisance in my opinion.

509
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,490
Sin Won,

510
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:04,290
when the hunting is over, I heard there would be a meat feast. Is that right?

511
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:07,590
Did you perhaps come all the way here because of the meat?

512
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,220
Were you not fed enough meat?

513
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,030
Why come on a hunting trip just to eat some meat?

514
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:15,630
You ... are you bringing up my weakness right now?

515
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:17,530
Are you looking down on me because I used to be a beggar?

516
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:19,740
No, it's not that...

517
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,270
If you were a true nobleman,

518
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,950
you should not bring up someone's weakness like that.

519
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:30,570
A-All right, all right.

520
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:33,620
I'll be sure to save you your portion at the feast later.

521
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,960
Really?

522
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,430
- Yes.
 - Do your best while hunting, all right?

523
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:40,360
Bring back a lot of meat, all right?

524
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:51,630
All those cute rabbits look like food to you, huh?

525
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:53,610
Too small.

526
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:55,270
Something bigger.

527
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:58,670
They look big enough to me.

528
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:13,120
 Will you take a look at what I have caught?

529
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,930
 Surprise!

530
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:20,140
 - Crown Princess!
 - Your Highness!

531
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:23,750
Your Majesty, Your Majesty! This is not the time to mull over rabbits!

532
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:26,230
You see over there? Look at the deer over there, that deer!

533
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:27,780
Seriously, you're disturbing my focus...

534
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,370
If you are unable, forget it, then.

535
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:33,660
- Chief, you can catch that deer, right?
 - No, I will catch it.

536
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,200
Oh no!

537
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,690
Oh, my goodness, you take forever!

538
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:51,230
It looked so delicious, too.

539
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:57,090
- Your Majesty, you said you would do your best.
 - Yes, I did say that.

540
00:47:57,090 --> 00:48:00,240
Your Majesty! Look! It's a wild chicken!

541
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:02,910
Bang! Bang! Bang!

542
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:04,190
What in the world is she doing?

543
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:07,460
- Whoa, look at that raccoon!
 - H-Hey! Get out of the way. Move.

544
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:09,340
Hey, chicken leg! Where did you go? Can't I eat you?

545
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:11,530
Bang! Bang! Bang! Shoot that thing!

546
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:13,150
Bang!

547
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:18,750
- Look, a raccoon!
 - Aaah, you scared me.

548
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,830
You can't even shoot that?

549
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:26,020
It is all right, Your Majesty. Please try again.

550
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,000
Why you... You don't even know how to shoot an arrow!

551
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,250
If we continue this reckless shooting, we will draw the anger of the wild animals here!

552
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:35,200
Your Majesty, is that what you are worried about?

553
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,690
As for anger, the resentment of the young people of this country

554
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:40,530
who are unable to get married must be far greater.

555
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:44,310
Compared to that, such anger from wild animals doesn't even compare...

556
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:47,710
My word, that little...

557
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:50,940
T-that... W-What should I do with her, huh?

558
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,580
It is my fault for bringing her.

559
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,550
Sin Won, if you ever save her first again, like last time—

560
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:57,810
That will not happen again, Your Majesty.

561
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:00,670
If that happens, you will get hurt. You understand?

562
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,790
Bang, bang, bang? Please!

563
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:08,140
- Goodness gracious.
 - Are you all right, Your Majesty?

564
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:10,610
- Bang, Bang, Bang!
 - Your Majesty!

565
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:13,420
Please, preserve your dignity!

566
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,100
- Hey, Oh Deok Hun!
♫   - What's happening?  ♫

567
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:35,040
♫  Did you find the wild boar that will end this edict against marriage?  ♫

568
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,720
♫  - Yes, I did!
 - And what did you do with it?  ♫

569
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,340
♫  I'm planning to set up a royal ancestral rite to end that edict, of course.  ♫

570
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:42,100
♫  Good job, good job.  ♫

571
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,910
♫  Good job, good job, such a good job!  ♫

572
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:47,570
 I suppose you have got a lot of complaints about this nation.

573
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:51,280
 There is indeed one way to end this Marriage Ban Edict.

574
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,550
 We must set up a royal ancestral rite

575
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:56,410
 using a special creature that is enough to end this edict.

576
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,410
 Special creature?

577
00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:01,220
 For example, a beast caught by the king himself.

578
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:04,240
 Since the king has set off on a hunting trip this time around,

579
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,730
 it would be nice if he caught a wild boar.

580
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:11,000
 So, if we sacrifice that creature for the rite, are you saying the marriage ban will end once and for all?

581
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:17,020
 It will not be that easy...

582
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,820
 for there are no boars at the training site.

583
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,310
 Darn it!

584
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:25,520
 Damn it!

585
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,170
 How will he even catch a boar that's not even at the training site and use it for the rite?

586
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,190
 Wang Bae! Wang Bae!

587
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:37,730
 If there are no wild boars, perhaps we should release one there.

588
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,820
 Oh Deok Hun!

589
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,930
 Oh, my!

590
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,270
 As long as the king catches this boar and uses it as a sacrifice,

591
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:02,250
 &gt;we can finally end this annoying Marriage Ban Edict.

592
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:04,750
 This is patriotism, is it not?

593
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:08,480
 Does that mean we can finally get married?

594
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:11,870
 Of course!

595
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:15,330
 Deok Hun, go ahead.

596
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:17,260
 Me?

597
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:27,020
 Just wondering, but...

598
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,500
 even if the Marriage Ban comes to an end,

599
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,070
 we won't, by chance, remain Sul Ro*, will we?
 (=single)

600
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:32,450
 What are you talking about!

601
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:34,300
Once the ban ends, we will also certainly!

602
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,860
 - Certainly?
 - Find a lover.

603
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:36,870
 Thank goodness!

604
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:39,000
 Our being single is wholly the fault of this nation!

605
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,590
 - Indeed!
 - We will find someone!

606
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,650
What is that?

607
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:53,900
Huh?

608
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:22,610
Your Majesty, this hunting thing is so much fun!

609
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,910
That way. Let's go that way, too.

610
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:32,020
Upon my word, she has such a belligerent personality.

611
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:36,020
Are you exhausted already? Come quick!

612
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:38,710
Whoa, look! That looks like it'll feed a hundred people!

613
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:41,120
There she goes again.

614
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:45,810
But Your Majesty, are there actually wild boars here?

615
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:47,940
No, these grounds were man-made for hunting purposes.

616
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,640
It is not the real wilderness we are in.

617
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,880
You're right. But...

618
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:57,980
There is no way there is such a thing. No way...

619
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:02,680
Actually, there is.

620
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,430
So Rang!

621
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:37,020
 Is this how I die?

622
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:42,480
Mother?

623
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:51,100
Mother, am I dead?

624
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:59,170
Mo-Mother?

625
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,290
She's alive. She's alive. She's alive.

626
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,250
She's alive.

627
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,100
Ouch, my head.

628
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,910
Geez.

629
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:20,970
Are you all right?

630
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,940
Ouch, my head... Oh my goodness!

631
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,870
You caught it?

632
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:34,120
 I finally caught it.

633
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,280
 I hunted it down.

634
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,550
 She fell in the water yesterday, so today...

635
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:41,340
 she should beware of trees?

636
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:46,370
Supposedly, you're a fortune teller. How can you not see your own future?

637
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:47,800
Because of my concern for you, Your Majesty,

638
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:52,960
I threw myself in front of this crazy boar. Do you truly not see my loyalty to you?

639
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,380
This girl...

640
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,600
So...

641
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,880
when did the two of you drop using honorifics?

642
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:06,920
That's...

643
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:12,810
Your Majesty!

644
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,070
Whoa...

645
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:16,670
- Your Majesty!
 - Your Majesty!

646
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:18,680
Your Majesty!

647
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,310
Come, come, come. Whoa...

648
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:23,210
What is this... Wow...

649
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:26,690
Did you catch this huge boar, Your Majesty?

650
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:30,870
At the upcoming royal ancestral rite, this boar that the king has caught himself

651
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:34,090
will be the perfect sacrifice!

652
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:36,910
That will not be so.

653
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:40,260
This boar I caught today

654
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:43,320
will be eaten at tonight's feast.

655
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:47,830
Your Majesty's grace knows no bounds.

656
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:50,730
Your Majesty's grace knows no bounds.

657
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:53,780
Your Majesty's grace knows no bounds.

658
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:57,740
Tonight's feast!

659
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:59,590
Eat yourself to death, will you?

660
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,950
Are you all right?

661
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:10,460
What my old man said

662
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:13,850
about being careful about water and tree must've been about this.

663
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:20,040
This is the first time I've ever run into a wild boar.

664
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,540
I'm sure it was a first for the boar as well.

665
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:24,400
- Right?
 - Yes.

666
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:41,720
That crazy drunken court lady?

667
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:47,720
He brought her here, even dressing her up as a man?

668
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:53,730
- Look at this!
 - Wait, that... T-That...

669
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:56,470
- They're supposed to use that during the rite...
 - It can't be.

670
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:59,250
At this rate, how can we end this marriage ban?

671
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,340
This can't be.

672
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:03,400
- To end the marriage ban, we need more power. 
 - You're right.

673
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,600
To show the power of us, Born Sul Ro, two people aren't enough.

674
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,380
So, if two people are not enough,

675
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,780
- let's gather more people?
 - Of course!

676
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:13,500
- There are Sul Ro people all over the streets. 
 - Right!

677
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,400
We must teach them a lesson at some point so they will fear us Sul Ro people.

678
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,410
So they will fear us, yes!

679
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:20,070
So-called "Born Sul Ro Group."

680
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:23,170
Let us unite and show them the great power of Sul Ro people!

681
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:25,250
Wow, the Born Sul Ro Group!

682
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:27,760
That is such a great idea!

683
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,010
But for now...

684
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:34,010
For now, let's run.

685
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:38,590
Didn't it seem that the man from last time was here?

686
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:41,410
The man who said a hunt would take place here?

687
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:22,850
Have you set aside a portion of the meat for the court ladies?

688
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:26,120
Is it because of So Rang, Your Majesty?

689
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,880
Do not worry, Your Majesty. I am sure she is eating somewhere.

690
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,720
She is no ordinary girl, as you know.

691
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,660
Yes. That is true.

692
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,940
Your Majesty...

693
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,180
Your Majesty!

694
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:43,520
When the time is right,

695
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:48,380
why don't you propose a toast to the ministers first?

696
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:50,110
So be it, then.

697
00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:56,850
As you all have enjoyed today's hunting trip,

698
00:58:56,850 --> 00:58:59,880
it brings great joy to my heart.

699
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:02,370
Come now,

700
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:06,470
raise your glasses.

701
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:29,970
His Majesty seems to be in a good mood today.

702
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:31,650
Usually, during the banquet

703
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:33,970
he would always have this sour face on,

704
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:36,520
as if he were taunting us by saying,

705
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,070
"Let me see how much you eat and play while the crown princess is gone!"

706
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:41,100
Now that much time has passed,

707
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,850
the foul and sharp temper of the king

708
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:46,720
resembling a sword and nail seems to have dampened.

709
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:50,340
Now, all we need is someone to fill the place of the queen.

710
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:52,210
What did you say?

711
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:54,620
I cannot hear you well.

712
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:58,870
What I said is that I wish there was someone to take up the role in the queen's palace.

713
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:00,140
What?

714
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:01,590
What I said is!

715
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:06,940
I wish someone with a longer lifeline would take the deceased crown princess' place!

716
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:50,500
What did you just say?

717
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,320
Th-That is... His hearing...

718
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,140
Wh-What did I just say again...

719
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:59,070
Your Majesty! I have committed a sin deserving of death!

720
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:17,480
I shall take your words as a blessing for me to take a lovely queen.

721
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:19,810
Here,

722
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:22,110
take a glass.

723
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:28,280
Your Majesty, your grace knows no bounds!

724
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:36,500
Come now, enjoy the rest of the night.

725
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,540
Where have you been?

726
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,960
I've been looking for you for a while now.

727
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:58,610
I was cleaning up in here, Your Majesty.

728
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:02,640
You were practically singing about meat earlier.

729
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,090
Have you eaten dinner?

730
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:06,950
No, not yet.

731
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:11,960
Are you saying you didn't have any meat yet?

732
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:15,030
Who... who are you?

733
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:17,570
You... You aren't So Rang, are you?

734
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:23,170
Are you channeling the spirit again?

735
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:25,420
You've been possessed again, So Rang!

736
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:27,680
Are you channeling the spirit?

737
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,160
Did you have some strange medication, by chance?

738
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,190
- What...
 - I...

739
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:44,270
I was unable to take any medication today.

740
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:46,720
You...

741
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:54,960
You have a fever.

742
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:01,030
Head Eunuch!

743
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:04,990
Yes, Your Majesty.

744
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:06,710
Go and call the royal physician.

745
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:07,940
It is an urgent matter.

746
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:11,150
Rumors may ensue if you call the royal physician to treat a mere court lady.

747
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:13,870
In which case, all attention in the palace will be turned toward So Rang.

748
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:16,600
Why don't we summon a local doctor from a nearby town instead, Your Majesty?

749
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:17,950
Yes.

750
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:19,740
Let us do that, then.

751
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:22,640
 Crown Princess. Crown Princess, are you all right?

752
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,400
 Your Royal Highness the Crown Prince, this is our job.

753
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,550
 Still, my wife has fainted. How can I just sit and do nothing as her husband?

754
01:03:28,550 --> 01:03:31,760
 - Crown Princess!
 - We will be sure to take care of her.

755
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,840
 But, still! I am her husband.

756
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:37,140
 Crown Princess, are you all right?

757
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:44,870
Your Majesty, I will now move So Rang to the inner court ladies' quarters.

758
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:45,830
Leave her be.

759
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:50,240
Even in a near-death situation, it is important to rest in the right place, Your Majesty.

760
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,050
I will...

761
01:03:53,550 --> 01:03:55,430
personally nurse her.

762
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:57,300
Pardon?

763
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,550
- But, Your Majesty...
 - I said leave her be.

764
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:03,630
Go and bring me some cold water and towels.

765
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:13,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

766
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,160
Let's get off.

767
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:29,710
Your Majesty!

768
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:36,430
To be in the presence of His Majesty the King is an honor unto my family!

769
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:37,890
What...

770
01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:40,030
What sickness takes over you?

771
01:04:40,030 --> 01:04:42,930
You will not be examining me.

772
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:44,980
It is this court lady here.

773
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,510
What? Aigoo...

774
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:51,070
Is it right for a court lady to lie down here like this?

775
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:11,120
Whoa, hey!

776
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:15,860
Where do you dare touch...

777
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,490
There is something I learned from a Western physician.

778
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:23,450
I was simply trying to listen to the sounds of her chest.

779
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:31,260
In a country where men and women must be separate, this type of medical examination does not seem reasonable.

780
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:35,050
Are you not aware that all the court ladies are the king's women?

781
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:36,120
That is true.

782
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:39,430
I am simply trying to listen to the sound of the solar plexus.

783
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:44,300
Why do you exaggerate and overthink this?

784
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,950
It looks to be a bad case of the flu.

785
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:15,650
Following some sort of stressful event or shock, the flu hits like this in the aftermath at times.

786
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:20,720
It is important that she takes her medication regularly with each meal.

787
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:27,810
Very well.

788
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:32,020
Thank you for the trouble of coming all the way here in the middle of the night.

789
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:35,080
I will reward you properly for your work.

790
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,870
Take note of it.

791
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:43,110
Aigoo! Your Majesty's grace knows no bounds!

792
01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:48,310
Your Majesty, I will do it.

793
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:55,680
Sin Won, you may go ahead and leave now.

794
01:06:56,450 --> 01:06:59,230
- What?
 - I said you may leave.

795
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,450
You look so calm when you sleep.

796
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:42,060
Where do you get such an audacious temper?

797
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:46,540
And with this forehead,

798
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:52,020
why do you always crash into things all over the place?

799
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:05,280
 I am not sure why I feel so bad toward the crown princess for being like this.

800
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:23,320
Do you... plan to kiss me again?

801
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:37,510
Why... did you kiss me then?

802
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:50,210
 What's going on?

803
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:59,540
 I wonder whom His Majesty sees me as right now...

804
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:11,550
 He sees me as the crown princess...

805
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:15,480
I was half-asleep at the time.

806
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,470
If half-asleep,

807
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:21,010
is it all right to kiss, then?

808
01:09:28,450 --> 01:09:37,210

809
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:44,080
♫  On this night, where even the moon is asleep  ♫

810
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:51,810
♫  Where are you headed in such a rush?  ♫

811
01:09:53,290 --> 01:10:00,670
♫  A night where you're headed on a long journey Without even a word  ♫

812
01:10:00,670 --> 01:10:06,770

 The Forbidden Marriage 
 Preview

815
01:10:14,950 --> 01:10:17,950
 I've come after hearing the rumors.

816
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:20,720
 Whoever has this book has the upper hand.

817
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,590
 I offer this work to you, Your Majesty.

818
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:26,960
 You are not someone who is easily shaken by such things, Your Majesty.

819
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,130
 Who is Sin Won to you?

820
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:32,390
 Though there is a difference between age and status, we have decided to be friends.

821
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:33,640
 What are they doing?

822
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:37,940
 I have seen loving affection reflected in the eyes of the king when he looks upon So Rang.

823
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:40,710
 Let us set up a royal conjugal night for them.

824
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:42,940
 What exactly are you plotting?

825
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:46,370
 So Rang, let's run away.

826
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:53,340
