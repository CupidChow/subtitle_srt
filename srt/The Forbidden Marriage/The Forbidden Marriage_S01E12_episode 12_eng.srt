 This is a work of fiction. Characters, incidents, settings, titles, and content have no relevance to real life.

2
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,164
 Put your life on the line, you say?

3
00:00:44,164 --> 00:00:47,314
 And even by risking your life,

4
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:50,424
 what is the truth you hope to reveal?

5
00:00:50,424 --> 00:00:52,494
 That is...

6
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,694
 my true name.

7
00:00:55,694 --> 00:00:59,484
The new queen is...

8
00:00:59,484 --> 00:01:02,254
Ye Hyeon Seon.

9
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,954
The maiden who has been selected, please come up.

10
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,284
What are you doing? How dare you come up here...

11
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,894
Why? Your name is Hyeon Hui.

12
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,754
Oh, isn't that...Isn't that Eonni So Rang?

13
00:02:05,754 --> 00:02:07,454
Isn't she the owner of Aedaldang?

14
00:02:07,454 --> 00:02:10,864
Aigoo. Aigoo, you're right! Maiden So Rang!

15
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,224
Right, it's her!

16
00:02:12,224 --> 00:02:17,924
 Final Episode  
I called one person's name, but two people have come up.

17
00:02:17,924 --> 00:02:20,944
Who between you two is the real Ye Hyeon Seon?

18
00:02:20,944 --> 00:02:25,934
 Tell me clearly. Are you saying that you will withdraw from this?

19
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:32,324
 Yes, that is what I intend. It is because Ye Hyun Seon is not lacking in any way

20
00:02:32,324 --> 00:02:35,384
 in receiving the love of his majesty, the mighty king.

21
00:02:35,384 --> 00:02:39,904
 Also, more than anyone else, her feelings toward the king are sincere, loving, caring...

22
00:02:39,904 --> 00:02:42,174
 and wholly devoted.

23
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,894
 Up until now, the queen selection was completely decided by the elders of the royal family.

24
00:02:46,894 --> 00:02:50,274
 An arranged marriage that lacks love was accepted as normal.

25
00:02:50,274 --> 00:02:55,624
 However, how could there be happiness in a marriage that lacks love?

26
00:02:55,624 --> 00:02:59,814
 For his majesty to marry the one he truly loves and establish peace within the royal family

27
00:02:59,814 --> 00:03:01,784
 is for the benefit of his people.

28
00:03:01,784 --> 00:03:04,224
  Queen Dowager, may your generous heart

29
00:03:04,224 --> 00:03:08,084
 consider the sincere feelings between the two people

30
00:03:08,084 --> 00:03:11,054
 as the top priority in making your selection.

31
00:03:11,054 --> 00:03:13,754
 As such, the one who should be by the king's side...

32
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,394
 must be the real Ye Hyeon Seon.

33
00:03:18,394 --> 00:03:22,804
It is I...I am the true Ye Hyeon Seon.

34
00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:25,504
N-No. It is not so. It is me.

35
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:30,334
My name and identity were both stolen by wicked people involved in the queen selection.

36
00:03:30,334 --> 00:03:33,494
I am thus standing here to reveal the truth.

37
00:03:33,494 --> 00:03:35,564
She is an insane girl!

38
00:03:35,564 --> 00:03:39,314
I am the one who passed all three rounds of the queen selection.

39
00:03:39,314 --> 00:03:42,674
Her real name is Hyeon Hui.

40
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:47,504
She is born of Lady Seo, the concubine taken by my father.

41
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,614
Lord, why are you just standing here?

42
00:03:52,614 --> 00:03:54,264
H-Hyeon Seon...

43
00:03:54,264 --> 00:03:59,204
Did you not say she eloped with a male servant? How is she there...?

44
00:03:59,204 --> 00:04:01,924
Upon hearing our daughter passed all three queen selection rounds,

45
00:04:01,924 --> 00:04:05,724
she appeared suddenly, looking for a chance to be queen.

46
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,934
Your Excellency Ye, please make your way up here.

47
00:04:09,934 --> 00:04:14,994
I think there is something you must confirm for us.

48
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,534
My Lord, you know, right? My daughter is the real Hyeon Seon.

49
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:29,394
If they find out we have come this far while hiding her real name,

50
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:34,454
our entire Ye clan will be exterminated for the sin of disdaining the royal family.

51
00:04:34,454 --> 00:04:39,924
Will you bring death upon all our family members because of that wench who betrayed her own father and ran away?

52
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,574
My Lord.

53
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:55,810

54
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,794
Father...

55
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,494
How ill you must've been...

56
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,514
for you to look so haggard.

57
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:24,770
I am sorry. I was busy trying to survive alone...

58
00:05:24,774 --> 00:05:29,824
 Father, what is he like? The young master from the Willow Tree residence?

59
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:35,484
 I mean, I heard ... he is quite handsome.

60
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,484
Father, please explain right away.

61
00:05:45,484 --> 00:05:48,984
That I am the real Ye Hyeon Seon.

62
00:05:48,984 --> 00:05:53,764
That girl is the worst swindler in the world!

63
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,444
Do not worry. I, your father, will take care of everything.

64
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,154
This child...

65
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,154
is my second daughter, Hyeon Hui.

66
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,790
What is he saying?

67
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:36,094
And that child over there ... is my eldest daughter, Hyeon Seon.

68
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,954
Father...

69
00:06:39,954 --> 00:06:44,514
Hyeon Seon...My daughter Hyeon Seon.

70
00:06:44,514 --> 00:06:46,234
I am sorry.

71
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,644
Please forgive this terrible father of yours.

72
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:57,814
Just ... Just what exactly is going on?

73
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,204
Everything is my fault, Your Highness.

74
00:07:02,204 --> 00:07:06,674
I was unable to properly govern my household, therefore I created such a mess.

75
00:07:06,674 --> 00:07:10,024
Please punish me, Your Highness.

76
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,704
No, Your Highness. All these events were instigated by Lady Seo.

77
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:19,634
There could not be two Ye Hyeon Seons in this world.

78
00:07:19,634 --> 00:07:22,384
That is why seven years ago, and even about a month ago,

79
00:07:22,384 --> 00:07:26,134
Lady Seo ordered someone to harm me!

80
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,014
Moreover, by kidnapping Maiden Seong Hwa Yun, who was part of the queen selection,

81
00:07:32,014 --> 00:07:35,344
she tried to manipulate this nation's queen selection process.

82
00:07:35,344 --> 00:07:41,214
Worst of all, that woman is one of the accomplices in the kidnapping of many women unable to marry

83
00:07:41,214 --> 00:07:44,604
during this Marriage Ban era and then selling them for a price in marriage.

84
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,924
- Gosh...
 - Did she really?

85
00:07:47,924 --> 00:07:49,454
How could she ...

86
00:07:49,454 --> 00:07:54,514
That is not true! How could a mere woman like me do such a thing...

87
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,664
What are you all doing? Arrest that criminal immediately!

88
00:08:02,664 --> 00:08:07,274
N-No! No! It's all a lie! No! Let go! I said it isn't so!

89
00:08:07,274 --> 00:08:09,784
- Mother!
 - Let go of me, you ruffians! It is not true!

90
00:08:09,784 --> 00:08:14,344
It is not so! It is not so! I said no! Let go!

91
00:08:14,344 --> 00:08:19,054
I said no! Let go! No!

92
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,454
Father...

93
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,224
I knew that you were the Ye Hyeon Seon called upon

94
00:09:31,224 --> 00:09:33,884
by the queen dowager.

95
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:41,984
Hence I kindly ask you to answer this question.

96
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,914
I receive you standing before me as my queen.

97
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,834
For all my life, I will be faithful to you,

98
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,204
bring you happiness,

99
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,394
and love you.

100
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,734
Will you become my queen?

101
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,794
Oh, my, look!

102
00:10:17,794 --> 00:10:19,694
Wow... daebak...

103
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,754
I...

104
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,714
So...

105
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,124
I will do so.

106
00:11:40,924 --> 00:11:43,534
The Marriage Ban Edict for this country...

107
00:11:45,314 --> 00:11:47,214
is now over.

108
00:11:50,974 --> 00:11:53,554
The Marriage Ban is over!

109
00:12:20,144 --> 00:12:25,054
With this, our Born Sul Ro group is now disbanded!

110
00:12:25,054 --> 00:12:28,814
Now, let us find our own lovers, love wholeheartedly,

111
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:31,864
and finally, be happy!

112
00:12:35,824 --> 00:12:39,844
Father! I can now marry!

113
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,724
Orabeoni Do Seok.

114
00:12:45,534 --> 00:12:47,744
Go to him now.

115
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,734
Orabeoni Do Seok.

116
00:12:54,724 --> 00:12:56,634
Painter Jeong...

117
00:13:03,654 --> 00:13:05,474
Maiden Hae Yeong.

118
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:37,484
At that time... I didn't know, that's why.

119
00:13:50,724 --> 00:13:53,954
The one I truly long for...

120
00:13:55,454 --> 00:13:57,894
The one I love...

121
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,994
is you, Orabeoni.

122
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:08,674
Where were you all this time?

123
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:11,764
Orabeoni.

124
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:15,184
Since the Marriage Ban is now over,

125
00:14:15,184 --> 00:14:17,254
will you...

126
00:14:17,254 --> 00:14:19,254
marry me?

127
00:14:19,254 --> 00:14:20,944
Huh?

128
00:14:25,584 --> 00:14:27,774
Will you marry me, I said!

129
00:14:27,774 --> 00:14:30,694
- Are you not going to?
 - Well, that...

130
00:14:36,664 --> 00:14:38,704
Well, of course, I will.

131
00:15:08,934 --> 00:15:13,034
Si Yul! I love you! Marry me, please!

132
00:15:13,064 --> 00:15:17,884
Young Master Jong Bin! I waited seven years for you. You know, right?

133
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:22,004
GyeongJin! Please look upon me now!

134
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:44,004
 Puppy, help me propose...

135
00:15:47,094 --> 00:15:49,014
Chae Won.

136
00:15:51,024 --> 00:15:53,304
Wow, what's this?

137
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:56,324
 Success!

138
00:15:56,324 --> 00:15:58,074
 I love you, Yeong Seon 
Will you marry me?

139
00:15:58,074 --> 00:16:01,564
 As soon as the Marriage Ban Edict is repealed, propose with a flower palanquin

140
00:16:01,564 --> 00:16:04,314
 Win her over with rings in a flower palanquin

141
00:16:06,024 --> 00:16:09,354
 How to propose in the Joseon era

142
00:16:13,394 --> 00:16:15,234
 Let's be happy in sacred marriage!

143
00:16:49,364 --> 00:16:54,614
To hold power, one must secure their high place through royal marriage.

144
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:58,964
With the queen selection failed, do you have any other ideas in mind?

145
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:02,324
No need to make a fuss.

146
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:07,424
The life of the new queen too

147
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:11,674
will not be too long.

148
00:17:12,374 --> 00:17:17,204
I see... In the midst of this, Na Sang Ju has disappeared.

149
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:20,054
We should be relieved about this, shouldn't we?

150
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:40,654
Who might this be?

151
00:17:40,654 --> 00:17:43,564
Where have you been all this time?

152
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:47,464
How could I protect you if I do not know your whereabouts?

153
00:17:47,464 --> 00:17:50,614
Protect me, you say?

154
00:17:50,614 --> 00:17:57,054
As far as I know, you sent someone to kill me.

155
00:17:57,054 --> 00:18:01,284
I will now inform them about everything you have done.

156
00:18:01,284 --> 00:18:03,224
How you bastard commissioned me to murder seven years ago,

157
00:18:03,224 --> 00:18:07,394
so that you may enact the Marriage Ban Edict.

158
00:18:07,394 --> 00:18:12,774
The things you ordered me to do every year,  to be able to prolong that edict!

159
00:18:12,774 --> 00:18:15,074
I will even speak of the horrid happenings surrounding the women of this country

160
00:18:15,074 --> 00:18:17,224
surrounding the women of this country

161
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:21,400
during the Marriage Ban era.

162
00:18:22,514 --> 00:18:25,734
You knave, how dare you...

163
00:18:28,004 --> 00:18:33,864
Where should we cut in order to shut you up?

164
00:18:36,974 --> 00:18:38,964
Get rid of him.

165
00:19:18,554 --> 00:19:22,024
I released him to go and find his owner,

166
00:19:22,894 --> 00:19:25,644
and I see this is where he turns up.

167
00:19:31,614 --> 00:19:38,034
 This knave will soon die, you say? By some means that's what will happen eventually.

168
00:19:38,034 --> 00:19:41,674
 You still have some work to do, however.

169
00:19:41,674 --> 00:19:46,484
 Letting you die would be a pity, because your superiors would be able to cut the tail off.

170
00:19:49,744 --> 00:19:53,294
 That said, I will spare your life this one time.

171
00:19:53,294 --> 00:19:56,314
 How dare you look upon the king's face!

172
00:19:57,084 --> 00:19:58,944
 Enough.

173
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:10,324
 On top of sparing your life,

174
00:20:11,284 --> 00:20:14,224
 I shall release you from here.

175
00:20:17,374 --> 00:20:19,984
 So go and hunt down

176
00:20:19,984 --> 00:20:22,494
your knave of a master.

177
00:20:29,674 --> 00:20:32,774
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

178
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,454
Finally Your Majesty

179
00:20:35,454 --> 00:20:39,074
has chosen the queen for this nation.

180
00:20:39,074 --> 00:20:42,594
However, it is a shame.

181
00:20:42,594 --> 00:20:44,914
For I intend ...

182
00:20:44,914 --> 00:20:50,374
to make the new bride a widow.

183
00:21:11,194 --> 00:21:16,404
You knave have subjected countless women to unbearable shame by kidnapping them

184
00:21:16,404 --> 00:21:19,244
and, because of thwarting the queen selection by your heinous murder,

185
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:22,694
you have prevented marriage for the people of the whole country.

186
00:21:22,694 --> 00:21:27,074
You have committed a felony that cannot even be weighed!

187
00:21:30,064 --> 00:21:32,084
Attack!

188
00:23:00,634 --> 00:23:07,244
I will no longer allow this nation's fate to be played by the hands of such traitors.

189
00:25:09,644 --> 00:25:12,614
What are you thinking about so intently?

190
00:25:14,244 --> 00:25:15,944
Well...

191
00:25:17,514 --> 00:25:21,204
That we could just be happy now. Something like that...

192
00:25:21,794 --> 00:25:24,674
And what were you thinking about?

193
00:25:24,674 --> 00:25:27,854
Just, you know...

194
00:25:27,854 --> 00:25:32,914
Glancing at this fire in this moment of tranquility...

195
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:37,474
The commotion from the other day feels like it was all a dream.

196
00:25:40,954 --> 00:25:45,054
There is one thing I would like to ask Your Majesty.

197
00:25:45,054 --> 00:25:48,244
Since when did you know about my name?

198
00:25:50,554 --> 00:25:53,504
Sin Won informed me last time.

199
00:25:53,504 --> 00:25:56,534
 There is a reason I have returned.

200
00:25:56,534 --> 00:26:01,234
 It is to recover the name of the person who must stay by Your Majesty's side.

201
00:26:01,884 --> 00:26:07,214
So why did you not tell me about your name?

202
00:26:07,214 --> 00:26:10,014
Because I believed...

203
00:26:10,014 --> 00:26:14,004
my name is something I must reclaim on my own.

204
00:26:14,004 --> 00:26:19,874
In the end, I owe it to the Queen Dowager who believed what I said.

205
00:26:21,384 --> 00:26:24,434
I had trust in my grandmother as well.

206
00:26:24,434 --> 00:26:30,454
I knew that she would stand by your side once she found out the whole truth.

207
00:26:34,444 --> 00:26:36,774
Can I...

208
00:26:36,774 --> 00:26:39,704
continue to call you So Rang?

209
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:41,964
Of course.

210
00:26:41,964 --> 00:26:44,624
I much prefer that as well.

211
00:26:57,994 --> 00:27:04,624
I cannot believe... that someone so dashing is to become my dear husband.

212
00:27:09,524 --> 00:27:10,954
You are so pretty.

213
00:27:10,954 --> 00:27:12,344
Oh, my...

214
00:27:12,344 --> 00:27:13,894
Gosh.

215
00:27:13,894 --> 00:27:18,754
If you must, there is a location I know of.

216
00:27:18,754 --> 00:27:21,184
The setting is outdoors, but...

217
00:27:26,614 --> 00:27:31,154
May Your Majesty... not hesitate...

218
00:27:34,624 --> 00:27:37,764
Then... as there is much...

219
00:27:37,764 --> 00:27:42,694
m-much left to discuss... so, let us... Whatever is left, let us... in there...

220
00:27:44,114 --> 00:27:48,004
- Yes, indeed ... 
  - There you are!

221
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,994
The Head Eunuch who was leading me kept getting lost.

222
00:27:51,994 --> 00:27:55,304
I thought I would never run into you tonight.

223
00:27:55,304 --> 00:27:58,574
At such a late time, though...

224
00:27:58,574 --> 00:28:01,364
what were you two doing?

225
00:28:01,364 --> 00:28:04,014
- Oh...
 - Well...

226
00:28:04,014 --> 00:28:06,304
We were just about to leave after finishing our conversation.

227
00:28:06,304 --> 00:28:08,804
I see. Is that so?

228
00:28:08,804 --> 00:28:12,654
Then, our queen-to-be, follow me.

229
00:28:12,654 --> 00:28:13,654
- What?
 - What?

230
00:28:13,654 --> 00:28:15,004
Come now.

231
00:28:15,004 --> 00:28:18,054
This queen-to-be is no longer a court lady of the royal chamber.

232
00:28:18,054 --> 00:28:21,354
She will be spending about 40 days at a separate palace.

233
00:28:21,354 --> 00:28:23,374
She is now an undeniable bride-to-be.

234
00:28:23,374 --> 00:28:25,744
Will I not be able to see her during that time, then?

235
00:28:25,744 --> 00:28:29,054
Your people have waited seven years.

236
00:28:29,054 --> 00:28:32,054
Yet you cannot even wait just 40 days?

237
00:28:32,054 --> 00:28:35,224
- Well...
 - Do not worry, my king!

238
00:28:35,224 --> 00:28:40,514
This grandmother will take great care of her granddaughter-in-law until the royal marriage.

239
00:28:40,514 --> 00:28:42,394
Now, let us go.

240
00:28:42,394 --> 00:28:44,294
There are lots to do!

241
00:28:44,294 --> 00:28:46,004
Onward we go.

242
00:28:46,004 --> 00:28:51,744
Pay attention. Do not be distracted. Now, let's go.

243
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:01,874
Actually...

244
00:29:01,874 --> 00:29:06,034
I called you here because I had something to tell you separately.

245
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:08,964
Yes, Your Highness.

246
00:29:08,964 --> 00:29:11,144
For not being able to...

247
00:29:11,144 --> 00:29:13,734
believe you sooner...

248
00:29:13,734 --> 00:29:15,674
I am sorry.

249
00:29:15,674 --> 00:29:21,524
 Your Highness specifically called me in before the third queen selection process to speak to me.

250
00:29:21,524 --> 00:29:24,494
 Are you not afraid?

251
00:29:24,494 --> 00:29:27,014
 You intend to reveal the truth...

252
00:29:27,014 --> 00:29:30,294
 even by risking your life.

253
00:29:30,294 --> 00:29:33,724
 Do you not know how difficult it is

254
00:29:33,724 --> 00:29:37,214
 to survive within this palace

255
00:29:37,214 --> 00:29:41,924
 and persevere on one's path?

256
00:29:42,704 --> 00:29:44,454
 However,

257
00:29:44,454 --> 00:29:48,584
 Your Highness has not lost the way.

258
00:29:48,584 --> 00:29:51,204
 Even though the ones you once trusted

259
00:29:51,204 --> 00:29:53,964
 had deceived you,

260
00:29:53,964 --> 00:29:56,434
 you were not shaken by it

261
00:29:56,434 --> 00:29:59,274
 and kept your balance.

262
00:30:00,094 --> 00:30:03,214
 I am not afraid.

263
00:30:03,214 --> 00:30:08,334
 Because I believe Your Highness has recognized my sincerity.

264
00:30:09,404 --> 00:30:12,284
My saying thank you is a bit late.

265
00:30:12,284 --> 00:30:16,994
You are the one who saved my grandson from the depths of darkness.

266
00:30:16,994 --> 00:30:21,814
Yet I kept cornering you when I should have really thanked you.

267
00:30:21,814 --> 00:30:27,954
For you are the one whom my grandson loves the most in the world.

268
00:30:27,954 --> 00:30:34,334
You are now someone who is most precious to me as well.

269
00:30:35,154 --> 00:30:37,054
Your Highness.

270
00:30:38,384 --> 00:30:42,154
Come here. Let me embrace you.

271
00:30:48,364 --> 00:30:50,514
Dear.

272
00:30:50,514 --> 00:30:52,634
My dear granddaughter-in-law.

273
00:30:58,234 --> 00:31:00,714
I have high hopes for you.

274
00:31:00,714 --> 00:31:03,134
Since you have already spent some time in the palace,

275
00:31:03,134 --> 00:31:07,344
I'm sure you will adjust quicker than those coming from private homes.

276
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,474
Starting tomorrow, you will rise at insi*
   (hour of the tiger: 3 a.m. - 5 a.m.)

277
00:31:10,474 --> 00:31:13,324
and receive lessons on etiquette and rules.

278
00:31:13,324 --> 00:31:14,844
But—

279
00:31:14,844 --> 00:31:16,524
Myosi*.
  (hour of the rabbit: 5 a.m. - 7 a.m.)

280
00:31:16,524 --> 00:31:19,684
My focus is optimal during myosi.

281
00:31:19,684 --> 00:31:23,304
Don't be ridiculous. Insi!

282
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,774
Insi...

283
00:31:25,774 --> 00:31:27,674
Let us go...

284
00:31:48,334 --> 00:31:50,334
Head Court Lady Won?

285
00:31:52,104 --> 00:31:55,974
I am Head Court Lady Won, who has reentered the palace temporarily,

286
00:31:55,974 --> 00:31:58,754
given the assignment of educating the queen-to-be.

287
00:32:05,014 --> 00:32:07,914
It's been a while since we were here.

288
00:32:07,914 --> 00:32:10,154
When I met you at that time, I thought,

289
00:32:10,154 --> 00:32:15,304
"Whoa, she must really have deep ties with me." I felt this at once intuitively.

290
00:32:15,304 --> 00:32:17,554
Yes, Queen-to-be.

291
00:32:17,554 --> 00:32:22,394
Now, the day after the party, after formally greeting the queen dowager,

292
00:32:22,394 --> 00:32:24,264
you must hold a Myohyunrye*.
  (Ancestral ritual done by the Queen/Crown Princess)

293
00:32:24,264 --> 00:32:26,914
Myohyunrye is a custom of paying respect to one's ancestors.

294
00:32:26,914 --> 00:32:32,134
Once you have completed such a procedure, you will be acknowledged as a true daughter-in-law.

295
00:32:32,134 --> 00:32:34,744
When you formally greet the elders, you must bow deeply.

296
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:38,254
However, at the myohyunrye and ceremony, the proper way to bow is different.

297
00:32:38,254 --> 00:32:40,234
Why don't you give it a try?

298
00:32:40,234 --> 00:32:41,904
- Right now?
 - Yes, yes.

299
00:32:41,904 --> 00:32:44,774
- Now, rise.
 - Yes.

300
00:32:44,774 --> 00:32:46,654
Like this, and this...

301
00:32:46,654 --> 00:32:47,874
You should look here.

302
00:32:47,874 --> 00:32:50,194
The headpiece may be too heavy and break your neck.

303
00:32:50,194 --> 00:32:52,274
- You must not make a big mistake...
 - Head Court Lady!

304
00:32:52,274 --> 00:32:55,004
I must be feeling slightly anemic...

305
00:32:55,004 --> 00:32:56,154
Queen-to-be.

306
00:32:56,154 --> 00:32:58,104
Whom are you trying to fool?

307
00:32:58,104 --> 00:33:01,464
Trying to get away with your silly old tricks.

308
00:33:01,464 --> 00:33:04,474
Seven years since I've used these! Sit down now.

309
00:33:04,474 --> 00:33:09,104
As the head of court ladies, you must have accurate knowledge of the line of descendants.

310
00:33:13,514 --> 00:33:14,964
Head Court Lady Won.

311
00:33:14,964 --> 00:33:19,104
Let us... have a snack break first.

312
00:33:22,874 --> 00:33:28,024
Yes, why don't we? How is it that you did not change at all?

313
00:33:28,024 --> 00:33:32,534
That is exactly what I would like to say!

314
00:33:45,144 --> 00:33:48,214
Can you all leave for a moment?

315
00:33:49,144 --> 00:33:52,844
We are so busy, so why are you sending all the kitchen court ladies away?

316
00:33:52,844 --> 00:33:55,864
Because I had something to tell you, Head Court Lady Won.

317
00:33:55,864 --> 00:34:00,764
Do not even call me a court lady. I am afraid that I might end up permanently settling here like this.

318
00:34:00,764 --> 00:34:03,314
Then I shall call you a temporary.

319
00:34:03,314 --> 00:34:05,344
Hey, Temporary.

320
00:34:06,174 --> 00:34:12,824
What are you deepening your voice for? You are not even able to use it, yet you are trying to act manly...

321
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,924
Hey, Temporary.

322
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:22,274
Do you think that everyone who is a eunuch is unable to use it?

323
00:34:22,274 --> 00:34:24,184
O-Of course.

324
00:34:24,184 --> 00:34:29,754
A hundred out of a hundred, a thousand out of a thousand... every single one of us?

325
00:34:29,754 --> 00:34:32,654
How do you know when you have not even seen it?

326
00:34:38,134 --> 00:34:42,334
But it is not as if I can check for myself.

327
00:34:42,334 --> 00:34:44,204
If you really need to check for yourself to believe!

328
00:34:44,204 --> 00:34:45,894
Aigoo, no!

329
00:34:45,894 --> 00:34:47,764
There is no need!

330
00:34:47,764 --> 00:34:50,754
Why? You may speak otherwise later.

331
00:34:50,754 --> 00:34:52,954
I will not speak otherwise.

332
00:34:52,954 --> 00:34:57,684
Then... you should stop rebuffing me now.

333
00:34:57,684 --> 00:34:59,594
A former court lady is sent out of the palace to her private home

334
00:34:59,594 --> 00:35:03,314
so that she may freely get married.

335
00:35:05,624 --> 00:35:10,254
So now, there appears to be nothing that would stop us from being together.

336
00:35:10,254 --> 00:35:11,834
Gosh...

337
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:15,024
So, you should now...

338
00:35:17,154 --> 00:35:20,974
marry... me.

339
00:35:27,284 --> 00:35:29,404
Gosh!

340
00:35:33,044 --> 00:35:35,814
Won Nyeo!

341
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:40,914
Head Court Lady Won said she was going to get some snacks...

342
00:35:40,914 --> 00:35:43,794
Did she go to make sugar herself?

343
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,994
Won Nyeo!

344
00:35:48,664 --> 00:35:51,054
- Won Nyeo.
 - Come on, seriously ...

345
00:35:51,054 --> 00:35:52,284
Won Nyeo.

346
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:54,624
Stop coming toward me.

347
00:35:54,624 --> 00:35:56,564
- Seriously...
 - Won Nyeo.

348
00:35:56,564 --> 00:36:00,194
- Aigoo.
 - You'll be in big trouble when I catch you.

349
00:36:00,194 --> 00:36:04,514
I see that she has been sprinkling sugar all over the place.

350
00:36:20,134 --> 00:36:23,444
But why this mountain of all places?

351
00:36:49,594 --> 00:36:55,904
Because of your kidnapping gang, I lost my 17-year-old younger sister.

352
00:36:57,274 --> 00:37:01,184
Finally, I get my reward

353
00:37:01,184 --> 00:37:03,734
for enduring all these years.

354
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:18,664
 Herbal medicine prescription

355
00:37:25,274 --> 00:37:28,794
For Ye Hyeon Ho, having seen the prescriptions you received from the herbalist,

356
00:37:28,794 --> 00:37:32,664
you had been made sick from taking herbs that weakened your body for many years.

357
00:37:32,664 --> 00:37:36,814
So I judge you were unaware of the crime. However,

358
00:37:36,814 --> 00:37:39,434
I cannot let the fact that you allowed this great trouble to take place

359
00:37:39,434 --> 00:37:43,874
by not properly governing your family well from the start.

360
00:37:44,954 --> 00:37:48,004
Retire to the countryside and reflect on your actions.

361
00:37:50,054 --> 00:37:52,344
Mother...

362
00:37:52,344 --> 00:37:55,404
What is going to happen to us now?

363
00:37:55,404 --> 00:37:58,374
For Ye Hyeon Hui, who deceived the royal family,

364
00:37:58,934 --> 00:38:01,484
you will be made into a government slave and sent to the fields of Tamna

365
00:38:01,484 --> 00:38:05,054
to do hard labor for the rest of your life.

366
00:38:08,814 --> 00:38:10,724
Mother...

367
00:38:10,724 --> 00:38:12,464
Hyeon Hui!

368
00:38:12,464 --> 00:38:16,014
Also, Seo Wun Jeong, who had several people kidnapped and murdered,

369
00:38:16,014 --> 00:38:18,444
and rigged this nation's queen selection

370
00:38:18,444 --> 00:38:21,744
disturbing the custom of the royal family,

371
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:26,284
will receive no mercy and be sentenced to death by hanging!

372
00:39:36,434 --> 00:39:39,174
You are so beautiful, Queen-to-be, Your Highness.

373
00:39:39,174 --> 00:39:43,634
Wait, you are queen, Your Highness, from today on.

374
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:01,654
You are very pretty, Your Highness.

375
00:40:05,484 --> 00:40:09,994
I made special arrangements to bring them here. Are they not your family?

376
00:40:21,574 --> 00:40:24,004
Old man...

377
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,674
You knew, right?

378
00:40:25,674 --> 00:40:29,484
I should have known. Ever since I first came to you dressed in beggar's rags seven years ago,

379
00:40:29,484 --> 00:40:32,264
you were strangely nice to me.

380
00:40:35,004 --> 00:40:37,084
There is a phrase called Life Jong* Per.
  (Korean for bell)

381
00:40:37,084 --> 00:40:39,754
Until the bell signifying the end of your life rings, persevere.

382
00:40:39,754 --> 00:40:40,974
Geez.

383
00:40:40,974 --> 00:40:44,604
It appears that our Jong Per wins out in the end again.

384
00:40:44,604 --> 00:40:47,954
You should have said something to me in advance, too!

385
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:51,464
Why?

386
00:40:51,464 --> 00:40:53,544
Are your clothes heavy?

387
00:40:53,544 --> 00:40:54,874
Yes.

388
00:40:54,874 --> 00:40:57,054
It is so heavy...

389
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,424
It is so heavy,

390
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:02,314
I do not think I can move forward.

391
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:04,514
I mean, think about it.

392
00:41:04,514 --> 00:41:07,914
How could a fraud like me become the queen?

393
00:41:07,914 --> 00:41:09,624
I do not think that way.

394
00:41:09,624 --> 00:41:13,014
Is there anyone like you who has traveled to every corner of Joseon?

395
00:41:13,014 --> 00:41:14,814
The one who met all those people

396
00:41:14,814 --> 00:41:17,614
and helped all of their secret love affairs,

397
00:41:17,614 --> 00:41:20,834
and ultimately made them laugh was you.

398
00:41:20,834 --> 00:41:25,154
In my opinion, rather than a maiden who has grown up like a flower in a greenhouse,

399
00:41:25,154 --> 00:41:27,464
you, who rolled in a field of dog poop, are better.

400
00:41:27,464 --> 00:41:29,004
D-Dog poop?

401
00:41:29,004 --> 00:41:31,304
What have you been doing all this time?

402
00:41:31,304 --> 00:41:32,814
Acting as an affection glue.

403
00:41:32,814 --> 00:41:34,224
That is right.

404
00:41:34,224 --> 00:41:38,264
What you have been doing was growing that small flutter into a big love.

405
00:41:38,264 --> 00:41:39,864
All you have to do is do what you have been doing.

406
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:42,974
Just as you helped his majesty to believe in love again,

407
00:41:42,974 --> 00:41:47,094
generously share your affection with the people who are starved for love due to the Marriage Ban Edict,

408
00:41:47,094 --> 00:41:50,974
and help his majesty to execute policies that are for the people.

409
00:41:50,974 --> 00:41:55,634
I, too, believe that you can do it, Your Highness.

410
00:41:56,484 --> 00:41:57,734
Since, Eonni,

411
00:41:57,734 --> 00:42:00,264
your very presence is happiness!

412
00:42:00,264 --> 00:42:02,364
Oh, my eyes! So bright!

413
00:42:08,354 --> 00:42:10,244
All right.

414
00:43:49,654 --> 00:43:51,514
A maternity leave?

415
00:43:51,514 --> 00:43:53,494
It is said that there was an incident

416
00:43:53,494 --> 00:43:56,284
in which a servant in the royal kitchen collapsed

417
00:43:56,284 --> 00:43:59,244
when she returned to work seven days after giving birth.

418
00:43:59,244 --> 00:44:02,784
Postnatal care is so important after giving birth,

419
00:44:02,784 --> 00:44:06,384
so how could she return to work in just seven days?

420
00:44:09,674 --> 00:44:12,314
Then by chance, even when I give birth,

421
00:44:12,314 --> 00:44:17,054
will you be able to order me to get up after seven days and perform all my duties as queen?

422
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:18,874
That is a different situation.

423
00:44:18,874 --> 00:44:21,884
- You are this nation's queen—
 - It is not different.

424
00:44:21,884 --> 00:44:26,824
I, too, was no different from them before I entered the palace.

425
00:44:26,824 --> 00:44:30,874
It does not make sense that I would need 70 days to recover as the queen,

426
00:44:30,874 --> 00:44:34,684
and yet seven days would suffice as a wanderer, even though it is the same body.

427
00:44:35,394 --> 00:44:39,144
Your Majesty, a child who is born after being carried in the womb for ten months

428
00:44:39,144 --> 00:44:42,064
is precious to anyone.

429
00:44:42,674 --> 00:44:47,794
Please show the same care for your people as you care for me.

430
00:44:51,664 --> 00:44:55,614
As much as I want to care for you, you say ...

431
00:44:58,344 --> 00:45:01,064
Regardless of one's status,

432
00:45:01,064 --> 00:45:03,944
I will extend the seven days that were given for maternity leave

433
00:45:03,944 --> 00:45:06,734
to 100 days.

434
00:45:06,734 --> 00:45:08,154
A-A hundred days?

435
00:45:08,154 --> 00:45:11,294
Also, in the case that a wife has given birth,

436
00:45:11,294 --> 00:45:14,734
give the husband 30 days of paternity leave too.

437
00:45:14,734 --> 00:45:20,714
Your Majesty, the one who gave birth is the wife, so is there really a need for that?

438
00:45:20,714 --> 00:45:23,204
Of course.

439
00:45:23,204 --> 00:45:27,904
Who will take care of the exhausted mother and the newborn?

440
00:45:27,904 --> 00:45:32,864
Since we have caused much pain for the people through the long-lasting marriage ban,

441
00:45:32,864 --> 00:45:34,844
this nation will take care

442
00:45:34,844 --> 00:45:37,914
of the children who are born from now on.

443
00:45:37,914 --> 00:45:42,614
We shall carry out your command, Your Majesty.

444
00:45:47,454 --> 00:45:49,294
Royal Chief Secretary.

445
00:45:49,294 --> 00:45:51,864
You know, the servant who collapsed...

446
00:45:51,864 --> 00:45:55,144
Send the physician to her and have him check on her current condition.

447
00:45:55,144 --> 00:45:59,744
Actually, I was a bit concerned myself, so I already had her checked.

448
00:45:59,744 --> 00:46:02,544
But he said that wind had entered her wrists and ankles, and her body has weakened,

449
00:46:02,544 --> 00:46:05,734
so she will take a long time to recover.

450
00:46:10,054 --> 00:46:11,524
Queen.

451
00:46:11,524 --> 00:46:14,544
I only need you.

452
00:46:15,154 --> 00:46:17,154
All of a sudden?

453
00:46:18,254 --> 00:46:23,764
To give birth to a child, you would have to risk your life.

454
00:46:23,764 --> 00:46:25,384
No.

455
00:46:25,384 --> 00:46:27,824
What if I were to lose you...

456
00:46:31,634 --> 00:46:34,134
Calm down, Your Majesty.

457
00:46:34,814 --> 00:46:38,814
I appreciate that you care for me this much,

458
00:46:46,964 --> 00:46:49,074
but this is going too far!

459
00:46:49,074 --> 00:46:52,534
You just made such an important decision for the children who are to be born.

460
00:46:52,534 --> 00:46:55,304
Yet how could you delay my own childbearing!

461
00:46:56,514 --> 00:46:57,904
But So Rang...

462
00:46:57,904 --> 00:46:59,924
what if things get dangerous for you?

463
00:46:59,924 --> 00:47:03,144
I do not think it is something for us to get scared about in advance and avoid.

464
00:47:03,144 --> 00:47:05,444
No matter what difficult situation we face,

465
00:47:05,444 --> 00:47:08,094
we will be able to push through it well

466
00:47:08,094 --> 00:47:11,254
because we are together.

467
00:47:19,284 --> 00:47:21,194
So Rang...

468
00:47:22,804 --> 00:47:24,894
Your Majesty.

469
00:48:11,484 --> 00:48:16,404
You must have suffered so much in your heart.

470
00:48:18,184 --> 00:48:23,324
How could I understand the feeling of losing your child?

471
00:48:23,324 --> 00:48:29,404
But I would like to ease the pain that you have suffered all these years.

472
00:48:29,404 --> 00:48:30,324
Your Highness...

473
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:34,694
I have requested that the late crown princess' unfair death be cleared of false accusations and her title restored,

474
00:48:34,694 --> 00:48:36,734
so we will soon issue a posthumous name for her

475
00:48:36,734 --> 00:48:41,254
and prepare a new grave befitting her rank.

476
00:48:45,774 --> 00:48:47,884
My daughter...

477
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:49,454
I mean,

478
00:48:50,234 --> 00:48:52,904
our crown princess...

479
00:48:52,904 --> 00:48:54,684
After she passed like that,

480
00:48:54,684 --> 00:48:57,554
the public has been uttering vulgar criticisms of her

481
00:48:57,554 --> 00:49:00,204
for being the main reason for the long-lasting Marriage Ban.

482
00:49:00,204 --> 00:49:02,144
I could not even properly defend her

483
00:49:02,144 --> 00:49:05,264
against all those harsh words,

484
00:49:06,774 --> 00:49:10,734
and yet, to think that you would care so much for us, Your Highness.

485
00:49:19,614 --> 00:49:22,054
Do not cry.

486
00:49:25,014 --> 00:49:26,634
Stop your tears.

487
00:49:31,544 --> 00:49:34,054
Match it well over there.

488
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,044
Gosh.

489
00:49:36,824 --> 00:49:38,364
Over there, too.

490
00:49:38,364 --> 00:49:40,404
Is it not so great!

491
00:49:40,404 --> 00:49:43,064
Oh, wow.

492
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:48,200
I mean, our palace has changed.

493
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,024
Only the palace?

494
00:49:50,024 --> 00:49:52,764
It is as if the entire nation has gotten brighter.

495
00:49:52,764 --> 00:49:54,964
Just like our queen.

496
00:49:54,964 --> 00:49:59,134
And most importantly, his majesty has been deeply involved in all of his affairs!

497
00:49:59,134 --> 00:50:01,274
He ordered that those who could not marry because they were poor

498
00:50:01,274 --> 00:50:04,924
be provided with marriage goods and 100 nyang.*
  (Joseon currency)

499
00:50:04,924 --> 00:50:07,024
He ordered that those who are having difficulty raising their children be identified

500
00:50:07,024 --> 00:50:08,144
and provide them with the necessary supplies.

501
00:50:08,144 --> 00:50:09,384
Mothers who give birth shall be given 100 days of maternity leave.

502
00:50:09,384 --> 00:50:12,564
There have been so many backed-up weddings over the past few years that everyone is looking for feast workers.

503
00:50:12,564 --> 00:50:13,464
All right, what is next?

504
00:50:13,464 --> 00:50:15,084
He has accepted the request of the official in charge of issuing ID tags for additional personnel,

505
00:50:15,084 --> 00:50:16,614
- as he is experiencing a sudden increase in workload.
 - All right, do so.

506
00:50:16,614 --> 00:50:18,874
- Next.
 - These are all good things.

507
00:50:18,874 --> 00:50:20,954
- Yes.
 - But, Chief State Councilor ...

508
00:50:20,954 --> 00:50:25,434
Why do you seem so gloomy, Chief State Councilor?

509
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:36,474
You should go in first.

510
00:50:36,474 --> 00:50:39,174
- You should go in first.
 - No, you should go up first.

511
00:50:39,174 --> 00:50:40,924
No, you should go in first.

512
00:50:40,924 --> 00:50:43,924
Look, you have changed a lot since we last met.

513
00:50:43,924 --> 00:50:45,374
You should hurry up.

514
00:50:45,374 --> 00:50:47,744
You should not get angry and go in.

515
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:49,144
How is it...

516
00:50:49,144 --> 00:50:52,374
that the two of you are like this here?

517
00:50:52,374 --> 00:50:54,484
Your Highness.

518
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:56,664
Please do something about my Hwa Yun.

519
00:50:56,664 --> 00:51:00,264
Your Highness, please do something about my Sin Won.

520
00:51:01,244 --> 00:51:05,734
Could you two not do something about it together?

521
00:51:09,464 --> 00:51:11,814
I came because I had a request to make of you.

522
00:51:11,814 --> 00:51:15,634
What request would my queen have for me?

523
00:51:15,634 --> 00:51:19,744
At a time when the Marriage Ban Edict has been repealed, and everyone is able to get married,

524
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:23,754
there is still someone who is forbidden from getting married.

525
00:51:23,754 --> 00:51:24,804
Is that so?

526
00:51:24,804 --> 00:51:27,754
With things like this, we cannot say that it is a world

527
00:51:27,754 --> 00:51:31,344
where everyone is free to love and get married.

528
00:51:32,034 --> 00:51:38,324
What about you save that person as well?

529
00:51:38,324 --> 00:51:40,894
Just who is it?

530
00:51:40,894 --> 00:51:44,654
 Even the maidens who are eliminated from the three-part queen selection are considered the king's,

531
00:51:44,654 --> 00:51:47,494
 and are therefore unable to get married.

532
00:51:47,494 --> 00:51:49,724
 Just because the Marriage Ban Edict was repealed

533
00:51:49,724 --> 00:51:52,774
 does not mean that she is able to avoid the fate of living alone.

534
00:51:52,774 --> 00:51:55,934
His majesty has granted your request?

535
00:51:55,934 --> 00:51:59,674
Does that mean that I can get married as well?

536
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:06,144
But, why is it so noisy outside?

537
00:52:06,144 --> 00:52:09,184
Hey! It appears that the wildcats

538
00:52:09,184 --> 00:52:12,374
have ripped a hole in the chicken coop.

539
00:52:12,934 --> 00:52:15,214
What shall we do?

540
00:52:16,044 --> 00:52:19,024
Please wait here. I will go see what I can do.

541
00:52:22,284 --> 00:52:23,764
Hurry up and catch it!

542
00:52:23,764 --> 00:52:25,174
Capture the chicken!

543
00:52:25,174 --> 00:52:28,254
Hurry and grab it!

544
00:52:31,574 --> 00:52:34,954
Catch the chicken!

545
00:52:34,954 --> 00:52:36,334
Geez...

546
00:52:36,334 --> 00:52:38,854
Aigoo.

547
00:52:40,874 --> 00:52:43,794
Goodness...

548
00:52:45,594 --> 00:52:50,024
All of these... Aigoo, our lady was this good?

549
00:53:19,074 --> 00:53:21,564
Chief Lee Sin Won?

550
00:53:23,304 --> 00:53:25,804
What are you doing here?

551
00:53:26,824 --> 00:53:28,574
Well, first...

552
00:53:28,574 --> 00:53:31,384
it would be good to get up first before we talk.

553
00:53:31,384 --> 00:53:38,884
Oh, right. 
 ♫  You gently tap on my heart through the flowers  ♫

554
00:53:38,884 --> 00:53:42,794
But for what reason are you leaving in such a dangerous fashion?

555
00:53:42,794 --> 00:53:45,204
Oh, no, it is not that.

556
00:53:45,204 --> 00:53:47,524
I was trying to capture the chicken, and...

557
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:49,604
You were personally doing that, Lady?

558
00:53:49,604 --> 00:53:54,000
♫  Will your sweet voice which comes from far away make my heart cry?  ♫

559
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,200
Well, I came to return your clothing.

560
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,394
Your dress was damaged so it took some time to get it repaired.

561
00:54:00,394 --> 00:54:03,144
- I am sorry.
 - Oh, that one from that time?

562
00:54:03,144 --> 00:54:06,244
Yes. My father got mad at me,

563
00:54:06,244 --> 00:54:10,144
saying that I needed to return things like these in person.

564
00:54:14,874 --> 00:54:16,884
Give me one second.

565
00:54:17,834 --> 00:54:27,700
♫  Do you know how I feel?  ♫

566
00:54:29,964 --> 00:54:31,884
This...

567
00:54:33,114 --> 00:54:35,854
Here, and here, too.

568
00:54:35,854 --> 00:54:37,424
Look.

569
00:54:37,424 --> 00:54:40,914
It is embarrassing, so stop it.

570
00:54:40,914 --> 00:54:43,304
Do not laugh.

571
00:54:45,074 --> 00:54:47,864
And you cannot hold in laughter, either.

572
00:54:49,994 --> 00:54:52,034
All right, then.

573
00:54:52,034 --> 00:54:53,594
Wait.

574
00:54:53,594 --> 00:54:55,654
It is cold outside,

575
00:54:55,654 --> 00:54:58,334
so you should eat something with us before you go.

576
00:55:00,234 --> 00:55:01,594
Then,

577
00:55:01,594 --> 00:55:03,934
how about a bowl of boiled chicken with that chicken over there?

578
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:05,574
No, not that one.

579
00:55:05,574 --> 00:55:07,264
I have already grown affectionate with it.

580
00:55:07,264 --> 00:55:09,574
I even named it.

581
00:55:09,574 --> 00:55:10,894
Well, what is its name?

582
00:55:10,894 --> 00:55:12,384
Chicken Porridge.

583
00:55:12,384 --> 00:55:13,864
What?

584
00:55:14,954 --> 00:55:17,224
That is a bit cruel...

585
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,800
♫  Even on a day when the petals flutter  ♫

586
00:55:23,814 --> 00:55:25,514
Chicken Porridge, let us go!

587
00:55:25,514 --> 00:55:31,174
Come on! 
 ♫  Oh this white night with the flowers raining downr  ♫

588
00:55:31,174 --> 00:55:40,124
♫  Will you also think of me?  ♫

589
00:55:53,134 --> 00:55:55,024
 Congratulations on the First Former Palace Ladies Group Blind Introduction Meeting

590
00:55:55,024 --> 00:56:01,004
I was pretty famous in my neighborhood for being good at soccer.

591
00:56:05,184 --> 00:56:06,824
Well, oh...

592
00:56:06,824 --> 00:56:11,444
When we were in the army at the frontier?

593
00:56:13,944 --> 00:56:17,224
When I was in the army,

594
00:56:17,224 --> 00:56:19,984
I was pretty good at soccer.

595
00:56:22,554 --> 00:56:25,254
So, when I count to three,

596
00:56:25,254 --> 00:56:27,794
shall we try to point our fingers at the one that we like?

597
00:56:27,794 --> 00:56:30,074
Yes, yes.

598
00:56:30,074 --> 00:56:30,934
Then...

599
00:56:30,934 --> 00:56:34,624
One, two, three!

600
00:56:40,274 --> 00:56:41,964
In this world,

601
00:56:41,964 --> 00:56:45,744
there are relationships that just do not form, no matter how much you try.

602
00:56:45,744 --> 00:56:49,414
And there are also relationships just form without any effort, like attracting magnets.

603
00:56:49,414 --> 00:56:51,414
What is the secret to that?

604
00:56:51,414 --> 00:56:53,504
It is compatibility.

605
00:56:53,504 --> 00:56:56,114
All right. For the ladies,

606
00:56:56,114 --> 00:56:58,914
how about writing down your day and hour of birth for me?

607
00:56:58,914 --> 00:57:02,124
Based on your horoscope, I will help you find the man who is perfect for your life.

608
00:57:02,124 --> 00:57:04,084
Oh, wow.

609
00:57:04,084 --> 00:57:05,624
Here.

610
00:57:09,894 --> 00:57:11,774
 Day and time of birth

611
00:57:14,654 --> 00:57:16,824
Let me see...

612
00:57:18,634 --> 00:57:20,934
Oh, for you,

613
00:57:20,934 --> 00:57:23,204
it seems as if this man would be your best match.

614
00:57:23,204 --> 00:57:24,964
I do not know about right now,

615
00:57:24,964 --> 00:57:26,174
but as you live with him,

616
00:57:26,174 --> 00:57:31,024
you will realize that a man like him, who is simple like a bear, is the real deal.

617
00:57:33,014 --> 00:57:34,024
Thank you.

618
00:57:34,024 --> 00:57:36,074
Oh, for you,

619
00:57:36,074 --> 00:57:38,484
this man would seem to be a good match.

620
00:57:38,484 --> 00:57:41,994
And for you, this one seems to be a good match.

621
00:57:43,174 --> 00:57:45,234
All right, then.

622
00:57:53,464 --> 00:57:56,574
What is the point of helping others with their relationships?

623
00:57:56,574 --> 00:57:59,034
I need to find my own mate.

624
00:57:59,814 --> 00:58:02,764
Would it be impossible to find that in Joseon?

625
00:58:02,764 --> 00:58:05,194
Must I be reborn?

626
00:58:07,524 --> 00:58:09,624
Let me see...

627
00:59:44,504 --> 00:59:48,004
I did not know you were such a rich man, Eunuch.

628
00:59:48,004 --> 00:59:52,374
And I did not know that you were so full of love, my wife.

629
00:59:53,114 --> 00:59:54,514
 Father!

630
00:59:54,514 --> 00:59:56,464
Aigoo, my children.

631
00:59:56,464 --> 00:59:59,484
Aigoo, did you have a lot of fun?

632
00:59:59,484 --> 01:00:01,324
It is nice to have a father, right?

633
01:00:01,324 --> 01:00:02,374
Yes!

634
01:00:02,374 --> 01:00:05,514
It's a lot better than when you were living in Affection Village, right?

635
01:00:05,514 --> 01:00:07,044
Yes!

636
01:00:07,044 --> 01:00:09,990
Now we are all family.

637
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:19,840
The bride will now bow.

638
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:25,484
The groom will bow in response.

639
01:00:25,484 --> 01:00:28,534
Look over there!

640
01:00:28,534 --> 01:00:31,094
You have waited a long time for this, my son!

641
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:31,834
You look handsome!

642
01:00:31,834 --> 01:00:33,794
Finally, I am marrying her off.

643
01:00:33,794 --> 01:00:37,394
Gosh, so pretty...

644
01:00:37,394 --> 01:00:39,544
My daughter is now getting married!

645
01:00:39,544 --> 01:00:41,034
Congratulations!

646
01:00:41,034 --> 01:00:42,314
Aigoo, hooray!

647
01:00:42,314 --> 01:00:44,304
Hooray!

648
01:00:44,304 --> 01:00:46,404
Hooray!

649
01:00:49,524 --> 01:00:52,244
We are in a time of sacred marriages now.

650
01:00:52,244 --> 01:00:55,300
This is all thanks to her majesty the courageous and benevolent queen

651
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:59,030
ending the Marriage Ban era.

652
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:08,634
S-Sacred Marriage!

653
01:01:08,634 --> 01:01:13,234
Goodness... what a foreign word to us...

654
01:01:21,834 --> 01:01:23,464
What brings you here at such a late hour?

655
01:01:23,464 --> 01:01:26,494
I mean, the  Marriage Ban is now over,

656
01:01:26,494 --> 01:01:28,944
so how come we cannot find anyone?

657
01:01:28,944 --> 01:01:30,874
Is not the world being too mean to us?

658
01:01:30,874 --> 01:01:32,144
Then, what did you think?

659
01:01:32,144 --> 01:01:33,564
Did you think that when the Marriage Ban ends,

660
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:35,804
a woman would just fall from the sky, right into your lap?

661
01:01:35,804 --> 01:01:36,894
We did...

662
01:01:36,894 --> 01:01:40,404
If you want to gain a person's heart, you need to put in the effort!

663
01:01:40,404 --> 01:01:42,344
If you keep just moping around like that,

664
01:01:42,344 --> 01:01:43,664
you will grow old as a Born Sul Ro,

665
01:01:43,664 --> 01:01:47,644
and ascend to the heavens with a cintamani* in your mouth. 
 (a wish-fulfilling jewel within Hindu and Buddhist traditions)

666
01:01:47,644 --> 01:01:52,014
So, I am telling you to go out with an open heart

667
01:01:52,014 --> 01:01:54,904
and look around for an opportunity.

668
01:01:54,904 --> 01:01:57,764
You never know when and where love might find you.

669
01:01:57,764 --> 01:02:01,434
I have not found anyone that I like that much yet, either...

670
01:02:01,434 --> 01:02:03,104
But what if the Marriage Ban Edict returns?

671
01:02:03,104 --> 01:02:04,374
Oh! No!

672
01:02:04,374 --> 01:02:07,984
If you really cannot find anyone, then how about you two be together!

673
01:02:07,984 --> 01:02:11,464
I will tell you in detail about how that works.

674
01:02:12,264 --> 01:02:15,074
Gosh! No way!

675
01:02:20,304 --> 01:02:22,234
Buy your furs!

676
01:02:25,484 --> 01:02:28,054
Buy your furs!

677
01:02:31,704 --> 01:02:33,124
Come and look!

678
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:35,634
Buy your furs!

679
01:02:47,684 --> 01:02:52,374
 Before another Marriage Ban Edict falls on this nation,

680
01:02:52,374 --> 01:02:57,434
 before the days where love and marriage is prohibited returns,

681
01:02:57,434 --> 01:03:02,624
 I say to all of the people for today and tomorrow,

682
01:03:02,624 --> 01:03:06,300
 you must So Rang.* 
(Sounds like "sarang", which is love in Korean)

683
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:26,204
Come here, Your Majesty.

684
01:03:29,644 --> 01:03:31,774
That is good.

685
01:03:36,284 --> 01:03:38,964
But is it proper to just let him draw the portrait of the king like this?

686
01:03:38,964 --> 01:03:41,454
It is great.  It's a commemoration.

687
01:03:41,454 --> 01:03:44,334
And most importantly, in Painter Jeong's next work,

688
01:03:44,334 --> 01:03:46,374
characters that resemble us are going to appear,

689
01:03:46,374 --> 01:03:48,524
so we should actively cooperate with him.

690
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:50,534
Smile.

691
01:03:56,434 --> 01:03:58,694
- Could you get a bit closer to each other?
 - I don't want to do it.

692
01:03:58,694 --> 01:04:01,414
Will we be able to finish by today at this rate?

693
01:04:01,414 --> 01:04:04,224
Who knew they would have so much trouble with stationary poses?

694
01:04:04,224 --> 01:04:06,624
You know, there are poses like this.

695
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:11,074
How about something like this?

696
01:04:11,704 --> 01:04:14,574
My Lady, I am sorry,

697
01:04:16,684 --> 01:04:19,794
but it appears we need to be like this for us to finish quickly.

698
01:04:27,444 --> 01:04:31,534
We should get used to this by the time this ends, right?

699
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,184
Who knows.

700
01:04:33,184 --> 01:04:35,134
All right, next.

701
01:04:38,734 --> 01:04:40,634
All right.

702
01:04:45,954 --> 01:04:48,274
They look handsome.

703
01:04:48,274 --> 01:04:50,304
We are not late, are we?

704
01:04:50,304 --> 01:04:52,814
Children, let us go in.

705
01:04:59,514 --> 01:05:03,990
Instead of doing it like this, shall we all stand together?

706
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,744
But what is the name of the new work

707
01:05:27,744 --> 01:05:31,654
that you have his majesty here for this painting?

708

 The Forbidden Marriage

727
01:07:02,444 --> 01:07:04,854
Hanyang was this big?

728
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:07,094
It is so big!

729
01:07:07,804 --> 01:07:09,814
You know what?

730
01:07:10,714 --> 01:07:15,774
There was a time when all young men and women could not get married.

731
01:07:15,774 --> 01:07:19,034
But there are so many houses and people here!

732
01:07:19,034 --> 01:07:22,604
It was not only here but across the land of Joseon.

733
01:07:26,424 --> 01:07:29,744
But do you know me?

734
01:07:31,074 --> 01:07:35,504
Seeing your clothes are of expensive fabric, you look like a young lady of the royal family.

735
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:38,914
Then how come you are talking to me without honorifics, even though you know?

736
01:07:38,914 --> 01:07:41,304
It is pretty obvious that I am your orabeoni.

737
01:07:41,304 --> 01:07:44,034
Orabeoni, my foot.

738
01:07:44,034 --> 01:07:46,114
We should just be friends.

739
01:07:46,114 --> 01:07:50,054
My father told me not to be friends with girls.

740
01:07:50,054 --> 01:07:54,474
He said that becoming friends with girls is the start of all tragedies.

741
01:07:57,274 --> 01:08:00,664
I just wanted to say that you are really pretty.

742
01:08:03,214 --> 01:08:04,904
My name is Min Wu.

743
01:08:04,904 --> 01:08:07,504
What is your name?

744
01:08:07,504 --> 01:08:09,954
My name is...

745
01:08:09,954 --> 01:08:11,824
Ri Yun.

746
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:26,400
