00:00:35,304 --> 00:00:39,714
 This is a work of fiction. Characters, incidents, settings, titles, and content have no relevance to real life.

2
00:00:39,714 --> 00:00:46,750

3
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,854
Your Majesty. Are you all right?

4
00:01:45,854 --> 00:01:47,414
Y-Yes.

5
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,244
Oh, um...There were small flying bugs...

6
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:54,384
Dang it, these flying bugs...Bugs, bugs...

7
00:01:54,384 --> 00:01:55,964
Goodness.

8
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,554
It is late.

9
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,264
Go inside.

10
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,804
Yes.

11
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,690
Argh! Seriously!

12
00:03:13,384 --> 00:03:15,674
I must be crazy.

13
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,170
 Episode 2

14
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,140
Old man. Hae Yeong.

15
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,894
Eonni!

16
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:33,284
Eonni, I am glad you made it back safely!

17
00:03:33,284 --> 00:03:37,444
I was worried you might be punished for fraud with flogging,

18
00:03:37,444 --> 00:03:39,954
leg-twisting, and face-branding.

19
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:43,264
Prison, my foot. Aigoo. She is coming from the palace.

20
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,724
What?

21
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,814
Old man. If you knew all this beforehand, then you should have told me!

22
00:03:48,814 --> 00:03:51,004
And that is why I told you not to commit fraud in the city!

23
00:03:51,004 --> 00:03:53,664
If you say it like that, of course I would not understand.

24
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:58,444
That fraud has now...Now...Really...

25
00:03:58,444 --> 00:04:02,680
You will now be working in the palace.

26
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:06,054
Excuse me? W-Why would I?

27
00:04:06,054 --> 00:04:11,694
Did you not say that if the king has anything to say to her highness the crown princess, you will deliver the message to her?

28
00:04:11,694 --> 00:04:14,144
It seems I will have to act as a court lady from now.

29
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:18,754
Why? Did you lie to them, saying that you were a court lady? With your appearance?

30
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,964
If you went to the palace, did you also get to see the king? How was he? How was he?

31
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,734
Hae Yeong.

32
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:30,844
The king is a crazy bastard.

33
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:33,060
- He is completely nuts. 
 - What?

34
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,364
Everyone goes crazy with how handsome the kings are in all the romance novels I've read.

35
00:04:38,364 --> 00:04:42,304
He tells me to channel the spirit of the crown princess, who died seven years ago.

36
00:04:42,304 --> 00:04:45,934
But the problem is that I need to keep acting as the crown princess.

37
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:48,284
Not only that, I will be entering as an inner court lady.

38
00:04:48,284 --> 00:04:50,574
What do I do? If I cannot do this, he will probably have me killed.

39
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:53,894
I mean, how do I know what a person who died seven years ago is like?

40
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:57,544
My head hurts... Oh, my head...Ow...

41
00:04:57,544 --> 00:05:02,594
He must be so desperate. How lonely must he be to miss a dead person so much?

42
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,334
Then what do I do? Do I keep acting as the spirit of a dead person?

43
00:05:05,334 --> 00:05:07,564
You need to help him forget her, even if it means deceiving him.

44
00:05:07,564 --> 00:05:12,044
Do you think that will be possible? He seems to have that woman completely buried in his heart. Really deeply.

45
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:13,754
Dig her out, and give her a burial.

46
00:05:13,754 --> 00:05:15,654
- Me?
 - Ha!

47
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:20,004
Hey, is there anyone in Joseon who can lie as you can? The greatest liar in Joseon.

48
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,714
Hello!

49
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:44,164
You are pretty handsome.

50
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,824
What business do you have with me?

51
00:05:46,824 --> 00:05:48,764
What business?

52
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:53,964
Oh, I am Gwaeng Yi, a compatibility reader who works at Aedaldang with So Rang.

53
00:05:53,964 --> 00:05:57,834
I am also pretty talented in channeling.

54
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,564
Please keep quiet

55
00:06:00,564 --> 00:06:05,294
if you feel like someone has a secret.

56
00:06:05,294 --> 00:06:09,524
- Excuse me?
 - If you do not, they might fly away like a butterfly

57
00:06:09,524 --> 00:06:15,504
for fear of their secret being revealed.

58
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,674
Why are you looking at me like that? You might give me the flutters!

59
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,904
And come visit Aedaldang often so my eyes can get their fill. Here.

60
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,694
I will give you some willow tea for free.

61
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,534
- Let go of me! I told you to let go of me!
 - Husband!

62
00:06:51,534 --> 00:06:52,780
Do not worry, Wife!

63
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,200
No, you cannot do this! No, you cannot do this! No!

64
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,684
Wife!

65
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,114
I am not afraid of going to prison,

66
00:07:00,114 --> 00:07:04,034
but being separated from my husband is the worst hell on earth.

67
00:07:04,034 --> 00:07:06,594
Please, please send me to the same place.

68
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:08,084
Who is your husband?

69
00:07:08,084 --> 00:07:10,634
Do you not know the Marriage Ban Edict? The law prohibiting marriages?

70
00:07:10,634 --> 00:07:12,774
A secret marriage, my foot. Drag her away!

71
00:07:12,774 --> 00:07:14,554
No, you cannot do this!

72
00:07:14,554 --> 00:07:16,094
Wife! Let go of me!

73
00:07:16,094 --> 00:07:19,864
Husband! Husband!

74
00:07:19,864 --> 00:07:21,214
So, make sure you do this one well.

75
00:07:21,214 --> 00:07:23,754
What, deceiving the king?

76
00:07:23,754 --> 00:07:26,294
That's the only way the marriage ban will end!

77
00:07:26,294 --> 00:07:30,784
The marriage ban...depends on my lies, I see.

78
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,414
I guess you've done things like that, Chief.

79
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,724
All right!

80
00:07:41,724 --> 00:07:44,344
Come take a look at this!

81
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:46,430
What about the bottom one?

82
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,310
The price has been marked down.

83
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,704
Stop.

84
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:45,824
 Look, we have nice pears!

85
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:54,594
I do not know what you have been doing that you have so many people to avoid, but—

86
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,464
I am not someone who needs to avoid anyone.

87
00:08:59,464 --> 00:09:01,064
Please...

88
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,794
Although I am currently responsible as your bodyguard, I am a sixth-level official as a Royal Investigation Bureau chief.

89
00:09:09,794 --> 00:09:12,714
If you tell me what's going on, I will—

90
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,550
 Seo Wun Jeong, 2nd concubine to (now dead) Mr. Ye

91
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,514
Hurry, hurry!

92
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,264
What are you doing right now?

93
00:09:54,264 --> 00:09:57,904
Can you just shut up and run? If you do not, I will just run away!

94
00:09:57,904 --> 00:09:59,494
Wait!

95
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,744
Let us go.

96
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,484
It cannot be her, can it?

97
00:10:15,344 --> 00:10:18,774
 Are you saying there will be a marriage ban in this nation?

98
00:10:18,774 --> 00:10:21,604
 If that is true,

99
00:10:21,604 --> 00:10:24,214
 then my Hyeon Hui will miss her marriage timing.

100
00:10:24,214 --> 00:10:25,844
 That is ridiculous.

101
00:10:25,844 --> 00:10:28,014
 According to an itinerant compatibility reader,

102
00:10:28,014 --> 00:10:29,944
 this ban will last seven years.

103
00:10:29,944 --> 00:10:33,294
 If I have to live alone for that long, then I should even

104
00:10:33,294 --> 00:10:35,644
 dig up my dead husband from his grave.

105
00:10:35,644 --> 00:10:38,764
 In a situation where you would even beg for the dead to come back to life,

106
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:41,384
 will it be difficult to push a live person over to death?

107
00:10:41,384 --> 00:10:43,644
 Are you going to feed Hyeon Seon poisoned porridge?

108
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,594
 Like you did with her mother?

109
00:10:45,594 --> 00:10:49,734
 No! That takes too long.

110
00:10:51,724 --> 00:10:55,284
 If there is something covering the sun,

111
00:10:55,284 --> 00:10:57,784
 don't you need to cut it off

112
00:10:57,784 --> 00:11:01,274
 so that the plant can flower?

113
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,014
 You must not leave any trace.

114
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:11,544
 I will tell her father that she ran away with a servant with whom she had an affair.

115
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:19,494
 Think of it as giving up your marriage partner to your younger sister.

116
00:11:19,494 --> 00:11:21,164
 What do you mean you haven't found her body?

117
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:23,034
 This is making me feel so uneasy.

118
00:11:23,034 --> 00:11:25,464
 I am sure she is dead.

119
00:11:26,914 --> 00:11:30,504
 Nobody would be able to survive a fall from that cliff.

120
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:34,024
Let us go.

121
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:55,594
 It is probably best that I enter the palace.

122
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:09,274
I cannot keep chiding him into getting married.

123
00:12:10,394 --> 00:12:14,884
But I also cannot just watch and do nothing.

124
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:21,214
This is only causing so much frustration for this old woman.

125
00:12:21,214 --> 00:12:25,344
You have me, so I told you not to worry.

126
00:12:32,264 --> 00:12:34,350
As you asked, here is the list

127
00:12:35,074 --> 00:12:38,924
of potential young ladies who would be fitting as a queen.

128
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:43,154
I have also been meeting and adding more young ladies who would be worthy

129
00:12:43,154 --> 00:12:45,134
of the Queen's Palace.

130
00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:47,190
Is that so?

131
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,410
 Name: Hwan Seo Bin

132
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,940
 Name: Cho Yun Hyeon

133
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:56,694
Then, I guess we can choose someone from this list.

134
00:12:56,694 --> 00:13:00,724
If you worry so much like this, you will only gain more wrinkles.

135
00:13:00,724 --> 00:13:03,264
I will make sure to manage and prepare whoever on that list becomes

136
00:13:03,264 --> 00:13:06,014
the mistress of the Queen's Palace,

137
00:13:06,014 --> 00:13:09,414
so that she is not lacking in any way.

138
00:13:21,324 --> 00:13:23,584
Wow, this is too...

139
00:13:23,584 --> 00:13:28,334
Aigoo. You tripped because you are moving about so restlessly!

140
00:13:28,334 --> 00:13:29,764
Violence is bad!

141
00:13:29,764 --> 00:13:31,554
Then should I put you through leg-screwing?

142
00:13:31,554 --> 00:13:33,474
If your presence is made known to the palace,

143
00:13:33,474 --> 00:13:36,734
we shall all be sentenced to having our limbs torn off.

144
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:40,214
Follow me quietly as if you were dead.

145
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:45,044
Why people in this palace say we are going to die every chance they get?

146
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:57,134
Court Lady Won, what is that for?

147
00:14:00,584 --> 00:14:05,934
What! Why are there so many customs?

148
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:08,004
How dare you sigh in front of me?

149
00:14:08,004 --> 00:14:10,694
When you are in front of his majesty, you must even quiet your breathing!

150
00:14:10,694 --> 00:14:12,974
Then should I not breathe at all, like a dead person?

151
00:14:12,974 --> 00:14:15,700
If you tell me that I cannot do this or that, then what can I actually do?

152
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,964
- You cannot talk back to me like that.
 - Aigoo!

153
00:14:17,964 --> 00:14:21,514
Do you think I want to become an inner court lady?

154
00:14:23,534 --> 00:14:27,154
I mean, I did want to try to be an inner court lady just once.

155
00:14:27,154 --> 00:14:29,924
From now on, your name is Sun Ah.

156
00:14:29,924 --> 00:14:34,534
- About what you used to do before entering the palace... Make sure you don't reveal anything. 
 - Yes.

157
00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:38,370
First, his majesty the king...

158
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,950
When his majesty is walking, do not step on his shadow.

159
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,530
You have to read all these books here,

160
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:45,310
to cultivate your body and mind. Memorize them all!

161
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,474
Do you understand? All right. Next, stand up.

162
00:14:48,474 --> 00:14:50,404
Your head should be like this, and your back like this.

163
00:14:50,404 --> 00:14:52,164
After you bow like this... Walk backward.

164
00:14:52,164 --> 00:14:54,294
You should not trip! You need a good beating to come to your senses, right?

165
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:56,194
Whoa, you should not be like that!

166
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:57,724
You need to be hit, don't you!

167
00:14:57,724 --> 00:14:59,904
Are you kneeling?

168
00:14:59,904 --> 00:15:01,434
I really need to go! I cannot do it right now.

169
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,034
Come here!

170
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:04,664
You cannot lift your butt like this.

171
00:15:04,664 --> 00:15:08,854
All right. These are the 100 rules you need to be especially aware of.

172
00:15:08,854 --> 00:15:11,694
Do you understand? Do you understand!

173
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:14,524
Excuse me? Oh, yes.

174
00:15:17,904 --> 00:15:21,854
Blood... I-I am bleeding.

175
00:15:23,304 --> 00:15:27,174
All right. It is now time for his majesty's supper.

176
00:15:27,174 --> 00:15:32,454
Will you be able to stand next to him like a shadow?

177
00:15:32,454 --> 00:15:36,244
I am... going to see his majesty right now?

178
00:15:43,884 --> 00:15:45,534
Wow...

179
00:16:02,994 --> 00:16:05,434
 He eats as if it is tasteless.

180
00:16:05,434 --> 00:16:07,484
 What are you, a goat?

181
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,664
Everyone, leave this room.

182
00:16:27,664 --> 00:16:29,274
Yes, Sire.

183
00:16:37,104 --> 00:16:38,894
You over there.

184
00:16:40,304 --> 00:16:42,324
Except you.

185
00:16:47,704 --> 00:16:51,824
Who made the rumbling noise from the stomach?

186
00:16:51,824 --> 00:16:55,574
The thing is... It is not something I can control...

187
00:16:55,574 --> 00:16:57,374
Whoa, that scared me!

188
00:16:57,374 --> 00:17:01,184
How dare you talk back to me? Have you not been trained yet?

189
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:04,714
Your Majesty, I came here to free you from the apparitions.

190
00:17:04,714 --> 00:17:07,604
However, if you cannot eat well like this, then your mind and body will grow weak

191
00:17:07,604 --> 00:17:10,234
and it will be more difficult for you to overcome the apparitions...

192
00:17:10,234 --> 00:17:12,304
This is what I hear all the time.

193
00:17:12,304 --> 00:17:18,034
So says... Her Royal Highness the crown princess.

194
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:19,974
My stupid mouth...

195
00:17:20,944 --> 00:17:22,934
The crown princess did?

196
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:25,624
Are you channeling her again?

197
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:32,004
It is not that, but I do hear her voice sometimes.

198
00:17:33,224 --> 00:17:34,714
What else does she want to tell me?

199
00:17:34,714 --> 00:17:38,344
Well... Oh, that you should eat your supper well,

200
00:17:38,344 --> 00:17:40,824
because watching you makes me lose my appetite...

201
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:44,774
That's what I seem... to be hearing, or not...

202
00:17:44,774 --> 00:17:48,514
It is a bit... You should go now, Your Highness.

203
00:17:48,514 --> 00:17:52,544
How dare you! How dare you send the crown princess away!

204
00:17:52,544 --> 00:17:56,094
- W-What was that? 
 - W-Why? What is it?

205
00:17:56,094 --> 00:17:58,034
You want us to eat together?

206
00:17:58,034 --> 00:18:01,694
Come on! No, that is not possible.

207
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:04,474
Why? Are you hungry?

208
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:07,654
Is the crown princess hungry?

209
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:11,074
How could a dead person be hungry? Only those who are alive are hungry.

210
00:18:11,074 --> 00:18:14,564
Her Highness tells me to eat with you, but I cannot as your servant.

211
00:18:14,564 --> 00:18:17,914
So call me when you are done eating. Let us go, Your Highness.

212
00:18:17,914 --> 00:18:19,510
Wait!

213
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:28,044
- Let's eat together.
 - Pardon?

214
00:18:28,044 --> 00:18:30,084
I said, let us eat together.

215
00:18:31,274 --> 00:18:33,250
Let me take some rice.

216
00:18:35,754 --> 00:18:37,324
All right.

217
00:18:47,514 --> 00:18:48,934
Aren't you going to eat?

218
00:18:48,934 --> 00:18:51,824
Yes... Yes, I will.

219
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:55,914
Oh, boiled pork!

220
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:27,764
- It is tasty, isn't it? 
 - Yes, it's good.

221
00:19:37,374 --> 00:19:40,334
Your Highness, I enjoyed the meal.

222
00:19:40,334 --> 00:19:43,010
You should go and rest now.

223
00:19:52,574 --> 00:19:54,514
For some reason,

224
00:19:54,514 --> 00:19:58,164
it feels like I just had a meal with the crown princess.

225
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,214
I am full... So full.

226
00:20:01,214 --> 00:20:05,664
 I knew it.  A person needs to eat well.

227
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:08,204
 If I feed him well and have him sleep well,

228
00:20:08,204 --> 00:20:11,174
 I would be recognized as setting him free from his apparitions, right?

229
00:20:16,574 --> 00:20:20,374
Did his majesty finish his entire supper?

230
00:20:24,874 --> 00:20:27,924
Since it is your first day, you may go now.

231
00:20:27,924 --> 00:20:29,594
Really?

232
00:20:31,734 --> 00:20:33,604
Let us go now.

233
00:21:04,944 --> 00:21:07,324
How did such a noble Royal Investigation Bureau Chief

234
00:21:07,324 --> 00:21:10,244
get caught up with a fraud like me...

235
00:21:12,944 --> 00:21:16,584
Will I not be taken away if he finds out that I deceived him?

236
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:18,254
Darn it...

237
00:21:21,084 --> 00:21:24,444
I should get him on my side first.

238
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:38,344
My lord. The night air is nice,

239
00:21:38,344 --> 00:21:40,824
so how about having a drink with me?

240
00:21:40,824 --> 00:21:42,904
Where did you manage to get the alcohol?

241
00:21:42,904 --> 00:21:46,224
The king's food handlers said they would throw out all the unrefined and refined rice wine,

242
00:21:46,224 --> 00:21:48,644
so I rushed over there and brought it with me.

243
00:21:48,644 --> 00:21:52,104
It is probably good for at least another seven days.

244
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:54,104
When did you manage to go there?

245
00:21:55,454 --> 00:21:59,014
Still, I am currently working right now.

246
00:21:59,014 --> 00:22:00,844
Wait.

247
00:22:00,844 --> 00:22:04,104
But is it not your workplace wherever you are with me?

248
00:22:05,854 --> 00:22:08,204
Hold onto this for a moment!

249
00:22:13,804 --> 00:22:15,844
Surprise!

250
00:22:38,894 --> 00:22:41,624
All right! Egg.

251
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:48,814
This is called a loyalty shot.

252
00:22:48,814 --> 00:22:52,804
With hearts full of loyalty towards our king...

253
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:58,524
- Drink.
 - Come on...

254
00:22:58,524 --> 00:23:00,744
I told you I would not drink.

255
00:23:02,864 --> 00:23:07,054
All right, then, this time, how about we pour alcohol into this cup

256
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:10,434
and the person to make this cup sink has to drink this entire thing.

257
00:23:10,434 --> 00:23:12,094
Is this how you played at home?

258
00:23:12,094 --> 00:23:17,264
As an itinerant peddler, what else would I do but drink?

259
00:23:17,264 --> 00:23:18,934
Here.

260
00:23:41,324 --> 00:23:43,174
I won!

261
00:23:45,334 --> 00:23:50,504
If you grant me one wish, I will drink half of the bowl for you.

262
00:23:50,504 --> 00:23:54,114
We call that Black Rose here.

263
00:23:54,114 --> 00:23:55,404
F-F-Forget it.

264
00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:57,654
How can a woman drink all this?

265
00:24:11,364 --> 00:24:14,024
My wish is...

266
00:24:14,024 --> 00:24:19,404
If you drink that entire thing, we will be friends, all right?

267
00:24:19,404 --> 00:24:22,974
I mean... I want to drop the honorifics.

268
00:24:22,974 --> 00:24:27,634
I understand that men and women are different, and there are differences in our age and class,

269
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:31,624
but I felt like we would never get close if we continue with honorifics.

270
00:24:41,884 --> 00:24:43,404
You are a bit more open than I thought.

271
00:24:43,404 --> 00:24:46,284
I thought you were all uptight.

272
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:49,764
However... only when we are by ourselves.

273
00:24:49,764 --> 00:24:54,914
But even if we drop the honorifics, shouldn't you call me "Orabeoni*" or something?
  (="older brother". The ancient equivalent of "oppa")

274
00:24:54,914 --> 00:24:56,614
- N-No?
 - Come on!

275
00:24:56,614 --> 00:24:59,324
Orabeoni? That would be so awkward.

276
00:24:59,324 --> 00:25:01,404
Then, you will call me by my name, Lee Sin Won, and be on even ground?

277
00:25:01,404 --> 00:25:03,974
If you want, I can call you by that.

278
00:25:03,974 --> 00:25:05,614
But...

279
00:25:06,484 --> 00:25:12,020
even though you are a Royal Investigation Bureau Chief, you would not arrest your friend, would you?

280
00:25:12,604 --> 00:25:13,794
Did you do something wrong?

281
00:25:13,794 --> 00:25:19,224
Even if I did something wrong, covering for me would be loyalty and friendship.

282
00:25:19,224 --> 00:25:20,874
Is that why you wanted to be friends?

283
00:25:20,874 --> 00:25:21,984
Don't you want to?

284
00:25:21,984 --> 00:25:23,814
Then should we just be strangers?

285
00:25:24,664 --> 00:25:26,514
No.

286
00:25:26,514 --> 00:25:29,024
Then since we became friends, I want to ask you one thing.

287
00:25:29,024 --> 00:25:32,170
- Yes?
 - Did you almost get married before?

288
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:40,804
I mean, did you not ever have a man to marry before? I mean, you said you moved around a lot.

289
00:25:40,804 --> 00:25:42,604
I see.

290
00:25:42,604 --> 00:25:44,684
So that was what you meant.

291
00:25:44,684 --> 00:25:45,814
I did.

292
00:25:45,814 --> 00:25:49,494
There was a whole line of men wanting to marry me.

293
00:25:49,494 --> 00:25:52,424
But if I got married, you would have arrested me, no?

294
00:25:52,424 --> 00:25:57,104
- Then, before the Marriage Ban Edict was declared, what did you do? 
 - What?

295
00:25:58,284 --> 00:26:00,364
- I was a beggar.
 - What?

296
00:26:00,364 --> 00:26:04,674
Honestly, I do not know how I was born, nor who I am.

297
00:26:04,674 --> 00:26:06,694
My family utterly abandoned me.

298
00:26:06,694 --> 00:26:11,204
Then, I met the old man Gwaeng Yi on the street, so I started learning compatibility reading.

299
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,814
Oh, I see...

300
00:26:13,814 --> 00:26:17,084
No wonder you had a needy look.

301
00:26:17,084 --> 00:26:19,674
 This bastard!

302
00:26:19,674 --> 00:26:23,484
In any case, it is a painful past for me, so do not ask me anymore about it.

303
00:26:23,484 --> 00:26:27,494
Oh, and please keep the fact that I was a beggar a secret.

304
00:26:28,264 --> 00:26:29,284
 Wait.

305
00:26:29,284 --> 00:26:31,504
 The fact that he believes me so easily makes me angry.

306
00:26:31,504 --> 00:26:34,094
But ... why are you asking me that?

307
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:36,074
Why are you asking if I almost got married?

308
00:26:37,004 --> 00:26:43,294
Honestly, I almost married... the eldest daughter of Minister of Personnel,  His Excellency Ye Hyeon Ho.

309
00:26:48,784 --> 00:26:50,954
 I go to see her.

310
00:26:50,954 --> 00:26:53,044
 I don't go to see her.

311
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:55,404
 I go to see her.

312
00:26:55,404 --> 00:26:57,314
 - I do not go to see her.
 - We've packed everything, right?

313
00:26:57,314 --> 00:26:59,214
 Yes.

314
00:26:59,214 --> 00:27:03,344
 Young Master, we will be on our way.

315
00:27:03,344 --> 00:27:05,274
 Let's go!

316
00:27:05,274 --> 00:27:06,954
 Wait!

317
00:27:09,274 --> 00:27:10,854
 Wait.

318
00:27:10,854 --> 00:27:17,974
♫  I will sing of my feelings  ♫

319
00:27:17,974 --> 00:27:19,394
 Hello.

320
00:27:20,844 --> 00:27:23,234
 All right, let us go inside.

321
00:27:23,234 --> 00:27:34,560
♫  I heard your humming voice from afar  ♫

322
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:44,684
♫  What shall I do with my feelings for you?  ♫

323
00:27:47,024 --> 00:27:49,004
 Come on, why!

324
00:27:49,004 --> 00:27:50,594
 Come on!

325
00:27:50,594 --> 00:27:52,304
 For now, bring them to me.

326
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:54,134
 I just want to see them!

327
00:27:54,134 --> 00:27:57,914
 - Is it her? 
 - My Lady, those are the flower slippers that Lady Hyeon Seon will wear for her wedding.

328
00:27:57,914 --> 00:27:59,484
 You should not covet that as well.

329
00:27:59,484 --> 00:28:01,364
 - She is just a kid.
 - Covet?

330
00:28:01,364 --> 00:28:02,444
 Who?

331
00:28:02,444 --> 00:28:03,434
 Me?

332
00:28:03,434 --> 00:28:06,534
 Aigoo! Who said I was going to steal them or throw them away?

333
00:28:06,534 --> 00:28:08,604
 Aishh!

334
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:10,474
 I told you I would just take a look!

335
00:28:10,474 --> 00:28:12,904
 So annoying! Hurry up and bring them!

336
00:28:12,904 --> 00:28:16,944
 If her personality is to treat her servants like that...

337
00:28:29,064 --> 00:28:31,504
 What is with this sudden peach blossom fragrance?

338
00:28:39,514 --> 00:28:41,704
 Is it that lady?

339
00:28:47,004 --> 00:28:58,524
♫  Would you know my feelings for you?  ♫

340
00:28:58,524 --> 00:29:10,160
♫  Those swaying flower petals  ♫

341
00:29:15,314 --> 00:29:16,934
 Moon,

342
00:29:17,844 --> 00:29:20,404
 am I really getting married?

343
00:29:20,404 --> 00:29:23,354
  Marriage Letter* 
  (Official letter from the groom's family to the bride's family)

344
00:29:29,304 --> 00:29:34,934
 The willow tree family's firstborn son, Lee Sin Won.

345
00:29:34,934 --> 00:29:38,714
 Are you really going to be my groom?

346
00:29:41,794 --> 00:29:44,304
 Ahhh, what do I do...

347
00:29:44,304 --> 00:29:47,884
 After my wedding, I will have to live separated from my father.

348
00:29:47,884 --> 00:29:51,794
 But in place of your father, you will gain a husband.

349
00:29:51,794 --> 00:29:57,604
 Shall I be able to perform my role well as daughter-in-law?

350
00:29:59,434 --> 00:30:05,344
 - I will protect you so it is not too difficult for you. 
 - Wait...

351
00:30:05,344 --> 00:30:09,854
 Once the wedding ceremony is over, would that very night become my first night?

352
00:30:11,764 --> 00:30:14,774
 Even that, I will take care of—

353
00:30:15,544 --> 00:30:18,754
 I heard that the groom is very handsome.

354
00:30:19,504 --> 00:30:20,624
 Oh well...

355
00:30:20,624 --> 00:30:23,404
 I guess the word has reached all the way here already.

356
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:30,444
 I really hope that my husband is someone whom I can love and respect all my life.

357
00:30:30,444 --> 00:30:32,160
 I promise

358
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,714
 I will be that kind of husband.

359
00:30:35,284 --> 00:30:37,214
 Oh, Su Hyang.

360
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:44,174
 Lady Hyeon Hui asks to see the flower slippers we bought earlier.

361
00:30:46,404 --> 00:30:50,374
 Well... if they go into Hyeon Hui's hands, would they ever return to me?

362
00:30:50,374 --> 00:30:54,634
 If I go back empty-handed, things will become difficult for me...

363
00:30:54,634 --> 00:30:56,324
 Wait.

364
00:31:01,814 --> 00:31:03,684
 Here.

365
00:31:03,684 --> 00:31:05,534
 These are better ones.

366
00:31:05,534 --> 00:31:06,904
 Show them to Hyeon Hui.

367
00:31:06,904 --> 00:31:10,494
 No, actually, just tell her to keep them.

368
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,394
 My lady...

369
00:31:12,394 --> 00:31:14,514
 You did not get to eat anything yet, right?

370
00:31:14,514 --> 00:31:16,114
 Come here.

371
00:31:16,614 --> 00:31:18,594
 Eat this, at least.

372
00:31:20,424 --> 00:31:21,714
 Yes.

373
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:23,454
 You are going through so much.

374
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:06,744
 What is this?

375
00:32:06,744 --> 00:32:13,694
♫  Flower petals are falling white tonight  ♫

376
00:32:13,694 --> 00:32:26,284
♫  I wonder if you think of me as well  ♫

377
00:32:40,864 --> 00:32:50,650
♫  The flowers that bloom in my heart  ♫

378
00:32:51,744 --> 00:32:55,474
You saw the face of the woman who was supposed to be your bride?

379
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:58,784
But at the wedding...

380
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:12,054
 The Minister of Personnel Lord Ye Hyeon Ho's eldest daughter, Ye Hyeon Seon.

381
00:33:13,854 --> 00:33:22,210
 The Chief State Councillor, His Excellency Lee Jeong Hak's firstborn son, Lee Sin Won.

382
00:33:22,784 --> 00:33:27,064
 First, greet the groom.

383
00:33:39,174 --> 00:33:42,454
 I told you I would just take a look!

384
00:33:45,154 --> 00:33:47,934
 What is going on? They switched the bride?

385
00:33:47,934 --> 00:33:50,734
 Aren't they beautiful?

386
00:33:50,734 --> 00:33:53,374
 How nice...

387
00:33:59,134 --> 00:34:02,934
 Are you really my bride?

388
00:34:08,604 --> 00:34:09,594
 What is he talking about?

389
00:34:09,594 --> 00:34:12,314
 What happened to my real bride?

390
00:34:12,314 --> 00:34:13,684
 What is he talking about?

391
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:14,804
 T-T-That is...

392
00:34:14,804 --> 00:34:17,644
 Where is my real bride?

393
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:22,464
 Everyone, stop!

394
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,424
 Hey, what is going on?

395
00:34:32,464 --> 00:34:35,624
 Starting today, the Marriage Ban Edict is in effect in this country.

396
00:34:35,624 --> 00:34:37,534
 What do you mean by that?

397
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:43,284
 From now on, girls between the ages of 13 to 18 cannot marry.

398
00:34:43,284 --> 00:34:46,074
Your wedding was canceled?

399
00:34:46,074 --> 00:34:50,654
At my wedding, my bride was gone and her younger sister was sitting there instead.

400
00:34:50,654 --> 00:34:55,204
After that, I searched far and wide for my bride.

401
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,554
I told my family that I was going to do martial arts training.

402
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,014
 Well, that was not necessarily false,

403
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:03,274
since I spent my time training with the sword whenever I had stray thoughts.

404
00:35:04,474 --> 00:35:09,554
I wanted to become an investigator, because I thought this would help me find my bride.

405
00:35:09,554 --> 00:35:13,764
Well, do you remember her face?

406
00:35:14,214 --> 00:35:16,284
Not sure.

407
00:35:16,284 --> 00:35:18,464
You do not, right?

408
00:35:20,434 --> 00:35:24,464
I forgot her face, but I remember her scent.

409
00:35:24,464 --> 00:35:27,484
A light pink peach blossom fragrance.

410
00:35:29,714 --> 00:35:33,304
Come on! That is a very common fragrance, you know?

411
00:35:33,304 --> 00:35:36,474
Literally, almost every woman has an incense sachet with that fragrance.

412
00:35:36,474 --> 00:35:38,844
You will not be able to find her with that.

413
00:35:40,294 --> 00:35:41,394
You are probably right.

414
00:35:41,394 --> 00:35:42,884
After all, I don't have a dog's nose.

415
00:35:42,884 --> 00:35:48,284
Right. You are pretty smart, so why are you depending on such an ignorant method?

416
00:35:48,284 --> 00:35:50,634
And you are an investigator as well.

417
00:35:50,634 --> 00:35:54,534
In any case, it is probably best that you forget her quickly.

418
00:35:54,534 --> 00:35:57,104
Look at the king. Seven years of faithful love?

419
00:35:57,104 --> 00:35:59,664
The entire nation is badmouthing him.

420
00:35:59,664 --> 00:36:00,644
You already know.

421
00:36:00,644 --> 00:36:02,824
If I forget her,

422
00:36:04,514 --> 00:36:07,124
would I be able to love another woman?

423
00:36:13,884 --> 00:36:17,964
Then you would have to arrest yourself.

424
00:36:24,494 --> 00:36:27,604
Gosh, I am cold now. Let us go inside now.

425
00:36:30,174 --> 00:36:31,884
Ye Hyeon Seon.

426
00:36:40,714 --> 00:36:44,654
Her name is Ye Hyeon Seon. The name of my bride who went missing.

427
00:36:48,174 --> 00:36:51,624
Do you... recognize that name by chance?

428
00:36:57,574 --> 00:36:59,094
No.

429
00:37:00,254 --> 00:37:05,014
 Please keep quiet if you feel like someone has a secret.

430
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:08,914
 If you do not, they might fly away like a butterfly

431
00:37:08,914 --> 00:37:14,194
 for fear of their secret being found out.

432
00:37:18,254 --> 00:37:19,914
I am starting to feel the alcohol.

433
00:37:19,914 --> 00:37:22,344
I should hurry inside and go to sleep.

434
00:38:01,095 --> 00:38:02,965
Ten days ago, at an inn in Yanghwajin,

435
00:38:02,965 --> 00:38:06,975
a man appeared saying that he had killed the crown princess.

436
00:38:06,975 --> 00:38:09,395
And so, we are currently tracking him down.

437
00:38:09,395 --> 00:38:10,795
An inn...

438
00:38:10,795 --> 00:38:13,265
We drew a picture of his appearance based on the inn keeper's testimony

439
00:38:13,265 --> 00:38:15,205
and sent it to the Royal Investigation Bureau.

440
00:38:15,205 --> 00:38:18,235
And we are inspecting all the inns in Hanyang without notice,

441
00:38:18,235 --> 00:38:21,465
and checking the names and appearances of the people every day.

442
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:25,745
Then, will we be able to catch him?

443
00:38:36,895 --> 00:38:39,045
It's a crime to dishonor the crown princess of this nation.

444
00:38:39,045 --> 00:38:41,665
Do you think you could wash away this guilt in hell?

445
00:38:43,205 --> 00:38:45,365
More than the retribution of the Grim Reaper,

446
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:49,955
I fear for the future of Joseon stumbling because of one girl.

447
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:55,145
How could you say... that this is patriotism?

448
00:39:09,135 --> 00:39:12,825
I must reveal that the crown princess' death was murder, not suicide.

449
00:39:12,825 --> 00:39:15,415
Thus, we must also make sure to catch

450
00:39:15,415 --> 00:39:18,145
the person who was behind this!

451
00:39:36,305 --> 00:39:39,195
Is anyone out there?

452
00:39:39,195 --> 00:39:42,695
He woke up again...

453
00:39:43,955 --> 00:39:46,135
I will try going in.

454
00:39:50,035 --> 00:39:52,835
How do I get him to fall asleep this time?

455
00:39:59,495 --> 00:40:01,925
Aigoo.

456
00:40:01,925 --> 00:40:04,155
Why are you unable to fall asleep again?

457
00:40:04,155 --> 00:40:06,525
Oh, yes.

458
00:40:06,525 --> 00:40:09,395
Is the crown princess here by any chance?

459
00:40:10,985 --> 00:40:12,325
No.

460
00:40:15,085 --> 00:40:18,205
Gosh, what is that sound?

461
00:40:19,735 --> 00:40:22,565
So you are able to hear this sound.

462
00:40:29,145 --> 00:40:32,155
 Old man! Did you call me?

463
00:40:33,065 --> 00:40:35,405
 You can hear this sound?

464
00:40:35,405 --> 00:40:37,115
 I was over on that mountain, and I heard it.

465
00:40:37,115 --> 00:40:39,555
 Only animals can hear this sound.

466
00:40:39,555 --> 00:40:41,025
 Are you an animal?

467
00:40:41,025 --> 00:40:43,175
 You didn't call me, then?

468
00:40:46,275 --> 00:40:50,275
Is the apparition making this sound?

469
00:40:56,155 --> 00:40:59,965
I see there is a petty ghost in this palace somewhere.

470
00:40:59,965 --> 00:41:05,025
Instead of doing this, let us go together and find out where this sound is coming from.

471
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:12,905
Sure, some exercise is the best way of putting him down to bed.

472
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,455
Walk ahead of me.

473
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:21,595
Your Majesty, that would make me a disloyal servant.

474
00:41:21,595 --> 00:41:24,045
I have been learning some things lately...

475
00:41:24,045 --> 00:41:25,525
Then, walk next to me.

476
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:28,395
That would also be disloyal.

477
00:41:38,275 --> 00:41:40,085
Are you afraid?

478
00:41:40,995 --> 00:41:42,835
Afraid?

479
00:41:43,895 --> 00:41:45,385
Ribbit.

480
00:41:46,255 --> 00:41:47,905
Yes, go ahead.

481
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,265
It is a frog.

482
00:41:49,265 --> 00:41:51,885
Are you afraid of frogs, Your Majesty?

483
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:53,385
Did you summon me?

484
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,845
So Rang may channel the spirit again when she's with his majesty,

485
00:41:55,845 --> 00:41:59,445
so he asked for the other guardsmen to be dismissed.

486
00:42:01,985 --> 00:42:04,545
- Please go ahead.
 - Stand next to me.

487
00:42:04,545 --> 00:42:05,965
Wasn't it you who made that sound?

488
00:42:05,965 --> 00:42:07,755
No, I did not.

489
00:42:14,595 --> 00:42:18,655
 Who's making this sound to scare his majesty?

490
00:42:23,635 --> 00:42:25,795
Is So Rang here?

491
00:42:26,695 --> 00:42:28,515
Yes, Your Majesty!

492
00:42:34,045 --> 00:42:36,095
Is it the crown princess?

493
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,515
No, Sire.

494
00:42:38,405 --> 00:42:40,375
It's the water ghost.

495
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:44,535
I think some mountain animal has drowned.

496
00:42:45,265 --> 00:42:47,215
Then, can you lead the spirit to heaven?

497
00:42:47,215 --> 00:42:48,715
Oh, no...

498
00:42:48,715 --> 00:42:51,085
It's only a petty ghost.

499
00:42:51,085 --> 00:42:53,825
No life dies without a story to tell.

500
00:42:53,825 --> 00:42:59,405
Since you came in here as an exorcist to drive out apparitions, send that water spirit to a good place.

501
00:42:59,405 --> 00:43:01,895
Now, I have to get rid of this sound, too?

502
00:43:01,895 --> 00:43:03,375
Could you do it?

503
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:05,285
Yes, Your Majesty.

504
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:11,485
 Gosh, this isn't enough exercise for him.

505
00:43:11,485 --> 00:43:14,375
 He'll never fall asleep at this rate.

506
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:26,265
But Your Majesty, the fact that you could hear sounds like this

507
00:43:26,265 --> 00:43:28,705
means that your heart and body have weakened a lot.

508
00:43:28,705 --> 00:43:32,375
But the problem is that I could actually see that.

509
00:43:35,105 --> 00:43:37,415
You must not exercise, Sire.

510
00:43:37,415 --> 00:43:40,075
For a man...

511
00:43:41,105 --> 00:43:43,035
his body is everything.

512
00:43:52,685 --> 00:43:54,375
H-He looks pretty good, huh?

513
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:55,635
His muscles are all for show.

514
00:43:55,635 --> 00:43:58,565
A man should be strong and firm on the inside.

515
00:43:58,565 --> 00:43:59,515
Can you defeat him?

516
00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:01,505
- You think I'd lose?
 - Come on...

517
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:03,995
Chief Lee Sin Won is a military officer.

518
00:44:03,995 --> 00:44:06,475
I think he'll be a great fighter.

519
00:44:06,475 --> 00:44:10,105
I used to win my fights, too!

520
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,225
- I used to.
 - I'm sure people lost to you on purpose.

521
00:44:12,225 --> 00:44:15,395
- Haven't you heard of a loyalty match?
 - Loyalty match?

522
00:44:19,335 --> 00:44:21,465
Sin Won!

523
00:44:26,925 --> 00:44:30,015
Shall we warm up a bit for first time in a while?

524
00:44:33,415 --> 00:44:36,450
But why all of a sudden at this late hour?

525
00:44:37,085 --> 00:44:40,765
In our past matches, have you ever gone easy on me?

526
00:44:40,765 --> 00:44:42,175
No, Sire.

527
00:44:42,175 --> 00:44:43,555
No, Your Majesty.

528
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:44,815
You have, I see.

529
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:46,315
But that was so long ago.

530
00:44:46,315 --> 00:44:48,505
I see.

531
00:44:48,505 --> 00:44:50,145
Is that so?

532
00:44:52,515 --> 00:44:55,715
Your Majesty, hold it a little higher.

533
00:44:57,815 --> 00:44:59,675
Why? So you can go easy on me again?

534
00:45:01,355 --> 00:45:03,705
Then, shall I defeat you, Your Majesty?

535
00:45:13,555 --> 00:45:15,325
Oh, my!

536
00:45:18,095 --> 00:45:19,155
Hey.

537
00:45:19,155 --> 00:45:22,205
Are you not... going to do this properly?

538
00:45:22,205 --> 00:45:23,775
It hurts, Your Majesty.

539
00:45:23,775 --> 00:45:27,475
All this time, did you see me as your friend or a king you must serve?

540
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,915
- I believed I was being proper. 
 - What?

541
00:45:29,915 --> 00:45:32,975
To hide your rusty skills.

542
00:45:32,975 --> 00:45:34,715
Rusty, huh?

543
00:45:53,965 --> 00:45:58,445
Of course. The most entertaining thing in the world is watching a fight.

544
00:46:01,785 --> 00:46:04,775
- Oh, my goodness...
 - That Sin Won!

545
00:46:17,435 --> 00:46:19,945
Oh, this is so fun! Is there any makgeolli*? 
  (Korean rice liquor)

546
00:46:19,945 --> 00:46:21,475
It'd be perfect if I could have some makgeolli...

547
00:46:21,475 --> 00:46:24,585
Just one glass of—

548
00:46:24,585 --> 00:46:25,895
I'm sorry.

549
00:46:25,895 --> 00:46:29,095
How could she be so happy after putting us up against each other?

550
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:34,265
Aigoo...

551
00:46:43,935 --> 00:46:46,575
 - Your Majesty! 
 - Your Majesty!

552
00:46:47,705 --> 00:46:50,075
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

553
00:46:51,915 --> 00:46:53,455
Get off me!

554
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,820
Of course.

555
00:47:04,445 --> 00:47:07,015
Do this next time as well.

556
00:47:07,015 --> 00:47:11,775
- Pardon? 
 - Will you see me as your friend or as your king?

557
00:47:15,665 --> 00:47:17,585
Don't let me win.

558
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:19,885
I will not lose next time, either.

559
00:47:20,815 --> 00:47:23,795
Aigoo, is this quite a spectacle? Let us go.

560
00:47:23,795 --> 00:47:25,255
Yes, Sire.

561
00:47:47,215 --> 00:47:48,625
I admit it.

562
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:51,215
A little bit. I'm just a little bit rusty.

563
00:47:51,215 --> 00:47:52,815
I can catch up to him with a bit of training.

564
00:47:52,815 --> 00:47:57,615
- I can win. 
 - By doing so, you'll get owned for real next time.

565
00:47:57,615 --> 00:47:58,875
G-Get owned?

566
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:00,125
You speak so...

567
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:04,615
But at a glance, I can tell Chief Shin Won... has a different form.

568
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:09,365
When he holds the wooden sword, the allure he oozes is... Wow...

569
00:48:09,365 --> 00:48:13,595
I mean, when he swings the sword like this, the picture he paints is...

570
00:48:13,595 --> 00:48:15,085
Oh dear, it's so...

571
00:48:15,085 --> 00:48:19,085
W-W-Who? Who? Him? Sin Won?

572
00:48:19,085 --> 00:48:22,275
I guess you do not know the real meaning of allure.

573
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:24,315
Your discernment is a bit...

574
00:48:25,225 --> 00:48:26,315
too lowly.

575
00:48:26,315 --> 00:48:30,385
I am sure you will soon ooze charm too, once you start training hard, Your Majesty.

576
00:49:03,025 --> 00:49:04,535
Why?

577
00:49:05,635 --> 00:49:08,815
Do you now understand

578
00:49:10,455 --> 00:49:12,285
what "allure" means?

579
00:49:23,415 --> 00:49:24,945
You laugh?

580
00:49:26,285 --> 00:49:29,245
You dare laugh when your king is speaking to you?

581
00:49:30,245 --> 00:49:34,625
Then, I shall fulfill my duty as a court lady.

582
00:49:36,605 --> 00:49:38,095
Please come here.

583
00:49:38,095 --> 00:49:42,015
No. It is only proper that I go to you.

584
00:49:42,735 --> 00:49:45,015
C-Come where? W-Why? What are you going to do?

585
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:46,925
W-Why? Go away! W-What?

586
00:49:46,925 --> 00:49:47,885
Why? You're going to take my pants off?

587
00:49:47,885 --> 00:49:49,585
Is that not the job of a court lady?

588
00:49:49,585 --> 00:49:51,255
They said you would cut my neck if I violate the rule.

589
00:49:51,255 --> 00:49:53,905
My neck is precious to me.

590
00:50:05,415 --> 00:50:07,435
He still won't sleep?

591
00:50:33,495 --> 00:50:39,190
So, for the last seven years, you have been all over the provinces of Joseon?

592
00:50:39,725 --> 00:50:43,285
My fate is destined to wander all over.

593
00:50:44,035 --> 00:50:46,565
So, what did you do?

594
00:50:46,565 --> 00:50:51,575
Well, I met all types of different people from all over.

595
00:50:52,575 --> 00:50:55,725
There are all kinds of interesting people in this world.

596
00:50:55,725 --> 00:50:57,350
Is that so?

597
00:50:57,945 --> 00:51:00,165
Then tell me some interesting stories.

598
00:51:00,165 --> 00:51:03,005
If it's not interesting, I will have you punished.

599
00:51:05,205 --> 00:51:10,645
All right then... shall I tell you some stories?

600
00:51:11,305 --> 00:51:17,125
A long time ago, a man walked around with a sword stuck in his chest as a punishment from the gods.

601
00:51:18,105 --> 00:51:20,625
How could a man walk around with a sword in his chest?

602
00:51:21,235 --> 00:51:22,805
He was not a man!

603
00:51:22,805 --> 00:51:25,030
He was a goblin!

604
00:51:33,205 --> 00:51:38,915
But only... the goblin bride could take that sword out of his chest*. 
 (Plot of the k-drama "Goblin.")

605
00:51:40,365 --> 00:51:42,655
 But what is the problem?

606
00:51:42,655 --> 00:51:45,065
 The marriage ban was declared in this country.

607
00:51:45,065 --> 00:51:48,435
 I mean, they had to get married to take out the sword or something.

608
00:51:48,435 --> 00:51:52,465
 But in this country... even a goblin is an old bachelor.

609
00:51:53,935 --> 00:51:55,575
Do you have another story to tell?

610
00:51:55,575 --> 00:51:57,625
Why? It's so-so?

611
00:51:57,625 --> 00:51:59,515
You want a different story?

612
00:52:00,065 --> 00:52:06,215
A long time ago, there was an inn that accepted only ghosts as guests*. 
 (Plot of "Hotel Del Luna")

613
00:52:07,385 --> 00:52:10,705
 The owner of that place was so terrible.

614
00:52:10,705 --> 00:52:13,625
 She had lived for a long time but was a young woman.

615
00:52:13,625 --> 00:52:15,805
 She loved to spend money.

616
00:52:15,805 --> 00:52:21,125
 So, the owner was busy spending money and her employees were busy trying to stop her.

617
00:52:22,665 --> 00:52:23,975
Please put it down.

618
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:25,805
So, how did she get so much money?

619
00:52:25,805 --> 00:52:27,115
How else?

620
00:52:27,115 --> 00:52:33,705
The resentment of ladies and bachelors who died virgins due to the marriage ban piled on a great deal!

621
00:52:33,705 --> 00:52:35,685
Why do all your stories reach that conclusion?

622
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:40,305
If Your Majesty would abolish the marriage ban and relieve the resentments of young virgins,

623
00:52:40,305 --> 00:52:44,645
even all the ghosts in this country will be happy...

624
00:52:44,645 --> 00:52:48,385
I know many stories, but they are all very melodramatic.

625
00:52:48,385 --> 00:52:50,285
So, is this fun?

626
00:52:50,285 --> 00:52:51,625
Do you want to hear more?

627
00:52:51,625 --> 00:52:53,095
Yes.

628
00:52:56,165 --> 00:52:58,475
 I think he'll fall asleep if I tell a little more.

629
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:01,160
All right. Fine.

630
00:53:01,825 --> 00:53:07,855
A long time ago, a group of intense mothers lived in this neighborhood.

631
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:12,815
In that neighborhood, they did everything to make their sons pass the state exam...

632
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:17,135
Ever since they were young, they made them study many different things... 
 (Plot of "SKY Castle")

633
00:53:38,135 --> 00:53:39,680
What?

634
00:53:40,435 --> 00:53:42,585
What? Why are you here?

635
00:53:42,585 --> 00:53:45,935
I was wondering if you were in a deep sleep.

636
00:53:45,935 --> 00:53:49,005
But what is wrong with your condition?

637
00:53:49,005 --> 00:53:50,245
Pardon?

638
00:53:55,345 --> 00:53:58,245
You must have fought with some evil apparitions during the night!

639
00:53:59,865 --> 00:54:03,635
I have a hard time staying up all night.

640
00:54:06,595 --> 00:54:09,835
Anyway, I do feel much more light.

641
00:54:09,835 --> 00:54:14,395
Although I had a slightly strange dream, I slept well.

642
00:54:16,215 --> 00:54:19,825
I'm glad that... you were able to sleep comfortably.

643
00:54:19,825 --> 00:54:22,335
Go and get some rest if you're tired.

644
00:54:22,335 --> 00:54:23,785
Pardon?

645
00:54:23,785 --> 00:54:25,255
May I?

646
00:54:25,255 --> 00:54:27,685
Yes! Yes, Sire!

647
00:54:31,105 --> 00:54:33,055
Ouch! No, no...

648
00:54:38,035 --> 00:54:40,555
Are you channeling her spirit again?

649
00:54:40,555 --> 00:54:44,505
There still are many petty ghosts in the palace.

650
00:54:49,355 --> 00:54:51,875
In any case, she is so strange.

651
00:54:54,815 --> 00:54:59,315
Gosh, he looked like he got some good sleep, though.

652
00:54:59,315 --> 00:55:01,015
I'm glad.

653
00:55:04,825 --> 00:55:06,625
What in the world?

654
00:55:07,155 --> 00:55:10,535
There is a crazy bitch in the palace.

655
00:55:12,005 --> 00:55:14,105
T-That girl...

656
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:31,315
Was there a change in the list of inner court ladies?

657
00:55:31,315 --> 00:55:33,395
No, sir. There were no changes.

658
00:55:33,395 --> 00:55:36,105
Who is that girl who just walked out of the king's bedchamber?

659
00:55:36,105 --> 00:55:38,205
She is an inner court lady, Sun Ah.

660
00:55:38,205 --> 00:55:40,045
She has been in the palace for a long time.

661
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:43,325
There was a court lady like her before?

662
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:47,935
There are three shifts of inner court ladies, which change constantly.

663
00:55:47,935 --> 00:55:52,035
There is no way for you to know all of them.

664
00:55:52,035 --> 00:55:55,275
So, his majesty has not brought in someone new?

665
00:55:55,275 --> 00:55:56,995
Of course not.

666
00:55:56,995 --> 00:55:59,975
You know how his majesty is.

667
00:56:01,315 --> 00:56:04,295
All right. Carry on.

668
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:23,855
I just heard that she finished her shift.

669
00:56:23,855 --> 00:56:25,085
Why are you walking like that?

670
00:56:25,085 --> 00:56:27,275
I told you you would lose your neck if you violated the rules!

671
00:56:27,275 --> 00:56:29,755
I was on my knees all through the night.

672
00:56:29,755 --> 00:56:31,935
So, I cannot control my own legs.

673
00:56:31,935 --> 00:56:34,245
I mean, this is...

674
00:56:34,755 --> 00:56:37,155
I think it's best to put her to bed.

675
00:56:38,115 --> 00:56:40,025
Get on my back.

676
00:57:19,515 --> 00:57:21,775
Wake up. Wake up!

677
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:22,865
Come to your senses!

678
00:57:22,865 --> 00:57:24,720
Hurry up and wake up!

679
00:57:27,005 --> 00:57:29,915
You do not disturb even a dog when it's sleeping.

680
00:57:29,915 --> 00:57:33,255
Did I not tell you to behave carefully at all times?

681
00:57:33,255 --> 00:57:37,685
How crappy did you behave that he asked me who the lady was!

682
00:57:38,075 --> 00:57:39,995
I stayed up all night. What can I do?

683
00:57:39,995 --> 00:57:43,345
Gosh, this palace life doesn't suit me at all. I should try to run away or something.

684
00:57:43,345 --> 00:57:47,005
How dare you. Only a good beating will set you straight!

685
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,335
Aigoo!

686
00:57:48,335 --> 00:57:50,425
Court Lady Won!

687
00:57:51,945 --> 00:57:53,965
You know...

688
00:57:57,205 --> 00:57:59,105
your personality changed after coming into the palace, did it not?

689
00:57:59,105 --> 00:58:00,845
This thought keeps coming to my mind.

690
00:58:00,845 --> 00:58:07,765
Although you're strict and scary like a tiger, I suspect that you were not always like that.

691
00:58:08,275 --> 00:58:11,375
I mean, I can just tell at a glance!

692
00:58:11,375 --> 00:58:17,045
When Court Lady Won was single, so many men must have been dying to be with you.

693
00:58:17,045 --> 00:58:21,035
You must have been so pretty as a flower.

694
00:58:21,035 --> 00:58:22,675
You...

695
00:58:23,415 --> 00:58:26,115
sure know how to read people.

696
00:58:26,955 --> 00:58:31,955
I was unbelievably pretty before I got married.

697
00:58:33,975 --> 00:58:40,095
Love surely... came to me like destiny.

698
00:58:42,175 --> 00:58:44,415
 Have my child for me.

699
00:58:45,395 --> 00:58:48,575
 All you talk about is proper customs and rules.

700
00:58:48,575 --> 00:58:52,895
 You fell in love where custom and rules have no place!

701
00:58:52,895 --> 00:58:54,665
 Enter the palace?

702
00:58:54,665 --> 00:58:58,495
 The palace urgently needs a wet nurse court lady.

703
00:58:58,495 --> 00:59:00,815
 They want the best wet nurse in Joseon.

704
00:59:00,815 --> 00:59:02,305
You're the best.

705
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:06,655
 But I heard you cannot leave the palace once you go in.

706
00:59:09,685 --> 00:59:12,645
 Dear husband...

707
00:59:18,435 --> 00:59:20,965
Do you know how much I miss them?

708
00:59:20,965 --> 00:59:24,035
I wonder how my son grew up to be...

709
00:59:24,035 --> 00:59:28,865
So, to summarize, Court Lady Won...

710
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:31,425
you're saying that, among all the court ladies who are forbidden to marry,

711
00:59:31,425 --> 00:59:36,655
you're the only one who knows the fun of the boom-bop beat rhythm between a man and a woman.

712
00:59:36,655 --> 00:59:39,395
What's a boom-bop beat?

713
00:59:39,395 --> 00:59:41,075
By chance...!

714
00:59:41,075 --> 00:59:45,105
How can you speak of such a profane thing?

715
00:59:46,695 --> 00:59:48,605
This current state of affairs

716
00:59:48,605 --> 00:59:51,595
desperately calls for your experience and knowledge, Court Lady Won!

717
00:59:51,595 --> 00:59:55,695
How could silly novices seduce the king, become the king's women, and produce an heir?

718
00:59:55,695 --> 01:00:00,965
From now on, all the women in this palace must be aggressive and make the first move—

719
01:00:01,915 --> 01:00:03,805
Who is there?

720
01:00:06,725 --> 01:00:09,065
Ah, you scared me.

721
01:00:09,065 --> 01:00:13,225
What were you talking about that you were having so much fun?

722
01:00:14,785 --> 01:00:21,035
We were talking about the boom-bop beat game that a woman and a man secretly enjoy at night.

723
01:00:21,035 --> 01:00:22,955
Boom-bop beat?

724
01:00:22,955 --> 01:00:26,535
You're talking about that game where the rhythm is crucial?

725
01:00:26,535 --> 01:00:28,275
How dare you get so chatty like that?

726
01:00:28,275 --> 01:00:29,975
You should keep your mouth shut!

727
01:00:29,975 --> 01:00:33,115
So, what brings you all the way here?

728
01:00:33,115 --> 01:00:36,845
Did you not say So Rang should hang her belongings?

729
01:00:36,845 --> 01:00:40,035
I'm confident when it comes to penetration.

730
01:00:40,035 --> 01:00:41,725
What did you say?*
  (Sounds like the word "nail" in Korean)

731
01:00:42,485 --> 01:00:44,245
A nail.

732
01:00:45,925 --> 01:00:48,925
Oh... t-there...

733
01:01:45,015 --> 01:01:48,465
I'm a stronger man than you'd think.

734
01:01:48,985 --> 01:01:51,315
Why do I feel so hot?

735
01:01:53,975 --> 01:01:55,935
I will get going now.

736
01:01:55,935 --> 01:01:58,685
Finished already?

737
01:02:05,175 --> 01:02:08,365
Why are you sweating so much?

738
01:02:08,365 --> 01:02:11,265
You're not the one who nailed it to the wall.

739
01:02:11,265 --> 01:02:13,945
N-No... It's nothing...

740
01:02:13,945 --> 01:02:16,975
 You may not believe it, but I'm the best.

741
01:02:16,975 --> 01:02:20,305
 The master of bringing love together.

742
01:02:20,305 --> 01:02:22,445
Only if those parts weren't missing...

743
01:02:22,445 --> 01:02:24,115
What?

744
01:02:25,185 --> 01:02:26,625
What's missing?

745
01:02:26,625 --> 01:02:28,025
Well?

746
01:02:28,025 --> 01:02:29,985
What was missing again?

747
01:02:52,255 --> 01:02:55,465
The sun sets tonight once again like this.

748
01:02:56,285 --> 01:02:58,085
Crown Princess...

749
01:02:59,235 --> 01:03:01,125
Ja Yeon...

750
01:03:06,105 --> 01:03:09,275
I will die calling out your name.

751
01:03:10,865 --> 01:03:13,865
Ayo, why does he keep asking for me?

752
01:03:13,865 --> 01:03:16,825
Is he having fun tormenting me?

753
01:03:16,825 --> 01:03:19,045
Aigoo, aigoo...

754
01:03:23,305 --> 01:03:25,575
Goodness...

755
01:03:51,415 --> 01:03:52,755
 The king has been castrated?

756
01:03:52,755 --> 01:03:54,265
 The king has been castrated!

757
01:03:54,265 --> 01:03:57,475
 What did I ever do wrong, to be born in a country where the king has been castrated

758
01:03:57,475 --> 01:04:00,195
 and I have to live forever as though I've been castrated myself!

759
01:04:00,195 --> 01:04:02,805
 - Damn it! 
 - Aigoo!

760
01:04:04,325 --> 01:04:07,755
He must be upset after reading malicious petitions like this.

761
01:04:07,755 --> 01:04:11,955
If he hates these false rumors, he should father an heir quickly.

762
01:04:11,955 --> 01:04:15,225
Why does he insist on living a life of celibacy all by himself?

763
01:04:15,225 --> 01:04:18,115
There are so many pretty court ladies in the palace.

764
01:04:21,295 --> 01:04:23,055
By chance...

765
01:04:23,595 --> 01:04:26,280
is it really not working?

766
01:04:26,785 --> 01:04:28,615
So Rang.

767
01:04:33,725 --> 01:04:34,915
 What the?

768
01:04:34,915 --> 01:04:37,965
 Why is he looking at me so pitifully all of a sudden?

769
01:04:37,965 --> 01:04:39,075
Y-Yes?

770
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:41,385
By chance, is your body ready?

771
01:04:41,385 --> 01:04:44,105
Is it possible now?

772
01:04:46,425 --> 01:04:48,775
M-My body?

773
01:04:48,775 --> 01:04:50,405
 Does this prove that the king is not castrated?

774
01:04:50,405 --> 01:04:52,245
 He's saying I'm a temporary palace lady, too?

775
01:04:52,245 --> 01:04:56,995
 If so, the reason he's urgently asking for me is to... become his woman?

776
01:04:56,995 --> 01:04:59,325
I'm speaking of spirit channeling.

777
01:05:01,575 --> 01:05:03,175
Pardon?

778
01:05:08,835 --> 01:05:13,435
But I cannot do that any time I want to, Sire.

779
01:05:13,435 --> 01:05:19,595
I mean, if you summon her so often like this, Her Royal Highness the crown princess cannot rest comfortably.

780
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:25,035
Do you miss her a lot?

781
01:05:25,035 --> 01:05:27,915
I think I will start crying...

782
01:05:27,915 --> 01:05:30,525
You cannot cry, Sire.

783
01:05:32,245 --> 01:05:33,695
 What should I do?

784
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:36,785
 I shouldn't keep conning him.

785
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,125
Argh!

786
01:05:44,155 --> 01:05:48,735
In the future, you cannot summon her so often.

787
01:05:55,575 --> 01:06:00,135
Your Highness, have you been well?

788
01:06:18,415 --> 01:06:21,260
Is it really you, Crown Princess?

789
01:06:21,775 --> 01:06:24,485
Why did you summon me?

790
01:06:27,955 --> 01:06:29,625
Just...

791
01:06:31,005 --> 01:06:35,580
I want to dream of you tonight, Crown Princess.

792
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:41,435
You promised me that you will let me ascend.

793
01:06:44,195 --> 01:06:46,545
I know we should part ways

794
01:06:48,855 --> 01:06:51,840
but I do not think I can do that.

795
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,105
You must

796
01:06:54,685 --> 01:06:56,905
become stronger, Your Highness.

797
01:06:56,905 --> 01:07:01,545
Train hard in martial arts and enjoy your meals.

798
01:07:01,545 --> 01:07:06,375
So that... I may depart with my heart at ease.

799
01:07:06,375 --> 01:07:08,565
Aside from you, Crown Princess,

800
01:07:09,665 --> 01:07:13,545
I do not think I can be with anyone else.

801
01:07:20,565 --> 01:07:22,115
You already are...

802
01:07:23,095 --> 01:07:26,355
with this girl now.

803
01:07:30,445 --> 01:07:33,405
I merely have your shadow, Crown Princess.

804
01:07:41,305 --> 01:07:42,725
If so,

805
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:51,115
at some point... you will also have to distance this shadow.

806
01:07:51,115 --> 01:07:58,675
Could you promise me that you will... forget me?

807
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:04,115
I do not want to.

808
01:08:04,115 --> 01:08:06,115
Please forget me.

809
01:08:06,795 --> 01:08:08,865
Without any trace.

810
01:08:10,415 --> 01:08:12,475
Please erase me from your heart.

811
01:08:16,845 --> 01:08:19,175
Just a little longer...

812
01:08:19,175 --> 01:08:21,445
Please stay a little longer...

813
01:08:22,325 --> 01:08:24,835
Please don't leave me...

814
01:08:40,155 --> 01:08:42,395
That was too short...

815
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:08,320
♫  This night where even the moon sleeps  ♫

816
01:09:09,065 --> 01:09:13,915
 Going forward... do I need to be here like this?

817
01:09:13,915 --> 01:09:19,275
 As the shadow of a woman this man cannot forget?

818
01:09:20,975 --> 01:09:24,815
♫  Without saying a word  ♫

819
01:09:24,815 --> 01:09:30,320
♫  Where are you going in such a rush?  ♫

820
01:09:32,245 --> 01:09:36,645
 Continually like this?

821
01:09:45,985 --> 01:09:48,795
Your hands look like hers.

822
01:09:48,795 --> 01:10:02,190
♫  Foolishly, I still cannot let go of you even for a moment  ♫

823
01:10:03,395 --> 01:10:06,795
♫  I am so sorry  ♫

824
01:10:06,795 --> 01:10:10,725
♫  It is all my fault  ♫

825
01:10:10,725 --> 01:10:18,065
♫  Please visit me even for a moment  ♫

826
01:10:18,065 --> 01:10:24,490
♫  How can I forget you?  ♫

827
01:10:25,325 --> 01:10:31,900
♫  How can I forget you?  ♫

828
01:10:32,575 --> 01:10:41,290
♫  You torment me by coming to me every night in my dream  ♫

829
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:44,355
 The Forbidden Marriage 
 Preview

830
01:10:44,355 --> 01:10:45,865
 Please come down, my lady.

831
01:10:45,865 --> 01:10:49,385
 Does he know that I'm Hyeon Seon or not?

832
01:10:49,385 --> 01:10:52,085
 I found out who is making that sound!

833
01:10:52,085 --> 01:10:54,415
 I did it, Sire!

834
01:10:54,415 --> 01:10:56,245
 How about attending military training?

835
01:10:56,245 --> 01:10:57,205
 It's been seven years.

836
01:10:57,205 --> 01:10:58,855
 - Shoot!
 - You scared me!

837
01:10:58,855 --> 01:11:02,245
 He brought her here even dressing her up as a man?

838
01:11:02,245 --> 01:11:04,785
 Find out who that court lady is.

839
01:11:04,785 --> 01:11:08,135
 By chance, are there real wild boars here?

840
01:11:08,135 --> 01:11:09,815
 Do not worry.

841
01:11:09,815 --> 01:11:12,590
 I will protect you, Your Majesty.

842
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:17,700
