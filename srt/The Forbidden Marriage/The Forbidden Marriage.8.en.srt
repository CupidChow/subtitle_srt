2
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,034
What? The queen dowager wants to see me?

3
00:00:44,034 --> 00:00:45,724
<i>Episode 8</i>
W-Why... Why, out of the blue?

4
00:00:45,724 --> 00:00:49,214
You're a low servant, don't ask questions so rashly!

5
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,614
Oh, I am sorry.

6
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,184
Supposedly, the reason the king left the palace

7
00:01:13,184 --> 00:01:16,474
was merely for someone like you, I hear.

8
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,084
You should not do this. To act like this due to the sudden soaring of lust!

9
00:01:52,084 --> 00:01:55,134
L-Lust? What...Never. Definitely not.

10
00:01:55,134 --> 00:01:57,104
Then what is it?

11
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,214
So... That is...

12
00:02:00,214 --> 00:02:04,464
Your Majesty, are your feelings for me indeed genuine?

13
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:12,264
All this time, you were confused between the late crown princess and me.

14
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,094
N-No, that is not true.

15
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,004
- Right now—
- I do not want it if your feelings are not sincere.

16
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,184
Raise your head.

17
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,354
For what reason do you look upon me so?

18
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,454
It is nothing.

19
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:07,634
I was simply looking to see whether you'll be a hindrance or a stepping stone.

20
00:03:07,634 --> 00:03:12,224
As you may already know, the process of queen selection will begin in the palace soon.

21
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:14,764
As long as I am the head of the Inner Courts,

22
00:03:14,764 --> 00:03:19,344
the entire process must go smoothly without even a small flaw.

23
00:03:19,344 --> 00:03:24,724
However, you may possibly be a variable in that process.

24
00:03:24,724 --> 00:03:27,574
If the king truly is swayed by his feelings for you,

25
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,994
you will serve as a stumbling block in the queen selection.

26
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:37,934
On the other hand, if you were to change the king's heart, you will serve as a stepping stone.

27
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:42,774
What do you think? Will you become a stepping stone for me?

28
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,374
Who am I that... I may have the power to move his majesty's heart?

29
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,504
There is no way for me to know his majesty's true feelings.

30
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:59,684
However I don't wish to be

31
00:03:59,684 --> 00:04:02,854
either a stepping stone or a stumbling block.

32
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,084
In that case, what reason is there

33
00:04:07,084 --> 00:04:10,824
<i>for you to remain in this palace?</i>

34
00:04:10,824 --> 00:04:13,554
<i>The place where I will stay...</i>

35
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,424
<i>should be decided by me.</i>

36
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,964
You'll catch a cold at this rate.

37
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,064
What are you doing here?

38
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,654
I was just waiting.

39
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,944
For me?

40
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,744
To see the stars.

41
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,904
I see.

42
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,514
While you were going through all these things, I had made up my mind to be honest about my feelings.

43
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,314
But I don't think I can anymore.

44
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,544
You don't need to explain anything to me.

45
00:05:13,544 --> 00:05:16,254
Let's go inside. To our dwellings.

46
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,674
I don't want you to feel burdened because of me.

47
00:05:32,674 --> 00:05:35,584
Nor do I want you to feel uncomfortable.

48
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:37,424
So...

49
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,354
I'll keep my feelings hidden in my heart.

50
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,674
So that it does not show, I shall suppress them and hold them in tightly.

51
00:05:49,674 --> 00:05:56,794
♫ <i>when the stories you wanted to hear poured out endlessly</i> ♫

52
00:05:56,794 --> 00:06:05,734
♫ <i>Once again my resolutions like an old precariously standing wall </i> ♫

53
00:06:05,734 --> 00:06:09,834
What shall I do with you? Seriously...

54
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,234
<i>Are you hurt anywhere?</i>

55
00:06:33,234 --> 00:06:35,004
Yes...

56
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,104
What are you doing, standing out here?

57
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:53,784
Since even our Maiden Hae Young has returned home safely, why don't we all throw a celebration party at Aedaldang?

58
00:06:53,784 --> 00:06:58,034
Today, especially, I shall show you my dancing skills enough to make a dancing troupe cry.

59
00:06:58,034 --> 00:07:00,624
Doo, doo doo, doo doo doo.

60
00:07:00,624 --> 00:07:02,644
Learn to read the room!

61
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,614
Then, perhaps we should talk about his work?

62
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,964
W-Why don't we go and grab a drink? Quickly. Take the royal officer, too.

63
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,644
Y-Yes, let's do that. Let's go!

64
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,224
Hae Yeong.

65
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,520
Hae Yeong!

66
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,820
Yes?

67
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,914
Be kind to Chun Seok.

68
00:07:38,914 --> 00:07:39,940
Why?

69
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,310
Just be kind.

70
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,794
Who bought this item?

71
00:07:59,794 --> 00:08:04,654
Aigoo, how can I carelessly give away my client's information?

72
00:08:04,654 --> 00:08:07,534
Because of the Marriage Ban Edict,

73
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:11,694
I cannot even sell jewelry.

74
00:08:11,694 --> 00:08:13,434
Then, give me one.

75
00:08:13,434 --> 00:08:18,324
Aigoo! Which one would you like? Is it for your lover?

76
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,344
I just...plan to give it to a friend.

77
00:08:22,344 --> 00:08:25,944
My goodness. Why gift a ring to a friend?

78
00:08:25,944 --> 00:08:28,864
Do you know how expensive these are? Take a look.

79
00:08:28,864 --> 00:08:34,274
Here. This is...a ring that can turn a friend into a bride!

80
00:08:34,274 --> 00:08:39,104
The brilliant gleam of this ring easily mesmerizes the eyes of women,

81
00:08:39,104 --> 00:08:42,164
enough to make them want to get married when they did not want to.

82
00:08:42,164 --> 00:08:47,204
Aigoo. Take a good look. Here. Place it here and take a good look. Here.

83
00:08:47,204 --> 00:08:49,864
This one is not too expensive, I'll tell you.

84
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,174
Now let's see, let's see...

85
00:08:53,174 --> 00:08:56,604
The one who bought the earrings the other day...

86
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:58,094
<i>Name: Seo Wun Jeong</i>

87
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,574
<i>The bride makes her bows to the groom!</i>

88
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,184
<i>Where is my real bride?</i>

89
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,224
Go and confiscate some corroborative evidence.

90
00:09:25,224 --> 00:09:26,924
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

91
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,554
Nobody move!

92
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,244
What...W-What in the world is going on?

93
00:09:56,244 --> 00:09:58,184
We are here to investigate the lady of this house.

94
00:09:58,184 --> 00:09:59,584
Me?

95
00:09:59,584 --> 00:10:03,604
What business do you have with a woman stuck inside the home

96
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,734
that calls for an investigation by the Investigation Bureau?

97
00:10:05,734 --> 00:10:09,294
Yes, I feel there is a misunderstanding here.

98
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,350
Search the premises thoroughly!

99
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,130
Yes, sir!

100
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,004
What are you doing!

101
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,534
<i>I heard the daughter of this house has an overly extravagant lifestyle...</i>

102
00:10:46,534 --> 00:10:49,184
<i>But I see no sign of any ornaments...</i>

103
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,044
Isn't it funny?

104
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,544
How the women's feelings

105
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:31,054
are easily swayed by a mere stone.

106
00:11:31,054 --> 00:11:32,574
I am not sure what you are talking about.

107
00:11:32,574 --> 00:11:35,304
Oh my! Don't act as if you don't know.

108
00:11:35,304 --> 00:11:37,994
You thought all that must be fake.

109
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,984
Here, what do you think? All these are genuine.

110
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:47,214
No women fails to fall for these, whether or not marriage has been forbidden or not.

111
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,404
Shall we make a bet?

112
00:11:51,404 --> 00:11:55,204
Whether you are able to captivate the woman's heart or not.

113
00:12:00,224 --> 00:12:03,794
<i>I do not want it if your feelings are not sincere.</i>

114
00:12:03,794 --> 00:12:06,704
<i>Are you saying you don't like me or what?</i>

115
00:12:06,704 --> 00:12:11,720
<i>You were confused between the late crown princess and me.</i>

116
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,924
<i>N-Not right now. Not anymore.</i>

117
00:12:13,924 --> 00:12:17,354
<i>Are your feelings for me genuine, Your Majesty?</i>

118
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,264
<i>Wow...</i>

119
00:12:21,134 --> 00:12:25,284
Your Majesty, are you worried about something?

120
00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:28,134
Whoa.

121
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:31,164
No.

122
00:12:31,164 --> 00:12:33,234
Not at all.

123
00:12:40,324 --> 00:12:41,824
Very well.

124
00:12:41,824 --> 00:12:44,144
Take your leave, everyone.

125
00:12:54,354 --> 00:12:56,194
You there!

126
00:12:59,304 --> 00:13:01,674
The one all the way in the back.

127
00:13:01,674 --> 00:13:03,764
Except for you.

128
00:13:10,814 --> 00:13:13,204
Would you be able to test the food for me?

129
00:13:13,204 --> 00:13:17,900
I believe the other court lady already did so before she left.

130
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:23,300
Oh, well... the meats here... seem a bit dangerous.

131
00:13:50,884 --> 00:13:53,434
She sure eats so unappetizingly.

132
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:55,534
Thought she was chewing on paper.

133
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,634
Is she a goat or something?

134
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,200
Tonight there is no particular story I can think of.

135
00:14:10,854 --> 00:14:13,224
A-all right, then... Well...

136
00:14:13,224 --> 00:14:15,624
Let's skip that for now...

137
00:14:15,624 --> 00:14:19,684
Have you any injuries from that time when you suffered?

138
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:24,564
Though it may seem everything is all right now, you never know when and how the pain will come on later.

139
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:26,994
- So...
- I am fine.

140
00:14:27,894 --> 00:14:29,864
Oh, then...

141
00:14:29,864 --> 00:14:31,824
- get some rest.
- Yes, Sire.

142
00:14:31,824 --> 00:14:33,894
Wait, no.

143
00:14:33,894 --> 00:14:36,474
Tomorrow. Rest tomorrow.

144
00:14:40,444 --> 00:14:42,974
Go on and lie down.

145
00:14:44,574 --> 00:14:46,254
Very well.

146
00:14:47,864 --> 00:14:49,504
Yes.

147
00:14:54,074 --> 00:14:55,574
<i>It's strange.</i>

148
00:14:55,574 --> 00:14:58,554
<i>In the past, I needed her presence to fall asleep.</i>

149
00:14:58,554 --> 00:15:01,894
<i>Now, I am unable to sleep because of her.</i>

150
00:15:03,114 --> 00:15:05,184
It is time to sleep now.

151
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:08,404
You will not even tell me a fun bedtime story...

152
00:16:16,114 --> 00:16:17,604
One.

153
00:16:18,514 --> 00:16:20,124
Two.

154
00:16:20,124 --> 00:16:21,684
Three.

155
00:16:29,904 --> 00:16:33,064
Look at you... You were pretending you were tough...

156
00:16:39,584 --> 00:16:41,884
Why do you look so pretty?

157
00:16:44,684 --> 00:16:47,724
<i>Did she always sleep so beautifully?</i>

158
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:50,254
<i>Wait a second.</i>

159
00:16:50,254 --> 00:16:53,194
<i>She said she doesn't want it if my feelings aren't genuine.</i>

160
00:16:53,194 --> 00:16:56,704
<i>Then, does that mean she already has genuine feelings for me?</i>

161
00:16:56,704 --> 00:16:59,094
<i>In that case...</i>

162
00:16:59,094 --> 00:17:01,524
<i>So Rang already has feelings for me?</i>

163
00:17:02,224 --> 00:17:04,674
<i>Do you want to be together with her for a long time</i>

164
00:17:04,674 --> 00:17:07,284
<i>and share affection with her?</i>

165
00:18:12,334 --> 00:18:18,754
♫ <i>On this night, when even the moon sleeps</i> ♫

166
00:18:18,754 --> 00:18:25,284
♫ <i>Where are you going in such a rush?</i> ♫

167
00:18:26,644 --> 00:18:30,294
♫ <i>Leaving on a long trip</i> ♫

168
00:18:30,294 --> 00:18:34,044
♫ <i>tonight without a word</i> ♫

169
00:18:34,044 --> 00:18:40,234
♫ <i>where are you rushing to?</i> ♫

170
00:18:42,534 --> 00:18:44,944
Your Majesty.

171
00:18:44,944 --> 00:18:47,654
Did you sleep we—

172
00:18:48,364 --> 00:18:50,344
Be quiet.

173
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:55,564
Your Majesty,

174
00:18:55,564 --> 00:18:58,694
just what happened last night

175
00:19:03,384 --> 00:19:07,634
that your face looks so bright?

176
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:11,204
- Me?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

177
00:19:12,774 --> 00:19:15,184
Was there ever a time

178
00:19:15,944 --> 00:19:17,264
I did not look good?

179
00:19:17,264 --> 00:19:22,604
Just up until a couple of months ago, you had dark circles under your eyes.

180
00:19:22,604 --> 00:19:25,960
Although I may lack certain body parts, my heart had never fluttered for a man before.

181
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,660
I've never had the experience of having my heart flutter to see a man

182
00:19:28,664 --> 00:19:31,484
but truly today from a man's perspective

183
00:19:32,294 --> 00:19:33,854
I might fall for you.

184
00:19:33,854 --> 00:19:38,804
Oh, dear. What should we do if the court ladies' hearts flutter?

185
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:40,394
Your Majesty!

186
00:19:40,394 --> 00:19:42,634
H-However...

187
00:19:42,634 --> 00:19:47,374
there is still only one person who is very closed off.

188
00:19:47,374 --> 00:19:49,434
And who is that person?

189
00:19:51,464 --> 00:19:53,264
Go and summon the Chief Royal Secretary.

190
00:19:53,264 --> 00:19:55,334
That person...

191
00:19:56,244 --> 00:19:58,374
Is it the Chief Royal Secretary?

192
00:20:03,574 --> 00:20:07,714
Your Majesty, I will brief you on the ambush strategy to capture the kidnapper organization.

193
00:20:07,714 --> 00:20:10,684
The document we seized at the Police Bureau...

194
00:20:26,314 --> 00:20:27,924
What in the world happened?

195
00:20:27,924 --> 00:20:29,734
Oh, come on!

196
00:20:29,734 --> 00:20:32,984
Enough. I already know.

197
00:20:33,534 --> 00:20:36,834
Just how did you suddenly turn over a new leaf like this...

198
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:40,754
I was always... radiating such brightness.

199
00:20:41,714 --> 00:20:43,464
All through the night,

200
00:20:43,464 --> 00:20:46,464
I did some contemplating.

201
00:20:46,464 --> 00:20:48,624
I think you are right.

202
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:50,824
The loving...

203
00:20:50,824 --> 00:20:52,414
affection.

204
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:58,214
But did you not say you were still confused?

205
00:20:58,214 --> 00:20:59,924
What you said the other day seems right.

206
00:20:59,924 --> 00:21:03,014
The way I get this feeling where my chest feels tight

207
00:21:03,014 --> 00:21:05,364
whenever she disappears...

208
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,274
Daebak.

209
00:21:07,274 --> 00:21:09,094
Daebak!

210
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:12,154
Such matters are insignificant at the moment.

211
00:21:12,154 --> 00:21:14,614
B-But, still...

212
00:21:14,614 --> 00:21:17,394
There still remains a difficult task to do.

213
00:21:17,394 --> 00:21:20,984
It's been a while since I felt this way.

214
00:21:20,984 --> 00:21:23,734
I'm not really sure how to go about it.

215
00:21:23,734 --> 00:21:25,614
And what is that, Your Majesty?

216
00:21:26,414 --> 00:21:28,564
So, that is...

217
00:21:28,564 --> 00:21:30,154
Co...

218
00:21:32,014 --> 00:21:34,004
Con... fess...

219
00:21:34,474 --> 00:21:36,664
- Co- cold, you say?
- Confession! A love confession!

220
00:21:36,664 --> 00:21:38,394
- A confession!
- Yes, confession.

221
00:21:38,394 --> 00:21:40,714
When I tell her the truth

222
00:21:40,714 --> 00:21:45,094
and she puts up an iron wall saying, "You're not sincere," what should I do?

223
00:21:45,094 --> 00:21:49,054
If I hear one more time that she does not want me,

224
00:21:49,734 --> 00:21:52,964
I really think I will get hurt.

225
00:21:52,964 --> 00:21:55,674
You are quite cute, Your Majesty.

226
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:57,964
All right...

227
00:21:57,964 --> 00:22:00,084
I daresay it is a love confession from you, Your Majesty.

228
00:22:00,084 --> 00:22:02,774
What woman will be able to turn that down?

229
00:22:02,774 --> 00:22:05,374
Surely So Rang will accept your confession, too.

230
00:22:05,374 --> 00:22:07,734
Well, you see...

231
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:10,194
I wouldn't worry if it were some ordinary woman, but...

232
00:22:10,194 --> 00:22:13,294
you already know. So Rang is no ordinary woman.

233
00:22:13,294 --> 00:22:17,844
I think I will need a meticulous plan for this.

234
00:22:17,844 --> 00:22:19,724
And who better to plan than me?

235
00:22:19,724 --> 00:22:24,054
I am your very bag of tricks, Your Majesty.

236
00:22:26,494 --> 00:22:28,874
Is there something in your eye?

237
00:22:28,874 --> 00:22:31,174
Are you all right?

238
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:41,314
My goodness!

239
00:22:42,764 --> 00:22:44,894
Upon my word, I must be crazy!

240
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:42,944
It's actually for the king's top security guards, but I saved a portion.

241
00:23:42,944 --> 00:23:45,154
Eat it all by yourself.

242
00:23:45,154 --> 00:23:47,144
You really don't have to care for me like this.

243
00:23:47,144 --> 00:23:50,564
You should eat many tasty things while you're in the palace.

244
00:23:51,284 --> 00:23:53,114
The Eunuch Council

245
00:23:53,114 --> 00:23:55,534
is coming up with a list of court ladies who will be allowed to leave.

246
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:56,694
Oh, really?

247
00:23:56,694 --> 00:23:59,014
If you'd like,

248
00:23:59,014 --> 00:24:00,884
I'll put your name in.

249
00:24:00,884 --> 00:24:05,874
But... outside the palace is still dangerous for me.

250
00:24:05,874 --> 00:24:08,324
I almost died a few times, too.

251
00:24:08,324 --> 00:24:11,134
Then, I'll continue to remain at your side.

252
00:24:11,134 --> 00:24:12,334
What?

253
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:14,264
As your friend.

254
00:24:15,004 --> 00:24:16,774
I've been working at the Investigation Bureau for a while now.

255
00:24:16,774 --> 00:24:18,154
I can take a break for a while.

256
00:24:18,154 --> 00:24:20,464
But you must capture those gangs.

257
00:24:20,464 --> 00:24:23,384
The scammers who produced the fake crown princess. And the kidnappers as well.

258
00:24:23,384 --> 00:24:27,514
I will privately continue the investigation so that you are not in danger.

259
00:24:27,514 --> 00:24:29,484
What do you intend?

260
00:24:29,484 --> 00:24:31,444
Do you wish to remain in the palace?

261
00:24:32,354 --> 00:24:36,594
Last time, you said his majesty worries you.

262
00:24:36,594 --> 00:24:38,244
I ...

263
00:24:38,984 --> 00:24:42,594
don't want to be a substitute for a dead person, either.

264
00:24:42,594 --> 00:24:44,174
What?

265
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,900
Have you decided where you stand?

266
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,200
I have decided where I will stay.

267
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,700
And where is that place?

268
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,764
- I'm going!
- Move it!

269
00:25:32,594 --> 00:25:34,364
Come on out.

270
00:25:49,184 --> 00:25:50,804
We are in a critical situation.

271
00:25:50,804 --> 00:25:53,574
At this rate, our organization is at risk.

272
00:25:54,664 --> 00:25:58,724
Is it no longer possible for the higher officials to cover for us?

273
00:25:59,854 --> 00:26:03,364
Who is the current leader

274
00:26:03,364 --> 00:26:06,224
of the investigation?

275
00:26:36,974 --> 00:26:40,494
Because of the bright glow coming from the king's face lately,

276
00:26:40,494 --> 00:26:42,614
I cannot open my eyes as it is so blinding!

277
00:26:42,614 --> 00:26:44,314
Don't you agree?

278
00:26:45,514 --> 00:26:48,334
That should be enough, right?

279
00:26:48,334 --> 00:26:49,784
What?

280
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:55,134
Well, I mean... You know how he was at first.

281
00:26:55,134 --> 00:26:57,424
A heartbroken man, no matter how you looked at him.

282
00:26:57,424 --> 00:26:59,774
All depressed and melancholy...

283
00:27:08,634 --> 00:27:11,084
Come this way for a second.

284
00:27:12,024 --> 00:27:13,554
A trip to the hot springs?

285
00:27:13,554 --> 00:27:16,194
Yes, there were quite a few exhausting events recently.

286
00:27:16,194 --> 00:27:18,214
I plan to destress there.

287
00:27:19,274 --> 00:27:22,064
Must I go, too?

288
00:27:23,484 --> 00:27:27,734
If the inner court lady does not come, who will lay down the bedding? Me?

289
00:27:27,734 --> 00:27:29,864
There are other inner court ladies.

290
00:27:29,864 --> 00:27:32,454
Ah, well...

291
00:27:32,454 --> 00:27:36,814
I am unable to sleep well in unfamiliar surroundings.

292
00:27:40,134 --> 00:27:43,354
All right, then. I have to go.

293
00:27:43,354 --> 00:27:45,274
All right, Your Majesty.

294
00:27:53,934 --> 00:27:55,924
I'm getting worried for no reason.

295
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,884
She's not tagging along against her will, is she?

296
00:28:00,504 --> 00:28:02,724
Wait a second. At this rate,

297
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:05,034
what if my confession gets turned down?

298
00:28:13,214 --> 00:28:16,694
Look at this slow progress on your work!

299
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:19,294
Painter Jung, you're not focused on your work.

300
00:28:19,294 --> 00:28:21,584
You're completely fixated on Maiden Hae Yeong.

301
00:28:21,584 --> 00:28:25,084
For the sake of our Born Sul Ro Group, must we connect the two

302
00:28:25,084 --> 00:28:29,134
or sever their ties completely for the sake of our group?

303
00:28:29,134 --> 00:28:32,134
Looking at how he is, it doesn't seem likely they will connect.

304
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:35,524
At this rate, how will our Born Sul Ro Group undergo a reviv—

305
00:28:35,524 --> 00:28:38,614
Aigoo, geez. P-Painter Jung!

306
00:28:38,614 --> 00:28:40,784
Aigoo...

307
00:28:42,844 --> 00:28:44,744
Are you hurting so badly inside?

308
00:28:44,744 --> 00:28:47,374
Do you really feel like dying?

309
00:28:47,374 --> 00:28:50,764
Have you ever experienced one-sided love before?

310
00:28:52,484 --> 00:28:56,594
It's just that... every breath you take becomes a sigh.

311
00:28:57,174 --> 00:29:00,824
Living your life as though you're sick.

312
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:03,914
Erasing her and giving her up all on my own...

313
00:29:03,914 --> 00:29:05,804
But unable to forget her, so I go to her again...

314
00:29:05,804 --> 00:29:07,754
only to be disappointed once more...

315
00:29:07,754 --> 00:29:09,614
and eat my heart out.

316
00:29:11,954 --> 00:29:16,054
Even so, why can't I give up?

317
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:19,834
What do we do with you, really...

318
00:29:19,834 --> 00:29:22,304
Painter Ju—

319
00:29:23,704 --> 00:29:25,104
Lee Sin Won.

320
00:29:25,104 --> 00:29:27,454
This is all because of him.

321
00:29:27,454 --> 00:29:28,494
What's the matter?

322
00:29:28,494 --> 00:29:32,544
At one point, I heard you had your eyes on him as a prospective son-in-law.

323
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,094
No.

324
00:29:34,094 --> 00:29:36,044
We will need to eliminate him first.

325
00:29:36,044 --> 00:29:39,584
Why do you think that bitch is still alive?

326
00:29:39,584 --> 00:29:41,014
All because of that bastard's protection...

327
00:29:41,014 --> 00:29:44,424
Are you saying you plan to harm the Chief of the Royal Investigation Bureau?

328
00:29:44,424 --> 00:29:46,944
You've been stripped of your investigative authorities

329
00:29:46,944 --> 00:29:51,564
and now you even fear a mere Chief of the Royal Investigation Bureau?

330
00:29:51,564 --> 00:29:53,434
You should watch what you say.

331
00:29:53,434 --> 00:29:56,954
The kidnappers' bases continue to be found and captured one after another.

332
00:29:56,954 --> 00:30:00,614
Will you just sit around and watch?

333
00:30:00,614 --> 00:30:03,224
There will soon be a travel march to a temporary palace.

334
00:30:03,224 --> 00:30:05,484
Since Lee Sin Won will be a part of that trip,

335
00:30:05,484 --> 00:30:09,204
why don't we aim to use that opportunity?

336
00:30:09,204 --> 00:30:12,604
In a temporary palace where the king will stay, do you plan to shoot arrows or something?

337
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:16,744
No need for outsiders to get involved, don't you think?

338
00:30:19,464 --> 00:30:22,434
From far away, arrows may be used,

339
00:30:22,434 --> 00:30:26,154
but within close proximity, just one poisoned dart

340
00:30:26,154 --> 00:30:28,914
could kill a person, right?

341
00:30:28,914 --> 00:30:32,794
As long as there is someone close enough.

342
00:30:37,724 --> 00:30:39,224
Here and here.

343
00:30:41,024 --> 00:30:42,294
<i>Confession Map</i>

344
00:30:42,294 --> 00:30:43,644
<i>Confession Map
Woman: Flowers (5), Songs (2), Poems (1), Letters (1) </i>

345
00:30:43,644 --> 00:30:45,564
Game over.

346
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:55,064
Flowers, poems, songs, and letters...

347
00:30:55,764 --> 00:30:58,724
Aren't these a bit cringeworthy?

348
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:02,334
You really do not know a woman's heart, Your Majesty.

349
00:31:02,334 --> 00:31:05,864
There is no woman on earth who hates flowers.

350
00:31:07,374 --> 00:31:10,504
What about persuading her using words?

351
00:31:10,504 --> 00:31:13,774
You plan to engage in a debate with So Rang?

352
00:31:13,774 --> 00:31:15,794
Are you sure you are up for it?

353
00:31:15,794 --> 00:31:18,264
What flowers would she like, let's see...

354
00:31:18,264 --> 00:31:20,044
To prepare flowers...

355
00:31:24,014 --> 00:31:29,384
As you requested, this is the list of the court ladies who will be leaving the palace.

356
00:31:29,384 --> 00:31:34,094
First, we prioritized those who wished to leave the palace, but...

357
00:31:40,704 --> 00:31:41,944
<i>Ye So Rang</i>

358
00:31:44,044 --> 00:31:46,214
<i>Ye So Rang</i>

359
00:31:46,214 --> 00:31:49,434
Why is So Rang's name listed here?

360
00:31:56,584 --> 00:31:57,934
Your Majesty.

361
00:32:11,334 --> 00:32:13,684
What are you doing right now?

362
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:15,174
I was packing my things.

363
00:32:15,174 --> 00:32:17,384
Exactly. So why are you packing?

364
00:32:18,284 --> 00:32:21,894
You said you would soon head to the hot springs.

365
00:32:21,894 --> 00:32:24,984
But why are you suddenly getting angry with me?

366
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:28,804
Did I not already tell you that you are the king's woman? Yet what?

367
00:32:29,674 --> 00:32:32,064
You plan to leave the palace?

368
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:36,404
Then do you wish me to remain here against my will?

369
00:32:36,404 --> 00:32:39,674
- Against your will?
- Wherever my heart may be,

370
00:32:39,674 --> 00:32:42,564
are you saying you are fine as long as my physical body remains by your side?

371
00:32:42,564 --> 00:32:44,484
Then are you saying you were with me against your will all this time?

372
00:32:44,484 --> 00:32:47,314
No. Not up until now. But...

373
00:32:47,964 --> 00:32:50,054
I plan to leave now.

374
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:52,034
Why?

375
00:32:56,834 --> 00:32:58,324
You cannot go.

376
00:32:58,324 --> 00:33:01,094
No matter the reason, you may never leave.

377
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,894
Give me...

378
00:33:05,294 --> 00:33:07,874
some time as well.

379
00:33:07,874 --> 00:33:10,514
What do you mean, give you time?

380
00:33:38,674 --> 00:33:40,644
She will leave?

381
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:44,064
S-She will leave the palace?

382
00:34:09,334 --> 00:34:11,344
Crown Prince.

383
00:34:11,344 --> 00:34:13,924
Your Highness, wait for us!

384
00:34:13,924 --> 00:34:16,134
Your Highness, be careful.

385
00:34:16,134 --> 00:34:20,504
Crown Prince, stop running. You could trip like that!

386
00:34:20,504 --> 00:34:23,244
Crown Prince! You could trip like that!

387
00:34:23,244 --> 00:34:25,204
Aigoo, Your Highness...

388
00:34:32,344 --> 00:34:35,764
I was planning on confessing to her here.

389
00:34:49,104 --> 00:34:50,734
Your Majesty.

390
00:34:50,734 --> 00:34:52,504
We will do it, so leave us to it.

391
00:34:52,504 --> 00:34:54,834
- Please leave it.
- No, no. No.

392
00:34:54,834 --> 00:34:57,554
I will do it. I will do it. I will.

393
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,564
Your Majesty...

394
00:35:02,474 --> 00:35:04,374
Your Majesty!

395
00:35:05,264 --> 00:35:07,034
Your Majesty!

396
00:35:07,034 --> 00:35:09,154
Your Majesty!

397
00:35:09,154 --> 00:35:12,164
How about these flowers over here?

398
00:35:13,974 --> 00:35:16,114
Don't do that!

399
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,344
I do not need them.

400
00:35:18,344 --> 00:35:20,484
She is so intent on leaving,

401
00:35:20,484 --> 00:35:23,494
so what is the point of forcing her to be by my side?

402
00:35:23,494 --> 00:35:25,344
Well, that...

403
00:35:25,344 --> 00:35:27,834
That is because she does not know what your true feelings are.

404
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:31,744
Is that not why you came all the way here to show her your true feelings?

405
00:35:31,744 --> 00:35:37,384
Do you even know the real reason why So Rang is trying to leave the palace?

406
00:35:37,384 --> 00:35:39,694
- The real reason?
- Well,

407
00:35:39,694 --> 00:35:41,374
don't you think she may have something that is bothering her?

408
00:35:41,374 --> 00:35:46,824
For example, someone might be giving her a hard time, or perhaps her work at the palace does not match her tastes.

409
00:35:46,824 --> 00:35:50,424
Isn't it possible that the reason may not be you, Your Majesty?

410
00:36:05,694 --> 00:36:07,924
Head Eunuch, we do not know what will happen, so plant all of these flowers over there.

411
00:36:07,924 --> 00:36:10,624
so plant all of these flowers over there.

412
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,824
All of it.

413
00:36:11,824 --> 00:36:13,874
All this?

414
00:36:20,994 --> 00:36:22,734
Wow.

415
00:36:22,734 --> 00:36:24,874
Do you feel a bit better now that you are outside?

416
00:36:24,874 --> 00:36:26,494
Yes.

417
00:36:26,494 --> 00:36:29,814
Wow, it is so nice.

418
00:36:32,344 --> 00:36:35,474
I am doing a lot of good sightseeing.

419
00:36:37,044 --> 00:36:41,654
By now, the list of the court ladies who are leaving the palace should be finalized.

420
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:46,434
But ... why did you decide to leave?

421
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:52,144
I mean, just...

422
00:36:54,274 --> 00:36:56,184
You know.

423
00:36:56,834 --> 00:36:59,794
I do not belong in a place like this.

424
00:37:02,594 --> 00:37:05,134
It is bittersweet.

425
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:11,244
I quit my post as well.

426
00:37:11,244 --> 00:37:12,194
What?

427
00:37:12,194 --> 00:37:16,114
This journey will probably be my last responsibility.

428
00:37:16,114 --> 00:37:18,694
My time at the palace is also coming to an end.

No.

444

It is just that Chief Lee Sin Won said he was leaving his post.

445
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,874
He probably was

446
00:38:56,874 --> 00:39:00,314
going to tell you right away.

447
00:39:05,364 --> 00:39:07,744
Is the reason you are trying to leave the palace

448
00:39:08,344 --> 00:39:10,814
Sin Won?

449

No.

towards Chief Lee Sin Won.

452
00:39:25,204 --> 00:39:27,724
Or is it because of me?

453
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:35,374
Have I been making things difficult for you?

454
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:42,314
It is not like that.

455
00:39:42,314 --> 00:39:45,774
- Then, what is the reason—
- The fact that only I have genuine feelings for you

is difficult for me.

457

Being next to Your Majesty is difficult when I know you don't have feelings for me.

00:40:08,434 --> 00:40:12,144
Why do you think I brought you all the way here?

459
00:40:14,144 --> 00:40:18,294
Do you remember what I was like before I met you?

460
00:40:26,014 --> 00:40:27,794
You...

I was originally

going to confess to you here.

Aren't you going to accept it?

489
00:43:43,228 --> 00:43:45,408
W-We are going to be here all night at this rate.

490
00:43:45,408 --> 00:43:47,198
All night...

491
00:43:53,948 --> 00:43:55,948
The flowers...

492
00:43:57,038 --> 00:43:59,368
are so pretty.

493
00:44:02,158 --> 00:44:04,518
You are even prettier.

494
00:44:10,118 --> 00:44:12,528
Now,

495
00:44:12,528 --> 00:44:15,718
it would be all right for me to call you my beloved, right?

496
00:44:22,838 --> 00:44:26,348
You understand how I feel now, right?

497
00:44:36,598 --> 00:44:38,108
Come on.

498
00:44:39,798 --> 00:44:42,998
It's just a bit... Come on...

499
00:45:01,638 --> 00:45:07,758
♫ <i>I think about only you all day.</i> ♫

500
00:45:07,758 --> 00:45:18,058
♫ <i>Because I wonder if you know the way I feel</i> ♫

501
00:45:18,058 --> 00:45:27,960
♫ <i>Because I long for you, because I always want to see you</i> ♫

502
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,988
♫ <i>If I'm not with you for even a day</i> ♫

503
00:45:35,988 --> 00:45:42,978
♫ <i>I cannot do anything</i> ♫

504
00:45:42,978 --> 00:45:50,218
♫ <i>although I'm doing my best again</i> ♫

505
00:45:50,218 --> 00:45:54,258
♫ <i>to pretend to be calm and to pretend to be fine</i> ♫

506
00:45:54,258 --> 00:45:58,028
Outsiders should be strictly prohibited from entering this temporary palace.

507
00:45:58,028 --> 00:46:00,918
Since these are chaotic times, make sure to keep your guard up.

508
00:46:00,918 --> 00:46:02,648
Understood!

509
00:46:09,148 --> 00:46:10,978
Chun Seok.

510
00:46:12,648 --> 00:46:14,818
Is something wrong?

511
00:46:15,618 --> 00:46:17,798
No.

512
00:46:17,798 --> 00:46:20,728
Chief, are you really going to quit?

513
00:46:22,168 --> 00:46:23,828
Why?

514
00:46:24,398 --> 00:46:25,948
Chun Seok.

515
00:46:26,568 --> 00:46:28,918
It is because you are here that I can leave.

516
00:46:28,918 --> 00:46:31,338
Because you are doing such a good job.

517
00:46:32,018 --> 00:46:34,588
I will continue to investigate on my own,

518
00:46:34,588 --> 00:46:36,848
so if you need me,

519
00:46:36,848 --> 00:46:39,018
do not hesitate to seek me out.

520
00:46:42,018 --> 00:46:44,878
But you said you could not find corroborative evidence at that time, right?

521
00:46:44,878 --> 00:46:48,228
When you were searching inside the room of his excellency Ye Hyun Ho's concubine?

522
00:46:48,228 --> 00:46:49,828
Yes.

523
00:46:49,828 --> 00:46:52,258
- The drawers were empty.
- It was as if someone

524
00:46:52,258 --> 00:46:54,718
gave them a warning in advance.

525
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,600
Perhaps it did seem like that, or maybe not.

526
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:02,818
Do you think that perhaps someone from our bureau has been bought off by them?

527
00:47:04,258 --> 00:47:06,388
Those are my thoughts as well.

528
00:47:34,698 --> 00:47:36,268
Is that seat comfortable?

529
00:47:36,268 --> 00:47:37,248
Yes.

530
00:47:37,248 --> 00:47:41,038
When I am here, I can watch Your Majesty fall asleep.

531
00:47:42,218 --> 00:47:44,828
But you always end up falling asleep first.

532
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:46,328
When did I ever do that?

533
00:47:46,328 --> 00:47:49,288
Your eyes are swollen red.

534
00:48:03,238 --> 00:48:06,518
If you are tired, come in here.

535
00:48:06,518 --> 00:48:08,958
No, I am all right.

536
00:48:09,698 --> 00:48:11,248
Come on,

537
00:48:11,248 --> 00:48:12,608
I told you to come in here.

538
00:48:12,608 --> 00:48:14,498
I am fine like this.

539
00:48:15,448 --> 00:48:17,368
All right.

540
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,000
Let us just stay like this.

541
00:48:27,968 --> 00:48:29,988
All right.

542
00:48:33,308 --> 00:48:37,898
Your Majesty, when did you fall for me?

543
00:48:39,478 --> 00:48:41,828
Well...

544
00:48:41,828 --> 00:48:45,388
Oh, it is not just once or twice?

545
00:48:46,988 --> 00:48:49,838
Where did you get all this confidence from?

546
00:48:50,608 --> 00:48:53,538
Well, since I know I have that much charm.

547
00:48:53,538 --> 00:48:56,268
Who? Me!

548
00:48:58,158 --> 00:49:00,508
Oh. It was then.

549
00:49:02,318 --> 00:49:03,778
When you headbutt me,

550
00:49:03,778 --> 00:49:06,588
and dragged me into the pond.

551
00:49:06,588 --> 00:49:07,948
What?

552
00:49:09,278 --> 00:49:14,318
When the boar was chasing you and you just tripped and fell by yourself.

553
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,278
Really?

554
00:49:16,918 --> 00:49:20,098
Of course not. Am I crazy?

555
00:49:21,598 --> 00:49:23,508
It was when you were sleeping.

556
00:49:25,428 --> 00:49:30,038
During the day, you talk so much that I barely have time to look at your face.

557
00:49:30,038 --> 00:49:32,118
At least at night, there was

558
00:49:32,118 --> 00:49:35,278
somewhat of an opening for me to fall for you.

559
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:54,418
That is fascinating.

560
00:49:55,308 --> 00:50:00,098
I, too... fell for you when you were sleeping.

561
00:50:14,698 --> 00:50:17,578
What if you fall for me again...

562
00:50:20,348 --> 00:50:22,238
You should also be careful.

563
00:50:22,238 --> 00:50:25,018
I am going to show off my charms as well.

564
00:50:56,948 --> 00:50:58,828
Hey, Chun Seok.

565
00:50:59,768 --> 00:51:03,208
Last time, when I went to the jeweler at Daejeolgol,

566
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:05,978
I ended up buying a ring for some reason.

567
00:51:13,238 --> 00:51:16,518
I bought it even though I do not know when I will be giving it. So stupid of me.

568
00:51:17,138 --> 00:51:20,188
Why didn't you give it to her sooner?

569
00:51:20,188 --> 00:51:22,498
You don't know what the future will hold.

570
00:51:22,498 --> 00:51:23,728
What?

571
00:51:23,728 --> 00:51:26,278
Our job is like that.

572
00:51:26,278 --> 00:51:29,178
We do not know where and when

573
00:51:29,178 --> 00:51:31,188
we might die.

574
00:51:55,418 --> 00:51:56,968
<i>Shall we make a bet?</i>

575
00:51:56,968 --> 00:52:00,818
<i>Whether you are able to captivate the woman's heart or not.</i>

576
00:52:08,408 --> 00:52:11,228
<i>I shall place my bet that you will soon be arrested.</i>

577
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:12,788
<i>That is my bet.</i>

578
00:52:15,018 --> 00:52:16,898
<i>Then,</i>

579
00:52:17,848 --> 00:52:20,608
<i>would that young maiden be safe?</i>

580
00:52:20,608 --> 00:52:23,698
<i>The one who recently got kidnapped and returned...</i>

581
00:52:23,698 --> 00:52:26,478
<i>That pretty young maiden at Aedaldang.</i>

582
00:52:26,478 --> 00:52:28,488
<i>If you had to choose just one person, </i>

583
00:52:28,488 --> 00:52:30,218
<i>whom would you save...</i>

584
00:52:30,218 --> 00:52:32,328
<i>Between that maiden</i>

585
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:36,118
<i>and Chief Lee Sin Won?</i>

586
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:48,068
Chun Seok ...

587
00:52:50,428 --> 00:52:51,478
Chun Seok ...

588
00:52:51,478 --> 00:52:53,818
I am all right.

589
00:52:53,818 --> 00:52:57,118
I am glad that you are safe, Chief.

590
00:53:04,768 --> 00:53:07,558
No, Chun Seok... Chun Seok!

591
00:53:07,558 --> 00:53:09,708
Chief...

592
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,578
You don't know how grateful

593
00:53:13,578 --> 00:53:16,548
I have been the past several years to you, Chief.

594
00:53:16,548 --> 00:53:19,168
Your parents

595
00:53:19,168 --> 00:53:23,688
took an orphan like me in as if I was their real son.

596
00:53:24,448 --> 00:53:26,938
And you, Chief,

597
00:53:26,938 --> 00:53:30,488
took care of me as like your real younger brother.

598
00:53:33,038 --> 00:53:37,548
In this lonely world, I had a family

599
00:53:38,618 --> 00:53:42,098
and learned what love is.

600
00:53:44,698 --> 00:53:47,898
Now, I was going to try to do some loving of my own...

601
00:53:51,348 --> 00:53:53,608
I regret it now...

602
00:53:55,918 --> 00:53:58,038
It was I...

603
00:54:00,308 --> 00:54:03,078
who should have given it to her directly.

604
00:54:04,638 --> 00:54:06,408
Chun Seok...

605
00:54:06,408 --> 00:54:10,408
Y-You can personally give it to her.

606
00:54:10,408 --> 00:54:12,678
Hyeong-nim.

607
00:54:12,678 --> 00:54:14,008
Yes, Chun Seok.

608
00:54:14,008 --> 00:54:16,028
You should leave quickly!

609
00:54:16,028 --> 00:54:19,078
You need to go and catch the one who did this to me.

610
00:54:19,758 --> 00:54:23,128
At this rate, things might get dangerous for His Majesty as well.

611
00:54:23,128 --> 00:54:25,238
Hurry!

612
00:54:25,238 --> 00:54:28,038
Wait here for just a bit...

613
00:54:28,038 --> 00:54:30,418
Just wait a bit!

614
00:54:41,798 --> 00:54:43,928
Hae Yeong...

615
00:54:43,928 --> 00:54:45,838
In the next life,

616
00:54:46,858 --> 00:54:50,038
please like me a bit.

617
00:54:52,508 --> 00:54:54,158
Never mind.

618
00:54:55,698 --> 00:54:58,048
In the next life as well,

619
00:54:58,048 --> 00:55:00,488
I will be reborn as myself

620
00:55:01,508 --> 00:55:03,908
and love you

621
00:55:03,908 --> 00:55:06,098
to my heart's content.

622
00:55:17,888 --> 00:55:20,178
Your Majesty!

623
00:56:34,428 --> 00:56:37,968
<i>I should have told her then that I was attracted to her.</i>

624
00:56:41,488 --> 00:56:44,548
<i>I should have told her then that she was cute.</i>

625
00:56:47,798 --> 00:56:49,718
<i>I should have told her then...</i>

626
00:56:50,378 --> 00:56:53,198
<i>that she was pretty.</i>

627
00:57:21,558 --> 00:57:23,618
Sin Won...

628
00:57:30,778 --> 00:57:32,518
Lee Sin Won.

629
00:57:32,518 --> 00:57:34,608
Be careful.

630
00:57:34,608 --> 00:57:38,028
We do not know what other attacks there may be.

631
00:57:48,118 --> 00:57:49,928
Thoroughly search the surrounding area!

632
00:57:49,928 --> 00:57:51,888
Yes, Sire!

633
00:57:54,198 --> 00:57:55,558
S-Sin Won...

634
00:57:55,558 --> 00:57:57,778
I am sorry...

635
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:01,618
that I could not protect you to the end...

636
00:58:05,368 --> 00:58:08,668
Leaving me, your king, is disloyalty.

637
00:58:09,438 --> 00:58:13,068
And leaving me, your friend, is betrayal.

638
00:58:13,678 --> 00:58:16,588
So, at least for my sake, live.

639
00:58:17,978 --> 00:58:20,268
Do not forgive...

640
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:25,300
my disloyalty and my betrayal.

641
00:58:29,888 --> 00:58:31,818
Your Majesty...

642
00:58:32,748 --> 00:58:36,908
the butterfly cannot be made to fly

643
00:58:36,908 --> 00:58:41,678
with a sword nor with a flower.

644
00:58:41,678 --> 00:58:45,038
Only a spring breeze makes it fly.

645
00:58:46,558 --> 00:58:47,898
I...

646
00:58:47,898 --> 00:58:52,068
could not even become a yard for the butterfly to stay in,

647
00:58:53,028 --> 00:58:55,408
so Your Majesty, please

648
00:58:56,228 --> 00:58:59,268
become a spring breeze for the butterfly...

649
00:59:01,058 --> 00:59:03,298
for So Rang...

650
00:59:04,588 --> 00:59:07,318
and embrace her.

651
00:59:17,948 --> 00:59:19,718
S-Sin Won.

652
00:59:19,718 --> 00:59:21,618
S-Sin Won... Lee Sin Won...

653
00:59:21,618 --> 00:59:23,268
Lee Sin Won!

654
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,608
Wake up!

655
00:59:24,608 --> 00:59:26,068
Sin Won!

656
00:59:26,068 --> 00:59:27,258
Sin Won!

657
00:59:27,258 --> 00:59:30,018
Wake up, Sin Won!

658
01:00:28,668 --> 01:00:31,288
Boy...

659
01:01:48,508 --> 01:01:50,508
<i>Chun Seok...</i>

660
01:01:51,698 --> 01:01:54,018
<i>Chun Seok...</i>

661
01:01:57,958 --> 01:02:00,038
Chun Seok...

662
01:03:07,598 --> 01:03:10,168
How could this be...

663
01:03:17,958 --> 01:03:20,068
How could this be!

664
01:03:21,008 --> 01:03:24,468
How could this be!

665
01:04:38,348 --> 01:04:40,338
Sin Won...

666
01:04:44,138 --> 01:04:46,048
Are you all right?

667
01:04:48,838 --> 01:04:50,638
I thought...

668
01:04:51,998 --> 01:04:54,478
something happened to you, too...

669
01:04:54,478 --> 01:04:56,588
so I was so scared.

670
01:05:02,058 --> 01:05:04,398
Do not worry about me.

671
01:05:05,888 --> 01:05:07,268
Sin Won...

672
01:05:07,268 --> 01:05:09,028
So Rang.

673
01:05:12,518 --> 01:05:15,118
Being next to me is now very dangerous.

674
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:23,098
I don't know if I am able to protect anyone anymore.

675
01:05:25,188 --> 01:05:28,438
I cannot afford to lose you,

676
01:05:32,728 --> 01:05:36,048
so it would be best not to be close to each other any longer.

677
01:05:37,238 --> 01:05:39,508
So, we should...

678
01:05:42,888 --> 01:05:45,708
stop being friends.

679
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:54,068
I am sorry.

680
01:05:59,188 --> 01:06:00,868
Sin Won...
