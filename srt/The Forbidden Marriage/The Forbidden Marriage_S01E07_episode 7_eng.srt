00:00:35,374 --> 00:00:39,724
 This is a work of fiction. Characters, incidents, settings, titles, and content have no relevance to real life.

2
00:00:40,354 --> 00:00:43,654
Look at this.

3
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,964
What is that?

4
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:58,670

5
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,424
What's this?

6
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,250
Everyone, stay calm. This is the Investigation Bureau.

7
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,780
Don't be afraid. Come on out, ladies. Come on out.

8
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:49,054
Come on now. Over here.

9
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,614
Did anyone perhaps get kidnapped tonight and brought here?

10
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,834
Tonight?

11
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,324
I do remember seeing a rather unusual woman.

12
00:02:44,324 --> 00:02:49,830
She was definitely dragged here by force like the rest of us, but she was throwing a fit and bargained for her ransom.

13
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,904
 Hey, you guys! How dare you bargain on me in such a way!

14
00:02:52,904 --> 00:02:55,704
 If you'll take me away at such a cheap price, you might as well just kill me, right?

15
00:02:55,704 --> 00:02:58,914
 That would barely pay for my funeral!

16
00:02:58,914 --> 00:03:00,474
 - Here.
 - Hey, hey!

17
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:03,744
 That! The cost of my body! Why do you split that amongst yourselves, huh?

18
00:03:03,744 --> 00:03:06,264
 Such a loud and annoying hostage you are!

19
00:03:06,264 --> 00:03:09,974
 Just give me half! Half of half?

20
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,914
I am certain it was So Rang.

21
00:03:13,914 --> 00:03:15,194
It does seem so.

22
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:19,484
Also, there was a woman crying in a corner,  clutching on some good-luck bag.

23
00:03:19,484 --> 00:03:24,714
She was crying so much that other woman kept comforting her, saying  it's all right, it's all right.

24
00:03:24,714 --> 00:03:29,104
 It's all right. Hae Yeong, it will be all right. Why that...

25
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,100
Hae Yeong...

26
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,184
Maiden Hae Yeong.

27
00:03:33,184 --> 00:03:35,394
The woman who was crying was taken away first.

28
00:03:35,394 --> 00:03:38,914
As for the whereabouts of the strange woman, though, I am not so sure.

29
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:41,304
Understood.

30
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,674
First of all, escort these women safely to the government office.

31
00:03:43,674 --> 00:03:46,124
Yes, sir. Come, ladies, let's go.

32
00:03:46,124 --> 00:03:47,364
Thank you so much...

33
00:03:47,364 --> 00:03:49,904
Thank you so much!

34
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,554
 Picked it up on the way here. You seemed to like such things, Hae Yeong.

35
00:04:02,554 --> 00:04:05,894
 She said that such roundish stones would also hold a kind heart.

36
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,714
Chief! Look at this!

37
00:04:12,714 --> 00:04:15,514
- What is that? 
 - It is the stone I gave to Hae Yeong before.

38
00:04:15,514 --> 00:04:18,124
This was definitely left as a signal.

39
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,024
Maiden Hae Yeong...

40
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,804
There we go...

41
00:04:40,134 --> 00:04:42,534
 Episode 7

42
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,204
Looking at the particular loveliness of the moonlight tonight,

43
00:04:49,204 --> 00:04:52,234
how great would it be to have a wife just as lovely?

44
00:04:52,234 --> 00:04:57,294
I, for one, can attest for sure this time! You will definitely be satisfied!

45
00:04:57,294 --> 00:05:01,164
I say this for your benefit. Is it not about time we part ways?

46
00:05:01,164 --> 00:05:05,884
Of course. Tonight, you can look forward to it without a doubt, sir.

47
00:05:05,884 --> 00:05:07,664
All right.

48
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,234
Right!

49
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,004
What do you think? She pleases you, right?

50
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,694
She's quite cute.

51
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,804
Sir.

52
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:32,004
Aigoo, such a big amount! I shall take my leave then, sir.

53
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,714
My bride, it is nice to meet you.

54
00:06:34,714 --> 00:06:37,354
I am Um Gye Hun.

55
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,064
I like short hair, you see.

56
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,364
You can concede at least that much for your husband, right?

57
00:06:49,364 --> 00:06:53,154
Thankfully, it looks good on you.

58
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,804
Apart from that, there are some other preferences I would like you to adhere to.

59
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,214
I shall tell you about them in time.

60
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,494
We will head this way.

61
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,624
Then we will search in another direction.

62
00:07:34,624 --> 00:07:37,684
Yes, sir. Let us go.

63
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,834
Anyone home?

64
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,594
What brings you here late at night?

65
00:07:55,594 --> 00:07:58,724
We are from the Investigation Bureau. Could we search your house for a moment?

66
00:07:58,724 --> 00:08:01,154
We are looking for a woman who has been kidnapped.

67
00:08:01,154 --> 00:08:04,254
Upon my word, how terrible.

68
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,154
Please do look around as much as you need.

69
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,674
Over there.

70
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,320
Maiden Hae Yeong...was here...

71
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,714
- Hae Yeong.
 - Maiden Hae Yeong...

72
00:09:22,714 --> 00:09:24,114
- Hae Young! 
 - Maiden Hae Yeong!

73
00:09:24,114 --> 00:09:27,340
Hae Yeong...Hae Yeong!

74
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,614
Hae Yeong!

75
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,694
Hae Yeong! Hae Yeong!

76
00:09:32,694 --> 00:09:33,754
- Hae Yeong!
 - Maiden Hae Yeong!

77
00:09:33,754 --> 00:09:35,514
- Hae Yeong, wake up!
 - Maiden Hae Yeong!

78
00:09:35,514 --> 00:09:38,604
Hae Yeong! Hae Yeong!

79
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,134
I do not like others touching

80
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,644
my possessions that I have already paid for.

81
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,074
Take your hands off her immediately.

82
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,364
That bastard.

83
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,034
Who the hell are you?

84
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,434
Are you hurt anywhere?

85
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,094
Thanks to you, my life has been spared.

86
00:12:22,434 --> 00:12:24,394
How in the world is she still alive?

87
00:12:24,394 --> 00:12:27,444
What exactly do you plan to do with her?

88
00:12:27,444 --> 00:12:30,304
Tonight, we must get rid of her completely.

89
00:12:30,304 --> 00:12:32,434
Should we perhaps set this place on fire?

90
00:12:32,434 --> 00:12:35,414
Lay a hand on her like that, and we'll be caught red-handed.

91
00:12:35,414 --> 00:12:37,164
As you already know,

92
00:12:37,164 --> 00:12:40,894
I do not leave behind even a grain of corroborative evidence.

93
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:44,884
If we don't kill her today, she will bring upon us more trouble in the future.

94
00:12:44,884 --> 00:12:47,224
Look at the big picture.

95
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:52,154
We can use this girl to greatly shake King Yi Heon.

96
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:57,854
If we were to kill her by hanging her right in front of the king's very eyes,

97
00:12:57,854 --> 00:13:01,634
it's quite possible that the repetitive trauma

98
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:05,204
may even cause him to step down from the throne.

99
00:13:05,204 --> 00:13:09,774
But I need to see her die right away to feel any relief...

100
00:13:13,374 --> 00:13:15,334
Why don't we just kill her now

101
00:13:15,334 --> 00:13:19,304
and place her dead body in the king's bedchamber?

102
00:13:19,304 --> 00:13:24,104
Lift the blankets and she's lying there dead?

103
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:26,714
Sounds good to me.

104
00:13:26,714 --> 00:13:30,834
As long as it makes a mess of the king...

105
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:34,914
Just wait for a moment. The blood will be on Na Sang Ju's hands.

106
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:38,954
Ah, once all this is over, there is one more thing I must ask of you.

107
00:13:38,954 --> 00:13:41,334
Please go and kidnap a few more women.

108
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:43,634
Have I not been doing so all this time?

109
00:13:43,634 --> 00:13:48,204
This time around, they are not just ordinary women.

110
00:13:48,204 --> 00:13:52,904
They are all precious daughters from noble households.

111
00:13:55,934 --> 00:13:58,014
Oh, so what you're saying is,

112
00:13:58,014 --> 00:14:01,614
you plan to narrow down the spouse selection from the start, huh?

113
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:09,914
Your Majesty, you may want to take a look at this.

114
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:11,894
Open the box.

115
00:14:15,994 --> 00:14:17,694
 His Majesty?

116
00:14:17,694 --> 00:14:21,994
 Then the one who saved me is none other than... the king himself?

117
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:25,044
It seems to me that many women were victimized like that,

118
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:28,454
yet their whereabouts are unknown.

119
00:14:28,454 --> 00:14:31,364
Thoroughly investigate the crimes this man has committed thus far!

120
00:14:31,364 --> 00:14:33,014
Yes, Sire!

121
00:14:38,374 --> 00:14:39,824
Is it not strange?

122
00:14:39,824 --> 00:14:43,604
Groups of kidnappers are raging about and causing distress to women

123
00:14:43,604 --> 00:14:48,334
but the authorities have not yet captured even one of them.

124
00:14:50,244 --> 00:14:54,124
What wrong have I done? H-hey, wait...

125
00:14:57,474 --> 00:15:01,364
It's him! The kidnapper who sold me off!

126
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,894
Where is your headquarters?

127
00:15:14,684 --> 00:15:17,714
The palace guards are approaching as we speak.

128
00:15:17,714 --> 00:15:19,684
How did they find out about this place?

129
00:15:20,514 --> 00:15:21,854
Sang Ju, listen up.

130
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:25,404
You must kill this bitch and place her dead body in the crown princess's palace tonight.

131
00:15:25,404 --> 00:15:27,724
Do you understand?

132
00:15:27,724 --> 00:15:31,794
Yes, I understand. For now, let's all escape the premises.

133
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,654
Are you sure this is the place?

134
00:15:56,654 --> 00:15:59,274
If they're not here, I do not know where else they could be.

135
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:02,864
I really do not know. Where in the world did they go...

136
00:16:34,364 --> 00:16:36,244
Who are you bastards?

137
00:16:36,244 --> 00:16:40,144
- Would you know if we told you? 
 - Why not? They might know.

138
00:16:40,144 --> 00:16:43,194
We've robbed them kidnappers a bit, did we not?

139
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:48,534
So, to pass through this mountain, you may need a bit of our permission, you see...

140
00:16:48,534 --> 00:16:51,434
I think that's all you need to know.

141
00:16:51,434 --> 00:16:55,714
But I'm not so sure we can give you that permission.

142
00:17:03,434 --> 00:17:05,694
- What should we do?
 - Damn!

143
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:34,034
 What's going on? Have they really captured me?

144
00:17:36,664 --> 00:17:39,544
A fight has erupted between two large groups on Mount Sinwung.

145
00:17:39,544 --> 00:17:41,304
One side appears to be the group of kidnappers,

146
00:17:41,304 --> 00:17:44,524
I'm not so sure as for the others... They are most likely bandits.

147
00:17:44,524 --> 00:17:48,654
The bandits must have stolen the kidnapped women from their kidnappers.

148
00:17:48,654 --> 00:17:52,314
- What did you say? 
 - On mountainous terrain, the bandits are more familiar with the area.

149
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:56,404
They are horrid men capable of even knocking out tigers!

150
00:17:59,384 --> 00:18:03,464
I've told the head eunuch that I shall return before dawn, but it seems I will not be able to do so.

151
00:18:03,464 --> 00:18:06,444
- Go and let him know. 
 - Yes, Sire.

152
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:09,234
Your Majesty, leave the search for So Rang to us.

153
00:18:09,234 --> 00:18:12,534
Who knows what will happen if we let the night go by?

154
00:18:13,664 --> 00:18:17,064
Let us all go to Mount Sinwung.

155
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:23,884
 You must stay alive.

156
00:18:23,884 --> 00:18:26,384
 You must not be hurt, by any means.

157
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:30,584
 I will no longer lose anyone who is by my side.

158
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:34,254
 Please... Please...

159
00:18:41,304 --> 00:18:44,774
What! They took her?

160
00:18:44,774 --> 00:18:47,894
I will gather more kidnappers and head out again, sir.

161
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:51,794
Even her dead body is fine.

162
00:18:51,794 --> 00:18:57,354
- Without fail, bring her back here.
 - Yes, sir.

163
00:19:09,284 --> 00:19:11,954
Starting now, we will search the mountain by separating into three parties.

164
00:19:11,954 --> 00:19:16,044
The party to find the bandits first must immediately signal by smoke.

165
00:19:16,044 --> 00:19:18,374
- Start the search.
 - Yes, sir.

166
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:36,274
You go...

167
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:46,584
Od's blood ... scared me...

168
00:19:58,944 --> 00:20:01,104
 What's with the atmosphere?

169
00:20:01,104 --> 00:20:04,194
 What... Am I dead again?

170
00:20:04,194 --> 00:20:07,954
Are you all right, maiden?

171
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:22,814
 What...  W-What... Who is this man?

172
00:20:24,274 --> 00:20:30,334
The sun is up. So why is he not back yet?

173
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:33,574
Did you not hear he will not be able to return today?

174
00:20:33,574 --> 00:20:36,474
Then when exactly does he plan to return?

175
00:20:36,474 --> 00:20:38,044
Goodness...

176
00:20:44,354 --> 00:20:47,394
What brings you two out here in the crack of dawn?

177
00:20:47,394 --> 00:20:50,084
That is what I would like to ask you.

178
00:20:50,084 --> 00:20:54,814
What brings Your Excellency to attend the royal court at this hour?

179
00:20:56,074 --> 00:20:59,834
 The fact that the head eunuch and head court lady are both out here waiting...

180
00:20:59,834 --> 00:21:03,124
 Does that perhaps mean King Yi Heon is outside?

181
00:21:03,124 --> 00:21:05,704
 All because of that girl...

182
00:21:06,664 --> 00:21:11,474
I have an urgent matter to discuss and seek an audience with the king.

183
00:21:11,474 --> 00:21:13,704
This early in the morning?

184
00:21:15,144 --> 00:21:19,154
Today, His Majesty has worsening cold symptoms

185
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:23,614
and therefore cannot attend any royal audience.

186
00:21:24,724 --> 00:21:29,884
Then, has he seen the physician and been prescribed medication?

187
00:21:29,884 --> 00:21:34,454
- We are about to summon him now. 
 - Let us go then. I shall go with you.

188
00:21:41,004 --> 00:21:44,064
Yong Bae and Gyu Bong, take your leave.

189
00:21:46,854 --> 00:21:48,784
No funny business!

190
00:21:57,564 --> 00:22:00,744
So... where is this place?

191
00:22:00,744 --> 00:22:02,504
Come forward.

192
00:22:28,794 --> 00:22:31,124
Oh, my! Very good, very good!

193
00:22:31,124 --> 00:22:33,374
Good job!

194
00:22:34,784 --> 00:22:37,074
Goo goo gaga...

195
00:22:37,074 --> 00:22:39,554
This place is called Kkong Nyang Chon. Affection Village.

196
00:22:39,554 --> 00:22:41,594
I am the community leader here,

197
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:43,034
Ban Ran Tan.

198
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,824
Ban Ran Tan?

199
00:22:47,594 --> 00:22:50,784
Why exactly am I here?

200
00:22:50,784 --> 00:22:56,224
We have been rescuing the women who are kidnapped and almost harassed.

201
00:22:56,224 --> 00:22:59,914
Among them, those who refuse to return to their hometown

202
00:22:59,914 --> 00:23:01,964
are now gathered and live here.

203
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,824
Also, in the land of Joseon, where marriage is banned,

204
00:23:04,824 --> 00:23:07,034
lovers who have eloped

205
00:23:07,034 --> 00:23:10,174
have settled down here.

206
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,980
I also adore you!

207
00:23:23,984 --> 00:23:26,084
They look alike.

208
00:23:27,204 --> 00:23:28,764
So cute!

209
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:32,564
Oh, is that why it's called "Kkong Nyang Chon"*?
("Kkong-nyang" means lovey-dovey, "Chon" means village)

210
00:23:36,144 --> 00:23:39,814
There are a few things I would like to ask you, Maiden.

211
00:23:40,494 --> 00:23:45,074
By any chance, among people close to you, is anyone associated with the Investigation Bureau?

212
00:23:45,074 --> 00:23:47,564
Oh! My best friend...

213
00:23:50,624 --> 00:23:52,154
Investigation Bureau, no way.

214
00:23:52,154 --> 00:23:54,134
More like a lonely old bachelor!

215
00:23:54,134 --> 00:23:56,394
He couldn't get married.

216
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:59,514
Then, Maiden...

217
00:23:59,514 --> 00:24:02,224
what did you use to do before coming here?

218
00:24:04,594 --> 00:24:08,784
So, the rumors about me being so skilled have not reached here?

219
00:24:08,784 --> 00:24:12,374
I am the one and only teller of all secrets, a compatibility reader,

220
00:24:12,374 --> 00:24:14,174
So Rang!

221
00:24:15,804 --> 00:24:18,354
Are you people not aware of Aedaldang in Insagol?

222
00:24:18,354 --> 00:24:21,424
On the outside, it looks like an ordinary fortune-telling tea house,

223
00:24:21,424 --> 00:24:24,994
but we do compatibility reading for young men and women in secret.

224
00:24:24,994 --> 00:24:27,984
It's the kind of place where we connect

225
00:24:27,984 --> 00:24:29,564
the forbidden relationships.

226
00:24:29,564 --> 00:24:32,664
Oh, my! Now that I think of it,

227
00:24:32,664 --> 00:24:35,934
we are both working in the same field!

228
00:24:38,904 --> 00:24:39,904
Is that right?

229
00:24:39,904 --> 00:24:41,464
Yes!

230
00:24:41,464 --> 00:24:44,244
Forgive me for questioning you as if I was interrogating you.

231
00:24:44,244 --> 00:24:49,914
Because this place needs to exist in complete secrecy.

232
00:24:50,734 --> 00:24:53,324
Well, that's all right.

233
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,544
I want to thank you very much

234
00:24:56,544 --> 00:24:58,004
for rescuing me from the kidnappers.

235
00:24:58,004 --> 00:24:59,994
Then is it all right with you if I leave now?

236
00:24:59,994 --> 00:25:02,214
I need to rush over to somewhere.

237
00:25:02,214 --> 00:25:07,514
Unfortunately, until it is certain that we can trust you,

238
00:25:07,514 --> 00:25:09,664
you are forbidden from leaving the premises.

239
00:25:09,664 --> 00:25:12,084
Please understand.

240
00:25:12,084 --> 00:25:14,944
We are labelled as law-breakers in this land.

241
00:25:14,944 --> 00:25:17,474
So, it is a way for us to protect ourselves.

242
00:25:35,924 --> 00:25:39,064
Remain here, Your Majesty. We will take care of it.

243
00:25:58,164 --> 00:25:59,764
Wait, then, you two...

244
00:25:59,764 --> 00:26:02,854
You are getting married without even checking compatibility?

245
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:05,104
Dear me!

246
00:26:05,104 --> 00:26:07,764
There may be much to skip in the marriage process,

247
00:26:07,764 --> 00:26:09,864
but not this!

248
00:26:12,354 --> 00:26:14,394
Now, listen up, everyone.

249
00:26:14,394 --> 00:26:17,154
Why should we check compatibility?

250
00:26:17,154 --> 00:26:18,564
Regarding compatibility,

251
00:26:18,564 --> 00:26:22,464
there is both outside compatibility and inner* compatibility.
 (Referring to sexual compatibility)

252
00:26:25,314 --> 00:26:31,374
However, we cannot try out the inner compatibility before marriage.

253
00:26:31,374 --> 00:26:33,294
Thus, it's very important to do a reading of one's fortune and destiny,

254
00:26:33,294 --> 00:26:37,034
to predict inner compatibility beforehand, you see!

255
00:26:37,034 --> 00:26:38,874
- Oh, I see! 
 - Got it?

256
00:26:40,294 --> 00:26:41,674
But I mean,

257
00:26:41,674 --> 00:26:43,444
if you two already have figured it out,

258
00:26:43,444 --> 00:26:45,864
then skip it!

259
00:26:55,294 --> 00:26:57,064
So Rang...

260
00:26:57,064 --> 00:26:58,964
Your Majesty.

261
00:26:58,964 --> 00:27:00,894
There are too many of them.

262
00:27:00,894 --> 00:27:02,934
Once the palace guards gather, then—

263
00:27:02,934 --> 00:27:04,574
Your—

264
00:27:04,574 --> 00:27:06,704
Your Majesty!

265
00:27:08,914 --> 00:27:10,354
His Majesty?

266
00:27:10,354 --> 00:27:13,844
Who dares taunt a court lady of the king!

267
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:23,144
Who dares to put a hand on the best friend of an Investigation Bureau chief?

268
00:27:25,884 --> 00:27:28,594
It appears you were

269
00:27:29,974 --> 00:27:33,684
not really a trustworthy person, Maiden.

270
00:27:49,324 --> 00:27:50,884
Court Lady Won.

271
00:27:50,884 --> 00:27:53,584
What in the world do you plan to do?

272
00:27:53,584 --> 00:27:55,934
Dear goodness, seriously!

273
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:02,074
Please wait here for a moment.

274
00:28:05,034 --> 00:28:07,534
Oh, dear...

275
00:28:14,884 --> 00:28:16,304
Head Court Lady...

276
00:28:16,304 --> 00:28:17,564
Court Lady Won!

277
00:28:17,564 --> 00:28:19,364
Court Lady Won!

278
00:28:20,654 --> 00:28:23,764
What in the world do you exactly plan to do?

279
00:28:28,264 --> 00:28:30,254
Oh, dear me!

280
00:28:34,344 --> 00:28:36,514
What are you doing, Court Lady Won?

281
00:28:41,334 --> 00:28:42,394
Lie still.

282
00:28:42,394 --> 00:28:44,724
I mean, this is...

283
00:28:49,944 --> 00:28:51,904
Please come in.

284
00:29:03,004 --> 00:29:05,504
Y-Your Majesty.

285
00:29:05,504 --> 00:29:08,774
I will check your pulse.

286
00:29:14,384 --> 00:29:19,544
Was the king's hand... always... this thick?

287
00:29:19,544 --> 00:29:22,054
He has suffered quite a lot overnight.

288
00:29:22,054 --> 00:29:23,734
Huh?

289
00:29:23,734 --> 00:29:25,304
Was his...

290
00:29:25,304 --> 00:29:28,774
his build... a-a-all this...

291
00:29:28,774 --> 00:29:32,034
W-Was he always this big?

292
00:29:33,294 --> 00:29:36,784
It seems he has grown very swollen overall.

293
00:29:36,784 --> 00:29:38,904
That can't be...

294
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:40,634
Just because of swelling,

295
00:29:40,634 --> 00:29:44,394
h-how can a person grow to be this size?

296
00:29:45,934 --> 00:29:48,394
His Majesty would like to rest at the moment!

297
00:29:48,394 --> 00:29:50,784
Please come back in the afternoon to measure his pulse.

298
00:29:50,784 --> 00:29:53,854
S-Strange... so strange...

299
00:29:58,884 --> 00:30:00,634
So Rang.

300
00:30:01,454 --> 00:30:03,434
Do you have any injuries?

301
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:07,744
I believe I should ask you that, Your Majesty.

302
00:30:14,084 --> 00:30:18,284
Wait, w-what did you call that person just now?

303
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:20,044
Your Majesty?

304
00:30:22,314 --> 00:30:25,794
His name is Yi Jeon Ha, you see.
 (sounds like "jeonha" = His Majesty)

305
00:30:25,794 --> 00:30:28,234
I see...

306
00:30:28,234 --> 00:30:31,194
Then we should just call him that Yi fella from now on!

307
00:30:31,194 --> 00:30:33,944
Yi fella, yes.

308
00:30:33,944 --> 00:30:35,864
To attack right away

309
00:30:35,864 --> 00:30:38,034
was not my idea.

310
00:30:38,034 --> 00:30:39,864
It was my idea.

311
00:30:39,864 --> 00:30:41,694
Are you all right?

312
00:30:41,694 --> 00:30:43,194
That maiden...

313
00:30:43,194 --> 00:30:45,244
I thought she was a good person,

314
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:46,774
but she dares bring a palace guard here?

315
00:30:46,774 --> 00:30:49,264
- To be exact, it wasn't me who—
 - Shut your trap!

316
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:54,144
Would you like a taste of how we protected this Affection Village up until now?

317
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:57,504
Is it true the king has stepped out of the palace?

318
00:30:57,504 --> 00:31:01,874
As we try to catch the mouse, a cat naturally follows.

319
00:31:01,874 --> 00:31:03,044
What do you intend to do?

320
00:31:03,044 --> 00:31:05,774
If the king has disappeared,

321
00:31:05,774 --> 00:31:08,214
we must discuss the vacancy in his position.

322
00:31:08,214 --> 00:31:09,394
Then...

323
00:31:09,394 --> 00:31:11,710
Even if we have to find a royal family member living in the countryside,

324
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:16,520
we should seat a puppet on the throne, don't you think?

325
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,804
King Yi Heon...

326
00:31:18,804 --> 00:31:21,464
shall never be able to return to the palace

327
00:31:21,464 --> 00:31:24,064
and will be discovered as a corpse.

328
00:31:24,064 --> 00:31:26,734
But should this plan fail,

329
00:31:26,734 --> 00:31:28,844
we will be convicted of treason!

330
00:31:28,844 --> 00:31:31,964
We cannot let that happen now, can we?

331
00:31:31,964 --> 00:31:37,134
To die away from the palace at the hands of petty bandits...

332
00:31:37,134 --> 00:31:39,114
Or...

333
00:31:40,054 --> 00:31:44,084
it would also be good if he is killed by a tiger...

334
00:31:44,754 --> 00:31:48,654
Why on earth have you lied to us?

335
00:31:49,664 --> 00:31:51,794
It is not a lie!

336
00:31:53,474 --> 00:31:55,404
I was channeling spirits.

337
00:32:00,204 --> 00:32:05,534
Multiple spirits enter and leave my body, you see...

338
00:32:07,144 --> 00:32:10,874
Oh, my! S-So Rang! Are you channeling spirits again?

339
00:32:12,924 --> 00:32:13,884
Whoa...

340
00:32:13,884 --> 00:32:15,464
S-She... She's possessed!

341
00:32:15,464 --> 00:32:18,284
The shaman is channeling spirits!

342
00:32:24,884 --> 00:32:26,824
What...

343
00:32:29,744 --> 00:32:32,034
 W-What in the world...

344
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:37,434
Something's entering!

345
00:32:37,444 --> 00:32:38,904
Look!

346
00:32:48,554 --> 00:32:50,224
Go on over.

347
00:33:06,864 --> 00:33:08,834
Orabeoni*?
 (=elder brother)

348
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:14,794
You've come, Orabeoni!

349
00:33:14,794 --> 00:33:17,104
It's me, Ran Hui!

350
00:33:20,434 --> 00:33:22,884
I am so sorry, Orabeoni.

351
00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:25,564
Because I left so suddenly...

352
00:33:25,564 --> 00:33:28,594
You were in quite a shock, right?

353
00:33:29,394 --> 00:33:33,264
You say you are my youngest sister Ran Hui?

354
00:33:33,264 --> 00:33:39,564
You cried a lot because I got kidnapped, Orabeoni.

355
00:33:39,564 --> 00:33:41,944
But did you know that

356
00:33:41,944 --> 00:33:47,074
every time you cried, Orabeoni, I was right beside you?

357
00:33:57,464 --> 00:34:00,274
R-Ran Hui...

358
00:34:01,174 --> 00:34:03,414
You should have cried only a little.

359
00:34:03,414 --> 00:34:06,694
Then I would have only been a little sad.

360
00:34:08,124 --> 00:34:13,174
I did not even know that you were beside me...

361
00:34:13,174 --> 00:34:17,544
But, me getting kidnapped I do not think that was my fault.

362
00:34:17,544 --> 00:34:19,424
Bad people are to blame.

363
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:22,144
It is not that I did something wrong.

364
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:23,504
Of course!

365
00:34:23,504 --> 00:34:25,444
Why would you blame yourself?

366
00:34:25,444 --> 00:34:28,724
That would definitely not be the case. Absolutely not.

367
00:34:33,914 --> 00:34:35,844
So...

368
00:34:35,844 --> 00:34:41,244
Orabeoni, you should stop blaming yourself as well.

369
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:45,734
The reason why you rescue kidnapped women

370
00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:51,094
is because all of them remind you of me.

371
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:59,864
Here, you help loved ones connect,

372
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:04,754
and help them to live here and protect them.

373
00:35:04,754 --> 00:35:07,254
Because you did a lot of good things,

374
00:35:07,254 --> 00:35:11,214
I was able to go to a good place.

375
00:35:12,534 --> 00:35:15,854
I came here today to say this.

376
00:35:15,854 --> 00:35:18,794
Since you are the best, Orabeoni,

377
00:35:18,794 --> 00:35:23,244
you don't have to feel sorry about me any longer.

378
00:35:24,174 --> 00:35:26,344
Ran Hui ...

379
00:35:26,344 --> 00:35:30,984
You can send me off, right?

380
00:35:33,254 --> 00:35:35,194
Of course.

381
00:35:35,194 --> 00:35:37,214
My Ran Hui ...

382
00:35:39,564 --> 00:35:42,284
you should go to a good place.

383
00:35:43,874 --> 00:35:46,124
And the people here...

384
00:35:46,124 --> 00:35:50,844
They are all good people so do not harm them.

385
00:35:50,844 --> 00:35:55,124
They will for sure help bring about a good world.

386
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:57,534
Right.

387
00:36:04,324 --> 00:36:08,374
Then I will be on my way.

388
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:11,614
Be well, Orabeoni.

389
00:36:41,484 --> 00:36:43,924
So what kind of place is this?

390
00:36:43,924 --> 00:36:48,404
It is a place where those who have not forgotten that love is the most important thing in life

391
00:36:48,404 --> 00:36:51,334
have gathered and are living together.

392
00:36:58,804 --> 00:37:00,254
All right.

393
00:37:00,254 --> 00:37:03,074
Come here. Why are you crying?

394
00:37:04,214 --> 00:37:07,294
All right, one, two, three! Take away one!

395
00:37:07,294 --> 00:37:09,184
Oh! You won again.

396
00:37:09,184 --> 00:37:12,254
Aigoo, I must be stupid!

397
00:37:22,214 --> 00:37:27,084
Everyone comforts one another and takes care of each other.

398
00:37:30,944 --> 00:37:34,254
Now, bow to each other.

399
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:40,164
We informally held this wedding,

400
00:37:40,164 --> 00:37:45,554
so I pronounce that these two have become husband and wife for life.

401
00:37:51,294 --> 00:37:55,164
Now, I will protect you forever.

402
00:38:00,034 --> 00:38:05,094
It is a place where we help those in love connect despite it being prohibited by the government.

403
00:38:30,354 --> 00:38:35,134
Those men over there used to live as bandits on Mount Sinwung.

404
00:38:35,134 --> 00:38:37,164
However, they were inspired by how we were

405
00:38:37,164 --> 00:38:40,234
living together as one, connected through love.

406
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:44,614
So now they protect our Affection Village.

407
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:47,444
They seem like really good people.

408
00:38:49,364 --> 00:38:50,214
Well...

409
00:38:50,214 --> 00:38:52,114
S-S-So...

410
00:38:52,114 --> 00:38:53,634
Miss Shaman...

411
00:38:53,634 --> 00:38:55,544
- I have a question...
 - Yes?

412
00:38:55,544 --> 00:39:00,714
I-I-I know we look like this, but we are not so rough.

413
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:04,314
Having seen the people here live affectionately with their loved ones,

414
00:39:04,314 --> 00:39:07,214
we also want to get married—

415
00:39:07,944 --> 00:39:10,874
and get a wife, too.

416
00:39:10,874 --> 00:39:15,184
We were wondering when we would be able to find our match.

417
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:21,034
This man here holds the answer to that.

418
00:39:22,034 --> 00:39:23,534
Me?

419
00:39:24,524 --> 00:39:26,744
Are you going to reveal that I am the king here?

420
00:39:26,744 --> 00:39:31,064
Have you, by chance heard of a blind date for introducing people to each other?

421
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:32,084
A blind date?

422
00:39:32,084 --> 00:39:35,754
How about having a group blind date with some women?

423
00:39:35,754 --> 00:39:37,434
Oh, that would be great!

424
00:39:37,434 --> 00:39:38,584
What do you mean a group blind date?

425
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:42,554
The one who will coordinate that meeting is this man!

426
00:39:42,554 --> 00:39:44,504
Gosh ...

427
00:39:44,504 --> 00:39:46,124
Do not be shocked.

428
00:39:46,124 --> 00:39:51,054
The women he will be bringing to the meeting are court ladies!

429
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:55,044
Oh, my gosh.

430
00:39:59,344 --> 00:40:02,244
 Since days of old, when many disasters fell upon the nation,

431
00:40:02,244 --> 00:40:06,564
 it was considered to be because of the resentment of the palace ladies who could not marry.

432
00:40:06,564 --> 00:40:09,354
 Thus, they would send dozens of court ladies out of the palace

433
00:40:09,354 --> 00:40:14,514
 and help them get married, praying for the restoration of the nation.

434
00:40:15,414 --> 00:40:16,994
S-So?

435
00:40:16,994 --> 00:40:20,934
Even if those ladies were to leave the palace, what more would they be than Sul Ros*?
(Single, solo)

436
00:40:20,934 --> 00:40:22,244
So,

437
00:40:22,244 --> 00:40:26,404
would it not be good to hold a group blind introduction meeting?

438
00:40:26,404 --> 00:40:32,134
However, all of this depends on the one coordinating this, Yi fella!

439
00:40:32,134 --> 00:40:34,864
Who is this Yi person to be responsible for this?

440
00:40:34,864 --> 00:40:38,174
This man is...

441
00:40:38,174 --> 00:40:40,104
this nation's...

442
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,664
- Lower your hand!
 - eunuch!

443
00:40:43,464 --> 00:40:44,624
He does not have it?

444
00:40:44,624 --> 00:40:45,854
He looks perfectly fine...

445
00:40:45,854 --> 00:40:48,774
There's someone who is worse off than we are!

446
00:40:48,774 --> 00:40:51,284
I'm perfectly fine! I have, I have—

447
00:40:51,284 --> 00:40:52,614
Oh, come on now.

448
00:40:52,614 --> 00:40:56,444
Sir Yi, you will arrange this meeting for them, right?

449
00:40:59,634 --> 00:41:01,604
I will.

450
00:41:02,404 --> 00:41:09,524
I will request the king, His Majesty, to send out the court ladies.

451
00:41:09,524 --> 00:41:11,974
Hey, come over here! Join us!

452
00:41:11,974 --> 00:41:13,464
Come here!

453
00:41:13,464 --> 00:41:17,144
Of course, marriage would only be possible after the Marriage Ban ends,

454
00:41:17,144 --> 00:41:19,414
but it is not bad to build relationships

455
00:41:19,414 --> 00:41:22,414
- before you get married, right?
  - Of course!

456
00:41:22,414 --> 00:41:23,254
Yes, that's right.

457
00:41:23,254 --> 00:41:25,314
All right.

458
00:41:25,314 --> 00:41:27,414
Let us do this fairly and go based on age order.

459
00:41:27,414 --> 00:41:28,784
Surround them!

460
00:41:28,784 --> 00:41:30,484
Surround them!

461
00:41:30,484 --> 00:41:32,774
What is this!

462
00:41:34,864 --> 00:41:36,744
These guys!

463
00:41:42,174 --> 00:41:46,684
I found out that the royal morning audience got canceled only after I arrived.

464
00:41:46,684 --> 00:41:49,314
I heard that His Majesty has a pretty bad cold.

465
00:41:49,314 --> 00:41:52,694
Perhaps his wounds from what happened last time were severe...

466
00:41:52,694 --> 00:41:55,824
What I heard was a bit different...

467
00:41:55,824 --> 00:41:57,324
Pardon me?

468
00:41:57,324 --> 00:42:04,274
I heard that His Majesty disappeared last night without anyone noticing.

469
00:42:05,174 --> 00:42:06,344
What do you mean by that?

470
00:42:06,344 --> 00:42:10,874
It could be that His Majesty had to take care of an urgent matter.

471
00:42:10,874 --> 00:42:12,534
There is no need to make a fuss over this.

472
00:42:12,534 --> 00:42:17,354
Especially since there was another suicide incident in the palace,

473
00:42:17,354 --> 00:42:20,374
his heart must have been quite disturbed.

474
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:23,234
T-Then, what should we do?

475
00:42:23,234 --> 00:42:24,664
Then,

476
00:42:24,664 --> 00:42:31,684
we too should prepare for the worst-case scenario.

477
00:42:32,664 --> 00:42:38,444
I have something to tell you all, so let us all go inside.

478
00:42:43,434 --> 00:42:45,154
What do you mean by that?

479
00:42:45,154 --> 00:42:46,954
The king has disappeared?

480
00:42:46,954 --> 00:42:48,614
For what reason!

481
00:42:48,614 --> 00:42:53,094
Recently, His Majesty's heart seems to be turbulent.

482
00:42:55,124 --> 00:42:59,334
That is to be expected since another body was found hanging in the palace.

483
00:42:59,334 --> 00:43:03,104
This time, it was not in the crown princess's palace, but it was in one of the court ladies' quarters.

484
00:43:03,104 --> 00:43:04,254
A court lady?

485
00:43:04,254 --> 00:43:07,574
From the rumors I have heard, that court lady...

486
00:43:09,764 --> 00:43:12,314
Everyone, lower your weapons.

487
00:43:13,134 --> 00:43:14,864
Where are you going?

488
00:43:15,994 --> 00:43:19,174
We have already broken the national law.

489
00:43:19,174 --> 00:43:22,264
Would it be good for us to add to our crimes?

490
00:43:28,104 --> 00:43:30,634
Everyone, lower your weapons.

491
00:43:38,474 --> 00:43:42,624
I have not seen anyone break the law.

492
00:43:44,774 --> 00:43:47,114
Right, Sin Won?

493
00:43:49,624 --> 00:43:53,484
Yes, that is true, Your Majesty.

494
00:44:03,594 --> 00:44:06,144
Whoa, my eyes...

495
00:44:49,794 --> 00:44:55,644
The king's royal chamber staff told us that his majesty could not attend due to a cold,

496
00:44:55,644 --> 00:44:59,300
but that was a lie.

497
00:44:59,324 --> 00:45:01,774
What? A lie?

498
00:45:01,774 --> 00:45:04,534
The king, His Majesty, for an unknown reason

499
00:45:04,534 --> 00:45:07,294
vacated his throne and did not return to the palace,

500
00:45:07,294 --> 00:45:10,954
and turned his back on all of his people.

501
00:45:10,954 --> 00:45:12,704
So, I feel the duty, as a subject of the king,

502
00:45:12,704 --> 00:45:17,234
to prepare for an emergency situation.

503
00:45:18,334 --> 00:45:19,684
Thus,

504
00:45:19,684 --> 00:45:22,974
should we not proclaim

505
00:45:22,974 --> 00:45:28,554
the vacancy of the king's throne?

506
00:45:38,764 --> 00:45:41,194
The first thing we should discuss,

507
00:45:41,194 --> 00:45:44,934
since there is no heir who can rise to the throne,

508
00:45:44,934 --> 00:45:49,374
would be to decide the heir.

509
00:45:49,374 --> 00:45:51,294
You...

510
00:45:51,294 --> 00:45:54,914
I would feel it is too early to come to that decision.

511
00:46:34,784 --> 00:46:36,784
If someone were to hear you,

512
00:46:38,694 --> 00:46:42,714
they might think you were waiting for me to die.

513
00:46:49,844 --> 00:46:52,664
- Ouch!
 - Come on!

514
00:46:54,584 --> 00:46:55,754
Me, too.

515
00:46:55,754 --> 00:46:57,964
You do it for me.

516
00:47:10,374 --> 00:47:13,444
First, if you want to declare a vacancy,

517
00:47:14,124 --> 00:47:18,454
I would have had to disappear and not show up.

518
00:47:18,454 --> 00:47:21,384
But I suppose I lacked the sense

519
00:47:22,884 --> 00:47:25,084
to let you have your way.

520
00:47:25,084 --> 00:47:26,894
So...

521
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:29,434
would you like me to do so now?

522
00:47:31,464 --> 00:47:35,804
Second, I brought together all the ministers who were busy with the affairs of the government,

523
00:47:35,804 --> 00:47:38,094
but I faked being ill with a cold...

524
00:47:38,094 --> 00:47:41,214
So, I have caused things to be bothersome for all of us.

525
00:47:41,214 --> 00:47:42,814
However,

526
00:47:46,254 --> 00:47:49,884
since everyone is gathered here anyway, I have something to tell you all.

527
00:47:49,884 --> 00:47:52,314
Let us think of it as a good thing.

528
00:47:53,214 --> 00:47:57,194
Last night I personally tracked the kidnappers

529
00:47:57,194 --> 00:47:59,174
who were running rampant every night

530
00:48:00,874 --> 00:48:03,874
threatening the safety of homes by kidnapping women.

531
00:48:04,864 --> 00:48:07,304
What I found out there

532
00:48:13,464 --> 00:48:18,274
was that there were so many petitions to me that were not delivered to me.

533
00:48:18,774 --> 00:48:21,984
It appears our subordinates have been negligent in document management—

534
00:48:21,984 --> 00:48:26,174
The police bureau established with a terrifying amount of state money

535
00:48:26,174 --> 00:48:30,174
could not catch even a single kidnapper.

536
00:48:30,174 --> 00:48:31,814
So, Minister of Defense,

537
00:48:32,774 --> 00:48:36,124
how is this the fault of your subordinates?

538
00:48:36,974 --> 00:48:38,834
My apologies, Sire.

539
00:48:38,834 --> 00:48:40,404
From this moment on,

540
00:48:40,404 --> 00:48:43,504
I relieve the police bureau of its authority to investigate the kidnappings

541
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:45,314
and will turn over the investigations

542
00:48:46,104 --> 00:48:48,484
to the Royal Investigation Bureau.

543
00:48:57,274 --> 00:49:01,614
This is a document I personally brought back from the kidnappers' base.

544
00:49:01,614 --> 00:49:05,514
The approximate locations of the headquarters

545
00:49:05,514 --> 00:49:07,834
to which the maidens are being sent are written in this.

546
00:49:07,834 --> 00:49:11,124
I plan to investigate these locations immediately

547
00:49:11,124 --> 00:49:14,364
and set fire to those ant nests.

548
00:49:21,644 --> 00:49:25,194
It might become a fun game of hide and seek.

549
00:49:27,784 --> 00:49:32,054
 Transaction Records

550
00:49:37,294 --> 00:49:39,444
What are you all doing!

551
00:49:41,304 --> 00:49:46,544
Last night, an inner court lady was kidnapped from her private home.

552
00:49:47,324 --> 00:49:51,094
Would that not be due to your incompetence in preventing this?

553
00:49:54,804 --> 00:49:56,424
All of you, pack your belongings.

554
00:49:56,424 --> 00:49:58,524
You are all dismissed.

555
00:50:01,184 --> 00:50:04,654
Lee Sin Won, how dare you!

556
00:50:13,374 --> 00:50:16,974
Was this what you wanted to protect, Your Excellency?

557
00:50:18,264 --> 00:50:19,754
If that was,

558
00:50:20,304 --> 00:50:22,734
it appears you were not able to.

559
00:50:28,374 --> 00:50:32,484
Forgive me for my insolence thus far, Your Majesty.

560
00:50:35,984 --> 00:50:38,914
I am the one who should apologize.

561
00:50:38,914 --> 00:50:43,614
You have been protecting the people I was not able to protect.

562
00:50:44,764 --> 00:50:48,854
Although breaking the national law is not a light matter,

563
00:50:48,854 --> 00:50:52,514
they just want to live loving and caring for each other.

564
00:50:52,514 --> 00:50:55,134
I hope that the national law

565
00:50:55,134 --> 00:50:58,214
would no longer prohibit their loving hearts.

566
00:50:58,214 --> 00:50:59,954
I will not hold a grudge if you arrested me

567
00:50:59,954 --> 00:51:02,224
and have me pay for my crime,

568
00:51:02,224 --> 00:51:04,824
but please do not

569
00:51:04,824 --> 00:51:07,474
punish our Affection Village members.

570
00:51:12,314 --> 00:51:15,084
I think I told you already.

571
00:51:15,084 --> 00:51:18,114
I have not seen anyone commit any crime.

572
00:51:20,324 --> 00:51:22,634
There is nothing wrong with what you said.

573
00:51:22,634 --> 00:51:26,084
Wanting to be with your loved ones is natural.

574
00:51:26,084 --> 00:51:29,344
Would it be right for the government to prohibit such natural behavior?

575
00:51:29,344 --> 00:51:32,444
Since I proclaimed that I would end the  Marriage Ban this year,

576
00:51:32,444 --> 00:51:35,354
I will for sure keep my word.

577
00:51:37,034 --> 00:51:39,304
Let us find you someone!

578
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,374
Even if it is just for you and your Affection Village...

579
00:51:41,374 --> 00:51:44,924
and for all the people in Joseon...

580
00:51:44,924 --> 00:51:47,554
and for your younger sister

581
00:51:47,554 --> 00:51:50,374
who met such a sad end,

582
00:51:56,204 --> 00:51:59,294
I will punish

583
00:51:59,294 --> 00:52:01,444
all of the kidnappers.

584
00:52:19,234 --> 00:52:21,494
Thank you, Miss Shaman,

585
00:52:21,494 --> 00:52:23,134
for letting me meet

586
00:52:23,134 --> 00:52:25,364
my Ran Hui once again.

587
00:52:27,854 --> 00:52:30,224
Oh, it is nothing.

588
00:52:31,024 --> 00:52:33,124
I am sure that the world you are dreaming of

589
00:52:33,124 --> 00:52:35,934
will for sure come, Leader.

590
00:52:35,934 --> 00:52:38,664
A world where you can

591
00:52:38,664 --> 00:52:40,814
love the one you love.

592
00:52:40,814 --> 00:52:43,294
Then, I shall be on my way.

593
00:52:43,294 --> 00:52:45,184
Have a safe journey.

594
00:52:45,924 --> 00:52:47,204
Yes, goodbye!

595
00:52:47,204 --> 00:52:50,174
- Have a safe trip.
 - Do not forget about the blind introduction meeting!

596
00:53:20,194 --> 00:53:25,554
The confiscated document shows where the kidnappers have been active.

597
00:53:25,554 --> 00:53:28,324
Also, to think that you would personally go and capture the kidnappers...

598
00:53:28,324 --> 00:53:32,594
They never left a trace of their presence behind...

599
00:53:32,594 --> 00:53:36,614
Your Majesty, you have accomplished something great.

600
00:53:41,574 --> 00:53:43,264
Your Majesty...

601
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:47,124
I could not fully feel it after just reading this.

602
00:53:51,104 --> 00:53:53,074
 If my younger sister,

603
00:53:53,074 --> 00:53:56,974
 or my wife, or my mother were kidnapped,

604
00:53:57,994 --> 00:54:02,704
 how terribly painful it must've been for my people.

605
00:54:03,744 --> 00:54:07,044
I made a promise to those whom I met on Mount Sinwung.

606
00:54:07,044 --> 00:54:11,704
That I would set up a group blind introduction meeting with court ladies who leave the palace.

607
00:54:11,704 --> 00:54:12,574
Pardon?

608
00:54:12,574 --> 00:54:14,754
But more importantly,

609
00:54:14,754 --> 00:54:19,894
I promised to end the Marriage Ban as soon as possible and allow them to form families,

610
00:54:19,894 --> 00:54:25,074
so that everyone could live happily with love.

611
00:54:25,674 --> 00:54:30,674
I, too should do the same as well.

612
00:54:33,744 --> 00:54:35,154
Are you all right?

613
00:54:35,154 --> 00:54:37,364
Aigoo, what in the world...

614
00:54:37,364 --> 00:54:39,684
To think you were kidnapped!

615
00:54:45,674 --> 00:54:48,474
I am so relieved that you are safe.

616
00:54:49,914 --> 00:54:52,934
This is why I told you you should permanently settle in the palace!

617
00:54:52,934 --> 00:54:54,474
Oh?

618
00:54:54,474 --> 00:54:57,224
- Do you really want that?
 - What?

619
00:54:58,564 --> 00:55:02,574
There is something I dare ask you.

620
00:55:03,244 --> 00:55:04,914
Your Majesty,

621
00:55:04,914 --> 00:55:07,944
as soon as you heard that So Rang got kidnapped,

622
00:55:07,944 --> 00:55:13,990
your eyes burned like Goblin fire and you raced out calling for your sword.

623
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:16,040
 (Goblin fire: fabled blue flames which would make collapse whoever saw them)

624
00:55:16,044 --> 00:55:17,014
Did I?

625
00:55:17,014 --> 00:55:22,264
You know His Majesty was burning with a fever and was not in good condition.

626
00:55:22,264 --> 00:55:24,544
Yes, he is probably still not feeling too well.

627
00:55:24,544 --> 00:55:28,524
But his eyes suddenly burned with fire and said he must go out to your civilian home...

628
00:55:28,524 --> 00:55:30,914
Goodness, we could not dissuade him...

629
00:55:30,914 --> 00:55:32,674
Because of me?

630
00:55:32,674 --> 00:55:36,354
Do you perhaps love that girl?

631
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:38,644
Who? So Rang?

632
00:55:38,644 --> 00:55:41,214
Love? Come on.

633
00:55:43,814 --> 00:55:45,634
So Rang.

634
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:46,654
Yes?

635
00:55:46,654 --> 00:55:48,234
Let us go to the royal clinic first.

636
00:55:48,234 --> 00:55:51,334
Even though you may seem fine now, you may have internal injuries.

637
00:55:51,334 --> 00:55:52,784
You should get assessed.

638
00:55:52,784 --> 00:55:55,794
Oh, no, I am fine.

639
00:55:55,794 --> 00:56:00,774
But that was a lie, right?

640
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:03,824
You channeling the spirit of that man's younger sister.

641
00:56:03,824 --> 00:56:06,424
You were just pretending.

642
00:56:06,424 --> 00:56:08,674
 Come over here.

643
00:56:16,014 --> 00:56:17,594
 Ran Hui

644
00:56:17,594 --> 00:56:19,094
 Kidnapped

645
00:56:19,094 --> 00:56:21,254
 Younger sister?

646
00:56:37,974 --> 00:56:39,924
Oh, that.

647
00:56:41,114 --> 00:56:42,424
Hey,

648
00:56:42,424 --> 00:56:45,604
if I did not do that there, how else would we get out of that situation?

649
00:56:45,604 --> 00:56:48,624
You should not lie anymore.

650
00:56:51,684 --> 00:56:52,864
All right.

651
00:56:52,864 --> 00:56:55,974
Hey, I need to get ready for work.

652
00:56:55,974 --> 00:56:57,844
I will see you later.

653
00:57:04,294 --> 00:57:07,094
 The feeling of love.

654
00:57:07,754 --> 00:57:09,214
What was that again?

655
00:57:09,214 --> 00:57:14,314
First, it is when you want to be alone with her.

656
00:57:14,314 --> 00:57:20,144
It is when even her smallest act makes your heart race like crazy.

657
00:57:20,144 --> 00:57:23,944
My heart is obviously racing because she is always so chaotic.

658
00:57:23,944 --> 00:57:28,144
Your heart keeps fluttering and are concerned about her

659
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:33,814
and you feel she is taking up a vast space in your heart all of a sudden?

660
00:57:33,814 --> 00:57:38,114
You cannot stand her being together with another man, it feels worse than death itself.

661
00:57:38,114 --> 00:57:40,254
This type of emotion.

662
00:57:47,534 --> 00:57:49,284
Come on.

663
00:57:49,284 --> 00:57:51,054
Oh, come on!

664
00:57:51,054 --> 00:57:52,974
No.

665
00:57:54,714 --> 00:57:57,904
Do you want to be together with her for a long time

666
00:57:57,904 --> 00:58:00,724
and share affection with her?

667
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:13,084
Are you still a bit confused?

668
00:58:16,674 --> 00:58:18,954
A feeling of love...

669
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:20,734
Is it not like that?

670
00:58:20,734 --> 00:58:24,114
 Like a heavy anchor in the corner of your heart,

671
00:58:24,114 --> 00:58:28,334
 it hurts, and aches,

672
00:58:28,334 --> 00:58:31,884
and yet cannot shake it off of you.

673
00:58:35,464 --> 00:58:38,734
But So Rang, she is just so hectic

674
00:58:38,734 --> 00:58:40,424
and noisy even when she's quiet. And...

675
00:58:40,424 --> 00:58:43,274
when I am listening to her, it feels like I am being deceived.

676
00:58:43,274 --> 00:58:46,304
How can you say that this is a feeling of love?

677
00:58:46,304 --> 00:58:48,804
But aren't you still concerned about her?

678
00:58:48,804 --> 00:58:50,264
I am concerned and bothered by her

679
00:58:50,264 --> 00:58:53,384
because I worry about how she is going to end up.

680
00:58:58,344 --> 00:59:03,104
Your Majesty, the great queen dowager is looking for you.

681
00:59:03,784 --> 00:59:08,814
Tell her that I have returned safe and sound without any issues.

682
00:59:08,814 --> 00:59:10,934
But still...

683
00:59:11,804 --> 00:59:15,724
I will tell her that Your Majesty has already entered the bathtub.

684
00:59:17,274 --> 00:59:20,204
We have already prepared warm water for you there.

685
00:59:20,204 --> 00:59:23,824
You must be exhausted, so you should rest.

686
00:59:25,154 --> 00:59:27,064
I will do so.

687
00:59:30,664 --> 00:59:34,384
Supposedly, the reason the king left the palace

688
00:59:34,384 --> 00:59:37,864
was merely for someone like you, I hear.

689
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:22,154
You do not have a shift today.

690
01:00:22,154 --> 01:00:24,654
You should rest more.

691
01:00:25,364 --> 01:00:29,074
I need to see his majesty about something.

692
01:00:33,754 --> 01:00:35,154
 Your Majesty.

693
01:00:35,154 --> 01:00:38,904
 I brought a towel for you to use to dry your body.

694
01:00:50,944 --> 01:00:52,874
All right.

695
01:00:52,874 --> 01:00:54,654
Did you see the physician?

696
01:00:54,654 --> 01:00:56,904
And you are not in any pain?

697
01:00:57,824 --> 01:01:00,994
Why did you already come in to work?

698
01:01:00,994 --> 01:01:03,464
I am fine.

699
01:01:03,464 --> 01:01:05,154
Well,

700
01:01:06,414 --> 01:01:09,824
I also had something to tell you, anyway.

701
01:01:27,154 --> 01:01:28,854
Your Majesty.

702
01:01:32,024 --> 01:01:34,074
Thank you.

703
01:01:35,154 --> 01:01:40,104
Did you not leave the palace to rescue me?

704
01:01:41,254 --> 01:01:45,104
I really wanted to say this to you.

705
01:01:47,214 --> 01:01:49,764
I should be the one to thank you.

706
01:01:49,764 --> 01:01:53,294
I was able to realize a lot of things at Affection Village.

707
01:01:53,294 --> 01:01:57,274
I should have made Joseon like that sooner.

708
01:01:57,274 --> 01:02:01,834
A place where all the people care for, love each other, and are happy.

709
01:02:01,834 --> 01:02:04,454
I have captured all of the kidnappers who harmed you

710
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:06,964
and reorganized the investigation unit.

711
01:02:06,964 --> 01:02:11,300
That was all thanks to you.

712
01:02:13,404 --> 01:02:15,584
Oh, no, I did nothing.

713
01:02:26,374 --> 01:02:29,594
Oh, I will wipe off your sweat a bit.

714
01:02:29,594 --> 01:02:32,024
Oh, no, I am fine.

715
01:02:34,774 --> 01:02:38,274
Oh, I will bring the other court ladies to come and wait on you.

716
01:02:38,274 --> 01:02:42,214
No, no, I am fine. I do not need that.

717
01:02:47,914 --> 01:02:52,694
 First, it is when you want to be alone with her.

718
01:03:06,904 --> 01:03:12,264
 It is when even her smallest act makes your heart race like crazy.

719
01:03:41,114 --> 01:03:42,814
Your Majesty.

720
01:03:43,524 --> 01:03:46,294
There is a flower petal on your face...

721
01:03:46,294 --> 01:03:48,054
A flower petal?

722
01:03:52,504 --> 01:03:54,674
Oh, not there.

723
01:03:54,674 --> 01:03:57,774
On that side...

724
01:03:59,554 --> 01:04:01,524
No...

725
01:04:01,524 --> 01:04:03,314
I will do it...

726
01:04:15,144 --> 01:04:21,144
 Your heart keeps fluttering and are concerned about her

727
01:04:22,664 --> 01:04:28,244
 and you feel she is taking up a vast space in your heart all of a sudden?

728
01:04:54,234 --> 01:04:59,940
♫  Our own story  ♫

729
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:06,730
♫  which no one knew  ♫

730
01:05:08,884 --> 01:05:11,510

731

733
01:05:20,514 --> 01:05:22,450
So Rang.

734
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:27,284
It is a relief that you are safe.

735
01:05:29,214 --> 01:05:31,094
Your Majesty.

736
01:05:33,364 --> 01:05:35,764
I can see through your clothes.

737
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:43,640

738
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:56,434
♫  Do you know  ♫

739

♫  Even if I say "I love you"   ♫

01:06:00,610 --> 01:06:05,834
♫  I cannot fully express my feelings  ♫

741
01:06:05,834 --> 01:06:13,834
♫  Please listen to my small confession  ♫

01:06:13,854 --> 01:06:20,704
♫  which will continue endlessly  ♫

 The Forbidden Marriage 
 ♫  will you even know it?  ♫

746
01:06:28,444 --> 01:06:31,594
 I do not want it if your feelings are not sincere.

747
01:06:31,594 --> 01:06:35,554
 The way I get this feeling where my chest feels tight whenever she disappears...

748
01:06:35,554 --> 01:06:38,674
 I feel that it is really the feeling of love.

749
01:06:38,674 --> 01:06:41,544
 What do you think is the reason she is still alive?

750
01:06:41,544 --> 01:06:44,764
 We will need to eliminate that guy Lee Sin Won first.

751
01:06:44,764 --> 01:06:46,734
 These are the names of the court ladies who will be leaving the palace.

752
01:06:46,734 --> 01:06:49,074
 Why is So Rang's name listed here?

753
01:06:49,074 --> 01:06:52,794
 I don't want to be a substitute for a dead person, either.

754
01:06:52,794 --> 01:06:55,944
 There is no way for me to know what your true feelings are, either.

755
01:06:55,944 --> 01:06:57,574
 Do not leave me.

756
01:06:57,574 --> 01:06:59,264
 That is how I truly feel.

757
01:06:59,264 --> 01:07:03,300
♫  will it just be a passing dream?  ♫
