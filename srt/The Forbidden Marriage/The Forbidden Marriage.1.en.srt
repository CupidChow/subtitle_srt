00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:39,877
<i>In the infinitely unknown universe there is an Earth-like planet.</i>

2
00:00:39,877 --> 00:00:43,497
<i>On that planet, there is a country called Joseon.</i>

3
00:00:43,497 --> 00:00:49,480
<i>If you think that it is strangely familiar, that is your delusion.</i>

4
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,177
<i>Coincidentally, two females sharing the same fate were born on the same day and time.</i>

5
00:00:53,177 --> 00:01:00,187
<i>This story starts also by coincidence when their life and death fates diverted.</i>

6
00:01:00,187 --> 00:01:03,987
<i>I say this again, but this story is fiction.</i>

7
00:01:03,987 --> 00:01:08,517
<i>Edict Banning Marriage for any female age 13 to 18 <i>What does this even say...</i></i>

8
00:01:08,517 --> 00:01:12,487
What does it say? Shouldn't someone explain?

9
00:01:12,487 --> 00:01:15,057
It seems an edict forbidding marriage has been issued.

10
00:01:15,057 --> 00:01:17,697
It hasn't been too long since the crown princess died.

11
00:01:17,697 --> 00:01:19,127
Why are they already selecting a new bride for the royal family?

12
00:01:19,127 --> 00:01:20,627
It says everyone's marriage is forbidden.

13
00:01:20,627 --> 00:01:23,707
Forbidden marriage? What does that mean?

14
00:01:23,707 --> 00:01:25,630
What that means is this!

15
00:01:28,084 --> 00:01:30,437
The marriage ban

16
00:01:30,437 --> 00:01:34,677
is a policy that is put into action while the royal family searches for a new queen or crown princess.

17
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:37,767
Simply said, the royals consider themselves a priority,

18
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:41,497
so they prohibit marriage for all females who are of age.

19
00:01:41,497 --> 00:01:43,027
That is what it means.

20
00:01:43,027 --> 00:01:45,337
What is this? Does that mean I cannot meet my future wife?

21
00:01:45,337 --> 00:01:47,477
If I am not married, I cannot meet a husband?

22
00:01:47,477 --> 00:01:50,627
But look at the time we live in!

23
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:53,637
A male and female cannot be in the same place if they're older than seven.

24
00:01:56,147 --> 00:02:01,517
A man and a woman cannot meet and share affection freely.

25
00:02:13,094 --> 00:02:17,177
Until marriage, they cannot even touch each other's hands.

26
00:02:17,177 --> 00:02:19,407
And they dare forbid marriage for us?

27
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:22,617
They are too much!

28
00:02:22,617 --> 00:02:26,877
Old man, what do you think about me learning how to determine marital compatibility?

29
00:02:26,877 --> 00:02:29,387
Come on now, don't you know the meaning of the marriage ban?

30
00:02:29,387 --> 00:02:33,847
People needing to be married come to me with a bundle of money to determine their external and internal compatibility.

31
00:02:33,847 --> 00:02:36,287
Now all the compatibility readers will starve to death!

32
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:40,297
You're someone who knows one thing but you don't know something else.

33
00:02:40,297 --> 00:02:43,917
Even if the country prohibits marriage officially,

34
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:46,547
do you really think men and women can be stopped from forming relationships?

35
00:02:46,547 --> 00:02:47,487
What?

36
00:02:47,487 --> 00:02:48,877
Just wait and see.

37
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:52,937
The longer they prohibit it, the more the fervor for love will boil over.

38
00:02:52,937 --> 00:02:56,817
If you and I are in the middle of a relationship between people

39
00:02:56,817 --> 00:02:59,027
there will definitely be a clever way for us to make a living.

40
00:02:59,027 --> 00:03:01,987
Aigoo, I certainly do not have the guts for swindling.

41
00:03:01,987 --> 00:03:03,347
Leave me out of this!

42
00:03:03,347 --> 00:03:04,947
Wait, how is this swindling?

43
00:03:04,947 --> 00:03:07,067
It is natural for man and woman to pair up and live together.

44
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:09,789
The country that prohibits that is crazy!

45
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,679
Come now.

46
00:03:30,747 --> 00:03:36,677
If you must label me, call me a messenger of love for young lovers.

Drugging the king's tea is a crime whose gravity is immeasurable.

We have served his majesty for so many years.

Even if I get my tongue pulled out for treason and get castrated, I must do what must be done.

With her skills, we will surely succeed in our mission to have his majesty sleep with her.

120
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:03,047
With this remedy, even an old man on the verge of becoming a corpse could father a late child. <i>(Biageora: Ability to stand up, unlike oneself, to accomplish the job)</i>

Her name is Cho Ran. She is filling in for Sun Ah, who is ill.

00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:09,957
due to the marriage ban that has been going on for the last seven years.

161
00:15:12,907 --> 00:15:17,897
When the marriage ban is over, do you believe you, too, will be able to marry?

162
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:23,547
You are also still searching for her.

163
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,817
That woman who disappeared.

164
00:15:30,527 --> 00:15:35,967
That is why the only one who can understand me is you.

165
00:15:37,697 --> 00:15:39,490
Sin Won,

166
00:15:40,217 --> 00:15:47,677
even if the people all point their fingers at me, I hope you remain by my side to the end.

167
00:15:50,337 --> 00:15:53,187
I will abide by your orders, Sire.

168
00:16:00,747 --> 00:16:04,047
Whoa, I have finally returned to this place.

169
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,867
Aigoo, you like coming back here looking like this?

170
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:08,357
What is there not to like?

171
00:16:08,357 --> 00:16:12,307
We have all this seed money to start!

172

Let us go, go.*

Come and get some!

176
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:37,957
How do I look?

177
00:16:37,957 --> 00:16:40,147
- Aigoo! Can't do that!
- Hello?

178
00:16:40,147 --> 00:16:41,927
Aigoo, how can you do that?

179
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:44,707
Is anyone here?

180
00:16:44,707 --> 00:16:46,097
Yes, yes.
<i>(Realtor)</i>

181
00:16:46,097 --> 00:16:49,197
I am looking to set up a store in Insagol.

182
00:16:49,197 --> 00:16:50,597
Yes!

183
00:16:53,147 --> 00:16:55,137
What kind of store are you looking for?

184
00:16:55,137 --> 00:16:56,667
Well, let me see...

185
00:16:56,667 --> 00:17:00,497
I am thinking of setting up a tea house in a peaceful spot.

186
00:17:00,497 --> 00:17:02,227
A tea house?

187
00:17:02,227 --> 00:17:04,897
There are several places nearby for a tea house.

188
00:17:04,897 --> 00:17:06,147
- Let us go.
- Yes, let us.

189
00:17:06,147 --> 00:17:07,147
All right.

190
00:17:07,147 --> 00:17:09,897
All right, come this way.

191
00:17:09,897 --> 00:17:14,667
<i>Urgent Sale: Tearfully Going Out of Business</i>
This place is near the capital, so there's a lot of foot traffic.

Hey, hey... wait...

193
00:17:17,147 --> 00:17:18,217

Well, no.

Oh, shoot.

212
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,117
So, there are already rumors about yesterday?

213
00:18:58,117 --> 00:19:01,527
Unexpectedly, Biageora is all sold out.

214
00:19:01,527 --> 00:19:04,087
My goodness. On top of that!

215
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:05,217
On top of that, what?

216
00:19:05,217 --> 00:19:08,757
The ghost of the Crown Princess, who met an unjust death, appears in the palace,

217
00:19:08,757 --> 00:19:11,367
and it has blocked the marriage fortune for all the youths in our country.

218
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:13,637
There is such a rumor going around.

219
00:19:13,637 --> 00:19:16,307
You know, I heard the king has been hallucinating and all.

220
00:19:16,307 --> 00:19:19,017
Come on, what ghost?

221
00:19:19,017 --> 00:19:23,297
His Majesty...just can't forget.

222
00:19:23,297 --> 00:19:25,197
Like you, sir?

223
00:19:26,347 --> 00:19:28,967
Yes. Like me.

224
00:19:40,687 --> 00:19:47,477
So... you just let go of that woman who visited you last night?

225
00:19:48,117 --> 00:19:49,827
How would I know who sent her to me?

226
00:19:49,827 --> 00:19:52,727
Is that what is important?

227
00:19:52,727 --> 00:19:56,107
From what I hear, ambassadors from Arabia have secretly brought in

228
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:59,057
certain drugs into your palace, Queen Mother.

229
00:19:59,057 --> 00:20:02,017
Shall I start investigating that first?

230
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:07,757
So, how far were you able to go?

231
00:20:07,757 --> 00:20:09,327
Grandmother!

232
00:20:09,327 --> 00:20:12,887
Dear, I am just worried!

233
00:20:12,887 --> 00:20:16,427
I just wonder how your overall health is.

234
00:20:16,427 --> 00:20:19,277
I am also worried that the street rumors may turn out to be true.

235
00:20:19,277 --> 00:20:20,877
What rumors?

236
00:20:20,877 --> 00:20:22,597
Aigoo...

237
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,127
Never mind.

238
00:20:25,127 --> 00:20:30,557
The Gyotaejeon, the queen's quarters, should be occupied so I don't have to be plagued with doubts.

239
00:20:31,227 --> 00:20:37,727
If we fill that place recklessly, you are well aware of what may happen.

240
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:43,107
Your Majesty, the long-standing marriage ban has resulted in a serious decline in the birth rate.

241
00:20:43,107 --> 00:20:48,717
Instead of setting up a starter home for newlyweds, how can we forbid marriage?

242
00:20:48,717 --> 00:20:53,317
In a nation where no babies are born, how can speak of our future?

243
00:20:53,317 --> 00:20:58,207
Please hasten and begin the queen selection process.

244
00:20:59,087 --> 00:21:01,027
According to the rumor going around,

245
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:03,967
you may be a tyrant who has gone mad

246
00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:07,297
or someone who craves men

247
00:21:13,277 --> 00:21:16,207
or a eunuch who cannot function as a man.

248
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:20,977
Is it not a relief, though?

249
00:21:20,977 --> 00:21:24,497
None of them actually apply to Your Majesty.

250
00:21:24,497 --> 00:21:29,507
And isn't it you who views me in such a manner, Minister of Defense?

251
00:21:29,507 --> 00:21:34,937
I am simply relaying the gossip among the people who gather every night to chat.

252
00:21:34,937 --> 00:21:40,917
So, if you abolish the marriage prohibition, it will put everyone at ease.

253
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:44,267
Was this ever something attached to me?

254
00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:48,797
Why? You are attached* to it, are you not?
<i>(Alluding to his testicles)</i>

255
00:21:52,497 --> 00:21:53,667
Minister!

256
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:57,247
Young people are busy preparing for exams and looking for employment these days

257
00:21:57,247 --> 00:22:00,507
so much that they claim they can't afford marriage or children.

258
00:22:00,507 --> 00:22:06,197
The way I see it, whether we lift the edict or not, the situation will not change very much.

259
00:22:06,197 --> 00:22:11,347
Why do you take for granted that you have the right to take away people's rights?

260
00:22:11,347 --> 00:22:13,777
Everyone, please listen.

261
00:22:13,777 --> 00:22:18,527
As this Marriage Ban Edict should not stay in place too much longer,

262
00:22:18,527 --> 00:22:25,357
I will make sure to select a queen by the end of the year and put an end to the ban.

263
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:32,277
It is already the third queen selection in the past seven years.

264
00:22:32,277 --> 00:22:36,117
Did you not cancel all the previous selections, unfortunately?

265
00:22:36,117 --> 00:22:38,657
But that will not happen again this time.

266
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:42,447
How can you guarantee anything in life?

267
00:22:42,447 --> 00:22:46,547
You speak as if this upcoming selection process is bound to fail as well.

268
00:22:46,547 --> 00:22:47,940
Of course not, Your Majesty.

269
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:53,610
It all stems from my dedication to your security.

270
00:22:58,897 --> 00:23:00,917
My security, you say...

271
00:23:02,107 --> 00:23:04,837
My security...

272
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:09,987
Your Majesty.

273
00:23:11,107 --> 00:23:13,247
Where are you headed, Sire?

274
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:22,637
Regarding my security, should I not be the one to rise above the threat?

275
00:23:22,637 --> 00:23:25,057
I will head to my late wife's dwelling place.

276
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:28,357
Your Majesty!

277
00:24:09,707 --> 00:24:12,757
What is all this?

278
00:24:12,757 --> 00:24:14,847
Please follow me.

279
00:24:27,027 --> 00:24:28,647
Heon-i.

280
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:34,447
Oh, just...

281
00:24:34,447 --> 00:24:37,397
Please call me that just once.

282
00:24:37,397 --> 00:24:40,107
Yi Heon. Heon...

283
00:24:40,107 --> 00:24:44,007
Heon-i. Heon-i. Heon-i. Heon-i. Heon-i!

284
00:24:50,787 --> 00:24:55,577
How can I speak your name so casually, Your Highness?

285
00:24:55,577 --> 00:25:01,227
Crown Princess, how is it that you do not fully open up to me?

286
00:25:01,227 --> 00:25:06,007
How can I relax when showing my dedication toward you?

287
00:25:06,697 --> 00:25:10,697
Dedication? No, I don't really like dedication. I want to be adored.

288
00:25:10,697 --> 00:25:15,397
While you're at it, love and affection given to your husband. How about that?

289
00:25:27,677 --> 00:25:30,007
Surprise!

290
00:25:30,007 --> 00:25:32,627
I brought some sweet alcohol tonight.

291
00:25:32,627 --> 00:25:36,097
That way, our relationship can also become sweeter.

292
00:25:45,047 --> 00:25:47,537
I am both thankful and sorry

293
00:25:47,537 --> 00:25:52,117
that you always cherish me so.

294
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:57,017
It's because you are lovable,

295
00:25:57,017 --> 00:25:59,410
that you are receiving such love.

296
00:26:00,147 --> 00:26:02,717
Even such beautiful feelings

297
00:26:02,717 --> 00:26:05,017
can cause misunderstandings among the public.

298
00:26:05,017 --> 00:26:08,067
For a husband to love his own wife?

299
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,267
Because, Your Highness...

300
00:26:12,267 --> 00:26:16,847
you must not show any type of weakness.

301
00:26:21,387 --> 00:26:24,237
There is no windstorm.

302
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:30,517
The ocean does not become stagnant because of the wind and waves.

303
00:26:30,517 --> 00:26:32,487
Underneath the calm facade of these waters,

304
00:26:32,487 --> 00:26:37,190
I am saying it may be stagnant.

305
00:26:38,007 --> 00:26:40,177
If the power stays in one place too long, it too becomes corrupt.

306
00:26:40,177 --> 00:26:42,987
That is why a windstorm is needed to turn the tide.

307
00:26:42,987 --> 00:26:47,157
A windstorm that will change this nation may be necessary,

308
00:26:47,157 --> 00:26:52,457
but those without a tether could end up being carried away by the waters.

309
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:56,397
So, there is no tether for you, Crown Princess?

310
00:26:57,197 --> 00:27:01,017
How about I become that tether? I will be that tether for you.

311
00:27:01,017 --> 00:27:06,557
Your Highness, you must separate love from affairs of state.

312
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:28,077
If I get caught in the storm that blows through the palace,

313
00:27:28,077 --> 00:27:30,457
and even though I drift apart from you,

314
00:27:30,457 --> 00:27:35,047
please do not worry and take care of yourself, Your Highness.

315
00:27:35,047 --> 00:27:39,487
Why would we... drift apart?

316
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:44,117
Then promise me this.

317
00:27:44,117 --> 00:27:48,337
That you will take care of yourself, Crown Princess.

318
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:16,807
Are you saying you cannot promise me this?

319
00:28:45,217 --> 00:28:49,797
Please... take good care of yourself, Your Highness.

320
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:13,457
- No, Your Highness!
- Move...

321
00:29:13,457 --> 00:29:16,457
- Your Highness, no.
- Move!

322
00:29:17,437 --> 00:29:20,277
I am her husband.

323
00:29:20,277 --> 00:29:23,207
- Move out of my way.
- To see the corpse of a criminal who committed suicide,

324
00:29:23,207 --> 00:29:26,007
will bring bad fortune upon yourself, Your Royal Highness.

325
00:29:26,007 --> 00:29:28,267
How dare you call her a criminal...

326
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,637
What do you mean by suicide?

327
00:29:30,637 --> 00:29:32,747
For certain,

328
00:29:35,527 --> 00:29:38,817
this is murder by strangulation. It's murder!

329
00:29:38,817 --> 00:29:41,497
This is murder!

330
00:29:41,497 --> 00:29:44,407
Your Highness...

331
00:29:46,717 --> 00:29:48,777
Your Highness...

332
00:29:48,777 --> 00:29:50,467
Let go of me!

333
00:29:50,467 --> 00:29:53,167
Who dares to kill the Crown Princess?

334
00:29:54,197 --> 00:29:55,967
Who dares...

335
00:29:57,329 --> 00:30:01,417
Crown Princess, why are you lying here like this...

336
00:30:01,417 --> 00:30:05,547
Please, open your eyes... Oh, no...

337
00:30:07,657 --> 00:30:11,927
Look! Call the royal physician right away!

338
00:30:11,927 --> 00:30:16,327
Why are you lying here like this... Oh, no, Ja Yeon...

339
00:30:16,327 --> 00:30:20,837
Ja Yeon, please open your eyes, I beg you... Oh, no...

340
00:30:23,157 --> 00:30:25,387
Your Highness.

341
00:30:25,387 --> 00:30:27,797
Your Majesty! Please, don't be like this.

342
00:30:27,797 --> 00:30:30,887
- Please go back, Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

343
00:30:30,887 --> 00:30:33,177
I need to rise above everything.

344
00:30:33,177 --> 00:30:35,447
Those who don't know what happened could say so.

345
00:30:35,447 --> 00:30:37,097
However, not us.

346
00:30:37,097 --> 00:30:39,047
Please do not enter, Your Majesty!

347
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:40,877
Move out of the way.

348
00:30:40,877 --> 00:30:44,217
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

349
00:31:30,017 --> 00:31:31,927
Crown Princess?

350
00:31:40,927 --> 00:31:43,587
Please come here, Crown Princess.

351
00:31:52,937 --> 00:31:54,417
It was suicide for sure, I'm telling you.

352
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:56,317
She took that fatal step because of her inability to adjust to palace life.

353
00:31:56,317 --> 00:31:59,897
Such a disloyal crown princess who left you behind must never be forgiven.

354
00:31:59,897 --> 00:32:03,487
Who says that? Who says this was a suicide?

355
00:32:03,487 --> 00:32:05,937
Who dares to say that?

356
00:32:22,487 --> 00:32:24,947
Crown... Crown Princess...

357
00:32:24,947 --> 00:32:29,037
Crown Princess? Crown Princess?

358
00:32:29,037 --> 00:32:32,437
Crown Princess, weren't you just here?

359
00:32:33,547 --> 00:32:38,587
Crown Princess! I am over here!

360
00:32:38,587 --> 00:32:41,587
I swear you were here just now!

361
00:32:44,137 --> 00:32:45,547
Ja Yeon...

362
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,647
Your Majesty.

363
00:32:47,647 --> 00:32:49,697
Yes, Sin Won, there you are.

364
00:32:49,697 --> 00:32:53,797
The crown princess. She was just here. Didn't you see her?

365
00:33:10,377 --> 00:33:14,027
She was really just here a moment ago.

366
00:33:23,517 --> 00:33:28,317
Your Majesty. You promised to take a new queen this year

367
00:33:28,317 --> 00:33:31,197
and end the marriage ban.

368
00:33:32,945 --> 00:33:36,367
If you keep hallucinating about the deceased crown princess,

369
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:39,497
how will you be able to accept a new queen?

370
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:45,447
You must forget her.

371
00:33:45,447 --> 00:33:49,557
Will that... be possible in this lifetime?

372
00:33:49,557 --> 00:33:53,807
It's a lost cause in this lifetime.

373
00:33:57,169 --> 00:34:00,777
Even if you gift all sorts of valuables and treasures,

374
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:03,217
will that be enough to capture a woman's heart?

375
00:34:03,217 --> 00:34:08,160
Instead of that, why not come inside and chat over some tea?

376
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:12,677
I will give you the best advice on how to win over a woman's heart!

377
00:34:12,677 --> 00:34:14,287
I do not love any woman.

378
00:34:14,287 --> 00:34:17,807
How dare you try to swindle us by lying?

379
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:20,607
But that... Surely, you did not buy that for your mother?

380
00:34:20,607 --> 00:34:23,507
- This is nonsense.
- Looks like a quack to me.

381
00:34:23,507 --> 00:34:26,377
- More like a swindler.
- But—

382
00:34:26,377 --> 00:34:31,907
Come now. No matter how hard you try, you cannot find a woman to love.

383
00:34:31,907 --> 00:34:33,607
How can it be explained by words alone?

384
00:34:33,607 --> 00:34:35,987
Even after we pass the current situation of the marriage ban.

385
00:34:35,987 --> 00:34:40,997
No, you will not be allowed to marry even after a hundred or a thousand years.

386
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:45,397
You don't even know how painful that is...

387
00:34:45,397 --> 00:34:47,317
Is he in your category, old man?

388
00:34:47,317 --> 00:34:50,427
Stop deceiving yourselves,

389
00:34:50,427 --> 00:34:54,177
and start accepting and loving yourself.

390
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:57,237
Loving yourself is the most important thing in the world.

391
00:34:57,237 --> 00:34:59,007
Yes, of course.

392
00:34:59,887 --> 00:35:01,817
Thank you, old man.

393
00:35:03,087 --> 00:35:06,547
- Hey, take me with you!
- What's going on?

394
00:35:06,547 --> 00:35:08,257
I guess that old man is for real.

395
00:35:08,257 --> 00:35:11,107
As expected! As expected of Sir Gwaeng Yi.

396
00:35:11,107 --> 00:35:14,137
He's called Sir Gok Gwaeng Yi* because he's able
<i>(= "pickaxe")</i>

397
00:35:14,137 --> 00:35:15,907
to dig into people's hearts with his spiritual channeling.

398
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:19,067
Here, here. If you have anything you want to know about your love life,

399
00:35:19,067 --> 00:35:20,617
please come to Aedaldang.

400
00:35:20,617 --> 00:35:22,717
Please come!

401
00:35:22,717 --> 00:35:25,537
<i>Aedaldang</i>

402
00:35:25,537 --> 00:35:27,267
You!

403
00:35:27,267 --> 00:35:32,907
Hey! I told you not to make up nonsense with your non-existent channeling ability!

404
00:35:32,907 --> 00:35:36,907
My keen eye is more accurate than your on-and-off channeling ability.

405
00:35:36,907 --> 00:35:38,237
So why are you suddenly making a fuss about this?

406
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:40,207
We're now in the capital city!

407
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:41,977
We're no longer wandering about!

408
00:35:41,977 --> 00:35:44,417
And I told you that we should not do business in the daytime.

409
00:35:44,417 --> 00:35:46,917
Are you trying to get me arrested by doing business and promoting like that?

410
00:35:46,917 --> 00:35:50,037
You're making my heart beat so fast that I'm going to lose my mind!

411
00:35:50,037 --> 00:35:53,207
Whom are you trying to blame for you becoming senile?

412
00:35:53,207 --> 00:35:57,047
But hey, it's a bit of a shame to hear

413
00:35:57,047 --> 00:35:59,527
that the handsome young master was on "that side".

414
00:35:59,527 --> 00:36:03,737
I once was as handsome as he was.

415
00:36:03,737 --> 00:36:05,537
- Right, let me try slapping you in the face. Come here.
- How dare you!

416
00:36:05,537 --> 00:36:08,347
- Come here-
- How dare you!

417
00:36:08,347 --> 00:36:14,097
Well... So... Is this Aedaldang, by any chance?

418
00:36:14,987 --> 00:36:17,877
I heard you were looking for an employee.

419
00:36:25,337 --> 00:36:26,967
Your name is Hae Yeong.

420
00:36:26,967 --> 00:36:28,777
You used to work in a rice soup restaurant,

421
00:36:28,777 --> 00:36:30,497
and you stopped working for a while.

422
00:36:30,497 --> 00:36:35,637
Oh, finding a job these days is really difficult these days.

423
00:36:35,637 --> 00:36:40,177
<i>My Scholar from the Star</i>
Ten years ago, you fell in love with raunchy romance novels and became a master.

424
00:36:40,177 --> 00:36:41,810
No!

425
00:36:42,707 --> 00:36:43,597
Let me see.

426
00:36:43,597 --> 00:36:46,237
Oh, "My Scholar from the Star,"

427
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:48,017
"The Heirs of Arabia,"

428
00:36:48,017 --> 00:36:49,857
and "Concubines of the Sun"?

429
00:36:49,857 --> 00:36:52,247
Oh, let me explain...

430
00:36:58,467 --> 00:37:02,237
I give you this lanyard to show you've been hired.

431
00:37:02,237 --> 00:37:03,447
Excuse me?

432
00:37:03,447 --> 00:37:06,367
As a permanent employee, of course.

433
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:08,837
All right!

434
00:37:08,837 --> 00:37:11,957
Thank you! I'll work really hard, I promise!

435
00:37:13,387 --> 00:37:15,547
<i>Hae Yeong is accepted into Aedaldang!</i>

436
00:37:19,357 --> 00:37:20,957
All right.

437
00:37:22,557 --> 00:37:24,617
<i>Aedaldang</i>

438
00:37:28,067 --> 00:37:32,090
<i>A risky hub for relationships during a time when marriages are forbidden.</i>

439
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:36,090
<i>We really needed someone who's experienced in that field.</i>

440
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:40,287
If you hold onto this well,

441
00:37:40,287 --> 00:37:43,467
you will find a man who will bring you 30 years of great fortune.

442
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:44,717
Really?

443
00:37:44,717 --> 00:37:46,457
Thank you! Thank you!

444
00:37:46,457 --> 00:37:48,027
All right, next.

445
00:37:48,027 --> 00:37:50,167
How's the taste of the tea?

446
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:52,937
So, are you going to do a compatibility assessment?

447
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:07,097
I heard that young ladies are disappearing every night these days

448
00:38:07,097 --> 00:38:09,650
and only come back in the early morning.

449
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:13,667
Where do you think they're going to, at such a late hour?

450
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:16,707
- Is it perhaps-
- Is it true?

451
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,200
What the people say about me nightly when they gather...

452
00:38:25,564 --> 00:38:28,897
That you are a mad tyrant?

453
00:38:28,897 --> 00:38:30,597
No, not that one.

454
00:38:30,597 --> 00:38:33,427
Oh, that you are either castrated or you prefer m—

455
00:38:38,757 --> 00:38:43,127
I must go personally and check to see if what I have heard is true.

456
00:38:43,127 --> 00:38:45,907
P-Personally check...

457
00:38:46,997 --> 00:38:48,827
Welcome to Aedaldang.

458
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:49,767
Welcome!

459
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:51,027
I heard you are really good at fortune-telling here.

460
00:38:51,027 --> 00:38:53,967
Yes, that's right! How did you know?

461
00:38:56,687 --> 00:38:58,347
Aedaldang?

462
00:38:58,347 --> 00:39:00,327
Welcome! Welcome.

463
00:39:00,327 --> 00:39:01,697
It's a bit suspicious.

464
00:39:01,697 --> 00:39:03,407
It's a bit suspicious.

465
00:39:06,247 --> 00:39:07,677
It is.

466
00:39:10,477 --> 00:39:13,117
You did the right thing by coming here.

467
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:18,417
All right. Once I draw one more line
on this identification tablet...

468
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:20,247
<i>24 years old</i>

469
00:39:25,117 --> 00:39:27,167
<i>(Draws an extra line, turning the two into a three)</i>

470
00:39:29,097 --> 00:39:31,387
<i>34 years old</i>

471
00:39:33,557 --> 00:39:36,797
Look. We turn someone in her twenties
into someone in her thirties.

472
00:39:36,797 --> 00:39:38,337
What happens if you're ten years older?

473
00:39:38,337 --> 00:39:40,407
Since you would be older than 25,

474
00:39:40,407 --> 00:39:45,417
you will no longer be forbidden from marriage but be able to marry happily!

475
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:47,987
But if I say I'm 34,

476
00:39:47,987 --> 00:39:50,357
will they believe me?

477
00:39:50,357 --> 00:39:51,637
Of course!

478
00:39:51,637 --> 00:39:55,627
Just say you look young for your age.

479
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:58,797
I feel like we're at the scene of a marriage fraud.

480
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:03,517
Why is this darn marriage ban edict lasting so long?

481
00:40:03,517 --> 00:40:04,817
Well, well.

482
00:40:04,817 --> 00:40:06,407
You still don't know the reason?

483
00:40:06,407 --> 00:40:11,737
They say that the king of this nation is either castrated or prefers the love of men.

484
00:40:11,737 --> 00:40:13,897
Which of the two is he, exactly?

485
00:40:13,897 --> 00:40:16,887
From what I can see,

486
00:40:16,887 --> 00:40:17,877
I think he's castrated.

487
00:40:17,877 --> 00:40:19,657
If he had even some of the working parts,

488
00:40:19,657 --> 00:40:22,667
do you think the marriage ban would have lasted seven years?

489
00:40:23,357 --> 00:40:25,147
Let go of me.

490
00:40:25,147 --> 00:40:26,257
So, how could I...

491
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,727
Do I need to show her? Should I pull down my pants

492
00:40:28,727 --> 00:40:31,067
and show her? Do I show her?

493
00:40:32,917 --> 00:40:36,007
If I write a love letter for you, it will be two nyang,

494
00:40:36,007 --> 00:40:38,537
including express delivery.

495
00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:39,997
I'll do that!

496
00:40:39,997 --> 00:40:42,157
What if you get caught doing that?

497
00:40:42,157 --> 00:40:44,577
I heard that they are cracking down on even love letters.

498
00:40:44,577 --> 00:40:48,067
Do you know how many couples I have brought together, going from one corner of Joseon to the other?

499
00:40:48,067 --> 00:40:51,457
I don't get caught!

500
00:40:52,797 --> 00:40:55,517
You are under arrest!

501
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:06,477
So, you are the infamous marriage swindler?

502
00:41:07,777 --> 00:41:09,347
Me?

503
00:41:09,347 --> 00:41:10,837
That's not me.

504
00:41:10,837 --> 00:41:13,137
- Arrest her!
-Yes, sir!

505
00:41:24,347 --> 00:41:26,027
Are you all right...

506
00:41:48,117 --> 00:41:49,827
<i>This woman...</i>

507
00:41:58,047 --> 00:41:59,347
<i>Did I just...</i>

508
00:41:59,347 --> 00:42:01,887
<i>run into the arms of the Royal Investigation Bureau?</i>

509
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:03,790
<i>Damn it, I'm doomed!</i>

510
00:42:13,647 --> 00:42:15,337
So...

511
00:42:15,337 --> 00:42:17,107
it's that woman.

512
00:42:20,667 --> 00:42:23,737
Giddy up!

513
00:42:28,187 --> 00:42:29,857
Young lady...

514
00:42:29,857 --> 00:42:31,087
Giddy up!

515
00:42:31,087 --> 00:42:33,697
Where are you going in such a rush?

516
00:42:33,697 --> 00:42:35,327
Damn it!

517
00:42:45,717 --> 00:42:47,747
Did you prepare it?

518
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,027
You are under arrest.

519
00:44:20,027 --> 00:44:22,817
W-Why would I be?

520
00:44:24,937 --> 00:44:27,217
You dare to insult the king?

521
00:44:31,517 --> 00:44:33,277
Hey, hey!

522
00:44:33,277 --> 00:44:35,127
Let me go!

523
00:44:35,127 --> 00:44:36,467
Ah, you're so loud!

524
00:44:36,467 --> 00:44:38,587
Be quiet!

525
00:44:44,017 --> 00:44:45,797
A marriage swindler, I see.

526
00:44:45,797 --> 00:44:49,897
Why are you committing marriage fraud at a time such as this?

527
00:44:54,137 --> 00:44:55,897
Sir.

528
00:44:56,487 --> 00:44:59,177
Have you ever heard of the Matchmaking god?

529
00:44:59,177 --> 00:45:02,827
The matchmaker connects the pinky fingers of a couple destined to be together

530
00:45:02,827 --> 00:45:05,017
with a red string of fate.

531
00:45:05,017 --> 00:45:10,167
So, how could a national edict sever such a connection?

532
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:12,477
A destined connection cannot be severed, you say?

533
00:45:12,477 --> 00:45:15,867
All I did was just help others follow where that string led.

534
00:45:15,867 --> 00:45:19,487
I have never done anything evil.

535
00:45:26,277 --> 00:45:28,727
What is your name?

536
00:45:28,727 --> 00:45:31,777
My name is So Rang.

537
00:45:31,777 --> 00:45:33,967
To form a connection...

538
00:45:33,967 --> 00:45:35,887
No matter how hard I tried,

539
00:45:35,887 --> 00:45:37,977
some relationships never work out.

540
00:45:37,977 --> 00:45:41,677
It appears that you have not been able to see

541
00:45:41,677 --> 00:45:44,717
a person you have been loving deeply for a long time.

542
00:45:44,717 --> 00:45:46,057
You wicked girl!

543
00:45:46,057 --> 00:45:47,837
How dare you try to commit fraud here!

544
00:45:47,837 --> 00:45:50,377
You're trying to commit fraud against the Royal Investigation Bureau chief?

545
00:45:50,377 --> 00:45:53,107
This girl will end up in big trouble one day.

546
00:45:53,107 --> 00:45:55,407
Although we live in a time where marrying is a crime,

547
00:45:55,407 --> 00:45:57,907
having feelings for someone is not a crime.

548
00:45:57,907 --> 00:46:01,297
If that's a crime, then you're also a criminal, sir.

549
00:46:01,297 --> 00:46:05,600
Do you not already have feelings for her?

550
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:09,567
Everyone living in Joseon would be a criminal

551
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:13,137
for having feelings for another.

552
00:46:15,977 --> 00:46:18,007
Until you repent for your crime,

553
00:46:18,007 --> 00:46:20,837
you will not be released from this prison.

554
00:46:20,837 --> 00:46:23,547
What? W-Wait!

555
00:46:29,347 --> 00:46:31,657
Wow!

556
00:46:31,657 --> 00:46:33,647
Your speech was amazing!

557
00:46:33,647 --> 00:46:36,197
"Everyone who lives in Joseon would then be a criminal,

558
00:46:36,197 --> 00:46:39,377
for having feelings for another."

559
00:46:39,377 --> 00:46:41,107
- What is this...
- Then...

560
00:46:41,107 --> 00:46:45,537
do you think people like us will be able to find a partner?

561
00:46:45,537 --> 00:46:47,327
Who are you?

562
00:46:49,327 --> 00:46:51,127
If love is a crime, then we are criminals.

563
00:46:51,127 --> 00:46:54,217
- We've never been in a relationship before.
- I'm Wang Bae.

564
00:46:54,217 --> 00:46:56,087
<i>(Seol Ro: Someone who has a hard time talking to the opposite sex)</i>

565
00:46:56,087 --> 00:46:58,157
I'm Oh Deok Hun.

566
00:46:58,157 --> 00:47:00,477
<i>Seoll Ro*
(=Solo)</i>

567
00:47:00,477 --> 00:47:03,207
How dare they try to pull one like that?

568
00:47:04,507 --> 00:47:07,907
Since it's fate that we've met like this, please help us.

569
00:47:07,907 --> 00:47:10,387
Hey, don't even talk with these guys.

570
00:47:10,387 --> 00:47:13,537
They got caught spying on women washing their hair in the creek.

571
00:47:13,537 --> 00:47:15,537
- What do you mean we were spying!
- Spying?

572
00:47:15,537 --> 00:47:16,927
I said we went there to wash as well.

573
00:47:16,927 --> 00:47:18,947
Hurry up and pull out your head!

574
00:47:19,547 --> 00:47:21,177
Geez.

575
00:47:23,847 --> 00:47:26,437
I want everyone to leave me be.

576
00:47:28,477 --> 00:47:30,827
Wow.

577
00:47:30,827 --> 00:47:33,637
Man, how long has it been?

578
00:47:33,637 --> 00:47:35,177
Wow.

579
00:47:40,047 --> 00:47:42,397
How do I get out of here?

580
00:47:45,467 --> 00:47:48,557
To think that I came all the way here

581
00:47:48,557 --> 00:47:50,430
for such a petty criminal...

582
00:47:51,887 --> 00:47:55,467
Your Majesty, you need to hurry up and return.

583
00:47:55,467 --> 00:47:57,757
Let us do that.

584
00:47:59,437 --> 00:48:02,187
<i>You wretches!</i>

585
00:48:03,177 --> 00:48:06,980
Do you know who I am that you're holding me in here?

586
00:48:07,587 --> 00:48:09,127
I am...

587
00:48:10,657 --> 00:48:13,420
the Matchmaker god!

588
00:48:14,197 --> 00:48:16,247
<i>The Matchmaker god?</i>

589
00:48:16,247 --> 00:48:18,257
H-Hey, hey! Look over there...

590
00:48:18,257 --> 00:48:20,487
Is she being possessed?

591
00:48:20,487 --> 00:48:23,847
Since she's a fortune teller, I guess the spirit comes in and out of her at times.

592
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:27,447
I, the Matchmaker god, say

593
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:30,997
that the Marriage Ban Edict will end this year!

594
00:48:30,997 --> 00:48:34,557
She says the Marriage Ban Edict will end!

595
00:48:34,557 --> 00:48:38,077
Does that mean a new queen will be selected this year?

596
00:48:38,077 --> 00:48:39,567
However,

597
00:48:39,567 --> 00:48:43,377
if the king does not get rid of the spirit of the dead crown princess that is in him,

598
00:48:43,377 --> 00:48:49,317
the life of the new queen would also be in danger.

599
00:48:49,317 --> 00:48:51,667
If that happens, you all

600
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:58,167
- will have to live as Seol Ro forever!
<i> - No!</i>

601
00:48:58,877 --> 00:49:01,057
She's been arrested for committing fraud.

602
00:49:01,057 --> 00:49:02,767
Do you all actually believe her?

603
00:49:02,767 --> 00:49:06,357
Seol Ro!

604
00:49:06,357 --> 00:49:09,197
I, the Matchmaker god, say

605
00:49:09,197 --> 00:49:12,697
that if the Marriage Ban Edict does not end by this year,

606
00:49:12,697 --> 00:49:15,537
there will be great woe upon this palace.

607
00:49:15,537 --> 00:49:17,627
There will be

608
00:49:17,627 --> 00:49:20,897
a plague of Seol Ro in this nation!

609
00:49:20,897 --> 00:49:24,077
<i>A plague of being Seol Ro!</i>

610
00:49:27,307 --> 00:49:29,237
Sin Won.

611
00:49:30,377 --> 00:49:32,987
At the hour of the swine*,
<i>(between 9 p.m. - 11 p.m.)</i> bring her to me.

612
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:47,837
Criminal, listen to me.

613
00:49:47,837 --> 00:49:51,047
Your crime has fallen upon the ears of the king.

614
00:49:51,047 --> 00:49:52,517
What?

615
00:49:53,267 --> 00:49:54,087
Wait, what?

616
00:49:54,087 --> 00:49:56,647
The king will interrogate you himself,

617
00:49:56,647 --> 00:49:57,537
so prepare yourself.

618
00:49:57,537 --> 00:50:00,397
The king h-himself?

619
00:50:08,457 --> 00:50:10,477
Hey, hey...

620
00:50:10,477 --> 00:50:13,057
W-Why am I seeing the king?

621
00:50:13,057 --> 00:50:17,837
Does a lowly commoner like me usually see the king for something like this?

622
00:50:27,197 --> 00:50:28,117
Hey!

623
00:50:28,117 --> 00:50:30,347
<i>Since you cannot meet the king looking like this,</i>

624
00:50:30,347 --> 00:50:32,577
<i>change your clothes first.</i>

625
00:50:52,587 --> 00:50:54,647
Prostrate yourself.

626
00:51:01,527 --> 00:51:03,727
Lift your head.

627
00:51:08,797 --> 00:51:11,407
So, you have a channeling ability.

628
00:51:12,677 --> 00:51:14,307
Well, that's not entirely true...

629
00:51:14,307 --> 00:51:16,527
It comes and goes.

630
00:51:16,527 --> 00:51:18,627
I go back and forth, sir.

631
00:51:18,627 --> 00:51:22,007
Supposedly, the Matchmaker god came into you earlier?

632
00:51:22,677 --> 00:51:24,997
Well, that...

633
00:51:24,997 --> 00:51:28,297
was not intended, but yes.

634
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:30,880
Lift your head and speak.

635
00:51:31,527 --> 00:51:34,747
Do I really have a spirit attached to me?

636
00:51:44,967 --> 00:51:46,577
<i>He's the king?</i>

637
00:51:46,577 --> 00:51:47,807
<i>Whoa, daebak.</i>

638
00:51:47,807 --> 00:51:49,247
<i>He's a flower boy.</i>

639
00:51:49,247 --> 00:51:53,917
<i>But his face looks like he hasn't slept for a few days, is gaunt, and his eyes are gloomy.</i>

640
00:51:53,917 --> 00:51:56,067
<i>Even then, his face is hot, no, I mean...</i>

641
00:51:56,067 --> 00:51:57,747
<i>One conclusion comes to mind.</i>

642
00:51:57,747 --> 00:52:01,207
<i>It's just the face of someone hurting from losing a loved one.</i>

643
00:52:01,207 --> 00:52:02,757
<i>Spirit, my foot.</i>

644
00:52:02,757 --> 00:52:04,887
<i>He's being like that, been hallucinating.</i>

645
00:52:04,887 --> 00:52:06,417
You do...

646
00:52:11,067 --> 00:52:12,897
have a spirit on you.

647
00:52:16,687 --> 00:52:20,077
You probably have trouble sleeping at night

648
00:52:20,077 --> 00:52:22,547
because it is the time when that spirit is most active.

649
00:52:22,547 --> 00:52:24,757
And even though you're not really sick,

650
00:52:24,757 --> 00:52:27,077
you have trouble eating food.

651
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:30,897
Don't you sometimes see and hear imaginary things?

652
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:34,507
And you probably felt great pain in your stomach

653
00:52:34,507 --> 00:52:37,327
as if you've been hit with a metal hammer.

654
00:52:38,137 --> 00:52:40,187
That's true.

655
00:52:40,187 --> 00:52:42,657
It hurts. It hurts a lot.

656
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:47,697
The crown princess keeps saying something in my dream,

657
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:50,320
but I just can't seem to make out what she says. What...

658
00:52:50,837 --> 00:52:53,207
is she trying to say?

659
00:52:54,497 --> 00:52:56,887
<i>If I knew that, I would be a true channeler.</i>

660
00:52:56,887 --> 00:52:59,267
<i>What was the name of the king again?</i>

661
00:52:59,267 --> 00:53:01,487
Heon? Yi... Yi Heon?

662
00:53:01,487 --> 00:53:03,197
Heon-i?

663
00:53:07,927 --> 00:53:10,437
I saw the crown princess' face in my dream...

664
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:13,127
but her face was so faint.

665
00:53:14,937 --> 00:53:17,927
If you truly have a channeling ability,

666
00:53:17,927 --> 00:53:20,857
could you call forth the crown princess to appear before me?

667
00:53:20,857 --> 00:53:22,117
Excuse me?

668
00:53:22,117 --> 00:53:25,987
Well, her body's already gone, though...

669
00:53:25,987 --> 00:53:27,517
Then,

670
00:53:27,517 --> 00:53:31,347
how can I believe that you have a channeling ability?

671
00:53:34,757 --> 00:53:36,777
I guess you don't have a channeling ability after all!

672
00:53:36,777 --> 00:53:38,417
Oh, no, no.

673
00:53:38,417 --> 00:53:40,717
No way!

674
00:53:57,317 --> 00:54:00,117
Although I cannot show the crown princess to you,

675
00:54:00,117 --> 00:54:04,767
it should be possible for me to channel her spirit.

676
00:54:58,297 --> 00:55:00,030
Your Highness,

677
00:55:00,507 --> 00:55:04,237
have you been well?

678
00:55:12,537 --> 00:55:15,047
Is it really you, Crown Princess?

679
00:55:15,047 --> 00:55:16,727
Let me first

680
00:55:16,727 --> 00:55:20,047
offer you a bow.

681
00:55:51,427 --> 00:55:53,837
My physical body,

682
00:55:53,837 --> 00:55:57,200
even my bones have turned to dust,

683
00:55:57,927 --> 00:55:59,227
and now,

684
00:55:59,227 --> 00:56:02,167
even my eyes, nose, and mouth have disappeared,

685
00:56:02,167 --> 00:56:07,027
and there is no more evidence that I even existed on this earth.

686
00:56:07,027 --> 00:56:11,777
However, the reason why my spirit is still here

687
00:56:11,777 --> 00:56:13,907
is because

688
00:56:14,817 --> 00:56:16,447
I am hurting so badly.

689
00:56:16,447 --> 00:56:18,047
Hur—

690
00:56:18,047 --> 00:56:20,357
Hurting? How are you hurting?

691
00:56:20,357 --> 00:56:25,347
It hurts me to see you in so much pain

692
00:56:25,347 --> 00:56:27,587
because of me, Your Highness.

693
00:56:30,417 --> 00:56:32,867
I have committed

694
00:56:33,867 --> 00:56:36,387
a great act of disloyalty

695
00:56:38,897 --> 00:56:41,910
by departing first and leaving you behind.

696
00:56:42,667 --> 00:56:45,527
I don't know how I can be forgiven for my sin.

697
00:56:47,037 --> 00:56:48,697
I am...

698
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:51,087
so sorry.

699
00:56:53,297 --> 00:56:55,987
What do you mean by that...

700
00:56:56,977 --> 00:57:00,987
It was my fault that I could not even protect my wife.

701
00:57:00,987 --> 00:57:04,147
I have been lingering around in this world

702
00:57:04,147 --> 00:57:07,807
because I was worried about you.

703
00:57:07,807 --> 00:57:10,207
So now,

704
00:57:11,357 --> 00:57:14,687
please let me go.

705
00:57:17,807 --> 00:57:19,857
What do you mean, let you go?

706
00:57:20,927 --> 00:57:23,037
Where are you going to go now?

707
00:57:23,037 --> 00:57:25,307
You have to let go of me,

708
00:57:25,307 --> 00:57:28,537
so that I can depart from this world.

709
00:58:11,707 --> 00:58:13,727
I have wanted to see you...

710
00:58:15,567 --> 00:58:17,417
even if it is like this.

711
00:58:17,417 --> 00:58:19,537
You have to

712
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:22,117
let me go now.

713
00:58:22,117 --> 00:58:25,977
You must erase any longing you have for me as well.

714
00:58:25,977 --> 00:58:28,727
Will that be possible in this life?

715
00:58:28,727 --> 00:58:30,167
The spirit of a dead person

716
00:58:30,167 --> 00:58:33,320
cannot stay very long in a living person's body.

717
00:58:34,047 --> 00:58:36,007
I...

718
00:58:37,577 --> 00:58:39,507
must go.

719
00:58:42,797 --> 00:58:44,087
Do not go.

720
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:45,267
Wait...

721
00:58:45,267 --> 00:58:48,057
Please do not go. Be with me for just a bit longer.

722
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:50,757
Please do not go.

723
00:58:50,757 --> 00:58:54,577
- Please do not go.
- Y-Your Majesty.

724
00:58:56,337 --> 00:59:00,287
It appears that Crown Princess has left.

725
00:59:09,547 --> 00:59:11,327
Your Majesty...

726
00:59:14,997 --> 00:59:16,557
Everyone...

727
00:59:16,557 --> 00:59:18,827
Everyone, leave.

728
00:59:21,877 --> 00:59:24,557
So, what will happen to me, then?

729
00:59:24,557 --> 00:59:26,707
Put her back into the cell.

730
00:59:26,707 --> 00:59:28,307
Excuse me?

731
00:59:28,307 --> 00:59:30,327
Excuse me? W-Wait, what?

732
00:59:30,997 --> 00:59:32,357
Wait!

733
00:59:32,357 --> 00:59:35,727
I-I'm going back? Y-Your Majesty!

734
00:59:35,727 --> 00:59:38,957
Your Majesty! Don't you have more to say to Crown Princess?

735
00:59:38,957 --> 00:59:41,107
I'll deliver your message for you, Your Majesty!

736
00:59:41,107 --> 00:59:43,567
Your Majesty!

737
00:59:43,567 --> 00:59:44,957
Let me go!

738
00:59:44,957 --> 00:59:46,387
Hey!

739
00:59:46,387 --> 00:59:47,577
How did it go?

740
00:59:47,577 --> 00:59:49,107
Do not...

741
00:59:49,107 --> 00:59:51,987
talk to me!

742
00:59:51,987 --> 00:59:53,087
I told you.

743
00:59:53,087 --> 00:59:55,717
She's just plain old fraud.

744
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:59,787
Did anything happen back there?

745
01:00:00,817 --> 01:00:02,287
Chief.

746
01:00:02,287 --> 01:00:04,487
Chief Lee Sin Won!

747
01:00:05,787 --> 01:00:07,337
Lee Sin Won?

748
01:00:07,987 --> 01:00:10,367
Lee Sin Won?

749
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:11,947
What's wrong?

750
01:00:11,947 --> 01:00:13,907
Your name is Lee Sin Won, Chief?

751
01:00:13,907 --> 01:00:15,787
The willow tree family's firstborn son?

752
01:00:15,787 --> 01:00:17,297
H-How do you know that?

753
01:00:17,297 --> 01:00:19,467
That's what I used to be called.

754
01:00:19,467 --> 01:00:20,407
Well, I mean...

755
01:00:20,407 --> 01:00:25,597
<i>The willow tree family's firstborn son, Lee Sin Won.</i>

756
01:00:30,497 --> 01:00:35,537
You're going to be in big trouble if you underestimate

757
01:00:35,537 --> 01:00:37,887
my channeling ability!

758
01:00:41,197 --> 01:00:43,917
How did she know

759
01:00:43,917 --> 01:00:46,127
that you're seeing apparitions?

760
01:00:47,717 --> 01:00:50,797
I thought it was just my imagination...

761
01:00:58,591 --> 01:01:02,227
<i>Your Majesty, please end the Marriage Ban Edict quickly!</i>

762
01:01:02,227 --> 01:01:04,067
Who are you?

763
01:01:04,067 --> 01:01:06,727
I asked who you are!

764
01:01:06,727 --> 01:01:09,037
<i>- Your Majesty, the crown prince's depression is severe.</i>
- Go away!

765
01:01:09,037 --> 01:01:11,717
<i>- Please end the Marriage Ban Edict quickly</i>
- Go away!

766
01:01:11,717 --> 01:01:13,647
<i>- and select the next queen.
- Please select your next queen.</i>

767
01:01:13,647 --> 01:01:16,857
<i>Your Majesty, do you remember me?</i>

768
01:01:16,857 --> 01:01:19,517
<i>- Your Majesty.
- Be quiet.</i>

769
01:01:20,757 --> 01:01:23,667
<i>Supposedly, another body was left hanging in the crown princess' quarters.</i>

770
01:01:43,197 --> 01:01:46,447
<i>How many days to go until the crown princess' memorial day?</i>

771
01:01:47,607 --> 01:01:51,867
If we can't find the murderer before then,

772
01:01:51,867 --> 01:01:55,287
there will be another body of a woman hanging in the crown princess' palace.

773
01:01:55,287 --> 01:01:57,157
This is already the sixth year.

774
01:01:57,157 --> 01:02:00,217
Every year, on the same day and in the same place,

775
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:02,247
a body of a woman is left hanging.

776
01:02:02,247 --> 01:02:04,667
We could not revive any of them.

777
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:05,837
During the last selection,

778
01:02:05,837 --> 01:02:10,027
the most likely candidate selected within the inner circle died.

779
01:02:10,027 --> 01:02:14,857
That's why we canceled the selection as if it were your decision.

780
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:17,467
The Marriage Ban Edict of this nation

781
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:20,107
is essentially the plot of a traitor.

782
01:02:20,107 --> 01:02:24,267
The crown princess was not someone who would commit suicide, Royal Father!

783
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,667
Please...

784
01:02:26,667 --> 01:02:30,727
Please let me at least hold a funeral for her.

785
01:02:30,727 --> 01:02:33,007
Please, please, at least a funeral...

786
01:02:33,007 --> 01:02:35,277
Crown Prince.

787
01:02:35,277 --> 01:02:39,477
There's no way we could hold a funeral for someone who violates the law by committing suicide.

788
01:02:39,477 --> 01:02:43,267
I will personally speak with my royal father and hear what he has to say.

789
01:02:43,267 --> 01:02:47,657
I am the one who put His Majesty the king on the throne.

790
01:02:47,657 --> 01:02:50,887
Therefore, there is no need for you to hear the king's will,

791
01:02:50,887 --> 01:02:55,807
for my word is the will of the king.

792
01:02:55,807 --> 01:02:57,787
What are you all doing?

793
01:02:57,787 --> 01:03:01,067
Escort the crown prince back to his palace.

794
01:03:01,067 --> 01:03:04,207
Royal Father! Royal Father!

795
01:03:04,207 --> 01:03:08,277
However, if I manage to catch all the traitors,

796
01:03:08,277 --> 01:03:10,527
will I stop hearing these sounds

797
01:03:10,527 --> 01:03:13,317
and stop seeing these apparitions?

798
01:03:17,767 --> 01:03:20,027
Sin Won, you're here.

799
01:03:20,917 --> 01:03:22,427
I must be going crazy,

800
01:03:22,427 --> 01:03:25,427
seeing how I am glad to see these apparitions...

801
01:03:28,567 --> 01:03:30,427
If you are suffering that much,

802
01:03:30,427 --> 01:03:34,097
how about keeping her by your side?

803
01:03:34,097 --> 01:03:37,407
From what I can tell, she seemed to have some channelling ability.

804
01:03:37,407 --> 01:03:39,227
Why not keep her by your side

805
01:03:39,227 --> 01:03:42,807
and console the spirit of the deceased crown princess?

806
01:03:42,807 --> 01:03:46,657
We can have her enter the palace under the guise of an inner court maid.

807
01:03:46,657 --> 01:03:52,047
However, this will all be part of the process of letting the crown princess go.

808
01:03:52,957 --> 01:03:55,617
Would you be able to do this?

809
01:03:57,907 --> 01:03:59,387
Sin Won.

810
01:03:59,387 --> 01:04:03,297
You told me before that I need to forget her.

811
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:07,677
Could you watch over that girl when she enters the palace?

812
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,297
As you already know, the palace is...

813
01:04:10,297 --> 01:04:12,287
a bit dangerous.

814
01:04:13,597 --> 01:04:16,977
Your will is my command.

815
01:04:44,217 --> 01:04:46,207
Come out now.

816
01:04:48,817 --> 01:04:51,637
<i>The reason why I am still here is</i>

817
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:53,467
<i>because I am</i>

818
01:04:53,467 --> 01:04:55,247
<i>hurting so badly.</i>

819
01:04:55,247 --> 01:04:59,897
<i>It hurts me to see you in so much pain</i>

820
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:00,767
<i>because of me, Your Highness.</i>

821
01:05:00,767 --> 01:05:03,377
<i>I have been lingering around the nether world because I was worried about you.</i>

822
01:05:03,377 --> 01:05:05,897
<i>You have to let me go now.</i>

823
01:05:05,897 --> 01:05:09,927
<i>You must erase your longing for me as well.</i>

824
01:06:05,217 --> 01:06:06,477
Follow me.

825
01:06:06,477 --> 01:06:09,157
I will tell you where you will be staying from now on.

826
01:06:39,087 --> 01:06:41,187
Crown Princess!

827
01:06:41,187 --> 01:06:43,607
Are you here, Crown Princess?

828
01:07:17,717 --> 01:07:20,337
<i>I must be a bit crazy</i>

829
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:23,427
<i>if I am missing even the apparitions.</i>

830

831

832

834

<i>The Forbidden Marriage</i>
<i>Preview</i>

835
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:50,847
<i>It looks like I will have to act as a court lady from now.</i>

836
01:07:50,847 --> 01:07:51,927
<i>Really?</i>

837
01:07:51,927 --> 01:07:54,247
<i>I'll be entering as an inner court maid.</i>

838
01:07:54,247 --> 01:07:55,257
<i>Whoa, that scared me!</i>

839
01:07:55,257 --> 01:07:57,497
<i>Who made the rumbling noise?</i>

840
01:07:57,497 --> 01:07:58,307
<i>Are you hungry?</i>

841
01:07:58,307 --> 01:08:01,117
<i>Is the Crown Princess hungry?</i>

842
01:08:01,117 --> 01:08:04,483
<i>How lost is he without her that he misses a dead person?</i>

843
01:08:04,483 --> 01:08:06,847
<i>You need to help him forget her, even if it means deceiving him.</i>

844
01:08:06,847 --> 01:08:09,797
<i>Will I not get taken away if they find out I deceived him?</i>

845
01:08:09,797 --> 01:08:12,537
<i>I should get him on my side first.</i>

846
01:08:12,537 --> 01:08:15,917
<i>If you drink that entire thing, we will be friends, all right?</i>

847
01:08:15,917 --> 01:08:18,097
<i>Have you ever almost gotten married before?</i>

848
01:08:18,097 --> 01:08:19,750
<i>Ye Hyeon Seon.</i>

849
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:23,020
<i>Do you recognize that name by chance?</i>
