 This is a work of fiction. Characters, incidents, settings, titles, and content have no relevance to real life.

2
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:48,260

3
00:00:56,854 --> 00:00:59,064
 Please stay healthy and safe.

4
00:01:43,484 --> 00:01:47,354
Head Eunuch, were you aware?

5
00:01:47,354 --> 00:01:49,704
Aware of what, you ask?

6
00:01:52,704 --> 00:01:56,694
This is the modified list of court ladies who will be leaving the palace.

7
00:02:08,114 --> 00:02:09,494
  Court Lady Won

8
00:02:21,804 --> 00:02:23,434
 Sin Won...

9
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:39,524
Seriously, what happened...

10
00:02:49,194 --> 00:02:50,834
Your Majesty!

11
00:02:52,134 --> 00:02:55,184
Wait, what brings you here?

12
00:02:58,234 --> 00:03:02,024
I heard you were off duty today.

13
00:03:02,024 --> 00:03:06,284
You should have left me to rest then.

14
00:03:10,284 --> 00:03:12,814
Things are still hard for you, right?

15
00:03:16,214 --> 00:03:19,624
You relied on Sin Won a lot during your time at the palace.

16
00:03:20,314 --> 00:03:21,814
Oh, that...

17
00:03:22,784 --> 00:03:25,884
It breaks my heart as well.

18
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:28,734
I fully understand how you feel.

19
00:03:31,734 --> 00:03:37,694
Because Sin Won was important to us both.

20
00:03:38,314 --> 00:03:40,124
Your Majesty...

21
00:03:43,254 --> 00:03:46,454
Lean on me if things are hard.

22
00:03:46,454 --> 00:03:49,344
I am your lover, after all.

23
00:03:52,564 --> 00:03:54,964
 Episode 9

24
00:04:04,234 --> 00:04:06,994
What is going on? What do you mean you are leaving!

25
00:04:06,994 --> 00:04:10,774
Let go of me first. What if someone sees us?

26
00:04:10,774 --> 00:04:13,554
Is this something you have agreed to?

27
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:17,004
But why? You have spent so many years in this palace!

28
00:04:19,554 --> 00:04:21,654
Still, I must go and look for them.

29
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:24,274
The husband and son I left behind outside.

30
00:04:24,274 --> 00:04:26,324
You said you lost all contact with them, though.

31
00:04:26,324 --> 00:04:28,444
Just how do you plan to find them?

32
00:04:30,124 --> 00:04:32,454
If grief turns to resentment,

33
00:04:32,454 --> 00:04:36,254
it becomes hard like a rock.

34
00:04:36,254 --> 00:04:38,024
That is why

35
00:04:39,994 --> 00:04:42,514
there are masses of rocks in here.

36
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:45,214
If it continues as it is now,

37
00:04:45,214 --> 00:04:48,014
I can't live because the burden is so heavy.

38
00:04:49,444 --> 00:04:51,864
And what if you cannot find them?

39
00:04:53,884 --> 00:04:56,774
I feel that searching for them, at the very least,

40
00:04:56,774 --> 00:04:59,514
would be the proper way to repay

41
00:04:59,514 --> 00:05:01,684
my heart that has kept everything bottled up.

42
00:05:01,684 --> 00:05:03,524
Could things just not remain as they are?

43
00:05:03,524 --> 00:05:05,674
You should assist the king until you die.

44
00:05:05,674 --> 00:05:10,994
Even if you are to leave, send the king off to marry first and then go. Please?

45
00:05:30,294 --> 00:05:35,164
There. Just three bites.

46
00:05:35,164 --> 00:05:37,864
Why did you not tell me even though you knew?

47
00:05:37,864 --> 00:05:40,594
What? That Chun Seok's lifeline is short?

48
00:05:40,594 --> 00:05:43,334
You already knew, did you not? Why did you let my heart break—

49
00:05:43,334 --> 00:05:46,664
There was no human connection between you two, to begin with.

50
00:05:46,664 --> 00:05:50,094
If I had asked you to accept Chun Seok's feelings, would you have done so?

51
00:05:50,094 --> 00:05:52,284
But still...

52
00:05:52,284 --> 00:05:56,544
Relationships and fate are things that are beyond people's control.

53
00:05:56,544 --> 00:05:59,784
Fate, fate, fate! Damn it!

54
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:03,604
Would you say it was also fate that I was brought back from being kidnapped and almost killed?

55
00:06:03,604 --> 00:06:07,664
So Rang also survived near death. And that is why she is continuing the path of her fate.

56
00:06:07,664 --> 00:06:09,824
Who says that road will be straight?

57
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:14,824
Even if her foot blisters and bleeds along the way, that is the road that was laid out for her.

58
00:06:14,824 --> 00:06:18,564
Every twist and turn in wandering is part of her fate.

59
00:06:23,714 --> 00:06:29,364
Hae Yeong. Whether that road is paved with flowers or rocks,

60
00:06:29,364 --> 00:06:32,024
you must walk down it to know.

61
00:06:38,994 --> 00:06:41,424
My gosh! You cannot do this here, Your Majesty.

62
00:06:41,424 --> 00:06:43,994
What do you mean, I cannot? We are lovers!

63
00:06:43,994 --> 00:06:48,314
Please, will you! Why are you doing this here instead of in your comfortable quarters?

64
00:06:48,314 --> 00:06:52,584
- Because you are not there. 
 - Then, are you asking me to work here, too?

65
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:57,144
Work? Is all this time we shared simply work for you?

66
00:06:57,144 --> 00:07:00,674
Do you not know how difficult it is to put you to bed, Your Majesty?

67
00:07:00,674 --> 00:07:04,554
Coming from someone who dozed off and fell asleep before me all the time, huh?

68
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:09,694
A-All... What do you mean, all the time? I just... occasionally...

69
00:07:09,694 --> 00:07:12,024
Once in a while. There were times like that.

70
00:07:12,024 --> 00:07:16,674
- Then, I will do that "work" for you tonight. 
 - Do what?

71
00:07:16,674 --> 00:07:20,594
Putting you to sleep. Lie down.

72
00:07:20,594 --> 00:07:23,154
Gosh, seriously.

73
00:07:24,514 --> 00:07:30,764
Then, you must promise nothing will happen, all right?

74
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:33,904
And what exactly entails this "nothing" you speak of?

75
00:07:33,904 --> 00:07:37,704
I share this room with Court Lady Won.

76
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:39,690
In such a place ...

77
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:45,010
should we let such a shameful thing happen or not?

78
00:07:46,184 --> 00:07:51,204
D-Do... Do you not know just how much

79
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,024
of an innocent and pure man I am?

80
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:55,864
For the last seven years ...!

81
00:07:55,864 --> 00:07:59,394
Yes, for seven years that I...

82
00:07:59,394 --> 00:08:00,964
Lie down.

83
00:08:03,954 --> 00:08:06,794
I shall be the one to put you to sleep tonight.

84
00:08:06,794 --> 00:08:09,554
- Close your eyes. 
 - This is quite the pressure.

85
00:08:09,554 --> 00:08:11,904
You must close your eyes quickly, then.

86
00:08:18,654 --> 00:08:22,124
Your Majesty, I apologize, but...

87
00:08:24,614 --> 00:08:28,084
If you are sorry, please come again next time.

88
00:08:29,314 --> 00:08:30,994
Now, go to sleep.

89
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:34,764
They have returned.

90
00:08:45,264 --> 00:08:47,944
- I'm your servant, Choi Seon Hyeok. 
 - And I'm Ji Hwal.

91
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,604
We have returned after fulfilling Your Majesty's orders.

92
00:08:50,604 --> 00:08:54,194
Very well. Did you find Sin Won?

93
00:08:54,194 --> 00:08:57,634
Have you found... Lee Sin Won?

94
00:09:00,324 --> 00:09:01,174
No.

95
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:04,094
It will be good to rid of him completely.

96
00:09:04,094 --> 00:09:05,794
 The drawers were empty...

97
00:09:05,794 --> 00:09:08,894
 It was as if someone gave them a warning in advance.

98
00:09:08,894 --> 00:09:12,754
 Perhaps someone among us has been bought off by them?

99
00:09:15,234 --> 00:09:19,534
How could you fail at such a short distance!

100
00:09:19,534 --> 00:09:22,544
Someone just happened to get hit in his place and died.

101
00:09:23,534 --> 00:09:28,364
- Forgive me. 
 - Lee Sin Won, that bastard. You must never let him live.

102
00:09:28,364 --> 00:09:34,034
Follow him to the ends of the earth and get rid of him without fail.

103
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:35,814
Yes, My Lady.

104
00:09:40,604 --> 00:09:44,514
We could not... find him.

105
00:09:47,284 --> 00:09:49,854
 He did not return home.

106
00:09:59,634 --> 00:10:03,424
 We could not locate his whereabouts anywhere.

107
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:08,254
Find him at all costs. Find him, and...

108
00:10:09,804 --> 00:10:12,144
Shall we bring him back to the palace?

109
00:10:14,434 --> 00:10:19,794
No. For now, just check that he is safe and sound.

110
00:10:19,794 --> 00:10:22,044
Sang Ju.

111
00:10:23,404 --> 00:10:26,604
Guide and send him off to his path.

112
00:10:26,604 --> 00:10:28,664
M-My lady! Your Excellency!

113
00:10:28,664 --> 00:10:32,324
This time, I will surely succeed without fail! My Lady!

114
00:10:36,164 --> 00:10:39,834
Isn't that bastard someone you can't allow to live?

115
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:44,494
In any case, that incompetent fool can't kill anyone.

116
00:10:44,494 --> 00:10:47,044
I've heard the news.

117
00:10:49,464 --> 00:10:53,784
They say the business of trafficking women is no longer possible.

118
00:11:04,484 --> 00:11:06,334
What do you plan to do now?

119
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:09,734
My Lady, such a thing should bring you joy,

120
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:12,384
enough to make you dance.

121
00:11:12,384 --> 00:11:15,934
The plans you have set for a long time now

122
00:11:15,934 --> 00:11:19,214
are finally able to bloom.

123
00:11:19,214 --> 00:11:22,284
If kidnapping women is no longer possible,

124
00:11:22,284 --> 00:11:28,224
that must mean there is no longer a need for the  Marriage Ban Edict.

125
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,984
Then?

126
00:11:33,354 --> 00:11:37,264
Your Majesty, we can no longer postpone the royal marriage.

127
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:42,924
Please select a queen as soon as possible and fill the queen position.

128
00:11:47,224 --> 00:11:52,814
Of course! No time should be wasted in pushing for the royal marriage.

129
00:11:54,524 --> 00:11:59,484
The court ministers used to make all kinds of excuses are now pushing, all of a sudden?

130
00:12:00,204 --> 00:12:05,074
Of course, I must select a queen but I am worried about So Rang.

131
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:09,194
To seat someone other than So Rang as my queen...

132
00:12:09,194 --> 00:12:11,564
That certainly must not happen.

133
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,774
There is a way, Your Majesty.

134
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:16,364
That is...

135
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:22,834
Well...

136
00:12:23,524 --> 00:12:25,044
Well?

137
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:28,474
Well...

138
00:12:32,484 --> 00:12:38,684
If So Rang were to conceive a crown prince who would serve as heir to this nation, it might be possible.

139
00:12:38,684 --> 00:12:41,914
To make So Rang a legitimate queen.

140
00:12:42,914 --> 00:12:46,114
So, to let her conceive, first of all...

141
00:12:48,224 --> 00:12:49,974
I don't think I can.

142
00:12:49,974 --> 00:12:52,464
W-We're going at too fast of a pace.

143
00:12:52,464 --> 00:12:56,194
What do you mean fast? You are now lovers, are you not?

144
00:12:56,194 --> 00:12:59,294
Still, not a chance!

145
00:12:59,294 --> 00:13:02,514
I still need some time to get to know her.

146
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:08,274
Or perhaps, Your Majesty... Are you not being true to your feelings?

147
00:13:08,274 --> 00:13:12,684
What do you mean? I am totally being true to her! Totally!

148
00:13:12,684 --> 00:13:14,574
Well, um.

149
00:13:14,574 --> 00:13:18,594
In that case, I shall set something up.

150
00:13:18,594 --> 00:13:19,804
Set up what?

151
00:13:19,804 --> 00:13:24,664
An opportunity where you may get to know each other and grow closer to one another.

152
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:32,844
Namsangol Flash Market*?
 (Current day flea market in Jung-gu, Seoul)

153
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:34,544
Yes.

154
00:13:34,544 --> 00:13:35,584
Have you been there before?

155
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:36,974
Of course, I have!

156
00:13:36,974 --> 00:13:40,864
Because it opens briefly only for two hours and then closes thereafter, they call it the Flash Market.

157
00:13:40,864 --> 00:13:42,794
Yes.

158
00:13:42,794 --> 00:13:45,800
I wanted to take some time and look at how the people make a living.

159
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,100
How about we go together?

160
00:13:49,164 --> 00:13:54,814
We will go to look around, and also buy some items here and there.

161
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:56,114
Your Majesty.

162
00:13:56,114 --> 00:13:59,454
That place is not somewhere you go to have fun.

163
00:13:59,454 --> 00:14:03,124
That place... is great for business.

164
00:14:03,124 --> 00:14:05,584
We must make money!

165
00:14:05,584 --> 00:14:07,594
Well, that's...

166
00:14:07,594 --> 00:14:10,154
Are you suggesting to set up a display to sell goods there?

167
00:14:10,154 --> 00:14:13,794
With so many people gathering there, we must at least make a display on the ground, no?

168
00:14:13,794 --> 00:14:17,054
Well... I am the king.

169
00:14:17,054 --> 00:14:21,014
I do not really need to make money, nor do I need more.

170
00:14:21,014 --> 00:14:27,164
Your Majesty still does not know the fun in moneymaking, I see.

171
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:33,164
Well. Money, you say. What do you propose we sell?

172
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:38,014
All right, I will tell them to bring the most expensive treasure from the royal family.

173
00:14:38,014 --> 00:14:41,054
You sure do not know how to analyze your customers.

174
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:45,184
But to make money, we should sell something expensive.

175
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,284
No, no.

176
00:14:47,284 --> 00:14:49,384
Thread is all you need.

177
00:14:49,384 --> 00:14:51,074
Thread?

178
00:15:06,034 --> 00:15:07,444
This is a knot, right? Please make me one.

179
00:15:07,444 --> 00:15:08,614
Please make me one.

180
00:15:08,614 --> 00:15:09,744
 Me, too!

181
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:13,434
Here. Go ahead and pick your colors.

182
00:15:14,134 --> 00:15:15,664
Knot?

183
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,774
For me, this one.

184
00:15:16,774 --> 00:15:18,714
And I want this one.

185
00:15:34,304 --> 00:15:35,584
There.

186
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:38,374
Ten bun* each.
 (Ancient Korean currency, 100 bun = 1 nyang)

187
00:15:38,374 --> 00:15:40,454
Ten bun?

188
00:15:40,454 --> 00:15:42,814
Thank you.

189
00:15:42,814 --> 00:15:44,534
So pretty...

190
00:15:44,534 --> 00:15:48,024
So Rang. One bunch of thread doesn't even cost 10 bun.

191
00:15:48,024 --> 00:15:51,254
Does it make sense that this mere knot costs 10 bun?

192
00:15:51,254 --> 00:15:55,554
That is what you call business, Your Majesty Yi.

193
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:59,004
No, this is called swindling. Is it not?

194
00:16:00,004 --> 00:16:01,644
Seems like swindling to me...

195
00:16:01,644 --> 00:16:06,194
 I am actually... a real swindler, you see...

196
00:16:06,194 --> 00:16:07,554
Come and take a look at the colors.

197
00:16:07,554 --> 00:16:10,614
If I make a knot like this, I should be able to marry Jun Jun, right?

198
00:16:10,614 --> 00:16:12,294
They say the queen selection is near.

199
00:16:12,294 --> 00:16:13,894
Just wait until the Marriage Ban Edict is over.

200
00:16:13,894 --> 00:16:16,824
I shall accept you as my husband.

201
00:16:16,824 --> 00:16:20,074
- Come, come. Come now and pick your colors. 
 - Look, isn't that pretty?

202
00:16:20,074 --> 00:16:22,704
- I want to buy it.
 - What should I do?

203
00:16:22,704 --> 00:16:25,404
There. Ten bun it is.

204
00:16:25,404 --> 00:16:27,954
All right, please come again next time.

205
00:16:29,384 --> 00:16:31,434
Well, Your Majesty Yi?

206
00:16:31,434 --> 00:16:35,244
If you have two hands, do not stand idly by. Increase the inventory.

207
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,794
Ah, right. Yes, yes.

208
00:16:40,244 --> 00:16:43,974
Come now and take a look at the colors. Oh, that would look good on you.

209
00:16:43,974 --> 00:16:49,184
But this is... L-Like... this?

210
00:16:49,184 --> 00:16:53,774
Like this... This, this! Such a disgraceful hand! We must throw this away.

211
00:16:53,774 --> 00:16:57,534
Oh, leave it. That is ours.

212
00:16:58,264 --> 00:17:00,064
Use this for us?

213
00:17:00,064 --> 00:17:03,244
I like that one better.

214
00:17:06,144 --> 00:17:08,814
Did you do this type of business in the past?

215
00:17:08,814 --> 00:17:14,904
Like the weft thread and warp thread, I used to work on connecting two together.

216
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:20,114
However, I was not able to successfully tie the knots.

217
00:17:20,114 --> 00:17:21,854
Now...

218
00:17:21,854 --> 00:17:25,744
Your Majesty Yi should end the Marriage Ban Edict,

219
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:30,334
and tie the knot between these young men and women.

220
00:17:33,544 --> 00:17:34,804
There we go.

221
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,264
 Wow, so pretty...

222
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:39,944
Now, now. It is a pity, but we have exhausted all our supplies.

223
00:17:39,944 --> 00:17:42,664
That's it for today.

224
00:17:44,824 --> 00:17:47,174
Next time...

225
00:17:48,974 --> 00:17:50,934
There.

226
00:17:52,124 --> 00:17:54,254
Let us go now.

227
00:17:54,254 --> 00:17:55,774
You said you wanted to have some fun, right?

228
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,304
No, no need.

229
00:17:57,304 --> 00:18:01,474
You were right. This moneymaking business is a whole lot more fun.

230
00:18:03,224 --> 00:18:07,674
We, too... shall make a knot.* 
 (In Korean, it means to come to a conclusion)

231
00:18:12,754 --> 00:18:14,604
Your Majesty, look at this!

232
00:18:14,604 --> 00:18:15,784
You plan to buy this?

233
00:18:15,784 --> 00:18:19,744
Why are you spending all that hard-earned money on something like this?

234
00:18:20,864 --> 00:18:22,464
Give us two, please.

235
00:18:22,464 --> 00:18:24,104
That would be four bun.

236
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,424
Looks good.

237
00:18:25,424 --> 00:18:28,054
Here you go. Can't eat it, can you?*
 (Teasing the customer)

238
00:18:29,134 --> 00:18:30,624
Can you catch it? Hurry, hurry, get it.

239
00:18:30,624 --> 00:18:33,014
Come on, catch it! Such a fool you are.

240
00:18:33,014 --> 00:18:35,304
Quickly, catch it!

241
00:18:35,304 --> 00:18:36,464
So chewy, chewy...

242
00:18:36,464 --> 00:18:38,994
Dismember him!*
  (Punishment for treason)

243
00:18:40,524 --> 00:18:44,384
This man, you see... He has a lot of anger inside of him.

244
00:18:48,614 --> 00:18:53,374
Is it right for someone to draw the portrait of the king carelessly like this?

245
00:18:53,374 --> 00:18:56,494
No one here knows that you are the king, Your Majesty.

246
00:18:56,494 --> 00:18:58,724
Just smile.

247
00:19:00,854 --> 00:19:04,414
It is so beautiful.

248
00:19:21,424 --> 00:19:23,034
Give me that thing from earlier.

249
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:26,654
That trash? It came out so strange, though...

250
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,424
So what if the design is a bit clumsy?

251
00:19:31,424 --> 00:19:35,434
His majesty Yi himself made it.

252
00:19:47,214 --> 00:19:48,894
There.

253
00:19:50,664 --> 00:19:52,544
So pretty.

254
00:19:57,794 --> 00:19:59,734
Hey, hey! Over there!

255
00:19:59,734 --> 00:20:03,004
Who is tying a knot there again, huh?

256
00:20:03,004 --> 00:20:04,934
- Was this illegal?
 - We live in a time when marriage is forbidden.

257
00:20:04,934 --> 00:20:07,534
All this must not be exactly legal.

258
00:20:07,534 --> 00:20:09,184
They arrest people for even this?

259
00:20:10,224 --> 00:20:13,574
Why! Why would I run away? I'm the king.

260
00:20:13,574 --> 00:20:16,014
Then, I shall run away by myself.

261
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,954
I said to stop! Why don't you listen?

262
00:20:20,104 --> 00:20:22,324
Hey, wait up!

263
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:56,994
Why do you look at me like that?

264
00:21:05,524 --> 00:21:08,474
I think I smell a sweet scent.

265
00:21:08,474 --> 00:21:12,664
Why are you so clingy today?

266
00:21:12,664 --> 00:21:16,094
What... Me? What did I do?

267
00:21:33,044 --> 00:21:34,644
So Rang.

268
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:38,254
Tonight, I plan to...

269
00:21:42,924 --> 00:21:45,904
undress in this place.

270
00:21:53,824 --> 00:21:56,714
R-Right now?

271
00:21:58,534 --> 00:21:59,974
Why?

272
00:22:00,984 --> 00:22:02,824
Do you not want to?

273
00:22:03,944 --> 00:22:07,804
N-No... It's not that...

274
00:22:18,864 --> 00:22:20,514
T-Then...

275
00:22:22,294 --> 00:22:25,344
what happens to me, Sire?

276
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:30,754
Will I... become a concubine?

277
00:22:30,754 --> 00:22:34,764
I trusted you when you said you would leave the palace!

278
00:22:34,764 --> 00:22:39,884
As expected of an uneducated lot... Is that why you are changing your mind?

279
00:22:39,884 --> 00:22:42,970
No matter how you shake up the king's heart,

280
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:46,220
the queen selection process will go on as planned.

281
00:22:46,224 --> 00:22:49,434
I will see to it that someone else will become the queen of this nation.

282
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:53,014
I will allow you to stay as a court lady favored by his majesty.

283
00:22:53,014 --> 00:22:58,194
Whoever it may be, I must get a prince out of her.

284
00:22:59,104 --> 00:23:03,014
I do not... wish to do so.

285
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:04,134
- What did you say?

286
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:09,844
- I... am not even cut out to become a favored court lady.

287
00:23:09,844 --> 00:23:14,664
I am also not qualified to produce a prince for this nation.

288
00:23:14,664 --> 00:23:19,484
If that is the case, I will have to get you to promise me once more.

289
00:23:19,484 --> 00:23:25,764
That you will never become a hindrance to this nation's queen selection process.

290
00:23:28,044 --> 00:23:32,374
I will not... become anything at all.

291
00:23:32,374 --> 00:23:38,134
Do not worry. I will make you my queen no matter what.

292
00:23:38,134 --> 00:23:40,194
Your Majesty,

293
00:23:42,084 --> 00:23:44,614
do you even know my name?

294
00:23:51,084 --> 00:23:55,014
I do not know my name.

295
00:23:55,014 --> 00:23:59,304
The name "So Rang" was given to me while I was a wanderer.

296
00:24:00,414 --> 00:24:05,044
I do not even have a name given by my parents nor know of my birth.

297
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:08,154
How can I become a queen or a royal consort?

298
00:24:10,734 --> 00:24:15,574
Why do you not even try to come up with a way to stay with me? You said you're in love with me.

299
00:24:15,574 --> 00:24:17,354
You said you would not leave my side.

300
00:24:17,354 --> 00:24:21,934
Receiving a title ... was never in my plan.

301
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:27,274
Are you saying you love me yet do not wish to become my wife?

302
00:24:30,824 --> 00:24:32,474
Your Majesty,

303
00:24:33,094 --> 00:24:37,184
we are fine... just the way it is now.

304
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:40,754
This is not enough for me. I cannot hold back my feelings for you.

305
00:24:40,754 --> 00:24:43,794
Do you think I can hold myself back?

306
00:24:49,084 --> 00:24:54,204
Why not... think about this a little more, Your Majesty?

307
00:25:21,134 --> 00:25:23,634
You're here.

308
00:25:23,634 --> 00:25:28,574
Well... I have some artwork that I drew.

309
00:25:28,574 --> 00:25:30,644
Will you take a look?

310
00:25:30,644 --> 00:25:32,694
What is it?

311
00:25:32,694 --> 00:25:35,574
This isn't a place for this.

312
00:25:35,574 --> 00:25:37,114
May she be excused, please?

313
00:25:37,114 --> 00:25:39,674
Whoa...

314
00:25:50,074 --> 00:25:51,784
Come now.

315
00:25:53,504 --> 00:25:56,074
Is this the beginning of a relationship?

316
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:22,554
There lived... the biggest loser in the world.

317
00:26:22,554 --> 00:26:24,024
Pardon?

318
00:26:25,774 --> 00:26:28,264
He had never even touched a woman's hand.

319
00:26:28,264 --> 00:26:30,244
He has never even come close to a woman.

320
00:26:30,244 --> 00:26:32,084
A commonplace Born Sul Ro*
   (Single since birth, has never been in a love relationship)

321
00:26:32,084 --> 00:26:35,294
who was full of romantic ideas.

322
00:26:36,074 --> 00:26:39,374
There was a woman he liked.

323
00:26:39,374 --> 00:26:44,664
Do you think that Born Sur Ro idiot could even let that maiden know that

324
00:26:44,664 --> 00:26:48,164
he liked her at all?

325
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:54,114
He finally realized it on the day that maiden was put in danger.

326
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:57,494
That he could not live without this woman.

327
00:26:57,494 --> 00:27:01,274
Not long ago, a friend went to a distant place.

328
00:27:01,274 --> 00:27:04,544
He was a rival who also used to like that pretty maiden.

329
00:27:04,544 --> 00:27:07,224
But he died so helplessly.

330
00:27:07,224 --> 00:27:10,414
He just could not believe it, no matter how hard he thought about it.

331
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:15,984
That's when the idiot realized it.

332
00:27:15,984 --> 00:27:20,984
Even if the Marriage Ban Edict was in place, he should not hide his feelings.

333
00:27:20,984 --> 00:27:25,284
If he hid his feelings as he obeyed the government,

334
00:27:27,144 --> 00:27:30,564
he might lose that maiden forever.

335
00:27:35,534 --> 00:27:37,634
So...

336
00:27:37,634 --> 00:27:41,694
the idiot is about to confess his feelings to you.

337
00:27:46,784 --> 00:27:48,644
Maiden Hae Yeong,

338
00:27:50,274 --> 00:27:52,724
after the Marriage Ban Edict is lifted,

339
00:27:56,144 --> 00:27:58,744
will you marry me?

340
00:28:00,254 --> 00:28:02,514
Orabeoni Do Seok ...

341
00:28:12,974 --> 00:28:14,904
Could you stay?

342
00:28:14,904 --> 00:28:18,704
I have been thinking about this for a long time and have made up my mind.

343
00:28:19,904 --> 00:28:25,354
Chief Lee Sin Won is no longer here and with you gone...

344
00:28:25,354 --> 00:28:29,434
who would I trust and lean on in this palace?

345
00:28:29,434 --> 00:28:32,364
The king of this nation is your lover.

346
00:28:32,364 --> 00:28:35,824
What is a more joyful thing in this world?

347
00:28:38,534 --> 00:28:40,734
But I do not know.

348
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:48,084
For some reason, I feel like the end of this love will not be all that happy.

349
00:28:48,084 --> 00:28:50,694
Why do you think that?

350
00:28:50,694 --> 00:28:53,494
You must not know how strong the power of love is, do you?

351
00:28:53,494 --> 00:28:58,854
I mean, look at me at this age going outside to look for my husband.

352
00:28:58,854 --> 00:29:04,184
Love is not something you can overcome by having internal strife.

353
00:29:05,094 --> 00:29:08,780
The way my heart aches...

354
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:12,664
I do not know if it's the longing that I have experienced for so long

355
00:29:13,844 --> 00:29:17,744
or the heartbreak that comes from parting...

356
00:29:17,744 --> 00:29:20,864
I cannot even distinguish between the two.

357
00:29:20,864 --> 00:29:23,614
What can we do about this, huh?

358
00:29:33,244 --> 00:29:36,694
Here comes his majesty!

359
00:29:36,694 --> 00:29:39,364
Aigoo...

360
00:29:41,014 --> 00:29:43,104
Your Majesty.

361
00:29:48,424 --> 00:29:51,524
What brings you all the way here?

362
00:29:51,524 --> 00:29:55,604
Is it about that thing you asked about?

363
00:29:55,604 --> 00:29:59,914
No, it is not. I came to bid you farewell.

364
00:30:00,814 --> 00:30:03,424
I was grateful for everything you did for me all this time.

365
00:30:06,034 --> 00:30:11,704
To me, you are like my mother.

366
00:30:16,494 --> 00:30:18,374
Thanks to you,

367
00:30:20,324 --> 00:30:23,894
I was not lonely in this palace.

368
00:30:27,414 --> 00:30:29,154
May I...

369
00:30:29,154 --> 00:30:31,764
hold you in my embrace?

370
00:30:39,034 --> 00:30:41,194
Your Majesty...

371
00:30:50,784 --> 00:30:53,794
Goodbye, Court Lady Won.

372
00:31:15,984 --> 00:31:19,664
Your Majesty, Seon Hyeok and Hwal have arrived.

373
00:31:26,314 --> 00:31:28,894
What happened to Sin Won?

374
00:32:21,594 --> 00:32:23,574
Who are you?

375
00:32:33,264 --> 00:32:37,994
He asked us... not to ever look for him again.

376
00:33:13,404 --> 00:33:16,014
What brings you all the way here?

377
00:33:20,484 --> 00:33:22,774
How about a day drink?

378
00:33:26,854 --> 00:33:29,014
How did you know to come to this place?

379
00:33:29,014 --> 00:33:31,404
Old Man Gwaeng Yi sure is clairvoyant.

380
00:33:31,404 --> 00:33:34,774
"You will be able to see Chief Lee Sin Won right around this place."

381
00:33:34,774 --> 00:33:36,454
That's what he said.

382
00:33:36,454 --> 00:33:38,974
No need to address me as "chief" any longer.

383
00:33:38,974 --> 00:33:40,834
I stepped down from the position.

384
00:33:40,834 --> 00:33:42,564
Then...

385
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:43,754
Hyeong?

386
00:33:43,754 --> 00:33:46,594
Do not joke around. Am I older than you?

387
00:33:46,594 --> 00:33:48,534
Were you not born in the Year of the Tiger?

388
00:33:48,534 --> 00:33:50,714
I was born in the Year of the Dragon.*
  (Two years younger than Sin Won)

389
00:33:52,584 --> 00:33:55,284
Born in the Year of the Dragon...

390
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:57,764
You're the same age as Chun Seok.

391
00:34:03,994 --> 00:34:06,664
Please speak down to me, Hyeong.

392
00:34:15,324 --> 00:34:17,734
Is something the matter?

393
00:34:18,734 --> 00:34:24,074
I... confessed my feelings of love... to Maiden Hae Yeong.

394
00:34:24,074 --> 00:34:27,854
Orabeoni Do Seok, I ...

395
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:34,144
don't know what... love is yet.

396
00:34:35,414 --> 00:34:38,304
You're doing this all of a sudden.

397
00:34:38,304 --> 00:34:41,144
It feels strange and awkward.

398
00:34:41,144 --> 00:34:43,524
I feel pressured, too.

399
00:34:54,934 --> 00:34:57,834
 By the way, Hyeong.

400
00:34:58,494 --> 00:35:02,014
Can I forget everything just because I tried?

401
00:35:04,994 --> 00:35:06,924
The feelings are...

402
00:35:07,954 --> 00:35:10,584
just like my right hand.

403
00:35:10,584 --> 00:35:13,180
It's always been a part of my body,

404
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:17,750
but I can't even control it nor train it.

405
00:35:17,754 --> 00:35:21,204
Can you not use that arm anymore, then?

406
00:35:21,924 --> 00:35:26,434
There's an extremely slim chance, but...

407
00:35:32,934 --> 00:35:36,134
Isn't it better not to nurture any hope?

408
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,434
What will you do then, Hyeong?

409
00:35:40,044 --> 00:35:42,514
The arm doesn't hurt.

410
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,824
It hurts inside.

411
00:35:47,204 --> 00:35:50,784
Perhaps... it's because there's hope inside.

412
00:35:50,784 --> 00:35:54,594
If you gave up completely, it wouldn't hurt, either.

413
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:01,214
If I felt better in the mountains,

414
00:36:01,214 --> 00:36:04,684
I was thinking of staying, too.

415
00:36:16,694 --> 00:36:20,454
Your Majesty, do you have a moment?

416
00:36:22,944 --> 00:36:26,834
There's something I'd like to show you right now.

417
00:36:33,864 --> 00:36:35,534
What is this?

418
00:36:35,534 --> 00:36:38,394
It's for the two of you who just got together.

419
00:36:38,394 --> 00:36:41,614
It's my modest gift.

420
00:36:43,074 --> 00:36:46,694
Anything that would happen in this place

421
00:36:46,694 --> 00:36:49,384
would be a secret.

422
00:36:52,104 --> 00:36:55,304
Well, this is outdoors, isn't it?

423
00:36:55,304 --> 00:36:56,754
What do you mean, "outdoors"?

424
00:36:56,754 --> 00:36:59,644
It's quite cozy once you go inside.

425
00:36:59,644 --> 00:37:04,314
I've asked around, and... since So Rang was a vagrant before,

426
00:37:04,314 --> 00:37:06,224
she likes to sleep outside, apparently.

427
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,694
Well, that's not the same...

428
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:11,444
- as this.
 - Isn't it, though?

429
00:37:11,444 --> 00:37:13,344
Try trusting it this time, too.

430
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:15,074
Your Majesty's...

431
00:37:16,004 --> 00:37:17,814
bag of tricks.

432
00:38:40,304 --> 00:38:44,454
I guess his majesty stopped by.

433
00:39:07,884 --> 00:39:09,774
So Rang.

434
00:39:11,914 --> 00:39:15,954
Well, yes. So, please step out for a moment.

435
00:39:23,544 --> 00:39:27,044
Why didn't you rest longer?

436
00:39:27,044 --> 00:39:28,614
Well...

437
00:39:30,884 --> 00:39:33,514
Your Majesty!

438
00:39:34,374 --> 00:39:37,294
When did you leave those flowers?

439
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:40,444
Well... I-I thought...

440
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:42,474
you might be woken up.

441
00:39:43,744 --> 00:39:46,534
Did you miss me already?

442
00:39:46,534 --> 00:39:48,694
Yes.

443
00:39:48,694 --> 00:39:52,004
Did you make that bouquet yourself?

444
00:39:52,004 --> 00:39:53,694
Well...

445
00:39:54,384 --> 00:39:56,044
Forget it. That's enough.

446
00:39:56,044 --> 00:39:57,214
Why?

447
00:39:57,214 --> 00:39:59,804
Can't I do this to my lover?

448
00:40:03,194 --> 00:40:06,334
Oh, wait... Um...

449
00:40:06,334 --> 00:40:09,284
I have a lot of things to do. Let's meet in the evening.

450
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:11,264
In the evening. Well...

451
00:40:13,764 --> 00:40:16,164
Well, over here!

452
00:40:20,814 --> 00:40:22,714
This way, this way.

453
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:24,884
Here, here!

454
00:40:33,314 --> 00:40:36,644
His majesty sent you to keep the promise, didn't he?

455
00:40:36,644 --> 00:40:38,584
However...

456
00:40:38,584 --> 00:40:42,504
I can't arrange a blind introduction meeting at this rate.

457
00:40:42,504 --> 00:40:45,254
- Why not?
 - I think you know.

458
00:40:45,254 --> 00:40:47,034
- Do you not like how we look?
 - No.

459
00:40:47,034 --> 00:40:50,194
- Don't hurt me like that.  Do you mean it? 
- Yes.

460
00:40:50,194 --> 00:40:52,424
I believe you since you sound so firm.

461
00:40:52,424 --> 00:40:53,694
Oh, well...

462
00:40:53,694 --> 00:40:56,664
If you went to the blind introduction meeting looking like that,

463
00:40:56,664 --> 00:41:00,344
you'd either get waterboarded or slapped.

464
00:41:02,324 --> 00:41:04,854
Our faces are the culprits, right?

465
00:41:05,554 --> 00:41:08,924
But... you know who I am.

466
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:12,634
I was the head court lady of the Joseon dynasty until yesterday.

467
00:41:12,634 --> 00:41:17,034
I'm good at cleaning and polishing anything up.

468
00:41:17,094 --> 00:41:19,894
Nunim!

469
00:41:20,664 --> 00:41:24,024
However, there's one condition.

470
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:25,724
What is it?

471
00:41:25,724 --> 00:41:27,514
I'm looking for a man.

472
00:41:27,514 --> 00:41:29,444
His name is Hwang Dong Sik.

473
00:41:29,444 --> 00:41:34,324
He's my husband from whom I parted 25 years ago.

474
00:42:19,034 --> 00:42:21,444
It's all right.

475
00:42:21,444 --> 00:42:24,254
It's all fine now that you have returned.

476
00:42:34,874 --> 00:42:38,854
I put everything from the palace here.

477
00:42:39,834 --> 00:42:43,444
Young Master, you worked so hard and lived

478
00:42:43,444 --> 00:42:45,884
so diligently to get to that place.

479
00:42:45,884 --> 00:42:49,324
Can't believe that happened to my gentle young master.

480
00:42:52,374 --> 00:42:56,604
I put it up here because it seemed like a valuable book.

481
00:43:06,574 --> 00:43:09,964
Why is his majesty acting like that all of a sudden?

482
00:43:26,024 --> 00:43:29,594
I can't believe I gave something like this to his majesty.

483
00:43:29,594 --> 00:43:32,294
I was so immature.

484
00:43:42,014 --> 00:43:43,924
You were...

485
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:57,054
You were busy. I thought you were just a baby.

486
00:43:57,054 --> 00:43:59,784
- It's not like that.
 - Aigoo, silly me.

487
00:43:59,784 --> 00:44:01,854
I forgot to feed the dog.

488
00:44:01,854 --> 00:44:05,364
Well, I said it's not like that!

489
00:44:25,884 --> 00:44:28,624
This doesn't look like mine.

490
00:44:39,534 --> 00:44:42,874
 April 5, 1858, Year of the Horse, To the Lee Family of Gyeongju

491
00:45:00,924 --> 00:45:04,564
Why am I being called here today?

492
00:45:19,374 --> 00:45:21,744
What's all this?

493
00:45:22,904 --> 00:45:24,044
Well...

494
00:45:24,044 --> 00:45:25,964
We can...

495
00:45:25,964 --> 00:45:29,174
eat meat outside, sit in front of the fire,

496
00:45:29,174 --> 00:45:31,304
and while enjoying the outdoor scenery,

497
00:45:31,304 --> 00:45:35,554
we can have fun drinking, too.

498
00:45:35,554 --> 00:45:37,884
You wanted to drink outside?

499
00:45:37,884 --> 00:45:40,734
We can drink in there.

500
00:45:41,544 --> 00:45:44,604
I see. Let's start with drinking, then!

501
00:46:06,684 --> 00:46:09,474
Why is that here, by the way?

502
00:46:09,474 --> 00:46:15,084
So you can lean or lie down if you get tired while drinking.

503
00:46:15,084 --> 00:46:16,774
What?

504
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:19,144
That's amazing!

505
00:46:19,724 --> 00:46:22,544
Why couldn't I think of that before?

506
00:46:22,544 --> 00:46:25,734
Should we go ahead and start drinking, then?

507
00:46:25,734 --> 00:46:26,904
All right.

508
00:46:26,904 --> 00:46:28,684
Shall we?

509
00:46:43,764 --> 00:46:45,514
You must've been really surprised then.

510
00:46:45,514 --> 00:46:49,184
When I brought you that book saying it's literature...

511
00:46:53,524 --> 00:46:55,644
Why bring that up now?

512
00:46:55,644 --> 00:46:57,784
I was tidying up the Gangnyeongjeon,
  (Official residence of the king)

513
00:46:57,784 --> 00:46:58,914
and found that book.

514
00:46:58,914 --> 00:47:02,204
Even when I look at it now...

515
00:47:05,774 --> 00:47:11,564
I was so immature, wasn't I? I dared to give a book like that to the head of the country.

516
00:47:11,564 --> 00:47:15,144
You talk as if you're mature now.

517
00:47:15,144 --> 00:47:19,094
But I was more surprised the other time.

518
00:47:29,994 --> 00:47:32,834
You were so pretty then.

519
00:47:33,754 --> 00:47:38,464
When I twirled like this?

520
00:47:57,464 --> 00:47:59,834
Did I tell you?

521
00:47:59,834 --> 00:48:03,064
That everything that happens here will be a secret.

522
00:48:03,064 --> 00:48:04,594
Even if we drink,

523
00:48:04,594 --> 00:48:08,464
make a mess, dance, or

524
00:48:10,164 --> 00:48:13,074
something shameful happens.

525
00:48:27,564 --> 00:48:32,584
You said everything that happens in here is a secret.

526
00:48:35,354 --> 00:48:37,114
Don't do it.

527
00:48:40,394 --> 00:48:42,274
Can't I?

528
00:48:43,574 --> 00:48:47,574
Don't do it. You should experience it, too.

529
00:48:49,174 --> 00:48:51,444
I can't hold it in.

530
00:48:52,504 --> 00:48:55,004
But you told me to.

531
00:48:57,564 --> 00:49:00,824
This is a tough thing to do.

532
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:25,900
♫  I think only about you all day.   ♫

533
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:36,160
♫  Because I wonder if you know how I feel,   ♫

534
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:45,900
♫  Because I long for you, because I always want to see you.  ♫

535
00:49:47,894 --> 00:49:54,124
♫  If I'm not with you for even a day,  ♫

536
00:49:54,124 --> 00:50:01,100
♫  I cannot do anything  ♫

537
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:14,100
♫  Although I'm doing my best again to pretend to be calm and to pretend to be fine  ♫

538
00:50:15,474 --> 00:50:20,850
♫  By any chance, can you hear me?  ♫

539
00:50:22,204 --> 00:50:29,234
♫  Do you feel the same way?  ♫

540
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:35,634
♫  My small wish reaches that sky  ♫

541
00:50:35,634 --> 00:50:46,434
♫  I hope you can approach me a step at a time  ♫

542
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:01,600
 April 5, 1858, Year of the Horse, To the Lee Family of Gyeongju

543
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:18,290
 Ye Hyeon Seon

544
00:51:25,924 --> 00:51:29,534
 Did she know that she was to be married to me?

545
00:51:29,534 --> 00:51:31,364
 Is your name Chief Lee Sin Won?

546
00:51:31,364 --> 00:51:33,374
 The willow tree family's firstborn son?

547
00:51:33,374 --> 00:51:36,174
 Then, before the Marriage Ban Edict was issued, what did you do?

548
00:51:36,174 --> 00:51:37,794
 What?

549
00:51:39,234 --> 00:51:40,604
 I was a beggar.

550
00:51:40,604 --> 00:51:42,324
 Ye Hyeon Seon.

551
00:51:44,584 --> 00:51:49,294
 You knew it was me, but you pretended not to know?

552
00:51:59,354 --> 00:52:00,714
Old Man!

553
00:52:00,714 --> 00:52:03,414
Old Man! Old Man!

554
00:52:04,134 --> 00:52:06,024
Old Man!

555
00:52:07,044 --> 00:52:08,654
Old Man!

556
00:52:08,654 --> 00:52:09,724
What's going on?

557
00:52:09,724 --> 00:52:11,564
Chief!

558
00:52:11,564 --> 00:52:15,364
He suddenly started boiling with a fever and got sick.

559
00:52:17,494 --> 00:52:20,284
Elder, are you all right?

560
00:52:23,434 --> 00:52:25,434
Because he's an old man,

561
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:28,464
you don't know what will happen and when.

562
00:52:29,194 --> 00:52:33,554
I think his family should come.

563
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:38,254
If so...

564
00:52:39,404 --> 00:52:43,004
I think I should call Eonni So Rang.

565
00:53:14,594 --> 00:53:16,294
You were here.

566
00:53:16,294 --> 00:53:19,554
I had no idea where you were. So I looked for you everywhere.

567
00:53:19,554 --> 00:53:20,594
What's this about?

568
00:53:20,594 --> 00:53:24,024
You got a letter from outside the palace.

569
00:53:27,684 --> 00:53:31,274
 Eonni,  the Old Man is dying. Please come quickly.

570
00:53:58,174 --> 00:54:00,494
How come you're not sleeping?

571
00:54:04,654 --> 00:54:10,174
I talked to the Chief Royal Secretary a lot earlier today.

572
00:54:10,174 --> 00:54:14,074
If your status and name are the issues, he suggested

573
00:54:14,074 --> 00:54:17,214
getting you adopted by a good family.

574
00:54:19,444 --> 00:54:23,914
I thought about this a lot. Please don't turn this down, too.

575
00:54:30,054 --> 00:54:31,784
Your Majesty.

576
00:54:33,974 --> 00:54:38,164
I think I need to go home.

577
00:54:44,794 --> 00:54:46,934
 I need to confirm.

578
00:54:57,424 --> 00:54:59,984
What brings you all the way here?

579
00:54:59,984 --> 00:55:02,164
Tell your mistress.

580
00:55:02,164 --> 00:55:05,094
That the man who almost became her son-in-law is here.

581
00:55:06,124 --> 00:55:08,624
How dare he come here?

582
00:55:08,624 --> 00:55:11,124
Bring out all the weapons in storage.

583
00:55:11,124 --> 00:55:14,234
We'll use force if necessary.

584
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:19,274
Right, give snowbell resin to His Excellency.

585
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:21,304
It might get noisy.

586
00:55:21,304 --> 00:55:23,264
It'd be better if he slept.

587
00:55:23,264 --> 00:55:25,244
Yes, My Lady.

588
00:55:50,334 --> 00:55:52,344
You came to see me?

589
00:55:52,344 --> 00:55:54,434
You almost became my mother-in-law.

590
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:57,044
There is no reason I could not come to see you.

591
00:55:57,974 --> 00:56:03,904
You think I still want you as Hyeon Seon's husband?

592
00:56:04,764 --> 00:56:08,664
Do you still call your younger daughter "Hyeon Seon"?

593
00:56:08,664 --> 00:56:11,244
Be careful what you say!

594
00:56:18,044 --> 00:56:20,594
There's the real Ye Hyeon Seon out there.

595
00:56:20,594 --> 00:56:24,014
How dare you say something crazy like that without proof?

596
00:56:24,014 --> 00:56:26,094
I was the Chief of the Royal Investigation Bureau.

597
00:56:26,094 --> 00:56:28,954
You think I came here without proof?

598
00:56:44,024 --> 00:56:48,130
 Ye Hyeon Seon

599
00:56:51,484 --> 00:56:52,944
How dare you bring up this nonsense?

600
00:56:52,944 --> 00:56:54,594
You people...

601
00:56:54,594 --> 00:56:59,094
conspired with the kidnappers to commit treason like this!

602
00:57:00,124 --> 00:57:02,144
Treason?

603
00:57:02,144 --> 00:57:05,514
I'm not the traitor of this country.

604
00:57:05,514 --> 00:57:08,564
That wench who dared to fool the king of Joseon.

605
00:57:08,564 --> 00:57:11,114
It's that bitch So Rang.

606
00:57:11,914 --> 00:57:13,794
If I uttered a word,

607
00:57:13,794 --> 00:57:16,684
she will get beheaded as soon as tomorrow.

608
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:18,864
Do not speak carelessly.

609
00:57:18,864 --> 00:57:20,524
Did you not know?

610
00:57:20,524 --> 00:57:26,134
That wench does not have any ability to channel spirits at all.

611
00:57:26,764 --> 00:57:28,714
Go ask her yourself.

612
00:57:28,714 --> 00:57:31,854
About when and how she got her spiritual power.

613
00:57:31,854 --> 00:57:37,194
Did you not know that anything that comes out of her mouth is a lie?

614
00:57:37,194 --> 00:57:42,444
If you want her to die, go ahead and blabber your mouth.

615
00:57:42,444 --> 00:57:47,274
Tell them that bitch So Rang is the real Ye Hyeon Seon.

616
00:58:00,384 --> 00:58:03,504
What did he say? Did he threaten you?

617
00:58:03,504 --> 00:58:08,324
So, we should've reported her as a swindler earlier.

618
00:58:08,324 --> 00:58:10,934
It'd be a problem if the investigation took longer.

619
00:58:10,934 --> 00:58:12,714
They might mention us, too.

620
00:58:12,714 --> 00:58:15,264
Will you let him go like this?

621
00:58:15,264 --> 00:58:17,784
He cannot even use one of his arms.

622
00:58:17,784 --> 00:58:20,604
Could he even do anything?

623
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:44,494
Even though I'm not around, please eat well and sleep well, too.

624
00:58:53,764 --> 00:58:56,254
They will be protecting you.

625
00:58:56,254 --> 00:58:58,184
You do not have to do this.

626
00:58:58,184 --> 00:59:01,574
I think I can rest assured only if I do this.

627
00:59:04,524 --> 00:59:07,614
Thank you in advance, then.

628
00:59:11,144 --> 00:59:13,254
I'll be right back.

629
00:59:49,254 --> 00:59:52,924
My gosh, Old Man, look at yourself.

630
00:59:52,924 --> 00:59:56,344
You're like a dried persimmon.

631
00:59:59,394 --> 01:00:01,314
Your Highness the queen.

632
01:00:01,314 --> 01:00:05,754
What brings you to this humble place?

633
01:00:05,754 --> 01:00:08,984
Please return to the palace.

634
01:00:08,984 --> 01:00:10,704
What's wrong with him?

635
01:00:10,704 --> 01:00:13,124
He's been saying nonsense since a few days ago.

636
01:00:13,124 --> 01:00:18,064
Your Highness, you can't be out right now.

637
01:00:19,804 --> 01:00:20,934
Seriously...

638
01:00:20,934 --> 01:00:23,474
He's doing that because he has a high fever.

639
01:00:23,474 --> 01:00:25,784
He'd be in critical condition a few more times.

640
01:00:25,784 --> 01:00:28,824
He needs to turn those corners well.

641
01:00:31,864 --> 01:00:33,644
Aren't you short on medicine ingredients?

642
01:00:33,644 --> 01:00:36,064
Haven't you seen them?

643
01:00:42,384 --> 01:00:46,254
How did you afford all these ingredients?

644
01:00:47,164 --> 01:00:49,354
The thing is...

645
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,344
So...

646
01:00:52,124 --> 01:00:56,544
Sin Won was here, wasn't he?

647
01:00:56,544 --> 01:00:59,074
How's his condition?

648
01:01:23,144 --> 01:01:25,214
Here, Old Man.

649
01:01:29,524 --> 01:01:31,774
That's right.

650
01:01:40,114 --> 01:01:44,814
 Your Majesty, I think it might take longer.

651
01:01:45,504 --> 01:01:51,044
 The physician says Old Man Gwaeng Yi is not doing well at all.

652
01:01:51,044 --> 01:01:53,114
 He cannot figure out the cause,

653
01:01:53,114 --> 01:01:56,904
 but he says it's critical that he rests.

654
01:01:56,904 --> 01:02:00,284
 I'll come to meet you as soon as he gets better.

655
01:02:00,284 --> 01:02:04,884
 So please don't worry and be well.

656
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:02,934
Sin Won.

657
01:03:08,804 --> 01:03:11,774
Your arm...

658
01:03:12,824 --> 01:03:15,234
It just ended up like this.

659
01:03:16,384 --> 01:03:17,964
You should've told me.

660
01:03:17,964 --> 01:03:20,684
It's not your fault, So Rang.

661
01:03:27,254 --> 01:03:29,794
How have you been?

662
01:03:38,904 --> 01:03:45,574
I became his majesty's woman.

663
01:03:50,314 --> 01:03:52,264
I see.

664
01:03:52,884 --> 01:03:54,524
You must've been given a title, then.

665
01:03:54,524 --> 01:03:56,864
But I haven't heard about that.

666
01:03:58,284 --> 01:04:03,064
It's because we decided to keep everything a secret.

667
01:04:03,684 --> 01:04:05,364
What?

668
01:04:06,764 --> 01:04:12,114
You know, that I'm not qualified to become a royal concubine.

669
01:04:17,774 --> 01:04:19,784
So Rang.

670
01:04:21,704 --> 01:04:24,184
Why have you been hiding it?

671
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:27,134
Why did you play ignorant?

672
01:04:28,994 --> 01:04:31,854
That you're Ye Hyeon Seon.

673
01:04:33,304 --> 01:04:39,134
I have been looking for you for seven years.

674
01:04:43,814 --> 01:04:51,484
I tried to forget myself for seven years.

675
01:04:52,524 --> 01:04:57,234
Otherwise it'd be too unfair and hard.

676
01:04:57,834 --> 01:05:02,174
Why did I have to get everything taken away from me?

677
01:05:02,174 --> 01:05:07,320
If I keep thinking about that, it'd be too awful.

678
01:05:07,964 --> 01:05:12,114
You might've lost your bride,

679
01:05:12,884 --> 01:05:19,024
but I lost everything.

680
01:05:19,734 --> 01:05:22,174
My family,

681
01:05:22,174 --> 01:05:24,354
my name,

682
01:05:24,354 --> 01:05:26,954
and my whole being, too.

683
01:05:30,694 --> 01:05:34,764
I couldn't acknowledge it because I'm not Ye Hyeon Seon.

684
01:05:35,964 --> 01:05:40,974
Ye Hyeon Seon already died then.

685
01:05:45,164 --> 01:05:51,504
If you talk like that, I won't be able to believe that it was all a lie.

686
01:05:52,704 --> 01:05:55,074
I heard about everything.

687
01:05:55,074 --> 01:05:57,874
That you don't have spiritual power.

688
01:05:59,284 --> 01:06:01,604
Was that all a lie, too?

689
01:06:01,604 --> 01:06:07,224
That you could channel the spirit of the dead crown princess?

690
01:06:09,474 --> 01:06:11,304
What did you...

691
01:06:16,604 --> 01:06:18,994
just say?

692
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:34,310
All of that ...

693
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:39,190
was a lie?

694
01:06:41,744 --> 01:06:45,564
Since when and up to what point did you lie, exactly?

695
01:06:47,064 --> 01:06:48,614
Your Majesty...

696
01:06:48,614 --> 01:06:50,544
So Rang,

697
01:06:53,494 --> 01:06:56,544
you cannot return to the palace anymore.

698
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:32,260

699
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:37,450
♫  On this night, when even the moon is asleep  ♫

700
01:07:38,774 --> 01:07:45,010
♫  Where are you going in such a rush?  ♫

701
01:07:46,064 --> 01:07:48,684
 The Forbidden Marriage

702
01:07:48,684 --> 01:07:51,514
 We select the best maiden of Joseon here and now.

703
01:07:51,514 --> 01:07:55,344
 Even for this queen selection, will they let the royal family choose whom they want?

704
01:07:55,344 --> 01:07:57,404
 Ye Hyeon Seon, the eldest daughter of the Minister of Personnel Affairs.

705
01:07:57,404 --> 01:08:00,734
 Apparently, she's the most likely to become the queen.

706
01:08:00,734 --> 01:08:04,334
 How could you not know that everyone but you was bought off, Your Highness?

707
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:08,554
 What if I'm not wrong?

708
01:08:08,554 --> 01:08:11,764
 We need another option just in case.

709
01:08:11,764 --> 01:08:13,714
 I have only been running away all this time.

710
01:08:13,714 --> 01:08:15,084
 I cannot do that any longer.

711
01:08:15,084 --> 01:08:19,504
 I'm the real Ye Hyeon Seon.

712
01:08:19,504 --> 01:08:22,234
♫  I still...  ♫
