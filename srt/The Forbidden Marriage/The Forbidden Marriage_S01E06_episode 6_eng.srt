3
00:01:05,884 --> 00:01:07,714
Crown Princess!

4
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,000
Stay right there, Crown Princess! I will go to you.

5
00:01:12,064 --> 00:01:13,984
Your Majesty!

6
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,704
Your Majesty!

7
00:01:18,444 --> 00:01:20,174
Crown Princess...

8
00:01:21,634 --> 00:01:23,834
Crown Princess.

9
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,714
Crown Princess!

10
00:01:26,804 --> 00:01:29,034
Did you not see her with your own eyes as well?

11
00:01:29,034 --> 00:01:31,054
Yes, we saw her!

12
00:01:31,054 --> 00:01:32,644
It was really the Crown Princess, right?

13
00:01:32,644 --> 00:01:34,734
Yes, it was really Her Highness.

14
00:01:34,734 --> 00:01:37,974
Then what exactly is going on here?

15
00:01:45,154 --> 00:01:47,574
Your Majesty!

16
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,174
Your Majesty!

17
00:01:49,174 --> 00:01:50,074
Crown Princess...

18
00:01:50,074 --> 00:01:51,734
Your Majesty... Your Majesty!

19
00:01:51,734 --> 00:01:52,544
Crown Princess...

20
00:01:52,544 --> 00:01:54,944
- Your Majesty...
 - Just you wait there. I will go to you.

21
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,664
Please, Your Majesty!

22
00:01:56,664 --> 00:01:58,954
Look at me...

23
00:01:58,954 --> 00:02:01,534
Look at me, please?

24
00:02:22,854 --> 00:02:25,524
Do not be in pain.

25
00:02:26,974 --> 00:02:31,924
That woman is not the Crown Princess.

26
00:02:32,604 --> 00:02:33,764
No...

27
00:02:33,764 --> 00:02:36,214
- No, I am sure she isâ€”
 - We...

28
00:02:36,214 --> 00:02:39,784
just came back from looking for corroborative evidence.

29
00:02:40,454 --> 00:02:42,244
What did you say?

30
00:02:48,854 --> 00:02:52,524
Your Majesty, it is I, Kim Chan Man.

31
00:02:52,524 --> 00:02:55,454
Do you remember me?

32
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:00,074
I do remember you.

33
00:04:02,184 --> 00:04:05,024
Why have you come to the palace?

34
00:04:08,954 --> 00:04:13,604
Is this not the ceremonial dress that I especially gifted Lord Ahn Ji Hyeong?

35
00:04:13,604 --> 00:04:17,834
However, this is not the real one.

36
00:04:18,434 --> 00:04:20,224
What did you say?

37
00:04:28,684 --> 00:04:31,944
For a real ceremonial dress, we use gold thread,

38
00:04:31,944 --> 00:04:35,614
but is not this one embroidered with silver thread?

39
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:41,084
Then, where is the real one?

40
00:04:41,084 --> 00:04:46,584
The ceremonial dress that the woman in the pond was wearing had gold thread.

41
00:04:46,584 --> 00:04:48,454
 Someone is trying to shake up the heart of the king,

42
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,434
 by stealing the real ceremonial dress and doing this,

43
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:53,924
 having put a fake dress inside the crown princess's keepsake box,

44
00:04:53,924 --> 00:04:56,674
in order to throw off any investigations.

45
00:04:59,434 --> 00:05:03,124
Your Majesty, if that woman were truly a ghost or a vengeful spirit,

46
00:05:03,124 --> 00:05:07,284
why would she be wearing a stolen ceremonial dress?

47
00:05:11,124 --> 00:05:14,554
Who is responsible for this!

48
00:05:47,544 --> 00:05:50,734
 What if his majesty cannot forget

49
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:54,784
 the crown princess for the rest of his life?

50
00:05:54,784 --> 00:05:58,904
 Just as one cannot chase a rain fog with human strength,

51
00:05:58,904 --> 00:06:05,234
 what if it is impossible for me to help him forget her highness?

52
00:06:15,684 --> 00:06:16,834
Why are we back here?

53
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,304
 Episode 6  
 It is too early to give up.

54
00:06:19,304 --> 00:06:22,774
I will try to get rid of the fog with human strength.

55
00:06:22,774 --> 00:06:24,474
What?

56
00:06:26,364 --> 00:06:29,664
Sin Won, the last time I saw you, you seemed pretty good at swimming.

57
00:06:29,664 --> 00:06:31,594
W-W-What now?

58
00:06:31,594 --> 00:06:34,674
You said that there was a splash and heard something falling into the water.

59
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:36,784
What could that be?

60
00:06:36,784 --> 00:06:41,154
Do you not think we would have to go in the water to find that out?

61
00:06:46,734 --> 00:06:48,384
Oh, you are joking, right?

62
00:06:48,384 --> 00:06:49,844
Do I look like someone who would joke around?

63
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:51,834
I mean, you are a bit bizarre.

64
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:53,754
Oh, my gosh, it is a water deer!

65
00:06:53,754 --> 00:06:56,884
Why would there be a water deer in the palace?

66
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,674
Here is the water deer, you fool!

67
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,214
I thought you said we were friends!

68
00:07:06,214 --> 00:07:07,884
Friendship is not a joke!

69
00:07:07,884 --> 00:07:09,974
Hurry up! Hurry up and do some searching.

70
00:07:09,974 --> 00:07:11,084
Oh, really!

71
00:07:11,084 --> 00:07:13,794
Hey, take this.

72
00:07:14,974 --> 00:07:17,254
Hurry up and search!

73
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,094
Why is he taking so long to come up?

74
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:42,094
Is he dead?

75
00:07:52,684 --> 00:07:54,614
What is this?

76
00:07:57,024 --> 00:08:00,034
It is a mirror with a height of a human being.

77
00:08:02,764 --> 00:08:04,674
Someone set up a mirror

78
00:08:04,674 --> 00:08:09,044
in order to produce the effect of the woman disappearing like smoke?

79
00:08:09,044 --> 00:08:10,714
Yes.

80
00:08:10,714 --> 00:08:13,364
While holding on to this rope,

81
00:08:13,364 --> 00:08:18,264
when she lets go of it, it would make a splash.

82
00:08:18,994 --> 00:08:20,544
It was this, I see...

83
00:08:20,544 --> 00:08:24,074
I see why the appearances were all near water,

84
00:08:24,074 --> 00:08:26,894
such as a pond, a laundry place, and a well near the temple.

85
00:08:27,694 --> 00:08:29,444
And that is why I am in such a rush.

86
00:08:29,444 --> 00:08:30,224
Why?

87
00:08:30,224 --> 00:08:32,874
If that woman really did not disappear like smoke,

88
00:08:32,874 --> 00:08:35,904
then there is a high chance that she was not able to escape the palace yet.

89
00:08:35,904 --> 00:08:36,994
What?

90
00:08:36,994 --> 00:08:40,894
Now, it is time for you, Head Eunuch and Head Court Lady,

91
00:08:40,894 --> 00:08:43,664
to step in.

92
00:08:44,814 --> 00:08:45,674
Yes.

93
00:08:45,674 --> 00:08:49,664
As a woman, the easiest way to hide her identity would be as a court lady,

94
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:50,864
just like me.

95
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,874
Since there are court ladies who enter and leave the palace,

96
00:08:52,874 --> 00:08:56,024
it would be easiest for her to escape by hiding in their midst.

97
00:08:56,024 --> 00:09:00,244
We should first shut down all the gates of the palace, and then check every court lady in the palace.

98
00:09:00,244 --> 00:09:03,654
Head Court Lady Won, you pretty much know all the faces of the court ladies.

99
00:09:03,654 --> 00:09:06,474
Especially if someone has the face of that woman we saw yesterday,

100
00:09:06,474 --> 00:09:08,794
you would remember it even more clearly.

101
00:09:08,794 --> 00:09:10,364
I will search for that woman.

102
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,600
- I will tell them to reinforce the security in the palace. 
 - Yes.

103
00:09:17,804 --> 00:09:19,184
Then, as for me,

104
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,394
I will tell the other members of the Royal Investigation Bureau

105
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:24,314
to increase their investigation into areas where she might be hiding.

106
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,034
 Yes.

107
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,884
Take me with you.

108
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:35,394
No.

109
00:09:35,394 --> 00:09:37,364
You stay with me in your quarters.

110
00:09:37,364 --> 00:09:38,934
Why, all of a sudden?

111
00:09:38,934 --> 00:09:42,994
Would it not be better to have at least one more person searching?

112
00:09:42,994 --> 00:09:46,594
I told you. The palace is dangerous.

113
00:10:03,724 --> 00:10:05,414
What did you say?

114
00:10:05,414 --> 00:10:08,004
The late crown princess appeared in the palace?

115
00:10:08,004 --> 00:10:11,264
However, she was supposedly wearing a stolen ceremonial dress.

116
00:10:11,264 --> 00:10:15,254
And so it is of popular opinion that she was not a ghost.

117
00:10:15,254 --> 00:10:18,794
Thus, since she may be hiding among the court ladies,

118
00:10:18,794 --> 00:10:22,264
they are carrying out a full investigation.

119
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:26,804
When was the memorial day for the late crown princess again?

120
00:10:26,804 --> 00:10:29,034
It is today.

121
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:35,464
If someone were to die in the palace this time as well,

122
00:10:35,464 --> 00:10:36,954
whatever shall we do?

123
00:10:36,954 --> 00:10:40,304
Even though the heart of the king may be strong,

124
00:10:40,304 --> 00:10:43,054
it would cause it to collapse.

125
00:10:43,054 --> 00:10:45,674
Do you know of a solution to prevent this?

126
00:10:45,674 --> 00:10:50,224
How could a mere woman like me know such a solution?

127
00:10:50,224 --> 00:10:52,284
However,

128
00:10:53,504 --> 00:10:57,414
I was told that there would be no more terrible deaths

129
00:10:57,414 --> 00:10:59,194
if reinforcements came in

130
00:10:59,194 --> 00:11:04,444
to completely change the energy of the insidious palace.

131
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:29,034
A full investigation of the court ladies...

132
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,284
That girl is heading toward her own grave.

133
00:11:41,374 --> 00:11:42,284
 Name

134
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:06,864
I came after hearing the news briefly. We are trying to find a suspicious court lady, right?

135
00:12:06,864 --> 00:12:10,184
Yes. We must find her by today.

136
00:12:10,184 --> 00:12:14,544
This incident most likely involves someone of high status in the palace.

137
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:18,274
Otherwise, how could she dare to enter the palace like this?

138
00:12:18,274 --> 00:12:19,614
That is quite plausible.

139
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:24,104
From now on, the investigation will be handled directly by the royal guards.

140
00:12:24,104 --> 00:12:27,234
Please tell the Royal Investigation Bureau to step away from this investigation.

141
00:12:27,234 --> 00:12:30,684
Will not there be more confusion if the investigation is divided among two groups?

142
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:34,684
- Howeverâ€”
 - We will make sure to carry out a thorough investigation

143
00:12:34,684 --> 00:12:38,534
so that the court lady who is hiding her identity will not be able to hide behind superiors.

144
00:12:38,534 --> 00:12:42,744
I will tell the Royal Investigation Bureau myself.

145
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,354
Why are you telling me to just stay here?

146
00:12:49,354 --> 00:12:52,894
Do you want to go around when the overall atmosphere is chaotic?

147
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,844
Chief, the Royal Guards are telling all of the Royal Investigation Bureau agents to step away.

148
00:13:05,844 --> 00:13:08,254
There are not enough people working on the investigation as is... Why so suddenly?

149
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,944
I do not know the exact details either.

150
00:13:09,944 --> 00:13:13,954
The superiors are looking for you now. I feel you may have to go there.

151
00:13:13,954 --> 00:13:16,094
I cannot move from here.

152
00:13:16,094 --> 00:13:19,594
Do we all step away as we were told?

153
00:13:19,594 --> 00:13:21,934
You might lose her at this rate.

154
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:24,904
We need to find her right now before she escapes the palace.

155
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:28,444
You should go. We will protect this place.

156
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,844
Then I will be right back, after assessing what is going on.

157
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:34,304
All right.

158
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,924
What are you doing?

159
00:14:09,924 --> 00:14:13,974
We have received an order to find a suspicious court lady whose background is unknown.

160
00:14:13,974 --> 00:14:17,944
What are you doing? Did I not tell you all to withdraw?

161
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:21,554
Well, you have come to the wrong place.

162
00:14:21,554 --> 00:14:25,904
I am Seon Ah, working as an inner court lady.

163
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:35,804
Based on the registry, Inner Court Lady Sen Ah is bedridden from a severe illness.

164
00:14:35,804 --> 00:14:39,184
Oh, it has been a long time since I have gotten better!

165
00:14:39,184 --> 00:14:43,314
I am now completely well physically.

166
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:47,204
We are going to need you to come with us for now.

167
00:14:47,204 --> 00:14:49,404
I mean... well...

168
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:53,234
Then, please call the Head Eunuch and the Head Court Lady for me.

169
00:14:53,234 --> 00:14:55,244
They would vouch for my identity.

170
00:14:55,244 --> 00:15:01,034
We were told to watch out, in particular, for a court lady who is under the protection of those in high positions.

171
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:03,964
How dare you try to lay a hand on her!

172
00:15:03,964 --> 00:15:07,854
This is not something that a low-level Royal Investigation Bureau agent to get involved in!

173
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:10,474
I told you that it was an order from the superiors.

174
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,234
I mean... Wait!

175
00:15:14,234 --> 00:15:16,214
Wait, wait!

176
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,944
What is your identity?

177
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,204
How could the Royal Guards recklessly arrest a court lady like this?

178
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,234
This girl, in particular, is an inner court lady who works in the king's palace.

179
00:15:58,234 --> 00:16:02,054
Head Court Lady. What is the name of this inner court lady?

180
00:16:02,054 --> 00:16:04,944
It is Seon Ah. It should be in the registry.

181
00:16:04,944 --> 00:16:10,294
Based on our investigation, I heard that she was called by name So Rang.

182
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,934
She is hiding her identity and working in the palace.

183
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:19,384
But to think that she is working in the place closest to his majesty...

184
00:16:19,384 --> 00:16:21,594
She is an inner court lady whose identity is vouched for by the Royal Investigation Bureau.

185
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:24,644
You should stop your probing and let her go now!

186
00:16:24,644 --> 00:16:28,414
No matter how much we investigate, we could not figure out her identity.

187
00:16:28,414 --> 00:16:32,584
It appears that even her name So Rang is not her real name.

188
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:50,214
We are currently looking for the woman who is causing mayhem who looks similar to the late crown princess,

189
00:16:50,214 --> 00:16:53,434
so how could this girl be the culprit?

190
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:59,184
Sometimes, you catch an eel while trying to catch a chicken.

191
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:08,324
We have finished the full investigation of all the court ladies in the palace.

192
00:17:08,324 --> 00:17:12,594
There was no one who we could not identify.

193
00:17:12,594 --> 00:17:14,154
Apart from just one person...

194
00:17:14,154 --> 00:17:16,994
We even had someone who knew the face of her highness the late crown princess participate in the investigation,

195
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,824
but there was nobody who had a similar face.

196
00:17:18,824 --> 00:17:22,554
Then, should we not investigate the most suspicious person?

197
00:17:22,554 --> 00:17:25,074
And we should carry out a thorough investigation of the superiors

198
00:17:25,074 --> 00:17:29,724
who are trying to protect her, regardless of their status or position.

199
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,054
Will you follow us to the investigation room?

200
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:36,844
You are going to have to tell us

201
00:17:36,844 --> 00:17:41,144
how this woman managed to enter the palace,

202
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,814
and how she was able to act as an inner court lady.

203
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,924
Take her away.

204
00:17:47,924 --> 00:17:49,284
Yes, sir.

205
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,604
Give me a moment.

206
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,794
Are you all right?

207
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,654
What does it mean that your name is not real? What is that supposed to mean?

208
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:42,164
I will not ask about your reasons, since the circumstances are as they are.

209
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:46,674
If you can just tell me your real name, I will do whatever I can to get you released from here.

210
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,874
I thought we were friends.

211
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,054
If you are like this, I cannot help you.

212
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:02,454
 My name is...Ye Hyeon Seon.

213
00:19:02,454 --> 00:19:06,334
 The bride that you lost seven years ago.

214
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,114
What is that sound?

215
00:19:22,114 --> 00:19:26,124
There is a departure ceremony for the elite unit that is heading to the frontiers to conquer the barbarians.

216
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,084
A departure ceremony?

217
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:31,664
His majesty will personally attend and encourage them, since it is really rough there.

218
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:37,514
- Then, I suppose we cannot check the identities of everyone attending. 
 - What?

219
00:19:37,514 --> 00:19:41,864
I mean, if she is not hiding as a court lady, then she could be hiding among the military.

220
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:46,674
Would you be able to request the royal guards to carry out a full investigation?

221
00:19:46,674 --> 00:19:48,064
It would probably be impossible.

222
00:19:48,064 --> 00:19:51,404
The one who is in charge of the overall event is the minister of defense, Jo Seong Gyun.

223
00:19:51,404 --> 00:19:55,184
The royal guards are also under the control of the minister of defense.

224
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,674
So there is nobody who can check the faces of the soldiers.

225
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,764
There is exactly one person who can.

226
00:20:03,764 --> 00:20:08,534
Someone who is above the minister of defense, who will be watching this departure ceremony,

227
00:20:08,534 --> 00:20:14,574
and...who knows the face of the late crown princess well.

228
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:48,424
What do you think, Your Majesty?

229
00:20:48,424 --> 00:20:52,534
Don't you think you will no longer have to worry about the frontier?

230
00:20:52,534 --> 00:20:54,994
I suppose so.

231
00:20:54,994 --> 00:20:57,344
You seem a bit tired.

232
00:20:57,344 --> 00:21:00,854
If you are tired, shall we wrap it up a bit earlier?

233
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:06,074
I heard that in the frontiers,

234
00:21:06,074 --> 00:21:11,424
these soldiers go through unbearable cold, in places where it even snows in May and June.

235
00:21:11,424 --> 00:21:14,814
Since these are men who are heading there voluntarily,

236
00:21:14,814 --> 00:21:18,724
as king, I must not be stingy in bestowing my encouragement and praise.

237
00:21:18,724 --> 00:21:20,354
Thus,

238
00:21:22,244 --> 00:21:28,404
I will personally go around to each of the soldiers to encourage them and boost their morale.

239
00:21:30,014 --> 00:21:32,334
There is no need for that.

240
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:36,134
There are hundreds of soldiers, so why would youâ€”

241
00:21:37,014 --> 00:21:39,694
Since all the soldiers here

242
00:21:41,304 --> 00:21:43,784
are my people.

243
00:22:30,944 --> 00:22:34,574
Was there someone among the soldiers who had a hand like this?

244
00:22:41,274 --> 00:22:43,314
Lift your head.

245
00:23:36,714 --> 00:23:42,174
Yesterday, you disguised yourself as the crown princess and today, you are disguised as a soldier.

246
00:23:42,174 --> 00:23:45,444
Who was the one who brought you here?

247
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:50,304
They say she was moved to that location.

248
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:51,934
Is that right?

249
00:23:54,574 --> 00:23:58,264
How someone who hid their identity is hiding among the soldiers...

250
00:23:58,264 --> 00:24:00,944
I am so sorry.

251
00:24:00,944 --> 00:24:06,824
The ministry of defense will take all responsibility and I will personally investigate this matter.

252
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:10,034
Would it really be necessary for the minister of defense to step in?

253
00:24:23,124 --> 00:24:24,884
Drag her away.

254
00:24:40,204 --> 00:24:41,514
What do you mean, So Rang disappeared?

255
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:43,364
What do you mean by that?

256
00:24:43,364 --> 00:24:45,024
What did you say?

257
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,934
  Crown Princess's Palace

258
00:25:16,394 --> 00:25:18,534
- Did anyone enter?
 - No.

259
00:25:18,534 --> 00:25:21,814
Do not ever open the doors for anyone.

260
00:25:21,814 --> 00:25:24,924
Today, protect this place with your own lives!

261
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:28,504
If you do not, I will take your lives.

262
00:25:28,504 --> 00:25:30,184
 Understood, Sire!

263
00:25:33,244 --> 00:25:36,504
Is there a place where you think So Rang might be?

264
00:26:04,464 --> 00:26:06,734
I will ask you one more time.

265
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:10,554
What is your real name?

266
00:26:10,554 --> 00:26:14,664
Who had you enter the palace and act as a court lady?

267
00:26:23,684 --> 00:26:26,714
Hurry up and confess the truth.

268
00:26:26,714 --> 00:26:31,914
All I have done was to serve the king by his side.

269
00:26:31,914 --> 00:26:33,844
Who!

270
00:26:35,234 --> 00:26:38,664
I asked you who brought you into the palace!

271
00:26:40,524 --> 00:26:42,134
I did.

272
00:26:50,474 --> 00:26:52,564
I had her enter the palace.

273
00:26:57,074 --> 00:27:00,044
Where did the chief royal guard Kim Eui Jun go?

274
00:27:00,044 --> 00:27:02,374
There is one more interrogation room in the basement of the prison.

275
00:27:02,374 --> 00:27:04,374
He took her there.

276
00:27:15,474 --> 00:27:17,404
Your Majesty...

277
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:49,894
Who dared to drag you here recklessly like this?

278
00:27:51,314 --> 00:27:54,514
She is a suspicious woman whose identity cannot be determined.

279
00:27:54,514 --> 00:27:57,924
The name that she uses is not real, either!

280
00:28:19,914 --> 00:28:21,704
So

281
00:28:22,344 --> 00:28:23,974
what?

282
00:28:25,394 --> 00:28:28,614
She is a court lady who is part of my inner court!

283
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:32,474
Do I need to explain any further?

284
00:28:35,664 --> 00:28:38,014
Chief Royal Guard Kim Eui Jun.

285
00:28:38,014 --> 00:28:40,654
Since you have tortured the inner court lady of the king's private palace

286
00:28:40,654 --> 00:28:42,994
and put her in this state without my permission,

287
00:28:43,604 --> 00:28:47,184
it is essentially the same as having violated the king's body.

288
00:28:48,844 --> 00:28:53,674
Therefore, you will receive the same punishment

289
00:28:54,574 --> 00:28:56,814
as would be given for harming the king.

290
00:28:57,774 --> 00:29:00,584
Tie him up!

291
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:24,744
Let's go.

292
00:29:24,744 --> 00:29:26,964
Your body is in such a pitiful state.

293
00:29:33,394 --> 00:29:34,944
So Rang! So Rang!

294
00:29:34,944 --> 00:29:37,774
Open your eyes! So Rang!

295
00:29:50,784 --> 00:29:53,154
They say Cha Nyeon is currently in prison.

296
00:29:53,154 --> 00:29:56,584
What if she says our names while being tortured?

297
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:04,644
Who says that this shell game has ended?

298
00:30:04,644 --> 00:30:08,314
Go and deliver the message that his excellency

299
00:30:08,314 --> 00:30:12,084
needs to step in so I can be released.

300
00:30:33,214 --> 00:30:35,404
Are you awake?

301
00:30:38,074 --> 00:30:40,104
It is all my fault.

302
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:42,314
Because of me...

303
00:30:42,314 --> 00:30:44,204
Your Majesty.

304
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:49,454
It is a relief that you are alive.

305
00:30:50,604 --> 00:30:55,464
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

306
00:30:56,174 --> 00:30:57,844
No.

307
00:30:58,564 --> 00:31:01,334
Why do you think something like this happened?

308
00:31:02,354 --> 00:31:04,954
Don't you think that they have done this knowing

309
00:31:04,954 --> 00:31:07,664
that I would be shaken by just the shadow of the crown princess?

310
00:31:10,844 --> 00:31:15,844
I promise now that I will erase it all.

311
00:31:17,444 --> 00:31:19,514
Her highness the crown princess?

312
00:31:19,514 --> 00:31:26,114
I will now no longer ask you to channel the spirit of the crown princess.

313
00:31:40,674 --> 00:31:42,264
Then,

314
00:31:43,964 --> 00:31:49,034
I suppose my work is over then.

315
00:31:50,004 --> 00:31:56,104
Would there be any need for me to stay anymore inthe inner court, then?

316
00:32:00,144 --> 00:32:03,334
Do you not know the reason you are here?

317
00:32:04,444 --> 00:32:07,834
Was it not to channel the spirit of her highness?

318
00:32:07,834 --> 00:32:10,104
No. You...

319
00:32:10,824 --> 00:32:14,694
are here to assist me by my side.

320
00:32:14,694 --> 00:32:19,154
Therefore, from now, stay by my side

321
00:32:20,644 --> 00:32:22,974
with the official name of Court Lady So Rang.

322
00:32:26,994 --> 00:32:28,774
However, Your Majesty!

323
00:32:28,774 --> 00:32:30,464
I am...

324
00:32:36,924 --> 00:32:38,664
Thanks...

325
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,504
for being alive.

326
00:33:04,344 --> 00:33:07,804
Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

327
00:33:08,834 --> 00:33:12,334
- Your Majesty...
 - That woman...

328
00:33:12,334 --> 00:33:15,794
This time, it's not in the crown princess's palace!

329
00:33:41,984 --> 00:33:45,214
Your Majesty... Your Majesty!

330
00:33:45,214 --> 00:33:46,984
Your Majesty. You should not, Your Majesty!

331
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:49,144
Your Majesty...

332
00:34:02,634 --> 00:34:05,744
Why, of all the places...

333
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:07,254
Why here?

334
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:11,954
Do you not think this is a warning about So Rang?

335
00:34:36,514 --> 00:34:39,264
Your Majesty! Your Majesty...

336
00:34:39,934 --> 00:34:42,194
Who!

337
00:34:42,194 --> 00:34:43,744
Your Majesty...

338
00:34:44,824 --> 00:34:47,194
... is responsible for this?

339
00:34:53,564 --> 00:34:55,204
I think...

340
00:34:56,174 --> 00:34:58,994
I need to go to his majesty.

341
00:35:01,144 --> 00:35:02,794
I'm sorry.

342
00:35:08,044 --> 00:35:10,494
It is such a relief that you are alive.

343
00:35:13,434 --> 00:35:15,884
 It is a relief that you are alive.

344
00:35:16,804 --> 00:35:22,794
Why is everyone saying to me that it is a relief that I am alive?

345
00:35:29,154 --> 00:35:30,844
Something must have been taking place

346
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:35,164
in the palace for the past several years, right?

347
00:35:36,124 --> 00:35:38,304
I told you that I am fine.

348
00:35:44,614 --> 00:35:46,434
Head Eunuch.

349
00:35:47,384 --> 00:35:49,904
I am so afraid.

350
00:35:49,904 --> 00:35:51,794
Your Majesty...

351
00:35:55,454 --> 00:35:56,324
Your Majesty...

352
00:35:56,324 --> 00:36:00,124
 People were murdered every year?

353
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:04,324
A total of six women who were closest to his majesty...

354
00:36:04,324 --> 00:36:07,414
Actually... now it is seven.

355
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:15,474
Then... the reason why someone like me had a bodyguard like you

356
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:18,524
was because I might have been the next one to die hanging?

357
00:36:18,524 --> 00:36:20,414
- So Rang...
 - I am right.

358
00:36:20,414 --> 00:36:23,814
The one who got the closest to his majesty was me,

359
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:26,364
so it would make sense for me to be the one hanging there.

360
00:36:26,364 --> 00:36:27,994
I told you that the palace was a dangerous place!

361
00:36:27,994 --> 00:36:29,154
We don't know when something might happen!

362
00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:31,474
Still, how could you...

363
00:36:33,434 --> 00:36:35,054
How could you...

364
00:36:35,054 --> 00:36:37,224
And so...

365
00:36:37,224 --> 00:36:39,734
you should leave the palace now.

366
00:36:41,154 --> 00:36:44,024
You wanted to live a free life, too.

367
00:36:50,994 --> 00:36:54,384
Will I be able to live safely outside, then?

368
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:01,264
I will protect you by your side.

369
00:37:02,864 --> 00:37:04,484
I will

370
00:37:05,234 --> 00:37:07,754
be by your side.

371
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,220
â™«   Do you know it?  â™«

372
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,014
I think...

373
00:37:20,014 --> 00:37:24,280
â™«  Our own story  â™«

374
00:37:24,954 --> 00:37:27,924
I need to go to his majesty. 
 â™«  which no one knew  â™«

375
00:37:29,124 --> 00:37:33,704
His majesty is in so much pain right now.

376
00:37:35,934 --> 00:37:48,934
â™«  Once again, my resolutions are like an old wall standing precariously  â™«

377
00:37:50,684 --> 00:37:52,090
Do not go.

378
00:37:58,274 --> 00:37:59,990
You need to get treatment for your wounds first.

379
00:38:03,294 --> 00:38:11,454
â™«  You know, I cannot be strong  â™«

380
00:38:11,454 --> 00:38:16,874
â™«  When you still come to me crying  â™«

381
00:38:16,874 --> 00:38:21,704
â™«  Hoping you get better  â™«

382
00:38:21,704 --> 00:38:27,214
â™«  Lean against me like nothing happened  â™«

383
00:38:27,214 --> 00:38:29,714
I will take you there.

384
00:38:29,714 --> 00:38:37,464
â™«  Could you do that for me at that moment?  â™«

385
00:39:00,074 --> 00:39:04,374
You should lie down a bit.

386
00:39:47,674 --> 00:39:49,634
So Rang.

387
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:56,070
Please stay by my side.

388
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,834
â™«  On this night when even the moon sleeps  â™«

389
00:39:58,834 --> 00:40:02,024
 What is the reason why

390
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:05,734
 I want to be by your side, even if I were to die?

391
00:40:07,374 --> 00:40:12,974
 Why do I not want to leave here when they say I will end up dead?

392
00:40:12,974 --> 00:40:15,534
Yes, Your Majesty.

393
00:40:15,534 --> 00:40:21,830
â™«  Where are you going in such a rush?  â™«

394
00:40:53,859 --> 00:40:58,579
I think... I need to stay by his majesty's side.

395
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:04,169
His majesty is in so much pain right now.

396
00:41:04,779 --> 00:41:07,869
You almost died here!

397
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:09,439
And yet you can say such things?

398
00:41:09,439 --> 00:41:13,289
Just as you have protected his majesty up to this point,

399
00:41:14,899 --> 00:41:16,569
I, too...

400
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:20,309
want to protect his majesty.

401
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:27,799
The person I want to protect now

402
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:30,869
is not him.

403
00:41:32,479 --> 00:41:34,899
The one I worry about

404
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:38,499
is also not him.

405
00:41:55,539 --> 00:41:58,809
Why is his excellency not coming here?

406
00:42:07,249 --> 00:42:09,939
It is quite cold in here, I see.

407
00:42:09,939 --> 00:42:12,269
You have been going through a lot in such a rough place.

408
00:42:12,269 --> 00:42:15,779
Your Excellency, I have been waiting for you.

409
00:42:21,969 --> 00:42:26,389
As expected, my discernment was not wrong.

410
00:42:26,389 --> 00:42:29,569
I believed that you would follow me to the end.

411
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:31,699
Of course.

412
00:42:33,219 --> 00:42:37,169
There was something that I promised you.

413
00:42:37,169 --> 00:42:39,199
As long as you are one of my own,

414
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:44,299
I would make sure that you do not suffer.

415
00:42:44,299 --> 00:42:45,679
Do not worry.

416
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:48,599
I will help you to be at ease.

417
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:37,499
You must have been so scared!

418
00:43:39,769 --> 00:43:41,849
Yes...

419
00:43:41,849 --> 00:43:43,639
Yes.

420
00:43:45,479 --> 00:43:48,029
I am sorry.

421
00:43:58,429 --> 00:44:01,389
 The fact that someone hung a dead body here...

422
00:44:02,549 --> 00:44:09,289
 Does that mean they will soon target So Rang?

423
00:45:08,109 --> 00:45:11,259
That you would have me come here...

424
00:45:11,259 --> 00:45:17,169
It appears that the discipline in this palace is a mess.

425
00:45:17,169 --> 00:45:18,989
It's because you need to take responsibility.

426
00:45:18,989 --> 00:45:20,819
Me?

427
00:45:21,439 --> 00:45:24,799
Well, sure. What shall I take responsibility for?

428
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:31,649
A girl named Cha Nyeon was disguised as a soldier and hiding among the elite unit.

429
00:45:31,649 --> 00:45:35,809
As you already know, I am a minister.

430
00:45:35,809 --> 00:45:37,809
Even though I lead the ministry of defense,

431
00:45:37,809 --> 00:45:41,669
how could I possibly know every single soldier?

432
00:45:41,669 --> 00:45:43,719
It would be possible for you to give orders.

433
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:44,749
What kind of orders?

434
00:45:44,749 --> 00:45:48,089
That if you get caught, commit suicide by hanging yourself? Like that?

435
00:45:48,089 --> 00:45:50,039
You know that it could not be suicide.

436
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:53,879
I feel as if I've heard that many times before somewhere.

437
00:45:55,269 --> 00:45:58,869
One more person committed suicide in the palace yesterday.

438
00:45:58,869 --> 00:46:00,509
Another?

439
00:46:01,419 --> 00:46:03,299
Is there a negative energy within the palace?

440
00:46:03,299 --> 00:46:06,069
Why do people keep committing suicide?

441
00:46:06,069 --> 00:46:09,169
The person who died was the chief royal guard, Kim Eui Jun.

442
00:46:09,169 --> 00:46:12,669
From what I remember, he was pretty close to you, Your Excellency.

443
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:15,409
How could I know a mere chief of the royal guards?

444
00:46:15,409 --> 00:46:19,299
Someone saw you meeting that man, Your Excellency.

445
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:22,709
Then,

446
00:46:22,709 --> 00:46:24,779
I probably would have entreated him

447
00:46:24,779 --> 00:46:28,189
asking him to protect his majesty well as a royal guard,

448
00:46:28,189 --> 00:46:31,229
saying, "Do your job well!"

449
00:46:32,979 --> 00:46:34,989
An entreaty?

450
00:46:36,869 --> 00:46:39,769
Did you not get rid of him because you no longer needed him?

451
00:46:39,769 --> 00:46:41,629
Bring me evidence if you have it.

452
00:46:41,629 --> 00:46:45,179
Do not accuse me based on your feelings without any actual evidence.

453
00:46:45,179 --> 00:46:46,729
You are going too far!

454
00:46:46,729 --> 00:46:48,259
Since I have gone too far, I will say one more thing.

455
00:46:48,259 --> 00:46:53,809
I hear that the dead body was hanging in some court lady's quarters.

456
00:46:54,749 --> 00:46:59,499
What was that court lady's name again?

457
00:47:03,969 --> 00:47:05,469
Lee Sin Won.

458
00:47:05,469 --> 00:47:11,629
Do you think you can protect what you are trying to protect to the end?

459
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:23,939
It so happens that I was about to leave after finishing my investigation.

460
00:47:27,409 --> 00:47:28,989
Sin Won.

461
00:47:28,989 --> 00:47:31,519
Did you finish assessing the state of the incident?

462
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:36,269
Oh, are you curious about why something like this took place?

463
00:47:36,269 --> 00:47:39,639
I will answer that for you.

464
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:45,169
It is because your majesty is so weak of heart

465
00:47:45,169 --> 00:47:50,749
that you would be swayed by things like this.

466
00:47:50,749 --> 00:47:53,599
A monarch...

467
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:58,019
should not care so much about the lives of insignificant people.

468
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:02,319
Sin Won.

469
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:06,139
Bring me everything that might be corroborative evidence.

470
00:48:06,139 --> 00:48:08,209
Yes, Sire.

471
00:48:08,209 --> 00:48:12,399
Sure. Good luck with that.

472
00:48:18,889 --> 00:48:22,759
The name Cha Nyeon was listed in the directory of courtesans in Wonju.

473
00:48:22,759 --> 00:48:28,129
That girl was a courtesan, you say?

474
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:33,859
 Sin Won.

475
00:48:33,859 --> 00:48:36,919
 You are going to need to visit Wonju.

476
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:42,479
Cha Nyeon?

477
00:48:42,479 --> 00:48:46,299
It has already been about a month since she was kidnapped.

478
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:47,349
Kidnapped?

479
00:48:47,349 --> 00:48:51,369
After that, we do not know where she went, either.

480
00:48:56,329 --> 00:49:00,579
I have seen so many people pass by, traveling with goods,

481
00:49:00,579 --> 00:49:01,939
since it is a street corner.

482
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:05,309
Have you seen a woman that looks like this picture?

483
00:49:06,219 --> 00:49:08,079
I don't know.

484
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:11,889
How about someone transporting a bag that can fit a person?

485
00:49:12,479 --> 00:49:17,109
 I heard rumors about them being piled up in some mountain road warehouse,

486
00:49:17,109 --> 00:49:20,569
 but it is so scary, so how could anyone go to check?

487
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,229
So, are you feeling better?

488
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:36,169
Yes I've gotten a lot better.

489
00:50:42,669 --> 00:50:44,109
How is this fine?

490
00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:47,169
Oh, no. I am fine.

491
00:50:48,469 --> 00:50:53,949
Who do you think I am that you are worried about me like this?

492
00:50:56,169 --> 00:50:58,139
Do not trust me so much.

493
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:02,539
Am I someone who is trustworthy in any way?

494
00:51:06,529 --> 00:51:10,289
If someone has a secret that they are trying to hide,

495
00:51:10,289 --> 00:51:12,989
I have heard that you should keep quiet about it.

496
00:51:14,219 --> 00:51:19,039
And is that why you are not asking me about who I am?

497
00:51:37,279 --> 00:51:39,799
Have you found anything that would be corroborative evidence?

498
00:51:39,799 --> 00:51:42,419
I am in the middle of organizing them.

499
00:51:47,859 --> 00:51:51,599
But what is this?

500
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,789
I found it in an abandoned warehouse in Wonju.

501
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:28,599
This should do.

502
00:52:38,259 --> 00:52:41,349
You have something for me that is worth using?

503
00:53:01,069 --> 00:53:04,199
We stole her away from a courtesan house in Wonju.

504
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:06,829
I was quite shocked when I saw her, too.

505
00:53:10,789 --> 00:53:13,249
What is your name?

506
00:53:14,019 --> 00:53:16,689
My name is Cheo Nyeon.

507
00:53:21,969 --> 00:53:25,269
Sir, please spare my life!

508
00:53:30,869 --> 00:53:35,569
This is the last ceremonial dress left in Joseon.

509
00:54:05,889 --> 00:54:09,939
It looks great on you.

510
00:54:10,749 --> 00:54:16,009
If you just do what I tell you to do, I will send you back to your hometown.

511
00:54:16,569 --> 00:54:19,069
However, if anything goes wrong,

512
00:54:20,129 --> 00:54:24,359
it would be difficult to retain your life.

513
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:26,169
So?

514
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:31,559
You are able to do well, right?

515
00:54:39,459 --> 00:54:43,949
How could a kidnapped courtesan become the fake crown princess?

516
00:54:43,949 --> 00:54:48,269
It means that there's a kidnapping organization involved in this case.

517
00:55:09,779 --> 00:55:15,479
You said that once I finish this job, you will spare my life and send me home!

518
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:21,459
That was if everything went well.

519
00:55:46,649 --> 00:55:49,839
You said you were going to hang that court lady there!

520
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:52,229
What happened?

521
00:55:52,229 --> 00:55:57,659
But I could not have that girl Cha Nyeon stay alive.

522
00:55:57,659 --> 00:56:03,439
Why? Did you, in that short span, grow affectionate toward her?

523
00:56:03,439 --> 00:56:05,679
What do you mean by affection?

524
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:10,489
When I think about the time and effort I put into teaching that country girl in order to make her presentable...

525
00:56:12,009 --> 00:56:15,809
So, are you going to keep that court lady alive?

526
00:56:15,809 --> 00:56:18,059
What if she receives the king's grace and begets a child?

527
00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:23,389
She may enter the queen's palace without resistance in such a case.

528
00:56:23,389 --> 00:56:27,449
Without even going through the selection process.

529
00:56:27,449 --> 00:56:32,839
It appears that this time, I will have to step in personally.

530
00:56:32,839 --> 00:56:36,569
Personally step in, what does that mean?

531
00:56:42,409 --> 00:56:44,089
Did you hear the news?

532
00:56:44,089 --> 00:56:47,269
Lady Jong Dal in the upper village was also kidnapped!

533
00:56:47,269 --> 00:56:50,429
Aigoo. It is so frustrating, so frustrating!

534
00:56:50,429 --> 00:56:53,589
I mean, if you got kidnapped and forced to marrry,

535
00:56:53,589 --> 00:56:56,299
could you not just run away again?

536
00:56:56,299 --> 00:56:58,969
Shame on you! Would they let them run away like that?

537
00:56:58,969 --> 00:57:00,699
- Then what?
 - Once they kidnap you,

538
00:57:00,699 --> 00:57:02,969
they would first take your virginity.

539
00:57:02,969 --> 00:57:04,749
- Virginity first?
 - Is not Joseon like that?

540
00:57:04,749 --> 00:57:07,799
If a bride who lost her virginity returned home, she wouldn't be accepted by her family.

541
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:10,789
No one would marry her. So she just stays with her captor.

542
00:57:10,789 --> 00:57:11,809
Aigoo, so scary!

543
00:57:11,809 --> 00:57:13,669
- It is so terrible!
 - Aigoo, that is so terrible!

544
00:57:13,669 --> 00:57:17,969
Hae Yeong, that is why you need to have more of a realistic point of view.

545
00:57:17,969 --> 00:57:20,919
Hey! When you think about it, a man like me is really daebak.

546
00:57:20,919 --> 00:57:23,169
Since I can protect you forever.

547
00:57:23,169 --> 00:57:25,109
Who can? Who will protect whom?

548
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:27,429
No need for you to care about my Hae Young.

549
00:57:27,429 --> 00:57:29,779
Why do you show up to Aedaldang every day when I told you to bugger off?

550
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,289
I was just visiting.

551
00:57:31,289 --> 00:57:32,859
- Then get lost! 
 - What did you say?

552
00:57:32,859 --> 00:57:35,729
- Why do you fight every time you meet!
 - The hour isâ€”

553
00:57:35,769 --> 00:57:39,029
It is already late, so you all please leave.

554
00:57:39,029 --> 00:57:41,459
I need to sleep soon so I can go to work tomorrow!

555
00:57:41,459 --> 00:57:45,939
- Has it already become so late?
 - Come on, hurry up and leave!

556
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:49,469
Goodness. You still have not gone home.

557
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:52,839
I told you to go home early today! Hurry up! Quickly!

558
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:54,839
Yes, old man...

559
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,589
Maiden, come with me.

560
00:57:59,439 --> 00:58:01,269
With me. I am...

561
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:04,559
I am thinking of walking you home.

562
00:58:05,429 --> 00:58:08,049
Shall we go holding hands?

563
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:35,509
Shall we go together...

564
00:58:41,369 --> 00:58:44,139
If you are going to be like that, let's go together.

565
00:58:44,169 --> 00:58:49,469
If you say so, I would have no choice but to accompany you...

566
00:59:11,789 --> 00:59:13,929
- I will be on my way.
 - Yes.

567
00:59:16,669 --> 00:59:20,679
- What is wrong? 
 - Maiden Hae Yeong got kidnapped.

568
00:59:20,679 --> 00:59:23,539
Hae Yeong? What do we do?

569
00:59:23,539 --> 00:59:25,769
So Rang, go inside for now.

570
00:59:25,769 --> 00:59:29,109
- Oh, no, t-take me with you!
 - Hurry!

571
00:59:29,109 --> 00:59:30,779
Let us go.

572
01:00:34,669 --> 01:00:36,999
So Rang.

573
01:00:36,999 --> 01:00:39,099
 Only wear flower slippers from now on.

574
01:00:44,119 --> 01:00:45,959
 Do you think you can protect

575
01:00:45,959 --> 01:00:49,689
 what you are trying to protect to the end?

576
01:00:49,689 --> 01:00:53,059
 More people will start to seek So Rang's life,

577
01:00:53,059 --> 01:00:55,639
 and they will become more persistent.

578
01:00:57,209 --> 01:00:59,439
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

579
01:00:59,439 --> 01:01:04,019
Y-Your Majesty...

580
01:01:05,009 --> 01:01:07,879
So Rang was... So Rang was...

581
01:01:50,429 --> 01:01:52,209
Stop!

582
01:01:58,229 --> 01:02:02,009
Do not worry about me, Chief! Hurry!

583
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:05,339
Hurry up and go! I said hurry up and go!

584
01:02:46,269 --> 01:02:47,969
Your Majesty!

585
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:03,389
Your Majesty, how did you come all the way here...

586
01:03:03,389 --> 01:03:06,649
- Let us talk later. This is urgent. 
 - My apologies.

587
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:10,169
We don't have time to discuss where the fault lies if we want to save So Rang.

588
01:03:14,269 --> 01:03:17,569
The night watch says that he has spotted suspicious activity in Gwanak Mountain.

589
01:03:17,569 --> 01:03:20,969
The elite unit, follow me. The rest will investigate Gwanak Mountain.

590
01:03:20,969 --> 01:03:25,419
We must find her tonight!

591
01:03:25,419 --> 01:03:26,869
Yes, Sire!

592
01:03:58,669 --> 01:04:00,809
Look at this.

593
01:04:00,809 --> 01:04:02,299
Yes.

594
01:04:03,649 --> 01:04:05,730
What is that?

595
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:15,800

596
01:04:51,869 --> 01:05:01,069
â™«  In the story that I should not have heard  â™«

597
01:05:01,069 --> 01:05:04,130
â™«  If what I wanted to hear  â™«

598
01:05:05,449 --> 01:05:08,989
 The Forbidden Marriage 
 Preview

599
01:05:08,989 --> 01:05:10,579
 She must be alive.

600
01:05:10,579 --> 01:05:13,679
 I will no longer lose anyone who is by my side.

601
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:16,999
 The sun is up. So why is he not back yet?

602
01:05:16,999 --> 01:05:18,769
 If the king has disappeared,

603
01:05:18,769 --> 01:05:22,569
 we should discuss the vacancy.

604
01:05:22,569 --> 01:05:24,049
 So Rang.

605
01:05:24,069 --> 01:05:29,479
 It appears you were not really a trustworthy person, Maiden.

606
01:05:29,479 --> 01:05:34,919
 Supposedly, the reason the king left the palace was merely for someone like you.

607
01:05:34,919 --> 01:05:37,489
 You should not lie anymore.

608
01:05:38,269 --> 01:05:40,919
 I need to see his majesty.

609
01:05:40,969 --> 01:05:46,700
â™«  You know, I cannot be strong  â™«
