2
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,854
Your Majesty. Are you all right?

3
00:01:45,854 --> 00:01:47,414
Y-Yes.

4
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,244
Oh, um...There were small flying bugs...

5
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:54,384
Dang it, these flying bugs...Bugs, bugs...

6
00:01:54,384 --> 00:01:55,964
Goodness.

7
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,554
It is late.

8
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,264
Go inside.

9
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,804
Yes.

10
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,690
Argh! Seriously!

11
00:03:13,384 --> 00:03:15,674
I must be crazy.

12
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,170
<i>Episode 2</i>

13
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,140
Old man. Hae Yeong.

14
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,894
Eonni!

15
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:33,284
Eonni, I am glad you made it back safely!

16
00:03:33,284 --> 00:03:37,444
I was worried you might be punished for fraud with flogging,

17
00:03:37,444 --> 00:03:39,954
leg-twisting, and face-branding.

18
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:43,264
Prison, my foot. Aigoo. She is coming from the palace.

19
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,724
What?

20
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,814
Old man. If you knew all this beforehand, then you should have told me!

21
00:03:48,814 --> 00:03:51,004
And that is why I told you not to commit fraud in the city!

22
00:03:51,004 --> 00:03:53,664
If you say it like that, of course I would not understand.

23
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:58,444
That fraud has now...Now...Really...

24
00:03:58,444 --> 00:04:02,680
You will now be working in the palace.

25
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:06,054
Excuse me? W-Why would I?

26
00:04:06,054 --> 00:04:11,694
Did you not say that if the king has anything to say to her highness the crown princess, you will deliver the message to her?

27
00:04:11,694 --> 00:04:14,144
It seems I will have to act as a court lady from now.

28
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:18,754
Why? Did you lie to them, saying that you were a court lady? With your appearance?

29
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,964
If you went to the palace, did you also get to see the king? How was he? How was he?

30
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,734
Hae Yeong.

31
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:30,844
The king is a crazy bastard.

32
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:33,060
- He is completely nuts.
- What?

33
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,364
Everyone goes crazy with how handsome the kings are in all the romance novels I've read.

34
00:04:38,364 --> 00:04:42,304
He tells me to channel the spirit of the crown princess, who died seven years ago.

35
00:04:42,304 --> 00:04:45,934
But the problem is that I need to keep acting as the crown princess.

36
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:48,284
Not only that, I will be entering as an inner court lady.

37
00:04:48,284 --> 00:04:50,574
What do I do? If I cannot do this, he will probably have me killed.

38
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:53,894
I mean, how do I know what a person who died seven years ago is like?

39
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:57,544
My head hurts... Oh, my head...Ow...

40
00:04:57,544 --> 00:05:02,594
He must be so desperate. How lonely must he be to miss a dead person so much?

41
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,334
Then what do I do? Do I keep acting as the spirit of a dead person?

42
00:05:05,334 --> 00:05:07,564
You need to help him forget her, even if it means deceiving him.

43
00:05:07,564 --> 00:05:12,044
Do you think that will be possible? He seems to have that woman completely buried in his heart. Really deeply.

44
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:13,754
Dig her out, and give her a burial.

45
00:05:13,754 --> 00:05:15,654
- Me?
- Ha!

46
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:20,004
Hey, is there anyone in Joseon who can lie as you can? The greatest liar in Joseon.

47
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,714
Hello!

48
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:44,164
You are pretty handsome.

49
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,824
What business do you have with me?

50
00:05:46,824 --> 00:05:48,764
What business?

51
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:53,964
Oh, I am Gwaeng Yi, a compatibility reader who works at Aedaldang with So Rang.

52
00:05:53,964 --> 00:05:57,834
I am also pretty talented in channeling.

53
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,564
Please keep quiet

54
00:06:00,564 --> 00:06:05,294
if you feel like someone has a secret.

55
00:06:05,294 --> 00:06:09,524
- Excuse me?
- If you do not, they might fly away like a butterfly

56
00:06:09,524 --> 00:06:15,504
for fear of their secret being revealed.

57
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,674
Why are you looking at me like that? You might give me the flutters!

58
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,904
And come visit Aedaldang often so my eyes can get their fill. Here.

59
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,694
I will give you some willow tea for free.

60
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,534
- Let go of me! I told you to let go of me!
- Husband!

61
00:06:51,534 --> 00:06:52,780
Do not worry, Wife!

62
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,200
No, you cannot do this! No, you cannot do this! No!

63
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,684
Wife!

64
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,114
I am not afraid of going to prison,

65
00:07:00,114 --> 00:07:04,034
but being separated from my husband is the worst hell on earth.

66
00:07:04,034 --> 00:07:06,594
Please, please send me to the same place.

67
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:08,084
Who is your husband?

68
00:07:08,084 --> 00:07:10,634
Do you not know the Marriage Ban Edict? The law prohibiting marriages?

69
00:07:10,634 --> 00:07:12,774
A secret marriage, my foot. Drag her away!

70
00:07:12,774 --> 00:07:14,554
No, you cannot do this!

71
00:07:14,554 --> 00:07:16,094
Wife! Let go of me!

72
00:07:16,094 --> 00:07:19,864
Husband! Husband!

73
00:07:19,864 --> 00:07:21,214
So, make sure you do this one well.

74
00:07:21,214 --> 00:07:23,754
What, deceiving the king?

75
00:07:23,754 --> 00:07:26,294
That's the only way the marriage ban will end!

76
00:07:26,294 --> 00:07:30,784
The marriage ban...depends on my lies, I see.

77
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,414
I guess you've done things like that, Chief.

78
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,724
All right!

79
00:07:41,724 --> 00:07:44,344
Come take a look at this!

80
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:46,430
What about the bottom one?

81
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,310
The price has been marked down.

82
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,704
Stop.

83
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:45,824
<i>Look, we have nice pears!</i>

84
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:54,594
I do not know what you have been doing that you have so many people to avoid, but—

85
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,464
I am not someone who needs to avoid anyone.

86
00:08:59,464 --> 00:09:01,064
Please...

87
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,794
Although I am currently responsible as your bodyguard, I am a sixth-level official as a Royal Investigation Bureau chief.

88
00:09:09,794 --> 00:09:12,714
If you tell me what's going on, I will—

89
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,550
<i>Seo Wun Jeong, 2nd concubine to (now dead) Mr. Ye</i>

90
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,514
Hurry, hurry!

91
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,264
What are you doing right now?

92
00:09:54,264 --> 00:09:57,904
Can you just shut up and run? If you do not, I will just run away!

93
00:09:57,904 --> 00:09:59,494
Wait!

94
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,744
Let us go.

95
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,484
It cannot be her, can it?

96
00:10:15,344 --> 00:10:18,774
<i>Are you saying there will be a marriage ban in this nation?</i>

97
00:10:18,774 --> 00:10:21,604
<i>If that is true,</i>

98
00:10:21,604 --> 00:10:24,214
<i>then my Hyeon Hui will miss her marriage timing.</i>

99
00:10:24,214 --> 00:10:25,844
<i>That is ridiculous.</i>

100
00:10:25,844 --> 00:10:28,014
<i>According to an itinerant compatibility reader,</i>

101
00:10:28,014 --> 00:10:29,944
<i>this ban will last seven years.</i>

102
00:10:29,944 --> 00:10:33,294
<i>If I have to live alone for that long, then I should even</i>

103
00:10:33,294 --> 00:10:35,644
<i>dig up my dead husband from his grave.</i>

104
00:10:35,644 --> 00:10:38,764
<i>In a situation where you would even beg for the dead to come back to life,</i>

105
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:41,384
<i>will it be difficult to push a live person over to death?</i>

106
00:10:41,384 --> 00:10:43,644
<i>Are you going to feed Hyeon Seon poisoned porridge?</i>

107
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,594
<i>Like you did with her mother?</i>

108
00:10:45,594 --> 00:10:49,734
<i>No! That takes too long.</i>

109
00:10:51,724 --> 00:10:55,284
<i>If there is something covering the sun,</i>

110
00:10:55,284 --> 00:10:57,784
<i>don't you need to cut it off</i>

111
00:10:57,784 --> 00:11:01,274
<i>so that the plant can flower?</i>

112
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,014
<i>You must not leave any trace.</i>

113
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:11,544
<i>I will tell her father that she ran away with a servant with whom she had an affair.</i>

114
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:19,494
<i>Think of it as giving up your marriage partner to your younger sister.</i>

115
00:11:19,494 --> 00:11:21,164
<i>What do you mean you haven't found her body?</i>

116
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:23,034
<i>This is making me feel so uneasy.</i>

117
00:11:23,034 --> 00:11:25,464
<i>I am sure she is dead.</i>

118
00:11:26,914 --> 00:11:30,504
<i>Nobody would be able to survive a fall from that cliff.</i>

119
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:34,024
Let us go.

120
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:55,594
<i>It is probably best that I enter the palace.</i>

121
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:09,274
I cannot keep chiding him into getting married.

122
00:12:10,394 --> 00:12:14,884
But I also cannot just watch and do nothing.

123
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:21,214
This is only causing so much frustration for this old woman.

124
00:12:21,214 --> 00:12:25,344
You have me, so I told you not to worry.

125
00:12:32,264 --> 00:12:34,350
As you asked, here is the list

126
00:12:35,074 --> 00:12:38,924
of potential young ladies who would be fitting as a queen.

127
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:43,154
I have also been meeting and adding more young ladies who would be worthy

128
00:12:43,154 --> 00:12:45,134
of the Queen's Palace.

129
00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:47,190
Is that so?

130
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,410
<i>Name: Hwan Seo Bin</i>

131
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,940
<i>Name: Cho Yun Hyeon</i>

132
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:56,694
Then, I guess we can choose someone from this list.

133
00:12:56,694 --> 00:13:00,724
If you worry so much like this, you will only gain more wrinkles.

134
00:13:00,724 --> 00:13:03,264
I will make sure to manage and prepare whoever on that list becomes

135
00:13:03,264 --> 00:13:06,014
the mistress of the Queen's Palace,

136
00:13:06,014 --> 00:13:09,414
so that she is not lacking in any way.

137
00:13:21,324 --> 00:13:23,584
Wow, this is too...

138
00:13:23,584 --> 00:13:28,334
Aigoo. You tripped because you are moving about so restlessly!

139
00:13:28,334 --> 00:13:29,764
Violence is bad!

140
00:13:29,764 --> 00:13:31,554
Then should I put you through leg-screwing?

141
00:13:31,554 --> 00:13:33,474
If your presence is made known to the palace,

142
00:13:33,474 --> 00:13:36,734
we shall all be sentenced to having our limbs torn off.

143
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:40,214
Follow me quietly as if you were dead.

144
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:45,044
Why people in this palace say we are going to die every chance they get?

145
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:57,134
Court Lady Won, what is that for?

146
00:14:00,584 --> 00:14:05,934
What! Why are there so many customs?

147
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:08,004
How dare you sigh in front of me?

148
00:14:08,004 --> 00:14:10,694
When you are in front of his majesty, you must even quiet your breathing!

149
00:14:10,694 --> 00:14:12,974
Then should I not breathe at all, like a dead person?

150
00:14:12,974 --> 00:14:15,700
If you tell me that I cannot do this or that, then what can I actually do?

151
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,964
- You cannot talk back to me like that.
- Aigoo!

152
00:14:17,964 --> 00:14:21,514
Do you think I want to become an inner court lady?

153
00:14:23,534 --> 00:14:27,154
I mean, I did want to try to be an inner court lady just once.

154
00:14:27,154 --> 00:14:29,924
From now on, your name is Sun Ah.

155
00:14:29,924 --> 00:14:34,534
- About what you used to do before entering the palace... Make sure you don't reveal anything.
- Yes.

156
00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:38,370
First, his majesty the king...

157
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,950
When his majesty is walking, do not step on his shadow.

158
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,530
You have to read all these books here,

159
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:45,310
to cultivate your body and mind. Memorize them all!

160
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,474
Do you understand? All right. Next, stand up.

161
00:14:48,474 --> 00:14:50,404
Your head should be like this, and your back like this.

162
00:14:50,404 --> 00:14:52,164
After you bow like this... Walk backward.

163
00:14:52,164 --> 00:14:54,294
You should not trip! You need a good beating to come to your senses, right?

164
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:56,194
Whoa, you should not be like that!

165
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:57,724
You need to be hit, don't you!

166
00:14:57,724 --> 00:14:59,904
Are you kneeling?

167
00:14:59,904 --> 00:15:01,434
I really need to go! I cannot do it right now.

168
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,034
Come here!

169
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:04,664
You cannot lift your butt like this.

170
00:15:04,664 --> 00:15:08,854
All right. These are the 100 rules you need to be especially aware of.

171
00:15:08,854 --> 00:15:11,694
Do you understand? Do you understand!

172
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:14,524
Excuse me? Oh, yes.

173
00:15:17,904 --> 00:15:21,854
Blood... I-I am bleeding.

174
00:15:23,304 --> 00:15:27,174
All right. It is now time for his majesty's supper.

175
00:15:27,174 --> 00:15:32,454
Will you be able to stand next to him like a shadow?

176
00:15:32,454 --> 00:15:36,244
I am... going to see his majesty right now?

177
00:15:43,884 --> 00:15:45,534
Wow...

178
00:16:02,994 --> 00:16:05,434
<i>He eats as if it is tasteless.</i>

179
00:16:05,434 --> 00:16:07,484
<i>What are you, a goat?</i>

180
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,664
Everyone, leave this room.

181
00:16:27,664 --> 00:16:29,274
Yes, Sire.

182
00:16:37,104 --> 00:16:38,894
You over there.

183
00:16:40,304 --> 00:16:42,324
Except you.

184
00:16:47,704 --> 00:16:51,824
Who made the rumbling noise from the stomach?

185
00:16:51,824 --> 00:16:55,574
The thing is... It is not something I can control...

186
00:16:55,574 --> 00:16:57,374
Whoa, that scared me!

187
00:16:57,374 --> 00:17:01,184
How dare you talk back to me? Have you not been trained yet?

188
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:04,714
Your Majesty, I came here to free you from the apparitions.

189
00:17:04,714 --> 00:17:07,604
However, if you cannot eat well like this, then your mind and body will grow weak

190
00:17:07,604 --> 00:17:10,234
and it will be more difficult for you to overcome the apparitions...

191
00:17:10,234 --> 00:17:12,304
This is what I hear all the time.

192
00:17:12,304 --> 00:17:18,034
So says... Her Royal Highness the crown princess.

193
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:19,974
My stupid mouth...

194
00:17:20,944 --> 00:17:22,934
The crown princess did?

195
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:25,624
Are you channeling her again?

196
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:32,004
It is not that, but I do hear her voice sometimes.

197
00:17:33,224 --> 00:17:34,714
What else does she want to tell me?

198
00:17:34,714 --> 00:17:38,344
Well... Oh, that you should eat your supper well,

199
00:17:38,344 --> 00:17:40,824
because watching you makes me lose my appetite...

200
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:44,774
That's what I seem... to be hearing, or not...

201
00:17:44,774 --> 00:17:48,514
It is a bit... You should go now, Your Highness.

202
00:17:48,514 --> 00:17:52,544
How dare you! How dare you send the crown princess away!

203
00:17:52,544 --> 00:17:56,094
- W-What was that?
- W-Why? What is it?

204
00:17:56,094 --> 00:17:58,034
You want us to eat together?

205
00:17:58,034 --> 00:18:01,694
Come on! No, that is not possible.

206
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:04,474
Why? Are you hungry?

207
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:07,654
Is the crown princess hungry?

208
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:11,074
How could a dead person be hungry? Only those who are alive are hungry.

209
00:18:11,074 --> 00:18:14,564
Her Highness tells me to eat with you, but I cannot as your servant.

210
00:18:14,564 --> 00:18:17,914
So call me when you are done eating. Let us go, Your Highness.

211
00:18:17,914 --> 00:18:19,510
Wait!

212
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:28,044
- Let's eat together.
- Pardon?

213
00:18:28,044 --> 00:18:30,084
I said, let us eat together.

214
00:18:31,274 --> 00:18:33,250
Let me take some rice.

215
00:18:35,754 --> 00:18:37,324
All right.

216
00:18:47,514 --> 00:18:48,934
Aren't you going to eat?

217
00:18:48,934 --> 00:18:51,824
Yes... Yes, I will.

218
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:55,914
Oh, boiled pork!

219
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:27,764
- It is tasty, isn't it?
- Yes, it's good.

220
00:19:37,374 --> 00:19:40,334
Your Highness, I enjoyed the meal.

221
00:19:40,334 --> 00:19:43,010
You should go and rest now.

222
00:19:52,574 --> 00:19:54,514
For some reason,

223
00:19:54,514 --> 00:19:58,164
it feels like I just had a meal with the crown princess.

224
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,214
I am full... So full.

225
00:20:01,214 --> 00:20:05,664
<i>I knew it. A person needs to eat well.</i>

226
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:08,204
<i>If I feed him well and have him sleep well,</i>

227
00:20:08,204 --> 00:20:11,174
<i>I would be recognized as setting him free from his apparitions, right?</i>

228
00:20:16,574 --> 00:20:20,374
Did his majesty finish his entire supper?

229
00:20:24,874 --> 00:20:27,924
Since it is your first day, you may go now.

230
00:20:27,924 --> 00:20:29,594
Really?

231
00:20:31,734 --> 00:20:33,604
Let us go now.

232
00:21:04,944 --> 00:21:07,324
How did such a noble Royal Investigation Bureau Chief

233
00:21:07,324 --> 00:21:10,244
get caught up with a fraud like me...

234
00:21:12,944 --> 00:21:16,584
Will I not be taken away if he finds out that I deceived him?

235
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:18,254
Darn it...

236
00:21:21,084 --> 00:21:24,444
I should get him on my side first.

237
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:38,344
My lord. The night air is nice,

238
00:21:38,344 --> 00:21:40,824
so how about having a drink with me?

239
00:21:40,824 --> 00:21:42,904
Where did you manage to get the alcohol?

240
00:21:42,904 --> 00:21:46,224
The king's food handlers said they would throw out all the unrefined and refined rice wine,

241
00:21:46,224 --> 00:21:48,644
so I rushed over there and brought it with me.

242
00:21:48,644 --> 00:21:52,104
It is probably good for at least another seven days.

243
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:54,104
When did you manage to go there?

244
00:21:55,454 --> 00:21:59,014
Still, I am currently working right now.

245
00:21:59,014 --> 00:22:00,844
Wait.

246
00:22:00,844 --> 00:22:04,104
But is it not your workplace wherever you are with me?

247
00:22:05,854 --> 00:22:08,204
Hold onto this for a moment!

248
00:22:13,804 --> 00:22:15,844
Surprise!

249
00:22:38,894 --> 00:22:41,624
All right! Egg.

250
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:48,814
This is called a loyalty shot.

251
00:22:48,814 --> 00:22:52,804
With hearts full of loyalty towards our king...

252
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:58,524
- Drink.
- Come on...

253
00:22:58,524 --> 00:23:00,744
I told you I would not drink.

254
00:23:02,864 --> 00:23:07,054
All right, then, this time, how about we pour alcohol into this cup

255
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:10,434
and the person to make this cup sink has to drink this entire thing.

256
00:23:10,434 --> 00:23:12,094
Is this how you played at home?

257
00:23:12,094 --> 00:23:17,264
As an itinerant peddler, what else would I do but drink?

258
00:23:17,264 --> 00:23:18,934
Here.

259
00:23:41,324 --> 00:23:43,174
I won!

260
00:23:45,334 --> 00:23:50,504
If you grant me one wish, I will drink half of the bowl for you.

261
00:23:50,504 --> 00:23:54,114
We call that Black Rose here.

262
00:23:54,114 --> 00:23:55,404
F-F-Forget it.

263
00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:57,654
How can a woman drink all this?

264
00:24:11,364 --> 00:24:14,024
My wish is...

265
00:24:14,024 --> 00:24:19,404
If you drink that entire thing, we will be friends, all right?

266
00:24:19,404 --> 00:24:22,974
I mean... I want to drop the honorifics.

267
00:24:22,974 --> 00:24:27,634
I understand that men and women are different, and there are differences in our age and class,

268
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:31,624
but I felt like we would never get close if we continue with honorifics.

269
00:24:41,884 --> 00:24:43,404
You are a bit more open than I thought.

270
00:24:43,404 --> 00:24:46,284
I thought you were all uptight.

271
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:49,764
However... only when we are by ourselves.

272
00:24:49,764 --> 00:24:54,914
But even if we drop the honorifics, shouldn't you call me "Orabeoni*" or something?
<i>(="older brother". The ancient equivalent of "oppa")</i>

273
00:24:54,914 --> 00:24:56,614
- N-No?
- Come on!

274
00:24:56,614 --> 00:24:59,324
Orabeoni? That would be so awkward.

275
00:24:59,324 --> 00:25:01,404
Then, you will call me by my name, Lee Sin Won, and be on even ground?

276
00:25:01,404 --> 00:25:03,974
If you want, I can call you by that.

277
00:25:03,974 --> 00:25:05,614
But...

278
00:25:06,484 --> 00:25:12,020
even though you are a Royal Investigation Bureau Chief, you would not arrest your friend, would you?

279
00:25:12,604 --> 00:25:13,794
Did you do something wrong?

280
00:25:13,794 --> 00:25:19,224
Even if I did something wrong, covering for me would be loyalty and friendship.

281
00:25:19,224 --> 00:25:20,874
Is that why you wanted to be friends?

282
00:25:20,874 --> 00:25:21,984
Don't you want to?

283
00:25:21,984 --> 00:25:23,814
Then should we just be strangers?

284
00:25:24,664 --> 00:25:26,514
No.

285
00:25:26,514 --> 00:25:29,024
Then since we became friends, I want to ask you one thing.

286
00:25:29,024 --> 00:25:32,170
- Yes?
- Did you almost get married before?

287
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:40,804
I mean, did you not ever have a man to marry before? I mean, you said you moved around a lot.

288
00:25:40,804 --> 00:25:42,604
I see.

289
00:25:42,604 --> 00:25:44,684
So that was what you meant.

290
00:25:44,684 --> 00:25:45,814
I did.

291
00:25:45,814 --> 00:25:49,494
There was a whole line of men wanting to marry me.

292
00:25:49,494 --> 00:25:52,424
But if I got married, you would have arrested me, no?

293
00:25:52,424 --> 00:25:57,104
- Then, before the Marriage Ban Edict was declared, what did you do?
- What?

294
00:25:58,284 --> 00:26:00,364
- I was a beggar.
- What?

295
00:26:00,364 --> 00:26:04,674
Honestly, I do not know how I was born, nor who I am.

296
00:26:04,674 --> 00:26:06,694
My family utterly abandoned me.

297
00:26:06,694 --> 00:26:11,204
Then, I met the old man Gwaeng Yi on the street, so I started learning compatibility reading.

298
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,814
Oh, I see...

299
00:26:13,814 --> 00:26:17,084
No wonder you had a needy look.

300
00:26:17,084 --> 00:26:19,674
<i>This bastard!</i>

301
00:26:19,674 --> 00:26:23,484
In any case, it is a painful past for me, so do not ask me anymore about it.

302
00:26:23,484 --> 00:26:27,494
Oh, and please keep the fact that I was a beggar a secret.

303
00:26:28,264 --> 00:26:29,284
<i>Wait.</i>

304
00:26:29,284 --> 00:26:31,504
<i>The fact that he believes me so easily makes me angry.</i>

305
00:26:31,504 --> 00:26:34,094
But ... why are you asking me that?

306
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:36,074
Why are you asking if I almost got married?

307
00:26:37,004 --> 00:26:43,294
Honestly, I almost married... the eldest daughter of Minister of Personnel, His Excellency Ye Hyeon Ho.

308
00:26:48,784 --> 00:26:50,954
<i>I go to see her.</i>

309
00:26:50,954 --> 00:26:53,044
<i>I don't go to see her.</i>

310
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:55,404
<i>I go to see her.</i>

311
00:26:55,404 --> 00:26:57,314
<i>- I do not go to see her.
- We've packed everything, right?</i>

312
00:26:57,314 --> 00:26:59,214
<i>Yes.</i>

313
00:26:59,214 --> 00:27:03,344
<i>Young Master, we will be on our way.</i>

314
00:27:03,344 --> 00:27:05,274
<i>Let's go!</i>

315
00:27:05,274 --> 00:27:06,954
<i>Wait!</i>

316
00:27:09,274 --> 00:27:10,854
<i>Wait.</i>

317
00:27:10,854 --> 00:27:17,974
♫ <i>I will sing of my feelings</i> ♫

318
00:27:17,974 --> 00:27:19,394
<i>Hello.</i>

319
00:27:20,844 --> 00:27:23,234
<i>All right, let us go inside.</i>

320
00:27:23,234 --> 00:27:34,560
♫ <i>I heard your humming voice from afar</i> ♫

321
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:44,684
♫ <i>What shall I do with my feelings for you?</i> ♫

322
00:27:47,024 --> 00:27:49,004
<i>Come on, why!</i>

323
00:27:49,004 --> 00:27:50,594
<i>Come on!</i>

324
00:27:50,594 --> 00:27:52,304
<i>For now, bring them to me.</i>

325
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:54,134
<i>I just want to see them!</i>

326
00:27:54,134 --> 00:27:57,914
<i>- Is it her?
- My Lady, those are the flower slippers that Lady Hyeon Seon will wear for her wedding.</i>

327
00:27:57,914 --> 00:27:59,484
<i>You should not covet that as well.</i>

328
00:27:59,484 --> 00:28:01,364
<i>- She is just a kid.
- Covet?</i>

329
00:28:01,364 --> 00:28:02,444
<i>Who?</i>

330
00:28:02,444 --> 00:28:03,434
<i>Me?</i>

331
00:28:03,434 --> 00:28:06,534
<i>Aigoo! Who said I was going to steal them or throw them away?</i>

332
00:28:06,534 --> 00:28:08,604
<i>Aishh!</i>

333
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:10,474
<i>I told you I would just take a look!</i>

334
00:28:10,474 --> 00:28:12,904
<i>So annoying! Hurry up and bring them!</i>

335
00:28:12,904 --> 00:28:16,944
<i>If her personality is to treat her servants like that...</i>

336
00:28:29,064 --> 00:28:31,504
<i>What is with this sudden peach blossom fragrance?</i>

337
00:28:39,514 --> 00:28:41,704
<i>Is it that lady?</i>

338
00:28:47,004 --> 00:28:58,524
♫ <i>Would you know my feelings for you?</i> ♫

339
00:28:58,524 --> 00:29:10,160
♫ <i>Those swaying flower petals</i> ♫

340
00:29:15,314 --> 00:29:16,934
<i>Moon,</i>

341
00:29:17,844 --> 00:29:20,404
<i>am I really getting married?</i>

342
00:29:20,404 --> 00:29:23,354
<i> Marriage Letter*
(Official letter from the groom's family to the bride's family)</i>

343
00:29:29,304 --> 00:29:34,934
<i>The willow tree family's firstborn son, Lee Sin Won.</i>

344
00:29:34,934 --> 00:29:38,714
<i>Are you really going to be my groom?</i>

345
00:29:41,794 --> 00:29:44,304
<i>Ahhh, what do I do...</i>

346
00:29:44,304 --> 00:29:47,884
<i>After my wedding, I will have to live separated from my father.</i>

347
00:29:47,884 --> 00:29:51,794
<i>But in place of your father, you will gain a husband.</i>

348
00:29:51,794 --> 00:29:57,604
<i>Shall I be able to perform my role well as daughter-in-law?</i>

349
00:29:59,434 --> 00:30:05,344
<i>- I will protect you so it is not too difficult for you.
- Wait...</i>

350
00:30:05,344 --> 00:30:09,854
<i>Once the wedding ceremony is over, would that very night become my first night?</i>

351
00:30:11,764 --> 00:30:14,774
<i>Even that, I will take care of—</i>

352
00:30:15,544 --> 00:30:18,754
<i>I heard that the groom is very handsome.</i>

353
00:30:19,504 --> 00:30:20,624
<i>Oh well...</i>

354
00:30:20,624 --> 00:30:23,404
<i>I guess the word has reached all the way here already.</i>

355
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:30,444
<i>I really hope that my husband is someone whom I can love and respect all my life.</i>

356
00:30:30,444 --> 00:30:32,160
<i>I promise</i>

357
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,714
<i>I will be that kind of husband.</i>

358
00:30:35,284 --> 00:30:37,214
<i>Oh, Su Hyang.</i>

359
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:44,174
<i>Lady Hyeon Hui asks to see the flower slippers we bought earlier.</i>

360
00:30:46,404 --> 00:30:50,374
<i>Well... if they go into Hyeon Hui's hands, would they ever return to me?</i>

361
00:30:50,374 --> 00:30:54,634
<i>If I go back empty-handed, things will become difficult for me...</i>

362
00:30:54,634 --> 00:30:56,324
<i>Wait.</i>

363
00:31:01,814 --> 00:31:03,684
<i>Here.</i>

364
00:31:03,684 --> 00:31:05,534
<i>These are better ones.</i>

365
00:31:05,534 --> 00:31:06,904
<i>Show them to Hyeon Hui.</i>

366
00:31:06,904 --> 00:31:10,494
<i>No, actually, just tell her to keep them.</i>

367
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,394
<i>My lady...</i>

368
00:31:12,394 --> 00:31:14,514
<i>You did not get to eat anything yet, right?</i>

369
00:31:14,514 --> 00:31:16,114
<i>Come here.</i>

370
00:31:16,614 --> 00:31:18,594
<i>Eat this, at least.</i>

371
00:31:20,424 --> 00:31:21,714
<i>Yes.</i>

372
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:23,454
<i>You are going through so much.</i>

373
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:06,744
<i>What is this?</i>

374
00:32:06,744 --> 00:32:13,694
♫ <i>Flower petals are falling white tonight</i> ♫

375
00:32:13,694 --> 00:32:26,284
♫ <i>I wonder if you think of me as well</i> ♫

376
00:32:40,864 --> 00:32:50,650
♫ <i>The flowers that bloom in my heart</i> ♫

377
00:32:51,744 --> 00:32:55,474
You saw the face of the woman who was supposed to be your bride?

378
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:58,784
But at the wedding...

379
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:12,054
<i>The Minister of Personnel Lord Ye Hyeon Ho's eldest daughter, Ye Hyeon Seon.</i>

380
00:33:13,854 --> 00:33:22,210
<i>The Chief State Councillor, His Excellency Lee Jeong Hak's firstborn son, Lee Sin Won.</i>

381
00:33:22,784 --> 00:33:27,064
<i>First, greet the groom.</i>

382
00:33:39,174 --> 00:33:42,454
<i>I told you I would just take a look!</i>

383
00:33:45,154 --> 00:33:47,934
<i>What is going on? They switched the bride?</i>

384
00:33:47,934 --> 00:33:50,734
<i>Aren't they beautiful?</i>

385
00:33:50,734 --> 00:33:53,374
<i>How nice...</i>

386
00:33:59,134 --> 00:34:02,934
<i>Are you really my bride?</i>

387
00:34:08,604 --> 00:34:09,594
<i>What is he talking about?</i>

388
00:34:09,594 --> 00:34:12,314
<i>What happened to my real bride?</i>

389
00:34:12,314 --> 00:34:13,684
<i>What is he talking about?</i>

390
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:14,804
<i>T-T-That is...</i>

391
00:34:14,804 --> 00:34:17,644
<i>Where is my real bride?</i>

392
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:22,464
<i>Everyone, stop!</i>

393
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,424
<i>Hey, what is going on?</i>

394
00:34:32,464 --> 00:34:35,624
<i>Starting today, the Marriage Ban Edict is in effect in this country.</i>

395
00:34:35,624 --> 00:34:37,534
<i>What do you mean by that?</i>

396
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:43,284
<i>From now on, girls between the ages of 13 to 18 cannot marry.</i>

397
00:34:43,284 --> 00:34:46,074
Your wedding was canceled?

398
00:34:46,074 --> 00:34:50,654
At my wedding, my bride was gone and her younger sister was sitting there instead.

399
00:34:50,654 --> 00:34:55,204
After that, I searched far and wide for my bride.

400
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,554
I told my family that I was going to do martial arts training.

401
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,014
<i>Well, that was not necessarily false, </i>

402
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:03,274
since I spent my time training with the sword whenever I had stray thoughts.

403
00:35:04,474 --> 00:35:09,554
I wanted to become an investigator, because I thought this would help me find my bride.

404
00:35:09,554 --> 00:35:13,764
Well, do you remember her face?

405
00:35:14,214 --> 00:35:16,284
Not sure.

406
00:35:16,284 --> 00:35:18,464
You do not, right?

407
00:35:20,434 --> 00:35:24,464
I forgot her face, but I remember her scent.

408
00:35:24,464 --> 00:35:27,484
A light pink peach blossom fragrance.

409
00:35:29,714 --> 00:35:33,304
Come on! That is a very common fragrance, you know?

410
00:35:33,304 --> 00:35:36,474
Literally, almost every woman has an incense sachet with that fragrance.

411
00:35:36,474 --> 00:35:38,844
You will not be able to find her with that.

412
00:35:40,294 --> 00:35:41,394
You are probably right.

413
00:35:41,394 --> 00:35:42,884
After all, I don't have a dog's nose.

414
00:35:42,884 --> 00:35:48,284
Right. You are pretty smart, so why are you depending on such an ignorant method?

415
00:35:48,284 --> 00:35:50,634
And you are an investigator as well.

416
00:35:50,634 --> 00:35:54,534
In any case, it is probably best that you forget her quickly.

417
00:35:54,534 --> 00:35:57,104
Look at the king. Seven years of faithful love?

418
00:35:57,104 --> 00:35:59,664
The entire nation is badmouthing him.

419
00:35:59,664 --> 00:36:00,644
You already know.

420
00:36:00,644 --> 00:36:02,824
If I forget her,

421
00:36:04,514 --> 00:36:07,124
would I be able to love another woman?

422
00:36:13,884 --> 00:36:17,964
Then you would have to arrest yourself.

423
00:36:24,494 --> 00:36:27,604
Gosh, I am cold now. Let us go inside now.

424
00:36:30,174 --> 00:36:31,884
Ye Hyeon Seon.

425
00:36:40,714 --> 00:36:44,654
Her name is Ye Hyeon Seon. The name of my bride who went missing.

426
00:36:48,174 --> 00:36:51,624
Do you... recognize that name by chance?

427
00:36:57,574 --> 00:36:59,094
No.

428
00:37:00,254 --> 00:37:05,014
<i>Please keep quiet if you feel like someone has a secret.</i>

429
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:08,914
<i>If you do not, they might fly away like a butterfly</i>

430
00:37:08,914 --> 00:37:14,194
<i>for fear of their secret being found out.</i>

431
00:37:18,254 --> 00:37:19,914
I am starting to feel the alcohol.

432
00:37:19,914 --> 00:37:22,344
I should hurry inside and go to sleep.

433
00:38:01,095 --> 00:38:02,965
Ten days ago, at an inn in Yanghwajin,

434
00:38:02,965 --> 00:38:06,975
a man appeared saying that he had killed the crown princess.

435
00:38:06,975 --> 00:38:09,395
And so, we are currently tracking him down.

436
00:38:09,395 --> 00:38:10,795
An inn...

437
00:38:10,795 --> 00:38:13,265
We drew a picture of his appearance based on the inn keeper's testimony

438
00:38:13,265 --> 00:38:15,205
and sent it to the Royal Investigation Bureau.

439
00:38:15,205 --> 00:38:18,235
And we are inspecting all the inns in Hanyang without notice,

440
00:38:18,235 --> 00:38:21,465
and checking the names and appearances of the people every day.

441
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:25,745
Then, will we be able to catch him?

442
00:38:36,895 --> 00:38:39,045
It's a crime to dishonor the crown princess of this nation.

443
00:38:39,045 --> 00:38:41,665
Do you think you could wash away this guilt in hell?

444
00:38:43,205 --> 00:38:45,365
More than the retribution of the Grim Reaper,

445
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:49,955
I fear for the future of Joseon stumbling because of one girl.

446
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:55,145
How could you say... that this is patriotism?

447
00:39:09,135 --> 00:39:12,825
I must reveal that the crown princess' death was murder, not suicide.

448
00:39:12,825 --> 00:39:15,415
Thus, we must also make sure to catch

449
00:39:15,415 --> 00:39:18,145
the person who was behind this!

450
00:39:36,305 --> 00:39:39,195
Is anyone out there?

451
00:39:39,195 --> 00:39:42,695
He woke up again...

452
00:39:43,955 --> 00:39:46,135
I will try going in.

453
00:39:50,035 --> 00:39:52,835
How do I get him to fall asleep this time?

454
00:39:59,495 --> 00:40:01,925
Aigoo.

455
00:40:01,925 --> 00:40:04,155
Why are you unable to fall asleep again?

456
00:40:04,155 --> 00:40:06,525
Oh, yes.

457
00:40:06,525 --> 00:40:09,395
Is the crown princess here by any chance?

458
00:40:10,985 --> 00:40:12,325
No.

459
00:40:15,085 --> 00:40:18,205
Gosh, what is that sound?

460
00:40:19,735 --> 00:40:22,565
So you are able to hear this sound.

461
00:40:29,145 --> 00:40:32,155
<i>Old man! Did you call me?</i>

462
00:40:33,065 --> 00:40:35,405
<i>You can hear this sound?</i>

463
00:40:35,405 --> 00:40:37,115
<i>I was over on that mountain, and I heard it.</i>

464
00:40:37,115 --> 00:40:39,555
<i>Only animals can hear this sound.</i>

465
00:40:39,555 --> 00:40:41,025
<i>Are you an animal?</i>

466
00:40:41,025 --> 00:40:43,175
<i>You didn't call me, then?</i>

467
00:40:46,275 --> 00:40:50,275
Is the apparition making this sound?

468
00:40:56,155 --> 00:40:59,965
I see there is a petty ghost in this palace somewhere.

469
00:40:59,965 --> 00:41:05,025
Instead of doing this, let us go together and find out where this sound is coming from.

470
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:12,905
Sure, some exercise is the best way of putting him down to bed.

471
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,455
Walk ahead of me.

472
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:21,595
Your Majesty, that would make me a disloyal servant.

473
00:41:21,595 --> 00:41:24,045
I have been learning some things lately...

474
00:41:24,045 --> 00:41:25,525
Then, walk next to me.

475
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:28,395
That would also be disloyal.

476
00:41:38,275 --> 00:41:40,085
Are you afraid?

477
00:41:40,995 --> 00:41:42,835
Afraid?

478
00:41:43,895 --> 00:41:45,385
Ribbit.

479
00:41:46,255 --> 00:41:47,905
Yes, go ahead.

480
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,265
It is a frog.

481
00:41:49,265 --> 00:41:51,885
Are you afraid of frogs, Your Majesty?

482
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:53,385
Did you summon me?

483
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,845
So Rang may channel the spirit again when she's with his majesty,

484
00:41:55,845 --> 00:41:59,445
so he asked for the other guardsmen to be dismissed.

485
00:42:01,985 --> 00:42:04,545
- Please go ahead.
- Stand next to me.

486
00:42:04,545 --> 00:42:05,965
Wasn't it you who made that sound?

487
00:42:05,965 --> 00:42:07,755
No, I did not.

488
00:42:14,595 --> 00:42:18,655
<i>Who's making this sound to scare his majesty?</i>

489
00:42:23,635 --> 00:42:25,795
Is So Rang here?

490
00:42:26,695 --> 00:42:28,515
Yes, Your Majesty!

491
00:42:34,045 --> 00:42:36,095
Is it the crown princess?

492
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,515
No, Sire.

493
00:42:38,405 --> 00:42:40,375
It's the water ghost.

494
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:44,535
I think some mountain animal has drowned.

495
00:42:45,265 --> 00:42:47,215
Then, can you lead the spirit to heaven?

496
00:42:47,215 --> 00:42:48,715
Oh, no...

497
00:42:48,715 --> 00:42:51,085
It's only a petty ghost.

498
00:42:51,085 --> 00:42:53,825
No life dies without a story to tell.

499
00:42:53,825 --> 00:42:59,405
Since you came in here as an exorcist to drive out apparitions, send that water spirit to a good place.

500
00:42:59,405 --> 00:43:01,895
Now, I have to get rid of this sound, too?

501
00:43:01,895 --> 00:43:03,375
Could you do it?

502
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:05,285
Yes, Your Majesty.

503
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:11,485
<i>Gosh, this isn't enough exercise for him.</i>

504
00:43:11,485 --> 00:43:14,375
<i>He'll never fall asleep at this rate.</i>

505
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:26,265
But Your Majesty, the fact that you could hear sounds like this

506
00:43:26,265 --> 00:43:28,705
means that your heart and body have weakened a lot.

507
00:43:28,705 --> 00:43:32,375
But the problem is that I could actually see that.

508
00:43:35,105 --> 00:43:37,415
You must not exercise, Sire.

509
00:43:37,415 --> 00:43:40,075
For a man...

510
00:43:41,105 --> 00:43:43,035
his body is everything.

511
00:43:52,685 --> 00:43:54,375
H-He looks pretty good, huh?

512
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:55,635
His muscles are all for show.

513
00:43:55,635 --> 00:43:58,565
A man should be strong and firm on the inside.

514
00:43:58,565 --> 00:43:59,515
Can you defeat him?

515
00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:01,505
- You think I'd lose?
- Come on...

516
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:03,995
Chief Lee Sin Won is a military officer.

517
00:44:03,995 --> 00:44:06,475
I think he'll be a great fighter.

518
00:44:06,475 --> 00:44:10,105
I used to win my fights, too!

519
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,225
- I used to.
- I'm sure people lost to you on purpose.

520
00:44:12,225 --> 00:44:15,395
- Haven't you heard of a loyalty match?
- Loyalty match?

521
00:44:19,335 --> 00:44:21,465
Sin Won!

522
00:44:26,925 --> 00:44:30,015
Shall we warm up a bit for first time in a while?

523
00:44:33,415 --> 00:44:36,450
But why all of a sudden at this late hour?

524
00:44:37,085 --> 00:44:40,765
In our past matches, have you ever gone easy on me?

525
00:44:40,765 --> 00:44:42,175
No, Sire.

526
00:44:42,175 --> 00:44:43,555
No, Your Majesty.

527
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:44,815
You have, I see.

528
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:46,315
But that was so long ago.

529
00:44:46,315 --> 00:44:48,505
I see.

530
00:44:48,505 --> 00:44:50,145
Is that so?

531
00:44:52,515 --> 00:44:55,715
Your Majesty, hold it a little higher.

532
00:44:57,815 --> 00:44:59,675
Why? So you can go easy on me again?

533
00:45:01,355 --> 00:45:03,705
Then, shall I defeat you, Your Majesty?

534
00:45:13,555 --> 00:45:15,325
Oh, my!

535
00:45:18,095 --> 00:45:19,155
Hey.

536
00:45:19,155 --> 00:45:22,205
Are you not... going to do this properly?

537
00:45:22,205 --> 00:45:23,775
It hurts, Your Majesty.

538
00:45:23,775 --> 00:45:27,475
All this time, did you see me as your friend or a king you must serve?

539
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,915
- I believed I was being proper.
- What?

540
00:45:29,915 --> 00:45:32,975
To hide your rusty skills.

541
00:45:32,975 --> 00:45:34,715
Rusty, huh?

542
00:45:53,965 --> 00:45:58,445
Of course. The most entertaining thing in the world is watching a fight.

543
00:46:01,785 --> 00:46:04,775
- Oh, my goodness...
- That Sin Won!

544
00:46:17,435 --> 00:46:19,945
Oh, this is so fun! Is there any makgeolli*?
<i>(Korean rice liquor)</i>

545
00:46:19,945 --> 00:46:21,475
It'd be perfect if I could have some makgeolli...

546
00:46:21,475 --> 00:46:24,585
Just one glass of—

547
00:46:24,585 --> 00:46:25,895
I'm sorry.

548
00:46:25,895 --> 00:46:29,095
How could she be so happy after putting us up against each other?

549
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:34,265
Aigoo...

550
00:46:43,935 --> 00:46:46,575
<i>- Your Majesty!</i>
- Your Majesty!

551
00:46:47,705 --> 00:46:50,075
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

552
00:46:51,915 --> 00:46:53,455
Get off me!

553
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,820
Of course.

554
00:47:04,445 --> 00:47:07,015
Do this next time as well.

555
00:47:07,015 --> 00:47:11,775
- Pardon?
- Will you see me as your friend or as your king?

556
00:47:15,665 --> 00:47:17,585
Don't let me win.

557
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:19,885
I will not lose next time, either.

558
00:47:20,815 --> 00:47:23,795
Aigoo, is this quite a spectacle? Let us go.

559
00:47:23,795 --> 00:47:25,255
Yes, Sire.

560
00:47:47,215 --> 00:47:48,625
I admit it.

561
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:51,215
A little bit. I'm just a little bit rusty.

562
00:47:51,215 --> 00:47:52,815
I can catch up to him with a bit of training.

563
00:47:52,815 --> 00:47:57,615
- I can win.
- By doing so, you'll get owned for real next time.

564
00:47:57,615 --> 00:47:58,875
G-Get owned?

565
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:00,125
You speak so...

566
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:04,615
But at a glance, I can tell Chief Shin Won... has a different form.

567
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:09,365
When he holds the wooden sword, the allure he oozes is... Wow...

568
00:48:09,365 --> 00:48:13,595
I mean, when he swings the sword like this, the picture he paints is...

569
00:48:13,595 --> 00:48:15,085
Oh dear, it's so...

570
00:48:15,085 --> 00:48:19,085
W-W-Who? Who? Him? Sin Won?

571
00:48:19,085 --> 00:48:22,275
I guess you do not know the real meaning of allure.

572
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:24,315
Your discernment is a bit...

573
00:48:25,225 --> 00:48:26,315
too lowly.

574
00:48:26,315 --> 00:48:30,385
I am sure you will soon ooze charm too, once you start training hard, Your Majesty.

575
00:49:03,025 --> 00:49:04,535
Why?

576
00:49:05,635 --> 00:49:08,815
Do you now understand

577
00:49:10,455 --> 00:49:12,285
what "allure" means?

578
00:49:23,415 --> 00:49:24,945
You laugh?

579
00:49:26,285 --> 00:49:29,245
You dare laugh when your king is speaking to you?

580
00:49:30,245 --> 00:49:34,625
Then, I shall fulfill my duty as a court lady.

581
00:49:36,605 --> 00:49:38,095
Please come here.

582
00:49:38,095 --> 00:49:42,015
No. It is only proper that I go to you.

583
00:49:42,735 --> 00:49:45,015
C-Come where? W-Why? What are you going to do?

584
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:46,925
W-Why? Go away! W-What?

585
00:49:46,925 --> 00:49:47,885
Why? You're going to take my pants off?

586
00:49:47,885 --> 00:49:49,585
Is that not the job of a court lady?

587
00:49:49,585 --> 00:49:51,255
They said you would cut my neck if I violate the rule.

588
00:49:51,255 --> 00:49:53,905
My neck is precious to me.

589
00:50:05,415 --> 00:50:07,435
He still won't sleep?

590
00:50:33,495 --> 00:50:39,190
So, for the last seven years, you have been all over the provinces of Joseon?

591
00:50:39,725 --> 00:50:43,285
My fate is destined to wander all over.

592
00:50:44,035 --> 00:50:46,565
So, what did you do?

593
00:50:46,565 --> 00:50:51,575
Well, I met all types of different people from all over.

594
00:50:52,575 --> 00:50:55,725
There are all kinds of interesting people in this world.

595
00:50:55,725 --> 00:50:57,350
Is that so?

596
00:50:57,945 --> 00:51:00,165
Then tell me some interesting stories.

597
00:51:00,165 --> 00:51:03,005
If it's not interesting, I will have you punished.

598
00:51:05,205 --> 00:51:10,645
All right then... shall I tell you some stories?

599
00:51:11,305 --> 00:51:17,125
A long time ago, a man walked around with a sword stuck in his chest as a punishment from the gods.

600
00:51:18,105 --> 00:51:20,625
How could a man walk around with a sword in his chest?

601
00:51:21,235 --> 00:51:22,805
He was not a man!

602
00:51:22,805 --> 00:51:25,030
He was a goblin!

603
00:51:33,205 --> 00:51:38,915
But only... the goblin bride could take that sword out of his chest*.
<i>(Plot of the k-drama "Goblin.")</i>

604
00:51:40,365 --> 00:51:42,655
<i>But what is the problem?</i>

605
00:51:42,655 --> 00:51:45,065
<i>The marriage ban was declared in this country.</i>

606
00:51:45,065 --> 00:51:48,435
<i>I mean, they had to get married to take out the sword or something.</i>

607
00:51:48,435 --> 00:51:52,465
<i>But in this country... even a goblin is an old bachelor.</i>

608
00:51:53,935 --> 00:51:55,575
Do you have another story to tell?

609
00:51:55,575 --> 00:51:57,625
Why? It's so-so?

610
00:51:57,625 --> 00:51:59,515
You want a different story?

611
00:52:00,065 --> 00:52:06,215
A long time ago, there was an inn that accepted only ghosts as guests*.
<i>(Plot of "Hotel Del Luna")</i>

612
00:52:07,385 --> 00:52:10,705
<i>The owner of that place was so terrible.</i>

613
00:52:10,705 --> 00:52:13,625
<i>She had lived for a long time but was a young woman.</i>

614
00:52:13,625 --> 00:52:15,805
<i>She loved to spend money.</i>

615
00:52:15,805 --> 00:52:21,125
<i>So, the owner was busy spending money and her employees were busy trying to stop her.</i>

616
00:52:22,665 --> 00:52:23,975
Please put it down.

617
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:25,805
So, how did she get so much money?

618
00:52:25,805 --> 00:52:27,115
How else?

619
00:52:27,115 --> 00:52:33,705
The resentment of ladies and bachelors who died virgins due to the marriage ban piled on a great deal!

620
00:52:33,705 --> 00:52:35,685
Why do all your stories reach that conclusion?

621
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:40,305
If Your Majesty would abolish the marriage ban and relieve the resentments of young virgins,

622
00:52:40,305 --> 00:52:44,645
even all the ghosts in this country will be happy...

623
00:52:44,645 --> 00:52:48,385
I know many stories, but they are all very melodramatic.

624
00:52:48,385 --> 00:52:50,285
So, is this fun?

625
00:52:50,285 --> 00:52:51,625
Do you want to hear more?

626
00:52:51,625 --> 00:52:53,095
Yes.

627
00:52:56,165 --> 00:52:58,475
<i>I think he'll fall asleep if I tell a little more.</i>

628
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:01,160
All right. Fine.

629
00:53:01,825 --> 00:53:07,855
A long time ago, a group of intense mothers lived in this neighborhood.

630
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:12,815
In that neighborhood, they did everything to make their sons pass the state exam...

631
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:17,135
Ever since they were young, they made them study many different things...
<i>(Plot of "SKY Castle")</i>

632
00:53:38,135 --> 00:53:39,680
What?

633
00:53:40,435 --> 00:53:42,585
What? Why are you here?

634
00:53:42,585 --> 00:53:45,935
I was wondering if you were in a deep sleep.

635
00:53:45,935 --> 00:53:49,005
But what is wrong with your condition?

636
00:53:49,005 --> 00:53:50,245
Pardon?

637
00:53:55,345 --> 00:53:58,245
You must have fought with some evil apparitions during the night!

638
00:53:59,865 --> 00:54:03,635
I have a hard time staying up all night.

639
00:54:06,595 --> 00:54:09,835
Anyway, I do feel much more light.

640
00:54:09,835 --> 00:54:14,395
Although I had a slightly strange dream, I slept well.

641
00:54:16,215 --> 00:54:19,825
I'm glad that... you were able to sleep comfortably.

642
00:54:19,825 --> 00:54:22,335
Go and get some rest if you're tired.

643
00:54:22,335 --> 00:54:23,785
Pardon?

644
00:54:23,785 --> 00:54:25,255
May I?

645
00:54:25,255 --> 00:54:27,685
Yes! Yes, Sire!

646
00:54:31,105 --> 00:54:33,055
Ouch! No, no...

647
00:54:38,035 --> 00:54:40,555
Are you channeling her spirit again?

648
00:54:40,555 --> 00:54:44,505
There still are many petty ghosts in the palace.

649
00:54:49,355 --> 00:54:51,875
In any case, she is so strange.

650
00:54:54,815 --> 00:54:59,315
Gosh, he looked like he got some good sleep, though.

651
00:54:59,315 --> 00:55:01,015
I'm glad.

652
00:55:04,825 --> 00:55:06,625
What in the world?

653
00:55:07,155 --> 00:55:10,535
There is a crazy bitch in the palace.

654
00:55:12,005 --> 00:55:14,105
T-That girl...

655
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:31,315
Was there a change in the list of inner court ladies?

656
00:55:31,315 --> 00:55:33,395
No, sir. There were no changes.

657
00:55:33,395 --> 00:55:36,105
Who is that girl who just walked out of the king's bedchamber?

658
00:55:36,105 --> 00:55:38,205
She is an inner court lady, Sun Ah.

659
00:55:38,205 --> 00:55:40,045
She has been in the palace for a long time.

660
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:43,325
There was a court lady like her before?

661
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:47,935
There are three shifts of inner court ladies, which change constantly.

662
00:55:47,935 --> 00:55:52,035
There is no way for you to know all of them.

663
00:55:52,035 --> 00:55:55,275
So, his majesty has not brought in someone new?

664
00:55:55,275 --> 00:55:56,995
Of course not.

665
00:55:56,995 --> 00:55:59,975
You know how his majesty is.

666
00:56:01,315 --> 00:56:04,295
All right. Carry on.

667
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:23,855
I just heard that she finished her shift.

668
00:56:23,855 --> 00:56:25,085
Why are you walking like that?

669
00:56:25,085 --> 00:56:27,275
I told you you would lose your neck if you violated the rules!

670
00:56:27,275 --> 00:56:29,755
I was on my knees all through the night.

671
00:56:29,755 --> 00:56:31,935
So, I cannot control my own legs.

672
00:56:31,935 --> 00:56:34,245
I mean, this is...

673
00:56:34,755 --> 00:56:37,155
I think it's best to put her to bed.

674
00:56:38,115 --> 00:56:40,025
Get on my back.

675
00:57:19,515 --> 00:57:21,775
Wake up. Wake up!

676
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:22,865
Come to your senses!

677
00:57:22,865 --> 00:57:24,720
Hurry up and wake up!

678
00:57:27,005 --> 00:57:29,915
You do not disturb even a dog when it's sleeping.

679
00:57:29,915 --> 00:57:33,255
Did I not tell you to behave carefully at all times?

680
00:57:33,255 --> 00:57:37,685
How crappy did you behave that he asked me who the lady was!

681
00:57:38,075 --> 00:57:39,995
I stayed up all night. What can I do?

682
00:57:39,995 --> 00:57:43,345
Gosh, this palace life doesn't suit me at all. I should try to run away or something.

683
00:57:43,345 --> 00:57:47,005
How dare you. Only a good beating will set you straight!

684
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,335
Aigoo!

685
00:57:48,335 --> 00:57:50,425
Court Lady Won!

686
00:57:51,945 --> 00:57:53,965
You know...

687
00:57:57,205 --> 00:57:59,105
your personality changed after coming into the palace, did it not?

688
00:57:59,105 --> 00:58:00,845
This thought keeps coming to my mind.

689
00:58:00,845 --> 00:58:07,765
Although you're strict and scary like a tiger, I suspect that you were not always like that.

690
00:58:08,275 --> 00:58:11,375
I mean, I can just tell at a glance!

691
00:58:11,375 --> 00:58:17,045
When Court Lady Won was single, so many men must have been dying to be with you.

692
00:58:17,045 --> 00:58:21,035
You must have been so pretty as a flower.

693
00:58:21,035 --> 00:58:22,675
You...

694
00:58:23,415 --> 00:58:26,115
sure know how to read people.

695
00:58:26,955 --> 00:58:31,955
I was unbelievably pretty before I got married.

696
00:58:33,975 --> 00:58:40,095
Love surely... came to me like destiny.

697
00:58:42,175 --> 00:58:44,415
<i>Have my child for me.</i>

698
00:58:45,395 --> 00:58:48,575
<i>All you talk about is proper customs and rules.</i>

699
00:58:48,575 --> 00:58:52,895
<i>You fell in love where custom and rules have no place!</i>

700
00:58:52,895 --> 00:58:54,665
<i>Enter the palace?</i>

701
00:58:54,665 --> 00:58:58,495
<i>The palace urgently needs a wet nurse court lady.</i>

702
00:58:58,495 --> 00:59:00,815
<i>They want the best wet nurse in Joseon.</i>

703
00:59:00,815 --> 00:59:02,305
You're the best.

704
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:06,655
<i>But I heard you cannot leave the palace once you go in.</i>

705
00:59:09,685 --> 00:59:12,645
<i>Dear husband...</i>

706
00:59:18,435 --> 00:59:20,965
Do you know how much I miss them?

707
00:59:20,965 --> 00:59:24,035
I wonder how my son grew up to be...

708
00:59:24,035 --> 00:59:28,865
So, to summarize, Court Lady Won...

709
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:31,425
you're saying that, among all the court ladies who are forbidden to marry,

710
00:59:31,425 --> 00:59:36,655
you're the only one who knows the fun of the boom-bop beat rhythm between a man and a woman.

711
00:59:36,655 --> 00:59:39,395
What's a boom-bop beat?

712
00:59:39,395 --> 00:59:41,075
By chance...!

713
00:59:41,075 --> 00:59:45,105
How can you speak of such a profane thing?

714
00:59:46,695 --> 00:59:48,605
This current state of affairs

715
00:59:48,605 --> 00:59:51,595
desperately calls for your experience and knowledge, Court Lady Won!

716
00:59:51,595 --> 00:59:55,695
How could silly novices seduce the king, become the king's women, and produce an heir?

717
00:59:55,695 --> 01:00:00,965
From now on, all the women in this palace must be aggressive and make the first move—

718
01:00:01,915 --> 01:00:03,805
Who is there?

719
01:00:06,725 --> 01:00:09,065
Ah, you scared me.

720
01:00:09,065 --> 01:00:13,225
What were you talking about that you were having so much fun?

721
01:00:14,785 --> 01:00:21,035
We were talking about the boom-bop beat game that a woman and a man secretly enjoy at night.

722
01:00:21,035 --> 01:00:22,955
Boom-bop beat?

723
01:00:22,955 --> 01:00:26,535
You're talking about that game where the rhythm is crucial?

724
01:00:26,535 --> 01:00:28,275
How dare you get so chatty like that?

725
01:00:28,275 --> 01:00:29,975
You should keep your mouth shut!

726
01:00:29,975 --> 01:00:33,115
So, what brings you all the way here?

727
01:00:33,115 --> 01:00:36,845
Did you not say So Rang should hang her belongings?

728
01:00:36,845 --> 01:00:40,035
I'm confident when it comes to penetration.

729
01:00:40,035 --> 01:00:41,725
What did you say?*
<i>(Sounds like the word "nail" in Korean)</i>

730
01:00:42,485 --> 01:00:44,245
A nail.

731
01:00:45,925 --> 01:00:48,925
Oh... t-there...

732
01:01:45,015 --> 01:01:48,465
I'm a stronger man than you'd think.

733
01:01:48,985 --> 01:01:51,315
Why do I feel so hot?

734
01:01:53,975 --> 01:01:55,935
I will get going now.

735
01:01:55,935 --> 01:01:58,685
Finished already?

736
01:02:05,175 --> 01:02:08,365
Why are you sweating so much?

737
01:02:08,365 --> 01:02:11,265
You're not the one who nailed it to the wall.

738
01:02:11,265 --> 01:02:13,945
N-No... It's nothing...

739
01:02:13,945 --> 01:02:16,975
<i>You may not believe it, but I'm the best.</i>

740
01:02:16,975 --> 01:02:20,305
<i>The master of bringing love together.</i>

741
01:02:20,305 --> 01:02:22,445
Only if those parts weren't missing...

742
01:02:22,445 --> 01:02:24,115
What?

743
01:02:25,185 --> 01:02:26,625
What's missing?

744
01:02:26,625 --> 01:02:28,025
Well?

745
01:02:28,025 --> 01:02:29,985
What was missing again?

746
01:02:52,255 --> 01:02:55,465
The sun sets tonight once again like this.

747
01:02:56,285 --> 01:02:58,085
Crown Princess...

748
01:02:59,235 --> 01:03:01,125
Ja Yeon...

749
01:03:06,105 --> 01:03:09,275
I will die calling out your name.

750
01:03:10,865 --> 01:03:13,865
Ayo, why does he keep asking for me?

751
01:03:13,865 --> 01:03:16,825
Is he having fun tormenting me?

752
01:03:16,825 --> 01:03:19,045
Aigoo, aigoo...

753
01:03:23,305 --> 01:03:25,575
Goodness...

754
01:03:51,415 --> 01:03:52,755
<i>The king has been castrated?</i>

755
01:03:52,755 --> 01:03:54,265
<i>The king has been castrated! </i>

756
01:03:54,265 --> 01:03:57,475
<i>What did I ever do wrong, to be born in a country where the king has been castrated</i>

757
01:03:57,475 --> 01:04:00,195
<i>and I have to live forever as though I've been castrated myself!</i>

758
01:04:00,195 --> 01:04:02,805
<i>- Damn it!</i>
- Aigoo!

759
01:04:04,325 --> 01:04:07,755
He must be upset after reading malicious petitions like this.

760
01:04:07,755 --> 01:04:11,955
If he hates these false rumors, he should father an heir quickly.

761
01:04:11,955 --> 01:04:15,225
Why does he insist on living a life of celibacy all by himself?

762
01:04:15,225 --> 01:04:18,115
There are so many pretty court ladies in the palace.

763
01:04:21,295 --> 01:04:23,055
By chance...

764
01:04:23,595 --> 01:04:26,280
is it really not working?

765
01:04:26,785 --> 01:04:28,615
So Rang.

766
01:04:33,725 --> 01:04:34,915
<i>What the?</i>

767
01:04:34,915 --> 01:04:37,965
<i>Why is he looking at me so pitifully all of a sudden?</i>

768
01:04:37,965 --> 01:04:39,075
Y-Yes?

769
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:41,385
By chance, is your body ready?

770
01:04:41,385 --> 01:04:44,105
Is it possible now?

771
01:04:46,425 --> 01:04:48,775
M-My body?

772
01:04:48,775 --> 01:04:50,405
<i>Does this prove that the king is not castrated?</i>

773
01:04:50,405 --> 01:04:52,245
<i>He's saying I'm a temporary palace lady, too?</i>

774
01:04:52,245 --> 01:04:56,995
<i>If so, the reason he's urgently asking for me is to... become his woman?</i>

775
01:04:56,995 --> 01:04:59,325
I'm speaking of spirit channeling.

776
01:05:01,575 --> 01:05:03,175
Pardon?

777
01:05:08,835 --> 01:05:13,435
But I cannot do that any time I want to, Sire.

778
01:05:13,435 --> 01:05:19,595
I mean, if you summon her so often like this, Her Royal Highness the crown princess cannot rest comfortably.

779
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:25,035
Do you miss her a lot?

780
01:05:25,035 --> 01:05:27,915
I think I will start crying...

781
01:05:27,915 --> 01:05:30,525
You cannot cry, Sire.

782
01:05:32,245 --> 01:05:33,695
<i>What should I do?</i>

783
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:36,785
<i>I shouldn't keep conning him.</i>

784
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,125
Argh!

785
01:05:44,155 --> 01:05:48,735
In the future, you cannot summon her so often.

786
01:05:55,575 --> 01:06:00,135
Your Highness, have you been well?

787
01:06:18,415 --> 01:06:21,260
Is it really you, Crown Princess?

788
01:06:21,775 --> 01:06:24,485
Why did you summon me?

789
01:06:27,955 --> 01:06:29,625
Just...

790
01:06:31,005 --> 01:06:35,580
I want to dream of you tonight, Crown Princess.

791
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:41,435
You promised me that you will let me ascend.

792
01:06:44,195 --> 01:06:46,545
I know we should part ways

793
01:06:48,855 --> 01:06:51,840
but I do not think I can do that.

794
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,105
You must

795
01:06:54,685 --> 01:06:56,905
become stronger, Your Highness.

796
01:06:56,905 --> 01:07:01,545
Train hard in martial arts and enjoy your meals.

797
01:07:01,545 --> 01:07:06,375
So that... I may depart with my heart at ease.

798
01:07:06,375 --> 01:07:08,565
Aside from you, Crown Princess,

799
01:07:09,665 --> 01:07:13,545
I do not think I can be with anyone else.

800
01:07:20,565 --> 01:07:22,115
You already are...

801
01:07:23,095 --> 01:07:26,355
with this girl now.

802
01:07:30,445 --> 01:07:33,405
I merely have your shadow, Crown Princess.

803
01:07:41,305 --> 01:07:42,725
If so,

804
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:51,115
at some point... you will also have to distance this shadow.

805
01:07:51,115 --> 01:07:58,675
Could you promise me that you will... forget me?

806
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:04,115
I do not want to.

807
01:08:04,115 --> 01:08:06,115
Please forget me.

808
01:08:06,795 --> 01:08:08,865
Without any trace.

809
01:08:10,415 --> 01:08:12,475
Please erase me from your heart.

810
01:08:16,845 --> 01:08:19,175
Just a little longer...

811
01:08:19,175 --> 01:08:21,445
Please stay a little longer...

812
01:08:22,325 --> 01:08:24,835
Please don't leave me...

813
01:08:40,155 --> 01:08:42,395
That was too short...

814
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:08,320
♫ <i>This night where even the moon sleeps</i> ♫

815
01:09:09,065 --> 01:09:13,915
<i>Going forward... do I need to be here like this?</i>

816
01:09:13,915 --> 01:09:19,275
<i>As the shadow of a woman this man cannot forget?</i>

817
01:09:20,975 --> 01:09:24,815
♫ <i>Without saying a word</i> ♫

818
01:09:24,815 --> 01:09:30,320
♫ <i>Where are you going in such a rush?</i> ♫

819
01:09:32,245 --> 01:09:36,645
<i>Continually like this?</i>

820
01:09:45,985 --> 01:09:48,795
Your hands look like hers.

821
01:09:48,795 --> 01:10:02,190
♫ <i>Foolishly, I still cannot let go of you even for a moment</i> ♫

822
01:10:03,395 --> 01:10:06,795
♫ <i>I am so sorry</i> ♫

823
01:10:06,795 --> 01:10:10,725
♫ <i>It is all my fault</i> ♫

824
01:10:10,725 --> 01:10:18,065
♫ <i>Please visit me even for a moment</i> ♫

825
01:10:18,065 --> 01:10:24,490
♫ <i>How can I forget you?</i> ♫

826
01:10:25,325 --> 01:10:31,900
♫ <i>How can I forget you?</i> ♫

827
01:10:32,575 --> 01:10:41,290
♫ <i>You torment me by coming to me every night in my dream</i> ♫

828
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:44,355
<i>The Forbidden Marriage
Preview</i>

829
01:10:44,355 --> 01:10:45,865
<i>Please come down, my lady.</i>

830
01:10:45,865 --> 01:10:49,385
<i>Does he know that I'm Hyeon Seon or not?</i>

831
01:10:49,385 --> 01:10:52,085
<i>I found out who is making that sound!</i>

832
01:10:52,085 --> 01:10:54,415
<i>I did it, Sire!</i>

833
01:10:54,415 --> 01:10:56,245
<i>How about attending military training?</i>

834
01:10:56,245 --> 01:10:57,205
<i>It's been seven years.</i>

835
01:10:57,205 --> 01:10:58,855
<i>- Shoot!
- You scared me!</i>

836
01:10:58,855 --> 01:11:02,245
<i>He brought her here even dressing her up as a man?</i>

837
01:11:02,245 --> 01:11:04,785
<i>Find out who that court lady is.</i>

838
01:11:04,785 --> 01:11:08,135
<i>By chance, are there real wild boars here?</i>

839
01:11:08,135 --> 01:11:09,815
<i>Do not worry.</i>

840
01:11:09,815 --> 01:11:12,590
<i>I will protect you, Your Majesty.</i>
