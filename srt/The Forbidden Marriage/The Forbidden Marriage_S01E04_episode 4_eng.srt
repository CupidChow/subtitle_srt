1
00:00:35,267 --> 00:00:39,897
 This is a work of fiction. Characters, incidents, settings, titles, and content have no relevance to real life.

2
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:46,163
If half-asleep, is it all right to kiss, then?

3
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,620

4
00:01:14,163 --> 00:01:16,393
Wh-Who... Who are you, sir?

5
00:01:16,393 --> 00:01:19,003
Speak, if you want to live.

6
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:23,833
What exactly did you witness in there?

7
00:01:32,823 --> 00:01:35,113
I brought some clean towels.

8
00:01:35,113 --> 00:01:37,863
Yes... Sure.

9
00:01:39,403 --> 00:01:43,043
Now... you may take over.

10
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,170
 Episode 4

11
00:02:14,383 --> 00:02:16,113
 Your Majesty.

12
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:32,633
 Your Majesty.

13
00:02:40,463 --> 00:02:42,543
 Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

14
00:03:06,023 --> 00:03:08,083
I am bored...

15
00:03:09,893 --> 00:03:11,803
Are you saying the king caught

16
00:03:11,803 --> 00:03:13,753
a wild boar on the hunting grounds by himself?

17
00:03:13,753 --> 00:03:15,673
Yes, Your Highness.

18
00:03:15,673 --> 00:03:17,493
Oh, daebak!

19
00:03:17,493 --> 00:03:20,953
It seems the red ginseng extract is working its magic.

20
00:03:20,953 --> 00:03:23,943
Go and tell the royal physician to make the king drink more of it.

21
00:03:23,943 --> 00:03:27,813
However, there are medically outlined proper amounts and usage for the extract...

22
00:03:27,853 --> 00:03:30,163
What does that matter?

23
00:03:30,163 --> 00:03:34,093
As long as the king's body is stronger, that's all that matters.

24
00:03:45,023 --> 00:03:46,943
How are you feeling?

25
00:03:46,943 --> 00:03:51,553
Thanks to Chief Sin Won, who nursed me with great care at the hunting grounds,

26
00:03:51,553 --> 00:03:53,193
I healed completely from my illness.

27
00:03:53,193 --> 00:03:55,753
But that's...   Wait a second.

28
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,383
 She doesn't remember what happened that night?

29
00:03:59,383 --> 00:04:02,073
 Was it the effect of the medicine?

30
00:04:02,073 --> 00:04:06,333
So, how is your head injury?

31
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:10,343
It worries me that it has worsened your inherent lack of knowledge.

32
00:04:11,303 --> 00:04:13,273
No specific changes in my knowledge, but—

33
00:04:13,273 --> 00:04:15,713
I did not expect anything to change in that department anyway.

34
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:19,923
My skill levels have fallen a bit.

35
00:04:19,923 --> 00:04:23,453
I do not think I will be able to predict the weather and things like that anymore.

36
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:27,543
You sure sound so confident saying you cannot do something.

37
00:04:27,543 --> 00:04:30,633
From the start, you entered the palace to comfort the spirit of the crown princess.

38
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:35,853
So, from now on, focus on just that.

39
00:04:35,853 --> 00:04:38,573
Yes, I shall do as you say.

40
00:04:47,123 --> 00:04:50,733
By the way, I've heard that when I left you unattended,

41
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:54,123
you were unable to get good sleep, Your Majesty.

42
00:04:54,123 --> 00:04:58,183
Well, I'm not that sleepy today, either.

43
00:04:58,183 --> 00:05:01,143
 How can I put him to sleep...

44
00:05:06,713 --> 00:05:08,083
Your Majesty.

45
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:11,410
What now? You make me nervous. Huh?

46
00:05:12,923 --> 00:05:16,923
Would you like to have a drink with me?

47
00:05:17,563 --> 00:05:18,763
This late at night?

48
00:05:18,763 --> 00:05:22,793
Usually, a drink or two helps when you are unable to sleep.

49
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:30,023
Never mind, then.

50
00:05:30,023 --> 00:05:32,583
They say those who have weak tolerance avoid drinking.

51
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,993
Who says I have weak tolerance?

52
00:05:33,993 --> 00:05:37,673
Isn't that a weak man who hesitates at an offer of a drink?

53
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:42,293
You are asking for a proper drinking session with me tonight, aren't you?

54
00:05:42,293 --> 00:05:45,343
I have spent most of my life wandering like an itinerant vendor.

55
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:50,033
When it comes to alcohol, I surely do not lose to anyone.

56
00:05:52,243 --> 00:05:57,133
Tonight... you will end up crawling out of here on all fours.

57
00:05:57,133 --> 00:06:02,400
♫   Just where does that happen?  ♫

58
00:06:48,793 --> 00:06:52,693
Your Majesty. Just drinking like this is no fun.

59
00:06:52,693 --> 00:06:56,663
Why don't we play a game? A game of truth or drink.

60
00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:58,423
We will take turns asking questions,

61
00:06:58,423 --> 00:07:01,153
and the one who cannot answer must drink.

62
00:07:01,153 --> 00:07:02,953
There is no reason for me to lose.

63
00:07:02,953 --> 00:07:05,963
I could say the same for myself.

64
00:07:11,003 --> 00:07:13,203
Tell me, then...

65
00:07:19,743 --> 00:07:21,843
how much do you weigh?

66
00:07:21,843 --> 00:07:25,183
Your Majesty, have you played this game before?

67
00:07:30,803 --> 00:07:35,293
Your Majesty... ever since the crown princess passed away,

68
00:07:35,293 --> 00:07:38,273
have you ever slept with a woman?

69
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:47,263
Does one usually throw tough questions like this?

70
00:07:49,923 --> 00:07:51,563
Please drink, Your Majesty.

71
00:07:51,563 --> 00:07:53,333
I have not.

72
00:07:54,243 --> 00:07:56,483
Pardon? A-Are you serious?

73
00:07:56,483 --> 00:07:58,143
- I said I haven't. 
 - But why?

74
00:07:58,143 --> 00:08:00,153
I just haven't. That's all.

75
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:08,613
So... Tell me,

76
00:08:16,673 --> 00:08:19,833
who is Sin Won to you?

77
00:08:22,193 --> 00:08:25,323
Though there is a difference in age and status between us,

78
00:08:25,323 --> 00:08:26,753
we have decided to be friends.

79
00:08:26,753 --> 00:08:28,943
Anything else?

80
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:30,643
As Your Majesty has ordered,

81
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:35,373
he is responsible for my safety as I channel the spirit of the crown princess.

82
00:08:39,323 --> 00:08:41,153
Anything else?

83
00:08:43,693 --> 00:08:47,103
He has saved my life.

84
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,023
Is there anything else?

85
00:08:51,893 --> 00:08:56,023
 I almost married him.

86
00:08:56,023 --> 00:08:57,853
 If it weren't for the Marriage Ban Edict,

87
00:08:57,853 --> 00:09:00,873
 we may have become husband and wife.

88
00:09:01,863 --> 00:09:03,693
Nothing more,

89
00:09:04,763 --> 00:09:06,883
nothing less.

90
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:11,223
- Drink up. 
 - But it is not a lie.

91
00:09:11,223 --> 00:09:13,583
Nor is it the truth.

92
00:09:34,003 --> 00:09:36,023
Are there times that Your Majesty

93
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:44,203
sees me as the crown princess?

94
00:10:05,643 --> 00:10:07,393
No.

95
00:10:10,783 --> 00:10:14,653
You are not speaking the truth. Please drink.

96
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,263
No need to make things complicated.

97
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:34,943
If I hadn't been confused,

98
00:10:34,943 --> 00:10:37,323
nothing would have happened.

99
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:43,293
I no longer have any love, desire, or lust

100
00:10:44,193 --> 00:10:46,273
remaining inside of me.

101
00:10:49,063 --> 00:10:51,773
Those things Your Majesty has lost,

102
00:10:51,773 --> 00:10:56,023
love, desire, and lust...

103
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:58,753
Shall I go and find them for you?

104
00:10:58,753 --> 00:11:00,273
What?

105
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:07,693
I... can confidently say that I am the best in Joseon regarding such matters.

106
00:11:07,693 --> 00:11:11,443
I am very... well-versed in it.

107
00:11:13,903 --> 00:11:15,363
I will help you, Your Majesty.

108
00:11:15,363 --> 00:11:17,683
Melting that cold heart of yours

109
00:11:17,683 --> 00:11:19,683
will be the key to ending this nation's marriage ban.

110
00:11:19,683 --> 00:11:21,993
It will bring an heir to the throne of Joseon

111
00:11:21,993 --> 00:11:24,323
and it will bring peace to the people of this nation.

112
00:11:24,323 --> 00:11:27,273
Therefore, this work I am about to do as Your Majesty's vassal

113
00:11:27,273 --> 00:11:31,563
is something that must be done for the sake of Joseon, is it not?

114
00:11:32,463 --> 00:11:34,133
Now that I think about it,

115
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:37,683
there is no greater patriot than me. Is that not so?

116
00:11:37,683 --> 00:11:40,423
Don't even think about it. What absurdities you will bring about?

117
00:11:40,423 --> 00:11:44,603
Here, on behalf of Joseon, please take a glass.

118
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:47,013
So, why haven't you been emptying your glass from earlier?

119
00:11:47,013 --> 00:11:50,663
Oh, my, what are you talking about, Your Majesty...

120
00:11:53,263 --> 00:11:55,503
You must not let your guard down at all.

121
00:11:55,503 --> 00:11:57,703
- Do you understand?
 - Yes, sir.

122
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:10,180
Do not miss them. Be ready for a long journey.

123
00:12:13,493 --> 00:12:15,303
Just how far are we going?

124
00:12:15,303 --> 00:12:17,423
I'm exhausted already!

125
00:12:17,423 --> 00:12:19,803
Are you sure he's around here?

126
00:12:19,803 --> 00:12:22,653
Just a little bit further, we will see a house lit by a lamp.

127
00:12:22,653 --> 00:12:24,343
You keep saying, "a little bit more, a little bit more."

128
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,363
The sun has gone down already!

129
00:12:26,363 --> 00:12:28,743
The lamp! The lamp!

130
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,473
Aigoo. Is he the one?

131
00:12:36,473 --> 00:12:40,533
That is correct. It is he whom they speak of.

132
00:12:43,983 --> 00:12:45,593
Who goes there?

133
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,383
Painter Jeong, we came here upon hearing the rumors.

134
00:12:49,383 --> 00:12:51,063
If that is the name you've come for,

135
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:53,863
you have come to the wrong place.

136
00:12:57,303 --> 00:13:00,013
Wait, are you studying right now?

137
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,953
I have quit painting.

138
00:13:01,953 --> 00:13:03,213
The more unstable this country becomes,

139
00:13:03,213 --> 00:13:06,413
taking the exam to become a civil servant is the best way to a secure future.

140
00:13:06,413 --> 00:13:07,573
Secure future?

141
00:13:07,573 --> 00:13:09,643
So, you plan to succeed through studying?

142
00:13:09,643 --> 00:13:11,033
To achieve fame and success through the state examination?

143
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:13,443
That is the fate of this generation, is it not?

144
00:13:13,443 --> 00:13:17,683
The land is in chaos, and everyone is looking for a stable position.

145
00:13:17,683 --> 00:13:20,823
We have no choice but to give up on at least three things.

146
00:13:23,393 --> 00:13:24,593
Love.

147
00:13:24,593 --> 00:13:25,573
Marriage.

148
00:13:25,573 --> 00:13:27,613
- And having children*.
 - Aigoo! 
 (Reference to the 21th century phenomenon "sampo generation")

149
00:13:27,613 --> 00:13:30,703
Furthermore, if we give up on owning my own home and interpersonal relationships,

150
00:13:30,703 --> 00:13:32,683
that would make it five.

151
00:13:32,683 --> 00:13:34,333
And adding hopes and dreams to that list,

152
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,413
now that makes seven...

153
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:36,663
I could never give up!

154
00:13:36,663 --> 00:13:39,223
Human beings were meant to live and mate with one another.

155
00:13:39,223 --> 00:13:41,473
The country that forbids marriage is the crazy one!

156
00:13:41,473 --> 00:13:44,743
Deok Hun, just a second.

157
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,843
No matter how I see it,

158
00:13:47,843 --> 00:13:51,373
he seems like a fallen nobleman or a long-term repeater of the state exam.

159
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:54,333
Why go to such lengths to respect him?

160
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,933
Idiot.

161
00:13:56,573 --> 00:13:58,423
Take a look at this book of paintings.

162
00:13:58,423 --> 00:14:01,623
What about it, they are all the same.

163
00:14:08,003 --> 00:14:10,503
There's even a story to it!

164
00:14:10,503 --> 00:14:13,883
With this, for us, Birth Sul Ro's, who have turned into rocks,

165
00:14:13,883 --> 00:14:17,183
will be able to revive our love, desire, and lust!

166
00:14:17,183 --> 00:14:21,863
I plan to revive the Born Sul Ro Group by sharing this work!

167
00:14:22,623 --> 00:14:27,843
Painter Jeong, please use your work for the Born Sul Ro Group to protest the Marriage Ban Edict!

168
00:14:27,843 --> 00:14:29,583
Yes, please use it for Born Sul Ro Group!

169
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:33,493
I said I'm now devoted to my studies.

170
00:14:33,493 --> 00:14:34,973
I will give you 50% of the earnings.

171
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:37,543
I cannot let that stop my path to learning.

172
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,743
- I will pay you a very generous advance.
 - Enough!

173
00:14:39,743 --> 00:14:41,993
I said I do not need such things!

174
00:14:43,143 --> 00:14:45,223
I will introduce you to a woman.

175
00:14:45,223 --> 00:14:46,873
How many volumes do you need?

176
00:14:46,873 --> 00:14:51,393
Our last hunting trip was not entirely pointless.

177
00:14:51,393 --> 00:14:54,863
There is someone suspicious by your side.

178
00:14:54,863 --> 00:14:57,443
Who is that person?

179
00:15:30,283 --> 00:15:33,133
If so, arrest him immediately...

180
00:15:35,713 --> 00:15:37,353
No...

181
00:15:38,613 --> 00:15:42,113
We must first hide the fact that we have caught on.

182
00:15:42,113 --> 00:15:43,273
You are right, Your Majesty.

183
00:15:43,273 --> 00:15:45,563
We must backtrack that way.

184
00:15:45,563 --> 00:15:49,623
How is it that even the captain of the Royal Guards has been bought off?

185
00:15:49,623 --> 00:15:52,153
I will start investigating him first.

186
00:15:52,153 --> 00:15:56,933
I am sure there is some connection to the three murders that took place

187
00:15:56,933 --> 00:15:59,143
in the last seven years in the palace.

188
00:15:59,143 --> 00:16:01,183
There is no one...

189
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:05,543
I can trust in this palace.

190
00:16:06,323 --> 00:16:10,813
Your Majesty, you have Chief Sin Won by your side.

191
00:16:13,903 --> 00:16:15,883
Yes, you are right.

192
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,923
I have Sin Won, at the very least,

193
00:16:23,223 --> 00:16:25,243
and I should trust him to the end.

194
00:16:32,943 --> 00:16:35,503
What are you thinking about so deeply?

195
00:16:35,503 --> 00:16:37,183
Sin Won,

196
00:16:37,753 --> 00:16:42,453
when do a man's love, desire, and lust become most explosive?

197
00:16:42,453 --> 00:16:43,833
W-W-What?

198
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:49,453
Have you recently had some secret feelings you held inside, erupt incontrollably?

199
00:16:54,003 --> 00:16:56,423
W-Why are you saying such a strange thing without blushing, so early in the morning?

200
00:16:56,423 --> 00:16:58,483
Don't men instinctively do so?

201
00:16:58,483 --> 00:17:00,953
Even in the morning, you... instinctively

202
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,503
Hey, you!

203
00:17:02,503 --> 00:17:04,873
What in the world are you thinking about?

204
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:09,323
That is what I think about every day.

205
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:15,983
Why? Are you not satisfied?

206
00:17:15,983 --> 00:17:17,963
Aigoo, what do you mean, not satisfied?

207
00:17:17,963 --> 00:17:22,183
They look like a perfectly compatible pair of lovebirds.

208
00:17:22,183 --> 00:17:25,753
In our family, they say my cousin here is the prettie—

209
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:34,183
Take a look at yourself. He looks like a crab shell turned over.

210
00:17:35,283 --> 00:17:36,573
Crab shell?

211
00:17:36,573 --> 00:17:37,883
Crab shell?

212
00:17:37,883 --> 00:17:40,583
Wow... Born Sul Ro Group or whatever...

213
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,703
I will never work with you and your group.

214
00:17:42,703 --> 00:17:44,143
What are you saying?

215
00:17:44,143 --> 00:17:48,323
- When it comes to women—
 - How can you say that?

216
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:49,383
Hurry and go apologize—

217
00:17:49,383 --> 00:17:53,533
But still, if you show your disappointment in front of a lady, she will get hurt.

218
00:18:06,113 --> 00:18:07,843
Even if you do not like her,

219
00:18:07,843 --> 00:18:11,153
why didn't you try to carry on a conversation with her?

220
00:18:11,153 --> 00:18:13,013
Oh, t-that's...

221
00:18:13,013 --> 00:18:14,543
That... That is...

222
00:18:14,543 --> 00:18:16,923
Hae Yeong, can you get me some cold water?

223
00:18:16,923 --> 00:18:20,003
- Oh, my, Eonni, you're here.
 - Yes.

224
00:18:23,793 --> 00:18:26,653
In my opinion, rather than your cousin,

225
00:18:26,653 --> 00:18:28,883
he seems to like this one.

226
00:18:31,923 --> 00:18:34,113
- Whoa!
 - Aah, you scared me.

227
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:41,763
I don't think I would just sit around and do nothing if it were me.

228
00:18:41,763 --> 00:18:44,523
- Who are you? 
 - Have you forgotten what kind of teahouse this is?

229
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,463
The art of compatibility is

230
00:18:46,463 --> 00:18:49,543
where one person can be connected to another.

231
00:18:49,543 --> 00:18:54,123
Then, are you saying there is a way I can find a connection with that maiden?

232
00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:57,373
If it were me, I would...

233
00:18:57,373 --> 00:18:59,923
first try bumping into her.

234
00:18:59,923 --> 00:19:02,163
Daebak... Bump into her, he says...

235
00:19:02,163 --> 00:19:04,973
Now, when she comes here with the cup of tea,

236
00:19:04,973 --> 00:19:07,323
spill the contents by bumping into her.

237
00:19:07,323 --> 00:19:08,633
- The clothes will get wet, right?
 - Yes.

238
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:10,473
Then, you take her to a fabric store.

239
00:19:10,473 --> 00:19:12,343
And then, you say, "Here, pick and choose.

240
00:19:12,343 --> 00:19:14,913
It will all be yours."

241
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,813
- Does that actually work? 
 - Truly?

242
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:21,423
- Hurry! Hurry! Before she comes out.
 - Right now? Right now?

243
00:19:21,423 --> 00:19:23,513
I think she just stepped out.

244
00:19:26,303 --> 00:19:28,593
Fighting.

245
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:41,623
Aigoo, Maiden, I am so sorry.

246
00:19:42,623 --> 00:19:46,213
Maiden... are you all right?

247
00:19:57,883 --> 00:20:00,073
Oh, dear.

248
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,253
Catch him!

249
00:20:10,323 --> 00:20:12,173
Hey!

250
00:20:13,953 --> 00:20:16,063
Who the hell is that crazy woman?

251
00:20:20,283 --> 00:20:23,203
Hey, Sin Won. Good thing you're here.

252
00:20:23,203 --> 00:20:24,823
That jerk! Catch that jerk! Hurry!

253
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,293
W-W-Why? What's going on?

254
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:27,843
Quick! Just move quickly!

255
00:20:27,843 --> 00:20:29,363
Hurry!

256
00:20:32,783 --> 00:20:34,893
Why are they following me?

257
00:20:34,893 --> 00:20:36,473
Why are they...

258
00:20:36,473 --> 00:20:38,823
Go! Go!

259
00:20:43,593 --> 00:20:45,293
Hurry!

260
00:21:02,643 --> 00:21:04,833
We caught him!

261
00:21:10,813 --> 00:21:12,163
Whoa... This is...

262
00:21:12,163 --> 00:21:15,103
It even has some redeeming literary value.

263
00:21:16,793 --> 00:21:18,323
Hey, what is all that?

264
00:21:18,323 --> 00:21:19,273
What do you mean?

265
00:21:19,273 --> 00:21:21,433
It's the fervent love between a man and a woman,

266
00:21:21,433 --> 00:21:22,623
affectionate love,

267
00:21:22,623 --> 00:21:25,953
plus desire and lust.

268
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:27,373
This is what I'm talking about.

269
00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:29,643
It's not a crime to draw erotica.

270
00:21:29,643 --> 00:21:30,933
Sir?

271
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:33,343
This is not erotica.

272
00:21:33,343 --> 00:21:36,753
This is an extraordinary masterpiece.

273
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,783
Masterpiece?

274
00:21:46,553 --> 00:21:48,683
It is a work I plan to offer to his majesty.

275
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:53,543
You must decide with the utmost caution.

276
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:00,443
What do you think of this one?

277
00:22:03,183 --> 00:22:05,963
Seok Sin Gang Rim?

278
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,993
This work portrays

279
00:22:14,993 --> 00:22:17,483
the love of humanity, I see.

280
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,403
By the way,

281
00:22:23,403 --> 00:22:27,173
Maiden Hae Young, who works here. What does she like?

282
00:22:27,173 --> 00:22:30,283
Well, more than these explicit books,

283
00:22:30,283 --> 00:22:32,553
she prefers romance novels.

284
00:22:32,553 --> 00:22:36,903
She enjoys the gentle lovey-dovey vibes of those novels.

285
00:22:36,903 --> 00:22:40,833
But the theme in all these books is love and passion.

286
00:22:41,423 --> 00:22:44,973
If you keep that up, you'll be called a pervert again.

287
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:50,413
I must work on a new piece, then.

288
00:22:57,353 --> 00:22:59,673
How do you plan to take them inside?

289
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,293
What the...

290
00:23:09,293 --> 00:23:11,563
How did she get such valuable...

291
00:23:12,903 --> 00:23:14,673
No! This is not it.

292
00:23:16,023 --> 00:23:17,053
What are these?

293
00:23:17,053 --> 00:23:19,053
Can't you tell by looking?

294
00:23:19,763 --> 00:23:22,383
How dare you try to bring in such vulgar books

295
00:23:22,383 --> 00:23:25,263
into the palace?

296
00:23:25,263 --> 00:23:27,933
All right! Next person in line.

297
00:23:32,543 --> 00:23:35,543
So, whoever has this book has the upper hand, huh?

298
00:23:35,543 --> 00:23:38,753
All men are the same, I tell you.

299
00:23:42,023 --> 00:23:44,713
His majesty is no ordinary man.

300
00:23:44,713 --> 00:23:47,373
Even when an erotic and sexually enticing young lady came in,

301
00:23:47,373 --> 00:23:48,743
he did not budge at all.

302
00:23:48,743 --> 00:23:52,943
You cannot move his majesty with such vulgar drawings!

303
00:23:52,943 --> 00:23:55,073
Is that so?

304
00:23:55,073 --> 00:23:57,153
I guess I have no choice.

305
00:23:57,153 --> 00:23:59,123
For the sake of order within the palace,

306
00:23:59,123 --> 00:24:01,553
I shall confiscate them.

307
00:24:02,653 --> 00:24:04,533
Stop right there.

308
00:24:07,603 --> 00:24:10,813
Do I really look like a stupid fool to you?

309
00:24:11,373 --> 00:24:13,153
 She's so cold.

310
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:17,633
Gosh, you should know better. Why are you doing this?

311
00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:18,873
Hand them over, please.

312
00:24:18,873 --> 00:24:21,403
Come on. I said these wouldn't do.

313
00:24:21,403 --> 00:24:23,403
He is already sensitive as is.

314
00:24:23,403 --> 00:24:25,853
He has been unable to sleep for the last two nights.

315
00:24:25,853 --> 00:24:29,443
For now, let us at least try.

316
00:24:30,073 --> 00:24:32,423
Your wrist! Your wrist!

317
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:39,343
Crown Princess, I was sparring with Sin Won today.

318
00:24:39,343 --> 00:24:41,903
I completely crushed him.

319
00:24:41,903 --> 00:24:44,223
As I saw him go down without much of a chance,

320
00:24:44,223 --> 00:24:46,333
I am probably the best in Joseon-

321
00:24:47,473 --> 00:24:50,723
Crown Princess, what is wrong? Are you all right?

322
00:24:54,053 --> 00:24:56,943
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

323
00:25:00,623 --> 00:25:03,243
Your neck...

324
00:25:03,243 --> 00:25:05,353
Are you all right?

325
00:25:05,353 --> 00:25:08,293
M-My n-neck?

326
00:25:13,923 --> 00:25:15,653
Just now,

327
00:25:16,483 --> 00:25:20,123
did the spirit of Crown Princess stop by?

328
00:25:21,263 --> 00:25:22,853
No, she did not.

329
00:25:28,463 --> 00:25:29,963
I would like to be alone.

330
00:25:29,963 --> 00:25:33,543
Your Majesty, you are drenched in sweat.

331
00:25:33,543 --> 00:25:34,913
Let me wipe you down-

332
00:25:34,913 --> 00:25:37,253
I told you to go away!

333
00:25:40,483 --> 00:25:42,553
- This...
 - What is that?

334
00:25:42,553 --> 00:25:46,043
This is something I've been enjoying-

335
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,673
Using drawings like these...

336
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:56,303
were you trying to sway me?

337
00:25:56,303 --> 00:25:58,403
I thought I told you

338
00:25:59,223 --> 00:26:02,343
not to do anything pointless!

339
00:26:03,293 --> 00:26:05,183
In that case,

340
00:26:05,183 --> 00:26:07,763
I will take my leave.

341
00:26:12,183 --> 00:26:17,013
But still, we went through difficulty finding these books for you.

342
00:26:17,013 --> 00:26:20,383
- Can I leave—
 - I said, I do not need them! Get rid of them!

343
00:26:21,363 --> 00:26:23,173
I'm doomed.

344
00:26:32,273 --> 00:26:33,833
I heard him yelling inside.

345
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:34,903
What happened?

346
00:26:34,903 --> 00:26:37,133
I think he was having a nightmare.

347
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:41,433
He threw the books and told me to get out while lashing out in rage.

348
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:46,913
We even prepared some red ginseng extract for his health today.

349
00:26:46,913 --> 00:26:50,013
You were right, Head Eunuch.

350
00:26:58,013 --> 00:27:01,743
His majesty is not to be swayed by books like these.

351
00:27:01,743 --> 00:27:05,163
How did you think of bringing in such profane works to His majesty?

352
00:27:05,163 --> 00:27:06,633
Chief,

353
00:27:06,633 --> 00:27:09,213
it is a published collection of stories.

354
00:27:10,163 --> 00:27:12,603
Well, now that there is no longer use for these,

355
00:27:12,603 --> 00:27:14,113
you two can split them.

356
00:27:14,113 --> 00:27:15,653
Look here,

357
00:27:15,653 --> 00:27:17,353
I do not need any.

358
00:27:17,353 --> 00:27:18,473
Why all of a sudden?

359
00:27:18,473 --> 00:27:23,133
I will not explain that in detail.

360
00:27:29,543 --> 00:27:31,463
Then, you can take them all, Chief.

361
00:27:31,463 --> 00:27:33,383
Oh, I'm fine.

362
00:27:33,383 --> 00:27:34,863
Take them, please.

363
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:37,263
Take them, take them.

364
00:27:46,353 --> 00:27:48,683
The more I think about it, the more it bothers me.

365
00:27:48,683 --> 00:27:51,923
What's the reason for giving me those books?

366
00:27:51,923 --> 00:27:55,313
I've already saved her life twice so far.

367
00:27:55,313 --> 00:27:57,613
Does she even see me as a man?

368
00:27:57,613 --> 00:28:01,303
She'd be too shy to give me those if she saw me as a man.

369
00:28:11,973 --> 00:28:14,973
 The Sticky World of Married Couples.

370
00:28:22,943 --> 00:28:25,563
Gracious, right off the first page...

371
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:31,233
The two of them must be very much in love.

372
00:28:34,793 --> 00:28:38,393
Your Majesty, you have dark shadows under your eyes.

373
00:28:38,393 --> 00:28:41,063
Please drink this and recover your health.

374
00:28:41,063 --> 00:28:43,323
Is it from the Great Queen Dowager?

375
00:28:43,323 --> 00:28:44,473
Yes, Your Majesty.

376
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:48,483
But when I drink this, I get too much heat in my body.

377
00:29:20,683 --> 00:29:24,173
If you are hot, should I prepare some cold water for you?

378
00:29:24,173 --> 00:29:27,453
No, that will not be necessary.

379
00:29:27,453 --> 00:29:28,933
Please take your leave.

380
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,773
Yes, Your Majesty.

381
00:29:51,363 --> 00:29:54,603
Aigoo, it's still a mess here.

382
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:07,293
So, these are the books So Rang found with difficulty?

383
00:30:10,573 --> 00:30:12,343
Oh, dear!

384
00:30:18,153 --> 00:30:21,433
Since So Rang went through the trouble to get these,

385
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:23,943
I should at least appreciate her effort...

386
00:30:28,533 --> 00:30:31,873
 It's not a sin to fall in love!

387
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:34,463
Why that little f***ing bastard!

388
00:30:34,463 --> 00:30:36,633
Of course, falling in love is not a sin!

389
00:30:36,633 --> 00:30:38,193
That bastard! That little...

390
00:30:38,193 --> 00:30:39,783
I will punish this bastard with death!

391
00:30:39,783 --> 00:30:41,393
Look-

392
00:30:41,393 --> 00:30:44,443
The sin of leaving his faithful wife will be dealt with strictly by the national law!

393
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:47,333
I got too absorbed in this.

394
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:52,403
It sure has literary value.

395
00:30:52,403 --> 00:30:56,563
No! I-I'm not such a vulgar man...

396
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,083
The storyline is quite solid.

397
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:02,233
Since works like this are popular among people,

398
00:31:02,233 --> 00:31:06,463
I should keep one for myself for the sake of public sentiment.

399
00:31:08,593 --> 00:31:09,533
That one, too.

400
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:12,093
Very likable, on the contrary.

401
00:31:17,883 --> 00:31:19,833
 Warning 
 Warning!

402
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:22,833
Wow, are they issuing me a warning?

403
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:24,973
I shall ignore it.

404
00:31:34,013 --> 00:31:36,163
To be continued...

405
00:31:36,163 --> 00:31:38,123
Next volume, next volume.

406
00:32:08,273 --> 00:32:13,243
This will not do. For an officer of Joseon to lack such self-control...

407
00:32:17,483 --> 00:32:18,783
Where are you going?

408
00:32:18,783 --> 00:32:20,853
You scared me...

409
00:32:20,853 --> 00:32:22,373
What are you doing here?

410
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:26,793
Well, since I fell asleep yesterday right away after supper, I woke up early.

411
00:32:26,793 --> 00:32:28,333
Where are you going?

412
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:30,433
Are you going out to do some sword training?

413
00:32:31,503 --> 00:32:33,723
I felt like my body had become a bit weak.

414
00:32:33,723 --> 00:32:35,243
I see...

415
00:32:35,243 --> 00:32:37,123
Is that so?

416
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:41,403
Could you teach me as well?

417
00:32:41,403 --> 00:32:43,563
- You want to learn how to use a sword?
 - Yes.

418
00:32:43,563 --> 00:32:45,153
I should be able to protect myself.

419
00:32:45,153 --> 00:32:46,693
Last time, I almost died by falling in the water,

420
00:32:46,693 --> 00:32:48,743
and another time, I almost died from a boar attack.

421
00:32:48,743 --> 00:32:51,953
My luck these days is pretty bad.

422
00:32:51,953 --> 00:32:54,173
So I should know how to use a sword.

423
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:56,643
If anything happens, I will protect you.

424
00:32:59,093 --> 00:33:01,493
Why? Can't you trust me?

425
00:33:01,493 --> 00:33:06,723
You cannot... be by my side forever.

426
00:33:07,983 --> 00:33:10,213
I will be back after I get changed.

427
00:33:19,403 --> 00:33:23,313
Being friends is truly useless.

428
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:37,913
A male and female coupling...

429
00:33:38,463 --> 00:33:41,193
They look quite affectionate.

430
00:33:44,643 --> 00:33:48,563
Everyone is busy, even in the sky.

431
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,323
The wind is nice as well.

432
00:34:08,793 --> 00:34:11,373
Are the flowers not too red?

433
00:34:11,373 --> 00:34:13,313
Your Majesty does not like flowers, right?

434
00:34:13,313 --> 00:34:15,963
Please wait just a moment.I will go and cut them all.

435
00:34:15,963 --> 00:34:18,123
No, it is fine.

436
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:20,453
It's nice since it has been a while since I have smelled the scent of flowers.

437
00:34:20,453 --> 00:34:23,773
Then, shall I pluck the flowers with their roots, and place them in your bedchamber?

438
00:34:23,773 --> 00:34:25,333
No.

439
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,700
J-Just leave them where they are.

440
00:34:28,863 --> 00:34:30,633
Yes, Your Majesty.

441
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:32,883
Let us go to the palace garden.

442
00:34:32,883 --> 00:34:35,933
I must practice wielding the sword.

443
00:34:54,933 --> 00:34:56,623
What do you think?

444
00:34:57,503 --> 00:35:01,013
Well... you need to straighten your back more,

445
00:35:01,013 --> 00:35:03,633
and space your hands apart more.

446
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:06,843
Oh, like this?

447
00:35:06,843 --> 00:35:08,463
 It is because we are still friends

448
00:35:08,463 --> 00:35:10,593
 - that we can get close like this. 
 - Like this...

449
00:35:10,593 --> 00:35:12,103
 Since there are no personal feelings.

450
00:35:12,103 --> 00:35:13,823
Like this?

451
00:35:15,943 --> 00:35:18,403
Is it always this heavy?

452
00:35:18,403 --> 00:35:21,083
I told you to relax your shoulders.

453
00:35:24,773 --> 00:35:25,573
Will you stop that?

454
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:27,183
Oh, you managed to block everything...

455
00:35:27,183 --> 00:35:28,893
You are so cool!

456
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:31,123
Come here. Your form is all wrong.

457
00:35:31,123 --> 00:35:33,283
But how come you cannot strike down straight?

458
00:35:33,283 --> 00:35:35,183
Is your body contorted somewhere?

459
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:36,873
Look at this!

460
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:40,073
- Did you just poke me?
 - Yes I did!

461
00:35:40,073 --> 00:35:41,823
Do you think you are the only one who can poke?

462
00:35:41,823 --> 00:35:43,523
- You dare poke me?
 - Come on, stop it!

463
00:35:43,523 --> 00:35:44,853
Really, stop!

464
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:47,393
Do that to me one more time.

465
00:35:47,393 --> 00:35:50,333
Oh, right. Did you read that book?

466
00:35:54,533 --> 00:35:56,233
You did.

467
00:35:56,233 --> 00:35:57,923
I can tell just from looking at your face.

468
00:35:57,923 --> 00:36:00,813
Sin Won, are you embarrassed?

469
00:36:00,813 --> 00:36:02,923
Do you not see me as a man at all?

470
00:36:02,923 --> 00:36:04,333
I gave it to you because I saw you as a man.

471
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:07,643
I heard it is the type that guys really like.

472
00:36:07,643 --> 00:36:09,293
Did you enjoy yourself?

473
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:11,423
Did you enjoy it?

474
00:36:18,303 --> 00:36:22,183
If you keep this up, I am going to teach you a lesson.

475
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:37,183
W-What are they doing over there?

476
00:36:42,053 --> 00:36:44,733
What do they use to make this that it is so heavy?

477
00:36:44,733 --> 00:36:47,023
It looks like he is teaching her something.

478
00:36:47,023 --> 00:36:49,573
What is So Rang's shift today?

479
00:36:49,573 --> 00:36:53,533
No, whether it is her shift or not, tell her to come to my bedchamber.

480
00:37:10,743 --> 00:37:14,033
 Your Ladyship, it is time to serve dinner to His Excellency.

481
00:37:14,033 --> 00:37:16,893
Gosh, it is so tiresome.

482
00:37:16,893 --> 00:37:19,133
Having to do this every meal...

483
00:37:19,133 --> 00:37:20,853
Then,

484
00:37:21,463 --> 00:37:24,923
just have him starve today.

485
00:37:24,923 --> 00:37:27,553
And stay with me here a bit longer.

486
00:37:31,533 --> 00:37:34,193
Even a straw mat husband

487
00:37:35,663 --> 00:37:37,913
is still a husband.

488
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:53,583
Your Ladyship.

489
00:37:54,223 --> 00:37:57,123
There is something I must tell you.

490
00:38:01,433 --> 00:38:05,353
What did you say? There is a girl who looks like Hyeon Seon?

491
00:38:05,353 --> 00:38:09,573
She passed by so quickly that I cannot be sure...

492
00:38:12,473 --> 00:38:15,013
Where did you see her?

493
00:38:40,023 --> 00:38:42,063
 Stop!

494
00:38:46,423 --> 00:38:50,653
There is an inner court lady who has gotten close to king Yi Heon ...

495
00:38:50,653 --> 00:38:54,763
Is it that court lady who was brought to the hunting grounds?

496
00:38:54,763 --> 00:38:59,763
Is someone heading towards their grave again?

497
00:38:59,763 --> 00:39:02,753
But there is a bodyguard assigned to the court lady,

498
00:39:02,753 --> 00:39:06,623
so it is difficult to know all of her specific movements.

499
00:39:07,193 --> 00:39:09,833
Keep watching her for now.

500
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:12,823
I will come up with a strategy.

501
00:39:12,823 --> 00:39:15,413
Tonight is truly...

502
00:39:15,413 --> 00:39:20,053
a night where I feel full of loyalty, Your Majesty.

503
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:26,523
Your Majesty. Shall I show you something nice?

504
00:39:30,943 --> 00:39:33,613
A-Are you crazy? What is wrong with you!

505
00:39:33,613 --> 00:39:39,043
Looking beautiful in front of you will also be part of loyalty.

506
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,213
No...

507
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,353
No, no, no...

508
00:39:42,353 --> 00:39:44,793
Surprise!

509
00:39:44,793 --> 00:39:46,613
Is it not pretty?

510
00:39:46,613 --> 00:39:50,873
Court Lady Won gave me one of her prized silk dresses.

511
00:39:50,873 --> 00:39:52,283
Pretty, my foot.

512
00:39:52,283 --> 00:39:54,663
Did I not tell you not to do anything against the customary rules?

513
00:39:54,663 --> 00:39:56,603
If you really do not like it, shall I take it off?

514
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:59,153
Take it off? Here?

515
00:39:59,153 --> 00:40:00,903
What is going through your mind?

516
00:40:00,903 --> 00:40:03,383
I am telling you I will go and get changed.

517
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:07,093
Sure. All right. Wait.

518
00:40:07,093 --> 00:40:09,483
Yes. Never mind.

519
00:40:09,483 --> 00:40:11,393
Now that I think about it,

520
00:40:11,393 --> 00:40:15,053
I suppose I do not absolutely hate it.

521
00:40:15,053 --> 00:40:17,183
But,

522
00:40:17,183 --> 00:40:20,203
why did you suddenly call for me?

523
00:40:20,203 --> 00:40:22,453
Oh, right.

524
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:24,473
What were you doing this morning?

525
00:40:24,473 --> 00:40:27,073
I was at the military training grounds, training

526
00:40:27,073 --> 00:40:29,973
with wooden swords with Chief Lee Sin Won.

527
00:40:31,473 --> 00:40:32,903
Did you not say

528
00:40:32,903 --> 00:40:35,843
Sin Won is nothing more than a friend?

529
00:40:35,843 --> 00:40:37,643
If he is not, then what would he be?

530
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:41,780
Are you trying to say that Chief Lee Sin Won and I like each other?

531
00:40:42,433 --> 00:40:46,000
Yes, that is exactly how it looked. As if you two like each other!

532
00:40:46,743 --> 00:40:49,533
I see. So that is what was bothering you.

533
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:51,723
How is that training in swordsmanship?

534
00:40:51,723 --> 00:40:53,523
Just because I played around a bit,

535
00:40:53,523 --> 00:40:55,313
Chief Lee Sin Won said:

536
00:40:55,313 --> 00:40:56,803
"If you...

537
00:40:56,803 --> 00:41:00,023
keep this up, I am going to teach you a lesson."

538
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:04,243
He put on such a stern face and glared at me...

539
00:41:04,243 --> 00:41:07,753
Why are all the men around me like this?

540
00:41:07,753 --> 00:41:11,423
Yesterday, Your Majesty... You yelled at me...

541
00:41:11,423 --> 00:41:13,803
W-When did I do that?

542
00:41:15,053 --> 00:41:17,633
"I do not need it! Go away!"

543
00:41:17,633 --> 00:41:20,453
Do you know how hurt I was yesterday?

544
00:41:20,453 --> 00:41:24,453
I feel it would be good to distance myself from you.

545
00:41:24,453 --> 00:41:26,303
I am the only one being uselessly swayed to and fro.

546
00:41:26,303 --> 00:41:28,473
What do you mean, you are being swayed!

547
00:41:28,473 --> 00:41:31,453
Just yesterday, because of the book you gave me, I—

548
00:41:33,993 --> 00:41:35,853
Oh, my...

549
00:41:37,173 --> 00:41:39,523
That... collection of stories?

550
00:41:39,523 --> 00:41:40,263
No.

551
00:41:40,263 --> 00:41:42,143
- You read it?
 - No.

552
00:41:42,143 --> 00:41:46,543
Did you not get angry at me, saying you didn't need it?

553
00:41:46,543 --> 00:41:49,873
Exactly, I don't need it.

554
00:41:49,873 --> 00:41:50,993
So, the thing is...

555
00:41:50,993 --> 00:41:54,523
I mean, in that short span?

556
00:41:54,523 --> 00:41:59,373
Oh, my. I wonder who put all of that in such a neat pile.

557
00:42:02,273 --> 00:42:04,823
- I told you I did not read it.
 - That is...

558
00:42:04,823 --> 00:42:08,713
something I will need to check for myself.

559
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:19,703
I mean, you got angry at me and told me to go away yesterday.

560
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:24,533
Did you kick me out so that you can read these alone as soon as you could?

561
00:42:25,863 --> 00:42:28,003
Stop it.

562
00:42:29,253 --> 00:42:32,573
Shall I check... where the trace of drool is?

563
00:42:32,573 --> 00:42:36,363
- D-Drop it! Drop it. 
 - Let's see.

564
00:42:36,363 --> 00:42:37,983
Hey, drop it.

565
00:42:37,983 --> 00:42:39,433
- Do not come closer!
 - I told you to give them to me.

566
00:42:39,433 --> 00:42:43,043
- Now. Give them to me.
- All right, let us take a look!

567
00:42:43,043 --> 00:42:45,313
Do not check...

568
00:42:48,873 --> 00:42:53,393
Are you starting to want to take on a new bride?

569
00:42:53,393 --> 00:42:55,583
Give them to me. I get it, so hurry up—

570
00:42:55,583 --> 00:42:59,623
Do you not sense the feelings of love, desire, and lust

571
00:42:59,623 --> 00:43:05,303
bubbling up like a spring in this place? Can't you feel it?

572
00:43:05,303 --> 00:43:10,963
You should admit it now that you are just a man...

573
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:13,953
that when you read something like this, your heart softens

574
00:43:13,953 --> 00:43:16,393
and you want to have a woman close to you,

575
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:20,500
start to have desires, and furthermore...

576
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:33,943
Even though you are so close to a woman like this, you do not feel anything?

577
00:43:45,733 --> 00:43:47,763
Even if I do this?

578
00:43:58,313 --> 00:44:00,063
Forget it.

579
00:44:19,313 --> 00:44:26,023
♫  What nobody knew  ♫

580
00:44:26,023 --> 00:44:33,313
♫  My story of us  ♫

581
00:44:33,313 --> 00:44:40,253
♫  By random chance at some point  ♫

582
00:44:40,253 --> 00:44:46,073
♫  I ended up with this secret  ♫

583
00:44:46,073 --> 00:44:48,123
You must have forgotten.

584
00:44:48,783 --> 00:44:52,313
All of the court ladies are the king's women.

585
00:44:53,313 --> 00:44:55,443
The king is also a man,

586
00:44:56,933 --> 00:44:59,033
so do not dare

587
00:45:00,013 --> 00:45:02,753
fool around with me like this again.

588
00:45:03,893 --> 00:45:16,463
♫  This small confession, it keeps repeating endlessly  ♫

589
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:38,243
She did it! She did it.

590
00:45:38,243 --> 00:45:40,723
What! What do you mean?

591
00:45:40,723 --> 00:45:43,043
They made a connection.

592
00:45:43,043 --> 00:45:46,393
Their eyes have met.

593
00:45:46,393 --> 00:45:50,453
Wait, does that mean his majesty's walls that have been up for seven years have fallen?

594
00:45:50,453 --> 00:45:55,473
I have seen loving affection reflected in the eyes of the king when he was looking upon So Rang.

595
00:45:55,473 --> 00:45:58,213
Now, it is our turn to step in.

596
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:02,013
Let us set up a royal conjugal night for them.

597
00:46:02,013 --> 00:46:03,873
With whom?

598
00:46:03,873 --> 00:46:06,423
With So Rang?

599
00:46:06,423 --> 00:46:07,783
No!

600
00:46:07,783 --> 00:46:09,343
So Rang is not even a true inner court lady,

601
00:46:09,343 --> 00:46:12,353
she is a temporary court lady borrowing the name of another!

602
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:14,153
Come on, now is not the time to pick and choose.

603
00:46:14,153 --> 00:46:16,883
Even if a servant maid receives the favor of the king and bears his heir,

604
00:46:16,883 --> 00:46:18,803
then she will be promoted to the position of queen.

605
00:46:18,803 --> 00:46:21,503
Then, the Marriage Ban Edict that has lasted seven years will come to an end.

606
00:46:21,503 --> 00:46:23,723
How can we be picky about someone's background

607
00:46:23,723 --> 00:46:27,223
when we are dealing with something as important as the fate of Joseon?

608
00:46:28,303 --> 00:46:34,143
What do you think we should be doing as his majesty's most loyal servants?

609
00:46:34,143 --> 00:46:36,243
Since the fire has already been lit,

610
00:46:36,243 --> 00:46:38,393
we need to add fuel to the fire.

611
00:46:38,393 --> 00:46:41,113
Will that go according to our plans?

612
00:46:41,113 --> 00:46:43,393
If it does not, we have to make it happen.

613
00:46:43,393 --> 00:46:49,313
However, if rumors of his majesty and So Rang becoming close spread in the palace...

614
00:46:49,313 --> 00:46:51,273
That is why this must happen in one go.

615
00:46:51,273 --> 00:46:54,023
Receive his favor, then be promoted right away.

616
00:46:54,023 --> 00:46:56,873
So that nobody would dare hurt her.

617
00:47:21,163 --> 00:47:24,143
 Aedaldang

618
00:47:24,143 --> 00:47:26,523
 The female owner of this teahouse

619
00:47:26,523 --> 00:47:29,433
 looks like that girl?

620
00:47:35,413 --> 00:47:37,513
Hello! Welcome to Aedaldang!

621
00:47:37,513 --> 00:47:39,443
Did the owner of this place

622
00:47:39,443 --> 00:47:40,493
go somewhere?

623
00:47:40,493 --> 00:47:43,133
Oh, the owner eonni comes here only two days during the week.

624
00:47:43,133 --> 00:47:45,773
- For the other five days—
 - Hae Yeong.

625
00:47:53,723 --> 00:47:57,903
How could such a person of high stature come to such a lowly place like this?

626
00:47:57,903 --> 00:47:59,853
Do you know who I am?

627
00:47:59,853 --> 00:48:01,753
Are you not the one who will become

628
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:04,983
the king's mother-in-law, which is the first senior rank?

629
00:48:06,753 --> 00:48:09,813
My daughter will become the queen?

630
00:48:09,813 --> 00:48:13,073
You seem to be worried these days because of your daughter.

631
00:48:13,073 --> 00:48:15,433
That is why you have come all the way here.

632
00:48:21,343 --> 00:48:23,453
Do not worry too much.

633
00:48:23,453 --> 00:48:24,763
Among your daughters

634
00:48:24,763 --> 00:48:27,153
is one who is worthy of becoming the queen.

635
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:31,543
But if you keep moving about outside like this often,

636
00:48:31,543 --> 00:48:33,733
then that energy may seep out, Your Ladyship.

637
00:48:33,733 --> 00:48:37,063
Especially in a place like this where people of worry and anxiety gather,

638
00:48:37,063 --> 00:48:40,323
your good energy would only be taken from you.

639
00:48:40,323 --> 00:48:42,253
I will not take payment for telling your fortune.

640
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:46,173
It is my honor to read the fortune of someone of such high stature.

641
00:48:55,803 --> 00:48:58,073
Have a nice day!

642
00:49:01,453 --> 00:49:03,953
Why did you send away that guest so quickly?

643
00:49:03,953 --> 00:49:06,803
I must send a message to Chief Lee Sin Won.

644
00:49:06,803 --> 00:49:08,163
For the two days this week,

645
00:49:08,163 --> 00:49:10,633
he should not bring So Rang to this place.

646
00:49:10,633 --> 00:49:12,173
What?

647
00:49:13,063 --> 00:49:16,193
If you get close to someone you should not be getting close to,

648
00:49:16,193 --> 00:49:18,643
won't there not be a problem?

649
00:49:22,203 --> 00:49:25,983
Even a mere common compatibility reader can see it clearly.

650
00:49:25,983 --> 00:49:29,333
That you are going to become the queen, Hyeon Hui.

651
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:32,483
Did you not go there because that bitch might still be alive?

652
00:49:32,483 --> 00:49:35,713
Whether she is alive or dead, what does that matter?

653
00:49:35,713 --> 00:49:38,963
He says that you will become the queen!

654
00:49:38,963 --> 00:49:41,033
What did he say exactly?

655
00:49:41,033 --> 00:49:44,453
"Among your daughters is one who is worthy of becoming the queen."

656
00:49:45,293 --> 00:49:46,933
Mother.

657
00:49:46,933 --> 00:49:49,983
He did not say that daughter was your birth daughter.

658
00:49:49,983 --> 00:49:53,833
If we think about it on a bigger scale, that bitch is your stepdaughter.

659
00:49:53,833 --> 00:49:55,933
Let us be meticulous in taking care of her.

660
00:49:55,933 --> 00:49:58,863
It is because we did not take care of her cleanly seven years ago

661
00:49:58,863 --> 00:50:02,063
that we are dealing with seeds of worry.

662
00:50:05,023 --> 00:50:06,283
All right.

663
00:50:06,283 --> 00:50:08,553
We should take care of business properly.

664
00:50:08,553 --> 00:50:11,223
At this rate, would rumors not spread in the palace again?

665
00:50:11,223 --> 00:50:13,063
The anniversary of the crown princess' death is coming up soon as well.

666
00:50:13,063 --> 00:50:14,303
Come now!

667
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:15,973
Do not say such inauspicious things!

668
00:50:15,973 --> 00:50:18,443
We will get everything done before then.

669
00:50:18,443 --> 00:50:21,653
At this rate, what if So Rang gets murdered?

670
00:50:21,653 --> 00:50:23,493
Last time, you saw what happened to that lady—

671
00:50:23,493 --> 00:50:26,503
It would not be good for her to seduce him blatantly.

672
00:50:26,503 --> 00:50:28,723
Just as a drizzling rain seeps through your clothes,

673
00:50:28,723 --> 00:50:31,723
she must slowly

674
00:50:31,723 --> 00:50:33,383
draw near to him.

675
00:50:33,383 --> 00:50:36,463
I will teach her a thing or two.

676
00:50:36,463 --> 00:50:37,723
Teach her what?

677
00:50:37,723 --> 00:50:39,533
What would you teach her?

678
00:50:39,533 --> 00:50:43,513
What would you know about anything, sir eunuch?

679
00:50:43,513 --> 00:50:46,673
I... I'm also a man.

680
00:50:46,673 --> 00:50:48,833
Then what does she need to do?

681
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:50,803
Well!

682
00:50:50,803 --> 00:50:53,893
According to Su Nu Jing, a man is Mars, and a woman is Mercury*.
 (Reference to the 1992 book 'Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus')

683
00:50:53,893 --> 00:50:55,343
Since a man is a fire and a woman is water,

684
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:57,303
according to the opposing relationship of the two based on the Principle of Five Elements—

685
00:50:57,303 --> 00:51:01,373
How will we succeed with a royal conjugal night based on academic theory?

686
00:51:03,453 --> 00:51:04,753
Then,

687
00:51:04,753 --> 00:51:07,223
what do we need to do?

688
00:51:07,223 --> 00:51:10,323
First, we need them to be true to their primal instincts.

689
00:51:10,323 --> 00:51:12,373
Having them drink alcohol would be a must.

690
00:51:12,373 --> 00:51:15,873
From what I hear, So Rang is quite the drinker.

691
00:51:15,873 --> 00:51:19,883
Among the drinks that were served by envoys from Arabia,

692
00:51:19,883 --> 00:51:23,773
I heard that there was a mixed drink called Sex on the Beach.

693
00:51:23,773 --> 00:51:28,093
Supposedly, the place where one sits and drinks becomes a beach!

694
00:51:31,943 --> 00:51:34,433
What do you mean by that!

695
00:51:34,433 --> 00:51:37,933
Wait, how did you...

696
00:51:37,933 --> 00:51:39,643
I called him.

697
00:51:39,643 --> 00:51:41,553
What exactly are you plotting?

698
00:51:41,553 --> 00:51:42,683
What else would it be?

699
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:45,533
We are making plans for the royal conjugal night between his majesty and So Rang.

700
00:51:45,533 --> 00:51:49,273
Do you not also want this Marriage Ban Edict to end, Chief Lee Sin Won?

701
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:51,143
That was not the reason she entered the palace!

702
00:51:51,143 --> 00:51:53,583
If she is made into a noblewoman by receiving the king's favor,

703
00:51:53,583 --> 00:51:56,923
then she will surely say yes and accept it.

704
00:51:58,003 --> 00:52:00,973
 There is no way she will refuse.

705
00:52:03,173 --> 00:52:06,033
I told you that I have a request for you.

706
00:52:06,033 --> 00:52:08,083
That is...

707
00:52:09,883 --> 00:52:13,283
I want you to ask his majesty how he is feeling these days.

708
00:52:13,283 --> 00:52:15,553
What kind of feelings he is holding inside,

709
00:52:15,553 --> 00:52:17,453
what he thinks about So Rang,

710
00:52:17,453 --> 00:52:19,803
and if he is leaning toward her.

711
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:23,213
Could you casually ask him these things?

712
00:52:23,213 --> 00:52:24,663
You already know

713
00:52:24,663 --> 00:52:28,503
that we cannot let this opportunity pass. If we do...

714
00:52:46,753 --> 00:52:48,623
Y-Your neck...

715
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,783
A-Are you all right?

716
00:52:51,383 --> 00:52:55,663
Your Majesty, Chief Lee Sin Won is here.

717
00:52:57,773 --> 00:53:02,123
How do you feel these days, Your Majesty?

718
00:53:03,473 --> 00:53:07,163
I feel like I am changing a bit.

719
00:53:07,163 --> 00:53:08,713
I do not like that.

720
00:53:08,713 --> 00:53:10,943
It is a bit confusing.

721
00:53:10,943 --> 00:53:14,483
My heart keeps throbbing,

722
00:53:14,483 --> 00:53:18,253
but I cannot tell if it is excitement or anxiety.

723
00:53:19,643 --> 00:53:23,683
Well, how are you these days?

724
00:53:29,543 --> 00:53:33,583
 These days,  I have been raising a butterfly.

725
00:53:33,583 --> 00:53:36,923
Is it possible to keep a butterfly captive and raise it?

726
00:53:36,923 --> 00:53:39,783
I suppose it is just dropping by before departing.

727
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:42,653
I do not know if the butterfly came because the flowers bloomed,

728
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:45,503
or if the flowers bloomed because the butterfly came.

729
00:53:45,503 --> 00:53:48,303
I wish I could attach a string to it,

730
00:53:48,303 --> 00:53:52,893
but for now, I am just delighted by the beating of its wings.

731
00:53:58,473 --> 00:54:00,163
Your Majesty.

732
00:54:01,233 --> 00:54:03,533
You are changing, Your Majesty.

733
00:54:03,533 --> 00:54:07,223
You are becoming warmer than ever before.

734
00:54:07,223 --> 00:54:09,363
However,

735
00:54:09,363 --> 00:54:12,113
if your emotions are getting too strong, please restrain them.

736
00:54:12,113 --> 00:54:18,963
You must not let others find out about your changes, and your wavering.

737
00:54:18,963 --> 00:54:24,883
What I am confused about is not being sure of my feelings.

738
00:54:24,883 --> 00:54:29,503
And not being able to keep pace with my changing feelings.

739
00:54:29,503 --> 00:54:33,263
Once I become sure of my feelings,

740
00:54:34,603 --> 00:54:37,343
I will no longer hesitate.

741
00:54:38,033 --> 00:54:40,803
Let me know when your butterfly leaves your garden.

742
00:54:40,803 --> 00:54:42,350
I will be

743
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:47,780
the wind that moves the butterfly.

744
00:54:56,573 --> 00:54:59,813
Chief Lee Sin Won! Did you ask his majesty?

745
00:54:59,813 --> 00:55:02,363
What did he say? Is he well?

746
00:55:02,363 --> 00:55:04,923
Did you ask him about So Rang, too?

747
00:55:04,923 --> 00:55:08,293
So, would it be all right to proceed with the royal conjugal night?

748
00:55:09,153 --> 00:55:13,453
His majesty is well.

749
00:55:13,453 --> 00:55:15,573
Come on! You need to tell me what that means exactly!

750
00:55:15,573 --> 00:55:16,703
Do you mean physically or emotionally?

751
00:55:16,703 --> 00:55:20,053
Chief Lee Sin Won! Chief Lee Sin Won!

752
00:55:24,993 --> 00:55:28,793
I am supposed to eat all of this by myself?

753
00:55:28,793 --> 00:55:32,233
Court Lady Won told us to serve you a meal separately.

754
00:55:32,233 --> 00:55:35,650
I see...

755
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:36,813
What is the reason for this?

756
00:55:36,813 --> 00:55:39,563
Why is she suddenly treating me nicely?

757
00:55:40,723 --> 00:55:42,413
Good job.

758
00:55:42,413 --> 00:55:44,433
I am so full...

759
00:55:52,673 --> 00:55:54,463
Who are you?

760
00:55:58,303 --> 00:56:01,493
M-Ma'am?

761
00:56:04,023 --> 00:56:06,653
Wait... Your belly...

762
00:56:12,443 --> 00:56:14,583
How shall we match her top and bottom?

763
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:17,313
His majesty said he likes red.

764
00:56:17,313 --> 00:56:19,383
Let us go with red for both the top and bottom.

765
00:56:19,383 --> 00:56:20,863
Yes.

766
00:56:21,553 --> 00:56:24,213
You do not know the basics of matching colors...

767
00:56:24,213 --> 00:56:25,633
I mean, that's not the important thing here.

768
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:28,023
For what occasion will I be wearing this?

769
00:56:28,023 --> 00:56:29,793
The royal palace

770
00:56:29,793 --> 00:56:32,733
is a deep place, enclosed with several layers of doors.

771
00:56:32,733 --> 00:56:35,823
It means a palace is a place full of secrets.

772
00:56:37,543 --> 00:56:41,683
That secret seems to be about me, though.

773
00:56:46,733 --> 00:56:48,363
Hurry. We must go.

774
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:50,023
- Let us go.
 - Where?

775
00:56:50,023 --> 00:56:52,013
His majesty is going on an evening stroll.

776
00:56:52,013 --> 00:56:53,493
You should accompany him.

777
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,853
R-Right now?

778
00:56:56,503 --> 00:56:58,293
My heart is not yet prepared for this.

779
00:56:58,293 --> 00:57:01,373
Why would you need to prepare your heart? Let us go quickly.

780
00:57:01,373 --> 00:57:03,293
Is that so?

781
00:57:11,963 --> 00:57:19,593
 The king is also a man, so do not dare fool around with me like this again.

782
00:57:36,843 --> 00:57:39,133
It appears the stroll today is a bit hard on him.

783
00:57:39,133 --> 00:57:42,033
Go and wipe the sweat off his face.

784
00:57:44,143 --> 00:57:45,993
Right now?

785
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:02,983
I will wipe the sweat off your face.

786
00:58:02,983 --> 00:58:04,223
Sweat? Sure.

787
00:58:04,223 --> 00:58:06,160
Right...

788
00:58:08,833 --> 00:58:11,773
There is...

789
00:58:11,773 --> 00:58:12,720
no sweat?

790
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:31,053
Well...

791
00:58:31,053 --> 00:58:32,603
recently,

792
00:58:32,603 --> 00:58:35,723
do you not find the atmosphere within the palace a bit suspicious?

793
00:58:35,723 --> 00:58:38,293
You felt it, too?

794
00:58:38,293 --> 00:58:40,833
It feels like something is being prepared in secret.

795
00:58:40,833 --> 00:58:43,243
What could it be...

796
00:58:43,243 --> 00:58:45,733
Yes, they have been telling me to keep working out,

797
00:58:45,733 --> 00:58:47,463
even though I am already pretty fit.

798
00:58:47,463 --> 00:58:50,053
I see. You worked out a bit?

799
00:58:50,053 --> 00:58:54,270
I mean, I was naturally gifted with a good body.

800
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:00,963
Look at those two.

801
00:59:02,453 --> 00:59:06,633
It is clear that something fun is going on between them that they're not telling us.

802
00:59:06,633 --> 00:59:09,253
I do feel like something is going on.

803
00:59:09,253 --> 00:59:12,293
I do not know what it is, but I wish it would end soon.

804
00:59:12,293 --> 00:59:14,393
- Right?
 - Right.

805
00:59:35,573 --> 00:59:37,393
 June 17th

806
00:59:37,393 --> 00:59:40,033
 Did the date for the royal conjugal night get set already?

807
00:59:48,893 --> 00:59:50,693
Let us go!

808
00:59:53,263 --> 00:59:54,783
Hey.

809
00:59:55,683 --> 00:59:57,973
Is something wrong?

810
00:59:59,153 --> 01:00:02,293
Why? What is it? Tell me.

811
01:00:03,453 --> 01:00:05,703
Is life at the palace fun?

812
01:00:05,703 --> 01:00:09,713
Well, it is fun. It is not bad.

813
01:00:09,713 --> 01:00:12,083
It is a place where you can be killed at any moment.

814
01:00:12,083 --> 01:00:13,923
Whether you do anything wrong or not.

815
01:00:13,923 --> 01:00:16,013
I know. Do you think I do not know that?

816
01:00:16,013 --> 01:00:19,063
But it looks like everyone has given up on me.

817
01:00:19,063 --> 01:00:21,643
Especially since I have been causing so much trouble.

818
01:00:21,643 --> 01:00:24,513
It is not a place that you can take lightly.

819
01:00:24,513 --> 01:00:26,893
You do not know when there might be a bloodbath.

820
01:00:26,893 --> 01:00:29,533
Well, am I doing anything extraordinary?

821
01:00:29,533 --> 01:00:33,313
All I do is console the king and help him fall asleep.

822
01:00:34,373 --> 01:00:37,223
Hey. Why are you being like this?

823
01:00:37,953 --> 01:00:42,883
I am just worried about you.

824
01:00:43,983 --> 01:00:46,373
I am more worried about you.

825
01:00:46,373 --> 01:00:49,653
Your face is that of a dispirited beggar.

826
01:00:49,653 --> 01:00:52,363
Just worry about your emotional state.

827
01:00:58,003 --> 01:00:59,883
Have a nice evening.

828
01:01:06,113 --> 01:01:07,913
Sir.

829
01:01:09,773 --> 01:01:11,603
Halt.

830
01:01:16,153 --> 01:01:20,753
Aedaldang's grandpa Gwaeng Yi told me to deliver this to you.

831
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:23,253
The old man?

832
01:01:23,253 --> 01:01:24,513
 For this homeward trip,

833
01:01:24,513 --> 01:01:27,003
 you must absolutely not bring So Rang to Aedaldang,

834
01:01:27,003 --> 01:01:29,303
 using any excuse necessary.

835
01:01:29,303 --> 01:01:30,573
So Rang.

836
01:01:30,573 --> 01:01:31,993
Let us run away.

837
01:01:31,993 --> 01:01:34,783
What? All of a sudden?

838
01:01:34,783 --> 01:01:36,643
Hey!

839
01:01:44,483 --> 01:01:47,643
Supposedly, they escaped in a different direction at the palace gate.

840
01:01:58,293 --> 01:02:00,953
Where are we going?

841
01:02:13,933 --> 01:02:15,763
Sin Won!

842
01:02:28,493 --> 01:02:30,253
Kill him!

843
01:03:13,763 --> 01:03:15,393
Where are you going?

844
01:03:15,393 --> 01:03:19,453
The safest place for us right now is inside the palace.

845
01:03:20,533 --> 01:03:22,783
 Who is attacking us right now?

846
01:03:22,783 --> 01:03:24,513
You have failed?

847
01:03:24,513 --> 01:03:26,003
And yet, whom have you attacked?

848
01:03:26,003 --> 01:03:27,833
A Royal Investigation Bureau chief?

849
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:29,733
You should have killed them, at whatever cost!

850
01:03:29,733 --> 01:03:32,253
You should've gotten rid of her!

851
01:03:35,933 --> 01:03:37,573
What was the reason you let them go?

852
01:03:37,573 --> 01:03:39,703
Why did you not chase them to the end?

853
01:03:39,703 --> 01:03:43,463
I ordered them to just go and scare them.

854
01:03:43,463 --> 01:03:45,353
Your Excellency!

855
01:03:47,193 --> 01:03:48,653
All of you, disperse.

856
01:03:48,653 --> 01:03:51,013
Disperse...

857
01:03:51,013 --> 01:03:53,203
and leave no trace of your presence to the Royal Investigation Bureau chief.

858
01:03:53,203 --> 01:03:54,813
Yes, sir!

859
01:04:00,013 --> 01:04:03,503
What gives you the right to say who should live or die?

860
01:04:03,503 --> 01:04:09,663
Have you ever played the shell game?

861
01:04:11,483 --> 01:04:15,723
Well, is that not what swindlers do to rip people off?

862
01:04:15,723 --> 01:04:21,813
Lady, you seem to be playing the shell game using people.

863
01:04:24,013 --> 01:04:26,323
I am only saying this because I like your strategy.

864
01:04:26,323 --> 01:04:31,113
So, I am thinking of playing the shell game of my own...

865
01:04:31,113 --> 01:04:34,113
since good merchandise has appeared.

866
01:04:34,113 --> 01:04:40,153
Something that will captivate his majesty's mind.

867
01:04:44,233 --> 01:04:46,293
What is all this?

868
01:05:11,323 --> 01:05:13,623
Everyone stop!

869
01:05:13,623 --> 01:05:15,193
- Why are you doing this all of a sudden?
 - What?

870
01:05:15,193 --> 01:05:17,163
Tell me honestly.

871
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:19,873
Why is everyone being so nice to me lately?

872
01:05:19,873 --> 01:05:22,413
- What do you mean?
 - Come on!

873
01:05:22,413 --> 01:05:24,273
You used to always yell at me.

874
01:05:24,273 --> 01:05:27,013
Is there something you want from me?

875
01:05:27,013 --> 01:05:30,833
Since you are channeling the spirit of the dead crown princess in your body,

876
01:05:30,833 --> 01:05:33,763
we are treating you in a way that is appropriate to that.

877
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,453
Right!

878
01:05:35,453 --> 01:05:37,673
I see!

879
01:05:44,623 --> 01:05:48,223
Since our young lady here has the skin tone of a cold winter's snow,

880
01:05:48,223 --> 01:05:52,693
using this color for her lips and this color for her cheeks would be perfect.

881
01:06:17,333 --> 01:06:20,323
Is this really me?

882
01:06:24,293 --> 01:06:26,973
But where am I going all dressed up pretty like this?

883
01:06:26,973 --> 01:06:29,733
You need to go to do work. Where else would you go?

884
01:06:29,733 --> 01:06:31,643
You should go and act as an inner court lady.

885
01:06:31,643 --> 01:06:34,383
If I wear attire that is against the customs,

886
01:06:34,383 --> 01:06:36,853
he will probably yell at me again.

887
01:06:37,673 --> 01:06:42,893
I heard that his majesty is drinking some expensive drinks today.

888
01:06:42,893 --> 01:06:44,633
Expensive drinks?

889
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:48,203
He is so cheap! He should share some with me...

890
01:06:49,043 --> 01:06:54,503
If something were to happen inside,

891
01:06:54,503 --> 01:06:58,033
just leave everything to your primal instincts.

892
01:06:58,033 --> 01:07:02,453
As an inner court lady, the most important instinct would be...

893
01:07:02,453 --> 01:07:05,023
It has got to be...

894
01:07:07,133 --> 01:07:08,673
Sleep!

895
01:07:08,673 --> 01:07:12,293
It's so hard staying up all night.

896
01:07:12,293 --> 01:07:15,713
But if I fall asleep, he will say he will punish me by screwing my legs.

897
01:07:15,713 --> 01:07:20,433
In any case, do not talk back insolently to his majesty.

898
01:07:20,433 --> 01:07:22,873
Will I be able to restrain myself?

899
01:08:04,553 --> 01:08:06,303
What is going on?

900
01:08:31,873 --> 01:08:34,113
What is this?

901
01:09:00,673 --> 01:09:02,803
Your Majesty.

902
01:09:02,803 --> 01:09:05,833
 So Rang is here.

903
01:09:07,483 --> 01:09:12,830
♫  What nobody knew  ♫

904
01:09:13,913 --> 01:09:19,720
♫  My story of us  ♫

905
01:09:21,923 --> 01:09:28,153
♫  By random chance at some point  ♫

906
01:09:28,153 --> 01:09:31,880
♫  I ended up with this secret  ♫

907
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:14,710

908
01:10:15,943 --> 01:10:21,290
♫  How can I forget you?  ♫

909
01:10:23,073 --> 01:10:28,703
♫  How can I erase you?  ♫

910
01:10:28,703 --> 01:10:31,593
 The Forbidden Marriage 
 Preview

911
01:10:31,593 --> 01:10:34,263
 It appears you no longer see me as a friend.

912
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:36,523
 Answer me.

913
01:10:36,523 --> 01:10:39,993
 Do I mean anything to you, Your Majesty?

914
01:10:39,993 --> 01:10:41,883
 I am nothing to you.

915
01:10:41,883 --> 01:10:46,183
 If Chief Lee Sin Won is dismissed, then So Rang will no longer be safe.

916
01:10:46,183 --> 01:10:50,643
 The crown princess' death anniversary is almost upon us.

917
01:10:50,643 --> 01:10:52,383
 Crown Princess!

918
01:10:54,033 --> 01:10:57,693
 They say the Crown Princess returned from the dead!

919
01:10:57,693 --> 01:11:01,323
 Have you been well?

920
01:11:02,023 --> 01:11:03,023
 Crown Princess!

921
01:11:03,023 --> 01:11:07,213
♫  I want to go with you as well  ♫
