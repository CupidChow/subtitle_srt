1
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:39,877
 In the infinitely unknown universe there is an Earth-like planet.

2
00:00:39,877 --> 00:00:43,497
 On that planet, there is a country called Joseon.

3
00:00:43,497 --> 00:00:49,480
 If you think that it is strangely familiar, that is your delusion.

4
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,177
 Coincidentally, two females sharing the same fate were born on the same day and time.

5
00:00:53,177 --> 00:01:00,187
 This story starts also by coincidence when their life and death fates diverted.

6
00:01:00,187 --> 00:01:03,987
 I say this again, but this story is fiction.

7
00:01:03,987 --> 00:01:08,517
 Edict Banning Marriage for any female age 13 to 18  What does this even say...

8
00:01:08,517 --> 00:01:12,487
What does it say? Shouldn't someone explain?

9
00:01:12,487 --> 00:01:15,057
It seems an edict forbidding marriage has been issued.

10
00:01:15,057 --> 00:01:17,697
It hasn't been too long since the crown princess died.

11
00:01:17,697 --> 00:01:19,127
Why are they already selecting a new bride for the royal family?

12
00:01:19,127 --> 00:01:20,627
It says everyone's marriage is forbidden.

13
00:01:20,627 --> 00:01:23,707
Forbidden marriage? What does that mean?

14
00:01:23,707 --> 00:01:25,630
What that means is this!

15
00:01:28,084 --> 00:01:30,437
The marriage ban

16
00:01:30,437 --> 00:01:34,677
is a policy that is put into action while the royal family searches for a new queen or crown princess.

17
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:37,767
Simply said, the royals consider themselves a priority,

18
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:41,497
so they prohibit marriage for all females who are of age.

19
00:01:41,497 --> 00:01:43,027
That is what it means.

20
00:01:43,027 --> 00:01:45,337
What is this? Does that mean I cannot meet my future wife?

21
00:01:45,337 --> 00:01:47,477
If I am not married, I cannot meet a husband?

22
00:01:47,477 --> 00:01:50,627
But look at the time we live in!

23
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:53,637
A male and female cannot be in the same place if they're older than seven.

24
00:01:56,147 --> 00:02:01,517
A man and a woman cannot meet and share affection freely.

25
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:10,750

26
00:02:13,094 --> 00:02:17,177
Until marriage, they cannot even touch each other's hands.

27
00:02:17,177 --> 00:02:19,407
And they dare forbid marriage for us?

28
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:22,617
They are too much!

29
00:02:22,617 --> 00:02:26,877
Old man, what do you think about me learning how to determine marital compatibility?

30
00:02:26,877 --> 00:02:29,387
Come on now, don't you know the meaning of the marriage ban?

31
00:02:29,387 --> 00:02:33,847
People needing to be married come to me with a bundle of money to determine their external and internal compatibility.

32
00:02:33,847 --> 00:02:36,287
Now all the compatibility readers will starve to death!

33
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:40,297
You're someone who knows one thing but you don't know something else.

34
00:02:40,297 --> 00:02:43,917
Even if the country prohibits marriage officially,

35
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:46,547
do you really think men and women can be stopped from forming relationships?

36
00:02:46,547 --> 00:02:47,487
What?

37
00:02:47,487 --> 00:02:48,877
Just wait and see.

38
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:52,937
The longer they prohibit it, the more the fervor for love will boil over.

39
00:02:52,937 --> 00:02:56,817
If you and I are in the middle of a relationship between people

40
00:02:56,817 --> 00:02:59,027
there will definitely be a clever way for us to make a living.

41
00:02:59,027 --> 00:03:01,987
Aigoo, I certainly do not have the guts for swindling.

42
00:03:01,987 --> 00:03:03,347
Leave me out of this!

43
00:03:03,347 --> 00:03:04,947
Wait, how is this swindling?

44
00:03:04,947 --> 00:03:07,067
It is natural for man and woman to pair up and live together.

45
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:09,789
The country that prohibits that is crazy!

46
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,679
Come now.

47
00:03:30,747 --> 00:03:36,677
If you must label me, call me a messenger of love for young lovers.

48
00:03:36,677 --> 00:03:40,717
♫  The youths all over the country who have fallen in love  ♫

49
00:03:40,717 --> 00:03:44,707
- Get him! 
 - Get him!

50
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:53,197
Though this line of work looks a bit rough,

51
00:03:53,197 --> 00:03:55,667
it has its rewards.

52
00:04:02,097 --> 00:04:05,367
Forget about marriage in this lifetime anyway.

53
00:04:05,367 --> 00:04:08,497
Let us go for one shot at life!

54
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:11,237
Let us go!

55
00:04:16,477 --> 00:04:20,297
If you desire, I can find you a lady.

56
00:04:20,297 --> 00:04:21,377
Did she say "a lady"?

57
00:04:21,377 --> 00:04:27,677
And with this amount of money, I can even set up a secret marriage ceremony.

58
00:04:30,657 --> 00:04:32,877
- Search the premises!
 - Yes, sir!

59
00:04:32,877 --> 00:04:35,057
Save your money for now.

60
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:37,827
Let us be sure to meet again. All right?

61
00:04:37,827 --> 00:04:40,137
What in the world?

62
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:51,987
What do you think you're doing?

63
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:12,577
Oh, my!

64
00:05:12,577 --> 00:05:14,787
I connected you two last time!

65
00:05:14,787 --> 00:05:16,487
But why do you have that look...

66
00:05:18,757 --> 00:05:20,497
Isn't this a little too rough?

67
00:05:20,497 --> 00:05:23,550
♫  The youths all over the country  ♫

 Edict Banning Marriage

79
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:04,067
Aigoo, darn it!

80
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:06,957
What kind of tyranny is this?

81
00:06:06,957 --> 00:06:08,357
Don't you all agree?

82
00:06:08,357 --> 00:06:11,527
They enforced a marriage ban for the people, yet the king's queen selection fails every time,

83
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:12,687
and the king fathers no children.

84
00:06:12,687 --> 00:06:16,557
It has already been seven years since all the youths were forbidden to marry!

85
00:06:16,557 --> 00:06:18,867
Aigoo! What to do...

86
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:20,877
My daughter will become a virgin ghost at this point!

87
00:06:20,877 --> 00:06:22,827
Hey, hey! Take a look!

88
00:06:22,827 --> 00:06:25,667
This is my daughter. Look how pretty she is!

89
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:26,897
What a waste of beauty!

90
00:06:26,897 --> 00:06:32,097
 The Forbidden Marriage

91
00:06:32,097 --> 00:06:35,060
Ye So Rang, released!

92
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,097
When will you stop swindling?

93
00:06:41,097 --> 00:06:44,997
I need some seed money to live like a human being.

94
00:06:45,837 --> 00:06:48,117
Is this enough to make you stop?

95
00:06:49,807 --> 00:06:51,187
Old man...

96
00:06:51,187 --> 00:06:53,287
This money... Where did you get this?

97
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,467
I saved up while you were swind—

98
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:58,867
It's my savings from reading fortunes.

99
00:06:59,897 --> 00:07:04,467
This money should be enough to open a store in Insagol!

100
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:06,497
Insagol?

101
00:07:06,497 --> 00:07:09,287
Let us... go to Hanyang.* 
  (Capital city of Joseon, current day Seoul)

102
00:07:09,287 --> 00:07:11,927
Hey, you said you would not go to Hanyang!

103
00:07:11,927 --> 00:07:14,147
Your mind comes and goes due to age.

104
00:07:14,147 --> 00:07:16,427
How much longer will you wander?

105
00:07:16,427 --> 00:07:18,897
My goodness!

106
00:07:21,587 --> 00:07:24,047
 Episode 1

107
00:08:06,717 --> 00:08:09,507
Do you really have to do this?

108
00:08:09,507 --> 00:08:12,457
Yes, I must do this.

109
00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:17,417
Drugging the king's tea is a crime whose gravity is immeasurable.

110
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:19,967
We have served his majesty for so many years.

111
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:24,387
Even if I get my tongue pulled out for treason and get castrated, I must do what must be done.

112
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:26,987
But Head Eunuch, you're already...

113
00:08:28,687 --> 00:08:30,297
Never mind.

114
00:08:30,297 --> 00:08:31,557
Do not be afraid.

115
00:08:31,557 --> 00:08:34,477
This is a brave decision made for the sake of this nation, Joseon.

116
00:08:36,497 --> 00:08:39,717
Where is the girl for today's feat?

117
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:43,297
Come here.

118
00:08:47,637 --> 00:08:49,897
My name is Cho Ran.

119
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:53,657
No one can match her in Joseon when it comes to the art of yin and yang*.
 (Intercourse technique)

120
00:08:53,657 --> 00:08:58,297
With her skills, we will surely succeed in our mission to have his majesty sleep with her.

121
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:03,047
With this remedy, even an old man on the verge of becoming a corpse could father a late child.  (Biageora: Ability to stand up, unlike oneself, to accomplish the job)

122
00:09:03,047 --> 00:09:06,837
But his majesty is no ordinary man!

123
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:10,277
If we fail tonight once again, it means that his majesty

124
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:15,377
has either been castrated or is one of those who don't like women.

125
00:09:37,447 --> 00:09:38,617
 What?

126
00:09:38,617 --> 00:09:41,547
 Is this man the king?

127
00:10:07,987 --> 00:10:09,697
Who is that woman?

128
00:10:09,697 --> 00:10:13,867
Her name is Cho Ran. She is filling in for Sun Ah, who is ill.

129
00:10:13,867 --> 00:10:18,417
She will serve you some tea to help with your insomnia.

130
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,347
Is that so?

131
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:54,487
 It will be enough!

132
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,967
 I heard even one cup turns a man's body to a pillar of fire.

133
00:11:06,057 --> 00:11:10,467
If you are feeling hot, I will undress you.

134
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,800
So then... we shall take our leave.

135
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:08,857
Ja Yeon...

136
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:13,237
Ja Yeon...

137
00:12:15,547 --> 00:12:19,777
Please think of me as if I were Ja Yeon.

138
00:12:28,637 --> 00:12:33,527
Who dares to have her name pass your lips so carelessly?

139
00:12:38,297 --> 00:12:41,867
Is anyone out there!

140
00:12:41,867 --> 00:12:43,297
Oh, my goodness...

141
00:12:45,387 --> 00:12:46,987
Move!

142
00:12:50,257 --> 00:12:52,037
 Oh, dear!

143
00:12:57,927 --> 00:12:59,567
Who is responsible for this?

144
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:02,147
Please kill me, Your Majesty.

145
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:04,487
Explain yourselves!

146
00:13:04,487 --> 00:13:06,797
Why did you plot such a thing?

147
00:13:06,797 --> 00:13:12,867
So, please... could you please get married, Your Majesty?

148
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:26,477
You must have had enough of this life.

149
00:13:26,477 --> 00:13:29,517
It looks as though you want to end it here?

150
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,145
I am Chief Lee Sin Won of the Royal Investigation Bureau.

151
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:54,685
It has been a while since I have been in your presence, Your Majesty.

152
00:13:56,187 --> 00:13:58,497
Everyone, leave.

153
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:07,877
What if this leads to a bloody sword fight?

154
00:14:07,877 --> 00:14:11,757
They have been friends for a long time. I doubt it.

155
00:14:13,047 --> 00:14:17,877
I have carried out your orders and returned, fulfilling my duties, Your Majesty.

156
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:21,507
You are reporting in a rather extreme fashion today.

157
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:35,547
Do you also see me as a madman and a tyrant?

158
00:14:42,557 --> 00:14:45,267
You do seem that way a little bit at the moment.

159
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:02,577
Your Majesty, how can I be blind to your concerns?

160
00:15:02,577 --> 00:15:07,567
However, you must effectively address the suffering of your subjects

161
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:09,957
due to the marriage ban that has been going on for the last seven years.

162
00:15:12,907 --> 00:15:17,897
When the marriage ban is over,  do you believe you, too, will be able to marry?

163
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:23,547
You are also still searching for her.

164
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,817
That woman who disappeared.

165
00:15:30,527 --> 00:15:35,967
That is why the only one who can understand me is you.

166
00:15:37,697 --> 00:15:39,490
Sin Won,

167
00:15:40,217 --> 00:15:47,677
even if the people all point their fingers at me, I hope you remain by my side to the end.

168
00:15:50,337 --> 00:15:53,187
I will abide by your orders, Sire.

169
00:16:00,747 --> 00:16:04,047
Whoa, I have finally returned to this place.

170
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,867
Aigoo, you like coming back here looking like this?

171
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:08,357
What is there not to like?

172
00:16:08,357 --> 00:16:12,307
We have all this seed money to start!

173
00:16:12,307 --> 00:16:14,287
Let us go, go.*
 (Guh-guh sounds like "Go, go")

174
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:18,727
Hanyang, this eonni* has returned. 
   (Elder sister)

175
00:16:28,957 --> 00:16:31,227
 Let's go!

176
00:16:32,497 --> 00:16:34,607
Come and get some!

177
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:37,957
How do I look?

178
00:16:37,957 --> 00:16:40,147
- Aigoo! Can't do that!
 - Hello?

179
00:16:40,147 --> 00:16:41,927
Aigoo, how can you do that?

180
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:44,707
Is anyone here?

181
00:16:44,707 --> 00:16:46,097
Yes, yes. 
  (Realtor)

182
00:16:46,097 --> 00:16:49,197
I am looking to set up a store in Insagol.

183
00:16:49,197 --> 00:16:50,597
Yes!

184
00:16:53,147 --> 00:16:55,137
What kind of store are you looking for?

185
00:16:55,137 --> 00:16:56,667
Well, let me see...

186
00:16:56,667 --> 00:17:00,497
I am thinking of setting up a tea house in a peaceful spot.

187
00:17:00,497 --> 00:17:02,227
A tea house?

188
00:17:02,227 --> 00:17:04,897
There are several places nearby for a tea house.

189
00:17:04,897 --> 00:17:06,147
- Let us go.
 - Yes, let us.

190
00:17:06,147 --> 00:17:07,147
All right.

191
00:17:07,147 --> 00:17:09,897
All right, come this way.

192
00:17:09,897 --> 00:17:14,667
 Urgent Sale: Tearfully Going Out of Business 
 This place is near the capital, so there's a lot of foot traffic.

193
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:17,147
Hey, hey... wait...

194
00:17:17,147 --> 00:17:18,217
Wait!

195
00:17:18,217 --> 00:17:19,767
 Urgent Sale: Tearfully Going Out of Business

196
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:23,767
Look, how about here? It's good, right?

197
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:25,467
 Tearful Closing Sale, Everything Is One Nyang

198
00:17:25,467 --> 00:17:27,537
 Farewell to Marriage

199
00:17:33,377 --> 00:17:35,317
All right, over here...

200
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:42,057
Old man!

201
00:17:45,937 --> 00:17:49,077
Would you like to see some more?

202
00:17:49,077 --> 00:17:52,267
No, we will settle for this one.

203
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,390
 Ae

204
00:18:04,937 --> 00:18:10,437
 Aedaldang

205
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:18,377
 Aedaldang: Place Where Love is Mastered 
 Aedaldang, you say.

206
00:18:18,377 --> 00:18:21,397
You plan to read compatibility here?

207
00:18:21,397 --> 00:18:24,267
And what if people fall in love and get married?

208
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:26,477
You will be arrested right away!

209
00:18:26,477 --> 00:18:30,187
So... do you plan to report us?

210
00:18:30,187 --> 00:18:31,547
Well, no.

211
00:18:31,547 --> 00:18:36,537
As long as I am paid, I am done here.

212
00:18:46,807 --> 00:18:48,597
Oh, shoot.

213
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,117
So, there are already rumors about yesterday?

214
00:18:58,117 --> 00:19:01,527
Unexpectedly, Biageora is all sold out.

215
00:19:01,527 --> 00:19:04,087
My goodness. On top of that!

216
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:05,217
On top of that, what?

217
00:19:05,217 --> 00:19:08,757
The ghost of the Crown Princess, who met an unjust death, appears in the palace,

218
00:19:08,757 --> 00:19:11,367
and it has blocked the marriage fortune for all the youths in our country.

219
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:13,637
There is such a rumor going around.

220
00:19:13,637 --> 00:19:16,307
You know, I heard the king has been hallucinating and all.

221
00:19:16,307 --> 00:19:19,017
Come on, what ghost?

222
00:19:19,017 --> 00:19:23,297
His Majesty...just can't forget.

223
00:19:23,297 --> 00:19:25,197
Like you, sir?

224
00:19:26,347 --> 00:19:28,967
Yes. Like me.

225
00:19:40,687 --> 00:19:47,477
So... you just let go of that woman who visited you last night?

226
00:19:48,117 --> 00:19:49,827
How would I know who sent her to me?

227
00:19:49,827 --> 00:19:52,727
Is that what is important?

228
00:19:52,727 --> 00:19:56,107
From what I hear, ambassadors from Arabia have secretly brought in

229
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:59,057
certain drugs into your palace, Queen Mother.

230
00:19:59,057 --> 00:20:02,017
Shall I start investigating that first?

231
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:07,757
So, how far were you able to go?

232
00:20:07,757 --> 00:20:09,327
Grandmother!

233
00:20:09,327 --> 00:20:12,887
Dear, I am just worried!

234
00:20:12,887 --> 00:20:16,427
I just wonder how your overall health is.

235
00:20:16,427 --> 00:20:19,277
I am also worried that the street rumors may turn out to be true.

236
00:20:19,277 --> 00:20:20,877
What rumors?

237
00:20:20,877 --> 00:20:22,597
Aigoo...

238
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,127
Never mind.

239
00:20:25,127 --> 00:20:30,557
The Gyotaejeon, the queen's quarters, should be occupied so I don't have to be plagued with doubts.

240
00:20:31,227 --> 00:20:37,727
If we fill that place recklessly, you are well aware of what may happen.

241
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:43,107
Your Majesty, the long-standing marriage ban has resulted in a serious decline in the birth rate.

242
00:20:43,107 --> 00:20:48,717
Instead of setting up a starter home for newlyweds, how can we forbid marriage?

243
00:20:48,717 --> 00:20:53,317
In a nation where no babies are born, how can speak of our future?

244
00:20:53,317 --> 00:20:58,207
Please hasten and begin the queen selection process.

245
00:20:59,087 --> 00:21:01,027
According to the rumor going around,

246
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:03,967
you may be a tyrant who has gone mad

247
00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:07,297
or someone who craves men

248
00:21:13,277 --> 00:21:16,207
or a eunuch who cannot function as a man.

249
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:20,977
Is it not a relief, though?

250
00:21:20,977 --> 00:21:24,497
None of them actually apply to Your Majesty.

251
00:21:24,497 --> 00:21:29,507
And isn't it you who views me in such a manner, Minister of Defense?

252
00:21:29,507 --> 00:21:34,937
I am simply relaying the gossip among the people who gather every night to chat.

253
00:21:34,937 --> 00:21:40,917
So, if you abolish the marriage prohibition, it will put everyone at ease.

254
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:44,267
Was this ever something attached to me?

255
00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:48,797
Why? You are attached* to it, are you not?
 (Alluding to his testicles)

256
00:21:52,497 --> 00:21:53,667
Minister!

257
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:57,247
Young people are busy preparing for exams and looking for employment these days

258
00:21:57,247 --> 00:22:00,507
so much that they claim they can't afford marriage or children.

259
00:22:00,507 --> 00:22:06,197
The way I see it, whether we lift the edict or not, the situation will not change very much.

260
00:22:06,197 --> 00:22:11,347
Why do you take for granted that you have the right to take away people's rights?

261
00:22:11,347 --> 00:22:13,777
Everyone, please listen.

262
00:22:13,777 --> 00:22:18,527
As this Marriage Ban Edict should not stay in place too much longer,

263
00:22:18,527 --> 00:22:25,357
I will make sure to select a queen by the end of the year and put an end to the ban.

264
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:32,277
It is already the third queen selection in the past seven years.

265
00:22:32,277 --> 00:22:36,117
Did you not cancel all the previous selections, unfortunately?

266
00:22:36,117 --> 00:22:38,657
But that will not happen again this time.

267
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:42,447
How can you guarantee anything in life?

268
00:22:42,447 --> 00:22:46,547
You speak as if this upcoming selection process is bound to fail as well.

269
00:22:46,547 --> 00:22:47,940
Of course not, Your Majesty.

270
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:53,610
It all stems from my dedication to your security.

271
00:22:58,897 --> 00:23:00,917
My security, you say...

272
00:23:02,107 --> 00:23:04,837
My security...

273
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:09,987
Your Majesty.

274
00:23:11,107 --> 00:23:13,247
Where are you headed, Sire?

275
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:22,637
Regarding my security, should I not be the one to rise above the threat?

276
00:23:22,637 --> 00:23:25,057
I will head to my late wife's dwelling place.

277
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:28,357
Your Majesty!

278
00:24:09,707 --> 00:24:12,757
What is all this?

279
00:24:12,757 --> 00:24:14,847
Please follow me.

280
00:24:27,027 --> 00:24:28,647
Heon-i.

281
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:34,447
Oh, just...

282
00:24:34,447 --> 00:24:37,397
Please call me that just once.

283
00:24:37,397 --> 00:24:40,107
Yi Heon. Heon...

284
00:24:40,107 --> 00:24:44,007
Heon-i. Heon-i. Heon-i. Heon-i. Heon-i!

285
00:24:50,787 --> 00:24:55,577
How can I speak your name so casually, Your Highness?

286
00:24:55,577 --> 00:25:01,227
Crown Princess, how is it that you do not fully open up to me?

287
00:25:01,227 --> 00:25:06,007
How can I relax when showing my dedication toward you?

288
00:25:06,697 --> 00:25:10,697
Dedication? No, I don't really like dedication. I want to be adored.

289
00:25:10,697 --> 00:25:15,397
While you're at it, love and affection given to your husband. How about that?

290
00:25:27,677 --> 00:25:30,007
Surprise!

291
00:25:30,007 --> 00:25:32,627
I brought some sweet alcohol tonight.

292
00:25:32,627 --> 00:25:36,097
That way, our relationship can also become sweeter.

293
00:25:45,047 --> 00:25:47,537
I am both thankful and sorry

294
00:25:47,537 --> 00:25:52,117
that you always cherish me so.

295
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:57,017
It's because you are lovable,

296
00:25:57,017 --> 00:25:59,410
that you are receiving such love.

297
00:26:00,147 --> 00:26:02,717
Even such beautiful feelings

298
00:26:02,717 --> 00:26:05,017
can cause misunderstandings among the public.

299
00:26:05,017 --> 00:26:08,067
For a husband to love his own wife?

300
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,267
Because, Your Highness...

301
00:26:12,267 --> 00:26:16,847
you must not show any type of weakness.

302
00:26:21,387 --> 00:26:24,237
There is no windstorm.

303
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:30,517
The ocean does not become stagnant because of the wind and waves.

304
00:26:30,517 --> 00:26:32,487
Underneath the calm facade of these waters,

305
00:26:32,487 --> 00:26:37,190
I am saying it may be stagnant.

306
00:26:38,007 --> 00:26:40,177
If the power stays in one place too long, it too becomes corrupt.

307
00:26:40,177 --> 00:26:42,987
That is why a windstorm is needed to turn the tide.

308
00:26:42,987 --> 00:26:47,157
A windstorm that will change this nation may be necessary,

309
00:26:47,157 --> 00:26:52,457
but those without a tether could end up being carried away by the waters.

310
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:56,397
So, there is no tether for you, Crown Princess?

311
00:26:57,197 --> 00:27:01,017
How about I become that tether? I will be that tether for you.

312
00:27:01,017 --> 00:27:06,557
Your Highness, you must separate love from affairs of state.

313
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:28,077
If I get caught in the storm that blows through the palace,

314
00:27:28,077 --> 00:27:30,457
and even though I drift apart from you,

315
00:27:30,457 --> 00:27:35,047
please do not worry and take care of yourself, Your Highness.

316
00:27:35,047 --> 00:27:39,487
Why would we... drift apart?

317
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:44,117
Then promise me this.

318
00:27:44,117 --> 00:27:48,337
That you will take care of yourself, Crown Princess.

319
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:16,807
Are you saying you cannot promise me this?

320
00:28:45,217 --> 00:28:49,797
Please... take good care of yourself, Your Highness.

321
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:13,457
- No, Your Highness! 
 - Move...

322
00:29:13,457 --> 00:29:16,457
- Your Highness, no.
 - Move!

323
00:29:17,437 --> 00:29:20,277
I am her husband.

324
00:29:20,277 --> 00:29:23,207
- Move out of my way.
 - To see the corpse of a criminal who committed suicide,

325
00:29:23,207 --> 00:29:26,007
will bring bad fortune upon yourself, Your Royal Highness.

326
00:29:26,007 --> 00:29:28,267
How dare you call her a criminal...

327
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,637
What do you mean by suicide?

328
00:29:30,637 --> 00:29:32,747
For certain,

329
00:29:35,527 --> 00:29:38,817
this is murder by strangulation. It's murder!

330
00:29:38,817 --> 00:29:41,497
This is murder!

331
00:29:41,497 --> 00:29:44,407
Your Highness...

332
00:29:46,717 --> 00:29:48,777
Your Highness...

333
00:29:48,777 --> 00:29:50,467
Let go of me!

334
00:29:50,467 --> 00:29:53,167
Who dares to kill the Crown Princess?

335
00:29:54,197 --> 00:29:55,967
Who dares...

336
00:29:57,329 --> 00:30:01,417
Crown Princess, why are you lying here like this...

337
00:30:01,417 --> 00:30:05,547
Please, open your eyes... Oh, no...

338
00:30:07,657 --> 00:30:11,927
Look! Call the royal physician right away!

339
00:30:11,927 --> 00:30:16,327
Why are you lying here like this... Oh, no, Ja Yeon...

340
00:30:16,327 --> 00:30:20,837
Ja Yeon, please open your eyes, I beg you... Oh, no...

341
00:30:23,157 --> 00:30:25,387
Your Highness.

342
00:30:25,387 --> 00:30:27,797
Your Majesty! Please, don't be like this.

343
00:30:27,797 --> 00:30:30,887
- Please go back, Your Majesty! 
  - Your Majesty!

344
00:30:30,887 --> 00:30:33,177
I need to rise above everything.

345
00:30:33,177 --> 00:30:35,447
Those who don't know what happened could say so.

346
00:30:35,447 --> 00:30:37,097
However, not us.

347
00:30:37,097 --> 00:30:39,047
Please do not enter, Your Majesty!

348
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:40,877
Move out of the way.

349
00:30:40,877 --> 00:30:44,217
- Your Majesty!
 - Your Majesty!

350
00:31:30,017 --> 00:31:31,927
Crown Princess?

351
00:31:40,927 --> 00:31:43,587
Please come here, Crown Princess.

352
00:31:52,937 --> 00:31:54,417
It was suicide for sure, I'm telling you.

353
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:56,317
She took that fatal step because of her inability to adjust to palace life.

354
00:31:56,317 --> 00:31:59,897
Such a disloyal crown princess who left you behind must never be forgiven.

355
00:31:59,897 --> 00:32:03,487
Who says that? Who says this was a suicide?

356
00:32:03,487 --> 00:32:05,937
Who dares to say that?

357
00:32:22,487 --> 00:32:24,947
Crown... Crown Princess...

358
00:32:24,947 --> 00:32:29,037
Crown Princess? Crown Princess?

359
00:32:29,037 --> 00:32:32,437
Crown Princess, weren't you just here?

360
00:32:33,547 --> 00:32:38,587
Crown Princess! I am over here!

361
00:32:38,587 --> 00:32:41,587
I swear you were here just now!

362
00:32:44,137 --> 00:32:45,547
Ja Yeon...

363
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,647
Your Majesty.

364
00:32:47,647 --> 00:32:49,697
Yes, Sin Won, there you are.

365
00:32:49,697 --> 00:32:53,797
The crown princess. She was just here. Didn't you see her?

366
00:33:10,377 --> 00:33:14,027
She was really just here a moment ago.

367
00:33:23,517 --> 00:33:28,317
Your Majesty. You promised to take a new queen this year

368
00:33:28,317 --> 00:33:31,197
and end the marriage ban.

369
00:33:32,945 --> 00:33:36,367
If you keep hallucinating about the deceased crown princess,

370
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:39,497
how will you be able to accept a new queen?

371
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:45,447
You must forget her.

372
00:33:45,447 --> 00:33:49,557
Will that... be possible in this lifetime?

373
00:33:49,557 --> 00:33:53,807
It's a lost cause in this lifetime.

374
00:33:57,169 --> 00:34:00,777
Even if you gift all sorts of valuables and treasures,

375
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:03,217
will that be enough to capture a woman's heart?

376
00:34:03,217 --> 00:34:08,160
Instead of that, why not come inside and chat over some tea?

377
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:12,677
I will give you the best advice on how to win over a woman's heart!

378
00:34:12,677 --> 00:34:14,287
I do not love any woman.

379
00:34:14,287 --> 00:34:17,807
How dare you try to swindle us by lying?

380
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:20,607
But that... Surely, you did not buy that for your mother?

381
00:34:20,607 --> 00:34:23,507
- This is nonsense. 
 - Looks like a quack to me.

382
00:34:23,507 --> 00:34:26,377
- More like a swindler. 
 - But—

383
00:34:26,377 --> 00:34:31,907
Come now. No matter how hard you try, you cannot find a woman to love.

384
00:34:31,907 --> 00:34:33,607
How can it be explained by words alone?

385
00:34:33,607 --> 00:34:35,987
Even after we pass the current situation of the marriage ban.

386
00:34:35,987 --> 00:34:40,997
No, you will not be allowed to marry even after a hundred or a thousand years.

387
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:45,397
You don't even know how painful that is...

388
00:34:45,397 --> 00:34:47,317
Is he in your category, old man?

389
00:34:47,317 --> 00:34:50,427
Stop deceiving yourselves,

390
00:34:50,427 --> 00:34:54,177
and start accepting and loving yourself.

391
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:57,237
Loving yourself is the most important thing in the world.

392
00:34:57,237 --> 00:34:59,007
Yes, of course.

393
00:34:59,887 --> 00:35:01,817
Thank you, old man.

394
00:35:03,087 --> 00:35:06,547
- Hey, take me with you! 
 - What's going on?

395
00:35:06,547 --> 00:35:08,257
I guess that old man is for real.

396
00:35:08,257 --> 00:35:11,107
As expected! As expected of Sir Gwaeng Yi.

397
00:35:11,107 --> 00:35:14,137
He's called Sir Gok Gwaeng Yi* because he's able 
 (= "pickaxe")

398
00:35:14,137 --> 00:35:15,907
to dig into people's hearts with his spiritual channeling.

399
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:19,067
Here, here. If you have anything you want to know about your love life,

400
00:35:19,067 --> 00:35:20,617
please come to Aedaldang.

401
00:35:20,617 --> 00:35:22,717
Please come!

402
00:35:22,717 --> 00:35:25,537
 Aedaldang

403
00:35:25,537 --> 00:35:27,267
You!

404
00:35:27,267 --> 00:35:32,907
Hey! I told you not to make up nonsense with your non-existent channeling ability!

405
00:35:32,907 --> 00:35:36,907
My keen eye is more accurate than your on-and-off channeling ability.

406
00:35:36,907 --> 00:35:38,237
So why are you suddenly making a fuss about this?

407
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:40,207
We're now in the capital city!

408
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:41,977
We're no longer wandering about!

409
00:35:41,977 --> 00:35:44,417
And I told you that we should not do business in the daytime.

410
00:35:44,417 --> 00:35:46,917
Are you trying to get me arrested by doing business and promoting like that?

411
00:35:46,917 --> 00:35:50,037
You're making my heart beat so fast that I'm going to lose my mind!

412
00:35:50,037 --> 00:35:53,207
Whom are you trying to blame for you becoming senile?

413
00:35:53,207 --> 00:35:57,047
But hey, it's a bit of a shame to hear

414
00:35:57,047 --> 00:35:59,527
that the handsome young master was on "that side".

415
00:35:59,527 --> 00:36:03,737
I once was as handsome as he was.

416
00:36:03,737 --> 00:36:05,537
- Right, let me try slapping you in the face. Come here. 
 - How dare you!

417
00:36:05,537 --> 00:36:08,347
- Come here-  
 - How dare you!

418
00:36:08,347 --> 00:36:14,097
Well... So... Is this Aedaldang, by any chance?

419
00:36:14,987 --> 00:36:17,877
I heard you were looking for an employee.

420
00:36:25,337 --> 00:36:26,967
Your name is Hae Yeong.

421
00:36:26,967 --> 00:36:28,777
You used to work in a rice soup restaurant,

422
00:36:28,777 --> 00:36:30,497
and you stopped working for a while.

423
00:36:30,497 --> 00:36:35,637
Oh, finding a job these days is really difficult these days.

424
00:36:35,637 --> 00:36:40,177
 My Scholar from the Star  
 Ten years ago, you fell in love with raunchy romance novels and became a master.

425
00:36:40,177 --> 00:36:41,810
No!

426
00:36:42,707 --> 00:36:43,597
Let me see.

427
00:36:43,597 --> 00:36:46,237
Oh, "My Scholar from the Star,"

428
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:48,017
"The Heirs of Arabia,"

429
00:36:48,017 --> 00:36:49,857
and "Concubines of the Sun"?

430
00:36:49,857 --> 00:36:52,247
Oh, let me explain...

431
00:36:58,467 --> 00:37:02,237
I give you this lanyard to show you've been hired.

432
00:37:02,237 --> 00:37:03,447
Excuse me?

433
00:37:03,447 --> 00:37:06,367
As a permanent employee, of course.

434
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:08,837
All right!

435
00:37:08,837 --> 00:37:11,957
Thank you! I'll work really hard, I promise!

436
00:37:13,387 --> 00:37:15,547
 Hae Yeong is accepted into Aedaldang!

437
00:37:19,357 --> 00:37:20,957
All right.

438
00:37:22,557 --> 00:37:24,617
 Aedaldang

439
00:37:28,067 --> 00:37:32,090
 A risky hub for relationships during a time when marriages are forbidden.

440
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:36,090
 We really needed someone who's experienced in that field.

441
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:40,287
If you hold onto this well,

442
00:37:40,287 --> 00:37:43,467
you will find a man who will bring you 30 years of great fortune.

443
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:44,717
Really?

444
00:37:44,717 --> 00:37:46,457
Thank you! Thank you!

445
00:37:46,457 --> 00:37:48,027
All right, next.

446
00:37:48,027 --> 00:37:50,167
How's the taste of the tea?

447
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:52,937
So, are you going to do a compatibility assessment?

448
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:07,097
I heard that young ladies are disappearing every night these days

449
00:38:07,097 --> 00:38:09,650
and only come back in the early morning.

450
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:13,667
Where do you think they're going to, at such a late hour?

451
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:16,707
- Is it perhaps-
 - Is it true?

452
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,200
What the people say about me nightly when they gather...

453
00:38:25,564 --> 00:38:28,897
That you are a mad tyrant?

454
00:38:28,897 --> 00:38:30,597
No, not that one.

455
00:38:30,597 --> 00:38:33,427
Oh, that you are either castrated or you prefer m—

456
00:38:38,757 --> 00:38:43,127
I must go personally and check to see if what I have heard is true.

457
00:38:43,127 --> 00:38:45,907
P-Personally check...

458
00:38:46,997 --> 00:38:48,827
Welcome to Aedaldang.

459
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:49,767
Welcome!

460
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:51,027
I heard you are really good at fortune-telling here.

461
00:38:51,027 --> 00:38:53,967
Yes, that's right! How did you know?

462
00:38:56,687 --> 00:38:58,347
Aedaldang?

463
00:38:58,347 --> 00:39:00,327
Welcome! Welcome.

464
00:39:00,327 --> 00:39:01,697
It's a bit suspicious.

465
00:39:01,697 --> 00:39:03,407
It's a bit suspicious.

466
00:39:06,247 --> 00:39:07,677
It is.

467
00:39:10,477 --> 00:39:13,117
You did the right thing by coming here.

468
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:18,417
All right. Once I draw one more line
on this identification tablet...

469
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:20,247
 24 years old

470
00:39:25,117 --> 00:39:27,167
 (Draws an extra line, turning the two into a three)

471
00:39:29,097 --> 00:39:31,387
 34 years old

472
00:39:33,557 --> 00:39:36,797
Look. We turn someone in her twenties
into someone in her thirties.

473
00:39:36,797 --> 00:39:38,337
What happens if you're ten years older?

474
00:39:38,337 --> 00:39:40,407
Since you would be older than 25,

475
00:39:40,407 --> 00:39:45,417
you will no longer be forbidden from marriage but be able to marry happily!

476
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:47,987
But if I say I'm 34,

477
00:39:47,987 --> 00:39:50,357
will they believe me?

478
00:39:50,357 --> 00:39:51,637
Of course!

479
00:39:51,637 --> 00:39:55,627
Just say you look young for your age.

480
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:58,797
I feel like we're at the scene of a marriage fraud.

481
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:03,517
Why is this darn marriage ban edict lasting so long?

482
00:40:03,517 --> 00:40:04,817
Well, well.

483
00:40:04,817 --> 00:40:06,407
You still don't know the reason?

484
00:40:06,407 --> 00:40:11,737
They say that the king of this nation is either castrated or prefers the love of men.

485
00:40:11,737 --> 00:40:13,897
Which of the two is he, exactly?

486
00:40:13,897 --> 00:40:16,887
From what I can see,

487
00:40:16,887 --> 00:40:17,877
I think he's castrated.

488
00:40:17,877 --> 00:40:19,657
If he had even some of the working parts,

489
00:40:19,657 --> 00:40:22,667
do you think the marriage ban would have lasted seven years?

490
00:40:23,357 --> 00:40:25,147
Let go of me.

491
00:40:25,147 --> 00:40:26,257
So, how could I...

492
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,727
Do I need to show her? Should I pull down my pants

493
00:40:28,727 --> 00:40:31,067
and show her? Do I show her?

494
00:40:32,917 --> 00:40:36,007
If I write a love letter for you, it will be two nyang,

495
00:40:36,007 --> 00:40:38,537
including express delivery.

496
00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:39,997
I'll do that!

497
00:40:39,997 --> 00:40:42,157
What if you get caught doing that?

498
00:40:42,157 --> 00:40:44,577
I heard that they are cracking down on even love letters.

499
00:40:44,577 --> 00:40:48,067
Do you know how many couples I have brought together, going from one corner of Joseon to the other?

500
00:40:48,067 --> 00:40:51,457
I don't get caught!

501
00:40:52,797 --> 00:40:55,517
You are under arrest!

502
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:06,477
So, you are the infamous marriage swindler?

503
00:41:07,777 --> 00:41:09,347
Me?

504
00:41:09,347 --> 00:41:10,837
That's not me.

505
00:41:10,837 --> 00:41:13,137
- Arrest her!
   -Yes, sir!

506
00:41:24,347 --> 00:41:26,027
Are you all right...

507
00:41:48,117 --> 00:41:49,827
 This woman...

508
00:41:58,047 --> 00:41:59,347
 Did I just...

509
00:41:59,347 --> 00:42:01,887
 run into the arms of the Royal Investigation Bureau?

510
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:03,790
 Damn it, I'm doomed!

511
00:42:13,647 --> 00:42:15,337
So...

512
00:42:15,337 --> 00:42:17,107
it's that woman.

513
00:42:20,667 --> 00:42:23,737
Giddy up!

514
00:42:28,187 --> 00:42:29,857
Young lady...

515
00:42:29,857 --> 00:42:31,087
Giddy up!

516
00:42:31,087 --> 00:42:33,697
Where are you going in such a rush?

517
00:42:33,697 --> 00:42:35,327
Damn it!

518
00:42:45,717 --> 00:42:47,747
Did you prepare it?

519
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,027
You are under arrest.

520
00:44:20,027 --> 00:44:22,817
W-Why would I be?

521
00:44:24,937 --> 00:44:27,217
You dare to insult the king?

522
00:44:31,517 --> 00:44:33,277
Hey, hey!

523
00:44:33,277 --> 00:44:35,127
Let me go!

524
00:44:35,127 --> 00:44:36,467
Ah, you're so loud!

525
00:44:36,467 --> 00:44:38,587
Be quiet!

526
00:44:44,017 --> 00:44:45,797
A marriage swindler, I see.

527
00:44:45,797 --> 00:44:49,897
Why are you committing marriage fraud at a time such as this?

528
00:44:54,137 --> 00:44:55,897
Sir.

529
00:44:56,487 --> 00:44:59,177
Have you ever heard of the Matchmaking god?

530
00:44:59,177 --> 00:45:02,827
The matchmaker connects the pinky fingers of a couple destined to be together

531
00:45:02,827 --> 00:45:05,017
with a red string of fate.

532
00:45:05,017 --> 00:45:10,167
So, how could a national edict sever such a connection?

533
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:12,477
A destined connection cannot be severed, you say?

534
00:45:12,477 --> 00:45:15,867
All I did was just help others follow where that string led.

535
00:45:15,867 --> 00:45:19,487
I have never done anything evil.

536
00:45:26,277 --> 00:45:28,727
What is your name?

537
00:45:28,727 --> 00:45:31,777
My name is So Rang.

538
00:45:31,777 --> 00:45:33,967
To form a connection...

539
00:45:33,967 --> 00:45:35,887
No matter how hard I tried,

540
00:45:35,887 --> 00:45:37,977
some relationships never work out.

541
00:45:37,977 --> 00:45:41,677
It appears that you have not been able to see

542
00:45:41,677 --> 00:45:44,717
a person you have been loving deeply for a long time.

543
00:45:44,717 --> 00:45:46,057
You wicked girl!

544
00:45:46,057 --> 00:45:47,837
How dare you try to commit fraud here!

545
00:45:47,837 --> 00:45:50,377
You're trying to commit fraud against the Royal Investigation Bureau chief?

546
00:45:50,377 --> 00:45:53,107
This girl will end up in big trouble one day.

547
00:45:53,107 --> 00:45:55,407
Although we live in a time where marrying is a crime,

548
00:45:55,407 --> 00:45:57,907
having feelings for someone is not a crime.

549
00:45:57,907 --> 00:46:01,297
If that's a crime, then you're also a criminal, sir.

550
00:46:01,297 --> 00:46:05,600
Do you not already have feelings for her?

551
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:09,567
Everyone living in Joseon would be a criminal

552
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:13,137
for having feelings for another.

553
00:46:15,977 --> 00:46:18,007
Until you repent for your crime,

554
00:46:18,007 --> 00:46:20,837
you will not be released from this prison.

555
00:46:20,837 --> 00:46:23,547
What? W-Wait!

556
00:46:29,347 --> 00:46:31,657
Wow!

557
00:46:31,657 --> 00:46:33,647
Your speech was amazing!

558
00:46:33,647 --> 00:46:36,197
"Everyone who lives in Joseon would then be a criminal,

559
00:46:36,197 --> 00:46:39,377
for having feelings for another."

560
00:46:39,377 --> 00:46:41,107
- What is this...
 - Then...

561
00:46:41,107 --> 00:46:45,537
do you think people like us will be able to find a partner?

562
00:46:45,537 --> 00:46:47,327
Who are you?

563
00:46:49,327 --> 00:46:51,127
If love is a crime, then we are criminals.

564
00:46:51,127 --> 00:46:54,217
- We've never been in a relationship before.
 - I'm Wang Bae.

565
00:46:54,217 --> 00:46:56,087
 (Seol Ro: Someone who has a hard time talking to the opposite sex)

566
00:46:56,087 --> 00:46:58,157
I'm Oh Deok Hun.

567
00:46:58,157 --> 00:47:00,477
 Seoll Ro*
 (=Solo)

568
00:47:00,477 --> 00:47:03,207
How dare they try to pull one like that?

569
00:47:04,507 --> 00:47:07,907
Since it's fate that we've met like this, please help us.

570
00:47:07,907 --> 00:47:10,387
Hey, don't even talk with these guys.

571
00:47:10,387 --> 00:47:13,537
They got caught spying on women washing their hair in the creek.

572
00:47:13,537 --> 00:47:15,537
- What do you mean we were spying!
 - Spying?

573
00:47:15,537 --> 00:47:16,927
I said we went there to wash as well.

574
00:47:16,927 --> 00:47:18,947
Hurry up and pull out your head!

575
00:47:19,547 --> 00:47:21,177
Geez.

576
00:47:23,847 --> 00:47:26,437
I want everyone to leave me be.

577
00:47:28,477 --> 00:47:30,827
Wow.

578
00:47:30,827 --> 00:47:33,637
Man, how long has it been?

579
00:47:33,637 --> 00:47:35,177
Wow.

580
00:47:40,047 --> 00:47:42,397
How do I get out of here?

581
00:47:45,467 --> 00:47:48,557
To think that I came all the way here

582
00:47:48,557 --> 00:47:50,430
for such a petty criminal...

583
00:47:51,887 --> 00:47:55,467
Your Majesty, you need to hurry up and return.

584
00:47:55,467 --> 00:47:57,757
Let us do that.

585
00:47:59,437 --> 00:48:02,187
 You wretches!

586
00:48:03,177 --> 00:48:06,980
Do you know who I am that you're holding me in here?

587
00:48:07,587 --> 00:48:09,127
I am...

588
00:48:10,657 --> 00:48:13,420
the Matchmaker god!

589
00:48:14,197 --> 00:48:16,247
 The Matchmaker god?

590
00:48:16,247 --> 00:48:18,257
H-Hey, hey! Look over there...

591
00:48:18,257 --> 00:48:20,487
Is she being possessed?

592
00:48:20,487 --> 00:48:23,847
Since she's a fortune teller, I guess the spirit comes in and out of her at times.

593
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:27,447
I, the Matchmaker god, say

594
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:30,997
that the Marriage Ban Edict will end this year!

595
00:48:30,997 --> 00:48:34,557
She says the Marriage Ban Edict will end!

596
00:48:34,557 --> 00:48:38,077
Does that mean a new queen will be selected this year?

597
00:48:38,077 --> 00:48:39,567
However,

598
00:48:39,567 --> 00:48:43,377
if the king does not get rid of the spirit of the dead crown princess that is in him,

599
00:48:43,377 --> 00:48:49,317
the life of the new queen would also be in danger.

600
00:48:49,317 --> 00:48:51,667
If that happens, you all

601
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:58,167
- will have to live as Seol Ro forever!
  - No!

602
00:48:58,877 --> 00:49:01,057
She's been arrested for committing fraud.

603
00:49:01,057 --> 00:49:02,767
Do you all actually believe her?

604
00:49:02,767 --> 00:49:06,357
Seol Ro!

605
00:49:06,357 --> 00:49:09,197
I, the Matchmaker god, say

606
00:49:09,197 --> 00:49:12,697
that if the Marriage Ban Edict does not end by this year,

607
00:49:12,697 --> 00:49:15,537
there will be great woe upon this palace.

608
00:49:15,537 --> 00:49:17,627
There will be

609
00:49:17,627 --> 00:49:20,897
a plague of Seol Ro in this nation!

610
00:49:20,897 --> 00:49:24,077
 A plague of being Seol Ro!

611
00:49:27,307 --> 00:49:29,237
Sin Won.

612
00:49:30,377 --> 00:49:32,987
At the hour of the swine*,
  (between 9 p.m. - 11 p.m.)  bring her to me.

613
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:47,837
Criminal, listen to me.

614
00:49:47,837 --> 00:49:51,047
Your crime has fallen upon the ears of the king.

615
00:49:51,047 --> 00:49:52,517
What?

616
00:49:53,267 --> 00:49:54,087
Wait, what?

617
00:49:54,087 --> 00:49:56,647
The king will interrogate you himself,

618
00:49:56,647 --> 00:49:57,537
so prepare yourself.

619
00:49:57,537 --> 00:50:00,397
The king h-himself?

620
00:50:08,457 --> 00:50:10,477
Hey, hey...

621
00:50:10,477 --> 00:50:13,057
W-Why am I seeing the king?

622
00:50:13,057 --> 00:50:17,837
Does a lowly commoner like me usually see the king for something like this?

623
00:50:27,197 --> 00:50:28,117
Hey!

624
00:50:28,117 --> 00:50:30,347
 Since you cannot meet the king looking like this,

625
00:50:30,347 --> 00:50:32,577
 change your clothes first.

626
00:50:52,587 --> 00:50:54,647
Prostrate yourself.

627
00:51:01,527 --> 00:51:03,727
Lift your head.

628
00:51:08,797 --> 00:51:11,407
So, you have a channeling ability.

629
00:51:12,677 --> 00:51:14,307
Well, that's not entirely true...

630
00:51:14,307 --> 00:51:16,527
It comes and goes.

631
00:51:16,527 --> 00:51:18,627
I go back and forth, sir.

632
00:51:18,627 --> 00:51:22,007
Supposedly, the Matchmaker god came into you earlier?

633
00:51:22,677 --> 00:51:24,997
Well, that...

634
00:51:24,997 --> 00:51:28,297
was not intended, but yes.

635
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:30,880
Lift your head and speak.

636
00:51:31,527 --> 00:51:34,747
Do I really have a spirit attached to me?

637
00:51:44,967 --> 00:51:46,577
 He's the king?

638
00:51:46,577 --> 00:51:47,807
 Whoa, daebak.

639
00:51:47,807 --> 00:51:49,247
 He's a flower boy.

640
00:51:49,247 --> 00:51:53,917
 But his face looks like he hasn't slept for a few days, is gaunt, and his eyes are gloomy.

641
00:51:53,917 --> 00:51:56,067
 Even then, his face is hot, no, I mean...

642
00:51:56,067 --> 00:51:57,747
 One conclusion comes to mind.

643
00:51:57,747 --> 00:52:01,207
 It's just the face of someone hurting from losing a loved one.

644
00:52:01,207 --> 00:52:02,757
 Spirit, my foot.

645
00:52:02,757 --> 00:52:04,887
 He's being like that, been hallucinating.

646
00:52:04,887 --> 00:52:06,417
You do...

647
00:52:11,067 --> 00:52:12,897
have a spirit on you.

648
00:52:16,687 --> 00:52:20,077
You probably have trouble sleeping at night

649
00:52:20,077 --> 00:52:22,547
because it is the time when that spirit is most active.

650
00:52:22,547 --> 00:52:24,757
And even though you're not really sick,

651
00:52:24,757 --> 00:52:27,077
you have trouble eating food.

652
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:30,897
Don't you sometimes see and hear imaginary things?

653
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:34,507
And you probably felt great pain in your stomach

654
00:52:34,507 --> 00:52:37,327
as if you've been hit with a metal hammer.

655
00:52:38,137 --> 00:52:40,187
That's true.

656
00:52:40,187 --> 00:52:42,657
It hurts. It hurts a lot.

657
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:47,697
The crown princess keeps saying something in my dream,

658
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:50,320
but I just can't seem to make out what she says. What...

659
00:52:50,837 --> 00:52:53,207
is she trying to say?

660
00:52:54,497 --> 00:52:56,887
 If I knew that, I would be a true channeler.

661
00:52:56,887 --> 00:52:59,267
 What was the name of the king again?

662
00:52:59,267 --> 00:53:01,487
Heon? Yi... Yi Heon?

663
00:53:01,487 --> 00:53:03,197
Heon-i?

664
00:53:07,927 --> 00:53:10,437
I saw the crown princess' face in my dream...

665
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:13,127
but her face was so faint.

666
00:53:14,937 --> 00:53:17,927
If you truly have a channeling ability,

667
00:53:17,927 --> 00:53:20,857
could you call forth the crown princess to appear before me?

668
00:53:20,857 --> 00:53:22,117
Excuse me?

669
00:53:22,117 --> 00:53:25,987
Well, her body's already gone, though...

670
00:53:25,987 --> 00:53:27,517
Then,

671
00:53:27,517 --> 00:53:31,347
how can I believe that you have a channeling ability?

672
00:53:34,757 --> 00:53:36,777
I guess you don't have a channeling ability after all!

673
00:53:36,777 --> 00:53:38,417
Oh, no, no.

674
00:53:38,417 --> 00:53:40,717
No way!

675
00:53:57,317 --> 00:54:00,117
Although I cannot show the crown princess to you,

676
00:54:00,117 --> 00:54:04,767
it should be possible for me to channel her spirit.

677
00:54:58,297 --> 00:55:00,030
Your Highness,

678
00:55:00,507 --> 00:55:04,237
have you been well?

679
00:55:12,537 --> 00:55:15,047
Is it really you, Crown Princess?

680
00:55:15,047 --> 00:55:16,727
Let me first

681
00:55:16,727 --> 00:55:20,047
offer you a bow.

682
00:55:51,427 --> 00:55:53,837
My physical body,

683
00:55:53,837 --> 00:55:57,200
even my bones have turned to dust,

684
00:55:57,927 --> 00:55:59,227
and now,

685
00:55:59,227 --> 00:56:02,167
even my eyes, nose, and mouth have disappeared,

686
00:56:02,167 --> 00:56:07,027
and there is no more evidence that I even existed on this earth.

687
00:56:07,027 --> 00:56:11,777
However, the reason why my spirit is still here

688
00:56:11,777 --> 00:56:13,907
is because

689
00:56:14,817 --> 00:56:16,447
I am hurting so badly.

690
00:56:16,447 --> 00:56:18,047
Hur—

691
00:56:18,047 --> 00:56:20,357
Hurting? How are you hurting?

692
00:56:20,357 --> 00:56:25,347
It hurts me to see you in so much pain

693
00:56:25,347 --> 00:56:27,587
because of me, Your Highness.

694
00:56:30,417 --> 00:56:32,867
I have committed

695
00:56:33,867 --> 00:56:36,387
a great act of disloyalty

696
00:56:38,897 --> 00:56:41,910
by departing first and leaving you behind.

697
00:56:42,667 --> 00:56:45,527
I don't know how I can be forgiven for my sin.

698
00:56:47,037 --> 00:56:48,697
I am...

699
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:51,087
so sorry.

700
00:56:53,297 --> 00:56:55,987
What do you mean by that...

701
00:56:56,977 --> 00:57:00,987
It was my fault that I could not even protect my wife.

702
00:57:00,987 --> 00:57:04,147
I have been lingering around in this world

703
00:57:04,147 --> 00:57:07,807
because I was worried about you.

704
00:57:07,807 --> 00:57:10,207
So now,

705
00:57:11,357 --> 00:57:14,687
please let me go.

706
00:57:17,807 --> 00:57:19,857
What do you mean, let you go?

707
00:57:20,927 --> 00:57:23,037
Where are you going to go now?

708
00:57:23,037 --> 00:57:25,307
You have to let go of me,

709
00:57:25,307 --> 00:57:28,537
so that I can depart from this world.

710
00:58:11,707 --> 00:58:13,727
I have wanted to see you...

711
00:58:15,567 --> 00:58:17,417
even if it is like this.

712
00:58:17,417 --> 00:58:19,537
You have to

713
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:22,117
let me go now.

714
00:58:22,117 --> 00:58:25,977
You must erase any longing you have for me as well.

715
00:58:25,977 --> 00:58:28,727
Will that be possible in this life?

716
00:58:28,727 --> 00:58:30,167
The spirit of a dead person

717
00:58:30,167 --> 00:58:33,320
cannot stay very long in a living person's body.

718
00:58:34,047 --> 00:58:36,007
I...

719
00:58:37,577 --> 00:58:39,507
must go.

720
00:58:42,797 --> 00:58:44,087
Do not go.

721
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:45,267
Wait...

722
00:58:45,267 --> 00:58:48,057
Please do not go. Be with me for just a bit longer.

723
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:50,757
Please do not go.

724
00:58:50,757 --> 00:58:54,577
- Please do not go.
 - Y-Your Majesty.

725
00:58:56,337 --> 00:59:00,287
It appears that Crown Princess has left.

726
00:59:09,547 --> 00:59:11,327
Your Majesty...

727
00:59:14,997 --> 00:59:16,557
Everyone...

728
00:59:16,557 --> 00:59:18,827
Everyone, leave.

729
00:59:21,877 --> 00:59:24,557
So, what will happen to me, then?

730
00:59:24,557 --> 00:59:26,707
Put her back into the cell.

731
00:59:26,707 --> 00:59:28,307
Excuse me?

732
00:59:28,307 --> 00:59:30,327
Excuse me? W-Wait, what?

733
00:59:30,997 --> 00:59:32,357
Wait!

734
00:59:32,357 --> 00:59:35,727
I-I'm going back? Y-Your Majesty!

735
00:59:35,727 --> 00:59:38,957
Your Majesty! Don't you have more to say to Crown Princess?

736
00:59:38,957 --> 00:59:41,107
I'll deliver your message for you, Your Majesty!

737
00:59:41,107 --> 00:59:43,567
Your Majesty!

738
00:59:43,567 --> 00:59:44,957
Let me go!

739
00:59:44,957 --> 00:59:46,387
Hey!

740
00:59:46,387 --> 00:59:47,577
How did it go?

741
00:59:47,577 --> 00:59:49,107
Do not...

742
00:59:49,107 --> 00:59:51,987
talk to me!

743
00:59:51,987 --> 00:59:53,087
I told you.

744
00:59:53,087 --> 00:59:55,717
She's just plain old fraud.

745
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:59,787
Did anything happen back there?

746
01:00:00,817 --> 01:00:02,287
Chief.

747
01:00:02,287 --> 01:00:04,487
Chief Lee Sin Won!

748
01:00:05,787 --> 01:00:07,337
Lee Sin Won?

749
01:00:07,987 --> 01:00:10,367
Lee Sin Won?

750
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:11,947
What's wrong?

751
01:00:11,947 --> 01:00:13,907
Your name is Lee Sin Won, Chief?

752
01:00:13,907 --> 01:00:15,787
The willow tree family's firstborn son?

753
01:00:15,787 --> 01:00:17,297
H-How do you know that?

754
01:00:17,297 --> 01:00:19,467
That's what I used to be called.

755
01:00:19,467 --> 01:00:20,407
Well, I mean...

756
01:00:20,407 --> 01:00:25,597
 The willow tree family's firstborn son, Lee Sin Won.

757
01:00:30,497 --> 01:00:35,537
You're going to be in big trouble if you underestimate

758
01:00:35,537 --> 01:00:37,887
my channeling ability!

759
01:00:41,197 --> 01:00:43,917
How did she know

760
01:00:43,917 --> 01:00:46,127
that you're seeing apparitions?

761
01:00:47,717 --> 01:00:50,797
I thought it was just my imagination...

762
01:00:58,591 --> 01:01:02,227
 Your Majesty, please end the Marriage Ban Edict quickly!

763
01:01:02,227 --> 01:01:04,067
Who are you?

764
01:01:04,067 --> 01:01:06,727
I asked who you are!

765
01:01:06,727 --> 01:01:09,037
 - Your Majesty, the crown prince's depression is severe. 
 - Go away!

766
01:01:09,037 --> 01:01:11,717
 - Please end the  Marriage Ban Edict quickly 
 - Go away!

767
01:01:11,717 --> 01:01:13,647
 - and select the next queen.
 - Please select your next queen.

768
01:01:13,647 --> 01:01:16,857
 Your Majesty, do you remember me?

769
01:01:16,857 --> 01:01:19,517
 - Your Majesty.
 - Be quiet.

770
01:01:20,757 --> 01:01:23,667
 Supposedly, another body was left hanging in the crown princess' quarters.

771
01:01:43,197 --> 01:01:46,447
 How many days to go until the crown princess' memorial day?

772
01:01:47,607 --> 01:01:51,867
If we can't find the murderer before then,

773
01:01:51,867 --> 01:01:55,287
there will be another body of a woman hanging in the crown princess' palace.

774
01:01:55,287 --> 01:01:57,157
This is already the sixth year.

775
01:01:57,157 --> 01:02:00,217
Every year, on the same day and in the same place,

776
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:02,247
a body of a woman is left hanging.

777
01:02:02,247 --> 01:02:04,667
We could not revive any of them.

778
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:05,837
During the last selection,

779
01:02:05,837 --> 01:02:10,027
the most likely candidate selected within the inner circle died.

780
01:02:10,027 --> 01:02:14,857
That's why we canceled the selection as if it were your decision.

781
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:17,467
The Marriage Ban Edict of this nation

782
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:20,107
is essentially the plot of a traitor.

783
01:02:20,107 --> 01:02:24,267
The crown princess was not someone who would commit suicide, Royal Father!

784
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,667
Please...

785
01:02:26,667 --> 01:02:30,727
Please let me at least hold a funeral for her.

786
01:02:30,727 --> 01:02:33,007
Please, please, at least a funeral...

787
01:02:33,007 --> 01:02:35,277
Crown Prince.

788
01:02:35,277 --> 01:02:39,477
There's no way we could hold a funeral for someone who violates the law by committing suicide.

789
01:02:39,477 --> 01:02:43,267
I will personally speak with my royal father and hear what he has to say.

790
01:02:43,267 --> 01:02:47,657
I am the one who put His Majesty the king on the throne.

791
01:02:47,657 --> 01:02:50,887
Therefore, there is no need for you to hear the king's will,

792
01:02:50,887 --> 01:02:55,807
for my word is the will of the king.

793
01:02:55,807 --> 01:02:57,787
What are you all doing?

794
01:02:57,787 --> 01:03:01,067
Escort the crown prince back to his palace.

795
01:03:01,067 --> 01:03:04,207
Royal Father! Royal Father!

796
01:03:04,207 --> 01:03:08,277
However, if I manage to catch all the traitors,

797
01:03:08,277 --> 01:03:10,527
will I stop hearing these sounds

798
01:03:10,527 --> 01:03:13,317
and stop seeing these apparitions?

799
01:03:17,767 --> 01:03:20,027
Sin Won, you're here.

800
01:03:20,917 --> 01:03:22,427
I must be going crazy,

801
01:03:22,427 --> 01:03:25,427
seeing how I am glad to see these apparitions...

802
01:03:28,567 --> 01:03:30,427
If you are suffering that much,

803
01:03:30,427 --> 01:03:34,097
how about keeping her by your side?

804
01:03:34,097 --> 01:03:37,407
From what I can tell, she seemed to have some channelling ability.

805
01:03:37,407 --> 01:03:39,227
Why not keep her by your side

806
01:03:39,227 --> 01:03:42,807
and console the spirit of the deceased crown princess?

807
01:03:42,807 --> 01:03:46,657
We can have her enter the palace under the guise of an inner court maid.

808
01:03:46,657 --> 01:03:52,047
However, this will all be part of the process of letting the crown princess go.

809
01:03:52,957 --> 01:03:55,617
Would you be able to do this?

810
01:03:57,907 --> 01:03:59,387
Sin Won.

811
01:03:59,387 --> 01:04:03,297
You told me before that I need to forget her.

812
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:07,677
Could you watch over that girl when she enters the palace?

813
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,297
As you already know, the palace is...

814
01:04:10,297 --> 01:04:12,287
a bit dangerous.

815
01:04:13,597 --> 01:04:16,977
Your will is my command.

816
01:04:44,217 --> 01:04:46,207
Come out now.

817
01:04:48,817 --> 01:04:51,637
 The reason why I am still here is

818
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:53,467
 because I am

819
01:04:53,467 --> 01:04:55,247
 hurting so badly.

820
01:04:55,247 --> 01:04:59,897
 It hurts me to see you in so much pain

821
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:00,767
 because of me, Your Highness.

822
01:05:00,767 --> 01:05:03,377
 I have been lingering around the nether world because I was worried about you.

823
01:05:03,377 --> 01:05:05,897
 You have to let me go now.

824
01:05:05,897 --> 01:05:09,927
 You must erase your longing for me as well.

825
01:06:05,217 --> 01:06:06,477
Follow me.

826
01:06:06,477 --> 01:06:09,157
I will tell you where you will be staying from now on.

827
01:06:39,087 --> 01:06:41,187
Crown Princess!

828
01:06:41,187 --> 01:06:43,607
Are you here, Crown Princess?

829
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:13,690

830
01:07:17,717 --> 01:07:20,337
 I must be a bit crazy

831
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:23,427
 if I am missing even the apparitions.

832
01:07:23,427 --> 01:07:28,560
♫  On this night, where even the moon is asleep  ♫

833
01:07:29,877 --> 01:07:36,137
♫  Where are you headed in such a rush?  ♫

834
01:07:37,817 --> 01:07:41,387
♫  A night where you're headed on a long journey  ♫

835
01:07:41,387 --> 01:07:45,247
♫  Without even a word  ♫

836
01:07:45,247 --> 01:07:48,647
 The Forbidden Marriage  
  Preview

837
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:50,847
 It looks like I will have to act as a court lady from now.

838
01:07:50,847 --> 01:07:51,927
 Really?

839
01:07:51,927 --> 01:07:54,247
 I'll be entering as an inner court maid.

840
01:07:54,247 --> 01:07:55,257
 Whoa, that scared me!

841
01:07:55,257 --> 01:07:57,497
 Who made the rumbling noise?

842
01:07:57,497 --> 01:07:58,307
 Are you hungry?

843
01:07:58,307 --> 01:08:01,117
 Is the Crown Princess hungry?

844
01:08:01,117 --> 01:08:04,483
 How lost is he without her that he misses a dead person?

845
01:08:04,483 --> 01:08:06,847
 You need to help him forget her, even if it means deceiving him.

846
01:08:06,847 --> 01:08:09,797
 Will I not get taken away if they find out I deceived him?

847
01:08:09,797 --> 01:08:12,537
 I should get him on my side first.

848
01:08:12,537 --> 01:08:15,917
 If you drink that entire thing, we will be friends, all right?

849
01:08:15,917 --> 01:08:18,097
 Have you ever almost gotten married before?

850
01:08:18,097 --> 01:08:19,750
 Ye Hyeon Seon.

851
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:23,020
 Do you recognize that name by chance?

852
01:08:24,607 --> 01:08:28,167
♫  All of it is something I must carry  ♫
