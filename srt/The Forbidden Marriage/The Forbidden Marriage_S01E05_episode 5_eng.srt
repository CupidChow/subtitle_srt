 Sin Won.

3
00:00:42,554 --> 00:00:45,334
 Episode 5&gt; 
 Hey, Lee Sin Won! Why are you suddenly like this?

4
00:00:45,334 --> 00:00:49,094
Are you stupid? Are you saying you are stupid?

5
00:00:49,094 --> 00:00:51,214
Do you really not get it?

6
00:00:51,214 --> 00:00:54,374
How is it that you have no idea what's going to happen to you?

7
00:00:54,374 --> 00:00:57,114
And what is it that will happen to me?

8
00:01:00,384 --> 00:01:03,914
A royal conjugal night has been planned in the king's bedchamber tonight.

9
00:01:03,914 --> 00:01:06,600
Who do you think will be the one going in?

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:13,110

11
00:01:17,384 --> 00:01:19,294
You're lying.

12
00:01:56,864 --> 00:01:59,044
What is happening?

13
00:01:59,884 --> 00:02:02,314
It is nothing, Your Majesty.

14
00:02:06,534 --> 00:02:09,454
I asked you, what is happening?

15
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:17,424
It is cold out. Let us...

16
00:02:20,594 --> 00:02:26,394
- Tonight... I cannot let So Rang go. 
 - What did you say?

17
00:02:26,394 --> 00:02:29,764
What I mean is, I cannot let So Rang go into your bedchamber.

18
00:02:33,184 --> 00:02:36,664
It's not a decision you can make.

19
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:41,314
Are you attempting to disobey me?

20
00:02:41,314 --> 00:02:43,174
For this, at the very least,

21
00:02:44,484 --> 00:02:47,164
I cannot abide by your orders.

22
00:02:48,154 --> 00:02:52,384
Lee Sin Won. Look at me.

23
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:01,134
You no longer see me as a friend, do you?

24
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:05,354
Why are you not answering?

25
00:03:06,914 --> 00:03:10,214
What do you think my answer is?

26
00:03:10,214 --> 00:03:11,764
In that case,

27
00:03:15,174 --> 00:03:17,804
try and defeat me.

28
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:21,424
Your Majesty, do not be like this.

29
00:03:21,424 --> 00:03:24,294
Hey, Sin Won. What's gotten into you?

30
00:03:24,294 --> 00:03:27,684
Once you defeat me, you can go ahead and take her away.

31
00:03:27,684 --> 00:03:29,684
Follow me.

32
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,844
Raise your sword.

33
00:03:44,994 --> 00:03:48,424
To what point will you disobey me?

34
00:04:00,484 --> 00:04:04,284
Your Majesty, Your Majesty, put away your sword, please.

35
00:04:04,284 --> 00:04:07,214
Is not Chief Lee Sin Won a close friend of yours?

36
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:08,944
Yes...

37
00:04:08,944 --> 00:04:12,854
This close friend of mine you speak of. The tip of his sword is tainted by selfish interests.

38
00:04:14,194 --> 00:04:16,854
Tell me, am I wrong?

39
00:04:27,404 --> 00:04:30,444
Why? Are you going to only defend yourself and not attack?

40
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:33,274
I told you not to go easy on me.

41
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:50,454
You sure are making a fool out of me until the very end, huh?

42
00:05:22,134 --> 00:05:24,134
 Why are you closing your eyes?

43
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:35,794
 - You dare poke me?
 - Oh, gosh.

44
00:06:26,574 --> 00:06:28,744
Step away.

45
00:06:28,744 --> 00:06:32,244
This much is expected of a fight between two men.

46
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:53,234
So Rang was the butterfly in your garden, I see.

47
00:06:56,384 --> 00:07:01,344
Do you see me as a friend or a rival lover?

48
00:07:10,794 --> 00:07:12,974
Answer me.

49
00:07:32,004 --> 00:07:35,214
Are you trying to protect Sin Won?

50
00:07:35,214 --> 00:07:39,914
Your Majesty... I am trying to protect you.

51
00:07:39,914 --> 00:07:44,444
I am trying to protect you from yourself, Your Majesty.

52
00:07:55,354 --> 00:07:57,104
Please head into your bedchamber.

53
00:07:57,104 --> 00:08:01,174
Did you not say a royal conjugal night was planned tonight?

54
00:08:02,304 --> 00:08:04,394
A royal conjugal night?

55
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:40,944
Let him be.

56
00:08:41,974 --> 00:08:46,284
I am out of breath from tonight's sword practice.

57
00:09:15,674 --> 00:09:20,054
 We have committed a sin worthy of death, Your Majesty!

58
00:09:20,884 --> 00:09:23,504
Everyone, leave.

59
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:35,304
I said, leave.

60
00:09:50,574 --> 00:09:56,874
Or do you perhaps wish the court ladies' plan takes place?

61
00:09:59,054 --> 00:10:02,604
You raised a sword at Chief Lee Sin Won.

62
00:10:02,604 --> 00:10:07,134
In all honesty, did you have any consideration toward your friend?

63
00:10:07,134 --> 00:10:09,304
Are you taking Sin Won's side?

64
00:10:09,304 --> 00:10:12,374
I'm only saying this should not anger you, Your Majesty.

65
00:10:12,374 --> 00:10:18,854
Am I... anyone special to you? You know I am nothing to you.

66
00:10:18,854 --> 00:10:21,934
So are you saying I acted like a man engulfed in jealousy?

67
00:10:21,934 --> 00:10:24,194
Your Majesty has yet to...

68
00:10:26,184 --> 00:10:28,004
Yet what?

69
00:10:34,524 --> 00:10:38,794
It is nothing. I will take my leave now.

70
00:10:46,184 --> 00:10:49,064
As I said before,

71
00:10:49,064 --> 00:10:52,654
all court ladies belong to the  king.

72
00:10:52,654 --> 00:10:58,614
Then... I must also be one of those numerous women.

73
00:10:58,614 --> 00:11:03,154
Are you aware of the punishment given to a man

74
00:11:04,024 --> 00:11:07,044
- who bears interest in a palace lady? 
 - If that is so,

75
00:11:08,184 --> 00:11:12,764
where is your personal interest, Your Majesty?

76
00:11:25,884 --> 00:11:30,834
That is why... I said, "not yet."

77
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:15,474
♫  On this night, when even the moon is asleep  ♫

78
00:12:15,474 --> 00:12:21,644
♫  Where are you going in such a rush?  ♫

79
00:12:23,514 --> 00:12:30,844
♫  Leaving on a long trip tonight without a word  ♫

80
00:12:30,844 --> 00:12:37,304
♫  Where are you rushing to?  ♫

81
00:12:42,534 --> 00:12:45,354
Forgive us, Your Majesty!

82
00:12:45,354 --> 00:12:49,604
Instead of Chief Lee Sin Won, punish us who planned everything.

83
00:12:49,604 --> 00:12:53,884
How could I possibly just leave Sin Won alone?

84
00:12:53,884 --> 00:12:58,464
Though we are careful and sorry to say this, if Chief Lee Sin Won is dismissed from office,

85
00:12:58,464 --> 00:13:01,904
So Rang will no longer be in safe hands.

86
00:13:01,904 --> 00:13:05,640
The truth is that, when So Rang went to visit her home,

87
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,780
something terrible almost happened to her.

88
00:13:07,784 --> 00:13:11,384
The assassins chased her.

89
00:13:11,384 --> 00:13:14,184
Was someone after So Rang's life?

90
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:18,944
Is it known to the outside that she is a court lady under my protection?

91
00:13:18,944 --> 00:13:21,374
Though we cannot know for sure,

92
00:13:21,374 --> 00:13:27,474
if it were not for Chief Lee Sin Won, So Rang would be dead by now.

93
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,414
I will have someone else protect her.

94
00:13:29,414 --> 00:13:33,004
But will that person put his life on the line as much as Chief Sin Won did?

95
00:13:33,004 --> 00:13:37,814
The memorial* day of the crown princess is near...
 (death anniversary rites)

96
00:13:37,814 --> 00:13:43,584
If something were to happen to So Rang, your humble servants will also...

97
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:52,924
Lee Sin Won...

98
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:58,954
Goodness, Lee Sin Won...

99
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,154
I also agree to what they say.

100
00:14:03,154 --> 00:14:08,854
There cannot be any gaps in protecting her at the moment.

101
00:14:08,854 --> 00:14:14,354
As you are aware, a few days from now, another similar murder will take place in this palace.

102
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:18,664
Such a thing must never happen again.

103
00:14:18,664 --> 00:14:23,074
That is why I am looking into everything again now.

104
00:14:27,884 --> 00:14:31,344
These are the investigation records of the crown princess's death.

105
00:14:31,344 --> 00:14:34,234
We've already reviewed these records thousands of times, have we not?

106
00:14:34,234 --> 00:14:37,474
I am looking through them once again just in case I find something new

107
00:14:37,474 --> 00:14:41,444
but, as usual, all the records continue to point to suicide.

108
00:14:41,444 --> 00:14:44,254
How can that incident...

109
00:14:44,254 --> 00:14:49,904
How could her death... be a suicide?

110
00:14:56,834 --> 00:14:58,764
Why did you do that?

111
00:14:59,914 --> 00:15:02,164
You said the palace is a dangerous place.

112
00:15:02,164 --> 00:15:05,454
You said they'll have your head if you happen to do something wrong!

113
00:15:06,794 --> 00:15:09,914
- Who are you worried about right now?
 - You! You!

114
00:15:09,914 --> 00:15:12,230
You almost died!

115
00:15:13,034 --> 00:15:16,954
You could be killed for high treason if you take away a court lady like that.

116
00:15:16,954 --> 00:15:20,204
I'm grateful that you worry about me like that.

117
00:15:21,784 --> 00:15:24,324
Cutting off a coat sash of the king's robe...

118
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:25,914
Don't you know what that means?

119
00:15:25,914 --> 00:15:29,024
Then what should I have done?

120
00:15:29,024 --> 00:15:34,344
Are you asking because you really do not know why I went to such an extreme?

121
00:15:37,064 --> 00:15:38,854
Then,

122
00:15:39,514 --> 00:15:42,064
were you really going to stab the king?

123
00:15:46,454 --> 00:15:48,654
What about your feelings?

124
00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:58,574
 Though I risked that much for you, do you really feel nothing for me?

125
00:16:00,814 --> 00:16:02,994
We are friends.

126
00:16:03,634 --> 00:16:06,124
What you did was indeed wrong.

127
00:16:06,984 --> 00:16:08,624
Friends...

128
00:16:10,984 --> 00:16:13,374
Then let me ask you one thing.

129
00:16:14,344 --> 00:16:19,104
Have you ever seen me a man? Even once?

130
00:16:28,384 --> 00:16:31,594
No, never.

131
00:16:31,594 --> 00:16:35,604
Therefore, going forward, let us continue to be friends.

132
00:16:35,604 --> 00:16:37,304
Do not...

133
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:39,894
cross that line.

134
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:34,144
I apologize for having an important guest come all the way to such humble dwellings.

135
00:17:35,634 --> 00:17:39,964
You say you would like to see how the preparations are going in person?

136
00:17:47,754 --> 00:17:49,234
Forward, like so...

137
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,834
Five...

138
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:52,984
One...

139
00:17:52,984 --> 00:17:54,794
Two...

140
00:17:54,794 --> 00:17:56,804
Three...

141
00:18:04,574 --> 00:18:08,214
All possess outstanding beauty with upright character.

142
00:18:08,214 --> 00:18:10,534
They are all daughters from good families.

143
00:18:10,534 --> 00:18:15,364
It seems that all those suitable to be queen for this nation have been gathered at this place.

144
00:18:15,364 --> 00:18:17,954
Just trust me, Your Highness.

145
00:18:53,354 --> 00:18:55,274
What is your name?

146
00:18:55,274 --> 00:18:58,924
I am Ye Hyeon Seon.

147
00:18:59,824 --> 00:19:02,414
You are Hyeon Seon, I see.

148
00:19:02,414 --> 00:19:05,124
You sure are lovely.

149
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:06,864
Quite lovely.

150
00:19:10,754 --> 00:19:18,484
In any case, the inner court will select the list of future queen candidates.

151
00:19:18,484 --> 00:19:20,134
Yes.

152
00:19:30,724 --> 00:19:33,184
This is the perfect time to wash clothes since not many people are around!

153
00:19:33,184 --> 00:19:34,534
I know, right?

154
00:19:34,534 --> 00:19:37,074
- While we're here, why don't we also take a bath?
 - Aigoo!

155
00:19:37,074 --> 00:19:38,454
You say such silly things!

156
00:19:38,454 --> 00:19:40,444
What do you mean?

157
00:19:41,044 --> 00:19:42,064
What is that?

158
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:43,794
The queen?

159
00:19:43,794 --> 00:19:47,474
Gosh! We don't have a queen in this country right now!

160
00:19:48,274 --> 00:19:50,744
Who's that?

161
00:19:57,964 --> 00:20:02,514
So, I'm saying a man like me is just what you need.

162
00:20:02,514 --> 00:20:06,604
Do you know how dangerous it is to walk around late at night these days?

163
00:20:06,604 --> 00:20:09,754
If you're going to continue this funny business, just leave. All right?

164
00:20:09,754 --> 00:20:12,304
I mean, did you not hear the rumors?

165
00:20:12,304 --> 00:20:15,644
The women who went out last night to do laundry all fainted!

166
00:20:15,644 --> 00:20:17,054
As if they saw a ghost or something.

167
00:20:17,054 --> 00:20:20,134
Why? What happened?

168
00:20:20,134 --> 00:20:22,454
Whatever happened, why would our Hae Yeong worry?

169
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:23,844
This orabeoni* is here to protect you. 
 (archaic word for elder brother, like "oppa")

170
00:20:23,844 --> 00:20:26,054
For one, I work at the Royal Investigation Bureau—

171
00:20:26,054 --> 00:20:28,574
Aren't you just an underling?

172
00:20:28,574 --> 00:20:31,504
Orabeoni Do Seok!

173
00:20:34,644 --> 00:20:37,254
An underling who tags along someone else.

174
00:20:37,254 --> 00:20:41,374
Like a dog that keeps tagging along. Ta-ta-ta...

175
00:20:43,224 --> 00:20:44,874
Hold up.

176
00:20:46,304 --> 00:20:49,294
- There.
 - You brought some more romance novels?

177
00:20:49,294 --> 00:20:53,924
I told you. Whatever you want, I can get, Maiden Hae Yeong.

178
00:20:53,924 --> 00:20:58,274
 Stumbling Upon a Day  
My heart! Where do you get all these?

179
00:20:58,274 --> 00:21:01,884
Yes, if you say so, he can get you even the erotic—

180
00:21:02,864 --> 00:21:03,914
Shut that mouth of yours.

181
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:07,274
I'm doing everything I can to change my first impression.

182
00:21:07,274 --> 00:21:08,294
Smile!

183
00:21:08,294 --> 00:21:12,274
I mean, now is not the time to be engaging in some imaginary storyline!

184
00:21:12,274 --> 00:21:15,664
There are many men going around like tigers, ready to prey on and kidnap women!

185
00:21:15,664 --> 00:21:19,534
Pretty young ladies like our Hae Yeong should be extra careful!

186
00:21:19,534 --> 00:21:22,864
What is someone who works at the Bureau doing here instead of chasing those kidnappers?

187
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,324
Yes, what you doing?

188
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:27,464
What meaning is there in protecting tens or hundreds of women?

189
00:21:28,594 --> 00:21:30,104
The one I should protect is "my" woman.

190
00:21:30,104 --> 00:21:32,474
"M-My woman"? W-Who is "your" woman?

191
00:21:32,474 --> 00:21:35,424
Why, you obscene little fellow... Should I arrest you or not?

192
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:37,174
Birds of a feather flock together, huh?

193
00:21:37,174 --> 00:21:38,484
Flock together?

194
00:21:38,484 --> 00:21:40,474
That underling.

195
00:21:59,114 --> 00:22:01,224
Did you call for me, Your Majesty?

196
00:22:25,204 --> 00:22:27,544
Did I give you that wound?

197
00:22:28,984 --> 00:22:30,504
No.

198
00:22:30,504 --> 00:22:33,874
I ran into some assassins outside the palace.

199
00:22:33,874 --> 00:22:36,854
I heard they were after So Rang.

200
00:22:36,854 --> 00:22:38,654
Any guesses as to who they may be?

201
00:22:38,654 --> 00:22:41,444
Among them, there is one with a unique knife thrust,

202
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:43,944
so I told my men to look into him.

203
00:22:45,014 --> 00:22:46,774
Very well.

204
00:22:51,634 --> 00:22:54,374
I was actually going to punish you.

205
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,654
But I do not think I can do so.

206
00:22:59,654 --> 00:23:01,324
Sin Won.

207
00:23:02,254 --> 00:23:05,014
Please continue to protect So Rang.

208
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:11,124
I shall follow your orders.

209
00:23:11,124 --> 00:23:13,214
This is not an order.

210
00:23:14,154 --> 00:23:16,044
It is a request.

211
00:23:17,644 --> 00:23:19,664
And while doing so,

212
00:23:21,384 --> 00:23:23,904
refrain from harboring any love for her.

213
00:23:25,234 --> 00:23:27,404
Protect her,

214
00:23:28,254 --> 00:23:30,694
but do not get close to her.

215
00:23:31,424 --> 00:23:34,774
- Is this also an order?
 - If not an order,

216
00:23:36,344 --> 00:23:38,484
will you ignore such a request?

217
00:23:43,344 --> 00:23:46,474
I would like to ask you one thing, Your Majesty.

218
00:23:47,624 --> 00:23:49,654
Have you, Your Majesty,

219
00:23:50,974 --> 00:23:54,154
completely forgotten the crown princess?

220
00:24:26,274 --> 00:24:29,114
Health and peace be with you, Your Majesty.

221
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:31,754
Crown Princess.

222
00:24:33,964 --> 00:24:35,674
Why have you not

223
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:38,684
searched for me for a while now?

224
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:41,424
I have not?

225
00:24:42,444 --> 00:24:44,874
Your Majesty's heart...

226
00:24:44,874 --> 00:24:47,784
hasn't been yearning for me lately.

227
00:24:49,194 --> 00:24:51,064
That cannot be true.

228
00:24:51,994 --> 00:24:56,474
W-Why... W-What is happening, Crown Princess?

229
00:24:56,474 --> 00:25:00,264
I will continue to fade away.

230
00:25:00,264 --> 00:25:05,320
Because Your Maejesty has slowly been forgetting me.

231
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,774
Please do not go, Crown Princess.

232
00:25:15,774 --> 00:25:19,280
There is something I must ask of you tonight.

233
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:28,450
Who in the world did this to you?

234
00:25:29,024 --> 00:25:33,490
I wanted to catch the culprit who did that to you and relieve your resentment.

235
00:25:36,024 --> 00:25:38,444
If I fail to do so,

236
00:25:38,444 --> 00:25:41,634
more people in the palace will continue to get hurt.

237
00:25:41,634 --> 00:25:44,054
Please tell me.

238
00:25:45,094 --> 00:25:47,150
For me...

239
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:50,244
My death...

240
00:25:50,244 --> 00:25:52,734
D-Don't go, Crown Princess.

241
00:25:52,734 --> 00:25:54,614
Crown Princess.

242
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:14,264
Why are you here?

243
00:26:14,264 --> 00:26:15,954
I came in because it was my shift,

244
00:26:15,954 --> 00:26:19,024
but you appeared distressed in your sleep.

245
00:26:20,374 --> 00:26:24,194
Did you dream about the crown princess again?

246
00:26:24,194 --> 00:26:27,444
She didn't seem to appear much lately.

247
00:26:28,574 --> 00:26:31,944
Her shape in my dream is slowly fading away.

248
00:26:31,944 --> 00:26:35,164
Her soul must surely be disappearing.

249
00:26:36,134 --> 00:26:37,944
So Rang,

250
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:43,164
would you be able to channel her spirit right now for me?

251
00:26:44,064 --> 00:26:45,524
Pardon?

252
00:26:48,864 --> 00:26:52,464
Now you want me to channel her spirit again?

253
00:26:52,464 --> 00:26:55,294
Was it all a joke when you pulled me into your embrace?

254
00:26:55,294 --> 00:26:58,250
And was I imagining that you had kissed me?

255
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,550
This spirit channeling is all an act.

256
00:27:01,604 --> 00:27:04,104
You have been fooled by me up to now, Your Majesty!

257
00:27:04,104 --> 00:27:05,734
- No apparitions exist in this world.
 - Fooled?

258
00:27:05,734 --> 00:27:09,484
It is all simply an illusion inside Your Majesty's head!

259
00:27:09,484 --> 00:27:12,684
Have you not come to your senses yet?

260
00:27:17,134 --> 00:27:19,994
There is something I must ask you.

261
00:27:19,994 --> 00:27:22,184
I must know the answer

262
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:26,084
in order to be liberated from this pain.

263
00:27:46,604 --> 00:27:50,194
Have you been healthy and peaceful, Your Majesty?

264
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:01,374
You must stop searching for me

265
00:28:01,374 --> 00:28:03,914
so that I may leave this place.

266
00:28:03,914 --> 00:28:06,844
You must not keep calling upon my spirit.

267
00:28:06,844 --> 00:28:08,284
Just a moment ago...

268
00:28:08,284 --> 00:28:11,804
Just tell me what you were about to tell me a moment ago.

269
00:28:11,804 --> 00:28:15,154
You were clearly trying to tell me something.

270
00:28:15,154 --> 00:28:17,594
Please tell me.

271
00:28:17,594 --> 00:28:19,930
About your death, Crown Princess.

272
00:28:24,774 --> 00:28:26,474
I cannot answer that, Your Majesty.

273
00:28:26,474 --> 00:28:32,004
It is not proper for the dead to bring harm upon the living.

274
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:37,050
But your death could not possibly be suicide.

275
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:41,654
Your Majesty, it has already been seven years since my death.

276
00:28:41,654 --> 00:28:43,864
The important thing to me now is

277
00:28:43,864 --> 00:28:48,984
that Your Majesty break free from all this and move forward.

278
00:28:49,704 --> 00:28:51,764
How can I do so?

279
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:56,544
The only sin you've committed is loving your husband.

280
00:28:56,544 --> 00:28:58,304
It was...

281
00:28:59,914 --> 00:29:02,074
not love.

282
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,644
What?

283
00:29:04,644 --> 00:29:06,534
Huh?

284
00:29:06,534 --> 00:29:08,114
What did you say?

285
00:29:09,024 --> 00:29:12,644
What do you mean, no, Crown Princess? You loved me too...

286
00:29:12,644 --> 00:29:14,134
The sin of loving me too much.

287
00:29:14,134 --> 00:29:19,204
The sin of longing for me dearly...

288
00:29:20,964 --> 00:29:22,874
What I mean is...

289
00:29:22,874 --> 00:29:27,544
rather than love... well...

290
00:29:27,544 --> 00:29:29,684
It was more of worrying about you.

291
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,874
That is why I told you, Your Majesty!

292
00:29:31,874 --> 00:29:33,854
You must quickly...

293
00:29:33,854 --> 00:29:36,054
come...

294
00:29:36,054 --> 00:29:38,354
to your senses.

295
00:29:38,354 --> 00:29:40,144
Crown Princess.

296
00:29:40,144 --> 00:29:42,884
So whether it was love or not,

297
00:29:42,884 --> 00:29:45,984
it is already all in the past.

298
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,384
I cannot let that be.

299
00:29:47,384 --> 00:29:49,414
How can our love be in the past now?

300
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,084
I said, it was not love.

301
00:29:51,084 --> 00:29:53,704
How should I put it...

302
00:29:53,704 --> 00:29:55,224
perhaps loyalty?

303
00:29:55,224 --> 00:29:56,924
Loyalty?

304
00:29:56,924 --> 00:29:58,954
Yes, loyalty.

305
00:29:58,954 --> 00:30:00,874
And if it isn't in the past,

306
00:30:00,874 --> 00:30:04,964
how much longer will you yearn for the dead?

307
00:30:04,964 --> 00:30:07,384
What I desire...

308
00:30:07,384 --> 00:30:09,424
- is that you please...
 - Please...

309
00:30:09,424 --> 00:30:12,740
- Forget...
 - forget me going forward!

310
00:30:22,684 --> 00:30:24,864
He'll be all right, won't he?

311
00:30:27,364 --> 00:30:29,304
Well, whatever!

312
00:30:35,164 --> 00:30:38,944
An insolent bunch has been secretly collecting rocks from Bugaksan

313
00:30:38,944 --> 00:30:41,034
and selling them in the market.

314
00:30:41,034 --> 00:30:42,974
We must call on the appropriate government official

315
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:46,034
and investigate this matter, Your Majesty.

316
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:53,584
Your Majesty!

317
00:31:01,134 --> 00:31:05,984
The governor of Chungcheong Province has sent over a detailed report on drought.

318
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:49,764
Has he lost his soul or something?

319
00:31:49,764 --> 00:31:53,274
Oh my, did I go too far?

320
00:31:55,264 --> 00:31:58,774
I should wipe off sweat from his face.

321
00:32:00,314 --> 00:32:02,154
Your Majesty.

322
00:32:09,664 --> 00:32:11,484
Is it true?

323
00:32:11,484 --> 00:32:12,784
Pardon?

324
00:32:12,784 --> 00:32:14,484
It wasn't love?

325
00:32:14,484 --> 00:32:16,854
Did the crown princess really say she didn't love me?

326
00:32:16,854 --> 00:32:18,414
Well I mean...

327
00:32:18,414 --> 00:32:20,394
How can one truly know another's heart?

328
00:32:20,394 --> 00:32:22,824
Even the feelings of living beings change a dozen times a day.

329
00:32:22,824 --> 00:32:24,474
No. This cannot be.

330
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:25,984
The crown princess, she definitely...

331
00:32:25,984 --> 00:32:28,234
She definitely...

332
00:32:28,234 --> 00:32:30,574
Definitely ...

333
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:32,414
Definitely ...

334
00:32:34,114 --> 00:32:38,394
Are there perhaps any words she spoke to you while she was alive?

335
00:32:38,394 --> 00:32:40,854
For example, any expressions of affection?

336
00:32:43,624 --> 00:32:47,734
 How can I relax my heart of dedication to you, Your Majesty?

337
00:32:47,734 --> 00:32:49,444
 Your Majesty.

338
00:32:49,444 --> 00:32:53,624
 You must separate love from affairs of state.

339
00:32:57,314 --> 00:32:59,684
What about her gaze?

340
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:24,014
I'm not so sure.

341
00:33:25,174 --> 00:33:26,994
What could possibly be

342
00:33:26,994 --> 00:33:29,654
the crown princess's true feelings?

343
00:33:30,784 --> 00:33:34,084
So we should now forget her highness the crown princess and—

344
00:33:34,084 --> 00:33:35,744
This will not do.

345
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:38,444
I shall ask directly myself.

346
00:33:38,444 --> 00:33:40,650
Ask whom?

347
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:42,124
Head Eunuch!

348
00:33:42,124 --> 00:33:43,394
Yes, Your Majesty.

349
00:33:43,394 --> 00:33:46,984
Go and call Ahn Ji Hyeong who was the chancellor of Seonggyungwan.

350
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:48,874
Yes, Your Majesty.

351
00:33:48,874 --> 00:33:50,154
W-Who is that?

352
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:53,310
My former father-in-law.

353
00:33:55,894 --> 00:33:58,404
 Why are things getting out of control?

354
00:34:01,204 --> 00:34:03,374
Y-Your Majesty.

355
00:34:04,094 --> 00:34:05,864
Your Majesty.

356
00:34:07,164 --> 00:34:08,844
I missed you.

357
00:34:08,844 --> 00:34:13,324
Have you been well, Father-in-law?

358
00:34:14,964 --> 00:34:17,304
I-I am sorry...

359
00:34:17,304 --> 00:34:19,494
Now that I am growing older,

360
00:34:19,494 --> 00:34:21,584
I just seem to break out in tears without any notice.

361
00:34:21,584 --> 00:34:23,314
without any notice.

362
00:34:23,314 --> 00:34:24,914
No need to excuse yourself.

363
00:34:24,914 --> 00:34:27,384
It's all right.

364
00:34:28,664 --> 00:34:31,924
Whenever I think about my Ja Yeon... I mean,

365
00:34:31,924 --> 00:34:34,414
whenever I think about Her Highness,

366
00:34:34,414 --> 00:34:38,144
it feels like my skin is being torn off, and so...

367
00:34:41,484 --> 00:34:46,954
I asked to meet with you because I had a question to ask you.

368
00:34:49,484 --> 00:34:51,094
Please ask your question, Sire.

369
00:34:51,094 --> 00:34:53,814
When the crown princess was alive,

370
00:34:53,814 --> 00:34:56,304
did she love me?

371
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:58,724
Of course.

372
00:34:58,724 --> 00:35:01,324
She held such deep allegiance for you, Your Majesty.

373
00:35:01,324 --> 00:35:04,954
She said she was so happy that she was able to serve the Sun so close to him.

374
00:35:04,954 --> 00:35:08,194
And that she will faithfully perform her duties as his servant.

375
00:35:08,194 --> 00:35:11,964
Every time she met with me, she resolved to do so.

376
00:35:14,144 --> 00:35:17,134
So, I can understand her allegiance.

377
00:35:17,744 --> 00:35:20,054
But how was her feelings of affection for me?

378
00:35:20,054 --> 00:35:21,924
By feelings of affection...

379
00:35:21,924 --> 00:35:23,484
you would be talking about

380
00:35:23,484 --> 00:35:25,054
the feelings of love

381
00:35:25,054 --> 00:35:28,454
between a man and a woman...

382
00:35:28,454 --> 00:35:29,644
Yes.

383
00:35:29,644 --> 00:35:31,504
That is right. That is what I am talking about.

384
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:34,684
As her husband, she would have, of course...

385
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:36,694
Of course?

386
00:35:36,694 --> 00:35:38,644
- Of course...
 - Of course?

387
00:35:38,644 --> 00:35:41,484
deeply, deeply...

388
00:35:41,484 --> 00:35:44,064
loved you, probably...

389
00:35:44,064 --> 00:35:46,564
Probably?

390
00:35:48,584 --> 00:35:52,424
Of course, her father would say that his daughter had deep feelings of love and allegiance for you.

391
00:35:52,424 --> 00:35:53,694
What else would he say?

392
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:57,834
Besides, he probably would not have seen his daughter often once she entered the palace.

393
00:35:57,834 --> 00:35:59,314
From what I can tell,

394
00:35:59,314 --> 00:36:04,314
it would be difficult to figure this out using official means.

395
00:36:04,314 --> 00:36:07,454
Do you not think that with things regarding love,

396
00:36:07,454 --> 00:36:09,174
the servant of that house

397
00:36:09,174 --> 00:36:12,144
would know better than her father?

398
00:36:12,144 --> 00:36:13,214
Servant?

399
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:15,694
Do you want to go out in disguise with me?

400
00:36:15,694 --> 00:36:18,104
- Go out in disguise?
 - You said you were curious.

401
00:36:18,104 --> 00:36:22,824
About whether her highness truly loved you or not.

402
00:36:24,734 --> 00:36:27,624
But how do we find out where that servant is?

403
00:36:27,624 --> 00:36:30,614
The crown princess's family home is in Gangneung.

404
00:36:30,614 --> 00:36:33,414
I mean, I can take care of all that.

405
00:36:33,414 --> 00:36:35,564
How many years have I been wandering around all over the country?

406
00:36:35,564 --> 00:36:38,674
Finding someone is a piece of cake.

407
00:36:44,114 --> 00:36:46,754
But do we need to go out dressed like this?

408
00:36:46,754 --> 00:36:49,694
Because your face just exudes nobility and wealth, Your Majesty,

409
00:36:49,694 --> 00:36:51,534
we will be caught if we do not dress like this.

410
00:36:51,534 --> 00:36:54,194
But still, this is a bit...

411
00:36:56,814 --> 00:37:00,744
But do I really need to dress like this, too?

412
00:37:00,744 --> 00:37:02,714
Looks good on you.

413
00:37:06,354 --> 00:37:09,854
Then, why are you dressed so nicely?

414
00:37:12,954 --> 00:37:16,004
I need to act like a lady of high nobility

415
00:37:16,004 --> 00:37:19,754
so that the servants will answer my questions well.

416
00:37:32,324 --> 00:37:34,954
I think it will be all right for you to come up here.

417
00:37:42,034 --> 00:37:44,274
Yes, you may go up first.

418
00:37:44,274 --> 00:37:45,664
Yes.

419
00:37:47,414 --> 00:37:49,184
Sin Won!

420
00:37:57,574 --> 00:38:00,754
Y-Y-Your Majesty! Please support me!

421
00:38:00,754 --> 00:38:01,844
O-Oh... Yes.

422
00:38:01,844 --> 00:38:04,094
Y-You are going to go across by stepping on the king?

423
00:38:04,094 --> 00:38:07,154
At this rate, we'll spend the night like this! Hurry!

424
00:38:08,234 --> 00:38:10,384
No, really!

425
00:38:10,384 --> 00:38:11,254
Aigoo!

426
00:38:11,254 --> 00:38:13,204
St-Stay still.

427
00:38:13,204 --> 00:38:15,074
A-All right!

428
00:38:16,814 --> 00:38:18,624
Oh, it worked.

429
00:38:20,844 --> 00:38:22,284
I just got kicked.

430
00:38:22,284 --> 00:38:24,974
Hey, hey, hey! Have you heard of death by dismemberment?

431
00:38:24,974 --> 00:38:26,604
In the old times, if anyone harmed the king's body...

432
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,954
even if it were the queen, they would depose her.

433
00:38:28,954 --> 00:38:31,654
Sure, rip me apart or get rid of me.

434
00:38:31,654 --> 00:38:35,064
If you don't come, we are just going by ourselves. Let's go.

435
00:38:35,064 --> 00:38:37,804
Why did I follow her...

436
00:39:03,494 --> 00:39:05,304
Incredible.

437
00:39:15,564 --> 00:39:17,634
A long time ago,

438
00:39:17,634 --> 00:39:20,464
when the crown princess was selected,

439
00:39:20,464 --> 00:39:21,984
how did she look?

440
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:26,404
Aigoo. There was a big commotion!

441
00:39:26,404 --> 00:39:28,924
Because it was a reason for celebration for the household?

442
00:39:29,704 --> 00:39:32,344
No, because she did not want to go to the palace.

443
00:39:32,344 --> 00:39:35,094
At an age where she would love to run around playing,

444
00:39:35,094 --> 00:39:37,654
she would end up caged inside the uptight palace,

445
00:39:37,654 --> 00:39:40,374
so why would she be happy?

446
00:39:40,374 --> 00:39:43,214
She was bawling and throwing a fit

447
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,494
saying that she will not be able to see her parents anymore.

448
00:39:45,494 --> 00:39:49,584
We barely managed to console her and sent her on her way.

449
00:39:49,584 --> 00:39:54,064
Then, by chance, have you ever met the her highness the crown princess after she entered the palace?

450
00:39:54,064 --> 00:39:57,074
No. Her family home is in Gangneung.

451
00:39:57,074 --> 00:39:59,294
Do you think she would have been able to come here easily?

452
00:39:59,294 --> 00:40:02,374
She sent a letter full of anger to us

453
00:40:02,374 --> 00:40:07,524
complaining that the crown prince would not allow her to visit her home.

454
00:40:07,524 --> 00:40:10,474
- All the badmouthing she did behind his back...
 - Aigoo.

455
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:17,004
On the letter, she wrote down each of our names.

456
00:40:17,004 --> 00:40:21,704
To think she would end up meeting such an end...

457
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,580
Oh dear. You must have gone through a lot.

458
00:40:24,584 --> 00:40:27,594
You must have gone through a lot.

459
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:31,304
Thank you for coming all the way here and telling me these things.

460
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:32,704
Yes.

461
00:40:33,924 --> 00:40:35,864
Then, have a safe journey back.

462
00:40:35,864 --> 00:40:37,774
Yes.

463
00:40:40,224 --> 00:40:41,484
Move.

464
00:40:41,484 --> 00:40:43,434
Y-Your Majesty.

465
00:40:47,384 --> 00:40:49,194
I do not know about how she was before she entered the palace,

466
00:40:49,194 --> 00:40:51,914
but she probably loved me after she entered the palace.

467
00:40:51,914 --> 00:40:55,574
That is why I had one more person come.

468
00:40:55,574 --> 00:40:57,534
There she comes. Over there.

469
00:40:59,504 --> 00:41:01,114
 Crown Princess, are you all right?

470
00:41:01,114 --> 00:41:03,994
 Crown Prince, this is our work.

471
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:06,584
 We shall take care of her.

472
00:41:06,584 --> 00:41:09,744
Go back and hide! What are you doing? Stay hidden.

473
00:41:11,444 --> 00:41:15,154
Aigoo, you must have gone through a lot to come all this way.

474
00:41:15,154 --> 00:41:17,854
Yes, please sit down here.

475
00:41:22,584 --> 00:41:25,104
Thank you for coming out here like this.

476
00:41:25,104 --> 00:41:30,514
I just had a few questions to ask you.

477
00:41:30,514 --> 00:41:33,804
How long did you say you had worked in the palace?

478
00:41:33,804 --> 00:41:35,984
I was there for a lifetime.

479
00:41:35,984 --> 00:41:38,534
Has it already been seven years since her highness

480
00:41:38,534 --> 00:41:41,544
ended up like that and left the palace?

481
00:41:41,544 --> 00:41:48,184
In your eyes, how was the relationship between the crown prince and the crown princess at that time?

482
00:41:48,184 --> 00:41:53,284
At that time, his highness the crown prince cared for the crown princess so much...

483
00:41:54,714 --> 00:41:56,234
that it was a problem.

484
00:41:56,234 --> 00:41:59,424
Since he cared for her and protected her so much...

485
00:41:59,424 --> 00:42:01,804
I mean, he had to look at the sky to pick the stars*,
 (idiom: "you have to put in the effort to sleep together")

486
00:42:01,804 --> 00:42:05,230
but his highness won't lift his head.

487
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:08,474
His highness's head was always drooping, I see.

488
00:42:08,474 --> 00:42:10,294
That is right!

489
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:13,324
The elders kept saying they should produce an heir,

490
00:42:13,324 --> 00:42:16,464
but even your palms have to meet in order to make a sound.

491
00:42:16,464 --> 00:42:17,764
That...

492
00:42:17,764 --> 00:42:19,734
There was none of this sound, I see.

493
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:24,784
Goodness, that would be a good reason for the king to be deserted by her.

494
00:42:24,784 --> 00:42:28,764
That was probably the start of the rumors that he was castrated.

495
00:42:28,764 --> 00:42:32,484
No, wait, where did the rumors that he was gay start?

496
00:42:32,484 --> 00:42:35,854
You know, there was that warrior that he kept close to him.

497
00:42:35,854 --> 00:42:37,964
He had the crown princess go to sleep early

498
00:42:37,964 --> 00:42:41,584
and supposedly he would sweat so much with that man every night.

499
00:42:41,584 --> 00:42:43,294
- Sweat?
 - Sweat?

500
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:46,454
- We were practicing with the sword...
 - Enough for his robe to be soaking wet.

501
00:42:46,454 --> 00:42:49,714
Oh, well, you know...

502
00:42:49,714 --> 00:42:55,004
how do you think the crown princess thought of the crown prince at that time?

503
00:42:55,004 --> 00:42:58,354
I know exactly what she thought.

504
00:42:58,354 --> 00:43:01,824
Deeper than love...

505
00:43:01,824 --> 00:43:03,444
Allegiance!

506
00:43:03,444 --> 00:43:05,904
- Allegiance.
 - Allegiance, again!

507
00:43:05,904 --> 00:43:09,734
Oh, then, the time she spent being married to the crown prince...

508
00:43:09,734 --> 00:43:11,664
was all...

509
00:43:11,664 --> 00:43:15,874
Bizun yisu.
 (Sounds like "business". It doesn't follow that she wanted to follow a high-ranking person)

510
00:43:15,874 --> 00:43:17,184
Bizun yisu?

511
00:43:17,184 --> 00:43:19,324
The sense of duty owed to a superior...

512
00:43:19,324 --> 00:43:20,784
It was Bizun yisu.

513
00:43:20,784 --> 00:43:23,084
The obligation she felt of serving his majesty well.

514
00:43:23,084 --> 00:43:24,884
So, you are saying that

515
00:43:24,884 --> 00:43:27,844
she did not see him as a beloved husband.

516
00:43:27,844 --> 00:43:30,194
She loved him as her king

517
00:43:30,194 --> 00:43:32,584
but not so much as her husband.

518
00:43:32,584 --> 00:43:35,984
So she did not really have personal feelings for him...

519
00:43:36,844 --> 00:43:39,484
About her death from back then...

520
00:43:39,484 --> 00:43:44,014
The inner court concluded that it was suicide.

521
00:43:44,014 --> 00:43:46,554
What do you know about that?

522
00:43:46,554 --> 00:43:48,874
It just so happened that it was not my shift that day,

523
00:43:48,874 --> 00:43:50,904
so I did not get to witness any of it.

524
00:43:50,904 --> 00:43:54,434
Aigoo. I am so sad for the one who passed away,

525
00:43:54,434 --> 00:43:57,944
but still, the time has passed like this.

526
00:43:57,944 --> 00:44:02,324
Even if it were my son, I would have told him to remarry.

527
00:44:02,324 --> 00:44:04,384
Actually, wait.

528
00:44:04,384 --> 00:44:07,624
Is that rumor true?

529
00:44:07,624 --> 00:44:09,394
What do they say he is exactly?

530
00:44:09,394 --> 00:44:10,964
Between being castrated and gay?

531
00:44:10,964 --> 00:44:12,734
Again! Move...

532
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:14,924
Castrated or gay!

533
00:44:14,924 --> 00:44:18,874
Come on! I mean, I heard he will be ending the Marriage Ban Edict soon.

534
00:44:18,874 --> 00:44:21,684
He will do that for sure.

535
00:44:21,684 --> 00:44:24,024
Oh, yes.

536
00:44:24,024 --> 00:44:27,544
Oh, thank you for coming so far to meet with me.

537
00:44:27,544 --> 00:44:29,814
Yes, please get home safely.

538
00:44:29,814 --> 00:44:31,424
Aigoo.

539
00:44:49,534 --> 00:44:51,314
Yes.

540
00:44:52,244 --> 00:44:53,684
You know, right?

541
00:44:53,684 --> 00:44:54,884
You have to keep your mouths shut about this.

542
00:44:54,884 --> 00:44:56,534
Yes, of course.

543
00:44:56,534 --> 00:44:58,194
Thank you.

544
00:44:58,194 --> 00:45:00,334
Please get home safely.

545
00:45:08,504 --> 00:45:10,284
Whoa! You scared me!

546
00:45:10,284 --> 00:45:12,174
What are you doing right now?

547
00:45:12,174 --> 00:45:14,114
Me?

548
00:45:14,114 --> 00:45:17,104
You! Were you not over there?

549
00:45:20,864 --> 00:45:22,774
This is unbelievable.

550
00:45:22,774 --> 00:45:23,914
Was all of this a deception?

551
00:45:23,914 --> 00:45:24,914
What? No!

552
00:45:24,914 --> 00:45:27,424
Then why would you pay them?

553
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:30,414
Then was all of this—

554
00:45:30,414 --> 00:45:31,704
Was all of this a lie?

555
00:45:31,704 --> 00:45:33,104
An allegiance deeper than love?

556
00:45:33,104 --> 00:45:36,394
Then, what? Are you going to leave his majesty in that state?

557
00:45:36,394 --> 00:45:37,934
Still, isn't this crossing the line?

558
00:45:37,934 --> 00:45:39,764
The line?

559
00:45:39,764 --> 00:45:42,164
You were the one to cross the line!

560
00:45:45,144 --> 00:45:49,204
Was it all right for you to do something like that then or not?

561
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:52,964
I mean, why are you suddenly bringing that up here?

562
00:45:52,964 --> 00:45:55,014
Still, I will tell his majesty everything.

563
00:45:55,014 --> 00:45:57,254
The fact that you paid people for this.

564
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,414
Oh, come on! Hey...

565
00:45:59,414 --> 00:46:00,524
We are friends.

566
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:02,264
We promised back then.

567
00:46:02,264 --> 00:46:04,744
To protect each other as friends.

568
00:46:04,744 --> 00:46:06,614
Let go of me.

569
00:46:07,544 --> 00:46:12,784
Hey. What if I die for committing high treason? Would you be happy?

570
00:46:12,784 --> 00:46:14,654
They say that for the capital punishment,

571
00:46:14,654 --> 00:46:16,704
they are put to death by ripping them to pieces like a dried squid.

572
00:46:16,704 --> 00:46:19,564
Then could you eat dried squid ever again?

573
00:46:19,564 --> 00:46:23,030
Do you know how delicious that is? Could you bear to  never eat that again?

574
00:46:23,694 --> 00:46:25,264
Fine. Think about it slowly at your own pace.

575
00:46:25,264 --> 00:46:28,954
Think about it slowly at your own pace.

576
00:46:28,954 --> 00:46:30,644
Orabeoni...

577
00:46:30,644 --> 00:46:33,404
Let's not be like this, please?

578
00:46:33,404 --> 00:46:35,064
Orabeoni?

579
00:46:38,484 --> 00:46:41,074
You only call me orabeoni only in times like this.

580
00:46:41,074 --> 00:46:43,204
Fine.

581
00:46:43,204 --> 00:46:44,984
I will not say any more of this,

582
00:46:44,984 --> 00:46:47,024
so promise me just one thing.

583
00:46:47,024 --> 00:46:50,174
Sure. I promise. What is it?

584
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:53,004
Do not give your heart to his majesty.

585
00:46:53,004 --> 00:46:57,654
Promise me that you will not have any feelings of love for his majesty.

586
00:47:06,474 --> 00:47:12,024
Wouldn't it be better to draw it as if her robe sash looks about to be undone?

587
00:47:12,024 --> 00:47:14,054
- Just like—
 - Move.

588
00:47:18,994 --> 00:47:22,094
What is the matter? What is wrong?

589
00:47:22,094 --> 00:47:23,454
Oh, what do I do!

590
00:47:23,454 --> 00:47:24,924
Why? Why?

591
00:47:24,924 --> 00:47:26,054
Did someone get kidnapped again?

592
00:47:26,054 --> 00:47:28,614
No. It is even worse this time!

593
00:47:28,614 --> 00:47:30,054
Within the city,

594
00:47:30,054 --> 00:47:35,364
the crown princess supposedly returned from the dead!

595
00:47:35,364 --> 00:47:36,600
Come on, you are lying!

596
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,100
Ridiculous!

597
00:47:38,104 --> 00:47:40,664
How does a dead person come back to life?

598
00:47:40,664 --> 00:47:43,604
T-That is probably a ghost!

599
00:47:43,604 --> 00:47:45,134
It is probably a ghost.

600
00:47:45,134 --> 00:47:46,394
But even that is a bit scary.

601
00:47:46,394 --> 00:47:50,414
What if ... what if the crown princess was alive all this time?

602
00:47:50,414 --> 00:47:52,784
Come on.

603
00:47:52,784 --> 00:47:56,444
Then what would be the meaning of the  Marriage Ban Edict for the past seven years?

604
00:47:56,444 --> 00:47:57,584
You never know.

605
00:47:57,584 --> 00:47:59,774
Maybe we have been going through all of this for nothing.

606
00:47:59,774 --> 00:48:01,804
To say it was all for nothing, it was too long.

607
00:48:01,804 --> 00:48:04,064
Do you not think it is just a rumor on the streets?

608
00:48:04,064 --> 00:48:05,734
One that incites the crowds for no reason.

609
00:48:05,734 --> 00:48:09,564
More than a few saw the dead crown princess for this to be a mere rumor.

610
00:48:09,564 --> 00:48:12,214
Some saw her at the washing place, and some saw her at the temple

611
00:48:12,214 --> 00:48:16,604
wearing her ceremonial dress, with her eyes wide open!

612
00:48:16,604 --> 00:48:19,334
If it was the crown princess, do you think she would go around wearing the ceremonial dress?

613
00:48:19,334 --> 00:48:22,944
Or perhaps, do you not think she may be a vengeful spirit or a ghost?

614
00:48:22,944 --> 00:48:24,994
They say that the curse of the Marriage Ban Edict fell on Joseon

615
00:48:24,994 --> 00:48:28,714
because of the dead crown princess's resentment of her unfair death.

616
00:48:32,294 --> 00:48:33,564
Hae Yeong.

617
00:48:33,564 --> 00:48:36,644
You are spreading nonsense again.

618
00:48:36,644 --> 00:48:38,524
You are awake?

619
00:48:38,524 --> 00:48:40,644
I thought you said you were going to take a nap, old man.

620
00:48:40,644 --> 00:48:42,754
If the ghost of the crown princess is real,

621
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:44,894
then what are you trying to say about what So Rang is doing?

622
00:48:44,894 --> 00:48:47,024
Well, what Eonni is doing is f—

623
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:48,904
F—?

624
00:48:48,904 --> 00:48:51,284
F...

625
00:48:51,284 --> 00:48:53,964
Full of love!

626
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:55,594
Since she is always with the king,

627
00:48:55,594 --> 00:48:58,524
do you not think it will be full of love everywhere?

628
00:48:58,524 --> 00:49:00,154
Full of love...

629
00:49:00,154 --> 00:49:01,444
Yes, love.

630
00:49:01,444 --> 00:49:05,164
Excuse me, sir. Let us talk for a moment.

631
00:49:05,164 --> 00:49:06,734
With me?

632
00:49:07,594 --> 00:49:08,864
Yes.

633
00:49:08,864 --> 00:49:11,064
Sure, why not.

634
00:49:13,944 --> 00:49:18,034
Chun Seok, why are you here all the time?

635
00:49:26,544 --> 00:49:29,644
How did you know to send me that message last time?

636
00:49:29,644 --> 00:49:32,944
We almost got into big trouble as soon as we left the palace.

637
00:49:32,944 --> 00:49:37,064
I sent you that message because there was danger in her fortunes this month.

638
00:49:37,064 --> 00:49:40,824
You do not know who sent the assassins?

639
00:49:40,824 --> 00:49:45,214
Even if you investigate right now, you would lack evidence.

640
00:49:46,334 --> 00:49:47,854
The right time will come for sure.

641
00:49:47,854 --> 00:49:50,414
There will be another time when they target So Rang again,

642
00:49:50,414 --> 00:49:52,584
and that is when you should attack.

643
00:49:52,584 --> 00:49:54,984
What if she faces even bigger harm like that?

644
00:49:54,984 --> 00:49:56,744
Come on now.

645
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:59,394
You do not overcome harm by avoiding it.

646
00:49:59,394 --> 00:50:00,854
You become a mature person by enduring at times

647
00:50:00,854 --> 00:50:04,184
and facing it head on when needed.

648
00:50:04,184 --> 00:50:08,134
More people will start to seek So Rang's life,

649
00:50:08,134 --> 00:50:10,914
and they will become more persistent.

650
00:50:21,194 --> 00:50:22,854
Return home now.

651
00:50:27,754 --> 00:50:29,034
Hey, Chief.

652
00:50:29,034 --> 00:50:31,254
Please take this guy away, this Chun Seok here.

653
00:50:31,254 --> 00:50:34,794
He is sending love signals to a woman while we are under the Marriage Ban Edict.

654
00:50:34,794 --> 00:50:36,894
Me? No way, Chief.

655
00:50:36,894 --> 00:50:40,184
How far are you going? I will accompany you.

656
00:50:50,874 --> 00:50:54,504
What happened to the knife thrust that I told you to investigate?

657
00:50:54,504 --> 00:50:56,724
Are you not spending too much time here?

658
00:50:56,724 --> 00:51:00,204
I mean, it was because I thought that those guys might come back here.

659
00:51:00,204 --> 00:51:02,804
Did that not all happen while coming to Aedaldang?

660
00:51:02,804 --> 00:51:04,404
But Chief,

661
00:51:04,404 --> 00:51:06,244
have you heard about this rumor?

662
00:51:06,244 --> 00:51:07,254
What rumor?

663
00:51:07,254 --> 00:51:11,974
In this city, the dead crown princess supposedly came back to life!

664
00:51:11,974 --> 00:51:12,884
What?

665
00:51:12,884 --> 00:51:15,554
I heard it all from inside here.

666
00:51:21,414 --> 00:51:24,164
Hey! Bring me one more bottle of alcohol!

667
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:27,074
Please, Your Majesty, stop drinking!

668
00:51:27,074 --> 00:51:29,174
Please stop drinking.

669
00:51:29,174 --> 00:51:31,744
Aigoo...

670
00:51:31,744 --> 00:51:33,424
Hey, Head Eunuch,

671
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:36,094
I finished this bottle. Get me another drink!

672
00:51:36,094 --> 00:51:38,754
There should not be a break while drinking...

673
00:51:48,944 --> 00:51:52,284
Aigoo, Your Majesty. No more, eh?

674
00:51:52,284 --> 00:51:53,944
Come on, there is a bit left in there.

675
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,814
No, there is not.

676
00:51:55,814 --> 00:51:57,914
Oh, it is here.

677
00:52:00,804 --> 00:52:04,944
Your Majesty, please come to your senses now, will you?

678
00:52:04,944 --> 00:52:06,604
Ah!

679
00:52:08,344 --> 00:52:10,074
Crown Princess...

680
00:52:12,294 --> 00:52:14,364
The crown princess has come.

681
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:15,474
- He is starting this again...
 - The crown princess...

682
00:52:15,474 --> 00:52:18,204
I will go to see the crown princess!

683
00:52:18,204 --> 00:52:20,114
- Crown Princess...
 - Aigoo!

684
00:52:20,114 --> 00:52:22,954
Where will you go? To the afterlife?

685
00:52:22,954 --> 00:52:25,994
No, really! ... What shall I do?

686
00:52:25,994 --> 00:52:28,154
Shall I have him drink more and put him to sleep?

687
00:52:31,304 --> 00:52:33,634
Please get us some strong alcohol!

688
00:52:33,634 --> 00:52:36,904
Y-Yes, bring some strong drink, some strong alcohol.

689
00:52:37,544 --> 00:52:38,894
Here, take a cup.

690
00:52:38,894 --> 00:52:41,734
Yes, yes. I will send you off myself.

691
00:52:41,734 --> 00:52:43,634
To the afterlife.

692
00:52:59,344 --> 00:53:02,144
Oh, Your Majesty, Your Majesty! Are you all right?

693
00:53:05,064 --> 00:53:07,984
Yes. I have decided.

694
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:09,594
What? About what?

695
00:53:09,594 --> 00:53:11,534
I must stop drinking.

696
00:53:11,534 --> 00:53:12,984
Really?

697
00:53:12,984 --> 00:53:14,554
Oh, good!

698
00:53:14,554 --> 00:53:16,894
You will end up messing up your stomach like that.

699
00:53:16,894 --> 00:53:17,784
So Rang, listen to me.

700
00:53:17,784 --> 00:53:21,254
I have tried to forget the crown princess in the past few days, but it did not work very well, right?

701
00:53:21,254 --> 00:53:22,744
- So...
 - I mean,

702
00:53:22,744 --> 00:53:25,484
you need to endure such a process to forget someone!

703
00:53:25,484 --> 00:53:28,084
I mean, Your Majesty. Will you keep hurting your entire life just because you are hurting right now?

704
00:53:28,084 --> 00:53:30,194
You should hurt a lot now and get better later.

705
00:53:30,194 --> 00:53:32,784
So, please let go of her highness the crown princess now,

706
00:53:32,784 --> 00:53:34,864
and Your Majesty, please come to your senses—

707
00:53:34,864 --> 00:53:36,584
Aigoo. Oh, my. Over here. This way.

708
00:53:36,584 --> 00:53:39,174
Over here.

709
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,804
I am fine. I am fine.

710
00:53:44,414 --> 00:53:48,154
I miss you more than usual tonight, my daughter.

711
00:53:49,284 --> 00:53:51,274
Tonight,

712
00:53:52,214 --> 00:53:54,804
please appear in my dreams, at least.

713
00:54:06,334 --> 00:54:09,894
The wind is telling me to go inside and go to bed.

714
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,884
My Lord!

715
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:35,734
My daughter...

716
00:54:36,784 --> 00:54:39,214
Ja Yeon, you're here.

717
00:54:39,214 --> 00:54:42,704
Have you come because you missed your father?

718
00:54:43,504 --> 00:54:45,514
My daughter...

719
00:54:47,084 --> 00:54:49,104
How can you be so pretty

720
00:54:49,794 --> 00:54:52,824
even after such a long time?

721
00:55:01,354 --> 00:55:03,324
Daughter! Ja Yeon, Ja Yeon!

722
00:55:03,324 --> 00:55:05,144
Ja Yeon!

723
00:55:12,284 --> 00:55:13,654
No...

724
00:55:19,174 --> 00:55:21,114
Ja Yeon...

725
00:55:22,304 --> 00:55:24,054
My daughter...

726
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:26,224
No...

727
00:55:29,564 --> 00:55:31,634
Ja Yeon!

728
00:55:36,854 --> 00:55:39,614
Come on! There is no such a thing as a ghost!

729
00:55:39,614 --> 00:55:42,844
Well, even if there is, there is no ghost like that.

730
00:55:42,844 --> 00:55:45,624
Do you think a ghost is someone who is crazy for attention?

731
00:55:45,624 --> 00:55:47,394
Appearing here and there?

732
00:55:47,394 --> 00:55:50,234
Why would it appear in front of people and stir things up?

733
00:55:50,234 --> 00:55:51,354
Right?

734
00:55:51,354 --> 00:55:53,714
I wonder who is trying to shake up this nation by spreading these rumors...

735
00:55:53,714 --> 00:55:56,414
I do not sense any cold energy in the land of Hanyang,

736
00:55:56,414 --> 00:55:59,474
so what do they mean by a ghost wandering around here...

737
00:56:04,584 --> 00:56:08,674
These three locations are where the ghost has been spotted.

738
00:56:08,674 --> 00:56:12,184
But does it not seem that the ghost is making an appearance here to attract attention?

739
00:56:12,184 --> 00:56:14,164
Where women who like to talk gather.

740
00:56:14,164 --> 00:56:16,784
- Wow!
 - Whoa...

741
00:56:16,784 --> 00:56:19,854
You really seem like a Royal Investigation Bureau Chief for once.

742
00:56:20,734 --> 00:56:22,924
It seems there is some kind of trickery going on.

743
00:56:22,924 --> 00:56:25,394
The people have not even properly seen her highness's face before.

744
00:56:25,394 --> 00:56:26,904
She passed away seven years ago.

745
00:56:26,904 --> 00:56:29,204
Since the apparition is going around wearing the ceremonial dress,

746
00:56:29,204 --> 00:56:31,064
they are speculating that it would be the crown princess.

747
00:56:31,064 --> 00:56:33,484
- Right, it's probably someone acting as her.
 - Eonni!

748
00:56:33,484 --> 00:56:37,324
This time, it's really, really! It's really foolproof!

749
00:56:37,324 --> 00:56:39,244
What do you mean by foolproof?

750
00:56:39,244 --> 00:56:41,254
I mean that there is no way you cannot accept it as fact!

751
00:56:41,254 --> 00:56:43,784
The ghost in the ceremonial dress must be the crown princess!

752
00:56:43,784 --> 00:56:46,664
Supposedly, that ghost appeared at the crown princess' home!

753
00:56:46,664 --> 00:56:48,444
The servants of that household told me

754
00:56:48,444 --> 00:56:51,204
that the dead crown princess's father personally saw her!

755
00:56:51,204 --> 00:56:52,044
What did you say?

756
00:56:52,044 --> 00:56:57,284
He said that everything from her facial features to her height and appearance was that of his daughter.

757
00:56:57,284 --> 00:56:59,624
But the father also says he cannot be sure

758
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:02,064
whether he saw a ghost

759
00:57:02,064 --> 00:57:04,184
or a living person.

760
00:57:04,184 --> 00:57:06,214
This feels like a trick...

761
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:08,234
Someone is trying to cause confusion among the people

762
00:57:08,234 --> 00:57:10,594
to create a greater controversy.

763
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:13,144
I feel like that's what it is, too.

764
00:57:13,144 --> 00:57:15,734
The unofficial exorcist of the royal chambers is here.

765
00:57:15,734 --> 00:57:18,254
How dare they overstep their bounds!

766
00:57:18,254 --> 00:57:20,364
That is it. No matter what,

767
00:57:20,364 --> 00:57:22,924
I will be the one to catch this bastard!

768
00:57:22,924 --> 00:57:24,504
You reveal this fraudster's identity.

769
00:57:24,504 --> 00:57:26,844
I will catch them and beat them up.

770
00:57:31,264 --> 00:57:33,934
But the thing is...

771
00:57:33,934 --> 00:57:37,734
Is a ceremonial dress something that anyone can make?

772
00:57:37,734 --> 00:57:39,524
N-No.

773
00:57:39,524 --> 00:57:41,454
Only the royal tailor

774
00:57:43,144 --> 00:57:46,184
can make the ceremonial dress.

775
00:57:46,184 --> 00:57:48,594
The tailor, you say?

776
00:57:56,934 --> 00:57:58,454
Anyone home?

777
00:57:58,454 --> 00:58:01,534
Tailor Kim Chan Man, are you inside?

778
00:58:04,974 --> 00:58:06,984
 Come inside.

779
00:58:09,184 --> 00:58:10,494
You have to be careful.

780
00:58:10,494 --> 00:58:13,904
He could already be bought off by them.

781
00:58:31,934 --> 00:58:34,394
Please excuse us.

782
00:58:34,394 --> 00:58:35,704
Well,

783
00:58:35,704 --> 00:58:39,054
would it be possible to make some clothes with this?

784
00:58:39,054 --> 00:58:40,274
Why?

785
00:58:40,274 --> 00:58:43,424
Are you planning on getting married while the Marriage Ban Edict is in effect?

786
00:58:44,184 --> 00:58:45,744
Well,

787
00:58:45,744 --> 00:58:47,324
even if it is not right away,

788
00:58:47,324 --> 00:58:50,274
whenever the Marriage Ban Edict ends, we will for sure...

789
00:58:51,094 --> 00:58:54,084
Shouldn't the Royal Investigation Bureau chief arrest people like that?

790
00:58:54,084 --> 00:58:55,924
I would need to get married, too,

791
00:58:55,924 --> 00:58:57,924
when the Marriage Ban Edict ends.

792
00:58:58,784 --> 00:59:01,514
Since I have waited seven years,

793
00:59:01,514 --> 00:59:03,544
I want mine to be as extravagant as possible, Honey.

794
00:59:03,544 --> 00:59:05,194
H-Honey?

795
00:59:05,824 --> 00:59:07,884
All right, then.

796
00:59:07,884 --> 00:59:10,214
Is that the best fabric you have?

797
00:59:10,214 --> 00:59:11,764
That one is off-limits!

798
00:59:11,764 --> 00:59:14,304
It is a precious cloth only used for court ceremonial dress!

799
00:59:14,304 --> 00:59:16,204
I see...

800
00:59:17,664 --> 00:59:19,464
Wow!

801
00:59:20,194 --> 00:59:22,274
Ceremonial dress?

802
00:59:25,654 --> 00:59:27,184
But it seems

803
00:59:27,184 --> 00:59:29,974
as if it's been a while since you made a ceremonial dress.

804
00:59:29,974 --> 00:59:32,404
Perhaps it has been about ten years?

805
00:59:32,404 --> 00:59:35,054
The next queen needs to be selected soon,

806
00:59:35,054 --> 00:59:38,604
so that she can wear what I make for a wedding ceremony.

807
00:59:38,604 --> 00:59:42,754
It is the wish of this old man.

808
00:59:45,614 --> 00:59:49,114
It would be so pretty if you make a dress with this cloth.

809
00:59:49,114 --> 00:59:52,694
Then, that means there are no more ceremonial dresses left in Joseon, right?

810
00:59:52,694 --> 00:59:55,364
There is probably exactly one left.

811
00:59:55,364 --> 00:59:56,314
Where?

812
00:59:56,314 --> 01:00:01,264
His majesty the current king especially gifted a ceremonial dress

813
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:04,014
to the crown princess Ahn's father, Lord Ahn Ji Hyeong.

814
01:00:04,014 --> 01:00:08,424
I suppose he wanted to console a father who lost his child through those means.

815
01:00:08,424 --> 01:00:11,124
Oh, really?

816
01:00:11,124 --> 01:00:16,374
So, has it been about seven years since I made a ceremonial wedding dress?

817
01:00:18,264 --> 01:00:20,674
Well, shall I put my hands to good use for once?

818
01:00:20,674 --> 01:00:22,604
I do not even have to take measurements.

819
01:00:22,604 --> 01:00:25,124
I can tell from just looking at you.

820
01:00:25,124 --> 01:00:27,394
I thought you said this cloth was off-limits.

821
01:00:27,394 --> 01:00:32,214
But for some reason, I feel that a dress made from this cloth would suit you well.

822
01:00:38,204 --> 01:00:41,994
Still, we cannot dare use the cloth reserved for the royal family.

823
01:00:43,044 --> 01:00:44,694
- Let's go.
 - Yes.

824
01:00:44,694 --> 01:00:47,584
We will come back when the marriage ban ends.

825
01:00:53,254 --> 01:00:55,824
Will the two of you come back together?

826
01:01:01,554 --> 01:01:04,404
Yes, we will.

827
01:01:13,224 --> 01:01:16,724
 Tailor

828
01:01:19,934 --> 01:01:21,384
Let's go to the northern village.

829
01:01:21,384 --> 01:01:23,004
All right.

830
01:01:29,104 --> 01:01:31,394
I am Royal Investigation Bureau Chief Lee Sin Won.

831
01:01:31,394 --> 01:01:35,594
I am an inner court lady closely serving his majesty.

832
01:01:35,594 --> 01:01:39,124
I wanted to ask you something about what happened yesterday.

833
01:01:43,284 --> 01:01:47,014
Have you cried all night, by any chance?

834
01:01:48,924 --> 01:01:52,284
I'm so silly. I keep tearing up.

835
01:01:56,114 --> 01:01:58,934
I am sorry to keep asking you about something so uncomfortable,

836
01:01:58,934 --> 01:02:00,814
but was the one you saw last night

837
01:02:00,814 --> 01:02:03,364
really the crown princess?

838
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:06,994
Wouldn't I...

839
01:02:06,994 --> 01:02:09,994
recognize my own daughter?

840
01:02:10,604 --> 01:02:12,924
Are you sure you were not mistaken in the dark?

841
01:02:12,924 --> 01:02:16,524
She was standing too close for that.

842
01:02:26,844 --> 01:02:28,444
Over there.

843
01:02:30,684 --> 01:02:32,914
She was on that well.

844
01:02:37,274 --> 01:02:40,664
When I tried to draw near to see her,

845
01:02:40,664 --> 01:02:43,740
she disappeared like smoke...

846
01:02:51,004 --> 01:02:53,654
I know this is a difficult request,

847
01:02:53,654 --> 01:02:57,964
but could we see your keepsake box of her belongings?

848
01:03:09,614 --> 01:03:12,544
This is the first time I am opening this in seven years.

849
01:03:12,544 --> 01:03:14,864
I could not even touch it

850
01:03:14,864 --> 01:03:17,364
for fear that it might wear away and fade.

851
01:03:51,134 --> 01:03:53,534
The movement in the royal family is unusual.

852
01:03:53,534 --> 01:03:57,584
They seem seriously determined to catch the culprit this time.

853
01:04:10,654 --> 01:04:12,634
Do you know

854
01:04:12,634 --> 01:04:17,904
why people fall for the same tricks of the shell game swindlers the same way?

855
01:04:17,904 --> 01:04:22,064
It is because they believe that they themselves will not be fooled.

856
01:04:26,174 --> 01:04:30,734
As they follow the deceptive hand movements of the shell game swindlers...

857
01:04:32,864 --> 01:04:34,414
Bam!

858
01:04:34,414 --> 01:04:37,174
They get stabbed in the back.

859
01:04:39,194 --> 01:04:40,704
Then...

860
01:04:40,704 --> 01:04:45,244
why do you think I didn't have that girl killed as soon as she left the palace?

861
01:04:45,244 --> 01:04:47,714
It is because there is a different place

862
01:04:47,714 --> 01:04:49,204
I have planned for her death.

863
01:04:49,204 --> 01:04:54,384
If that girl also ends up hanging dead in the palace of the crown princess...

864
01:04:55,064 --> 01:04:58,814
King Yi Heon will never

865
01:04:59,714 --> 01:05:02,784
be able to rise up again.

866
01:05:43,384 --> 01:05:45,024
This sound...

867
01:06:13,484 --> 01:06:15,304
Crown Princess!

868
01:06:15,984 --> 01:06:17,874
Stay right there, Crown Princess!

869
01:06:17,874 --> 01:06:20,014
I-I will come to you!

870
01:06:20,014 --> 01:06:21,724
Your Majesty!

871
01:06:21,724 --> 01:06:23,344
Your Majesty!

872
01:06:26,144 --> 01:06:27,784
Crown Princess...

873
01:06:29,334 --> 01:06:31,524
Crown Princess.

874
01:06:31,524 --> 01:06:33,464
Crown Princess!

875
01:06:34,704 --> 01:06:36,884
Did you not see her with your own eyes as well?

876
01:06:36,884 --> 01:06:38,954
Yes, we saw her!

877
01:06:38,954 --> 01:06:40,464
It was really the crown princess, right?

878
01:06:40,464 --> 01:06:42,604
Yes, it was really her highness.

879
01:06:42,604 --> 01:06:45,604
Then what is going on here!

880
01:06:53,784 --> 01:06:55,364
Your Majesty!

881
01:06:55,364 --> 01:06:57,024
Your Majesty!

882
01:06:57,024 --> 01:06:59,454
- Crown Princess...
 - Your Majesty... Your Majesty!

883
01:06:59,454 --> 01:07:00,304
Crown Princess...

884
01:07:00,304 --> 01:07:02,794
- Your Majesty...
 - Just you wait there. I will go to you.

885
01:07:02,794 --> 01:07:04,504
Please, Your Majesty!

886
01:07:04,504 --> 01:07:06,794
Look at me...

887
01:07:06,794 --> 01:07:09,244
Look at me, please?

888
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:47,100

889
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:49,804
♫  On this night when even the moon is asleep  ♫

890
01:07:49,804 --> 01:07:52,364
 The Forbidden Marriage 
 Preview

891
01:07:52,364 --> 01:07:55,124
 We need to find that woman before she leaves the palace.

892
01:07:55,124 --> 01:07:57,044
 A full investigation of all the palace ladies?

893
01:07:57,044 --> 01:07:59,954
 She is heading toward her own grave.

894
01:07:59,954 --> 01:08:03,584
 I have received an order to find a suspicious court lady whose background is unknown.

895
01:08:03,584 --> 01:08:06,044
 What is your real name?

896
01:08:06,044 --> 01:08:07,674
 What do you mean your name is not real?

897
01:08:07,674 --> 01:08:09,244
 What do you mean by that?

898
01:08:09,244 --> 01:08:12,504
 Do you not think this is a warning about So Rang?

899
01:08:12,504 --> 01:08:15,104
 Does that mean they will target So Rang?

900
01:08:15,104 --> 01:08:16,734
 Your Majesty!

901
01:08:16,734 --> 01:08:18,954
 So Rang was... So Rang was...

902
01:08:18,954 --> 01:08:20,974
 What is the reason

903
01:08:20,974 --> 01:08:24,044
 I want to be by your side, even if I were to die?

904
01:08:24,044 --> 01:08:27,454
 We must find her tonight!

905
01:08:30,514 --> 01:08:32,054
♫  Even if it is a bit foolish...  ♫
