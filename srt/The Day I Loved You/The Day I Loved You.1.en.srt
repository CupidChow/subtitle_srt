00:13:59,202 --> 00:14:00,495
Unfair.

187
00:14:00,945 --> 00:14:02,488
He didn’t even get suspended?

188
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:04,557
Is it because he’s a foreigner?

189
00:14:05,453 --> 00:14:07,163
You know nothing about fairness.

190
00:14:07,783 --> 00:14:08,576
Huh?

191
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:10,146
That’s what he told me.

192
00:14:10,764 --> 00:14:12,141
He said I know nothing

193
00:14:12,141 --> 00:14:14,059
about how the world is unfair.

194
00:14:16,668 --> 00:14:19,671
He’s not suspended but he has a punishment.

195
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:21,625
And one more thing...

196
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:23,628
he is joining us

197
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,957
for the soiree.

198
00:14:24,957 --> 00:14:26,041
What?

199
00:14:26,695 --> 00:14:30,073
How? He’s not a member of the dance troupe and

200
00:14:30,073 --> 00:14:33,535
I’m sure he won’t attend the rehearsals.
He’ll give us a headache.

201
00:14:33,584 --> 00:14:35,026
We have no choice.

202
00:14:35,026 --> 00:14:36,861
It was Ms. Arzadon’s call.

203
00:14:38,373 --> 00:14:39,833
And one more thing, Justin.

204
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,105
What happened to giving chances?

205
00:14:42,604 --> 00:14:46,316
That’s what our Religion Class.

206
00:14:49,243 --> 00:14:50,953
You’re such a nice person.

207
00:14:50,953 --> 00:14:53,111
That’s why I like you.

208
00:14:53,111 --> 00:14:54,529
What?

209
00:14:54,749 --> 00:14:56,167
Nothing.

210
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,169
[GASPS]

211
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:05,859
Oh no, I didn’t see you.

212
00:15:05,859 --> 00:15:08,769
Your old clothes got wet.

213
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:12,596
Ooops. Burn.

214
00:15:13,008 --> 00:15:14,843
Huh? What do you mean ‘burn’?

215
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:17,301
Burn. Period.

216
00:15:17,563 --> 00:15:19,315
It’s okay. No worries.

217
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:22,577
Oh no, sissy. I’m not worried about you.

218
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:26,931
No one will notice you because you’re a nobody.

219
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:32,552
Ashley.

220
00:15:33,385 --> 00:15:34,970
I don’t want to get noticed anyway.

221
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:37,982
And I can easily change clothes.

222
00:15:38,143 --> 00:15:39,228
Mmm.

223
00:15:39,549 --> 00:15:42,135
How about your attitude, when
are you going to change it?

224
00:15:42,996 --> 00:15:44,831
That one is “burn”.

225
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,627
Whose side are you?

226
00:15:46,902 --> 00:15:48,195
I’m just saying.

227
00:15:48,438 --> 00:15:49,481
Let’s go.

228
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:52,385
But it’s true.

229
00:15:52,498 --> 00:15:53,541
That’s burn.

230
00:16:21,463 --> 00:16:23,424
Why did she spill it on you?

231
00:16:23,424 --> 00:16:25,634
Don’t you know Ashley?

232
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:29,476
Don’t worry. Just ask your Mom to clean it for you.

233
00:16:32,315 --> 00:16:33,274
Hey.

234
00:16:35,396 --> 00:16:37,023
Yes, Eli?

235
00:16:39,476 --> 00:16:40,978
When is the...

236
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,793
when is the dance practice again?
