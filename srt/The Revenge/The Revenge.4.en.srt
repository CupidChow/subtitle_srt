1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,040
Besides, before he left for the city,

2
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,360
he seemed upset to be away from them.

3
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,160
Chuan, Im, you're dead!

4
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,240
Don't you think I won't fight back.

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,040
Please forgive me.
I didn't mean to do that my Lady.

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,400
Fools always fall prey to the wise,

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,040
especially a lustful woman
like Thongkliao.

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,840
Women who own Chamob

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,280
will be blessed by charming spells.

10
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,000
Any girls shameless enough
to become mistresses

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,480
will face the wrath of a wife like me.

12
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,560
I really don't want to do this.

13
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,080
But to have him all by myself,
I need to do it.

14
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,400
Did you see Thong?
Fools always fall prey to the wise.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,320
To be honest,

16
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,280
Thongkliao isn't that stupid.

17
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,520
But it is you my Lady,

18
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,800
who is extraordinarily brilliant
beyond anyone's grasp.

19
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,960
This isn't enough yet.

20
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,320
If people discover the misfortune item
you hid in her room,

21
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,120
Luang Wisut will banish her for good

22
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,160
for involving herself with those items.

23
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,000
Chuan.

24
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,240
Tuan.

25
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,120
Lady Raya, how can we be of service?

26
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,440
If you are all done with cooking,

27
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,480
please go clean Thongkliao's room.

28
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,840
Luang Wisut might sleep there tonight.

29
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,560
Lady Raya. She's too generous.

30
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,200
She's not mad at Thongkliao at all

31
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,200
and still cares for her well-being.

32
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,400
I really don't understand

33
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,600
why the Lord is more passionate
about her than Lady Raya.

34
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,280
I assume she is using
some kind of occult spell.

35
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,400
If not, there's no way

36
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,840
The Lord could fall for her
head over heels.

37
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,320
That's true.

38
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,000
I saw Thongkliao acting suspicious
with a merchant this morning.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,640
That's it!

40
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,600
If any of you

41
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,840
see anything weird in Thongkliao's room,

42
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,840
you have to take it to the Lord.

43
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,000
Got it.

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,560
It's almost time the Lord is back.

45
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,840
You all keep cleaning.
I will go welcome him.

46
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,600
-Yes.
-Let's go.

47
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,760
Welcome back Dear.

48
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,120
My Lord.

49
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,080
I missed you so much.

50
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,720
He was just here this morning.

51
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,760
There's no way you miss him that much.

52
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,959
I'm just so in love.

53
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,200
It's hot out here. Let's go inside Dear.

54
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,040
I agree. It is really hot.

55
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,640
You've worked all day.

56
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,760
You must be so sore.

57
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,640
Let me give you a massage.

58
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,360
Chuan!

59
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,080
What is it?

60
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,160
I don't know.

61
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,760
Let me see.

62
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,080
BOOK OF ENCHANTMENT

63
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,320
What's happening?

64
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,240
We found this.

65
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,120
BOOK OF ENCHANTMENT

66
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,680
What if this is one of the things
Thong was talking about?

67
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,520
Oh dear. What should we do?

68
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,920
No. I won't let Thongkliao
cause any more harm to Lady Raya.

69
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,320
Let's show this to the Lord.

70
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,320
Yes.

71
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,320
Let's go.

72
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,560
What's the commotion?
Why are you all panicking?

73
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,240
What's in your hand?

74
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,600
I'm not very sure.

75
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,360
It was hidden under Thongkliao's bed.

76
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,280
My room?

77
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,800
What is it?

78
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,600
Please see for yourself.

79
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,280
BOOK OF ENCHANTMENT

80
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
Book of Enchantment?

81
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,320
That's not mine.

82
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,480
Why would I have this?

83
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,920
But it was really there, my Lord.

84
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,440
It was tucked under the mattress,

85
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,200
right, Tuan and Im?

86
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,360
-Yes.
-Yes.

87
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,080
No. I have nothing to do with it.

88
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,400
So Thongkliao bought it

89
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,480
from the Chinese merchant.

90
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,800
What are you whispering?

91
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
It's nothing.

92
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,840
Chuan. Tell us everything you know.

93
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,440
Say it Chuan. I won't mind.

94
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,760
But if not, Luang Wisut will punish you.

95
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,680
So… we, by chance,

96
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,040
saw Thongkliao buying something
from a Chinese merchant.

97
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,000
What is it that you bought?

98
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,360
What is it? Tell me.

99
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,640
I really can't tell you that my Lord.

100
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,120
But it was not this book for sure.

101
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,920
-Liar!
-It's true!

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,360
Then how could it end up in your room?

103
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,760
I don't know.

104
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,080
My Lady. Despite her denial,

105
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,440
I think she surely bought it
from the merchant.

106
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,320
This kind of book
shouldn't be brought home.

107
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,400
It is the source of misfortune.

108
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,080
Dear. Misfortune?

109
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,400
I didn't do this my Lord.

110
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,000
It was not me, really.

111
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,440
-I had no idea.
-Thongkliao!

112
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,520
Don't bring the misfortune near him.

113
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,440
Oops.

114
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,200
This… How dare you
keep this misfortune item with you?

115
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,880
No. It's not mine!

116
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,960
Then how did it end up in your hair?

117
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,640
My Lord.

118
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,600
It really wasn't me.

119
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,720
-Dear.
-My Lord.

120
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,640
You have to believe me.

121
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,240
My Lord.

122
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,480
Dear.

123
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,680
I'm sorry
I didn't keep an eye on Thongkliao.

124
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,040
I let her commit this shameful blasphemy.

125
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,680
Now I'm afraid Dear,

126
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,840
that unfortunate events will occur.

127
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,280
You have to banish Thongkliao

128
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,200
To prevent any catastrophes.

129
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,280
Raya. How can catastrophes occur?

130
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,840
Thongkliao is not a kid anymore.

131
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,000
She has a husband.

132
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,480
Sure, she's surrounded by scandals.

133
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,720
But in fact, our servants are to blame

134
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,320
for digging through Thongkliao's stuff
without permission.

135
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,880
Dear.

136
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,320
More importantly,

137
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,680
Thongkliao is so dedicated

138
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,440
to serving and taking care of me.

139
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,320
She dares to do what you wouldn't.

140
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,720
After what she has done,

141
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,240
do you really want me to punish her?

142
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,760
I wouldn't have the heart to.

143
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,760
My Lord.

144
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,160
I'm truly sorry my Lord.

145
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,680
But I really don't know

146
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,760
how that damned book ended up in my room.

147
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,280
And in fact,

148
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,760
I couldn't read a single word.

149
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,680
Forget it. Let bygones be bygones.

150
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,520
So you're not angry with me?

151
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,960
I'm not.

152
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:10,240
Instead, I'm happy
that you go all out in serving me.

153
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,400
My Lord.

154
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,880
I'm so lucky to be your wife.

155
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,440
I swear on my life

156
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,880
that I'll always be loyal to you

157
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,320
to return the love and mercy
that you gave me, my Lord.

158
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,400
I thank you for being grateful
and loyal to me.

159
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,800
But I'd like to ask you one thing.

160
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,800
What is it?

161
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,920
Children.

162
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,640
I really want children Thongkliao.

163
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,720
Tuan.

164
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,280
I feel really bad for Lady Raya.

165
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,200
She must be deep in sadness.

166
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,960
She's up so early to make merit.

167
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,480
No one could sleep well after all this.

168
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,320
I heard some servants say that last night

169
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,120
The Lord still slept with Thongkliao.

170
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,160
Tell me honestly Thong.
How is she better than me?

171
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,400
She's just a servant, a peasant.

172
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,440
How can Luang Wisut love her more?

173
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,600
Thongkliao

174
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,280
really has nothing on you my Lady.

175
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,040
Please do not stress out too much.

176
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,160
Men sometimes love strange things.

177
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,160
Maybe the Lord does as well.

178
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,800
I won't allow that.

179
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,640
I will do everything

180
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,280
to get her out of this place.

181
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,600
Are you asleep Thongkliao?

182
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,000
Not yet my Lady.

183
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,160
Why are you up so late?

184
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,680
I'm waiting for the Lord.

185
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,240
He told me he'll be here tonight.

186
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,640
Is that so?

187
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,160
Can I help you?

188
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,680
I'm worried about you.

189
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,120
Worried? Why would you be?

190
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,960
I'm happy and well.

191
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,080
And the Lord is so in love with me.

192
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,400
It's about that book in your room.

193
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,280
You said you didn't buy it.

194
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,720
Then how could it end up here?

195
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,720
I wonder too.

196
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,440
I think someone has a grudge against you.

197
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,520
Who could that be?

198
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,200
Who do you constantly fight with?

199
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,640
Who found this book here.

200
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,800
Chuan. Im.

201
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,880
So it was Chuan and Im.

202
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,120
I don't want to think too much.

203
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,920
However,

204
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,880
it was a curious case.

205
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,800
You already know that Luang Wisut
gave them an allowance.

206
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,800
He provides them what they need.

207
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,800
He might have them as wives in no time.

208
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,800
They must know this already

209
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,320
so they look for ways to get rid of you.

210
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,480
Then I'll find a way to make them

211
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,760
get married to Bun and Ying quickly.

212
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,320
Good.

213
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,240
I believe we can both make our man happy,

214
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,480
especially you.

215
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,560
I owe you a lot

216
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,800
for taking care of him so well

217
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,800
and letting me be a legitimate wife.

218
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,480
Thank you.

219
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,040
From now on, you can call me Raya.

220
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,560
Thank you.

221
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,600
You are so kind to me, Raya.

222
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,560
I promise

223
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,720
I'll serve and take care of you
for the rest of my life

224
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,280
to repay the mercy you give me.

225
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,840
Thank you so much.

226
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,440
I think Luang Wisut will be happy

227
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,880
to see us both in harmony.

228
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,400
When things with Thongkliao quiet down,

229
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,760
I might inform the Lord
about me and Chuan.

230
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,000
Som. Mi.

231
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,400
Please come with me.

232
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,960
Sure.

233
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,320
I want to take Im too.

234
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,400
Som. Mi. Help me if I struggle.

235
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,120
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

236
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,480
Raya. I have urgent business.

237
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,839
Why is it so urgent?

238
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,400
If a king's servant receives a letter,
they must go immediately.

239
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,880
I will prepare your uniform.

240
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,280
Thank you Raya.

241
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,320
Bun. Get ready. It's urgent.

242
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,720
Yes my Lord.

243
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,280
What are you all doing here?

244
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,760
Nothing my Lord.

245
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,760
We're just here as usual
to serve all of you.

246
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,960
Right. Hurry up.

247
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,040
Yes.

248
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,800
I will miss you so much.

249
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,400
Have a safe journey Dear.

250
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,880
Thank you.

251
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,400
Please return quickly. I miss you already.

252
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,760
And don't think of having someone else.

253
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,760
I won't let you.

254
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,480
I have to go.

255
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,600
Hey!

256
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,560
Im. Chuan. I saw you look at my husband.

257
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,200
No one is stupid enough
to drool over the Lord like that.

258
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,360
Then why did they look at him?

259
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,200
Stop what you are both
thinking about doing.

260
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,080
Know your place as servants.

261
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,160
Don't overstep a wife like me.

262
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,080
Get out of here.

263
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,240
Go!

264
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,840
Did I do well Raya?

265
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,720
Well done.

266
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,840
But if they're still eyeing the Lord,

267
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,320
they will both face consequences.

268
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,760
I can't believe
how ridiculous Thongkliao is.

269
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,160
Lady Raya didn't even say a word.

270
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,840
It was her alone,
who kept babbling nonsense.

271
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,560
I guess we can't call her just Thongkliao.

272
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,600
How about Lady Thingkliao?

273
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,400
Chuan. Did you forget

274
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,120
she claims herself as a lord's wife

275
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,880
not servants like us?

276
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,960
It's like she forgot where her roots are.

277
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,080
Forget her.

278
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,080
Her love for the Lord makes her mad.

279
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,400
If no one touches him, she's fine.

280
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,920
But let's talk about you. Chuan. Im.

281
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,800
What are the chances?

282
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,960
When we're ready to mention your weddings,

283
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,720
something always comes up. Every time.

284
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,760
It's like heaven's decrees
prevent you from marrying.

285
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,560
How could you say that Mother?

286
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,440
You're not helping at all.

287
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,480
It's nothing Chuan.
the Lord was just busy.

288
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,160
We'll find a good chance
to inform him when he is back.

289
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,840
I have a bad feeling about this.

290
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,880
What is it Ying?

291
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,280
I'm afraid that
we won't be able to live together.

292
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,280
What's for breakfast?

293
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,640
It smells so good.

294
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,200
They look appetizing.

295
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,280
Chuan. Serve them to Lady Raya
and let's eat.

296
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,160
Chuan. Serve the meal for Lady Thongkliao
in her house.

297
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,680
She is the Lord's wife.

298
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,080
She can't eat with servants.

299
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,280
As you wish.

300
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,080
Are you all being sarcastic?

301
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,760
No one dares my Lady.

302
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,200
We have to know our place.

303
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,360
Servants must not overstep the boundaries.

304
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,720
The kitchen is hot.
Please go wait in the house.

305
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,360
The meal will be served there.

306
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,560
Im. Don't forget to serve her
Dotty Chilli Paste set.

307
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,960
Chuan! Who did you call dotty?

308
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,680
Hold on.

309
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,880
Who would be bold enough to do so?

310
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,520
I just really want you
to try Dotty Chilli Paste.

311
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,720
Because eating it might make you

312
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,320
forget your husband sometimes

313
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,360
so you are not picking a fight

314
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,040
or causing any headaches.

315
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,400
Chuan!

316
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,800
Don't you think
that I'm afraid of you Thongkliao.

317
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,520
An insolent one like you
will face me, a servant.

318
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,680
You've got it.

319
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,640
Thongkliao! Let me go!

320
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,440
Chuan!

321
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:35,640
-Stop!
-What is this?

322
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,760
Let go!

323
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,960
Stop at once.

324
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,720
What is this?
Why does this keep happening here?

325
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,360
Chuan started it.

326
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,840
She told me to eat some Dotty Chilli Paste
to forget the Lord.

327
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,840
Is that true?

328
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,720
Yes my Lady.

329
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,680
But I didn't mean to offend her.

330
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,760
How? There's no food called Dotty.

331
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,200
It exists my Lady.

332
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,880
Let me take a look at the dishes.

333
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,200
This is a Dotty Chilli Paste set.

334
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:18,000
It is in fact, a fresh chili paste
with grilled fish

335
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,240
seasoned with traditional herbs
like chilies, onions, and garlic.

336
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,400
Legend has it that

337
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,360
a wife enjoyed this so much,
she forgot her husband.

338
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,280
Especially if you eat them
with a fresh vegetable set,

339
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,800
it will taste so good together.
They said that

340
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,640
a wife kept eating and let her husband
tend to the rice farm alone.

341
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,480
Then, I'd like to try some.

342
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,640
Is it delicious my Lady?

343
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,480
It really tastes good.

344
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,000
Perhaps we should have it
available at all times

345
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,320
so I cam eat it
whenever I miss my husband.

346
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,960
Thongkliao. Do you want some?

347
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,920
I'd rather not. With these faces around,
I've lost my appetite.

348
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,440
I think she's being unstable.

349
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,320
Don't mind her.

350
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,080
As least we all live here together.

351
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,840
Better be amicable towards one another.

352
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,440
Yes.

353
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,360
For this food,

354
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,960
come get some for each of you.
I don't mind sharing.

355
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,320
-Thank you my Lady.
-Thank you.

356
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,760
It was so

357
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,920
hilarious to watch
Thongkliao being flustered.

358
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,760
I told you she will have no place here.

359
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,960
Even if Luang Wisut is so crazy about her,

360
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,760
all the servants will still be mine.

361
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,240
Thongkliao will become irrelevant.

362
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,280
It's true my Lady. Whatever happens,

363
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,160
these foolish servants

364
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,840
will take your side my Lady.

365
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,560
She'll be pushed out in no time.

366
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,440
I can't wait for that day to come Thong.

367
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,880
Me too, my Lady.

368
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,440
It's so refreshing

369
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,640
to see the river after a long day.

370
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,560
True my Lord.

371
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,160
Bun. What are you thinking?

372
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,200
You gave me strange looks recently.

373
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,160
Well… I'd like to ask your permission.

374
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,520
Then spill it out.

375
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,640
Do not hesitate, alright?

376
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,600
Ying and I
would like to marry Im and Chuan, my Lord.

377
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,080
I won't allow it.

378
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,760
Why is that Dear?

379
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,240
Why are you in a hurry?

380
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,840
Som and Mi are getting old.

381
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,280
Don't you care
to stay with your parents Chuan?

382
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,600
She could still take care of them

383
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,760
after she got married.

384
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,640
That's not the same.

385
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,320
A married woman

386
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,360
should focus on her husband and children.
Just like you.

387
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,680
But I think

388
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,360
we should let them start a family

389
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,640
so Bun and Ying could help
with the parents.

390
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,480
Shut your mouth. Permission denied!

391
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,400
We understand, my Lord.

392
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,200
I will ask again whenever you see fit.

393
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,600
Just as I thought.

394
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,840
Another obstacle preventing our marriage.

395
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,960
I don't understand.

396
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,560
Even if we're our own family,

397
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,400
that doesn't mean I'll abandon my parents.

398
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,800
Yes. Bun and Ying

399
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,680
can also help take care of Som and Mi.

400
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,240
Bun.

401
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,920
You have to find a chance to ask again.

402
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,280
I will try. But to be honest,

403
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,600
I've never seen the Lord this angry.

404
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,320
I think so.

405
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,200
It's like he's a different person.

406
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,120
Yes.

407
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,320
What has gotten into him?

408
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,720
I wonder.

409
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,640
I don't understand

410
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,800
why you didn't let them get married.

411
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,640
Like I said Raya,

412
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,240
Som and Mi are both getting old.

413
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,640
Chuan should stay with them. That's it.

414
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,280
What about Im?

415
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,000
She has no parents.

416
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,400
What's preventing her
from being with Ying?

417
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,720
Since her parents died,

418
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,720
Som and Mi raised her, didn't they?

419
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,160
But Som and Mi

420
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,120
are not even her real parents.

421
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,840
Raya.

422
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,600
They both are young and beautiful.

423
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,320
Don't tell me you're being so protective

424
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,800
because you want them.

425
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,440
It's not like that Raya.

426
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,480
Don't. I can see through your lies.

427
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,640
You've promised me

428
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,400
you wouldn't have anyone else.
But what is this?

429
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,880
Both Chuan and Im?

430
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,160
Raya.

431
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,520
I don't know how to put it.

432
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,360
I don't really have eyes on them.

433
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,360
I just…

434
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,280
Just what?

435
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,120
I want…

436
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,360
to have children.

437
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,720
You cannot have them for me.

438
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,800
The same as Thongkliao.

439
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,120
So you want both Chuan and Im?

440
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,880
If you would let me,

441
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,240
I will have only Chuan

442
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,200
and no one else. I promise.

443
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,800
Dear…

444
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,600
Please Raya. Let me have Chuan.

445
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,040
No one else.

446
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,600
Raya.

447
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,360
Raya.

448
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,520
Thong!

449
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,240
Yes my Lady. How can I help?

450
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,720
I will return to Bangkok Noi.

451
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,200
Now?

452
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,920
Yes. Now.

453
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,400
Get up already.

454
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,800
Yes my Lady.

455
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,840
Raya.

456
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,440
Please calm down. Let's talk this over.

457
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,040
I cannot be calm.

458
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,760
Please feel free to do as you like.

459
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,760
I will go home.

460
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,120
Please Raya.

461
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,200
Step aside.

462
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,440
Alright. If you insist on going home,

463
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,640
I will send Bun to take you home
first thing in the morning.

464
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,560
Raya, please don't go. I'm worried.

465
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,120
I'd like some peaceful time by myself.

466
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,120
I'll be back when I feel better.

467
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,480
I will wait for you.

468
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,320
Raya. Given how many women I've had,

469
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,800
the person I love and respect the most
is you Raya.

470
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,080
Why don't you understand me?

471
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,360
What's happening now
that made Lady Raya return home?

472
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,600
Is it because of Thongkliao?

473
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,120
It's not me. It's both of them.

474
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,480
And why would we be involved?

475
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,120
Don't play coy.

476
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,160
You both made eyes at the Lord.

477
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,040
So he wants to have you both!

478
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,080
Stop it!

479
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,440
Stop it Thongkliao!

480
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,400
You know
they'll get married to Bun and me.

481
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,840
Why are you being jealous?

482
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,000
They cannot be trusted.

483
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,680
You can make us swear
on anything you want.

484
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,240
Good. Don't go back on your words

485
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,680
or I'll kill you both.

486
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,080
Let go!

487
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,520
Move!

488
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,480
I'm afraid. I really am.

489
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,360
Calm down.
Don't make a big deal out of it.

490
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,080
She's just being crazy as usual.
It will pass.

491
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,480
But I have a bad feeling.

492
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:56,640
Why else would the Lord
forbid our marriage?

493
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,040
Ying. I'm afraid.

494
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,040
Me too.

495
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,560
But I won't lose you to him

496
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,320
even if I have to die.

497
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,720
What possessed you to invite me
to have a drink with you?

498
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,640
Thep. I'm in distress.

499
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,960
My wife doesn't understand a word I say.

500
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,160
No woman would understand

501
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,800
things like this, Luang Wisut.

502
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,720
But I've told Raya

503
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,560
she's the wife that I love

504
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,320
and respect the most.

505
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,520
How could you say that? I won't allow it!

506
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,920
Thongkliao!

507
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,920
What are you doing? Stop shouting.

508
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,320
You said that you're in love with me!

509
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,520
How could you tell people otherwise?

510
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,760
Can you shut up?!

511
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,679
-No!
-Hey!

512
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,400
-Stop!
-I won't!

513
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,760
-I told you to stop!
-No!

514
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,880
No!

515
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,080
Stop!

516
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,639
Stop right now!

517
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,000
My Lord.

518
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,920
Get out of here. Go!

519
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,639
-No.
-I said get out!

520
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,800
Take her away. Quick!

521
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,159
-Let's go.
-My Lord.

522
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,560
My Lord!

523
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:38,000
Put her in the cell until tomorrow.

524
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,800
-My Lord!
-Chuan, Im.

525
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,880
You two go ahead

526
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,159
and prepare a room for Khun Phra

527
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,760
so he can rest well.

528
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,920
It's all right, Luang Wisut.
I can go home.

529
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,880
Go ahead.

530
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,400
Yes.

531
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,520
What a turn off.

532
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,160
Thongkliao.

533
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,120
Always the one who causes problems.

534
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,360
But this time is huge.

535
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,960
I would say so.

536
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,080
The Lord really showed

537
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,920
that he's mad and embarrassed.

538
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,160
He might be upset with her now.

539
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,520
Perhaps. He's already upset
about Lady Raya.

540
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,360
All this at once can make him snap.

541
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,600
Thongkliao.

542
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,760
Does she know
she'll get herself killed by her jealousy?

543
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,880
Oh dear.
Im, I forgot to put out the torch.

544
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,240
That's right.
We'll get in trouble if there's a fire.

545
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,240
Let's go back.

546
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,160
I'll go with you.

547
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,480
Chuan.

548
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,000
Bring me herbal compress balls

549
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,440
and follow me
to attend to Thongkliao's bruise.

550
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,440
But…

551
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,120
It's fine. You go get the herbal compress.

552
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,000
I'll go put out the torch.

553
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,120
Hurry up.

554
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,560
What's taking them so long?

555
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,880
It's just preparing the room.

556
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,880
Are you not done with the room yet?

557
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,400
My Lord.

558
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,360
My Lord.

559
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,440
Im?

560
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,320
Yes.

561
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,000
Tonight…

562
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,240
you look so beautiful.

563
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,800
My Lord.

564
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,920
Please don't.

565
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,760
Are you pregnant Raya?

566
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,720
I'm so happy!

567
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,880
Why is it not me?

568
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,600
Pregnancy can be miscarried.

569
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,560
The important thing is…

570
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,520
who's to blame.

571
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,640
Could you be pregnant?

572
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,600
You backstabber! What a vile woman!

573
