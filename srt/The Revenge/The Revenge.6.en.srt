1
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,480
What is happening?

2
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
Lady Raya!

3
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,360
Why are you two fighting?

4
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,000
I have something to tell you.

5
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,040
Tell me what?

6
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,680
It's Luang Wisut and Im.

7
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,120
What about them?

8
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,080
They slept together

9
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,080
and now she's pregnant.

10
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,240
Pregnant?

11
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,480
Dear.

12
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,280
Raya. Listen to me.

13
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,400
My Lord.

14
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,040
Where are you going?

15
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,240
We need to talk.

16
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,640
Move. I will go after my wife!

17
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,760
I am your wife as well.

18
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,320
You need to talk to me first.

19
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,240
I know! Save it for later!

20
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,360
-Raya!
-My Lord.

21
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,120
My Lord! Come back and talk to me!

22
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,120
Let go!

23
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,840
Somebody get her out of here!

24
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,760
Raya.

25
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,840
I'm sorry. Please listen to me.

26
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,720
You promised me

27
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,280
you wouldn't have anyone else.

28
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,120
But now you have Im. And she's pregnant.

29
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,840
Is that the reason

30
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,760
you won't let her marry Ying.

31
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,200
It's not like that.

32
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,880
Then what is it like?

33
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,280
Um.

34
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,800
That day you ran away from me back home,

35
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,160
I was so saddened.

36
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,560
I had too much to drink.

37
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,800
I lost control and…

38
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,400
…things got out of hand.

39
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,600
Out of hand?

40
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,800
Have you ever thought

41
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,440
how painful and heartbreaking it is

42
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,560
for a wife like me? Have you?!

43
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,360
Raya.

44
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,840
Raya.

45
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,040
I already told you there's no way

46
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,680
I'll love and respect anyone
more than you.

47
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,960
But now

48
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,520
I'll have to tolerate Im's presence
around this house.

49
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,400
She's now a thorn in my side
just like Thongkliao.

50
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,000
No. There's no way.

51
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,560
If she disgusts you,

52
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,680
I'll keep her in her place.

53
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,680
Raya. Please don't cry.

54
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,400
For our child's sake.

55
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,120
For our child.

56
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,920
I promise you

57
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,280
Im is the last one.

58
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,760
After this, I'll be a good husband.

59
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,040
I'll make sure that my Raya

60
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,240
will never be hurt again.

61
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,840
I'm so terrible for betraying Lady Raya.

62
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,720
Im, You're not terrible.

63
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,520
You've been violated.

64
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,760
I know that you're upset too.

65
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,040
I am his servant.

66
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,840
I can handle all types of pain.

67
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,120
But a kind-hearted one like Lady Raya

68
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,720
should never be upset by someone like me.

69
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,120
There's nothing you can do.

70
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,000
Lady Raya knows about this now.

71
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,480
What about my child?

72
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,040
Will he take my child away from me?

73
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,080
Bun said Luang Wisut already has a child.

74
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,360
He won't be interested in taking yours.

75
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,480
I hope that's the case. I'm afraid.

76
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,440
I'm afraid he'll take my child away.

77
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,040
Is Im really pregnant?

78
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,440
What will you do now My Lady?

79
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,560
There's nothing I can do

80
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,320
except surrender to his desires.

81
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,600
What do you mean My Lady?

82
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,880
He wants Im to be another mistress of his.

83
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,039
Huh? So now Im will definitely

84
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,919
rise up and cause trouble
just like Thongkliao.

85
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,640
This can't be happening.

86
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,160
You cannot let this slide

87
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,320
unless you want them
to rise above you someday.

88
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Do you really think I'll let that happen?
I won't.

89
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
So all my kindness

90
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,920
and the mercy I gave means nothing.

91
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,440
All I got in return is betrayal.
We will see.

92
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,080
I'll make Im the source of misfortune,
the catastrophe of this house.

93
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,680
Mark my words Thong.

94
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,040
It reeks of preserved Champak.

95
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,480
How is that possible Im?

96
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,840
I cleaned it all up.

97
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,000
Plus, Lady Raya gave them to us
for worshipping

98
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,320
but then it was all spilled
during the fight.

99
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,600
We should be ashamed, not…

100
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,120
But it smells bad to me.

101
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,840
Keep your act together no matter what.

102
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,640
Think of Lady Raya's kindness.

103
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,960
If she knew it was all spilled,

104
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,200
she would be so upset.

105
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,600
Give her a break.

106
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,000
Pregnant women can show symptoms
when they have morning sickness.

107
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,960
Then why do Im's symptoms look so severe?

108
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,800
Lady Raya seems really normal.

109
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,320
Bun.

110
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,320
Symptoms are different for each person.

111
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,360
But I'm curious.

112
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,000
What now Tuan?

113
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,320
Im might be pregnant with something

114
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,600
called "Jealous Child".

115
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,160
Jealous Child?

116
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,320
So, when Lady Raya got pregnant,

117
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,760
Im also got pregnant with a child
that will steal all the love.

118
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,760
If Luang Wisut happens to love this child

119
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,280
more than Lady Raya's child,

120
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,960
you're in big trouble Im.

121
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,760
I don't want anything like that.

122
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,480
-I don't…
-Im…

123
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,000
I just said what I heard from legends.

124
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,960
Don't worry about things to come.

125
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,200
Here Im.

126
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,360
Drink this ginger tea.

127
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,840
It will make you feel better.

128
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
Luang Wisut.

129
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,520
Im.

130
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
Im.

131
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,000
How are you doing?

132
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
I…

133
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,640
-My Lord!
-Huh?

134
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,240
-Lady Raya fell down the stairs!
-What?!

135
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,480
Please hurry up!

136
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
What?

137
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,120
Raya!

138
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,320
Raya. Are you hurt?

139
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,280
Thong. Go get the doctor!

140
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,880
-Thong, I'll go.
-No.

141
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,000
Go help them.

142
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,280
I can handle this.

143
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,080
Which way to go?

144
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,720
Ying.

145
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,240
I'm afraid.

146
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,120
I'm afraid something will happen
to Lady Raya.

147
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,440
Try not to worry Im.

148
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,680
She's kind-hearted.
Nothing bad will ever happen to her.

149
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,720
Damn you.

150
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,880
Tuan.

151
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,720
Of all the stories to tell,

152
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,200
you chose to discourage her.

153
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,880
I didn't know. I said what I heard.

154
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,800
It's all right Som.

155
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,800
Im and Lady Raya are unrelated.

156
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,920
Most importantly, this is my child,

157
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,280
not Luang Wisut's.

158
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,560
The truth always prevails.

159
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,280
Stop lying to yourself Ying.

160
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,640
Emergency!

161
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,200
What happened Mi?

162
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,160
Lady Raya was lying on the floor,
covered in blood.

163
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,520
I'm afraid Lady Raya

164
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,920
will miscarry.

165
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,200
You will be fine Raya.

166
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,120
Please stay calm.

167
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,720
Come. Hurry up.

168
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,680
My Lord, Prik is here.

169
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,040
-Hurry.
-Who is this?

170
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,000
The doctor you sent me to find.

171
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,640
She's a well-respected midwife

172
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,760
people always talk about.

173
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,320
I meant a western physician.

174
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,720
Raya fell down the stairs,
not giving birth.

175
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,760
Why get a midwife?

176
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,920
I can tend to all of a woman's symptoms.

177
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,280
Please give us some space.

178
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,600
No. I will wait for a physician.

179
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,600
Bun. Go get a physician now.
You're so unreliable.

180
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,800
Yes.

181
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,080
-What happened?
-My Lady!

182
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,920
My Lord.

183
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,880
Talk to me.

184
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,960
Lady Raya is getting worse.

185
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,280
-What do we do?!
-Please wait outside.

186
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,840
Let Prik take a look.

187
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,600
Please give us some room.

188
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,520
My Lord.

189
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,320
She's crying more and more.

190
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,840
Bring us some boiled water.

191
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,960
Yes Grandma.

192
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,200
Please wait outside My Lord.

193
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,720
Give us some space.

194
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,960
She won't stop crying.

195
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,360
She's getting worse.

196
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,160
Shut the door. Don't let any men inside.

197
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,840
Please forgive me.

198
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,600
Thong. Where is this blood from?

199
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,000
It's chicken blood My Lady.

200
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,520
I assure you no one saw what I did.

201
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,160
I went very far
to get it from a southern village.

202
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,920
But…

203
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
My Lady Raya is so convincing.

204
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,920
Luang Wisut didn't suspect anything.

205
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,080
What should I tell him My Lady?

206
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,440
Tell him I miscarried.

207
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,560
Right. I'll tell him that.

208
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,000
Hey. Don't just tell him.

209
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,240
You have to keep quiet

210
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,320
about the fact that she's not pregnant.

211
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,840
If anyone knows about this, you're dead.

212
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,760
Yes.

213
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,840
It's yours.

214
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,560
I'll take this to the grave.

215
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,760
Chuan.

216
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,400
What happened?

217
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,240
Lady Raya fell
and there's blood everywhere.

218
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,640
Blood? From a miscarriage?

219
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,360
What took you so long Chuan?
Bring the water.

220
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,520
Yes.

221
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,560
Hurry.

222
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,920
My Lord.

223
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,840
Did Lady Raya miscarry?

224
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,920
Why would you say that? Shut your mouth!

225
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,640
Please. I wish Lady Raya is bleeding
from a miscarriage.

226
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,760
Done!

227
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,760
Thong. Hot water is ready.

228
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,800
Mark my words.
If you tell anyone, you're dead.

229
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,600
Yes.

230
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,680
Open the door.

231
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,840
How's Raya doing?

232
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,080
Give me a break.

233
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,640
Hows Raya?

234
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,200
Well she's… Prik tried some herbs

235
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,240
to stop the bleeding My Lord.

236
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,960
That means she's actually bleeding?

237
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,200
Stay out of this.

238
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,200
Prik. How is my wife and the baby?

239
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,280
Lady Raya is safe.

240
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,600
But the baby…

241
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,040
…has died

242
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,920
from a miscarriage.

243
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,200
When Lady Raya heard about Im's pregnancy

244
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,800
she stressed out

245
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,400
and kept crying all night long.

246
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,960
She was weak and fell down the stairs.

247
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,240
But I think

248
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,160
Im's baby might be something
called a "jealous child"

249
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,000
preventing Lady Raya's childbirth.

250
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,480
What the hell are you saying? Get out!

251
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,040
Please forgive me My Lord.

252
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,600
I just don't want you to be sad.

253
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,960
I lost my unborn child.
How could I not be sad?

254
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,160
Go away!

255
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,440
Get out!

256
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,800
Please forgive me My Lord.

257
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,359
I didn't mean to upset you.

258
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,880
I told you to leave!

259
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,480
Go!

260
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,560
I'm such a terrible person.
I killed my own child.

261
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,080
My Lord.

262
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,720
Please don't blame yourself.

263
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,840
It was not your fault.

264
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,600
It's Im.

265
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,160
If Im wasn't here,

266
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,960
Lady Raya would feel much better.

267
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,160
Thong.

268
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,600
Why would you blame Im like that?

269
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,320
Isn't it true?

270
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,800
If it wasn't for her,

271
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,480
Lady Raya wouldn't have anything
to be upset about.

272
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,880
But she fell down

273
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,000
and bled out, leading to a miscarry.

274
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,520
Please don't blame yourself, My Lord.

275
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,800
Im is the one to blame.

276
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,360
Only her alone.

277
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,160
My Lord.

278
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,320
The physician is here.
Can I bring him in now?

279
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,600
It's too late. I already lost my child!

280
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,280
I feel really bad for Lady Raya.

281
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,000
She lost her child.

282
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,360
But It wasn't Im's fault.
It's because of Luang Wisut.

283
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,080
He didn't even take the blame for her.

284
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,960
He just let Thong babble
about how wrong Im was.

285
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,560
He might be too upset to think straight.

286
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,320
No.

287
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,200
It's because he is a heartless man.

288
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,720
He's never thought of anyone's feelings
so things turn out like this.

289
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,120
Chuan. That's enough.

290
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,040
He is going through a lot right now.

291
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,400
Good.

292
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,160
He has to deal with this pain

293
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,480
to be aware of what hurts others,

294
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,120
especially his own wife.

295
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,680
Raya.

296
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,160
Dear. Our child.

297
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,680
Our child is gone.

298
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,720
Raya.

299
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,880
I'm sorry.

300
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,760
It's all my fault we lost our child.

301
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,240
I deserve to die.

302
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,240
Don't blame yourself Dear.

303
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,720
It's me. I wasn't being careful.

304
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,280
It's me who deserve to die.

305
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,880
Not at all Raya. It's me.

306
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,360
I should be dead.

307
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,880
Don't say that.

308
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,120
I deserve it more.

309
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,880
There's no point in me living now.

310
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,320
But you…

311
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,920
You can still have your child
with other women.

312
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,320
No. I will have no more.

313
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,560
I will not hurt you anymore.

314
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,440
But you're having a child with Im.

315
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,440
Will you be able to leave her?

316
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,200
Your silence…

317
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,560
…means you still think of her
and the child.

318
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,120
Fine.

319
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,160
If it makes you happy,

320
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,320
I will bear with it

321
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,080
even if it hurts to death.

322
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,000
I will help you raise the child
and care for Im.

323
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,880
If you're pregnant, avoid anything sweet.

324
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,600
Physicians said

325
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,960
sweets are not good for pregnancy.

326
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,280
If any diseases occur from eating sweets,
it could mean death.

327
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,640
I heard you have morning sickness
and crave sweets,

328
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,480
so I brought them for you.

329
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,360
Thank you Lady Raya.

330
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,080
The child of you and Luang Wisut

331
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,480
is like my child.

332
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,280
Don't forget

333
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,120
to press her some sugarcane juices.

334
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,440
Eating well can cure morning sickness.

335
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,120
Yes Lady Raya.

336
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,960
I'm really happy for you.

337
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,840
Take good care of your child.

338
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,800
At least to fulfill…

339
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,200
…what I couldn't fulfill.

340
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,160
Why the long face Im?

341
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,680
Smile more and eat well

342
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,400
for Lady Raya.

343
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,200
Yes Grandma.

344
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,520
I'll bring you more sweets

345
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,440
as Lady Raya orders.

346
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,440
Im. Is it really possible

347
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,360
that your child is the "jealous child"?

348
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,560
After Lady Raya's miscarriage,

349
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,240
you're now well-pampered.

350
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,360
Plus,

351
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,640
Lady Raya is kind to you and your baby.

352
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,160
Stop speaking nonsense!

353
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,480
I agree.

354
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,040
She's looking upset already.

355
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,200
I'm sorry.

356
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,840
But what Tuan said is somewhat true.

357
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,400
After the incident, your baby's more calm.

358
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,440
If you eat and sleep well enough,

359
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,520
the baby will surely
be healthy and lovely.

360
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,960
Now that Lady Raya is childless,

361
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,840
I fear Luang Wisut will demand your baby.

362
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,200
No Aunty.

363
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,960
This is my child,

364
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,480
not his.

365
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,160
Ying! I already told you

366
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,320
to accept the truth as it is.

367
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,640
Do you think Luang Wisut is blind

368
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,480
and doesn't know whose child it is
inside her womb?

369
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,360
Bun.

370
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,600
How is Im doing?

371
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,360
She's doing fine My Lord.

372
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,400
I mean, Is she still being nauseous?

373
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,600
It's gone My Lord.

374
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,760
Im is now well-fed and relaxed.
She's perfectly healthy.

375
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,520
So my child is healthy as well.

376
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,520
I am a bad father.

377
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,000
Too busy to care for them.

378
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,960
But Lady Raya always visits

379
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,440
and provides food and nourishment for her.

380
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,480
Then Lady Raya wouldn't mind

381
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,360
if I bring Im in.

382
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,960
Are you here to visit Im?

383
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,920
Raya.

384
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,520
Please answer me.

385
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,040
You couldn't sleep…

386
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,440
…because you think of Im and her child.

387
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,080
After what happened to me,

388
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,360
all you care about is Im.

389
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,440
How could you do this to me?

390
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,600
Raya.

391
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,680
It's not like that at all.

392
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,080
I'm not missing Im

393
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,760
but I'm worried about the baby.

394
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,640
But you promised me.

395
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,120
But I wanted a child.

396
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,840
So I need to see how it's doing.

397
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,040
If I had a chance be near my child,

398
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,560
I wouldn't be this desperate.

399
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,400
Given that you are always

400
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,160
taking care of Im for me,

401
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,080
can I bring her in

402
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,960
to stay with us?

403
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,360
Please.

404
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,200
Dear.

405
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,120
Raya.

406
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,720
Lady Raya.

407
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,720
Please don't cry.

408
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,800
Chuan.

409
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,680
Did you hear us?

410
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,320
I'm sorry My Lady.
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

411
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,200
Anyway,

412
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,360
you must have seen it all.

413
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,040
You must think…

414
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,360
…I'm such a pitiful wife.

415
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,040
Not at all Lady Raya.

416
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,360
In my eyes, you're an angel

417
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,360
who shines her mercy on us all.

418
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,400
Angel? Merciful?

419
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,360
Even with all of that,

420
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,600
Luang Wisut would still
break my heart to pieces.

421
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,680
So you've heard

422
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,120
that he wants Im to stay under our roof.

423
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,360
I have nothing against her.

424
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,640
But it will hurt so much

425
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,440
when I see her baby
growing bigger and bigger

426
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,920
while my baby

427
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,480
is not with me anymore.

428
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,640
No…

429
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,920
Lady Raya. Please don't cry.

430
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,880
I firmly believe that in no time,

431
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,720
some fortunate souls

432
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,280
will eventually be born as your child.

433
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,880
When that time comes,
Luang Wisut will love

434
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,440
and cherish your child the most My Lady.

435
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,520
Please.

436
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,360
I know you're upset about last night.

437
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,120
But I can give you my word

438
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,600
that

439
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,560
after the baby is born,

440
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,840
Im will be moved back to her place.

441
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,160
You can do anything you see fit

442
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,160
since I cannot trust any of your words.

443
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,440
Raya.

444
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,800
I really need this.

445
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,400
After this, I'll ask no more.

446
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,320
It seems one-sided.

447
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,320
You've never listened to what I asked.

448
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,000
Then, what is it that you want?

449
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,240
You can tell me. I will give you anything.

450
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,640
Are you sure

451
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,600
you can give me anything?

452
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,360
I'm sure.

453
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,760
I don't want to
tolerate Im's or her child's presence.

454
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,000
If you're to honor your word,

455
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,920
don't ever bring her and the child
to stay here with us.

456
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,480
It looks like Luang Wisut
is still trying to have Im.

457
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,480
If he's still trying,
then I won't back down.

458
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,240
She and the baby are so stubborn,

459
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,120
the sweets didn't harm them.

460
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,600
Sweets will take time to show any effect.

461
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,040
But we have other choices, My Lady.

462
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,880
Yes.

463
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,160
Luang Wisut will be out of town
attending business in a few days.

464
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,160
I will use this chance
to make Thongkliao get rid of Im.

465
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,360
Raya.

466
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,240
I'll be working for a few days.

467
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,280
Please eat well and sufficiently.

468
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,080
If not, you could become weak and ill.

469
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,560
I told you

470
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,360
I lost my appetite.

471
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,320
Please don't worry.

472
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,760
I will reconsider it.

473
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,400
My Lord.

474
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,320
Where are you going? Please wait for me.

475
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,520
Please bring me with you.

476
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,800
My Lord!

477
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,080
My Lord!

478
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,239
Haven't you realized

479
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,880
how much he despises you right now?

480
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,440
Shut your mouth or I'll shut it for you.

481
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:34,239
Thongkliao. Don't blame her.

482
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,760
What she said is right.

483
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,960
It's not only you he's lost interest in,

484
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,120
but I myself, also fall victim.

485
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,639
Raya. Please wait for me.

486
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,400
What did you mean by that?

487
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,000
I wonder Chuan.

488
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,720
What did Lady Raya mean by that?

489
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,920
So, a couple nights ago,

490
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,360
I heard Luang Wisut tell her

491
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,120
he wants to bring Im and her child in.

492
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,960
I cannot believe

493
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,120
that Im would dare betray me like this

494
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,200
despite promising she would avoid him.

495
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,520
You can trust no one with that.

496
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,240
You know how being his wife
changed your well-being.

497
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,800
Im might want to have a happy life
just like yours.

498
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,760
Now that she has a child,
she won't wait to take her chance.

499
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,560
What chance My Lady?

500
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,800
She told Luang Wisut

501
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,840
she wants to stay in this house
like both of us.

502
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,240
Is that true?

503
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,000
She also wants to have him all by herself.

504
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,600
Devious bitch.

505
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,640
Then, what did Luang Wisut said?

506
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,040
You already know he really wants a child.

507
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,280
There's no way he could refuse that.

508
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,800
That means…

509
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,880
Yes.

510
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,600
He will bring Im in to stay in this house.

511
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,280
And the child, whether a boy or a girl,

512
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,680
will become his heir.

513
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,120
Worse, she asked him to banish us

514
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,760
to the slave house.

515
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,920
Im. That bitch. This is too much.

516
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,480
I won't allow that.

517
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,160
There's nothing more I could do

518
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,200
if it is something Luang Wisut wants.

519
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,160
Unless, the child is no more.

520
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,040
Yes My Lady.

521
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,120
The only way we can ensure

522
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,880
she will stay in her place

523
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,360
is to get rid of her baby.

524
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,680
Bun. Let's go home.

525
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,600
My Lord?

526
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,200
I don't want to go.
I worry about my wife and child.

527
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,400
Yes Sir.

528
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,120
I feel bad for Lady Raya.

529
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,000
It was all Thongkliao's fault.

530
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,200
If she hadn't told Lady Raya,

531
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,200
these things wouldn't be happening.

532
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,680
Who said it's my fault?

533
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,160
It's Im's fault.

534
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,920
I don't want to have
this conversation anymore.

535
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,760
I told you so many times I was violated.

536
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,320
Violated? And what were you doing
with your mouth?

537
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,800
Why didn't you scream?

538
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,160
Or you just kept moaning?

539
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,080
Bitch!

540
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,160
-Thongkliao!
-Come here!

541
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,080
Let me go!

542
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,240
Do you want to come sit with Im sometimes?

543
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,760
I'm so afraid

544
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,360
I'll end up like Im.

545
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,720
If it were to happen,

546
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,520
I'll be ready to give my life.

547
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,680
Im.

548
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,920
You will feel the pain I experienced
right before you bleed and die.

549
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,400
You've been violated

550
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,360
so you shouldn't want to keep the baby.

551
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,640
Let me get rid of it.

552
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,200
Today.

553
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,640
You'll be flogged to death!

554
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,960
Why would you still care?

555
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,120
