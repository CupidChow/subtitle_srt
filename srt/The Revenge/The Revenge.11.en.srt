1
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,000
Here comes the Lord.

2
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,000
I picked them for you.

3
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,520
Thank you Lady Raya.

4
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,200
I know you like them.

5
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,840
You have to let go.

6
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,840
Seeing you cry like this all the time,

7
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,920
Luang Wisut won't be happy.

8
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,040
You already know he deeply loves
and cares for you.

9
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,560
I know my Lady.

10
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,280
But I just cannot understand people.

11
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,280
Lady Raya.

12
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,040
After all the things Im has done to me,

13
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,920
Bun keeps taking her side.

14
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,080
You already know
they have feelings for each other.

15
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,240
To be honest, everyone can see

16
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,960
that Im has feelings for him.

17
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,640
Lady Raya.

18
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,960
I really hurt inside.

19
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,720
My heart is in so much pain.

20
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,400
Don't speak like that.

21
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,560
If Luang Wisut hears this,

22
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,440
he'll be upset
that you still haven't forgotten Bun.

23
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,000
I can't bear it.

24
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,360
I can't bear the fact
that Bun and Im are together.

25
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,520
But you have to be strong,
because now you are the Lord's wife.

26
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,200
You have to love and be loyal
to none other than him.

27
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,040
Yes Lady Raya.

28
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,240
I will get over Bun.

29
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,360
Oh Chuan.

30
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,600
Listen.

31
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,480
Do you know that every time I see you cry,

32
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,880
my heart is shattered into pieces?

33
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,240
I'm sorry for violating you.

34
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,720
But I want you to know

35
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,960
that I love you the most.

36
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,840
I really love you.

37
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,760
Are you telling the truth my Lord?

38
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,720
It's true.

39
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,360
Then from now on,

40
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,560
don't have anyone else other than us.

41
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,440
And don't make Lady Raya upset.

42
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,920
Yes Chuan.

43
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,360
I promise

44
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,920
that I won't have anyone else.

45
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,200
But it's not for Raya.

46
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,160
I'll do this

47
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,160
because I love you the most.

48
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,440
I'll do everything

49
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,920
to hurt you like you did to me, Im.

50
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,240
-Where's Luang Wisut?
-With Chuan, in his room my Lady.

51
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,840
It seems the Lord

52
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,000
is so in love and protective of her.

53
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,360
Im lost face when she realized this.
That serves her right.

54
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,400
It seems Luang Wisut
is still jealous of Bun.

55
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,280
In no time, he'll become irrelevant.

56
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,720
So the coast is clear for us.

57
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,800
After that, it'll be your chance

58
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,000
to enact the plan to get rid of Chuan.

59
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,440
When those two are no more,

60
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,840
my Lady Raya will be the one

61
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,080
and only one standing.

62
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,440
Aren't you happy my Lady?

63
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,159
The more I think about it,
the more upset and hurt I am.

64
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,520
What a pity for me

65
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,679
to have to wait until they're all gone

66
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,280
so I can become the one and only.

67
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,480
I am the daughter
of the respected Chao Phraya.

68
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,280
And who the hell are they?

69
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,840
They are slaves who have nothing on me.

70
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,720
Still, he fell head over heels for them.

71
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,640
Do you realize?

72
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,440
Since I was born,

73
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,560
I've never felt as worthless as I do now.

74
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,520
Luang Wisut never has me on his mind.

75
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,640
Imagine if Chuan becomes pregnant someday.

76
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,000
Then how worthless will I be?

77
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,360
I wonder too my Lady.

78
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,280
Granted, Im is now having a child,

79
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,160
he wouldn't want to be far from her.

80
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,080
Now with another person

81
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,560
the Lord already favors, like Chuan,

82
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,600
he must be…

83
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,800
Oh. Just imagine it.

84
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,800
I already feel enraged for you my Lady.

85
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,360
It will be hard for you this time my Lady.

86
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,520
I won't give up.

87
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,640
No matter how eager to be born
their children are,

88
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,400
I'll do everything to prevent it.

89
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,200
Are you alright Chuan?

90
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,920
I'm not sure my Lord.

91
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,720
I'm feeling dizzy and nauseous.

92
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,360
Is it better now?

93
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,280
-I'll get cardiotonic herbs.
-Don't bother.

94
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,080
Then wash your face with some cold water.

95
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,320
It will be refreshing.

96
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,920
I'm all right my Lady.

97
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,760
I prefer some star gooseberries or madans.

98
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,920
I somehow crave sour food.

99
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,120
Are you pregnant?

100
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,400
Bun. I suspect Chuan is pregnant.

101
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,760
Go get the physician.

102
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
Yes.

103
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,520
Congratulations Luang Wisut.

104
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,560
Your wife is ten weeks pregnant.

105
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,840
Chuan. Did you hear that?

106
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,200
Did you hear that?

107
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,400
You are pregnant.

108
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,560
Am I becoming a mother my Lord?

109
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,080
Yes. You're going to be a mother.

110
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,400
We're having a child together.
I'm so happy.

111
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,240
Why are all of them pregnant? Why can't I?

112
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,120
-Why?!
-Please calm down my Lady.

113
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
They can also miscarry!

114
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,400
Yes! They can definitely miscarry.

115
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,280
Not only their child,

116
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,280
I'll make sure they're all dead.

117
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,000
Get some sweets for Chuan.

118
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,200
And plant this in her food.

119
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
My Lady.

120
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,080
Chuan. If sweets don't work,

121
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,520
then you'll die by poison.

122
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,000
Forgive me my Lord.

123
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,720
I couldn't eat sour food today.

124
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,000
It's all right. Then what are you craving?

125
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,480
Banana blossom in vegetable soup.

126
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,480
I'll have someone prepare it for you.

127
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,040
No my Lord. I can make it myself.

128
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,920
Chuan, you're pregnant.
It will be hard to move around.

129
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,280
I'll make it for you.

130
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,920
Please don't Lady Raya.

131
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,440
I'll make it. I want to have it too.

132
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,800
Don't.

133
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,120
I'm disgusted to have anything from you.

134
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,400
Chuan. Im is kind enough
to offer her help.

135
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,640
Let her do it.

136
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,640
No my Lady.

137
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,080
Why Chuan? Im is happy to do it.

138
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,480
If she poisons my food,

139
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,600
what would you do my Lord?

140
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,640
You are thinking too much.

141
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,000
And Im wants to eat it too.

142
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,320
Im. Go ahead and make it
so you can have it with her.

143
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,680
Yes my Lord.

144
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,840
So stubborn.

145
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,240
Stop acting kind Im!

146
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,000
I know you'll poison my food.

147
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,840
Stop being stupid Chuan.

148
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,920
We have been friends since childhood.

149
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,680
Do you really think I'd be that cruel?

150
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,080
From the moment you took Bun from me,

151
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,960
you were no longer my friend.

152
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,360
Chuan. I didn't take Bun from you.

153
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,720
Chuan. Wait.

154
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,320
Go have a fight.

155
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,720
You'll all be dead for sure this time.

156
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,600
Chuan, listen to me.

157
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,160
Chuan. Listen for once!

158
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,760
Believe me. I didn't sleep with Bun.

159
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,800
Prostate at my feet, and I'll believe it.

160
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,960
Sure. But you'll also have to believe

161
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,440
that Lady Raya is not kind.

162
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,560
Lady Raya wants you to keep watch.

163
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,840
The Lord is not there.

164
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,720
No need to worry. Nothing will happen.

165
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,280
A few days ago,

166
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,960
Im asked for my advice
on Luang Wisut's request

167
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,040
to have her talk you

168
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,240
into becoming his wife.

169
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,320
If she won't do it,
he'll demote her and the child

170
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,840
back to being slaves.

171
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,760
Ouch. Chuan!

172
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,120
Why did you step on my hands?

173
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,320
I don't believe you.
Being shameless enough to be at my feet,

174
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,480
there's nothing you couldn't do!

175
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,360
You're disgusting Im!

176
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,280
Chuan!

177
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,840
Why can't you listen to me?

178
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,640
Is it done Thong?

179
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,120
Yes my Lady. I poured it all in.

180
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,000
Good. Where are they now?

181
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,880
They're fighting somewhere.

182
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,480
Let them fight.

183
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,440
Im will have to get the pot
and they will all be dead!

184
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,280
Let's go back inside.

185
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,840
Yes my Lady.

186
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,160
Raya, you bitch!

187
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,360
-I'll kill you!
-Thongkliao!

188
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,240
-Thongkliao! Don't!
-I'll kill you!

189
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,840
-You snake!
-Thongkliao!

190
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,520
-Calm down.
-Get off of me!

191
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,720
-Don't do this!
-You evil bitch!

192
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,400
What is this?!

193
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,839
-Don't.
-You despicable, worthless bitch!

194
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,240
I'll kill you bitch.

195
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,079
-I will kill you!
-Please help me Dear.

196
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,920
-Thongkliao will kill me.
-Let go.

197
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,640
-I'll kill you!
-Stop it! Thongkliao!

198
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,560
Lock her up somewhere.

199
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,960
-Hurry.
-Raya, you evil bitch.

200
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,040
-Take her away!
-Raya, you bitch!

201
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,839
-Raya!
-Are you hurt?

202
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,080
I'm in shock Dear.

203
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,400
What did she do

204
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,320
to deserve being mental like this?

205
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,640
Dear, what can we do to help her?

206
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,920
Perhaps it's best to let her be like this
on her own.

207
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,720
Poor thing.

208
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,800
But Dear, the soup spilled out
almost entirely.

209
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,560
Should we make a new one?

210
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,680
It's too late now Raya.

211
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,240
Chuan is pregnant. She has to eat now.

212
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,760
Im. Bring what's left of it.

213
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,560
This won't be enough.

214
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,720
I agree. Too bad Chuan really wants it.

215
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,360
It's all right my Lady. This will do.

216
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,880
But Im wants it too.

217
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,480
Can you share some with her Chuan?

218
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,920
She'll give birth soon. Let's pamper her.

219
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,440
It's all right my Lady. Let Chuan have it.

220
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,200
Good. I'll eat it all up.

221
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,400
How is it Chuan?

222
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,640
It tastes…

223
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,320
…somewhat strange. A little bitter.

224
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
What is it Chuan?

225
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,160
My stomach hurts so much my Lord.

226
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,480
Chuan.

227
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,640
Blood!

228
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,080
Blood!

229
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,280
Anyone! Go get the physician!

230
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,920
Get the physician now!

231
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,640
Who's hurting Dear?

232
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,880
It's Chuan. Her stomach hurts
and now she's bleeding.

233
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,760
Bun.

234
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,040
What are you waiting for?
Go get the physician right now. Go!

235
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,320
-Yes.
-Quickly!

236
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,760
How's Chuan?

237
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,240
She is safe. But…

238
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,720
But what?

239
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,880
…we've lost the baby.

240
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,520
Chuan.

241
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,800
Are you awake?

242
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,280
It hurts my Lord.

243
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,200
What happened to me?

244
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,000
You're fine Chuan.

245
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,600
Keep lying down.

246
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,560
Have some more rest.

247
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,320
No.

248
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,080
No my Lord.

249
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,160
What happened to me my Lord?

250
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,600
What happened?

251
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,320
Wait.

252
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,720
The baby.

253
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,080
How's the baby?

254
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,280
How's the baby my Lord?

255
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,360
My Lord. Answer me.

256
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,840
What happened to my baby?

257
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,520
Is my baby still here my Lord?

258
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,920
What really happened?

259
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,160
-Chuan. Please calm down.
-What about my child?

260
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,480
Listen to me carefully.

261
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,560
Our child…

262
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,360
…is not with us anymore.

263
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,240
-No.
-Chuan.

264
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,160
It's not true is it?

265
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,920
It's not true.

266
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,040
We can have another one.

267
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,080
How did this happen?

268
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,520
Chuan.

269
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,160
My baby.

270
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,960
It's not true.

271
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,640
Lady Raya.

272
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,680
Lady Raya.

273
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,600
Chuan.

274
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,360
What happened to you?

275
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,640
Lady Raya.

276
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,240
My baby is no more.

277
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,960
My baby is not with us anymore.

278
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,640
What happened Dear?

279
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,400
Chuan miscarried.

280
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,480
How did this happen?

281
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,800
I really don't know.

282
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,000
But the physician said

283
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,600
she might have food poisoning.

284
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,920
Could it be…?

285
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,560
What Thong?

286
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,080
The soup that Im cooked.

287
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,720
What do you mean Thong?

288
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,840
Um.

289
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,560
Maybe Im put something in the soup.

290
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,680
That's true.

291
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,920
Im!

292
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,960
Chuan!

293
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,520
Don't you worry.

294
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,840
I love Chuan with all my heart.

295
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,320
I'll do everything for Chuan.

296
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,400
Just as I thought.

297
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,280
-Im! You bitch!
-Chuan.

298
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,680
-Chuan.
-You're dead!

299
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,040
-Why did you do this?
-Chuan!

300
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,040
That bitch made me miscarry!

301
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,600
I didn't do anything Chuan.

302
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,840
You did!

303
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,240
You put poisonous herbs in my soup.

304
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,480
You must be afraid

305
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,480
that my child
will end up better than yours.

306
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,480
Why must you go to such lengths
to keep being a thorn in my side.

307
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,800
-Die!
-Chuan!

308
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,360
-Chuan! Stop!
-Listen to me.

309
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,720
-Chuan. Listen.
-I said stop!

310
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,880
Chuan!

311
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,000
You bastard. You hurt her?

312
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,920
If she's injured, you're dead!

313
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,080
Please forgive me my Lord.
I didn't mean to.

314
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,080
You did. You wanted to protect Im

315
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,560
knowing that she almost killed Chuan.

316
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,640
I didn't do anything my Lady.

317
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,120
The physician said Chuan was poisoned.

318
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,640
And the last meal

319
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,680
that she had and then miscarried

320
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,400
was made by you.

321
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,920
I didn't put any poison in the food.

322
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,480
If it's not you, then who?

323
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,600
You're the one who prepared the soup.
You brought the soup.

324
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,080
It's fortunate

325
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,440
that Thongkliao
accidentally spilled most of it.

326
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,280
If not, Chuan would be dead.

327
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,480
I am certain.

328
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,160
There's no way
Im would hurt a friend like Chuan.

329
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,240
Why do you keep protecting her Bun?

330
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,040
I'm starting to suspect

331
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,720
there's something going on
between you two.

332
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,240
Or maybe that baby

333
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,240
is not mine after all.

334
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,840
-My Lord.
-My Lord.

335
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,960
Please. Im is your wife my Lord.

336
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,280
I swear on my life.

337
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,080
There's nothing going on between us.

338
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,680
If you don't believe me,
you can punish me to death.

339
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,200
So you love her so much
that you can give your life.

340
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,040
My Lord.

341
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,640
I've never thought of betraying you

342
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,320
even for a second my Lord.

343
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,320
Liar!

344
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,320
Then why did you poison Chuan's food?

345
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,280
You must be thinking
that I'll love her child more than yours.

346
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,960
You're a monster.

347
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,120
From this moment on, go away.

348
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,040
You're my wife no more!

349
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,560
My Lord.

350
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,800
Get out! Both of you!

351
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,800
I don't want to see your faces! Go!

352
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,120
It's you who hurt Chuan, isn't it?

353
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,840
Not just Chuan,

354
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,120
but your baby as well.

355
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,200
But somehow, both sweets
and poisonous herbs

356
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,200
couldn't stop it from growing.

357
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,640
-Lady Raya.
-Lady Raya.

358
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,080
I'll inform the Lord.

359
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,280
Try it.

360
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,440
I want to know

361
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,720
if he'll believe his wife or a slave more?

362
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,440
I want to laugh my head off.

363
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,640
Yes my Lady. Laugh out loud.

364
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,880
Why can't you die of old age?

365
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,800
-Try it.
-Stop.

366
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,720
-Want to die now?
-Don't.

367
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,640
Hurt any of my people,

368
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,640
and you two will die where you stand.

369
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,520
All my life, I've never seen anyone

370
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,960
as vile as you are.

371
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,040
Then see me clearly for the last time.

372
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,400
And know this.

373
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,520
There's no way
I will let your friend Chuan

374
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,560
be a thorn in my side for long.

375
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,480
In no time, both your friend

376
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,000
and your lover

377
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,360
will go back to being slaves.

378
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,680
When that moment arrives,
just go ahead and die together.

379
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,480
Thong. Let's go.

380
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,960
Bun.

381
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,800
My child

382
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,840
won't have a father anymore.

383
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,240
Don't cry Im.

384
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,560
Even if the Lord cut ties with your child,

385
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,920
I'll be the father.

386
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,480
Bun.

387
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,400
What you did is right Chuan.

388
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,600
I heard the slaves talking

389
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,240
about how Bun and Im are now together.

390
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,480
Plus, Im's child

391
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,440
has been adopted by Bun.

392
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,760
They are now happy together

393
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,760
and inseparable from each other.

394
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,880
He's so protective of her.

395
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,400
That's true my Lady.

396
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,920
I suspect that Bun

397
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,400
had feelings for Im for a while.

398
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,080
When he had the chance, he grabbed it.

399
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,120
You're lucky
you're not married to him now.

400
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,600
If so, you would surely

401
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,320
be cheated on by them.

402
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,080
Don't you believe me?

403
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,400
I believe it my Lady.

404
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,560
I know

405
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,880
it is hard for anyone
who is going through this.

406
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,080
Your friend

407
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,760
and your lover both betrayed you.

408
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,680
But you have to get over it Chuan.

409
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,720
Chuan,

410
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,920
you have to see what they did to you
with your own eyes.

411
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
If not, you will never overcome this.

412
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,400
You will never forget about them
in this life.

413
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,080
Wait.

414
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,320
Don't Im. I'll do it.

415
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,120
You are late with your pregnancy.

416
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,840
You should relax.

417
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,040
I relaxed too much. I didn't do anything.

418
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,000
You don't let me move anymore.

419
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,240
I just worry for you.

420
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,520
Sit here, I'll do it.

421
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,760
Yes.

422
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,640
And I prepared food for you.

423
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,360
Don't forget to have it.

424
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,320
So the child will be healthy.

425
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,920
Yes.

426
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,800
I think Bun
really cares about you and your child.

427
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,480
He's so kind to me.

428
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,160
That's good.

429
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,880
You don't have to worry.

430
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,640
If you can't be with the Lord,

431
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,720
having a good man like Bun
to take care of you

432
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,720
is not half bad I think.

433
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,680
No Tuan.

434
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,960
Bun just feels bad for me.

435
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,160
In his heart,

436
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,760
he still has only Chuan.

437
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,480
I think Bun

438
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,880
really cares about you and your child.

439
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,880
I must have a child with the Lord.

440
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,520
My child will be better

441
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,280
and greater than yours Im.

442
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,440
Bun! Is the water ready?!

443
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,960
Almost ready.

444
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,200
Now, Im.

445
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,760
Hurry up.

446
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,200
Im is about to give birth! Stir the fire!

447
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,840
Yes.

448
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,720
Im.

449
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,760
What? Im is in labor?

450
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,000
Yes.

451
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,680
I saw Bun
went to get a midwife earlier today.

452
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,920
It seems he's excited to have a child.

453
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,960
So is Im.

454
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,000
Don't you want to go see them Dear?

455
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,240
Why should I go see that devious lot?

456
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,760
What about you Chuan?

457
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,920
I won't go my Lady.

458
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,800
Well.

459
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,360
She's giving birth to her first child.

460
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,760
I don't know if it will go smoothly.

461
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,880
I'll go see them.

462
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,200
It's none of our business.

463
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,000
How is it not our business?

464
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,880
The child being born is your child Dear.

465
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,400
It's not my child.

466
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,440
If you say so.

467
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,480
I'm worried for them anyway.

468
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,679
I'll go take a look.

469
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,920
Leave it here and wait outside.

470
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
But I'm worried.

471
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:39,120
Yes. I know you are.
You act like this is your child.

472
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,960
But this is my child.

473
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,480
Right. Now get out.

474
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,679
-It's hot.
-Almost Im.

475
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,360
I wish for the sacred beings of this world
to protect Im and the child.

476
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,760
With you being this excited,
I starting to believe

477
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,880
you're the real father of her child.

478
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,680
Forgive me my Lady.

479
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,480
What is your business here?

480
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,200
I'm here to remind you

481
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,480
that the child is yours.

482
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,200
Raise it well

483
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,560
and don't ever
let it claim to be Luang Wisut's child.

484
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,680
Unless you want it dead.

485
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,680
Bun! The baby is here!

486
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,880
Both mother and baby are safe.

487
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,760
Bun. It's a girl.

488
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,960
Bun.

489
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,840
I have a daughter.

490
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,360
She's not just yours.

491
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,120
She's my daughter as well.

492
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,880
My child.

493
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,520
How cute you are.

494
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,000
Look at her.

495
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,200
Our child is so adorable.

496
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,800
Yes.

497
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,760
Our child is adorable.

498
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,480
So what shall be her name?

499
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,240
She's the apple of my eye.

500
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,000
So I'll name her

501
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
Kaeota.

502
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,240
Good. That's a good name.

503
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,360
Kaeota.

504
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,920
Kaeota. My girl.

505
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,000
Kaeota. My girl.

506
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,960
Why are you crying Im?

507
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,320
I'm overwhelmed with joy Bun,

508
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,080
that my child has a father.

509
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,280
I'm so grateful for you

510
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,680
that you help me with everything.

511
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,600
Don't thank me Im.

512
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,200
You and the child
helped me forget about our hardships.

513
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,560
If you don't mind,

514
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,080
I'll be the one who will always

515
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,240
take care of you and our child.

516
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,440
Thank you Bun.

517
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,920
Is Chuan pregnant?

518
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,400
It's possible my Lord.

519
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,560
I haven't bled in three months.

520
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,440
They keep having children. But not me.

521
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,480
If I can't have children,

522
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,440
then neither can Chuan.

523
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,760
Chuan. You're dead.

524
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,520
NEXT EPISODE

525
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,840
Chuan. Don't.

526
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,000
If I had Luang Wisut as a son-in-law,

527
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,880
I would be so proud.

528
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,440
It's me who'll make you proud.

529
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,800
You have to be responsible.

530
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,080
Marry Pring.

531
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,760
Who is this Dear?

532
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,600
My name is Pring,

533
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,480
Luang Wisut's wife.
