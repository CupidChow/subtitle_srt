1
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,280
Lady Raya. No. That's not it.

2
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,360
Everyone said that to me.

3
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,840
But when they became the Lord's wife,
they were happy.

4
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,640
But not me.

5
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,800
I love and respect you more than my life.

6
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,520
I swear

7
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,960
that I'll never hurt you.

8
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,000
I believe you.

9
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,400
And I don't hate you.

10
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,800
It's even better that someone
will help take care of the Lord.

11
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,000
Lady Raya.

12
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,680
I don't love the Lord. I love Bun.

13
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,240
Please help me.
I don't want to be the Lord's wife.

14
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,680
I beg you.

15
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,840
Please help me.

16
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,920
Please help me.

17
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,680
Are you that scared?

18
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,520
Alright. I'll help you.

19
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,960
Thank you my Lady.

20
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,680
I'll never forget

21
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,720
your mercy.

22
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,200
Thank you very much.

23
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,880
No. I get everything I want.

24
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,800
But Chuan is a human, not a thing.

25
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,320
We can't force her.

26
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,200
Yes, she is a human, not a thing.

27
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,520
But she is a slave and I own her life.

28
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,120
Raya, tell me.

29
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,560
You are not willing to help me right?

30
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,400
You are not willing to let Chuan
be my other wife right?

31
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,160
Why would I be willing to do that?

32
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,720
I am a human. I have feelings.

33
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,280
It hurts me. It pains me.

34
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,600
No woman in the world

35
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,360
would want her husband to have mistresses,

36
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,480
especially when that mistress
is a person that we adore.

37
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,720
If you really adore her,
you should be happy

38
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,080
that she'll have a comfortable life

39
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,880
and she's fortunate to be my wife.

40
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,080
But Chuan doesn't love you.
You should let her go.

41
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,960
But I love her.

42
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,920
I've loved her for a long time.

43
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,840
I can't stand seeing her be Bun's wife.

44
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,080
You're kidding me, right?

45
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,080
How am I kidding?

46
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,320
I really love Chuan.

47
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,760
-But Chuan…
-I don't care

48
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,880
that she loves Bun.

49
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,760
I want her to be mine.

50
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,680
You have to help me.

51
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,880
What do you want me to do?

52
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,680
You have to convince your friend

53
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,720
to be my wife.

54
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,320
Otherwise,

55
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll send you and the baby

56
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,560
back to the slave house.

57
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,000
Think about it.

58
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,600
Do you want your child
to be born as a slave or a master?

59
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,280
That's why the Lord doesn't talk to me.

60
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,280
What should I do Father, Mother?

61
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,640
I don't want to be his wife.

62
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,840
Then tonight,
you should both run away together.

63
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,160
You can't do that.

64
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,920
If they run away and the Lord finds out,
he will be angry.

65
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,840
And when the time comes,
he will send people to hunt them

66
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,840
and someone will die.
There's also a chance

67
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,800
that you and I will also be in trouble.

68
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,560
Then, what should we do?

69
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,360
Then let's do this.

70
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,200
I'll tell the Lord that we're going
to visit relatives in the provinces,

71
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,520
all of us.

72
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,480
And let's think about what's next later.

73
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,120
Both of you can go to visit relatives
wherever you want.

74
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,480
-But leave Chuan here.
-But--

75
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,640
There's no but.

76
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,760
My words are absolute.

77
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,280
Bun, you don't have to go with me today.

78
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,080
Give Mi and Som a ride.

79
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,880
And you might as well check my land
in Suphanburi for me.

80
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,720
Yes my Lord.

81
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,320
Im, the task that I told you, hurry up.

82
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,960
Im, what did the Lord order you to do?

83
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,640
Nothing.

84
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,520
I also didn't expect

85
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,960
that the Lord would love Chuan this much.

86
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,040
What should we do Lady Raya?

87
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,120
Chuan wouldn't agree
to be the Lord's wife.

88
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,560
If she doesn't,

89
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,960
you and your child
have to go back to being slaves.

90
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,680
I was born a slave.

91
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,440
Going back to being a slave

92
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,480
is not a problem for me.

93
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,520
Do you mean

94
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,720
you'd let your child be a slave?

95
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,280
I don't want my child to struggle.

96
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,800
But Chuan is my best friend.

97
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,920
And she begged me.

98
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,400
I can't do it.

99
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,320
You're doing the right thing Im.

100
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
But I'm scared of the Lord.

101
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,520
Don't be scared.

102
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,120
If we both refuse,

103
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,000
he'll find a way to talk to Chuan.

104
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,920
When that time comes,

105
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,800
it's up to Chuan.

106
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,240
But don't say anything yet

107
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,520
because Chuan is already terrified.

108
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,080
Yes my Lady.

109
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,840
The Lord knows what we're going to do.

110
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,960
He blocked It all.

111
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,560
I'm really worried about you Chuan.

112
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,360
Can you not go?

113
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,080
I didn't want to go.

114
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,680
But we already asked and he allowed it.

115
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,800
If we don't go, we would be

116
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,240
talking out both sides of our mouths.

117
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,280
Maybe, if we disobey his order,
we'll all be in trouble.

118
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,760
You have to be careful.
Stick with Lady Raya and Im.

119
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,120
Don't let him hurt you.

120
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,480
I'll be back in no time.

121
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,760
Alright.

122
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,200
Hold this.

123
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,400
What's the matter?

124
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,960
Why are you waiting for me here today?

125
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,080
I've already handled Chuan for you.

126
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,800
But you have to make an oath first.

127
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,520
If you break it, you'll die.

128
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,400
Raya.

129
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,120
What oath? That's very childish.

130
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,200
No. You have to make an oath first.

131
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,240
Ah.

132
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,600
Alright.

133
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,120
I swear if Chuan is not my last one,
I'll suffer and die.

134
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,040
Are you satisfied now?

135
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,280
Then wait in my room tonight.
Chuan will be there.

136
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,040
You have to remember

137
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,240
that I do all of this because I love you.

138
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,880
I love you more than my life.

139
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,400
Where is Im?

140
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,240
Hm?

141
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,160
Oh, Im is coming.

142
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,080
My Lady, Im is coming.

143
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,120
Lady Raya.

144
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,280
Lady Raya.

145
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,560
What's wrong my Lady?

146
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,080
I think I have a fever.

147
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,040
The Lord hasn't come back yet.

148
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,000
I'll also be away tonight.

149
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,520
I have to go to my relative's funeral.

150
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,200
Im.

151
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,920
Please help me.
Please stay with Lady Raya.

152
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,800
Of course.

153
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,080
But you're pregnant.

154
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,160
It's alright.
Please go and ask Chuan to stay with me.

155
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,240
Go now.

156
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,480
Yes my Lady.

157
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,360
Thong. Mix this with water
and put it in Im's room.

158
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,920
She will sleep like a log tonight
and won't interrupt our plan.

159
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,480
Yes my Lady.

160
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,720
What? Lady Raya has a fever?

161
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,160
Yes, she looked bad. She was shivering.

162
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,520
Can you stay with her?

163
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,560
No, I'm scared.

164
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,600
Raya wants you to stay with her.

165
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,760
I said I'd stay with her
but she didn't agree.

166
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,880
The Lord is away. Don't be scared.
Nothing's going to happen.

167
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,320
Then I'll make some medicine first.

168
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,760
Hurry up.

169
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,920
Lady Raya, it's Chuan.

170
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,520
Lady Raya, please open the door for me.

171
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,200
Lady Raya,

172
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,680
I've made medicine for you.

173
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,640
Please get up and take the medicine.

174
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,520
Lady Raya.

175
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,440
Luang Wisut.

176
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,560
It's me. Chuan,

177
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,240
come here.

178
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,320
-My Lord, please let me go.
-Chuan,

179
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,720
-come here.
-Please don't.

180
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,680
-Chuan, come here.
-My Lord.

181
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,880
-I want you. Come on.
-My Lord.

182
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,680
No my Lord.

183
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,360
My Lord, please don't do this.

184
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,840
-My Lord.
-Chuan.

185
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,760
-I told you to come here.
-My Lord.

186
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,640
-My Lord.
-Chuan.

187
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,440
-Chuan, where are you going?
-Please, I beg you.

188
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,680
-My Lord.
-Stay still.

189
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,320
My Lord.

190
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,280
-No, let me go.
-Chuan.

191
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,560
-My Lord.
-Chuan,

192
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,000
-what's wrong? Can you stay still.
-My Lord.

193
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,960
I beg you. Please don't do this.

194
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,440
I promise I'll take better care of you
than any of the other wives.

195
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,920
-Come on. Be mine.
-No.

196
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,800
No, please.

197
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,600
Don't do this to me.

198
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,960
Chuan.

199
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,040
What's wrong with me?

200
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,600
What do I lack compared to Bun?

201
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,400
What's going on with you?

202
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,520
My Lord.

203
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,840
You are better than Bun.

204
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,960
But…

205
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,160
I don't want to hurt Lady Raya.

206
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,200
And more importantly,

207
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,160
I don't love you.

208
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,240
I love Bun.

209
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,160
But I love you.

210
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,280
-My Lord.
-Come here.

211
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:26,000
My Lord.

212
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,800
Don't do it.

213
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,960
Why are you crying?

214
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,760
Many women want to serve me.

215
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,320
I adore you.

216
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,360
You have to consider yourself fortunate.

217
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,000
It's karma.

218
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,720
I don't know what I've done in the past

219
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,800
that makes me end up like this.

220
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,680
Chuan.

221
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,160
Chuan.

222
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,360
Thong, I barely slept last night.

223
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,720
I'm so tired.

224
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,200
Chuan, what's wrong?

225
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,760
Lady Raya.

226
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,480
Lady Raya, I…

227
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,640
I…

228
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,240
Oh Chuan.

229
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,000
I was away for just a night.

230
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,720
How did this happen?

231
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,840
By the way,

232
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,400
why were you in the house
in the middle of the night?

233
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,040
Right?

234
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,480
You knew the Lord was targeting you.

235
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,560
Why did you go there?

236
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,600
It was Im.

237
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,360
Im told me

238
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,120
that you wanted me to stay with you
because you were sick.

239
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,800
Me?

240
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,440
Oh.

241
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,760
That's impossible.

242
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,520
Last night,
I went to Thong's relative's funeral.

243
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,560
And I wasn't sick at all.

244
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,440
But Im really told me so.

245
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,960
Or…

246
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,320
Or… or what my Lady?

247
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,760
What's the matter my Lady?

248
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,040
Please tell me.

249
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,880
I never thought

250
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,880
that Im would be that kind of person.

251
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,680
Please tell me my Lady.

252
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:26,960
Oh.

253
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,400
But if I say it,

254
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,520
will you believe me?

255
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,680
My Lady, please tell me.

256
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,200
Many days ago,

257
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,280
Im asked for my advice

258
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,440
about the Lord wanting her to convince you

259
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,920
to be his wife.

260
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,960
If she wouldn't do it,

261
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,360
the Lord would send her back
to the slave house.

262
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,160
Oh, that means

263
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,880
Im was afraid that she and her child
would become slaves.

264
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,560
So she tricked Chuan

265
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,760
to go meet with the Lord?

266
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,560
Oh my Buddha.

267
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,880
Oh.

268
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,560
I don't want to believe it.

269
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,080
Oh.

270
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,120
I just realized

271
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,920
when they say that we can do anything

272
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,800
just so our child
can live a comfortable life.

273
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,640
I can trade my life for that.

274
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,480
Don't let the Lord do anything to me.
I'm scared.

275
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,400
I promise.

276
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,720
About the thing that I told you, hurry up.

277
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,720
Im, what did the Lord order you to do?

278
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,160
Nothing.

279
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,000
Please don't do this to me.

280
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,240
Don't do this to me.

281
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,360
Im.

282
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,320
You betrayer.

283
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,680
Well Im,

284
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,920
while I'm away for work,

285
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,800
please take care of Chuan.

286
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,600
Why?

287
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,440
She may not accept it yet.

288
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,400
But please tell her

289
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,040
that I really love her.

290
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,760
You betrayer.

291
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,360
-What Chuan?
-Don't say anything. Today is

292
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,280
the day you'll die.

293
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,400
-How could you do this?
-What did I do?

294
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,800
Alright.

295
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,360
Everyone.

296
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,040
It's good that you're back.

297
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,120
What's wrong Tuan?

298
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,680
It's Chuan. I don't know what happened.

299
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,160
She beat Im so hard
that she almost miscarried.

300
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,800
Huh?

301
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,480
Let me go Chuan.

302
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,760
Die now.

303
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,000
Chuan.

304
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,360
-Let me go.
-How could you do this?

305
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,000
Good. Kill each other.

306
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,200
Stop.

307
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,560
-Stop.
-Let me go.

308
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,000
I won't stop. Let me go!

309
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,480
I'll kill her!

310
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,960
How did I betray you?

311
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,520
Why are you still talking?

312
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,640
-Die now.
-Stop.

313
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,880
Chuan, stop.

314
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,600
What happened? Why do you have to hurt Im?

315
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,360
She is pregnant.

316
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,000
Ah.

317
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,040
It's good that she's pregnant.

318
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,840
So the baby can come out now.

319
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,320
Chuan, hey.

320
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,120
Mom, why did you hit me?

321
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,920
So you can realize what you said.

322
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,240
That was still not enough.

323
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,920
Do you know what she did to me?

324
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,360
She tricked me

325
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,760
to meet with the Lord and he abused me.

326
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,840
Huh?

327
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,640
What did you say?

328
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,000
Don't act all innocent.

329
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,560
You tricked me to meet with the Lord.

330
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,800
So you don't have to go back
and be a slave again.

331
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,960
That's not true.
Lady Raya was sick last night

332
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,920
and asked me to call you.

333
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,320
That's not true.

334
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,600
Last night I went to a funeral with Thong.

335
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,600
How could I tell you that?

336
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,040
Lady Raya.

337
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,840
I tried to protect Chuan

338
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,040
but you betrayed her.

339
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,240
You must be afraid that the Lord will kick
you and your child out to be slaves.

340
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,920
That's why you did this shameless thing.

341
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,760
Im. You evil sister.

342
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,760
-That's not true Chuan.
-Chuan.

343
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,880
I didn't have that plan. I can swear.

344
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,840
Do you dare to swear

345
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,440
that what you told me was not true?

346
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,120
That the Lord would send you
and your child back to be slaves

347
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,040
if you don't let him have Chuan?

348
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,880
You don't dare to swear?

349
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,680
Im, you're evil.

350
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,320
From now on,

351
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,160
you and I, we're done.

352
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,560
-Chuan.
-Chuan.

353
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,720
Chuan.

354
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,760
Lady Raya,

355
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,400
you are exactly as Thongkliao said.

356
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,720
Really?

357
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,360
Who would believe you and Thongkliao?

358
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,880
Lady Raya.

359
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,840
Stupid people will always fall
for smart people.

360
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,840
Now you know what to do

361
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,120
unless

362
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,600
you want to end up like Thongkliao.

363
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,080
Let's go Thong.

364
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,240
Evil.

365
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,520
Don't you dare say that to me!

366
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,840
Bear in mind that I'm already kind to you.

367
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,040
So, know your place

368
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,640
if you don't want to be in trouble.

369
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,480
How do we not know our place?

370
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,400
Both I and Thongkliao knew our place

371
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,080
but you still hurt us, and Chuan too.

372
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,920
If you were the first wife,

373
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,680
you would know that

374
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,680
even if the mistresses know their place,

375
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,840
there is no way they can stay
with the first wife.

376
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,880
Chuan.

377
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,800
Don't Bun.

378
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,440
Don't touch me.

379
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,080
I'm dirty.

380
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,440
I'm a bad person.

381
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,720
I'm not the same anymore.

382
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,640
You are still my Dear.

383
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,240
I love you.

384
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,640
I will stay with you.

385
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,120
Things have escalated too much.

386
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,200
The Lord won't let you stay together.

387
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,920
And you,

388
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,360
you'll soon have to move in there like Im.

389
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,880
No.

390
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,440
No Mom.

391
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,800
I don't want to go.

392
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,440
I hate the Lord.

393
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,520
I hate Im. She's a betrayer.

394
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,080
I don't want to see her ever again.

395
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,840
Chuan.

396
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,960
I never thought

397
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,040
Im would be this cold-hearted.

398
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,520
Why is it like this?

399
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,800
Ying,

400
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,640
I want to die too. I want to die.

401
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,400
Bun.

402
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,600
Bun.

403
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,840
Don't talk to me Im.

404
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,520
You're a betrayer.

405
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,160
It's good that Ying is dead.

406
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,240
So he doesn't have to see your evilness.

407
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,600
What do you mean Bun?

408
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,240
Ying…

409
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,280
died of grief
since he moved to Suphanburi.

410
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,640
Ying…

411
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,200
There's no use pretending to cry now.

412
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,560
I won't believe you, betrayer.

413
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,480
Wait Bun.

414
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,200
Bun, listen to me.

415
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,440
I never thought about hurting Chuan.

416
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,480
I would never ever think about that.

417
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,640
Everything was Lady Raya's plan.

418
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,280
You're an evil person.

419
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,160
How can you slander a good person
like Lady Raya?

420
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,960
You can hit me or even kill me.

421
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,000
But I swear.

422
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,200
I could die here

423
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,000
or mother nature can take my life.

424
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,000
Everything that I did

425
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,360
was really Lady Raya's order.

426
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,400
That night, she was sick.

427
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,080
I think I have a fever.

428
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,000
The Lord hasn't come back yet.

429
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,040
I'll also be away tonight.

430
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,560
No one was there.

431
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,680
So Lady Raya asked me…

432
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,480
Please go and ask Chuan to stay with me.

433
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,640
After that, everything was…

434
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,400
Is what you say true?

435
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,320
Since we've known each other,

436
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,679
I've never lied to you even once.

437
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,120
Believe me.

438
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,280
I would never think about hurting Chuan.

439
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,280
Stop pretending, Raya.

440
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,920
Everything was because of you.

441
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,120
You used me to almost kill Im.

442
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,320
You asked me to hire the thugs
to hurt them both.

443
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,040
So that means what Thongkliao said…

444
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,080
It was the truth.

445
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,920
You have to tell Chuan.

446
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,280
So she can understand and stay away…

447
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,199
Stay away from Lady Raya.

448
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,520
Bun.

449
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,760
Is there anything wrong today Im?
Why don't you smile at all?

450
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,120
I'm worried about Chuan.

451
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,720
About Chuan hurting you yesterday, right?

452
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,520
What? Chuan hurt Im?

453
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,520
Yes my Lord.

454
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,000
After you went to work,

455
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,240
Chuan came to hurt Im.
The baby almost came out.

456
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,800
That's not true.

457
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,520
We just had a little misunderstanding.

458
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,720
What misunderstanding?
I saw you getting beaten so hard.

459
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,040
Tell him the truth. He won't blame Chuan.

460
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,280
Right my Lord?

461
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,560
Chuan didn't do anything to me.

462
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,800
She was just very upset about that night.

463
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,120
I'll talk to Chuan.

464
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,840
Are you upset
that everything didn't go as you planned?

465
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,320
No matter how you slander me,

466
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,480
I would never hurt Chuan.

467
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,960
And I'll make Chuan know your evilness.

468
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,800
If you think you can win,

469
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,560
try it.

470
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,560
NEXT EPISODE

471
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,640
Im.

472
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,240
You're stealing Bun from me.

473
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,520
I'll make you suffer for all your life.

474
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,720
I'll never let those slave mistresses

475
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,600
who try to compare themselves to me
live happily.

476
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,080
I'll destroy them.

477
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,800
Lady Raya!

478
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,960
What happened?

479
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,200
It was Im.
I don't know what's wrong with her.

480
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,640
She hurt Lady Raya out of nowhere.

481
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,280
What happened Im?

482
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,000
Even if I die, I'll never stop hating you.

483
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,960
I love Bun, not you.

484
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,040
Tell me if you're happy or upset.

485
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,800
I'm upset to be your wife.

486
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,080
But you're happy to be Bun's wife?

487
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,480
Today, I'll make you forget Bun.

488
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,560
Don't touch me.

489
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,040
I hate you. Hate, hate, hate!

490
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:43,080
-This is too much!
-Do it. Even if you kill me,

491
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,720
I'm not afraid!

492
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,400
