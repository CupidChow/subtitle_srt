1
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,520
My Lady.

2
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,680
My Lady, Thongkliao and Im are fighting.

3
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,400
Today,

4
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,160
you will definitely see Im miscarry.

5
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,760
Good. I want to see,

6
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,200
if she miscarries, what will the Lord say?

7
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,080
I want to know that too.

8
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,600
If Im really miscarries the baby,

9
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,839
Thongkliao will be caned to death.

10
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,120
The Lord forced you.
You do not want to keep the baby, right?

11
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
Come on.

12
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,600
I'll help you get rid of it.

13
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,440
Thongkliao.

14
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,520
Thongkliao, don't. Help me!

15
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,680
Thongkliao!

16
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,720
You threw yourself at him.

17
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,680
-Stop!
-Stop, Thongkliao.

18
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,680
Stop.

19
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,000
-Stop.
-Let me go!

20
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,560
-Im.
-Thongkliao.

21
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,400
Thongkliao, what is this?

22
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,200
The Lord forced her.

23
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,680
I'll help make her miscarry.

24
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,520
Stop. You know the baby
is the Lord's child don't you?

25
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,000
It's because it's his child.

26
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,720
What a bad sister.

27
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,960
You stole my husband.
I really want to know

28
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,920
if you were not pregnant,
would you be this arrogant?

29
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,360
Let me go!

30
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,560
-Don't do it!
-Thongkliao!

31
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,160
Die now.

32
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,800
Let me go.

33
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,840
Thongkliao.

34
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,080
Let me go. I said let me go!

35
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,040
Let me go.

36
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,160
-Stop!
-I hate you.

37
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,480
I said stop!

38
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,440
My Lord.

39
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,400
Thongkliao.

40
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,440
If I didn't change my mind and return,
I wouldn't see you hurt my wife and child.

41
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,560
Today, you'll die.

42
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,000
Bun, Som, take her and cane her to death.

43
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,760
My lord, please don't do this.

44
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,440
No. Let me go.

45
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,800
My Lady.

46
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,360
My Lady, help me.

47
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,320
My Lord, how is Im?

48
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,360
She doesn't look good.

49
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,160
You should take her into the house now.

50
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,160
Thong, go get Prik.

51
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,720
Yes my Lady.

52
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,600
Hang in there Im.
Prik is a good herbalist.

53
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,800
She'll be able to help you and the baby.

54
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,000
My Lady, Im stole our husband.

55
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,960
Why do you care about her?

56
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm about to die now. You have to help me.

57
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,080
-My Lady, come back--
-Shut up!

58
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,520
You two.

59
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,720
I told you to cane her.
Why are you still here?

60
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,840
My Lady.

61
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,160
My Lady, come back.

62
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,560
My Lady.

63
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,640
Come back.

64
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,720
-Is my child still there?
-Yes Sir.

65
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,320
The mother is lucky.
Normally, if this happens,

66
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,280
the baby would be gone.

67
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,360
Oh, Im.

68
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,280
Im, from now on,

69
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,080
move in to live with me.

70
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,720
I'll take care of you and the baby.

71
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,560
I won't let anyone hurt you.

72
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,680
My Lord,

73
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,840
I can stay in the same place.

74
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,640
Get some rest.

75
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,200
No, yours and Luang Wisut's child
is like my child.

76
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,440
I'm worried about you.

77
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,360
Thongkliao is unpredictable.

78
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,840
Move in with us.

79
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,920
Chuan, Mi, prepare a room for Im.
You can use Thongkliao's old room.

80
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,799
-Yes my Lady.
-How about Thongkliao's things my Lady?

81
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,960
Where should I put them?

82
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,400
Just throw them to her.

83
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,799
Should I burn them for her?

84
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,240
Burn what? She is not dead yet.

85
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,240
But you ordered them
to cane her to death didn't you?

86
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,720
Now that Im is alright,
I'll have mercy for once.

87
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,840
Chuan, go and tell Bun
that he can stop caning her now.

88
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,760
Yes my Lord.

89
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,240
And tell her, from now on,

90
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,360
stay in the slave house.

91
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,680
Don't come back to my house again.

92
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,680
It hurts. Stop hitting me!

93
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,880
I don't want to do this
but it's the Lord's order.

94
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,400
Im is pregnant.

95
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,400
You shouldn't have done that to her.

96
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,840
She stole my husband.

97
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,080
She stole my Lord.

98
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,800
You know that Im was forced to do that.

99
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,000
But she is pregnant now.

100
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,640
Don't you know
that she's being insolent now.

101
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,160
She's kicking me and Lady Raya
to the slave house.

102
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,720
-That's not true.
-That's true.

103
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,160
Behind your back,

104
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,640
Im tried to seduce Luang Wisut.

105
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,960
That's not true. I don't believe it.

106
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,600
I've never seen her with the Lord,
not even once.

107
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,360
Then how did she get pregnant?

108
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,360
You don't know what she can do.

109
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,400
She not only steals my husband,
but she also tries to hurt me!

110
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,800
Someone's coming.

111
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,280
Stop. Stop!

112
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,840
Im is alright now.

113
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,400
Luang Wisut ordered to stop caning her.

114
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,080
These are yours.

115
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,560
-Thong.
-Luang Wisut said

116
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,440
from now on, you are not allowed
to show your face in the house.

117
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,680
What do you mean?

118
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,120
From today,
you have to live in the slave house.

119
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,840
That's not true. I don't believe it.

120
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,000
Everyone, don't let her go upstairs.

121
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,320
I don't believe it.

122
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,200
That's not true.

123
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,680
Let go of me!

124
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,440
I love you with all my life.

125
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,640
Why do you do this to me?

126
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,120
Yes, that thing.

127
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,680
Chamob. Where is my Chamob?

128
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,280
Chamob. My Chamob.

129
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,080
-Thongkliao.
-Chamob.

130
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,800
Why are you looking for the item
that brings misfortune?

131
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,000
It's not evil, but it is a charm.

132
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,560
It's not evil? It's a charm?

133
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,560
I heard Chamob is the spirit of a woman
who dies in the woods.

134
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,960
Their spirits stay in the place they die.

135
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,680
Anyone who owns it

136
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,800
will face misfortune.

137
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,280
It's better that it's gone.

138
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,000
Don't be upset Thongkliao.

139
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,880
You're not the only one suffering.

140
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,640
I'm also suffering to death.

141
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,640
What are you upset about?

142
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,040
As you've heard,

143
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,000
from now on, Im is the Lord's wife.

144
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,280
She'll never be able to come back to me.

145
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,080
Bun, I'm scared.

146
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,040
I'm afraid that I'll end up like Im.

147
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,360
You have to tell the Lord soon
or we won't be able to stay together.

148
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,240
To be honest, I'm also not sure now.

149
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,040
Otherwise, he would have allowed us
to stay together already.

150
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,800
Bun, I'm scared. I'm very scared.

151
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,200
I'm scared too.

152
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,600
But if it is really happening,

153
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,800
I'll fight it with my life.

154
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,360
Women who own Chamob

155
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,120
will be blessed with charming spells.

156
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,760
All the men will fall head over heals.

157
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,840
Do you have a misfortune item
on your head?

158
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,920
My Lord,

159
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,160
I didn't do it.

160
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,160
And Im's child

161
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,240
will be the Lord's successor.

162
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,880
She also said

163
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,480
that she wants to be his only wife.

164
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,120
And she told the Lord to kick us out
to live in the slave house.

165
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,920
The only way we can get rid of Im…

166
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,200
She won't have a child.

167
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,120
-Stop.
-Die now.

168
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,880
Today, you'll be caned to death.

169
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,840
Bun, Som, cane her to death.

170
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,000
She doesn't look good.
You should take her into the house now.

171
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,120
Why do you care about her?
I'm about to die,

172
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,520
you have to help me.

173
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,320
Raya used me.

174
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,520
Why are you so dumb Thongkliao?

175
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,240
You're a wolf in sheep's clothing.

176
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,680
I won't let you hurt me one-sided,

177
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,920
Raya.

178
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,720
Mi, Chuan,

179
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,000
take Im's things to Thongkliao's old room.

180
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,720
Yes my Lady.

181
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,760
Wait.

182
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,800
What's the matter my Lord?

183
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,280
Raya, I want to watch Im closely.

184
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,760
What would you say

185
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,440
if I want her to stay in the room with us?

186
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,000
Luang Wisut.

187
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,880
What would you say?

188
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,120
It's alright my Lord. I can stay anywhere.

189
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,680
Come on.

190
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,960
You can't. You're my wife

191
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,600
and you're pregnant.

192
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,280
I can take good care of you.

193
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,160
What do you think Raya?

194
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,640
Whatever you think is best.

195
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,320
Take Im's things to the Lord's room.

196
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,280
And take my things
to Thongkliao's former room.

197
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,640
Huh?

198
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,360
Well,

199
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,640
are you mad at me?

200
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,400
I'm not.

201
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,400
I just think the room is quite small.

202
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,160
Having three people in the room
won't be comfortable.

203
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,360
I'd rather stay in Thongkliao's old room.

204
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,080
If so, I'm relieved.

205
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,400
This house is yours.

206
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,880
You can stay in whichever room you want.

207
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,960
Let's go.

208
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,680
I want to kill Im.

209
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,240
She said no. But when the Lord
brought her into the house,

210
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,120
she was overjoyed.

211
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,640
She bites the hand that feeds her.

212
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,960
Why would you let it be?

213
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,680
Who said I'd let Im
be his wife comfortably.

214
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,400
I'll let Chuan do it.

215
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,839
Im will suffer the pain that I feel.

216
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,160
Im stays in the house

217
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,760
and Lady Raya doesn't complain at all?

218
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:28,760
Not at all. She's even happy about that.
She keeps smiling.

219
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,320
Hm, Lady Raya

220
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,600
is such a kind-hearted person.

221
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,080
Raya, you'll never be good to anyone.

222
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,880
You're a wolf in sheep's clothing.

223
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,600
Im.

224
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,080
Ying.

225
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,400
I've got a lotus flower for you.

226
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,240
Why don't you take it?

227
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,960
You like lotus flowers, don't you?

228
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,360
Yes I do.

229
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,560
And I'll like them forever.

230
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,720
I can't take it Ying.

231
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm not the old me anymore.

232
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,520
That's right.

233
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,360
You are the Lord's wife,

234
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,240
not my lover anymore.

235
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,920
Don't make me feel worse.

236
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,120
I'm suffering enough now.

237
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,440
It's not your fault.

238
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,360
It's my fault.

239
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,960
From now on,

240
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,040
I wish you luck and happiness.

241
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,760
Goodbye.

242
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,120
Ying,

243
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,160
our destiny might end here.

244
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,960
Where is Im?

245
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,720
I'll check in the room.

246
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,120
No need. I've checked it.
She is not there.

247
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,080
I think she's gone for a walk.
She'll probably be back soon.

248
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,800
How can she go for a walk?
She is pregnant.

249
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,280
What if she faints?
Who would take care of her?

250
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,480
Im.

251
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,920
Where have you been?

252
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,360
I was worried about you.
I've been looking for you.

253
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,280
What's the matter?

254
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,760
Why did you cry?

255
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,320
I'm fine.

256
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,360
Does anyone know what happened?

257
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,720
It's probably because of Ying.

258
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,320
I saw her talking with Ying.

259
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,680
They looked like they missed each other.

260
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,240
And they were
holding each other while crying.

261
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,200
Bun, tell Ying to pack his things

262
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,240
and go to do rice farming
on my land in Suphanburi,

263
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,720
and don't ever come back.

264
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,960
Yes my Lord.

265
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,840
Ying,

266
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,760
if the next life does exist,

267
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,520
I will love you forever.

268
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,480
Please forgive me.

269
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,480
Im.

270
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,040
Im,

271
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,240
I'm sorry about Ying.

272
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,920
Wait Im.

273
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,800
Don't be afraid of me.
I'm not going to do anything.

274
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,880
I'm sorry

275
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,040
for doing bad things to you.

276
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,600
In the past, I might have been vengeful

277
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,360
and envious.

278
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,200
But I never meant to hurt you.

279
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,840
Please forgive me.

280
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,760
Im, I bought some herbs for you.

281
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,560
Eat them. So you'll be healthy.

282
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,000
You've been looking pale recently.

283
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:49,320
Please take them.
I really came to say sorry.

284
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,640
You don't trust me anymore?

285
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,640
Do you hate me?

286
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,880
I don't hate you,

287
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,120
but I'm scared.

288
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,880
Don't be scared of me. Please trust me.

289
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,200
I don't mean any harm to you.

290
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,960
Please forgive me.

291
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,680
Otherwise,
I'll suffer for the rest of my life

292
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,480
for hurting a sister like you.

293
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,240
Im.

294
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:40,240
Eat these herbs. So you'll be healthy.

295
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,000
I may be healthy physically,

296
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,760
but my heart has been broken.

297
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,320
I love Ying.
I don't want to be the Lord's wife.

298
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,000
Oh Im.

299
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,560
Im.

300
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,080
I'm happy for you

301
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,000
that you've reconciled with Thongkliao.

302
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,880
But still, you have to be careful.

303
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,080
She's really jealous of the Lord.
I'm afraid she'll do something bad.

304
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,080
Alright. I'll be careful.

305
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,840
But now, I'm not thinking about anything

306
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,920
except for my child.

307
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,960
So, can you accept
being the Lord's wife now?

308
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,880
He's the father of my child anyway.

309
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,800
But I just realized Chuan,

310
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,240
what people mean when they say
they can do anything for their child.

311
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,440
When I become a mother,

312
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,440
it's really like that.

313
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,080
If my child can live a good life,

314
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,600
I can trade my life for that.

315
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,640
Then I'm happy for you.

316
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,440
I wish you and your child happiness.

317
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,960
Where have you been?

318
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,720
We went for a walk.

319
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,400
Be careful. You're pregnant.

320
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,680
If something happens,
the Lord would be sad.

321
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,280
What is that?

322
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,040
It is some herbs.

323
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,640
I think I'll boil them and drink it.

324
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,200
Let Chuan do it.

325
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,200
You're pregnant. Don't do anything.

326
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,640
Just rest in the room.

327
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,840
It's alright.

328
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,200
Come on. Let Chuan do it.

329
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,200
Give it to me. I'll boil it for you.

330
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,160
Do what Lady Raya said.

331
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,800
Excuse me.

332
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,440
Alright.

333
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,400
Thong, take the poisonous herbs
that I hid in the box

334
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,440
and swap with her herbs.

335
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,320
Oh.

336
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,000
What are you doing Chuan?

337
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,640
I'm boiling the herbs Mom.

338
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,320
Can you let it boil
and sharpen the knife for me?

339
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,680
This knife is not sharp at all.

340
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,760
-And it's stained.
-Alright.

341
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,160
Aw, where is Chuan?

342
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,840
She's sharpening the knife for me.
What's the matter?

343
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,120
Oh, Raya asked for her.

344
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,120
Are the herbs for Im done?

345
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,840
Oh, it's almost done.
Just wait for the water to boil a bit.

346
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,400
Oh, alright.

347
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,760
When it's done,
bring it as soon as possible.

348
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,640
-So Lady Raya won't be worried.
-Alright.

349
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,160
Ah.

350
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,480
Oh dear!

351
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,960
-Ouch.
-I'm sorry.

352
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,000
-Let me help.
-No need.

353
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,640
Just bring the knife to your mom.

354
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,760
It almost chopped my face.

355
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,720
Oh my Gosh.

356
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,880
-I'm sorry.
-You're holding

357
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,400
the knife carelessly.

358
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,280
Hey, if it's done, bring it

359
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,720
to Im as soon as possible.

360
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,720
Alright.

361
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,480
Chuan, what is that?

362
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,880
It's herbs my Lord.

363
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,960
Let me see.

364
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,200
It's herbal medicine my Lord.

365
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,880
Im wants to take it.
So I asked Chuan to make it.

366
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,760
Whoa, that's some random herbs.

367
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,400
The black color doesn't look appetizing.

368
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,720
If she wants to be healthy,
I'll ask the foreign doctor for medicine.

369
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,680
Chuan, throw it away.

370
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,680
Don't do that.

371
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,480
Pregnant women are emotional.

372
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,960
If we displease her and she is angry,

373
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,280
it will affect the baby.

374
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,000
But it doesn't look appetizing.

375
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,840
Pregnant women don't think like us.

376
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,960
You may have heard that pregnant women
like to eat coal and dirt.

377
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,760
Moreover, these herbs,

378
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,760
Im is the one who brought them.

379
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,600
It can't be bad.

380
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,760
Alright, then I'll feed her.
Chuan, follow me.

381
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,200
Yes sir.

382
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,240
Keep pleasing her.

383
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,360
If Im miscarries,

384
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,760
I'll laugh out loud.

385
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,040
Does it take long until she miscarries?

386
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,800
For strong mothers, it would take days.

387
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,320
But a mother like Im, it won't be long.

388
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,240
How do you feel? Can you swallow it?

389
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:06,200
It's bitter, but it's alright.
If it makes my baby healthy,

390
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,440
I can take it.

391
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,960
How about you? Do you want to be
chilling in the house with Im?

392
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,640
No my Lord.

393
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,120
My parents are very old.

394
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,960
I want to stay with them.

395
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,760
That's not what I mean.

396
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,320
I mean

397
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,000
when I go to work,
you come to stay with Im. That's it.

398
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,200
If so,

399
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,840
I can do that.

400
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,600
Thank you so much.

401
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,280
Look at your friend.

402
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,720
Your friend is strange.

403
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,120
Why is she so scared?

404
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,960
You can go now.

405
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,720
I feel like a tiger when I'm with you.

406
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,320
Yes my Lord.

407
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,640
Chuan.

408
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,840
What's wrong?

409
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,480
Nothing my Lady.

410
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,400
Why do you look like you just saw a tiger?

411
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,720
Nothing my Lady.

412
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,320
Or…

413
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,160
Luang Wisut is trying to take her?

414
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,160
That's possible.

415
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,400
Otherwise, she wouldn't look that scared.

416
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,520
I think I have to use Thongkliao

417
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,880
to get rid of these two.

418
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,520
Thongkliao.

419
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,720
Thongkliao, are you there?

420
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,920
Thongkliao, I'm visiting.

421
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,960
You pretend to speak softly.
You're pretentious.

422
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,320
My Lady.

423
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,040
I'm here to visit.

424
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,320
Please come in.

425
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,240
Here you go Thongkliao.

426
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,360
Lady Raya brought it for you.

427
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,520
Thank you for thinking about me.

428
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,720
I've been wanting to come for many days
but I didn't have a chance.

429
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,200
You know I have to take care of Im.

430
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,000
Anyway, how are you?

431
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,040
Are you hurt?

432
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,560
The pain in my body is nothing

433
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,120
compared to my heart.

434
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,760
It's because of Im.

435
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,280
No, it's because of my stupidity.

436
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,760
I was blindly loyal.

437
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,160
Anyway, how is Im doing?

438
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,120
What else can she be?

439
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,480
She's arrogant
and keeps looking down on me.

440
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,720
By the way,

441
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,880
you just met Im, didn't you?

442
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,800
Yes.

443
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,400
And seeing her happy

444
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,320
makes me even more angry.

445
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,639
She told me Luang Wisut
really loves and cares for her.

446
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,800
I should have beaten her
until she miscarried.

447
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,440
So she wouldn't have been this arrogant.

448
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,679
Then, what are you going to do next?

449
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,639
I'm thinking about how to get rid of her.

450
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,560
If you help me,
I'll ask the Lord to forgive you.

451
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,679
Really?

452
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,719
Yes.

453
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,239
What do you want me to do?

454
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,960
In the Southern area,
there are some thugs.

455
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,920
Hire them to rape Im.

456
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,920
Rape Im?

457
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,840
Yes. And I'll get Chuan to help her.

458
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,360
Then, they will both be assaulted

459
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,000
and go crazy.

460
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,480
You can do it can't you?

461
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,400
I can do even more

462
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,160
if it gets rid of my enemies.

463
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,160
When do you want me to do it?

464
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,360
On the Buddhist holy day,

465
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,120
the Lord will have to go to a ceremony
in Suphanburi with Bun.

466
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,880
You can do it then.

467
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,960
I've prepared the wage.

468
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,000
Here it is, my lady.

469
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,720
Thong,

470
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,920
-Yes my Lady.
-this time, the three of them will die.

471
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,600
Yes my Lady.

472
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,640
Im and Chuang will be assaulted to death.

473
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,680
And Thongkliao

474
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,120
will be caned to death.

475
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,920
Do it a little harder Chuan.
She is pregnant.

476
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,880
Her body must ache.

477
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,080
Massage will make her feel better.

478
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,800
Yes my Lady.

479
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,840
Do you feel good Im?

480
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,920
Yes, but I don't want to bother you.

481
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,240
Why would you feel that way?
I'm doing it for the little master.

482
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,240
Moreover, you are the Lord's wife now.

483
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,880
I am a slave.
It's my job to take care of you.

484
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,040
Chuan, well said.

485
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,160
Raya,

486
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,800
when I went to Phra Nakhon,

487
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,360
I got a lot of foreign cloths.

488
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,120
Would you mind giving one to Chuan?

489
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,080
I think so too.

490
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,120
You don't have to Lady Raya.

491
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,440
It's alright. Thong, get a foreign cloth
in my chest.

492
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,520
Yes my Lady.

493
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,600
Choose one Chuan.

494
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,280
It's up to your kindness my Lady.

495
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,880
Alright, I'll choose one for you.

496
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:08,040
The light banana leaf green
matches well with your skin tone.

497
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,920
Thank you my Lord.

498
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,440
I remember you like yellow.

499
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,880
I'll give you one more.

500
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,400
It's alright my Lady.

501
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,480
Take it.

502
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,520
You take good care of Im.

503
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,200
It's alright.

504
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,200
Take it as a reward

505
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,240
for taking good care of Im.

506
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,280
Thank you very much my Lady.

507
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,040
You also want to have Chuan?

508
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,760
Everyone has mistresses.

509
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,080
So don't make it a big deal.

510
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,160
NEXT EPISODE

511
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,200
You really know what I like Chuan.

512
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,240
You're evil.

513
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,120
You tried to kill my child and wife?

514
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,960
If I'm going to die today,

515
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,840
you are dying with me.

516
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,720
Everyone will regret

517
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,280
not believing me.

518
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,440
I'll come to get revenge on you
in every life.

519
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,280
Remember this Raya!

520
