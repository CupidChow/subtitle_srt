1
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,280
I remember that you like the color yellow.

2
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,640
Have this one as well.

3
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,720
I can't accept it my Lady.

4
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,840
Just accept it. You take good care of her.

5
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,520
It is fine.

6
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,520
It's the least I can do

7
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,560
to thank you for your service.

8
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,640
Thank you my Lady.

9
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,640
And Chuan,

10
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,560
prepare some food
for me to give alms to the monks.

11
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,360
As you wish my Lady.

12
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,920
Bun caught a lot of shrimp

13
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,400
so I planned to grill them.
Is that fine by you?

14
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,440
No. I'd rather not have that.

15
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,320
I feel bad for the shrimp.

16
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,720
Could you make something
without any cruel processes?

17
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,000
Raya. What's wrong with that?

18
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,480
Shrimp and fish are our food

19
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,560
and they're already dead.

20
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,480
But they were alive before that.

21
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,960
Since the day I lost my child,

22
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,960
I'm telling you honestly

23
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,840
that I don't want to harm any life.

24
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,560
I'm afraid that karma

25
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,840
will follow and come upon us
with consequences.

26
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,760
If we have another child, I'm afraid

27
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,040
that it will take our child from us again.

28
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,680
Raya.

29
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,240
Don't stress about it too much.

30
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,400
You're not the one who directly caught
or slaughtered the animals.

31
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,520
Chuan. If any of the shrimp
are still alive,

32
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,520
release them back to the pond. Please.

33
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,800
Yes.

34
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,520
Chuan.

35
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,160
Listen to me.

36
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,560
-What is it Thongkliao?
-Lady Raya is the one

37
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,760
who hired thugs from a southern village
to harass you and Im.

38
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,480
No way. That's Impossible.

39
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,760
She doesn't even like to harm animals.

40
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,120
There's no way she would hire a hitman.

41
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,880
I spoke the truth. Trust me.

42
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,840
Raya hates you both.

43
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,240
She fears the Lord
will favor you over her.

44
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,280
Stop right there.

45
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
No more lies about Lady Raya.

46
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,880
After all this time, I see through you.

47
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,080
No matter how hard you try,
I won't believe you.

48
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,400
And don't ever mention this to anyone

49
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,320
unless you want your own life ruined.

50
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,440
Chuan. You'll regret not trusting me.

51
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,280
And what did Chuan say?

52
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,920
She didn't believe it.

53
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,880
She said a kind person like yourself

54
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,960
didn't even want to harm

55
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,880
any animals.

56
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,040
No way you would order a person killed.

57
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,880
But I can't believe Thongkliao

58
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,880
for telling such a terrible story to her.

59
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,160
She has no idea

60
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,480
how her mouth will get her killed.

61
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,560
You will get what you deserve.

62
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,520
Thongkliao.

63
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,600
Where is Raya? Why is she so late?

64
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,160
Is it possible that she's sick?

65
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,480
I will check on her.

66
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,960
I'll go myself.

67
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,560
-Did you find anything Thong?
-No my Lady.

68
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,480
Where could it be?

69
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm sure it was here last night.

70
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,080
What is happening here Raya?

71
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,360
A bag of offerings Dear.

72
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,960
I prepared it for the monks this morning

73
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,160
but somehow it disappeared.

74
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,640
It put it here.

75
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,080
Did you look everywhere?

76
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,880
I did my Lord.

77
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,280
I'll help look for it my Lord.

78
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,680
How could it just disappear?
We never have any burglaries here.

79
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,320
I wonder too.

80
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,640
No strangers have ever been here.

81
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,920
There are only the residents.

82
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,760
But…

83
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,800
But what? Spit it out.

84
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,000
My Lord, last night

85
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,240
I saw Thongkliao looking suspicious
around this area.

86
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,920
Thongkliao.

87
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,320
Search her room now.

88
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,840
Yes.

89
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,480
What are you doing here?

90
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,360
The Lord wants your room searched.

91
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,920
-Why?
-Lady Raya's money bag was lost.

92
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,760
What does it have to do with me?

93
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,680
Someone saw you lingering around the area.

94
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,320
It was me.

95
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,000
I wasn't doing anything like that.

96
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,760
Chuan. I know why I was there.

97
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,240
Whatever. We're here on the Lord's order.

98
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,200
Let's go.

99
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,280
I won't allow it.

100
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,240
Move Thongkliao.

101
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,799
Hey. Let go.

102
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,480
I don't have any money bags.

103
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,400
-Don't go inside.
-Thongkliao.

104
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,000
Let me go! Don't touch my stuff!

105
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,680
Leave me alone!

106
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,600
Stop! Don't touch them.

107
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,120
Stop messing with my things.

108
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,640
Stop right now!

109
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,200
Stop searching my room now.

110
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,360
-Stop!
-Thongkliao!

111
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,520
Chuan. Don't touch anything!

112
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,040
I told you to stop.

113
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,960
Listen to me!

114
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,280
Chuan!

115
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,200
Chuan. Let me see

116
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,920
Does it hurt?

117
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,240
I'm sorry Chuan. I didn't mean to do that.

118
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
Yes. You didn't mean to.

119
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,360
But you're acting suspicious

120
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,560
because you're getting caught
stealing Lady Raya's money.

121
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,080
No, Mi!

122
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,040
Then what is this?

123
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,480
Anything Bun?

124
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,320
There's one money bag my Lord.

125
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,080
Is this yours?

126
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,600
Yes. It's mine.
Why was it at Thongkliao's?

127
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,120
You are the one who gave me this!

128
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,480
That's not true Dear.
I didn't give it to her.

129
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,960
What's not true?

130
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,840
Good. Let's find out who you really are.

131
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,880
My Lord.

132
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,640
It was Lady Raya who gave me the money

133
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,800
to hire thugs from the southern village
to harass Im and Chuan.

134
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,560
That's not true. Impossible.

135
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,360
How is it not true?

136
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,720
You're jealous that Im
is having a child with the Lord.

137
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,480
You envy Chuan,
because the Lord is interested in her.

138
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,720
So you want someone to hurt them.

139
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,240
-Thongkliao. Stop it now.
-I won't.

140
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,640
My Lord.

141
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,080
Raya is not a good person
like all of you thought. She's wicked.

142
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,720
She's behind all of this.

143
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,520
She used and blamed me all along.

144
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,040
That's not true Dear. I had no idea.

145
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,640
Stop lying bitch!

146
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,400
Today I'll have your blood!
I don't care if I die!

147
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,720
Get over here!

148
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
Stop!

149
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,320
-Come here!
-Thongkliao!

150
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,160
Come here!

151
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,640
Come here! Let me go!

152
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,920
What is it Tuan?

153
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,080
Thongkliao stole Lady Raya's money.

154
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,680
What?

155
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,240
Ugh.

156
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,720
Im! Blood!

157
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,600
Tuan…

158
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,960
-Get off!
-Thongkliao.

159
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,440
You lying bitch.

160
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,560
Liar!

161
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,360
Hey!

162
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,920
How dare you?! You never know your place.

163
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,080
How many times did I forgive you?

164
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,720
You have no shame!
Bun. Bring me the stick.

165
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,600
Today you'll die by my hands!

166
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,560
-My Lord! There's something…
-What?!

167
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,080
Im is bleeding my Lord.

168
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,120
How is she doing Prik?

169
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's fortunate there's not much blood.

170
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,000
They're both safe. Mother and child.

171
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,680
How could this happen Prik?

172
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,480
It might be the poisonous herbs

173
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,200
that she consumed my Lord.

174
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,440
Poisonous herbs?

175
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,200
That is right. We're so lucky

176
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,360
she didn't miscarry.

177
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,560
Prik.

178
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,040
How did you know it was poison?

179
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,640
I'm well-versed in herbs.
How could I not know?

180
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,280
You went that far
to not have a child with me?

181
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,080
No my Lord. I love my child.

182
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,560
Then why would you eat that?

183
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,200
I didn't know.

184
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,360
Tell us Im. No one will hurt you.

185
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,080
Im.

186
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,120
Tell us already.

187
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,520
Spill it Im.
Where did you get these herbs?

188
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,160
Thongkliao gave them to me my Lord.

189
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,000
Thongkliao!

190
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,800
You swine!

191
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,000
Did you plan to kill my wife and child?

192
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,280
You're dead!

193
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,520
My Lord. I swear I didn't do it.

194
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,240
Im.

195
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,360
I really didn't do it Im.

196
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,280
It wasn't me.

197
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,240
I swear. I didn't do it.

198
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,840
Shut your damn mouth!

199
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,680
Someone like you doesn't deserve kindness!

200
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,920
Today you'll die!

201
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,760
Please stop.

202
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,120
I'm completely fine now.

203
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,720
Please forgive Thongkliao my Lord.

204
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,120
She almost killed you, killed our child!

205
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,600
Just forgive her?

206
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,320
Yes.

207
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,400
Please Dear.

208
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,760
Please forgive her.
Perhaps she didn't mean to.

209
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,720
Stop acting innocent Raya.

210
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,320
You're behind this.

211
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,120
You tricked me
into using Chamob as a charm.

212
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,680
You used me

213
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,560
to fatally hurt Im.

214
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,680
You sent me to hire thugs
to harass these two.

215
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,560
And you framed me for stealing your money.

216
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,440
The poisonous herbs that almost killed Im,

217
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,360
I know it's yours.

218
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,000
Dear.

219
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,200
I don't know about any of these things.

220
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,920
Stop lying! It's you! Only you!

221
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,200
If I die today, I'll bring you with me.

222
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,440
Stop!

223
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,840
Thongkliao!

224
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,440
Come here!

225
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,200
Thongkliao. Today is your last day.

226
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,560
Tie her up!

227
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,480
Hurry up!

228
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,800
You will all regret not trusting my words.

229
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,320
And you.

230
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,560
I'll have my revenge in your future lives.

231
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,720
Mark my words Raya!

232
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,720
Remember this!

233
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,120
Thongkliao.

234
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,680
Thongkliao.

235
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,320
Thongkliao. Thongkliao!

236
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,320
Um.

237
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,600
My Lord. What should we do with her?

238
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,040
Leave her here.

239
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,720
If she wakes up, beat her to death!

240
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,400
It's yours.

241
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,680
Thank you my Lady.

242
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,240
Just as I planned Thong.

243
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,840
Those shameless mistresses

244
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,600
will face a wife like me.

245
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,520
But it's unfortunate
that Im's child is alive and well.

246
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,760
The poisonous herbs might not be enough.

247
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,160
Yes my Lady.

248
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,000
We miscalculated.

249
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,760
So Im will now

250
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,040
continue to have a good life.

251
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,760
I won't allow that!

252
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,240
She'll be out of here

253
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,000
before the child is even born.

254
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,120
Mark my words.

255
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,200
How did she end up like this?

256
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,320
It's because of jealousy.

257
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,680
I warned her

258
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,440
not to speak nonsense,
but she didn't listen.

259
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,400
Did you know about this?

260
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,040
Yes Bun.

261
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,040
Thongkliao told me about Lady Raya

262
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,480
hiring someone to hurt me and Im
but I didn't listen.

263
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,640
Yes. That's impossible.

264
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,200
Lady Raya is kind and merciful.

265
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,400
Does she act like she despises you Im?

266
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,280
No. She's been so kind and caring to me.

267
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,440
I won't be able to repay her in this life.

268
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,359
She knew no one would believe her words.

269
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,720
Why did she keep getting in trouble?

270
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,600
Let her be Chuan. I believe in karma.

271
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,920
Everyone will face consequences.

272
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,200
Poor Lady Raya.

273
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,280
After all these accusations,
how is she doing?

274
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,160
I didn't do any of it Dear.

275
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,920
Thongkliao is trying to frame me.

276
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,240
I know. Don't you worry.

277
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,080
But I don't understand
why it has to be me.

278
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,680
I was kind to all of them.

279
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,600
That is true, my Lord.

280
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,880
All my life I've never seen such a wife

281
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,600
who shines mercy like the sun

282
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,560
as my Lady Raya does.

283
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,200
There is no way
she would do anything so vile.

284
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,680
I'm so afraid.
What if the ghost of Thongkliao

285
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,400
returns to haunt me?

286
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,520
Look, she isn't dead yet.

287
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,400
I'm afraid anyway Dear.

288
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,560
Now that she's passed out,

289
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,600
her soul might leave her body
and try to kill me.

290
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,200
Dear. Please keep me company tonight.

291
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,240
Listen. You already have Thong with you.

292
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,760
That's different.

293
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,400
Please Dear.

294
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,760
But I'm worried about Im.
She went through a lot today.

295
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,600
Very well.

296
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,080
She has a child you would care about,
unlike me.

297
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Don't say that Raya.

298
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,680
I already told you that you're the wife
who's above any other women.

299
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,560
Here's the plan.
I'll come back for you tonight.

300
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,920
Thank you Dear.

301
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,760
Hey, Im.

302
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,240
Chuan. Keep Im company tonight.

303
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,040
I have to be with Raya.

304
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,120
If anything happens,

305
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,960
come and let me know right away.
I'm worried for her.

306
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,000
Yes.

307
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,560
Look at that Thong.

308
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,080
He couldn't be apart from her
even for a night.

309
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,880
Men just can't help
being attracted to new things.

310
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,120
So I'm the old news?

311
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,320
I didn't mean it like that my Lady.

312
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,240
My Lady Raya is still young and beautiful,

313
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,640
like a teenage girl.

314
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,960
But to be sure, let's turn you

315
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,880
into an irresistible angel tonight.

316
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,880
So that the Lord

317
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,440
won't even think of going back to Im.

318
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,600
My goodness.

319
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,800
My Lady is so beautiful

320
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,920
just like a young lady.

321
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,080
That means…

322
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,160
-I'm able to compete with Im, am I?
-Of course my Lady.

323
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,080
Your skin

324
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,200
is glowing like a pearl.

325
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,600
Im is just a slave.
She has nothing on you.

326
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,440
So, where is Luang Wisut now?

327
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,400
He went downstairs my Lady.

328
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,600
No need to follow him.

329
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,600
He will be here soon.

330
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,040
Once he's here and opens the door,

331
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,120
he'll definitely be stunned by your looks.

332
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,240
Very well.

333
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,880
Please excuse me.

334
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,920
I wish my Lady

335
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,240
to be the happiest woman in the world.

336
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,720
Thank you.

337
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,480
Here. Have this.

338
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,080
Again? Thank you my Lady.

339
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,080
I wish you

340
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,440
all the happiness

341
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,560
unchallenged by any mistresses.

342
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,360
Go ahead.

343
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,680
If he comes in and sees you,
his mood will be ruined.

344
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,360
Yes.

345
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,440
Raya would never be such a cruel person.

346
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,640
Why are you awake Chuan? Can't sleep?

347
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,240
Yes. I am not familiar with the place.

348
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,520
You look afraid. What are you afraid of?

349
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,520
Im.

350
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,760
It might sound stupid.

351
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,920
Tell me.

352
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,160
I fear that if I'm asleep,
the Lord will come in.

353
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,720
I understand what you feel.

354
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,240
But I'm right here.

355
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,080
I won't let him do anything to you.

356
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,560
Im.

357
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,640
Please promise me.

358
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,920
Don't let him violate me. I'm so afraid.

359
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,160
I promise.

360
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,080
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

361
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,200
It's this late and my Lady isn't up yet.

362
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,600
Could it be that last night…?

363
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,960
Oh my goodness.

364
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,120
Where is he?

365
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,320
Isn't he in the room?

366
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,560
He wasn't with me last night.

367
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,720
Oh my. Then where would he be?

368
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,120
My Lord!

369
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,520
My Lord.

370
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,720
My Lord.

371
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,400
What is it Bun?
You keep shouting this early.

372
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,960
It's Thongkliao.

373
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,240
Raya.

374
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,720
I will kill you!

375
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,840
I'll have my revenge!

376
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,160
I will kill you!

377
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,400
I didn't do it my Lord.

378
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,600
It wasn't me.

379
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,480
It wasn't me my Lord.

380
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,360
Raya!

381
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,000
-I'll kill you.
-Thongkliao!

382
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,600
Raya! You bitch!

383
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,440
I'll kill you!

384
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,760
Thongkliao.

385
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,640
Thongkliao.

386
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,000
It might be when her head hit the tree.

387
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,760
When she woke up

388
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,560
she was like this my Lord.

389
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,080
It's all my fault.

390
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,560
Why do you blame yourself like that?

391
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,000
If I wasn't bleeding yesterday,

392
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,040
these things wouldn't be happening.

393
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,840
But she gave you the herbs didn't she?

394
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,760
I believe they weren't poisonous.

395
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,480
Thongkliao isn't that cruel.

396
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,360
There's no way she could do that.

397
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,840
If they're not poisonous,

398
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,640
then what caused the bleeding Im?

399
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,880
I don't know.

400
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,960
Enough. Don't blame yourself.

401
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,240
It already happened.

402
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,160
If you think you're to blame,

403
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,440
then I am too…

404
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,920
…for punishing her this much.

405
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,400
Bun.

406
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,720
Take Thongkliao back to her place

407
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,320
and take care of her.

408
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,000
Try to cure her.

409
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,440
Yes.

410
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,400
I'm sorry my Lord.

411
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,000
I'm sorry.

412
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,480
I didn't do it.

413
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,840
It wasn't me.

414
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,120
Thongkliao.

415
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,320
Raya.

416
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,320
Thongkliao.

417
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,680
-Let me go.
-Come with me.

418
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,040
I'm so furious seeing what he did.

419
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,400
Im. You and I cannot coexist.

420
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,440
Eat up, so your child will be healthy.

421
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,480
Thank you very much Lady Raya,

422
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,480
for caring.

423
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,040
It's my duty.

424
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,680
After all,

425
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,200
your child is like my child.

426
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,600
Do you agree Dear?

427
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,560
Yes.

428
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,520
Chuan.

429
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,400
Are you hungry?

430
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,800
Do you want some sweets?

431
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,800
I'm not hungry my Lord.

432
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,840
Well, I know you worked hard all morning.

433
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,640
How could you not be? Here.

434
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,920
Have some of this.

435
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,880
I'm really not hungry my Lord.

436
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,080
Chuan. I gave it to you.

437
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,400
So just eat it. It's my wish. Understood?

438
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,320
Yes.

439
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,120
Eat up. There's no poison in it.

440
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,640
Bun. I'm so afraid.

441
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,960
Me too.

442
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,840
What do we do now?

443
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,000
If there's a chance,
I'll try to ask him about us again.

444
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,160
Please hurry up.
I want to finally be with you.

445
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,800
I'm so afraid to be around the Lord.

446
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,040
Yes.

447
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,600
What?

448
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,520
Do you want to also have Chuan?

449
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,280
Yes.

450
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,880
Raya.

451
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,080
You don't have to worry.

452
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,320
I will love and respect only you.

453
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,560
Well, Im is pregnant now.

454
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,560
I only want someone
to take care of me in her place.

455
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,920
Please let me have Chuan as my last wife.

456
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,720
But before this, you promised me

457
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,520
Im would be the last one.

458
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,080
But she is pregnant now.

459
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,760
Please Raya.

460
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,080
Let me have her.

461
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,120
Please.

462
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,600
Chuan will be the last one, and no more.

463
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,480
What if I say no?

464
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,240
Listen Raya.

465
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,200
Please don't make a big deal out of it.

466
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,520
You know people have wives and mistresses.

467
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,080
And I always ask you first each time.

468
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,920
I never bring anyone home
without your permission.

469
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,800
So stop causing this drama.
I won't argue with you over this.

470
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,360
Excuse me.

471
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,640
Put this away.

472
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,800
How unfortunate.

473
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,400
What will you do now my Lady?

474
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,400
You know I couldn't do anything.

475
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,120
No matter how hurt or infuriated I am,

476
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,320
I still have to honor Luang Wisut's wish.

477
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,760
If it is that much suffering,

478
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,520
how about getting a divorce my Lady?

479
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,520
No way. If I do that, all the peasants

480
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,560
will see me as a worthless widow
unwanted by her husband.

481
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,560
I also have my title as a Lady.
I went through a lot

482
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,440
and I won't let any women
steal that so easily.

483
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,199
Any who dare challenge me,
I'll get rid of them all.

484
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,159
The Lord will have only me.

485
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,719
What will you do
with that many Indian corks?

486
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,520
I think I'm going to
make a flower sachet.

487
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,480
Will it work?

488
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,800
Indian corks are too fragile
and lose their scent when dried.

489
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,240
How about Spanish cherries,
Ylang-ylang or bread flower?

490
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,680
I like Indian corks my Lady. I really do.

491
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,760
If it's not working,

492
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,800
I'll put it by the pillow
to diffuse some scent.

493
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,720
This preference of yours
matches Luang Wisut's.

494
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,720
He also likes Indian corks.

495
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,960
You can offer him some.

496
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,560
Yes.

497
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,360
My Lord.

498
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,680
I have something to ask.

499
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,200
I'm tired today. Get out of my face.

500
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,560
Indian corks

501
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,480
smell so good. Who made this?

502
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,880
It was me my Lord.

503
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,000
You…

504
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,880
…know me so well, Chuan.

505
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,920
Lady Raya told me to pick them for you.

506
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,200
I knew you would like them.

507
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,240
Raya.

508
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,560
The favor that I've asked you,

509
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,680
is it complete?

510
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,960
Not yet.

511
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,320
Then, could you please hasten it?

512
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,400
I will have business in Suphan Buri

513
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,920
which could last up to a month this time.

514
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,600
I would like that favor
to be done before I go.

515
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,960
Lady Raya.

516
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,200
How can I be of service?

517
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,800
Lady Raya.

518
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,320
Please, no.

519
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,960
Everyone did this to me

520
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,880
but seem to be happy
when they're with Luang Wisut.

521
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,600
Not me my Lady.

522
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,600
I love

523
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,280
and respect you with my life.

524
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,520
I swear.

525
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,080
I would never hurt you in anyway.

526
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,040
I choose to believe you.

527
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,480
But I don't despise you.

528
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,920
It is good to have another woman
to help serve Luang Wisut.

529
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,680
Bun. Listen to me.

530
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,880
Im! You snake!

531

NEXT EPISODE

532
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,880
No woman in this world is content

533
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,600
with her husband having affairs.

534
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,480
No! I will have what I want!

535
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,040
Then wait in my room tonight.

536
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,640
Chuan will be there.

537
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,200
Please don't.

538
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,040
Are you upset my Lady,

539
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,080
that things don't go as planned?

540
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,760
If you think you can win,

541
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,840
then try.
