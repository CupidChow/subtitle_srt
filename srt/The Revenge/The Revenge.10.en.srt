1
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,880
Are you upset my Lady,

2
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,040
that things don't go as planned?

3
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,520
No matter how much you frame me,

4
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,720
I'll never hurt Chuan.

5
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,080
And I will do everything
to make Chuan realize how vile you are.

6
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,080
If you think you can win,

7
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,160
then try.

8
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,680
Lady Raya!

9
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,000
I really don't need to be here.

10
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,280
But to be reassuring,

11
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,720
I'll admit

12
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,400
it's all my fault.

13
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,560
I love Chuan.

14
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,040
And I want her at my service.

15
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,040
I hope you get me.

16
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,400
Chuan.

17
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,520
From now on,

18
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,840
you'll be in my house.

19
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,680
No my Lord.

20
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,800
Listen.

21
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,920
It's my order!

22
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,480
Do you want Som and Mi to suffer?

23
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,320
Go pack up.

24
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,400
Listen.

25
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,640
You all know very well

26
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,080
I'm not a tyrannical Lord.

27
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,840
But if I'm not harsh,

28
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,840
Chuan won't comply.

29
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,440
You two

30
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,920
can rest assured

31
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,680
I'll do my best to take care of Chuan.

32
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,480
And you Bun.

33
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,720
If you no longer wish to be here,

34
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,280
then feel free to leave.

35
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,000
You can go to Suphan Buri like Ying.
I don't mind.

36
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,920
My Lord!

37
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,720
-Please come with me!
-What now?

38
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,880
Come!

39
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,680
Raya. What happened?

40
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,840
It's Im.

41
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,280
Out of the blue,

42
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,400
she started attacking Lady Raya.

43
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,120
Why Im?

44
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,720
I did not do this my Lord.

45
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,320
Suddenly, Lady Raya
banged her head against the pole.

46
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,440
Im!

47
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,080
How could you say that?

48
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,560
Who would be crazy enough?

49
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,800
If you don't dare to say, then let me.

50
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,720
Dear.

51
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,640
She's mad at me

52
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,400
for telling Chuan

53
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,040
you'll make her and the child

54
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,640
go back to being slaves

55
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,120
if she won't let you have Chuan.

56
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,240
That's not true.

57
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,640
I didn't my Lord.

58
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,400
Or do you dare tell us

59
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,760
that you'll let Chuan
become Luang Wisut's other wife?

60
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,160
You don't want to say it

61
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,520
because you fear
he will prefer her over you.

62
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,880
Unlike me,

63
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,280
who is open and pleased

64
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,280
to have Chuan among us

65
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,720
because I know

66
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,440
she'll be loyal to me

67
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,840
and won't betray me like you did.

68
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,000
Is that true Chuan?

69
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,000
Yes my Lady.

70
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,480
I swear

71
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,880
I'll always be loyal to you Lady Raya.

72
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,560
I know very well

73
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,040
how being stabbed in the back

74
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,960
can hurt you.

75
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,960
Chuan.

76
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,960
I've never betrayed you.

77
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,160
I don't believe you.

78
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,560
This is the thing only you and I know.

79
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,320
That's enough.

80
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,280
Stop bickering.

81
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,160
You all are my wives.

82
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,200
And I love you equally.

83
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,799
Chuan.

84
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,559
Go to your room.

85
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,960
I prepared it for you.

86
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,200
Chuan.

87
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,120
Stop crying already.

88
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,400
I'm making you my wife

89
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,480
not trying to torture you.

90
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,680
But what you do

91
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,040
is like burning me alive.

92
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,240
Please don't be mad.

93
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,760
I did all these things

94
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,040
because I really love you.

95
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,640
I promise

96
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,600
I will take a good care of you.

97
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,200
Don't resent me.

98
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,880
No.

99
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,600
I won't be able to stop even after I die.

100
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,920
I love Bun,

101
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,960
not you.

102
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Chuan.

103
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,200
You're playing

104
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,560
with my feelings.

105
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,880
Stop crying Im.

106
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,240
I'm devastated Bun.

107
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,240
Chuan was my only friend,

108
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,880
but she thinks
I did those terrible things.

109
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,600
Why wouldn't she suspect anything
about Lady Raya?

110
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,440
Chuan really looks up to Lady Raya,

111
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,280
like we did before.

112
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,200
It's hard to convince her

113
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,760
that Lady Raya is the devious one.

114
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,720
I'll find a way to talk to her.

115
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,800
Thank you Bun.

116
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,200
Thank you so much.

117
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,640
Im. Don't do that.

118
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,720
We've been in the same boat for so long.

119
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,920
We're like family.

120
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,560
I can't let friends like you two
hate each other.

121
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,480
It's alright.

122
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,280
Im!

123
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,840
You back-stabber!

124
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,600
How dare you take Bun from me?

125
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,000
Mark my words!

126
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,800
I'll make you suffer till the day you die!

127
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
More than what I went through!

128
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,440
Look at that my Lady.

129
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,400
The Lord wouldn't let Chuan
be anywhere apart.

130
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,600
Like she's his shadow.

131
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,200
Might as well carry her around.

132
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,320
I was wrong

133
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,560
to let Chuan be my pawn.

134
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,080
Luang Wisut is more into her than Im.

135
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,560
Does it hurt my Lady?

136
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,840
They say

137
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,560
what goes around comes around.

138
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,040
You want me to suffer.

139
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,800
But no.

140
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,960
I'm actually glad that the Lord

141
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,320
is really in love with Chuan.

142
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,000
And I'll be even happier

143
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,440
if Chuan is someday pregnant
with his child.

144
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,680
Im.

145
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,000
Her child and mine

146
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,080
will be his heirs.

147
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,880
We will both be so happy.

148
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,400
Unlike you,

149
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,320
with nothing.

150
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Im!

151
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,720
Slap me all you want.

152
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,640
I won't get angry.

153
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,240
I feel more pity, since after all,

154
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,520
someone like you

155
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,200
is your own worst enemy.

156
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,120
Im!

157
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,120
I will never die by my own hands.

158
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,160
But slave wives like you lot

159
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,240
will all be dead!

160
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,360
Thong.

161
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,920
Listen to me.

162
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,960
I will get rid of those two.

163
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,520
Why are you still here crying Mi?

164
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,600
I feel bad for our girl Som.

165
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
I used to think

166
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,080
any slave who became the Lord's wife

167
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,600
was so lucky,

168
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,000
Destined with a good life.

169
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,120
But now I agree with you.

170
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,400
I also feel bad for her.

171
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,200
She not only doesn't love the Lord,

172
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,520
she even despises him.

173
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,200
Plus,

174
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,680
she values Lady Raya more than her life.

175
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,640
I understand how hurtful it is

176
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,120
to have to betray someone she looks up to.

177
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,080
I don't understand

178
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,480
how Im could do this to her.

179
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,120
I really want to kill her!

180
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,880
Don't let Chuan know that.

181
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,480
You already know

182
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,680
Chuan is angry with Im now.

183
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,800
But I think

184
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,320
Im might have her reasons.

185
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,960
What reasons?

186
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,480
She's just afraid the Lord will banish her
back to being a slave.

187
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,120
I won't ever forgive her.

188
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,560
You either.

189
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,920
You can't ever forgive Im for this.

190
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,040
Seems like you want to impress him
just like Chuan did,

191
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,360
so you went to pick Indian corks
in the middle of the night.

192
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,040
No my Lady.

193
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,960
I picked them for Chuan
because she likes them.

194
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,400
And…

195
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,480
…I'm having a child.

196
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,080
All I think about is my baby.

197
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,760
I don't have all the time

198
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,040
to think about the Lord like yourself.

199
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,160
But after all,
the Lord is still not interested.

200
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,680
Im!

201
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,760
Please don't hurt me my Lady.

202
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,760
Because if we really fight,

203
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,720
it is you who's going to lose.

204
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,600
And why is that?

205
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,520
It seems like you forgot

206
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,640
that you aren't young like me and Chuan.

207
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,400
Save your strength for chewing areca nuts.

208
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,200
-Lady Raya!
-Chuan!

209
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,400
-Stop!
-Chuan!

210
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,600
Chuan.

211
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,360
-Chuan.
-Dear.

212
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,800
I picked…

213
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,520
Did you see Chuan?

214
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,960
Isn't she in her room?

215
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,200
If she was, I wouldn't be looking around.

216
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,160
Right?

217
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,960
But.

218
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,280
What about you?

219
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,200
It's very late,

220
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,760
why aren't you asleep?

221
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,600
Go to sleep already

222
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,560
so my child will be born healthy.

223
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,200
Yes.

224
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,080
I'll go looking for Chuan.

225
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,520
-Chuan.
-Dear,where are you going?

226
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
I'll go look for Chuan. You see?

227
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,000
The rain's coming.

228
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,200
Chuan.

229
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,760
I pity you so much.

230
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,840
You took the flowers right from my hands

231
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,760
but the Lord didn't even bat an eye.

232
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,880
If I were you,

233
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,160
I'd rather jump into the river and die,

234
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,000
rather than being a sad wife
constantly ignored by her husband.

235
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,920
You've crossed the line.

236
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,240
Don't you think I'm afraid.

237
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,200
I've completely
lost faith and respect for you.

238
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,320
If you hit me, I'll hit back.

239
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,680
Let everyone see us
for what we really are.

240
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,440
Between a Lady like you

241
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,880
and a slave like me,

242
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,240
who would hit harder?

243
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,160
Im!

244
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,200
I'm so curious to know
who the Lord will choose.

245
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,640
A neglected legal wife

246
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,560
or a slave wife who's having his child.

247
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,880
I believe karma is real.

248
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,800
In no time

249
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,680
you will pay for what you did!

250
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,000
Not a chance!

251
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,319
There's only you

252
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,920
who will pay for what you did to me.

253
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,120
I won't allow these slave bitches

254
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,400
who dare outshine me to live happily.

255
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,760
I will ruin every moment of their lives.

256
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,120
I swear!

257
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,000
I hate all of you.

258
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,640
Im, you bitch.

259
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,760
Wisut, you bastard.

260
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,040
I hate them!

261
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,600
Chuan.

262
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,720
Chuan.

263
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,080
Where is she? It's about to rain.

264
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,440
There.

265
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,400
Chuan.

266
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,240
Bun.

267
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,400
The rain is coming.

268
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,840
What are you doing here?

269
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,280
You're crying.

270
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,760
Do you want me to laugh?

271
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,120
I've been betrayed and violated.

272
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,760
I've lost my loved one to another.

273
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,640
No one can take me from you.

274
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,920
I still love you.

275
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,880
Bun.

276
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,680
You love me.

277
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,800
But why are you doing this?

278
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,560
Because you belong to the Lord, Chuan.

279
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,240
Im is also his bitch!

280
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,000
Why did you hug her then?

281
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,640
You consoled her, took care of her.

282
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,840
You're wrong about her. Why?

283
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,600
You two were friends.
Why don't you trust her?

284
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,760
Because I trust only myself.

285
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,960
I believe what I see, what I hear!

286
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,160
No matter how many times she swears,
I won't believe her lies!

287
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,920
It's you!

288
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,240
Why do you believe her more than me!

289
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,680
Because I'm sure

290
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,520
Im would never hurt you.

291
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,200
It's because

292
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,400
you're leaving me for her.

293
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,280
Let's see.

294
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,040
In no time you two will end up together.

295
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,920
I bet my life on it!

296
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Impossible!

297
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,760
Because I love you.

298
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,920
Is this…

299
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,880
…your love?

300
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,560
Yes. My pure love.

301
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,280
But I can't let you be adulterated.

302
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,320
Now you're the Lord's wife.

303
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,560
Not only can I not cherish you,

304
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,600
I shouldn't even look you in the eyes.

305
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,000
It's because you love Im!

306
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,520
Father.

307
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,480
Mother.

308
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,400
If I didn't care about you,

309
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,360
I would have rather died a long time ago.

310
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,000
Im.

311
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,960
As I live,

312
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,200
I'll never ever forgive you!

313
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,840
You're crying your eyes out

314
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,760
from joy or sorrow? Tell me.

315
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,040
Tell me if you're happy or sad!

316
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,160
I'm devastated to become your wife!

317
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,720
You're sad to be mine

318
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,000
but happy to be with Bun?

319
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,600
Release me.

320
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,400
Today…

321
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,320
…I'll make you forget that bastard!

322
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,200
No!

323
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,960
Let me go!

324
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,160
Wisut! Let me go!

325
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,280
I won't let you go.

326
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,560
If I let you go,

327
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,680
you'll go back to Bun.

328
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,760
Know this. How much I love you

329
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,760
means how much I'm hurting.

330
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,240
You're my wife
but always blubber about Bun.

331
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,640
An involuntary wife whom you violated!

332
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,120
Not only did I never love you,

333
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,440
I also resent you

334
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,240
for your cruelty.

335
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,800
You didn't hesitate
to violate a defenseless one like me.

336
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,480
Chuan.

337
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,120
-Let go.
-I'm sorry.

338
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,200
Don't touch me.

339
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,840
I hate you.

340
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,920
I hate you!

341
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,040
That's enough!

342
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,800
I don't even want to see your face!

343
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,720
Go ahead. Hurt me. Kill me.

344
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
I'm not afraid anymore.

345
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,400
And I'll wish

346
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,800
that in my next life,

347
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,360
I could live happily

348
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,040
ever after with Bun.

349
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,120
But for you,

350
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,880
I wish that in every life,

351
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,600
I won't have to
tolerate your presence anymore.

352
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,880
Chuan. Get back here.

353
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,520
-Come here.
-Let me go!

354
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,040
Let go!

355
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,480
No.

356
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,920
Release me!

357
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,960
Do you realize

358
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,800
how much I love you

359
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,280
and how much I've been hurt

360
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,040
by all the things you did to me?

361
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,640
You have to forget about Bun!

362
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,600
Let me go.

363
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,920
Careful.

364
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,000
Having a fever like this,

365
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,800
you shouldn't bathe.
Rubbing with a towel is enough.

366
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,440
It's alright.

367
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,360
Let me soak a bit
to see if I'll feel better.

368
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,560
I've been feeling dizzy all day.

369
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,520
Is that right?

370
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,720
Then make it quick, I forgot something.

371
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,240
I'll be right back.

372
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,600
Yes.

373
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,560
Mi!

374
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,200
Mi!

375
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,560
The clothes were still dirty.

376
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,760
But I…

377
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,400
Mi!

378
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,040
Som!

379
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,080
Don't touch me.

380
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,360
Chuan.

381
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,560
I'm sorry.

382
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,280
No matter how angry you are

383
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,960
or how much you hate me,

384
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,240
I want to let you know

385
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,480
that I

386
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,680
love you so much.

387
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,960
My Lord.

388
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,480
My Lord.

389
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,040
My Lord.

390
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,560
Does it have to be this early Im?

391
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,200
Poor thing.

392
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,160
You must be desperate

393
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,160
the Lord wasn't with you as usual.

394
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,560
Save your breath for your old age Thong.

395
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,320
I'm not always obsessed with a man
like Lady Raya is.

396
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,680
Im!

397
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,320
Careful what you say.

398
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,520
My Lord.

399
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,320
What is it this early in the morning?

400
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,200
Um.

401
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,880
It's Som and Mi.

402
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,360
What happened to my parents?

403
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,360
Mother.

404
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,280
Father. Wake up.

405
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,840
Don't leave me.

406
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,760
Talk to me.

407
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,440
How did this happen?

408
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,120
I suppose Mi passed out and drowned.

409
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,680
Som must have run to help her

410
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,760
and slipped and hit his head on the floor.

411
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,560
Oh.

412
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,440
Poor them.

413
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,960
What have they done to deserve this?

414
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,040
What should we do now?

415
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,280
Bun.

416
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,760
Take their bodies,

417
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,760
and prepare a proper cremation.

418
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,960
Yes.

419
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,960
Don't take them from me.

420
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,320
No. Don't do that.

421
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,840
Don't take my mother away.

422
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,240
-Don't take my father away.
-Chuan.

423
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,040
Please stop crying.

424
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,000
They're in a good place now.

425
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,040
Please let Bun
handle their bodies properly.

426
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,760
Lady Raya.

427
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,640
Please don't take them

428
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,080
away from me.

429
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,680
I beg you.

430
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,080
Don't take them away.

431
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,600
Mother!

432
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,120
Mother!

433
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,080
Mother!

434
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,480
Mother!

435
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,200
Father.

436
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,800
Mother.

437
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,800
Why did you leave me so soon?

438
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,600
How can I live now?

439
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,480
Father. Mother.

440
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,760
Please take me with you.

441
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,040
Chuan!

442
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,960
Chuan! Don't do this!

443
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,680
Bun.

444
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,400
Chuan!

445
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,720
Please don't do this Chuan!

446
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,360
Let me go Bun.

447
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,320
I want to die! Let me go.

448
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,960
I want to die.

449
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,240
Chuan.

450
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,280
Are you crazy?

451
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,600
You can't do this.

452
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,760
This is the best way out for me right now

453
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,920
to forget what I've been through.

454
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,360
I want to die.

455
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,320
No Chuan.

456
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,560
Why should I continue to live?

457
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,160
I have no one left.

458
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,680
I have no father,

459
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,960
no mother,

460
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,360
no lover.

461
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,520
I have only a friend

462
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,440
who betrayed me.

463
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,120
But Im didn't do it.

464
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,320
She did! She absolutely did!

465
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,480
She and that damn Wisut

466
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,920
are the cause
of all the terrible things in my life.

467
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,840
Remember this Bun.

468
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,480
Remember this!

469
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,120
For the rest of my life,

470
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,720
I will never forgive either of them.

471
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,640
Never!

472
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,520
Chuan!

473
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,120
You didn't eat anything.

474
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,640
Are you feeling unwell?

475
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,080
I couldn't eat.

476
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,000
I feel bad for Chuan.

477
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,960
When she's sad,

478
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,440
I feel sad too.

479
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,360
I don't want to see her like this.

480
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,120
Im.

481
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,400
Did you talk to Chuan?

482
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,920
Not yet my Lord.

483
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,320
I see she is upset now

484
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,680
so I shouldn't bother her.

485
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,840
Then,

486
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,800
take care of her for me.

487
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,720
If I wasn't busy with work,

488
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,960
I would take care of her all day myself.

489
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,320
Are you going to work right away?

490
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,760
Yes.

491
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,840
I'll go and come back early for Chuan.

492
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,760
Look after her for me.

493
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,640
Yes.

494
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,880
Tuan. Did you see Chuan around?

495
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,240
No. Anything you want?

496
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,440
I can't find her.
She's not at the Lord's house.

497
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,080
She might still be upset.

498
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,400
I feel so bad for her.

499
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,560
She's been through a lot.

500
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,640
I really fear

501
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,200
she will think about suicide.

502
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,720
That's Im.

503
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,280
How dare she show her face to Chuan?

504
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,520
Good.

505
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,760
Chuan surely

506
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,000
won't let her off easily.

507
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,520
Im!

508
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,400
You backstabber!

509
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,600
Chuan. I've come to talk.

510
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,640
I won't listen to any of your words.

511
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,520
The damage you've done

512
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,960
is beyond repair.

513
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,720
Death is the only punishment.

514
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,320
Chuan.

515
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,600
Come here!

516
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,200
-Listen to me.
-No!

517
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,120
You're dead!

518
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,240
Just as I said.

519
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,320
Im is dead for sure this time.

520
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,040
Chuan!

521
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,560
Chuan!

522
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,120
Chuan. Listen to me.

523
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,280
Die!

524
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,840
Chuan.

525
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,440
Let me go.

526
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,480
You're dead!

527
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,880
Don't release her Chuan.

528
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,840
Kill her for good.

529
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,280
Chuan.

530
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,280
Let me go.

531
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,520
Im.

532
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,040
Chuan. Let go.

533
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,080
Chuan.

534
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,120
No matter how sorry you are,

535
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,400
you still have to die!

536
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,800
Stop!

537
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,000
Stop Chuan!

538
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,920
-Stay out of this!
-I can't!

539
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,920
I don't want to see you kill anyone!

540
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,560
Especially this one. Your friend.

541
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,239
She's also pregnant.

542
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,679
Then good.

543
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,080
Both of them deserve to die!

544
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,040
Chuan!

545
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,199
I had no idea

546
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,280
you could be this cruel.

547
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,320
If what I do is cruel,

548
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,720
what about the things she did to me?

549
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,120
It's goodwill.

550
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,840
Listen for once!

551
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,000
You have to know the truth
about Lady Raya.

552
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,280
Chuan.

553
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,640
She is not good like she seems.

554
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,800
Then you must be so good

555
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,080
to steal my loved one from me.

556
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,760
You tell me not to trust Lady Raya

557
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,800
but you want me to trust you?

558
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,120
And you.

559
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,040
You trust and care about her all the time,

560
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,560
despite what she did to me.

561
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,040
You must love her so much.

562
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,960
No!

563
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,160
I don't want you to be vile,

564
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,840
blind to the truth

565
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,080
and easily manipulated.

566
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,120
No one can manipulate me!

567
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,440
The only vile one

568
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,920
who ruined my life

569
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,280
is her! It's Im!

570
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,520
Chuan. Listen to me.

571
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
I've never done anything to you.

572
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,480
You're misunderstanding.

573
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,200
Liars always tell lies like this!

574
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,560
Selfish. Wicked!

575
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,160
If you're actually good,

576
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,080
you wouldn't steal my love from me!

577
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,040
And don't ever hope

578
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,680
you will live happily. It's me

579
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,080
who will be the one to ruin your life.

580
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,600
I'll become pregnant.

581
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,320
I'll be the Lord's wife.

582
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,440
I'm so curious.

583
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,560
Between you and me,

584
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,360
who will have a better life?

585
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,960
And for you.

586
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,640
From this moment on,

587
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,400
you and I

588
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,800
are done!

589
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,880
Wait. Chuan.

590
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,160
Please listen to me.

591
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,440
Im. Let her go.

592
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,760
You'll be dead for real.

593
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,040
I'm not afraid.

594
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,480
I'd rather die

595
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,640
than have her misunderstand me.

596
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,880
She hates me Bun.

597
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,880
But it will be for nothing.

598
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,440
She's not listening anymore.

599
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,080
She's full of rage and vengeance.

600
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,520
But you,

601
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,040
you must care for yourself.

602
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,520
Don't forget you're having a child.

603
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,400
Just as I thought.

604
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,320
Im! You bitch!

605
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,520
Chuan's food has been poisoned,

606
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,680
and the last meal she had

607
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,960
was made by you.

608
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,200
You're no longer my wife!

609
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,520
My Lord.

610
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,880
Not only Chuan,

611
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,760
but also your child.

612
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,320
But sweets and poisonous herbs

613
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,880
couldn't do anything to it.

614
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,200
Lady Raya.

615
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,520
Raya! You bitch!

616
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,000
I'll kill you!

617
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,440
I will have a child with the Lord.

618
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,680
My child

619
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,960
will be better…

620
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,400
NEXT EPISODE

621
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,880
…than yours, Im.

622
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,240
I won't allow it.

623
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,160
No matter how healthy their children are,

624
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,800
I'll do anything to stop them.

625
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,360
These devil children

626
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,440
will never see the light of day.

627
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,880
Congratulations.

628
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,440
Your wife is ten weeks pregnant.

629
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,360
Why are they all pregnant?

630
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,880
Why can't I? Why?!

631
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,640
They can also miscarry my Lady.

632
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,840
Not only their children,

633
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,240
I'll make sure they're all dead.

634
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,680
Blood.

635
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,920
