1
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,880
Did Im just have a girl?

2
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,040
Yes.

3
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,040
She's really, really adorable.

4
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,080
What did Bun say?

5
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,760
He's over the moon about it.

6
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,680
As expected.

7
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,080
I saw him running around helping.
He must be so excited.

8
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,080
Do you really not want to visit them?

9
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,480
Yes. I won't go.

10
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,760
Why not?
They're our subordinates after all.

11
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,080
No. Just hearing their names
has made me sick.

12
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,240
Chuan. Don't tell me
you're feeling sick too.

13
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,360
Yes.

14
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,600
I am.

15
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,200
Right after I woke up this morning,
I felt unusually nauseous.

16
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,640
Is it because you're pregnant?

17
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,800
It's possible my Lord.
I haven't bled in three months.

18
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,960
Chuan. Are you really pregnant?
I'm so glad.

19
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,280
I'm really happy.

20
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,320
Chuan.

21
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,000
Are you excited
that you're going to have a baby?

22
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,440
I'm excited my Lord.

23
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,120
Are you? I don't see your smile.

24
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,200
Are you still thinking about Bun and Im?

25
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,880
To hell with them.

26
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,840
Let's just focus on our child.

27
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,880
Well, I think

28
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,520
I'll name our child "Yim"

29
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,880
so he or she will be born
and keep smiling.

30
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,040
Unlike you.

31
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,720
No. It is said that one mustn't name
their child long before it's born.

32
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,840
I was just kidding. I know.

33
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,120
But I really want you to smile sometimes.

34
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,600
Do you have any love for me?

35
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,520
Alright.

36
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,040
I'll be the one who loves you then.

37
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,440
But I want you to know

38
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,920
that I love you the most.

39
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,000
They're all having a child.

40
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,600
Chuan miscarried once

41
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,480
but then got pregnant again.

42
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,040
Unlike me.

43
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,440
You'll have a child of your own
in no time my Lady.

44
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,760
Don't sweet-talk me.
How could I have a child

45
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,160
when Luang Wisut
doesn't even care to touch me?

46
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,040
But you my Lady,

47
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,200
are the one and only
legal wife of the Lord.

48
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,680
And what good does it do

49
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,840
when this legal wife
doesn't ever cross his mind?

50
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,440
Well. If I can't have a child,

51
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,320
then neither can Chuan.

52
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,960
I will not let her survive this time.

53
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,840
Chuan, you're dead.

54
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,640
Raya.

55
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,000
My work in Suphanburi this time
will take several days.

56
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,320
Please take care of Chuan for me.

57
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,960
Right.

58
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,880
Have a safe journey.

59
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,520
Yes.

60
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,680
Raya.

61
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,120
You don't have to worry.

62
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,720
Going to work this time, I will behave.

63
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,960
I have a lovely wife at home.

64
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,960
I have my baby waiting to see me.

65
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,800
I will not let either of you down.

66
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,760
Don't worry Dear.
I promise I'll look after Chuan

67
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,840
as good as I care of myself.

68
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,919
Thank you my Lady.

69
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,760
Thank you Raya.

70
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,200
I don't feel good about this Bun.

71
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,960
Neither do I.

72
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,360
Be careful during the time I'm gone.

73
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,800
With the Lord being away, Lady Raya
will definitely try to hurt Chuan.

74
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,160
Yes.

75
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,360
Have some more sweets.
It will make you feel better.

76
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,000
Okay.

77
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,560
Ugh.

78
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,920
Seeing you like this,
now I feel nauseous too.

79
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,480
Would you like to have some rest my Lady?

80
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,160
How could I Thong?

81
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,960
Luang Wisut left her in my care.
Even if I'm about to die,

82
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,440
I have to be here for Chuan.

83
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,560
Thong, boil her some herbal medicine.

84
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,120
As you wish.

85
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,920
Tuan. Hold her for me.

86
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,360
Let me do it my Lady.

87
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,680
If you do it,
she might actually die this time.

88
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,920
I didn't do anything
and I don't plan on hurting her.

89
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,160
I'm being sincere and truly concerned.

90
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,760
I don't believe you.

91
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,200
If you don't,

92
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,320
have Thong watch over me while I do it.

93
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,480
And if you're still skeptical,
I'll drink it myself.

94
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,240
If there is anything strange in it,
you can watch me die.

95
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,960
Let's give her a chance Chuan.

96
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,800
She just bet her life on it.

97
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,640
Thong. Go with her.

98
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,360
Yes.

99
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,560
I'll never take my eyes off of you.

100
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,200
Do you really think you're safe Im?

101
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:40,160
Hang in there Chuan.
Im will bring you the herbs in a bit.

102
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,520
Chuan! Your back!
Your skin must be burned.

103
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,720
Im! Why did you pour
the boiled herbs on her?

104
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,240
Im! Did you do it on purpose?!

105
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,160
I really didn't mean to do it Chuan.

106
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,720
I didn't mean to.

107
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,760
-Im!
-I didn't mean to.

108
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,560
-Chuan, please stop it.
-I didn't mean to.

109
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,880
Please stay out of this my Lady.
I'll make her suffer

110
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,520
far more than I did.

111
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,880
It wasn't my intension.

112
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,440
Chuan. Stop.

113
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,480
Don't do it Chuan.

114
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,640
Stop it already.

115
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,120
Don't hurt her.

116
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,560
Remember this.

117
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,760
If you hurt me, I'll hurt you more.

118
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,000
Thong. There are severe burns
on Chuan's back.

119
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,000
Hurry and treat her with some herbs.

120
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,280
Yes my Lady.

121
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,760
Why did you have to do this to us?

122
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,640
Why? Because you two
took my husband from me!

123
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,520
Perhaps it's not wrong

124
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,680
for a legal wife like me

125
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,040
to do everything in my power
to get rid of shameless mistresses.

126
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,840
Keep in mind

127
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,640
that in any of your lives,
don't ever be someone's mistress.

128
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,760
Who wants to be a mistress?
It's your husband

129
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,760
who is lustful, self-important
and likes to violate his subordinates.

130
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,120
He's mine no matter what.
You have no right to comment.

131
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,360
Then please reprimand him
instead of hurting others.

132
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,840
Oh, I forgot

133
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,320
that you don't have any say
in your marriage.

134
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,000
If you can't make your man behave,
then divorcing him

135
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,720
would be a better idea!

136
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,320
So you can have him all by yourselves?

137
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,360
My husband is a perfect man

138
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,000
who's good-looking,
rich and well-respected.

139
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,080
The only ones who don't belong here
are all of you.

140
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,200
My child.

141
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,840
If I didn't see it with my own eyes,
I wouldn't believe

142
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,480
that Lady Raya could be so vile.

143
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,040
Raya.

144
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,640
Raya.

145
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,840
Raya! I will kill you!

146
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,160
I will kill you!

147
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,000
Raya!

148
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,640
I will kill you!

149
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,360
-I will kill you.
-Now it is no wonder

150
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,560
why Thongkliao
hated her so much all this time.

151
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:30,200
I feel so bad for trusting
that Lady for such a long time.

152
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,720
What are we going to do now Im?

153
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,320
Perhaps we can't do anything Tuan.

154
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:41,560
She's the master and we are slaves.
People will always believe her.

155
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,480
I'm so worried for Chuan.

156
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,240
I'm certain Lady Raya
won't leave her alone.

157
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,080
Just thinking about it
shakes me to my core.

158
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,960
I fear for Chuan's life.

159
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,280
I keep wishing the Lord
would hurry up and come home soon.

160
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,960
He will be here to protect her.

161
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,400
I wish upon the sacred beings

162
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,440
to protect Chuan's life from any harm.

163
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:25,760
Come here Raya. I hate you. I'll kill you.

164
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,800
Who's there?

165
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,520
You will die Chuan. You will die!

166
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,960
Please let me go my Lady.

167
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,080
Not a chance. Remember
that you won't achieve anything here.

168
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,200
Release me my Lady.

169
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,600
You and the baby will die.

170
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,760
What a terrible nightmare.

171
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,320
Go take a look and see

172
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,240
-if you want anything.
-Yes father.

173
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,400
How old is this one?

174
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,200
Um.

175
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,040
Get away from me Bun. I'm annoyed.

176
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,240
Yes.

177
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,960
There's Foi Thong.
Let's look at other shops Prom.

178
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,720
-Prom.
-What?

179
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,240
Look. Who is that beautiful man.

180
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,080
Pring! You are a woman.
How could you say that?

181
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:42,640
Why not? I didn't tell anyone out loud.
I just said it to you alone.

182
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,960
A woman shouldn't say
something like that anyway.

183
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,240
So a woman needs to always stay silent?

184
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,960
Stop acting
like a boring grandmother Prom.

185
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,400
Isn't that Luang Wisut? Luang Wisut!

186
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,400
Greetings.

187
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,760
Mister Klam. What brings you here?

188
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,960
I live nearby my Lord.

189
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,640
Let me introduce Prom, my eldest daughter,

190
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,120
and Pring, my youngest daughter.

191
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,400
I'm so glad to meet you in person.

192
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,160
I've heard a lot about you from my father.

193
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,320
I told her about the time

194
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,080
I visited the rice festival
in the old capital

195
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,080
and met Luang Wisut.

196
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,360
He's handsome, well-respected

197
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,400
and incredibly brilliant.

198
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,000
-So brilliant.
-You're giving me too much credit.

199
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,280
It's not too much at all.

200
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,200
At first, when I saw you,

201
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,200
I wondered who
this good-looking man could be.

202
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,480
Pring.

203
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,720
Don't be intimidated my Lord.

204
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,280
Prom always acts like a grandmother
who keeps correcting my behavior.

205
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,840
I'm really pleased to meet you here.

206
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,600
Are you here for work?

207
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,840
Yes. But it is done, so I decided
to visit this market before going back.

208
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,280
If you don't mind, I'd like to invite you
for a meal at my place.

209
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,680
It would be an honor my Lord.

210
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,280
I don't mind at all. But…

211
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,320
I don't have much time lately.

212
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,680
Join us for a bit.
Honor me with your presence.

213
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,880
I'm really glad to meet you here.
Join us for just a bit my Lord.

214
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,000
Sure.

215
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,680
These are local dishes my Lord.

216
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm not sure if it will suit your taste.

217
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,880
It will.

218
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,480
I'm not a picky eater.
So it will be fine Pring.

219
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,480
I told you he's a good person.

220
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,960
So humble and kind.

221
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,440
Oh, I already provided food
for your subordinates my Lord.

222
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,520
I appreciate that.

223
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,160
Do you need anything else my Lord?
I'll prepare it for you.

224
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,000
It's all right. This is already
more than I can eat.

225
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,440
No no. Prom, Pring,

226
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,440
bring more food for Luang Wisut.

227
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,360
-Yes.
-But Klam,

228
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,800
I'm already full.

229
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,520
I won't allow that.

230
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,280
You grace our home with your presence.
So I have to do my best to welcome you.

231
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,040
Please, wait just a moment.

232
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,280
Father. Luang Wisut

233
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,200
is so good-looking.

234
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,440
Not just good-looking.

235
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,920
His background,

236
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,360
his wealth and his rank
make him so perfect.

237
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,880
If I could have him as my son-in-law,

238
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,840
I would be thrilled to death.

239
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,040
Don't talk about death yet.
I will be the one to grant your wish.

240
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,000
Are you serious Pring?

241
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,240
I am. But you have to help me.

242
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,680
Is there anything wrong my Lady?

243
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,920
My eye twitches.

244
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,280
Oh. Which eye my Lady?

245
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,000
Why does it matter?

246
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,560
It is said that the right one means
bad luck, and the left means otherwise.

247
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,080
So in your case, which one is it?

248
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,560
It's the right eye.

249
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,600
Thong. I have a feeling
that something bad is going to happen.

250
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,720
Ugh. Im and Chuan

251
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,240
can't possibly do anything to you.

252
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,760
I'm not afraid of those two.
But there might be someone else.

253
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,360
It looks like your follower
is really worried about you.

254
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,960
He can't sit still.

255
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,880
Hey Bun.

256
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,120
What are you standing around for?
Go have a rest. So annoying.

257
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,360
Prom. Take the man to go and rest.

258
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,360
I've prepared the room.

259
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,520
-Yes.
-Go ahead.

260
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,200
Bun. Why are you still here?

261
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,400
Get out of here! What a nuisance.

262
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,480
What happened?

263
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,080
I'm worried about the Lord.
He's a heavy drinker when he has a chance.

264
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:23,320
My father will take care of him.
Don't worry Bun. Have some rest.

265
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,280
-This way.
-Right.

266
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,760
Huh.

267
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,360
I'm so sleepy Prom.

268
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,680
Then go to sleep.

269
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,440
I'm about to go too. See you tomorrow.

270
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,800
Yes.

271
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,400
I'll be right back.

272
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,000
Excuse me.

273
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,720
How is he?

274
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,400
He's drunk and asleep Father.

275
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,240
You will have Khun Luang
as your son-in-law for sure.

276
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,120
Let's go.

277
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,200
I'll head outside. Make sure you got him.

278
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,200
Yes Father. I will.

279
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,960
You're so handsome.

280
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,320
Perhaps this is what they call
love at first sight.

281
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,920
I love you so much.

282
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,680
I'm sorry to disturb you my Lord.
I haven't seen Luang Wisut this morning.

283
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,240
Is he still asleep?

284
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,840
Possibly. I woke up early
and still haven't seen him either.

285
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,440
What happened?

286
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,520
The Lord said
he would travel back home yesterday.

287
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,880
I'm afraid that his family
will be worried if he isn't on schedule.

288
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,400
Perhaps his father and mother
would be pleased

289
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,200
that a young man like him
gets home late sometimes.

290
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,640
His parents passed away long time ago.

291
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,680
By family, I mean his wife.

292
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,040
Wife?

293
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,200
Yes.

294
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,440
I'll go wake him up.

295
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,840
Wait. No need.

296
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,240
You go get your sister.
I'll wake him up myself.

297
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,240
Yes father.

298
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,840
Um, Pring.

299
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,600
Please stop crying. I'm sorry.

300
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,640
Sorry? You're sorry and then what?

301
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,560
I am a woman.
When something like this happens,

302
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,800
my reputation is ruined.

303
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,640
And if I become pregnant,

304
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,080
what would I do?

305
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,560
I will end up being the talk of the town.

306
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,240
Father would surely be upset

307
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,480
his daughter is pregnant without a father.

308
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,000
Soon he would be stressed out
and become sick.

309
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,480
Well.

310
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,160
Please don't cross the bridge
till you come to it.

311
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,120
But it will definitely happen
if you won't take care of me.

312
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,720
Don't forget
that I was just sleeping peacefully.

313
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,480
Then you decided to violate me until…

314
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,520
…I lost what is as important as my life.

315
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,880
Oh.

316
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,880
I want to die.

317
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,560
Please stop crying Prom. I'm really sorry.

318
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,320
My name is Pring!

319
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,920
Right. Pring. I'm sorry.

320
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,160
Please calm down. Don't cry anymore.

321
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,360
Pring.

322
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,080
-Are you awake Pring?
-Prom.

323
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,320
-Prom.
-Pring.

324
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,800
Luang Wisut.

325
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,800
Luang Wisut.

326
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,160
How did something like this happen?

327
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,880
I really have no idea.

328
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,440
I remember that last night

329
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,000
I was just sitting
and having a drink with you.

330
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,320
I was so drunk.

331
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,240
I don't remember
how I got into the bedroom.

332
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,320
I don't know when you did either.

333
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,240
I just remember

334
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,560
that you advanced towards me.

335
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,840
Towards her, Luang Wisut?

336
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,240
Father.

337
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,920
I'm sorry I didn't preserve

338
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,880
the most valuable part of myself.

339
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,200
I'm despicable and deserve to die.

340
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,840
Please forgive me for what I did.

341
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,480
-No. Sit down Pring.
-Pring.

342
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,040
Sit down girl. Look at me.

343
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,520
It's not your fault.
He's the one who did this!

344
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,360
You have to be responsible for this
no matter what!

345
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,720
How do you want me to make up for this?

346
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,560
Marry Pring.

347
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,360
Marry her?

348
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,680
I can't marry her. I already have a wife.

349
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,200
You have a wife?

350
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,240
Father. I want to die.

351
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,920
What should we do now, Father?
He already has a wife.

352
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,320
You still have to.

353
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,800
If you don't, I'll tell the authorities,
and you'll be in trouble!

354
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,440
-I'm sorry.
-It's alright my sweet girl.

355
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,719
How is her wound?

356
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,239
It doesn't look good my Lady.

357
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,480
I rubbed and applied many herbs to it
but it still doesn't recover.

358
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,120
My goodness. It looks scary.

359
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,560
I think it will leave a scar.

360
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,920
It's not that bad my Lady. Just a scar.

361
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,440
It will be a good reminder
until the day I die

362
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,159
that the one who gave me this scar
is a so-called friend who betrayed me.

363
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,360
Let go for once Chuan.

364
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,280
Vengeance won't help
to make anything better.

365
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,400
I also feel bad I wasn't doing anything.

366
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,040
Im must curse me a lot these days.

367
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,440
My eye twitched all last night.

368
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,200
If she lays her hand on you,
I'll be the one to kill her.

369
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,320
Do you think she's afraid of you Chuan?

370
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,560
Look at what she did to you.

371
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,480
She's only terrified of one person.
Luang Wisut.

372
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,200
Then, right after the Lord is back,

373
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,040
I'll be the one who tells him about this.

374
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,880
Im. You're done.

375
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,920
I'm so glad you're finally back.

376
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,800
Chuan has a lot to tell you.

377
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,080
Right Chuan?

378
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,200
Yes.

379
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,640
Let's go inside.

380
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,480
Who is this Dear?

381
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,760
My name is Pring, Luang Wisut's wife.

382
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,160
His wife is standing right here.

383
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,680
His wife is standing right here. It's me.

384
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,640
His wife is Lady Raya, not you. Shameless.

385
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,280
It's you who is shameless.
Watch your mouth.

386
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,280
Luang Wisut.

387
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:37,040
Please tell this dolt I am your wife.

388
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,720
Is that true my Lord?

389
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,240
Is it true Dear?

390
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,120
It's true.

391
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
Shameless.

392
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,080
Hey! Stop!

393
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,640
-Have this too.
-Be careful! Are you still a mother?

394
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,560
Whenever it's born,
it won't look up to a father like you.

395
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,640
Chuan!

396
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,200
I'll cut your mouth open!

397
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,520
Chuan is vicious.
But she claimed to do everything for you.

398
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,320
That's exactly why I worry.

399
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,400
She used me as an excuse.

400
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,000
I'm pregnant. Are you excited?

401
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,120
Of course I am. I'm having children

402
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,640
with both you and Chuan.

403
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,680
Why do all of them keep getting pregnant?

404
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,120
Then we'll do things as planned.

405
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,480
I will absolutely get them

406
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,120
for taking away my husband.

407
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,360
