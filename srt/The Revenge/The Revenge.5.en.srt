1
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,120
Hey, Thongkliao.

2
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,280
Why are you crying?

3
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,000
You know the Lord won't be angry for long.

4
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,440
But he has never done this to me.

5
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,600
He slapped me in the face.
He almost killed me.

6
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,440
But what you did was too much.

7
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,320
You were shouting in front of his guest.

8
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,520
Why would you disrespect him like that?

9
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,560
I was jealous.

10
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,200
How could he tell other people
that he loves and admires Lady Raya?

11
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,040
Because Lady Raya is the first wife.

12
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,280
But I was here first.

13
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,360
It doesn't matter who came first.
You're a slave anyway.

14
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,200
How can you compare yourself
to the daughter of a nobleman?

15
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,680
Don't slaves have feelings?
Do slaves have to tolerate everything?

16
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,839
Hey, if that's what you think,

17
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,240
I don't know what to say to you anymore.

18
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,480
Why don't you understand who we are
and who they are?

19
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,360
You're only thinking about
crossing the line.

20
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,280
Here it is Tuan.

21
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,400
Come on Thongkliao.
Let me use the herbal ball on you.

22
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,880
Don't be stubborn Thongkliao.

23
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,680
Hey.

24
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,400
You know that the Lord

25
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,800
is a kind-hearted person.

26
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,240
If you apologize,
he'll forgive you in no time.

27
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,000
Come on. Let me put this on you.
So you'll get better and apologize to him.

28
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,840
-Ouch. Be gentle.
-Hang in there.

29
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,760
Whoa.

30
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,880
Where has the Lord gone to?

31
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,800
Maybe he was drunk and fell asleep.

32
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,080
Huh, isn't that the Lord's guest?

33
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,280
He sure is.

34
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,200
Let's see.

35
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,160
Sir, do you need anything?

36
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,720
No. I'm going home.

37
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,560
Tell the Lord for me.

38
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,760
I'm going.

39
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,960
Yes sir.

40
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,960
Where is the Lord?

41
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,360
I don't know either. Maybe he's in bed.

42
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,320
Then let's go back.

43
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,600
Ying.

44
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,240
Isn't Im with you?

45
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,480
Hasn't Im come back yet?

46
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,160
Not yet. That's why I'm waiting here.

47
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,920
You told her to put out the torch
in the house didn't you?

48
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,640
Yes, but she should have come back by now.

49
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,040
Alright, I'll go back
and check in the house.

50
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,400
I'll go with you. Wait here Ying.

51
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,640
Alright.

52
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,440
Whoa, why are you crying?

53
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,520
I'm not going to dump you.

54
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,880
-But I don't love you.
-You!

55
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,760
I love Ying.

56
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,120
Please have mercy

57
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,240
and let me go.

58
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,280
Come on.

59
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,760
You are my wife now.

60
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,800
You have to stay here and take care of me.

61
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,240
But I'm sorry for Lady Raya.

62
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,680
Please let me out of here.

63
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,920
I can't.

64
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,960
You have to stay here and take care of me.

65
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,480
As for Lady Raya,

66
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,560
I'll deal with her.

67
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,840
-Chuan.
-Im.

68
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,520
Chuan.

69
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,920
Chuan.

70
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,680
Chuan.

71
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,720
Chuan.

72
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,080
Im.

73
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,200
Im.

74
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,960
Don't tell me… that you and the Lord…

75
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,280
He forced himself on me.

76
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,720
He forced himself on me.

77
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,559
Oh, Im.

78
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,080
Im.

79
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,240
What happened Im?

80
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,240
Ying.

81
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,560
What happened?

82
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,600
Im, what happened?

83
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,120
Im, tell me. Tell me.

84
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,520
Ying.

85
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,320
I'm tainted. I'm a tainted person.

86
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,360
What do you mean Im?

87
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,080
-Im.
-Im.

88
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,120
Ying.

89
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,560
Im…

90
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,960
Im and the Lord…

91
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,160
Im.

92
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,000
-Im.
-I'm evil. I'm tainted.

93
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,200
-Im, wait for me.
-Please forgive me Ying.

94
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,560
-Goodbye.
-Im.

95
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,120
-Let me go.
-Im, stop.

96
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,960
-Don't do this.
-Let me go.

97
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,680
I'm evil and tainted.

98
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,440
I don't deserve to live.

99
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,880
I don't want to see anyone.

100
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,480
Im, listen to me.

101
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,960
You are still my woman.

102
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,480
The evil person is…

103
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,920
Luang Wisut.

104
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,360
Although he's my master,
if he's evil, I'll curse him.

105
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,840
Don't be sad.

106
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,640
I'll stay with you. I'll take care of you
til death do us part.

107
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,120
Ying.

108
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,080
It's alright.

109
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,120
I feel sorry for Im.

110
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,120
I don't understand.

111
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,960
Why does Im keep crying?

112
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,560
Being the Lord's wife is good fortune.

113
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,320
Although he is a noble,

114
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,720
Im doesn't have feelings for him.

115
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,280
She loves Ying.

116
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,400
She must be disappointed and distraught

117
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,240
that she couldn't keep her virginity.

118
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,680
But if it was me,

119
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,760
I would have
bitten my tongue to death last night.

120
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,840
If Lady Raya finds out,

121
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,640
I can't imagine what's going to happen.

122
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,960
Walls have ears.
There's no way we can keep it secret.

123
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,960
One day, sooner or later,
Lady Raya will find out.

124
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,080
Come on.

125
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,680
You knew it

126
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,760
since you first met him
that he is a philanderer.

127
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,440
But you were still willing to marry
and live with him.

128
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,480
I assumed you accepted it.

129
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,600
The only thing you have to do

130
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,880
is to win Luang Wisut's heart.

131
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,400
Remember, a man's soft spot
is his wife's goodness.

132
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,320
The better the wife is,
the more he will respect her.

133
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,480
So, you have to be calm,
respect your husband,

134
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,000
and position yourself
above all those mistresses.

135
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,000
Alright? Go back to him and remember

136
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,640
you have to win your husband's heart
with your goodness.

137
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,520
Yes father.

138
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,680
Good.

139
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,200
Luang Wisut has a lot of sugarcane.
So I brought some for you.

140
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,960
Thanks a lot my dear.

141
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,760
But the Western doctor said
my health is not so good.

142
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,480
I should avoid sugarcane juice
and all the sweets.

143
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,800
You also have to be careful.

144
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,000
If you get pregnant,
don't eat anything sweet.

145
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,680
The Western doctor said

146
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,120
sweet things are bad for pregnant women.

147
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,040
Especially if you're sick,
eating sweets can be fatal.

148
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,520
Yes father.

149
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,480
Come on.

150
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,440
I don't know if I can do what father said.

151
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,880
Anyway, the Lord won't put those women

152
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,520
above you my Lady.

153
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,680
And if you go back,

154
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,680
and you happen to get pregnant,

155
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,960
I can't wait to see
how those girls will react.

156
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,520
Yes, if only I get pregnant.

157
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,240
Are you alright Lady Raya?

158
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,720
Yes, but I'm craving something sour.

159
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,680
I feel nauseous.

160
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,480
I'll find you some sour food.

161
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,680
Walk carefully.

162
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,240
Whoa.

163
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,400
You don't look like you can walk.

164
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,120
I'll help you.

165
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,000
Walk carefully my Lady.

166
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,160
My dear Lord.

167
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,840
I apologize for crossing the line.

168
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,600
Don't you ever do it again. Otherwise,

169
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,840
I'll cane you to death.

170
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,480
Yes my Lord. I won't do that again.

171
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,560
I love you.

172
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,200
I can be anything you want me to be

173
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,520
just to stay with you.

174
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,920
Alright. You can go now.

175
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,320
Is something bothering you?

176
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,120
It's not your business.
Don't ask. It's annoying.

177
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,280
My Lord.

178
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,600
-Lady Raya has returned.
-Raya.

179
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,560
You're back. How are you?

180
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,440
She doesn't seem so good.

181
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,160
She's been craving sour food all day.

182
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,200
And she's been nauseous.

183
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,040
Thong, get some mangoes,
star gooseberries or bilimbi for me.

184
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,120
I want to eat those.

185
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,000
Yes my Lady.

186
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,960
Or… are you pregnant?

187
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,840
The Western doctor at my father's house
also said so.

188
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,000
You're pregnant? I'm so happy.

189
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,160
Raya, you're pregnant.

190
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,840
Raya my love.

191
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,400
I am so happy
that I don't know what to say.

192
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,680
We've been waiting for a long time.

193
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,480
We're going to have a child together.

194
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,080
This is why I hurried back here.

195
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,320
At first, I thought
I'd live with my father forever.

196
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,920
Raya, don't do that.

197
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,360
Don't say that.

198
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,440
You are the love of my life.

199
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,319
How can I live without my dear child

200
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,040
and wife.

201
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,280
You can live with your slave wives.

202
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,520
Raya.

203
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,240
Come on. Don't say that.

204
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,599
No matter what, you are the only one

205
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,760
that I love and respect.

206
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,480
From now on, I won't let anyone

207
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,440
displease you. I promise.

208
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,480
I'm happy for you
that you'll have a child.

209
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,240
Thank you Thongkliao.

210
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,480
I think it's a girl.

211
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,520
That's why you've been making fragrances.

212
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,520
How about you? No sign at all?

213
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,640
No.

214
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,520
Your time will come soon. Look at me,
my time to have a child has come.

215
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,880
Use it to pay respect to the Buddha image.

216
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,520
Come get one Chuan.

217
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,240
Yes my Lady.

218
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,440
-You too.
-Thank you very much.

219
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
Give this to Im too.

220
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,080
Yes my Lady.

221
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,680
For Thongkliao,
I'll give you some supplements.

222
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,840
Thong, give Thongkliao the supplements.

223
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,640
What supplements my Lady?

224
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,120
The supplements that my father
had the Western doctor prescribe for me.

225
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,440
Oh, yes my Lady.

226
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,160
Thank you. You're very kind to me.

227
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,400
I want you to be happy

228
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,160
just as I am.

229
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,400
The Lord is trying to please me a lot.

230
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,680
He carries me almost everywhere
and won't let me walk.

231
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,920
He gives me everything I want.

232
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
There he is.

233
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,640
Whoa, what is Bun carrying?

234
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,680
The Lord must have gotten those for you.

235
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,400
My dear Lord.

236
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,040
Raya,

237
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,960
I've ordered milk and meat from abroad
for you and our child.

238
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,880
Please eat a lot.

239
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,800
You don't have to pamper me this much.

240
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,640
How can I not?

241
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,160
You and our child
are the apples of my eye.

242
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,840
This is the least I can do.

243
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,760
Chuan, get the meat

244
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,040
and make Tom Jew
or anything simple for Lady Raya.

245
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,520
And Mi, get her a glass of milk.

246
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,320
Yes my Lord.

247
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,720
Wait.

248
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,800
Where is Im? I haven't seen her at all.

249
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,120
She is quite unwell.

250
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,280
Unwell? What's wrong?

251
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,920
She… has a fever.

252
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,360
Get her some medicine.
So she can recover soon.

253
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,840
Yes my Lady.

254
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,680
Raya, I think we should
go to the house and rest.

255
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,960
Yes.

256
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,280
Watch your step.

257
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,040
Why am I not the one who is pregnant?

258
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,560
I really feel bad for Lady Raya.

259
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,640
She is such a good person.

260
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,880
The one who should feel bad
is the Lord, not you.

261
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,920
I know what he did to you

262
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,520
is so hard to swallow.

263
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,640
But you have to put it aside.

264
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,520
Otherwise, the one who will suffer
the rest of your life is you.

265
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,800
Im.

266
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,160
Now the Lord doesn't care about you

267
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,280
or even Thongkliao anymore.

268
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,440
He only cares about Lady Raya
and his child.

269
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,520
Just pray

270
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,720
and ask the deity to protect you.

271
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,080
I'm very satisfied Thong.
Thongkliao deserves that.

272
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,560
I think so too.

273
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,920
I can't believe

274
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,720
that you being "pregnant"

275
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,200
has turned the world upside down.

276
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,040
The Lord doesn't even care

277
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,440
about Chuan and Im at all.

278
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,120
He really wants a child.

279
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,960
So as soon as I get him a child,
everything is settled.

280
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,200
But…

281
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,680
But what?

282
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,280
But you're not really pregnant.

283
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,760
What if the Lord finds out…

284
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,960
He'll never find out.

285
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,200
How will you hide it?

286
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,400
When you're pregnant,
your belly gets bigger.

287
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,080
How is that a problem?

288
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,280
Pregnancy can be miscarried.

289
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,720
The important question is…

290
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,800
who's to blame.

291
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,600
Nian, take this.

292
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,480
Chuan, take a break from this.

293
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,920
Lady Raya wants you to make her Tom Jew

294
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,240
Huh?

295
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,360
She's already had Tom Jew
four times this week.

296
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,280
She has morning sickness.
She may be craving something spicy.

297
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,920
Moreover, Tom Jew is good for health.

298
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,480
It's made from red onions, basil leaves,

299
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,600
tamarind sauce, lime juice, chilli.

300
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,720
They are rich in medicinal properties.

301
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,280
Should a pregnant woman

302
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,880
eat like this mom?
Spices might irritate her stomach.

303
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,320
Just do what she said.

304
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,840
-Yes.
-Why are you questioning it?

305
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,760
I'm worried about her.

306
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,360
I've never seen any pregnant women
eat like this in my life.

307
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,360
Whatever.

308
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,520
The Lord has ordered meat from abroad.

309
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,640
Meat from abroad again?

310
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,480
-Yes.
-Oh.

311
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,400
He must be so excited about his firstborn.

312
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,960
-He's trying to please Lady Raya.
-Yes.

313
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,880
Oh.

314
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,280
What's wrong Im?

315
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,720
I feel nauseous. The meat stinks.

316
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,960
Aw.

317
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,840
Im.

318
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,480
Im.

319
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,280
Do you feel better now?

320
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,880
I feel better now.

321
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,720
Im, here's water. Clean your mouth.

322
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,160
Oh.

323
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,880
What's wrong with you Im?
Normally, you have no problems with beef.

324
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,560
I don't know either.

325
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,480
Could it be…

326
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,360
What Chuan?

327
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,880
Are you pregnant?

328
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:20,360
That's not true.
I'm not pregnant. That's not true.

329
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,880
-Im.
-That's not true.

330
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,200
Im, wait for me.

331
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,520
-That's not true.
-Im, wait for me.

332
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,200
Im, where are you going?

333
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,040
Ying, I'm scared.
I don't want to get pregnant.

334
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,960
Why are you scared?
Your child is like my child.

335
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,720
A child you give birth to
will be our child.

336
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,840
Thank you Ying.

337
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,120
But I'm scared.
What if Lady Raya finds out?

338
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,120
I'll tell her I'm the father of the child.

339
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,720
She is a kind person. She won't scold us.

340
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,560
What if the Lord finds out?
What would he say?

341
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,760
He won't say anything.

342
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,320
He hasn't called you
since that day has he?

343
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,640
Stop crying Im.

344
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,280
The nightmare has passed.
After this, there're only the three of us.

345
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,240
You, me

346
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,200
and our child.

347
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,200
Thank you Ying.

348
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,680
-Ying.
-It's alright.

349
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,360
My dear Raya, you have to eat a lot.

350
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,640
So our child will be healthy.

351
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,440
Eat more.

352
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,560
My dear Lord.

353
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,560
I feel dizzy and unwell.

354
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,760
If you're sick, go get some rest.
You'll feel better.

355
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,800
If not,

356
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,600
get the herbs in the kitchen
and make a medicine. You'll get better.

357
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,560
Let's go Raya.
I think the weather is good today.

358
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,120
If we go for a walk in the morning

359
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,720
our child will be healthy.

360
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,640
-Alright.
-Let's go. Be careful.

361
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,640
Stand up slowly.

362
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,320
It serves you right.

363
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,880
You're going to be irrelevant.

364
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,680
-Tuan, you foul-mouth!
-Come on.

365
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,360
Hit me. I'll tell the Lord

366
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,440
that you are so envious of Lady Raya

367
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,840
that you have to scream like crazy.

368
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,120
I'll let you go this time.

369
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,280
Hey.

370
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,280
Raya, wait for me here.

371
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,720
-Alright.
-I'll be right back.

372
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,520
My Lady, do you need anything?

373
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,840
Bilimbi, mango, star gooseberry?

374
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,760
This morning, pickled Madan is ready.

375
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,000
If you want anything, please let me know.

376
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,640
Thank you.

377
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,600
But I don't need anything more.

378
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,160
Now my heart is filled with the happiness

379
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,080
of having this child.

380
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:14,680
I'm happy that you're happy my Lady.

381
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,320
The Lord also looks very happy
that you are having a child.

382
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,240
I can't wait to see my child.

383
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:30,000
Do you think it will look like me
or the Lord?

384
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,120
No matter who the child looks like,
I'm sure it will be a cute one.

385
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,000
Yes, because both you and the Lord

386
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,240
are good-looking.

387
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,240
The more you talk like this,
the more I want to meet my child.

388
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,120
I also can't wait to meet my child.

389
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,400
I've got flowers for you.

390
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,840
Let me put it in your hair.

391
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,640
Raya, I'm very happy.

392
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,720
I'm happy too. I'm elated.

393
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,880
It's normal in the beginning.

394
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,680
The nausea will be gone soon.

395
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,240
You sure know a lot about pregnancy Ying.

396
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,800
How can I not?
This is my wife and my child.

397
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,800
Whoa.

398
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,560
Im, here are bilimbi fruits.
I've picked them for you.

399
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,960
Thank you Chuan.

400
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,640
Are you really not going to tell the Lord?

401
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,880
No, I'm afraid he'll take my child.

402
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,800
Im has a point.
What if the Lord takes the child?

403
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,400
Maybe not.
Lady Raya is pregnant with his child.

404
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,920
He wouldn't care about Im.

405
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,680
But Im's child is his child too.

406
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,320
Would he be so heartless
and not care at all?

407
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,040
But Im hates him Mom.

408
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,000
She'd better not see him.
It's best for Im to stay in the kitchen.

409
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,680
But this can't be hidden
because Im's belly is growing every day.

410
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,320
Sooner or later,

411
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,240
the Lord will find out.

412
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,920
And it will be a big deal

413
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,400
because the Lord wouldn't let Ying

414
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,760
be the father of Im's child.

415
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,200
What did you say?

416
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,480
The Lord wouldn't let Ying
be the father of Im's child?

417
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,280
What do you mean by that?

418
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,840
I'm asking what this is.

419
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,639
No one is going to tell me?

420
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:22,080
Alright. I'll ask Im herself.

421
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,040
-Hey.
-Thongkliao.

422
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,120
-Thongkliao.
-Wait.

423
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,239
Im.

424
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,360
-Im.
-Thongkliao.

425
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,880
Are you pregnant? Are you really pregnant?

426
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,480
Yes, she is pregnant.

427
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,239
With whose child?

428
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,360
My child.

429
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,040
Why would you lie to her?
Tell her the truth

430
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,080
that she is pregnant
with the Lord's child.

431
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,560
That's not true.

432
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,840
Why would it not be?

433
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,679
Im is now the Lord's wife just like you.

434
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,920
The difference is that she's pregnant

435
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,280
but you are not.

436
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,280
Im, you stole my man.
You ungrateful sister.

437
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,400
-Im.
-Come here.

438
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,160
You betrayer.

439
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,520
-Thongkliao.
-Stop.

440
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,080
-Im.
-Don't do this to her.

441
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,920
Do you really want to
get involved in this?

442
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,920
Ouch!

443
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,840
Stay away if you don't want to die.
And you, come here.

444
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,640
Thongkliao.

445
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,040
-Thongkliao.
-Thongkliao, don't do this.

446
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,320
-Thongkliao.
-Come here.

447
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,040
-Thongkliao.
-Come here.

448
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,880
-Thongkliao.
-Die!

449
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,120
Thongkliao, stop.

450
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,680
-Don't do this.
-Stop.

451
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,320
-Stop.
-Im.

452
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,600
-Thongkliao, stop.
-Stop.

453
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,440
She stole my man. I'll teach her a lesson.

454
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,400
-Let me go.
-Stop.

455
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,320
I'll beat you to death.
So you can't seduce the Lord anymore.

456
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,400
-Stop, Thongkliao.
-Ying.

457
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,560
Im betrayed you.
Do you still love and want to protect her?

458
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,400
Because I know it's not Im's fault.
She didn't betray me.

459
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,400
-Thongkliao.
-Thongkliao.

460
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,760
Im never thought about
taking the Lord from you.

461
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,560
All of this is because
the Lord forced himself on her.

462
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,880
No! That can't be!

463
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,160
It's because she threw herself at him.

464
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,080
Come here. I'll take your life now.

465
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,360
-Don't do it.
-Stop.

466
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,960
-Stop.
-Let me go.

467
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,000
-I said let me go.
-Thongkliao.

468
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,320
I didn't mean it.

469
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,120
-Please forgive me.
-No!

470
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,560
You've crossed the line.

471
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,960
You backstabber! What a vile woman!

472
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,160
Don't ever think you'll get to be
the Lord's wife like me.

473
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,120
I'll tell Lady Raya. Let go of me.

474
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,880
Thongkliao.

475
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,480
-Thongkliao.
-Im.

476
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,800
Chuan, what should I do?

477
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,000
I want to die Chuan.

478
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,680
Raya, how are you feeling?
Do you feel better now?

479
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,240
I feel much better.

480
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,320
If it weren't for the walk,
I'd be nauseous all day.

481
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,520
You've been having morning sickness
for so long now.

482
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,640
And your stomach doesn't grow at all.

483
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,320
It may be because it's my first pregnancy.

484
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,880
I'm nauseous now.

485
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,520
-Should we go and rest inside?
-Yes.

486
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,600
Let's go. Watch your step.

487
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,480
Nice and slow.

488
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,520
Raya.

489
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,160
Stop. Do you know

490
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,160
the Lord is with Lady Raya?

491
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,640
I know but I have something to tell Raya.

492
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,800
What is that?
What does a person like you have to say?

493
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,360
-Get out of my way.
-No.

494
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,800
-I said get out.
-What's your problem?

495
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,040
You know the Lady is with the Lord
and you still want to go inside.

496
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,360
-That's Thong and Thongkliao.
-You're shameless.

497
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,120
It's like you can't live without a man.

498
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,240
None of those who said that to me
died well.

499
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,840
Ouch!

500
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,920
What's happening?

501
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,120
What's happening?

502
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,640
Ouch! My Lady.

503
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,000
Why did you hit her?

504
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,400
I have something to tell you
but she wouldn't let me in.

505
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,440
What's the matter?

506
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,600
It's about the Lord and Im.

507
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,520
What about them?

508
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,480
The Lord took Im as another wife

509
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,480
and she is now pregnant.

510
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,720
Pregnant?

511
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,880
My dear…

512
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,800
Raya, wait. Listen to me.

513
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,520
No one sees

514
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,040
the goodness and generosity
that I gave them.

515
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,640
Wait and see.

516
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,160
Im will bring misfortune and disaster.

517
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,360
A good person like Lady Raya

518
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,560
shouldn't suffer because of me.

519
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,000
The Lord should learn
what it's like to be hurt

520
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,160
so he would think twice
before hurting others,

521
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,680
especially his wife.

522
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,960
How are my child and my wife?

523
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,000
The child is gone.

524
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,240
I'm so evil. I killed my own child.

525
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:15,160
