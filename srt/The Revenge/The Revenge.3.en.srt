1
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,600
Luang Wisut belongs with Lady Raya.

2
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,160
He's mine!

3
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,760
Thongkliao can give me what you can't.

4
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,840
I have a sense of shame,

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,920
so I wouldn't do it out in the open.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,640
I hope Thongkliao is his last mistress.

7
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,960
I will turn love to disgust.

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,040
Let it be known.

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,080
I become vicious
when I meet the despicable.

10
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,960
I sympathized with Thongkliao
in the beginning.

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,720
But now,
I think what she's doing is not right,

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,440
especially to Lady Raya.

13
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,280
She's a good person.

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,240
Thongkliao shouldn't
have done this to her.

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,960
If Thongkliao

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,200
is going to steal the Lord
and hurt Lady Raya,

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,080
karma will get her.

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,880
Don't you worry about that.

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,680
Did Raya really send a letter to me?

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,880
Yes my Lord.

21
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,080
It looks like my son-in-law
is quite something.

22
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,680
Take this to Raya.

23
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,160
Yes my Lord.

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,600
Be careful. Don't let anyone see it.

25
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,880
And tell her, when I am free from duty

26
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,480
I'll visit her.

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,400
Yes my Lord.

28
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,280
Hurry up. She must be waiting.

29
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,920
Raya, I am going to the city to work.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,880
When will you be back?

31
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,840
In a couple of days.

32
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,320
Lady Raya!

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,200
What's the matter Thong?
Why are you shouting?

34
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,720
Well…

35
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,040
I asked Thong to find me some herbs.

36
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,080
I've been feeling unwell lately.

37
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,600
Thong, go make the medicine for me.

38
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,920
Yes my Lady.

39
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,560
Are you… pregnant?

40
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,720
Well…

41
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,760
No, Luang Wisut.
I had my period this month.

42
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,480
It's alright. If it's meant to be,
a child will come.

43
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,160
Yes.

44
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,640
You should go now.
Please hurry back when you finish.

45
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,080
Alright.

46
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,640
What's the matter?

47
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,360
Raya.

48
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,440
Please take care of Thongkliao.

49
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,080
If she does something wrong,

50
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,000
teach her. So she won't do it again.

51
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,480
Alright.

52
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,080
Please hurry back Bun.

53
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,880
You've told me a hundred times.

54
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,400
It's because I'm worried about you.

55
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,200
And keep an eye on the Lord.

56
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,880
Don't let him flirt with any girls.

57
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,960
You sound like his wife.

58
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,800
I'm worried about Lady Raya.

59
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,720
Chuan, you know we are just servants.
We can't stop him.

60
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,120
Anyway, I'll try.
If he is involved with a girl,

61
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,280
I'll pretend to be interested in her.
Maybe she'll be interested in me.

62
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,080
Bun!

63
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,200
May goodness be with you.

64
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,560
Who is that?

65
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,720
It's Chuan,
Uncle Som and Aunt Mi's daughter.

66
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,920
The one said to be old enough
to take over Mi's cooking?

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,840
Yes my Lord.

68
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,400
Oh, she's all grown up, isn't she?

69
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,280
My dear Lord.

70
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,240
Please hurry back. I'll miss you.

71
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,640
I'll hurry back. I'll miss you too.

72
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,000
I'll take very good care of you,
Thongkliao.

73
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,600
Ouch!

74
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,200
My Lady, what's wrong?

75
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,920
I…

76
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,360
I'm afraid that when Luang Wisut
is back from the city,

77
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,120
he'll have another wife.

78
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,480
Really? A woman from the city?

79
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,280
No.

80
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,280
Then who is she?

81
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,400
Please tell me
who this shameless woman is.

82
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,840
I don't know how to say it.
But… you should know.

83
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,640
What should I know?

84
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,080
Well…

85
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,240
It looks like
Luang Wisut likes Im and Chuan.

86
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,280
I didn't want to alarm you,

87
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,520
but on the day they cleaned your room,

88
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,000
he gave them a lot of Sbai
and breast cloths.

89
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,200
Chuan and Im.

90
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,320
Also, before he left for the city,

91
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,320
he seemed upset to be away from them.

92
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,120
I don't want to say this.
But if you and I were not here,

93
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,440
by now, he would…

94
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,120
Chuan, Im, you're dead!

95
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,320
Thongkliao.

96
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,840
What are you doing?

97
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,600
I'm getting a knife
to stab those shameless women.

98
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,280
Don't do it.

99
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,840
Those two are stealing our husband.
Why are you stopping me?

100
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,840
I don't want this to be a big deal.

101
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,320
Think about it. If they died,

102
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,120
Luang Wisut would kill you too.

103
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,560
And after that, he'd have another wife.

104
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,320
He wouldn't mourn for you much.

105
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,720
Calm down Thongkliao.

106
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,480
Are you feeling better now?

107
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,120
Thank you for talking some sense into me.

108
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,320
Otherwise, I would have killed them.

109
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,200
Forget it.

110
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,680
If he has Im and Chuan as his other wives,

111
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,680
even if we hurt, we have to tolerate it.

112
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,520
I wouldn't mind if it was someone else.

113
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,000
But those two are like my sisters.

114
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,400
I can't accept
sharing a husband with them.

115
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,040
How would you stop him?

116
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
I can't stop him.

117
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,720
But I can stop those two.

118
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,760
Really?

119
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,080
Yes.

120
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,360
If you can really do that,

121
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,160
that would be good for me too.

122
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,960
I really mean it Thongkliao.

123
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,080
I can only let him have you

124
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
because you were here before me.

125
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,160
If it's someone else,

126
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,040
I would be suffering to death.

127
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,280
Those shameless women.

128
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,640
Despite having their own lovers,
they still try to seduce the Lord.

129
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,240
Don't worry my Lady. Apart from us two,

130
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,080
I won't let the Lord have any more wives.

131
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,760
Whoever thinks about stealing our husband

132
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,120
has to die.

133
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,120
It seems like Thongkliao
is easily provoked.

134
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,400
She totally believed you.

135
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,560
Foolish people always fall
into a smart person's trap,

136
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,920
especially a lustful woman
like Thongkliao.

137
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,200
Go to the kitchen tomorrow.
Let me know when they start fighting.

138
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,960
Yes my Lady.

139
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,320
I'll be in the kitchen
early in the morning.

140
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,040
This is for you.

141
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,760
Thank you very much.

142
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,680
Shameless women who like to be mistresses
are a good match for a wife like me.

143
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,400
Hurry up. It's late.
Lady Raya must be hungry.

144
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,680
Alright.

145
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,320
Here you go. Hurry up.

146
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,560
Hurry up.

147
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,160
Tuan,

148
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,280
Im and I will wash these cloths.

149
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,040
What cloths do you have to wash now?

150
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,560
The cloth that Lady Raya gave us.

151
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,640
After washing

152
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,160
I think I'll dry them with Ylang-Ylang
and jasmine, so they'll smell good.

153
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,680
You're obsessed.

154
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,160
A little bit Tuan.

155
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,800
Lady Raya's cloths are so good.

156
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,400
The Lady is so kind for thinking about us.

157
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,240
Of course, a high-class woman

158
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,240
is beautiful inside and out,

159
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,440
unlike someone who's over-ambitious.

160
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,200
Getting all puffed-up when they luck out.

161
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,640
Remember, these kind of people

162
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,440
will soon be in trouble.

163
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,480
Who are you talking about Thong?

164
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,920
No one. Whoever wants to take it
can take it.

165
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,960
Looks like she doesn't
want to die peacefully.

166
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,440
-What are those cloths?
-They're Sbai and breast cloths.

167
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,000
-Let me see them.
-Just normal Sbai and breast cloth.

168
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,600
Why do you want to see them?

169
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,040
If they're normal cloths,
what is there to hide? Give them to me.

170
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,080
I said give them to me.

171
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,280
My Lady. My Lady!

172
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,600
Are they fighting now?

173
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,320
Yes my Lady. I saw Thongkliao.

174
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,600
She looks very angry.

175
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,360
Let's go and watch.

176
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,480
-Let me see them.
-No. Let me go Thongkliao.

177
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,360
They're just normal cloths.
Why do you want to see them?

178
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,160
-It's my business. Give them to me.
-No.

179
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,080
-Give them to me.
-No, let me go.

180
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,240
Thongkliao, why do you want to see them?

181
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,240
Give them back to Chuan and Im.

182
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,480
They're just normal breast cloths
and Sbai.

183
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,520
If they're normal cloths,
what is there to hide?

184
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,840
The Lord gave them to you, right?

185
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,640
No. It's Lady Raya who did.

186
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,760
Don't lie to me. I know everything.

187
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,480
Don't ever think
you'll use cloth from the Lord.

188
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,800
Are you crazy?

189
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,600
They're trying to seduce him.

190
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,600
Who's doing that? You're crazy.

191
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,680
It's you.

192
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,800
-Ow!
-Chuan.

193
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,320
-Chuan.
-Are you trying to seduce him?

194
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,320
Thongkliao.

195
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,680
Don't you think I won't fight back.
I also have functioning limbs!

196
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,320
Chuan, you're dead.

197
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,680
-Ouch!
-Stop!

198
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,520
Thong, I'm satisfied.

199
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,200
Shameless women fighting one another.

200
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,440
But they deserve even more than this.

201
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,080
Thongkliao, stop.

202
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,200
-Stop!
-Chuan!

203
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,120
-Chuan!
-Stop!

204
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,160
Stop. Don't fight.

205
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,080
Stop.

206
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,160
My Lady.

207
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,840
My Lady,

208
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,360
please whip me.

209
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,280
It's my fault. I didn't mean it.

210
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,280
Please whip me instead.

211
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,920
Please don't do it to Chuan.

212
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,080
I'm the cause of it all.

213
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,880
Please whip me, my Lady.

214
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,440
It's my fault for crossing the line.

215
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,440
I do apologize.

216
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,560
It's alright.

217
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,440
It's worth getting hurt

218
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,360
if that makes you stop fighting.

219
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,480
My Lady, how are you? Does it hurt?

220
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,960
A little bit.

221
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,960
But I shouldn't have miscalculated.

222
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,440
What do you mean?

223
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,400
Think about it.
What would happen if I bled?

224
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,480
I should have waited longer
before barging in.

225
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,240
Do you mean this was all your plan?

226
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,160
Damn right. Getting myself hurt
for nothing would be foolish.

227
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,360
But that was worth it.

228
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,120
Thongkliao must be getting chewed out
by the other slaves now.

229
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,600
Soon she'll be an outcast
and no one will want her.

230
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,720
My Lady is so brilliant.

231
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,760
She's getting a taste of her own medicine.

232
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,960
How did Thongkliao turn into this?

233
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,680
Right? I'm really sorry for Lady Raya.

234
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,600
She got hurt accidentally

235
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,600
but she didn't complain at all.

236
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,440
That's what it's like
to be the first wife.

237
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,160
She's not a slave like Thongkliao.

238
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,440
And I told you
not to mess with Thongkliao.

239
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,600
-You didn't listen to me. Look at you now.
-Hey.

240
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,040
I've learned my lesson. From now on

241
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,560
I don't care anymore

242
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,920
if she lives or dies.
I will protect Lady Raya.

243
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,839
I won't let Thongkliao do anything to her.

244
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:16,119
Me too. The Lord deserves
a high-class woman like Lady Raya,

245
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,280
not a slave like Thongkliao.

246
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,160
If the Lord comes back
and sees Lady Raya's face like that,

247
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,280
I dread to think what will happen to us.

248
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,600
I've brought a good type of rice.
You can try planting it.

249
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,560
Tuan, get some water for the Lord.

250
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,760
Yes my Lady.

251
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,560
Raya.

252
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,440
Raya.

253
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,920
What's wrong?

254
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,520
Nothing.

255
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,400
Raya, let me see you.

256
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,200
What happened? Who did this to you?

257
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,280
Nothing.

258
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,000
Nothing? Then why is there
a handprint on your face?

259
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,280
Tell me.

260
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,000
Lady Raya, you should tell him.

261
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,440
My dear Thong, I'm fine.

262
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,560
Thong, what do you know? Tell me now.

263
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,360
It's Thongkliao, Chuan and Im.

264
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,080
Bring me those three slaves.

265
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,320
Yes my Lord.

266
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,360
My dear Lord, you're back.
I've missed you.

267
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,240
Why did you do that?

268
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,720
What did you do to Lady Raya
while I was away?

269
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,320
Luang Wisut, no one did anything to me.

270
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,600
Don't blame them.

271
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,880
I do.

272
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,880
If it's wrong, there's a consequence.
Otherwise, they will be spoiled.

273
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,760
How can you hit Lady Raya?
Bun, get me the stick.

274
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,480
My dear Lord.

275
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,520
I didn't mean it. It was an accident.

276
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,360
What accident?

277
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,840
I had a fight with Chuan and Im.

278
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,200
Lady Raya came to stop us

279
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,160
and she got hit accidentally.

280
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,560
And you, what did you fight over?
Why did you have to hit each other?

281
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,520
Tell me.

282
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,160
We had a little misunderstanding.

283
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,800
But anyway,

284
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,960
it was because
I love you with all my life.

285
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,720
I didn't mean to hurt Lady Raya.

286
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,000
My Lady, I apologize.

287
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,000
How about you Im?

288
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,640
I didn't mean to do it.

289
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,080
I apologize again, my Lady.

290
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,960
So, you are Chuan.

291
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
Yes my Lord.

292
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,120
How about you?

293
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,160
I didn't mean to do it either.
I apologize again, my Lady.

294
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,360
Raya,

295
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,400
none of them meant to do it.
What do you say?

296
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,840
I told you from the beginning
that I'm alright.

297
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,080
That's good then.

298
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,840
From now on,
you have to be careful.

299
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,920
Don't do this again.
Otherwise, don't say I didn't warn you.

300
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,920
Yes my Lord.

301
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,880
My dear Lord, are you tired?
Let me give you a massage.

302
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,240
Chuan, I remember your cooking.

303
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,720
From this trip to Phra Nakhon,
I've got vermicelli from Sampeng.

304
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,680
Can you make me crispy noodles?

305
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,400
Yes my Lord.

306
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,200
Wait.

307
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,600
Let me see your hand

308
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,920
if it's clean enough to cook for me.

309
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,200
I've seen it. It's clean.

310
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,880
You can go.

311
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,280
It's like I said.

312
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,560
These slaves are fast.

313
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,160
At first, Chuan acted innocent.

314
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,440
She was looking at the floor.
But when the Lord touched her hand

315
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,360
she got goosebumps.
Well, I think she is now

316
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,160
excited on the inside, waiting for him

317
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,800
to call her to serve him.

318
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,400
My Lady, you have to tame her.

319
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,160
You go and watch. Let me know
if there's something suspicious.

320
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,440
Yes my Lady.

321
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,440
Do your best,
so the Lord will be satisfied.

322
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,800
Alright, Mom.

323
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,560
Well, Mi.

324
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,600
Do you want the Lord
to take a liking to Chuan?

325
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,800
It's just for cooking Thong.

326
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,360
We are slaves.
We do whatever pleases our master.

327
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,440
That's good then.

328
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,720
I thought

329
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,520
you were telling her to be ambitious

330
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,640
and aim to be the Lord's wife
like Thongkliao.

331
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,560
Whoa Thong.
I wouldn't dare think about that.

332
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,360
That's good.
It's good that you don't think about that.

333
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,160
Chuan is my woman.

334
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,080
I've been thinking about telling the Lord

335
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,040
that I want Chuan to move in with me.

336
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,840
That's good.

337
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,920
You should tell him
that you want to live together.

338
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,400
I feel bad for Lady Raya.

339
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,400
It hurts. She's been suffering

340
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,800
because of Thongkliao.

341
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,280
Chuan, have you finished cooking?
So I can bring them the food.

342
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,720
It's almost ready.

343
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,760
What have you been doing?

344
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,720
You've been talking to me.

345
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,600
Crispy noodles are ready my Lord.

346
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,080
It looks delicious.

347
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,240
Let's try it. I'll feed you.

348
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,800
Chuan's cooking is really good.

349
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,840
She really did her best.

350
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,880
Where is she now?

351
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,320
Well…

352
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,880
She's working in the kitchen.

353
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,240
Mi, take this money.

354
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,480
Give it to her and tell her
it's a reward from me.

355
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,000
Thank you very much my Lord.

356
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,800
Tell her to cook for me again.

357
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,560
And cook for Lady Raya

358
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,040
to give alms to the monks too.

359
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,000
And you're old. You should rest.

360
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,480
Thank you for your kindness my Lord.

361
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,920
Im, you too.

362
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,600
You should work in the kitchen as well.
I want to try your cooking.

363
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,360
Yes my Lord.

364
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,880
The Lord really gave me this money?

365
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,840
It's true. Here it is. Take it.

366
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,960
Actually,

367
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,080
he's wanted you to work in the kitchen
for Mi for a long time.

368
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,080
But your mom didn't want to stop.

369
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,720
Well… I have to stop now.

370
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,360
Look. The Lord is so very kind.

371
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,800
Tomorrow, I'll cook for Lady Raya
to give alms to the monks.

372
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,320
I'll do my best.

373
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,320
Good.

374
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,360
Let me help too Chuan.

375
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,520
Alright.

376
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,080
My Lady,

377
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,920
we've prepared everything for the alms.

378
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,840
My Lady,

379
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,680
please allow me to give money
to make merit too.

380
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,800
Won't you keep it for yourself?

381
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,400
Living here,
I don't need the money for anything.

382
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,160
It's better to make merit for good karma.

383
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,840
It's good that you make merit.

384
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,880
You'll be comfortable in the next life.

385
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:11,520
For me, living under you and Lady Raya

386
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,680
is the best thing already.

387
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,360
You are grateful.

388
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,960
Let's go.

389
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,480
You're overreacting because your master
is kind to you. You don't know your place.

390
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,360
You're the one
who doesn't know your place.

391
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,960
-Damn you Chuan.
-Don't do it. I'm scared.

392
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,160
Let's go make merit.

393
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,400
If we're here for any longer,
Thongkliao will kill us.

394
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,960
What are you looking at?

395
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,720
You want to try me?

396
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,240
Long life, beauty, happiness and strength.

397
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,280
The Lord is interested in those two?

398
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,120
They are young fresh women.

399
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,240
How can you and I
compete with their youth?

400
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,280
It's probably not the two of us

401
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,040
because I'm confident
that I'm still young,

402
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,280
beautiful and fit.

403
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,400
What do we do now?

404
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,280
I've heard that Chinese merchants
are selling Chamob.

405
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,280
What is Chamob?

406
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,040
Female ghosts who died in the woods
and possess the area where they died.

407
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,640
They have strong vengeful spirits.

408
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,760
Women who own Chamob

409
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,720
will be blessed by charming spells.

410
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,680
All the men will fall head over heels.

411
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,080
If so, should we buy Chamob
from these Chinese merchants?

412
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,720
We shouldn't.

413
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,080
Even though it's a charm,
it's also a misfortune.

414
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,640
No good people would use those things.

415
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,160
It would be embarrassing.

416
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,040
Thongkliao,

417
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,960
I think we both have to give up

418
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,560
and let him have Im and Chuan
as mistresses.

419
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,360
I can't accept this by any means.

420
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,800
Bun, if you have a chance,

421
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,120
don't forget to tell the Lord about us,
and also Im and Ying.

422
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,200
Alright. Don't worry Chuan,
I'm planning to tell him.

423
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,880
Okay. I'll go now. See you in the evening.

424
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,360
Alright.

425
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,960
I'm going to work now.

426
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,040
Alright.

427
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,240
My dear Lord.

428
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,640
Please hurry back. I'll miss you.

429
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,680
Why would you miss me?
I'll be back in the evening.

430
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,600
When you're out of my sight,
I miss you so much I could die.

431
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,320
You're always like this.

432
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,680
I'll hurry back then.
I don't want you to suffer.

433
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,280
I love you with all my life.

434
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,680
I'll hurry back.

435
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,880
You should go to work now.

436
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,400
-Alright.
-I'll walk you there.

437
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,240
Please hurry back.

438
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,800
My Lady, do you think
that the Lord still loves me?

439
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,960
I guess so.

440
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,960
It means my youth and beauty still work.

441
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,080
But to make sure,

442
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,160
I'll do everything to steer him away
from Chuan and Im.

443
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,680
My Lady, look at Thongkliao.

444
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,600
She can't ridicule me for long.

445
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,360
A slave like her will be in trouble.

446
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,560
Eh.

447
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,159
Hey.

448
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,639
Where is Thongkliao rushing to?

449
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,840
Huh?

450
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,360
Follow her and see Chuan.

451
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,840
Should I? She hates me.

452
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,800
We may fight again.

453
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,760
I'm afraid she'll put Lady Raya
in danger.

454
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,520
Then I'll go and see.

455
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,760
If Im goes, I'll go too.

456
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,239
I'll go too. Let's go.

457
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,680
What is Thongkliao waiting for?

458
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,120
It looks like she's waiting for someone.

459
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,000
Is she having an affair?

460
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,120
Tuan, what are you talking about?

461
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,880
Isn't it true? You do know

462
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,240
that she's fast about these things.
Now that the Lord is away,

463
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,160
she may be so starved
that she needs a fix from another man.

464
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,480
I don't believe it.

465
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,440
Thongkliao may be a vile person,

466
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,800
but she wouldn't be that promiscuous.

467
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,800
I don't believe it either.

468
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,960
Well, wait and see.

469
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,280
Look. I see who Thongkliao is waiting for.

470
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,240
It's just a Chinese merchant.
There's nothing.

471
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,800
But Thongkliao looks suspicious.

472
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,960
There's nothing. Let's go back.

473
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,560
Let's go.

474
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,280
Hey, do you sell Chamob?

475
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,960
Chamob?

476
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,920
Oh. Yes I do.

477
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,840
Well, you're lucky.

478
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,880
I've just got the Chamob

479
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,720
from a city that's famous
for charming spells.

480
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,720
Really?

481
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,520
Yes.

482
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,880
This thing doesn't come often.

483
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,640
It's rare to find a woman
dying unnaturally in the woods

484
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,440
whose spirit possesses a log

485
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,360
that we can use to make Chamob.

486
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,240
Then give me one.

487
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,280
It's expensive.

488
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,640
How much? I'll buy it anyway.

489
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,360
Here it is.

490
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,200
Oh, is this Chamob?

491
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,720
It gives you charms.

492
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,160
Hide it in your hair.

493
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,720
I guarantee your husband
will fall head over heels for you.

494
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,960
He'll never have mistresses.

495
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,160
Give it to me.

496
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,680
Money first.

497
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
You fell for it Thongkliao.

498
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,360
Hey.

499
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,480
Whoa. I was scared.

500
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,840
Wow, what a performance. That's yours.

501
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,240
Wow.

502
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,200
I'm so lucky today. I got a lot of money.

503
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,280
What did you give to that woman?

504
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,760
A real Chamob?

505
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:57,320
Whoa. What is Chamab? Samob? Chamob?
I've never heard of it.

506
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,560
I just heard about it
for the first time when you hired me.

507
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,720
But what is it?

508
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,040
It's just a wood carving
of a woman hugging a man.

509
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,560
But she totally believes it.

510
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,320
Maybe now she's sticking it on her hair
hoping her husband will love her.

511
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,440
Thong.

512
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,720
Do you want a Chamob
to use with your husband?

513
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,320
Go away! Go!

514
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,920
-Do you want some?
-Get going!

515
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,200
Did you see, Thong?

516
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,920
Foolish people always fall
into a smart person's trap.

517
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,200
Fool.

518
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,320
NEXT EPISODE

519
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,280
An insolent one like you
will face me, a servant.

520
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,400
Chuan!

521
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,120
If you would let me,

522
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,480
I will have only Chuan.

523
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:00,320
I will do everything
to get her out of this place.

524
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,040
It's like heaven's decrees
prevent you from marrying.

525
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,120
I'm worried.

526
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,880
