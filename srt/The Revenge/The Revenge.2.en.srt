1
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,120
Thank you for always taking care of me.

2
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,640
It's because I love you so much.

3
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,360
I love you too.

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,200
As far as I know, most of the girls here

5
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,439
eventually become his mistresses.

6
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,840
Not only in this house.

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,040
I'll get my parents to come
and ask to marry you.

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,000
PREVIOUSLY

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,720
I don't want you to get married!

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,520
Listen to me! This goody-two-shoes lady
is stealing my man!

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,800
Whip her. Don't stop until she dies.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,160
My Lord! You can't do this to me!

13
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,840
Easy, Thongkliao.

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,320
Enough.

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,879
This is him being merciful.

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,240
Get off me.

17
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,160
-Here's some water.
-I don't want it!

18
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,920
Thongkliao! Get some sleep for once.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,440
I'll bring food and drinks again tomorrow.

20
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,000
Let's go. Leave her alone.

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,640
Maybe she'll contemplate what she did.

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,360
I'm not giving up.

23
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,560
I don't care if I die.
I'll get my man back!

24
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,360
When was he your man? Luang Wisut…

25
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,640
belongs with Lady Raya.

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,280
He's mine!

27
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,720
He's mine!

28
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,240
I won't let anyone have him!

29
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,320
I won't!

30
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,840
It's exactly what I thought, isn't it?

31
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,320
Lady Raya moving in would cause a ruckus.

32
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,360
Thongkliao is delusional.

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,440
But I feel bad for her.

34
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,960
She just assumes she came first.

35
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,680
Being just a mistress,

36
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,800
she's nothing compared to a lady.
Imagine being a lawful wife

37
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,000
and some girl shows up
shouting the Lord is hers.

38
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,200
What would you do?

39
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,600
Fight back, perhaps.

40
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,560
I wouldn't let it slide either.
But I wouldn't blame the girl.

41
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,880
I would blow up at my husband
and put his junk

42
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,080
in this rolling machine,
and obliterate it all.

43
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,200
Want to try?

44
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,760
No, Chuan.

45
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,480
Best be careful Bun.

46
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,960
And you. When you two end up together,

47
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,440
just do as you said,
instead of catching mistresses.

48
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,520
But, to be fair,

49
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,520
Thongkliao isn't even a mistress.
Just a servant.

50
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,720
Why is a servant messing with the masters?

51
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,040
That's true.

52
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,480
If you want to do anything,

53
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,680
you have to think of others sometimes.

54
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,600
Don't just do as you please.

55
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,640
A wife like Lady Raya being this merciful

56
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,320
deserves a lot of respect.

57
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,920
My Raya.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,600
You are so kind. I am grateful.

59
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,960
I did it for you.

60
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,920
I just want you to be happy.

61
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,560
Also,

62
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,440
Thongkliao has been with you before me.

63
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,520
Oh Raya.

64
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,200
Don't take her words seriously.

65
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,480
She is just a servant.

66
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,200
Then promise me.

67
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,920
Don't let this happen again.

68
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,040
I promise.

69
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,440
If you're still upset,

70
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,560
I'll give you some space.

71
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,360
Sweep right there.

72
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,280
-That one too.
-Bun.

73
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,880
Hey.

74
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,640
How's Thongkliao?

75
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,280
Tuan said she refuses to eat anything.

76
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,240
She just keeps crying.

77
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,440
Damn it.

78
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,360
No need to be upset my Lord.
She'll come to terms with it.

79
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,880
I don't want blood on my hands.

80
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,600
She's also my lover as well.

81
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,000
But she's gone too far, shouting at Raya.

82
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,120
I don't intend to leave her anyway.

83
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,840
Hey. Keep a lookout for me.

84
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,640
-I will go see Thongkliao.
-Yes my Lord.

85
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,360
I will go see with my own eyes.

86
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,440
You're dead Thongkliao.

87
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,480
Thongkliao.

88
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,760
My Lord. It's really you.

89
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,880
How are you doing?

90
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,320
My love.

91
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,480
Just looking at your face
all my pain is gone.

92
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,280
I'm so sorry…

93
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,720
for hurting you.

94
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,600
But you've disrespected Lady Raya.

95
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,560
It's because I'm jealous.

96
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,880
I love you and want you all for myself.

97
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,320
And did I leave you?

98
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,840
But what you did
is worse than abandoning me.

99
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,680
Did you know?

100
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,560
It feels like being stabbed
hundreds of times all over my body,

101
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,440
except that

102
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,480
my heart is still beating for you.

103
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,720
I'm really sorry.

104
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,840
I'll send someone to unchain you.

105
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,720
Go wait for me by the pond.

106
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,920
Yes my Lord.

107
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,440
Oh dear.

108
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,200
Lady Raya saw him with Thongkliao.

109
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,440
What will happen next?

110
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,760
I have no idea.

111
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,240
But I feel so bad for Lady Raya.

112
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,720
Being married for just one day,
her husband is already having an affair.

113
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,679
Hey. Don't talk bad about your master.

114
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,919
But what he did is wrong.

115
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,320
I can't praise him right now Tuan.

116
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,080
He's given a chance to marry a lady

117
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,480
from a family of respected lords.

118
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,400
But he doesn't honor her at all,

119
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,800
just always being lustful.

120
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,240
Yes.

121
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,480
Both of you.

122
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,480
My Lord.

123
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,440
I missed you.

124
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,080
My Lord.

125
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,720
Why did you have to be so cruel to me?

126
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,320
My body and soul were in constant pain

127
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,200
right after you brought Lady Raya in.

128
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,000
You know she's from a noble family

129
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,960
and I needed her to advance my career.

130
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,920
Poor thing.

131
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,920
But I'm still so afraid

132
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,840
that you will love your wife
more than this loyal servant.

133
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,320
How could I?

134
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,200
To be perfectly honest,
when it comes to bedroom skills,

135
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,800
she has nothing on you.

136
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,960
Really my Lord?

137
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,960
If you already know
that you're better than her,

138
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,720
she will leave you alone.

139
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,880
Just bear with her so I can be happy.

140
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,480
Okay my Lord.

141
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,960
There you are dear.

142
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,440
I have been looking for you.

143
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,720
You know she's from a noble family

144
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,960
and I needed her to advance my career.

145
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,880
To be perfectly honest,
when it comes to bedroom skills,

146
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,040
she has nothing on you.

147
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,120
Raya.

148
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,360
Raya.

149
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,720
I felt bad for Thongkliao.

150
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,560
So I went to check.

151
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,760
Oh dear.

152
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,520
You must be afraid I'll get upset,

153
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,280
so you went all the way to the lotus pond.

154
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,560
Look at you. You're all sweaty.

155
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,040
The wounds must be hurting.

156
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,600
Come. Let me wipe them for you.

157
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,840
My Raya is so merciful.

158
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,440
Come Thongkliao.

159
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,680
Apologize and pledge loyalty to her.

160
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,920
Lady Raya. Please forgive me.

161
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,680
I love and miss my Lord so much.

162
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,680
I promise you I will know my place

163
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,280
and not bother you anymore.

164
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,280
I only beg for his presence sometimes.

165
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,120
I give you my gratitude

166
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,920
for letting me be under the same roof.

167
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,200
Even though I was here first,

168
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,440
I promise that
I'll respect your right as his wife

169
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,880
and not overstep the boundaries.

170
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,000
She is not upset now.

171
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,680
Go.

172
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,080
Yes.

173
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,840
What do you think?

174
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,320
It's me who should be asking you
that question.

175
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,320
Thongkliao has been
taking care of me longer.

176
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,560
She just knows me.

177
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,160
What about me? Do I not know you?

178
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,920
But Thongkliao

179
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,680
can give me what you can't.

180
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,920
Because I have a sense of shame,

181
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,680
so I wouldn't do it out in the open.

182
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:18,400
But I'm a man. It's a joy of life Raya.

183
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,040
I cannot give you that kind of joy.

184
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,480
Then, allow me to have Thongkliao.

185
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,120
I promise to keep her in place

186
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,040
and not go around bothering you at all.

187
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,960
Please Raya.

188
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,640
She's been at my service for a long time.

189
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,040
I don't want to discourage her.

190
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,040
But you're discouraging me.

191
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,200
Raya.

192
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,480
I know you're the kindest.

193
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,840
You won't let this thing
get in our way, right?

194
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,960
Also, I've made a vow.

195
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,240
If I break it and something bad happens,

196
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,800
who will take care of my Raya?

197
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,880
My my. Did he just promote Thongkliao
to be his second wife?

198
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,560
She must have acted desperate
that's why the Lord softened up.

199
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,000
How's Lady Raya?

200
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,960
Definitely bitter on the inside.

201
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,240
Whatever they say.

202
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,800
Since the day I was born,
I've never seen anyone kinder than her.

203
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,119
If I were her, Thongkliao would be dead!

204
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,119
You wished her dead long before this.

205
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,359
So no need to become the Lord's wife.

206
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,200
Shut your mouth or I'll hit you.

207
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,119
I'll say.

208
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,520
I hope Thongkliao is his last mistress.

209
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,040
Poor Lady Raya.

210
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,240
You're too kind, Lady Raya.

211
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,240
If I were you

212
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,560
and these shameless girls
try to get with the Lord,

213
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,960
I'd hit them hard till they pass out

214
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,400
and destroy their private parts for good.

215
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,080
So they can't use them anymore.

216
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,320
I try not to give anyone ill will.

217
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,080
My father taught me to be kind.

218
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,960
I can only hope that my mercy

219
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,240
will make them more shameful.

220
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,120
Those are low-class people.

221
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,680
They don't know shame.

222
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,560
Given how good-looking, merciful

223
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,800
and well-respected the Lord is,

224
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,000
he'll advance the ranks in no time.

225
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,920
And these servants would have eyes on him.

226
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,240
For this reason, I must endure.

227
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,560
I love him.

228
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,080
I have to value his honor as well.

229
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,840
If I am a Lady, I must not cause scandals.

230
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,560
I must tolerate everything,

231
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,040
even having Thongkliao in the house.

232
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,240
I hope she knows her place

233
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,560
so my Lady would be at ease.

234
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,480
If she even thinks of crossing the line,

235
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,160
My Lord

236
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,680
What are you doing?

237
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,360
Where are you rushing to?

238
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,280
Let go of me.

239
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,200
I need to go back to Lady Raya's.

240
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,280
Didn't you tell me that
she couldn't please you

241
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,480
like I could my Lord?

242
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,960
Wait.

243
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,120
What are you doing?

244
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,040
Wait.

245
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,960
That is true.

246
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,400
But you have to respect her.

247
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,520
Did you hear me?

248
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,720
My Lord.

249
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,520
Respect is one thing.

250
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,560
But serving the husband is different.

251
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,400
Tonight, let me be the one
who gives you the service.

252
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,360
Don't tease me, my Lord!

253
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,160
Come here!

254
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,480
My Lord!

255
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,160
Catch me.

256
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,160
You!

257
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,720
-Come to me.
-Follow me.

258
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,400
Hurry up.

259
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,840
Come this way, my Lord.

260
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,840
Don't tease me, my Lord.

261
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,160
-Come here!
-My Lord!

262
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,240
My Lord. Please don't.

263
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,880
If you tease me, I'll tease you back.

264
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,800
-It hurts.
-There, there.

265
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,120
Please stop.

266
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,760
My Lord.

267
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,720
-My Lord.
-Thongkliao.

268
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,440
Just come here!

269
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,320
Let's hug.

270
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,960
Stay here.

271
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,880
Please speak.

272
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,640
The villagers ran out of sugarcane juice,

273
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,040
so they ask for permission
to use our rolling machine.

274
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,240
No need for them to come.
Just share some with them.

275
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,000
If they need anything else,
give it to them.

276
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,680
No need to ask me.

277
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,120
I'm glad to share.

278
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,760
Thank you, Lady Raya.

279
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,400
You're unbelievably kind.

280
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,200
Your mercy shines on the villagers.

281
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,800
Don't see it as a mercy.

282
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,800
It's just a small thing

283
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,960
that neighbors could do
to help each other when needed.

284
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,600
Go ahead and make the juice.

285
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,880
Yes my Lady.

286
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,840
The kinder you are,

287
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,600
the more well respected you will be.

288
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,760
That servant girl Thongkliao
has nothing on you Lady Raya.

289
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,120
I can only wish one day he will see

290
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,680
that a good wife will shine a light

291
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,120
brighter than a lustful mistress

292
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,400
who's filled with nothing but lewdness.

293
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,360
Lady Raya is so kind.

294
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,640
When will Thongkliao realize this?

295
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,680
Oops.

296
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,280
It's so hot. You must all be tired.

297
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,600
Let me help.

298
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,840
Please don't.

299
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,880
Don't my Lady. Let us handle this.

300
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,280
Why not? We all eat this in the end.

301
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,960
Oh dear.

302
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,960
We can do this.
You don't have to Lady Raya.

303
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,640
Hey. Come and help.

304
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,440
Let me help so we can be done faster.

305
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,560
But.

306
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,320
We really don't want to trouble you.

307
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,160
It's no trouble.

308
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,520
Please let us do it ourselves.

309
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,120
Alright. Then when you churn the sugar,
let me help with it.

310
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,280
You're so kind my Lady.

311
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,520
But we don't want to make you do the work.

312
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,800
Just asking us how we're doing,

313
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,280
you've brightened our day my Lady.

314
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,360
Your words also brighten mine.

315
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,400
I promise I'll do my best
taking care of you all,

316
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,000
even Thongkliao.

317
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,440
Thank you my Lady.

318
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,480
Be careful.

319
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,600
Look at this Im.

320
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,520
Thongkliao will sleep on this soft bed.

321
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,600
It's because Lady Raya is so kind.

322
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,840
Will I get a chance to sleep
on a mattress like this one day?

323
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,480
For sure. I'll be working hard

324
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,560
so our Lord might give us some old ones.

325
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,240
No need to wait.

326
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,480
I have new mattresses for all.

327
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,600
I told you I'll take care of you.

328
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,440
Apart from the mattresses,

329
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,680
I also have cloth strips and Sbai

330
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,760
made with fine materials
to share with all of you.

331
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,560
They're so beautiful.

332
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,760
Come, pick the ones you like.

333
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,080
We can't take them my Lady.

334
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,200
Come and have them.

335
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,760
Please. There are plenty.

336
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,960
As you wish Lady Raya.

337
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,440
Then I'll pick them for each of you.

338
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,720
This pink one suits you Chuan.

339
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,120
You look good in pink.

340
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,960
-Take it.
-Thank you my Lady.

341
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,120
A bright color like this suits you.

342
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,400
Wow.

343
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,600
Look at you Im. Orange makes you pop.

344
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,600
-Have this one.
-Thank you my Lady.

345
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,480
This yellow one.

346
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,480
It should match you Chuan. Look at her.

347
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,240
I give you this one too.

348
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,000
Thank you so much Lady Raya.

349
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,840
She likes yellow.

350
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,480
For you Tuan.

351
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,880
Thank you my Lady.

352
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,600
This is for you Mi.

353
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,960
Wow. Thank you my Lady.

354
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,360
For the boys,

355
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,680
come get these satins to use as blankets.

356
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,560
They're really comfortable.

357
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,640
Thank you my Lady.

358
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,960
We're finished with the room Lady Raya.

359
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,280
Thank you all.

360
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,480
Go get Thongkliao to come take a look.

361
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,360
If she doesn't like the room,
I'll have it rearranged.

362
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,680
As you wish.
Thongkliao is so lucky to have you.

363
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,160
I just do what I should.

364
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,280
After all,

365
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,640
she was Luang Wisut's wife before me.

366
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,440
Hurry up so I can bring her to the room.

367
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,040
Yes.

368
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,880
Hold this for me.

369
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,840
Is that true Mi?
Did Lady Raya decorate my room?

370
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,240
Yes. You're scrubbing all day

371
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,320
so you wouldn't know anything.

372
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,320
I just want the Lord to love me.

373
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,280
But it seems like
Lady Raya has taken a liking to me.

374
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,160
That's why she decorated the room for me.

375
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,840
I don't know.

376
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,800
But now you need to go thank her. Go!

377
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,760
Okay.

378
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,440
My Raya.

379
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,000
Always busy with something.

380
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,280
All these garlands,
where will you hang them up?

381
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,280
On the balcony, I think.

382
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,480
So the passersby will smell them.

383
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,680
But it's only them on the balcony.
What's the point?

384
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,360
They serve us. We have to be kind.

385
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,800
Thongkliao is here my Lord.

386
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,920
Let's take a look at the room.

387
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,200
If you don't like it,
I'll have it rearranged.

388
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,480
You are so kind.
I'm sure I'll be impressed.

389
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,840
Thank you my Lady.

390
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,280
My Lord.

391
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,200
You will be with me often.
Let's look at our room.

392
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,160
If you're not impressed,
then Lady Raya will handle it.

393
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,200
Yes.

394
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,280
My Lord. This looks so good.

395
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,080
I'm so lucky.

396
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,520
Let's lie down together.

397
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,880
I want to know how soft the mattress is.

398
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,480
What happened?

399
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,440
Something's piercing my back.

400
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,040
It hurts so much.

401
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,840
It's nothing. Look.

402
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,640
My back! What is this?

403
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,800
Dear Lord. It's a pin!

404
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,880
A pin pierced my back!

405
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,320
It hurts me badly. What about you?

406
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,960
Me too!

407
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,320
Someone's behind this.

408
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,440
What happened back there?
Is the room not good?

409
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,640
It's beautiful my Lady.
But there are pins in the bed.

410
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,480
Oh dear. How is that possible?

411
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,600
I don't know. You have to handle it.
My back hurts all over.

412
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,560
Someone's trying to hurt me.

413
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,240
And that someone is?

414
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,840
I don't know.

415
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,680
But the pins wouldn't be there
by themselves.

416
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,000
Right. Pins cannot magically
end up in a mattress.

417
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,040
I was the one in charge of this room.

418
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,480
You can blame me.

419
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,800
No. Lady Raya did not do this.

420
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,080
I didn't say she did.

421
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,160
Some workers may have forgotten them there
when they cleaned the room.

422
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,680
My Lord, I swear,
no one left the pins in the mattress.

423
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,840
And I already checked before we left.

424
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,600
That's fine.

425
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,880
I'll send someone to make the room again.

426
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,080
And where will I be sleeping tonight?

427
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,480
Just go to where you belong.

428
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,760
I'm sure you're familiar with haystacks.

429
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,520
My Lord.

430
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,640
Thong!

431
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,480
Stop.

432
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:19,640
Well. Where she will sleep
is for you to decide.

433
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,040
Raya.

434
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:27,040
Then I'd like Thongkliao
to stay in our room.

435
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,560
She'll lie on the floor.

436
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,880
Don't worry. She won't bother you.

437
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,880
The Lady is too kind.

438
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,480
If it was me,

439
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,240
Thongkliao would definitely be dead.

440
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,480
Thongkliao. I'm so sore.

441
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,800
Let me give you a massage.

442
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,440
Come on.

443
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,920
Please lie down.

444
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,000
I need some air. I'll take a walk outside.

445
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,280
Right.

446
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,159
Are you comfortable?

447
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,560
Where do you want next?

448
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,880
Good. Right there.

449
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,520
The more I give, the more she takes.
What a shameless girl.

450
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,120
Oh dear!

451
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,280
Who's there?

452
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,960
It's Chuan and Im, my Lady.

453
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,760
What are you doing out this late?

454
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,840
The torch in the basement is dying out,

455
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,680
so Mother told us to change it.

456
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,640
Why aren't you asleep Lady Raya?

457
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,680
I can't sleep so I decided to take a walk.

458
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,320
It's so dark.

459
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,000
I might have kicked the plant pot.

460
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,040
Are you all right? I'm sorry.

461
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,680
We're fine.

462
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,240
Good. Then change the torch and go to bed.

463
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,280
What about you my Lady?

464
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,400
I'll make some bouquets for garlands.

465
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,920
Then, let us help you.

466
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,800
As you wish.

467
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,360
Come here my Lord.

468
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,480
Hug me.

469
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,120
Look at you.

470
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,920
-Come right here.
-Follow me.

471
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,680
Hurry up.

472
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,000
Come here with me.

473
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,680
Don't tease me.

474
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,240
Come here!

475
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,120
My Lord!

476
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:59,040
I don't want any trouble
for anyone to gossip about.

477
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,680
Then she'll keep crossing the line.

478
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,640
And maybe Chuan and Im stayed

479
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,640
and didn't go to their quarters

480
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,640
because they're looking for a chance
to be with the Lord.

481
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,640
I've noticed for a while

482
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,520
that the girls here often glance at him.

483
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,080
Of course they are!

484
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,840
He is young and handsome.

485
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,720
They must all be ambitious,
just like Thongkliao.

486
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,320
My Lady Raya,
you cannot be kind to them anymore.

487
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,520
Don't trust them

488
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,280
unless you want them all
under the same roof.

489
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,680
Look at them. Quick and mischievous.

490
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm so happy.

491
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,080
It's because Lady Raya is so merciful.

492
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,840
You have to be good to her.

493
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,600
I know my place my Lord.

494
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,840
I respect her kindness.

495
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,560
She's so merciful
for sharing a husband with me.

496
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,040
If that's what you think,
then I'm relieved.

497
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,040
But I'll allow only Lady Raya.

498
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,480
If you have anyone else,
I won't let that slide.

499
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,320
Even if you want to flog me to death,

500
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,080
I'm not afraid. I'll use my nails

501
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,520
to cut their faces open.

502
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,080
Oh. When you put it like that,

503
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,240
then I must be very charming.

504
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,400
That's the truth. You're charming.

505
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,280
That is why I, Thongkliao,

506
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,040
am deeply in love with you.

507
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,320
Thongkliao, that low-life bitch,

508
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,280
just staying around to bed him all day.

509
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,360
She is getting out of hand now.

510
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,920
You can't let this slide Lady Raya.

511
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,600
I will turn love to disgust.

512
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,720
Let it be known.

513
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,480
I become vicious
when I meet the despicable.

514
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,640
Let me see your hand.

515
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,960
NEXT EPISODE

516
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,280
Is it clean enough to cook my food?

517
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,680
Who dares to have our husband will die.

518
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,440
These shameless mistresses

519
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,200
will face me, a rightful wife.
