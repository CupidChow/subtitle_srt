1
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Thank you for always taking care of me.

2
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,880
It's because I love you so much.

3
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,240
I love you too.

4
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,000
If I get promoted, I'll marry you.

5
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,320
Really? Are you serious?

6
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,720
Make a vow.

7
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,960
Alright.

8
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,440
My sweetheart.

9
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,320
Thank you for your mercy.

10
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,440
I'll never forget your kindness.

11
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,960
What? If the Lord gets promoted,

12
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,760
he'll marry you?

13
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,480
Yes, he must know that I'm not at ease

14
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,440
that these people keep looking at him.

15
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,000
That's why he has to let them know
that I'm his wife.

16
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,480
Tut! You have no shame.

17
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,160
If calling you to serve him

18
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,080
makes you think you're his wife,

19
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,520
these women could say
they're his wives as well.

20
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,920
It's not the same,
because I'm going to marry him.

21
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And I'll make you all work under me.

22
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,560
You, you, you, and you too.

23
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,800
Thongkliao!

24
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,200
Thongkliao, stop!

25
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,600
Stop. Enough!

26
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,080
Enough!

27
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,720
-Enough, Thongkliao.
-Thongkliao, stop.

28
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,880
-Get off of me.
-Thongkliao.

29
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,440
Stop!

30
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,440
-Please stop fighting.
-Thongkliao, stop.

31
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,480
-Are you scolding me?
-Stop!

32
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,000
Huh?

33
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,680
Who told you to scold me?

34
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,360
I wanted you to realize

35
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,280
that a person like him
will marry someone worthy,

36
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,640
and that is not you.

37
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,080
-Enough.
-Come on

38
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,200
-Enough.
-Let me go.

39
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,120
-Stop!
-Let me go!

40
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,760
Thong, bring Bengal roots too.

41
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,240
In case someone gets wounded,
they can use them.

42
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,040
Yes Lady.

43
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,640
I knew you'd be here.

44
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,320
It's summer.
I'm afraid you'll get sick father.

45
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,280
So I'm preparing the medicine.

46
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,000
Oh my daughter.

47
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,960
At first, I thought
I was going to remind you

48
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,920
to not forget that Khun Wisut
is coming to visit.

49
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,760
But when I saw you picking some jasmine,

50
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,880
I knew you didn't forget.

51
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,960
Khun Wisut has arrived.

52
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,360
Eating Khao Chae in summer
is so refreshing.

53
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,000
Thank you Your Excellency.

54
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,400
You have to thank the cook.

55
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,360
Because if they don't cook,
we don't get to eat.

56
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,840
Thank you very much, Raya.

57
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,920
You can come here to eat
whenever you wish.

58
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,120
We always welcome you.

59
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,560
That's very kind of you.

60
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,400
Please excuse me.
I have urgent work to finish.

61
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,919
Alright sir.

62
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,080
Raya, please escort him out for me.

63
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,799
Yes father.

64
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,640
Khun Wisut,

65
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,960
make yourself comfortable.

66
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,760
Raya,

67
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,920
thank you so much for welcoming me.

68
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,600
I'm following my father's orders.

69
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,880
Then, I'll assume

70
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,160
that you are welcoming me.

71
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,960
Here's your dessert.

72
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,720
I apologize. I don't really like sweets.

73
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,040
Then, I'll take it.

74
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,200
I like sweets.

75
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,080
You like sweets.

76
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,760
That's why your face looks so sweet.

77
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,680
-And fierce.
-Hm?

78
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,960
Really?

79
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,880
By asking this, you must not know

80
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,720
that people who like sweets
are fierce and furious.

81
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,960
How fierce and furious can you be?

82
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,320
You will have to see.

83
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,040
Where are you going next sir?

84
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,400
Let's go to Khun Luang Pakdee's house.

85
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,200
Everyone, hurry up.

86
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,520
Lady Thongkliao is hungry.

87
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,640
Whoa. Do you still think
you're going to be his wife?

88
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,960
That's why you speak like that?

89
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,560
It's not a dream. It's real.

90
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,600
Thongkhliao, you're shameless.

91
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,280
You don't know your place.

92
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,600
One day, you'll be in trouble.

93
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,600
You're the one who'll be in trouble.

94
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,960
Wait until the Lord is back.

95
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,720
This shameless one you're scolding
will be your master.

96
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,120
No, don't do it.

97
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,080
Why?

98
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,120
My Lord.

99
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,600
Ouch!

100
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,440
-My lord, help me.
-Thongkliao.

101
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,760
-Help me.
-Thongkliao, are you alright?

102
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,400
My Lord, help me.

103
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,600
What happened?

104
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,880
I got bitten by a snake.

105
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,800
Where is it?

106
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,200
Not on my leg.

107
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,240
Where then?

108
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,520
In my heart.

109
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,760
Are you teasing me?

110
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,600
I just wanted to test you.

111
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
You went on duty for a long time.

112
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,040
Do you still love
and care about this wife of yours?

113
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,240
Why are you testing me?

114
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,840
When I'm not with you,
I miss you so badly.

115
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,320
Alright. Let me punish you.

116
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,160
Bun, why are you standing there? Just go.

117
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,440
Yes sir.

118
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,400
Everyone.

119
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,400
I saw the Lord and Thongkliao

120
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,000
having sex.

121
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,440
Really Bun?

122
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,440
Yes uncle.

123
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,480
That's why.

124
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,400
That's why Thongkliao thinks
the Lord loves her.

125
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,480
He hasn't even reached the house
and he's already with her.

126
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,240
Are you hungry now?

127
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,440
I'm hungry now.

128
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,880
Alright.

129
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,200
Is it good?

130
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,360
How is Chuan's cooking sir?

131
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,280
As good as yours.

132
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,560
I have a good appetite.

133
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,560
Anyway, is your daughter
old enough to be in the kitchen?

134
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,280
Yes sir.

135
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,840
Good, then let her cook,
so you can rest more.

136
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,680
Yes sir. Mm…

137
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,480
The side dishes are running out.
I'm going to get more for you.

138
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,960
Chuan, bring more side dishes
for the Lord.

139
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,200
Alright Mom.

140
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,040
Is this Chuan,

141
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,240
your daughter?

142
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,640
No sir. This is Im,

143
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,280
the daughter of Sak
who died from cholera last year.

144
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,200
Chuan is making desserts.
So I'm serving this.

145
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,560
It doesn't matter who's serving.

146
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,880
I can eat it all.

147
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,200
I recall

148
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,720
seeing you swim in the river naked.

149
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,480
All of a sudden, you grew into a woman.

150
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,720
She's really growing fast.

151
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,400
She just grew up but she has a husband.

152
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,200
It's not true. I've never done that.

153
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,320
I don't trust you.
You always go out with Ying.

154
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,520
You wouldn't miss it.

155
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,000
Don't blame her.

156
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,120
Having a partner is normal.

157
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,800
Alright. Get me that.

158
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,800
I want to eat it now.

159
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,320
As long as I can remember,

160
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,040
all the women in this house
have served him.

161
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,320
Not only in our house,
but also other places.

162
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,280
He's good-looking, kind and generous.

163
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,960
There's a saying about a person like him.

164
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,880
He's blessed with his kindness.

165
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,520
He's loved everywhere he goes.

166
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,480
Some people from rich families

167
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,360
even give bribes just to serve him.

168
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,000
Really?

169
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,720
Bun is not exaggerating.

170
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,960
If you don't believe it, ask these girls

171
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,440
if they want to serve him.

172
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,360
What do you say?

173
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,440
Yes, I do. But…

174
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,240
he hasn't called me yet.

175
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,440
If I get to serve him for a night,

176
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,240
I wouldn't forget his kindness.

177
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,120
Hey.

178
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,200
When are you going to tell
these people in the house

179
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,240
that I am your wife?

180
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,160
So they won't scold me
and hurt my feelings.

181
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,640
I told you to wait until I get promoted.

182
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,640
Is it close?

183
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,480
I'm going to the city soon.

184
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,960
I think there'll be good news.

185
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,640
Then I'll wait for good news from you.

186
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,640
This time, you look lively.

187
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
I've been promoted to be Luang.

188
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,200
We've been seeing each other
for a long time.

189
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,000
I'll ask my parents to come
and ask to marry you.

190
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,320
The Lord is getting married.

191
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,120
To who?

192
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,680
Lady Raya, the daughter
of Phraya of Bangkok Noi.

193
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,440
Bun said the Lord
has brought wedding suits home this time.

194
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,960
No! No!

195
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,400
That's not true! I don't believe it.

196
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,080
You can't get married.
I can't accept this.

197
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,720
Don't you remember?

198
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,800
You promised me that if you get promoted,

199
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,920
you'd marry me.

200
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,440
Why would you do this to me?

201
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,320
Even if I get married,

202
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,560
you're still my wife.

203
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,560
But I want to be the first wife,

204
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,520
the legal wife,

205
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,800
not the slave wife!

206
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,680
I don't want you to get married!

207
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,280
Thongkliao, can you calm down?

208
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,000
Thongkliao, calm down!

209
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,120
I can't accept this!

210
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,080
How can she act like that?

211
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,880
-She'll get punished.
-My lord.

212
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,680
She thinks she's his wife.

213
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,720
-Hey!
-I don't want you to get married!

214
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,040
-Stop!
-Give it to me!

215
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,840
-Thongkliao.
-Someone come get her!

216
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,760
I can't accept this. My Lord.

217
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,720
My Lord, you can't get married!

218
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,880
I can't accept this!

219
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,360
I can't accept this!

220
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,960
-My Lord!
-My Lord,

221
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,760
Thongkliao is acting up too much.

222
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,080
Do you want to punish her?

223
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,520
No need. Get someone
to tell her that I'm getting married.

224
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,400
And you come with me.

225
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,600
My Lord.

226
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,080
My Lord.

227
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,840
My Lord, I can't accept this.

228
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,240
My Lord, don't go.

229
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,040
Come back, my Lord!

230
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,440
Why are you doing this?

231
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,720
Why don't you keep your promise?

232
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,240
Raya is the apple of my eye.

233
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,840
A lot of noblemen
want to take care of her.

234
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,920
But you are the one that she chooses.

235
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,040
Please take care of my daughter.

236
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,640
Yes sir.

237
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:48,040
I will take care of Raya,
better than I take care of my own life.

238
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,520
Forgive each other if it's not too hard.

239
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,680
Alright?

240
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,560
Alright father.

241
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,680
Don't do this.

242
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,040
I'm so happy.

243
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,120
Don't do that. It's the middle of the day.

244
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,400
I'm shy.

245
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,920
What's wrong with that Raya?

246
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,720
We're married.

247
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,400
And this is our private matter.

248
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,600
Don't do that.

249
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,920
Alright.

250
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,200
I'll wait until tonight.

251
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,120
Don't do that.

252
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,160
Why Raya?

253
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,400
It's nighttime now.

254
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,000
Do you despise me?

255
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,320
I warned her to not be too ambitious.

256
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,400
We can't just blame Thongkliao.

257
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,760
The Lord got her hopes up.
That's why she's imagining things.

258
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,480
It's a man thing. And he's the master.

259
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,840
But a master should keep his word,
shouldn't he?

260
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,400
That's right.
But a master can do anything.

261
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,160
The other day he said one thing.
Today he can say another.

262
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,120
We have to follow that.

263
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,040
That's right. He's the master.

264
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,520
-Ying.
-Yes?

265
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,320
You have to promise me
that you'll keep your promises.

266
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,200
Don't twist your words.

267
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,520
Alright.

268
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,120
Mom, I'm afraid.

269
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,080
When Lady Raya moves in,

270
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,360
I don't know how Thongkliao will cope.

271
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,400
This is Lady Raya, my wife.

272
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,440
She'll be the Lady of this house.

273
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,160
Please make yourself comfortable.
I'm not that punctilious.

274
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,160
No, you can't be.

275
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,800
From now on,
you are the most important one here.

276
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,960
How about a wife like Thongkliao?
What do you say?

277
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,280
I won't let you have anyone else.

278
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,360
Stop, Thongkliao.

279
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,720
I won't stop. You broke your promise.

280
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,320
What is happening?

281
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,360
The Lord is my man.

282
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,840
Stop now.

283
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:38,480
No, I'll tell everyone
that this Lady is stealing my man.

284
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,720
Everyone, come have a look.

285
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,600
-This proper Lady is stealing my man.
-Thongkliao!

286
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,040
Apologize to her now!

287
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,400
No, she's the one to apologize
for stealing my man.

288
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,360
Remember this. If you were not
the daughter of Chao Phraya,

289
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,760
you would never get to be the first wife.

290
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,840
He loves me.

291
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,920
He loves me. Do you hear that?

292
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,600
He loves me!

293
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,480
Whip her. Don't stop until she dies.

294
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,920
Let me go! You can't do this to me!

295
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,080
My Lord!

296
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,680
Are you alright?

297
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,160
I'm going home.

298
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,080
Wait, Raya.

299
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,920
Don't do this. I was just having fun.

300
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,920
I wouldn't be serious
with a slave in the house.

301
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,360
But she said that
you made a vow to marry her.

302
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,720
No.

303
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:00,440
Goodness.
I didn't really mean what I said.

304
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,560
If you break the vow,
wouldn't you have to die?

305
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,639
It wouldn't be that serious.

306
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,440
And, as you can see,
I made an order to whip her.

307
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,280
From now on,

308
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,920
she won't dare
cross the line with you again.

309
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,600
From now on?

310
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,760
Yes, from now on,

311
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,840
Thongkliao won't dare
cross the line again.

312
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,600
I promise.

313
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,679
My dear Lord.

314
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,760
Bun, please stop.

315
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,440
My dear Lord.

316
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,840
My dear Lord.

317
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,920
My Lord!

318
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,400
My Lord, help me!

319
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,840
It hurts!

320
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,920
My dear Lord!

321
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,920
It hurts!

322
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,240
Even when I'm standing here,

323
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,400
you're still worried about that slave.
I can't accept this.

324
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,840
Do you want him to whip her to death?

325
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,320
Yes.

326
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,360
If she has to die,
she has to die in front of me.

327
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,800
But if she doesn't die,
it's also because of me.

328
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,560
My Lord, it hurts!

329
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,040
My Lord!

330
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,840
My Lord!

331
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,840
It hurts!

332
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,760
My Lord!

333
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,080
Serves you right.

334
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,400
It hurts!

335
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,120
Luang Wisut, enough.

336
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,040
She's suffering now.

337
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,440
She was rude to you. She deserves it.

338
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,880
Let her die.

339
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
My dear Lord!

340
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,080
Please don't. I don't want bad karma.

341
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,680
If it can be forgiven, let's forgive her.

342
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,520
Do you really mean it?

343
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,120
Yes, please stop caning her.

344
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,560
I feel sorry for her.

345
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,480
Stop!

346
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,280
Still?

347
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,480
Come here.

348
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,560
Come thank Lady Raya.

349
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,680
Didn't you hear?

350
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,560
Had it not been for her,
you would be dead by now.

351
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,200
Come here.

352
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,440
Why are you so stubborn? Bun, the stick!

353
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,680
Luang Wisut. Please don't.

354
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,880
-Don't do it.
-Why are you stopping me?

355
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,320
At least she's your wife. Don't do it.

356
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,440
Again. It's because of Lady Raya's mercy.

357
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,000
And you still can't appreciate it.

358
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,200
Bun.

359
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,040
Lock her up.
Don't let her show her face here again.

360
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,600
My Lord.

361
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,440
My Lord.

362
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,840
My Lord.

363
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,640
He's given a chance to marry a lady
from a family of respected Lords,

364
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,760
but he doesn't honor her at all.

365
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,800
Will you allow me to have Thongkliao?

366
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,680
I give you my gratitude

367
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,040
for letting me be under the same roof

368
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,920
even though I was here first.

369
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,360
I can only wish one day he will see

370
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,920
that a good wife will shine a light

371
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,400
brighter than a lustful mistress.

372
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,120
Tonight, let me be the one

373
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,680
who gives you the service.

374
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
