leads to such a paradise.

9
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,310
Looks like you're an incompetent master.

10
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,970
You don't know your favorite disciple,

11
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:52,970
Ye Wuchen, at all.

12
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,080
Ye Wuchen?

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,480
do you mean?

15
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,560

If he didn't pretend to be Ye Wuchen,

29
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,530
how could he approach you

30
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,190
and give me the secret book?

31
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,540
Let me explain.

42
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,370
What do you mean?

43
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,350
He didn't steal that secret book.

44
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,630
I gave it to him.

45
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,600
What did you do?

46
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,080
Do you think I'll give you the real secret book?

47
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,860
Just continue to practice it.

You'll die from a body explosion soon.

49
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,880
You devil, you broke your promise!

50
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,920
Why should I believe you?

51
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,050
I'm a devil.

53

Do you think I'll believe a jerk who I just met?

54
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
What a pity.

55
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,600
This world is boring.

56
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,690
In this life,

00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,250
what Feng Nanxi said just now

69
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,400

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,920
Master,

71
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,170
why are you doing this?

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,680
I raised you.

73
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,720
You can lie to me once,

74
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,090
but you can't fool me again.

75
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,320
Master,

76
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,660
I always thought you were the person I admire the most.

77
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,990
I thought every word you said

78
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,150
was right.

79
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,390
Even when the evidence was right in front of me,

80
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,400
I would still make an excuse

81
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,760
and believe you're right.

82
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,420
Maybe what Feng Nanxi said is right.

83
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,470
You are a hypocrite.

84
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,080
You killed Senior Ye,

85
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,240
and those seniors didn't betray you.

86
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,140
You betrayed the Xiaoyao Sect!

87
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,920
Evidence?

88
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,470
The entire Xiangyang Residence has been burnt to ashes.

89
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,990
You know too much.

90
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:50,540
Isn't it good to be my good disciple?

91
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,080
Since

92
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,800
you miss your seniors and juniors so much,

93
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:02,100
you should stay right here!

94
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,410
Who took Nanxi away?

95
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,270
Have you thought

96
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,950
about what I told you last time?

97
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,210
Didn't I tell you this?

98
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,650
Don't come to me again.

99
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,230
Feng Nanxi removed your martial arts skills.

100
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,630
Can you really let her go?

101
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,220
Even if Feng Nanxi should be killed,

102
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,860
it's not your turn to do it.

103
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,390
Don't force me to do it the hard way.

104
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,730
You can't end

105
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,850
the cooperation with us

106
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,280
just because you want to.

107

Where is the real secret book?

108
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,920
Even if I know where it is,

109
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,350
why would I give it to you?

110
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,460
I already forgave you

111
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,850
for what you did to me back then.

112
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,320

Wuhuan.

118

Wuhuan!

119
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:55,670
Who on earth is that man in black?

120
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,150
Who's there?
