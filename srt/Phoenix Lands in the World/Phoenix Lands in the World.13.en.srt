in the confinement room didn't betray our sect.

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,290
Shangguan Ye has abused his power for personal gains

9
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,590
and frequently sent the Dark Division's disciples

10
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,130
to look for secret treasures for him to improve his power.

11
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,160
He has committed many crimes like setting fire, killing, and looting.

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,710
Master was worried someone would find out what he did,

13
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,240
so he made the Moon Shadow Sect his scapegoat.

14
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,270
If the Dark Division's disciples attempt to disobey him,

15
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,550
they will be killed.

Hurry up.

19
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,970
Ye Wuchen, hurry up!

20
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,470
I've been waiting for you.

21
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,420
Coming.

22
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,730
What do you think of this sachet?

23
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,020
Not bad.

24
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,210
Take it.

25
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,170
No need for that.

Shen Yu,

27
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,970
don't you know

28
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,250
most of the businesses on this street

29
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,690

Xiaolian?

32
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,400
Chief, let me see if you're hurt.

33
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,580
I'm fine.

34
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,270
Why are you still with her?

35
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,880
She colluded with the Xiaoyao Sect

36
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,280
and almost got us killed.

37
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,289
Chief,

38
00:01:58,539 --> 00:01:59,770
Wuhuan has realized her mistake.

39
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,970
She won't do it again.

40
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,700
I promise with my life.

41
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,120
What's wrong with her?

42
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,240
She suffered a bit these days.

43
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,440
She has been dispirited this whole time.

44
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,240
In my opinion,

45
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,210
why don't we let her manage a shop?

46
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,070
She needs to find something to do.

47
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,840
Otherwise,

48
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,200

49

51
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,230
speaking of shops, you came at the right time.

It smells so good.

82
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,110
This is top-quality milk powder.

83
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,550
It's so fragrant.

84
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,950

have anything to do with you?

94
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,650
You appeared at the door of the Xiaoyao Sect when you were a baby.

95
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,450
You were just an abandoned baby.

96
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,890
I raised you

97
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,340
and taught you martial arts.

98
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,250
But now you've become a woman's dog.

100
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,220
You want to convict me with just a letter?

101
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,320
If you have a clear conscience,

102
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,060
why did you come here to see me?

103
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,170
Shen Yu,

104
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,520
I knew something is wrong with you during the day.

105
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,450
Where did you go?

106
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,800
I couldn't sleep, so I went out to practice swordsmanship.

107
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,060
You're not lying to me?

108
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,060
No.

109
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,090
It's not a white lie either?

110
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,990
Of course not.

111
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,870
Fine.

112
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:52,450
I trust you.

113
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,650
But don't go out at this hour again.

114
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,980
I was worried about you.

115
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:56,520
Okay.

116
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,830
I'm going to bed.

117
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,670
I'm so sleepy.

118
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:04,610
Nanxi,

119
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,060
give me three more days.

120
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,200
I will tell you the truth.

121
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,690
Before that,

122
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,850
let me be Ye Wuchen for a few more days.

123
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,140
Master,

124
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,650
I'm curious about the reason why Feng Nanxi

125
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,980
wants to find Ye Wuchen.

126
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,190
She even disbanded the Moon Shadow Sect.

127
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,010
It seems Shen Yu has approached Feng Nanxi

128
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,960
by pretending to be Ye Wuchen.

129
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,210
In other words,

130
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,490
Feng Nanxi still doesn't know

131
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,370
Shen Yu's real identity.

132
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,220
This...

133
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,690
Master,

134
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,920
there is one more thing that is very strange.

135
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,710
The Xiaoyao Sect has always been heavily guarded.

136
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,140
How did Feng Nanxi

137
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,350
manage to come and go freely before?

138
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,370
I haven't figured it out yet.

139
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,290
You may leave.

140
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,900
Could it be...

141
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,210
there is a secret passage?

142
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,470
Time for breakfast, Nanxi.

143
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,860
Nanxi.

144
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,110
Get up and eat.

145
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,530
What's up?

146
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,250
Get up and eat.

147
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,690
I'm not hungry. I want to get more sleep.

148
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,250
Be good.

149
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:38,790
I'm not hungry.

150
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,280
I want to get more sleep.

151
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,920
You can get more sleep after eating, okay?

152
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,510
Are you... okay?

153
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,650
I'm fine.

154
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,840
Are you okay?

155
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,270
Xiangyang Residence.
