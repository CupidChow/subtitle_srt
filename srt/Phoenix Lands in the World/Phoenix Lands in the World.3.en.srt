1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,200
Why are you here?

3
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,470
Chief.

4
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,240
Chief.

5
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,430
Why didn’t you tell me, your Chuyi, that you were back?

6
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,750
I just learned a new song.

7
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,350
I was going to sing it for you.

8
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,480
Chuyi, meaning “first day"?

9
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:06,710
Who are you?

10
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,039
I’m Shiwu, meaning "15th day".

11
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,000
Chief.

12
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,400
Let me serve you.

13
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,640
This newcomer

14
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,430
doesn't know your preferences.

15
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,510
I know you best.

16
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:17,710
You're wrong.

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,350
Between a man and a woman,

18
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,880
it's just the usual things.

19
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,400
Getting to know each other from being strangers

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,060
is the most interesting part.

21
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,680
How can you

22
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,680
be so shameless?

23
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,640
I think you're the shameless one.

24
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,760
I'm "the first day", and you're "the 15th day".

25
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,509
Don't you understand the concept of first come, first served?

26
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:34,430
Do you know

27
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,070
what it means for the newcomer to surpass the old one?

28
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,870
Do you believe I'll kick you out?

29
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,470
This is the Moon Shadow Sect.

30
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,150
Are you

31
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,920
planning to make decisions on behalf of the chief?

32
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,560
Chief.

33
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,280
I absolutely didn't mean that.

34
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,000
This gigolo

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,920
must be a fraud.

36
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,350
He might be an undercover agent sent by some other sect.

37
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,070
Enough.

38
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,470
Cloud Absorption Spell!

39
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,640
Cloud Absorption Spell!

40
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,590
Chief.

41
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,470
It seems you do care about me.

42
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,050
If you want to touch me,

43
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,449
there's no need to be roundabout.

44
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,800
Cloud Absorption Spell!!

45
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,840
I just absorbed a bit of your energy,

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,400
and you became like this?

47
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,240
How weak is your body?

48
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,750
It seems my Cloud Absorption Spell! doesn't work on Chuyi.

49
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,800
Does it

50
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,750
only work on him?

51
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,280
On 15th of the eighth lunar month, the Four Great Sects will come to kill me.

52
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,800
Now, with Ye Wuchen gone,

53
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,120
I can't return.

54
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,680
Oh, no.

55
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,870
It's all over.

56
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,520
Maybe

57
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,080
I should leave here, hide my identity,

58
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,340
and save my life first.

59
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,220
Are you looking for Ye Wuchen?

60
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,470
Chief, your Cloud Absorption Spell is indeed powerful.

61
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,000
If I didn't have some internal strength,

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,710
I might have...

63
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,110
Stop talking about that.

64
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,030
Who did you mention just now?

65
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,840
Ye Wuchen.

66
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,440
You've heard of him?

67
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,020
Why do you seek him, Chief?

68
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,430
You really know him.

69
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,090
Please tell me where he is now.

70
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,750
Chief.

71
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,240
You hit me with a palm strike just now.

72
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,430
Could you allow me

73
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,290
to rest here for a while?

74
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,680
Alright.

75
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,930
You must be hungry.

76
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,190
Have some snacks.

77
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,840
I'm not hungry yet.

78
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,840
Have you had a good rest?

79
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,840
Can you tell me

80
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,970
about Ye Wuchen now?

81
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,800
I really have something urgent to discuss with him.

82
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,430
Chief.

83
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,470
I advise you

84
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,710
to stop searching for him.

85
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,160
Why?

86
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,560
Because

87
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,270
Ye Wuchen

88
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,600
is actually

89
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,310
a wandering hero who appears and disappears without a trace.

90
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,630
No one can find him.

91
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,000
So

92
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,720
he has become a wandering hero.

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,270
Come with me down the mountain.

94
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:46,920
Yes.

95
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,480
Down the mountain?

96
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes.

97
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,040
How else can we find Ye Wuchen if we don't go down the mountain?

98
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,630
He couldn't possibly be in the Moon Shadow Sect.

99
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,270
No.

100
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
I can't let her go down the mountain.

101
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,830
If she goes down the mountain,

102
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,760
I won’t have the chance to complete my master’s task.

103
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,820
What’s wrong with you now?

104
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,190
Chief.

105
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,670
I have only been in the Moon Shadow Sect for one day,

106
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,140
and I've already taken two strikes from you.

107
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,000
Surviving was already a stroke of luck.

108
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,190
There's no way

109
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,880
I can accompany you down the mountain.

110
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Shen Yu

111
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,630
is definitely not just a minor character.

112
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,270
If he finds out

113
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,070
that I can only use

114
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,870
the Cloud Absorption Spell with him around,

115
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,470
he’ll have ten thousand ways to manipulate me.

116
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,630
To become my person,

117
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,390
you must show true loyalty.

118
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,190
My loyalty to you is as clear as the sun and the moon.

119
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
But I only trust myself.

120
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,430
What you just swallowed

121
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,680
was a poison I carefully crafted.

122
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,040
You must take the antidote every month,

123
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,000
or your meridians will shatter

124
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,190
and you will die.

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,800
Chief.

126
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,950
You just gave me tea.

127
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,870
Besides,

128
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,720
we both drank it just now.

129
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,120
Who said that?

130
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,510
My poison is colorless and tasteless,

131
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,480
and it shows no symptoms

132
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,360
until the moment of taking effect.

133
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
Anyway,

134
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,070
from now on,

135
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,750
you’ll stay with me.

136
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,560
Otherwise,

137
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:40,800
if I don’t give you the antidote, you’ll die.

138
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,360
Chief.

139
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,040
This place is heavily guarded.

140
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,360
It will take a lot of time

141
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,960
to find what my master wants.

142
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,390
The Moon Shadow Sect

143
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,720
has hidden superior martial arts manuals from various sects.

144
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,580
I can’t underestimate Feng Nanxi, this she-devil.

145
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,410
Since Ye Wuchen still exists,

146
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,120
I just need to follow the storyline, fall in love with him,

147
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,380
and then kill him. That way, I can return.

148
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,270
I'm going to kill him anyway.

149
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,190
But I have to protect myself first.

150
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,360
It's so dangerous.

151
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
I need to keep the power bank with me.

152
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,750
Otherwise, if something happens.

153
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,920
I’m helpless.

154
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,950
I don’t know if the poison she mentioned is real or not.

155
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,070
I need to find the antidote quickly.

156
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,830
Shen Yu.

157
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,420
What are you doing?

158
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,600
I couldn’t sleep.

159
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,520
I came to read some books.

160
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,720
Couldn't sleep?

161
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,190
Yes.

162
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,830
Coincidentally, I couldn’t sleep either.

163
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,430
Come, let's sleep together.

164
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,669
Chief. Please forgive me.

165
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,320
It’s okay.

166
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,510
Why is your makeup so heavy here?

167
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,720
Don’t you have more natural-looking earrings

168
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,320
and lighter eyeshadow?

169
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,550
Leave it to me.

170
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,670
Yes.

171
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,070
You know how to do makeup?

172
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,320
How is it?

173
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,960
Looks good.

174
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,670
Help me with my eyebrows too.

175
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,720
Chief.

176
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,630
I think we can put off

177
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,630
looking for Ye Wuchen.

178
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,510
The sect is busy now.

179
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,960
If you are not here,

180
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,840
things could fall apart.

181
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,750
If

182
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,440
the Four Major Sects attack

183
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,750
while you're away,

184
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,790
no one in the sect will be able to defend.

185
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,390
Right.

186
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,080
You reminded me.

187
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,000
What if they suddenly attack us?

188
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,840
Yeah.

189
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,000
So you won’t go?

190
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,960
Let’s go now.

191
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,840
Hurry up.

192
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,960
If you get lost and the poison takes effect,

193
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,120
it's not my problem.

194
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,860
Does she have anything

195
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,040
to do with Senior Ye's disappearance?

196
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:11,840
Boss.

197
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,200
Have you seen a handsome man in white, holding a long sword,

198
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
who loves eating dragon whiskers noodles?

199
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,000
No.

200
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,360
Boss.

201
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,670
Have you seen a burly man dressed in black, wielding a short blade,

202
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,440
who hates eating noodles?

203
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,240
No.

204
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,630
Have you seen a tall, skinny,

205
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,030
fair-skinned bald man?

206
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,840
No.

207
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,630
Have you seen a short, chubby,

208
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,830
dark-skinned man...

209
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,840
Aren’t you supposed to know who Ye Wuchen is?

210
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,630
Yes.

211
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,030
Then...

212
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,600
Is he tall or short,

213
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,030
fat or skinny,

214
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,440
dark-skinned or fair-skinned?

215
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,750
Are you talking about the same person?

216
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,510
I've changed Ye Wuchen's character too many times.

217
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,870
Who knows what he looks like in this version?

218
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,510
Chief.

219
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,480
It seems that waiting for him to show up won't work this time.

220
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,960
Are you listening to me?

221
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,320
I have an idea.
