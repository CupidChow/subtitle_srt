1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,350
Shen Yu.

3
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,560
Why did you come to me

4
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,920
at this hour?

5
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,390
I just want to ask

6
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,600
about Ye Wuchen.

7
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,840
About Ye Wuchen?

8
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,810
What do you want to know about him?

9
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,760
I just want to ask

10
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,230
if you know

11
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,480
if he has any place like a secret residence.

12
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,760
What is...

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,130
a secret residence?

14
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,000
Nothing.

15
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,229
Forget it if you don't know.

16
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:38,759
I just heard it from others.

17
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,950
I've been thinking we can

18
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,400
get to know each other if there's a chance.

19
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,479
Do you love Ye Wuchen that much?

20
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,840
Do you like Ye Wuchen that much?

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,400
You misunderstood.

22
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,840
I just... want to make friends.

23
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,640
I already drank this cup of tea.

24
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,760
We already kissed. What's the big deal?

25
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,520
I'm going out for a walk.

26
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,490
I want to fly a sky lantern.

27
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,630
You two

28
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,190
are a perfect match.

29
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,840
I'm going to write "a long and happy marriage".

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,860
Who wants to have a long and happy marriage with him?

31
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,720
What wish do you want to make?

32
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,760
I don't want to tell you.

33
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,210
You make a wish too.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,120
I don't believe in this.

35
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,980
I didn't believe in these before.

36
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,410
I have no choice now.

37
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,030
Let's find an empty place

38
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,080
to release it.

39
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,360
Rouge and powder.

40
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,190
Sir, goodbye.

41
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,480
Okay.

42
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,560
He's here.

43
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,190
Have you found any clue to the secret book?

44
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:46,680
Not yet.

45
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,750
Not yet?

46
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,710
She takes you with her wherever she goes.

47
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,400
Are you

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
making an excuse for her purposely?

49
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:56,920
Feng Nanxi

50
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,150
is very vigilant.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,260
Give me some more time.

52
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,750
I heard the Moon Shadow Sect has been disbanded.

53
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,610
What happened?

54
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,080
Will it have an impact

55
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,740
on our plan?

56
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,480
Don't worry.

57
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,910
I will take the secret book

58
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,040
to the Xiaoyao Sect.

59
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:23,360
You've been working undercover by her side.

60
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,090
You spend time together every day.

61
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,920
Did you find anything different during this period?

62
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,600
What do you mean

63
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,380
by "anything different"?

64
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,830
You know

65
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,360
how well Master treats you.

66
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,120
Don't let everyone down.

67
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,510
Find the secret book as soon as possible.

68
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,840
If there is no other way,

69
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,530
you can figure out a way to kill her.

70
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,270
Let's go.

71
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,270
Get lost!

72
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,680
Nanxi.

73
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,830
Nanxi.

74
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,240
Nanxi.

75
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,560
Nanxi.

76
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,050
There was poison on the sword.

77
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,360
Nanxi.

78
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,750
Master,

79
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,750
Shen Yu got Senior Sang Kun killed first

80
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,210
and saved Feng Nanxi then.

81
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:21,840
Has he...

82
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,520
really been bewitched by that she-devil?

83
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,240
Are you sure it was Shen Yu who saved Feng Nanxi?

84
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,720
Yes.

85
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,560
This place is...

86
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,820
Xiangyang Residence?

87
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,680
You're awake.

88
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,360
This place is Xiangyang Residence?

89
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,159
How do you know this place is Xiangyang Residence?

90
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:48,800
I...

91
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,290
accidentally heard about it.

92
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,620
I've never told anyone about this place.

93
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,580
How do you know this place?

94
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,830
How do you know this place?

95
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,270
You said

96
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,870
I'm the most important person to you.

97
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,600
You've tried so hard to find me,

98
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,410
but you don't even know who I am.

99
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,360
You are...

100
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,950
Ye Wuchen?
