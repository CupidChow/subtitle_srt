1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,880
We must find a way to lure Feng back to the sect.

3
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,880
Shen Yu.

4
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,110
Stop dawdling, hurry up.

5
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,550
I'm already changed.

6
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,670
Ye Wuchen?

7
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,510
Right.

8
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,470
This is the best look of Ye Wuchen in my mind.

9
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,280
Chief.

10
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,320
You still haven’t told me

11
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,100
why I’m dressed like this.

12
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,640
Didn't you say

13
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,310
Ye Wuchen

14
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,039
is a hero who appears and disappears like a ghost?

15
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:17,480
Yes.

16
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,039
I need you

17
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,970
to help me lure him out.

18
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,840
Ye Wuchen, right?

19
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,710
From now on, if you don't have money,

20
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,789
don't come to brothels.

21
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:30,250
Don't let me see you again.

22
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,920
On my way here,

23
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,950
I heard the disciples from other sects planning

24
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,070
to besiege the Moon Shadow Sect.

25
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,000
And here you are,

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,729
making me dress up as Ye Wuchen to visit a brothel.

27
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:48,070
Ye Wuchen is a hero.

28
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:48,800
He's famous.

29
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,310
I want you to impersonate him

30
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,640
and ruin his reputation.

31
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,440
I don't believe he won’t show up.

32
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,280
Does Ye Wuchen

33
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:56,950
owe you a favor

34
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,710
or money?

35
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,120
Why do you care so much?

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,780
Keep going.

37
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:03,470
Chief.

38
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,640
Where are we going next?

39
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,970
When we’re in town, stop calling me Chief.

40
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,280
Umbrellas.

41
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,150
Silk fabrics.

42
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,190
Umbrellas.

43
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,310
Everyone, come and see.

44
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,570
Look at the umbrellas.

45
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,000
Chief.

46
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,240
Chief.

47
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,300
Master.

48
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,590
What is it?

49
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,870
Master.

50
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,720
I just bought some delicious pastries today.

51
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,750
Shall I

52
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,280
take you to try them?

53
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,090
You're always the most considerate.

54
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,680
Master.

55
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,870
The Chief just returned from a battle with the Xiaoyao Sect.

56
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,530
You’d better not disturb her.

57
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,800
You know

58
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,520
the chief has the Cloud Absorption Spell.

59
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,920
If she really gets angry,

60
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,030
it’s you who will suffer.

61
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,000
As the Chief Guardian, it’s only natural to be concerned

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,460
about the chief’s safety.

63
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,079
Master.

64
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,590
Master!

65
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,520
Master!

66
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,480
Why are you staring at me?

67
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,310
Where is Chief?

68
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
I don’t know

69
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,190
the Chief’s whereabouts.

70
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,079
You are the steward in charge of the paramours.

71
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:56,120
You are unaware if the chief had summoned any paramour to her chambers

72
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,980
in recent days?

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,280
What I said is true.

74
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,400
If I hide anything,

75
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,530
I'll be struck by...

76
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,970
I thought too much.

77
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,850
You don't have to swear such a heavy oath.

78
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,000
Get up.

79
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:32,630
Master.

80
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,630
There’s a secret report from the town.

81
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,720
Shen Yu is asking for help

82
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,510
to lure the she-devil back to the sect.

83
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,310
Why did Shen Yu

84
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,040
go down the mountain with Feng Nanxi?

85
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,600
I thought

86
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,840
this was a good opportunity.

87
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,110
With the she-devil gone,

88
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,360
we can take this chance to attack the demon sect.

89
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,220
Not a good idea.

90
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,040
We must trust Shen Yu.

91
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,270
If we act rashly now,

92
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,270
we might alert the enemy.

93
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,490
Not only we can't get the secret book,

94
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,560
Shen Yu will also be suspected.

95
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,950
Do as he says.

96
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,110
Yes.

97
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,160
Place your bets.

98
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,630
Hands off when bets are closed.

99
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,360
Bet on small.

100
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,190
Big. Big.

101
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,230
Open!

102
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,360
I won again.

103
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,560
It's all mine.

104
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,000
Pay up.

105
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,100
Come on. Pay up.

106
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,160
If I bet big...

107
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,360
I'm called Ye Wuchen.

108
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,720
Pay up.

109
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,520
Right, what's going on?

110
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,870
My name is Ye Wuchen.

111
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,800
Okay, you are Ye Wuchen.

112
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,950
But pay up!

113
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,240
Yeah, pay up.

114
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,040
Why are you here without money?

115
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,300
I don't have any money.

116
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,070
You don't have money?

117
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,600
Without money,

118
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,870
are you here to make trouble?

119
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,480
Right.

120
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,880
Here to mess with us, huh?

121
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,070
Are you crazy?

122
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,830
Cloud Absorption Spell!

123
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,270
Catch him!

124
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,190
Catch him!

125
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:43,950
Stop!

126
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,310
Stop!

127
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,680
Stop! Don't run!

128
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,070
Stop!

129
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,550
Don't run!

130
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,390
Stop!

131
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,390
Give me the money!

132
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,190
Stop!

133
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,270
Pay up!

134
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,920
Stop!

135
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,950
Why didn't you save me just now?

136
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,750
What's the rush?

137
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,010
Didn't I just save you?

138
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,390
This operation was too dangerous.

139
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,190
You wouldn't let me use martial arts.

140
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,390
I can't do it anymore.

141
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,420
Have I been too kind to you lately?

142
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,430
Don’t forget

143
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,000
I’m the Chief.

144
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,410
Don’t move.

145
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,070
Or I'll snap your neck.

146
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,750
Are you Ye Wuchen?

147
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,510
Yes.

148
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,160
I'm here for Ye Wuchen.

149
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:26,890
Warrior.

150
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
I'm not Ye Wuchen.

151
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,830
Don't try to lie to me.

152
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,270
I've followed you all the way.

153
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,000
It's this...

154
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,600
This lady

155
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,530
is also looking for Ye Wuchen.

156
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,800
I'm warning you.

157
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,630
She's very powerful.

158
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,920
Is he serious?

159
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,810
You know Ye Wuchen?

160
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,800
Of course.

161
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,800
He was wearing a mask last time.

162
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,730
I didn't see him.

163
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,560
Three years ago, I dueled with him.

164
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,490
I narrowly lost.

165
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,800
Now I've mastered an unparalleled sword technique.

166
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,659
I didn't expect

167
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,650
to meet you here.

168
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,100
You say he's Ye Wuchen?

169
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,070
Yes.

170
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,370
How can you be sure?

171
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,430
Cloud Absorption Spell.

172
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,390
There are always people better than you.

173
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,120
Don't be too stubborn.

174
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:18,800
Let's go.

175
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,430
I told you

176
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,720
she's amazing.

177
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,190
Master.

178
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,810
What are you doing here?

179
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,000
Master.

180
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,390
You broke into Chief’s chamber without permission.

181
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,800
You might lose your martial arts.

182
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,400
Xiaolian.

183
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,000
I saved you.

184
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,480
It was me

185
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,680
who brought you to the Moon Shadow Sect.

186
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,250
Why are you always siding with Feng Nanxi?

187
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,880
I'm not.

188
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,000
You still won’t admit it.

189
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,070
What's so good about her?

190
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,160
Would you die for her?

191
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,430
You saved me.

192
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,360
Chief took me in.

193
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,800
You both are

194
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,930
people worth protecting with my life.

195
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,270
So I don't want you

196
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,360
to be her enemy.

197
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,960
Chief treats you like a sister.

198
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,960
Why are you doing this?

199
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,850
She practiced Cloud Absorption Spell secretly.

200
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,150
I just wanted to borrow the manual for a look,

201
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,630
but she refused.

202
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,650
What kind of sister is that?

203
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,840
Ask yourself.

204
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,360
Do you really just want to see it?

205
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,200
Bad news!

206
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,470
The Xiaoyao Sect sent an attack.

207
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,510
Something seems to have happened to the Moon Shadow Sect.
