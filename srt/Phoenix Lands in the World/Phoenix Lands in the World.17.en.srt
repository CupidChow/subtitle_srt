Senior Ye and I grew up together.

00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,650
He suddenly disappeared three years ago.

133
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,430
I sent all disciples in the sect to look for him.

134
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,440
Later in your mansion,

135
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,860
I heard that you were also looking for him.

136
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,060
I wanted to get clues about him from you.

137
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,050
Do you dare to say that in Xiangyang Residence,

138
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,350
you pretended to be Ye Wuchen not to get close to me?

139
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,870
It was true at first.

140
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,860
But then,

141
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,820
I gradually fell in love with

142
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,200
living in seclusion with you in Xiangyang Residence.

143
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:16,850
I was afraid

144
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,840
that you only liked the identity of Ye Wuchen.

145
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,640
So I didn't dare to tell you.

146
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,610
I didn't want you to be disappointed.

147
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,850
I'm quite disappointed.

148
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,970
But I'm disappointed because

149
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,370
you actually think I'm that kind of person.

150
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,370
Now,

151
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,700
I have no secrets in front of you.

152
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,030
But I have a question.

153
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:47,890
Go ahead.

00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,710

As a she-devil,

156
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,880
of course, I would arrange spies around your senior.

157
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,610
Forget it if you don't want to tell me.

158
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,060
It's not that I don't want to,

159
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,420
but I don't think

160
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,670
you're ready to accept my real identity right now.

161
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,700
I promise you.

162
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,570
As long as the time is right,

163
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,100
I'll tell you all the truth.

164
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,150
Give me some time.

165
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,320
Okay?
