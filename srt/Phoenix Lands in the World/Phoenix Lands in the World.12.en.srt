[Episode 12]

5
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,460
Master.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,800
Don't go.

7
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,970
What's wrong with Master?

8
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,900
He's practicing Cloud Absorption Spell.

9
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,220
But Master has always

10
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,060
been the person I respect the most.

11
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,450
Do you still think

12
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,230
he practiced Cloud Absorption Spell just to break it?

13
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,760
It's time for you to wake up.

14
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,400
Maybe Master...

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,660
Do you really think so?

16
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,790
You are usually smart.

17
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,690
Why are you so confused now?

18
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,190
Look how he's obsessed with martial arts.

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,620
Master adopted me.

20
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,000
He taught me

21
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,610
that no matter when,

22
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,690
I should ensure the safety of the Martial Arts World

23
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,020
and uphold justice.

24
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,770
I never dare to forget my duty.

25
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:23,650
Now it seems

26
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,260
my master is practicing the Cloud Absorption Spell.

27
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,860
Then the purpose of my existence

28
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,300
is simply a joke.

29
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,100
Don’t think like that.

30
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:34,240
Although Shangguan Ye is a hypocrite,

31
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,950
he taught you right.

32
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,180
Someone has to protect the Martial Arts World.

33
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,960
That's why you exist.

34
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,870
But I don't know

35
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,210
what is right,

36
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,410
what is wrong,

37
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,759
what is true,

38
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,690
and what is fake.

39
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,930
I'm getting more and more confused.

40
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,979
Believe in your instinct.

41
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,340
You are my Ye Wuchen.

42
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,300
Junior. Let's practice together.

43
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,650
Okay, Senior Wuchen.

44
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,490
What’s wrong?

45
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:20,960
Nothing. Let's go.

46
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,750
Anyway, there will be a way.

47
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,000
Don't worry too much.

48
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,280
Do you really think

49
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,690
I'm deaf and blind?

50
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,100
Shen Yu.

51
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:36,829
Come here.

52
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,560
Don't go.

53
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,140
You go first.

54
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,510
Are you really so obssessed with the she-devil

55
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,540
that you can even give up your life?

56
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,120
Master.

57
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,329
Don't call me master.

58
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,640
You betrayed our sect for the she-devil.

59
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,560
Today,

60
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,420
I will purge you, the traitor.

61
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,310
You've really practiced Cloud Absorption Spell.

62
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,090
I just want to find the flaw of this technique.

63
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,100
People from your so-called righteous sects are really so shameless.

64
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,550
If you want to know the secret,

65
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,079
just take a few more of my strikes.

66
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,340
Don't mislead others.

67
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,720
Let's go.

68
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,970
Are you still troubled by what happened to your master?

69
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,910
Don't worry.

70
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,220
You haven't eaten anything all day.

71
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,280
Let me cook for you.

72
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,560
You can cook?

73
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,280
Try it.

74
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,830
See how it tastes.

75
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,660
It's my first time cooking.

76
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,370
Is it good?

77
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,760
Yes.

78
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:21,760
Really?

79
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,040
Let me try it.

80
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,490
People from your Xiaoyao Sect are really interesting.

81
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,300
No matter the food is delicious or not,

82
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,320
just tell the truth.

83
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,360
Why did you lie?

84
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,150
Or

85
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,010
is it until now,

86
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,000
you've never been honest with me?

87
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,200
No.

88
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,409
Let's play a game.

89
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,000
After having a sip of wine,

90
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,690
we can ask each other a question.

91
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,690
No lie is allowed.

92
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,530
I'll go first.

93
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:56,720
Okay.

94
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,060
Please.

95
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,490
Why have you been looking for

96
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,690
me?

97
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,940
You haven't drunk yet.

98
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,500
Ye Wuchen has always been the light of justice in my heart.

99
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,800
He is a person with a strong sense of right and wrong.

100
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,320
If I find him

101
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,110
and make him see that the Moon Shadow Sect is not evil,

102
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,560
maybe those women with a hard life

103
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,680
will end differently.

104
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,870
Or

105
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,100
if I can take him to see teh true color of Shangguan Ye,

106
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,850
maybe there will be changes

107
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,670
in the overall situation of the Martial Arts World.

108
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,810
I just didn't say I was going to kill you.

109
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,150
I'm not completely lying.

110
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:52,700
It's my turn.

111
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,910
Why should it be you who came to the Moon Shadow Sect

112
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,080
to kill me

113
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,010
and steal the secret book?

114
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,340
The Xiaoyao Sect

115
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,550
is actually

116
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,230
divided into two branches, the Zhouzong and the Dark Clan.

117
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,310
Usually,

118
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,510
those you see wearing white robes,

119
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,200
detached from worldly affairs,

120
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,230
and fully devoted to martial arts practice

121
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,360
are mostly disciples of the Zhouzong.

122
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,660
Then you are...

123
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:27,960
I'm from the Dark Division.

124
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,360
I inquire about information for my master,

125
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,830
kill corrupt officials

126
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,490
and safeguard justice.

127
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,110
I pretended to be Shen Yu

128
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:38,890
because in recent years,

129
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,590
many disciples of the Dark Division.

130
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,409
We're short-handed.

131
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,460
Besides, the Moon Shadow Sect

132
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,190
is not an idle place.

133
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,010
Only I can take the risk.

134
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,760
Except for I'm not Ye Wuchen,

135
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,150
I told you everything I know.

136
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,390
Come on, let's

137
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:58,990
continue the game.

138
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,040
Don't help me. I want more.

139
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,220
Ye Wuchen.

140
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,720
When I get back,

141
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,830
I'll write

142
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,680
good scenes for you.

143
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,880
I'll write lot.

144
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,240
Actually, I'm not Ye Wuchen.

145
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,630
I know.

146
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,950
Your name is Shen Yu.

147
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,630
The name Ye Wuchen is too burdensome for you.

148
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,200
Too burdensome.

149
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,490
But it's okay.

150
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:44,780
I'll protect you

151
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,240
from now on.

152
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,680
I'll protect you.

153
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,680
I hate people bothering me.

154
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,380
We need you to find out where Feng Nanxi is.

155
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,780
You are just a bunch of treacherous villains.

156
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,210
Why should I help you?

157
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,980
Feng Nanxi destroyed your martial arts

158
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,180
and Moon Shadow Sect.

159
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,080
But Xiaolian is still by her side.

160
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,560
In this world,

161
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,440
only you and us have the same goal.

162
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,290
At least we will kill Feng Nanxi

163
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,390
and avenge you.

164
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:33,960
Wuhuan.

165
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,159
Wait for my news.

166
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,090
Wuhuan.

167
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,510

Who

169
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,150
were you talking to?

170
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,190
You were not here.

171
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,180
I was just talking to a stray cat.

172
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,340
Sorry, Wuhuan.

173
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,760
I came back late.

174
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,980
Ye Wuchen.

175
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,480
Why are you still sleeping?

176
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,210
We should go down the mountain.

177
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,440
Okay.

178
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,880
Hurry up.
