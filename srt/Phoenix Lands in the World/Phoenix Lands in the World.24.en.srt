5
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,440
It's my story.

00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,000
Who are you to decide its ending?

7
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,180
Ye Wuchen,

8
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,120
anyway, I feel guilty towards you.

9
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:55,910
I deleted you.

10
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,190
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,730
You deleted everything about me,

12
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,630
except my name.

13
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,790
Over the past three years,

14
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,720
my life has been like a living hell.

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,840
I've been wandering in this world like a lonely ghost.

16
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,470
I really don't know

17
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,720
why it has become like this.

18
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,720
This has nothing to do with you.

19
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:24,650
Senior Ye,

20
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,300
although she deleted the story about you,

21
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,630
your own story

22
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,280
should be written by yourself.

23
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,080
Easy for you to say.

24
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,080
Do you think

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,080
fate can be easily changed?

00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,670
Shen Yu,

27
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,690
she has fallen in love with you.

28
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,000
She'll be trapped

29
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,710
in this world forever unless she kills you.

30
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,539
-Chief.
-Chief.

31
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:57,270
Are you okay?

32
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,110
You assassin!

33
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,350
How dare you break into the Xiaoyao Sect!

34
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,220
I'm going to kill you!

35
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:00,620
Stop!

36
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,430
He is Senior Ye.

37
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:05,710
Senior Ye?

38
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,420
Ye Wuchen?

39
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,139
He already died, right?

40
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,449
Take Senior Ye back to the Wuling Land.

41
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,360
Don't hurt him.

42
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:12,800
Yes.

43
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,520
Chief,

Do you still want...

46
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,760
to hold your wedding?

47
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,650
Yes.

48
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,680
Why is it the bridegroom who wears a veil here?

49
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,780
This

50
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,740

Since you're marrying a she-devil, you should follow my traditions.

Come on.

This

59
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,460
is a wedding tradition in our world.

60
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,070
The bride and the bridegroom need to exchange

61

heart-shaped diamond rings.

62
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,300
It represents a lifelong promise to each other.

63
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,960
I'm giving one to you too.

65
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,640

66
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,080
Do you really...

67
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,290
not regret staying here?

68
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,270
I don't.

69
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:27,510
I think...

70
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,340
this place is quite good.

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,980
Most importantly,

72
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:35,350
I won't be rushed by hateful Party A to submit scripts here.

for your today's decision.

79

00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,510
Actually, I thought about it these days.

96

Maybe we

97
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,040
really have gone too far.

98
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:01,830
So I want

99
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,400
to talk to you about our story in person.

106

I... I mistook you for someone else.

00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,190
Miss Meng,

112
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,710

Thank you.

114

No big deal.

115
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,180
You can revise it as you like.

As long as you are happy.

117
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,870
It's okay.

118
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,820
I just had a dream.

119
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,090
In my dream, there was someone who looked exactly like you.

120
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,550
Every time I used the Cloud Absorption Spell on him like this,

121
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,340
he would be drawn close to me.
