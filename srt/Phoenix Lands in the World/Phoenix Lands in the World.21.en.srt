[Episode 21]

5
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:38,850
Recently,

6
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,330
I've always felt that Wuhuan has been acting weirdly.

7
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,130
What's wrong?

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,710
Although

9
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,440
recently, she has always smiled

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,590
while looking at me,

11
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,150
and she has become much gentler,

12
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,280
I always feel that

13
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,560
the distance between us

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,260
seems to be getting longer and longer.

15
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,210
Sometimes,

16
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,270
while she's doing something, she always has that

17
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,640
cold look in her eyes.

18
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,040
I hope that I've just thought too much.

19
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,310
Xiaolian!

20
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,330
Xiaolian!

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,870
Nanxi!

22
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,320
Nanxi, come out now!

23
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,520
Something wrong happened to Xiaolian!

24
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:38,470
Xiaolian.

25
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,150
Xiaolian.

26
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,140
The Xiaoyao Sect came here to attack us just now.

27
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,200
In order to save me,

28
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,789
Xiaolian…

29
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,800
Xiaolian.

30
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,800
Xiaolian!

31
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,830
Xiaolian.

32
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,300
Shen Yu...

33
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,800
Shen Yu betrayed you.

34
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,640
You have to trust Xiaolian.

35
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,940
I heard it with my own ears.

36
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,539
Go ask Ji Wuhuan to come here.

37
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,980
Okay.

38
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,280
Cloud Absorption Spell!

39
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,440
It's late now.

40
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,860
Why isn't Junior back yet?

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,080
You aren't Shen Yu.

42
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,380
This feinting tactic is so good.

43
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,220
Who on earth are you?

44
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,490
You also pretended to be Ji Wuhuan, right?

45
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,280
Both Ji Wuhuan and Xiaolian

46
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,460
were killed by me.

47
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,170
Who on earth are you?

48
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,750
Who do you think I am?

49
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,860
Why did you kill Xiaolian and Ji Wuhuan?

50
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,710
You only care about their fate.

51
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,090
You treat everyone well,

52
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,720
but you are so cruel to me.

53
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,210
Have we met before?

54
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:07,970
Yes.

55
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,750
Of course we've met before.

56
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,460
And we've seen each other countless times.

57
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,920
You're talking nonsense!

58
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,350
What?

59
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,820
Have you forgotten the person you created?

60
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,460
You are Ye Wuchen?

61
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,800
You thought of me finally.

62
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,800
How... How come you...

63
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,760
Because of you,

64
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,450
I've become like this now.

65
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,760
Three years ago,

66
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,520
I accidentally found that in order to

67
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,850
take away the secret books of other sects,

68
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,730
Shangguan Ye killed those Dark Division's disciples who were sent out

69
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,990
to carry out a mission.

70
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,430
From then on,

71
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,600
I've been investigating the case to find the evidence for his crimes.

72
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,130
After I found all the evidence for his crimes,

73
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,840
I could have made it public.

74
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,630
But

75
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,700
considering that he had brought me up,

76
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,890
I couldn't bear to do it.

77
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,400
I wanted to persuade him to realize his own mistakes and turn over a new leaf.

78
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,600
I didn't expect that though he said yes,

79
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,880
he poisoned my food.

80
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,370
I thought that

81
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,560
I would die soon.

82
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,980
But I didn't expect that

83
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,840
I would suddenly recover one day.

84
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,190
However,

85
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,310
the poison changed the structure of my body,

86
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,900
which made me look totally different

87
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,500
and turned me into a monster.

88
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,740
From then on,

89
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,440
I've also got the ability to transform myself into anyone.

90
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,260
But I just can't remember my own face.

91
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,080
Except for my name,

92
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,830
I've almost forgotten who I am.

93
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,140
I also don't know

94
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,810
why I exist in this world.

95
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,550
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,390
I shouldn't have

97
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,780
changed your fate arbitrarily.

98
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,210
Do you just want to

99
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,040
end this all by saying sorry

100
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,860
so simply and so casually?

101
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,010
The story hasn't come to an end yet.

102
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,590
Since

103
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,930
you know who I am,

104
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,770
then let me

105
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,050
write a new story for you.

106
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,330
I think we should listen to Shen Yu's advice

107
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,100
and give up attacking the Moon Shadow Sect.

108
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,470
Our master is dead now.

109
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,630
Besides, the she-devil is the only one left in the Moon Shadow Sect.

110
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,440
She hasn't done anything bad lately indeed.

111
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,300
Nonsense!

112
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,820
Senior Shen Yu clearly said that

113
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,150
he would collaborate with us internally and externally in the Moon Shadow Sect tomorrow

114
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,320
in order to catch the witch at one stroke.

115
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,990
Shen Yu,

116
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,900
you agreed to attack the she-devil with us, right?

117
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
The she-devil has been caught by me.

118
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,150
I've locked her up on the Wuling Land.

119
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:39,950
She's on the Wuling Land.

120
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,010
Fellow senior disciples,

121
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,010
I have a question.

122
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,850
Senior, please go ahead.

123
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,830
The Xiaoyao Sect doesn't have a leader now.

124
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,909
Shall we

125
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:49,430
elect the most suitable person

126
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,159
as the chief?

127
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,880
Logically speaking,

128
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,750
we should elect Senior Sang Kun as the chief.

129
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,620
But he's dead now.

130
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,310
The other fellow disciples

131
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,320
joined our sect at the same time.

132
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,140
We can't tell who came first.

133
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,700
Then as the most senior fellow disciple of the Dark Division,

134
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,130
should I

135
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,100
inherit the position of chief?

136
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,080
I object to it!

137
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,770
The Dark Division is for those disgraceful disciples.

138
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,320
How can we let someone from the Dark Division

139
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,120
be the chief of the Xiaoyao Sect?

140
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,670
Who else wants to object to it?

141
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,360
-Well...
-Well...

142
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,740
On August 15th,

143
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,700
I'll marry Feng Nanxi from the Moon Shadow Sect.

144
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,120
Yes, Chief!
