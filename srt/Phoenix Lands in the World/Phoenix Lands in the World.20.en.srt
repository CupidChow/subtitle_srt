[Episode 20]

5
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,110
So cruel.

6
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,900
If it wasn't the she-devil of the Moon Shadow Sect,

7
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,220
who else could it be?

8
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,680
Feng Nanxi didn't kill him.

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,720
She can only use the Cloud Absorption Spell

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,020
when I'm by her side.

11
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,540
That's right. Master told us before.

12
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,920
How could a devil only know one type of martial arts skill?

13
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,870
Junior, you're still inexperienced.

14
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,209
Don't be fooled by such an obvious trick.

15
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,630
-That's right.
-That's right.

16
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,360
-That's right.
-That's right.

17
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,430
The evidence is right in front of us.

18
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,350
You also saw it that day.

19
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,830
Master used the Cloud Absorption Spell.

20
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,230
Why don't you believe me?

21
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:14,950
But...

22
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,110
But Master took the risk

23
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,470
to practice the Cloud Absorption Spell

24
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,470
in order to study it.

25
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,020
It's a pity that he lost his mind.

26
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,080
Such being the case,

27
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,990
you and the she-devil

28
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,520
pushed Master to his death?

29
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,940
You're so stubborn.

30
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,030
-Where are you going?
-Where are you going?

31
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,060
It's none of your business.

32
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,530
As long as you're still a member of the Xiaoyao Sect,

33
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,130
we have the responsibility to prevent you from making mistakes!

34
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:07,970
Wuhuan.

35
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,190
What took you so long?

36
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,120
Where did you go?

37
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,230
I went to the shop

38
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,380
to take a look at our recent revenue.

39
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,280
Wuhuan,

40
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,590
are you...

41
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,250
hiding something from me?

42
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,730
No.

43
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,290
It's just I've been busy lately.

44
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,530
I'm a little tired.

45
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:47,990
Shen Yu?

46
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,480
Why is he here?

47
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,770
Senior Shen Yu,

48
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,050
yesterday, didn't you say

49
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,670
you wouldn't allow us to besiege the she-devil?

50
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,870
Today, why are you...

51
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,360
Why would I expose my identity as a spy easily?

52
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,080
Don't worry.

53
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,630
Soon,

54
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,010
I will go back to that she-devil again.

55
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,140
On the 15th day of the eighth lunar month,

56
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,220
I'll cooperate with you.

57
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,910
The cult

58
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,710
has to be destroyed.

59
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,360
Chief!

60
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,470
Chief!

61
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,190
Chief.

62
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,120
Shen Yu...

63
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,840
Shen Yu betrayed you.

64
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,630
Betrayed?

65
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,790
This word is too exaggerated.

66
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,050
It's true, Chief.

67
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,700
I know

68
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,840
you've always had prejudice against him.

69
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,880
Maybe there's some misunderstanding again.

70
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,980
You must trust me.

71
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,140
I heard it with my own ears.

72
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,180
All right.

73
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:58,880
Look.

74
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,690
-Look how flustered you are.
-Shen Yu.

75
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,290
Shen Yu,

76
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,640
you came at the right time.

77
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,390
Tell me.

78
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,270
What did you do to betray me?

79
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,570
Xiaolian,

80
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,149
what did I say?

81
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,300
Chief,

82
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,600
I...

83
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,640
I was just kidding.

84
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:24,190
Chief,

85
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,570
I'm leaving.

86
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,680
Go.

87
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,640
Come and sit.

88
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,070
Senior Shen Yu,

89
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,270
you have talked with seniors and juniors

90
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,670
for so many days.

91
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,080
They won't listen to you.

92
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,630
You should go back.

93
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,710
If I go back,

94
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,230
who's going to stop them?

95
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,370
I need you to do something for me.

96
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,230
Deliver this letter

97
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,340
to Feng Nanxi, the chief of the Moon Shadow Sect.

98
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,630
Don't worry.

99
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,690
She won't hurt you.

100
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,470
Okay, Senior Shen Yu.

101
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:14,960
Senior Shen Yu?

102
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,180
Didn't he say he wouldn't come back?

103
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,310
Why did he ask me to deliver the letter?

104
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,170
The Xiaoyao Sect.

105
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:21,720
Chief!

106
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,300
The Xiaoyao Sect is here to attack us!

107
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,110
No.

108
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,670
Shen Yu asked me to come here.

109
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,900
Shen Yu asked you to come here?

110
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,140
Senior Shen Yu asked me

111
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,340
to deliver a letter to Chief Feng Nanxi.

112
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:32,690
He said

113
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:34,570
he won't be back anytime soon.

114
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:35,440
Also,

115
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,340
he said he wants

116
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,440
to stop the sects from besieging the Moon Shadow Sect.

117
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,659
Oh no!

118
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,200
Someone is pretending to be Shen Yu.

119
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,159
Wuhuan, hurry up.

120
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,740
The current Shen Yu is fake.

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,790
Fake?

122
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,140
I saw it with my own eyes.

123
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,450
The real Shen Yu

124
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,330
is still in the Xiaoyao Sect.

125
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:56,560
Let's go.

126
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,760
Let's go tell Chief.

127
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,180
Hurry.

128
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,930
You're not Wuhuan.

129
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,900
Where is Wuhuan?

130
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,220
So,

131
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,140
how does it feel to know

132
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,580
the one you love is dead?

133
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,840
But it's okay.

134
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,640
You'll meet each other soon.

135
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,040
Chief.

136
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,360
Go.

137
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,470
Recently,

138
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,330
I've always felt something is wrong with Wuhuan.

139
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,850
She always looked cold

140
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,350
when she was doing things.

141
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
Hopefully, I'm just overthinking.

142
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:15,970
Nanxi!

143
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,250
Nanxi, come out!

144
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,110
Something happened to Xiaolian!

145
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,200
Xiaolian.

146
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:31,850
Xiaolian.

147
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,190
The Xiaoyao Sect came to attack us just now.

148
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,330
In order to save me,

149
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,850
Xiaolian...

150
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,630
Xiaolian.

151
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,840
Xiaolian!

152
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,090
Xiaolian.

153
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,940
Shen Yu...

154
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,470
Shen Yu betrayed you.

155
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,670
You must trust me.

156
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,210
I heard it with my own ears.

157
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,640
Shen Yu would never betray me.

158
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,480
Go ask Ji Wuhuan here.

159
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,070
Okay.

160
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,030
The Cloud Absorption Spell.
