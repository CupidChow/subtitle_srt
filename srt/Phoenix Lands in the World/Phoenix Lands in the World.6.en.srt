1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,600
You weren't in the room serving me in the middle of the night.

3
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,000
Where exactly did you go?

4
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,320
Actually...

5
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,250
I went to Shisi's grave.

6
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,150
I wanted to see her for the last time.

7
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,550
You're smooth-tongued.

8
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,260
Only the three of us

9
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,790
knew Chief left the sect.

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,980
If you didn't spread the news,

11
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,430
how could the Xiaoyao Sect

12
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,920
make such a careful plan

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,070
in such a short time?

14
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:00,960
Little Shisi

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,030
died because of you!

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,510
Chief always asked me to pretend to be Ye Wuchen

17
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,510
and cause trouble outside the sect.

18
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,590
It's inevitable that someone observant would notice me.

19
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,310
Right?

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,870
So, of course we were not the only ones

21
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,470
who knew Chief left the sect.

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,680
You...

23
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,230
Enough!

24
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,640
Chief, you can't trust him.

25
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,120
Let him go.

26
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,360
Let him go!

27
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,200
Chief.

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,400
Stop!

29
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:34,000
Cut the crap.

30
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,560
Come with me.

31
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,479
Little Shisi, you know what?

32
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,950
In the real world,

33
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:43,680
a girl at your age

34
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,280
is still studying in school,

35
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,350
wanting to be successful.

36
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,840
I need to find Ye Wuchen as soon as possible

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,840
and return to my happy world.

38
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,590
I will also make you guys

39
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,280
live a wealthy and peaceful life here.

40
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,169
Chief asked you

41
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,710
to sort out the books here

42
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,240
by category.

43
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,760
You are not allowed to go out before you finish it.

44
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,090
She asked me to sort out the books at this hour?

45
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,490
Don't ask anything you shouldn't ask.

46
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,470
I forgot to tell you.

47
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,190
This place is the library of the Moon Shadow Sect

48
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,870
that has the most treasures.

49
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,910
Many martial arts secret books

50
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,190
are hidden here.

51
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,470
When you sort out the books,

52
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,910
don't read them.

53
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,000
This trick

54
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,470
is too childish.

55
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,520
What should I do?

56
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,610
I don't want to stay here anymore.

57
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,330
I have to find Ye Wuchen as soon as possible so that I can go back.

58
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,590
Although Shen Yu is a little strange,

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,120
I can only use

60
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,380
the Cloud Absorption Spell by using him.

61
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,150
This place has nothing I want,

62
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,560
and there are traps everywhere.

63
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,680
There's no WiFi, and the bed is hard.

64
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,760
Just let me go home as soon as possible.

65
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,520
Chief, what is this?

66
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:32,800
Well,

67
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,340
I'm just killing time.

68
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:35,920
Chief,

69
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,280
I asked Shen Yu

70
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,430
to sort out books in the library.

71
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:41,400
What?

72
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,430
I specially told him

73
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,520
there are many martial arts secret books

74
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,840
in the library.

75
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:48,340
I also asked someone to keep an eye on him.

76
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,800
If he is up to something,

77
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,520
he will give himself away soon.

78
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,020
Who asked you to do that without permission?

79
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,840
Isn't this what you meant?

80
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,240
I don't have time for that.

81
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,160
Let him go now.

82
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,750
I want to leave here with him.

83
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,630
Leave here?

84
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,000
Chief, you can't.

85
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,250
Why do you come to me every day?

86
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,080
Won't your master feel unhappy?

87
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,040
She...

88
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,860
She hasn't talked to me for a few days.

89
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,520
In my opinion,

90
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,920
Ji Wuhuan

91
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,160
is not someone who can be entrusted with true love.

92
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,520
Chief,

93
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,490
let's not talk about that now.

94
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,000
You can't leave here now.

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,860
Think about it.

96
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,990
Currently,

97
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,920
the Moon Shadow Sect

98
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,120
has just suffered heavy losses.

99
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,270
If you leave now,

100
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,200
no one will be in charge of the sect.

101
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,480
Then the Moon Shadow Sect

102
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,870
will be wiped out.

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,800
I have an idea.

104
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,160
Chief, what are you doing?

105
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,190
Disbanding the Moon Shadow Sect.

106
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,450
You want to disband the Moon Shadow Sect?

107
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,560
Calm down.

108
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,400
I'm not really disbanding the sect.

109
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,480
I just want to change your lifestyle.

110
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,290
Have you heard of the saying that true hermits live in noisy cities?

111
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,430
Do you know

112
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,390
how to hide a drop of water?

113
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,600
How?

114
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,920
Put that drop of water into the sea.

115
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,390
I can't let

116
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,510
Shisi's tragedy

117
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,310
happen on these girls again.

118
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,000
But I have to figure out a way

119
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,390
to let them do something else.

120
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,080
I can't let them starve.

121
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,760
Everyone says our chief is a she-devil.

122
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,750
But in my opinion,

123
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,920
you are the most selfless person.

124
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,650
Actually, I have selfish motives.

125
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,040
As long as the Moon Shadow Sect exists,

126
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,700
it'll become a common target.

127
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,680
I don't want to be trapped like this.

128
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,550
No matter what you want to do,

129
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,910
you have my support.

130
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,360
But...

131
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,390
Chief,

132
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,630
why don't you drive glib-tongued Shen Yu away?

133
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,270
I will accompany you to find Ye Wuchen.

134
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,270
What do you think?

135
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,950
Have you finished sorting out the books?

136
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,870
Yes.

137
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:27,560
Chief,

138
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,360
in addition to sorting them out,

139
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,510
I made a list for you.

140
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,920
It has all the information you want.

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,560
Okay.

142
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,830
Xiaolian, you may leave.

143
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,630
From now on,

144
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,880
just stay by my side.

145
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,980
Don't go anywhere.

146
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,040
Don't try to play tricks.

147
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:49,990
Do you hear me?

148
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,920
I didn't.

149
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,240
Chief,

150
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,760
what are you drawing?

151
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,040
I haven't finished drawing yet.

152
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:57,870
I can help you.

153
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,360
No.

154
00:06:59,030 --> 00:06:59,960
Close your eyes.

155
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,240
You're peeping?

156
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,830
Get out.

157
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,390
You want the Moon Shadow Sect's members to do business?

158
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,160
Why don't you just say you want to disband the sect?

159
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,920
No.

160
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,680
I just want everyone

161
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,720
to have food to eat

162
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,320
and clothes to wear.

163
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,159
I object.

164
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,040
The former chief established the Moon Shadow Sect

165
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,800
at this strategically important place

166
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,560
to gather the weak

167
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,920
to protect everyone.

168
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,480
Your proposal

169
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,720
completely goes against the former chief's intention.

170
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,600
You just don't understand

171
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,130
what I said just now, right?

172
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,390
What's the use of following the rules?

173
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,159
Can gathering together protect us?

174
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,240
When the Xiaoyao Sect attacked us,

175
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,500
as the chief guardian,

176
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,920
did you successfully protect everyone?

177
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,750
Have you forgotten Shisi's death

178
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,040
and how she died?

179
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,970
Chief Guardian.

180
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:09,920
Right.

181
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,270
You don't need

182
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,130
to find paramours for me anymore.

183
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,430
Chief,

184
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,430
but...

185
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,560
No buts.

186
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,070
Now,

187
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,390
I already have him.

188
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,080
Feng Nanxi

189
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,380
is increasingly losing the demeanor of a chief.

190
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:43,809
This is no different from disbanding the Moon Shadow Sect.

191
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,320
She is with Shen Yu every day.

192
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,210

193
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,110

194
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,390

00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,870

196
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,670
