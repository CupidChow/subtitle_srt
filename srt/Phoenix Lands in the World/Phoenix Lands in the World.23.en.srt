5
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,270
Where is he?

6
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,430
Take a guess.

7
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,070
Surprised, Shen Yu?

8
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,340
You ungrateful thing!

9
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,470
Junior. Let’s practice together.

10
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,700
Okay, Senior Wuchen.

11
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:37,390
-One, two.
-One, two.

12
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:39,780
Three.

13
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,500
Four.

14
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,880
Senior Wuchen.

15
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,920
It’s you.

16
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,000
You’re not that stupid.

17
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,610
Senior Wuchen.

18
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,680
I've been looking for you all this time.

19
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,350
Why?

20
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,550
Your words sound nice.

21
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,930
Little Shen Yu.

22
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,300
You are not as cute as you were when you were young.

23
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,130
The evidence against Shangguan Ye was exchanged for my life.

24
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,190
He poisoned me,

25
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,350
turning me into someone unrecognizable.

26
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,190
And you?

27
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,500
Not only did a beautiful girl throw herself at you.

28
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,620
When I wasn't around,

29
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,010
you even got credit

30
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,680
for eliminating the traitors for the sect.

31
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,030
Have you ever thought

32
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,680
about why such great luck

33
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,270
would fall on a little beggar like you

34
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,870
who has no parents?

35
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,060
Senior Wuchen.

36
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,900
All of this

37
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,790
is because of her.

38
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:42,770
Her?

39
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,730
Feng Nanxi?

40
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,170
What did you do to her?

41
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,630
Don't worry.

42
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,620
She’s not dead.

43
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,050
Senior Wuchen.

44
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,230
What have you been through?

45
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,230
What have I been through?

46
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,240
It was you

47
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,080
who took away everything that belonged to me.

48
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,120
So now

49
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,550
I'm going to treat you as you've treated me.

50
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,670
I'm going to make you watch.

51
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:16,860
I'm

52
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,700
going to take back everything that rightfully belongs to me.

53
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:27,640
For the rest,

54
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,590
go ask her.

55
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,900
She's waiting for you inside.

56
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,840
You two should have a good chat.

57
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,980
I'll give you enough time.

58
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,560
Shen Yu.

59
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,470
How are you?

60
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:04,470
Go.

61
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,090
Hurry!

62
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,710
No.

63
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,190
Why?

64
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,490
I can't leave.

65
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,170
Don't worry about me anymore.

66
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:16,950
Just go.

67
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,630
This is my own doing.

68
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:22,800
No.

69
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,960
We must leave together.

70
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,190
Shen Yu, I lied to you.

71
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,270
I'm not Feng Nanxi.

72
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,980
My name is Meng Xiaotang.

73
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,400
I come from another world.

74
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,659
Actually, I knew

75
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,930
you weren't Feng Nanxi, the she-devil.

76
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,850
But we've been together day and night.

77
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,000
So I don't care who you are.

78
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,320
It doesn't matter.

79
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,040
I must take you away today.

80
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,790
You can't save me.

81
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,950
Use the Cloud Absorption Spell.

82
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,810
You're badly injured.

83
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,480
You'll die if I use it on you.

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,250
In my world,

85
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,600
I'm a writer.

86
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,990
Ye Wuchen and Feng Nanxi

87
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,900
are the main characters in my novel.

88
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,780
For some unavoidable reasons,

89
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,920
I deleted Ye Wuchen,

90
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,540
so I came here.

91
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,990
So

92
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,450
you've been looking for Ye Wuchen from the beginning?

93
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,610
According to the original plot setting,

94
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,030
I can only go back

95
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,760
if I find Ye Wuchen, marry him

96
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,850
and kill him.

97
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,900
Wonderful.

98
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,659
On the wedding day,

99
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,980
tearfully killing your beloved.

100
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:37,770
Meng Xiaotang,

101
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,320
are you satisfied with the ending you wrote for yourself?

102
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,980
Are you not satisfied?

103
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,490
Let me think.

104
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,310
How about

105
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,950
we try another way?

106
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,830
If you kill her,

107
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,140
I'll let you go.

108
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:01,770
Meng Xiaotang,

109
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,840
since you like

110
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,070
living in the world you created so much,

111
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,640
I'll generously

112
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,080
give you another chance.

113
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,750
Unfortunately,

114
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,160
you seem to like this little junior.

115
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,520
So from now on,

116
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,120
I'll accompany

117
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,760
your Feng Nanxi

118
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,540
instead of you.

119
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,840
Nanxi.

120
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,650
Nanxi!

121
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,750
Why should you decide

122
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,309
the ending of my own story?
