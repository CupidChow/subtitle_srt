1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,000
Are you okay?

3
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,710
Madam.

4
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:15,560
Thank you.

5
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:17,680
Are you hurt?

6
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,920
Thank you for saving me.

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,800
This is yours.

8
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:22,510
Here.

9
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,310
I'm giving this jade of harmony

10
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,510
to you two.

11
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,480
I wish you two a long and happy marriage.

12
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,280
Thank you.

13
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,390
Do you like it?

14
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,140
Take it.

15
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:41,150
This is the jade of harmony.

16
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,590
Who wants to be in harmony with you?

17
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,520
You keep it.

18
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,840
I think it's in the southwest.

19
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,720
It's not far from the Moon Shadow Sect.

20
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,920
I think it's... Something happened to the Moon Shadow Sect.

21
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,280
It has nothing to do with me. It's more important to stay alive.

22
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,680
I need to find Ye Wuchen as soon as possible.

23
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,400
No.

24
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,400
The girls in the Moon Shadow Sect are pitiful.

25
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,610
I can't leave them behind.

26
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,120
Wait a little longer.

27
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,380
Yes.

28
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,240
The Xiaoyao Sect is a decent sect.

29
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,890
I didn't expect

30
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,030
that you are so deceitful.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,800
Go on.

32
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,380
Calling you a hypocrite is praising you.

33
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,710
You're just a rascal.

34
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,250
If you dare to touch him today,

35
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,680
I will definitely

36
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,960
tear you into pieces in the future.

37
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,750
How arrogant!

38
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,360
Worry about yourself first.

39
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,590
You are beautiful.

40
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,430
I happen

41
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,310
to need a maid to wash my feet.

42
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,370
If you are willing to obey,

43
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,790
I'll spare your life.

44
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,400
Bastard.

45
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,430
Good!

46
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:31,880
You're indeed someone trained by that she-devil.

47
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,470
You're not capable,

48
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,680
but you're bad-tempered!

49
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,280
Our chief is not a she-devil!

50
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,960
You are the real devils!

51
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:41,960
Shisi!

52
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,430
Chief.

53
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,920
Chief is back.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,280
Chief is back.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,860
You she-devil,

56
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,870
I have your men.

57
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,000
I advise you not to act rashly.

58
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,520
The date we agreed upon is August 15.

59
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,890
You talked about righteousness,

60
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,900
but you have broken the rules of the martial arts world.

61
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,280
What a joke!

62
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,320
I'm a righteous man.

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,520
Do I need to choose a date

64
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,000
to kill devils and uphold righteousness?

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,800
Why is she...

66
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,519
What is righteousness?

67
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,290
What is evil?

68
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,760
I'm evil because I refuse to conspire with you?

69
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,560
Without me,

70
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,250
what's the meaning of your existence?

71
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,680
Cut the crap!

72
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Chief, watch out!

73
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,430
Nanxi!

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,310
Devil, die!

75
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,120
Get lost!

76
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,870
Hurry! Let's go!

77
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,990
They are worse than bandits.

78
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,390
We only killed Sang Kun.

79
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,520
We were too lenient.

80
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,160
We should've killed them all.

81
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,830
Enough!

82
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,870
If we solve problems by killing people,

83
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,040
when can it end?

84
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,560
Chief,

85
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,160
I think there is something strange about this.

86
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,690
Go ahead.

87
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,600
I'm leaving.

88
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,390
Chief,

89
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,070
I think the Xiaoyao Sect came

90
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,930
with a special purpose this time.

91
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,510
Look.

92
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,120
They had already subdued us before,

93
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,390
but they were in no hurry to kill us.

94
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,159
Instead,

95
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,000
they were waiting for something purposely.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,930
Of course they were waiting for me.

97
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,390
If they really

98
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,430
came for you,

99
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,800
why didn't they bring more men?

100
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,390
If they brought more men,

101
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,250
they could have a greater chance of winning, right?

102
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:58,870
Chief,

103
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,450
the secret book is not stolen, right?

104
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,240
The secret book?

105
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,970
You also want the secret book?

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,800
The Cloud Absorption Spell

107
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,680
is the most precious treasure of the Moon Shadow Sect.

108
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,080
Of course I care about it.

109
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,120
Don't worry.

110
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,270
I hid the secret book well long ago.

111
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,600
No one knows where it is.

112
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,390
I worried too much.

113
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,760
Xiaolian,

114
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,650
come with me.

115
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,830
Yes.

116
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,120
Don't move.

117
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,400
What are you going to do?

118
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,630
I saw with my own eyes

119
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,409
you saved that she-devil.

120
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,090
Senior died because of you.

121
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,510
Sang Kun refused to listen to me

122
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,490
and acted on his own.

123
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,040
Feng Nanxi can't die now.

124
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,510
Only she knows where the secret book

125
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,920
that Master wants is.

126
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,040
If we kill her,

127
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
how can we find it?

128
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,830
What do you mean?

129
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,830
I told you before

130
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,600
to lure Feng Nanxi back to the Moon Shadow Sect.

131
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,860
Why did you act rashly?

132
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,510
I had no choice.

133
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,240
What about the girl lying here?

134
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,680
You killed her without even asking.

135
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,060
Is this what righteous people should do?

136
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,720
Now, I really don't know

137
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,570
what righteousness is

138
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,650
and what evil is.

139
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,360
Shen Yu,

140
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,670
remember your identity.

141
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,750
Don't be deceived by the she-devil's appearance.

142
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,080
As for this little girl,

143
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,190
she was killed by Sang Kun.

144
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,870
He also paid the price.

145
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,240
Shen Yu,

146
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,950
I regarded you as one of us,

147
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,610
but you treated me like a fool.

148
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,730
I should think about how to punish you.

149
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,360
Chief,

150
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,480
I just went to the toilet.

151
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,480
You're lying!

152
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,290
There was no one in the toilet just now.

153
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,750
You weren't in the room serving me in the middle of the night.

154
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,870
Where exactly did you go?
