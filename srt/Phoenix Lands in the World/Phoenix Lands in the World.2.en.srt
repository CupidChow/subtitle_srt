1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,200
This character, Ji Wuhuan, hasn't changed at all.

3
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,730
I mustn't give myself away.

4
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,920
Chief, disturbing your pleasure

5
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,450
was my dereliction of duty.

6
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,390
How did the selection of the paramours go?

7
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,280
Just him.

8
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,310
I’m leaving.

9
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,920
Xiaolian.

10
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,510
You too.

11
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,590
Me too?

12
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,310
Hurry.

13
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,430
Chief!

14
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,310
Chief.

15
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,509
Didn't you just pick one person earlier?

16
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,039
Why are you taking me along?

17
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,840
Chief.

18
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:49,710
Look at you.

19
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,789
You picked me in front of everyone.

20
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,520
Aren't you afraid of exposing my identity?

21
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,759
You are the spy Feng Nanxi

22
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,710
placed by Ji Wuhuan's side.

23
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,310
In this world,

24
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,720
I can only trust you.

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,920
Let me ask you.

26
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,670
Which month's 15th is today?

27
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,240
The seventh lunar month‘s.

28
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:11,630
No.

29
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,800
The Four Great Sects

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,530
will be here in just a month.

31
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,960
Ye Wuchen.

32
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,150
As long as I kill Ye Wuchen,

33
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,079
I can go back.

34
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,310
Chief.

35
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,030
Where is Ye Wuchen now?

36
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,640
Ye Wuchen?

37
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,240
Ye Wuchen, the eldest disciple of Xiaoyao Sect.

38
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,640
Haven't you heard of him?

39
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,810
The eldest disciple of Xiaoyao Sect?

40
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,630
Chief.

41
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,000
The eldest disciple of Xiaoyao Sect

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,280
is not Ye Wuchen.

43
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,200
If I remember correctly,

44
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,030
the eldest disciple of Xiaoyao Sect

45
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,490
should be called Sang Kun.

46
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,290
Sang Kun has become the eldest disciple?

47
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,670
What about Ye Wuchen?

48
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,040
I've never heard of him.

49
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,400
Oh no.

50
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,430
I seem to have deleted Ye Wuchen.

51
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,750
Ye Wuchen is not in this world.

52
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,560
Chief.

53
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,420
I can’t go back.

54
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,560
What should I do?

55
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,960
Go away now.

56
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,040
You don’t need me anymore?

57
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,590
I don't.

58
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,430
I’m leaving.

59
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,680
Oh no.

60
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,100
The story's plot is completely changed.

61
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,870
What should I do?

62
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,400
The only way to go back is gone.

63
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,960
Chief, it’s late.

64
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,560
I am here to assist you to bed.

65
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,079
Ye Wuchen is gone too.

66
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,400
Who are these people?

67
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,710
No!

68
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,180
What are you doing?

69
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,080
Chief.

70
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,120
You chose me.

71
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,280
What else can I do?

72
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,520
I'm warning you. Don't act recklessly.

73
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,240
Or is it that I, Shen Yu,

74
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,579
am unworthy of your favor?

75
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,430
Shen Yu?

76
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,780
Did I write about this person?

77
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,020
This is completely messed up.

78
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,960
If you keep doing this, I'll call for help.

79
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,159
Call for help?

80
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,550
Am I not enough

81
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,750
for you?

82
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,270
Master.

83
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,920
Master.

84
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,630
Did someone upset you?

85
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,120
Why aren't you staying with Feng Nanxi,

86
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,520
and why did you come to me?

87
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,120
Master, you misunderstood.

88
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,240
The chief scolded me

89
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,240
and kicked me out.

90
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,920
She said

91
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,120
the quality of the new paramours in our Moon Shadow Sect

92
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,070
is getting worse and worse.

93
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,120
She asked me to find more handsome men.

94
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,520
But why did she leave you in her bedchamber?

95
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,660
Couldn't she say these things to my face?

96
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,470
She knows you are my person.

97
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,890
No one can figure out the chief's temper.

98
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,800
Master, don’t be angry.

99
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,680
But didn't you feel

100
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,480
that something was off just now?

101
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,190
What do you mean?

102
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,560
The assassin attacked just now.

103
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,950
With Feng Nanxi's skills,

104
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,390
she wouldn't have needed help from a paramour.

105
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,920
Maybe

106
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,630
Chief did it on purpose.

107
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,800
Then why did she shout for help during the day?

108
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,800
Do you think

109
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,040
she is sufferring from Qi deviation due to practising Cloud Absorption Spell

110
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,700
and lost all her martial arts?

111
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,480
What are you doing? Don’t come over.

112
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,510
Chief, since you chose me,

113
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,830
it’s my duty to serve you.

114
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,070
She really lost all her martial arts skills.

115
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,270
Great. Feng Nanxi.

116
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,740
The position of Chief should be mine.

117
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,860
You deserve your current situation.

118
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,000
Why don’t I take this chance...

119
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,600
Chief.

120
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,270
I just want to remove your clothes.

121
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,310
If you think I did something wrong,

122
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,040
I can change.

123
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,900
I don't need it.

124
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,210
I’ll call for help if you keep doing this.

125
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,870
Chief.

126
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm late.

127
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,480
Stop!

128
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,950
I don't think you're here to save her

129
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:52,830
but to kill her.

130
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,120
You pervert!

131
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,720
How dare you talk nonsense?

132
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,320
Ji Wuhuan.

133
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,750
As you can see,

134
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,560
he didn’t want to kill me.

135
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,390
Chief.

136
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,920
You may leave.

137
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,720
Yes.

138
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,780
I'll take my leave.

139
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,430
You too.

140
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,430
Get out!

141
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,310
Chief,

142
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,630
let me stay with you.

143
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,360
Are you forcing me to use Cloud Absorption Spell?

144
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,120
Cloud Absorption Spell?

145
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,920
This is... the Cloud Absorption Spell?

146
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,909
Do you want to eat something?

147
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,270
No.

148
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,750
I did hit you hard just now.

149
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,680
Are you alright?

150
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,560
As the Chief of Moon Shadow Sect,

151
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,070
why do you care about a lowly paramour?

152
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,920
I just don’t want to stain my chamber.

153
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,930
What are you doing?

154
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:39,390
Chief.

155
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,390
Someone is here.

156
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,240
It seems that you're surrounded by dangers.

157
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,700
You must need a confidant.

158
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,100
Are you really kicking me out?

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,790
Fine.

160
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,080
Since you are not interested in me,

161
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,510
I’m leaving.

162
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,840
He has a point.

163
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,200
I can't let anyone find out that I'm not Feng Nanxi.

164
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,480
I should keep up the act.
