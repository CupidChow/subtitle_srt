00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,590
Shen Yu, are you out of your mind?

6
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,430
Tell me.

7
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,040
Why did you look for me everywhere?

8
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,880
Are you really Ye Wuchen?

9
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,400
The exit of this Xiangyang Residence

10
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,600
was designed by me.

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,560
If you still don't tell me the truth,

12
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,890
I can trap you here forever.

13
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,830
I can't believe that he can go out of and come inside Ye Wuchen's secret residence freely,

14
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,220
and he even knows where the exit is.

15
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,440
As the author of the novel, I even don't know where it is.

16
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,210
Is he really Ye Wuchen?

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,080
Could it be that

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,940
this is the legendary verse, "It seems that there is no way out of the mountain,

19
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,260
but amidst shading willows and blooming flowers another village appears"?

20
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,130
With his elegant and handsome appearance, he look likes my male lead indeed.

21
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:32,770
Whatever.

22
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,450
I'd rather believe it.

23
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,390
This is my only hope currently.

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,460

25
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:50,580
Here you are.

26
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,150
Thank you.

27
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,370
You're welcome.

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,620
I didn't expect that

29
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,789
you could really catch fish.

30
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,660
Not only can I catch fish,

31
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,060
but I can catch everything in this mountain.

32
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,740
Well,

33
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,620
have you been living in this Xiangyang Residence?

34
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:11,090
This is just a secret residence of mine.

35
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,030
Where do you usually live?

36
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,710
Actually, I'm a member of the Xiaoyao Sect.

37
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,710
You are indeed a member of the Xiaoyao Sect.

38
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,560
So you stole that secret book

39
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,890
in order to give it to Shangguan Ye, right?

40
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,110
How about I ask you a question,

41
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,510
and if you answer my question honestly,

42
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,930
I'll tell you the answer?

43
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,590
Why did you take the risk to look for me here?

44
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:55,510
Just think about it.

45
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,780
Why does a woman

46
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,490
do all her best to look for a man

47
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,200
when she knows that

48
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,930
many people want to kill her in the Martial Arts World?

49
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:04,990
What is the reason?

50
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,960
I don't believe that

51
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,340
the she-devil who keeps looking for a paramour every day

52
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,870
would love someone so deeply and faithfully.

53
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,170
Devil, devil.

54
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,310
Everyone says that I'm a she-devil.

55
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,940
Think about it carefully.

56
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,990
Have I done anything immoral

57
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,800
while I'm with you during this period of time?

58
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,990
There's nothing you can say, right?

59

Because I'm Feng Nanxi.

60
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,010
I'm not a bad person.

61
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,730

62
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,640

You're the same, aren't you?

64
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,530

65
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,800
you can always find an excuse.

66

He promised me that

72
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,690
he would destroy it immediately.

73
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,190
After the secret book is destroyed,

74
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,370
the whole Martial Arts World

75
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,570
