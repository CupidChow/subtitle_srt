But why did I see the way back just now?

47
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,160
Is it because

48
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,540
Ye Wuchen is dead

49
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,840

Nothing.

You are so weak.

54
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,130
You should rest early.

00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,850
I poisoned you to death.

I couldn't sleep.

61
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,980
I went to the back mountain to take a walk.

62
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:41,430
Wuhuan.

63
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,159
You must tell me about such things

in the future.

65
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,640

68
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,150
Do you smell

69
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,350
a strange smell of blood?

70
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:54,909

77
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,690
can I go back?

78
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,560
Was the smell of blood last night from Wuhuan?

79

I have something to tell you.

80
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,170
Ye Wuchen may be alive.

81
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:45,870
What?

82
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,280
Shangguan Ye said

83
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,680
he poisoned Senior Ye with chronic poison.

84
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,870
But he couldn't find Ye Wuchen's body.

85
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,350
Senior Ye

86
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,740
has always been proficient in poisons.

87
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,760
Half of the books

88
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,790

90
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,220
I find it

91
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,980
hard to believe

92
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,980
that Senior Ye died from poisoning.

93
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,220
Then why did I react to Shen Yu?

94
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,410
If that's the case,

95
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,880
Ye Wuchen might still be alive.

96
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,110
Chief.

97
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,240
Are you still going to find him?

98
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,990
I'm a little confused now.

99
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,610
I'll go and have some quiet time alone.

100
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,780
I'll accompany her.

101
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,810
If you're worried,

102
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,020
why don't you follow them?

103
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,710
What's the use of staying here?

104
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,510
Just now,

105
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,480
you kept staring at Ji Wuhuan.

106
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,320
You hesitated to speak.

107
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,310
I saw it.

108
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,120
My situation is different from yours.

109
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,870
But I think

110
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,060
since you came to Chief,

111
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,330
she has become more gentle.

112
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,560
In the past,

113
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,170
she always had a long face.

114
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,750
But now,

115
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,630
she has more smiles.

116
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,040
It's like

117
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,100
she has turned into a different person.

118
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,450
Wuhuan.

119
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:39,640
Why are you here?

120
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,520
You seemed distracted when we were eating.

121
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,400
Is something bothering you?

122
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,600
If you can't tell those two boys,

123
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,950
you can tell me.

124
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,520
There are things

125
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,220
you won't understand.

126
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,730
Perhaps the bystander has a clearer view.

127
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,920
Let me tell you.

128
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,300
I had a dream recently.

129
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,550
In my dream,

130
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,900
I wrote a novel.

131
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,300
It's about

132
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,270
the love story between me

133
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,230
and a hero.

134
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,790
But I need to kill this hero

135
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,680
to wake up.

136
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,800
What should I do?

137
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,870
You mean

138
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,870
you need to kill

139
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:36,669
the person you love the most.
