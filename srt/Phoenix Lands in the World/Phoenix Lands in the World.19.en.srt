[Episode 19]

5
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,640
Why do you suddenly want to drink wine?

6
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,000
If Senior Ye were still alive,

7
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,280
I would go with you to find him.

8
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,470
Actually,

9
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,310
the person I've been looking for

10
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,230
has never been him.

11
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,940
I already found the person

12
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,360
I've been looking for long ago.

13
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,450
Shen Yu,

14
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,550
what should I do?

15
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,770
What do you mean?

16
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,560
I'm very worried

17
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,400
I would wake up from my dream.

18
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,639
I'm also worried

19
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,330
I could never wake up.

20
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,380
Are you sleepy?

21
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,000
No.

22
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,320
We still haven't finished the wine.

23
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,870
Cheers.

24
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:32,780
Cheers.

25
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,790
Is this

26
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,210
real or fake?

27
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,840
Is there something on my face?

28
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,490
No.

29
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,090
Chief! Chief!

30
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,260
Sorry to interrupt you, Chief.

31
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,770
Why are you so flustered?

32
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,020
Chief,

33
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,870
when I went to the town just now,

34
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,730
I heard them say

35
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,550
Shangguan Ye has gone crazy.

36
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,980
Now the Xiaoyao Sect doesn't have a leader.

37
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,790
They are in a hurry to elect the leader of the Martial Arts World.

38
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,520
They said...

39
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:53,170
They said they'll come to besiege the Moon Shadow Sect on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month.

40
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,430
What's the date today?

41
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,100
The first day of the eighth lunar month.

42
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,510
Nanxi,

43
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,390
give me a few days.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,910
I will tell them the truth.

45
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,670
Not everyone of the righteous sects

46
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,870
is as greedy as Shangguan Ye.

47
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,910
I can't let them

48
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,860
be led by the nose anymore.

49
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,210
I'll go persuade them.

50
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:12,970
You can't go.

51
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,470
It's too dangerous.

52
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,480
Do you still remember

53
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,620
my juniors let me go

54
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,310
when I saved you that day?

55
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,959
Now,

56
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,040
they already know Shangguan Ye's crimes.

57
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,500
The Xiaoyao Sect needs me.

58
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,190
What do you plan to do?

59
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,600
Actually, Shangguan Ye's crimes

60
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,070
have been recorded in a book by Senior Ye.

61
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,110
It's in Xiangyang Residence.

62
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,480
But Xiangyang Residence has been burnt down, right?

63
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,710
I was prepared long ago.

64
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,830
I hid it.

65
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,360
Okay.

66
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,860
I'll go with you.

67
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,350
Chief,

68
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,440
you can't go.

69
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,090
Now you're their main target.

70
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,360
It's too dangerous.

71
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,110
I'll go back to the Xiaoyao Sect first.

72
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,970
As long as I'm in the Xiaoyao Sect,

73
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,050
I don't think

74
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,570
they have the guts to act rashly.

75
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,500
Chief,

76
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,850
look how eager you are.

77
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,670
Besides,

78
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,460
our chief

79
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,710
is not someone

80
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,020
who cares about her reputation in the Martial Arts World.

81
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,370
I just want Shen Yu to do what he wants to do.

82
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:53,540
He always has his own righteous principles in his heart.

83
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,470
Now he's safeguarding his own righteous principles

84
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,000
by doing what he's doing.

85
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,050
But this is really unfair.

86
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,970
What if Shen Yu changes his mind?

87
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,530
If he really changes his mind,

88
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,080
maybe...

89
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,490
it's a good thing for me.

90
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,810
What about you?

91
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,370
Why haven't you been with Wuhuan lately?

92
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,390
You used to be inseparable.

93
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:22,930
Chief,

94
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,470
recently, I've always felt

95
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,600
something is wrong with Wuhuan.

96
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:28,610
What's wrong?

97
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,780
Although

98
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,300
she always

99
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,780
smiled at me

100
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,170
and has become much gentler,

101
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,440
I've always felt

102
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,440
we've drifted

103
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,170
further apart.

104
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,990
Do you smell

105
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,409
a strange smell of blood?

106
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,900
What's wrong, Wuhuan?

107
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,220
Xiaolian,

108
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,520
I want...

109
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,360
to hug you a little longer.

110
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,420
Did you do something

111
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,590
to upset her?

112
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,490
I dare not upset her.

113
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,550
Besides,

114
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,620
she hasn't been close to me lately.

115
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,290
Sometimes,

116
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,100
she looked cold

117
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,690
when she was doing things.

118
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,870
Now the Xiaoyao Sect doesn't have a leader.

119
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,510
Besides, there is no one to take charge of the overall situation after Master went missing.

120
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,940
The day of besieging the she-devil is approaching.

121
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,940
What should we do?

122
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,040
What about Senior Shen Yu of the Dark Division?

123
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,770
Shen Yu?

124
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:40,260
The one who was saved by the she-devil?

125
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:40,990
This...

126
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,390
He was saved?

127
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,659
Senior Shen Yu.

128
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,409
Shen Yu, what are you doing here?

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,460
Maybe this is the answer you are looking for.

130
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,800
This is...

131
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,220
This is Ye Wuchen's handwriting.

132
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,260
It's really Ye Wuchen's handwriting.

133
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,770
Those members of our sect

134
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,040
were actually killed... by our master?

135
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,070
That's right.

136
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,390
The Xiaoyao Sect's principle

137
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,810
has been curbing the violent and helping the weak

138
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,270
since its establishment.

139
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:13,690
However,

140
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,550
Master always told us

141
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,300
how horrible the cult is.

142
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,790
In fact, all these years,

143
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,180
the cult

144
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,290
has never done anything to our sect.

145
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,570
Senior Shen Yu is right.

146
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,980
If Feng Nanxi of the Moon Shadow Sect

147
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,450
really didn't do anything,

148
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,300
we would...

149
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,040
we would become someone

150
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,990
who can't distinguish right from wrong

151
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,280
if we besiege her, right?

152
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,010
-That's right.
-That's right.

153
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,120
I heard the Cloud Absorption Spell Master got is fake.

154
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,360
The real secret book

155
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,929
is in Feng Nanxi's hands.

156
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,789
The besiegement on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month

157
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,230
is just an excuse.

158
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,190
In fact, many people want to compete for the secret book.

159
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,430
We can't join them.

160
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:47,460
Instead,

161
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,540
we should use the Xiaoyao Sect's power as a righteous sect

162
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,760
to awaken more martial artists

163
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,310
who have been deceived.

164
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,510
Bad news!

165
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,920
I found Master's body at the foot

166
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,620
of the mountain where the Moon Shadow Sect is.

167
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,390
What?

168
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,670
Master's body?

169
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,570
-Body?
-This...
