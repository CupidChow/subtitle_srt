5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,330
Let's go home and be a farmer.

6
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,990
I'm so disappointed in this Martial Arts World.

7
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,970
It's you, Chief.

8
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,300
Please spare us, Chief!

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,010
We'll slap our own mouths!

10
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:45,990
We'll slap our own mouths!

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,130
Please spare us, Chief!

12
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,030
Are you crazy?

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,030
I'm Shen Yu,

14
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:49,840
not the chief.

15
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:50,920
Chief!

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,570
You are the chief. You are the chief.

17
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,480
Chief, please spare us!

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,390
Chief, please let us off.

19
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,510
Just let us retire and return to our hometown.

20
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,040
Juniors!

21
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,870
Let's run!

22
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,740
Junior! Junior!

23
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,090
Xiaolian! Xiaolian!

24
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,380
Xiaolian.

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,930
Nanxi.

26
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:23,600
Nanxi!

27
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:28,760
Nanxi!

28
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:31,940
Nanxi!

29
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,580
Nanxi!

30
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,940
Chiefs, thanks for your concern.

31
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,890
You came here in advance

32
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,030
in order to celebrate it for me.

33
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,039
Chief Shen,

34
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,870
we are all members of the Martial Arts World.

35
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,870
Just tell us honestly.

36
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,590
You insist on marrying the she-devil on August 15th, the same day

37
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,370
when we plan to besiege and eliminate

38
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,920
the Moon Shadow Sect and kill the she-devil.

39
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,780
Isn't it obvious that

40
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,310
you're against the whole Martial Arts World?

41
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,110
He really didn't know his place.

42
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,630
Don't think I don't know that

43
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,829
you just want to establish your prestige respectively

44
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:18,030
when the Xiaoyao Sect

45
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,750
is under the process of changing its chief.

46
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,079
If you don't want to die,

47
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,440
just stay here obediently.

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,870
Chief,

49
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,829
Miss Feng...

50
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,720
Say it.

51
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,660
Miss Feng refused to eat no matter what we said.

52
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,920
She wants to die?

53
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,230
It's not that easy.

54
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,710
Actually, I'm looking for the secret book

55
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,840
for the purpose that

56
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,600
the Martial Arts World won't be harmed by it anymore.

57
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,360
After the secret book is destroyed,

58
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,730
the whole Martial Arts World

59
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,930
will no longer stir up any bloody slaughter because of it.

60
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,120
By that time,

61
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,170
the Moon Shadow Sect and the Xiaoyao Sect

62
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,850
will no longer be enemies.

63
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,170
If you like this Xiangyang Residence,

64
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,310
then join me to

65
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,210
live in seclusion,

66
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,930
escape from the vulgar world,

67
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:22,960
grill fish together

68
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,670
and cook together.

69
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,680
Let's get married.

70
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,790
Aren't you afraid that I'll kill you again?

71
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,280
If you had really wanted to kill me,

72
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,520
you would have done it.

73
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,850
Would you have saved me?

74
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:58,660
Since

75
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,350
Ye Wuchen and Feng Nanxi

76
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,380
weren't together in the end,

77
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,230
why don't you let me stay with you forever

78
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,830
with the identity of Shen Yu?

79
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,670
I'll see which of you dares to hurt her!

80
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,390
Do you dare to say that you pretended to be Ye Wuchen

81
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,620
in the Xiangyang Residence not for the purpose of getting close to me?

82
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,880
My purpose was like that at first indeed.

83
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,150
But later,

84
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,120
I gradually took a fancy to

85
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,470
the reclusive life with you in the Xiangyang Residence.

86
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,490
I was worried that

87
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,060
what you liked was the identity of Ye Wuchen,

88
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:40,670
so I didn't dare to tell you all this time.

89
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,650
I was worried that you might be disappointed in me.

90
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,500
I'm quite disappointed indeed.

91
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,220
But I'm disappointed because...

92
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,150
I can't believe you think that I'm a person like that.

93
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,010
Now,

94
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,440
I'm hiding no secrets from you anymore.

95
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,750
I'm quite afraid that

96
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,490
I'll wake up from my dream.

97
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,300
But I'm also afraid that

98
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,870
I won't be able to wake up all the time.

99
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,330
The Xiaoyao Sect needs me.

100
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,350
I'll go with you.

101
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,950
Now their main target is you.

102
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,670
It's really too dangerous.

103
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,210
I'll go back to the Xiaoyao Sect first.

104
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,150
As long as I'm in the Xiaoyao Sect,

105
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,210
I don't think

106
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,470
they will dare to act rashly.

107
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,280
So it's all because Shen Yu

108
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,240
isn't the character created by me.

109
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,150
So I can only use my martial arts skills on him.

110
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,120
The purpose is to make me unable to escape

111
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,780
and then fall in love with him.

112
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,960
Feng Nanxi.

113
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,180
Your fate of being killed by Ye Wuchen

114
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,290
won't be changed in the end.

115
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,920
The bride is so thin.

116
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,480
That's not good.

117
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,560
Open your mouth.

118
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,320
If you want me to feed you with my mouth,

119
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,080
it's not impossible.

120
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,230
How shameless.

121
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,530
You just like Shen Yu's shamelessness, don't you?

122
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,900
You just want to take revenge on me, don't you?

123
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,860
Why don't you just kill me?

124
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,570
Because the wonderful story hasn't started yet.

125
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,540
Chief!

126
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,630
There is a man who looks exactly like you down the mountain.

127
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,230
He said he is the real Shen Yu.

128
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,300
The wonderful story

129
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,680
has started.

130
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,450
-Chief.
-Chief.

131
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,210
Juniors.

132
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,390
Why do you all call me Chief?

133
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,490
I saw him on the Wuling Land just now.

134
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,120
How did he come in through the side door?

135
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,880
Who are you?

136
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,060
Tell me your name.

137
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,410
I...

138
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,020
I'm Shen Yu.

139
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,910
-Shen Yu?
-Shen Yu?

140
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,670
There's only one Shen Yu.

141
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,730
Now he is our chief.

142
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,180
How dare this villain pretend to be our chief?

143
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:36,950
Catch him!

144
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,430
Yes!

145
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,310
Stop!

146
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,180
Chase him!

147
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:39,840
Stop!

148
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,120
Stop running!

149
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:43,840
Stop!

150
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,630
Stop!

151
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,430
Chase him!

152
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,210
Over there!

153
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:47,909
Yes!

154
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,550
Nanxi!

155
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:56,780
Nanxi.

156
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,020
Shen Yu.

157
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,440
You're finally here.

158
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,070
I'm sorry, Nanxi.

159
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,390
It's all my fault.

160
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,850
I shouldn't have left you.

161
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,590
I've heard that

162
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,920
there's someone who looks exactly like me.

163
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,320
Both Xiaolian and Wuhuan

164
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,310
are dead.

165
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,220
He killed them?

166
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:20,950
Yes.

167
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,820
Where is he?

168
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:30,870
Take a guess.

169
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:44,039
You didn't expect this, did you, Shen Yu?

170
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,930
You ungrateful man!
