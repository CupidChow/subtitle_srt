Episode 1

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's eat some shaved ice today, right, Misato?

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I found a good restaurant online.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I ate shaved ice with a friend yesterday.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What?

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Come on, you can go out with your dad.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Then, do you want to go to a tapioca bar?

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Sure, let's go.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Give it back by 7.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Okay.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Please forgive me.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Here, Aoyaki.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's Iga.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yes, yes, an accident.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I want to be in the pool.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Tairamachi Junior High School?

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What?

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What?

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Kei Shou Investigation Support Analysis Center.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's a department that supports all kinds of investigations

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
including the collection analysis of security cameras,

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
data analysis of smartphones and computers,

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and profiling of the suspect.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And this time,

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
a special panel was established

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
to support the investigation team

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
in charge of the criminal case of murder, robbery, and fire.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The name is SSBC Classroom Classroom.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Thank you for your hard work.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm Keiichi Machizawa, a junior high school teacher.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm 54 years old.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I discovered a swimming pool.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I jumped in and I was in the pool.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Poor thing.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
He's going to be a tiger forever.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What's this?

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Someone hit him.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Show me your body.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yes.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's 8.27 pm at the last night.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Did it fall from the sky?

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't know.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What?

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What do you mean?

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
If it falls here...

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
From that building?

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This is a marriage.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Call the security.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Someone was shot here.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm scared.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
There's no way there's a turtle.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Machizawa is from here.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Was he pushed down or fell when he ran away?

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
There seems to be no turtle that moved here.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Chief,

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I found a smartphone.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The marriage found on the roof of the building next to the junior high school was Machizawa Keiichi's.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Machizawa fell from the dance floor on the sixth floor and fell into the pool.

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The cause was history.

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What about the smartphone found on the spot?

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm analyzing it on the SSBC.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
A suspicious car was found in the fire pit near the junior high school.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's a car that's 50 meters east.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's a car that's moving away from the scene.

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The time is 8 33.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Machizawa fell six minutes later.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Another video was taken about two hours before the incident.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It was taken at 6 31.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The same car went about 200 meters west and reached the scene.

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So this car stayed around the scene for about two hours.

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What about the video with the number clearly displayed?

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm looking for it now.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's the same car, but I can't see the number.

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's Machizawa Keiichi's portrait, but it's a picture of the principal's teachers.

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
He was a very good teacher.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He was very passionate about student guidance.

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Right, Mr. Kyoto?

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yes.

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
At night, he went around the fire pit and found a junior high school student.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
When he found the teacher, he was strict and taught him hard.

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He returned home.

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
There is also a fire pit on the ground floor.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes.

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It seems that he was mainly circulating Shibuya and Shinjuku.

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
A passionate teacher.

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I didn't know there was such a teacher at my daughter's school.

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I didn't know.

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I told you at my high school.

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Mr. Katsumata of the Taikun.

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He was a very scary teacher.

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But if Mr. Katsumata wasn't there,

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I wouldn't have been able to graduate from high school and become a police officer.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You have such a teacher at Ichikachou?

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yes.

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So I don't think of Mr. Machizawa as a word.

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But maybe that passionate life guidance was a trap and got him into trouble.

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What a child.

99
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You don't have to think about that in the SSBC.

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I know.

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It seems that the number registered on Mr. Machida's smartphone has been restored.

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The registered number is 1422.

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
1422?

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That much?

105
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That much?

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Kabukicho.

107
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Center-Gai.

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's the student number Mr. Machizawa called.

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If you keep reading it for years, you'll become a good singer.

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You find a middle school student and teach him and you can avoid the phone number?

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's a little scary.

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I was in trouble.

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Why do I have to teach you the phone number?

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You're an old yankie.

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You said there was a reason for Mr. Machizawa?

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
No.

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Please be careful.

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What?

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Misato Aoyagi?

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What?

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Here.

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What?

125
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Ms. Iwaki's daughter?

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Aoyagi's daughter?

127
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Why?

128
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Shibuya Center-Gai.

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You were caught by Mr. Machizawa?

130
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Mr. Machizawa?

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
At the center-gai at night?

132
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Is that so?

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't know.

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The phone number is on it.

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Let's calm down.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Misato is playing with fire?

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What kind of upbringing are you doing?

138
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm raising her properly.

139
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's not limited to what the young lady did wrong.

140
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'll ask Misato directly.

141
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'll ask.

142
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You don't have that right.

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm asking about Mr. Machizawa.

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The operation of the first unit, the work of the first unit.

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm a father.

146
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm a father.

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Iwaki, don't get involved in the operation.

148
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'll ask anyway.

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yes.

150
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Is it not allowed to go to the first unit?

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
No, it's fine.

152
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Please help me.

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
This spring.

154
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
When is spring?

155
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You don't have to ask that hard.

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
When is it?

157
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
When Golden Week first started.

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Around what time?

159
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Did you play in the center at night?

160
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Around what time?

161
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Mr. Aoyuki?

162
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's not Trishy Lab.

163
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Why are you suddenly making a good face?

164
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Around what time?

165
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
10 o'clock.

166
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
10 o'clock?

167
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Mom was invited by Satcha on the day she got late for work.

168
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What were you doing?

169
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Karaoke.

170
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Can you stay in middle school until that time?

171
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Where is that karaoke?

172
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'll take care of it.

173
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Please calm down.

174
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Did Mr. Machizawa come to that karaoke?

175
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
When I was about to go home, I left the store.

176
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Let's go again.

177
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Let's go again.

178
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Wait.

179
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Which student are you?

180
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Teacher.

181
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Are you my student?

182
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What's your class name?

183
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm Aoyuki from the second year and third grade.

184
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm Suzuki from the same class.

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What are you doing here?

186
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Keep your school rules.

187
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Tell me your phone number.

190
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll call your parents when I find it.

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Just once?

192
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes.

193
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Really?

194
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Just once.

195
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's not a big deal.

196
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's not a big deal.

197
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You can't say that because you don't have anything to do with it.

198
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's impossible for a junior high school girl to play on the roof.

199
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You can't.

200
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I know.

201
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Mr. Machizawa was worried about you.

202
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's right.

203
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
There's no teacher who's so passionate.

204
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Maybe.

205
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But?

206
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
There's no student who likes that teacher.

207
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Everyone hated him.

208
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Maybe.

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
When I was in middle school, all the teachers in the student council were suspicious of me.

210
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But...

211
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That teacher is dangerous.

212
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Dangerous?

213
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
This is our keycard.

214
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Keycard?

215
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Look.

216
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Mr. Machizawa.

217
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What?

218
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Ah!

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Someone found it on the internet and pasted it on.

220
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What video is that?

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I don't know.

222
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What's this?

223
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It looks like they're apologizing.

224
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
To whom? Why?

225
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't know.

226
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But in the girl's story, Mr. Machizawa said he was involved with dangerous people.

227
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Dangerous people?

228
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Mr. Machizawa?

229
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Mr. Ishikawa.

230
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I met someone who was registered on Mr. Machizawa's smartphone.

231
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Among them, there was a boy who graduated from Tairamachi Middle School four years ago.

232
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Machizawa?

233
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
While you were teaching him while you were finding the guy who was doing the medicine,

234
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
he was lying on the bed with the medicine he had rolled up from his back.

235
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Lying on the bed?

236
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That's what they say.

237
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Don't say that.

238
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Everyone says that.

239
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
They say they're definitely doing the medicine.

240
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Medicine?

241
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
But it's Mr. Machizawa.

242
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He's not a teacher.

243
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What?

244
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
He said so.

245
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
He said so!

246
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It seems that Mr. Machizawa is different from what we had imagined until now.

247
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Mr. Katsumata wasn't that kind of teacher.

248
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The one-box car that was on the scene was stolen by Ebisu in Shibuya the night before the incident.

249
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
A hit car?

250
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's a video of a fire that was brought in from the fire station.

251
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
These two kidnapped and raped Mr. Machizawa.

252
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's highly possible.

253
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
A junior high school teacher would be involved in something like this.

254
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Mr. Machizawa was a very important person.

255
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
To be caught in a situation like this...

256
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
There's also a rumor that Mr. Machizawa was a drug dealer.

257
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Drug dealer?

258
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's about Mr. Machizawa himself using drugs.

259
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What?

260
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
No way!

261
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
He used drugs?

262
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Wasn't he a great teacher, Chief Ichikawa?

263
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
How?

264
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Please check the record of Mr. Machizawa's code for the video of the fire in Shibuya and Shinjuku.

265
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm home.

266
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Welcome home.

267
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm tired.

268
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You're always looking at your phone.

269
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Hey, Mom. Look at this.

270
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What's this?

271
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Maraeru. The genius who made that.

272
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Your school teacher is gone.

273
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You're doing such a stupid thing.

274
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I've been saying it all the time.

275
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Machizawa was a bad guy.

276
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
He was killed by some crazy guys.

277
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Misato, listen...

278
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Everyone knows that my parents are the police.

279
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
They always ask me what's really going on.

280
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What did you do, Mr. Machizawa?

281
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I won't tell my family about this.

282
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You won't tell them, right?

283
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I know.

284
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Let's take a bath.

285
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Hey, wait, Misato.

286
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Misato!

287
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Misato, wait.

288
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Mr. Igaaki.

289
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Susumura.

290
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Grenmain.

291
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Do you want to report this to the police?

292
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
We don't have enough material.

293
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
There might be a bug in this store.

294
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I see.

295
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I don't understand.

296
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm sure he entered this store on August 8th.

297
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's around 23 o'clock.

298
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I don't remember all the faces of the customers.

299
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I heard you were hit by a car again.

300
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Could you show me the security camera footage?

301
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's from August 8th.

302
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's Dami.

303
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Dami?

304
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
There are some bad customers.

305
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
There are some today.

306
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Are you a police officer?

307
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
No.

308
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Wait.

309
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm sorry for the trouble.

310
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm a police officer.

311
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'd like to ask you something.

312
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Do you know this person?

313
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
No.

314
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I've never seen him.

315
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't know him.

316
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I see.

317
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
By the way, what kind of group are you?

318
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
A working group?

319
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
We're just friends.

320
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
What is it?

321
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I understand. Thank you.

322
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Let's go.

323
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Let's go.

324
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Hey, you!

325
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Hey, you!

326
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's over for today.

327
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'll show you the security camera footage.

328
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Please.

329
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So that's...

330
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You can't lie.

331
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
They're the guys from before.

332
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What's the name of this guy?

333
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't know.

334
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
We're here to investigate a major crime.

335
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
If we show them the evidence, it'll be a problem.

336
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm sorry.

337
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
He's a scoundrel.

338
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
A scoundrel?

339
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
What kind of group are they?

340
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
They smell suspicious.

341
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
They're hangers.

342
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I knew it.

343
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You're Mr. Machizawa.

344
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Do you know this group?

345
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
No.

346
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
What are you talking about?

347
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I didn't hear anything.

348
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It's true.

349
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm sorry.

350
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm sorry.

351
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm sorry.

352
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm sorry.

353
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm sorry.

354
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm sorry.

355
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm sorry.

356
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm sorry.

357
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm sorry.

358
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm sorry.

359
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm sorry.

360
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm sorry.

361
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm sorry.

362
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm sorry.

363
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm sorry.

364
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
So this is the video.

365
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What did Mr. Machizawa say about the hangers?

366
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Is it related to the incident?

367
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's strange that it's not.

368
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Don't tell me that.

369
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
You're investigating again.

370
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm sorry.

371
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
My instructions won't work.

372
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's true, Mr. Kuzihara.

373
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I always say this.

374
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The investigation department is the one who controls the investigation.

375
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The SSBC must obey the order of the investigation department.

376
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Even this video is evidence of the incident.

377
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It is.

378
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
If we pull the thief and investigate...

379
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Right.

380
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
We should let him swim until we can't see the connection with the incident.

381
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I see.

382
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Right.

383
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Why are you sighing?

384
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Nothing.

385
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Mr. Ichikawa, there was another decisive evidence.

386
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Decisive?

387
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
The video of two men who stole the one-box car.

388
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And the video of the play that Mr. Nanami took.

389
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The video of the two men who stole the car and the video of the play that Mr. Ichikawa took.

390
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
What?

391
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What?

392
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Look.

393
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The first one.

394
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And...

395
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Yes.

396
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
So the possibility that the two men in the SSBC

397
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
broke into Mr. Machizawa is extremely high.

398
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
The leader is Kaibori.

399
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I asked the team.

400
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
There was a person named Kaibori Shinya at the top of the SSBC Shibuya Lost Claw.

401
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's definitely the same person.

402
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Kaibori Shinya.

403
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Shibuya Lost Claw.

404
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm sorry.

405
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
We've been looking for you.

406
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
What?

407
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Please don't do this.

408
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm sorry.

409
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
We can do it.

410
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I haven't been there since then.

411
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's true.

412
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I don't know any other stores that the people from Shibuya Lost Claw go to.

413
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Don't tell Kaibori that I showed you the video of the security camera.

414
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'll be killed for real.

415
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So that's the guy?

416
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
That's the guy.

417
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Where's the cap?

418
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Kaibori is more handsome.

419
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Handsome?

420
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
What kind of standard is that?

421
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm more...

422
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What do you mean by that?

423
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You're more handsome than me.

424
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
My daughter said that.

425
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Ten years ago.

426
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You're still ignoring me?

427
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Shut up and look for it.

428
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Machizawa's video is on social media.

429
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Who are you apologizing to?

430
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
No comment today.

431
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
There's a rumor that Machizawa had something to do with the reflection. Is that true?

432
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Hey.

433
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Was Machizawa a problem teacher?

434
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Don't be so sure.

435
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
We want to know the truth.

436
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's our mission to report that.

437
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
What? It's not a mission.

438
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
That's a problem.

439
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You're not as cute as before.

440
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
That's a sexual harassment.

441
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Shut up.

442
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's a sexual harassment.

443
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Don't be so sure.

444
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
What's wrong with Japan?

445
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It's the time now.

446
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
What?

447
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So fluffy.

448
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's so fluffy.

449
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's good.

450
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I see.

451
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's really good.

452
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I found a good restaurant.

453
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Right?

454
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I wanted to bring you here.

455
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
But you invited me here.

456
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You should keep quiet.

457
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Why?

458
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Hey, dad.

459
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
What was that video?

460
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
What?

461
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Machizawa teacher.

462
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You don't need to know that.

463
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Everyone is interested in it.

464
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
The keyhole writing.

465
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It was a big deal.

466
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
That teacher hated me so much.

467
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Do you write about Misato?

468
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Sometimes.

469
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Machizawa teacher's bad words.

470
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I hated him too.

471
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'm disappointed.

472
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
What?

473
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm disappointed.

474
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
What?

475
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I don't know what you hate.

476
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
But people are gone.

477
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
You're saying that because you're interested in it.

478
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It's the worst.

479
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Don't be so serious.

480
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm embarrassed.

481
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm going home.

482
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'll pay the bill.

483
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'll pay the bill.

484
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Misato is not mean.

485
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I don't know what she's thinking.

486
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
No.

487
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
You saw the old movie.

488
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It's about the train.

489
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
That's what kids do.

490
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
No.

491
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
That's not what I'm talking about.

492
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Misato may not see you anymore.

493
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Even if you don't, you'll hate me.

494
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I'm hated.

495
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It's your job to say that.

496
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I don't want to be hated.

497
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Iga-san.

498
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Nanami.

499
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Iga-san.

500
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Leave me alone.

501
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I'm not going to write about this on SNS.

502
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Let's go to work.

503
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
This is it.

504
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Yano-senpai?

505
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I know his name.

506
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Yano...

507
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Shoma?

508
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Shoma Yano

509
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It's Shoma Yano.

510
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Shibuya Lost Claw.

511
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Did you find it?

512
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Yes.

513
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
He graduated from Tairamachi Junior High School last year and became a member of Shibuya Lost Claw.

514
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I know why Mr. Machida died.

515
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I'll leave the rest to the family.

516
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Why?

517
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Why are you using the SSBC again?

518
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I'm sorry I got you.

519
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Enough.

520
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Shut up!

521
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I'm sorry.

522
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
He graduated from junior high school and worked part-time at a martial arts gym.

523
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
But things got worse.

524
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
At that time, he met a member of Shibuya Lost Claw and was introduced to Mr. Kaibori.

525
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Was he told to join Shibuya Lost Claw?

526
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
He said it was all fun.

527
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Didn't you know he was a member of the Hungry Group?

528
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I knew it after I joined.

529
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I thought it was a fight, but I was scared of Mr. Kaibori.

530
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You thought you couldn't get away?

531
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
But Mr. Machida...

532
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Yano, is it true that you joined a group called Lost Claw?

533
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Shut up.

534
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Who are they?

535
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I know.

536
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Stop right now.

537
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It has nothing to do with you.

538
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm doing this for your future.

539
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I was a Shikato.

540
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I graduated from junior high school, but why did I have to be told?

541
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
But...

542
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Welcome.

543
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Yano!

544
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Yano!

545
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Let's go home.

546
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Let's go home!

547
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Hey, wait!

548
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Who are you?

549
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'm a teacher at Tairamachi Junior High School.

550
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I'm Machizawa.

551
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
A teacher?

552
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I'm Yano Shoma's former partner.

553
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
What does your teacher do?

554
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Yano is only 16 years old.

555
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
You can't enter this school.

556
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
What?

557
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
You're not old enough to be friends.

558
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Give Yano back to us.

559
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
What do you mean?

560
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm telling you to get him out of your group.

561
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
What are you talking about?

562
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Don't be ridiculous.

563
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Please!

564
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Don't involve Yano anymore.

565
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
You're a teacher?

566
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Get out of here!

567
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Please!

568
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Let Yano go!

569
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I'm telling you to go home.

570
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Please!

571
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Give Yano back to us!

572
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Yano, let's go home!

573
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Hey.

574
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Please!

575
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Hey, get up!

576
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Yano!

577
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Let's go home!

578
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Yano!

579
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Wake up, Yano!

580
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Yano!

581
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I was scared.

582
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I was scared.

583
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I couldn't go to that store anymore.

584
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I'm sorry.

585
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Did you quit the club?

586
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Mr. Matsuda came again.

587
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I don't want to see you ruin your life!

588
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Please!

589
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Stop hanging out with those guys!

590
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Please!

591
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I understand.

592
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
What?

593
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I understand.

594
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I'm going to quit.

595
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I see.

596
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Yano.

597
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Thank you.

598
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
But...

599
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I'm sorry.

600
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Hello?

601
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Do you know what will happen if you make me angry?

602
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I'll forgive you if you come back right now.

603
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Did Kaibori say he killed Mr. Matsuda?

604
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Mr. Ishida and...

605
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Mr. Izumi...

606
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Three of them...

607
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
What?

608
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Three of them?

609
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
So Kaibori is one of the executors?

610
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
That's what's going to happen.

611
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And he said he killed Mr. Matsuda.

612
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Yano Shoma's smartphone has the links of the members of Shibuya Lost Crow.

613
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
He's making a group on social media.

614
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Can you find where the members of the Lost Crow are?

615
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
If we're still in the middle of a conversation,

616
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
we might be able to find the source of the information.

617
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Can you do that?

618
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
First, we'll request Kaibori's IP address on the social media platform.

619
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
If you know that Kaibori uses free Wi-Fi,

620
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
we'll use the database developed by SSBC to identify the provider of Wi-Fi.

621
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And we'll find out where Kaibori is from the location of Wi-Fi.

622
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Are you ready?

623
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I got it.

624
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I've secured the body of Kaibori and all of them.

625
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Good!

626
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
This is where the battle begins.

627
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Mr. Matsuda's phone is ringing.

628
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
The car is in the car.

629
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
The car is in the car.

630
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Mr. Matsuda, please come out.

631
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm sorry.

632
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I'm sorry.

633
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I'm sorry.

634
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I'm sorry.

635
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I'm sorry.

636
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I'm sorry.

637
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I'm sorry.

638
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I'm sorry.

639
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
You didn't kill them, did you?

640
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I didn't kill them, either.

641
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Mr. Matsuda tried to escape, but he fell down on his own.

642
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
What about Kaibori's body?

643
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I don't recognize it.

644
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
You said you did it with just the two of us.

645
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
You're going to protect the leader, aren't you?

646
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Kaibori must be very scared.

647
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Oegi, can you drop it?

648
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Of course.

649
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Was the connection cut off?

650
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Yes.

651
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
His phone doesn't have the daily information data of August 15.

652
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
That's what Kaibori did from the beginning.

653
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It's hard to drop it.

654
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Of course, we'll find the evidence.

655
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Please.

656
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
It's rare.

657
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
You're going to do that.

658
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I ordered it.

659
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I want to find the evidence.

660
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I killed that teacher.

661
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Do you have a testimony?

662
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Who told you?

663
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Could it be that kid?

664
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Kid?

665
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Don't believe what those kids say.

666
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Who?

667
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You're very cautious, Mr. Aoyagi.

668
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
If you admit that it's a testimony of the leader, his body is in danger.

669
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
How are you going to drop it, Aoyagi?

670
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
It's a definitive digital evidence.

671
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
But Kaibori's phone doesn't have the daily information data.

672
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
There's no SNS connection for the incident.

673
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
There's no evidence.

674
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
There's no security camera that shows the scene of the shooting.

675
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
It's hard to find.

676
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Those guys are shooting the scene of the shooting.

677
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
There's no such thing.

678
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Damn it.

679
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Izumi and Ishida made a confession.

680
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
They said they did it.

681
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
What do you mean they did it?

682
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
They just hurt them a little.

683
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
They did it on their own.

684
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Then why did Mr. Machida fall from there?

685
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I don't know.

686
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I'm sure he killed himself because he was so pathetic.

687
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
That bastard.

688
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
This light...light?

689
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
It's a fire alarm just before Mr. Machida fell.

690
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
This light is fireworks, right?

691
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Fireworks?

692
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
It's fireworks.

693
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
By the way, that day was the fireworks competition.

694
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Hazuki River.

695
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
That's right.

696
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
So?

697
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
If you look at the sky, you can see the fireworks.

698
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
There are people taking pictures and videos.

699
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
There are a lot.

700
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
There may be people capturing that building.

701
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
That's right.

702
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
There must be people who are posting that image on social media.

703
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
If you look at it from one side...

704
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
You may see a decisive evidence.

705
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Let's look for it.

706
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
SSBC OSINT system is used.

707
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
OSINT?

708
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
It's the OSINT.

709
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It's a unique search system that collects and analyzes the information that is published on the web and guides useful information.

710
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Videos and photos posted on social media are also collected as big data and can be searched instantly.

711
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
The deleted post is also stored.

712
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Amazing.

713
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Let's get started.

714
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Yes.

715
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Please forgive me, Mr. Kei.

716
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Even if you are surrounded by evidence and only your family is left,

717
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
you are saying that love is a human rights violation.

718
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Such a scary face.

719
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Such a beautiful woman is a disaster.

720
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
This is a different direction.

721
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
It's not reflected.

722
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
No, it's too far.

723
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
The school in Tairamatsu is reflected, but the building next to it is not reflected.

724
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
That building...

725
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
It's different.

726
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
It's not reflected.

727
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Oh!

728
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Mr. Iwaki!

729
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Mr. Iwaki!

730
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
It's a waste of time to continue like this.

731
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Can you return it?

732
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Wait a little longer.

733
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
What are you waiting for?

734
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Stop it.

735
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Did you find it?

736
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I found it.

737
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
It's going to be on August 15th at 8.27.

738
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
That day was the fireworks show.

739
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
The building next to Tairamatsu Elementary School is reflected here.

740
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Take a good look.

741
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
This is the moment when Mr. Matsuzawa fell.

742
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
This is enlarged to adjust the brightness and become vivid.

743
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Kaibori.

744
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
That's right.

745
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
This is you.

746
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Alright.

747
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Why is this video...

748
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I see.

749
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
You made it.

750
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I made it?

751
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
It's a fake video.

752
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
The police do dirty things.

753
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
That's why you came.

754
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
It's a bad thing to say.

755
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I'll sue you for evidence.

756
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Try it.

757
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
How will the judge judge?

758
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
But you know best.

759
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
This is the real thing.

760
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
You murdered Mr. Matsuzawa.

761
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Why did you do that?

762
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
What did Mr. Matsuzawa do?

763
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
What's wrong?

764
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Can't you answer me?

765
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Get out of here!

766
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
You left my family and left the group.

767
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Even a useless kid has a member.

768
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I will never forgive anyone who destroys my dignity.

769
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Dignity?

770
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
What is dignity?

771
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
You're a shameless person.

772
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Stop it.

773
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
You're doing the same thing again.

774
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It's no good, Mr. Higaki.

775
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Mr. Higaki.

776
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Shinya Kaibori.

777
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
You're under arrest for murder.

778
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Mr. Matsuzawa Keiichi.

779
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
He convinced his own teacher in Shibuya Lost Crow.

780
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
He got him out of the group.

781
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
That's why he's being blamed for the murder.

782
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
He's a real bastard.

783
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:42,000
But Mr. Matsuzawa was a great teacher like Mr. Katsumata.

784
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I think that's the best I could do.

785
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
That's all for today.

786
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Mr. Ichikawa.

787
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
What's Mr. Katsumata?

788
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I didn't tell you about Mr. Katsumata.

789
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
He's my teacher in high school.

790
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
What's the connection between the case and the case?

791
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
It's not directly related to the case.

792
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
But Mr. Matsuzawa and Mr. Katsumata are similar.

793
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I don't know about that.

794
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
So there's no direct connection between the case and the case?

795
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
It's not directly related.

796
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Mr. Matsuzawa's students are the ones who committed the murder.

797
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Mr. Matsuzawa didn't do anything wrong.

798
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Students love their teachers.

799
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
We used to be like that.

800
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:51,000
But Mr. Matsuzawa was the only one who stood up to get out of the anti-socialist system.

801
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,000
You don't need a teacher like that, Misato.

802
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Mr. Matsuzawa is a good teacher.

803
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
You're right.

804
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I'm sorry.

805
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I'm sorry.

806
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Excuse me.

807
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Rintaro, how old are you?

808
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I'm 38 this year.

809
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
38?

810
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I was the head of the police department.

811
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Head of the police department?

812
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
That's amazing.

813
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I think you went back to the police department and became the first head of the police department.

814
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I'm sorry.

815
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
You don't have to apologize.

816
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
That incident made me who I am now.

817
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,880
The

818
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
whole incident was the same as the Homeless murder 22 years ago.

819
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I was surprised too.

820
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Me too.

821
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Is Chief Kusei related to that incident?

822
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
What do I need?

823
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I can't get in touch with my mother.
