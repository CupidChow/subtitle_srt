1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
How is it, Rintaro? Are you used to the new job?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It's very fulfilling, old man.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Is that so?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's probably your first time to be a police officer from a witness.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm not dissatisfied with my previous job.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I just wonder if I'm doing a good job.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You are.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I guess you're trying to make money.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You don't look like you're doing well.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I was surprised when I first heard you were in charge of the police.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Did your mother tell you?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
When a woman is drunk and someone is dropped at the scene,

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Rintaro can't be left alone.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm the one who gets beaten up.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I want you to make the most of your time.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This place is not very good.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'll get it.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I didn't think about SSBC.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
As you recommended, it's a good company.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For a public prosecutor, you need someone like you.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Don't be fooled by the concept of the regulations.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Do it.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'll do it to solve that case.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You have to deal with that criminal.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The tuna is ready.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Ichikacho?

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Look at this.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's a good color.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What is this?

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This is a delicious tuna.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Please eat it.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's really delicious.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's true. Ichikacho was really cooking tuna.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
No way.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's not a lie.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You don't admit it yet?

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Let's do it.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I understand.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You're a big liar.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll tell you the scary story of Ikka.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Nanami.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Good morning.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Ichikacho was on the news last night.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
News?

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Ichikacho was cooking tuna.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Tuna?

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Did you see the tuna?

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He's the older brother of Futago.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Futago?

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Sushi chef?

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He's running a sushi restaurant in Aomori.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
He's selling two of them to Ichikacho.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I've never heard of him.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I didn't know there were two of them.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I want to see it.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't want to see it.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I want to see it.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Really?

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Is he the same person?

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
No, he's more like a human.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He's the opposite of Ichikacho.

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
A message from the police.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
A man was found dead in the Nishitamagawa river.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The location is Komaeshi Izumidai.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll be there.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay.

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Nanami.

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Be careful.

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yes.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Police Department, Interrogation Support Analysis Center.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
SSBC.

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Collecting and analyzing the footage of the crime.

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Data analysis of the smartphone and computer.

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The department supports all kinds of investigations.

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And this time, the investigation team is in charge of the murder, robbery, and fire.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
A special panel is established to support the investigation team.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The name is SSBC.

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The investigation team is in charge of the murder, robbery, and fire.

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Here.

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's the body's body.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's been several days since the last time.

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Thank you, Mr. Igaki.

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Thank you.

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Is that the body?

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yes, it's in that coffin.

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
This is beautiful.

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's so hot.

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm getting a lot of

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
left chest and left side ribs.

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
SSBC, go to the location for the video of the fire.

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Go?

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll be a telegram from Mr. Aoyama.

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
When should I look for the footage?

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The surveillance was said to be on for 10 days after the death.

99
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So the murder was on August 4th.

100
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's a small room.

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Right.

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I know where the body is.

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Ichiro Kurata, born in 1949,

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
has a record in the database.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Is it a premonition?

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
He was arrested for three times for two to five years.

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The suspect of the Yuugen Association.

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It seems that he is still in the group.

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Who did you have a fight with?

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Kurata had a snack.

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
About two months ago.

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Mama, put the bottle in.

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Oh, it's not a cake.

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I found a money thief.

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Money thief?

116
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Bonbon's pianist.

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What?

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Bonbon's pianist?

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He said he didn't tell me any more.

120
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Ichiro Kurata was on the scene on August 5th, at 1957.

121
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The body was found about 200 meters away from the scene.

122
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The culprit is also on the scene on this day.

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The person in the picture is this 36 people.

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
36 people.

125
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'll search for pianists in this.

126
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I can't understand that right away.

127
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Kid!

128
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This person is a pianist.

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That's right.

130
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Tamada Hibiki.

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Tamada Music University.

132
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Amazing.

133
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
University student.

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He won the national youth competition in the age of 9.

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
He won the Eastern International Competition in the age of 16.

136
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He won the Walsh International Competition in the age of 19.

137
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's a pretty good history.

138
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
In the future, a talented pianist.

139
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Is he related to the suspect?

140
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
11 minutes before Kurata was on the scene.

141
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's the same picture.

142
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What kind of request do you have?

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Actually, there was an incident.

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I want to confirm it with Hibiki.

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
My son is not a criminal.

146
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Please cooperate.

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Is Hibiki at home?

148
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
This is amazing.

150
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
She is very cautious.

151
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
That's right.

152
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Where were you on the fifth day of this month?

153
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I was at the university all the time.

154
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I was at the university all the time.

155
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That day was the school's opening ceremony.

156
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
School opening ceremony?

157
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I want to hear from Hibiki.

158
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's a ceremony to decide the school's specialization.

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It was on August 5th.

160
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What time is it?

161
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's time for the opening ceremony.

162
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It started at 1 p.m.

163
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I was the last performer.

164
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I got on stage at 9 p.m.

165
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I think it was 10 p.m.

166
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
9 p.m.

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What time did you practice?

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I was practicing for the show.

169
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What is this?

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yesterday, a man was found at the riverbed of Nishitamagawa.

171
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He is Ichiro Kurata, 51 years old.

172
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Do you remember his name?

173
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
No.

174
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What is your relationship with Hibiki?

175
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Has anyone asked you for a loan recently?

176
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Loan?

177
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
No.

178
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What is this?

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
This is a video of the scene of the accident on August 5th.

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You didn't do this?

181
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That's not true.

182
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm asking Hibiki.

183
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's why I went to the university all the time.

184
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It was the opening ceremony.

185
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I told you.

186
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I got on stage at 9 p.m.

187
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
This video is 7 p.m.

188
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's more than an hour ago.

189
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It doesn't take an hour from the site of the accident to the ball.

190
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Don't tell me you doubt Hibiki.

191
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Don't say anything stupid.

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Mom.

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Hibiki was in the practice room right before the show.

194
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Can you show me your phone?

195
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
What?

196
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
This is a video of the school selection meeting on August 5th.

197
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You're good.

198
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Of course.

199
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I've been taking the exam since I was a kid.

200
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What time did you get on stage?

201
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
4 p.m.

202
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But the location of your phone doesn't look like it's moving from the university.

203
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Isn't it white?

204
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
No.

205
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It may have moved while leaving the phone.

206
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What is your impression of Hibiki?

207
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
He was suspicious when he saw the video of the accident.

208
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
His mother's attitude is strange.

209
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I feel like he's hiding something.

210
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What?

211
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What's wrong?

212
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Actually, the reason we stopped playing here was the cause of the problem.

213
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Hamada Hibiki ended up in the reunion.

214
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Reunion?

215
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So we can't go to the club?

216
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
He thought that Karem would win and decide to study abroad.

217
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Did he forget the song?

218
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Did he get nervous?

219
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Maybe he couldn't concentrate because he killed Ichiro Kurata.

220
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's possible.

221
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
He said that Kanesuru, the pianist, was there.

222
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And his face was reflected on the screen.

223
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Hamada Hibiki is the best candidate.

224
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Please take your time to find out.

225
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Chief Ishikawa!

226
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I checked the remains and found Ichiro Kurata's son.

227
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What?

228
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Kurata's son?

229
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
In 19th century, Kurata's wife was sick.

230
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And after that, the children were taken to a child care center.

231
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The reason was that the father had a child with a child.

232
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
A child?

233
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The police came in on the call from the Autonomous Consultation Office.

234
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And they were forced to leave the father.

235
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The children were Junichi Kurata and Junji Kurata.

236
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
After that, the two were taken to a different family's child care center.

237
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The first one to be taken was Ichitaro Inagi, who runs a clinic in Shizuoka.

238
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The second one was Takahiro Hamada, the president of a real estate company in Tokyo.

239
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Hamada?

240
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And Junji was taken to Hamada's child care center.

241
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And Hibiki was there.

242
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I see.

243
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Good.

244
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Ichiro Kurata is connected to this guy.

245
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The police came in.

246
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
If the twins are Ichitaro, there might be another person with the same face as Hibiki Hamada.

247
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It could be that the twin's older brother was in the picture.

248
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
They split up when they were five years old.

249
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's been 16 years.

250
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
They've been through a completely different life.

251
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm sorry, Chief Ichikawa.

252
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'll be there as soon as I eat.

253
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What?

254
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What?

255
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Masahiko!

256
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Masahiko!

257
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What's up with you?

258
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I've never been to a police station before.

259
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Could it be Ichikawa's twin brother?

260
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Yes.

261
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Masahiko, my brother.

262
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Masao is always in that guy's hands.

263
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
No, I'm the one who's taking care of him.

264
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
He's my subordinate.

265
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I've been taught a lot by Chief Ichikawa every day.

266
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm not his subordinate.

267
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And this is Nanami.

268
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
This old man is the former chief of police and the current chief of the cabinet,

269
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Mr. Shunsuke Kusei.

270
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Chief Ichikawa.

271
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Nanami has passed the national public official general examination.

272
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
He's been promoted to the chief of police.

273
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
He's got a career.

274
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That's good.

275
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
In three years, he'll be promoted to the chief of police.

276
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That means he'll be my superior.

277
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
He's a different person from us.

278
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
How?

279
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What are you talking about?

280
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm still a junior.

281
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm really grateful to Chief Ichikawa.

282
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Are you Masao?

283
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
That's...

284
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm a big fan of you.

285
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I see.

286
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Did you finish the tuna-mackerel?

287
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm inbound.

288
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I was just taking a bath.

289
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'll go get some sakura.

290
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Okay.

291
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Egi.

292
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yes.

293
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What are you doing?

294
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm going to the police station.

295
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Egi.

296
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yes.

297
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Call the police when you get the two-year-old.

298
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yes, sir.

299
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What do you mean by two-year-old?

300
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's a case involving two-year-olds.

301
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I know how they feel the best.

302
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Let's go.

303
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Hello.

304
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You've gotten really big.

305
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You're right.

306
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You look the same.

307
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You're not the chief of police, are you?

308
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You're right.

309
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Inagi Junichi

310
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Inagi Junichi

311
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's Inagi Junichi.

312
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What is it?

313
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I have a question for you.

314
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The police?

315
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Can you please come along?

316
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Huh?

317
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Why?

318
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You look the same.

319
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You've been out of your mind.

320
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Huh?

321
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
What were you doing on Tuesday, August 5th?

322
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I was working part-time on Tuesday.

323
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I was at a convenience store in Kamata.

324
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What time did you work?

325
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
From 10 to 6.

326
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So you can go to the scene after 7.

327
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Huh?

328
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What were you doing after work?

329
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I was playing with my friends in Shibuya.

330
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The cleaning shop where Inagi Junichi went to the police

331
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
was closed down by Junichi

332
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
after he was beaten up by a police officer.

333
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
He started playing at 11.

334
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
He was arrested?

335
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
No, but he was a member of the Hangure group.

336
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's so ironic.

337
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
One of them was born in Futago.

338
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
The other was taken in by a wealthy family.

339
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
He was educated in piano.

340
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
The other was a Hangure.

341
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's sad.

342
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What's going on?

343
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What's going on?

344
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Inagi.

345
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yes.

346
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
A video of a crime scene.

347
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Was that you?

348
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It wasn't me.

349
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It was Ichiro Kurata.

350
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Your father.

351
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I don't remember.

352
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
We were abandoned by the gang.

353
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You and Junichi?

354
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You remember your brother.

355
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I don't.

356
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
We've been separated for a long time.

357
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Is it that easy to break up a relationship with a man?

358
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
A man has a bond with another man.

359
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
If Aomori's brother cuts him with a knife,

360
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
he'll hurt his brother in Tokyo.

361
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What?

362
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Even if he does rock-paper-scissors, he can't win.

363
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Really?

364
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What are you talking about?

365
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Listen.

366
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
If it's not you,

367
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
it means Junji is his brother.

368
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I don't know anything.

369
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I heard the situation from my wife.

370
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's a murder case.

371
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Hibiki is not involved.

372
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I can confirm that.

373
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
The dead Ichiro Kurata was Hibiki's real father.

374
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What?

375
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Father?

376
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Didn't you know by hearing his name?

377
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I didn't know.

378
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
When Hibiki was five years old,

379
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
we took him to the hospital.

380
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
He didn't tell us about his real father.

381
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
We never talked about him in the family.

382
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's strange that he forgot about him.

383
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Do you remember Junichi?

384
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
He's Hibiki's twin brother.

385
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What?

386
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I don't remember.

387
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Don't lie.

388
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
On July 15, 20 days before the murder,

389
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
there was a concert to celebrate the opening of the Tamaondai.

390
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It was released for free to the public.

391
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Music halls were closed every year.

392
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
This year, you were also performed.

393
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I got the footage of the security camera.

394
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's 10.25 p.m. after the concert.

395
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
The venue is the back door of the music hall.

396
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You remember, right?

397
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Who is this?

398
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Your twin brother.

399
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Junichi Inagi.

400
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You met him 20 days ago, right?

401
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Hibiki.

402
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
What do you mean?

403
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
After the concert,

404
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I went home and left the hall.

405
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I knew right away

406
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
that he was my brother when he was five years old.

407
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Junichi.

408
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's unfair.

409
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm in the worst life.

410
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You're a rich pianist.

411
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Is this a parent's gacha?

412
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Don't mess with me.

413
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Wait.

414
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Where are you now?

415
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Where do you live?

416
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I met you.

417
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Tell me your contact information.

418
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Junichi.

419
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Call me.

420
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Call me.

421
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'll call you.

422
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Is that all you said?

423
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
That's all.

424
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Why did you keep quiet?

425
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I thought I shouldn't say it.

426
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Hibiki.

427
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm sorry.

428
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Hibiki.

429
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Why?

430
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I said it.

431
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Nothing happened.

432
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Really nothing happened?

433
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Junichi Inagi.

434
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Did you get a call?

435
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
No.

436
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Can I have your phone?

437
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I want to make sure you're not lying.

438
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
No.

439
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
What?

440
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
This is a secret.

441
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'll leave it to you.

442
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You didn't give me your phone.

443
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You must have something to tell me.

444
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Is Hamada Hibiki involved in the case?

445
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Of course.

446
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Why are you here?

447
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Inagi.

448
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Hamada Hibiki is uploading videos of her performance on social media.

449
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
A piano at home?

450
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
That's amazing.

451
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You look like a celebrity.

452
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm a celebrity.

453
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Most comments are positive.

454
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
But there's one person who writes negative comments every time.

455
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
The real identity.

456
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
The parents?

457
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Die.

458
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Anger Hammer.

459
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
What's going on?

460
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You're seeing your brother, aren't you?

461
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
The one who posted a terrible post on Hamada Hibiki's social media.

462
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Anger Hammer.

463
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
This is you.

464
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
The post was posted six months ago.

465
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
You've been aware of your brother since then.

466
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
You said you were done with your training.

467
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Why did you lie?

468
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Answer me.

469
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I'm pissed off.

470
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
He's the only one who's had a good life.

471
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
You were connected to Hamada Hibiki.

472
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
It doesn't seem to have anything to do with the murder of Ichiro Kurata.

473
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I didn't kill him.

474
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I'm sorry.

475
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Did you call him?

476
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I can't do that.

477
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Yes.

478
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Give me your phone.

479
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The location information was cut off.

480
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Digital Forensics will restore the data deleted from Junichi Inagi's phone.

481
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
The history of the phone was deleted.

482
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
He called on August 5th.

483
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
This number...

484
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Hamada Hibiki.

485
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I knew it.

486
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It's 2120.

487
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
It's the time when Ichiro Kurata was murdered.

488
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
But Hamada Hibiki is playing at this time.

489
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
He was on stage at 214.

490
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You two didn't talk?

491
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Maybe the Lusden was on the run.

492
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Get the gassaji and tell him to stop.

493
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Yes, sir.

494
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Hamada Hibiki has nothing to do with it.

495
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
We found a new video.

496
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It's a national road 300 meters away from the site of the discovery.

497
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
A person on the sidewalk is trying to throw something.

498
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,340
It's a

499
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Is it Junichi Inagi?

500
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I don't know.

501
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
What did you throw?

502
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I'll expand it further.

503
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Knife?

504
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
He threw the weapon into the dump.

505
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It's Hamada Hibiki's phone.

506
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
The history of the phone was deleted.

507
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Let me record it.

508
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I don't think it's possible.

509
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You can't?

510
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
But the current phone has the function of the Lus 6.

511
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I think it's possible.

512
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
It's a

513
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Good luck.

514
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
August 5th, 21.20.

515
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
There was a message from Junichi Inagi on your phone.

516
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
It's the time you were performing.

517
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
You must have heard the Lus 6 after the performance.

518
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And deleted it.

519
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
But we can restore it.

520
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's me.

521
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Junichi.

522
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Don't worry anymore.

523
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
There's no one to get in your way.

524
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
If you hear this Lus power, delete it.

525
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
The person who gets in the way is Ichiro Kurata.

526
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Did you ask Junichi Inagi to kill Kurata?

527
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I don't know.

528
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Hey.

529
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
From Fukushima's construction site.

530
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Knife and Kurata's phone were found.

531
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I found it.

532
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I found the phone.

533
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I found it.

534
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
The blood that was attached to the knife was Ichiro Kurata's.

535
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Your fingerprints were also collected.

536
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Why did you kill Kurata?

537
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Hamada Hibiki asked you to do it.

538
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
No.

539
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Why?

540
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Hey.

541
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Say something.

542
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Is it a conspiracy?

543
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
They didn't talk to each other.

544
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Since the weapon was found, it must be a crime of Junichi Inagi.

545
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
You can arrest him now.

546
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Ichikacho.

547
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
What do you think?

548
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
That's what the police...

549
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Hamada Hibiki is involved.

550
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
They are two.

551
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I want you to search for evidence that leads to the motive.

552
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Digital evidence.

553
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Inside the heart.

554
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Please.

555
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Motive?

556
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
An analysis of Ichiro Kurata's phone.

557
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
An analysis of Junichi Inagi and Hamada Hibiki's phone.

558
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Collecting new video footage.

559
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Please do it in one minute.

560
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I understand.

561
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Yes.

562
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Your number was in Ichiro Kurata's phone.

563
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Kurata was swaying by his mother.

564
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,000
You paid Kurata to protect Hibiki.

565
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
If a yakuza like me...

566
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
...was told that he was his real father...

567
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
...he would say, it's over.

568
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
That Hibiki's future as a pianist is not there.

569
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,000
You asked Junichi Inagi to kill Ichiro Kurata?

570
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
No way!

571
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
If I did that...

572
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
...he would really say it's over.

573
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It's true.

574
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
It's true.

575
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Junichi Inagi's writing.

576
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
The writing that attacked Hamada Hibiki...

577
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
...was gone on the 13th of July.

578
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
The video was uploaded.

579
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
July 20th.

580
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
25th.

581
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
29th.

582
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
August 3rd.

583
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
But Junichi Inagi didn't write anything.

584
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
The two of them met on July 15th.

585
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
On the day of the university concert...

586
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
...they met for the first time in 16 years.

587
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So he didn't want to write anything?

588
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Actually, another strange thing is...

589
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
...on July 16th, Junichi Inagi downloaded classical music.

590
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Classical?

591
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,920
The

592
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I heard that Hibiki Hamada's mother was paid by Ichiro Kurata.

593
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
You knew about it, didn't you?

594
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
July 15th.

595
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,000
You're waiting for Ichiro Kurata after meeting Hibiki Hamada.

596
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
It's a video of a fire in front of the station near Tamaondoe.

597
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
What does this mean?

598
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Explain it.

599
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
He suddenly appeared.

600
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Hey!

601
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
You're the same, Junichi!

602
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
You look the same as Junji!

603
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
What? What?

604
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Did you forget your parents?

605
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Well, it can't be helped.

606
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
You were still a kid when you were abandoned.

607
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Dad.

608
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
You met Junji, didn't you?

609
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Did you tell him about the darkness?

610
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
That's right.

611
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
He's the only one who thinks it's good.

612
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I named him Junji.

613
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
You should have named him Hibiki.

614
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It's only natural to blame your real parents.

615
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
If they found out that someone like me was your real parents,

616
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Hibiki Hamada would be in deep trouble.

617
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
If you say that, it's a one-shot.

618
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
What do you mean?

619
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Your mother paid you.

620
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I'll pay you more than a million yen.

621
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
You're shaking it?

622
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Do you know what his ear is?

623
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Ear?

624
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I can't hear his left ear.

625
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I hit him when he was three years old and I couldn't hear him.

626
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It's a big deal. That's why he's playing the piano.

627
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
But I couldn't hear his right ear.

628
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
That's it.

629
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
He's the worst person.

630
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
It's natural for that bastard to die.

631
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
He's the worst.

632
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:33,000
But I don't think you killed your father for that.

633
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Why didn't you upload the video of Hibiki Hamada?

634
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
You downloaded a song that didn't fit your phone.

635
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
What was it?

636
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,120
Chopin's phantom-like

637
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,000
Eichatan's

638
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,000
It was played by Hibiki Hamada at his concert on July 15.

639
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I was listening to the performance.

640
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Thank you.

641
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I'm sorry.

642
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I'm sorry.

643
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I'm sorry.

644
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I'm sorry.

645
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I'm sorry.

646
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I'm sorry.

647
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I'm sorry.

648
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I'm sorry.

649
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I'm sorry.

650
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I'm sorry.

651
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I'm sorry.

652
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I'm sorry.

653
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I'm sorry.

654
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I'm sorry.

655
00:37:50,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Thank you for your hard work.

656
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Please play it.

657
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Thank you.

658
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I'm sorry.

659
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Thank you.

660
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Thank you.

661
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I couldn't move.

662
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
While I was fighting with my stupid fights,

663
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Junji was working so hard.

664
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
He's amazing.

665
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
He's not good at art.

666
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
He's not good at anything.

667
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
He's amazing.

668
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
He doesn't know anything about art.

669
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
It was the first time I heard piano and cried.

670
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
It's unfair.

671
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I had the worst life.

672
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
You were paid to be a pianist.

673
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I could only say that.

674
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I was so happy.

675
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I was.

676
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
That's why I couldn't forgive Ichiro Kurata.

677
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
If you can't hear your right ear,

678
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
it's over.

679
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I can't forgive you.

680
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I can't forgive you.

681
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I can't forgive you.

682
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
But...

683
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I'm an idiot.

684
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I couldn't find another way.

685
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I'm an idiot.

686
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I'm an idiot.

687
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I'm an idiot.

688
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I arrested the victim of Ichiro Kurata's murder,

689
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Junichi Inagi, 21 years old.

690
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Junichi Inagi is the son of Mr. Kurata.

691
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
He's also a criminal.

692
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
What's the difference between a real son and a fake one?

693
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Tell me the motive of the murder.

694
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Well...

695
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I'm sorry.

696
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
It's going to be a long story.

697
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
What?

698
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
My personal feelings.

699
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
What are you talking about?

700
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
What do you mean by personal feelings?

701
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Do you have a twin?

702
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I don't have one.

703
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I don't know.

704
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Here you go.

705
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Thank you.

706
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
It's the time of the first public performance of Hamada Hibiki.

707
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
One minute from the beginning of the performance.

708
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
5 minutes past 11.

709
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Maybe that's when my brother stabbed Ichiro Kurata.

710
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
My brother felt something and stopped.

711
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
What?

712
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Is that true?

713
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
You're thinking too much.

714
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I got an email from Hamada Hibiki.

715
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Ms. Haruka Aoyagi.

716
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I'm sorry I kept it a secret.

717
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I was told about the incident and my social media is on fire.

718
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I'm sorry.

719
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
The scandal is getting worse.

720
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
As a musician who will be on the fish,

721
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I'm worried about the image of the situation.

722
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I'm worried about my family and people around me.

723
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
But I'm in a world of real power.

724
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I believe that if I can make people's hearts calm

725
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
and perform a moving performance,

726
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I can be recognized.

727
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I'll try my best again.

728
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I want Junichi to listen to it again.

729
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I'll transform you.

730
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
What?

731
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
You can do it, Hitako.

732
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
That's right.

733
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I'm serious.

734
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
You're not a woman.

735
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
