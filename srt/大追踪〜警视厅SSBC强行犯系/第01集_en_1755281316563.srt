Now discussing the product.

00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,960
It is Kusei Sc insecure.

The society and focused now on the

13
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,760
I'm checking the video of the fire in the nearby forest.

14
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,760
I'm sorry for the trouble.

15
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,760
I'm Inspector Iga-ki.

16
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,760
Police?

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,760
Yes.

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,760
There's a security camera here.

19
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,760
Please show me the video from 1 to 2.

20
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,760
You cut my ticket yesterday.

21
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,760
What?

22
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,760
You didn't stop at the right time.

23
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,760
I stopped at the right time.

24
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,760
Please show me the security camera.

25
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,760
What?

26
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,760
Please.

27
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,760
Just a moment.

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,760
No.

29
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,760
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,760
Inspector.

31
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,760
Please call me.

32
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,760
Roger.

33
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,760
Excuse me.

34
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,760
I'm Reiji Hashimoto.

35
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,760
Hashimoto!

36
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,760
Inspector!

37
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,760
Today at 3.43 pm,

38
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,760
on the road of Ota-ku Kamata 2-chome,

39
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,760
we arrested a suspect who shot the Kusei Police Chief.

40
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,760
His name is Reiji Hashimoto, 40 years old.

41
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,760
He's not excited.

42
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,760
That's right.

43
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,760
He shot the Chief of Police and arrested him.

44
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,760
I wonder what that guy looks like.

45
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,760
It's delicious.

46
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
Who sent it?

47
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,760
My subordinate sent it.

48
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,760
A famous Okayama man.

49
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,760
He likes it.

50
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,760
It's time for speed.

51
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,760
Please come to the scene.

52
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,760
We're the investigation team.

53
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,760
What do you mean?

54
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
We're doing it.

55
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,760
Excuse me.

56
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,760
You're busy.

57
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,760
But you're not.

58
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,760
Good work.

59
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,760
Chief of Investigation Team Aoyagi will read it.

60
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,760
On behalf of SSBC,

61
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,760
you contributed greatly to the investigation of the suspect

62
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,760
in the Kusei Police Chief shooting case.

63
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,760
I present you with this.

64
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,760
Good work.

65
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,760
Thank you.

66
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,760
Thank you.

67
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,760
What?

68
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,760
Nothing.

69
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,760
Thank you.

70
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,760
Just this?

71
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,760
I'm grateful.

72
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,760
If you weren't here, the company wouldn't have grown this big.

73
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:32,380
If you think so, there's no such thing as a

74
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,760
big company.

75
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,760
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,760
Today, we're taking SSBC's head of police.

77
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,760
He's Nanami Rintaro.

78
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,760
Nice to meet you.

79
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,760
I'm Nanami Rintaro.

80
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,760
Why are you here again?

81
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,760
Nanami was admitted to the police station

82
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,760
after passing the state official's

83
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,760
mid-term recruitment test last year.

84
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,760
In the carrier company?

85
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,760
Until then, he was a fund manager

86
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,760
at a foreign-owned company.

87
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,760
In the midterm recruitment test last year,

88
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,760
820 people passed and 2 passed.

89
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
800?

90
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
400 times the average?

91
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,760
Mr. Aoyagi.

92
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,760
So, Nanami, please analyze the orbit.

93
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,760
Analyze the orbit?

94
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,760
Please tell me a lot, Mr. Iyaki.

95
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
500?

96
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,760
Me?

97
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,760
Nice to meet you.

98
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,760
A report from the police station.

99
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,760
A man is lying down in the apartment complex.

100
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,760
The location is Shinagawa-ku, Kitashinagawa,

101
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,760
8th street, No.12-9.

102
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,760
A man has been bleeding heavily from his abdomen.

103
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,760
He's stopped worrying.

104
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,760
I'll go in.

105
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,760
Please.

106
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,760
I'll be back.

107
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,760
Let's go.

108
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,760
Please go ahead.

109
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,760
The Police Station's

110
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,760
Operation Support Analysis Center.

111
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,760
It's known as SSBC.

112
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,760
It's a department that collects and analyzes

113
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
camera footage,

114
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,760
data analysis of smartphones and computers,

115
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,760
and profiles of suspects,

116
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,760
and supports all kinds of operations.

117
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,760
And this time,

118
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,760
a special team is established

119
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,760
to support the investigation team

120
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,760
in the investigation of murder, robbery, and fire.

121
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,760
Its name is SSBC,

122
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,640
Esomiyaki Store.

123
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,640
Let me see it over there.

124
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,640
It has nothing to do with the thing over there.

125
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,640
They at work collecting roadsmaps.

126
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,140
We'll have to find room for them.

127
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,460
They're coming! They're coming!

128
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,780
They're coming! They're coming!

129
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,060
Now, make sure to keep them under control.

130
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,260
Roger.

131
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,340
Thank you. Don't put them in.

132
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,180
I'm Igaaki from SSBC.

133
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,020
I'm Oya Mada.

134
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,580
I'm Joe.

135
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:36,940
I'm Nana.

136
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,940
Thank you.

137
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,900
I'm Minamoto.

138
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,660
I'm Mii.

139
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,340
Mii?

140
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,340
What time did the victim die?

141
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,620
Ah, it seems to be from 10 o'clock to about 0 o'clock.

142
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,460
Good.

143
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,820
Let's start with the control room.

144
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,660
Yes.

145
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,980
We're at a nearby house.

146
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,700
Please.

147
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,420
Where is the victim?

148
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,580
What?

149
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,980
Ah, it's Satoshi Kiryu from the Immigration Office.

150
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,260
Satoshi Kiryu?

151
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,460
Oh, wait.

152
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,900
No, Mr. Nanami.

153
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,260
Is this the resident?

154
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,540
Yes, but...

155
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,860
I said no!

156
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,980
Um, this is SSBC, right?

157
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,100
No, we can't go in, Mr. Nanami.

158
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,900
Mr. Nanami.

159
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,660
We can't go in here.

160
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,700
No, no.

161
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,940
He was stabbed and pushed into the garbage.

162
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,020
What are you doing?

163
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,180
Ah.

164
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,860
Why are you guys here?

165
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,980
We're checking the body.

166
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,660
It has nothing to do with SSBC.

167
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,860
Get to your work.

168
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,860
Yes, ma'am.

169
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,300
Don't be a jerk.

170
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,300
Go now.

171
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,660
Ah, sorry.

172
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,620
They're so good.

173
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,140
Who are they?

174
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,540
We're the investigation team.

175
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,260
They're the ones who are the key players.

176
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,820
They think SSBC is a secret organization.

177
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,900
A secret organization?

178
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,340
What happened?

179
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,660
The siren on the car was amazing.

180
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,380
There was an incident.

181
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,380
Please wear this.

182
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,180
It's summer.

183
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,740
It's the second day of the summer.

184
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,740
Oh.

185
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,460
This man even has a cat.

186
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,940
Is he your neighbor?

187
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,140
That cat comes into our house very often.

188
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,300
I'll go now.

189
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,060
His name is Tama.

190
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,660
This man is also your neighbor.

191
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,860
His name is Ozaki, but he's still single.

192
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,860
I'll go now.

193
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,660
He's only 20 years old.

194
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,340
That's weird.

195
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,340
Ah.

196
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,500
Who is this?

197
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,060
I don't know.

198
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,500
Could it be?

199
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Yes.

200
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,660
11.12 pm.

201
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,260
It's close to the time of the death.

202
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,380
Is he the culprit?

203
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,380
The culprit?

204
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,380
Ah.

205
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,980
Please copy this video.

206
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,300
It's a video.

207
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,300
A video?

208
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,700
I'll take a video, so it's a video.

209
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,300
The person who was murdered was Satoshi Kiryu, 35 years old.

210
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,500
He's the president of a company called Playverse.

211
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:33,460
Playverse was established by Kiryu, who was a 26-year-old game creator, nine years ago.

212
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:37,100
He grew rapidly with the hit of a smartphone game called Beast Tower.

213
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,180
Last year's annual prize was 2 billion yen.

214
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,780
Have you not found the culprit yet?

215
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,460
Yes.

216
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:46,300
It seems that Kiryu's watch and smartphone were also taken by the culprit.

217
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,700
Mr. Mizuka.

218
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,420
The vice president of Playverse was attacked by someone last night.

219
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,180
Vice president?

220
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,300
When I was trying to get in my car at the parking lot,

221
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,740
a man approached me.

222
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,340
Did you see his face?

223
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,100
He was wearing a hat and wearing a mask.

224
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,140
He was attacked by a knife, right?

225
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,340
It was like a knife.

226
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,100
So he stabbed you in the leg?

227
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,580
I think the person was after my belly.

228
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,700
I suddenly raised my leg.

229
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,340
I was playing karate when I was a student.

230
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,140
Do you know the exact time when he was attacked?

231
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,980
I think it was about 11.30 p.m. when the officer left.

232
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,780
There is a possibility of a unification.

233
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,020
Unification?

234
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,580
Actually, Satoshi Kiryu passed away last night.

235
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,580
It's a lie.

236
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,580
It's a lie.

237
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,980
The president?

238
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,980
It's a lie!

239
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:07,980
The man who was killed by Kiryu was running from the crime scene to Shibuya.

240
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,580
The last video was taken at 11.52 p.m.

241
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,580
It was 11.52 p.m.

242
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,580
It was the first day of the Shibuya incident.

243
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,580
I don't know the route from there.

244
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,580
It seems better to follow the front foot.

245
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,580
Front foot?

246
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,580
The criminal follows the route to the crime scene.

247
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,580
And the escape route is called the back foot.

248
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,580
Back foot?

249
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,580
Usually, the movement of the back foot is fast and direct.

250
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,580
The mind that wants to get away from the crime scene works as fast as possible.

251
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,580
But the front foot is different.

252
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:50,580
At this stage, there is no crime, so there is no need to hide.

253
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,580
The guard will be relaxed, so it's easier to chase than the back foot.

254
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:59,580
If you know where you came from, you may be able to get to the criminal's house.

255
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,580
I will study.

256
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,580
Well...

257
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,580
I'm Kizawa, an information analyst.

258
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,580
My specialty is profiling.

259
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,580
Profiling?

260
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,580
Mitsumoto is a technical assistant.

261
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,580
I'm in charge of smartphones and computer analysis.

262
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,580
Oh.

263
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,580
I'm a professional image analysis specialist at Nishinawa Information Center.

264
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,580
Please leave the face recognition to me.

265
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,580
Face recognition?

266
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,580
Here they come!

267
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,580
Chief Ichikawa, have you completed the specificity of the suspect?

268
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,580
I haven't said anything yet.

269
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,580
Did you have a security camera that the suspect was in?

270
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,580
I'm analyzing it now.

271
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,580
It depends on the SSBC's efforts.

272
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,580
I see.

273
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,580
Why?

274
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,580
Without the suspect's image, the investigation cannot proceed.

275
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:51,580
Well, we're not relying on cameras to investigate.

276
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,580
Ittasou!

277
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,580
Chief Kusei is a special assistant.

278
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,580
What?

279
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,580
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

280
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,580
What are you doing?

281
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,580
Hey, you guys, don't come here.

282
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,580
You're the ones who are in danger.

283
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,580
Come in.

284
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,580
Kuzahara, there's a chief of Kusei.

285
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,580
What?

286
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,580
Chief of Kusei?

287
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,580
Yes, come in.

288
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,580
Your wounds have improved a lot.

289
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,580
I came to thank you.

290
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:25,580
I'm sure you guys did your best to protect the suspect who shot me.

291
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,580
I'm very grateful.

292
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,580
Thank you.

293
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,580
You're welcome.

294
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,580
I'm sorry.

295
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,580
Well, Rintaro, are you doing well?

296
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,580
Yes.

297
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,580
You're the one in charge of the investigation of Chief Kusei.

298
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,580
Rintaro?

299
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,580
Yes.

300
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,580
You're a real man.

301
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,580
Do your best.

302
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,580
I'll do my best to teach you guys.

303
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,580
Uncle.

304
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,580
Uncle?

305
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,580
This is my younger brother.

306
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,580
Your younger brother?

307
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,580
Nanami?

308
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,580
Chief Kambou.

309
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,580
What?

310
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,580
I wasn't hiding anything.

311
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,580
I didn't think I'd need to tell you.

312
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,580
Why would someone like him be in SSBC?

313
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,580
It was a coincidence.

314
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,580
A coincidence?

315
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,580
Chief Ishikawa.

316
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,580
Yes?

317
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,580
I'm here to help them solve the case.

318
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,580
Yes, sir.

319
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,580
Yes.

320
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,580
I'll immediately investigate the suspect.

321
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,580
I'll see you at a busy place.

322
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,580
Aoyagi.

323
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,580
Yes.

324
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,580
Excuse me.

325
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,580
Kone?

326
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,580
No.

327
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,580
I'm here.

328
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,580
Chief Kambou's son?

329
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,580
Is SSBC a special department?

330
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,580
I'm just a special agent.

331
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,580
I'm a part-time detective.

332
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,580
But Nanami is here.

333
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,580
I'm going to do something.

334
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,580
I'm not going!

335
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,580
What?

336
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,580
I...

337
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,580
I've put Nanami next to him.

338
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,580
What?

339
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,580
Chief Kirei went into the scene without permission.

340
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,580
What did you do?

341
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,580
I'm sorry.

342
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,580
It was just SSBC.

343
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,580
You're just a part-time detective.

344
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,580
I didn't say that.

345
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,580
I'm the former police chief.

346
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,580
I'm still a big influence on the police.

347
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,580
They just took the person I don't like.

348
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,580
I'll apologize to Nanami.

349
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,580
Wait.

350
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,580
Yes.

351
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,580
It's strange that a part-time detective is a part-time detective.

352
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,580
Then what should I do?

353
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,580
Do something you didn't do.

354
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,580
What?

355
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,580
Don't be so polite.

356
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,580
What do you mean?

357
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,580
Think about it yourself.

358
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,580
Anyway,

359
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,580
do something you didn't do.

360
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,580
Please.

361
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,580
Read the atmosphere.

362
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,580
Yes.

363
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,580
Oh.

364
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,580
Everyone, lunch.

365
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,580
You're not going?

366
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,580
While I was in the bathroom,

367
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,580
no one was there.

368
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,580
That's scary and hard to invite.

369
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,580
When did you start working for SSBC?

370
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,580
What?

371
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,580
Where did you work before that?

372
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,580
I worked for the police department three years ago.

373
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,580
Police department?

374
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,580
Yes.

375
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,580
What can I do for you?

376
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,580
I have a problem.

377
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,580
A problem?

378
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,580
I got a report and hit a defendant.

379
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,580
Oh.

380
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,580
Mr. Igaki was a martial artist.

381
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,580
Martial artist?

382
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,580
He was a big shot.

383
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,580
Big shot?

384
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,580
It's an old story.

385
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,580
But SSBC is also a big shot, right?

386
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,580
Just like the investigation department.

387
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,580
No, we're not.

388
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,580
Huh?

389
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,580
Mr. Igaki?

390
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,580
What?

391
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,580
This guy.

392
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,580
Osaki Station.

393
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,580
9.02 PM.

394
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,580
Two hours before the crime.

395
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,580
I need more information.

396
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,580
I know this.

397
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,580
Okay, I'll contact the police.

398
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,580
Not yet, Mr. Igaki.

399
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:20,580
We have to find out where he came from.

400
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,580
Huh?

401
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,580
Let's go.

402
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,580
Go?

403
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,580
This way.

404
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,580
Wait.

405
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,580
All our bikes have drive recorders.

406
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,580
It's a big problem if something goes wrong.

407
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,580
It's not just a fire.

408
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,580
Is this the next stop?

409
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,580
Yes, the fourth stop.

410
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,580
Stop for a second.

411
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,580
Oh, no.

412
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,580
This guy.

413
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,580
Are you sure?

414
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,580
I went to deliver the burgers,

415
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,580
but they said they didn't have drinks.

416
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,580
It wasn't on the menu.

417
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,580
Mr. Igaki.

418
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,580
Tell me your name and address.

419
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,580
Okay.

420
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,580
That's it.

421
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,580
Room 201.

422
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,580
I'm in the room, Mr. Nanami.

423
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,580
Okay, I'll contact the police.

424
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,580
You can call me Nanami.

425
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,580
Mr. Igaki is my teacher.

426
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,580
I'll call you later.

427
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,580
It's okay.

428
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,580
What about Nanami?

429
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,580
I'll call you later.

430
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,580
Okay, I'll contact the police.

431
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,580
The criminal is right in front of you.

432
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,580
What if he runs away while the police are calling him?

433
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,580
Huh?

434
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:54,580
SSBCs shouldn't contact the investigators directly.

435
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,580
When they find him, call the police

436
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,580
and we'll check the investigators' actions.

437
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,580
We're big, aren't we?

438
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,580
No, big is...

439
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,580
I'm just asking for the sake of it.

440
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,580
No, no.

441
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,580
I'll take responsibility.

442
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,580
I changed jobs to catch the bad guys.

443
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,580
Let's go, Mr. Igaki.

444
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,580
Okay.

445
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,580
What about you, Mr. Nanami?

446
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,580
Can you wait downstairs?

447
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,580
Downstairs?

448
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,580
Yes.

449
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,580
I'll be waiting.

450
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,580
Yes.

451
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,580
I'm writing this down.

452
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,580
Please return it.

453
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,580
Yes.

454
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,580
Mr. Saito, you're in a good mood.

455
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,580
Wait!

456
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,580
Watch out!

457
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,580
Nanami!

458
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,580
Stop!

459
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,580
Stop!

460
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,580
What?

461
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,580
At 2.30 p.m., arrest the criminal for offending the police.

462
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:47,580
SSBCs shouldn't contact the investigators directly.

463
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,580
Why would SSBCs do something like that?

464
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,580
Mr. Igaki, explain.

465
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,580
It was an emergency.

466
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,580
We ran into Saito.

467
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,580
We'll report this case to the police and check the actions.

468
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,580
SSBCs shouldn't contact the investigators directly.

469
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,580
You're not going to do anything about it, Mr. Nanami.

470
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,580
You're just being a coward.

471
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,580
Well, that's true.

472
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,580
Are you sure, Mr. Nanami?

473
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,580
What are you going to do if you're going to do something like this?

474
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,580
I'm going to write a death certificate.

475
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,580
What?

476
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,580
Mr. Igaki stopped you.

477
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,580
But I'm going to do it.

478
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,580
Right, Mr. Igaki?

479
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,580
Well...

480
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,580
You don't have to defend him.

481
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,580
That's right, Mr. Nanami.

482
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,580
If this becomes a problem, I'll write a death certificate.

483
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,580
No, no, you don't have to do that, Mr. Nanami.

484
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,580
Are you okay?

485
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,580
You don't have to do that.

486
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,580
Didn't you say it was an emergency?

487
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,580
Oh, yes.

488
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,580
It's an emergency.

489
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,580
It's an emergency.

490
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,580
Right?

491
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,580
It's an emergency.

492
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,580
It's been a while since I've been in a car.

493
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,580
You were so cool, Mr. Igaki.

494
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,580
Really?

495
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,580
But I didn't think you'd hit me.

496
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,580
Your glasses are broken.

497
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,580
I'm sorry, Mr. Nanami.

498
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,580
I'm an amateur.

499
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,580
I haven't learned any arresting techniques.

500
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,580
I won't let you do that anymore.

501
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,580
SSB people don't usually do dangerous things.

502
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,580
Saito confessed to killing President Kiryu.

503
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,580
All right.

504
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,580
I did it.

505
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,580
But it's a dark bite.

506
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,580
What?

507
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,580
2 million.

508
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,580
After he said he'd do it,

509
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,580
I was surprised to hear that he was being killed.

510
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,580
I really wanted money.

511
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,580
Did you get 2 million?

512
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,580
I got 50 million in cash.

513
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,580
Did you meet the instigator?

514
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,580
Did you see his face?

515
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,580
In the bathroom at Shinjuku Station.

516
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,580
I was handed over from the top of the shelf.

517
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,580
So...

518
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,580
You didn't see it?

519
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,580
We found 380,000 yen in cash from the back of Saito's room.

520
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,580
It seems that the 120,000 yen was used in the cabaret.

521
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,580
Dark bite.

522
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,580
Did you get President Kiryu's smartphone?

523
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,580
His smartphone and a weapon knife were thrown away in Tokyo Bay.

524
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,580
Did you get that too?

525
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,580
Yes.

526
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,580
He said he just wanted the watch.

527
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,580
He paid for it and made him kill.

528
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:25,580
The instigator was the person who had a grudge against President Kiryu.

529
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,580
I can think of such a motive.

530
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:34,580
How did Saito contact the instigator?

531
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,580
It's a paid message.

532
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,580
It's an app that can delete data in 24 hours.

533
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,580
The target is President Kiryu Satoshi.

534
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,580
Please execute it by July 5.

535
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,580
It's a paid message from Saito's smartphone.

536
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,580
It's possible.

537
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,580
As expected.

538
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,580
Who is the instigator?

539
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,580
It's a server overseas.

540
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,580
You don't know?

541
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,580
That's meaningless.

542
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,580
We want to find the instigator.

543
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,580
I understand that.

544
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,580
It's useless.

545
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,580
I'll do it in a few days.

546
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,580
Hurry up.

547
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:10,580
I will thoroughly clean up the human relations of President Kiryu and Tamai Ryosuke.

548
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,580
Okay.

549
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,580
Are we sorry for our loss?

550
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,580
It's useless.

551
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,580
Where is President Kiryu's smartphone?

552
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,580
But he was thrown away in Tokyo Bay.

553
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,580
I can't find it.

554
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,580
Is this all we can do?

555
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,580
Don't you feel bad?

556
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,580
I'm sorry to hear that.

557
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:57,900
Can't we really control the red

558
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,580
color?

559
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,580
Can I continue the investigation?

560
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,580
Isn't it okay?

561
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,580
Really?

562
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,580
Thank you, Mr. President.

563
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:15,580
But you have to get the results.

564
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,580
I understand.

565
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,580
The guy who resented the president.

566
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,580
Do you have any idea?

567
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,580
I'm also resented.

568
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,580
Do you have any idea?

569
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,580
Kawase?

570
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,580
Kawase?

571
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,580
Mr. Kawase Koichi.

572
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,580
Yes.

573
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:59,580
Please tell me about your relationship with Mr. Kiryu.

574
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:08,580
I met Mr. Kiryu when I was a college student.

575
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,580
We both started playing the game.

576
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,580
What is your role?

577
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,580
I'm a programmer.

578
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,580
What did Tamai Ryosuke do there?

579
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,580
Three years ago.

580
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:29,580
Mr. Kiryu was the business partner who was in charge of the business.

581
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,580
Yes.

582
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:36,580
Since then, he has been making a close relationship with Tamai Ryosuke.

583
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,580
It wasn't interesting, was it?

584
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,580
But I don't know much about business.

585
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,580
You quit the game last June.

586
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,580
What?

587
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:54,580
I used the company's money to arrest Mr. Kiryu.

588
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:01,580
It seems that Tamai Ryosuke is the one who noticed the use of the money.

589
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,580
Wait a minute.

590
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,580
Did you both resented the president?

591
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,580
I didn't kill him.

592
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,580
It wasn't me.

593
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,580
You're quick to realize.

594
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,580
It's Saito.

595
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,580
16 hours and 1 minute and 28 seconds.

596
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,580
I'll send it.

597
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,580
Here it is.

598
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,580
16 hours and 13 minutes and 25 seconds.

599
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,580
Saito was in the bathroom for 12 minutes.

600
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,580
25 people were in the bathroom.

601
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,580
25 people were killed.

602
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,580
Is there anyone who gave the money?

603
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,580
Not only that.

604
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,580
Maybe he went out after he went in front of Saito.

605
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,580
And I don't know if I have to follow everyone's footsteps.

606
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,580
That's it?

607
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,580
Oh my god.

608
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,580
I'm scared.

609
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,580
You're so strange, Mr. Tamai.

610
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,580
If you don't raise your legs, you'll get stabbed in the stomach.

611
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,580
And you're kicking me with a stabbed leg.

612
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,580
I'm going to beat you up now.

613
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,580
Are you interested in something?

614
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,580
No.

615
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,580
Why did he run away?

616
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:30,580
I think he was ordered to kill Mr. Tamai.

617
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,580
I was surprised to see it in reverse.

618
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:38,580
It's a lot of money to attack a sub-company.

619
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,580
There's a drive recorder in the car parked.

620
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,580
And it's a little bit of a trick.

621
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:54,580
Can you defend yourself so well in such a sudden situation?

622
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,580
You're going to blow up with such a kick.

623
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,580
What does that mean?

624
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,580
Did you find it?

625
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,580
You found a knife, so you'll find your smartphone.

626
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:23,580
I've been looking for two days.

627
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,580
Shall we go home?

628
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:29,580
Hey, everyone's working hard.

629
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,580
What?

630
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,580
Everyone's working hard.

631
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,580
What?

632
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,580
Please believe me.

633
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,580
Calm down, Mr. Kawase.

634
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,580
You're a big killer.

635
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,580
Of course you should be grateful.

636
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,580
Then why did you betray the president?

637
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,580
You're the one who stole the company's money.

638
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,580
Mr. Tamai.

639
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,580
The one who used it was the vice president.

640
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,580
It's my fault.

641
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,580
But Mr. Kiryu didn't believe me.

642
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,580
Mr. Kiryu was deceived by Mr. Tamai.

643
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,580
Is that what you call a basis?

644
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,580
But it's definitely true.

645
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,580
But what is it?

646
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,580
The president's death

647
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,580
Mr. Tamai.

648
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,580
Mr. Kiryu died.

649
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:49,580
Does that mean Mr. Tamai will be the president of Play Verge?

650
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,580
I don't know.

651
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,580
But that's what happens.

652
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,580
Because it's number two.

653
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:02,580
Does that have anything to do with the incident?

654
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,580
No, I just wanted to confirm.

655
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,580
Are you done?

656
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,580
I have one more question.

657
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,580
How many times has Mr. Tamai been in Karate?

658
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,580
He's been doing it, right?

659
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,580
It's not a black belt.

660
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,580
He's from a middle school club.

661
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,580
Excuse me.

662
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,580
I'm glad you're not hurt.

663
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,580
He's been walking around.

664
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,580
I was surprised.

665
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,580
It might be a hit.

666
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,580
Mr. Igaki's slip.

667
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,580
I found Mr. Kiryu's phone.

668
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,580
Is this what happened?

669
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,580
He was in a coma for three days.

670
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,580
And he's been broken on the screen.

671
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,580
He took out the board.

672
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,580
And he's been on the same phone.

673
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,580
I'll call you.

674
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,580
Please revive!

675
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,580
He's in!

676
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,580
He's not dead.

677
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,580
And he's been on the same phone for two days.

678
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,580
I'll call him every day.

679
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,580
Aoyagi.

680
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,580
Yes?

681
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,580
This case is...

682
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,580
The chief of the Kusei Prefectural Office said it would be solved soon.

683
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,580
We were under pressure.

684
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,580
I know.

685
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,580
Is there anyone else suspicious?

686
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,580
That's...

687
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,580
There's no one.

688
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,580
Only Kawase is here.

689
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,580
At least let him go.

690
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,580
That's your job.

691
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,580
When I saw Mr. Kiryu...

692
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,580
...died on the news...

693
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,580
I...

694
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,580
What?

695
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,580
Tamae Ryosuke disappeared from the hospital.

696
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,580
What?

697
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:04,580
Tamae went home and took a taxi 20 minutes later.

698
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,580
He's been caught.

699
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,580
What are you talking about?

700
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,580
Where are you?

701
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,580
At Tamae's apartment.

702
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,580
Why Tamae?

703
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,580
If you're suspicious, he's suspicious.

704
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,580
Find out about Mr. Kiryu and Tamae.

705
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,580
What?

706
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,580
Tamae's been missing for three days.

707
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,580
He's been missing for three days.

708
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,580
Find out about Mr. Kiryu and Tamae.

709
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,580
What?

710
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,580
Find out if they have trouble.

711
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,580
SSB is ordering the family?

712
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,580
Why are you controlling them?

713
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,580
We've already caught Kawase and the man.

714
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,580
We're investigating.

715
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,580
Kawase?

716
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,580
He's an ex-programmer who made Mr. Kiryu and PlayBird.

717
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,580
But he was fired from the company.

718
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,580
There's a reason to blame him.

719
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,580
Does he admit it?

720
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,580
It's not easy to admit.

721
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,580
It's none of your business.

722
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,580
Don't do anything stupid.

723
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,580
Kawase?

724
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,580
He's a member of PlayBird.

725
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:06,580
He was only with Mr. Kiryu at first.

726
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:10,580
The man who worked so hard with him is the owner of the company.

727
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,580
It's Iga.

728
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,580
I asked the taxi company.

729
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,580
Mr. Tamae is in Tokyo.

730
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,580
This is Tamae.

731
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,580
Did you take the Shinkansen to the north?

732
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,580
I'm on my phone.

733
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,580
It's 10 minutes and 20 minutes.

734
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,580
Do you know where you bought the ticket?

735
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,580
Yes.

736
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,580
It's light.

737
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,580
It's 10 minutes and 33 minutes.

738
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,580
It's 11 minutes and 36 minutes.

739
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,580
It's the Shirotaka 559.

740
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,580
It's already on.

741
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,580
I found Mr. Tamae's social media.

742
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,580
He posts a lot of things.

743
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,580
He has a villa in Karuizawa.

744
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,580
Villa?

745
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,580
It's his favorite hideout.

746
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,580
He's a good guy.

747
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,580
What's his address?

748
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,580
I don't know.

749
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,580
I think you can identify the location from the photo.

750
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,580
Try it.

751
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,580
Let's go.

752
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,580
Karuizawa is a good place.

753
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,580
The shadow direction is this way.

754
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:30,580
The road in front is Nishigawa or Kitagawa.

755
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,580
Yes.

756
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,580
Mr. Kaka.

757
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,580
This is on Mr. Kiryu's phone.

758
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,580
I was wrong.

759
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,580
What?

760
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,580
Mr. Aoyagi.

761
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,580
Kawase borrowed 500,000 yen from Yamikin.

762
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,580
What?

763
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:59,580
The money that Saito received on June 30th is perfect.

764
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,580
Sir.

765
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:05,580
There is no proof of Kawase's sale on June 30th.

766
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,580
Okay.

767
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,580
Kawase gave the order to Yamibaito.

768
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,580
He's the one who gave the money.

769
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,580
Hello.

770
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,580
Narita.

771
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,580
I saw him on the camera.

772
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,580
The same guy?

773
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,580
Yes.

774
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,580
I found out who he was.

775
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,580
Did you?

776
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,580
What?

777
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,580
What?

778
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,580
I'm sure.

779
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,580
I'm a face recognition professional.

780
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,580
Mr. Iga.

781
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:38,580
I've identified the location from Mr. Tamai's villa.

782
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,580
I'll send it now.

783
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,580
Thank you.

784
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,580
Let's go.

785
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,580
I have all the evidence.

786
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,580
What about the motive?

787
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,580
The motive?

788
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,580
Mr. Kiryu Tamai must be killed.

789
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,580
It's the real reason.

790
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,580
You don't have to think about that.

791
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,580
We're under the law.

792
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,580
That's right.

793
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,580
I can't run away.

794
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,580
Thank goodness.

795
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:30,580
So you were here, Mr. Tamai.

796
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,580
Mr. Keiji.

797
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,580
I'll send the evidence now.

798
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,580
Yes, sir.

799
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,580
I'll send it now.

800
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,580
Thank you.

801
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,580
I'll get to the point.

802
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,580
What is it?

803
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,580
Mr. Tamai.

804
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,580
You're the one who ordered the dark-bite.

805
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,580
What?

806
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,580
You hired Saito and killed Mr. Kiryu.

807
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,580
What did you do?

808
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,580
You're the one who took the company's money.

809
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:07,580
At first, you pretended to be Kawase.

810
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,580
Kawase ran away from the company.

811
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:15,580
But finally, the truth was revealed to Mr. Kiryu.

812
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,580
Did you embezzle 100 million yen?

813
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,580
Or 500 million yen?

814
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,580
What are you talking about?

815
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,580
You were fired.

816
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,580
Mr. Kiryu was charged with the crime.

817
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:34,580
In other words, you lost everything.

818
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,580
Where did you get that evidence?

819
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,580
I killed Mr. Kiryu before that happened.

820
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,580
Nanami.

821
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,580
Yes, sir.

822
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,580
Don't say that.

823
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,580
I paid for it.

824
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,580
I killed Mr. Kiryu.

825
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,580
It's ridiculous.

826
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,580
I was fired too.

827
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,580
That's self-sacrifice.

828
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,580
I'll do it well.

829
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:10,580
I'll make a person's life crazy for money.

830
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:14,580
The other party's life is taken away by the partner.

831
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:19,580
You're a very bad person to do that.

832
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,580
Don't mess with me.

833
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,580
Do you have evidence?

834
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,580
Where is the evidence I did?

835
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,580
It's here.

836
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,580
What?

837
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,580
OK.

838
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,580
Please sit down.

839
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,580
Let's see something interesting.

840
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,580
Sit down.

841
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:56,580
This is a video of you when you were attacked.

842
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:11,580
I know where this man ran away to.

843
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,580
Narita Airport.

844
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,580
He's German.

845
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:25,580
We had an expert.

846
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,580
I found out through his ears.

847
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:29,580
Ears?

848
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,580
I was surprised too.

849
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,580
You're the same as Shimoya and Hitomi.

850
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:44,580
There's no one in the world who's the same shape.

851
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:46,580
No way.

852
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:51,580
But this man left the country and fled to the Philippines.

853
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:55,580
He fled.

854
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:00,580
Next is the crime of killing Mr. Kiryu.

855
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:06,580
He was caught in the bathroom at Shinjuku Station and was charged 500,000 yen for a night shift.

856
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,580
This man gave him that money.

857
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,580
The ears are the same shape, right?

858
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,580
I don't understand.

859
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,580
What do you want to say?

860
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,580
And the last video.

861
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,580
I found it on Mr. Tamai's social media.

862
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,580
Mr. Shinji Tamai.

863
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,580
He's your brother, right?

864
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,580
The ears are the same shape.

865
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,580
Now you understand, right?

866
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:16,580
Your brother gave the money to Saito and killed Mr. Kiryu.

867
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,580
He attacked you.

868
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:22,580
No, he played a bad act and fled to the Philippines.

869
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:28,580
You planned all this, right, Mr. Tamai?

870
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,580
Mr. Tamai.

871
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,580
The ears are the same shape?

872
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,580
What a stupid thing.

873
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:46,580
Are you really detectives?

874
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:48,580
We're detectives.

875
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:55,580
We collect video footage of the fire and analyze the data of the computer and the killer.

876
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:58,420
SSBC, the

877
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,580
By the way, this is called digital evidence.

878
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:05,580
It's a proof that it doesn't work.

879
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,580
Let's admit it, Mr. Tamai.

880
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:19,580
If you think that you implemented the plan you built for the sake of your brother, it's all true.

881
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:21,580
All.

882
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:26,580
Well, the investigation department will thoroughly examine it.

883
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:31,580
There are scary women over there.

884
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:42,580
It's a pity that you got hurt like that.

885
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,580
Where's Mr. Kisaragi?

886
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,580
He's already gathered.

887
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:50,580
OK.

888
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:52,580
It's good.

889
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:53,580
My show is good today.

890
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:55,580
It's good.

891
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,580
OK, go.

892
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:58,580
See you.

893
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:59,580
Please decide it.

894
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,580
Good morning.

895
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,580
Kawase is not the culprit.

896
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:11,580
What?

897
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:17,580
I will announce the death of Mr. Satoshi Kiryu and the attack of Mr. Ryosuke Tamai.

898
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:37,200
I arrested the

899
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,580
What's wrong?

900
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:43,580
What's wrong?

901
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:44,580
Really?

902
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:45,580
Is it okay?

903
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,580
Excuse me.

904
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:53,580
Well, the person who ordered the attack was Mr. Ryosuke Tamai.

905
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:54,580
Mr. Ryosuke Tamai?

906
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,580
Yes.

907
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,580
Mr. Tamai is not the victim?

908
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,580
That's right.

909
00:47:58,580 --> 00:47:59,580
Did you arrest Mr. Tamai?

910
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,580
Are you a suspect?

911
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:03,580
I'm not a suspect, but I think this is a reference.

912
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,580
Which one?

913
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:05,580
Which one?

914
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,580
What kind of press conference is this?

915
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,580
Please explain, Chief Ichikawa.

916
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:10,580
What does this mean?

917
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,580
Wait a minute.

918
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:14,580
What does this mean?

919
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:15,580
What does this mean, Ikaki?

920
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:20,580
There is data left to pursue Tamai on the phone of Mr. Kiryu.

921
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,580
I also admit Tamai.

922
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,580
Please investigate it later.

923
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,580
Later?

924
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:27,580
Why did you chase Tamai?

925
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:31,580
I told Aoyagi when I was convinced that Tamai was suspicious.

926
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:32,580
Aoyagi?

927
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:35,580
The operation plan of the family was Kawase.

928
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:38,580
There was a chance to report it.

929
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:39,580
I'm not sure.

930
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,580
I was just joking.

931
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,580
That's good.

932
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:44,580
What?

933
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,580
You didn't make a mistake.

934
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:49,580
That's what I think.

935
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:52,580
What's wrong with the operation of SSBC?

936
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,580
You don't know anything yet.

937
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,580
I don't know.

938
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,580
No.

939
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,580
I don't know.

940
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:03,580
I didn't mean to say that.

941
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:09,580
I'm Shunsuke Kuze, the former police chief and the current chief of police.

942
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,580
I understand.

943
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:17,580
I passed the national government official's general office recruitment test and entered the police station.

944
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,580
That's right.

945
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:23,580
Three years later, I will be promoted to the chief of police in the police station.

946
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,580
I will be your superior.

947
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,580
How?

948
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:30,580
Can't we catch the culprit?

949
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,580
It's okay.

950
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:34,580
What?

951
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:36,580
Please catch him.

952
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:37,580
Chief Hetsuka.

953
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,580
Thank you.

954
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:39,580
I'll do my best.

955
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:40,580
Do your best.

956
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,580
I'm sorry.

957
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,580
You're a good carrier.

958
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:51,580
I want to say that.

959
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,580
I'm sorry, Aoyagi.

960
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,580
I said something wrong.

961
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:58,580
I'm sorry, too.

962
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,580
Wait.

963
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:09,580
Give this to Kawase.

964
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:24,580
It's a message on the phone of President Kiryu.

965
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:30,580
I think it was imported just before he was murdered.

966
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,580
I'm sorry.

967
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,580
I was wrong.

968
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:44,580
I doubted you,

969
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,580
and kicked you out of the company.

970
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,580
I was an idiot.

971
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:53,580
I'm sorry, Kawase.

972
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:56,580
I'm really sorry.

973
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,580
If you'll forgive me,

974
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:07,580
would you come back?

975
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:10,580
I'll work with you again.

976
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:12,580
I'm sorry, Mr. Tsuke.

977
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,580
Tsuke.

978
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:35,580
I doubted you.

979
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:37,580
I'm sorry.

980
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:38,580
I'm sorry.

981
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:44,580
I'm glad you're both happy.

982
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,580
The 500,000 yen you borrowed from Yamikin

983
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,580
was for your mother's surgery.

984
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:53,580
The Philippine police arrested Tamae's brother.

985
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:56,580
Thank you for your hard work.

986
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:57,580
Thank you.

987
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,580
I've never seen anything like this.

988
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:01,580
I feel like I've been rewarded.

989
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,580
How should I put it?

990
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:04,580
A sense of fulfillment.

991
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:05,580
A sense of accomplishment?

992
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,580
It's always good to get a medal.

993
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:08,580
It's good.

994
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:13,580
After all, SSBC is the key to criminal investigation in today's world.

995
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:15,580
I'm glad I chose it.

996
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:17,580
What?

997
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,580
This is Arakawa.

998
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:22,580
It's a bomb!

999
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:24,580
A one-year-old building robbery case has been found.

1000
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:25,580
There's only one doctor.

1001
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:26,580
What are you thinking?

1002
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:28,580
I'm going to carry out a terrorist attack.

1003
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,580
Chief Itsuka!

1004
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:30,580
What should we do?

1005
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,580
Where's the bomb?

1006
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:33,580
Could it be that the purpose is...
