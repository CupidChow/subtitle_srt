1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This is the police chief's pride.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's the Gaito-Bohan Camera System.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
About 200 cameras in six places in the city

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
are sending real-time footage here.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's Shibuya now.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Nice to meet you. My name is Gin-Taro Nanami.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Nanami was admitted to the National Public Works and Employment Examination last year

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
by the police.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
No way!

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This is my daughter.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Are you a police chief?

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I was transferred to catch the bad guys.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I see.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
SSBC is the key to criminal investigation in today's world.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm glad I chose it.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
There are over 5 million Gaito-Bohan cameras in Japan.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Nanami!

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Please don't call me Nanami. I'm a new employee.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
No, no, no. That's not it.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
No, really.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What's wrong, Igaki?

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This is Arakawa.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Police Chief's Supporting Investigation Center.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
SSBC is the company that supports all kinds of investigations

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
including collecting, analyzing data on smartphones and computers,

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
profiling of suspects, and so on.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And this time,

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
a special team that supports the investigation team

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
in charge of the criminal investigation, such as murder, robbery, and fire,

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
has been established.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Its name is SSBC.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The Police Chief's Supporting Investigation Center

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What's the result of the face-catching investigation?

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I can see that it's him.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Arakawa Taizo.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Born in 1985 in Ishikawa,

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
he graduated from Kyoto University of Law.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
He completed his degree in Law at the same university

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and got his bachelor's degree.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He continued his post-doctoral studies at the university,

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
but he didn't get a stable position.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He left the company in 2016

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and then started working part-time.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
He even got a job after he was killed.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's not unusual.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's a tough situation.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Arakawa committed the murder on May 2, 2019.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
He set up an explosive device

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
in front of Kasumi Gasegi's station.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
He killed one person,

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and five people were shot.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Right after that,

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
he posted a criminal name on social media.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He's a typical Longfender.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Longfender?

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
A terrorist who belongs to a certain organization.

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I was in the investigation department at the time,

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
so I remember this case well.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Hey, Yaki.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Watch your words.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll be careful.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Nanami is a career group.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Don't worry.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yaki is my instructor.

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That's what I meant.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll go on.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Me?

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The criminal name was used by several servers,

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
but SSBC followed up on it

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and found the source of the information.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But when we stepped in...

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Arakawa!

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yaki!

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He's already escaped.

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Damn it.

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So the criminal name was used as evidence.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'll contact the base to search for it.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
SSBC, go get the video of the bomb.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Go?

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yaki, go.

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What about you, Yaki?

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes, sir.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay.

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Arakawa's body is 178 cm tall,

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
medium-sized,

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
khaki shirt,

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
khaki pants,

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and white sneakers.

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Headquarters, 2nd floor, from floor 204.

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We're on alert for the fifth-floor area.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We haven't found Arakawa yet,

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
but we'll continue our patrol.

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Headquarters, 2nd floor.

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We can't do anything about it.

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He might have a bomb.

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
My daughter won't listen to me.

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay.

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm here.

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Let's ask around.

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Excuse me.

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yes?

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Do you have a Dora Leko?

107
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Dora Leko?

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yes.

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Did something happen?

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Well, a little.

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Okay.

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Here.

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Thank you.

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay.

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's go.

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Okay.

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What?

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Huh?

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Huh?

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Huh?

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
This is the apartment.

122
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah.

123
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It looks like a ninja.

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's Arakawa.

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Arakawa?

126
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Excuse me.

127
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's that room.

128
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
10 43.

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
30 minutes ago.

130
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Okay.

131
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'll report to the family.

132
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The criminal is right in front of us.

133
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Nanami, we're not...

134
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Kin!

135
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Huh?

136
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Let's go.

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Let's go.

138
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The SSBC is huge.

139
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Huh?

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Nanami, wait a minute.

141
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You're doing all sorts of stupid things.

142
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Nanami, I'm sorry.

143
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'd like to ask you something.

144
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Captain Tanaka...

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Stop!

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
There's an explosion.

147
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Huh?

148
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Nanami, back down.

149
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's an explosion!

150
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Back down!

151
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Back down!

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Tanaka!

153
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Wait a minute!

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yes!

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Arakawa!

156
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Wait!

157
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
SSBC!

158
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What's wrong?

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Oh, oh, oh!

160
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Follow that bike!

161
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Huh?

162
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Hurry!

163
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Why is the SSBC?

164
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Hurry up!

165
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Okay!

166
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Hurry!

167
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Hurry!

168
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Hurry!

169
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh!

170
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Oh!

171
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Arakawa!

172
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Wait!

173
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Arakawa!

174
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Wait!

175
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Wait!

176
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Wait!

177
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Wait!

178
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Wait!

179
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Oh!

180
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Arakawa!

181
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Open up!

182
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
There's an explosion.

183
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Don't make a fuss.

184
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Don't make a fuss.

185
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Don't make a fuss.

186
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Don't make a fuss.

187
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Don't come!

188
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm going to blow up this old man!

189
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Old man?

190
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Tatekomori...

191
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Contact the headquarters!

192
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yes!

193
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,680
Tatekomori has been found in the 10th

194
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,000
Kameido Printing Factory in Koutou.

195
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The culprit is the one who blew up the building.

196
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The culprit is the one who blew up the building.

197
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Ms. Tsuyo, do you know who's behind this?

198
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I don't know yet.

199
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Get out of the way!

200
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Get out of the way!

201
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Get out of the way!

202
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Get out of the way!

203
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Get out of the way!

204
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What's going on?

205
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Why did the SSBC do something so stupid?

206
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm sorry.

207
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's not like that.

208
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You did something unnecessary,

209
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
so it's Tatekomori time.

210
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm sorry.

211
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What's with that attitude?

212
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Are you really relieved?

213
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's me.

214
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm the one who called Arakawa.

215
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What is it?

216
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
He's not a fool.

217
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm sorry.

218
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Please raise your head.

219
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Mr. Nanami.

220
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Nanami?

221
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Who?

222
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
If you're going to fight, I'll...

223
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You can't say that.

224
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I understand. I won't say anything.

225
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Ikegaki, go home.

226
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yes.

227
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'll get in the way.

228
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What?

229
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Let's go.

230
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes.

231
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What's with that Ibu?

232
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Ikegaki and Aoyaki are colleagues?

233
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Colleagues?

234
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
No.

235
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
They don't have any complaints.

236
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm older than him.

237
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He's just being arrogant.

238
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Nanami.

239
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yes.

240
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
If you hadn't asked Arakawa,

241
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
this wouldn't have happened.

242
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm sorry.

243
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I still don't know much about SSBC.

244
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Really?

245
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yes.

246
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You said you were glad you chose SSBC.

247
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Me?

248
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I didn't.

249
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You wanted to be a pirate yourself?

250
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I was just told by Jinji.

251
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Really?

252
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Jinji!

253
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
A woman...

254
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
A woman?

255
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
She came out of that room.

256
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I feel like I'm going shopping.

257
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Was there a woman in Arakawa?

258
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Let's look into Arakawa's room.

259
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What?

260
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
We need evidence of the bomb.

261
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You said that and you know about SSBC?

262
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
We're big, aren't we?

263
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
We don't even have a ceiling.

264
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's a secret hideout.

265
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Who's the secret hideout?

266
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You're the secret hideout?

267
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You're the secret hideout?

268
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
We don't even have a ceiling.

269
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's a secret hideout.

270
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That's why...

271
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You were a regretful kid six years ago.

272
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Are you okay?

273
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Arakawa is stuck in that room.

274
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You want to see his room, don't you?

275
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You don't want to?

276
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The person who's in the room is Hoshi no Yukari.

277
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Hoshi no Yukari?

278
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Tell me his phone number.

279
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yes.

280
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Hoshi no Yukari is in the same room as Arakawa.

281
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
He's a secret hideout.

282
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Hoshi no Yukari is a secret hideout.

283
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Hoshi no Yukari is a secret hideout.

284
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Hoshi no Yukari is a secret hideout.

285
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Did he know Arakawa was a secret hideout?

286
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Hoshi no Yukari is a secret hideout.

287
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What's this?

288
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
He made a bomb here.

289
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So he knew Arakawa was a secret hideout.

290
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
He ran away thinking he'd get caught.

291
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
July 14th.

292
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Today.

293
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What does it mean?

294
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's a wedding day.

295
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
A wedding?

296
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
He's not moving.

297
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm not calling.

298
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Keep calling.

299
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Chief Ichika, SIT has arrived.

300
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Hey, Sergeant Sanohan.

301
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
How's it going?

302
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I don't know.

303
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Arakawa isn't answering his phone.

304
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The Tatekomori squad will definitely come to ask for something.

305
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Shut up!

306
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's off.

307
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's off?

308
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It seems the phone is taken out.

309
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What?

310
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Why would you do that?

311
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
There's nowhere to run.

312
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What?

313
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Listen carefully.

314
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Arakawa has a girlfriend.

315
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What do you want me to do?

316
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I should have asked.

317
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Then we have no choice but to catch him.

318
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You're saying that again.

319
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
We're the only ones here.

320
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yukari Hoshino?

321
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yes.

322
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Hoshizora's Hoshiri Nohara.

323
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yukari is Hiragana.

324
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'll send you the numbers on the data.

325
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And your phone number.

326
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Are you chasing this woman?

327
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
They're a couple.

328
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
If we catch Yukari Hoshino and convince him,

329
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
we might be able to get Arakawa to report.

330
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Understood.

331
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Then please follow Yukari Hoshino.

332
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Let's go.

333
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Roger.

334
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Is it okay, Chief?

335
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
We're moving on our own.

336
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
This is a separate room that was built by SSBC.

337
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We have to find a way to get out of this room.

338
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
A way?

339
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Okay.

340
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Oya Mada and Joe, go to the medical team.

341
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yes, sir.

342
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Understood.

343
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Kizawa, please follow Yukari Hoshino with the location information on your phone.

344
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Roger.

345
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Mitsumoto and Nishina, please give me the data on her.

346
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Understood.

347
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'll look into it.

348
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The person in the back is a 40-year-old Arakawa body-drawer who was killed in the Kasumigaseki bomb terror incident.

349
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The person in the back is a 71-year-old Oiso officer.

350
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
He's 71 years old.

351
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's Oiso.

352
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Arakawa.

353
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Give me the camera.

354
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's Arakawa.

355
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What does he want to do?

356
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
We can't let him in.

357
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Let him in.

358
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
He's got a bomb.

359
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'll control him before I touch the bomb.

360
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Can you do it?

361
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
That's why we're training hard every day.

362
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Chief Ichikawa.

363
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Order to enter.

364
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Make your decision.

365
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I got it.

366
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'll enter.

367
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Chief Ichikawa.

368
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What?

369
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
We have a call from the Kusei Prefectural Governor.

370
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
What?

371
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Kusei Prefectural Governor?

372
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Stop.

373
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Hello.

374
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
This is the Yagesh.

375
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Yes, this is Kusei.

376
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I asked the police officer about the incident.

377
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What's the situation at the scene?

378
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yes, we're about to enter.

379
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Enter?

380
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I see.

381
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
What about the hostage?

382
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yes?

383
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
If anything happens to the hostage,

384
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
it's all your responsibility.

385
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That's right.

386
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I understand.

387
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Excuse me.

388
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
What about the officer?

389
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
The hostage's life is at stake.

390
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
If Arakawa explodes the bomb, it'll be a disaster.

391
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
What about the rush?

392
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
No rush.

393
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Chief Ichikawa.

394
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What?

395
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The hostage's doctor has a disease of inoculation.

396
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What?

397
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
He's going to die if he gets infected.

398
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Are you going to keep the bomb going for a whole day?

399
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Show me the hostage.

400
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Show me the hostage.

401
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm exhausted.

402
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Chief Ichikawa.

403
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
What should we do?

404
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Yukari Hoshino is 35 years old.

405
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
She's from Okayama.

406
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
She's a high school student.

407
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Her club is the Rikujo Club.

408
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
After graduating high school,

409
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
she went to a job-hunting school and got a job at an apparel company.

410
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
She quit after eight years of worrying about her relationship with the company.

411
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What's the connection with Arakawa?

412
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Where did they meet?

413
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Ikari.

414
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The person who looks like Yukari Hoshino

415
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
was seen in the green cover of Sumida-ku.

416
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
A khaki-colored blouse and blue pants.

417
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
A beige bucket hat-shaped helmet.

418
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
A red bicycle.

419
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
What's in the basket is probably an eco bag.

420
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
From the position of the camera,

421
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
she's running towards Route 14 west.

422
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Route 14 west.

423
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Sumida-ku, across Ryogoku Bridge.

424
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The area is a very remote area.

425
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
If you cross the Ryogoku Bridge and cross the Sumida River,

426
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
you'll reach the Chiyoku River.

427
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Where is she headed?

428
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Ginza?

429
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Have you confirmed the location of Yukari Hoshino's smartphone?

430
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's powering off, so I can't pick up the phone.

431
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yukari Hoshino knew Arakawa's identity and lived with her.

432
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
That's how strong their bond was.

433
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And yet, she's the only one who's running away.

434
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
What's bothering you?

435
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
What's the point of running away?

436
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Could it be that her purpose is...

437
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Purpose?

438
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
July 14th.

439
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Today.

440
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Some kind of wedding day.

441
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
An eco bag?

442
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
An eco bag?

443
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Zoom in.

444
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Yes.

445
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Something's in here.

446
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Arakawa.

447
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
No, Arakawa.

448
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
The doctor there is running a business.

449
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
If you have a heart,

450
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
could you buy me a doctor?

451
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Please.

452
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It can't be helped.

453
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That bastard.

454
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It'll only take time.

455
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
That old man...

456
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Please let him in.

457
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I said don't let him in!

458
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I said don't let him in!

459
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
What's he thinking?

460
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm sorry.

461
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Don't call me again.

462
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Get Arakawa ready.

463
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What?

464
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
He's going to use terror as a means of protection.

465
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Terror?

466
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
What?

467
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Ask him where the woman is headed.

468
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Wait, explain it to me.

469
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What's terror?

470
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The doctor at the health center.

471
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's me. What's terror?

472
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Chief, Arakawa doesn't have a bomb.

473
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
The bomb is from a woman named Yukari Hoshino.

474
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
What?

475
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm Nanami.

476
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Hello, Nanami.

477
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Arakawa had Plan B.

478
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Plan A is to use terror.

479
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Plan B is to use it against Yukari Hoshino.

480
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Plan B is in progress.

481
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
In progress?

482
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Arakawa is hiding to save time.

483
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Save time?

484
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Get Arakawa ready.

485
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
But he has a bomb.

486
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So Yukari Hoshino has the bomb.

487
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Are you sure? Where did you get that information?

488
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Mr. Igaki's theory.

489
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You can't believe that.

490
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And the chief of the police is the first person to die.

491
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
The situation has changed.

492
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Mr. Iaigashi.

493
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Yes?

494
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
The former police chief, the current chief of the police, Kusei Shunsuke, is my uncle.

495
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I know him.

496
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And I passed the national public official's general office recruitment test and entered the police department.

497
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I understand.

498
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Three years later, I will be promoted to the chief of police, which means your superior.

499
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
How do you mean?

500
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Please secure Arakawa.

501
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I understand.

502
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Hurry up.

503
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Hurry up.

504
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Let's get in.

505
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Let's get in.

506
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yes, sir.

507
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Let's get in.

508
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Let's go.

509
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Don't come.

510
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Don't come.

511
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Don't come.

512
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Don't come.

513
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
School.

514
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
School.

515
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Mr. Oisa, are you okay?

516
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yes.

517
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm fine.

518
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Where is he?

519
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
There is no explosive.

520
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You bastard.

521
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
What should we do?

522
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Where do you think you can put the bomb?

523
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It's too late.

524
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's too late, you bastard.

525
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Say it.

526
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Those who look down on me,

527
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
look at me.

528
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Look at me.

529
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
You bastard.

530
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Hey, hey.

531
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Where is the bomb?

532
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Where is the bomb?

533
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Three.

534
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Where is it?

535
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
One.

536
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Where is it?

537
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Where is it?

538
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Take it.

539
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Stop it.

540
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Go away.

541
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Don't touch me.

542
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Don't touch the camera.

543
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Tai-chan.

544
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Yukari Hoshino.

545
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I got a call.

546
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Thank you.

547
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I got a call from Yukari Hoshino.

548
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
The base station is Takanawa Port.

549
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Takanawa.

550
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
He came all the way here.

551
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
He came all the way here.

552
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Yes, I'm Kuzuhara.

553
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
There was no bomb in Arakawa.

554
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And I don't know where the woman is.

555
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Yukari Hoshino is in Takanawa.

556
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Takanawa?

557
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
There is a embassy, a public building, a university, and a big hotel in this area.

558
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
How many places are there that are the target of terrorism?

559
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
How do you find it?

560
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Yukari Hoshino is moving by bicycle.

561
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Let's use the bicycle station.

562
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Bicycle station?

563
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
It's a tool that SSBC is good at.

564
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Kizaku.

565
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Leave it to me.

566
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
First, the frame.

567
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
With the double S frame.

568
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Aluminum type.

569
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
The manufacturer is Moneko.

570
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
The handle is.

571
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Semi-up handle.

572
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
That's great.

573
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
He's always looking at the bicycle catalog.

574
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
There are about 50 million bicycles in Japan now.

575
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
It seems that these bicycles are basically made of 12 parts.

576
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Let's see it here.

577
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Frame.

578
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Handle.

579
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Bell.

580
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Front basket.

581
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Head lamp.

582
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Saddle.

583
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Chain cover.

584
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Rear carrier.

585
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Dress guard.

586
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Stand.

587
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Transmitting device.

588
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Side reflector.

589
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
The vehicle type is determined from these parts.

590
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Furthermore, the characteristics of the individual are found from the bicycle that is reflected in the square.

591
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
For example.

592
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
This.

593
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
The reflection sticker that you think you put on yourself.

594
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I see.

595
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And the other one.

596
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Well.

597
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
There is a dent here.

598
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm looking for one of the 50 million bicycles.

599
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
The bicycle montage is done.

600
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Moneko Cycle 22-year model.

601
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
The color is Signal Red.

602
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
The characteristic of the individual is the white reflection sticker on the chain stay of the frame.

603
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
The dent on the front basket.

604
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Red and white wheel reflector.

605
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Ah, Ichika-chan.

606
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I'm sending you the data now.

607
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
From here on, it's a man-made war.

608
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I know.

609
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Around the Takanawa heavyweight division.

610
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Interrogation of the 3rd division radio.

611
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Please start immediately.

612
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Hey.

613
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Stop sending me messages that are less than SSBC.

614
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Chief Kuzuhara.

615
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
In the Takanawa area.

616
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
There are related to Arakawa.

617
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
For example.

618
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Please check if there is no event.

619
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
An event?

620
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Arakawa.

621
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
The Arakawa said they would kill me if they saw me.

622
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
His motive is not revolutionary.

623
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
It's a personal grudge against someone.

624
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Please.

625
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Takanawa.

626
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Yes.

627
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It's not red.

628
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
This is not it.

629
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
The general public meeting of the Luberta Embassy.

630
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
This is the weekend.

631
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
The student group meeting to consider the earth environment at the Mekyo University for the next two days.

632
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
There is an event related to the Mo-ka Prize at the Teio Hotel.

633
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Let's check if there is anything related to Arakawa.

634
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Yes.

635
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It's different.

636
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Iyaki-san.

637
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
The maker and the photo are the same.

638
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
The wheel reflectors are the same.

639
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
There is a reflection sticker here.

640
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Let's put it on the front basket.

641
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
There is none.

642
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
This is it.

643
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I found it.

644
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Yukari Hoshi left his bicycle here.

645
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Nanami.

646
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Yukari Hoshi.

647
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Yukari Hoshi.

648
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Thank you.

649
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Hoshido-san.

650
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
You are Yukari Hoshi, right?

651
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Yes.

652
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I'm Iyaki, the chief of police.

653
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I'm Nanami.

654
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
You brought a bomb from your home.

655
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It's a bomb made by the Arakawa colonel.

656
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I'm sorry.

657
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Yes.

658
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
There is a meeting of the General Physics and Science at the Takanawa International Hall.

659
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
The General Physics and Science Meeting.

660
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Yes.

661
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
The chairman is Koichiro Matsuyama, a professor at Kyoto University of the Arts.

662
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Kyoto University of the Arts?

663
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
He is from Arakawa.

664
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Where is the bomb?

665
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Did you set it up?

666
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Where did you set it up?

667
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I got it!

668
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Koichiro Matsuyama, a professor at the Faculty of Physics and Science at the University of the Arts, Kyoto University of the Arts, until 2018.

669
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Faculty of Physics and Science?

670
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
It's where Arakawa was residing.

671
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
The seasons are over.

672
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
The Takanawa International Hall?

673
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
The General Physics and Science Meeting is a target of terrorism.

674
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
What is the basis?

675
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
The chairman of the faculty, Koichiro Matsuyama, was a professor at Kyoto University of the Arts, Arakawa.

676
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:01,000
In 2016, he was recommended as a member of the IT joint development program at Asheville University of the Arts.

677
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Three of his students were recommended.

678
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
But Arakawa was not among them.

679
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
After that, Arakawa quit the university.

680
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
But there was no plan to hire him as a student.

681
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
So the discussion with Professor Matsuyama led to Arakawa's disappearance?

682
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
If that's what he thinks, then Arakawa is the reason why he hates Professor Matsuyama.

683
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
A bomb in Takanawa International Hall?

684
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
The meeting is at 6 p.m.

685
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
6 p.m.?

686
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
12 minutes left.

687
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Where did Arakawa say to set up the bomb?

688
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Tell me, Hoshino-san.

689
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Is the manager here?

690
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Yes, he's here.

691
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Okay, everyone, get ready.

692
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Yes, sir.

693
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Everyone inside, get ready.

694
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Yes, sir.

695
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Takanawa International Hall.

696
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
The meeting that will start there today is a target.

697
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Takanawa International Hall.

698
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
But...

699
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
The bomb is not found.

700
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
The manager should be punished.

701
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Is he really trapped here?

702
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Hurry up!

703
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
What?

704
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
A bomb?

705
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
If you touch it, it will explode.

706
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Everyone, get out!

707
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It's the police!

708
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Get out of here!

709
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Please help!

710
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Everyone, get out!

711
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
What happened?

712
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
There's a bomb.

713
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Everyone, get out of here!

714
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Hurry up!

715
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
There's a bomb!

716
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Hurry up!

717
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Please stop Taiman.

718
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
If the police have to run away, I don't care.

719
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
What are you thinking?

720
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Are you going to die here?

721
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Taizou Arakawa has been caught.

722
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I saw it on the internet.

723
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You're at your deathbed.

724
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
What's the point of doing this?

725
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Stop Taiman.

726
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Hoshino-san.

727
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It was last April.

728
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
What?

729
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I met Tai-chan.

730
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
What are you talking about?

731
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I worked at a lunch box store near the city.

732
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
He was there as a customer.

733
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Hoshino-san.

734
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
He always bought fried rice and milk.

735
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I ordered it in a shy way.

736
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
One day, I was leaving the station early.

737
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
He was giving milk to the stray cat.

738
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Thank you.

739
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Here, drink it.

740
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You're welcome.

741
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
You're not a rich person.

742
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I thought he was a good person.

743
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Do you understand?

744
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Yes, I understand.

745
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
He's not a good person.

746
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
We'll talk about that later.

747
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Let's stop Taiman.

748
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Let's go.

749
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
The salary of a non-scientific researcher is low.

750
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It's not limited to your field of expertise.

751
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:49,000
He was complaining about what he was doing while he was in college.

752
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I decided to support Tai-chan.

753
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
That's why you started living together.

754
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
We'll talk about that later.

755
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Please stop Taiman.

756
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I loved Tai-chan.

757
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I understand.

758
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
But he was a criminal.

759
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
He opened up to me.

760
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
This world is strange.

761
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Nobody is serious about society.

762
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Everyone thinks it's natural.

763
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I can't stand it.

764
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I can't stand it.

765
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I want to change the world.

766
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Tai-chan.

767
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Did you sympathize with him?

768
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I wanted to understand him.

769
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
But that's a bomb terror.

770
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,000
He started making bombs in your room.

771
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Yes.

772
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Did you think it was okay for many people to die or get injured?

773
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I don't think I could accept it as reality.

774
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
So...

775
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
There's a bomb in there.

776
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It's a bomb!

777
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Don't go down!

778
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,000
At that time, I was prepared for something.

779
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
This happiness will never last.

780
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I'm sure it will.

781
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
It will come to an end.

782
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
What I can do at the end...

783
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,000
is to make his feelings come true.

784
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
But you didn't start the bomb.

785
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Why?

786
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Because I saw it.

787
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
You saw it?

788
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Say it!

789
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Those who looked down on me...

790
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
They're all dead!

791
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Where's the bomb?

792
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Stop!

793
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Stop!

794
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Don't call me!

795
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
This is...

796
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Isn't this the Taichun I know?

797
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
There was no political support for Arakawa.

798
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
It was just a personal revenge.

799
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I tried to make you do it.

800
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
You were used.

801
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Hoshino-san.

802
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
You're in despair right now.

803
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I don't think it's right to end everything.

804
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Those tears are regretful.

805
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
We can still fight the regrets.

806
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
We can't face the future.

807
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
It's over.

808
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
It's over.

809
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It's over.

810
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It's over.

811
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
It's over.

812
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
You didn't find it?

813
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
We didn't find the bomb.

814
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I think the SSBC's information is wrong.

815
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
No, it can't be.

816
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Was it really a terrorist plan?

817
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
What's going on?

818
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Yes.

819
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
It's from Igaki.

820
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Igaki?

821
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
What's going on? Where's the bomb?

822
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I recovered the bomb.

823
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I've secured Hoshino-san's body.

824
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
The bomb was recovered.

825
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Recovered?

826
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Where's the bomb?

827
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
We arrested Hoshino Yukari, 35 years old.

828
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:12,000
We tried to set up a bomb in the Takanawa International Hall,

829
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
but we were able to prevent the terrorist attack by the SSBC's investigation.

830
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Chief Ichikawa.

831
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Yes.

832
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Who was chasing Hoshino Yukari?

833
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Yes?

834
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
The investigation team was stuck at the site.

835
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Yes, but the investigation was going on in secret.

836
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
The SSBC was the one who secured Hoshino Yukari.

837
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
It wasn't the SSBC?

838
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,000
The SSBC has a special version of the SSBC's bomb.

839
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It's a bomb, so it's the SSBC's body.

840
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
What's going on?

841
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I don't know.

842
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Is Nanami-san the one who secured the bomb?

843
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Is she?

844
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Chief Ichikawa, you were very careful.

845
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Is the one who secured the bomb better than the SSBC?

846
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
That's not true.

847
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
That's enough.

848
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Is that Yagami-san?

849
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Yes, that's him.

850
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Run!

851
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
This is delicious.

852
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Sweet potatoes are in it.

853
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Kumamoto specialty, sweet potatoes.

854
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Rumi-chan's parents sent them.

855
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Was Nishina-san from Kumamoto?

856
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Yes.

857
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Why is it called sweet potatoes?

858
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It means it's easy and simple.

859
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
It's easy to make for an urgent customer.

860
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
That's why it's called sweet potatoes.

861
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Yes.

862
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Are you eating?

863
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Yes.

864
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
What is it?

865
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I feel like I'm being rolled over by this guy.

866
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
You're saying weird things again.

867
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
You're not educated.

868
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
That's right.

869
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Please eat the sweet potatoes.

870
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I'm eating.

871
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
He was attacked by a stun gun and his left foot was stolen.

872
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
He is considered a criminal by the German police.

873
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
What if another victim comes out?

874
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Let's do it ourselves.

875
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
We have to make him admit that he was shot 48 hours ago.

876
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I'll catch the criminal.

877
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Don't think you can escape.
