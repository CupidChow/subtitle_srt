00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 2

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,800
We only hired Nanami and Kashiwagi.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,200
I can't believe the two top players are out.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,000
The president is still complaining.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,700
Kashiwagi is different from me.

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,600
He's independent and has his own way of doing things.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,500
He's amazing.

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,100
He's not that special.

9
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,300
No, no. He's a real rich kid.

10
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,400
How much did he make in the last six months?

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,400
That's not what we're talking about today.

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,700
It's Nanami.

13
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,400
The real estate agent is now a police officer.

14
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:30,900
Huh?

15
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,400
Huh?

16
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,200
Huh? Huh?

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,000
Huh?

18
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,200
Ah!

19
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm still a low-level criminal.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,800
I'm still running around the scene.

21
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,600
I'm talking about you.

22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,400
You'll get the result and get out of jail.

23
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,500
I'm not here to get out of jail.

24
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,600
What are you saying?

25
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,600
Go where you can.

26
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm expecting you.

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,200
Oh, you're sending an A to your former rival.

28
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,000
My rival?

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,800
I didn't think that.

30
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,000
When Nanami quit his job,

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Kashiwagi was missing Genta.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That means he's lost his rival.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,100
That's right.

34
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,000
He's capable of this.

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,600
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,800
What's wrong?

37
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,400
Hey.

38
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,800
Ah!

39
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,200
Nanami.

40
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,200
Nanami.

41
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,000
Nanami.

42
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hey.

43
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Nanami.

44
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Nanami.

45
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,400
Sir.

46
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,200
Police Agency.

47
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,000
Investigative Support Analysis Center.

48
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,600
S.S.B.C.

49
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,300
Collecting and analyzing video footage.

50
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,500
Data analysis of smartphones and computers.

51
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,000
Profiling of suspects.

52
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,300
The department supports all investigations.

53
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,100
And this time,

54
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,100
the investigation team that handles

55
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,300
murder, robbery, and robbery,

56
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,300
has been selected to support the special investigation.

57
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,500
The name is

58
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,700
S.S.B.C.

59
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,900
S.S.B.C. Confiscated.

60
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,900
Thank you for your hard work.

61
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,900
Thank you.

62
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,900
S.S.B.C. Confiscated.

63
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,900
A month's worth of heart.

64
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,300
What do you see?

65
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,100
Yes.

66
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,700
Do you have a wallet or a license?

67
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,300
I can't see my phone either.

68
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,500
These gloves.

69
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,500
I thought it was the driver of that car.

70
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,300
The memory card was stolen.

71
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,300
The culprit took it out.

72
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,300
He stopped the car here,

73
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,300
chased the driver who was running away,

74
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,300
and stabbed him there.

75
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,300
Is it a robbery for you to have no wallet?

76
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,300
That's what we, the Ikka, are thinking about,

77
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,300
so S.S.B.C. is...

78
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,300
I'll look for the video.

79
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,300
I understand.

80
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,300
Let's go.

81
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,300
Yes.

82
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,300
You too.

83
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,300
Yes.

84
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,300
The car was a car of the president

85
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,300
who was arrested for the theft of the car.

86
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,300
When we checked the company,

87
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,300
the driver of the car was

88
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,300
the driver of the car, Moroboshi Katsuya.

89
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,300
His name is Tomita Hideaki, 53 years old.

90
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,300
What about the video?

91
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,300
We found only one video of S.S.B.C.

92
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,300
This is it.

93
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,300
The culprit is probably a man.

94
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,300
We don't know anything else.

95
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,300
You don't know?

96
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,300
Just this?

97
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,300
Yes.

98
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,300
Just this?

99
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,300
Yes.

100
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,300
I'm really not used to it.

101
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,300
I'm sorry.

102
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,300
Chief Ichikawa,

103
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,300
there is one thing that doesn't fall into the sea.

104
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,300
What is it?

105
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,300
Tomita-san was sent to Haneda

106
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,300
by Moroboshi, the president of overseas business,

107
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,300
last night,

108
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,300
and was attacked after that.

109
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,300
However,

110
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,300
the scene of the incident is not the way from Haneda

111
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,300
to the company,

112
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,300
but the route to the president's home.

113
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,300
What does that mean?

114
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,300
To say that the vice president of the Moroboshi security department,

115
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,300
was Tomita-san,

116
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,300
was he mistaken?

117
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,300
Misunderstood?

118
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,300
Misunderstood?

119
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,300
Tomita is sent to the president's home every day.

120
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,300
Last night,

121
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,300
I thought he was on the president's car.

122
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,300
You just sent it to Haneda.

123
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,300
No.

124
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,300
Well...

125
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,300
I'm sorry.

126
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,300
I'm sorry.

127
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,300
I was so upset when I heard that Tomita had died.

128
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,300
I felt that the vice president of Araki-dani was a little strange.

129
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,300
That's suspicious.

130
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,300
Ask more.

131
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,300
Yes.

132
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,300
Don't think that the SSBC has finished its work.

133
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,300
Find out more thoroughly if the video of the fire escape is missing.

134
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,300
Understood.

135
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,300
Do it thoroughly.

136
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,300
Understood.

137
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,300
What's so strange?

138
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,300
I always feel bad when I hear that I was threatened.

139
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,300
I feel refreshed today.

140
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,300
Where is Nanami?

141
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,300
Huh?

142
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,300
Nanami!

143
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,300
You're not here.

144
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,300
Nanami is in the hospital.

145
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,300
He was sent to the emergency room last night.

146
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,300
Why?

147
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,300
I don't want the vice president to be here.

148
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,300
Please sleep, Nanami.

149
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,300
I'm fine.

150
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,300
I heard that Nanami was attacked by the emergency room.

151
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,300
I came here without saying a word.

152
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,300
It's natural to have a vice president in the future.

153
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,300
I'm sorry.

154
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,300
The surgery was successful.

155
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,300
I'm glad.

156
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,300
This is a fruit basket.

157
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,300
I'll put it here.

158
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,300
You're so considerate.

159
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,300
This is a jasmine flower.

160
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,300
I'll leave the flower words with you.

161
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,300
I'll leave it here.

162
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,300
Do you have a vase?

163
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,300
I'll ask the nurse.

164
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,300
I'll leave this here.

165
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,300
Thank you.

166
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,300
You must be busy, Chief Ichi.

167
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,300
I just have one murder case.

168
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,300
Murder?

169
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,300
I've started the investigation.

170
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,300
I'll start the SSBC.

171
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,300
Don't worry.

172
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,300
I'm sorry for the trouble.

173
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,300
What are you doing?

174
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,300
Take a rest.

175
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,300
You look good in anything.

176
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,300
You look great.

177
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,300
Yesterday, there was a theft case in a house in Seijyo,

178
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,300
which is a big city in the Aoyama area of Minato Prefecture.

179
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,300
A theft case?

180
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,300
The jewelry store was closed.

181
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,300
The back door was broken and someone broke in.

182
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,300
The people who stole the precious metals from the 8,000 yen bill were taken.

183
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,300
The house in Seijyo was broken through the window of the living room.

184
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,300
The national clock and cash were stolen.

185
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,300
The whole house was destroyed.

186
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,300
The police were arrested.

187
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,300
The police were arrested.

188
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,300
The police stole the national watch and cash,

189
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,300
and the total sum of 15 million yen.

190
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,300
The police were sleeping on the second floor of the junior high school in a big house.

191
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,300
Is that related to us?

192
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,300
We're a group of people.

193
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,300
If it's a theft case, the SSBC will be responsible.

194
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,300
Neither of them have a video of the fire.

195
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,300
They don't have a video?

196
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,300
It's a video of the fire at the jewelry store.

197
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,300
Originally, the video for a week should be saved,

198
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,300
but at 0 am...

199
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,300
It disappeared.

200
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,300
And...

201
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,300
4 am...

202
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,300
It's back.

203
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,300
It was destroyed during this time.

204
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,300
And the security company that this store was contract with was the Moroboshi Security Insurance.

205
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,300
Moroboshi Security Insurance?

206
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,300
Moreover, the house in Seijyo was also contracted with the Moroboshi Security Insurance.

207
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,300
What?

208
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,300
There too.

209
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,300
During the time from 0 am to 4 am when someone broke in,

210
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,300
there was no sign of anything in the fire alarm.

211
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,300
Tomita-san was murdered last night.

212
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,300
He was the driver of the Moroboshi Security Insurance.

213
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,300
And the next night,

214
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,300
the Moroboshi Security Insurance security system was not working in Aoyama and Seijyo.

215
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,300
The gold bottle was stolen.

216
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,300
I don't think it's a coincidence.

217
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,300
It has something to do with it.

218
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,300
What kind of relationship?

219
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,300
It's a family business to investigate that.

220
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,300
I know that even without you telling me.

221
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,300
Then investigate it quickly.

222
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,300
Shut up.

223
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,300
I'm really sorry.

224
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,300
I don't think our security system had any errors.

225
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,300
Errors?

226
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,300
We're still investigating the cause.

227
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,300
Is this common?

228
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,300
It's ridiculous.

229
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,300
It's the first time.

230
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,300
There were only two errors in Aoyama and Seijyo last night?

231
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,300
That's right.

232
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,300
There was a thief there by chance?

233
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,300
That's what it is.

234
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,300
Inaba-san is responsible for the security system, right?

235
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,300
Yes.

236
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:54,300
Last night, this driver, Tomita Hideaki-san, was murdered.

237
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:00,300
Do you think this system error has anything to do with it?

238
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,300
I don't know.

239
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,300
I'm really sorry.

240
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,300
Is he hiding something?

241
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,300
Like the vice president,

242
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,300
he may be involved in a company gang including a murder case.

243
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,300
A company gang?

244
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,300
Call the vice president. I'll ask him directly.

245
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,300
Araki-dani-san.

246
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,300
Yes.

247
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:38,300
It's strange to think that there was a thief in the two cases where the security system was not working.

248
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,300
The system error was actually more than 10 cases.

249
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,300
What?

250
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,300
The person in charge of the two cases was wrong.

251
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,300
More than 10 cases.

252
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,300
That's a big problem.

253
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,300
I'm really sorry.

254
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,300
Araki-dani-san.

255
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,300
Yes.

256
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,300
Isn't the case connected to the criminal?

257
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,300
What?

258
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,300
This is a crime that was helped.

259
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,300
That's not true.

260
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,300
Really.

261
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,300
The fact that Tomita-san was murdered is actually related to the criminal.

262
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,300
No.

263
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,300
What's the difference, Araki-dani-san?

264
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,300
Are you hiding something?

265
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,300
Listen.

266
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,300
The chief of police, Masao Yaegashi, is being watched.

267
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,300
Tell me the truth.

268
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,300
Tell me, Araki-dani.

269
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,300
The president...

270
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,300
What about the president?

271
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,300
The president of Moroboshi...

272
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,300
was kidnapped.

273
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,300
What?

274
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,300
Kidnapped?

275
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,300
Are you serious?

276
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,300
I'm bored.

277
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,300
Nanami.

278
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,300
Kashiwagi?

279
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,300
He came to see you?

280
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,300
He came to see me?

281
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,300
He's a police officer, but he's also a chief of police.

282
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,300
I said I could stay in the big room.

283
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,300
Criminal psychology, 2025.

284
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,300
The FBI's original report finally came out in Japanese.

285
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,300
Can't you leave?

286
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,300
What?

287
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,300
You're not a chief of police, right?

288
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,300
Don't be so spoiled. Get back to work.

289
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,300
I want to, but not yet.

290
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,300
When I heard you were transferred to the police, I was so excited.

291
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,300
I can compete again.

292
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,300
Compete?

293
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,300
Tell the doctor you're going to retire.

294
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,300
It's not the time to sleep.

295
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,300
What's wrong, Kashiwagi?

296
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,300
You're a police officer, right?

297
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,300
That's why I can't be so selfish.

298
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,300
I can't see.

299
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,300
Even if I go back like this, I'll just be a burden.

300
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,300
I'm disappointed.

301
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,300
You started this company when you were 32 years old.

302
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,300
I was sending guards to construction sites.

303
00:13:40,300 --> 00:14:04,320
It was during the bubble, so there were many

304
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,300
I feel like I'm in trouble.

305
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,300
On August 9, President Moroboshi went to Haneda for overseas business.

306
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,300
But this is a lie that Vice President Araki Dan thought.

307
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:26,300
On that day, he took the car that Mr. Tomita Hideoaki was driving and went home from the company.

308
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,300
What's going on?

309
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,300
Probably the culprit is more than two people.

310
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,300
President Moroboshi was kidnapped.

311
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:43,300
Mr. Tomita was murdered.

312
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,300
The person who called President Moroboshi's home was at 9.25 pm.

313
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,300
This is Moroboshi.

314
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,300
I kidnapped Moroboshi Katsuya.

315
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,300
Look at your smartphone.

316
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,300
What is this?

317
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,300
If you tell the police, Moroboshi will kill you.

318
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,300
Call Vice President Araki Dan.

319
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:34,300
This is a picture sent to your smartphone.

320
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,300
Mr. Araki Dan.

321
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,300
The driver's door is not connected.

322
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,300
What happened?

323
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,300
It's Moroboshi.

324
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,300
Is Araki Dan here?

325
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,300
Yes.

326
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,300
I'm Araki Dan.

327
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
I will tell you the situation.

328
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,300
From tomorrow night from 0 am to 4 pm,

329
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,300
turn off the security system at the place you are going to say.

330
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,300
What?

331
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,300
Write down the address.

332
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,300
Yes.

333
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:18,300
Minato-ku Aoyama 4-1-13 Jeweld Wars Jewelry Shop.

334
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,300
4-1-13 Jeweld Wars Jewelry Shop.

335
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,300
Setagaya-ku Seijou-Nishi-3-4-22.

336
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,300
Seijou-Nishi-3-4-22.

337
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,300
Ohori-kenzaburo-otaku.

338
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,300
Ohori-kenzaburo-otaku.

339
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,300
I wrote it.

340
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,300
I wrote it.

341
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,300
If you don't follow the instructions, President Moroboshi will kill you.

342
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,300
I think it's a joke.

343
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,300
I've already killed one person.

344
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,300
What?

345
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,300
Oh, wait.

346
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,300
What?

347
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,300
What's wrong?

348
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,300
The driver of the president, Mr. Tomita, was found dead.

349
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,300
What?

350
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,300
I got it.

351
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,300
The next day, the vice president of Araki Dan called the officials.

352
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,300
I should have called the police.

353
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,300
If you call the police, the president will be killed.

354
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,300
If that happens, we're done.

355
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,300
We're done.

356
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,300
There's no replacement for the president.

357
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,300
What are you going to do, Vice President?

358
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,300
I can't decide.

359
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,300
I'm consulting you.

360
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,300
Even if you're consulted.

361
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,300
What else do you have other than doing what you're asked?

362
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,300
If you do that, will the president come back?

363
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,300
That's...

364
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,300
You'll give it back to me.

365
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,300
Absolutely.

366
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,300
Even if you say absolutely.

367
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,300
It's already noon.

368
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,300
I have to decide.

369
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,300
Vice President!

370
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,300
Are you really going to cut it?

371
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,300
I'll cut it.

372
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,300
You're going to cut it?

373
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,300
I'll cut it.

374
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,300
Yes.

375
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,300
You should have told the contract to the contractor in advance.

376
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,300
I can't say that.

377
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,300
It's going to be a problem.

378
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,300
The vice president has already been decided.

379
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,300
I'll cut it.

380
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,300
Come.

381
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,300
I'll cut it.

382
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,300
Yes.

383
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:35,300
As a result, Aoyama's jewelry store and Seijyo's house were invaded.

384
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,300
Of course, the security camera doesn't show anything.

385
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,300
I'm sorry.

386
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,300
The vice president of Araki-dani also...

387
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,300
There was a system error.

388
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,300
Actually, it's more than 10.

389
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,300
He was trying to deceive us.

390
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,300
It's probably because of the life of President Moroboshi.

391
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,300
But even now, 39 hours after the kidnapping,

392
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,300
President Moroboshi has not been released.

393
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:05,300
All the decisions of Moroboshi's security insurance are behind the scenes, right?

394
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,300
That company has been decided by President Moroboshi so far.

395
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,300
The employees can't respond to emergency situations.

396
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,300
No.

397
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,300
There's something behind this case.

398
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,300
Behind?

399
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:24,300
Why was the criminal convinced that the security system was cut as requested when he entered?

400
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,300
Isn't this the internal human being?

401
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,300
Even though the president was kidnapped,

402
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,300
the security company cut the security system.

403
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,300
It's a suicide.

404
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,300
Who made that decision?

405
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,300
In the end, the vice president.

406
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,300
That's right.

407
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,300
It's Araki-dani.

408
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,300
Kidnapping?

409
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,300
The criminal group, please search for the car used by President Moroboshi when he was kidnapped.

410
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:02,300
It's possible that the same car was used in the invasion of Aoyama and Seijyo.

411
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,300
Kidnapping is a high-risk crime.

412
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,300
Even the driver was killed.

413
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,300
It's not about paying for the body, it's about cutting the security system.

414
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,300
Why is it so complicated?

415
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,300
Since President Moroboshi is not coming back, the criminal's request may still be met.

416
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,300
Next, let's cut the bank's security system.

417
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,300
Bank robbery?

418
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,300
That's too inefficient.

419
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,300
SSBC doesn't have to think about that.

420
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,300
What the hell does the criminal want to do?

421
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,300
Hurry up and find the car.

422
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,300
Chief Ichi, is it true that kidnapping is a crime?

423
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,300
Chief Ichi, please calm down.

424
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,300
The victim is not released yet.

425
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,300
So please keep the truth to yourself.

426
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,300
Is President Moroboshi's identity card confirmed?

427
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,300
It's confirmed.

428
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
What did the criminal request?

429
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,300
It's confirmed.

430
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,300
I'll tell you the investigation situation.

431
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,300
So there's no information about the criminal?

432
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,300
No.

433
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,300
Actually, I have information.

434
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,300
What?

435
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,300
But I can't tell you now.

436
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,300
So I think I can solve this case in no time.

437
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,300
Then I'll tell you.

438
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,300
Wait a minute.

439
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,300
Chief Ichi.

440
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,300
What are you doing?

441
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,300
Wait, wait, wait.

442
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,300
I'm telling you.

443
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,300
Why are you always like this?

444
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,300
Please stop.

445
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,300
The market just closed.

446
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,300
Can I call you?

447
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,300
I'm bored to death.

448
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,300
I'm tired of reading books.

449
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,300
Kashiwagi came to see me.

450
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,300
Kashiwagi?

451
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,300
He came to see me because he was worried about me.

452
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,300
But he's not in a good mood.

453
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,300
Worried?

454
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,300
No, no, no.

455
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,300
He's in trouble.

456
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,300
I'm in trouble.

457
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,300
You fell down at that store.

458
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,300
Are you okay?

459
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,300
Nanami.

460
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,300
I'm okay.

461
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,300
Nanami.

462
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,300
I'm coming.

463
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
The ambulance is coming.

464
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,300
Yes, it's a man.

465
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,300
He's holding his right stomach.

466
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,300
What are you doing, Kashiwagi?

467
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,300
Nanami, are you okay?

468
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,300
He'll be back in five minutes.

469
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:14,300
He sent us that video after that.

470
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,300
You don't understand the meaning.

471
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,300
What are you doing, Kashiwagi?

472
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,300
Nanami, are you okay?

473
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,300
He'll be back in five minutes.

474
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,300
The ambulance is coming, Nanami.

475
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,300
At night, at this time ...

476
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,300
At this time ...

477
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,300
Tell the doctor that you're going to be discharged.

478
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,300
It's not time to sleep.

479
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,300
When I heard that you had been transferred to the police, I was excited.

480
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,300
I can fight again.

481
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,300
Same car.

482
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,300
Same car.

483
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,300
What's up?

484
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,300
Are you working, Mr. Aigaki?

485
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,300
I'm working.

486
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,300
I'm investigating.

487
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,300
What are you investigating now?

488
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,300
You're in the hospital, right?

489
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,300
Be quiet.

490
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,300
I'm free.

491
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,300
What's the matter?

492
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,300
Murder and kidnapping.

493
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,300
Kidnapping?

494
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,300
The president of the Moroboshi Police Department was kidnapped.

495
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,300
Really?

496
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:53,300
The driver was killed and the intruder was set up.

497
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,300
It's a big deal.

498
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,300
Kill ...

499
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,300
What?

500
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,300
The intruder set up?

501
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:04,300
The Moroboshi Police Department's security system didn't work.

502
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,300
That was the request of the kidnappers.

503
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,300
What do you mean?

504
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,300
It's a little ...

505
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,300
Right?

506
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,300
If the president was kidnapped, he should have asked for money.

507
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:21,300
It's too efficient to enter the thief by breaking the security system.

508
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:26,300
When I think about the effort to lock up the stolen metal ...

509
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:33,300
It's like playing a game.

510
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,300
Game?

511
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:40,300
It's a game that creates unpredictable stories and chases the opponent.

512
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,300
I found it!

513
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,300
I found the car.

514
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,300
Nanami, let's go.

515
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,300
Moroboshi Police Department?

516
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,300
Is it the same car?

517
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:59,300
It's a video of a bat that was 150 meters away from the scene of the murder.

518
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,300
And a bat that is 200 meters away from Aoyama's gemstone.

519
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,300
The same car!

520
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,300
And a bat that was 300 meters away from the victim's attack.

521
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,300
There is no doubt. It's the same car.

522
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,300
What's the number?

523
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,300
I'll zoom in.

524
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,300
I don't understand.

525
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,300
I'll try using Presley.

526
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,300
Low resolution.

527
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,300
Number estimation program.

528
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,300
I'll try.

529
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,300
Moroboshi Police Department?

530
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,300
Wasn't that company our client?

531
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,300
It's not a company.

532
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,300
Moroboshi is our personal client.

533
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,300
Oh, I see.

534
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,300
Kashiwagi has been in charge of it all the time.

535
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,300
Kashiwagi ...

536
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:06,300
But in the end, that's why he quit the company.

537
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:10,300
He lost 4 billion yen in the company's share of the company.

538
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,300
4 billion?

539
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,300
He built a portfolio that was too strong.

540
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,300
And the president is a big hit.

541
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,300
Why are you coming? You idiot!

542
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,300
You're such a useless person. You took my place.

543
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,300
I'm sorry.

544
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,300
Hey, you, too, lower your head.

545
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,300
Lower it!

546
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,300
I'm sorry.

547
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,300
So Moroboshi was pissed off and cut off.

548
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:46,680
He hit the president with a

549
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,300
He may not have known, but it's actually a pile of pride.

550
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,300
Especially you were a rival.

551
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:02,300
The criminal group is thought to have a leader and an executor.

552
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:08,300
Moroboshi's president, Yuukai, Tomita's murder, Aoyama and Seijyo's invasion,

553
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,300
and all the other members of the criminal group who have committed crimes.

554
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,300
What?

555
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:17,300
And that friend may have been gathered at the Yami-Bait.

556
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,300
Yami-Bait?

557
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,300
Either way, the most evil is the leader.

558
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,300
And this time, the most evil is the executor.

559
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:32,300
And only a person with the authority to do such a vicious crime can do it.

560
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,300
Director Ishida.

561
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,300
Haragitami.

562
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,300
Yes?

563
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,300
A little more evidence.

564
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,300
Isn't it you? The executor.

565
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,300
What?

566
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,300
What are you talking about? Why me?

567
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,300
You lied to us many times.

568
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,300
That resulted in the investigation.

569
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,300
That's the president's life.

570
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,300
It's a criminal company.

571
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,300
They're in charge of the crime.

572
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,300
It's a crime to cut the security system.

573
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,300
So that's...

574
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,300
You were cornered and couldn't make a proper judgment?

575
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,300
That's right.

576
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,300
It's a company that's a security company, but it has zero ability to play.

577
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,300
What did I do wrong?

578
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,300
What?

579
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,300
That's how you became the vice president.

580
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:19,300
I just became the hand and foot of President Moroboshi.

581
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:23,300
I just thought about being interested in President Moroboshi.

582
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,300
I can't do that.

583
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,300
I can't blame the vice president for what he did to me.

584
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,300
I can't do that.

585
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,300
Well, what about that?

586
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,300
Director Ishida.

587
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,300
The SSBC stopped the car of the criminal group.

588
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,300
Really?

589
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,300
All right.

590
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,300
Yes.

591
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,300
It's a matter of time before you can be fooled, Haragitami.

592
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:48,300
I'm also thinking of becoming my own hand and foot and working for it.

593
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,300
I'm just thinking about being interested in it.

594
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,300
There's a SSBC.

595
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,300
President Moroboshi was kidnapped.

596
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:09,680
Moroboshi was so angry that he hit the vice president with a

597
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,680
It's a matter of time before you can be fooled, Haragitami.

598
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,680
I'm also thinking of becoming my own hand and foot and working for it.

599
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,680
I'm also thinking of becoming my own hand and foot and working for it.

600
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,680
The ambulance is coming.

601
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,680
By the way, at a time like this...

602
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,680
Ouch.

603
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,680
If you kidnap the president, you should ask for money.

604
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:33,680
It's too efficient to cut the security system and enter the thief.

605
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:38,680
It's like the criminal is playing a game.

606
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:45,680
Create a story that is unpredictable and chase the other person.

607
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,680
4258.

608
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,680
It's the car number of the criminal group.

609
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,680
There's no doubt.

610
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,680
I'll chase him with the N system.

611
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,680
If I find the destination, I'll get a vocal image from there.

612
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,680
What the hell?

613
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,680
Hello?

614
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,680
The criminal in this case may be someone I know.

615
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,680
What?

616
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,680
If it's him, the target should be a little further ahead.

617
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,680
But wait a minute.

618
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,680
What are you talking about?

619
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:27,680
At the moment, the case is not bright, so the stock of Moroboshi Security Insurance is stable.

620
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,680
A stock?

621
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:34,680
If I'm the criminal, I'll put a lot of the sale of Moroboshi Security Insurance stocks on the line.

622
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:39,680
And then, I'll ask for more aggressive conditions for the president's release.

623
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,680
Moroboshi Security Insurance will not be able to do that.

624
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:50,680
If I do that, what do you think will happen if Moroboshi Security Insurance cuts the security system and spreads it to the world on social media?

625
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,680
It's a big deal.

626
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,680
The stock price of Moroboshi Security Insurance is very low.

627
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,680
That's right.

628
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:02,680
If I look at the bottom and buy the stock again, I will make a huge profit.

629
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,680
How many billion?

630
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,680
How many billion?

631
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,680
It's a empty sale.

632
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,680
And when I get the money, I run away abroad.

633
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:17,680
I gave the president Moroboshi a fear, crushed the Moroboshi Security Insurance, and made a big profit.

634
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:21,680
Isn't this the story of the game the criminal drew?

635
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,680
Who is he?

636
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:31,680
Ask the attorney general and the board of supervisors to find out who is selling the stock of Moroboshi Security Insurance.

637
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,680
If it matches the name I'm thinking of, he's the culprit.

638
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,680
I found the car.

639
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,680
Nishitama-gun Hino-demachi.

640
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,680
Nishitama?

641
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,680
Next to Akiruno.

642
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:50,680
This is the last image of the N-system installed on the Todo 184.

643
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,680
Leave the SSBC.

644
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,680
Don't let me check all the documents.

645
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,680
I'll put it in Araki.

646
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,680
As long as he's here, he can't do anything.

647
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,680
This is Moroboshi.

648
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,680
Come to Araki.

649
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,680
Where is Araki?

650
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,680
He's at work now.

651
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,680
You told the police.

652
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,680
I didn't tell them.

653
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,680
Fine. I'll tell them what you want.

654
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,680
Will you return the owner?

655
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:48,680
From tonight until 4 p.m., remove all the security systems in Tokyo that the Moroboshi Security Insurance has contracted.

656
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:53,680
If you don't do as you're told, there's no life for Moroboshi.

657
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,680
Hello? Hello?

658
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,680
Chief Gyaku.

659
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,680
It didn't work.

660
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,680
Damn it!

661
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,680
All of Tokyo?

662
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,680
They told me to remove the security systems. That's what they want.

663
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:14,680
Wait a minute. Araki was in the investigation room the whole time.

664
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,680
Maybe Araki isn't the culprit.

665
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,680
What do you mean by that?

666
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
Is he?

667
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,680
He said he was.

668
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,680
I told you he wasn't the culprit!

669
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,680
I didn't think you were the culprit.

670
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,680
You did? You suspected me?

671
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,680
I didn't suspect you.

672
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,680
But how do we respond to the culprit's demands?

673
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,680
The chief's life is the most important thing.

674
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,680
So you're going to remove all the security systems in Tokyo?

675
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,680
If you do that, the criminal group will do whatever they want.

676
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,680
What if the chief gets killed?

677
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,680
The police won't accept the help of a criminal.

678
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,680
Murderer!

679
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
What?

680
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,680
Really? I understand.

681
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,680
I'll leave it to the police.

682
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,680
You decide, Mr. Yaegashi.

683
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,680
How? No, no, no.

684
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,680
This is where the car was last confirmed.

685
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,680
There's a convenience store ahead.

686
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,680
Let's go.

687
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,680
Yes.

688
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,680
It's not there.

689
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,680
Where are the security cameras?

690
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,680
I don't know.

691
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,680
We have to find them.

692
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,680
Yeah.

693
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,680
We found a guy who sells a lot of Moroboshi security insurance.

694
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,680
His name is Ryo Kashiwagi.

695
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,680
I knew it.

696
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,680
Who is he?

697
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,680
He's my colleague from the insurance company.

698
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,680
He's made a huge loss to the company's assets.

699
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,680
He's been hit hard and has quit.

700
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,680
He's been hit hard and has quit.

701
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,680
You have a grudge against Mr. Moroboshi?

702
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:55,680
I joined the police and implemented a criminal plan.

703
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,680
You did?

704
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,680
He had a strong rivalry with me.

705
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,680
So you had a match with him?

706
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,680
A match?

707
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,680
Yes, that's what I said.

708
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,680
But that won't get you anywhere.

709
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,680
Kashiwagi is a murderer.

710
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,680
I don't think I'd be involved in such a violent act.

711
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,680
I don't think he's using a dark horse to give orders.

712
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,680
It's around here.

713
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,680
He's awake.

714
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,680
4258.

715
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,680
What's ahead of us?

716
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,680
There's only Akiyama.

717
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,680
Akiyama?

718
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,680
Yes.

719
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,680
Hino-demachi, Nishitagawa.

720
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,680
O-Aza-O-I.

721
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,680
2980.

722
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,680
5258.

723
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,680
O-Aza-O-I, 2980.

724
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,680
I think Mr. Moroboshi is locked up here.

725
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,680
Chief Ichikawa.

726
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,680
Send SIT.

727
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,680
Report him without the criminal noticing.

728
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,680
Yes, sir.

729
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,680
Wait.

730
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,680
Wait?

731
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,680
There's no one to give orders to in that house.

732
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,680
Someone to give orders?

733
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,680
There's a powerful suspect.

734
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,680
Kashiwagi Ryota.

735
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,680
He was a witness and is now a private investor.

736
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,680
What?

737
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,680
He's a colleague of Nanami's former company.

738
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,680
He hates Mr. Moroboshi.

739
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,680
He's a challenge to the police.

740
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,680
Now.

741
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,680
He's been in the Moroboshi Security Security Department.

742
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,680
You're doing this again?

743
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,680
How could you keep quiet when you knew he was there?

744
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,680
Why didn't you tell us?

745
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,680
Because we didn't have a criminal notice.

746
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,680
You could've reported it without a criminal notice.

747
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,680
We don't have time.

748
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,680
I'll get Nini.

749
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,680
No.

750
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,680
I'll set a trap.

751
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,680
A trap?

752
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,680
A trap?

753
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,680
What?

754
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,680
Let's go.

755
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,680
Let's go.

756
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,680
Let's go.

757
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,680
Let's go.

758
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,680
What's the matter?

759
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,680
What are you doing?

760
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,680
What are you doing?

761
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,680
What are you doing?

762
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,680
I'm going to kill you.

763
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,680
What are you doing?

764
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,680
I'm going to kill you.

765
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,680
I'm going to kill you.

766
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,680
The laser mic is set.

767
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,680
Hello?

768
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,680
Hello?

769
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,680
Hello?

770
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,680
The voice is back.

771
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,680
Shall we use the police?

772
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,680
Yes.

773
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,680
10 minutes left.

774
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,680
If we don't do as requested,

775
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,680
there's no life in Moroboshi.

776
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,680
There's no life in Moroboshi.

777
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,680
I refuse.

778
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,680
You can't cut all the security systems in the city.

779
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,680
You can't cut all the security systems in the city.

780
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,680
You can't cut all the security systems in the city.

781
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,680
I refuse your request.

782
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,680
I refuse your request.

783
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,680
I refuse your request.

784
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,680
Kill Moroboshi.

785
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,680
Kill Moroboshi.

786
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,680
You want me to kill Moroboshi?

787
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,680
It's Kashiwagi.

788
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,680
It's the police.

789
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,680
It's the police.

790
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,680
Kashiwagi.

791
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,680
Don't run.

792
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,680
Kashiwagi.

793
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,680
Kashiwagi.

794
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,680
Kako.

795
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,680
11 o'clock, 51 minutes.

796
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,680
Hurry.

797
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,680
Kashiwagi.

798
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,680
It's about two hours before the time.

799
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,680
It's about two hours before the time.

800
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,680
We have protected Moroboshi Katsuya

801
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,680
in the Akiya in Hinode-machi,

802
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,680
in the Akiya in Hinode-machi,

803
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,680
in the Akiya in Hinode-machi,

804
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,680
and also the one who was there

805
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,680
and also the one who was there

806
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,680
was Kawasaki Yuma, 26 years old,

807
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,680
Iwata Hikari, 30 years old,

808
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,680
and Kurosaki Kensuke, 22 years old.

809
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,680
It's me.

810
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,680
It's me.

811
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,680
It's me.

812
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,680
It's me.

813
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,680
It's me.

814
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,680
Is it Moroboshi?

815
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,680
I'm fine now.

816
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,680
Boss!

817
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,680
What is it?

818
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,680
It's the phone that was contacted by the commander.

819
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,680
Also, the victim who was seen as the commander,

820
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,680
Ryo Kashiwagi, 39 years old,

821
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,680
was arrested last night at 11.51am

822
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,680
at the home building

823
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,680
in Nanpei-dai, Shibuya.

824
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,680
Moroboshi was

825
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,680
quite exhausted,

826
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,680
but he was still alive.

827
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,680
Is it okay to think that

828
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,680
the same criminal group

829
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,680
killed the driver, Tomita Hideaki?

830
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,680
We're considering that possibility

831
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,680
and we're doing it at the police station.

832
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,680
What was the request of the criminal group?

833
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,680
What was the request of the criminal group?

834
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,680
Hmm...

835
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,680
I don't know.

836
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,680
Well,

837
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,680
Moroboshi Police Station

838
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,680
is going to

839
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,680
remove the security system.

840
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,680
What?

841
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,680
What do you mean by that?

842
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,680
What do you mean?

843
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,680
Please explain.

844
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,680
I was going to explain

845
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,680
all the details of the contract.

846
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,680
Do you want to do Aoyagi?

847
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,680
Come on.

848
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,680
I'm a member of the police.

849
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,680
Do it.

850
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,680
I'm a member of HOPE.

851
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,680
HOPE is a long name.

852
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,680
I'm sorry.

853
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,680
Do it.

854
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,680
It's okay.

855
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,680
Moroboshi Police Station

856
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,680
is in a bad shape.

857
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,680
But the president

858
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,680
made an apology meeting

859
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,680
so he might be able to stop it.

860
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,680
If we cut the security system

861
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,680
that company would be over.

862
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,680
It's your fault, Nanami.

863
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,680
I didn't do anything.

864
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,680
You were the one who fell down.

865
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,680
You were the one who fell down.

866
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,680
What?

867
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,680
You wouldn't have doubted

868
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,680
the cashier.

869
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,680
I see.

870
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,680
The cashier came to watch

871
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,680
the video

872
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,680
because I was hospitalized.

873
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,680
I see.

874
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,680
Anyway,

875
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,680
this is the first case.

876
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,680
It started with revenge.

877
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,680
And it's going to be a nightmare.

878
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,680
If we make it a cashier

879
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,680
even the kidnapping

880
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,680
and murder

881
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,680
are just the materials

882
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,680
for that.

883
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,680
If we use the dark bite

884
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,680
we'll be able to do it without

885
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,680
getting into trouble.

886
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,680
It might be a kind of psychopath.

887
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,680
I don't understand.

888
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,680
I don't even

889
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,680
have a book.

890
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,680
A book?

891
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,680
I'm going to go back to school today.

892
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,680
Today?

893
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,680
I'm going to go back to school now.

894
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,680
What are you going to do

895
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,680
after you retire?

896
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,680
I want to work.

897
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,680
I see.

898
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,680
Come on.

899
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,680
Yes.

900
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,680
I want to be in the pool.

901
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,680
You came down from the sky?

902
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,680
You're going to the half-moon.

903
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,680
You're a hot iron teacher.

904
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,680
I'm scared.

905
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,680
You're going to lie to me

906
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,680
while you're teaching me

907
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,680
to find the person who's doing the medicine?

908
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,680
I want to find the evidence.

909
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,680
I'm going to be caught

910
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,680
by the teacher.

911
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,680
You can't lie.

912
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,680
What do you mean?

913
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,680
I don't know.

914
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,680
I don't think I'll see you again.

915
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,680
That incident made me who I am now.

916
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,680
You weren't a teacher, Chief Ichikawa?

917
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,680
What?
