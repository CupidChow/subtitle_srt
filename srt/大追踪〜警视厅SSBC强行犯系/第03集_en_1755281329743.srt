1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm late.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
No, no, Mom, hurry up.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Police Department's Investigation Support Analysis Center,

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
known as SSBC,

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
is a department that supports all kinds of investigations

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
including collecting and analyzing camera footage,

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
data analysis of smartphones and computers,

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and profiling of the suspect.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And this time,

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
a special department that supports the investigation team

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
in charge of the murder, robbery, and embezzlement

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
is established.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
SSBC is the name of the department.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We're going home.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We're going to take a break.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll be right back.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay, I'll be right back.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Huh?

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
One, two, three.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Are you okay?

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You'll be fine.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We'll be right back.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That's a lot of evidence.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I wonder if he's okay.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Okay, I'll decide.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Good work.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Thank you.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Any news?

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's 8.18.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We found a woman lying on the floor.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
A delivery man found her.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I don't know if it's a crime,

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
but please collect the footage.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Please.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Got it.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hurry.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Where is the woman?

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Huh?

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Huh?

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Oh.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Shoko Mochida.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Heisei Gane.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
February 8th.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So she's 36 years old.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
She fell from there.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And she hit her head here.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Maybe she stepped on her own foot.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
No.

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Huh?

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I knew it.

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Wait, wait, wait.

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What are you doing?

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes?

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't mess with the scene.

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Not you.

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't think anyone attacked the woman here.

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Huh?

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Why?

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Because she was hit by a stun gun on her head.

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
A stun gun?

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
She had no shoes.

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Shoes.

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
She didn't wear shoes with left feet.

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What do you mean?

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It has nothing to do with you.

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
No.

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You.

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Don't point your finger.

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
This is our family's scene.

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The SSBC is collecting the video of the fire.

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I see.

78
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let's go.

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm going.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Good evening.

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
My name is Amawari.

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Is your mother's name Shoko Mochida?

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yes.

84
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I see.

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What time did your father come?

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He came to see me.

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He said he was going to see me.

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
He said he was going to see me.

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He said he was going to see me.

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
He said he was going to see me.

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
When will your father come back?

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He's not home.

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He's not home?

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Mochida had an emergency surgery.

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The results of the blood test show that he has a bone fracture.

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
He's likely to have severe brain damage.

97
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I see.

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Anyway, Nakajigawa will take your daughter there.

99
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm Mochida Yuzuki.

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Nice to meet you.

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Let's go.

102
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Let's go see your mother.

103
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes.

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I can't go home today.

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Make sure you check the lock.

106
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The police are investigating whether Mochida was attacked by someone.

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
They are investigating whether there are people who fled from the scene.

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This staircase is right outside the office.

109
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I found a video of a man who was in the scene.

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is the best.

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What about the other footage?

112
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
This is the clearest.

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
There are few cameras in the residential area.

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
There is only one video after this.

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
There was a camera 200 meters away from the scene.

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What is this?

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
This is Hansemon.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And this is Hansemon.

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
They probably think they are the same person.

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's Hansemon, but I can't tell by the face.

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The bike's owner?

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I don't know.

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I can't see the number, so I can't see the N-system.

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What is this?

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What's the use of an SSBC?

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Did you find Mochida's shoes?

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Black pumps?

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What's that?

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The victim didn't wear his left shoe.

130
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He wasn't at the scene.

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What are you talking about?

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Around 5 am on April 12,

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
On the road to Showa City, Nagoya City,

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
28-year-old Honoka Miyake was attacked by a stun gun by someone on the way home.

135
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Her left shoe was stolen.

136
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Her left shoe?

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's a light blue heel.

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Around 22 pm on April 19, a week later,

139
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
32-year-old Natsumi Koyama was attacked by a stun gun on the road to Nakagawa City, Nagoya City.

140
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
She was attacked and injured for two weeks.

141
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Her left shoe was stolen again.

142
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Neither of them are guilty or innocent,

143
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
but they are considered to be a crime by the German police.

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
In Nagoya?

145
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The same incident happened in Tokyo.

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This is also a German crime?

147
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The crime of the German police

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The time is running out.

149
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's 20.

150
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Mochida...

151
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's going to be okay.

152
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You're doing your best.

153
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If something unexpected happened to your mother,

154
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
what would happen to Yuzuki?

155
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What about my father?

156
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
A separate life after divorce.

157
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Same as mine.

158
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'll be responsible for Isato.

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What?

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You're not a family anymore.

161
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Don't say that.

162
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What about you two?

163
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
We broke up four years ago.

164
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What?

165
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Didn't you say that?

166
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
No, no.

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
That's why you always fight.

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Chief Aoyagi!

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Chief Ichikawa said not to move.

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Don't move?

171
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
He said he would stop the investigation.

172
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Stop?

173
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What does he mean?

174
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's an order from above.

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
From above?

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
This case has nothing to do with it.

177
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
We're not investigating.

178
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
We're not investigating.

179
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We're not investigating.

180
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Can I ask why?

181
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Maybe it's related to some embassy.

182
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Is the criminal a foreign official?

183
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Maybe.

184
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But the investigation is over.

185
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't know why you're staring at me like that.

186
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I've never heard of this.

187
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
From above?

188
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Where does it come from?

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
From the Chief of Police.

190
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
No, from above.

191
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Chief of Police?

192
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It could be a continuous case.

193
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
How could you stop the investigation of such a terrible case?

194
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Is that even possible?

195
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
If the investigation team can't move, we'll do it.

196
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What?

197
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Just us?

198
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That's not possible.

199
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Why?

200
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Nanami, this time it's not good.

201
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Because the people above will scold us.

202
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
They will scold us.

203
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Of course.

204
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But what if another victim comes out?

205
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
No, that's not possible.

206
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's impossible.

207
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We can't move like a family.

208
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's okay.

209
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Mr. Iga-ki was in the investigation team three years ago.

210
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You know the rules, right?

211
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yes.

212
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Wait a minute.

213
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Isn't it fine?

214
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm not saying we shouldn't move on our own.

215
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's a new version of the case.

216
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
We have to show the color of the version.

217
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That's right.

218
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Let's do it.

219
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I don't know.

220
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't know.

221
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
See you later.

222
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yes.

223
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Good morning, Chief Ichikawa.

224
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Good morning, it's you.

225
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What's up?

226
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Did the investigation of the Tōrima incident in Setagaya get reduced?

227
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
That's what the chief was doing.

228
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Good morning.

229
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Good morning.

230
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Why?

231
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Does the investigation team pull the trigger?

232
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Good morning.

233
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Thank you.

234
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's not a trigger.

235
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm just saying we shouldn't do it.

236
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What do you mean?

237
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We're going to do the investigation.

238
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's impossible.

239
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The investigation is cancelled.

240
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's not cancelled.

241
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm just saying we shouldn't do it.

242
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Good work.

243
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I was wrong.

244
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The investigation is done by the chief.

245
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That's not true.

246
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's the Tōrima incident.

247
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
The victim is a body.

248
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'll follow you at the next press conference.

249
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I...

250
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The victim was Honoka Miyake, who was attacked in Nagoya two years ago.

251
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Natsumi Koyama.

252
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And Shoko Mochida, who was attacked in Tokyo this time.

253
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The criminal's hand is the same,

254
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
but the three victims are women.

255
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
There is no common ground.

256
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So it's the Tōrima incident.

257
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But why?

258
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
After they were attacked in a row,

259
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
the two years period was extended.

260
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The culprit was in the police station for two years.

261
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Or he was working abroad.

262
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What was the culprit's purpose?

263
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Was it to hurt women or steal shoes?

264
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
If it was to hurt someone,

265
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
the shoes were a trophy.

266
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Trophy?

267
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
As a commemoration of the crime,

268
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
the culprit has something to take home.

269
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The victim's clothes, hair,

270
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
and even a bad example,

271
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,960
a

272
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,960
flag.

273
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,960
But this time, the culprit...

274
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,960
Always left-footed shoes.

275
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,960
By sticking to it,

276
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,960
the culprit is a type that tries to brand crime.

277
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
In any case,

278
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,960
the culprit in this hand is the one who escalates crime.

279
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,960
The suspect runs down the stairs.

280
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:04,960
He stole the high heels of Mochida's left foot.

281
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,960
Why was it here?

282
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,960
Is there a reason to attack Mochida here?

283
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,960
There's no reason.

284
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,960
If you steal shoes,

285
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,960
the other person will fall down.

286
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,960
I don't know.

287
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
What are you doing?

288
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,920
I'm investigating.

289
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,920
Investigating?

290
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,920
The one who stopped me is not SSBC.

291
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,920
You're being selfish.

292
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
What are you doing here?

293
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,920
I don't know.

294
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,920
I just happened to be here.

295
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,920
I'm sorry.

296
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,920
I'm sorry.

297
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,920
I'm sorry.

298
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,920
I'm sorry.

299
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,880
You did it on purpose.

300
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,880
I knew it.

301
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,880
You're going against the order.

302
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,880
You can't do anything.

303
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,880
Go home and study for the test.

304
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,880
Excuse me.

305
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,880
Wait.

306
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,880
Why did you do everything I told you to do?

307
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
You always act my way.

308
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,280
I've been putting up with your stupidity.

309
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,080
Stupidity?

310
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,680
You're always so strong.

311
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,480
You've been living with me for 12 years.

312
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,680
That's my line!

313
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,880
That's the reason for the divorce.

314
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,480
Nanami, I'm reporting this to the Chief of Police.

315
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,280
This is a clear violation of the order of the office.

316
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,880
Even though it's an unreasonable order?

317
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,880
We are the police.

318
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,480
You're a detective, right?

319
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,480
The reason you came to the first-class school is because you're a victim like Mochizawa.

320
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,480
You're here to catch the bastard who hurt her.

321
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,080
Which side are you looking at?

322
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,480
Let's go.

323
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,280
Yes.

324
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,080
I'll be done soon.

325
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,480
Mom?

326
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,480
Yes?

327
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,680
I'm sorry.

328
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,680
I'm sorry.

329
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
Mom?

330
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,680
Give me the spoon.

331
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,480
Mom?

332
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,680
Yes?

333
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,880
Spoon?

334
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,280
Yes, yes.

335
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,480
You haven't finished yet?

336
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,880
I'm sorry.

337
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,080
What should I do?

338
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,880
You can leave later.

339
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,080
Let's eat first.

340
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,280
I'm sorry.

341
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,280
I can't believe I saw you at home.

342
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,280
Dad used to say that you're a loser.

343
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,280
Stop it.

344
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,280
It's Aoyama.

345
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,280
Mom.

346
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,280
Mom.

347
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,280
Mom.

348
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,280
Mom.

349
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,280
This is the limit.

350
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,280
Let's take this photo and ask the police.

351
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,280
Ask the police?

352
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,280
Can we do it?

353
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,280
The family doesn't work, so we have to do it.

354
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,280
Is there any other SSBC-like way to do it?

355
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,280
For example?

356
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
I don't know.

357
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,280
We have to do it.

358
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,280
That's right.

359
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,280
Excuse me.

360
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,280
Mochida Shoko has passed away.

361
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,280
Yes.

362
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,280
I want to join the investigation.

363
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,280
Why?

364
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,280
Will the investigation team return to the investigation?

365
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,280
Only me.

366
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,280
Only Aoyama?

367
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,280
I'm Ichika Ishikawa.

368
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,280
I didn't get permission from Ichika.

369
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,280
Did you come here on your own?

370
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,280
I'm a detective.

371
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,280
I'll catch the bastard who killed Mochida Shoko.

372
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,280
Isn't that good?

373
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,280
I was just about to die.

374
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,280
I'd be grateful if you could join the family.

375
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Aoyama, please take care of the investigation.

376
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
Thank you.

377
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,280
That's good, Egaki.

378
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,280
I understand.

379
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,280
Chief Kawaguchi.

380
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,280
We found a video of a man with a mask.

381
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,280
20 minutes before the incident,

382
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,280
a man in a motorcycle came to the convenience store 500 meters away from the scene and bought a cigarette.

383
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,280
This is it.

384
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,280
A single-handedly cigarette?

385
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,280
This is it.

386
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,280
Barcode cash.

387
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,280
I've got the money.

388
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,280
I understand.

389
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
Tatsuya Senba.

390
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,280
Born on October 18, 2014.

391
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,280
He's 22 years old.

392
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,280
Tatsuya Senba.

393
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,280
The address is Minato-ku West Azabu 5-2-15.

394
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,280
Azabu Serenade.

395
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,280
It's a luxury apartment.

396
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,280
And it's Azabu.

397
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,280
A rich man.

398
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,280
Why are you looking at me?

399
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,280
I found it.

400
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,280
A photo of the university circle.

401
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,280
Two years and six months ago.

402
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,280
Nando University.

403
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,280
It's a university in Nagoya.

404
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,280
Nagoya.

405
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,280
This is...

406
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,280
Las Vegas?

407
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,280
A year ago.

408
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,280
What?

409
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,280
What's wrong?

410
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:30,280
The owner of the room where Tatsuya Senba lives is Keiichiro Senba.

411
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,280
Keiichiro Senba?

412
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,280
Keiichiro Senba is the mayor of the Jimei-to-kanji?

413
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,280
He's the top official of the Jiki-sori.

414
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,280
Keiichiro Senba was elected to the 17th district of Aichi.

415
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,280
It's Nagoya.

416
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,280
Two years ago, Tatsuya Senba was a college student in Nagoya.

417
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,280
Now it's Tokyo.

418
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,280
This is as close to the black as possible.

419
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,280
So the investigation stopped because of the pressure of his father?

420
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,280
Probably.

421
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,280
Is that true, Mr. Kakari?

422
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,280
I can't deny it.

423
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:13,280
Keiichiro Senba is the biggest silver in the Jimei-to-kanji.

424
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,280
Can I continue investigating this?

425
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,280
Huh? Why?

426
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,280
It's the Jimei-to-kanji.

427
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,280
So?

428
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,280
The chief of the Kisei-kanbo, the Jimei-to-kanji.

429
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,280
Oh, I see.

430
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,280
Don't worry about that.

431
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,280
It's a crime.

432
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,280
Don't worry about my father.

433
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,280
Then don't worry about anything.

434
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
I understand.

435
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,280
Let's do it.

436
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,280
Let's do it.

437
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,280
Good.

438
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,280
Even so, if the big politicians are involved,

439
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,280
we have to be careful with the investigation.

440
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,280
We can't just drag Tatsuya Senba right now.

441
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,280
First, we have to check the route.

442
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,280
Check the route.

443
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,280
Welcome.

444
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,280
Tatsuya Senba

445
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,280
It's Tatsuya Senba.

446
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,280
We can check this side as well.

447
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,280
It doesn't look like a motorcycle today.

448
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,280
After this, Tatsuya Senba had lunch at Aoyama Cafe

449
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,280
and returned to the apartment.

450
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,280
He's using a taxi just to eat lunch.

451
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,280
He's a good kid.

452
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,280
So I'm not a bonbon.

453
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,280
I wish I could get that smartphone back.

454
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,280
There's still data that's definitely not a crime.

455
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,280
Let's get more information about Tatsuya Senba.

456
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,280
Why are you the one who's in charge?

457
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,280
It's okay.

458
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,280
Yes.

459
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,280
Tatsuya Senba was at his home in Nagoya with his family

460
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,280
and was going to college.

461
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,280
But he suddenly went to school in April of 2023

462
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,280
and was in a coma.

463
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,280
That's right after the Nagoya incident.

464
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,280
Senba Keiichiro, who knew his son had been killed,

465
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,280
ran away to America in a hurry.

466
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,280
That's right.

467
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,280
And he returned on June 2nd of this year.

468
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,280
He didn't return to Nagoya.

469
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,280
He moved to an apartment owned by his father.

470
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,280
He's living alone now.

471
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,280
So he returned and the incident happened again.

472
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,280
And Senba Keiichiro stopped the investigation.

473
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,280
I can't forgive you.

474
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,280
You're using your power to wipe out the crime.

475
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:50,280
Yuzuki-chan was killed by her mother.

476
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,280
I can't forgive you.

477
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,280
The truth about Senba Keiichiro

478
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,280
The truth about Senba Keiichiro

479
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,280
Don't think you can escape.

480
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,280
You guys were right.

481
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:20,280
Senba was the one who pressured the police.

482
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,280
So Senba Tatsuya's crime was not a mistake.

483
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,280
I told you.

484
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:33,280
Senba is a famous actor who played the role of Kuraku in the film.

485
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,280
If your son's crime is exposed,

486
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,280
your political life will be ruined.

487
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,280
The former police chief is so worried.

488
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,280
I think he made a strong case against the SSBC.

489
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,280
That's right.

490
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,280
If you know anything about Senba Tatsuya, please tell me.

491
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,280
Shizu-san, what's going on?

492
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,280
Give me another cup.

493
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,280
What's going on?

494
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,280
Give me another cup.

495
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,280
In the election last year,

496
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,280
Senba was suspected of corruption.

497
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,280
The chief was arrested.

498
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,280
But in the end,

499
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,280
he was exposed.

500
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,280
But after that,

501
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,280
the chief was released.

502
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,280
I didn't think I'd be working for you for 20 years.

503
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,280
Thank you, sir.

504
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,280
Hey, Rintaro.

505
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,280
You're so convenient.

506
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,280
I know.

507
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:04,280
She's not Senba's current wife's child.

508
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,280
Senba Tatsuya?

509
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:12,280
My real mother left her when Tatsuya was five years old.

510
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,280
I don't know if it's because of that,

511
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,280
but I've been against my father for a long time.

512
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,280
I've been having fun with him.

513
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,280
He's a liar.

514
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,280
I didn't like him.

515
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,280
Senba Tatsuya fled to the US two years ago, right?

516
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,280
Yeah.

517
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,280
I heard that you were going to send Tatsuya to the US.

518
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:47,960
I sent a

519
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,960
I'm sorry.

520
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,960
The reason I took her shoes was

521
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,960
because I was obsessed with my mother.

522
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,960
Obsessed?

523
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,960
You mean you were a mother-in-law?

524
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,960
I was a trauma to my mother.

525
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,960
If I hide my shoes,

526
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,960
my mother won't go anywhere.

527
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,960
I was a dreamer

528
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,960
and obsessed with my dream.

529
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,960
I think I've been collecting shoes since before the incident.

530
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,960
At first, I was stealing what was left behind,

531
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,960
but then I got a desire to steal the shit that a naked woman was wearing.

532
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,960
So your selfish desire escalated.

533
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,960
Hey, Yagi.

534
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,960
What are you doing?

535
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,960
Are you investigating the Torima case?

536
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,960
I won't let the police take orders from my superior.

537
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,960
Where is this, Chief Ishikawa?

538
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,960
The SSBC gave me this.

539
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,960
The victim of this incident was Senba Tatsuya.

540
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,960
The victim is Senba Keiichiro's son.

541
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
What?

542
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,960
The one who stopped the investigation was Senba Keiichiro.

543
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,960
No way.

544
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,960
If we don't stop him, Senba Tatsuya will attack another woman.

545
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,960
Wait.

546
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,960
Are you sure?

547
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,960
Does that mean Senba Tatsuya is the victim?

548
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,960
Does that mean the son of the Chief of the SSBC is the victim?

549
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,960
Does that mean the investigation was stopped by the political forces?

550
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,960
Everything.

551
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,960
Everything.

552
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,960
Everything?

553
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,960
Yes, everything.

554
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,960
But we are watching Senba Tatsuya's outburst.

555
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,960
It's no use stopping him now, Chief Ishikawa.

556
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,960
Aoyagi!

557
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
Aoyagi!

558
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,960
Iyaguchi-san.

559
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
Yes?

560
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,960
I don't want to say it anymore, but my son is...

561
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
I understand.

562
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,960
He was the former Chief of the Police and the current Chief of the Internal Affairs.

563
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,960
And I am...

564
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,960
You passed the National Public Security Office's final exam and are now a career officer.

565
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,960
What about three years from now?

566
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,960
You will be promoted to Chief of the Police.

567
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,960
That is, you will be my superior.

568
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,960
If you are going to keep doing this...

569
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,960
I don't need to.

570
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,960
What are you talking about?

571
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,960
Then, I will do something I didn't know.

572
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,960
Yes, I understand.

573
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,960
Something I didn't see.

574
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,960
I see.

575
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,960
Then, good luck.

576
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
I'm sorry.

577
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,960
Thank you.

578
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Aoyagi, see you later!

579
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Let's continue.

580
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,960
Yes.

581
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,960
Can you see the battlefield?

582
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,960
Yes.

583
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,960
There is no movement.

584
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,960
Kenta!

585
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,960
Kenta!

586
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,960
Kenta!

587
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,960
It moved.

588
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,960
You did it!

589
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,960
It's the police.

590
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,960
You stole my shoes.

591
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,960
Show me what you're hiding.

592
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,960
I'm going to arrest the suspect.

593
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,960
Senba Tatsuya.

594
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,960
I'm going to arrest the suspect with a theft weapon.

595
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,960
I just picked it up.

596
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,960
I just picked it up.

597
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,960
Stop it.

598
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,960
I'm watching you.

599
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,960
Just admit it.

600
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,960
I said I didn't do it!

601
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,960
We have to admit the incident within 48 hours.

602
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,960
If we investigate Senba Tatsuya's home, we will find the shoes.

603
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,960
I'm currently searching the Akasajo trial.

604
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,960
Passcode.

605
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,960
There's no way I'm going to tell you.

606
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,960
You released me for a lock-up for forced identification.

607
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,960
That's not going to be accepted in court.

608
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,960
You know well.

609
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,960
Then tell me the password.

610
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,960
I'm just suspecting you for taking my shoes.

611
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,960
Why do I have to show you inside my phone?

612
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,960
There's a bad data in here.

613
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,960
Do you think you can just go on like this?

614
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,960
Do you know who my father is?

615
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,960
You're Senba Keiichiro, right?

616
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,960
So what?

617
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,960
Thank you very much.

618
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,960
We finally got permission to fire.

619
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,960
I'm going.

620
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,960
We don't have time. Hurry up.

621
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,960
Yes.

622
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,960
It's the first time I've ever been forced to search.

623
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,960
What?

624
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,960
That's a bike.

625
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,960
What?

626
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,960
Nothing.

627
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,960
There are no shoes.

628
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,960
And no glasses.

629
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,960
Where are you hiding them?

630
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,960
What?

631
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,960
What?

632
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,960
This is it.

633
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,960
I'm going to break it down.

634
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,960
Please.

635
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,960
You're used to it.

636
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,960
What?

637
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,960
Intrace disk.

638
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,960
I'll connect it to the duplicator.

639
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,960
Clone disk.

640
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,960
I'm going to clone it.

641
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,960
I wish I had some solid evidence.

642
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,960
There's a high chance that the stolen shoes are taking pictures.

643
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,960
Please come out.

644
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,960
Cloning complete.

645
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,960
I'm going to connect it to the writing device.

646
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,960
Data is coming out.

647
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,960
Okay, first the pictures.

648
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,960
Yes.

649
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,960
The shoes.

650
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,960
That's a lot.

651
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,960
There may be pictures that are connected to the crime.

652
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,960
Let's check them one by one.

653
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,960
All of these?

654
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,960
24 hours left.

655
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,960
Yes.

656
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,960
You.

657
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,960
You.

658
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,960
You've stolen women's shoes before, haven't you?

659
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,960
No.

660
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,960
Where are you hiding them?

661
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,960
What's so funny?

662
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,960
What are you rushing about?

663
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,960
Mr. Detective.

664
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,960
I'm sorry.

665
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,960
I didn't find them.

666
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,960
12,459 pictures.

667
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,960
I looked through all of them.

668
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,960
There were no pictures of the shoes.

669
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,960
I didn't know that.

670
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,960
I didn't know that.

671
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,960
What about the history of the search engine?

672
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,960
I looked it up.

673
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,960
There was no history of typing or inputting.

674
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,960
But there was nothing.

675
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,960
Seriously?

676
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,960
Seriously?

677
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,960
Senbatatsuya is more careful than I thought.

678
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,960
I guess we have to analyze this.

679
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,960
But we can't do it without knowing the password.

680
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,960
This is all we know.

681
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,960
How much time do we have left?

682
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,960
10 hours left.

683
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,960
Senbatatsuya will run away if we don't do anything.

684
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,960
I'll turn off the phone.

685
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,960
Sunglasses.

686
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,960
Sunglasses?

687
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,960
If it's a vending machine that you can buy with your phone,

688
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,960
maybe...

689
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,960
Ms. Oyumoto.

690
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,960
It's here.

691
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,960
I'll play it.

692
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,960
Stop.

693
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,960
Give it back.

694
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,960
There.

695
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,960
Zoom in on the sunglasses.

696
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,960
Yes.

697
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,960
It's showing.

698
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,960
Stop.

699
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,960
play it slowly.

700
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,960
Let it rewind.

701
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,960
2, 8, 9, 10, ...

702
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,960
What?

703
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,960
What did you press?

704
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,960
Isn't it 5?

705
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,960
It's 2.

706
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,960
Let's play a little.

707
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:25,960
8, 4, 7, 9, 5.

708
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,960
May I?

709
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,960
2, 8, 4, 7, 9, 2.

710
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,960
One more time.

711
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,960
Yes.

712
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,960
4, huh.

713
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,960
Man.

714
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,960
If you mess up three times, you'll get a lock.

715
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,960
One.

716
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,960
Huh?

717
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,960
Tatsuya Senba's mother is Misako Senba.

718
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,960
She's now Misako Sawamura.

719
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,960
The date of birth is August 2, 1974.

720
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,960
If you read it backwards,

721
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,960
2, 8, 4, 7, 9, 1.

722
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,960
If it's a masacon,

723
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,960
it's not strange to have your mother's birthday on your passport.

724
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,960
Medical school.

725
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,960
Yes.

726
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:32,960
2, 8, 4, 7, 9, 1.

727
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,960
Good.

728
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,960
Look at the picture.

729
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,960
This is...

730
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,960
The same as the data on the computer?

731
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,960
What?

732
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,960
It's the same.

733
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,960
So it was a waste of time.

734
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,960
No.

735
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,960
I have evidence.

736
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,960
It's definitely in here.

737
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,960
Mitsubishi-san, please analyze it.

738
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,960
Yes.

739
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,960
What's the time?

740
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,960
6 hours left.

741
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,960
6 hours left.

742
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,960
It's the time limit, Detective-san.

743
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,960
If you keep on arresting me,

744
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,960
you'll be charged with a crime.

745
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,960
There are still 3 hours left.

746
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,960
The day of the incident in Setagaya,

747
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,960
the power was turned off from 19.58 to 21.28.

748
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,960
It's the time limit of the incident.

749
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,960
The incident in Nagoya,

750
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,960
the night of July 12 and 19,

751
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,960
I don't know the location of the scene.

752
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,960
If the power is turned off,

753
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,960
it's a crime.

754
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,960
It's a crime.

755
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,960
It's a crime.

756
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,960
I think it's a crime.

757
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,960
But it's a crime.

758
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,960
It's not clear that he was at the scene.

759
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,960
There's no time left.

760
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,960
Is there any other data that could be used?

761
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,960
What about the app?

762
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,960
Any strange apps?

763
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,960
App?

764
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,960
The warehouse master?

765
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,960
Open it.

766
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,960
Yes.

767
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,960
The warehouse master?

768
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,960
This is the warehouse master that Senbatatsuya has contracted.

769
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,960
The history of the use.

770
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,960
July 25, 23.19.

771
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,960
The day of the incident in Setagaya happened on July 25.

772
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,960
After attacking Shoko Mochida,

773
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,960
I headed to this warehouse.

774
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,960
Chief.

775
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,960
I got the evidence.

776
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,960
Hurry up.

777
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,960
120.

778
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,960
120.

779
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,960
This way.

780
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,960
The warehouse master.

781
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,960
It's a report.

782
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,960
Report?

783
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,960
The set of the incident at the park is not in the name of the culprit.

784
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,960
I told you.

785
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,960
You guys should remember.

786
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,960
Hey, take this off.

787
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,960
Two years ago, you attacked Honoka Miyake in Nagoya.

788
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,960
Natsumi Koyama's shoes.

789
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,960
Shoko Mochida's shoes that attacked Setagaya six days ago.

790
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,960
Senbatatsuya.

791
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,960
I will arrest you again with the evidence of the robbery and the warehouse master.

792
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,960
The warehouse master?

793
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,960
Shoko Mochida is dead.

794
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,960
It's late.

795
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,960
This time, you stole my mother.

796
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,960
From a young girl.

797
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,960
I'm sorry.

798
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,960
Today, at 4.05 p.m.,

799
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,960
I arrested the defendant.

800
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,960
His name is Senbatatsuya.

801
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,960
He is 22 years old.

802
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,960
He is a college student.

803
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,960
That is the case of the disappearance of Shoko Mochida on July 25.

804
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,960
That's right.

805
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,960
The director of our investigation department has already investigated for a decade.

806
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,960
Yes.

807
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,960
Did he cancel the investigation?

808
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,960
No, he didn't.

809
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,960
He was deported.

810
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,960
No, he didn't.

811
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,960
You said you were in charge of the investigation, didn't you, Chief Ichikawa?

812
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,960
No, I didn't.

813
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,960
I said it.

814
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,960
I said it, Chief Ichikawa.

815
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,960
What does that mean?

816
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,960
Wait, wait, wait.

817
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,960
It's not that I didn't say I went.

818
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,960
It's okay because the culprit was caught.

819
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,960
Don't say that.

820
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,960
It's not that I didn't say I went.

821
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,960
It's not that I didn't say I went.

822
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,960
It's not that I didn't say I went.

823
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,960
Wait, wait.

824
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,960
The theme of the movie is always off.

825
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,960
Thank you for your hard work.

826
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,960
Thank you.

827
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,960
Yuzuki.

828
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,960
Yes.

829
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,960
Live strong, Yuzuki.

830
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,960
Thank you for the food.

831
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,960
This is delicious.

832
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,960
Is this a small dish?

833
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,960
Yamakomu is Akita's specialty.

834
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,960
This is my favorite.

835
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,960
My parents are over there.

836
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,960
I've never eaten Yamakomu.

837
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,960
Next news.

838
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:35,960
The Governor-General of the Jimei-to-Kanji-cho has been suspended from the court today.

839
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,960
I'm sorry for the suspension.

840
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,960
I can't get rid of the cause of my own death.

841
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,960
This teacher is also being asked by the criminal secretariat.

842
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,960
Can you do it, Chief?

843
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,960
I have no choice.

844
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,960
Ichika-chan was taken away by you at a press conference.

845
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,960
You won't be able to do it.

846
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:56,960
Yamako.

847
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,960
What is Yamako?

848
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,960
Yamako?

849
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,960
What is it?

850
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,960
I've been eating it since I was a kid, so I've never thought about it.

851
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:06,960
It's delicious.

852
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:08,960
It's delicious.

853
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:09,960
I can't stop.

854
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,960
I can't stop.

855
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,960
I can't stop.

856
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,960
The SBC is also the main character of the investigation department, so the investigation department did their best.

857
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,960
But...

858
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,960
But...
