00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,180
Episode 4

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You are finally here.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I finally...

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I finally found you.

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You bastard.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is what you've been looking for.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Oh!

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Open the door.

9
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Thank you.

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Mr. Kamo?

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Mr. Kamo?

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
How is he?

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He's weak, but he's breathing.

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
A match?

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thank you.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
How is he?

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The man who was passing by

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
heard the gunshot and ran away.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He found the man who was lying down.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Did you see the man who shot him?

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
No.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He had a My Number card.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He had it.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Kamo Yuusaku.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Born in 19th Showa.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Former police officer.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What?

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Police officer?

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He's my senior.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Police Station, Operation Support Analysis Center.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
SSPC.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Data analysis of security cameras.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Data analysis of smartphones and computers.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Profiling of the suspect.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The department that supports all operations.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The department that supports the investigation team.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The department that supports the investigation team.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The SSPC.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The wound is damaged.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Kamo Yuusaku has a bruise on his arm.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He's been shot.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The bullet is in his wound.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The doctor said it's likely to be a stab wound.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
A stab wound?

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Where's the gun?

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
According to the bullet, it's 38.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Kamo Yuusaku used to be a police officer.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
He was discharged from the army in 1935.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He was the chief of staff.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He was promoted to the 4th police officer of the Edo Branch.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Former police officer?

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
He's been shot?

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I think so.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Any information about the suspect?

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
At around 7 p.m.,

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
a police officer who was on the scene

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
found a man who was suspicious and called out to him.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But the man looked like this.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
A black shirt and a red shirt.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
A pair of sunglasses.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And a black hat.

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He looks like he's in his 30s.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He's a powerful suspect.

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He's definitely the suspect.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm going to the police station to find out where he is.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The man who was lying down

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
is Kamo Yuusaku, 81 years old,

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
living in Edo, Tokyo.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
He was rushed to the hospital in the city.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He's unconsciously in a critical condition.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The man who was walking by the office

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
was walking like a sound of gunfire.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Did you find the man in the red shirt?

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Where?

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The stairs at Godanda Station.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He went to the station?

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That means he went to Meguro or Shinagawa.

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Or he went to Asakusa or Magome.

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay.

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The man is a man from Godanda.

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Check the footage from each station.

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
How many stations are there?

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'll find them all.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes.

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Chief Ichikawa.

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yes.

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What's the matter, Mr. Nanami?

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
There are also people in the security camera

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
near the scene when Kamo was shot.

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Three men and one woman.

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
There are four of them.

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's the best to chase the man in red shirt.

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But...

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He ran away after he was killed.

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But...

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
How about we narrow down the search team?

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That's right.

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Let's investigate those four.

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Okay.

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But...

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But what?

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Why did Kamo, who lives in Edogawa,

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
go to Godanda at 11 p.m.?

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's not a good time to do that.

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's right.

109
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That's right.

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
There are many night shops in Godanda.

111
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Kamo is not a person who can play in the city at night.

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You don't know that.

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
There are many energetic old men.

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Or he was called out by the criminal.

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I don't think he has any relationship with the man

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
who has the sword.

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
How do you know about the victim?

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
When I became a police officer,

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I was in charge of the police station.

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Kamo helped me for three years.

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He taught me how to feed myself,

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
how to take care of my medicine,

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
how to deal with the flight attendant,

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
how to be kind and strict.

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He taught me all the skills of the job.

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That's it.

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
He is really a senior.

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I don't know that.

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes, Mr. Aoyagi.

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Why did Kamo...

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Don't make any noise.

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You will make a bad judgment.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Chief Inspector,

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Chief Inspector Kuzue is in the hospital.

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Hospital?

136
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
To see Kamo.

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What?

138
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Chief Inspector Kuzue?

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Aoyagi.

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yes.

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Chief Inspector Kuzue.

142
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Chief Inspector Kuzue is in the hospital.

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Aoyagi.

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You didn't come.

145
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
No, we didn't come.

146
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Why did you come?

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I came to see you.

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I came to see you.

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I came to see you.

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I came to see you.

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I came to see you.

152
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Catch him.

153
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yes.

154
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Kamo's abductor...

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Be sure to catch him.

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Be sure to.

157
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yes.

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Please wait for me.

159
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Please wait for me.

160
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,960
Duke was found dead.

161
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,040
All of them are white.

162
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,800
Then...

163
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,860
I told you.

164
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,340
The criminal onions the Formula S Classic

165
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,220
to as many people as he can.

166
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,920
Chief She iked the vote.

167
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,200
Now...

168
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,680
I found that we had a warning vote.

169
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,480
Whoever uses that computer

170
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,480
The culprit is the man who ran away with the police officer.

171
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,080
Chief Ishikawa.

172
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,680
Can you listen to me?

173
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,480
Mr. Iwakashi.

174
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:40,680
Yes.

175
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,680
I am the former police chief and the current chief of police, Kuzue Shunsuke.

176
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,280
I understand.

177
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,880
I have passed the national government official's general examination and entered the police department.

178
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,680
I understand.

179
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,280
I will be promoted to the chief of police in three years.

180
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,880
I understand.

181
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,280
I'm sorry.

182
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,480
How?

183
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,480
I'm the one who is particular about these four people.

184
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,280
I gave pressure to the chief of police,

185
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,480
and ended up going around the investigation.

186
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,480
I apologize.

187
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
Wait, stop.

188
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,080
Tell me what happened.

189
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,280
Raise your head, Nanami.

190
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,080
Yes.

191
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,080
There is no going around the investigation.

192
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,480
That's right.

193
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,880
If these four people are the white,

194
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,680
the suspect will be eliminated.

195
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,680
Right.

196
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,880
The culprit is the man who ran away with the police officer.

197
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,480
It's too early to say that he ran away with the police officer.

198
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,480
We promised the chief of police that we would take responsibility for the culprit.

199
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,080
The more time passes, the more the case will be solved.

200
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,680
So don't take it too seriously.

201
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:38,880
That's right.

202
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,680
Chief Ichikawa is the best commander in the investigation.

203
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,480
Be calm.

204
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,080
I understand.

205
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,880
Calm down and be quiet.

206
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,480
I said it.

207
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,080
Akashatsu.

208
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,680
Where are you?

209
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,480
I'm at the Katsuro station in Neguro station.

210
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,280
Neguro?

211
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,680
Look.

212
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,480
Can you see the face clearly?

213
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,880
No, not this.

214
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,680
At least you can see the face clearly.

215
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,080
There is no such technology.

216
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,680
Neguro is the next step.

217
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,880
It's either the Tamagawa or Takashima line.

218
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,880
The Eda line again.

219
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,280
That's right.

220
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,080
You guys are the ones who follow it.

221
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,880
That's right.

222
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,480
It's the job of the SSBC.

223
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,280
Look for the image of the scene.

224
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,280
I know.

225
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,680
Let's look for it.

226
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,480
Chief Ichikawa.

227
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,680
We've investigated the bullet

228
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,680
from the body of Uusaku Kamoyu.

229
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,880
The gun used was the same as the one used

230
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,680
by the homeless 22 years ago.

231
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,280
What?

232
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,480
Furthermore,

233
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,680
the gun was stolen by the NUNAMM M60

234
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,280
by the SSBC two days before the homeless was killed.

235
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:52,680
What?

236
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,880
What?

237
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,280
The police officer?

238
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,880
Yes, the police officer.

239
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,680
Uusaku Kamoyu.

240
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
What?

241
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,080
Did you know?

242
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,080
It means that you were the one who was involved in the case.

243
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,680
Of course I knew.

244
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,080
But I didn't know that you were involved in the case.

245
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,680
I was surprised too.

246
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,680
Me too?

247
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,680
The first case was in July of the 15th year of Heisei,

248
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,680
22 years ago.

249
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,880
July 6th.

250
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,680
Around 10.20 pm.

251
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,680
The police officer who was working for the 4th Koiwa

252
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,480
of the Tokyo and Edo Departments,

253
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,280
Uusaku Kamoyu, came back from patrol.

254
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,080
Yes, I'm back.

255
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,680
Come on.

256
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,680
Come on.

257
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,680
Come on.

258
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,280
Come on.

259
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,680
Someone was late and stole the gun.

260
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,680
I was in the traffic control room at that time.

261
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,680
If I were with Mr. Kamo,

262
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,680
I would have been killed.

263
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,280
But the situation was the worst.

264
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,680
July 8th.

265
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,880
2 pm.

266
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,680
There was a gunshot at the 7th Chome Park in Kitajin.

267
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,280
What?

268
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,280
He's dead.

269
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
He's dead.

270
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,280
The homeless man died.

271
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,280
The police officer who was in charge of the patrol

272
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,280
was taken away from the police station two days ago.

273
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,280
Mr. Kamo was released from the hospital

274
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,280
because of his own fault.

275
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,880
Mr. Kamo should have been treated well after that year.

276
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,280
Mr. Kamo.

277
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,280
Mr. Kamo.

278
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,280
Thank you for sending me away.

279
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,280
I feel sorry for you.

280
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,680
I'm so sorry for you.

281
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,680
I shouldn't have left you.

282
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,480
What was my life as a police officer?

283
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,280
I'm fine.

284
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,280
I still can't forget your face.

285
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,280
I tried to contact you several times after that.

286
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,280
But you didn't answer.

287
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,280
I heard that you lost your wife and became alone.

288
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,280
You must have been through a lot.

289
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,280
I'm sure you were.

290
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,280
Mr. Kamo.

291
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,280
Please give me a light.

292
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
Yes.

293
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,280
This is the new room of Mr. Kamo.

294
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,280
Mr. Kamo.

295
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,280
Excuse me.

296
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,280
Please pay 150 J.

297
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,280
Yes.

298
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,280
Step aside.

299
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
Mr. Kamo, don't die.

300
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,280
Adrenaline.

301
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
Yes.

302
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,280
I'm back.

303
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,280
It's okay now.

304
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,280
Don't move your vital points.

305
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,280
Yes.

306
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,280
Let's connect the respirator.

307
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,280
I'll take the blood.

308
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,280
Yes.

309
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,280
Call the portable.

310
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,280
I'll check the blood.

311
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,280
Yes.

312
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,280
Are you okay, Mr. Ida?

313
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,280
Yes.

314
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,280
I wonder what happened.

315
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,280
The gun that was used 22 years ago was used this time.

316
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,280
You mean that Mr. Kamo was shot with his own gun, right?

317
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,280
If you think about it,

318
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,280
he was shot by the guy who stole the gun from Mr. Kamo.

319
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,280
That's what it is.

320
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,280
But there are things that are not normal.

321
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,280
Why is the chief of the military police concerned about Mr. Kamo?

322
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,280
He told us to arrest the criminal.

323
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,280
So you know it, right, Nanami?

324
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,280
You said something meaningful, didn't you?

325
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,280
You said you were surprised.

326
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
Actually,

327
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,280
I've heard so many times about that case 22 years ago.

328
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,280
I still can't solve it.

329
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,280
I'm sorry.

330
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,280
Is the chief of the military police concerned about that case?

331
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,280
He was in the final round and was involved in the investigation.

332
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,280
But he came to see the chief of the military police.

333
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,280
Nanami,

334
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,280
I want to hear directly from the chief of the military police.

335
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,280
What?

336
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,280
The chief of the military police promised the chief of the military police that

337
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,280
he would definitely solve the case.

338
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,280
But for that,

339
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,280
we need to know the investigation situation at that time.

340
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,280
I want to know, too.

341
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
Please.

342
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
Please.

343
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,280
I understand.

344
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,280
I'm Shizu.

345
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
Please don't mind me.

346
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Is the chief of the military police here?

347
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
Yes.

348
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,280
I'm sorry I'm late.

349
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,280
Chief of the military police.

350
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,280
Thank you for your hard work.

351
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,280
I'm sorry for being so busy.

352
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,280
It's okay.

353
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,280
Shizu,

354
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,280
I'll have some cold wheat today.

355
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
I'll give it to everyone.

356
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
Thank you.

357
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,280
Thank you.

358
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,280
Thank you.

359
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,280
Thank you.

360
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
Thank you.

361
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,280
Thank you.

362
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,280
Thank you.

363
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,280
It's good.

364
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,280
At the time of the incident 22 years ago,

365
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,280
I was the chief of the police department

366
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,280
of the criminal organization.

367
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,280
Did you die?

368
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,280
The culprit thought he could have a reflection.

369
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,280
Of course.

370
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,960
What was the investigation situation?

371
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,640
It was a combination of the police and the police.

372
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,320
I asked Mr. Tamo to tell me the truth.

373
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,360
I didn't see the criminal's face.

374
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,000
I saw the young man in white.

375
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,000
He was running away.

376
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,960
He was in his twenties.

377
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,960
Maybe he was a teenager.

378
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,600
I'm sorry.

379
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,080
To be honest,

380
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,360
the investigation was going on from the beginning.

381
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,800
There were many reasons.

382
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,560
At that time,

383
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,680
there were few security cameras.

384
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,480
We had to rely on witness testimony.

385
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,960
It was much more difficult.

386
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,120
Also,

387
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,120
without the witness,

388
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,960
It was harder to make a Muito expert.

389
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,400
There were more and moreTrans 하지만

390
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,480
horrifying information.

391
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,280
I got a letter from Mr. Tamo

392
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:18,720
on the day I became

393
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,720
I was told that I might not be able to reach him.

394
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,720
I was the reason why the homeless people were killed.

395
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,720
And after I left,

396
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,720
I was told that I was interrogating in the area near Shinjuku.

397
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,720
Interrogation?

398
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,720
Even after you became a civilian?

399
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
Alone?

400
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,720
Yes.

401
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
For example,

402
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
I have a pistol,

403
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,720
and I killed a homeless person.

404
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,720
Do you know anyone who has such a pride?

405
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,720
No.

406
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,720
But I couldn't find the culprit

407
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
in the police or the police.

408
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
There's someone like that.

409
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
If it was now,

410
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,720
if the digital investigation had evolved to this point,

411
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,720
the case would have been solved long ago.

412
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,720
That's possible.

413
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,720
So I

414
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
became the police chief

415
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,720
and worked in the SSBC.

416
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
What?

417
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,720
The chief of the Kusei Police Department?

418
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,720
I've been told that

419
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,720
the digital investigation is coming.

420
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,720
You said that.

421
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,720
But

422
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,720
the investigation of that case

423
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,720
hasn't been completed yet.

424
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
Actually,

425
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,720
I met you once.

426
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,720
What?

427
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,720
That was

428
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,720
before I quit the police chief position.

429
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,720
Are you still looking for the culprit, Mr. Kama?

430
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,720
Yes.

431
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,720
Stop it.

432
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,720
You're a civilian now.

433
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,720
You can't be attacked by danger.

434
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,720
Chief.

435
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,720
I was robbed by that man

436
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,720
not only with a pistol.

437
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,720
It's my life.

438
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,720
Mr. Kama.

439
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,720
I won't stop.

440
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,720
I'm living for the sake of finding that man.

441
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,720
I'm grateful

442
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,720
that I, who was the chief of the police department,

443
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,720
could talk to you like this.

444
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
Thank you.

445
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,720
Excuse me.

446
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
At that time,

447
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,720
if I stopped him,

448
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,720
he wouldn't have been shot.

449
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
The chief of the police department

450
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,720
said that the culprit of this case

451
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,720
was a man who robbed a pistol 22 years ago.

452
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,720
Mr. Kama

453
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,720
finally found the victim.

454
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,720
I knew it.

455
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,720
If Mr. Kama saw a man

456
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,720
who was in his 20s or 30s,

457
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
22 years ago,

458
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,720
would you say he's in his 40s or 30s now?

459
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,720
Would you say he's the man we're after?

460
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,720
Do you have a eye for him?

461
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,720
The SSBC is tracking him with a bomb relay.

462
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
I'll definitely find him.

463
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
Meanwhile, I'll investigate Mr. Kama's home.

464
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,720
I'll investigate Mr. Kama's home.

465
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,720
There might be some information about the culprit

466
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
that Mr. Kama caught.

467
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,720
It's a combination of digital and analog.

468
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,720
That's exactly what I wanted.

469
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
Please.

470
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
Yes.

471
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,720
Understood.

472
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,720
I'll definitely catch him.

473
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,720
A combination of digital and analog.

474
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,720
I'm digital.

475
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
You're analog.

476
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,720
What do you want to say?

477
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
Nothing.

478
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,720
You finally have the time to laugh.

479
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
But what?

480
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,720
Do you want to say that we're behind the times?

481
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,720
I know.

482
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,720
The SSBC is a control and support analysis center.

483
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,720
You're just supporting our operations.

484
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
Yes.

485
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,720
And the SSBC is also a part of the operation team.

486
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,720
We're the department that works by our own rules.

487
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,720
We've helped you a lot.

488
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,720
Helped?

489
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,720
We've solved many problems.

490
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,720
Why do you want to be in charge?

491
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,720
That's you.

492
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,720
No, but that's the truth.

493
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,720
How much do I have to be patient with you?

494
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,720
I'm not as patient as you are.

495
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,720
I'm not as patient as you are.

496
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,720
I'm not as patient as you are.

497
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,720
I don't understand.

498
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
I don't understand.

499
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
Excuse me.

500
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,720
I'm sorry.

501
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,720
Stop it.

502
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,720
You're...

503
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,720
If you say that, I won't let you meet Misato.

504
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,720
I won't.

505
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,720
That's not it.

506
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,720
It was delicious.

507
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,720
I won't blame you.

508
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,720
Thank you for the meal.

509
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,720
Thank you for the meal.

510
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,720
Please give me a drink.

511
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,720
Wait.

512
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
I thought you were depressed.

513
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,720
So I ate with you.

514
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,720
But I can't.

515
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,720
I'll have water and oil.

516
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,720
And the SSBC.

517
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,720
Stop it.

518
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,720
The meal is 250 yen.

519
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,720
Oh, Nanami.

520
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,720
I'm from Tokyo Central Television.

521
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
I'm Shimizu.

522
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
I always watch your channel.

523
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
Thank you.

524
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,720
I'm sorry.

525
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,720
I didn't know you were sitting here.

526
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
It's okay.

527
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,720
I finished eating.

528
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,720
Thank you.

529
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,720
Nanami.

530
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
Yes.

531
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,720
What's going on with the investigation?

532
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,720
The case of the former police officer being shot.

533
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,720
It's going well.

534
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,720
Did the defendant get killed?

535
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,720
Please ask the investigation department.

536
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,720
What about the SSBC?

537
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,720
I can't say that.

538
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
I'm still worried.

539
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,720
But you're a middle-aged man.

540
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,720
What did you do before that?

541
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,720
What?

542
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,720
I was a businessman.

543
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,720
A businessman?

544
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,720
Do you have a family?

545
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,720
I'm single.

546
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,720
What?

547
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,720
Thank you for the meal.

548
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,720
Excuse me.

549
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,720
One more question.

550
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,720
Why didn't you get married?

551
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,720
Why didn't you get married?

552
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,720
I haven't met anyone like that.

553
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,720
Why are you asking?

554
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
I'm a reporter.

555
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,720
I want to know the relationship between the investigation department and the investigation department.

556
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,720
I'll introduce a good person.

557
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,720
Please tell me the type of person.

558
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,720
Shimizu.

559
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,720
Yes.

560
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
You only have one question.

561
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,720
Excuse me.

562
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,720
You're a good person.

563
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,720
Mr. indicate against you.

564
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,720
About Mirei incredibly.

565
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,720
And this?

566
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,720
cough

567
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,720
Yes.

568
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,720
It's not a wrong idea.

569
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,720
You are the title.

570
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,720
How do you know that?

571
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,720
Just looking.

572
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,720
Do you have one with you?

573
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,720
I have something.

574
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,720
Do you have an account?

575
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
Yes.

576
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,720
Are you the person whose name you drew?

577
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,720
Yes.

578
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,720
What's your name?

579
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,480
You're looking for the video of the fire?

580
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,160
Chief Kage, we found the location information

581
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,600
from Mr. Yusaku Kamo's phone.

582
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,920
Mr. Kamo has been staying around Gotanda Station

583
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,000
since September 1st, 4 days before the shooting.

584
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,040
He's been staying from early morning to late night.

585
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,800
He's been staying for 15 hours a day.

586
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,280
He's so obsessed.

587
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,960
I can only imagine.

588
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,680
But why did he stay since September 1st?

589
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,760
Mr. Kamo, didn't you get the evidence

590
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,800
to prove the culprit?

591
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,280
It's like living a lonely life.

592
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,720
I Tipi

593
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,080
Uhm

594
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,480
Um

595
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:25,640
Oh

596
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:39,800
Other

597
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,280
The

598
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,780
who

599
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,960
it

600
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,920
beside

601
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,920
same

602
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,560
it

603
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,380
2 weeks ago

604
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,140
The home address of Mr Kamo

605
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,940
Wow17.09

606
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,340
What?

607
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,940
Are you owned by her?

608
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,220
Yes

609
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,780
Do you have a calendar?

610
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,420
Calendar?

611
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,820
Yes

612
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,180
Does it have something on next September?

613
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,520
Next September?

614
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,560
I don't see any sign.

615
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,560
What about August 31st?

616
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,760
What's wrong?

617
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,560
It's fine.

618
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,360
Nothing.

619
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,360
I see.

620
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
Mr. Iga,

621
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,360
Mr. Kama's phone

622
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,960
has a record of 5.15 p.m. on August 31st.

623
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,160
5.15 p.m.?

624
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,160
Where is he?

625
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,160
Where is he?

626
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,760
Where is he?

627
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,960
I'll look into it.

628
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,960
03.

629
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,160
Hello?

630
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,360
This is the TV station.

631
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,560
TV station?

632
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,760
We had a news program this evening.

633
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,160
It was August 31st, at 5.15 p.m.

634
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,160
We had a meeting with the viewers.

635
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,560
It was a man who was older than me.

636
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,960
What was the meeting about?

637
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:29,760
It was about when the interview video was released.

638
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,160
When was it released?

639
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,560
The interview video?

640
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,960
It was a special segment for the New Year's Day.

641
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,160
We had a guide interview.

642
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,960
The host said that the interview was on.

643
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,360
So I thought it was over.

644
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,960
He said that the interview was done in a hurry.

645
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,560
In a hurry?

646
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,760
Are you worried about the New Year's Day?

647
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,560
The New Year's Day?

648
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,760
Yes.

649
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,960
This man?

650
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,760
He was...

651
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,560
Do you know him?

652
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,760
I saw him in the security camera.

653
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,360
Is he the culprit?

654
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,760
The culprit?

655
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,160
I'm worried.

656
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,360
He's in my age.

657
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,360
Mr. Kama must have found the culprit in this video.

658
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,960
He must have found out.

659
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,160
He's a vicious man.

660
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:16,760
But...

661
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,760
But what?

662
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,160
Could you be quiet for a moment?

663
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,160
Sorry.

664
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,160
He's the man I saw 22 years ago.

665
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,160
Is that why you're here?

666
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,160
But the man in the red shirt...

667
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,360
No, it's not him.

668
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,360
No.

669
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,560
No.

670
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,560
The culprit is not always wearing red shirts.

671
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,960
That's right.

672
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,960
So this video is meaningless.

673
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,360
You're interested.

674
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,160
Yes.

675
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,560
I want to work, but I don't know what to do.

676
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:04,360
I don't know anything until Mr. Kama regains consciousness.

677
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,960
There are powerful people around.

678
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,960
You don't have to be so careful.

679
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,360
I'm sorry, Nanami.

680
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,960
You told me that

681
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,560
you're the best commander.

682
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,360
I did.

683
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,560
You apologized to me.

684
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,560
But you should be quiet.

685
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,560
I didn't say that.

686
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,360
You didn't?

687
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,560
No.

688
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,560
I'm sorry.

689
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,560
No, I didn't apologize.

690
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,560
I'll leave it to you.

691
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:37,960
Really?

692
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,560
Yes.

693
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,360
Really?

694
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,360
Thank you.

695
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,760
Everyone,

696
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,560
the culprit is the man in the red shirt.

697
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,960
Who did that?

698
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,960
Who escaped?

699
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,860
I don't know.

700
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,560
But the culprit is the burglar.

701
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,960
Where could he be?

702
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,860
Is there a red light here?

703
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,360
I'll never know.

704
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,360
I might realize some pitfalls here.

705
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,760
I don't know.

706
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,400
Yes.

707
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,440
Alright.

708
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,560
Remember this face.

709
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,880
Listen.

710
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,720
If you buy bento at this bento shop,

711
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,080
you'll live near this bento shop.

712
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,080
Alright. Let's go.

713
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,600
Listen.

714
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,280
This is the roll action.

715
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,720
Each family must go to Musashi Koime.

716
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,600
Find the target no matter what.

717
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,320
One hundred rounds.

718
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,960
One hundred rounds.

719
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,400
Yes.

720
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,000
What?

721
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,360
A different action?

722
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,240
Listen.

723
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,960
You go to Musashi Koime.

724
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,080
We'll meet again.

725
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,360
Let's go.

726
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,280
Yes.

727
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,600
Then we may lose our supply.

728
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,920
You're still watching?

729
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,760
Yaku.

730
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,040
Why did you choose this scene?

731
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,560
I'm sure there must be a reason.

732
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,280
I can only imagine the culprit.

733
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,360
Maybe he's the one who's being interviewed.

734
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,960
What do you mean?

735
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,080
Maybe he's the one who's being interviewed.

736
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,080
The culprit was a man.

737
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,760
Maybe he's the one who's being interviewed.

738
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,360
No, no.

739
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,560
Maybe he's the one who's being interviewed.

740
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,200
Maybe he's the one who's being interviewed.

741
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,800
So, there's a new truth?

742
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,000
What?

743
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,280
I don't know anymore.

744
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,000
I think there's a new truth

745
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,840
that I didn't know about 22 years ago.

746
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,040
I've been looking for someone here.

747
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,440
And I found him.

748
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,480
I found a gun.

749
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,080
Let's go.

750
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,320
Checkmate.

751
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,720
He shot Mr. Okamoto.

752
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,000
You...

753
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,640
You didn't contact him?

754
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,360
No one has ever watched it.

755
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,560
So, the suspect,

756
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,240
you gonna tell him this or you gonna trip this again?

757
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,520
What?

758
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,760
You what, you wouldn't tell him this?

759
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,480
You still wanna give me the photos you took.

760
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,320
Please.

761
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:57,880
Yes.

762
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,680
Okay.

763
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,600
Let's go.

764
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,160
Yes.

765
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,520
That interview was here.

766
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,680
Excuse me.

767
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,360
Yes.

768
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,720
Police?

769
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,480
Have you seen this person?

770
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,640
I don't know.

771
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,440
Do you know him?

772
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,280
No.

773
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,440
I don't know.

774
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,360
What's wrong?

775
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,680
Have you seen him?

776
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,760
No.

777
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,880
I don't know.

778
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,080
I see.

779
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,720
I understand.

780
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,000
Thank you for your cooperation.

781
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,040
You're welcome.

782
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,960
Let's go to the next one.

783
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,680
Yes.

784
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,600
I'm Igaaki, the police chief.

785
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,720
I saw the video of the security camera here.

786
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,160
Mr. Police Chief.

787
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,280
What happened?

788
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,320
It's been five days since Mr. Kamo came here.

789
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,400
You programzed every girl to be Alright!

790
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,800
P�� N Brazil?

791
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,440
Yes.

792
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,720
Did you trick everyone.

793
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,560
Yes.

794
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,720
You've received the film interview?

795
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,880
That day, haven't you seen it yet?

796
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,160
Waiter!

797
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,080
What?

798
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,520
He's that guy.

799
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,960
Rik shoulder jacket.

800
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,720
I can't see his face.

801
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,720
I can't see his face.

802
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,720
Turn around.

803
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,720
Turn around.

804
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,720
Turn around.

805
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,720
I took off my sunglasses.

806
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,720
I'm going to the hospital.

807
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,720
Checkmate!

808
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,720
I found the target.

809
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,720
I found the target.

810
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,720
It's not working.

811
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,720
I'm going to the hospital.

812
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,720
The target is not working.

813
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,720
Can you tell me your name?

814
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,720
Ms. Kao.

815
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,720
Don't cry.

816
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,720
The police...

817
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,720
Police?

818
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,720
They called me.

819
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,720
Mr. Kitsune is a detective.

820
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,720
Kitsune?

821
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,720
Kitsune?

822
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:16,720
They said your pension was targeted by the fraud group.

823
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,720
So?

824
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,720
Don't be afraid.

825
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,720
I'm the police.

826
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,720
Police!

827
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,720
Show me your room!

828
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,720
Show me your room!

829
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,720
Why are you here?

830
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,720
Let go of me!

831
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,720
Mr. Nagami.

832
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,720
Please.

833
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,720
Yes.

834
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,720
Thank you.

835
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,720
Sorry to keep you waiting.

836
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,720
I know you're busy.

837
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,720
What's the matter?

838
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,720
Actually...

839
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,720
I have something to ask you.

840
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,720
Sit down.

841
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,720
Yes.

842
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,220
Re ingredient

843
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,720
Twenty year ago,

844
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,720
I was involved in an prosecutedft case.

845
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,720
But I have no other unresolved case found throughout the world.

846
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,720
Why would I hang around with Mr. Nagake

847
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,720
in a case of fraud?

848
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,200
I found it hard for people like him to understand.

849
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,360
This Loser Triple K Stepped Out was Master's duty.

850
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,400
He declared for you to solve layer 4 in Sui searches.

851
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,440
It's what you have hoped to do, isn't that it?

852
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,840
Yeah.

853
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,360
Indeed.

854
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,280
Bao Hafan, what happened to you?

855
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,880
I didn't want Master to everyday get upset about it.

856
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,040
But it's not true.

857
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,040
I think there must be another reason for it.

858
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,040
To be more specific,

859
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,040
I think there is a truth that I didn't know about

860
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,040
when I was in the incident 22 years ago.

861
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,040
As expected of my son,

862
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,040
Lin Taro.

863
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,040
What?

864
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,040
A gunshot was found.

865
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,040
There was a real one in the model gun.

866
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,040
I found it.

867
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,040
It's the M60 of the south entrance.

868
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,040
Seriously?

869
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,040
Wait a minute.

870
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,040
Good job.

871
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,040
I found the gun.

872
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,040
Good job.

873
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,040
The M60 of the south entrance.

874
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,040
22 years ago,

875
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,040
the press reported that the incident.

876
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,040
Of course.

877
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,040
The police at the scene were attacked.

878
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,040
The gun was stolen.

879
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,040
The homeless were killed with that gun.

880
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,040
Yes.

881
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,040
But that's all the information.

882
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,040
What?

883
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,040
What?

884
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,040
In that incident,

885
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,040
there was something that was unpopular.

886
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,040
Something unpopular?

887
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:49,040
The homeless were not the ones who were killed.

888
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,040
The one who was killed was the director.

889
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,040
What?

890
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,040
He was my subordinate who was in charge of the investigation.

891
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,040
The M60 of the south entrance.

892
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,040
The M60 of the south entrance.

893
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,040
What do I need?

894
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:42,040
You shot Mr. Kano.

895
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,040
That old man.

896
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,040
The police came to arrest him.

897
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,040
What a pity.

898
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,040
Always추

899
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,040
Do you know who the JAPOS colony is?

900
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,040
Wasn't he Die ADM and killed by the police?

901
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,040
Cops?

902
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,040
Men.

903
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:30,040
あれıъ

905
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,040
Have you ever seen a below dead person?

906
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,040
Sorry.

907
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,040
What?

908
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,040
Sorry.

909
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,040
What's wrong, Misato?

910
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,040
I can't reach my mom.

911
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,040
I promised her.

912
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,040
She didn't answer.

913
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,040
You can't reach her?

914
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:03,040
I can't forget that incident 22 years ago.

915
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:13,040
Who took the police officer's gun and killed my subordinate?

916
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:20,040
I want to know the truth about what happened.

917
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,040
Now I have SSBC.

918
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,040
I can search what happened.

919
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,040
Please, Rintaro.

920
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,040
Yes.

921
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:42,040
I can't forget that incident 22 years ago.

922
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,040
Haruka.

923
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,040
This is Nanami.

924
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,040
Aoyagi-san.

925
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,040
This is Aoyagi-san.

926
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,040
The atmosphere is different from usual.

927
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:13,040
I've been looking for someone.

928
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,040
And...

929
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,040
I found him.

930
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:35,160
This is a different type of

931
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,040
I found him.

932
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,040
It's true.

933
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,040
Kana-san noticed this man in this interview video.

934
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,040
And he was very angry.

935
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,040
And then he found him on the fifth day.

936
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,040
He chased after him and shot him.

937
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,040
This man took the incident 22 years ago.

938
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:27,420
There is a

939
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,100
This is the last one.

940
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:35,100
The man and Miss Aoyagi disappeared within 50 meters.

941
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,020
Disappeared?

942
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,700
What do you mean?

943
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,980
Miss Aoyagi was kidnapped.

944
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,460
Kidnapped?

945
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,820
Let's go!

946
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,420
Miss Aoyagi was kidnapped.

947
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,660
Who are they?

948
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:02,860
Haruka! Miss Aoyagi!

949
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,420
We tried to identify her face, but we couldn't find any police data.

950
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:09,820
The information was only shared by the chief of the criminal investigation team.

951
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:12,580
I don't think we can get away from the police.
