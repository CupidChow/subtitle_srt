1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,240
I heard about the criminal investigation by the police.

2
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,740
Chief Kuzuhara.

3
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,840
Yes.

4
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,240
Video analysis of the security cameras.

5
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:08,880
Yes.

6
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,980
Data analysis of smartphones and computers.

7
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,640
Face recognition.

8
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,980
What other methods do you use?

9
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,180
We use profiling.

10
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,520
What we're good at is...

11
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,920
Knees.

12
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,320
Knees are for holding.

13
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,960
Profiling is a type of data that appears in American crime dramas.

14
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,560
It predicts the criminal's face from past data.

15
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,660
There's that too.

16
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,500
In Japan, we often use the term,

17
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,000
the term, the profiling.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Profiling?

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yes.

20
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,300
Profiling.

21
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,800
Kizawa is so good at this.

22
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,880
His talk is going to be long.

23
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,680
The investigation method predicts the criminal's location.

24
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,540
It analyzes the criminal's behavior pattern, crime scene,

25
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,320
and profiling characteristics.

26
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,580
It predicts the criminal's high possibility of being in the prison.

27
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,520
So you can find the criminal's location?

28
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,360
The continuous assault case in Adachi last January.

29
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,900
The continuous assault case in Ootaku last September.

30
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:15,900
The continuous

31
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,900
assault case in Chofu last October.

32
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,200
The criminal's behavior is all...

33
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,600
I lost sight of it.

34
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,100
Thank you.

35
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,600
What?

36
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,040
I haven't said anything yet.

37
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,240
Excuse me, can I borrow a chair for a moment?

38
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,840
A chair?

39
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,740
Yes, please.

40
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,020
I'll lend you a chair.

41
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,520
Thank you.

42
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,720
By the way, Mr. Nanami,

43
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,180
I heard that this SSBC criminal investigation

44
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,060
is a newly established department.

45
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,920
Yes.

46
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,220
What's the difference between the old SSBC and this one?

47
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,880
I'm a newbie, so I don't know much about it.

48
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,920
I'm the one who's been doing this for a long time.

49
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,600
This is the sub-department of the investigation department.

50
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,860
By the way, I'm the chief of the investigation department,

51
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,560
Masao Yaegashi, 54 years old.

52
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,440
No, I'm 55 years old this month.

53
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,240
Why is the chief of the investigation department?

54
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,800
It's my job.

55
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,160
But Mr. Nanami Rintaro is a police officer.

56
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,860
Yes.

57
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,000
And he was admitted to the police station

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,300
after passing a test 400 times harder than the average.

59
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,400
Well...

60
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,400
So you're a special team.

61
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,840
Yes, this is a department that's more advanced than the old SSBC.

62
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,540
The investigation department is in charge of the investigation department.

63
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,740
But they support us,

64
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,980
so we need one of the best people in the world.

65
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,640
He's talking too much.

66
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,300
Mr. Igaaki, please go.

67
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,600
Why me?

68
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,800
Maybe Ms. Utsune will see it.

69
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,440
Misato?

70
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,940
Well, as the chief of the investigation department,

71
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,340
my belief is...

72
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,980
Can I say one more thing?

73
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,540
Anyway, we'll do it 100 times.

74
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,280
The digital evidence is not a lie.

75
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,780
Anyway, we'll do it 100 times.

76
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,420
Our investigation is the best.

77
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,560
Okay!

78
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,180
That's enough, right?

79
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:07,820
Okay!

80
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,160
Thank you very much.

81
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,720
Thank you very much, Mr. Nanami.

82
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,660
Thank you very much.

83
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,680
Tissue.

84
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,580
The serial underwear theft that occurred in Sedaga Prefecture in March last year.

85
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,120
The serial hijacking incident that occurred in October.

86
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,960
All of my political profiling played a big role in finding the culprit.

87
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,160
The criminal's actions were all...

88
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,100
...fate.

89
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,700
This is where they gather.

90
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,700
This is what the chief of the investigation department says.

91
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,900
So one of them is a good person.

92
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,060
The police chief is under arrest for SSBC.

93
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,820
What?

94
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,120
The police are investigating every day.

95
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,100
I've never heard of a department like this.

96
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,100
You've been very well interviewed.

97
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,800
Thank you very much.

98
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,660
Well then, tomorrow's weather.

99
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,660
Kumano-suke!

100
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,380
I've talked to the police.

101
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
What's this?

102
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,900
Oh, it's nothing.

103
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,440
It was just a flash.

104
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
Yeah, yeah.

105
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,040
It's good for TV.

106
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,340
That's what I'm talking about.

107
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,540
The tie was great.

108
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,540
The tie?

109
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,440
The chief of the investigation department was very excited.

110
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,440
It was a moment, but he was very excited.

111
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,940
It was a moment, but he was very excited.

112
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,280
I think I've been very good at this.

113
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,480
But...

114
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,580
...the chief of the investigation department.

115
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,040
The chief of the investigation department?

116
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,540
Hello, this is the police.

117
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,440
I'll be right there.

118
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,680
Please wait a moment.

119
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,900
Thank you for waiting.

120
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,360
Thank you very much.

121
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,600
Why are you so nervous?

122
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Yes?

123
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,400
It's a special edition of the SSBC school district.

124
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,840
Are you watching TV right now?

125
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,540
Rintaro was trying to talk, but you were the one who got him to do it.

126
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,940
I was looking forward to seeing you.

127
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,440
I'm sorry.

128
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,740
What are you saying?

129
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,280
Please don't make me look bad.

130
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,120
Yes.

131
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,880
That's why I told you to stop.

132
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,420
Are you the one who got Rintaro and the others to get motivated?

133
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,120
Yes, that's right.

134
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,400
SSBC is a department I made during the time of the police chief.

135
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,740
Yes, of course. I know that.

136
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,440
Now is the time of digital manipulation.

137
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,240
Yes.

138
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,840
Of course.

139
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,840
The real battle is to rely on digital manipulation and reduce the detective's original control.

140
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,680
No, that's not it.

141
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,080
Each of you will show your power and eliminate the crime.

142
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,280
I will eliminate it.

143
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,820
You will respect each other.

144
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,460
I will respect you.

145
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,820
You will not interfere with the SSBC investigation.

146
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,320
I will not interfere.

147
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,380
misunderstanding

148
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,980
Huh

149
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,440
Why did you come?

150
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,500
I think I have a feeling I might lose ...

151
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,600
Jeez...

152
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,920
Da fuck is he doing?

153
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,840
Dogle, mind you!

154
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:38,940
Woman ???

155
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,300
Woman???

156
00:07:45,320 --> 00:08:09,320
The investigation team is the police, the investigation analysis center, the SSPC, the collection analysis of the camera footage, the data analysis of the smartphone and the computer, and the profiling of the suspect.

157
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:18,320
And this time, the investigation team, which is responsible for the murder, robbery, and abduction, has been selected to support the investigation team.

158
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,320
The name is SSPC, the investigation team.

159
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
Good work.

160
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,320
Is it a continuous abduction?

161
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,320
Yes.

162
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,320
This is the third case.

163
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
Is it the work of the German team?

164
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,320
Probably.

165
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,320
Let's go.

166
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,320
What do you mean? Didn't you patrol?

167
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,320
No, of course I was watching, but I'm sorry.

168
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,320
There's no point in attacking the base. I don't know where the other half will light up.

169
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,320
Ten days ago, yesterday, and today, the third case.

170
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,320
You're laughing at us from somewhere. The culprit is in here.

171
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
Take a picture of the victim.

172
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
Yes.

173
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
Thank you for your hard work.

174
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
Yes, I'm sorry.

175
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
SSPC is collecting the camera footage.

177
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
I know.

178
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,320
I'm going.

179
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
Let's go, Mr. Igaki.

180
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
Give me orders one by one.

181
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,320
Yes.

182
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,320
Go to the police station as soon as possible.

183
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,320
Don't order SSPC.

184
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,320
The video of the camera footage near the fire station yesterday.

185
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
And the footage from yesterday.

186
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,320
It's jamming.

187
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
Jamming?

188
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,320
Most of the home security cameras are wirelessly logged into the recorder.

189
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,320
It's being filled with interference.

190
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,320
That kind of machine is being sold illegally.

191
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,320
So the police are going to do that?

192
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
Yes.

193
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,320
But it's not being used in the first case.

194
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:28,340
The culprit chose a place with fewer

195
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,340
people.

196
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:34,340
Is this a woman?

197
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,340
I'll do it again.

198
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,340
This guy.

199
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,340
There are many possibilities.

200
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,340
It's a woman.

201
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,340
It's a woman.

202
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,340
It's a woman.

203
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,340
It's a woman.

204
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,340
It's a woman.

205
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,340
It's a woman.

206
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,340
It's a woman.

207
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,340
It's a woman.

208
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,340
It's a woman.

209
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,340
It's a woman.

210
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,340
It's a woman.

211
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,340
It's a woman.

212
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,340
It's a woman.

213
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,340
It's a woman.

214
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,340
It's a woman.

215
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,340
It's a woman.

216
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,340
It's a woman.

217
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,340
It's a woman.

218
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,340
It's a woman.

219
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,340
It's a woman.

220
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,340
It's a woman.

221
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,340
It's a woman.

222
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,340
It's a woman.

223
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,340
It's a woman.

224
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,340
It's a woman.

225
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,340
It's a woman.

226
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,340
It's a woman.

227
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,340
It's a woman.

228
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,340
It's a woman.

229
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,340
Damn it.

230
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,340
This is the 8th one.

231
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,340
The 8th one.

232
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,340
The first one is the most ridiculous one.

233
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,340
This is the only one we have.

234
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,340
What is this jamming?

235
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,340
Can't you get rid of it?

236
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,340
Like you're removing mosaic.

237
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,340
No, I can't.

238
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,340
At least,

239
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,340
this hood on the woman's face.

240
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,340
It's got a face.

241
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,340
Can't you open it a little more?

242
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,340
I don't have that kind of technology.

243
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,340
What is this?

244
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,340
You're an SSBC.

245
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,340
It's useless.

246
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,340
It's the same for the whole family.

247
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,340
What?

248
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,340
What did you say?

249
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,340
Can't you find the suspect in the emergency room?

250
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,340
The clues from the fire scene verification

251
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,340
don't need to be told to you.

252
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,340
Anyway, we need to find more of this woman.

253
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,340
I've searched everywhere.

254
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,340
Search more.

255
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,340
We're the ones who are after all.

256
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,340
What?

257
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,340
What did you say?

258
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,340
It's not the time to fight.

259
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,340
Stop!

260
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,340
Look.

261
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:15,340
The first case is here.

262
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,340
The second case.

263
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,340
The third case.

264
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,340
The fourth case.

265
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,340
The fifth case.

266
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,340
The sixth case.

267
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,340
The seventh case.

268
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,340
So far, we've got a lot of data.

269
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,340
But this time, the eighth case.

270
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,340
Is this enough?

271
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,340
The data profiling.

272
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,340
What?

273
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,340
The most distant place from the eight fire sites.

274
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,340
This time, we'll connect the first and eighth cases.

275
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,340
If you draw a straight line,

276
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:54,340
you'll see that all other places are close to the fire site.

277
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,340
You're right.

278
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,340
It's been blocked in advance.

279
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,340
There's no crime committed here.

280
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,340
This is also a feature of continuous crime.

281
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,340
So?

282
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,340
Do you know where the fire scene is?

283
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,340
The crime was committed in this donut-shaped area.

284
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,340
In the data profiling,

285
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,340
the culprit is said to not commit any crime near his location.

286
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,340
The area inside is the buffer zone.

287
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,340
Buffer zone?

288
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,340
And if you use the circle fire station,

289
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,340
which is said to have about 70% of the fire incidents in a row,

290
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,340
the culprit's location is within this buffer zone.

291
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,340
And if you use the circle fire station,

292
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,340
which is said to have the culprit's location within the circle,

293
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,340
the location of this fire is probably...

294
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,340
here.

295
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,340
That's amazing, Kizawa-san.

296
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,340
Incredible.

297
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,340
This is the data profiling.

298
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,340
Let's go.

299
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,340
Yes.

300
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,340
Harajiri.

301
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,340
Yes.

302
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,340
Harajiri.

303
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,340
Yes.

304
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,340
Harajiri.

305
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,340
Yes.

306
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,340
Harajiri.

307
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,340
Yes.

308
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,340
Harajiri.

309
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,340
Yes.

310
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,340
Harajiri.

311
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,340
Yes.

312
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,340
What is this?

313
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,340
What do you mean?

314
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,340
A grave?

315
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,340
Yes.

316
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,340
It's a huge grave.

317
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,340
It's a grave.

318
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,340
It was a grave when you looked at the map.

319
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,340
That's what it is.

320
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,340
What's wrong with your data profiling?

321
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,340
The trees in that temple are suspicious.

322
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,340
That's not true.

323
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,340
There was a perfect alibi.

324
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,340
What?

325
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,340
What are we going to do?

326
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,340
There's nothing outside the grave.

327
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,340
Where should we look?

328
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,340
Wait a minute.

329
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,340
Wait a minute.

330
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,340
Oh, right.

331
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,340
Considering the location of the grave,

332
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,340
the center of gravity,

333
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:50,340
the north and west of the grave...

334
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,340
Oh, and the south...

335
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,340
Here it is.

336
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,340
It's all of them.

337
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,340
We have to ask around one by one.

338
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,340
We have to gather the information from one place to another.

339
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,340
Yes.

340
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,340
Excuse me.

341
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,340
Yes.

342
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,340
Can I have a moment?

343
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,340
Yes.

344
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,340
Did you see a dead person?

345
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,340
It's around 11.10 pm.

346
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,340
You're not going out at this time?

347
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,340
I'm not.

348
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,340
Okay.

349
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,340
Hello.

350
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,340
I'm sorry for the trouble.

351
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,340
Okay.

352
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:41,340
I'd like to see the security camera footage.

353
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,340
What?

354
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,340
It's from the police.

355
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,340
You're a suspicious person.

356
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:52,340
When you make ramen, you don't look outside.

357
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,340
I know.

358
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,340
Sorry.

359
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,340
One miso ramen.

360
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,340
One miso ramen.

361
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,340
Thank you.

362
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,340
You're welcome.

363
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,340
It's no good.

364
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,340
I can't find it.

365
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,340
Me too.

366
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,340
Me too.

367
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,340
Does the criminal really move according to the data?

368
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,340
The evidence is in the grave.

369
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,340
We have to believe it.

370
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,340
Believe it?

371
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,340
I saw you on TV the other day.

372
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,340
What?

373
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,340
You said you were my dad.

374
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,340
Oh.

375
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,340
Were you happy?

376
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,340
I thought you were old.

377
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,340
What's that?

378
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,340
We've been dating for a long time.

379
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,340
It's on Sunday.

380
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,340
You have to catch me on the day off.

381
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,340
It's not a date with my daughter.

382
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,340
I'll catch you.

383
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,340
Where are you going on Sunday?

384
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,340
To the amusement park.

385
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,340
Misato is already in middle school.

386
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,340
The amusement park is where she goes with her friends.

387
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,340
Don't talk too much.

388
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,340
I think I'll do it again tonight.

389
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,340
Okay.

390
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,340
The police are on their way to the police station.

391
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,340
I'm doing my best.

392
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,340
That's right.

393
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,340
Surround the area where the fire is expected.

394
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,340
If you see any suspicious people,

395
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,340
you can call the police.

396
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,340
Okay.

397
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,340
I'll be there.

398
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,340
Okay.

399
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,340
I'll be there.

400
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,340
Okay.

401
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,340
I'll be there.

402
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,340
Okay.

403
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,340
I'll be there.

404
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,340
Okay.

405
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,340
I'll be there.

406
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,340
Okay.

407
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,340
I'll be there.

408
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,340
Okay.

409
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,340
I'll be there.

410
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,340
Okay.

411
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,340
An unidentified person has conducted an aggressive job interview

412
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,340
and was arrested for the victim's early arrest.

413
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,340
Please catch me.

414
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,340
A fire has been reported in the fire department

415
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,340
of the 3rd district of Kinosaki, Edogawa Prefecture.

416
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,340
Kinosaki Prefecture?

417
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,340
What?

418
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,340
They're completely separated.

419
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,340
Why?

420
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,340
The fire has been reported in the fire department of the 3rd district of Kinosaki, Edogawa Prefecture.

421
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,340
It's the 9th fire.

422
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,340
Why hasn't the culprit been caught yet?

423
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,340
He's desperately investigating. Look at this paper.

424
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,340
Isn't the investigation policy wrong?

425
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,340
It's not wrong.

426
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,340
There's no way it's wrong.

427
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,340
The residents of the apartment were smothered and burned during the fire.

428
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,340
What do you have to say about that?

429
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,340
I don't think we should talk about that.

430
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,340
If the fire continues, the dead will die.

431
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,340
I know.

432
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,340
Please tell me about the relationship between the fire and the fire.

433
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,340
Nanami.

434
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:18,340
The SSBC's confidential profiling isn't used in this case?

435
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,340
That's...

436
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,340
It was Kizawa, right?

437
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,340
Can't you find a place for the fire department?

438
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,340
I don't think it's easy.

439
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,340
What do you mean?

440
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,340
It's human to commit a crime.

441
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,340
Excuse me.

442
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,340
What does this mean?

443
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,340
It's not the same as your profiling.

444
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,340
And it's the same as yours.

445
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,340
You're being jammed.

446
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,340
The press doesn't report jamming.

447
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,340
Only the culprit knows.

448
00:20:54,340 --> 00:21:00,340
The fact that Kizawa is out of the picture means that the whole thing is wrong.

449
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:06,340
The place where the fire department is based is also completely different.

450
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,340
The profiling is useless.

451
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,340
What kind of SSBC is this?

452
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,340
It's useless.

453
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,340
If...

454
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,340
If there were more samples...

455
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,340
Samples?

456
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,340
Samples?

457
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,340
If there were more samples, we could have a more accurate profiling.

458
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,340
Don't be ridiculous!

459
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,340
Do you know what you're saying?

460
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,340
You're saying that if there were more fire departments!

461
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,340
Wait!

462
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,340
Kizawa said it like that.

463
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,340
The fire department is out of the picture.

464
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,340
People are dying.

465
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,340
Kizawa is just looking at the data here.

466
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,340
He doesn't know how useless the crime is.

467
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,340
That's right.

468
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,340
He doesn't know!

469
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,340
Don't talk!

470
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,340
Don't talk!

471
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,340
Aoyaki-san.

472
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,340
Shut up!

473
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,340
Hey!

474
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,340
Shut up!

475
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,340
Nanami-san, what are you saying?

476
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,340
It has nothing to do with this!

477
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,340
Whether this person is a career manager or a police officer,

478
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,340
or a higher-ups in the department three years later,

479
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,340
how can you say that now?

480
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,340
How? How? How?

481
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,340
The investigation of this case will proceed in one family.

482
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,340
Please don't involve the people behind the scenes anymore.

483
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,340
Aoyaki! Aoyaki!

484
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,340
What's wrong with you today?

485
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,340
You're not always like that.

486
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,340
I'm sorry.

487
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,340
Please forgive me.

488
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,340
I don't think it's a joke.

489
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,340
Really?

490
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,340
Aoyaki-san, you know that you're desperate.

491
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,340
That's right.

492
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,340
We're desperate too.

493
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,340
We're really desperate.

494
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,340
That's why you're angry, Kizawa.

495
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,340
You understand, right?

496
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,340
If this continues,

497
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,340
I'll give you a raise.

498
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,340
I'll show you what a family is like.

499
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,340
Right?

500
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,340
I'm sorry.

501
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,340
I'm sorry.

502
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,340
It's my fault.

503
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,340
You don't have to worry about it, Kizawa-san.

504
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,340
That's right.

505
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,340
Are we going to give up?

506
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,340
Chief Kakari.

507
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,340
There's no way we're giving up, right, Sousa?

508
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,340
We can continue, right?

509
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,340
Of course.

510
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,340
Kizawa TW Franklin

511
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,340
Hideki Sousa

512
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,340
Try and find the woman funny as you can from the flash shower.

513
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:41,340
Wash thoroughly every human point around your house who's been burned up.

514
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,340
Animal pretend can offer you a lot of things from a second-hand store.

515
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,340
A lot of things from a second-hand store!

516
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,340
Let's find one, by using Toolbar's full swept-up understanding.

517
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,340
Okay!

518
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,340
I don't know.

519
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,340
Please look again.

520
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,340
Have you ever seen this woman before?

521
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,340
I really don't know her.

522
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,340
What about your husband?

523
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,340
I don't know.

524
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,340
Right?

525
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,340
I'm home.

526
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,340
Welcome home.

527
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,340
You're still up?

528
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,340
I'm sorry.

529
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,340
I'm sorry.

530
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,340
Welcome home.

531
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,340
You're still up?

532
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,340
Hey, Mom.

533
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,340
Go to sleep.

534
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,340
The internet is going crazy.

535
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,340
What?

536
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,340
The Next Episode

537
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,340
Take responsibility, Kizawa.

538
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,340
This is awful.

539
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,340
You don't have to see this, Kizawa.

540
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,340
No way.

541
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,340
I...

542
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,340
I quit.

543
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,340
SSBC.

544
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,340
What?

545
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,340
I quit being a cop.

546
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,340
Don't think too much.

547
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,340
That's right, Kizawa.

548
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,340
I don't need...

549
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,340
to be useful to this team.

550
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,340
This post is from Albert Sansei.

551
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,340
What?

552
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,340
I checked it.

553
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:38,340
There are a lot of comments about Albert Sansei.

554
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,340
And he was the first one to put Kizawa's name on it.

555
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,340
And he was the first one to write about this fire.

556
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,340
That was on August 10th.

557
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,340
August 10th?

558
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,340
The day before the second fire.

559
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,340
He had been writing about it before the second fire.

560
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,340
But he didn't have a reason to fire you.

561
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,340
Albert Sansei.

562
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,340
Where did he come from?

563
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,340
It's August 10th, 1740.

564
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:29,340
The IP address used is 192.0.265.

565
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,340
265.

566
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,340
It's the 12th booth.

567
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,340
What's the name of the person who used that room?

568
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:40,340
Mr. Ichiro Yamada.

569
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,340
Ichiro Yamada?

570
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,340
Yes.

571
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,340
A man?

572
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,340
May I come in?

573
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,340
I don't know his face.

574
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,340
He's a man.

575
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,340
What do you mean?

576
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,340
It has nothing to do with him.

577
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:06,340
He's a woman in the fire scene.

578
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,340
Even so, I can't ignore this man.

579
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,340
Ichiro Yamada is a secret.

580
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,340
He came to this Internet cafe for the first time.

581
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:19,340
The driver's license was expired.

582
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,340
That's too fast.

583
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,340
So this is the second fire?

584
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:30,340
We need to rethink the basis.

585
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,340
Rethink?

586
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,340
We found the place where he was.

587
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,340
It was 100 meters away from the Internet cafe.

588
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:47,340
Kozu Station is a subway station.

589
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,340
I don't know which station he got off at.

590
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,340
If he's the culprit,

591
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,340
he might be setting the fire for the fire.

592
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,340
The target might be Kizawa.

593
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,340
What?

594
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,340
To trouble Kizawa.

595
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,340
A challenge to Kizawa.

596
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:18,340
Is there a strong enemy or a grudge against Kizawa?

597
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,340
Do you have any idea, Kizawa?

598
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:24,340
Who was the culprit in the past?

599
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:28,340
I came to the SSBC from the general office.

600
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,340
I've never arrested or investigated the victim.

601
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:37,340
You don't get a grudge from the general office, do you?

602
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,340
It's private.

603
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,340
Private?

604
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,340
You took someone's girlfriend?

605
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,340
I only took her.

606
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,340
You bullied someone in the past?

607
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,340
I only bullied her.

608
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:58,340
The place where the fire was on the 9th, the Internet cafe,

609
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,340
the fire outside the circle Kizawa chose,

610
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:06,340
the data of the profiling,

611
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,340
were all intentional.

612
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,340
Intentional?

613
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:16,340
The fire department knew how Kizawa was profiling,

614
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,340
so they chose the place of the fire.

615
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,340
They took the 9th off the map,

616
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,340
and are confusing us.

617
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,340
So you know about the profiling?

618
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,340
I do.

619
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:36,340
How do you learn about the profiling?

620
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,340
I searched online,

621
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,340
but I can't get any expert knowledge.

622
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:50,340
I think that's the only book that comes out of the search.

623
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,340
This one?

624
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,340
Yes.

625
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:00,340
It's a pretty maniac book.

626
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:06,340
Maybe that's where the profiling came from.

627
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,340
The first profiling was on August 2.

628
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,340
In the last three months, 15 books were sold nationwide.

629
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:31,340
Tokyo has one bookstore, three online.

630
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:34,340
You can see the online version on the credit card.

631
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,340
Where's the bookstore?

632
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,340
I'll look it up.

633
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,340
Please.

634
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,340
Oh, hello.

635
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,340
Hello.

636
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,340
Are you working on the operation of the department?

637
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,340
Of course.

638
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,340
The information is getting better.

639
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,340
Good luck.

640
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,340
Have you decided where to go?

641
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,340
What?

642
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:01,340
It's Sunday, the next Sunday.

643
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,340
I don't have time for that.

644
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,340
You do, don't you?

645
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,340
You should be free for the SSBC.

646
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,340
I'll decide.

647
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,340
But it's none of your business.

648
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,340
I'm Misato's mother.

649
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,340
I have to know where my daughter is taken.

650
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,340
Taken?

651
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,340
Lend me your phone.

652
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,340
What?

653
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,340
Your phone.

654
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,340
What?

655
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:23,340
She turns off her own phone's location information service right away.

656
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,340
So turn on your phone.

657
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,340
No.

658
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,340
I don't want to be your friend.

659
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,340
I'm not interested in your place.

660
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,340
I just want to know where Misato is.

661
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,340
If you refuse, I won't let you meet her.

662
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,340
You don't have the right to say that.

663
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,340
I'm serious.

664
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,340
You don't want to know.

665
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,340
Lend me your phone.

666
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,340
Hurry up.

667
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,340
Turn it off.

668
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,340
Next time, you have to convince Misato, not me.

669
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:10,340
If I can do that, I won't do this.

670
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,340
Bye.

671
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,340
Hello?

672
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,340
Mr. Igaaki, the place is in Edogawa Ward.

673
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:29,340
I didn't have a special book, so I bought it in advance.

674
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,340
August 8th.

675
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,340
Three days before the second round of the school festival.

676
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,340
Ah, it's him.

677
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,340
Ah, please stop.

678
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,340
Tanaka was named at the bookstore.

679
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,340
But he's wearing the same hat as the man in the Internet cafe.

680
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,340
He's the same person.

681
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,340
This is the one in the school uniform.

682
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,340
This man appeared at the bookstore.

683
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,340
That's all I could do.

684
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,340
He walked here.

685
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,340
It's good to think that he lives around here.

686
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:26,340
Can you use the data to profile him?

687
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,340
What?

688
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,340
This man got on the cruise ship from the Internet cafe.

689
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:34,340
The closest station to the bookstore is Shinoda.

690
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:46,340
I was here.

691
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,340
Shinoda Station.

692
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,340
The place of the 9th round of the school festival.

693
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,340
Inside this circle.

694
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,340
I found a suspicious person.

695
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,340
What?

696
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,340
This man.

697
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,340
Who is he?

698
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,340
I don't know his name or age yet.

699
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:23,340
But I think his home is in the fifth district of Kinosaki, Edogawa.

700
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,340
How do you know his address?

701
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:30,340
He's a spy.

702
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,340
What?

703
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,340
I can't trust him.

704
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,340
Kuzuhara wrote it.

705
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,340
I believe it.

706
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:45,340
I'm sure he's a spy.

707
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,340
Kuzuhara Karijo.

708
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,340
Chief Ichikawa.

709
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,340
I have good news.

710
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,340
What is it?

711
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:58,340
Mr. Kumiko Togashi, who lives in the first building, has testified.

712
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,340
Togashi?

713
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:03,340
He's a stranger.

714
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:07,340
I asked him last night because he looked suspicious.

715
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,340
He admitted to being a prostitute.

716
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,340
A prostitute?

717
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:16,340
He said he had a breakup with his girlfriend recently.

718
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,340
I thought he was a prostitute.

719
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:23,340
But he pretended not to know because he was afraid of being caught.

720
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,340
I don't know.

721
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,340
What's her name?

722
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,340
Saori Oh, 35 years old.

723
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:34,340
Her address is 712-3, Minami-cho, Musashi-no-Shikichi.

724
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,340
Look.

725
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,340
They're all different from the profile pictures of Kizawa.

726
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,340
Get her out of here.

727
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,340
Yes, sir.

728
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:52,340
I'm sorry.

729
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,340
You're the one who set the fire.

730
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,340
Okay.

731
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:05,340
Why did you set the fire in a place that has nothing to do with it?

732
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:10,340
The reason you continued the fire.

733
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:15,340
I only set the fire in that person's house.

734
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,340
You can't lie to me.

735
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:21,340
You set the fire for your girlfriend's revenge.

736
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:25,340
And you continued the fire to camouflage against the crime.

737
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,340
No, sir!

738
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:32,340
I just hated that person.

739
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:36,340
I was just frustrated.

740
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:39,340
Liar.

741
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,340
Can you trust me?

742
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:49,340
I think they went to the Edo Academy regularly and set the fire.

743
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,340
There were two people in the fire.

744
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,340
Two people.

745
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,340
I think so too.

746
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:03,340
The first one to use the jaming was the second one.

747
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,340
What do you mean?

748
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:09,340
The second one used the first fire.

749
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,340
Used?

750
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:16,340
You mean the king's son-in-law chose the place where the fire was set?

751
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,340
Yes.

752
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:23,340
Using the knowledge of the geological profiling.

753
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:29,340
And he used the 9th sword to trick us.

754
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:38,340
But I don't think the family will accept this theory.

755
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,340
Then let's catch them.

756
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:47,340
Using the new profiling of Mr. Kizawa.

757
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,340
The second fire.

758
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,340
If a man uses the jaming when he leaves the house,

759
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:13,340
he will be killed when he comes near.

760
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,340
Yes.

761
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,340
Police chief, understood.

762
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:20,340
Please make a food order on the first fire.

763
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:26,340
The fire was set from 22 to 24.

764
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,340
The third fire, 15th, 2nd.

765
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:32,340
What is the fire of the tenth fire?

766
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,340
It's coming.

767
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,340
Fire!

768
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,340
Stop!

769
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,340
Stop!

770
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,340
Stop!

771
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,340
This is the police chief.

772
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,340
Yes.

773
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,340
Arrest him!

774
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,340
Why are you here?

775
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:03,340
I bought you for the information service.

776
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,340
Did you buy it?

777
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,340
Let's go.

778
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,340
Yes.

779
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,340
Who?

780
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,340
Mitsuhaki Sakuma, a former high school physics teacher.

781
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:33,340
He was arrested for a robbery in March last year.

782
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:36,340
With Mr. Kizawa's personal profiling.

783
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,340
Is Mr. Kizawa your accomplice?

784
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,340
How do you know Mr. Kizawa?

785
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,340
I saw that TV.

786
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:57,340
The continuous violence trial in September.

787
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:02,200
The serial theft of the

788
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,340
He spoke like he was good.

789
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:08,340
All my personal profiling was used to arrest the criminal.

790
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:12,340
The criminal's actions were all

791
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,340
in my hands.

792
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:25,340
Because of him, I lost everything.

793
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:29,340
My job, my family.

794
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:36,340
So I'm going to steal everything from him.

795
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,340
Sakurami is a good place.

796
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,340
Kizawa!

797
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:54,340
If you're in my head, you should shoot me!

798
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:58,340
You're going to get me involved with the police!

799
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,340
Don't mess with me!

800
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,340
Don't mess with me!

801
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,340
I'm fine.

802
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,340
You idiot!

803
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,340
You idiot!

804
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:22,340
Yesterday, the defendant of the continuous

805
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:25,340
violence trial in Edo was arrested.

806
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:28,340
Sakuma Mitsuaki, 45 years old.

807
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:31,340
He was arrested for a further

808
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,340
violence trial.

809
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:37,340
The suspect's attorney was arrested.

810
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:41,340
I heard that the suspect was arrested by SSBC.

811
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:44,340
But the suspect's attorney was arrested.

812
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:48,340
Was the suspect's profiling limited by SSBC?

813
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,340
It's a good thing.

814
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,340
SSBC did their best.

815
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,340
The investigation team did their best.

816
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,340
But...

817
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,340
But, everyone did their best.

818
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,340
SSBC is also a special investigation team.

819
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,340
The investigation team did their best.

820
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,340
But...

821
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,340
But...

822
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,340
It's not like I'm saying this now, but

823
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:12,340
you're saying it in a bad way.

824
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,340
What?

825
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,340
When Kizawa yelled at you,

826
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:18,340
you didn't have to say that.

827
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:22,340
I really came to my senses at that time.

828
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:27,340
But Kizawa was also a detective.

829
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,340
That's right.

830
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,340
I'll apologize if we meet again.

831
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,340
Okay.

832
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,340
Here he is.

833
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,340
Here he is.

834
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,340
Sorry to keep you waiting.

835
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,340
Give it back by 9 o'clock.

836
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,340
I know.

837
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:43,340
Where are you going today?

838
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,340
Tsukishima.

839
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,340
Let's go eat bonja.

840
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,340
Bonja?

841
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,340
I made an appointment with the best restaurant on the internet.

842
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,340
I have to go now.

843
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,340
Let's go.

844
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,340
Stop it.

845
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,340
You're too excited.

846
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,340
I've already cut the daily information service.

847
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,340
I'm sorry to be monitored by you.

848
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,340
Okay.

849
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,340
Let's go, Misato.

850
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,340
Bonja is delicious.

851
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,340
I know.

852
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:08,340
I recommend mentaiko cheese mochi moja.

853
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,340
That's right.

854
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,340
Have a nice day.

855
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,340
I'm the best.

856
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,340
Let's go.

857
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:20,340
I found a murder case in the Tansui area.

858
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,340
The culprit is also the same as today.

859
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,340
Two children?

860
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,340
I didn't kill him.

861
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,340
This is a good sign.

862
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,340
Did you ask for a murder?

863
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:29,340
I want you to search for evidence that leads to the same period.

864
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:32,340
I want to make sure that your words are not a lie.

865
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,340
This is not you.

866
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:37,340
My son is not involved in crime.

867
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,340
What is this?

868
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,340
Tuna.

869
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,340
Who did you kill?

870
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,340
I need a person like Tamae.

871
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,340
I have to deal with that criminal.

872
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,340
You can't lie.

873
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:49,340
I'm going to solve that case.

874
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,340
I don't know.
