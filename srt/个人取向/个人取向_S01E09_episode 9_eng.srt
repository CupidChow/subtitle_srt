1
00:00:03,787 --> 00:00:07,657
 You can't even love a woman. 
Why do you keep getting in between us?! 

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,400
 Is it all about being able to love a woman? 

3
00:00:13,116 --> 00:00:16,042
 I'm starting to love this woman. 

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,000
 So don't interfere. 

5
00:00:36,618 --> 00:00:39,552
I even trained her for revenge...

6
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,765
Why are you interfering,

7
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,264
Jeon Jin Ho?

8
00:00:50,704 --> 00:00:55,649
Episode 9 
 I'm your man 

9
00:00:59,188 --> 00:01:02,279
Hey, the boss isn't picking up. 
You guys should go home.

10
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:04,024
What kind of situation is he in?

11
00:01:04,024 --> 00:01:05,558
Yeah, he's even missing a meeting.

12
00:01:05,558 --> 00:01:07,399
How should I know?

13
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:11,213
Man... this guy... he's never had 
this kind of problem before.

14
00:01:11,213 --> 00:01:14,060
But what really happened, huh?

15
00:01:14,661 --> 00:01:17,104
He just suddenly jumped up and rushed out.

16
00:01:17,104 --> 00:01:19,624
The Dam Arts Center project problem 
was solved and everything...

17
00:01:19,624 --> 00:01:22,001
There's nothing that could be wrong.

18
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:24,731
Do you think it's a woman problem?

19
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:25,781
A woman?

20
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:29,355
Sure looks that way. Jin Ho hyung is 
a guy who sticks to a fixed schedule,

21
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:33,234
so if he does something out of the ordinary like today,
what other explanation can there be?

22
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:39,608
- Oh, aigoo, hello. 
- Hello.

23
00:01:39,608 --> 00:01:43,813
What can I do? Well... Jin Ho's not here...

24
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:48,359
A while ago, he went without saying 
anything and still hasn't come back.

25
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,434
Well, since you came. 
Would you like a cup of tea?

26
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:54,654
- Alright. Then... 
- This way...

27
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:01,081
Yes?

28
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:04,920
The meeting report has been 
sent through Secretary Kim.

29
00:02:05,544 --> 00:02:07,846
Well, that...

30
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:10,458
Kae In was sick so...

31
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,600
She got into an accident.

32
00:02:13,285 --> 00:02:16,767
Yes, I was with her at the hospital 
and now we're on our way there.

33
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:19,274
Well, I'll see you there.

34
00:02:19,274 --> 00:02:20,646
Yes.

35
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:24,583
Does your father know me?

36
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:25,818
What?

37
00:02:25,818 --> 00:02:27,255
Yes.

38
00:02:27,255 --> 00:02:30,207
He saw you on the day of the wedding.

39
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,935
 Miss Park Kae In, 

40
00:02:34,935 --> 00:02:39,698
  If only I had known earlier that you were
 Park Chul Han's precious daughter, 

41
00:02:39,698 --> 00:02:43,660
 I wouldn't have let things get to this state. 

42
00:02:48,506 --> 00:02:50,888
In a bit, there's a gas station, let's stop by there.

43
00:02:50,888 --> 00:02:53,982
If you're going to take medication, 
you need to eat some food.

44
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:24,829
It's done fueling.

45
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,569
What do you want to eat?

46
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:41,103
Please have a lot.

47
00:03:41,103 --> 00:03:45,584
I too am happy that I have met a good drinking partner.

48
00:03:45,584 --> 00:03:46,746
Is that so?

49
00:03:48,923 --> 00:03:50,804
- Oh, right... 
- Cheers.

50
00:03:50,804 --> 00:03:55,419
Oh, but it seems like you don't drink.

51
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:58,736
- What do you mean? 
- I thought so!

52
00:04:00,068 --> 00:04:02,262
One shot.

53
00:04:05,415 --> 00:04:08,262
But... Can I ask something?

54
00:04:08,262 --> 00:04:09,969
Okay, then...

55
00:04:11,705 --> 00:04:13,887
Bite my neck.
 

56
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:17,849
- I...
- I'm sorry.

57
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,880
By any chance, is Jin Ho dating someone?

58
00:04:22,664 --> 00:04:25,458
Now that I look at it, it seems that you...

59
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,571
have an interest in Jin Ho.

60
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:28,463
Can't I?

61
00:04:28,463 --> 00:04:31,676
Why not? There's no reason not to, 
between a man and a woman.

62
00:04:31,676 --> 00:04:36,157
But it seems like he has no interest in women.

63
00:04:36,157 --> 00:04:40,544
Hey, where in the world is there 
a man who isn't interested in women?

64
00:04:40,544 --> 00:04:42,530
He...

65
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,038
seems faultless,

66
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:47,454
but he's a true man of all men.

67
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:51,356
But, how did he "come out" in front of Chang Ryul?

68
00:04:51,356 --> 00:04:53,071
Work is the enemy.

69
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:59,131
Poor thing... getting misunderstood.

70
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:03,733
Then... is Jin Ho a man who is capable of loving women?

71
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:05,165
Of course.

72
00:05:05,165 --> 00:05:11,139
That Jin Ho is a true 100% man,

73
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:13,289
I can prove it to you.

74
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:16,973
It seems that there's going to be a lot to talk about tonight.

75
00:05:17,913 --> 00:05:19,542
Where are you going?

76
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:24,749
It's worrisome for me to know you're in a house by yourself 
when you're sick. I'll watch you fall asleep and I'll leave.

77
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:26,690
No way!

78
00:05:27,736 --> 00:05:29,433
You see...

79
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:32,933
Don't you dare try to jump bases!

80
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:37,610
Even when I first dated you... it took me 
a while to let you into my house.

81
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,352
I told you all I'm going to do is 
watch you fall asleep and then I'll go.

82
00:05:40,352 --> 00:05:43,679
And, I have to go through the stages 
from the beginning all over again?

83
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:48,058
This time... it... might take... a bit longer.

84
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,514
Okay.

85
00:05:50,514 --> 00:05:52,590
Okay, I'll do as you say.

86
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,085
But then, I'm really curious.

87
00:05:55,852 --> 00:05:59,996
How, in such a small amount of time, 
you could have changed so much.

88
00:05:59,996 --> 00:06:01,833
It was all because of you.

89
00:06:02,457 --> 00:06:06,605
Until now, I've never loved myself.

90
00:06:06,915 --> 00:06:13,476
From now on, I've decided to change and love myself.

91
00:06:14,412 --> 00:06:16,022
I'm going in.

92
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:18,831
I'll change, too.

93
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:23,637
Because back then, I was a man who loved himself too much.

94
00:06:23,637 --> 00:06:28,444
From now on, I'll be a cool guy who loves you more than myself.

95
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:30,586
Kae In!

96
00:06:30,586 --> 00:06:32,101
- Yes? 
- You!

97
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:33,420
Oh, hello.

98
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,672
What are you doing here?

99
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:38,889
I was on my way out of here.

100
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:42,119
Next time, I'll introduce myself more formally.

101
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:44,326
Formally, my ass!

102
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,400
What kind of talk is this?

103
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,080
- Go away! 
- You should go, Chang Ryul.

104
00:06:49,812 --> 00:06:51,614
Kae In, sleep well!

105
00:06:51,614 --> 00:06:53,260
You too, Young Sun!

106
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:21,133
 Kae In, here, drink some water. 

107
00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:42,187
It's me.

108
00:07:42,187 --> 00:07:45,567
Jin Ho, how could you not even call me?

109
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:47,167
Did something happen?

110
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,567
Surely you were surprised by what happened 
earlier while we were on the phone?

111
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:55,013
I had an accident. Some timber suddenly fell 
on top of me and I got stuck underneath.

112
00:07:55,013 --> 00:07:57,129
I even passed out.

113
00:07:57,933 --> 00:07:59,663
Is that so?

114
00:08:01,335 --> 00:08:06,678
Well... I didn't get hurt a lot.

115
00:08:06,678 --> 00:08:08,367
That's fine then.

116
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:11,500
Jin Ho, did something bad happen?

117
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,567
Your voice sounds strange.

118
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:16,833
Nothing happened.

119
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,532
When are you coming home?

120
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:21,476
Tonight, I'm sleeping at the office.

121
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,774
Don't wait up and just go to sleep.

122
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:39,970
What did he say?

123
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,862
He's staying at the office.

124
00:08:43,862 --> 00:08:48,486
Still, it's a little rude...

125
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,433
When I found out I was so shocked. 
 A person got hurt and he doesn't even care.

126
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:52,535
Why wouldn't he care?

127
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,700
He's obviously sorry...

128
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,386
but he has so much work.

129
00:08:57,386 --> 00:09:00,300
That's right, you're not important, 
his work is important.

130
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,225
Aigoo, you sure eat a lot.

131
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:07,608
This is too little food, should I go 
and get you some more?

132
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,004
No.

133
00:09:11,004 --> 00:09:14,433
From now on, I'm going to have manners.

134
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:17,900
What are you up to right now?

135
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,369
From now on...

136
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:23,700
I'm going to be a woman who attracts men.

137
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,349
Don't tell me... you're meeting Han Chang Ryul again?

138
00:09:28,349 --> 00:09:30,333
Don't worry.

139
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,633
I'm not the same Park Kae In.

140
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:36,525
And...

141
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:39,700
if I can't even handle that, I don't think 
I could handle anything.

142
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:43,033
If you can't do that, what can't you get?

143
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:45,500
What, what can't you get?

144
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:54,400
Hello?

145
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,488
 Jin Ho... 

146
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:57,233
 What do I do? 

147
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:58,167
In Hee?

148
00:09:58,167 --> 00:10:01,000
A r-robber broke in...

149
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:05,949
I only have you to call...

150
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:09,633
I don't have the courage to stay alone.

151
00:10:34,006 --> 00:10:35,560
You must have been very shocked.

152
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,113
Are you okay?

153
00:10:40,902 --> 00:10:43,213
Thank you so much for coming, Jin Ho.

154
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,949
You don't know how scared I was.

155
00:10:47,137 --> 00:10:48,833
When I came home...

156
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:51,668
everything was ruined.

157
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:54,342
Calm down.

158
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:57,367
Ah, Jin Ho...

159
00:10:57,367 --> 00:10:59,233
he should just come home and sleep.

160
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,000
Will you be okay alone?

161
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,967
Of course.

162
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:05,470
If it wasn't for my Joon Hyuk I would sleep over.

163
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,942
It's okay. It's late. Hurry home.

164
00:11:06,942 --> 00:11:09,533
Okay, I'm going home. Check all the doors before you sleep.

165
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:10,300
Okay.

166
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:12,236
Don't do that.

167
00:11:13,403 --> 00:11:14,508
Just go.

168
00:11:26,564 --> 00:11:28,633
No matter how much work there is...

169
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,618
His friend is hurt...

170
00:11:31,618 --> 00:11:33,033
and he doesn't even come home.

171
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:35,354
He is a cold friend.

172
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:48,572
I can't call Chang Ryul...

173
00:11:48,572 --> 00:11:53,134
And I can't even call Kae In.

174
00:11:53,705 --> 00:11:55,700
The only person I could think of...

175
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,819
was you.

176
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,458
Then,

177
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,367
I'll be leaving now.

178
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:04,846
You should have some tea before you leave.

179
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:06,633
I have unfinished business to do.

180
00:12:07,032 --> 00:12:08,867
Today...

181
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:11,116
can't you stay here?

182
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:14,100
I don't have the courage to stay alone.

183
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,881
Being alone... is too scary.

184
00:12:17,881 --> 00:12:21,733
A man being in the same house with a woman who lives alone...

185
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:24,020
I think it's going to be uncomfortable.

186
00:12:26,467 --> 00:12:27,860
Jin Ho.

187
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:31,543
Shouldn't that not be an issue with someone like you?

188
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:33,900
And with Kae In...

189
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,749
you're always with her.

190
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:41,365
With Kae In it's okay... but it isn't alright with me?

191
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:44,433
I'm asking you for a favor.

192
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:49,533
I'm really... too scared.

193
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,567
587 sheep... 588 sheep...

194
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:06,433
sheep...

195
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:13,567
One sheep... two sheep...

196
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:24,876
Hey, why is Jin Ho acting like this? 
You know right? Tell me. Answer me, answer me!

197
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:50,367
Please sleep comfortably. 
You should sleep in the guest room.

198
00:14:00,266 --> 00:14:02,500
It seems you're very uncomfortable around me.

199
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,700
The fact that you're uncomfortable... It gives me hope.

200
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,233
I have to get going.

201
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:14,733
Tonight...

202
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:16,895
you agreed to stay here.

203
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,700
It'll soon be daylight.

204
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:21,033
He'll probably think of me as a weird girl.

205
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:24,833
No...

206
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,500
It's between friends, so it's okay.

207
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,967
Hey. I'm sorry!

208
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:41,433
I'm really sorry.

209
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:42,967
So what is it this time?

210
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:46,433
Were you late because you got absorbed?

211
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:50,133
Yesterday, In Hee came by looking for you.

212
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:54,433
You weren't here so we went out to drink.

213
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:55,833
In Hee?

214
00:15:57,267 --> 00:16:00,833
I thought she was snooty, 
but she's unexpectedly easy going.

215
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,900
She makes beer and soju mixture at a golden ratio.

216
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,546
She's exactly my style.

217
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:04,900
What did you talk about?

218
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,700
We talked about everything.

219
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,533
We even talked about you.

220
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:10,633
What about me?

221
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:16,467
Well... you see... I drank a lot then 
so I don't really remember.

222
00:16:16,467 --> 00:16:20,507
Hey, but why are you wearing the same clothes 
from yesterday? Did you not go home?

223
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:23,633
Oh, it just happened that way.

224
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:26,100
You just ran out of here. 
And I couldn't even contact you!

225
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,300
It's strange...

226
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,700
What do you mean? What's strange?

227
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,100
I was busy working.

228
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,635
Really?

229
00:16:31,635 --> 00:16:33,633
Did you get anything?

230
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:35,900
It's been a while since you entered Sang Go Jae.

231
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,300
And Chang Ryul isn't going to just stay still.

232
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,367
Have you seen its blueprint by any chance?

233
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:45,433
If we had the blueprint, 
we wouldn't have to have a hard time like now.

234
00:16:45,433 --> 00:16:47,500
Did you take some pictures?

235
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:49,700
They don't allow pictures.

236
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,567
Just because they don't let you, how can you not?

237
00:16:52,967 --> 00:16:59,167
Hey, if it's too difficult, take Kae In and go 
somewhere. I'll go in secretly and take photos.

238
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:00,333
Do you have to go to that extent?

239
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,633
What can't we do when we came this far?

240
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:05,900
We might not even meet the deadline at this rate.

241
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,100
Are you doing this because of Kae In?

242
00:17:11,207 --> 00:17:15,733
Well, when you leave Sang Go Jae, 
you won't be able to see her again anyway

243
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,700
Wait...

244
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,100
Have you... maybe... 
developed some special feelings for Kae In?

245
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:28,033
Hey... you haven't, have you?

246
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,633
There's a visitor.

247
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:42,567
Hello.

248
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:45,433
What brings you here so early in the morning?

249
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:08,967
I brought you some underwear and socks.
 You're a stickler for cleanliness, so I thought you'd feel 
miserable  wearing the same things from yesterday.

250
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:10,978
So...

251
00:18:10,978 --> 00:18:12,832
you went through my drawers?

252
00:18:12,832 --> 00:18:16,167
We're friends, so there's nothing to be embarrassed about.

253
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:22,232
There was no need to go to such trouble over nothing.

254
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:24,700
"Thank you".

255
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:28,300
In these situations, you're supposed to say, "Thank You."

256
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,433
Thank you.

257
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:35,167
You feel guilty, don't you?

258
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:36,233
What?

259
00:18:36,233 --> 00:18:43,633
Even though I was hurt and you didn't come home,
I went to such lengths to get clothes and food for my workaholic friend...

260
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:44,767
Doesn't it make you feel guilty?

261
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:47,500
Not in the slightest.

262
00:18:48,267 --> 00:18:53,167
I got seriously hurt. 
It could have been a forever farewell.

263
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:59,000
Someone who is out of her mind 
like Park Kae In doesn't die that easily.

264
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,500
Wow...

265
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,867
That was too much...

266
00:19:02,867 --> 00:19:07,967
Would it kill you for you to say that you couldn't come home because of work even though you were worried about me?

267
00:19:09,067 --> 00:19:11,033
Why do I need to worry?

268
00:19:14,267 --> 00:19:18,633
Isn't your focus only on revenge right now?

269
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,633
Revenge is revenge, and friendship is friendship.

270
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:27,570
Focus on what you want. 
Don't think about anything else.

271
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,709
I need to work, so you should get going.

272
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:40,318
Other than succeeding in work, 
you have no interest in anything else, do you?

273
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,542
Yes, that's right.

274
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:51,733
I'm going. Work very hard.

275
00:20:09,682 --> 00:20:12,649
Would it have killed him to ask how badly I was hurt?

276
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:16,074
How can a person be so heartless?

277
00:20:16,074 --> 00:20:18,388
I'm an idiot, doing that for him.

278
00:20:18,388 --> 00:20:19,998
Knock, knock.

279
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:23,829
Oh! Director Choi...

280
00:20:23,829 --> 00:20:25,027
What's wrong with your forehead?

281
00:20:25,027 --> 00:20:28,122
I got a little hurt yesterday...

282
00:20:28,122 --> 00:20:30,256
It's nothing serious, so there's nothing to worry about.

283
00:20:30,256 --> 00:20:32,749
You should've been more careful...

284
00:20:32,749 --> 00:20:36,646
But, what are you making? You're making a lot of the same thing...

285
00:20:36,646 --> 00:20:38,497
These are for a partition.

286
00:20:38,497 --> 00:20:39,825
A partition?

287
00:20:39,825 --> 00:20:43,322
I'm going to connect them all and make it like a wall.

288
00:20:43,322 --> 00:20:46,069
Oh. It's very colorful so I think the kids will like it.

289
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:49,425
I heard that diverse colors stimulate a child's brain.

290
00:20:49,425 --> 00:20:51,811
I feel that it'll match the gallery concept very well.

291
00:20:51,811 --> 00:20:53,530
Good idea.

292
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,961
And also, thank you.

293
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:03,536
For solving Jin Ho's problem. And... 
for agreeing not to leave.

294
00:21:03,536 --> 00:21:05,229
I should be the one thanking you.

295
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:08,486
The way you said "fighting!" gave me a great boost.

296
00:21:08,486 --> 00:21:10,946
How about a morning coffee? I'd love to treat you.

297
00:21:10,946 --> 00:21:12,400
Free coffee sounds good.

298
00:21:13,526 --> 00:21:14,855
Let's go.

299
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,128
Here you go.

300
00:21:17,128 --> 00:21:18,826
Thank you.

301
00:21:21,121 --> 00:21:23,233
It tastes great.

302
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:26,401
Free coffee is delicious, right?

303
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:29,301
Kae In,

304
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,291
do you know what's great about one-sided love?

305
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,794
One-sided love?

306
00:21:34,764 --> 00:21:36,446
You don't have to spend money.

307
00:21:36,446 --> 00:21:40,803
You see exchanging gifts when you are a couple 
is expensive. That is why you spend a lot.

308
00:21:40,803 --> 00:21:43,250
No promises... and lots of freedom too...

309
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,680
You don't have to concern yourself with the 
other person constantly so there's no nuisance.

310
00:21:47,835 --> 00:21:51,818
Not expecting anything from the other person... 
that is why it's better to view the other person from afar.

311
00:21:52,724 --> 00:21:54,501
Whenever I want to,

312
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:57,286
I can end it anytime.

313
00:21:57,286 --> 00:22:00,465
Because I'd be the only one who got hurt.

314
00:22:02,582 --> 00:22:06,473
It seems you know more about one-sided love than I do.

315
00:22:07,187 --> 00:22:09,425
That's my specialty.

316
00:22:11,183 --> 00:22:14,636
Are you experiencing it right now, one-sided love?

317
00:22:16,766 --> 00:22:19,574
I can't tell if it's really love,

318
00:22:19,574 --> 00:22:23,291
but there's someone I keep thinking and worrying about.

319
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:28,860
But I feel I might be a burden to him, 
so I'm trying hard not to be.

320
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,681
That can't be easy.

321
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:35,991
That's why I'm trying to put my heart into something else.

322
00:22:35,991 --> 00:22:39,675
My brain's not up to focussing on two things at once.

323
00:22:41,317 --> 00:22:44,071
I guess I should try that as well.

324
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,800
So you've a one-sided love, too?

325
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
Probably.

326
00:22:52,213 --> 00:22:58,744
All the same, when people say one-sided love is fine, it's like they don't have the courage that shared love takes.

327
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:04,413
The person you love...

328
00:23:04,413 --> 00:23:08,592
It may not be that they don't love you back.

329
00:23:08,592 --> 00:23:12,615
He might just want to be acknowledged in his career first.

330
00:23:12,615 --> 00:23:16,690
Or he might be concerned about being a burden to you.

331
00:23:18,045 --> 00:23:23,151
When I come to think about it, 
the man I know may be like that.

332
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,499
Are you advising me not to pack it in?

333
00:23:26,499 --> 00:23:30,091
Isn't that something you only do 
when you're sending a parcel?

334
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,812
Thanks for the lesson in one-sided love.

335
00:23:35,812 --> 00:23:39,099
Fighting! Make your one-sided love teacher proud.

336
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,449
Are you here for a meeting?

337
00:23:56,449 --> 00:23:58,146
Yes.

338
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:03,775
Aren't you tired?

339
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,924
It seems you didn't sleep well at my house.

340
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,200
I was worried all day in case it affected your work.

341
00:24:12,226 --> 00:24:13,463
I'm okay.

342
00:24:13,463 --> 00:24:15,335
Then that's a relief.

343
00:24:15,335 --> 00:24:18,313
Do you have anything after the meeting?

344
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:39,799
When do you plan to bring the Sang Go Jae lady over?

345
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:42,751
It's not the right time yet...

346
00:24:42,751 --> 00:24:46,682
Hey... There's not much time left until the Dam Arts Center Project.

347
00:24:46,682 --> 00:24:49,117
How long do you plan to stall like that?

348
00:24:49,117 --> 00:24:52,399
A person's heart isn't so easily controlled...

349
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:56,633
You said you even went to the hospital with her...

350
00:24:56,633 --> 00:24:59,482
At times like that, be generous with gifts.

351
00:24:59,482 --> 00:25:03,166
If you just put in a little talk here and there, 
what kind of girl doesn't fall for that?

352
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:04,994
Kae In is not that kind of girl.

353
00:25:04,994 --> 00:25:06,233
Aigoo...

354
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:12,374
You just don't know anything about girls. 
Girls are all just the same.

355
00:25:12,374 --> 00:25:17,193
You still don't know after seeing how I handle women.

356
00:25:17,193 --> 00:25:19,384
You want me to live like you?

357
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:21,987
I'm just saying that you shouldn't get swayed by girls.

358
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:25,134
Kae In's heart is still very scarred.

359
00:25:25,134 --> 00:25:28,233
So I want to be more honest about everything.

360
00:25:28,233 --> 00:25:30,433
I said there's no time!

361
00:25:31,433 --> 00:25:33,729
Man, that young lady, really...

362
00:25:33,729 --> 00:25:38,242
After all that I said to her 
she should have understood by now.

363
00:25:38,242 --> 00:25:40,633
So how come she still hasn't got it?

364
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,133
Did you meet with Kae In?

365
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:46,500
Yes, I met her.

366
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,600
Is that wrong?

367
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,689
What did you say to her, huh?

368
00:25:49,689 --> 00:25:50,866
What did you say to her?!

369
00:25:50,866 --> 00:25:53,666
I told her that if only I'd known 
she was Professor Park's daughter,

370
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:55,571
I wouldn't have acted the way I did,

371
00:25:55,571 --> 00:25:58,753
and I was sorry! What's wrong with that?

372
00:25:58,753 --> 00:26:00,233
Father,

373
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:03,966
please don't try to control my life!

374
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,566
This is a file on architects whose designs are to my taste.

375
00:26:16,566 --> 00:26:18,433
I thought they would be beneficial to you.

376
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:28,700
You're reluctant to accept because you feel 
my help would make the competition unfair?

377
00:26:29,533 --> 00:26:30,671
That's right.

378
00:26:31,527 --> 00:26:38,786
It's just out of concern for a friend 
who'd have to engage in an unfair fight.
And this file won't play a key role or anything.

379
00:26:38,786 --> 00:26:42,333
I'm most grateful, but I'm not going to accept these.

380
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:46,533
Even if I'm at a disadvantage, 
I want to win through my own efforts.

381
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,579
It seems I've gone a little too far.

382
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:56,600
Despite predicting that you might refuse,

383
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:01,365
calling you here like this...

384
00:27:02,793 --> 00:27:05,509
Huh... Well ...

385
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,244
I was bored.

386
00:27:08,433 --> 00:27:10,246
Yes?

387
00:27:11,933 --> 00:27:15,166
In my position,

388
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:19,886
there's no one who can make me laugh. 
I eat alone everyday.

389
00:27:19,886 --> 00:27:23,333
So I've grown isolated.

390
00:27:26,861 --> 00:27:30,733
Just think of it as a foolish friend doing a foolish thing.

391
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:32,633
I will.

392
00:27:32,633 --> 00:27:37,533
Then from now on, I can do such foolish things 
every now and then when I'm bored, right?

393
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:42,220
Alright, just so long as it's always with a pinch of salt.

394
00:27:42,991 --> 00:27:48,176
Fine. I'll try to make sure it's properly 
seasoned from now on. I'll give it a try.

395
00:27:55,866 --> 00:27:58,133
Like this...

396
00:27:58,133 --> 00:28:00,932
we are getting to know about each other...

397
00:28:00,932 --> 00:28:03,675
little by little, right?

398
00:28:06,033 --> 00:28:12,200
Park Kae In said that one-sided love is something to do 
because you have no courage to love one another .

399
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,533
My foolish behavior today,

400
00:28:14,533 --> 00:28:17,533
I, in my own way,

401
00:28:17,533 --> 00:28:20,400
had to gather much courage.

402
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:29,866


403
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:36,866
Chang Ryul...

404
00:28:36,866 --> 00:28:41,000
Now that I think about it, 
I've never given you flowers.

405
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:47,600
Since we're starting over, 
I thought I'd better do it right.

406
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:55,381
What is this... making me embarrassed? 
Aren't you gonna take it?

407
00:28:55,381 --> 00:28:57,130
- Here. 
- Yeah.

408
00:28:59,866 --> 00:29:03,213
Ah, man, this is really embarrassing.

409
00:29:03,213 --> 00:29:04,400
Smell them.

410
00:29:08,528 --> 00:29:11,496
Congratulations, Kae In.

411
00:29:16,817 --> 00:29:18,217
I mean it! Congratulations.

412
00:29:20,154 --> 00:29:24,416
Isn't this what you've always dreamed would happen?

413
00:29:25,355 --> 00:29:29,199
Now that I've left, things are turning your way, aren't they?

414
00:29:29,821 --> 00:29:31,376
Chang Ryul,

415
00:29:31,376 --> 00:29:35,313
I thought that because of me, you would hesitate,

416
00:29:35,313 --> 00:29:37,553
but I see you soon found yourself a safe harbor.

417
00:29:37,553 --> 00:29:38,760
Then...

418
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,575
have a good time.

419
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:44,017
Let's not get in the way of these two.

420
00:29:44,017 --> 00:29:46,591
Quick, let's make ourselves scarce.

421
00:29:54,689 --> 00:29:56,311
Let's go.

422
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:02,073
Still, it's a relief.

423
00:30:02,073 --> 00:30:05,970
That Kae In and Chang Ryul are meeting again.

424
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:14,201
Kae In has become quite pretty, right?

425
00:30:14,201 --> 00:30:18,077
That shows it's true that being loved makes a woman pretty.

426
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:25,298
 Congratulations, Kae In. 

427
00:30:28,521 --> 00:30:31,857
This is the best restaurant near my work.

428
00:30:31,857 --> 00:30:35,011
Do you like the food?

429
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,733
Jin Ho...

430
00:30:37,733 --> 00:30:40,370
Ah... Yes.

431
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:44,264
For a thank you gift for helping 
me yesterday, it's pretty small.

432
00:30:44,264 --> 00:30:47,143
To make up for that, 
can I invite you over to my place for a drink?

433
00:30:47,143 --> 00:30:49,279
I've got some really good liquor, you know.

434
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,887
I don't think I can accept.

435
00:30:53,087 --> 00:30:55,995
Excuse me a moment.

436
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,412
Are you not feeling well?

437
00:31:12,887 --> 00:31:15,402
I got such a fright yesterday

438
00:31:15,402 --> 00:31:17,561
that I couldn't seem to settle down,

439
00:31:17,561 --> 00:31:20,840
so I went to the hospital and got some medication.

440
00:31:21,323 --> 00:31:25,270
I'm still really scared about going back home today.

441
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:28,800
I'm wondering what else might happen there,

442
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,916
so I'm frightened.

443
00:31:33,745 --> 00:31:35,587
Couldn't you stay with me

444
00:31:35,587 --> 00:31:38,557
for just one night more?

445
00:31:56,517 --> 00:31:59,811
Please go in.

446
00:32:03,862 --> 00:32:06,730
Jin Ho...

447
00:32:15,936 --> 00:32:19,076
Just what are you up to?

448
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:22,663
Is it because you don't like women?

449
00:32:22,663 --> 00:32:23,824
Or is it because you don't like me?

450
00:32:23,824 --> 00:32:27,042
I really don't understand why you're acting this way.

451
00:32:27,042 --> 00:32:29,311
Think of it as the start of my campaign.

452
00:32:29,311 --> 00:32:32,763
I intend to be part of your life from now on,

453
00:32:32,763 --> 00:32:34,675
so letting you know that I've started

454
00:32:34,675 --> 00:32:35,596
seemed to be the right thing to do.

455
00:32:35,596 --> 00:32:36,733
That isn't going to happen.

456
00:32:36,733 --> 00:32:40,480
I've made a mistake in the past, 
but I won't make the same mistake twice.

457
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,151
Then you've picked the wrong person.

458
00:32:42,151 --> 00:32:43,080
No.

459
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,281
This time,

460
00:32:44,281 --> 00:32:46,679
I'm certain that I've chosen right.

461
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:49,419
So, I plan to grab on to you tight.

462
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:51,881
You've made the wrong choice.

463
00:32:51,881 --> 00:32:53,506
Goodbye now...

464
00:32:53,506 --> 00:32:57,375
You'll find out that you and I are the same sort of person.

465
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:01,529
Getting everything we want using whatever means.

466
00:33:07,234 --> 00:33:10,624

467
00:33:14,218 --> 00:33:16,633
I feel anxious.

468
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,677
Oh, I feel so anxious.

469
00:33:24,666 --> 00:33:26,982
Aren't you going home?

470
00:33:26,982 --> 00:33:30,268
What are you doing pacing to and fro?

471
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,877
Let's go to Sang Go Jae.

472
00:33:34,877 --> 00:33:36,267
At this time?

473
00:33:36,267 --> 00:33:37,200
Why?

474
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,367
Did Jin Ho send for us?

475
00:33:38,367 --> 00:33:39,800
No, no.

476
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,918
You gotta work the night shift tonight.

477
00:33:42,918 --> 00:33:44,343
Hey hey, don't go.

478
00:33:44,343 --> 00:33:46,667
Hey, hey! Sto- Stop!

479
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:48,398
Hey hey hey!

480
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:50,852
Stop...

481
00:33:50,852 --> 00:33:52,285
Hey, please.

482
00:33:52,285 --> 00:33:53,624
Can't you just understand what I'm saying for once?

483
00:33:53,624 --> 00:33:54,900
Why would I go there?

484
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,133
I told you, you have to go! I'm begging you.

485
00:34:00,658 --> 00:34:02,841
Why are those two like that?

486
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:06,267
Does Sang Jun really like men?

487
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,202
You're that tired. So tired you can't eat?

488
00:34:40,202 --> 00:34:41,767
Yeah.

489
00:34:41,767 --> 00:34:43,870
Is it because you were so shocked yesterday?

490
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,257
You need to take a tonic.

491
00:34:45,257 --> 00:34:47,121
I'll bring some herb medicine tomorrow.

492
00:34:47,121 --> 00:34:48,236
Forget it.

493
00:34:48,236 --> 00:34:49,104
I'm going in.

494
00:34:49,104 --> 00:34:51,533
Ah, wa-

495
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,367
I heard you met my dad.

496
00:34:57,222 --> 00:34:58,200
Kae In...

497
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,437
I'm not sure what  happened, 
but that's all a misunderstanding.

498
00:35:00,437 --> 00:35:04,467
It's not because of my father that I came back to you.

499
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:05,628
Please believe me.

500
00:35:05,628 --> 00:35:10,179
Why should I believe that?

501
00:35:10,179 --> 00:35:13,151
I'm not a guy who's that calculating.

502
00:35:13,151 --> 00:35:16,611
If I had returned to you because 
you were Park Chul Han's daughter,

503
00:35:16,611 --> 00:35:19,258
I'd never have broken up with you in the first place. 
Don't you see that?

504
00:35:19,258 --> 00:35:24,071
It's not that your company suddenly needs my father?

505
00:35:24,452 --> 00:35:26,000
It's really not like that.

506
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,965
That's what my father wants!

507
00:35:27,965 --> 00:35:28,900
I'm really not like that!

508
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,000
As things are now, you can't expect me to believe it.

509
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,224
You really think it's something you could make me believe?

510
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,100
Okay.

511
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:40,093
I'll stop making excuses for myself.

512
00:35:40,093 --> 00:35:44,387
If you can't believe it, you don't have to.

513
00:35:47,533 --> 00:35:52,333
Right now, I'm really tired and I'm worn out.

514
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:52,433
I'm going in.

515
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,354
Hyung, have you gone crazy?

516
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,054
I'm crazy.

517
00:36:31,054 --> 00:36:34,147
If I wasn't crazy, do you think I could even have 
imagined doing something like this?

518
00:36:34,147 --> 00:36:35,067
Hyung, let's not do it.

519
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,487
I'm feeling guilty...

520
00:36:36,487 --> 00:36:39,067
Do you not know how important this is to us?

521
00:36:39,067 --> 00:36:40,017
Huh?

522
00:36:40,017 --> 00:36:42,867
This is the future of our company!

523
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:42,967
So we'll leave the outcome for Heaven to decide.

524
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:47,400
So let's look around before Jin Ho gets here, okay?

525
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,800
Ah, I can't do it.

526
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,233
Do what you want.

527
00:36:50,233 --> 00:36:52,033
Jin Ho is like that, and so are you!

528
00:36:52,033 --> 00:36:55,679
Is making a fool out of a woman that much fun?

529
00:36:56,067 --> 00:36:57,133
You punk!

530
00:36:57,133 --> 00:36:59,100
Does taking some pictures make Kae In a fool?

531
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,366
I don't know. When Jin Ho gets here, do it with him.

532
00:37:00,366 --> 00:37:03,100
This is where Jin Ho lives!

533
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,800
It was here?

534
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,333
The place where Jin Ho oppa lives?

535
00:37:23,433 --> 00:37:25,800
How come you're here?

536
00:37:26,867 --> 00:37:28,100
It wasn't me.

537
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,600
I didn't say a thing.

538
00:37:30,938 --> 00:37:32,900
What are you guys doing, not going in?

539
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:36,067
Wait, wait, wait!

540
00:37:39,232 --> 00:37:40,300
Why are you two like this?

541
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,769
Are you hiding something from me?

542
00:37:41,769 --> 00:37:43,600
No, we aren't hiding anything.

543
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,267
There's nothing like that. We're just...

544
00:37:46,267 --> 00:37:49,000
Th-Th-That woman!

545
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,533
Hide!

546
00:37:52,533 --> 00:37:54,567
What is this? It's that girl again!

547
00:37:54,567 --> 00:37:55,467
SHhhhhh!

548
00:37:55,467 --> 00:37:57,800
That can't be! Is Jin Ho oppa living with that woman?

549
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,633
No no no!  Why would he do anything like that?

550
00:38:00,633 --> 00:38:03,133
Hey hey hey!!! Calm down!

551
00:38:03,133 --> 00:38:06,000
How can I be calm when Jin Ho oppa 
is living with another woman?!

552
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:07,876
He even took her along as his date.

553
00:38:07,876 --> 00:38:10,714
No, I'm telling you that Jin Ho isn't in that 
kind of relationship with that woman!

554
00:38:10,714 --> 00:38:14,033
I'm telling you that's not it!!! THAT'S NOT IT!!!!!

555
00:38:16,767 --> 00:38:19,267
You go home.

556
00:38:19,267 --> 00:38:21,700
Take her home.

557
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,767
I'll do it alone.

558
00:38:32,467 --> 00:38:35,000
Aigoo...

559
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,767
This punk left a very important document.

560
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:41,067
Sorry, it's just so late.

561
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:42,600
It can't be helped.

562
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,400
Then just go and wait in Jin Ho's room.

563
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,967
Actually...

564
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:50,133
if it's okay with you, can I look around Sang Go Jae?

565
00:38:51,032 --> 00:38:51,932
Pardon?

566
00:38:51,932 --> 00:38:54,784
I meant, living in a place like this,

567
00:38:54,784 --> 00:38:56,691
is actually my dream.

568
00:38:58,023 --> 00:39:02,098
With a foxy little wife and kids like cute little bunnies...

569
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:05,755
Your dream?!

570
00:39:06,356 --> 00:39:08,211
Well, that's my mother's dream.

571
00:39:09,595 --> 00:39:15,969
So, I'm saying I can't fulfill my mother's dreams.

572
00:39:17,432 --> 00:39:20,436
It must have been very hard for you.

573
00:39:22,082 --> 00:39:24,877
I thought Jin Ho was the only one having a hard time.

574
00:39:24,877 --> 00:39:28,064
I didn't think of you having a hard time as well.

575
00:39:28,064 --> 00:39:29,683
I'm sorry.

576
00:39:32,687 --> 00:39:38,095
If I could only drink a cup of hot tea, 
I think I would feel better.

577
00:39:38,095 --> 00:39:41,308
Just wait a few minutes, 
I'll get a cup of tea for you right away.

578
00:39:41,308 --> 00:39:43,708
Do you have Job's Tears tea?

579
00:39:50,132 --> 00:40:14,100


580
00:40:22,764 --> 00:40:24,293
- Is someone here? 
- Sang Jun's here.

581
00:40:25,611 --> 00:40:28,111
Where is he?

582
00:40:28,111 --> 00:40:30,784
He was here just a while ago.

583
00:40:48,625 --> 00:40:50,036
What are you doing?

584
00:40:50,036 --> 00:40:52,427
Can't you tell? I'm working.

585
00:40:53,615 --> 00:40:54,764
Stop.

586
00:40:54,764 --> 00:40:59,388
Why not? Why won't you let me? 
Remember why you came here.

587
00:40:59,388 --> 00:41:02,104
Is it really true that you're coming to have feelings for Kae In?

588
00:41:02,104 --> 00:41:04,638
To the point you can't separate work and pleasure?

589
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,232
That's right.

590
00:41:06,232 --> 00:41:08,087
I can't make that distinction.

591
00:41:08,296 --> 00:41:10,202
Get your head straight, you punk!

592
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:12,789
You know how important this is.

593
00:41:12,789 --> 00:41:14,069
I know that.

594
00:41:14,069 --> 00:41:15,976
It's because I know it that I'm being this way.

595
00:41:16,446 --> 00:41:19,241
Why do I have to hurt others so that I can succeed?

596
00:41:19,893 --> 00:41:21,775
Hurt? Who's getting hurt?

597
00:41:21,775 --> 00:41:23,238
Do you really need to ask that?

598
00:41:23,693 --> 00:41:28,227
What I'm doing right now hurts Park Kae In twice over.

599
00:41:29,899 --> 00:41:31,427
Have your feelings really...

600
00:41:31,427 --> 00:41:33,164
gone so far?

601
00:41:33,427 --> 00:41:35,776
Can you give up your work for a girl?

602
00:41:40,766 --> 00:41:42,027
Sang Jun...

603
00:41:53,627 --> 00:41:56,230
What are you doing here?

604
00:41:59,496 --> 00:42:01,220
Where did Sang Jun go?

605
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,575
Did you two fight?

606
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,863
What is it?

607
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:20,629
I have something to tell you.

608
00:42:22,953 --> 00:42:26,327
If it's what I think, then I don't want to hear it.

609
00:42:26,327 --> 00:42:28,493
How do you know what I'm going to say?

610
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,358
Even if you don't want to hear it, listen anyways.

611
00:42:32,358 --> 00:42:34,761
If I don't tell you today, I don't know when I ever will tell you.

612
00:42:41,918 --> 00:42:48,423
I... The reason why I came into Sang Go Jae...

613
00:42:54,893 --> 00:42:57,043
Puss-puss!!  Kitty-kitty!

614
00:43:00,021 --> 00:43:02,451
Kae In, do you have a cat?

615
00:43:03,496 --> 00:43:04,619
A cat?

616
00:43:04,906 --> 00:43:08,893
Over there, I saw an extremely cute cat...

617
00:43:09,765 --> 00:43:10,893
It looked like you!

618
00:43:10,893 --> 00:43:13,427
Was it a stray, maybe?

619
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:16,827
I doubt it. It looked like you. 
It had a pretty ribbon on, too.

620
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:20,560
It did seem like it was going hungry... Does that mean it's lost?

621
00:43:20,841 --> 00:43:23,845
Poor thing. Where was it?

622
00:43:23,845 --> 00:43:28,760
Oh, that! It was just over there, at the end.

623
00:43:30,693 --> 00:43:33,093
Please, don't do it. Don't say a word.

624
00:43:33,093 --> 00:43:33,827
Hyung...

625
00:43:33,827 --> 00:43:38,027
Please... If you say one more word, I'm going to die.

626
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,653
There's no cat.

627
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:45,360
Really? Then it must have gone home.

628
00:43:46,258 --> 00:43:47,027
Poor thing.

629
00:43:47,027 --> 00:43:48,693
Oh, where's the tea?

630
00:43:48,893 --> 00:43:50,568
It's all cold now.

631
00:43:50,568 --> 00:43:52,160
Still, I can do a one shot.

632
00:44:08,305 --> 00:44:11,160
Be sensible, Hye Mi. Be sensible.

633
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,903
What... Hye Mi, what's wrong?

634
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:15,160
Mom, Jin Ho oppa and a girl--

635
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:16,893
No, no. Nothing's wrong.

636
00:44:16,893 --> 00:44:18,627
Jin Ho oppa is living with a girl!

637
00:44:18,627 --> 00:44:19,642
What?

638
00:44:20,427 --> 00:44:22,829
I feel so bad for Jin Ho hyung.

639
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:27,960
He's only living with that girl 
because he needs to succeed!

640
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,580
What does living with a girl have to do with succeeding?

641
00:44:33,592 --> 00:44:36,779
Well you see, succeeding is... Uhh...

642
00:44:36,779 --> 00:44:38,227
Don't try to deceive us.

643
00:44:38,503 --> 00:44:41,960
I'm going to find out why he's living there.

644
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:55,927
 Aren't you tired? 

645
00:44:57,228 --> 00:44:59,736
 It seems you didn't sleep well at my house. 

646
00:45:02,479 --> 00:45:04,203
I guess you're really busy.

647
00:45:04,793 --> 00:45:07,193
Seeing that you're bringing your work home.

648
00:45:07,193 --> 00:45:09,793
Or are you just pretending to be busy?

649
00:45:11,127 --> 00:45:14,793
 Now that I think about it, 
I've never given you flowers as a gift. 

650
00:45:16,611 --> 00:45:17,860
Congratulations.

651
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,149
About receiving flowers from a guy.

652
00:45:23,351 --> 00:45:25,460
Dry them and treasure them for a long time.

653
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,193
What's with the sarcasm?

654
00:45:27,727 --> 00:45:30,064
You know very well what I set out to do.

655
00:45:30,064 --> 00:45:33,199
I really do want to congratulate you.

656
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:35,060
Maybe I didn't say it the right way.

657
00:45:36,542 --> 00:45:38,528
But can you really see it through all the way?

658
00:45:38,927 --> 00:45:41,140
You seemed very happy to receive the flowers.

659
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:44,353
When you say  Game Over,  I'm going to end it.

660
00:45:44,667 --> 00:45:46,469
This isn't my problem.

661
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,604
You choose when you decide to end it.

662
00:46:01,672 --> 00:46:03,460
Why are you so childish,

663
00:46:04,593 --> 00:46:05,800
Jeon Jin Ho?

664
00:46:13,193 --> 00:46:15,478
 

665
00:46:35,127 --> 00:46:36,327
What's the problem?

666
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:37,408
Are you at home?

667
00:46:38,127 --> 00:46:39,927
 Then where else would I be at this time? 

668
00:46:39,927 --> 00:46:42,660
I thought you'd be on a date with Chang Ryul.

669
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:43,593
Why did you call me?

670
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:45,793
 Who says I called to talk to you? 

671
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,260
Is Jin Ho home?

672
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:49,993
Yeah, why?

673
00:46:49,993 --> 00:46:52,193
His phone is off.

674
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:54,193
Can you pass him the phone?

675
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,993
 Pretty please. 

676
00:47:00,193 --> 00:47:01,127
What is it?

677
00:47:01,806 --> 00:47:03,260
Can I come in?

678
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,393
Yes.

679
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:12,793
It's In Hee, it seems like an emergency.

680
00:47:23,462 --> 00:47:24,402
Yes?

681
00:47:25,793 --> 00:47:27,992
 I'm sorry, Jin Ho. 

682
00:47:29,327 --> 00:47:30,727
Why are you being like this, In Hee?

683
00:47:30,727 --> 00:47:33,592
I know you're avoiding my calls...

684
00:47:34,927 --> 00:47:39,593
And I know that you'd hate a forward girl like myself.

685
00:47:40,193 --> 00:47:43,793
I can't hold it in that I'm alone.

686
00:47:45,327 --> 00:47:48,127
 I thought if I'd talk to you- 

687
00:47:48,127 --> 00:47:49,727
 - If I can just hear your voice.  
- I'm hanging up.

688
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:02,880
Are you that tactless?

689
00:48:04,993 --> 00:48:08,060
Can you not tell when I don't want to pick up a call?

690
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,327
How would I know that?

691
00:48:11,327 --> 00:48:12,993
Even if you don't know,

692
00:48:12,993 --> 00:48:15,660
why would you want to take a phone call from that woman?

693
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:18,393
Even after In Hee betrayed you?

694
00:48:18,393 --> 00:48:20,127
That's a problem between In Hee and me.

695
00:48:20,727 --> 00:48:23,593
I don't know the relationship between you and In Hee.

696
00:48:24,196 --> 00:48:27,527
You even spent the night at In Hee's house...

697
00:48:35,126 --> 00:48:37,652
H-How did you know that?

698
00:48:37,652 --> 00:48:39,742
I heard it by chance.

699
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,275
Seeing how you and I are friends,

700
00:48:48,275 --> 00:48:50,870
there's no law saying you and In Hee 
can't be friends as well,

701
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:53,326
She's an important person involved
 with the Dam Arts Center project,

702
00:48:53,326 --> 00:48:55,729
so she must be a lot of help to you.

703
00:48:55,729 --> 00:49:00,017
In the future, she could be more important to you than I am.

704
00:49:00,017 --> 00:49:02,181
So how could I ignore her call?

705
00:49:15,797 --> 00:49:17,594
Are you trying to get hurt again?

706
00:49:17,594 --> 00:49:19,866
What does it have to do with you?

707
00:49:21,699 --> 00:49:24,486
In Hee said she'd had a burglary, that's why I went.

708
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:28,800
And when you called, I was in the office working.

709
00:49:30,141 --> 00:49:33,137
Why do I have to go on explaining like this...

710
00:49:34,399 --> 00:49:37,425
A burglary?

711
00:49:37,425 --> 00:49:39,981
Is she hurt?

712
00:49:40,747 --> 00:49:42,945
Is that what you're worried about?

713
00:49:42,945 --> 00:49:45,101
Ahh, you... Really...

714
00:49:47,138 --> 00:49:52,676
If that's what the matter was, 
you should have just told me.

715
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,900
What, is that something to brag about?

716
00:49:57,012 --> 00:49:59,411
Well, I know that you're...

717
00:49:59,411 --> 00:50:05,307
you're not like those other men who 
would sleep with other women... but...

718
00:50:05,307 --> 00:50:06,939
But?

719
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:13,000
The moment I heard that, my heart was uneasy.

720
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:17,300
I thought that my best friend in this world...

721
00:50:17,323 --> 00:50:20,627
was being taken away by In Hee.

722
00:50:23,174 --> 00:50:25,199
Something like that will never happen.

723
00:50:27,223 --> 00:50:29,143
Really?

724
00:50:42,522 --> 00:50:45,313
What is it Chang Ryul?

725
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,800
Have you been drinking?

726
00:50:58,208 --> 00:51:00,559
If you're drunk, then sleep.

727
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,263
The flowers I gave you...

728
00:51:03,263 --> 00:51:06,290
you didn't even notice you left them in my car, did you?

729
00:51:07,474 --> 00:51:09,890
Ah... It slipped my mind.

730
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:13,242
The first time I gave you flowers...

731
00:51:13,242 --> 00:51:17,835
and it slipped your mind?

732
00:51:18,863 --> 00:51:24,932
That time I gave you a keyring, 
you thought the world of it, but now...

733
00:51:25,777 --> 00:51:28,585
you've become like this.

734
00:51:29,799 --> 00:51:31,750
I'm hanging up.

735
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,249
Yes, ahjusshi.

736
00:53:23,249 --> 00:53:25,178
Yes, the wood got here fine.

737
00:53:25,178 --> 00:53:29,688
But, I think I'll be needing a lot more 
so please put a lot aside for me.

738
00:53:29,688 --> 00:53:30,977
Yes.

739
00:53:32,101 --> 00:53:33,306
Oh, my head?

740
00:53:33,306 --> 00:53:34,783
It's all better now.

741
00:53:34,783 --> 00:53:35,762
 Yeah. 

742
00:53:35,762 --> 00:53:38,858
 But, which one's your real boyfriend? 

743
00:53:38,858 --> 00:53:39,694
Pardon?

744
00:53:39,694 --> 00:53:41,844
The young man who showed up first?

745
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:47,230
Or the one who called up later, frantic to know 
which hospital you'd been taken to?

746
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:49,223
So someone else called you?

747
00:53:49,223 --> 00:53:50,421
 You didn't get to see him? 

748
00:53:50,421 --> 00:53:53,055
 That's strange, I told him which hospital it was... 

749
00:53:53,055 --> 00:53:54,235
 I asked him who he was, 

750
00:53:54,235 --> 00:53:55,723
 and he said he was a friend. 

751
00:53:55,723 --> 00:54:01,619
 Friend, eh? Sounded more like a boyfriend 
who was sick to death with worry about you. 

752
00:54:01,984 --> 00:54:04,601
 You must be very popular, Miss Park. 

753
00:54:20,806 --> 00:54:21,737
Hello?

754
00:54:21,737 --> 00:54:24,223
 Can you spare me a moment, my friend? 

755
00:54:30,999 --> 00:54:32,857
Ta-da!

756
00:54:32,857 --> 00:54:34,123
Look's nice, right?

757
00:54:34,123 --> 00:54:37,071
This is something I've always wanted to do with my boyfriend.

758
00:54:38,421 --> 00:54:40,346
So isn't it something you should have done with Chang Ryul?

759
00:54:40,346 --> 00:54:44,312
Aw, come on. You know what all that's about.

760
00:54:44,312 --> 00:54:45,718
I don't know what you're talking about.

761
00:54:45,718 --> 00:54:47,804
Do you know how hard I've worked on this,

762
00:54:47,804 --> 00:54:49,144
trying to make you happy?

763
00:54:49,144 --> 00:54:51,582
So you're saying you made all of this yourself?

764
00:54:51,582 --> 00:54:53,190
I wanted to...

765
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:54,823
but I didn't know how to.

766
00:54:54,823 --> 00:54:56,123
You should hurry and eat this.

767
00:54:56,123 --> 00:54:57,051
This is devil's kimbap.

768
00:54:57,051 --> 00:54:58,928
It's the kind that you can eat and eat, and still want more of.

769
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:00,917
It's just kimbap.

770
00:55:00,917 --> 00:55:02,641
Not lying to you...

771
00:55:02,641 --> 00:55:04,835
Here, say, "Ah." Ah.

772
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:11,662
Isn't it yummy?

773
00:55:11,662 --> 00:55:12,976
Isn't it killer?

774
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:18,162
It's seasoned with the Park Kae In's Gratitude Sauce. 
That's why it's so delicious.

775
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,857
I heard you came...

776
00:55:21,857 --> 00:55:23,804
to the hospital.

777
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:30,890
I mean, if you came to the hospital, you should've told me so. What am I, some kind of psychic?

778
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:32,657
Are you going to let that interfere with your revenge plans?

779
00:55:32,657 --> 00:55:35,559
How did you even know which lumber yard I was at?

780
00:55:36,323 --> 00:55:38,437
Jin Young Lumber Yard.

781
00:55:38,437 --> 00:55:40,123
I called the info service on 114.

782
00:55:40,123 --> 00:55:46,257
If you had told me earlier, I would've been twice as grateful!

783
00:55:46,257 --> 00:55:47,912
I got a shock, that's the only reason I rushed over there.

784
00:55:47,912 --> 00:55:50,702
Don't go making a big thing of it.

785
00:55:50,702 --> 00:55:53,793
But I want to make a big thing out of it.

786
00:55:57,663 --> 00:55:59,590
I mean, we're friends, so...

787
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:02,090
It would be natural for you to get worried, wouldn't it?

788
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:08,057
Jin Ho,

789
00:56:08,057 --> 00:56:11,157
if I'd been a guy, how would you have reacted?

790
00:56:13,942 --> 00:56:18,223
Would you have felt a bit differently in that case?

791
00:56:20,023 --> 00:56:22,005
I can't imagine it at all.

792
00:56:23,157 --> 00:56:24,890
You can't?

793
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,445
What do you think?

794
00:56:35,445 --> 00:56:39,523
Let's go for it!  I'll be your  boy friend today for a day.

795
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:42,023
I'm handsome! Not bad right?

796
00:56:57,657 --> 00:56:59,290
What are you doing?

797
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:08,957
Now, let's pose.

798
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:15,823
Friend...

799
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:18,223
You are too tall.

800
00:57:51,157 --> 00:57:54,223
Are you really going to go around like this?

801
00:57:54,223 --> 00:57:57,290
I've really wanted to try this just once! 
Don't I really look like a man?

802
00:57:57,290 --> 00:57:59,223
Really, you just look like a girl gone crazy.

803
00:58:01,152 --> 00:58:03,690
Now that I've punched you, I sure seem like a guy, don't I?

804
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:05,533
All this strength I've gotten from working every day!

805
00:58:07,023 --> 00:58:08,623
Oh, really!

806
00:58:08,623 --> 00:58:10,023
What a lame joke...

807
00:58:11,423 --> 00:58:12,823
From his childhood right up to the present,

808
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:15,560
we've investigated everything about him,

809
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,546
but there isn't even the slightest sign

810
00:58:17,546 --> 00:58:18,723
of him ever showing such tendencies.

811
00:58:18,723 --> 00:58:19,457
So...

812
00:58:21,321 --> 00:58:23,824
he's not gay?

813
00:58:23,824 --> 00:58:24,590
No, he's not.

814
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:26,190
I'm sure of it.

815
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:42,390
Friend,

816
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:43,990
where shall we start?

817
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:47,057
 The number you're calling cannot be reached...   

818
00:58:47,057 --> 00:58:57,390


819
00:58:59,224 --> 00:59:00,805
Oh, oh, oh. Oh Gosh. Gosh, Gosh.

820
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:03,435
I think I'm about to die, too...

821
00:59:03,435 --> 00:59:04,424
So take care of yourself.

822
00:59:04,424 --> 00:59:06,990
Friend, I'm about to die. 
Doesn't this friend even have any comradeship?

823
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:10,590
Comradeship? Surviving comes first.

824
00:59:11,424 --> 00:59:12,725
Lately,

825
00:59:12,725 --> 00:59:15,150
is it popular for girls to go around looking like that?

826
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:17,044
Why would a guy who looks like that

827
00:59:17,044 --> 00:59:18,790
hang around with a girl who looks like  that ?

828
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:20,723
Guy who looks like what?

829
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:21,224
He's good-looking.

830
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,257
Hey, where are you looking? 
You need to look in front of you as you shoot.

831
00:59:23,257 --> 00:59:25,447
That's handsome to you?

832
00:59:25,447 --> 00:59:27,957
He looks like a sissy.

833
00:59:27,957 --> 00:59:29,690
Friend, what am I supposed to do if you killed  me ?

834
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:31,724
I just died!

835
00:59:37,833 --> 00:59:39,187
You jerk!

836
00:59:39,187 --> 00:59:44,057
Seeing you get mad at being called sissy was a sight to see!

837
00:59:44,057 --> 00:59:46,005
Stop with the "jerk", will you?

838
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:48,357
Aren't we both men?

839
00:59:48,357 --> 00:59:49,924
You jerk!

840
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:52,514
This isn't fun anymore,

841
00:59:52,514 --> 00:59:54,224
so how long are you going to keep this up?

842
00:59:54,224 --> 00:59:55,457
Won't you pose as a woman, Jin Ho?

843
00:59:55,457 --> 00:59:57,357
This is totally fun!

844
00:59:57,357 --> 00:59:59,324
Am I crazy? Why would I want to act like a woman?

845
00:59:59,324 --> 01:00:01,757
What, you can't do this and that in the name of friendship?

846
01:00:01,757 --> 01:00:05,324
I'd rather you ask me to die in the name of friendship.

847
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:10,356
Ah, I'm so so touched!

848
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:13,624
Now that I have a friend who says he'd die for me,

849
01:00:13,624 --> 01:00:16,468
- I won't have any regrets even if I die! 
- Oh...

850
01:00:16,468 --> 01:00:17,757
How embarrassing!

851
01:00:17,757 --> 01:00:19,457
Oh, my friend...

852
01:00:20,124 --> 01:00:20,883
Hey, friend!

853
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:21,741
Where are you going?

854
01:00:21,741 --> 01:00:22,790
Friend!

855
01:00:28,276 --> 01:00:29,321
 Park Kae In's weather forecast for tomorrow. 

856
01:00:29,321 --> 01:00:31,390
 Park Kae In's weather forecast for tomorrow. 

857
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:34,124
 For a long time, I was really worried. 

858
01:00:35,524 --> 01:00:36,790
 To show how grateful I am to you, 

859
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:38,924
 what can I possibly do? 

860
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:42,360
 "I love you..." 

861
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:45,246
 That's what I wanted to say. 

862
01:00:46,196 --> 01:00:48,808
 However, since I don't have the courage to say that, 

863
01:00:48,808 --> 01:00:49,857
 instead... 

864
01:00:49,857 --> 01:00:52,724
 I've become a boy. 

865
01:00:53,906 --> 01:00:56,031
 Just like the way you make me feel, 

866
01:00:56,031 --> 01:01:00,324
 I want to see your heart flutter because of me. 

867
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:02,257
 As tomorrow's weather grows more and more uncertain, 

868
01:01:02,684 --> 01:01:04,477
 As tomorrow's weather grows more and more uncertain, 

869
01:01:04,477 --> 01:01:07,390
 this has been Park Kae In's weather forecast. 

870
01:01:11,587 --> 01:01:13,657
Hey, my friend!

871
01:01:29,372 --> 01:01:30,499
Kae In!

872
01:01:30,499 --> 01:01:32,257
Are you in there, Kae In?

873
01:01:32,257 --> 01:01:33,924
Kae In!

874
01:01:53,827 --> 01:01:55,824
What reason can you have for calling me, Chang Ryul?

875
01:01:55,824 --> 01:01:57,490
Are you with Jin Ho right now?

876
01:01:57,490 --> 01:01:59,177
Why do you ask?

877
01:01:59,177 --> 01:02:01,924
Isn't it enough that you worry about Kae In?

878
01:02:01,924 --> 01:02:04,090
Just tell me if  that jerk's with you or not.

879
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:05,924
Why on earth are you being like this?

880
01:02:06,910 --> 01:02:08,129
He's pretending to be gay,

881
01:02:08,129 --> 01:02:10,690
and exploiting Kae In's innocence to hit out at me.

882
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:13,624
Why shouldn't I be worried that Kae In 
might be with him right this minute?

883
01:02:13,624 --> 01:02:15,086
Where are you right now, Chang Ryul?

884
01:02:15,086 --> 01:02:16,288
Let's meet right now.

885
01:02:16,288 --> 01:02:18,190
Why should I meet you right now?

886
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:19,424
I'm going to see Kae In tonight,

887
01:02:19,424 --> 01:02:23,090
and I'm going to tell her exactly from one to ten 
what kind of guy Jeon Jin Ho really is!

888
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:26,390
Friend...

889
01:02:27,442 --> 01:02:30,011
Should we have a drink before we turn in?

890
01:02:30,011 --> 01:02:32,490
There's no reason why we should, friend.

891
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:33,790
Why are you being like that?

892
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:36,457
It's just two guys, getting together over some drinks,

893
01:02:36,457 --> 01:02:38,966
talking freely with no inhibitions.

894
01:02:38,966 --> 01:02:41,257
How about we talk about men's favorite topic...

895
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,390
our military experience?

896
01:02:44,317 --> 01:02:44,990
Hey, now...

897
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:47,490
Stop doing this.

898
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:48,857
Why are you like that?

899
01:02:48,857 --> 01:02:50,224
This--

900
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:51,524
Ouch!

901
01:02:58,262 --> 01:02:58,824
Did that hurt?

902
01:02:58,824 --> 01:03:01,192
How could it not have hurt?!

903
01:03:01,192 --> 01:03:03,590
Well, why do you keep carrying on like this?

904
01:03:09,216 --> 01:03:12,325
So that when I'm born into the next life,

905
01:03:12,325 --> 01:03:15,024
I'll be born a boy.

906
01:03:17,928 --> 01:03:19,639
Jin Ho,

907
01:03:19,639 --> 01:03:22,690
you'll be born the same exact way you already are.

908
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:24,524
And then...

909
01:03:24,524 --> 01:03:26,390
just one more time...

910
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:28,224
let's meet again.

911
01:03:38,608 --> 01:03:41,624
I like you the way you are Park Kae In.

912
01:03:55,857 --> 01:03:57,390
Chang Ryul!

913
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:01,290
Let's talk.

914
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:03,290
I don't have time to talk to you right now, okay?

915
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:04,500
Kae In...

916
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:07,324
is living with Jin Ho because she thinks he's gay.

917
01:04:08,457 --> 01:04:09,457
What?

918
01:04:10,452 --> 01:04:12,145
Jin Ho is living here?

919
01:04:12,145 --> 01:04:13,257
With Kae In?

920
01:04:13,257 --> 01:04:14,590
Let's just go and talk.

921
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:16,457
Before Kae In arrives with Jin Ho.

922
01:04:16,457 --> 01:04:19,324
What do you mean? 
Kae In is living with Jin Ho?

923
01:04:19,324 --> 01:04:20,524
Since when?

924
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:22,790
Why is that jerk living here?!

925
01:04:51,457 --> 01:04:53,024
Ch...  Chang Ryul!

926
01:04:53,557 --> 01:04:54,990
Hey, who do you think you are?

927
01:04:56,457 --> 01:04:59,324
What gives you the right to keep on 
forcing yourself into my life like this?!

928
01:04:59,324 --> 01:05:00,790
What have I done?

929
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:02,457
Why do you have to live here?

930
01:05:02,457 --> 01:05:05,224
What have you done to my Kae In, you dirty bastard?

931
01:05:05,224 --> 01:05:07,795
I haven't done anything to Kae In.

932
01:05:07,795 --> 01:05:09,224
Hey, Park Kae In...

933
01:05:09,224 --> 01:05:10,824
you're living in the same house with this jerk.

934
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:13,890
How could you not tell me?

935
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:16,202
The situation meant I had to keep it a secret.

936
01:05:16,202 --> 01:05:18,257
What situation?

937
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,424
You...

938
01:05:23,757 --> 01:05:25,890
Get away from my woman right now.

939
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:26,690
Understand?

940
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:28,524
Hey, Han Chang Ryul,

941
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:31,601
what gives you the right to say that?

942
01:05:31,601 --> 01:05:34,790
Are you that worried about my sticking around Kae In?

943
01:05:34,790 --> 01:05:36,124
Do you really lack that much confidence in yourself?

944
01:05:36,124 --> 01:05:38,190
You jerk.

945
01:05:40,517 --> 01:05:41,224
You're not letting go?

946
01:05:41,224 --> 01:05:44,724
It's not because I don't know how to 
throw a punch that I'm not hitting you.

947
01:05:48,032 --> 01:05:49,399
Han Chang Ryul!

948
01:05:49,399 --> 01:05:50,724
Are you really going to keep being pathetic like this?

949
01:05:50,724 --> 01:05:52,490
What has Jin Ho done wrong?

950
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:54,424
What about me?

951
01:05:55,224 --> 01:05:57,124
Pathetic jerk.

952
01:05:57,672 --> 01:05:59,457
This jerk...

953
01:06:01,841 --> 01:06:03,057
Chang Ryul!

954
01:06:04,137 --> 01:06:06,057
Are you okay, Chang Ryul?

955
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:13,549
Chang Ryul!

956
01:06:13,549 --> 01:06:15,524
Are you okay, huh?

957
01:06:18,357 --> 01:06:19,924
Your nose is bleeding.
