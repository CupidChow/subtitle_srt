1
00:00:00,823 --> 00:00:04,193
That man... is gay.

2
00:00:04,612 --> 00:00:05,661
Gay?

3
00:00:06,095 --> 00:00:07,063
That's right.

4
00:00:07,063 --> 00:00:10,399
Since you're so great at seducing guys, try your hand with him, too...

5
00:00:10,399 --> 00:00:14,070
Who knows, you might be able to alter his tastes.

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,137
You're lying, right?

7
00:00:15,137 --> 00:00:17,874
I don't lie to people's faces.

8
00:00:17,874 --> 00:00:19,241
Do you think I am like you?

9
00:00:19,241 --> 00:00:23,646
Right. You are not like me, so you took a gay guy in here?

10
00:00:24,242 --> 00:00:26,781
I'm just renting a room to him.

11
00:00:26,883 --> 00:00:31,654
Instead of a friend like you who stole my lover,

12
00:00:31,654 --> 00:00:34,057
I feel much more comfortable with him, knowing he's not going to hurt me.

13
00:00:34,057 --> 00:00:36,102
You always put feeling comfortable first, don't you?

14
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:40,529
When you date a guy, you show up wearing pants bulging at the knees and dragging your slippered feet.

15
00:00:40,529 --> 00:00:43,265
You think that will get any guy on earth to regard you as a woman?

16
00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:48,737
Instead of thinking it was me who stole your lover, think about all the brainless things you did!

17
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,250
You, get out of here.

18
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,450
I've no more strength to cope with you.

19
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,450
Hurry up and go.

20
00:01:03,553 --> 00:01:07,389
You know as well as I do that I don't have any place to go but here.

21
00:01:08,658 --> 00:01:11,260
Kim In Hee.

22
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,530
Were you put on earth  to show me what barefaced impudence looks like?

23
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:17,133
You...

24
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:18,568
sure have changed.

25
00:01:18,568 --> 00:01:19,735
Thanks to who?

26
00:01:19,735 --> 00:01:23,539
I don't have a place to go. I have no other place to go but here!

27
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,542
You...

28
00:01:26,542 --> 00:01:28,744
If you want to avoid a beating,

29
00:01:28,744 --> 00:01:30,312
get out of here fast.

30
00:01:31,814 --> 00:01:33,082
Okay.

31
00:01:33,082 --> 00:01:36,185
I guess it's best if we both take some time to think how we stand toward each other.

32
00:01:36,185 --> 00:01:41,690
I don't want to spend any more time thinking about you. 
Let's never ever see each other again.

33
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,493
Like I said, I'll go away for today.

34
00:01:54,237 --> 00:01:56,739
Evil wench.

35
00:01:57,538 --> 00:02:00,709
Upsetting me even worse than before.

36
00:02:19,195 --> 00:02:21,630
What did you say a moment ago?

37
00:02:22,999 --> 00:02:24,500
What do you mean?

38
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,268
About someone being gay?

39
00:02:26,952 --> 00:02:27,737
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:27,737 --> 00:02:32,308
So what on earth led you to come up with that preposterous idea?

41
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:33,543
I'm really curious to know.

42
00:02:33,543 --> 00:02:36,846
I know that you want to keep that a secret and all...

43
00:02:36,846 --> 00:02:40,382
It was just that I lost my temper, so...

44
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,253
But, it's not like you're hiding it well yourself. Everyone has caught up on it.

45
00:02:44,253 --> 00:02:45,254
Caught up on it?

46
00:02:45,254 --> 00:02:49,658
But I can understand. 
So don't worry too much about it.

47
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:53,162
Your personal taste cannot be helped,

48
00:02:53,162 --> 00:02:55,098
but being promiscuous like that isn't right.

49
00:02:55,098 --> 00:02:57,299
Promiscuous?

50
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:01,851
Your partner that came with you the other day... and the guy from the motel...

51
00:03:01,851 --> 00:03:04,574
It would be nice if you chose one of the two.

52
00:03:04,574 --> 00:03:07,009
The tremendous wounds love can inflict...

53
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:10,980
people who've never been on the receiving end have no idea what they're like.

54
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:14,884
 Ah, please don't be like this! 

55
00:03:14,884 --> 00:03:17,053
 I've done nothing wrong except loving someone. 

56
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:20,056
 I can see you have a troubled love life. 

57
00:03:20,056 --> 00:03:23,660
 You two look like you have been going out for a long time. 

58
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,429
 That man is gay! 

59
00:03:33,302 --> 00:03:35,317
Give me your cell number.

60
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:36,505
Huh?

61
00:03:36,505 --> 00:03:37,840
Tell me your cell number.

62
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,511
010-879-0299. Why?

63
00:03:41,511 --> 00:03:42,846
0299?

64
00:03:42,846 --> 00:03:44,314
Yeah.

65
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,985
That's my bank account number.

66
00:03:48,985 --> 00:03:49,418
Huh?

67
00:03:49,418 --> 00:03:51,321
Please return my lease deposit into that account.

68
00:03:51,321 --> 00:03:53,523
I will come back to get my other belongings later.

69
00:03:53,523 --> 00:03:54,423
Huh?!

70
00:03:54,757 --> 00:03:56,225
Ah! Jin Ho!

71
00:03:56,225 --> 00:03:57,193
Hey, Jin Ho!

72
00:03:57,193 --> 00:03:59,395
J-Jin Ho!

73
00:03:59,395 --> 00:04:03,299
Wait! Jin Ho! Why are acting this way? Please, let's talk...

74
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:05,668
What is this?

75
00:04:05,668 --> 00:04:09,972
Just going away like this?

76
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:13,209
Wahh...

77
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:17,378
How can he...

78
00:04:17,446 --> 00:04:20,649
 That man is gay! 

79
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,450
Aish!

80
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:29,792
"Gay."

81
00:04:30,093 --> 00:04:31,994
Episode 3

82
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:40,435
Good morning!

83
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,150
Did something go wrong?

84
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,050
It sure did.

85
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,650
What?

86
00:04:51,047 --> 00:04:53,482
Is it because of the girl at Sang Go Jae?

87
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:55,485
I knew it.

88
00:04:55,485 --> 00:04:57,820
She didn't look normal when I first saw her.

89
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,788
You were right.

90
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:01,724
But still... that was going too far for the first night.

91
00:05:01,724 --> 00:05:04,793
Even though she likes you.

92
00:05:04,793 --> 00:05:06,996
Well, what can you do?

93
00:05:06,996 --> 00:05:10,733
Close your eyes and just take everything off.

94
00:05:13,035 --> 00:05:13,936
Hyung.

95
00:05:13,936 --> 00:05:14,937
Yeah?

96
00:05:14,937 --> 00:05:16,939
Do you know what that woman said to me?

97
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:18,474
Did she say she wants to go out with you?

98
00:05:18,474 --> 00:05:21,510
Or... she already wants to get married?

99
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,550
No.

100
00:05:23,946 --> 00:05:25,247
Ga-

101
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:28,317
Gay-

102
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:30,954
Never mind.

103
00:05:30,954 --> 00:05:32,955
I'm going to move out of  Sang Go Jae.

104
00:05:32,955 --> 00:05:37,326
It is better this way since I wasn't comfortable to live there from the beginning.

105
00:05:37,326 --> 00:05:41,397
Let's base our entry on our Dream Art Center proposals.

106
00:05:41,397 --> 00:05:43,775
I've been thinking about it.

107
00:05:43,775 --> 00:05:48,337
Materials we prepared last time for the Dream Art Center, let's re-use them.

108
00:05:48,337 --> 00:05:54,711
Let's put a Korean traditional style courtyard here and maximize the novelty with Cor-Ten rather than wood.

109
00:05:54,711 --> 00:05:57,046
Yeah, that's a great idea.

110
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:05,288
How do you think that will  go down in competition against a big outfit like Mirae Construction?

111
00:06:05,288 --> 00:06:11,127
Even if Director Choi is inclined to favor a design along the lines of Sang Go Jae,

112
00:06:11,127 --> 00:06:13,563
it won't stand a chance against their lobbying power.

113
00:06:13,563 --> 00:06:15,164
Hyung, just listen to what I have to say. So-

114
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:19,268
Who cares even if we don't succeed in open competition? That's life.

115
00:06:19,268 --> 00:06:27,776
You can take your stuff and leave,  and I can go into my family business, working at the corner store.

116
00:06:28,678 --> 00:06:32,181
I don't want to work at a corner store.

117
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:35,918
Selling radishes and cabbages...

118
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:39,487
I don't want to get my hands dirty.

119
00:06:40,256 --> 00:06:41,858
Hey, don't you think she's crazy?

120
00:06:41,858 --> 00:06:44,326
Who does she think she is coming here?

121
00:06:44,326 --> 00:06:48,130
I could slap her face if I saw her.

122
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,233
When I told her  I was renting the room out to Jin Ho,

123
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:53,670
she said I was the one who was out of order.

124
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:58,040
Crazy wench. And you let her get away with that?

125
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:05,214
I grabbed her by the hair. 
And I challenged her to try seducing him, since he's gay.

126
00:07:05,214 --> 00:07:06,849
Could it be that...

127
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:10,552
Jin Ho heard you saying that he's gay?

128
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:16,859
You drive me to despair!  How could you say that when he's still in the closet?

129
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:18,127
I know...

130
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:20,930
Actually because of that...

131
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,300
Jin Ho left last night with his stuff.

132
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,506
A problem has arisen.

133
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:33,576
Not answering?

134
00:07:39,582 --> 00:07:41,384
 Please wire my lease deposit by today. 

135
00:07:41,384 --> 00:07:42,518
What is it?

136
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:47,156
What are you going to do now? 
I brought you a financial saviour and you kicked him out!

137
00:07:47,156 --> 00:07:49,058
Ah, forget it!

138
00:07:49,058 --> 00:07:52,962
Even though he is not interested in girls, I don't like living with him.

139
00:07:52,962 --> 00:07:55,298
Beggars can't be choosers.

140
00:07:55,298 --> 00:08:03,939
Everything would be fine if  I could catch Won Ho. If I can get my money back, I can return the deposit and still save our house.

141
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:06,942
What is it?

142
00:08:07,743 --> 00:08:09,044
Sorry.

143
00:08:21,257 --> 00:08:23,293
Hey! Lee Won Ho! You bastard!

144
00:08:23,293 --> 00:08:25,127
You bastard! If you were here-

145
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:27,096
What the heck is wrong with you?

146
00:08:27,096 --> 00:08:28,130
Are you crazy?

147
00:08:28,396 --> 00:08:29,131
I'm sorry!

148
00:08:29,131 --> 00:08:31,467
This person...have you seen him?

149
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:33,235
I don't know.

150
00:08:34,135 --> 00:08:35,504
Hey, Lee Won Ho!

151
00:08:35,504 --> 00:08:37,273
Where the hell are you?

152
00:08:37,273 --> 00:08:40,376
This is not a problem you can solve by running away.

153
00:08:40,376 --> 00:08:42,745
Hey, let's meet up.

154
00:08:42,745 --> 00:08:47,583
If we meet and talk, who knows, we may find some solution?

155
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,252
Won Ho...

156
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:53,622
Call me back... Okay?

157
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:06,635
Oh my, how can she remove her heavy make-up she put on in the morning?

158
00:09:06,635 --> 00:09:08,704
What a waste!

159
00:09:08,704 --> 00:09:12,107
Getting back to her normal self...

160
00:09:12,107 --> 00:09:14,977
It is like a transformer.

161
00:09:14,977 --> 00:09:16,579
Ahjumma!

162
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:19,196
Why do you care so much about other people?

163
00:09:19,196 --> 00:09:23,871
Omo, why do you care whether I care or not?

164
00:09:25,195 --> 00:09:27,289
Do you really have nothing to talk about?

165
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:29,959
If you have nothing to talk about, then go sleep.

166
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,172
Hey!

167
00:09:31,172 --> 00:09:34,130
Yes! I have nothing better to do!

168
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,733
I got kicked out by my husband, now you're looking down on  me?

169
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:39,635
So annoying...

170
00:09:53,168 --> 00:09:54,182
Try standing up.

171
00:09:54,182 --> 00:09:55,351
Yes.

172
00:09:58,688 --> 00:10:00,522
Do you feel better?

173
00:10:01,326 --> 00:10:01,991
Yes.

174
00:10:01,991 --> 00:10:04,293
I am fine now.

175
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:24,480
  In a situation like this, you're just supposed to say, 'Thank you.' 

176
00:10:30,286 --> 00:10:33,923
I still haven't paid back the hospital bill...

177
00:10:34,323 --> 00:10:38,760
It is just a fusion Korean style house.

178
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,693
Why is Director Choi from MS so interested in this?

179
00:10:41,693 --> 00:10:43,427
Professor Park said in the interview

180
00:10:43,427 --> 00:10:46,377
it is dedicated to his wife and daughter.

181
00:10:47,253 --> 00:10:48,266
I don't get it either.

182
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:50,653
When you go back to Sang Go Jae, look around closely again today.

183
00:10:50,653 --> 00:10:51,550
Forget it.

184
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,158
I will go there to pick up my stuff when she returns my deposit.

185
00:10:54,158 --> 00:10:56,140
Don't be like this.

186
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,020
Try to get on good terms with the Sang Go Jae girl.

187
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,060
What sort of good terms?

188
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,381
Listen up, here's a chance to get even more than you bargained for.

189
00:11:02,381 --> 00:11:04,498
Sure, getting the Dam Arts Center would be a coup in itself,

190
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:07,389
But what I mean is... Supposing you became Professor Park's son-on-law...

191
00:11:07,742 --> 00:11:09,622
With that backing, you'd be way ahead of the game!

192
00:11:09,622 --> 00:11:11,138
Oh, just shut up!

193
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,166
Ah, you punk!

194
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,104
You should knock before you barge in, you ill-mannered brat!

195
00:11:15,104 --> 00:11:17,032
What were you two plotting?

196
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:17,994
What do you mean, plotting?

197
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:19,213
What's the problem?

198
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:20,785
Oh right! You have a visitor.

199
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:30,240
Let's talk outside.

200
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,229
I just...

201
00:11:31,229 --> 00:11:33,179
I just...

202
00:11:35,823 --> 00:11:36,872
Who is she?

203
00:11:36,872 --> 00:11:37,808
A VIP.

204
00:11:37,808 --> 00:11:38,988
Huh?

205
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:42,787
Ah, excuse me...

206
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:47,624
Honestly, I don't usually blurt things out, you know.

207
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,880
I must've been a little crazy last night.

208
00:11:51,448 --> 00:11:52,864
Look...

209
00:11:54,665 --> 00:11:56,681
Stuff went straight from my brain and out at my mouth.

210
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:59,236
It shot out before I could think about it.

211
00:11:59,236 --> 00:12:02,885
I tried to put things right, but it didn't quite turn out like I intended...

212
00:12:02,885 --> 00:12:04,574
You're just rambling on...

213
00:12:04,574 --> 00:12:05,543
And I'm busy, so...

214
00:12:05,543 --> 00:12:07,511
Aah... ju-just a moment...

215
00:12:09,714 --> 00:12:12,016
I'll never do it again.  I'll keep your secret!

216
00:12:12,016 --> 00:12:14,265
Please come back. Please?

217
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:19,056
Please hurry up and return the rental deposit to my bank account.

218
00:12:20,225 --> 00:12:21,926
Aishhh... Hey you!

219
00:12:24,061 --> 00:12:25,496
You...

220
00:12:31,035 --> 00:12:32,103
Here...

221
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:35,206
What is this?

222
00:12:38,776 --> 00:12:40,044
It's a present.

223
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:42,847
It's not a bribe?

224
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,083
It's really a present.

225
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:49,887
I haven't been able to thank you properly for paying my hospital bill.

226
00:12:49,887 --> 00:12:50,788
Huh, you see...

227
00:12:50,788 --> 00:12:54,091
Since I'm giving this to you as a thank you, don't think it carries any obligation.

228
00:12:54,091 --> 00:12:58,763
Even if we are going separate ways, we should do what is right...

229
00:12:58,763 --> 00:13:00,931
and give thanks where it's due, don't you think?

230
00:13:00,931 --> 00:13:04,468
Well... it's true I suffered a lot that night...

231
00:13:04,468 --> 00:13:06,303
so I guess I'll accept this.

232
00:13:07,806 --> 00:13:11,809
Then... you will... come back?

233
00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:12,843
No.

234
00:13:13,277 --> 00:13:15,679
Thanks for the goodbye present.

235
00:13:16,147 --> 00:13:17,448
Aaah!

236
00:13:22,854 --> 00:13:24,055
I gave it to him for nothing...

237
00:13:24,055 --> 00:13:26,057
I gave it to him for nothing!

238
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:36,100
Hey, why aren't you ready? We're already late and have to get going.

239
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,767
I got it.

240
00:13:38,302 --> 00:13:39,370
What is this?

241
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,738
Did you buy this recently?

242
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:43,140
No, it's a present.

243
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,074
A present?

244
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:44,742
From who?

245
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:45,576
Just someone.

246
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:46,844
Oppa!

247
00:13:47,178 --> 00:13:48,545
Aigoo, Hye Mi!

248
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,414
What happened to you?

249
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:51,916
Where did all of your stuff in your room go?

250
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,852
How could you just leave a little note and leave the house like that?

251
00:13:54,852 --> 00:13:56,787
I'm sorry. Let's talk later.

252
00:13:56,787 --> 00:13:59,123
Do you know how much your mother is worried about you?

253
00:13:59,123 --> 00:14:01,158
At your age! It's not like you're running away!

254
00:14:02,027 --> 00:14:03,527
I am running away.

255
00:14:05,062 --> 00:14:07,231
If we live in the same house,

256
00:14:07,231 --> 00:14:08,966
I thought you might've been uncomfortable.

257
00:14:08,966 --> 00:14:10,334
I'm not uncomfortable.

258
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:12,336
There's nothing I'm uncomfortable with.

259
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:13,638
I'm with oppa,

260
00:14:13,638 --> 00:14:15,239
so why would I be uncomfortable?

261
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:17,641
Even so, it's not the right thing.

262
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:20,477
Living in a house with a full-grown man

263
00:14:20,477 --> 00:14:21,746
doesn't look good in people's eyes.

264
00:14:22,113 --> 00:14:24,048
And it's likely to worry your family, too.

265
00:14:24,048 --> 00:14:26,450
So now... you're saying you're concerned about me?

266
00:14:26,918 --> 00:14:28,552
Oppa!

267
00:14:28,552 --> 00:14:31,956
One day, when it's time for you to get married, this might cause problems for you.

268
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:33,824
And also...

269
00:14:33,824 --> 00:14:35,926
this is an office where people work.

270
00:14:35,926 --> 00:14:37,960
Don't just come  to look for me whenever you feel like it.

271
00:14:44,869 --> 00:14:47,371
Jin Ho hyung! You're too much!

272
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:50,908
Hye Mi!  Calm down, calm down.

273
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:54,078
You know very well how Jin Ho is liable to say the first thing that comes into his head.

274
00:14:57,682 --> 00:15:00,618
You... want to go on a date with me, right?

275
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:02,152
Yes.

276
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:05,789
In that case, find out where Jin Ho's at.

277
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:07,157
Date?

278
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:09,059
Okay.

279
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,738
You came early.

280
00:15:20,738 --> 00:15:22,707
The presentation doesn't start for another 30 minutes.

281
00:15:22,707 --> 00:15:24,442
Yes, I understand.

282
00:15:24,442 --> 00:15:28,179
I came here because I wanted to talk to you briefly about something.

283
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:30,081
Go get things ready.

284
00:15:30,081 --> 00:15:31,515
Yes, sir.

285
00:15:35,954 --> 00:15:37,455
Alright.

286
00:15:40,024 --> 00:15:41,092
Please sit down.

287
00:15:41,092 --> 00:15:42,159
Ah, yes.

288
00:15:45,229 --> 00:15:46,263
This...

289
00:15:46,263 --> 00:15:48,699
This project is really...

290
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:54,805
Your father was also something, but you are really being great!

291
00:15:54,805 --> 00:15:58,008
This will be the masterpiece of a lifetime!

292
00:15:58,008 --> 00:15:59,509
You are being too kind.

293
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:00,979
Bring me the painting.

294
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:03,547
Please take a look at this.

295
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:06,984
This is a painting I'm very fond of,

296
00:16:06,984 --> 00:16:12,122
but I think you deserve to have it more than I do.

297
00:16:12,122 --> 00:16:13,590
I'm sorry.

298
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,526
There's someone I have to see now.

299
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:20,297
Ah, yes. Well, then I'll be leaving the painting here.

300
00:16:20,297 --> 00:16:21,565
As for the painting...

301
00:16:22,132 --> 00:16:24,501
I'll make do with your kind words. Please take the painting away with you.

302
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:30,607
I'm grateful that your past friendship with my father leads you to show me such consideration.

303
00:16:31,008 --> 00:16:32,343
However,

304
00:16:32,343 --> 00:16:34,111
on the grounds of such personal feelings,

305
00:16:34,478 --> 00:16:36,380
in the matter of the forthcoming Dam Arts Center project,

306
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,083
if I were to give preferential treatment to your Mirae Construction firm,

307
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,452
I'm sure that would be a blow to your pride.

308
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:43,554
I'm sure you agree with me there?

309
00:16:44,088 --> 00:16:44,789
Yes.

310
00:16:45,403 --> 00:16:46,390
Then...

311
00:16:49,795 --> 00:16:58,802

312
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,139
What are you doing?

313
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:04,975
Why do you want to know?

314
00:17:04,975 --> 00:17:06,310
What do you think I'm doing?

315
00:17:06,977 --> 00:17:08,479
Do you really think I don't know?

316
00:17:08,479 --> 00:17:10,114
You're looking for In Hee, aren't you?

317
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,851
So why are you asking, if you know already?

318
00:17:13,851 --> 00:17:17,354
Get your mind out of lala land!

319
00:17:18,055 --> 00:17:21,926
Hey! Your small shop around the corner hasn't been ruined yet?

320
00:17:24,061 --> 00:17:27,498
Cockroaches really do keep finding scraps, huh?

321
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,734
Let me just give him one good smack.

322
00:17:30,734 --> 00:17:32,837
Try... Try to hit him.

323
00:17:32,837 --> 00:17:33,805
If you have a lot of money.

324
00:17:33,805 --> 00:17:35,773
Let's go. Don't bother.  It's not worth it.

325
00:17:37,775 --> 00:17:41,912
And now it's time to begin  the presentation of the Dam Arts Center construction project.

326
00:17:44,048 --> 00:17:45,282
Hello.

327
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:48,385
I am Choi Do Bin, the Director of the Dam Art Gallery.

328
00:17:48,385 --> 00:17:50,587
Most of you gathered here today

329
00:17:50,587 --> 00:17:54,825
are attending what you think of as the briefing meeting 
for the extension work of the Dam Art Gallery.

330
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:56,627
However, this project...

331
00:17:56,627 --> 00:17:58,929
is different from an extension of an art gallery.

332
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:02,833
I want to make clear to you that the work will indeed create a new universe.

333
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,805
The place that will be called Dam Arts Center

334
00:18:07,805 --> 00:18:09,873
will be a newly-created place of innovation,

335
00:18:09,873 --> 00:18:11,742
a universe embodying our dream.

336
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,747
The new arts center will be built on a 195.000 square meter site.

337
00:18:16,747 --> 00:18:18,749
The total construction cost will be 400 billion won ($400M).

338
00:18:18,749 --> 00:18:23,019
It will not follow the traditional concept of an art gallery where it simply exhibits its collections.

339
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,656
To let the best artists in the country live there

340
00:18:25,656 --> 00:18:27,858
and concentrate on nothing other than creating their masterpieces,

341
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:31,262
we're planning to make five hundred residential studios there.

342
00:18:32,463 --> 00:18:34,531
A meeting place of traditional and contemporary techniques,

343
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:39,270
this will become the foremost center in Korea and achieve global recognition.

344
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:46,243
We expect the most passionate and creative ideas from you all, the best architects of the country.

345
00:18:46,243 --> 00:18:51,048
The deadline for construction plans to be received is the 14th, one week from today.

346
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:55,753
The firm submitting the chosen plan will be given full charge 
of the design and construction of the Dam Arts Center,

347
00:18:55,753 --> 00:18:58,923
and being so chosen will raise them to the status of one of the greatest architectural concerns worldwide.

348
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:03,694
Kim In Hee. I'd like to have a word with you.

349
00:19:03,694 --> 00:19:04,895
I have nothing to say.

350
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:06,196
I do.

351
00:19:06,196 --> 00:19:07,298
Where did you sleep last night?

352
00:19:07,298 --> 00:19:09,266
Why does it matter to you where I sleep?

353
00:19:09,266 --> 00:19:11,502
Hey, Kim In Hee. You can't just say that.

354
00:19:12,937 --> 00:19:15,705
Ya! In Hee!  Kim In Hee!

355
00:19:28,408 --> 00:19:29,620
Hello.

356
00:19:30,221 --> 00:19:31,355
Yes.

357
00:19:32,657 --> 00:19:36,627
I... I'm afraid I must have disturbed you rather a lot yesterday night.

358
00:19:36,627 --> 00:19:37,862
Ah... about last night...

359
00:19:37,862 --> 00:19:40,998
Hang on a second. L-Last night... You two what?

360
00:19:41,498 --> 00:19:44,535
Hey, Kim In Hee. You met this punk last night?

361
00:19:47,138 --> 00:19:50,841
About last night... you made a very strong impression on me.

362
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:54,211
Please forget about last night. I'm not usually a person who acts like that.

363
00:19:54,211 --> 00:19:55,379
Don't mention it.

364
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:59,116
You came across as very human and friendly.

365
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:02,686
You punk! Did you get up to something with my In Hee last night? Huh?

366
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:09,526
Would you really like to know?

367
00:20:10,227 --> 00:20:11,829
But what can you do?

368
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:15,332
What happened between me and In Hee is supposed to be a secret.

369
00:20:15,332 --> 00:20:16,800
This punk is really...

370
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,076
You! You'd better do the Dam Arts Center project!

371
00:20:26,076 --> 00:20:29,412
I'll definitely win over you!

372
00:20:29,412 --> 00:20:31,815
If I was going to lose to you...

373
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:33,617
I wouldn't have made it this far.

374
00:20:33,617 --> 00:20:35,152
You punk are really something...

375
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:38,122
Please stop! You're getting out of hand! 
The president is watching right now.

376
00:20:43,194 --> 00:20:45,329
What is the problem here?

377
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:47,631
Where do you think you are, getting to the verge of blows?

378
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:50,767
I've told you many times before.

379
00:20:51,702 --> 00:20:54,705
The ones who have everything should be lenient to others.

380
00:20:55,205 --> 00:20:58,909
You should be sympathetic to those less fortunate than you.

381
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:01,945
How many times do I have to tell you, you punk?

382
00:21:03,313 --> 00:21:08,852
Why do you have to grab the person that gets beaten by us everytime?

383
00:21:09,453 --> 00:21:11,488
Like a fool...

384
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,761
President Han.

385
00:21:19,563 --> 00:21:22,466
If it's a fair fight, I don't mind getting a bloody nose.

386
00:21:22,466 --> 00:21:23,333
However...

387
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:26,603
if the bloody nose comes from opponents with rocks hidden in their fists, then...

388
00:21:26,603 --> 00:21:28,105
then it's unfair!

389
00:21:30,273 --> 00:21:34,412
So, this time, deal with us with your bare fists.

390
00:21:34,412 --> 00:21:36,013
Please honor that request.

391
00:21:44,088 --> 00:21:46,257
Hahaha... just now when you were telling President Han,

392
00:21:46,257 --> 00:21:48,525
I was so happy with you!

393
00:21:52,363 --> 00:21:54,398
Do you think we really have a chance to win?

394
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:56,166
Chances are something people have to make for themselves.

395
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:02,206
Yes?

396
00:22:02,206 --> 00:22:03,173
What?

397
00:22:06,377 --> 00:22:13,617
From what I've heard,  last time with the Dream Art Center...  
Director Choi viewed their proposal with great interest.

398
00:22:13,617 --> 00:22:16,821
Still, with this job, do they  have what it takes to succeed?

399
00:22:16,821 --> 00:22:19,356
Seeing I have a skillful lobbyist like you for a father,

400
00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:21,158
I'm not greatly worried.

401
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,628
Lobbying isn't effective in this case, you punk!

402
00:22:25,563 --> 00:22:28,432
What is happening with your wife?

403
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:29,700
Did you two talk?

404
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,568
My  w-w-wife?

405
00:22:33,237 --> 00:22:36,073
Are you going to accept In Hee again?

406
00:22:36,307 --> 00:22:41,478
Seeing her just now... She seems to be greatly trusted by Director Choi.

407
00:22:41,478 --> 00:22:44,481
She seems to be in an important place there.

408
00:22:44,481 --> 00:22:46,617
Try to charm her to your side.

409
00:22:47,218 --> 00:22:53,056
If this project succeeds well, I understand that you are going to accept her with me.

410
00:22:53,056 --> 00:22:55,626
Ooh, yes.

411
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:59,930
While we're on the subject, I'd like to ask you for one other thing.

412
00:23:00,598 --> 00:23:02,800
This project for the Dam Arts Center,

413
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,068
Please give me the entire authority on the project.

414
00:23:05,936 --> 00:23:08,438
If the lobbying doesn't work,

415
00:23:08,438 --> 00:23:12,909
then I'd like to fight fair with my bare fists.

416
00:23:15,981 --> 00:23:17,148
What happened?

417
00:23:17,148 --> 00:23:20,117
Everyone had been working overnight for a few days, so we weren't properly alert.

418
00:23:20,117 --> 00:23:23,454
Work place accidents happen in a blink of an eye, right?

419
00:23:23,454 --> 00:23:26,624
Whatever! We are all doing this to keep body and soul together.

420
00:23:26,624 --> 00:23:28,259
You're overworking us all,

421
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:29,660
so there was bound for an accident to happen!

422
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,961
You just keep quiet!

423
00:23:30,961 --> 00:23:33,397
Is he the guy who made the workplace accidents happen?

424
00:23:34,198 --> 00:23:38,668
Our injuries aren't too bad. Don't worry too much.

425
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:39,904
I am deeply sorry.

426
00:23:39,904 --> 00:23:44,908
What are you to blame for? It's your client for the construction project who's heartless.

427
00:23:44,908 --> 00:23:46,043
Hey...

428
00:23:55,286 --> 00:23:57,021
This is just bad! Bad!

429
00:23:57,021 --> 00:23:59,490
Since there weren't any major injuries,

430
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,724
don't worry too much.

431
00:24:00,724 --> 00:24:05,262
Our client for the construction site went bankupt this morning and debunked to the Philippines.

432
00:24:08,466 --> 00:24:10,100
What are we going to do?

433
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,604
Hey, are you crazy?

434
00:24:14,604 --> 00:24:16,707
Now, we're about to close down our office,

435
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:20,010
and you want to get loans to pay off those wages of laborers and hospital fees for them?

436
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:23,047
Then should I say I've got nothing to do with this, so go to the Philippines and arrest the owner?

437
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:25,949
We are in bad straits, ourselves!

438
00:24:25,949 --> 00:24:27,184
I'm going to go back.

439
00:24:27,184 --> 00:24:28,752
Going back where?

440
00:24:28,752 --> 00:24:31,889
You aren't thinking of breaking into somewhere are you?  You might end up in jail.

441
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:33,590
That really would be the end.

442
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,259
I'm saying that I'll go back to Sang Go Jae!

443
00:24:35,259 --> 00:24:37,293
That's exactly the right idea.

444
00:24:37,295 --> 00:24:39,363
Yes! That's precisely all that's left for us to do.

445
00:24:39,363 --> 00:24:42,432
Let's go lie down and die at  Sang Go Jae. Eh?

446
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:49,407

447
00:24:49,407 --> 00:24:51,108
Please give me dukk-boggi. 
(rice-cakes in hot sauce)

448
00:24:51,108 --> 00:24:52,542
With a lot of fishcakes.

449
00:24:57,983 --> 00:25:00,351
Since I see you often, this is on the house.

450
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:01,752
Thank you.

451
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:08,443
Is it good?

452
00:25:13,197 --> 00:25:14,698
What are you doing?

453
00:25:14,698 --> 00:25:17,234
It's not sticking back together.

454
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:20,804
Shall I do it for you?

455
00:25:35,353 --> 00:25:37,320
It'll be just as good as new!

456
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,291
Just tell me when this happens again, since this is my specialty.

457
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:41,657
Aigoo...

458
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:10,687
It's not like this is a pig pen...

459
00:26:13,524 --> 00:26:15,559
Oh!

460
00:26:16,694 --> 00:26:18,562
What is with the state of your house?

461
00:26:20,064 --> 00:26:22,232
Are you coming back?

462
00:26:26,003 --> 00:26:27,938
What is this smell?

463
00:26:29,941 --> 00:26:32,243
Have you taken to sniffing glue now as well?

464
00:26:32,243 --> 00:26:34,344
Welcome back.

465
00:26:35,346 --> 00:26:38,015
I bought some ramen. Let's share some ramen.

466
00:26:38,716 --> 00:26:41,484
Oh?! Oh!  Where are you going?

467
00:27:00,638 --> 00:27:02,306
You really...

468
00:27:03,641 --> 00:27:06,510
How would you like to pay?

469
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,750
These are all things for you. I don't need any of them.

470
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,320
Isn't it the landlady's job to cater for her tenant's needs?

471
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,188
I don't have my wallet.

472
00:27:17,188 --> 00:27:18,655
I don't have mine either.

473
00:27:18,956 --> 00:27:20,390
Really?!

474
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,625
Yes.

475
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:23,327
Then... how are we going to pay for this?

476
00:27:23,327 --> 00:27:24,562
Let's put everything back then.

477
00:27:24,562 --> 00:27:26,163
Ah-ah, it's fine.

478
00:27:27,966 --> 00:27:29,367
I'll be paying by smartphone-card.

479
00:27:29,367 --> 00:27:31,201
Yes, please put it on the scanner.

480
00:27:34,672 --> 00:27:36,073
Please use both these coupons as well.

481
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:38,375
Wow, you can do that with a cellphone?

482
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:40,744
It's not a cellphone, it's a smartphone!

483
00:27:40,744 --> 00:27:42,779
Wah, that's so cool.

484
00:27:43,889 --> 00:27:45,515
Please carry one of these.

485
00:27:49,587 --> 00:27:52,522
When was the last time you've dusted this place?

486
00:27:53,624 --> 00:27:58,461
You said you were leaving, so what was the point of cleaning?

487
00:27:58,461 --> 00:28:00,897
My lease deposit didn't arrive back in my account yet.

488
00:28:01,732 --> 00:28:04,134
Until I get it back, I'll stay here.

489
00:28:04,134 --> 00:28:08,305
And if I live here, I want to live like a person in a humane place.

490
00:28:08,305 --> 00:28:12,242
Wait... is this not a place for people to live?

491
00:28:12,242 --> 00:28:16,880
Well... when people are living their lives in a place... sometimes...

492
00:28:17,248 --> 00:28:22,885
sometimes things get untidy and...

493
00:28:22,885 --> 00:28:24,121
Park Kae In.

494
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:28,058
The state this place is in,  do you really think its worthy of the name Sang Go Jae?

495
00:28:29,694 --> 00:28:34,464
Fine. I understand! I understand. Then I can just clean it up a bit.

496
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:38,201
Then...it means you're not planning on leaving?

497
00:28:40,772 --> 00:28:42,872
The thought's been eliminated, right?

498
00:28:42,872 --> 00:28:46,711
If you promise me that you'll never say I'm a gay or something again.

499
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:50,080
Of course! Your queer tastes...

500
00:28:50,815 --> 00:28:55,952
Err, your quite distinctive  tastes... will be a secret I'll never ever reveal.

501
00:29:00,858 --> 00:29:04,161
Look at how much dust has built up. How long since you last cleaned?

502
00:29:04,662 --> 00:29:06,347
Turn it on.

503
00:29:10,035 --> 00:29:12,302
Over there.

504
00:29:12,302 --> 00:29:13,972
Hey, there too!

505
00:29:13,972 --> 00:29:16,673
More thoroughly! Faster! Do it more neatly!

506
00:29:20,712 --> 00:29:22,379
Use the feather duster.

507
00:29:23,348 --> 00:29:27,651
Starting from there, just sweep it in a straight line.

508
00:29:35,293 --> 00:29:37,494
Ah... my God, what a sight...

509
00:29:38,663 --> 00:29:40,631
Put everything in the plastic bag.

510
00:29:40,932 --> 00:29:42,466
Everything.

511
00:29:44,068 --> 00:29:45,269
Don't forget the clothes.

512
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:47,237
Right...

513
00:29:47,237 --> 00:29:50,040
These clothes... 
The cushions...

514
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,643
When was it when you ate out of that bowl?

515
00:29:52,643 --> 00:29:54,578
No, put the books over there!

516
00:29:57,081 --> 00:29:59,049
Put them in the room.

517
00:30:16,801 --> 00:30:19,770
Aigoo... my back... Aigoo...

518
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,305
How much have you done?

519
00:30:21,305 --> 00:30:24,007
Can't I take a short break before I carry on?

520
00:30:24,509 --> 00:30:29,513
This is so tiring... After all, I haven't done it for a while.

521
00:30:45,897 --> 00:30:48,631
You have to wring it out.

522
00:30:48,631 --> 00:30:50,567
Move aside.

523
00:30:51,702 --> 00:30:54,604
This is the way to clean!

524
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:56,039
Like this.

525
00:30:58,009 --> 00:30:59,644
Wah!

526
00:30:59,644 --> 00:31:02,278
The floor's shining.

527
00:31:20,698 --> 00:31:23,800
Are you done with the cleaning?

528
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,037
Yes... Somehow, I've done your lot, too.

529
00:31:29,073 --> 00:31:33,243
I'm sorry. I was going to come out again after I cleaned this up.

530
00:31:33,243 --> 00:31:36,179
Aren't you a bit old to be  playing with a doll house?

531
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:41,851
Don't make fun of this. It may look nothing to you, but it's older than you are.

532
00:31:45,089 --> 00:31:48,091
My mom made this.

533
00:31:48,091 --> 00:31:51,528
She was an interior designer, too.

534
00:31:53,931 --> 00:31:55,800
Around the time the building of  Sang Go Jae was finished,

535
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,435
Professor Park lost his wife,

536
00:31:58,435 --> 00:32:02,239
and for 30 years after that, no outsider has been allowed access inside Sang GoJae.

537
00:32:02,807 --> 00:32:03,674
Then...

538
00:32:03,674 --> 00:32:06,343
Your mother...?

539
00:32:08,446 --> 00:32:10,753
This is prettier than the real thing, right?

540
00:32:11,219 --> 00:32:13,688
This one's you. Cute, aren't you?

541
00:32:19,427 --> 00:32:21,030
Stop playing, and come out.

542
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,330
Since there's still a lot to do.

543
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:27,134
Oh...

544
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,474
Are you...

545
00:32:33,474 --> 00:32:35,243
going to throw this out too?

546
00:32:39,114 --> 00:32:41,383
This frame and the picture should be separated before throwing them into the recycling bins.

547
00:32:41,383 --> 00:32:43,684
This frame and the picture should be separated before throwing them into the recycling bins.

548
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:49,958
You must really like to clean.

549
00:32:49,958 --> 00:32:52,594
Like it? No, it's just part of my daily routine.

550
00:33:18,153 --> 00:33:19,220
 I... 

551
00:33:22,023 --> 00:33:24,392
 I was never in love with you. 

552
00:33:25,126 --> 00:33:26,194
 To me, you... 

553
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,631
 So... 

554
00:33:30,332 --> 00:33:32,729
 You were like a soaking wet, miserable dog... 

555
00:33:33,034 --> 00:33:35,270
 that was wandering around the neighborhood on a rainy day... 

556
00:33:36,516 --> 00:33:37,706
 Like a little puppy... 

557
00:33:38,506 --> 00:33:39,674
 That's what you were to me... 

558
00:33:42,811 --> 00:33:44,412
  A soaking wet... 

559
00:33:45,346 --> 00:33:47,248
 puppy? 

560
00:33:47,248 --> 00:33:48,883
 What I'm saying is... 

561
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:52,587
 it wasn't love. 

562
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:17,846


563
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,150
 Please try again. 

564
00:34:27,289 --> 00:34:30,392
Hey, Kim In Hee. I know you're in there so you better open the door!

565
00:34:32,183 --> 00:34:32,827
Hey!

566
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,950
Are you going to really act like this?

567
00:34:37,966 --> 00:34:38,033
Huh?

568
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:39,950
I'm going to count to three.

569
00:34:40,502 --> 00:34:41,202
One!

570
00:34:42,618 --> 00:34:43,638
Two!

571
00:34:45,636 --> 00:34:47,342
Two and a half!

572
00:34:53,281 --> 00:34:55,950
Hey, who said that you could just change the code by yourself?

573
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,552
That door lock was bought by me,

574
00:34:57,552 --> 00:34:59,153
so, it's my choice.

575
00:34:59,153 --> 00:34:59,855
What?

576
00:34:59,855 --> 00:35:01,723
This house may be yours,

577
00:35:01,723 --> 00:35:04,525
but everything inside this house is mine.

578
00:35:04,525 --> 00:35:08,463
I didn't want to be embarrassed, so I got everything of fine quality.

579
00:35:08,997 --> 00:35:13,301
In Hee, nobody told you to do it. You just did it for your own vanity!

580
00:35:13,301 --> 00:35:15,036
What did you say on the day of the wedding?

581
00:35:15,604 --> 00:35:17,505
"From now on, I'll live by Kim In Hee's side"

582
00:35:17,505 --> 00:35:19,407
You said your heart and body were mine.

583
00:35:20,075 --> 00:35:22,344
Yet you can't even give me this apartment?

584
00:35:22,344 --> 00:35:24,412
You know the wedding was ruined.

585
00:35:24,412 --> 00:35:26,447
That was what I said when we were getting married.

586
00:35:26,447 --> 00:35:28,249
Evil jerk...

587
00:35:31,286 --> 00:35:34,890
So... I'm saying... We can get married again, right?

588
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,124
Huh?!

589
00:35:36,124 --> 00:35:38,193
Open this door!

590
00:35:54,042 --> 00:35:55,643
Kae In...

591
00:35:56,478 --> 00:35:57,912
You came?

592
00:35:57,913 --> 00:36:02,350
Ah... the air in here... It's kinda fresh, not like normally.

593
00:36:02,751 --> 00:36:04,586
Talk about it...

594
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,323
I've been cleaning all day and there isn't a single part of my body that isn't sore.

595
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,591
Cleaning?

596
00:36:09,791 --> 00:36:10,525
You?

597
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:12,193
What else could I do?

598
00:36:12,327 --> 00:36:15,630
That guy says he wants to live for one day a least in a place fit for human habitation.

599
00:36:16,264 --> 00:36:17,934
Jin Ho came?

600
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:20,068
I gave him a bribe.

601
00:36:20,068 --> 00:36:21,969
Aigoo! That's great!

602
00:36:22,336 --> 00:36:26,308
Now... Do whatever he asks of you. Then later, it will be easier for me to ask him for some favors.

603
00:36:26,308 --> 00:36:27,608
You...

604
00:36:27,609 --> 00:36:31,046
Was that your motive for asking me over and over to bring Jin Ho back?

605
00:36:31,046 --> 00:36:33,181
What's wrong? You already know...

606
00:36:33,882 --> 00:36:36,417
It is so difficult to find models like him...

607
00:36:37,185 --> 00:36:38,587
Didn't you say your shoulders hurt?

608
00:36:39,988 --> 00:36:41,089
Alright.

609
00:36:41,623 --> 00:36:43,992
Aigoo...our Kae In's shoulders were all tense.

610
00:36:44,492 --> 00:36:45,193
Hey...

611
00:36:45,293 --> 00:36:46,928
But what brings you here at this time?

612
00:36:48,463 --> 00:36:50,065
Oh! Right...

613
00:36:50,365 --> 00:36:50,998
What?

614
00:36:52,366 --> 00:36:53,602
Here's Won Ho's address.

615
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,371
Hey!

616
00:36:58,106 --> 00:36:59,040
How did you get this?

617
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,610
My husband's a detective after all, so I may as well get some advantage out of that.

618
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,211
This way he's at least of some use.

619
00:37:03,211 --> 00:37:04,679
Hey, thank you!

620
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,415
Please tell your husband thanks for me, too.

621
00:37:08,049 --> 00:37:10,065
How great a friend you are!

622
00:37:10,065 --> 00:37:11,319
You kind girl!

623
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:12,254
I have to finish what I've started.

624
00:37:12,254 --> 00:37:13,188
Aigoo...

625
00:37:13,755 --> 00:37:16,057
It must've been hard on you.

626
00:37:16,057 --> 00:37:17,592
Hey, hey, scratch my back for me.

627
00:37:17,592 --> 00:37:19,361
Sure, I'll  scratch your back for you.

628
00:37:19,361 --> 00:37:20,228
Here?

629
00:37:20,962 --> 00:37:22,230
- Yes. A little lower. 
- Is it refreshing?

630
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,698
- Okay. 
- Harder, harder.

631
00:37:23,698 --> 00:37:26,001
Hey... How come your skin's so hard?

632
00:37:27,269 --> 00:37:28,536
When did you last take a shower?

633
00:37:29,037 --> 00:37:30,739
It's been... 3 days?

634
00:37:31,539 --> 00:37:33,208
Ah! So annoying...

635
00:37:33,742 --> 00:37:35,076
Hurry up and shower!

636
00:37:35,343 --> 00:37:36,444
It's so bothersome...

637
00:37:50,973 --> 00:37:52,127
You!

638
00:37:52,627 --> 00:37:54,029
I'm sorry.

639
00:37:54,396 --> 00:37:57,399
But, I'm not wearing my contacts or my glasses,

640
00:37:57,399 --> 00:37:59,801
so I really can't see anything.

641
00:38:00,602 --> 00:38:03,972
So... don't worry too much.

642
00:38:12,515 --> 00:38:15,450
What on earth has she got for brains, I wonder?

643
00:38:17,552 --> 00:38:20,388
Park Kae In... she's going to really bother me.

644
00:38:26,861 --> 00:38:28,530
Kae In, did you really see him?

645
00:38:29,397 --> 00:38:31,700
I wasn't wearing my contact lenses.

646
00:38:32,367 --> 00:38:34,703
But even if I didn't have them on, I saw everything.

647
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:40,175
He was quite something. It was an eyeful!

648
00:38:40,175 --> 00:38:41,776
I knew it...

649
00:38:41,776 --> 00:38:43,043
I don't mean that.

650
00:38:43,557 --> 00:38:46,281
- Then what do you mean? 
- You know, I mean... that.

651
00:38:48,183 --> 00:38:53,655
- Aigoo... Hey! 
- That? 
- You're a dreadful woman. Why are you interested in that?

652
00:38:53,655 --> 00:38:56,056
I just am. Hurry up and tell me what it looked like.

653
00:38:56,491 --> 00:38:57,792
Well, you might say...

654
00:39:00,929 --> 00:39:02,230
Is he this size?

655
00:39:04,332 --> 00:39:06,134
Really that size?

656
00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:10,138
Those women are really...!

657
00:39:16,445 --> 00:39:17,479
Hello?

658
00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:19,180
 I can't find your mother anywhere! 

659
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,081
What?!

660
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:25,921
It's getting late, so be careful walking home.

661
00:39:25,921 --> 00:39:28,156
- Okay. 
- It's been dangerous lately...

662
00:39:31,793 --> 00:39:33,595
I think he heard us.

663
00:39:35,029 --> 00:39:36,930
Impossible...

664
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,332
That's right...

665
00:39:38,332 --> 00:39:39,968
He couldn't have heard us...

666
00:39:42,386 --> 00:40:01,856


667
00:40:02,957 --> 00:40:04,492
Are you unaccompanied, Madam?

668
00:40:08,088 --> 00:40:09,664
Would you allow me to join you?

669
00:40:14,235 --> 00:40:16,638
I told you that as beautiful as you are,

670
00:40:16,638 --> 00:40:18,339
coming here alone is dangerous.

671
00:40:18,339 --> 00:40:19,474
You're busy.

672
00:40:20,141 --> 00:40:21,343
Since I'm old,

673
00:40:21,343 --> 00:40:24,179
how is it dangerous for me when nobody will look in my direction?

674
00:40:25,447 --> 00:40:27,249
But... who's gotten old?

675
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:33,255
Sometimes... I feel like coming here.

676
00:40:34,623 --> 00:40:36,625
When your father was alive,

677
00:40:37,424 --> 00:40:39,561
I would have a glass of wine,

678
00:40:39,561 --> 00:40:41,696
your dad would have coffee,

679
00:40:41,996 --> 00:40:44,132
You'd have a glass of pineapple juice,

680
00:40:44,132 --> 00:40:45,900
and talked for a long time.

681
00:40:47,969 --> 00:40:50,471
Even though your dad really liked his drink,

682
00:40:50,471 --> 00:40:52,773
he would never drink alcohol when he brought us here.

683
00:40:52,773 --> 00:40:56,076
He always had a cup of coffee.

684
00:40:56,076 --> 00:40:58,646
Stroking your head,

685
00:40:58,646 --> 00:41:01,749
saying he wished Hye Mi would grow up quickly, too.

686
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:05,336
Then along with you, the four of us could all go on dates.

687
00:41:05,336 --> 00:41:08,154
When that day comes, he'd say,

688
00:41:08,154 --> 00:41:10,091
he could

689
00:41:10,091 --> 00:41:12,927
join me in drinking wine.

690
00:41:12,927 --> 00:41:16,463
Jin Ho can be our chauffeur.

691
00:41:16,463 --> 00:41:18,366
That's what he said...

692
00:41:25,206 --> 00:41:27,175
Let's go.

693
00:41:29,578 --> 00:41:31,312
I'm overly sentimental, aren't I?

694
00:41:31,312 --> 00:41:33,047
I am being childish, aren't I?

695
00:41:38,152 --> 00:41:41,255
Please live long enough for me to become childish, too.

696
00:41:43,757 --> 00:41:46,627
Where and how have you been?

697
00:41:46,627 --> 00:41:50,197
Because you're not at home, I have to come here alone like this.

698
00:41:50,197 --> 00:41:51,899
I'm sorry.

699
00:41:51,899 --> 00:41:53,601
I've been so busy with work lately,

700
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:56,537
I have get the most out of every second of the day.

701
00:41:56,537 --> 00:41:59,307
That's why I moved somewhere close to work.

702
00:41:59,307 --> 00:42:01,742
Please understand me, Mom.

703
00:42:01,742 --> 00:42:04,045
Living apart from your mother,

704
00:42:04,045 --> 00:42:05,880
aren't you uncomfortable?

705
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,282
Of course, I'm uncomfortable.

706
00:42:07,282 --> 00:42:08,917
I feel like dying.

707
00:42:10,417 --> 00:42:11,953
-But what can I do?

708
00:42:11,953 --> 00:42:14,189
Until I finish my most urgent tasks...

709
00:42:14,189 --> 00:42:16,456
I'll try to endure it.

710
00:42:16,456 --> 00:42:17,825
Fine.

711
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,095
Jin Ho...

712
00:42:21,095 --> 00:42:23,831
The house we used to live in...

713
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:26,100
Where was it again?

714
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:35,476
I promise I'll get you that house back again.

715
00:42:36,945 --> 00:42:41,582
Chang Ryul's family seems to be prospering, so how could you get our old house back?

716
00:42:41,582 --> 00:42:43,251
Don't you trust me?

717
00:42:45,454 --> 00:42:47,622
I'm really sad if that's so.

718
00:42:47,622 --> 00:42:50,892
I do trust you, my son.

719
00:42:52,076 --> 00:42:54,796
If I can't trust my son, who can I trust?

720
00:43:16,712 --> 00:43:20,014
Do you... know where this is?

721
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,716
Over there.

722
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,486
Thank you.

723
00:43:27,222 --> 00:43:29,490
I-Is anybody in?

724
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:37,031
Excuse me... Is anybody home?

725
00:43:40,969 --> 00:43:42,904
You came?

726
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:48,450
Come in.

727
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:49,650
Yes.

728
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:52,747
Was today the day you were coming?

729
00:43:52,747 --> 00:43:57,651
But you aren't the lady who comes from the  volunteer organization.

730
00:43:58,086 --> 00:43:59,353
No.

731
00:43:59,353 --> 00:44:03,525
I've not come from the volunteer organization.

732
00:44:03,525 --> 00:44:08,096
Well don't just stand there, come here and read this to me.

733
00:44:08,096 --> 00:44:15,169
I can't sleep wondering what on earth my grandson wrote... Please?

734
00:44:20,806 --> 00:44:24,745
  
It's from  Lee Won Ho, right?

735
00:44:25,781 --> 00:44:28,449
Yes...

736
00:44:28,449 --> 00:44:30,818
Is that the name of your grandson?

737
00:44:30,818 --> 00:44:32,319
Of course.

738
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:35,256
He's my only grandson!

739
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:38,825
Rip it open and read it.

740
00:44:38,825 --> 00:44:41,996
What are you doing instead of reading?

741
00:44:53,876 --> 00:44:58,346
G-Grandmother, have you been keeping well?

742
00:44:58,346 --> 00:45:03,351
I've been really busy with work... so I can't come...

743
00:45:03,351 --> 00:45:05,586
I'm sorry.

744
00:45:05,586 --> 00:45:10,324
I know he really is sorry... He's all grown up now, you know.

745
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,297
I can tell your grandson must be a kind man.

746
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:20,301
He's been that way ever since he was small. So kind-hearted...

747
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:23,604
He would never do anything wrong.

748
00:45:39,088 --> 00:45:41,122
 Please leave a message after the beep. 

749
00:45:42,123 --> 00:45:44,325
Hey, Lee Won Ho.

750
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,093
Why are you living like this?

751
00:45:47,595 --> 00:45:52,433
That money... I'll try to find a way to sort things out somehow.

752
00:45:52,433 --> 00:45:54,902
Contact your grandmother.

753
00:46:03,578 --> 00:46:07,315
Wow! It looks tasty! It looks tasty!

754
00:46:09,951 --> 00:46:11,485
Hey!

755
00:46:11,485 --> 00:46:13,387
We don't even have any money, so how come we're treating the staff to a meal?

756
00:46:13,387 --> 00:46:15,056
No matter what, we need to do this.

757
00:46:15,056 --> 00:46:16,858
Here is the meat!

758
00:46:18,293 --> 00:46:19,460
It's beef.

759
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:27,468
Everyone knows this already,  but the Dam Arts Center project will decide the fate of our company.

760
00:46:27,468 --> 00:46:31,338
I trust that everyone here will do their best!

761
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:36,710
To our Dam Arts Center project!

762
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,679
To us!

763
00:46:51,793 --> 00:46:53,661
What's wrong?!

764
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:58,065
Are you not going to close the door?!

765
00:47:03,505 --> 00:47:06,540
You're the one who screamed and called for help.

766
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:09,243
Your body isn't worth looking at anyway.

767
00:47:09,711 --> 00:47:11,646
What did you say?!

768
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:19,420
That's right... he's that kind of person...

769
00:47:21,289 --> 00:47:22,790
Jin Ho!

770
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,628
What is it?

771
00:47:26,628 --> 00:47:31,299
I forgot that you had no interest in women...

772
00:47:33,167 --> 00:47:36,104
Forgive me for saying so, but I certainly am interested in women, apart from you.

773
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:40,007
Hey, why so coy towards me? I know all about you after all.

774
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:46,513
Jin Ho, do you think you can help me?

775
00:47:46,513 --> 00:47:47,582
With what?

776
00:47:47,582 --> 00:47:48,549
Well...

777
00:47:48,549 --> 00:47:54,522
I took out my contact lenses, but I dropped one by accident and I need to find it, but I'm having trouble seeing.

778
00:47:54,522 --> 00:47:56,624
Please help me.

779
00:48:01,496 --> 00:48:04,398
At least put some clothes on first.

780
00:48:04,398 --> 00:48:06,901
It doesn't matter with you!

781
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:12,273
I suppose you're right, I'm not interested.

782
00:48:13,608 --> 00:48:14,843
Where did you lose it?

783
00:48:14,843 --> 00:48:18,179
Here! I saw it somewhere here.

784
00:48:22,516 --> 00:48:24,452
Or was it here?

785
00:48:35,763 --> 00:48:37,098
Just move aside!

786
00:48:40,635 --> 00:48:41,936
Are you okay?

787
00:48:42,804 --> 00:48:43,771
Yes.

788
00:49:18,007 --> 00:49:20,609
Your contact lens.

789
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:30,685
I didn't eat anything... so I'm really hungry...

790
00:49:30,685 --> 00:49:32,620
Then have dinner.

791
00:49:39,661 --> 00:49:41,528
Let's go out and eat meat.

792
00:49:41,528 --> 00:49:43,765
Please? Let's go out and eat some ribs.

793
00:49:43,765 --> 00:49:46,701
Let's go out and eat some ribs. Let's go out and eat-

794
00:49:48,203 --> 00:49:49,937
I ate before I came here.

795
00:49:52,307 --> 00:49:55,609
I knew I smelled short ribs somewhere...

796
00:49:56,043 --> 00:49:57,045
I'll buy!

797
00:49:57,045 --> 00:49:58,513
Ask someone else to go with you.

798
00:49:58,513 --> 00:50:02,150
Hey, we're roommates! We should become friendly, right?

799
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:04,218
I'd prefer to keep a certain distance between us.

800
00:50:10,959 --> 00:50:14,095
Goodness, I'm hungry.

801
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:20,701
If we weren't going to go eat it together, he shouldn't have come home smelling so strongly of it.

802
00:50:20,701 --> 00:50:23,605
What kind of roommate is so cold-hearted?

803
00:50:23,605 --> 00:50:25,673
I'm dying of hunger!

804
00:50:25,673 --> 00:50:29,377
There's no food at home and I really wanted to eat meat...

805
00:50:29,377 --> 00:50:32,246
If one goes out to eat meat by oneself, it looks terribly sad...

806
00:50:32,246 --> 00:50:36,784
I wonder how nice it would be if I had a roommate who would go out and eat with me...

807
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:39,220
Why don't they do one-person servings of  ribs?

808
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:45,059
Let's get going.

809
00:50:45,059 --> 00:50:47,028
Let's go.

810
00:50:58,673 --> 00:50:59,974
Are you going to go out dressed like that?

811
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:00,875
Why not?

812
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:02,810
Does it look weird?

813
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,579
Then do you think it looks appealing?

814
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:08,282
Really it must be your taste, you are so perceptive.

815
00:51:08,282 --> 00:51:10,384
But you aren't the slightest bit perceptive, are you?

816
00:51:11,752 --> 00:51:13,888
Then should I go back in and change?

817
00:51:13,888 --> 00:51:15,022
Ah, it's fine.

818
00:51:15,457 --> 00:51:16,924
Let's go.

819
00:51:29,569 --> 00:51:35,409
Han Chang Ryul... Do you know what that bastard said to me?

820
00:51:36,944 --> 00:51:44,251
He said I was like a miserable, wet puppy that's been caught out in the rain.

821
00:51:47,389 --> 00:51:52,460
Then... he kissed a wet puppy, then what does that make him?

822
00:51:53,761 --> 00:51:56,464
All men are exactly the same!

823
00:51:56,464 --> 00:52:04,872
They all think girls like In Hee, pretty and sexy, are the only real women.

824
00:52:05,473 --> 00:52:11,446
But, since you aren't  like one of those men, I'm very happy.

825
00:52:11,446 --> 00:52:13,314
I understand.

826
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:16,818
We should leave now.

827
00:52:17,952 --> 00:52:21,489
But there's still so much drink left...

828
00:52:24,659 --> 00:52:26,094
Right, let's have just this one more, then let's go.

829
00:53:00,695 --> 00:53:03,931
It was tasty, after not eating short ribs in a really long time.

830
00:53:06,301 --> 00:53:07,668
Let's quickly finish eating and leave.

831
00:53:13,942 --> 00:53:20,815
Jin Ho... You know what? You're really sweet.

832
00:53:20,815 --> 00:53:23,517
Okay, that's enough. Hurry up and eat.

833
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:33,494
The washroom... is where... I'm...

834
00:53:43,711 --> 00:53:45,312
I didn't order that.

835
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:04,798
You are a damn playboy!

836
00:54:04,798 --> 00:54:06,634
It's you, isn't it? Trying to seduce my wife?

837
00:54:06,634 --> 00:54:07,795
What?

838
00:54:07,795 --> 00:54:10,851
Ahjusshi, what are you doing?

839
00:54:10,851 --> 00:54:14,382
You lady, watch out for him.

840
00:54:14,382 --> 00:54:16,146
This punk is a player.

841
00:54:16,146 --> 00:54:18,212
A man-whore who lives off a woman!

842
00:54:18,212 --> 00:54:21,415
Our Jin Ho isn't that kind of person!

843
00:54:21,415 --> 00:54:26,521
You girl, I saw him trying to seduce my wife with my own eyes!

844
00:54:26,521 --> 00:54:29,773
If that's what you saw, you should walk around with your eyes closed!

845
00:54:29,773 --> 00:54:33,495
You punk! You must be full of it.

846
00:54:33,495 --> 00:54:35,763
What? Who do you think you are?

847
00:54:35,763 --> 00:54:40,534
Ah, I told you he isn't. This guy is gay~!

848
00:54:40,534 --> 00:54:41,368
What?

849
00:54:47,141 --> 00:54:49,512
I told you he isn't!

850
00:54:50,936 --> 00:54:52,680
He keeps---oop!

851
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,758
Jin Ho...

852
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:10,631
Money...

853
00:55:11,732 --> 00:55:15,536
I forgot that my wallet was empty...

854
00:55:42,363 --> 00:55:45,599
Jin Ho,  wait for me!

855
00:55:52,006 --> 00:55:56,109
How many times have I told you not to say 'gay?'

856
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:57,779
I'm sorry...

857
00:55:57,779 --> 00:55:59,513
Even if you're drunk,

858
00:55:59,513 --> 00:56:01,615
can you not keep that to yourself?

859
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,428
Look here.

860
00:56:14,428 --> 00:56:15,363
Park Kae In!

861
00:56:15,363 --> 00:56:19,303
I'm sorry, Jin Ho.

862
00:56:19,303 --> 00:56:23,370
I broke my promise again...

863
00:56:24,105 --> 00:56:31,178
It was because... I was worried... about you...

864
00:56:32,313 --> 00:56:38,919
All of those people in there... know that you're gay....

865
00:56:40,287 --> 00:56:46,260
I am an idiot... Park Kae in... I'm an idiot...

866
00:56:47,295 --> 00:56:48,429
Nevermind.

867
00:56:48,429 --> 00:56:49,463
Stop crying.

868
00:56:50,064 --> 00:56:51,899
It's not like it can be helped now.

869
00:56:55,657 --> 00:56:57,972
Park Kae In, let's go.

870
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:47,855


871
00:57:48,372 --> 00:57:50,978
Look here, Park Kae In!

872
00:57:50,978 --> 00:57:53,761
Park Kae In, Park Kae In!

873
00:57:55,897 --> 00:57:57,331
Get up.

874
00:58:04,572 --> 00:58:05,581
What's wrong?

875
00:58:06,707 --> 00:58:10,110
I must have sprained my ankle again.

876
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:18,819
How much meat did you eat for you to get so heavy?

877
00:58:20,087 --> 00:58:26,760
This is great!  It's spring and the air is so great!

878
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,596
Is the night air so great for you?

879
00:58:28,596 --> 00:58:29,864
Jin Ho!

880
00:58:29,864 --> 00:58:33,434
- Jin Ho! Shall I give you a present? 
- Ah! Please stop!

881
00:58:35,336 --> 00:58:43,811
Jin Ho! Jin Ho, be strong. You have Kae In rooting for you!

882
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:44,608
Please stop...

883
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:49,016
Jin Ho! Be strong!

884
00:59:03,064 --> 00:59:07,568
Your back... is very warm.

885
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:11,305
Do you think my dad's back...

886
00:59:11,305 --> 00:59:13,541
would've been like this, too?

887
00:59:13,541 --> 00:59:16,343
Have you never been piggy-backed by your dad?

888
00:59:16,878 --> 00:59:18,179
I was never...

889
00:59:18,679 --> 00:59:22,616
I was never on anyone's back before now.

890
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:38,165
Someone's back...

891
00:59:39,634 --> 00:59:45,472
I always imagined it was cold.

892
00:59:46,774 --> 00:59:52,246
Because I've got you for  my roommate... I'm so happy.

893
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:58,619
 Park Kae In's tomorrow's weather forecast. 

894
00:59:58,853 --> 01:00:01,655
 Still the air is cool, 

895
01:00:02,095 --> 01:00:09,697
 but the warm wind from my roommate next door will make my spring warmer! 

896
01:00:11,665 --> 01:00:57,126


897
01:01:00,514 --> 01:01:01,982
Park Kae In.

898
01:01:03,974 --> 01:01:06,287
Park Kae In, please go to your room and sleep.

899
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:21,335
What are you doing right now?

900
01:01:32,613 --> 01:01:34,782
If you sleep like this, you will have leg cramps.

901
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:39,186
Since you're awake now, go to your room and sleep.

902
01:01:42,256 --> 01:01:44,058
This is great!

903
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:51,832
If any other man had done what you just did, I'd have had hysterics.

904
01:01:51,832 --> 01:01:56,704
But you touched my legs and I didn't feel the slightest bit bothered.  This is so great!

905
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:59,940
Stop talking and just go to your room and sleep.

906
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:08,115
What's wrong?

907
01:02:08,115 --> 01:02:11,085
My foot hurts...

908
01:02:18,059 --> 01:02:20,627
Yes, there.

909
01:02:20,627 --> 01:02:21,862
Jin Ho...

910
01:02:21,862 --> 01:02:24,365
It hurts...

911
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:29,036
Jin Ho, it hurts... Please be more gentle...

912
01:02:38,846 --> 01:02:40,314
Can you be quiet?

913
01:02:40,314 --> 01:02:44,251
Jin Ho... yes... like that...

914
01:02:44,251 --> 01:02:45,619
That feels so much better!

915
01:02:52,526 --> 01:02:54,428
I don't think I can do it anymore because you're making so much noise.

916
01:02:55,963 --> 01:02:58,599
It's getting late. Hurry up and go to bed.

917
01:03:00,868 --> 01:03:03,838
Can you do it a little longer? It made me feel so much better.

918
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:06,173
I don't think I can because my arms are sore.

919
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:09,910
I'm a renter, not your damn servant!

920
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:18,085
Anyways... Thanks for everything. Having a gay  roommate is so cool!
