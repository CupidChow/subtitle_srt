There used to be a glass floor up there.

On nice days, it was enough for sunlight to pass.

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,600
While your mother worked,

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,200
she would watch you play upstairs through the glass.

 - Mom.   
 - But, why was this room covered up?

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,600
 - Mom, mom.  
 - The structure of this room is ingenious and very clever.

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,700
Kae In, what's wrong?

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,800
Kae In!

16

Hey, Park Kae In!

Are you back to your senses?

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,900
I... had a nightmare.

This won't do. I'll get medicine for you.

28
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,400
I don't want you to.

29
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,600
Don't go.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,700
I'm scared.

31
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,100
Don't worry.

Jin Ho...

49
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,800
You're awake?

50
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,300
How are you feeling?

51
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,500
A lot better.

52
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,700
I have drawn some hot water. Go take a bath.

53
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,400
You will feel better.

54
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,000
This is really nice.

55
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,200
Do you like it?

56
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,500
This was bought especially for you in Jeju Island.

57
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,000
I really like it.

58
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,900
That's a relief.

59
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,000
When I smelled the aroma,

60
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,900
I thought of you immediately, Kae In.

61
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,200
What feeling did you have at that time?

62
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,600
A very refreshing feeling.

63
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,800
You know, this is my first time blow-drying someone's hair.

64
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,900
This is the first time someone is blowing my hair dry for me.

65
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,700
Feels weird...

66
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,200
Give it, I'll do it.

67
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,200
In the future, please avoid getting sick.

68
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,900
I won't leave you

69
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,700
alone without caring.

70
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,400
 Hey, get in! 

71
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,700
So embarrassing!! What are you doing?

72
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm a big pervert!

73
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,300
So comical. You have a lot of impersonations!

74
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,800
Oh, really...

75
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,800
But unni, where were you going to?

76
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,100
"Unni"? Oh, please...

77
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,500
- Stop it. 
- I'm used to calling you that, Can't help it.

78
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,600
Aigoo, Kae In is sick.

79
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,400
This is some porridge for her.

80
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,600
Is that so?

81
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,700
How about you?

82
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Jin Ho wants me to give him some documents.

83
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,700
Which lane are you going?!

84
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,900
You have found a suitable location for the office?

85
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Well, not yet.

86
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,700
You... I don't mean anything here,

87
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,700
but if Kae In loans the money to Jin Ho...

88
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,500
Even if she loans him, he will never accept it.

89
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,700
Really?

90
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,400
Why?

91
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,300
Actually, Han Chang Ryul was the one who invested in Do-Il Furniture.

92
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,100
How can you expect Jin Ho to accept the money?

93
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,900
Oh really, that crazy jerk!

94
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,900
We should tell Kae In then.

95
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,700
Because he likes Kae In too much,

96
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,500
Jin Ho didn't want to do anything.

97
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,200
What should we do?

98
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,900
Kae In thinks her father will finally acknowledge her...

99
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,000
It's cold...

100
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,900
Did we come in at a wrong time?

101
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,200
You are here.

102
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,000
Hey, are you looking for an audience so early in the morning?

103
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,500
That's what I'm saying...

104
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,200
Oh! Yeah...

105
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,300
Kae In, isn't that too warm?

106
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,300
It's so hot today... This isn't hell, is it?

107
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,500
Ahahah.

108
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,100
How is it hot? Jin Ho said that you won't catch a cold if it's hot.

109
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,400
Ah! Really!

110
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,300
Right right... Jin Ho, you are so handsome, strong and fit.

111
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,300
I cooked fish porridge for you early in the morning,

112
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,800
and I rushed here to see you 2 being so loving...

113
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,500
Hey please... I'm really sick.

114
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,100
Yes, Tae Hoon. What's the matter?

115
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,500
Hyung, what do we do?

116
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,000
Why?

117
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,700
What's going on?

118
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,100
We received a complaint!

119
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,200
And you guys aren't here...

120
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,700
What?

121
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,000
If the printer isn't working,

122
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,400
take a closer look at the cartridge.

123
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,200
What?

124
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,500
What are you saying?!

125
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,800
The person is calling the office repeatedly!

126
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,600
Just because of this minor thing, and you call me so early in the morning?

127
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,800
I'll be on my way shortly.

128
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,100
Don't worry. Wait for me.

129
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,300
I'm sorry.

130
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,500
I wanted to accompany you today.

131
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm all right. I feel much better now. Don't worry, just go.

132
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,000
But just repairing a printer.... needs both of us?

133
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,500
Still gotta work...

134
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,800
Young Sun,

135
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,100
I'll leave Kae In in your care.

136
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,000
Right, right... How sick can she be?

137
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,700
Oh! You are really sick!

138
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
See... You are looking dazed.

139
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,100
Then...

140
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,400
Unni, I'll call you later.

141
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,700
Are we dating?

142
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,000
Go!

143
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,500
Hey! Hey! Hey!

144
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Hey! Hey!

145
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,800
Is something wrong?

146
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,300
Did you drive?

147
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,200
Here.

148
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,800
We'll talk while on the road.

149
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,700
Thank you.

150
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,700
Hmm... I don't  think you're sick.
Your appearance looks just fine.

151
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,700
Cheeks so rosy.

152
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,400
Are you really sick?

153
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,700
I am really sick!!

154
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,300
And you can still have such an appetite?

155
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,000
I need to eat up and recover quickly... So Jin Ho

156
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,100
won't be worried.

157
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,600
What is the problem Jin Ho has, do you know?

158
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,100
I know what?

159
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,200
Sigh... It's okay.

160
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,700
No need to say it.

161
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,100
When you become a real woman in future,

162
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,700
you will understand what Jin Ho really needs.

163
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,900
I...

164
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,900
am a real woman now...

165
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,100
When he was taking care of you... Hmm?

166
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,100
Kiss...

167
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,300
Hey! Kissing different physical areas has different meanings!

168
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,000
Kissing the back of the hand, it means he can't bear to part with you.

169
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,100
Kissing the forehead, it means he trusts you.

170
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,300
Kissing the nose bridge, it means he loves you.

171
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,900
Th...Then...

172
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,300
What about the back of the neck?

173
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,200
It means he wants...

174
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,300
He did that? Jin Ho?

175
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,300
Did he really kiss you there?

176
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,500
Yeah...

177
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,800
Not bad!!

178
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,400
It's good...The chance is here!

179
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,900
Go to your room now.

180
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,600
Yes, you came.

181
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,900
Foreman!

182
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,000
I kept pleading with him not to cause trouble,

183
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,100
but in the end, he still did it.

184
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,100
This happened after the incident at the site?

185
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,500
There was no problem...

186
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,700
You saw it too!

187
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,900
There was nothing major.

188
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,400
Then what is the problem now exactly?

189
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,500
You look fine now. Why did you want to get hospitalized?

190
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,700
I'm not feeling fine!

191
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,300
Didn't you recover already?

192
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,600
My leg still hurts like hell!

193
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,600
If I have the slightest movement, 
My head will get dizzy and I can't work.

194
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,500
If there are any after effects from your injury, 
of course you must recover.

195
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,200
For the recovery fees, we will take care of it.

196
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,800
See here, the manager is taking care of the fees now.

197
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,300
So just withdraw your complaint.

198
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,900
We aren't strangers, do not be like this.

199
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,900
Err, I'm saying... Just recovering I...

200
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,800
I might spend a lot of money in future. 
Just trusting him like this,

201
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,200
What happens if he is lying?

202
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,500
He wouldn't lie...

203
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,100
It is best to use the law to be sure.

204
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,800
Recently, there was someone

205
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,600
who was asking all the site workers 
if there were any problems.

206
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,800
Are you working for him behind our backs now?

207
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:54,100
Who is working for whom now!?

208
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,000
What was that supposed to mean?

209
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,500
Don't tell me...

210
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,700
there is someone who is investigating us secretly?

211
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,000
Director Jeon,

212
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,700
Do you have someone in mind that is 
planning against you by chance?

213
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,600
Or...

214
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,700
have you offended anyone recently?

215
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,000
Hyung, head back to the office first.

216
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,500
You came?

217
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,800
Just what are you planning?

218
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,900
Planning fun.

219
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
What did you say?

220
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
This is what you did.

221
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,500
An eye for an eye.

222
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,900
What have I done wrong?

223
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,400
Why did you move in to Sang Go Jae?

224
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,200
You knew beforehand that the Dam Arts Center concept...

225
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,600
is the Sang Go Jae design, right?

226
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,600
The main reason for moving in to Sang Go Jae... 
If Kae In knew about this, would she let you off?

227
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,800
You pretended to be gay. 
It's all an act to move in there, isn't it?

228
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,200
The reason for moving in to Sang Go Jae isn't important.

229
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,800
I love Kae In with my real feelings.

230
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,800
Jeon Jin Ho...

231
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,600
Do you know the story of the boy who cried wolf?

232
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,900
You are that boy now.

233
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,900
Whatever you say now, you think Kae In will believe you?

234
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,800
She will.

235
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,200
All right then,

236
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,400
keep trusting on that then.

237
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,100
I want to see

238
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,300
how you can tolerate it till then.

239
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,600
That's right!

240
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,700
Don't have to hide, just keep watching.

241
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,200
You are still planning on making use of Kae In to the end?

242
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,800
Is it because you are planning to take revenge against my father?

243
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,900
How much hurt are you planning on causing Kae In, 
who loves you so...

244
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,900
Just because of revenge?

245
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,900
Think whatever you like.

246
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:57,200
The next exhibition concept will be based on interacting with the audience.

247
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,400
I think the exhibition hall's regulations 
are not that important.

248
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,600
I will follow your suggestions 
and prepare for the exhibition opening.

249
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,900
Alright.

250
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,800
Kim In Hee, whenever you are assisting me,

251
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,100
I can set my mind at ease.

252
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,100
By the way!

253
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,000
I was looking though profiles, and today is Park Kae In's birthday...

254
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,800
Right?

255
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,900
Ah... Yes.

256
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,200
In that case,

257
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,600
I understand, get to work.

258
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:35,200


259
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,800
It's Kae In's birthday today, did you know?

260
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,200
Birthday?

261
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,500
That's right.

262
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,900
Last year, you said you were holding a party for her.
She was anticipating it eagerly.

263
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,100
But you forgot about it, Chang Ryul, didn't you?

264
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,400
So I did that to her...

265
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,200
I actually planned to "forget it" this year,

266
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,100
but I thought you should know.

267
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Okay.

268
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,700
But...

269
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,800
Can I present her with a birthday gift?

270
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,600
It's just the thought that counts for a present.

271
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,400
Then...

272
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,700
what would be a good present?

273
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,400
Do I even have to tell you that?

274
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,800
Looking for me?

275
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,900
Yeah.

276
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,600
Firstly, prepare 100 long stem roses.

277
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Then contact the jewelry store. 
Tell them to bring their new products over.

278
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,800
Yes, I understand.

279
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,100
That's not it.

280
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,300
No.

281
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Forget my orders. Get out now.

282
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,800
Yes.

283
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,600
Alright...

284
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,300
Park Kae In isn't Kim In Hee...

285
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,100
If that's the case..

286
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,500
Yes! Yes! Very nice! Very nice!

287
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,100
Yeah!

288
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,100
Just what are you doing?! So embarrassing!

289
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,200
What's so embarrassing?

290
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,300
If a man does this,

291
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,700
it means he has it all planned out.

292
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,500
Plan... what?

293
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,900
Why can't you listen!?

294
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,700
It takes 2 hands to clap.

295
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,600
It takes 2 hands to clap.

296
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,300
So...

297
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,400
Never mind... Just a minute!

298
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,400
Hey!

299
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
It's this one! This one!

300
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,200
So cute!

301
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,500
Why are you empty-handed?

302
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,000
Have you prepared the present?

303
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,000
Diamonds and pearls will not be the route to her heart.

304
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,200
Yes, I know.

305
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,100
What I know of Kae In is that she is totally different from you.

306
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,700
Is that so?

307
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,200
Chang Ryul, she will be suitable for you then.

308
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,600
Work hard!

309
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,200
I will anticipate it.

310
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,300
That Lee Young Sun...

311
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,100
Plan?

312
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,300
Plan what exactly?

313
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:33,500
How can I... For Jin Ho...

314
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,900
And here I was thinking you'd be hard at work... 
But you are thinking of Jin Ho

315
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,600
Kae In! What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

316
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,300
Err...

317
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,300
It's nothing. Just a little under the weather.

318
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,600
Why? Where are you feeling uncomfortable?

319
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,600
Is it...

320
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
because of Jin Ho?

321
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,000
Yes... I heard.

322
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,200
Jeon Jin Ho has some difficulties recently.

323
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,600
Chang Ryul, being with you like this is making me uneasy.

324
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,800
I see.

325
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,900
You don't have to say it for me to understand.

326
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,400
I'm here to give you this.

327
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,700
It's a birthday gift.

328
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,300
Birthday?

329
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,400
It's your birthday today, you didn't know?

330
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,100
Oh yeah...

331
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,000
That's right...

332
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,300
It's my birthday today...

333
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,500
You never enjoyed your birthday while you were with me.

334
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,700
This... is unnecessary.

335
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,600
What do I give to someone I jilted?

336
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,500
I thought of it a lot.

337
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,800
In keeping with your character,

338
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:55,100
I thought that it would be better to give a present to Jin Ho rather than you.

339
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,200
What's this?

340
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,400
Take this money for him to find an office.

341
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,193
If it's from you, he won't reject it.

342
00:21:02,193 --> 00:21:03,400
Chang Ryul, why?

343
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,300
Didn't I say it? It's your birthday, that's why.

344
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,500
If he is happy, I think you will be happy too. That's why.

345
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,000
I'll be going!

346
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,900
Chang Ryul...

347
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,600
Kae In, I can't even do this?

348
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,300
If you gave me a bouquet of flowers, 
I would have accepted.

349
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,400
Are you really returning this to me?

350
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,900
I can't give this to Jin Ho without telling him anything.

351
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,300
I don't want to lie to him either.

352
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,000
All right then.

353
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,800
I know your character better than anyone.

354
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,500
And yet I made this mistake.

355
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,100
I understand. If that's what you want.

356
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,500
I'll be going.

357
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,900
Jin Ho,

358
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,800
are you angry?

359
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,100
I heard you came to work even when you were sick.

360
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,900
I actually wanted to drag you back home, but I guess it's not necessary now.

361
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,400
Don't be mistaken!

362
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,400
I saw it with my own eyes.

363
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,700
Passing a letter to him, anyone would be mistaken!

364
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,700
The letter isn't mine. I was returning it to him!

365
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,700
What's the contents then?

366
00:22:59,193 --> 00:23:02,193
Err... that...

367
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,800
Anyway, I didn't accept it!

368
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,800
No?

369
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,600
What is Chang Ryul using now to tempt you?

370
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,500
Is it money?

371
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,700
Don't be mistaken with Chang Ryul..

372
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,600
I see that he is supporting you from behind...

373
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,400
He supporting me?

374
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,800
I'm so moved to death.

375
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,900
What about you? Am I in your thoughts? I think it's just a little.

376
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,600
How can you...

377
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,800
talk to me like this?

378
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,200
Thank you.

379
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,000
You have resigned from the One-Sided Love Club already,

380
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,900
Why do you look so down?

381
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,300
Because of Jeon Jin Ho?

382
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,500
Park Kae In,

383
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,000
when you were in school, did you study math well?

384
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,300
Math?

385
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,500
No... I didn't fare well.

386
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,500
What about you, Director Choi?

387
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,600
I didn't fare well either.

388
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,800
I used to...

389
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,100
envy my friends who fared well in math.

390
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,100
If love can be...

391
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,300
calculated like math,

392
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,900
there wouldn't be any hurt,

393
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,200
nor would there be any misunderstanding.

394
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,600
There is only...

395
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,200
mutual love.

396
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,300
Isn't there?

397
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,300
Jeon Jin Ho's math...

398
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,000
must have fared worse than us.

399
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,300
It's tickets to the Ice Rink.

400
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,500
You and Jin-Ho,

401
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,400
both of you must be together.

402
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,700
Thank you.

403
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:34,200
The deadline for the tickets is today.

404
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,400
Happy Birthday.

405
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,000
Thank you.

406
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:04,500


407
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,600
 Are you really in love with her, 

408
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,800
 Jeon Jin Ho? 

409
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,900
 Park Kae In... 

410
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,600
 Why are you such a fool when it comes to love? 

411
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,800
It's not right...

412
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,700
You shouldn't help them in this matter.

413
00:26:44,793 --> 00:26:49,493
Why don't you do something

414
00:26:49,493 --> 00:26:51,293
that they can't discover?

415
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:55,000
Saying it is easier.

416
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,300
How can you know about this? 
You haven't even been married before.

417
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,900
Forget it. Let's act according to plan.

418
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,100
How do we act to plan?

419
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,000
It's not difficult! Prepare a cake...

420
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,600
Of course.

421
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,500
Light candles! Turn on the music!

422
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,700
Then there is wine chilled in a wine cooler.

423
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,300
Of course!

424
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,600
We can open the bottle of wine,

425
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,800
pour it out till it fills.

426
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,900
Cheers!

427
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,100
"Clink."

428
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,500
After drinking a certain amount,

429
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,100
they will turn towards each other.

430
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Yes! Just like that!

431
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,200
Good idea! This is a good plan!

432
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,700
Yes... That's how I surrendered too!

433
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Really? How romantic!

434
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,200
What do we do?

435
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,900
What romance? It's on a whole lower level.

436
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It's like a piece of chocolate and a candle!

437
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,400
With Soju, and music!

438
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,100
He put on "Ppong Jjak"... Let's not talk about it.

439
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,700
I was moving my head to the beat and caught his eyes.

440
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,500
This isn't bad too.

441
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,100
Is it?

442
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,900
Oh!

443
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:26,900
Do-Do you know it's Kae In's bi-birthday today?

444
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,100
Huh?

445
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,700
Hey!

446
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,900
Forget it. You are busy enough as it is.

447
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,200
Don't worry about my birthday. 
It's not that important anyways.

448
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,400
No, no!

449
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,850
I made Maeuntang for myself! 
I'm almost finished with it!

450
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,650
Don't worry.

451
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,400
Yeah...

452
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,200
Since when did Ramen become Seaweed soup?

453
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,000
Why are you entering other peoples' houses 
without announcing yourself?

454
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,300
This isn't any other house.

455
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,200
This is my woman's house.

456
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,400
Who is your woman?

457
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,200
Then let's just pretend I'm your man.

458
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,300
Change quickly.

459
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,400
Why?

460
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,000
Kae In's man feels bad about just now and wants to redeem himself.

461
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,100
By taking you on a date.

462
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,500
That woman says she doesn't want to date petty men.

463
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,900
Isn't a woman even pettier than him if she doesn't accept his apology?

464
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,400
I guess...

465
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,700
Today is the final day. Can't waste the tickets.

466
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,900
I'm just not letting the tickets go to waste!

467
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,200
Don't be mistaken that we are going on a date.

468
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,500
Geez!

469
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,400
What kind of clothes are you wearing?

470
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,900
Follow me.

471
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,700


472
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,000
What is it?

473
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,800
Isn't this fun?

474
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,600
Sigh...

475
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,000
Right! Let's start!

476
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,500
Okay.

477
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,300
You said it isn't a date, but this looks more and more like one.

478
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,200
Don't forget I said we can't let the tickets go to waste.

479
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,100
Who gave the tickets to you?

480
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,500
A man gave it to me as a present.

481
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,700
Present?

482
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,000
Why don't you go with him then?

483
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:15,200
That man wanted me to go with you!

484
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,900
Director Choi gave the tickets to me.

485
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,900
Why can't I undo this?

486
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,900
Careful, don't slip!

487
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,500
Jin Ho!

488
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,900
In a movie or drama series,

489
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,500
there are a lot of couples who come to the Ice Rink to skate right?

490
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,200
2 of them holding hands... Falling down together... I always wanted this scenario for myself.

491
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,400
Is that so?

492
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:51,900
What?

493
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,400
You are pretty impulsive at times...

494
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,800
It isn't like that...

495
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,400
Isn't it?

496
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,300
You wanted to hold hands together,

497
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,700
that's why you wanted to come here, isn't it?

498
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,800
It's not that! It's because Director Choi gave the tickets to me!

499
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,000
Let's go!

500
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,500
Are you okay?

501
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,500
We prepared so much...

502
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,300
If Jin Ho still can't proceed as planned, he's not gay, neither is he a man.

503
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,900
Of course!

504
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,900
Unni, only you would do so much for a friend.

505
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,100
Right?

506
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,100
Having you as a friend, I feel really...

507
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,100
happy.

508
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,500
Who? Who is your friend?

509
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,100
That's not what I mean...

510
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,700
We are just friends.

511
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,000
We...

512
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,500
just have a relationship that is indescribable.

513
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,000
Why don't we...

514
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,100
be friends starting from now?

515
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,400
Okay.

516
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,700
Okay.

517
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,200
Here!

518
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,200
Okay.

519
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,300
Goodbye, friend.

520
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,000
Friend too.

521
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,500
Aren't you headed that way?

522
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,600
No. My house is that direction.

523
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,900
Mine too.

524
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,300
There is no point in saying goodbye then!

525
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,100
Yes. We came together just now, what's wrong with you?

526
00:33:56,143 --> 00:33:57,090
You shouldn't be walking this direction!

527
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,300
It's you who shouldn't!

528
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,000
What's with you? Don't be like this!

529
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,900
Looks like you enjoyed it!

530
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,400
What? Enjoy?

531
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,800
I think it was you who enjoyed it the most!

532
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,300
When did I?

533
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,000
It's written on your face! Don't deny it.

534
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,800
Kae In, sometimes you have too much pride.

535
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,400
You could have told me it was your birthday.

536
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,100
Err... I forgot about it too!

537
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,100
Candlelights are fading off soon! I'll blow them...

538
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,300
Wait a minute.

539
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,100
Make a wish first.

540
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,200
Happy birthday.

541
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,200
Thank you.

542
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,900
What did you wish for?

543
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,400
I wished that we...

544
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,900
are truthful and honest towards each other.

545
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,400
And you weren't gay...

546
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,300
And you still impersonated one...

547
00:35:41,123 --> 00:35:44,790
Jin Ho, what did you wish for?

548
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,100
I...

549
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:52,000
wished that you would understand my real feelings for you.

550
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,600
Are you serious?

551
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,100
You want to listen?

552
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,300
Yes.

553
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,100
Do you have confidence that you won't get frightened or 
get mad at me?

554
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,700
Yes.

555
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,600
I have thought about this a lot.

556
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,300
How to tell you this...

557
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,100
Actually, Kae In, I...

558
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,800
W-wait!

559
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,400
Don't say it.

560
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,600
People say

561
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,300
that wishes don't come true if you say them out loud.

562
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,700
I... Kae In...

563
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,600
Besides the cake and candles...

564
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,500
you don't have any other presents?

565
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,200
Do you need more presents?

566
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,200
Aren't I enough of a present?

567
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:53,400
You're a present?

568
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,200
Yes.

569
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,600
You don't like it?

570
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,100
Wait...

571
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,100
Let me prepare something, I'll be right back.

572
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,700
Get ready?

573
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,800
What do you mean, get ready?

574
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,300
Right...

575
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,100
I shouldn't tell her tonight...

576
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,100
There seems to be a problem with the glass ceiling.

577
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,800
Needs a new coat of paint.

578
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,100
She'll like it if I renovate this room.

579
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,900
Yeah... He was about to express his feelings to me just now...

580
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,600
Express what?

581
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,587
Don't tell me he wants to... tonight...

582
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,300
Of course I stopped him!

583
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,500
Oh, you dumbo! You should have let him!

584
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,700
But... How can I...

585
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,100
My heart's beating real fast!

586
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:14,900
And... He said he was my birthday present.

587
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,600
That's right!! That's the way!

588
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,700
I see that Jin Ho has grown a pair!

589
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,800
He means that right?

590
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,800
Of course! But what are you doing now?

591
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:28,300
I'm stuck in a dilemma now...

592
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,100
What should I do?

593
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,300
What are you still considering?

594
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,000
Firstly, no matter what, you must wear the lingerie I bought you!

595
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,200
Bu... But...

596
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,900
What do I do when I wear this out?

597
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,400
You are literally throwing yourself to him! Any man would love it!

598
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,300
Play some simple games... Get into the right mood...

599
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,600
Must play "Skinship" games!

600
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,400
 Something that makes me happy happened. 

601
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,900
 It's being together with you... 

602
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,900
 And... 

603
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,900
 I knew it will happen... this love story. 

604
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,500
Get over here!

605
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,700
Jin Ho...

606
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,600
Did I say I wasn't coming?

607
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,800
Gentler! Gentler!

608
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,000
Jin Ho, does it hurt a lot?

609
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,500
Does it look like it doesn't?

610
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,900
Jin Ho, let me take a look...

611
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,900
What's there to see...

612
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,800
Better let me see it. You have lost 5 in a row...

613
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,000
Didn't think it will be this red...

614
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,700
Let me blow on it...

615
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,400
It's fine.

616
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,900
Let me just blow on it. It might hurt less.

617
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,200
I said it's fine.

618
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,900
Wasn't it you who said to bear with it?

619
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,900
I can take all these as proof.

620
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,500
Kae In, this is proof of your feelings for me!

621
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,100
Oh really!! How petty can you be?!

622
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,100
It's just a game... Is this necessary?

623
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,400
Don't you know I'm very petty?

624
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,400
Jeez...

625
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,800
Why do you want to blow air on my face...

626
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,000
Aigoo...

627
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,400
Jin Ho...

628
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,600
Can you hear it?

629
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,300
This heart beating crazily...

630
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,500
The only one that can stabilize the beat...

631
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,600
is you Kae In.

632
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,400
Jin Ho...

633
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,400
I must be crazy.

634
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,200
 Don't you know what it means? 

635
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:04,700
 It means that... If you aren't sleeping with me... 

636
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,900
 I will ditch you. 

637
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,700
 Don't you know even a little of this? 

638
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,300
But...

639
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,600
am I all right like this?

640
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,100
Argh... I'm about to die.

641
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,800
 But... 

642
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,000
 A man and woman... 

643
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:44,600
 are they really in love if they sleep together? 

644
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:58,900
 To want to physically embrace the one he loves... 

645
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,200
 It's man's nature. 

646
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:20,900
 But... I'm sure there is a man out there, even without physical relations,  who will still want to be with her. 

647
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,800
Jin Ho...

648
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,600
What am I supposed to do?

649
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,800
I really want to be with Jin Ho...

650
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,900
but I'm a little scared...

651
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:49,600
If Jin Ho dislikes me being like this... What will I do?

652
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,800
Do I...

653
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,900
need to build up more courage?

654
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,100
 ­ 

655
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,800
 ­ 

656
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,800
Can... Can I sleep here?

657
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,300
N... No way!

658
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,300
But I'm scared to death!

659
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,200
What will happen to you without me?

660
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,600
What can I do... I used to do this with In Hee.

661
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,800
Come here.

662
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:42,400


663
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,600
When I was in school,

664
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,700
I didn't think of anything else besides studying.

665
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,900
School and family. It was always these two.

666
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,200
It's sad, right?

667
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,800
Did you forget that I am a man too?

668
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,700
Kae In, I will be very sad if you continue to be like this.

669
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,600
Kissing on the forehead means trust.

670
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,600
 Park Kae In's daily weather report... 

671
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:06,700
 After the thunder and lightning, 
I have gained more courage. 

672
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:12,500
 But with trust, you have protected me. 

673
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:18,400
 Don't you know how I really feel about you? 

674
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:26,900
 I hope it rains tomorrow too... 
This was the shy Park Kae In's weather report. 

675
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:55,700


676
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,900
You snored so loudly. I couldn't sleep at all.

677
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,200
Wh... When did I ever snore?

678
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,900
I can tolerate other stuff, but this is really intolerable!

679
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:21,900
This is a lie.

680
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,400
Look in the mirror! There should be traces of drool on your lips.

681
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,700
Since when has women became beasts when they are asleep?

682
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,600
Stop saying that!

683
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,000
Good for you!

684
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:37,900
Aaah...You gave me a fright!

685
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
You have finally proceeded another step forward.

686
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,100
What are you talking about now?

687
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,800
You have proven you are a real man this time! 
After the lights are turned off.

688
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,800
And here I was worried about you!

689
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,600
It wasn't like that. Don't think of it that way.

690
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,700
You can spare me the details... 
Just give me a brief summary!

691
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,500
The both of you have advanced to such?

692
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,800
What about Hye Mi?

693
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:07,600
Don't keep saying "What about Hye Mi? What about Hye Mi?" 
Why don't you "What about Hye Mi" yourself?

694
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,700
But what should I really do?

695
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,000
Teach him.

696
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,800
I said nothing happened!

697
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,000
See! It's this forcefulness.

698
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,900
Forcefulness is the key!

699
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,900
Forceful!

700
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:31,600
One, two... three!

701
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,600
Sleep... Yes, we slept together.

702
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,400
Just held hands together...

703
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,600
That's called sleeping together?

704
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,800
Argh... So annoying.

705
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,200
Being you is enough... Jin Ho, he too...

706
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,200
Don't you think it's so cool?

707
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:51,300
To protect the woman he loves...

708
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:56,000
He is my perfect man, Jin Ho.

709
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,800
Then you can hold hands together 
with him forever and live your dream.

710
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,400
Kae In, smile!

711
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,300
But why are you always taking pictures here?

712
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,700
It's all because of you.

713
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:14,200
The Dam Art Gallery's main furniture designer, Park Kae In!

714
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:19,200
With a title like that, do you know how much it will do for your portfolio?

715
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,300
As I said, why do I have to do such things?

716
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:27,500
It is very difficult to satisfy a customer if it's like that.

717
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,500
In 2 weeks time, do your utmost to utilize the space.

718
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,100
Yes, I understand.

719
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,900
After I sign the contract with Do-Il Furniture, 
I won't even have much time for other matters.

720
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,300
Kae In, then Chang Ryul...

721
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,200
Don't mention Chang Ryul to me!

722
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:51,000
When I think back to yesterday... 
How he caused me and Jin Ho to fight...

723
00:50:51,012 --> 00:50:52,683
What? What happened?

724
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,500
It's... Yesterday Chang Ryul he told me...

725
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,100
Park Kae In.

726
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,600
Hard at work, I see.

727
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,800
You didn't receive any presents when you were both dating. 
You only received one after he dumped you.

728
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,300
Hey! Hey! You can't see me?

729
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,300
Am I invisible?

730
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,300
Since when have we greeted each other?

731
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:19,800
You are itching for a fight?

732
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:23,300
Hey! I hear a wild dog barking.

733
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,000
You and your tongue are still the same.

734
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,100
What did you say?

735
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,500
You bitch!

736
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,700
Stop it.

737
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,700
Forget it. I won't cause a scene here.

738
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:37,300
But, you received a present from Chang Ryul?

739
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,000
No.

740
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,200
Yes, you did. I heard he prepared a big surprise for you on your birthday.

741
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,400
Why did you tell Chang Ryul it was my birthday?

742
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,600
To let the both of you be together.

743
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:54,200
Kim In Hee , will you be happy if you manage to get me and him together?

744
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:58,100
If that's the case, you can be together with Jin Ho, am I right?

745
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,100
Park Kae In!

746
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,400
I didn't know you were bored enough to remember my birthday.

747
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,900
But I'm a person that's so busy that 
I almost forgot it's my birthday.

748
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,000
So can you please leave now?

749
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,400
Park Kae In! Well done!

750
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,900
And I thought that I can assist you from the sideline! You did great!

751
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,500
I learnt it all from you.

752
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,500
That's right.

753
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:49,800
Hye Mi, there's something I would like you to take care of.

754
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:26,100
 Manager,  you must have a keen interest in Park Chul Han's Sang Go Jae's design. 

755
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,100
 So I asked him to design the plans, but I was rejected. 

756
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,700
 When Sang Go Jae was almost completed, Park Chul Han's wife passed away unexpectedly. 

757
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,600
 From then onwards, I heard that Sang Go Jae has never been opened to the public. 

758
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:51,300
 I built Sang Go Jae because of my wife and daughter, to help expand their creative minds. 

759
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,500
What I think...

760
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,200
is there's something wrong with this information.

761
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,600
You and I both have stepped into Sang Go Jae.

762
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:42,100
But no matter how much I see this, there is something missing to tie it with the Dam Arts Center.

763
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:53,800
So I'm thinking... How about if you asked Kae In?

764
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,700
Err, my idea is...

765
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:01,900
Kae In is the daughter, right? She should know a little at least.

766
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,100
Hyung,

767
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,000
you really want me to become a villain?

768
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,900
You rascal...

769
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:12,000
It's a different situation now!

770
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,700
No matter how much you are in love with Kae In,

771
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,700
we have someone complaining about us. 
We are even being evicted from the office!

772
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:20,200
It's not the time to say who is right or wrong.

773
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,800
I will take care of it.

774
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:30,400
So int the future, hyung, please don't mention 
this matter about Kae In ever again.

775
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,800
I'm asking you.

776
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,700
When you were with Miss Park,

777
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:43,900
have you ever heard her mentioning Professor Park's Sang Go Jae design?

778
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,800
I investigated some.

779
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:51,700
Sang Go Jae isn't an ordinary Hanok house.

780
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,900
What is it then?

781
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:58,500
It's a small part of Professor Park's main design.

782
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:07,400
No wonder Director Choi keeps wanting Professor Park to oversee the design.

783
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,900
Right.

784
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:11,700
If Professor Park's design blueprint was in our hands...

785
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:16,900
the Dam Arts Center project would be ours naturally!

786
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,800
Hello.

787
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,900
Is this your first time visiting the Dam Art Gallery?

788
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,100
Ah, yes.

789
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,200
Let me guide you.

790
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,500
Umm... you are?

791
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,500
Ah, I haven't introduced myself yet, I apologize.

792
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:49,300
Dam Art Gallery Director, Choi Do Bin.

793
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,900
A-ah, yes.

794
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:55,000
Is there any section of special interest to you?

795
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:59,800
I am looking for someone that works here... Miss Kim In Hee.

796
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,500
Ah, Kim In Hee?

797
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,200
Kim In Hee...

798
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,500
What business do you have with her?

799
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,600
No.

800
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:12,300
I am... Jeon Jin Ho's mother.

801
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,800
Ah, mother.

802
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,500
I came out because you looked like a mother lost.

803
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,600
You are a real beauty.

804
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,700
Yo... You are over-exaggerating...

805
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:30,300
I heard that I was pretty when I was young but...

806
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,100
If you are fine with that, let me introduce you to her.

807
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:36,500
I... I will gladly accept.

808
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:41,800
I hope I am not taking up too much of your precious time.

809
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,500
No. It is an honor.

810
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,600
I can accompany such a talented man's mother,

811
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,100
I feel that you are no different from my mother.

812
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:53,700
Err no.... Letting you think that I'm your mother is a bit...

813
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,200
Age factor...

814
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:59,100
Yes, that's not right. Here, let me guide you.

815
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,900
Ah, yes.

816
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,200
Mother.

817
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,100
Hello.

818
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,600
Hello.

819
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,800
Ah, Jin Ho...

820
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:04,100
This is why I can't take my eyes off you for a bit.

821
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,600
Am I so pretty?

822
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,100
Yes.

823
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,400
Didn't you say you can't take your eyes off me even for a bit?

824
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,300
Don't you feel embarrassed saying that?

825
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,800
No, I'm not.

826
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:25,300
I have been working hard all day, I haven't had a bite to eat! I'm so hungry.

827
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:29,700
Then you should have said it earlier. We could have went for dinner instead of meeting here.

828
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,700
Let's go.

829
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,400
Going to eat?

830
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,400
I heard from Hye Mi...

831
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,400
What is the matter?

832
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:47,400
I deliberated with myself on whether to tell you or not.

833
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:50,700
But in the end, I think I should tell you about this matter.

834
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:51,700
What matter?

835
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:55,800
Jin Ho, lately he... has been caught in a tight spot.

836
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,600
What tight spot?

837
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:01,600
It's the matter of Jin Ho dating Park Kae In.

838
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:07,200
Han Chang Ryul is trying to separate them, by pressuring Jin Ho.

839
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:09,600
He is being evicted from his office...

840
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:12,400
And he might have a lawsuit on his hands.

841
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,900
Wha-What are you saying?

842
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:20,200
If from the start Park Kae In had come clean with Han Chang Ryul,

843
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,400
this wouldn't have happened.

844
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,600
During this period when she is dating Jin Ho,

845
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,200
Han Chang Ryul...

846
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:29,800
She is two-timing both of them.

847
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:41,100
If Jin Ho doesn't break up with Park Kae In, who knows what Chang Ryul will do.

848
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,000
I...

849
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,500
What can I do?

850
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:53,200
Mother, what if you talked to Park Kae In instead?

851
01:00:58,443 --> 01:01:03,477
You should go back home now, Jin Ho. You haven't been back home for 2 days. Your mother will worry.

852
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,700
I don't have anywhere else to go besides Sang Go Jae.

853
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:08,300
Don't be stubborn, just go.

854
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:13,200
Kae In, how are these?

855
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,000
Aah, really...

856
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:17,800
It doesn't matter even if I were to sleep on the office couch.

857
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,800
But I just can't go back home.

858
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,400
You are really not going home?

859
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,400
Didn't I say it? I don't have anywhere else to go besides Sang Go Jae.

860
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:33,400
If she still thinks of herself as a human, she will not object to your wishes.

861
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,400
But...

862
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:40,800
Miss, why are you saying this to me?

863
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:46,500
What I heard from Hye Mi, because of Park Kae In... your marriage with Chang Ryul was wrecked too?

864
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:52,700
If Jin Ho and Park Kae In had a happy ending, you could get back with Han Chang Ryul.

865
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:56,300
I can set my personal feelings aside.

866
01:01:56,300 --> 01:02:00,700
Jin Ho is trying to win the rights to design the Dam Arts Center.

867
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:05,500
As he is a man with talent, the Director and I are supporting him.

868
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:09,400
If he is distracted because of this, we will be very worried.

869
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,400
I want to help all I can too.

870
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,400
Please don't worry too much.

871
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,900
Don't you trust me?

872
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,800
Before my mother approves of us, I have confidence I can win your hand.

873
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:38,000
Why do you have to go to such extent?

874
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,700
Because I want to be with you.

875
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,900
I want you to...

876
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,100
be acknowledged as my woman.

877
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,800
Thank you.

878
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,600
At this time,

879
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:07,700
I am feeling thankful, so I'm thanking you.

880
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:16,900
