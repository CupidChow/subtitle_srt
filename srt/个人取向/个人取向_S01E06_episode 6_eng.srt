1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,746
Park Kae In, would you please...

2
00:00:02,746 --> 00:00:07,446
Jin Ho! How long were you planning on hiding this from everybody? Huh?

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,848
What are you talking about? There's nothing to hide.

4
00:00:10,848 --> 00:00:14,590
You have to clean up this mess once and for all!

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,290
I told you about the tremendous wounds that love can inflict on people.

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:22,894
Think about what wounds you may inflict on this young lady!

7
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:29,703
What are you doing now?

8
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,109
Come with me.

9
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:37,609
Oppa!

10
00:00:42,384 --> 00:00:44,384
Are you okay?

11
00:00:44,384 --> 00:00:45,185
Yes.

12
00:00:48,755 --> 00:00:51,259
So why did you come here in the first place?

13
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,626
Did I do something wrong?

14
00:00:52,626 --> 00:00:53,826
You're okay.

15
00:00:53,826 --> 00:00:58,665
I didn't do anything wrong.

16
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:09,567
Aigoo! Geez!

17
00:01:09,967 --> 00:01:13,467
This is going too far, how long do you 
think you'll be able to hide it, huh?

18
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:17,067
That girl is in love with a gay man. When she finds out, she'll probably want to kill herself...

19
00:01:17,967 --> 00:01:19,867
I feel so sorry for her...

20
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:22,367
And why do I have to be the one drenched in water?

21
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:24,467
After I got all dressed up and pretty too.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,057
What can I do about this?

23
00:01:54,057 --> 00:01:56,325
Oppa, how can you treat me like this?

24
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,025
How could you do this to me?

25
00:01:58,025 --> 00:01:58,725
Hey!

26
00:01:58,725 --> 00:02:00,361
Stop crying.

27
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:01,761
You look like a panda!

28
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:04,264
Yeah, when Kim Yuna cries on television, 
her mascara isn't running!

29
00:02:04,264 --> 00:02:09,537
Why don't you just use what she's using?  Aigoo!

30
00:02:09,537 --> 00:02:11,037
So why did you even have to be here?

31
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:12,273
What is your relationship with that woman?

32
00:02:12,273 --> 00:02:13,473
What is she to you?

33
00:02:13,473 --> 00:02:15,477
Oppa, why would you take her to a function like this?!

34
00:02:15,477 --> 00:02:17,877
I told you, there's nothing going on with her.

35
00:02:17,877 --> 00:02:20,281
Hye Mi, I'm asking you to leave, please.

36
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:21,881
There's really nothing going on between you two?

37
00:02:21,881 --> 00:02:22,650
Tae Hoon,

38
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,750
take her away.

39
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,650
Got it.

40
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,155
Oppa! Oppa!

41
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:29,224
Put me down!

42
00:02:29,224 --> 00:02:31,324
There's really nothing going on?!

43
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:37,097
Nothing going on between you two, right?

44
00:02:37,097 --> 00:02:39,033
Oppa!

45
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:45,445
Will Kae In be okay after all that?

46
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:54,582
You go ahead and mingle with the other guests, 
I'll go look for Park Kae In.

47
00:02:54,582 --> 00:02:56,682
Yes. I got it.

48
00:03:10,797 --> 00:03:13,300
Why did you have to expose Kae In to that?

49
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,300
Mind your own business.

50
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,273
It was all your fault that woman 
spilled water all over Kae In, wasn't it?

51
00:03:18,273 --> 00:03:20,207
Getting all concerned about her now, are you?

52
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:21,108
After all this time?

53
00:03:21,108 --> 00:03:21,908
What?

54
00:03:21,908 --> 00:03:28,413
A guy who did what you did to her at her 
best friend's wedding has no right to talk.

55
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,231
It seems your relations with the 
female sex are quite complicated.

56
00:03:45,231 --> 00:03:51,372
Looks like I'm not the only woman 
who gets strong male vibes from you.

57
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,540
Kim In Hee?

58
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,849
Ah, Park Kae In, where did you run off to?

59
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,021
 

60
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:10,356
Where are you?

61
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:13,159
You've been in there this whole time?

62
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,497
Just come out as soon as you've dried up.

63
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,168
Anyway, I'd like to apologize.

64
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:24,337
It was my fault you had to suffer all that.

65
00:04:24,337 --> 00:04:26,839
Um, Jin Ho...

66
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:29,309
All of that's fine and all...

67
00:04:29,309 --> 00:04:31,110
Is something wrong?

68
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,579
What's wrong with your voice?

69
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:34,581
Um, well...

70
00:04:34,581 --> 00:04:38,817
I need... one of those... things.

71
00:04:38,817 --> 00:04:41,021
They have little wings...

72
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:42,021
What?

73
00:04:42,021 --> 00:04:43,856
Wings?

74
00:04:43,856 --> 00:04:45,891
What's with wings?

75
00:04:45,891 --> 00:04:48,027
Um, well...

76
00:04:48,027 --> 00:04:50,997
To say it clearly,  today is that day...

77
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:54,334
That... That day?

78
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:57,002
What day is it exactly?

79
00:04:57,002 --> 00:05:01,806
She...! The things she expects me to do!

80
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,056
Wow,  he's so good-looking!

81
00:05:17,056 --> 00:05:18,391
How fine!

82
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:23,260
Aw,  just look at him.

83
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,965
He looks so cool reading a book too.

84
00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:28,701
What to... Oh!

85
00:05:32,872 --> 00:05:34,807
Oh...

86
00:05:34,807 --> 00:05:37,676
He must shave with that kind of razor!

87
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:43,850
A guy shaving with one of those looks 
cooler than with an electric razor.

88
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,952
Think about what he'd look like when he shaves!

89
00:05:45,952 --> 00:05:48,588
Wow!

90
00:05:56,762 --> 00:05:59,900
Oh, he's so cool.

91
00:06:04,404 --> 00:06:08,207
Whoever she is, I sure am jealous!

92
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:12,578
I know, I wanna see who she is! So jealous.

93
00:06:12,578 --> 00:06:13,978
Oh, he's leaving!

94
00:06:15,114 --> 00:06:16,784
Bye!

95
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:28,696
Park Kae In?

96
00:06:28,696 --> 00:06:29,896
Jin Ho, over here!

97
00:06:29,896 --> 00:06:30,896
In this one?

98
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:31,665
Yes.

99
00:06:32,665 --> 00:06:34,435
How should I hand it to you, over the top or underneath?

100
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:37,636
Under here.

101
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:44,045
I told you to hurry.  My legs almost died, you know?

102
00:06:44,045 --> 00:06:47,045
Don't you know how hard it was for me too?

103
00:06:47,045 --> 00:06:49,682
But, what is the razor for?

104
00:06:49,682 --> 00:06:51,419
That... You can use it on your legs.

105
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,400
Huh?

106
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,628
Anyway,  thank you.

107
00:06:54,628 --> 00:06:56,258
I'll be outside then.

108
00:06:56,258 --> 00:06:58,558
I... I'll be right out.

109
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:00,694
"I'll be right out", yeah right. Do whatever you want!

110
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:08,601
Everything alright?

111
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:11,204
Yes.

112
00:07:11,204 --> 00:07:13,773
Women should prepare for these 
things in advance, you know.

113
00:07:13,773 --> 00:07:17,977
I'm always so busy that I don't really 
keep track of the days very well.

114
00:07:17,977 --> 00:07:21,647
You don't live with your head on straight, 
that's why you can't keep track of anything.

115
00:07:21,647 --> 00:07:24,984
Jin Ho, my purse is really small 
and I don't have any pockets, so...

116
00:07:24,984 --> 00:07:29,200
if you could just put a couple of these 
in your pocket or right in here...

117
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:32,725
Ah really, what are you doing?!

118
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:35,461
You're asking me  to hide these on me right now?!

119
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:38,499
What else is there to do? There's nowhere else, 
and I don't want to waste them.

120
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,799
What are you looking at me for?!

121
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:41,003
You could put just a few in and then...

122
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:42,104
I'll throw them away.

123
00:07:42,104 --> 00:07:44,004
- No, that's a waste! 
 - What's a waste?!

124
00:07:44,004 --> 00:07:45,104
Just a few...

125
00:07:45,104 --> 00:07:47,974
- Give them here! 
- Huh?

126
00:07:47,974 --> 00:07:49,642
You better put them in the car!

127
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:07,358
Why are you with that Jin Ho guy?

128
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:08,333
It's to do with me, isn't it?

129
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,100
And why should it have to do with you?

130
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,369
You saw the two of us fighting that time, didn't you?

131
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,869
So?

132
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:21,112
You know we're enemies, so you thought if you 
showed up together where I could see you...

133
00:08:21,112 --> 00:08:23,342
Don't be ridiculous!

134
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,714
Chang Ryul, you're not important to me any more.

135
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,721
Kae In, no matter what you say, I know you too well.

136
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:36,458
You're not that kind of person.

137
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:43,865
You're not the kind of person who can let go 
easily after you've given someone your heart.

138
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:52,140
So, what I'm trying to say is, there's no need to go to these lengths to cover up the hurt I caused you.

139
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,442
Don't flatter yourself. 
I'm quite well off without you, Chang Ryul.

140
00:08:56,442 --> 00:09:02,100
Don't flatter yourself by thinking I'm still 
reeling over what you did to me.

141
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,652
Kae In...

142
00:09:03,652 --> 00:09:06,087
Do you think I don't know you?

143
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,190
You still can't let go of me. That's why you're here to-

144
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,367
Han Chang Ryul!

145
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:20,099
I'm warning you, don't bother this lady again.

146
00:09:20,099 --> 00:09:22,837
Stay out of this, you jerk, this is between Kae In and me.

147
00:09:22,837 --> 00:09:25,505
Oh no, it's not.

148
00:09:25,505 --> 00:09:28,374
There is nothing left between you and this lady.

149
00:09:28,374 --> 00:09:29,843
Nothing.

150
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,148
Am I not right, Kae In?

151
00:09:51,165 --> 00:09:52,601
Thank you.

152
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:54,169
For taking on the role of a man.

153
00:09:56,433 --> 00:10:00,705
I feel a lot better than if I'd slapped his face.

154
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:12,318
What else are friends for?

155
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:17,821
Let's go.

156
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:29,335
On behalf of all the architects present here today...

157
00:10:29,335 --> 00:10:31,772
I sincerely hope that the Dam Arts Center...

158
00:10:31,772 --> 00:10:34,641
may be successfully constructed.

159
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,520
All of you gathered here are builders of houses.

160
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,289
Why is their house important to people?

161
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:51,700
Within our house,

162
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,834
we eat, we sleep, we have children,

163
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:56,867
and we raise those children.

164
00:10:56,867 --> 00:11:01,334
And we dream, don't we? Art is also a dream.

165
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:04,467
A space you can dream in is what 
MS Group is trying to create,

166
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:07,500
in the shape of the Dam Arts Center.

167
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,600
This evening, I hope that you all, ladies and gentleman,

168
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,634
may share in this dream. Thank you very much.

169
00:11:36,934 --> 00:11:40,600
My father used to say things very much like that.

170
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:45,467
Not directly to me, he didn't,

171
00:11:45,934 --> 00:11:48,667
but it's the sort of thing he said in his writings.

172
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:56,034
"Sang Go Jae is a small world of its own, 
a place for my wife and my child to dream."

173
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,134
That's why I feel apologetic to my father.

174
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:07,467
I must seem to him like someone 
who lives her life without a single dream.

175
00:12:37,734 --> 00:12:40,534
 Why is their house important to people? 

176
00:12:40,534 --> 00:12:43,867
 Within our house, we eat, we sleep, 

177
00:12:43,867 --> 00:12:46,367
 we have children, and we raise those children. 

178
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,234
 And we dream, don't we? 

179
00:12:49,234 --> 00:12:52,067
 Art is just that dream. 

180
00:12:52,867 --> 00:12:56,267
 "Sang Go Jae is a small world of its own, 

181
00:12:56,267 --> 00:12:59,634
 a place where my wife and my child can dream." 

182
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:07,067
A small world of its own where one can dream...

183
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:25,000
What are you doing?

184
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,467
You're not going to sleep?

185
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,000
There's no pain reliever.

186
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,700
Why do you need pain medication?

187
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,000
Do you have a headache?

188
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,383
No.

189
00:13:35,383 --> 00:13:37,100
It's because I'm having menstrual cramps.

190
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,367
Then, you should have stopped at a pharmacy on the way.

191
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:42,034
They're all closed at this time, remember?

192
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:45,034
Besides, I thought we still had some at home.

193
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,500
Is it that bad?

194
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,300
Do you want me to take you to the hospital?

195
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,234
Whoever heard of going to hospital 
just for menstrual cramps?

196
00:13:58,234 --> 00:14:00,700
Exactly, so why didn't you plan for it ahead and prepare?

197
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,734
I'll just have to bear it out.

198
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,100
Is there anything I can do?

199
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,734
Never mind. I'm fine.

200
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,667
 

201
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:49,667
Drink this.

202
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,034
What is it?

203
00:14:54,034 --> 00:14:55,834
Does it hurt so much you can't even speak?

204
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:57,534
I've always suffered from menstrual pains,

205
00:14:58,267 --> 00:15:00,767
but this time they're a lot worse than usual.

206
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,567
It's fresh ginger tea.

207
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:05,767
It'll warm your body.

208
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,567
Even being in pain has a good side,

209
00:15:24,067 --> 00:15:25,200
since

210
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,567
I have a guy friend who will even 
share my menstrual pain with me.

211
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:31,867
You must be real happy.

212
00:15:32,734 --> 00:15:34,134
Drink it up, then go to sleep.

213
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:35,534
Thank you.

214
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,965
Are you sleeping?

215
00:15:42,965 --> 00:15:45,700
What's wrong? Why aren't you sleeping?

216
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:56,767
You drank all the tea and it still didn't have any effect?

217
00:15:56,767 --> 00:16:01,000
I'll just go by the pharmacy as soon as it opens tomorrow.

218
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,300
Go on off to sleep yourself now.

219
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,534
Don't be late for work tomorrow because of my problems.

220
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,034
Tomorrow is Sunday.

221
00:16:11,234 --> 00:16:12,567
Ah, so it is.

222
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:36,034
Ah, I'm so busy because of that woman, I have no life.

223
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,900
Stop crying.

224
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,834
You're going to faint.

225
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:50,767
The more I think of it, the more unfair it is.

226
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:54,434
How could Jin Ho oppa take another 
woman to that kind of function?

227
00:16:55,634 --> 00:16:58,634
I'm sure there was a good reason for it.

228
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:03,700
Don't you think Jin Ho would've introduced 
me first if there was a woman he liked?

229
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,100
Welcome home!

230
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,367
Look, Jin Ho came to comfort you.

231
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:13,734
Oppa.

232
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:14,667
Oh, alright.

233
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,300
What's the matter with you?

234
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,400
I heard you took another woman out and to that party?

235
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,467
We had to go together, it was to do with work.

236
00:17:21,467 --> 00:17:23,467
Even so, I don't like that, oppa.

237
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:26,767
I really hate it when you're with another woman!

238
00:17:28,267 --> 00:17:29,300
Jang Mi,

239
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,600
do you have some pain relievers?  
I seem to be getting a headache.

240
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,900
Me too, I have such a headache I could die.

241
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,734
Is your head hurting because of me?

242
00:17:38,234 --> 00:17:40,634
Oh, I'm just having a little headache.

243
00:17:42,034 --> 00:17:44,134
My oppa's having a headache, what should I do?

244
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:46,134
I'm okay.

245
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,000
What's this?  Why are you on the floor?

246
00:18:02,767 --> 00:18:05,500
The floor feels warmer.

247
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:09,367
Sit up and take some medicine.

248
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,234
Medicine?

249
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,634
Where did you get medicine at this time?

250
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,700
I got it at home.

251
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,867
Your home?

252
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:22,067
But,

253
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:25,200
if you have a home, why did you move in here?

254
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:30,767
Ah, that's... I mean... that house 
is really far away from my office.

255
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:32,400
Your house is that far away?

256
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:36,134
And yet you went there and came back just now?

257
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:38,438
Hurry up and take it.

258
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,334
I love you.

259
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,434
I love you, friend.

260
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:55,100
Just take this and go to bed!

261
00:18:57,667 --> 00:19:00,334
Um, friend...

262
00:19:00,334 --> 00:19:04,567
Can I ask for another favor then, please?

263
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:11,267
What am I doing right now?

264
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:15,667
Every time my period caused me so much pain,

265
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:18,034
In Hee did this for me.

266
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:22,767
Saying "Mommy's hands are healing hands."

267
00:19:23,734 --> 00:19:27,167
"Baby's got a little belly." Stuff like that.

268
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,467
We had times like that together.

269
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:42,100
I should really hate her a lot.

270
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:46,600
That way I'd be able to get over the whole thing.

271
00:19:48,267 --> 00:19:50,134
But I can't.

272
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:54,067
Because there were those times

273
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,500
I shared with In Hee.

274
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,934
I wish I could just hate her a lot,

275
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:06,000
and forget about everything.

276
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:15,300
"Daddy's hands are healing hands."

277
00:20:16,134 --> 00:20:18,367
"Baby's got a little belly."

278
00:20:21,434 --> 00:20:23,867
"Daddy's hands are healing hands."

279
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:28,000
"Baby's got a little belly."

280
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,134
"Daddy's hands are healing hands."

281
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,767
"Baby's got a little belly"

282
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,100
I'm really...

283
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,400
I am so grateful to you.

284
00:20:50,034 --> 00:20:51,767
My father

285
00:20:52,434 --> 00:20:54,700
has never done anything like this.

286
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:00,500
Jin Ho,

287
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,767
to me,

288
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:07,434
you are a great friend and like a dad.

289
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,498
Aunt Kae In!

290
00:21:45,498 --> 00:21:47,066
Kae In!

291
00:21:47,066 --> 00:21:50,168
It's been a long time 
since you've seen Aunt Kae In, huh?

292
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:51,676
Call for your aunt.

293
00:21:51,676 --> 00:21:53,839
Aunt Kae In!

294
00:21:55,074 --> 00:21:56,675
Auntie!

295
00:21:59,946 --> 00:22:01,647
What is this?

296
00:22:05,885 --> 00:22:10,055
Mom, did Aunt Kae In get married?

297
00:22:10,055 --> 00:22:11,590
No.

298
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:13,559
Hey!

299
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,160
Park Kae In!

300
00:22:16,296 --> 00:22:18,097
Kae In!

301
00:22:31,911 --> 00:22:33,612
Mister,

302
00:22:33,612 --> 00:22:36,783
when did you marry Aunt Kae In?

303
00:22:36,783 --> 00:22:37,850
It's nothing like that.

304
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,586
But then, why were you sleeping  together?

305
00:22:40,586 --> 00:22:43,422
Get out kid. Go back to your mom and stop pestering me.

306
00:22:48,128 --> 00:22:51,096
What is he so curious about?

307
00:22:51,096 --> 00:22:55,735
Hey, I know that he's gay and all that. 
But sleeping with him, aren't you going too far?

308
00:22:56,803 --> 00:22:58,003
Hey,

309
00:22:58,003 --> 00:23:03,142
my menstrual pain was so bad yesterday that Jin Ho helped by rubbing my belly, and then I must have dozed off.

310
00:23:03,142 --> 00:23:05,077
He even rubbed your belly?

311
00:23:05,077 --> 00:23:09,115
Hey, I would have really died if it weren't for Jin Ho.

312
00:23:09,115 --> 00:23:12,117
He even went home to get medicine for me.

313
00:23:12,117 --> 00:23:14,486
He's such a nice person.

314
00:23:15,054 --> 00:23:16,823
Satisfied?

315
00:23:16,823 --> 00:23:18,390
You are so lucky.

316
00:23:19,844 --> 00:23:22,361
Sleeping with him, how was it?

317
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:23,829
Young Sun,

318
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,065
we're so comfortable with each other.

319
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,102
It's amazing how things are so comfortable between us.

320
00:23:31,204 --> 00:23:33,305
It was just like when I used to sleep in my father's arms.

321
00:23:33,305 --> 00:23:35,407
It was just the same sort of feeling.

322
00:23:36,109 --> 00:23:38,177
I've never known anything like it before.

323
00:23:38,178 --> 00:23:40,713
I'm really jealous, you have such luck!

324
00:23:40,713 --> 00:23:43,415
You must've saved a nation in a past life!

325
00:23:44,183 --> 00:23:46,352
I wonder what I can have done in my former lives.

326
00:23:46,352 --> 00:23:48,120
You were...

327
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,354
a porn star.

328
00:23:50,455 --> 00:23:51,824
Say though, what are you doing here at this hour?

329
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:54,727
Jin Ho.

330
00:23:56,963 --> 00:23:58,964
Oh please...

331
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:02,368
If you're friends with Kae In, 
aren't you friends with me as well?

332
00:24:02,368 --> 00:24:05,004
I'm very sorry, but I've never done anything like that before.

333
00:24:05,671 --> 00:24:09,474
Just this once please, let me take care of it.

334
00:24:09,474 --> 00:24:11,010
I am really sorry.

335
00:24:19,352 --> 00:24:20,986
You don't know, do you?

336
00:24:20,986 --> 00:24:23,756
We can't support a family on a policeman's salary,

337
00:24:23,756 --> 00:24:27,826
so I have to shoulder the burden. 
Can't you understand I'd sometimes rather die?

338
00:24:28,576 --> 00:24:31,564
My mother-in-law and 
her mother too both live with us,

339
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:34,767
and my single sister-in-law as well, 
makes that five adults to support.

340
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:36,967
Kae In, you know all about my situation.

341
00:24:38,238 --> 00:24:41,067
I know. I know.

342
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:42,467
Who else would know that better.

343
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:44,967
I'm so proud of you!

344
00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:48,180
I'm working so hard just to make a living.

345
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,750
Working so hard to run the online shopping mall.

346
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,117
Yeah.

347
00:24:52,852 --> 00:24:55,021
Mom, don't cry.

348
00:24:55,955 --> 00:24:57,723
I'm sorry, son.

349
00:24:57,723 --> 00:24:59,992
It's just that living is so hard sometimes.

350
00:24:59,992 --> 00:25:03,996
If only this gentleman would just help us a little bit,

351
00:25:03,996 --> 00:25:06,399
but he said he would hate to do so. 
So mom's just very upset.

352
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:08,400
Mister, I hate you!

353
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,839
- Mom's okay... 
- Oh no, oh no.

354
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:16,109
You mustn't hate the gentleman, 
he just doesn't feel up to it today.

355
00:25:16,109 --> 00:25:19,978
Please, just tell me how to help you.

356
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:22,848
Hey, today's concept

357
00:25:22,848 --> 00:25:24,717
is a "happy family".

358
00:25:24,717 --> 00:25:27,553
It's such a beautiful day, that's why you're outside.

359
00:25:27,553 --> 00:25:30,522
Make it look like you're crazy happy, okay? Let's go!

360
00:25:35,527 --> 00:25:37,096
That looks so awkward.

361
00:25:37,096 --> 00:25:39,898
It looks like you're going for a dump.

362
00:25:39,898 --> 00:25:42,635
Is this how you show "happiness"?

363
00:25:42,635 --> 00:25:44,704
It feels awkward.

364
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:48,140
Hey, this is a first for me too!

365
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,643
Hey, is anyone born a model?

366
00:25:50,643 --> 00:25:52,145
You learn on the job, so just keep trying!

367
00:25:52,145 --> 00:25:53,412
You mean,

368
00:25:53,412 --> 00:25:54,547
you expect us to keep doing this?

369
00:25:54,547 --> 00:25:58,117
I dunno, we have to wait to see what the reaction is.

370
00:25:58,117 --> 00:26:03,322
But anyway. Now get hold of Joon Hyuk's arms 
and swing him between you.

371
00:26:03,322 --> 00:26:06,425
And so show how you're crazy-happy. Let's go!

372
00:26:10,697 --> 00:26:14,266
Jin Ho, you're not showing that 
you're happy right now, you know?

373
00:26:14,266 --> 00:26:17,436
You should reflect how much you love Kae In, okay?

374
00:26:17,436 --> 00:26:20,373
And Kae In, you're supposed to be Jin Ho's wife.

375
00:26:20,373 --> 00:26:24,143
You've been together for over ten years, got married,

376
00:26:24,143 --> 00:26:26,211
and now you've even got a child!

377
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:28,681
It should show how perfect you guys are!

378
00:26:28,681 --> 00:26:31,484
This time let's show how crazily happy you are, 
you could cry.

379
00:26:31,484 --> 00:26:33,252
Right, let's go!

380
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:44,797
Jin Ho, you look like you have a hangover.

381
00:26:46,332 --> 00:26:47,333
What should I be doing?

382
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:50,569
Young Sun, you know this is kind of impossible for him.

383
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:54,173
How could Jin Ho look at a woman 
with that kind of an expression?

384
00:26:54,173 --> 00:27:00,547
Is that so? Then, stop thinking about Kae In.
Just think about Sang Jun. Is that okay?

385
00:27:00,547 --> 00:27:02,014
Oh, okay, that's fine.

386
00:27:02,014 --> 00:27:03,382
Alright then!

387
00:27:04,884 --> 00:27:07,686
Let's show a real family then.

388
00:27:07,686 --> 00:27:11,156
Oh that's good, and, 1, 2, 3, go!

389
00:27:11,156 --> 00:27:14,593
Oh that's good, and,  smile at the camera!

390
00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:16,929
Wow, that's good!

391
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:22,168


392
00:27:22,168 --> 00:27:24,204
Now, you two sit down over there.

393
00:27:24,204 --> 00:27:26,239
And Kae In, you take him on your lap, right.

394
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:29,508
And so, father and son kiss mommy.

395
00:27:29,508 --> 00:27:30,409
Excuse me?

396
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:33,746
But you said you were gonna help me, didn't you?

397
00:27:33,746 --> 00:27:35,648
Aah, really... I am really going crazy.

398
00:27:35,648 --> 00:27:39,518
Quickly, put on a happy face!
Let's try that.

399
00:27:39,518 --> 00:27:41,621
Here now, let's do a kiss.

400
00:27:41,621 --> 00:27:44,023
One, two, three.

401
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:48,627
Oh, that's good. One more time.

402
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:50,596
1, 2, 3!

403
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:53,566
A bit more feeling!

404
00:27:54,434 --> 00:27:55,968
Sit here.

405
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:57,236
You want me to sit here?

406
00:27:57,236 --> 00:27:59,304
Sit like this?

407
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:01,574
I'm okay, but Jin Ho...

408
00:28:01,574 --> 00:28:04,711
My son should be right here.

409
00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:06,612
One, two, three!

410
00:28:06,612 --> 00:28:08,247
One, two, three!

411
00:28:08,247 --> 00:28:08,982
Kiss right there.

412
00:28:08,982 --> 00:28:09,782
Kiss him?

413
00:28:09,782 --> 00:28:10,316
Eh?

414
00:28:10,316 --> 00:28:11,884
Okay.

415
00:28:11,884 --> 00:28:12,885
Kiss.

416
00:28:12,885 --> 00:28:15,754
Let's go. 1, 2, 3!

417
00:28:15,754 --> 00:28:18,257
Oh that's good. One more time. One more time.

418
00:28:18,257 --> 00:28:20,059
One, two, three!

419
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:21,894
Oh that's good!

420
00:28:22,762 --> 00:28:24,464
Should we do that one more time?

421
00:28:24,464 --> 00:28:25,932
One, two...

422
00:28:25,932 --> 00:28:28,901
Hey, that's enough. We don't have to.

423
00:28:28,901 --> 00:28:30,436
Let's finish up.

424
00:28:50,023 --> 00:28:51,028
Oh my God...

425
00:28:51,658 --> 00:28:57,129
But thanks to that little bit of work we won't 
have to worry about side dishes for at least a month.

426
00:28:57,129 --> 00:29:01,567
Young Sun hasn't packed this many side dishes 
for me in all of the ten years I've known her!

427
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:03,469
This is all thanks to you.

428
00:29:03,469 --> 00:29:05,971
Oh my, oh my, oh my! 
Look at this, look at this, look at this.

429
00:29:05,971 --> 00:29:08,673
Wow, this is a whole different level!

430
00:29:08,673 --> 00:29:10,408
Omo omo.

431
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,678
Ooh, this is so yummy!

432
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:14,846
You should've done better.

433
00:29:14,846 --> 00:29:16,815
Oh, the taste is just pure art!

434
00:29:16,815 --> 00:29:18,684
Jin Ho, you should eat some.

435
00:29:18,684 --> 00:29:19,918
Eat this.

436
00:29:19,918 --> 00:29:21,420
Ugh, disgusting, you haven't even washed your hands.

437
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,987
Just eat this.

438
00:29:22,987 --> 00:29:24,256
It's really delicious.

439
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:27,392
It's tasty, right?

440
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,196
Her cooking skills are just...

441
00:29:31,196 --> 00:29:32,631
Will you go wash up first?

442
00:29:32,631 --> 00:29:35,534
Oh, I can't wash up for a few days, so you just go ahead.

443
00:29:35,534 --> 00:29:37,236
When did you ever wash often?

444
00:29:38,304 --> 00:29:41,373
But Jin Ho, you're a guy, why do you shower every day?

445
00:29:42,341 --> 00:29:44,342
It must be your orientation.

446
00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:50,150
Ah, wait a minute!

447
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:52,484
In Hee left something here, you should try it out.

448
00:29:52,484 --> 00:29:54,419
As pay back for yesterday and today.

449
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:55,755
In Hee, please!

450
00:29:55,755 --> 00:29:57,323
Why are you like this? I said I don't want to!

451
00:29:57,323 --> 00:29:58,791
I'm begging you, just this once!

452
00:29:58,791 --> 00:30:00,592
Why do I have to?

453
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:03,195
When mom leaves this time, 
nobody knows when she'll be coming back!

454
00:30:03,195 --> 00:30:04,363
What does that have to do with me?

455
00:30:04,363 --> 00:30:07,533
She wants to treat her son and 
her daughter-in-law to a meal,

456
00:30:07,533 --> 00:30:08,701
it's her one wish.

457
00:30:08,701 --> 00:30:10,236
I'm not that woman's daughter-in-law.

458
00:30:10,236 --> 00:30:12,171
Even if we end this later,

459
00:30:12,171 --> 00:30:14,039
just do this once as a favor for me, please?

460
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:18,443
It's just that mom's been really kind to me.

461
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:21,078
Don't you think you're being stupid?

462
00:30:21,112 --> 00:30:23,715
Being the filial son to the women 
your father lived with for a short time,

463
00:30:23,715 --> 00:30:26,084
still calling them "Mom, Mom!".

464
00:30:26,084 --> 00:30:27,419
Do you think that's normal?

465
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:30,455
And it's not just one or two women, it's seven!

466
00:30:32,525 --> 00:30:34,593
Don't call them 'women'.

467
00:30:34,593 --> 00:30:37,796
Every one of them is precious and a mother to me.

468
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:40,799
That's exactly why you're such an indecisive person.

469
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,836
Just like you weren't able to end it with Kae In, 
it's the same thing with those women.

470
00:30:44,836 --> 00:30:47,006
I told you not to call them 'those women'.

471
00:30:47,006 --> 00:30:50,341
I have absolutely no intention of playing 
the part of the perfect little daughter-in-law.

472
00:30:50,341 --> 00:30:52,344
So don't annoy me with things like this.

473
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,314
Hey, Kim In Hee!

474
00:31:07,687 --> 00:31:09,261
Oh, oh, mom.

475
00:31:10,963 --> 00:31:14,199
Ah, that's a bit difficult. Today...

476
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:16,501
Today just won't do.

477
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:19,004
In Hee isn't feeling very well.

478
00:31:21,073 --> 00:31:23,709
Why? You should have waited for word 
we were coming before you went to the market.

479
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:25,644
Why did you give yourself so much trouble?

480
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:31,649
No, we'll come. Of course, we'll come.

481
00:31:31,649 --> 00:31:35,887
How could we not come by once before you have to leave?

482
00:31:47,633 --> 00:31:49,534
Sang Go Jae.

483
00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:53,605
Sang Go Jae is... 'Go'...

484
00:31:53,605 --> 00:31:56,608
'gosaeng hareo' (to experience hardship).   'Jae'...

485
00:31:56,608 --> 00:31:59,811
'jaeso oebge' (unabashadly) dirty house.

486
00:32:00,947 --> 00:32:03,149
Park Kae In.

487
00:32:03,149 --> 00:32:06,752
Park Kae In is... 'Kae'...

488
00:32:06,752 --> 00:32:09,955
'kaeyeom oebneun' (without ambition).  'In'...

489
00:32:09,955 --> 00:32:12,924
'ingan gatti aneun' (unlike a human) woman.

490
00:32:18,497 --> 00:32:20,132
Knock before you enter!

491
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,668
How is it?  Refreshing, right?

492
00:32:23,668 --> 00:32:26,471
A cup of lemon tea to go with your spa.

493
00:32:26,471 --> 00:32:29,140
Here,  from the bottom of my heart.

494
00:32:31,243 --> 00:32:34,408
Since you went to such lengths yesterday, 
let me massage you.

495
00:32:34,783 --> 00:32:37,011
It's alright.

496
00:32:37,478 --> 00:32:39,214
Feels good, doesn't it?

497
00:32:39,214 --> 00:32:41,627
Hey, I told you not to!

498
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:42,803
Yes, I'll stop.

499
00:32:42,803 --> 00:32:44,180
Just go out and attend to your things.

500
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,780
Don't I make a good wife?

501
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,913
Just go and work.

502
00:32:46,913 --> 00:32:48,218
Okay.

503
00:32:49,072 --> 00:32:52,516
Just leave this as it is, I'll use it later.

504
00:32:52,516 --> 00:32:53,953
That's gross!

505
00:32:55,446 --> 00:32:57,700
Even after all I've taught you.

506
00:33:17,023 --> 00:33:19,322
Jin Ho! Hurry up, Jin Ho!

507
00:33:19,322 --> 00:33:20,547
The soup will get cold.

508
00:33:21,777 --> 00:33:23,914
Young Sun even sent us some soup.

509
00:33:23,914 --> 00:33:25,643
Doesn't it look too good to be true?

510
00:33:25,643 --> 00:33:28,047
This is what we call a feast.

511
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:30,301
Hurry up and eat.

512
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:36,414
What's that for?!

513
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,391
Do you think you've become a real woman?

514
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,802
What do you mean?

515
00:33:39,802 --> 00:33:42,936
I was absolutely perfect at the party, 
doesn't that mean I've succeeded?

516
00:33:42,936 --> 00:33:46,514
Chang Ryul even looked at me like, 
"Why did I let a girl like that go?!".

517
00:33:46,514 --> 00:33:47,580
Hurry up and give it back.

518
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,047
How can some people be so naive?

519
00:33:50,047 --> 00:33:53,280
Chang Ryul reacted like that because of his aggression towards me,

520
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,714
so what did you really prove at that party?

521
00:33:55,714 --> 00:33:57,965
Excuse me...

522
00:33:57,965 --> 00:34:00,726
I was able to keep up a civilized 
conversation with Director Choi.

523
00:34:00,726 --> 00:34:03,085
And what about needing me to run 
an errand for sanitary napkins?

524
00:34:03,847 --> 00:34:05,480
You know very well that was an unavoidable accident.

525
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,738
So you're not just lacking perseverance, 
you also have no sense of readiness.

526
00:34:09,738 --> 00:34:12,680
A heedless woman incapable of 
even remembering her period...

527
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,247
Do you think men will really fall for someone like that?

528
00:34:14,247 --> 00:34:15,433
Well...

529
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:21,647
Can we eat first and save the serious 
discussions for later, I'm so hungry I could die.

530
00:34:27,914 --> 00:34:29,207
What the...!

531
00:34:29,207 --> 00:34:30,547
There isn't even enough there to stuff up anyone's nose!

532
00:34:30,547 --> 00:34:32,883
You need to get rid of those kinds of expressions.

533
00:34:32,883 --> 00:34:34,147
Be elegant.

534
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,387
"I'm usually a light eater, I can't eat this much."

535
00:34:39,387 --> 00:34:40,280
Try it.

536
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:44,580
I'm usually a light eater, 
I can't take much more than this!

537
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,257
Do you want another waterboarding session?

538
00:34:46,257 --> 00:34:49,047
Jeez, this guy's really into torture.

539
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:52,747
Eat elegantly!

540
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,247
Park Kae In...

541
00:35:09,814 --> 00:35:11,491
What's with that?

542
00:35:11,491 --> 00:35:13,189
It's a gift.

543
00:35:13,189 --> 00:35:16,714
You went all the way home and back 
in the middle of the night for me.

544
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:19,229
I'm just a naturally good-natured person.

545
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:24,949
Even though it felt like my back might break 
making it after I was only able to eat half a rice bowl...

546
00:35:24,949 --> 00:35:27,447
But then, how is it? Do you like it?

547
00:35:27,447 --> 00:35:29,747
This is the key point.

548
00:35:29,747 --> 00:35:31,371
Well, I guess it will be useful.

549
00:35:31,371 --> 00:35:34,380
Ahhh! Geez!

550
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,914
"Kae-In, that's so perfect it looks like a brand-name piece."

551
00:35:37,914 --> 00:35:40,247
Can't you say it like that?

552
00:35:40,247 --> 00:35:41,590
That's just...

553
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,814
I'm so hungry, It's even hard to say anything more.

554
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:49,180
Would you like to eat some noodles?

555
00:35:51,463 --> 00:35:52,747
Thanks.

556
00:36:06,114 --> 00:36:08,038
Can I eat all of this?

557
00:36:08,038 --> 00:36:08,814
Go ahead.

558
00:36:08,814 --> 00:36:10,947
Yabadabadoo!

559
00:36:16,714 --> 00:36:21,247
It's just because I'm with you. 
I wouldn't use that in front of any other man.

560
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:24,214
But then, what's with you?

561
00:36:24,214 --> 00:36:27,580
You usually become the instructor 
with me and make meals into a test.

562
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,751
This is just pay back for the foot spa and the clothes hanger.

563
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,447
Enjoy your meal.

564
00:36:46,014 --> 00:36:48,647
I promise I won't be like this around 
any other man, Mr. Instructor, sir!

565
00:36:48,647 --> 00:36:49,980
Please take my word for that.

566
00:36:50,479 --> 00:36:53,176
Just don't hang on to me like that.

567
00:36:53,176 --> 00:36:54,646
But, do you come here often?

568
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,914
I sometimes come by here to eat if I get off work late.

569
00:36:59,914 --> 00:37:03,214
There are lots of places that sell noodles though, 
why do you come here?

570
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,380
It feels like setting off on a trip.

571
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:15,214
This is a place people only visit for a 
short time on their way to somewhere else.

572
00:37:15,214 --> 00:37:17,947
Have you taken a lot of trips?

573
00:37:17,947 --> 00:37:19,214
No.

574
00:37:19,214 --> 00:37:21,714
Apart from once, when I came here 
with my father when I was little.

575
00:37:21,714 --> 00:37:22,814
How come?

576
00:37:22,814 --> 00:37:25,080
Surely college students go on group trips a lot?

577
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,547
I stayed in the library.

578
00:37:26,547 --> 00:37:30,647
Wow, sounds like you were a real stick-in-the-mud.

579
00:37:30,647 --> 00:37:32,414
The ones who skip all the get-togethers 
and  just study all the time

580
00:37:32,414 --> 00:37:34,980
are supposed to be the biggest losers.

581
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:41,614
I wanted to discipline myself, you see.

582
00:37:41,614 --> 00:37:48,680
I made up my mind that till the day I get back 
what I've lost, I'm going to be harsh on myself.

583
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,814
So,  this thing you lost, what was it?

584
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,014
Let's go.

585
00:38:00,814 --> 00:38:04,280
When you get back what you lost and go on that trip...

586
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,914
be sure to take me with you! Alright?

587
00:38:06,914 --> 00:38:09,180
You have to!

588
00:38:10,514 --> 00:38:12,447
Take you with me and suffer the whole time?

589
00:38:12,447 --> 00:38:15,947
I'll be very obedient, listen to everything 
you say, and do anything you want!

590
00:38:15,947 --> 00:38:16,780
- Huh? 
- Really?

591
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,480
Take me with you.

592
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,680
I'll think about it.

593
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,580
Would it kill you to say you'll take me?

594
00:38:28,647 --> 00:38:31,647
I'm bored, let's play a word game.

595
00:38:31,647 --> 00:38:33,314
Why would I do that?

596
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:35,414
It's childish and lots of fun.

597
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:36,945
I said no.

598
00:38:36,945 --> 00:38:38,014
Ah...

599
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,914
'San dong nae'! (neighborhood)

600
00:38:43,414 --> 00:38:44,914
"nae"? (he has to come up with a word with 'nae')

601
00:38:48,947 --> 00:38:49,847
 Park Kae In... 

602
00:38:49,847 --> 00:38:52,247
 The weather forecast for tomorrow... 

603
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:57,180
 Because of a friend, neither male nor female, 
who came by on a spring breeze, 

604
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,447
 this evening is bringing warmth to my heart. 

605
00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:06,767
 But hard-to-identify small eddies 
arising in the atmosphere... 

606
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:10,314
 suggest that unusual developments 
are getting under way. 

607
00:39:13,914 --> 00:39:18,847


608
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,670
You took time out of your busy schedule to meet with me.

609
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,647
I really appreciate that, President.

610
00:39:28,647 --> 00:39:32,659
Through this Dam Arts Center project, you will be making

611
00:39:32,659 --> 00:39:36,680
a massive contribution to our cultural life.

612
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,080
That's what people are already saying everywhere.

613
00:39:40,214 --> 00:39:44,180
I've a reputation as an entrepreneur myself,

614
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:47,047
but even being a pale imitation of you...

615
00:39:47,047 --> 00:39:49,380
would be no easy matter.

616
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,214
I think such compliments are best kept back

617
00:39:52,214 --> 00:39:55,134
until the Dam Arts Center is successfully completed.

618
00:39:55,134 --> 00:39:57,147
Ah! Yes.

619
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,347
But for that reason, there's just one thing I'd like to raise ...

620
00:40:02,347 --> 00:40:06,747
I know that in view of the grand schemes your son has,

621
00:40:06,747 --> 00:40:07,947
and that he's the driving force behind this project,

622
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:12,447
it would probably be a waste of time, but all the same...

623
00:40:12,447 --> 00:40:15,047
Wait. What would be a waste of time?

624
00:40:15,047 --> 00:40:16,785
Ah! What I mean is...

625
00:40:16,785 --> 00:40:20,825
Holding an open competition is a good thing, but...

626
00:40:20,825 --> 00:40:22,014
Just supposing..

627
00:40:22,014 --> 00:40:27,847
some completely unqualified tinpot outfit were 
to rush in with a scheme they couldn't pull off...

628
00:40:27,847 --> 00:40:30,747
That's what's got me worried, 
President Choi, sir.

629
00:40:30,747 --> 00:40:36,447
To put it a different way... 
If you have high status professional outfits...

630
00:40:36,447 --> 00:40:39,414
mixed in with assorted amateur riff-raff...

631
00:40:39,414 --> 00:40:43,680
aren't you in danger of the competition wasting...

632
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,180
a huge amount of your company's time?

633
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:50,547
To participate in a project on the scale of the Dam Arts Center,

634
00:40:50,547 --> 00:40:55,047
certain prior qualifications are necessary.

635
00:40:55,047 --> 00:40:58,547
But that's just my opinion, Mr President, sir.

636
00:40:58,547 --> 00:41:01,010
It's certainly an issue I need to think about.

637
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,980
Ah, right, President.

638
00:41:08,147 --> 00:41:11,619
Why are you here?

639
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,213
Miss Park Kae In.

640
00:41:15,213 --> 00:41:16,547
I see you're exactly on time.

641
00:41:16,547 --> 00:41:17,514
Hello.

642
00:41:17,514 --> 00:41:21,514
You two are well acquainted, 
so we'll just skip introductions.

643
00:41:21,514 --> 00:41:26,547
Miss Park will be working on my new children's gallery.

644
00:41:30,047 --> 00:41:30,680
Let's go.

645
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,914
Yes.

646
00:41:41,747 --> 00:41:48,480
I'd like to create a space for children to play to their heart's desire while their parents roam the building.

647
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,514
Yes.

648
00:41:50,514 --> 00:41:54,580
How much furniture are you planning on needing?

649
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:58,414
I think it would be a good idea for me to speak 
to the designer in charge of the remodeling.

650
00:41:58,414 --> 00:42:00,414
Ah, no.

651
00:42:00,414 --> 00:42:02,180
The responsibility for this project

652
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,947
will lay exclusively in your hands.

653
00:42:03,947 --> 00:42:04,847
Huh?

654
00:42:04,847 --> 00:42:09,147
As Park Chul Han's daughter, 
I'm sure that from an early age

655
00:42:09,147 --> 00:42:11,714
you were able to watch your father and learn a lot.

656
00:42:11,714 --> 00:42:16,647
No, actually, no... Such a big project...

657
00:42:16,647 --> 00:42:20,780
If you're going to entrust me with this project 
because of my father, I can't do it.

658
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:23,414
I'll just be ruining my father's good name.

659
00:42:23,414 --> 00:42:26,880
No, please don't misunderstand.

660
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,680
When I see talent even on a very small scale,

661
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,214
it's my custom to try to give it 
scope to spread its imaginative wings.

662
00:42:33,214 --> 00:42:36,247
The moment I saw the little chair that you made,

663
00:42:36,247 --> 00:42:38,314
"Perhaps...

664
00:42:38,314 --> 00:42:41,980
perhaps, together with her, I'll be able to create 
a space that people can dream in."

665
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,647
That's what I thought.

666
00:42:43,647 --> 00:42:45,614
Wait...

667
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:50,914
Even if I know a little about making furniture...

668
00:42:50,914 --> 00:42:54,714
building and designing an entire recreational space...

669
00:42:54,714 --> 00:42:57,180
Honestly, I don't have the confidence.

670
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,147
Don't you want to test yourself,

671
00:43:01,147 --> 00:43:03,480
and find out how far you can go?

672
00:43:10,347 --> 00:43:12,714
I'm not sure I can pull it off,

673
00:43:12,714 --> 00:43:15,747
but I'll try my best.

674
00:43:15,747 --> 00:43:17,780
But will you be alright with it?

675
00:43:18,747 --> 00:43:24,347
You'll have to come by here more often in the future, 
which means meeting In Hee as well.

676
00:43:24,347 --> 00:43:27,447
I saw you at Kim In Hee's wedding.

677
00:43:27,447 --> 00:43:30,347
So I know a little bit about what has happened between you two.

678
00:43:31,748 --> 00:43:33,250
It is quite awkward,

679
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:34,584
but I'll just have to put up with it.

680
00:43:35,852 --> 00:43:38,221
I don't want to have to lose

681
00:43:38,221 --> 00:43:40,456
this chance to challenge myself as well.

682
00:43:40,456 --> 00:43:41,891
Thank you very much,

683
00:43:41,891 --> 00:43:43,192
for giving me that chance.

684
00:43:44,127 --> 00:43:47,062
I wonder if it's because you're friends...

685
00:43:47,062 --> 00:43:50,166
Even while you seem to be the exact opposite of Jin Ho,

686
00:43:50,166 --> 00:43:51,667
for some reason,

687
00:43:51,667 --> 00:43:53,836
you seem an awful lot alike as well.

688
00:44:01,311 --> 00:44:02,412
The documents for the meeting.

689
00:44:02,412 --> 00:44:04,114
Ah, yes.

690
00:44:06,216 --> 00:44:07,284
Hey, Tae Hoon.

691
00:44:07,284 --> 00:44:08,052
Yes?

692
00:44:08,052 --> 00:44:10,520
Go find that paper Professor Park wrote in 1989.

693
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,254
Alright.

694
00:44:11,254 --> 00:44:12,722
What's happened?

695
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:14,891
What's wrong?

696
00:44:14,891 --> 00:44:16,059
This is unbelievable!

697
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,561
What are you talking about?

698
00:44:18,561 --> 00:44:21,764
The upcoming Dam Arts Center project, 
they just changed the entry qualifications.

699
00:44:21,764 --> 00:44:23,900
This mail just came in from MS Group.

700
00:44:27,304 --> 00:44:29,806
"Registered architect for more than ten years.

701
00:44:29,806 --> 00:44:33,009
More than three entries in design exhibitions abroad.

702
00:44:33,009 --> 00:44:36,044
Must have designed more than ten 50 billion won buildings."

703
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,714
No,

704
00:44:37,714 --> 00:44:40,416
I mean, with these kind of conditions, how many 
contestants do you think will actually be able to take part?

705
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:42,152
It just means that little offices like ours

706
00:44:42,152 --> 00:44:44,253
shouldn't even bother handing them a business card.

707
00:44:47,224 --> 00:44:49,058
What do we do, Jin Ho?

708
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,428
You didn't even consult me.

709
00:44:51,428 --> 00:44:53,396
How could you do something like this?

710
00:44:54,297 --> 00:44:57,566
Supposing I had consulted you, would you have agreed?

711
00:44:57,566 --> 00:44:59,135
Father!

712
00:45:00,837 --> 00:45:03,173
You're too naive when it comes to this field of work.

713
00:45:04,174 --> 00:45:06,042
If I had to sum you up in one word, it'd be "idealist."

714
00:45:06,042 --> 00:45:09,045
How can there be a fair competition 
if you rule out some entries in advance?

715
00:45:09,045 --> 00:45:11,981
Letting small fry butt into the competition

716
00:45:11,981 --> 00:45:14,918
would lower the design standards for the Dam Arts center,
 and I can't have that happen.

717
00:45:14,918 --> 00:45:16,519
But the Dam Arts Center project

718
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:18,388
was one where you said you'd give me complete control.

719
00:45:18,388 --> 00:45:21,824
Because you have no real interest in business,

720
00:45:21,824 --> 00:45:23,760
I let you try your hand at something you enjoyed.

721
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,395
Exactly, it's something I enjoy doing,

722
00:45:25,395 --> 00:45:27,163
and I can do it comfortably. 
So you should have some faith in me,

723
00:45:27,163 --> 00:45:28,064
and ensure that I can do it.

724
00:45:28,064 --> 00:45:30,199
The Dam Arts Center project

725
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:32,835
is my life's work and passion.

726
00:45:33,637 --> 00:45:35,939
Isn't it a matter where I should have a say as well?

727
00:45:35,939 --> 00:45:37,440
Please stay out of it.

728
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,342
The Dam Arts Center is a new world.

729
00:45:39,342 --> 00:45:41,209
If big companies dominate the competition,

730
00:45:41,209 --> 00:45:42,879
there's no chance of that new world being born.

731
00:45:42,879 --> 00:45:44,948
But that's why only firms that have grown large

732
00:45:44,948 --> 00:45:47,117
have proved themselves qualified to undertake it.

733
00:45:47,117 --> 00:45:48,651
If you're going to continue to be like this,

734
00:45:49,286 --> 00:45:51,620
I will have no other choice but to leave again.

735
00:45:53,657 --> 00:45:55,858
You don't really believe in me, do you father?

736
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,962
Even after I told you I have more than 
enough confidence that I can win this,

737
00:45:59,962 --> 00:46:01,832
you still resort to shackling Jin Ho, 
proving that you don't believe in my abilities.

738
00:46:01,832 --> 00:46:02,831
Right?

739
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,968
Chang Ryul,

740
00:46:05,968 --> 00:46:08,537
a long time ago,

741
00:46:08,537 --> 00:46:11,508
do you know why people destroyed three generations of the descendants of someone who committed a treason?

742
00:46:12,542 --> 00:46:15,745
It's to pull out any potential weed at its roots.

743
00:46:15,745 --> 00:46:18,315
Father, you know this isn't fighting with bare fists!

744
00:46:18,315 --> 00:46:19,783
There's a rock in that fist again--

745
00:46:19,783 --> 00:46:22,018
It's a fight, stop bothering about rules!

746
00:46:22,018 --> 00:46:24,053
When you fight, winning is the important thing!

747
00:46:24,053 --> 00:46:26,020
With what you fight, how you fight,

748
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,323
it doesn't matter as long as you win!

749
00:46:27,323 --> 00:46:29,825
The rules come in later, you crazy fool!

750
00:46:29,825 --> 00:46:31,027
You fool.

751
00:46:32,062 --> 00:46:33,696
I'm your father, you punk.

752
00:46:33,696 --> 00:46:36,399
If I fix a deal for you, you should be like 
"Thank you very much!".

753
00:46:36,399 --> 00:46:38,669
And "I'll work hard".

754
00:46:38,669 --> 00:46:39,837
Got that?

755
00:46:41,972 --> 00:46:43,039
Come in.

756
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:44,941
Kim In Hee has arrived.

757
00:46:44,941 --> 00:46:46,109
Send her in.

758
00:46:53,583 --> 00:46:56,319
I actually had to send a car round to fetch you,

759
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,721
since you hardly ever showed your face.

760
00:47:01,091 --> 00:47:02,892
Have a seat.

761
00:47:12,467 --> 00:47:17,140
The wedding did not end in harmony

762
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:20,510
and you and I are on rather strained terms,

763
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:22,813
but can't we work something out?

764
00:47:22,813 --> 00:47:26,449
Once I've accepted someone into my family,

765
00:47:26,449 --> 00:47:29,219
then no matter what happens, I stick with them.

766
00:47:29,219 --> 00:47:34,590
There's a lot of gossip circulating 
on account of the wedding,

767
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:38,228
and I want to clamp down on that,

768
00:47:38,228 --> 00:47:41,764
so we need to have a little talk about the matter.

769
00:47:41,764 --> 00:47:43,599
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

770
00:47:44,468 --> 00:47:46,202
Chang Ryul and I...

771
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:49,137
have already ended everything.

772
00:47:54,744 --> 00:47:56,212
Let's go outside.

773
00:47:56,212 --> 00:47:57,380
We don't have anything to talk about outside.

774
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:58,848
All the same, let's go outside.

775
00:47:58,848 --> 00:48:00,883
Can you not sit?

776
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:11,161
You broke up?

777
00:48:11,161 --> 00:48:15,665
I'm over and done with your indecisive son. 
There's no way I could live with him.

778
00:48:15,665 --> 00:48:18,368
Garbage like that...

779
00:48:18,368 --> 00:48:20,470
how dare you come out with it in my presence?

780
00:48:21,337 --> 00:48:24,273
You have no right to any say, 
but you are trying to tell me what to do?

781
00:48:24,273 --> 00:48:27,877
it's my fault for accepting someone 
like that as my daughter-in-law.

782
00:48:27,877 --> 00:48:30,780
Everyone in the family objected to you,

783
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,815
but this guy here...

784
00:48:32,815 --> 00:48:36,419
said it had to be you. That's the only reason I gave my consent.

785
00:48:36,419 --> 00:48:38,588
It's not like you don't know this.

786
00:48:38,588 --> 00:48:39,456
I'm aware of that.

787
00:48:39,456 --> 00:48:40,424
"I'm aware of that."

788
00:48:40,424 --> 00:48:43,460
So how can you talk of breaking up 
so easily in front of your elder?!

789
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:47,463
I am thankful that such a talented man 
such as Chang Ryul loved me,

790
00:48:47,463 --> 00:48:49,165
but I was unfortunately

791
00:48:49,165 --> 00:48:50,901
mistaken in thinking that I loved him.

792
00:48:51,834 --> 00:48:53,136
However,

793
00:48:53,136 --> 00:48:54,705
despite his good points, I came to realize...

794
00:48:54,705 --> 00:48:57,307
that they're outweighed by defects I simply can't tolerate.

795
00:48:58,608 --> 00:49:00,343
At the wedding,

796
00:49:00,343 --> 00:49:02,278
my idea of the person I want

797
00:49:02,278 --> 00:49:04,680
suddenly became very clear to me.

798
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,149
I...

799
00:49:06,149 --> 00:49:07,851
would like someone whom I can trust, depend on,

800
00:49:07,851 --> 00:49:09,986
and respect.

801
00:49:11,288 --> 00:49:13,523
That's why I can't be with him.

802
00:49:17,394 --> 00:49:19,229
Kim In Hee!

803
00:49:25,369 --> 00:49:27,003
Great performance, Kim In Hee.

804
00:49:28,071 --> 00:49:31,841
For you to reject being the wife of a future owner of Mirae Construction,

805
00:49:31,841 --> 00:49:33,676
am I such a pathetic fellow?

806
00:49:33,676 --> 00:49:35,745
Do I really have to explain it all to you again?

807
00:49:35,745 --> 00:49:38,080
I do believe I just stated everything 
clearly in front of the President.

808
00:49:41,251 --> 00:49:42,952
What's with you?!

809
00:49:42,952 --> 00:49:43,853
You're not letting go?

810
00:49:48,223 --> 00:49:50,660
So why did you treat me like that then?

811
00:49:52,829 --> 00:49:55,631
That time I got drunk and gone to Kae In's house,

812
00:49:55,631 --> 00:49:58,968
insisting that that day I was going to sleep with her...

813
00:50:00,003 --> 00:50:02,872
Kae In eventually kicked me out,

814
00:50:02,872 --> 00:50:05,709
and when I bumped into you in front of the house you said,

815
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:08,511
"Chang Ryul,

816
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,480
I see you didn't meet with success today either.

817
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,349
Let's go, I'll buy you a drink."

818
00:50:15,318 --> 00:50:16,820
I was so drunk,

819
00:50:17,954 --> 00:50:23,359
I was telling you why I didn't understand how Kae In could not accept me as a man,

820
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,228
I got everything off my chest to you.

821
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:28,531
But then you said,

822
00:50:30,067 --> 00:50:32,001
"But I do see you that way."

823
00:50:32,669 --> 00:50:34,270
That's what you said.

824
00:50:37,307 --> 00:50:39,209
I started wavering from that day on.

825
00:50:40,377 --> 00:50:43,212
I slowly stopped seeing Kae In and started seeing you.

826
00:50:44,281 --> 00:50:47,383
And suddenly, I was only able to see you.

827
00:50:48,852 --> 00:50:51,954
So, even though I knew it would make me a bastard,

828
00:50:51,954 --> 00:50:54,624
I even decided to marry you.

829
00:50:58,862 --> 00:51:01,163
Why did you treat me like that that day?

830
00:51:01,163 --> 00:51:03,166
Because of my rich family?

831
00:51:03,166 --> 00:51:06,169
Did you want to try and seduce a rich guy like me? Is that why?

832
00:51:07,037 --> 00:51:08,271
I can't say those weren't factors as well.

833
00:51:08,271 --> 00:51:10,340
Then you wouldn't have had to go this far, In Hee.

834
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,008
There's been no change in the size of my fortune.

835
00:51:12,008 --> 00:51:14,076
In the beginning,

836
00:51:14,076 --> 00:51:16,012
it didn't start because you were a good catch.

837
00:51:17,714 --> 00:51:20,350
You were the man that Kae In loved so much.

838
00:51:20,984 --> 00:51:23,753
I wondered what could be so great about that man.

839
00:51:24,488 --> 00:51:26,389
I got curious.

840
00:51:28,492 --> 00:51:29,959
Every time I came home...

841
00:51:29,959 --> 00:51:32,828
"My Chang Ryul, my Chang Ryul..."

842
00:51:32,828 --> 00:51:37,200
I was fascinated by Kae In, who couldn't speak 
of anything else before she went to bed.

843
00:51:38,335 --> 00:51:40,269
Listening to Kae In's stories,

844
00:51:40,269 --> 00:51:41,705
Chang Ryul

845
00:51:41,705 --> 00:51:43,440
seemed to be the one and only most perfect man in the world.

846
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,008
seemed to be the one and only most perfect man in the world.

847
00:51:46,076 --> 00:51:48,411
Kind and pure,

848
00:51:48,411 --> 00:51:50,079
very manly...

849
00:51:51,381 --> 00:51:53,283
So then all of a sudden,

850
00:51:53,283 --> 00:51:55,652
I started to wonder...

851
00:51:55,652 --> 00:51:57,386
am I not in love with him too?

852
00:51:58,588 --> 00:52:00,056
What then...

853
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:04,760
You loved the man that Kae In loved,

854
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,396
but I didn't turn out to be that man?

855
00:52:07,396 --> 00:52:08,431
Is that it?

856
00:52:08,431 --> 00:52:09,698
Right.

857
00:52:09,698 --> 00:52:11,667
That is it.

858
00:52:11,667 --> 00:52:13,470
The man I loved

859
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:15,872
was the man living in Kae In's imagination.

860
00:52:15,872 --> 00:52:18,307
Not the real Chang Ryul.

861
00:52:20,444 --> 00:52:22,778
Life is about realities.

862
00:52:22,778 --> 00:52:24,548
Living with an illusion...

863
00:52:24,548 --> 00:52:26,248
isn't that just an empty thing?

864
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:35,024


865
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:39,862
Let's just look for a project that's our level.

866
00:52:41,765 --> 00:52:44,100
I found out why this all happened.

867
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,202
I just came back from my father's office.

868
00:52:46,202 --> 00:52:50,374
He had a drink with Director Choi's father last night, 
and he told him the head of Mirae Construction had persuaded him to set stricter entry conditions.

869
00:52:50,374 --> 00:52:51,574
Hey, hey.

870
00:52:51,574 --> 00:52:53,676
He must be really afraid of us.

871
00:52:53,676 --> 00:52:57,880
President Han and Chang Ryul must have 
done this to out us from the competition.

872
00:53:08,825 --> 00:53:12,195
It doesn't seem like he'll be coming back in today.

873
00:53:14,331 --> 00:53:16,833
You came because of the entry qualifications 
for the Dam Arts Center project, right?

874
00:53:17,768 --> 00:53:21,470
I just found out about it a little while ago 
when I was on the homepage.

875
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:23,039
I believe that, while I was away on other matters,

876
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:25,842
Director Choi went up to his father's office about the matter.

877
00:53:27,277 --> 00:53:29,179
You must be very disappointed.

878
00:53:30,013 --> 00:53:31,381
Although my boss

879
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:33,817
will have tried to query his father's decision,

880
00:53:33,817 --> 00:53:35,318
it won't have any effect.

881
00:53:35,886 --> 00:53:37,821
Once the President decides on something,

882
00:53:37,821 --> 00:53:40,690
he's not to be persuaded of the contrary.

883
00:53:45,896 --> 00:53:48,431
Shall I... buy you a drink?

884
00:53:50,233 --> 00:53:52,368
I will have to decline today.

885
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:55,304
I have to leave the office now,

886
00:53:55,304 --> 00:53:57,740
would you take me home in your car?

887
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:59,042
I'm sorry,

888
00:53:59,042 --> 00:54:01,143
I don't think I can do that either today.

889
00:54:15,859 --> 00:54:19,295
 The head of the Mirae Construction 
persuaded him to set stricter entry conditions. 

890
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:21,231
 Hey, hey... 

891
00:54:21,231 --> 00:54:23,099
 They really must be afraid of us. 

892
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:26,836
 Chang Ryul and President Han must have 
done this to oust us from the competition. 

893
00:54:39,749 --> 00:54:40,717
 Dad, 

894
00:54:40,717 --> 00:54:42,085
 Is this our new home? 

895
00:54:42,085 --> 00:54:43,553
 That's right. 

896
00:55:09,112 --> 00:55:10,546
Why isn't he coming?

897
00:55:11,647 --> 00:55:13,149
Did he go home?

898
00:55:54,891 --> 00:55:55,892
In Hee.

899
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,068
I'm going to move out.

900
00:56:08,071 --> 00:56:11,908
You can have this apartment.

901
00:56:13,543 --> 00:56:18,615
And I'm sincerely sorry for disappointing you.

902
00:56:42,472 --> 00:56:45,575
Don't confuse fantasy with reality anymore.

903
00:56:49,245 --> 00:56:50,713
I won't.

904
00:56:53,817 --> 00:56:55,184
Be well.

905
00:57:01,191 --> 00:57:02,426
Sorry.

906
00:57:11,134 --> 00:57:14,503
For getting in between

907
00:57:14,503 --> 00:57:16,172
Kae In and you.

908
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,348
From now on...

909
00:57:26,349 --> 00:57:29,018
love someone because you want to love them.

910
00:57:30,153 --> 00:57:32,589
Don't love them just because...

911
00:57:32,589 --> 00:57:34,591
someone else loves them.

912
00:57:38,162 --> 00:57:39,892
Right.

913
00:57:42,867 --> 00:57:43,767
Even so,

914
00:57:45,903 --> 00:57:47,838
I really loved you.

915
00:57:49,239 --> 00:57:51,608
See, I thought you only saw me...

916
00:57:53,043 --> 00:57:56,780
I thought you were dedicating all of your life to me,

917
00:57:57,581 --> 00:57:59,149
and so I thought, "All right,

918
00:57:59,149 --> 00:58:01,718
I'll match this woman's devotion with my protection."

919
00:58:04,154 --> 00:58:05,388
That's what I thought.

920
00:58:06,823 --> 00:58:08,792
That, at least, is true.

921
00:58:15,465 --> 00:58:16,500
I'll be leaving.

922
00:58:59,122 --> 00:59:03,480
If you were going home, 
you could at least have said so.

923
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,149
Why isn't he answering his cellphone?

924
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:34,478
It looks like he's not coming...

925
00:59:46,323 --> 00:59:46,996
Jin Ho!

926
00:59:47,606 --> 00:59:50,761
Why are you so late? 
Why didn't you answer my...

927
00:59:50,761 --> 00:59:52,696
Oh!

928
00:59:52,696 --> 00:59:56,467
My friend Park Kae In!

929
00:59:56,467 --> 01:00:01,080
An enemy-like friend, Park Kae In.

930
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,139
Oh, you stink of booze!

931
01:00:02,139 --> 01:00:05,342
Jin Ho, how much did you drink?

932
01:00:07,642 --> 01:00:11,515
Without one worry at all,

933
01:00:11,515 --> 01:00:13,492
my friend, Park Kae In.

934
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:19,497
The world's most innocent person,

935
01:00:19,497 --> 01:00:22,059
Park Kae In, my friend.

936
01:00:22,059 --> 01:00:23,594
This guy's totally wasted.

937
01:00:23,594 --> 01:00:24,828
Jin Ho,

938
01:00:24,828 --> 01:00:26,230
come to your senses.

939
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:28,561
Let's quickly go in.

940
01:00:28,561 --> 01:00:29,767
Oh, why is he like this...

941
01:00:35,172 --> 01:00:36,340
Jin Ho,

942
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:37,975
are you really ok?

943
01:00:37,975 --> 01:00:38,644
It's honey water.

944
01:00:38,644 --> 01:00:40,529
You should drink this.

945
01:00:43,214 --> 01:00:46,250
You're not the kind who would drink so much...

946
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:48,385
What's the matter, Jin Ho?

947
01:00:48,385 --> 01:00:50,090
There are those days,

948
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:53,991
days when you just want to drink that much.

949
01:00:53,991 --> 01:00:55,092
But,

950
01:00:55,092 --> 01:00:58,195
what do you mean?

951
01:00:58,195 --> 01:00:59,396
By any chance,

952
01:00:59,396 --> 01:01:02,232
did you have a fight with Sang Jun?

953
01:01:06,337 --> 01:01:08,271
I raced to the death,

954
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:13,944
hearing people calling me crazy.

955
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:18,982
I raced to the death,

956
01:01:23,921 --> 01:01:27,471
but I am still that little kid.

957
01:01:28,859 --> 01:01:32,300
A kid who couldn't...

958
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:34,498
do anything when his father died.

959
01:01:37,534 --> 01:01:39,936
Even though it's so unfair it's driving me crazy,

960
01:01:42,773 --> 01:01:44,941
so unfair it's driving me crazy,

961
01:01:48,012 --> 01:01:51,081
there was nothing that I could do.

962
01:01:53,217 --> 01:01:55,519
So all I could do was punch the wall...

963
01:01:58,889 --> 01:02:01,325
Just a child.

964
01:02:03,694 --> 01:02:05,228
Jin Ho...

965
01:02:07,398 --> 01:02:08,999
No matter how hard I run,

966
01:02:12,002 --> 01:02:15,172
I always stay in this same place.

967
