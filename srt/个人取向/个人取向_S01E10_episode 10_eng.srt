1
00:00:01,811 --> 00:00:03,420
You jerk!

2
00:00:04,411 --> 00:00:06,490
Oh, Oh, Chang Ryul!

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,300
Are you okay?

4
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:14,570
Your nose is bleeding.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,600
Ok...

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,500
Let's finish this today. Okay?

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,798
Chang Ryul, stop it. That's enough.

8
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:32,938
Are you so jealous, that you can't even think straight?

9
00:00:32,938 --> 00:00:35,741
What's the problem with Jin Ho living here?

10
00:00:35,741 --> 00:00:36,651
What?

11
00:00:36,651 --> 00:00:38,744
Don't you know the answer to that one? This jerk...

12
00:00:38,744 --> 00:00:41,348
Think about what we did to Kae In.

13
00:00:42,048 --> 00:00:44,183
The person who has comforted her is Jin Ho.

14
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,552
So shouldn't both of us be thankful?

15
00:00:46,552 --> 00:00:47,420
Kim In Hee,

16
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,322
what's this nonsense you're talking?

17
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:51,524
This guy living in the same house as my Kae In, 
there's no knowing what sort of harm he might...

18
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:53,192
Just what harm do you claim he's doing her?

19
00:00:53,192 --> 00:00:55,928
We both know all about the sort of person Jin Ho is, don't we?

20
00:00:56,395 --> 00:00:57,930
Are you thinking straight?

21
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,197
I told you before! That guy isn't g-

22
00:00:59,197 --> 00:01:01,800
Don't you realize how much talk like that hurts Jin Ho?

23
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:10,175
Kae In,

24
00:01:10,175 --> 00:01:11,510
you and Jin Ho go inside.

25
00:01:12,612 --> 00:01:15,847
There is no point in having this 
confrontation if nothing is resolved.

26
00:01:22,054 --> 00:01:27,960
Yeah, we're all a bit upset... 
We can  talk some more after we've calmed down.

27
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,220
Kae In...

28
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,964
Hey, you! Where do you think you're going?

29
00:01:31,964 --> 00:01:32,664
I'm not going to leave you alone!

30
00:01:32,664 --> 00:01:33,298
Stop that.

31
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:35,134
Are you stupid?

32
00:01:35,134 --> 00:01:36,035
What?

33
00:01:37,704 --> 00:01:39,276
Jin Ho, Jin Ho.

34
00:01:39,276 --> 00:01:40,339
Jin Ho.

35
00:01:40,339 --> 00:01:41,674
Is your face okay?

36
00:01:42,341 --> 00:01:44,443
Don't worry about me, worry about your boyfriend.

37
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:47,146
My boyfriend?

38
00:01:47,146 --> 00:01:50,149
Because he got that nosebleed you just 
ran up to him like he was your boyfriend.

39
00:01:52,451 --> 00:01:56,188
I'm supposed to be like that. You taught me!

40
00:01:56,188 --> 00:01:57,924
Keeping a guy on tenterhooks

41
00:01:57,924 --> 00:01:59,625
is what I have to do to become a real woman.

42
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,694
Is that your idea of keeping him on tenterhooks?

43
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:07,233
Chang Ryul's so feeble that you floored him with a single punch.

44
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:10,936
So in a situation like that, I have to 
pretend to be worried about him

45
00:02:10,936 --> 00:02:16,310
So then he'll be grateful to me, and eventually 
tell me he can't cope without me... That sort of thing...

46
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:18,577
So you're saying it was acting?

47
00:02:18,577 --> 00:02:19,879
Of course!

48
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:26,753
Park Kae In, I know that you weren't faking.

49
00:02:26,753 --> 00:02:28,353
You don't have the talent to act like that.

50
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:36,395
Wait and see, I'm going to become a 
famous actor and win an Academy Award.

51
00:02:37,363 --> 00:02:43,135
But hey, your face must be hurting. 
Hang on,  I'll get an ice pack.

52
00:02:47,807 --> 00:02:49,275
Ow! That hurts.

53
00:02:49,742 --> 00:02:52,111
Really?

54
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:53,445
Will you be able to do that?

55
00:02:54,447 --> 00:02:55,714
What?

56
00:02:55,714 --> 00:02:58,350
If I say it's Game Over...

57
00:02:58,852 --> 00:03:01,487
will you really be able to get rid of that Chang Ryul guy?

58
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,191
Yes.

59
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:08,060
I can do it.

60
00:03:15,501 --> 00:03:18,904
What about you? Can you promise me something?

61
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:26,278
Will you promise me you'll always be my very 
best friend in all the world, come what may?

62
00:03:27,346 --> 00:03:28,881
I told you I would.

63
00:03:30,883 --> 00:03:34,954
When I see you with In Hee,

64
00:03:34,954 --> 00:03:37,089
I'm afraid I might be an obstacle in your path.

65
00:03:38,324 --> 00:03:39,725
But if I'm not, then that's fine.

66
00:03:41,928 --> 00:03:43,495
That won't ever happen.

67
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:50,436
A person's heart can change.

68
00:03:52,004 --> 00:03:54,006
In Hee...

69
00:03:54,006 --> 00:03:56,675
is a person who gets everything that she wants.

70
00:03:58,678 --> 00:04:02,381
If she wants to make you into a friend,

71
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:04,884
she'll succeed sooner or later.

72
00:04:06,585 --> 00:04:08,888
I'll take care of my own feelings.

73
00:04:09,655 --> 00:04:12,224
You just take care of your own.

74
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:34,647
Episode 10 
  Game over 

75
00:04:42,822 --> 00:04:44,990
What did you want to talk about?

76
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:51,329
Supposing you tell Kae In the truth about Jin Ho 
not being gay, what good will that do either of us?

77
00:04:52,398 --> 00:04:53,666
What kind of talk is that?

78
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:57,803
Kae In and Jin Ho are friends 
 because Kae In thinks he is gay.

79
00:04:57,803 --> 00:05:02,975
If she finds out that he's not, 
 what do you think she will think of him?

80
00:05:03,576 --> 00:05:06,745
You're a man who once betrayed Kae In,

81
00:05:06,745 --> 00:05:10,649
but Jin Ho is just a good friend.

82
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:13,519
Kae In believes that Jin Ho is gay. 
That's why she's on such good terms with him.

83
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,954
If the truth is exposed, how do you think she will treat him?

84
00:05:14,954 --> 00:05:17,056
Am I supposed to let that jerk push me aside?

85
00:05:17,056 --> 00:05:18,624
But doesn't the way you got so mad show that you're jealous?

86
00:05:18,624 --> 00:05:20,059
But doesn't the way you got so mad show that you're jealous?

87
00:05:22,628 --> 00:05:24,897
We're both after the same thing.

88
00:05:24,897 --> 00:05:26,498
Why don't you just be honest?

89
00:05:26,966 --> 00:05:28,968
After the same thing?

90
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:30,936
I've started to be in love with Jin Ho.

91
00:05:31,737 --> 00:05:35,674
I want Jin Ho, and you want Kae In.

92
00:05:35,674 --> 00:05:40,711
That's why we should support their friendship. 
Don't you think so?

93
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,427
 Are you okay? 

94
00:06:09,242 --> 00:06:12,511
You're saying that was acting?

95
00:06:17,683 --> 00:06:18,584
Jin Ho.

96
00:06:18,584 --> 00:06:20,719
I made this. Keep this on your face.

97
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,656
I don't need it.

98
00:06:22,656 --> 00:06:25,925
It's going to be swollen tomorrow morning!

99
00:06:26,592 --> 00:06:28,861
That jerk Chang Ryul doesn't pack much of a punch.

100
00:06:46,012 --> 00:06:47,346
You...

101
00:06:47,346 --> 00:06:49,314
Why are you here again?

102
00:06:49,314 --> 00:06:53,385
I thought you two would be feeling 
kind of down so I brought some beer.

103
00:06:53,385 --> 00:06:55,788
Drink this, and solve your problems then go to sleep.

104
00:06:57,123 --> 00:06:59,325
I'd like to have some too,

105
00:06:59,325 --> 00:07:03,128
but I know you wouldn't approve of that so I'll just go.

106
00:07:03,128 --> 00:07:04,797
but I know you wouldn't approve of that so I'll just go.

107
00:07:05,698 --> 00:07:06,832
Kae In,

108
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:11,737
it's such a relief to know you're here to keep my Jin Ho company.

109
00:07:12,805 --> 00:07:16,542
Jin Ho, let's meet up somewhere else 
sometime and talk things over.

110
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:18,877
Sleep well.

111
00:07:19,545 --> 00:07:20,579
Bye.

112
00:07:39,498 --> 00:07:40,466
What?

113
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,768
"My" Jin Ho?

114
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,747
What is it, Chang Ryul?

115
00:07:55,214 --> 00:07:57,783
I'm outside your house... Let's talk for a bit.

116
00:07:57,783 --> 00:08:00,653
I told you I didn't want to meet today, so just go home.

117
00:08:00,653 --> 00:08:02,354
I'll wait until you come out.

118
00:08:36,155 --> 00:08:37,289
Talk.

119
00:08:39,558 --> 00:08:42,494
No matter how much that Jin Ho guy...

120
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:47,866
no matter how gay he is... 
him living in the same house as you, I really hate it.

121
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:52,171
Don't interfere in my private life.

122
00:08:52,171 --> 00:08:55,140
I've never once given you any right to do that.

123
00:08:56,042 --> 00:08:58,344
I hate it so much, but...

124
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:01,247
I'll try to understand.

125
00:09:04,517 --> 00:09:08,087
If you want to be with that guy as friends,

126
00:09:08,821 --> 00:09:10,022
then you do that.

127
00:09:11,257 --> 00:09:17,796
Because from now on, I want to do things 
the way you want to. Rather than the way I want to.

128
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:21,934
But Kae In,

129
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,339
if you've any sense at all that I do genuinely care for you,

130
00:09:27,773 --> 00:09:29,443
then...

131
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:33,613
please send Jeon Jin Ho away from this house.

132
00:09:33,613 --> 00:09:34,914
I beg you to do that.

133
00:09:39,785 --> 00:09:42,055
I'll think about it.

134
00:09:42,055 --> 00:09:43,689
Okay...

135
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:45,324
Thank you for at least

136
00:09:45,725 --> 00:09:47,059
telling me that.

137
00:09:48,494 --> 00:09:49,528
Go in.

138
00:09:52,598 --> 00:09:53,966
Go first.

139
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,516
No, it's okay.

140
00:09:55,516 --> 00:09:57,369
I want to see you go inside first.

141
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:21,327
Drink this and sleep.

142
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:24,296
Why would I drink this?

143
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:29,702
Our dear In Hee bought it with her Jin Ho 
in mind so who else is going to drink it?

144
00:10:29,702 --> 00:10:32,838
I don't want it, so you decide if you 
want to throw it away or whatever.

145
00:10:34,607 --> 00:10:37,275
There's no need for you to do that because of me.

146
00:10:37,275 --> 00:10:40,279
If you want to be friends with In Hee, go ahead.

147
00:10:42,348 --> 00:10:43,616
Do you really mean that?

148
00:10:46,452 --> 00:10:48,522
I may be your very best friend...

149
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,180
but I can't go interfering in your private life, can I now?

150
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,459
So you are saying that

151
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:56,048
I can't intrude into your own private affairs either?

152
00:10:56,048 --> 00:10:57,498
When did I ever say that?

153
00:10:57,498 --> 00:11:00,418
Didn't you just meet up with Chang Ryul?

154
00:11:03,036 --> 00:11:06,366
You told me that once I said the words 
"Game Over", you would know what to do.

155
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,826
But now, you go ahead and meet him behind my back.

156
00:11:08,826 --> 00:11:10,724
No, it's not like that...

157
00:11:10,724 --> 00:11:12,600
I think I can handle this by myself...

158
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,413
I'm afraid of troubling you further.

159
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:18,256
I'll leave you to your own devices in the future then.

160
00:11:36,887 --> 00:11:39,024
Thinking back to the time

161
00:11:39,024 --> 00:11:42,876
when I saw In Hee standing beside Chang Ryul at the wedding...

162
00:11:43,478 --> 00:11:45,489
hearing In Hee...

163
00:11:45,489 --> 00:11:50,809
say "my" Jin Ho just now...

164
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:53,534
that hurt me a whole lot more.

165
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:15,163
I don't even know myself why I'm doing this.

166
00:12:15,163 --> 00:12:17,609
If I've been narrow-minded,

167
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:19,696
I am sorry.

168
00:12:33,225 --> 00:12:37,284
Should I... just call it all off?

169
00:12:37,284 --> 00:12:40,372
If it's true that I'm not cut out for revenge,

170
00:12:40,372 --> 00:12:43,001
there's nothing for us to fight over, is there?

171
00:12:56,051 --> 00:12:57,716
Hey, Jin Ho.

172
00:12:57,716 --> 00:13:01,218
Saturday's here at last, 
so why don't we do something relaxing?

173
00:13:01,218 --> 00:13:02,788
Dinner tonight?

174
00:13:02,788 --> 00:13:03,608
Some other time.

175
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:05,254
Do you have other plans?

176
00:13:05,254 --> 00:13:06,091
I'm tired...

177
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:08,026
I'm just gonna go home.

178
00:13:10,743 --> 00:13:12,650
Jin Ho,

179
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:16,316
see... I really don't wish to add any more pressure on you...

180
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:20,600
but the deadline is getting really close.

181
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,349
We need to press ahead with drafting the designs 
for the Sang Go Jae concept.

182
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,780
I realize that. I'll take care of it.

183
00:13:35,537 --> 00:13:38,190
What's gotten into me that I'm even doing this?

184
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,570
♫ It's ridicuous that I didn't know either.   ♫

185
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,420
♫   I secretly am looking only at you.  ♫

186
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:47,966
Park Kae In.

187
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,641
Park Kae In.

188
00:13:52,443 --> 00:13:54,507
Isn't she home yet?

189
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:03,345
♫  Even if I dream of it, although it's ridiculous that you're the only one for me, I love you.  ♫

190
00:14:03,345 --> 00:14:04,940


191
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,410
♫  I like the comfortable feeling  ♫

192
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:15,190
♫  even if we bicker everyday, you know how I feel  ♫

193
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,370
♫  even if you don't behave yourself, I can tolerte anything  ♫

194
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:24,600
♫  I only have you  ♫

195
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,390
♫  My lonely heart must be crazy  ♫

196
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:33,560
♫  I only have eyes for you  ♫

197
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,780
♫  It's ridiculous that I didn't know either  ♫

198
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,720
♫  I secretly am only looking at you  ♫

199
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,610
♫  Even if I hate it, try hard  and hide it, I can't  ♫

200
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:47,220
♫  There's no way. I keep wanting you.  ♫

201
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,020
♫  I want to tell you to fall for me  ♫

202
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:57,400
♫  ♫  Even if I dream of it, although it's ridiculous that you're the only one for me, I love you.  ♫  ♫

203
00:15:08,347 --> 00:15:10,093
Oh, heck! My book!

204
00:15:10,093 --> 00:15:12,116
Yours, I think?

205
00:15:12,116 --> 00:15:13,452
Jin Ho.

206
00:15:13,452 --> 00:15:17,389
I knew you weren't the type to listen 
to the weather forecast and take an umbrella.

207
00:15:19,391 --> 00:15:22,971
I've always liked walking around in the rain.

208
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:26,623
That must be why I heard how someone 
called you a rain-drenched puppy dog.

209
00:15:26,623 --> 00:15:28,966
Do you want yet another quarrel right here in the street?

210
00:15:28,966 --> 00:15:32,137
How can anyone manage 
to be so unprepared and clumsy?

211
00:15:32,137 --> 00:15:34,873
Are you on your way home from work? 
Did you ride the bus?

212
00:15:34,873 --> 00:15:36,341
Why are you walking? 
Where's your car?

213
00:15:36,341 --> 00:15:37,876
It's parked at home.

214
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:41,179
So you came to find me?

215
00:15:42,302 --> 00:15:44,816
I don't know what started us quarreling,

216
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:46,817
but I know there's some bad feeling between us.

217
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:49,133
So to make amends, 
I decided to come pick you up.

218
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:53,391
You should have brought two umbrellas! 
Your shoulder is all drenched now.

219
00:15:53,391 --> 00:15:55,560
Then you'll have to lean right up close to me, won't you?

220
00:15:58,597 --> 00:16:03,902
I..
am really envious of mothers fetching their kids on rainy days.

221
00:16:03,902 --> 00:16:05,704
It's just like you were my mother!

222
00:16:05,704 --> 00:16:07,472
So if I'm together with you...

223
00:16:07,472 --> 00:16:09,841
I won't ever be a drenched little puppy.

224
00:16:09,841 --> 00:16:12,325
Didn't you tell me just now to stop referring to that?

225
00:16:12,325 --> 00:16:14,879
Why do you keep running yourself down like that?

226
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:16,836
I never took that to heart.

227
00:16:16,836 --> 00:16:18,316
Is there anything you ever do take to heart?

228
00:16:18,316 --> 00:16:20,052
Argh, why did you have to spoil the mood?

229
00:16:20,052 --> 00:16:22,883
It was going so well till then...

230
00:16:22,883 --> 00:16:24,842
You're going to get rained on, come here.

231
00:16:34,633 --> 00:16:38,370
Didn't you say he had to stay with her 
purely for work reasons?

232
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,306
I did. But that does look a bit odd.

233
00:16:41,306 --> 00:16:44,286
Well... It must be because they're sharing only one umbrella!

234
00:16:44,286 --> 00:16:47,379
That's why they seem a little too close for comfort.

235
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,783
How long are we planning on following them?

236
00:16:51,783 --> 00:16:54,352
A woman's intuition is very sensitive.

237
00:16:54,352 --> 00:16:57,573
This isn't as simple as it seems.

238
00:17:02,227 --> 00:17:04,562
It's an apple (apology) to say I'm sorry.

239
00:17:06,503 --> 00:17:11,471
Yesterday... I would like to apologize 
to you for being petty because of In Hee.

240
00:17:12,537 --> 00:17:14,739
You know you were petty?

241
00:17:14,739 --> 00:17:17,976
Actually, you were too.

242
00:17:20,344 --> 00:17:23,849
Whatever it is...
Let's call it even today.

243
00:17:24,883 --> 00:17:29,954
Doesn't my apple apology prove I have a big heart?

244
00:17:29,954 --> 00:17:33,259
Well, I even went grocery shopping for a friend who loves food.

245
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:37,496
Ah, Jin Ho, you're so generous.

246
00:17:37,496 --> 00:17:40,431
Your heart's bigger than the Pacific Ocean.

247
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:43,802
You'll cook tonight.

248
00:17:43,802 --> 00:17:45,371
Cooking is your duty.

249
00:17:45,371 --> 00:17:47,906
But you know I'm very bad at cooking.

250
00:17:50,242 --> 00:17:52,945
Oh My God! Omo, omo, really?

251
00:17:52,945 --> 00:17:54,978
- Yes. 
- Really? Really?

252
00:17:54,978 --> 00:17:56,758
A real model?

253
00:17:56,758 --> 00:18:00,018
I'm not dreaming am I, unni?

254
00:18:00,018 --> 00:18:01,253
Take off your glasses.

255
00:18:01,253 --> 00:18:03,021
My glasses?

256
00:18:04,922 --> 00:18:06,825
So did you feel that?

257
00:18:06,825 --> 00:18:09,561
It's not really a modeling assignment.

258
00:18:09,561 --> 00:18:12,464
I just need some photos for my online store.

259
00:18:12,464 --> 00:18:15,800
Unni, I've always wanted to be a model.

260
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,570
But where my face is concerned...

261
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:22,641
My face doesn't look that bad... 
But on my stomach, there's some cellulite and all...

262
00:18:22,641 --> 00:18:24,642
Oh, I can edit that out.

263
00:18:24,642 --> 00:18:26,644
That's really great.

264
00:18:26,645 --> 00:18:28,580
Your fingernails are pretty now.

265
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,048
I like it.

266
00:18:30,048 --> 00:18:31,116
I know, huh?

267
00:18:31,116 --> 00:18:32,618
My fingernails have a hidden secret to them.

268
00:18:32,618 --> 00:18:34,520
I only have to show a woman my fingernails,

269
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,421
and she's attracted to me right away!

270
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:38,089
Woman?

271
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:38,991
Man!

272
00:18:38,991 --> 00:18:41,092
Oh, then why didn't you say so? Why, why?!

273
00:18:50,568 --> 00:18:55,306
Jin Ho, even when you are peeling an apple... 
You do it so carefully and well.

274
00:18:55,306 --> 00:18:57,376
You're a great cook, you're good at housework,

275
00:18:57,376 --> 00:18:59,044
you even peel an apple better than anyone else.

276
00:18:59,044 --> 00:19:01,479
Is there anything you aren't fantastic at?

277
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,015
No, there isn't.

278
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:07,753
When you say something like that...

279
00:19:07,753 --> 00:19:10,455
you don't feel embarrassed or anything like that?

280
00:19:10,455 --> 00:19:12,757
Why should I? It's the truth anyway.

281
00:19:12,757 --> 00:19:16,027
There... this is your negative point.

282
00:19:16,027 --> 00:19:19,464
You don't know how to be humble. You aren't humble.

283
00:19:21,332 --> 00:19:24,002
Tomorrow's Sunday. What are we doing?

284
00:19:24,002 --> 00:19:25,737
What else but house cleaning?

285
00:19:25,737 --> 00:19:27,539
Let's forget about that and go see the cherry blossoms.

286
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:30,541
Why should we go see the cherry blossoms like a pair of pensioners?

287
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,110
It's part of the "making a woman" project...

288
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,012
If we're strolling along under the blossoms,

289
00:19:34,012 --> 00:19:35,914
it will be such a nice atmosphere.

290
00:19:35,914 --> 00:19:37,983
Don't you think?

291
00:19:38,751 --> 00:19:42,187
If you spent even just one day without me, would you get bored?

292
00:19:42,187 --> 00:19:43,622
I would, a bit.

293
00:19:47,326 --> 00:19:49,561
- Oh, hyung. 
- Oh, Young Sun.

294
00:19:50,696 --> 00:19:52,364
So darling,

295
00:19:52,364 --> 00:19:55,234
we'll try that shot again... Act naturally.

296
00:19:55,234 --> 00:19:56,568
Yes, just like that!

297
00:19:56,568 --> 00:19:58,970
Lower it... Yeah, lower.

298
00:20:01,507 --> 00:20:02,974
Close your mouth a little.

299
00:20:02,974 --> 00:20:04,242
Aigoo...

300
00:20:04,242 --> 00:20:07,545
I thought he would do well, so why is he being like that...?

301
00:20:07,545 --> 00:20:09,948
Argh, just what is happening?

302
00:20:10,449 --> 00:20:13,218
Excuse me, Jin Ho.

303
00:20:13,218 --> 00:20:14,520
Just a moment.

304
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,521
Yes?

305
00:20:19,124 --> 00:20:22,427
Jin Ho, hold the product closer to your face.

306
00:20:22,427 --> 00:20:24,196
Yes, yes, just like that.

307
00:20:24,196 --> 00:20:26,664
Act naturally.

308
00:20:26,664 --> 00:20:29,234
Put on a happy expression.

309
00:20:29,234 --> 00:20:31,436
Okay! That's it!

310
00:20:33,271 --> 00:20:34,406
Next pose!

311
00:20:34,406 --> 00:20:35,507
Wait a minute.

312
00:20:35,507 --> 00:20:38,811
Don't you think that his expression is a little wrong?

313
00:20:38,811 --> 00:20:40,712
Yes, okay. Just a moment. Move aside.

314
00:20:40,712 --> 00:20:43,248
Hey, don't you think I'm a much suitable candidate for this shoot?

315
00:20:43,248 --> 00:20:46,252
Let's do sexy, ok? Have your collar pulled down like so.

316
00:20:46,252 --> 00:20:47,519
Aiyyy, that's it!

317
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,489
Okay, I'll strip off my clothes later when it's my turn to shoot.

318
00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:54,760
Yeah. Move aside, please.

319
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,395
Jin Ho, just a little bit more, okay?

320
00:20:57,395 --> 00:20:58,330
But Young Sun...

321
00:21:00,011 --> 00:21:01,369
do you think Sang Jun...

322
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:04,838
is really right as a cosmetics model?

323
00:21:04,838 --> 00:21:08,175
Sang Jun is for the "before" shots. Jin Ho is for the "after" shots.

324
00:21:08,772 --> 00:21:10,677
Hey, how can you..?

325
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:14,047
He's more handsome you know.

326
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:15,848
Yes! Nice!

327
00:21:15,848 --> 00:21:19,901


328
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,399
What now, Chang-Ryul?

329
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:33,700
It's Chang Ryul?!

330
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:35,502
Today?

331
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,371
I can't make it today.

332
00:21:37,371 --> 00:21:40,807
I'm helping Young Sun out 
with a photoshoot for her online store.

333
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:44,811
No! There's no need to come pick me up.

334
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,447
Yeah...

335
00:21:47,447 --> 00:21:49,683
If I'm free some other time I'll call you. Bye now!

336
00:21:50,884 --> 00:21:53,153
Hey, you! Just what are you up to?

337
00:21:53,153 --> 00:21:54,488
An eye for an eye.

338
00:21:54,488 --> 00:21:55,837
A tooth for a tooth.

339
00:21:55,837 --> 00:21:58,291
I want to pay him back for all the hurt he's caused me.

340
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,961
From this moment on, you can call me Vengeance Incarnate!

341
00:22:00,961 --> 00:22:02,363
Are you kidding me?

342
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,431
You kidding me?
You will carry your revenge til your deathbed.

343
00:22:04,431 --> 00:22:04,831
You know?

344
00:22:04,831 --> 00:22:07,100
Don't meet him anymore.

345
00:22:12,172 --> 00:22:14,140
I just told you,  I'll call you when I have time.

346
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:20,613
Oh, ok. Then let's meet tomorrow.

347
00:22:22,348 --> 00:22:26,386
Uh... Jin Ho, I got a call from Han Chang Ryul just now.

348
00:22:27,754 --> 00:22:28,789
So what?

349
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:33,593
Before I go out on a date with him, how 
about giving me some more training?

350
00:22:33,593 --> 00:22:35,062
What training?

351
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,897
You're really getting serious about this.

352
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,300
Young Sun, Sang Jun, you guys can go first.

353
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,536
Young-Sun, Sang-Joon sshi..You guys can go first!
We still have some unfinished business here.

354
00:22:42,536 --> 00:22:43,537
Bye!

355
00:22:43,537 --> 00:22:44,638
What business?

356
00:22:45,505 --> 00:22:46,806
Go ahead first!

357
00:22:48,942 --> 00:22:51,645
Am I seeing things?

358
00:22:51,645 --> 00:22:52,579
Seeing what?

359
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,580
These two...

360
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,284
No, no. It can't be, right?

361
00:22:58,284 --> 00:23:00,053
They do make a really good-looking couple, though.

362
00:23:00,053 --> 00:23:01,088
What did you say?

363
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,158
I'm mean those two birds over there.

364
00:23:04,158 --> 00:23:05,492
See those 2 birds??
They flew away...

365
00:23:10,463 --> 00:23:11,398
So then,

366
00:23:11,398 --> 00:23:13,400
You know..
When do you plan on stopping for your revenge?

367
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,868
I'm not sure...

368
00:23:14,868 --> 00:23:16,836
When he proposes to me, maybe?

369
00:23:16,836 --> 00:23:20,307
"Kae In, will you marry me?"

370
00:23:20,307 --> 00:23:21,675
The moment he slips the ring onto my finger,

371
00:23:21,675 --> 00:23:23,643
I'll quickly dump the ring onto the 
ground and stomp on it!

372
00:23:23,643 --> 00:23:24,845
Or...

373
00:23:24,845 --> 00:23:27,280
Or...
I'll disappear just before the wedding march begins!

374
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,886
No no... This is even better! 
Jin Ho, you snatch me away in Chang Ryul's face!

375
00:23:32,886 --> 00:23:34,954
Yes... I like that last one the best!

376
00:23:34,954 --> 00:23:36,823
Why would I do something like that?

377
00:23:38,658 --> 00:23:44,364
That's true... You don't have any reason to do that, so why would you?

378
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,235
All right, I'll go along with that.

379
00:23:48,235 --> 00:23:49,736
All right, i get it..
 I'll help you that way.

380
00:23:51,438 --> 00:23:53,741
If things get so far,

381
00:23:53,741 --> 00:23:55,909
if it comes down to such an extent(wedding), 
I'll be sure to sweep you off your feet and leave with you.

382
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,880
Because we are good friends.

383
00:24:05,852 --> 00:24:07,220
Really?

384
00:24:08,455 --> 00:24:15,328
So then Jin Ho, you will grab my hand 
like that and whisk me away?

385
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,130
Is that a promise?

386
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,665
You're really keen on promises...

387
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:23,637


388
00:24:24,037 --> 00:24:25,339
Jin Ho!

389
00:24:29,842 --> 00:24:31,612
How could you... How could you?!

390
00:24:31,612 --> 00:24:33,279
How could you...
How could you...
Oh no "mother"!!

391
00:24:45,758 --> 00:24:48,228
Should I head out to buy some pills for you?

392
00:24:48,228 --> 00:24:49,797
Who was it that got her into this state?

393
00:24:49,797 --> 00:24:51,431
It is all cause of you that she fainted..
No way i can accept your help!

394
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:54,768
How could you do this?

395
00:24:54,768 --> 00:24:57,404
You can't be like this..
I have always had my trust in Jin-ho...

396
00:24:57,404 --> 00:25:01,973
His reason for living here is his work.

397
00:25:01,973 --> 00:25:04,811
I felt sad for you.

398
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,148
But yet, you misused my trust in you,

399
00:25:08,148 --> 00:25:09,750
and you are living with a woman?

400
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,285
Umm... It's not like that, mother...

401
00:25:12,285 --> 00:25:13,319
"Mother?"

402
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:15,188
"Mother"??!?? 
She isn't your "mother"??

403
00:25:15,188 --> 00:25:16,423
Hye Mi, be quiet.

404
00:25:16,423 --> 00:25:18,192
How can I keep quiet?

405
00:25:18,192 --> 00:25:20,794
I'm your fiancée, oppa, so how can I keep quiet?

406
00:25:21,961 --> 00:25:23,430
Fiancée?

407
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:25,533
Yeah.

408
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:27,367
I'm Jin Ho oppa's fiancée.

409
00:25:29,235 --> 00:25:33,273
Ji-Jin Ho... Just a moment please...

410
00:25:33,273 --> 00:25:36,176
First...firstly, 
let's talk outside for a moment please..

411
00:25:36,176 --> 00:25:38,845
What gives you the right to head outside to talk with my oppa?

412
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,914
Let's go outside.

413
00:25:44,217 --> 00:25:48,355
Mother, mother, look! Look at how disrespectful 
they are being in front of you!

414
00:25:50,624 --> 00:25:53,193
Jin Ho, um...

415
00:25:53,193 --> 00:25:55,696
Err, Jin-Ho sshi..
How about letting the truth out in the open?

416
00:25:55,696 --> 00:25:56,596
What truth?

417
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:59,065
Don't you feel sad for her?

418
00:25:59,065 --> 00:26:00,701
She doesn't know the truth about your sexual preference.

419
00:26:00,701 --> 00:26:02,870
And she thinks of herself as your fiancée.

420
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:05,572
Seems like your mother isn't in the best of health too...

421
00:26:05,572 --> 00:26:08,074
You have been keeping things in the closet all this time...

422
00:26:08,074 --> 00:26:09,877
It's better to tell her the truth sooner.

423
00:26:09,877 --> 00:26:11,812
If you come clean with her,

424
00:26:11,812 --> 00:26:13,313
It's better to tell her the truth earlier..
If you come clean with her, 
I'm sure your mother will understand.

425
00:26:13,313 --> 00:26:14,648
This is not the time to talk about that kind of stuff.

426
00:26:14,648 --> 00:26:16,484
Jin Ho,

427
00:26:16,484 --> 00:26:19,786
a mother will always stand by her child.

428
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:23,250
Naturally, it will come as a shock to her,

429
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,125
Although it might come as a shock to her..
In time she will understand you.

430
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,427
Are you saying that I should tell my mother I'm gay?

431
00:26:27,427 --> 00:26:28,528
Of course.

432
00:26:28,528 --> 00:26:30,030
Are you in your right mind?

433
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:35,769
Gay?

434
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:37,571
Hyung!

435
00:26:37,571 --> 00:26:39,072
Hyung...
 GggggAYY?

436
00:26:39,072 --> 00:26:44,044
Ah yes... There was that time when 
you said maybe you did like men...

437
00:26:44,957 --> 00:26:46,647
J-Jin Ho...

438
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,149
I... I...

439
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,320
No, mother, I am not gay.

440
00:26:56,389 --> 00:26:58,470
Kae In, come closer.

441
00:26:59,192 --> 00:26:59,693
Huh?

442
00:26:59,693 --> 00:27:01,161
I said come here.

443
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,800
Mother,

444
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,435
Mother...
I love this woman.

445
00:27:09,736 --> 00:27:11,571
O-oppa!

446
00:27:14,975 --> 00:27:16,977
I want to marry her.

447
00:27:20,012 --> 00:27:21,882
J-Jin Ho...

448
00:27:22,816 --> 00:27:25,319
Kae In, go ahead and introduce yourself.

449
00:27:28,588 --> 00:27:30,357
What are waiting for? 
Introduce yourself like I said.

450
00:27:34,561 --> 00:27:35,963
I'm Park Kae In.

451
00:27:38,565 --> 00:27:39,666
Hye Mi!

452
00:27:43,103 --> 00:27:45,272
So...

453
00:27:45,272 --> 00:27:48,008
So...
So you're not gay?

454
00:27:48,008 --> 00:27:49,576
I told you I'm not.

455
00:27:53,113 --> 00:27:57,618
W-What did you say your name was?

456
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,254
Park Kae In, ma'am.

457
00:28:01,588 --> 00:28:03,056
Kae In...

458
00:28:04,858 --> 00:28:09,896
Do you...  love my Jin Ho?

459
00:28:21,141 --> 00:28:24,377
Yes, I love Jin Ho.

460
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,951
 I love this woman. 

461
00:28:32,652 --> 00:28:34,754
 I want to marry her. 

462
00:28:38,671 --> 00:28:40,661
Even though it was an emergency,

463
00:28:40,661 --> 00:28:42,432
how could he come out with such a lie?

464
00:28:42,432 --> 00:28:46,733
And in front of his mother... 
What happens if we get found out?

465
00:28:47,568 --> 00:28:48,835
I'm here.

466
00:28:50,004 --> 00:28:51,404
Oh... You're here...

467
00:28:52,139 --> 00:28:54,908
Why are you alone?

468
00:28:59,469 --> 00:29:04,918
I went home, but whichever way I thought about it, 
I guessed you were in a lot of danger, so I came back over.

469
00:29:04,918 --> 00:29:06,053
What danger...

470
00:29:06,053 --> 00:29:08,488
What danger do you think? You and Jin Ho.

471
00:29:09,108 --> 00:29:10,090
When you two are together,

472
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,258
you look like lovers,

473
00:29:11,258 --> 00:29:12,292
Both of you..
look like lovers. 
no resemblance of friendship.

474
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,327
Hey!

475
00:29:13,327 --> 00:29:15,228
Hey..
how could Jin-Ho sshi and i be lovers?

476
00:29:15,228 --> 00:29:15,863
That's what I'm saying.

477
00:29:15,863 --> 00:29:20,867
And you still underwent training for 
breaking up with Chang Ryul...

478
00:29:20,867 --> 00:29:24,504
It's all for my revenge! That's why I underwent training.

479
00:29:24,504 --> 00:29:25,973
But  Kae In,

480
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:30,177
But..Kae-in..
I don't think you are doing this for the sake of revenge..

481
00:29:30,177 --> 00:29:32,946
Then you think that I will still get back 
together with Han Chang Ryul?

482
00:29:32,946 --> 00:29:34,115
I don't.

483
00:29:34,115 --> 00:29:35,049
What I'm saying is

484
00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:38,585
I don't..
What i'm saying is...
you are training with Jin-Ho for the sake of being together with him!

485
00:29:38,585 --> 00:29:40,620
Not only for revenge against Han Chang Ryul.

486
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:45,692
I can see it's true.

487
00:29:47,694 --> 00:29:50,197
Kae In, get yourself together.

488
00:29:50,197 --> 00:29:52,165
Jin-Ho sshi..
is a big N O!

489
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:55,436
Look, even if Jin Ho left his goal wide open, 
without a goalkeeper in sight,

490
00:29:55,436 --> 00:29:57,204
Treat Jin-Ho as non-existent!!
 You can never treat him as a man!

491
00:29:57,204 --> 00:29:58,071
I know!

492
00:29:58,071 --> 00:30:00,774
Even if you have a just a tiny shred of feeling for him..
You will still get in trouble!

493
00:30:00,774 --> 00:30:02,976
But... our problem's gotten bigger.

494
00:30:02,976 --> 00:30:05,012
What? What now?

495
00:30:05,445 --> 00:30:07,514
Jin Ho wants to marry me...

496
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:12,786


497
00:30:12,786 --> 00:30:14,355
What's the matter?

498
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:16,522
Hye Mi... What's wrong with you? Why are you doing this?

499
00:30:16,923 --> 00:30:19,093
You can't do this!

500
00:30:19,093 --> 00:30:20,193
Ah Hyung...
Please dissuade her from being like this..

501
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:27,200
Let go! What's the point of living any more? Let me die! I can't bear the sight of Jin Ho oppa marrying someone else!

502
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,505
Why are you doing this? 
Hyung, please stop her.

503
00:30:32,106 --> 00:30:33,206
Please put a stop to this!

504
00:30:34,307 --> 00:30:37,044
Hey, Na Hye Mi, listen carefully.

505
00:30:38,912 --> 00:30:41,314
I have never loved you...
I'm sure you know it too.

506
00:30:41,314 --> 00:30:43,716
It's enough if I love you!

507
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,585
Love isn't something you do by yourself.

508
00:30:45,585 --> 00:30:46,853
I can do it.

509
00:30:46,853 --> 00:30:48,621
The person who really loves you...

510
00:30:51,491 --> 00:30:52,993
is this guy, Tae Hoon.

511
00:30:53,694 --> 00:30:54,661
Hyung...

512
00:30:54,661 --> 00:31:00,255
Just like your one-sided love for me has made you suffer, 
Tae Hoon has suffered the same way.

513
00:31:00,255 --> 00:31:03,646
He has been hurting a lot because of you.

514
00:31:03,646 --> 00:31:05,318
But I don't love him.

515
00:31:05,318 --> 00:31:06,550
So you're saying

516
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:10,142
the fact that I don't love you at all 
is going to make you die?

517
00:31:11,827 --> 00:31:12,663
Go ahead and die then.

518
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:15,558
Hyung, is that your idea of talking her out of it?

519
00:31:15,558 --> 00:31:16,882
Don't listen.

520
00:31:16,882 --> 00:31:17,831
Don't listen to this.

521
00:31:17,831 --> 00:31:21,096
From now on stop looking at me. Look at this guy instead.

522
00:31:21,096 --> 00:31:24,323
If you do, you may come to love him.

523
00:31:33,566 --> 00:31:35,960
Don't cry now, Hye Mi...

524
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,065
If you feel like hitting me, go right ahead 
if it'll make you feel better.

525
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,902

526
00:31:49,757 --> 00:31:51,817
Hey, Jin Ho is really strange.

527
00:31:51,817 --> 00:31:55,534
It's already nerve wrecking enough. 
He shouldn't use you like that!

528
00:31:56,518 --> 00:31:59,492
He loves his mother so very much.

529
00:31:59,492 --> 00:32:02,027
What are you gonna do now?

530
00:32:02,027 --> 00:32:06,610
If Jin Ho's mother consents to this wedding, what will you do?

531
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:09,434
I...

532
00:32:10,636 --> 00:32:12,938
Couldn't I just marry him?

533
00:32:12,938 --> 00:32:14,882
Are you crazy?

534
00:32:14,882 --> 00:32:17,738
Have you gone crazy?

535
00:32:19,211 --> 00:32:20,946
He absolutely...

536
00:32:20,946 --> 00:32:26,454
doesn't have the courage to tell his mother the truth.

537
00:32:27,386 --> 00:32:33,351
I want to spend the rest of my life sheltering him from the wind.

538
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:35,937
Am I...

539
00:32:35,937 --> 00:32:37,363
not allowed to do that?

540
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:42,735
You have really gone crazy!

541
00:32:42,735 --> 00:32:45,158
Do you even know what are you saying right now?

542
00:32:45,158 --> 00:32:49,741
He can't even love you as a woman, 
and yet you talk about  "sheltering him from the wind"?

543
00:32:49,741 --> 00:32:52,647
Couldn't we live together as friends?

544
00:32:52,647 --> 00:32:54,647
Kae In...

545
00:32:54,647 --> 00:32:56,649
There are things you can do for him as a friend,

546
00:32:56,649 --> 00:33:00,244
but there are things you can't do, too, you stupid girl.

547
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,593
Jin Ho...

548
00:33:04,593 --> 00:33:07,001
as far as he can,

549
00:33:07,001 --> 00:33:11,229
wants to live up to his mother's idea 
of what a man should be.

550
00:33:11,697 --> 00:33:14,099
I...

551
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:17,269
feel that if I can help him in this,

552
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:18,771
I could bring myself to do it.

553
00:33:18,771 --> 00:33:21,803
I think the word "friend" is just an excuse!

554
00:33:21,803 --> 00:33:24,472
You just want to be by Jin Ho's side!

555
00:33:24,472 --> 00:33:26,144
Am I right?

556
00:33:30,616 --> 00:33:33,989
What can you do...

557
00:33:34,687 --> 00:33:35,954
Back then, I...

558
00:33:35,954 --> 00:33:39,725
I should have not told you to rent a room to him.

559
00:33:41,627 --> 00:33:45,300
What has this done to you?

560
00:33:53,505 --> 00:33:57,109
I'm seriously going crazy here...

561
00:33:57,109 --> 00:34:00,179
What should I do?

562
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:04,161
Ah!

563
00:34:23,068 --> 00:34:25,637
So you're back now?

564
00:34:25,637 --> 00:34:28,740
Is your mother feeling better?

565
00:34:29,883 --> 00:34:33,479
Jin Ho, your mother is a real beauty.

566
00:34:33,479 --> 00:34:36,448
You resemble your mother.

567
00:34:36,448 --> 00:34:39,584
I'm sorry I gave you such a shock earlier.

568
00:34:39,584 --> 00:34:41,403
The situation called for--

569
00:34:41,403 --> 00:34:43,493
I understand!

570
00:34:43,493 --> 00:34:45,090
It's because...

571
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:48,694
you really, really love your mother.

572
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:54,533
After a while, when things have gone back to normal...

573
00:34:54,533 --> 00:34:56,716
Jin Ho...

574
00:34:58,539 --> 00:35:01,406
If it's the case...

575
00:35:02,341 --> 00:35:08,514
If it's the case that you really don't have the courage...

576
00:35:08,514 --> 00:35:14,587
to be honest with your mother...

577
00:35:14,587 --> 00:35:16,821
and...

578
00:35:16,821 --> 00:35:19,624
you want her to see you

579
00:35:19,624 --> 00:35:23,895
as an ordinary man married to a woman...

580
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:29,764
I'll do that for you.

581
00:35:34,506 --> 00:35:35,842
I...

582
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,944
will act as your shield.

583
00:35:38,944 --> 00:35:43,615
You won't have to worry about 
people pointing fingers at you.

584
00:35:43,615 --> 00:35:47,919
So you can do whatever you want to do, Jin Ho.

585
00:35:54,968 --> 00:35:58,755
Do you think what you're saying makes any sense?

586
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,917
You only marry someone whom you want to marry! 
You don't even know this basic concept?

587
00:36:08,841 --> 00:36:13,278
Please! I have told you to love yourself. 
How many times must I repeat myself?

588
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,524
Jin Ho...

589
00:36:25,524 --> 00:36:27,726
the person you are in love with

590
00:36:27,726 --> 00:36:30,862
is someone you can't marry, as you well know.

591
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:42,074
Even though you can't love me as a woman...

592
00:36:43,008 --> 00:36:45,311
I think if I were in your place,

593
00:36:45,311 --> 00:36:50,182
I could gladly walk beside you for the rest of my life.

594
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:56,288
Don't you realize that's the attitude 
that's always made you into a doormat?

595
00:36:56,288 --> 00:36:59,692
To marry your gay friend is a dumb idea.

596
00:37:01,927 --> 00:37:04,897
I may have dumb ideas like that,

597
00:37:04,897 --> 00:37:07,666
but don't you realize...?

598
00:37:07,666 --> 00:37:09,622
To me, you're by far the dearest friend I have

599
00:37:09,622 --> 00:37:13,405
in the whole world.

600
00:37:14,974 --> 00:37:18,143
So, for you,

601
00:37:18,143 --> 00:37:21,447
I can do anything.

602
00:37:30,222 --> 00:37:32,758
Let's you and me...

603
00:37:33,993 --> 00:37:36,628
stop being friends.

604
00:37:40,999 --> 00:37:44,269
I'm so weary, I can't take any more.

605
00:38:22,482 --> 00:38:26,845
You should have asked me if I'm capable of loving a woman...

606
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,449
Foolish girl.

607
00:38:47,372 --> 00:38:50,335
What should I do?

608
00:38:51,971 --> 00:38:55,641
If we can't even be friends...

609
00:39:13,993 --> 00:39:16,030
Excuse me.

610
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:23,736
Hello!

611
00:39:24,436 --> 00:39:25,905
Do you still remember me?

612
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,272
Of course.

613
00:39:27,272 --> 00:39:29,341
We met at Sang Go Jae. You're Park Kae In's friend.

614
00:39:29,341 --> 00:39:31,310
What a relief.

615
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:35,681
I was afraid that you would 
not see me if I said I was her friend.

616
00:39:35,681 --> 00:39:37,348
Did you really think that?

617
00:39:37,348 --> 00:39:41,153
I've come to be on friendly terms 
with Park Kae In myself too.

618
00:39:41,153 --> 00:39:42,021
Sit down, please.

619
00:39:42,021 --> 00:39:46,879
So, Park Kae In, when it comes to making friends, 
you prefer a particular type...

620
00:39:46,879 --> 00:39:48,427
Excuse me?

621
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,095
Ah, nothing...

622
00:39:50,095 --> 00:39:52,865
Great office decor!

623
00:39:52,865 --> 00:39:55,066
Really!

624
00:39:55,066 --> 00:39:57,403
So, what brings you here?

625
00:39:57,403 --> 00:40:00,473
I've been meaning to come and thank you,

626
00:40:00,473 --> 00:40:02,341
but I've left it rather late.

627
00:40:02,341 --> 00:40:03,542
What is it you want to thank me for?

628
00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:06,245
You don't know how happy Kae In is now.

629
00:40:06,245 --> 00:40:09,448
I heard you've given her a job designing the children's section.

630
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,150
Yes.

631
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:14,853
When she needed it most, you gave her a lifeline.

632
00:40:14,853 --> 00:40:19,425
Kae In is ditzy and slow, but she has such 
a friend backing her up from such a high position...

633
00:40:19,425 --> 00:40:22,060
I'm so grateful, I could cry.

634
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,096
Would you like to borrow a handkerchief?

635
00:40:24,096 --> 00:40:24,663
What?

636
00:40:24,663 --> 00:40:27,766
You said you felt like shedding tears of gratitude.

637
00:40:27,766 --> 00:40:30,302
Are you going to cry?

638
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,406
Oh, humor! That was humor, right?

639
00:40:34,406 --> 00:40:35,241
Right, humor.

640
00:40:35,241 --> 00:40:37,343
It really was meant to be funny!

641
00:40:37,343 --> 00:40:39,545
I really thought that I'd die from
 holding in the laughter there.

642
00:40:39,545 --> 00:40:41,847
I almost made a mess of things.

643
00:40:41,847 --> 00:40:44,783
They say friends are alike.

644
00:40:44,783 --> 00:40:48,987
I thought you and Park Kae In would 
share a similar sense of humor.

645
00:40:48,987 --> 00:40:50,055
No, it's not like that...

646
00:40:50,055 --> 00:40:53,392
I just wanted to express to you how thankful I really am.

647
00:40:53,392 --> 00:40:54,360
Huh?

648
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,829
Are you free tonight? Do you have time?

649
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,998
Where do you want to meet tonight?

650
00:41:00,998 --> 00:41:04,662
No need, I'll pick you up from the museum right now.

651
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:07,666
Sorry, Chang Ryul. Today won't do.

652
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:11,369
Why? Yesterday was Sunday and we couldn't even meet.

653
00:41:12,004 --> 00:41:15,240
Today I'm not in the mood to meet you.

654
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,109
Why? Are you not feeling well?

655
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:19,257
The president is calling you.

656
00:41:19,745 --> 00:41:22,547
Are you still not feeling well 
after you got hurt the other day?

657
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:23,698
That's not what the problem is.

658
00:41:23,698 --> 00:41:27,352
Then let's just meet today, Kae In. I'll make you feel better.

659
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:29,788
Sorry, Chang Ryul, let's meet some other time.

660
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:31,430
Bye now.

661
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,824
Hello? Kae In?

662
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:33,492
Kae In?

663
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:35,661
Sir, the president...

664
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:37,429
Okay! I told you I got it!

665
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:49,774
Ah yes... Professor Park. I wanted to meet you 
about the wedding of my son and your daughter.

666
00:41:49,774 --> 00:41:50,909
Father!

667
00:41:52,144 --> 00:42:00,152
I know it's not easy during term time. So I was wondering 
whether I could come over to England. 
How would you feel about that?

668
00:42:00,152 --> 00:42:01,820
Father, why are you doing this?

669
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,256
Oh, you are coming back soon?

670
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:12,264
But there is an urgent matter at hand now, 
so how about if we met up immediately?

671
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,532
Ah, yes.

672
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,803
Aigoo, then that's too bad.

673
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:22,641
I'll be looking forward to meeting you 
as soon as possible after you return.

674
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:25,444
Then have a nice day.

675
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,681
Father, why are you doing things this way?

676
00:42:30,449 --> 00:42:33,218
I told you I would solve the problem between Kae In and myself!

677
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:35,453
There's no time.

678
00:42:35,453 --> 00:42:40,859
MS Group's President Choi 
has given Director Choi full control over the Dam Arts Center Project.

679
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:43,328
We're fighting with knives now, to the death!

680
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:49,534
Director Choi has already set his 
sights on Jin Ho for the project.

681
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:54,439
It is almost a certainty now that 
the project will fall into Jin Ho's hands.

682
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:57,642
We just need to have a better design 
and the issue will be resolved!

683
00:42:57,642 --> 00:43:01,780
You punk, there's an easy road so 
why are you trying to go around it?

684
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:10,722
The word is that Director Choi would still like 
to entrust the project design to Professor Park.

685
00:43:10,722 --> 00:43:16,495
So if Professor Park was on our side, 
we'd have it made!

686
00:43:16,495 --> 00:43:20,295
Father, this project is supposed to be under my control. My control!

687
00:43:20,295 --> 00:43:25,370
So, you can grab the heart of the 
Sang Go Jae lady for sure then?

688
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:29,573


689
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:41,250
I already told you I didn't want to meet today.

690
00:43:42,487 --> 00:43:44,890
There's something I've really got to say.

691
00:43:45,724 --> 00:43:47,592
Can't you say it some other time?

692
00:43:47,592 --> 00:43:49,361
I have to get this ready.

693
00:43:50,262 --> 00:43:53,904
That Jin Ho guy... How long do you intend 
to let him stay at Sang Go Jae?

694
00:43:53,904 --> 00:43:59,004
Is that what you came to say? You were 
supposed to be understanding. And patient, too.

695
00:43:59,004 --> 00:44:03,975
Okay, being friends is fine, but isn't living 
together taking things a bit too far?

696
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:09,013
The thought of a girl as innocent as yourself 
living with such a despicable guy makes me...

697
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:12,150
If you've come to say bad things about Jin Ho, then don't.

698
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:14,286
What?

699
00:44:14,286 --> 00:44:18,122
At the moment you said those words, 
have you any idea how I felt?

700
00:44:20,526 --> 00:44:27,899
I mean on the day you came to see me and said you were casting me aside because I refused to give myself to you completely.

701
00:44:29,347 --> 00:44:32,804
One day, I had a drink with Jin Ho and told him all about it.

702
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:38,610
How after all I'd given you, you still said it wasn't enough.

703
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:46,685
That I wasn't a real woman, but just a little girl. 
It was Jin Ho who listened while I told him all that.

704
00:44:48,787 --> 00:44:51,956
You're telling me now we should start over,

705
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:57,462
But you wounded me so badly then, 
that I'm still not ready to open my heart again.

706
00:44:59,798 --> 00:45:08,140
And now, where I'm concerned, you are much less important to me than Jin Ho, who's such a friend to me.

707
00:45:10,409 --> 00:45:15,612
Is Jeon Jin Ho really that important to you?

708
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:19,351
Right now, yes.

709
00:45:21,653 --> 00:45:24,022
Okay. Get back to work.

710
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:46,011


711
00:45:47,012 --> 00:45:48,113
Kim In Hee,

712
00:45:51,083 --> 00:45:53,051
you really have the confidence to do this, right?

713
00:45:54,953 --> 00:45:56,254
What are you talking about?

714
00:45:57,088 --> 00:46:01,126
Do you really have the heart to make Jin Ho your man?

715
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,961
I do.

716
00:46:03,618 --> 00:46:04,996
Then make sure it ends that way,

717
00:46:04,996 --> 00:46:05,831
What's wrong with you?

718
00:46:05,831 --> 00:46:10,135
You do that, and please get that Jin Ho guy away from Kae In.

719
00:46:10,135 --> 00:46:12,570
Is Kae In saying something?

720
00:46:14,673 --> 00:46:18,444
She says he's more important to her than I am.

721
00:46:18,444 --> 00:46:23,448
This is what I warned you about. 
She sees Jin Ho in a different way.

722
00:46:24,249 --> 00:46:31,389
I'm begging you. I don't want to lose the one I love all over again.

723
00:46:34,626 --> 00:46:38,463
I've got the sketch for the Dam Arts Center, 
so you take a look.

724
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:42,567
Okay.

725
00:46:43,736 --> 00:46:45,103
Yes, Young Sun?

726
00:46:46,705 --> 00:46:49,007
Hey, why is Unni calling you?

727
00:46:49,742 --> 00:46:54,046
Please come in early. I'd like to serve you dinner.

728
00:46:54,046 --> 00:46:57,449
Okay, I'll come in right after work.

729
00:46:59,918 --> 00:47:02,554
Hey, why did Young Sun call you?

730
00:47:03,222 --> 00:47:05,457
She said to come home early because she's serving dinner.

731
00:47:05,457 --> 00:47:08,560
Oh, should I come too?

732
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,128
Hyung, didn't you say you had an appointment?

733
00:47:10,329 --> 00:47:15,434
Oh yeah, you're right. Why does unni have 
to have a dinner on a day like this?

734
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:18,970
Hey, should I call her to see if we can move it?

735
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:26,077
Director, there's a phone call from 
Han Chang Ryul of Mirae Construction.

736
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:27,345
Who?

737
00:47:41,293 --> 00:47:44,363
What's this about, asking me to meet you at a place like this?

738
00:47:47,366 --> 00:47:52,004
Right to this very day, I've never once had to wait for Kae In.

739
00:47:54,106 --> 00:48:03,415
When we had a date she always arrived before time and waited for me, and when I was late, I never said sorry.

740
00:48:05,016 --> 00:48:06,918
Why are you telling me this?

741
00:48:08,153 --> 00:48:12,591
The way Kae In always waited for me, no matter how late I was,

742
00:48:13,058 --> 00:48:17,863
I used to think she was some kind of idiot. 
I thought she was a pushover.

743
00:48:18,997 --> 00:48:20,131
Jerk.

744
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:27,038
But now I think I understand. 
The way Kae In must have felt when she was waiting for me.

745
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:37,080
Now when I look at Kae In who can't open her heart, 
 it's as if I've come to know just how waiting like that feels.

746
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:40,652
What's the reason for telling me this?

747
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:49,461
I know that you're not gay. 
I couldn't believe that you were gay.

748
00:48:50,062 --> 00:48:51,930
I did a background check.

749
00:48:52,898 --> 00:48:58,570
I was going to tell Kae In that you were 
a bad guy for trying to use Director Choi,

750
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:02,507
but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

751
00:49:03,841 --> 00:49:07,913
Because Kae In would have kicked you out of Sang Go Jae.

752
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:17,022
Kae In... told me that right now 
you are more important to her than I am.

753
00:49:19,698 --> 00:49:31,669
Finding out that the friend she so trusted had in fact been lying all along, would have wounded her deeper still.

754
00:49:39,945 --> 00:49:41,613
So, Jeon Jin Ho,

755
00:49:44,382 --> 00:49:46,051
leave that house right now.

756
00:49:46,785 --> 00:49:51,189
If you're really her friend, make a clean break with her.

757
00:49:52,858 --> 00:49:57,462
What I've just said to you... 
I trust that you've fully understood it.

758
00:50:09,107 --> 00:50:10,208
Wow.

759
00:50:12,378 --> 00:50:14,346
Finished.

760
00:50:14,346 --> 00:50:16,381
Hey, but why are there four places?

761
00:50:17,183 --> 00:50:21,887
I've put my all into making this dinner perfect, 
so you just stay put.

762
00:50:22,388 --> 00:50:24,690
It's a real spread!

763
00:50:26,158 --> 00:50:27,559
Oh, he must be here.

764
00:50:28,561 --> 00:50:30,128
Huh? Who's here?

765
00:50:33,398 --> 00:50:34,966
Oh, Director Choi, you're here.

766
00:50:34,966 --> 00:50:38,837
Oh, you didn't have to bring flowers.

767
00:50:38,837 --> 00:50:40,938
You could have just brought yourself along.

768
00:50:40,938 --> 00:50:44,175
Since you so kindly invited me, I couldn't just come empty handed.

769
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:48,346
I stopped by a funeral hall and bought this basket.

770
00:50:53,452 --> 00:50:55,354
It wasn't very funny, was it?

771
00:50:55,788 --> 00:50:58,957
Ah, let's go in.

772
00:51:00,913 --> 00:51:03,046
Director Choi!

773
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:07,465
Thank you for inviting me.

774
00:51:08,279 --> 00:51:10,987
Hey, look at the flowers he brought as a present.

775
00:51:11,928 --> 00:51:14,079
Come on in.

776
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:14,900
Yes.

777
00:51:17,246 --> 00:51:20,012
Oh, Jin Ho is here!

778
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:49,335
Shall we drink a toast?

779
00:51:49,335 --> 00:51:51,999
Toast!

780
00:51:55,562 --> 00:52:01,033
Why are you not eating? 
It may not look good, but it tastes good.

781
00:52:01,033 --> 00:52:05,522
Yes, Young Sun is really good at cooking.

782
00:52:12,323 --> 00:52:13,707
Just a moment.

783
00:52:13,707 --> 00:52:15,483
Oh, honey.

784
00:52:16,437 --> 00:52:17,704
What?!

785
00:52:17,704 --> 00:52:19,977
Joon Hyuk isn't home?

786
00:52:19,977 --> 00:52:22,750
Alright. I'm coming right away. Yeah.

787
00:52:23,985 --> 00:52:26,272
Hey, what do you mean Joon Hyuk isn't home?

788
00:52:26,272 --> 00:52:28,780
I don't really know either, I've got to get going.

789
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:29,746
Hey, hey.

790
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:31,870
My legs are trembling.

791
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:35,405
Let's go together. 
I'll take you there.

792
00:52:35,405 --> 00:52:36,280
No, I will...

793
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:42,381
No, you two just enjoy the meal. 
He must just be outside somewhere close to the house.

794
00:52:42,381 --> 00:52:43,254
Oh, are you alright?

795
00:52:43,254 --> 00:52:46,164
Hey, so what's going on, huh?

796
00:52:55,369 --> 00:52:58,011
Let's sit down.

797
00:53:06,671 --> 00:53:10,933
Hey, don't you think we should call Joon Hyuk's friends first?

798
00:53:10,933 --> 00:53:12,992
Joon Hyuk is at home.

799
00:53:13,828 --> 00:53:15,038
What?

800
00:53:15,038 --> 00:53:18,722
If you want to get over Jin Ho, 
this is the best method!

801
00:53:19,475 --> 00:53:20,425
Hey, Young Sun...

802
00:53:20,425 --> 00:53:23,263
Kae In, let Mr. Choi and Jin Ho turn out well.

803
00:53:23,263 --> 00:53:26,897
If his mother accepts him for what he is, 
you will have it easier too!

804
00:53:29,667 --> 00:53:31,265
Kae In,

805
00:53:31,265 --> 00:53:34,056
it's time to draw a line.

806
00:53:34,056 --> 00:53:36,463
Let's just leave everything to them.

807
00:54:00,064 --> 00:54:02,324
I think...

808
00:54:02,324 --> 00:54:04,935
it was a mistake for me to come here.

809
00:54:06,382 --> 00:54:08,097
I apologize.

810
00:54:09,339 --> 00:54:13,008
I honestly didn't know you were coming today.

811
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:18,316
You have good friends indeed...

812
00:54:18,316 --> 00:54:22,734
but their acting skills leave much to be desired.

813
00:54:28,569 --> 00:54:32,463
For today, I'd better be leaving.

814
00:54:33,332 --> 00:54:35,733
Since you're here, you might as well eat.

815
00:54:35,733 --> 00:54:37,168
No.

816
00:54:37,168 --> 00:54:41,872
I do have great foresight.

817
00:54:41,872 --> 00:54:44,041
My dear Jin Ho...

818
00:54:48,688 --> 00:54:51,883
M-My dear Director Jeon...

819
00:54:51,883 --> 00:54:54,334
seeing you without prior notice,

820
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:57,721
I've neither the confidence nor the heart

821
00:54:57,721 --> 00:54:59,790
to have a face-to-face meal with you.

822
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:02,093
I don't have nerves of steel.

823
00:55:02,093 --> 00:55:04,094
I'm truly sorry.

824
00:55:05,729 --> 00:55:08,232
This is an embarrassing situation,

825
00:55:08,232 --> 00:55:09,664
so I wasn't able to hide my reactions.

826
00:55:09,664 --> 00:55:11,802
Don't worry.

827
00:55:11,802 --> 00:55:17,474
I truly admire your honesty...

828
00:55:19,408 --> 00:55:22,313
So, don't let it bother you.

829
00:56:04,102 --> 00:56:05,822
Well...

830
00:56:05,822 --> 00:56:07,724
We found Joon Hyuk.

831
00:56:07,724 --> 00:56:10,327
He was at his neighborhood friend's house.

832
00:56:10,327 --> 00:56:12,096
What a relief.

833
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:15,532
You said you'd even be prepared to marry me,

834
00:56:15,532 --> 00:56:17,468
but it looks like you got scared off.

835
00:56:19,076 --> 00:56:22,439
You got frightened like that. Isn't it pathetic?

836
00:56:23,107 --> 00:56:25,510
Jin Ho.

837
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:29,346
Did you hope that if you pushed me off 
to Director Choi, you'd have it easier?

838
00:56:31,448 --> 00:56:34,426
You know it wasn't like that.

839
00:56:34,426 --> 00:56:36,487
Either way, it's a relief.

840
00:56:36,487 --> 00:56:39,623
I thought you were a fool, 
but you know how to use your head.

841
00:56:41,301 --> 00:56:44,128
Why would you say something like that...

842
00:56:44,762 --> 00:56:47,431
This weekend, I'm moving out.

843
00:56:48,132 --> 00:56:50,401
I beg your pardon?

844
00:56:50,401 --> 00:56:53,804
Return my deposit to me 
when you have found a new tenant.

845
00:56:53,804 --> 00:56:55,840
Jin Ho!

846
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,508
Where are you going?

847
00:56:59,476 --> 00:57:00,650
I'm leaving.

848
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:01,579
Huh?

849
00:57:02,313 --> 00:57:04,481
Now?

850
00:57:04,481 --> 00:57:06,317
Right now?

851
00:57:07,518 --> 00:57:09,119
Yes.

852
00:57:27,238 --> 00:57:29,607
 Park Kae In's weather forecast... 

853
00:57:31,242 --> 00:57:33,611
 The friend I'd so longed for, and the warm spring breeze 

854
00:57:33,611 --> 00:57:37,808
 that brought him along, have both gone tonight. 

855
00:57:38,949 --> 00:57:41,452
 Now summer will soon be on its way, 

856
00:57:41,452 --> 00:57:44,855
 but even this summer looks like being bitterly cold, 

857
00:57:44,855 --> 00:57:47,892
 and I'll have to hunker down alone. 

858
00:57:51,328 --> 00:58:04,642


859
00:58:11,683 --> 00:58:13,750
Let's go out for lunch.

860
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:15,353
I'm not hungry. Go ahead without me.

861
00:58:15,353 --> 00:58:19,724
Hey you, yesterday and today you haven't left the office, let alone eat. What's wrong?

862
00:58:19,724 --> 00:58:21,125
Just go.

863
00:58:22,593 --> 00:58:24,595
You're not going out to eat?

864
00:58:45,049 --> 00:58:48,085
  Finding out that the friend she so trusted 

865
00:58:48,085 --> 00:58:52,322
 had in fact been lying all along, 

866
00:58:52,322 --> 00:58:55,426
 would have wounded her deeper still. 

867
00:58:55,426 --> 00:58:58,028
 Leave that house right now. 

868
00:58:58,028 --> 00:58:59,931
 If you're really her friend, 

869
00:58:59,931 --> 00:59:03,100
 make a clean break with her. 

870
00:59:03,968 --> 00:59:06,170
Are you satisfied?

871
00:59:08,206 --> 00:59:11,509
We can't even be friends... 
now that we are separated.

872
00:59:22,486 --> 00:59:24,855
I told you, I don't have any thoughts of food.

873
00:59:24,855 --> 00:59:27,658
Why do you not have thoughts of food?

874
00:59:30,995 --> 00:59:32,795
What do you want?

875
00:59:32,795 --> 00:59:35,832
Director Choi gave me two tickets to a musical.

876
00:59:35,832 --> 00:59:38,740
I don't have anyone to go with.

877
00:59:39,936 --> 00:59:41,575
Today...

878
00:59:41,575 --> 00:59:44,471
can't you come with me?

879
00:59:44,471 --> 00:59:45,599
I don't want to.

880
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,540
Kae In...

881
00:59:48,506 --> 00:59:51,385
received two tickets as well.

882
00:59:52,908 --> 00:59:56,836
Chang Ryul comes every day to the gallery

883
00:59:56,836 --> 01:00:00,700
to try to win Kae In's heart.

884
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:03,660
They're even going to see the musical today too.

885
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,691
They'll already be waiting to get in.

886
01:00:05,691 --> 01:00:07,965
That has nothing to do with me.

887
01:00:09,209 --> 01:00:10,959
Ah, but it does.

888
01:00:10,959 --> 01:00:12,448
Kae In...

889
01:00:12,448 --> 01:00:15,922
is going back to Chang Ryul.

890
01:00:15,922 --> 01:00:18,890
As her friend, don't you intend to help her out?

891
01:00:19,806 --> 01:00:24,804
Besides you, if Kae In had another good friend,

892
01:00:24,804 --> 01:00:27,851
then Kae In wouldn't need to depend on you any longer.

893
01:00:27,851 --> 01:00:32,188
She has Chang Ryul now to depend on and love.

894
01:00:40,464 --> 01:00:41,339
Kae In,

895
01:00:41,339 --> 01:00:43,466
I've been watching for a while,

896
01:00:43,466 --> 01:00:46,268
but of all the women who are here, you're the prettiest.

897
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:28,912
Kae In, where are you going?

898
01:02:37,305 --> 01:02:39,255
Jin Ho...

899
01:02:43,762 --> 01:02:44,594
Hey, Kae In!

900
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,843
What's wrong with you, huh?

901
01:02:46,843 --> 01:02:49,199
What's with you all of a sudden?

902
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:51,968
I can't do this anymore.

903
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:53,669
You can't do what anymore?

904
01:02:53,669 --> 01:02:56,490
I was just trying to get revenge on you.

905
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,442
The way you discarded me,

906
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:02,712
I wanted to do exactly the same to you.

907
01:03:06,619 --> 01:03:08,517
But...

908
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:11,787
I'm not going to do it anymore.

909
01:03:11,787 --> 01:03:14,724
I can't take it any further.

910
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:16,425
Okay, Kae In.

911
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:19,095
If you're sorry for me, then it's okay.

912
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:20,830
Even if you started out with that kind of feeling,

913
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:22,737
it's okay, I can change you.

914
01:03:22,737 --> 01:03:25,601
I have the ability to do that!

915
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:28,837
No.

916
01:03:28,837 --> 01:03:31,107
You don't have the ability to change me.

917
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:33,868
Kae In...

918
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:37,546
You don't know.

919
01:03:37,546 --> 01:03:40,283
My heart...

920
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:42,751
My heart....

921
01:03:42,751 --> 01:03:44,820
who it is...

922
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:47,724
that it's drawn to.

923
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:01,872
It's "Game Over."

924
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:17,653


925
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:26,695
