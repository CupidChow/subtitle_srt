1
00:00:01,445 --> 00:00:03,904
From what I can see, all your guilt and sorrow...

2
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:07,692
you have transferred them to your daughter.

3
00:00:13,862 --> 00:00:15,685
Such an arrogant jerk!

4
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:19,499
What do you know about my family? 
How dare you talk to me like that?

5
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:21,432
Get out!

6
00:00:23,127 --> 00:00:24,854
The reason you withdrew...

7
00:00:26,522 --> 00:00:29,164
it's because you failed designing Sang Go Jae, isn't it?

8
00:00:33,236 --> 00:00:35,042
It's the truth, isn't it?

9
00:00:38,526 --> 00:00:41,024
"Sang Go Jae is a place

10
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:44,237
where my wife and my daughter can dream."

11
00:00:44,808 --> 00:00:46,693
But unfortunately,

12
00:00:47,176 --> 00:00:49,357
you lost your wife in this place.

13
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,440
And your child got hurt as well.

14
00:00:53,908 --> 00:00:57,951
However, do you know what really made Sang Go Jae a failing design?

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,668
It's you yourself, Professor Park.

16
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,325
Because of your pain,

17
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:07,817
you neglected your daughter.

18
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,307
And left her with immeasurable amounts of pain. It's you, Professor.

19
00:01:10,408 --> 00:01:11,700
Stop it.

20
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,442
Who are you?

21
00:01:13,442 --> 00:01:16,316
How dare you talk to us as if you know anything about my family?

22
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:19,764
Exactly when are you going to have the confidence in front of your father?

23
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:22,842
When are you going to stop being your mother's murderer?

24
00:01:22,842 --> 00:01:24,675
No matter how I live,

25
00:01:24,675 --> 00:01:27,104
it's none of your business, right?

26
00:01:28,777 --> 00:01:31,127
Haven't you tried to take advantage of me like anybody else?

27
00:01:31,127 --> 00:01:33,217
Why are you pretending to be on my side?

28
00:01:37,867 --> 00:01:39,395
Just leave.

29
00:01:39,395 --> 00:01:40,827
Go!

30
00:01:40,827 --> 00:01:43,470
I can't bear to see your face!

31
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,677
Hurry and go.

32
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:55,316
Never again...

33
00:01:56,597 --> 00:02:00,018
Never show up around my house again.

34
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,185
Episode 16 
 Today's Weather Report 

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,403
Hey, is this all the furniture?

36
00:02:26,403 --> 00:02:29,332
Yeah. The big ones are in the warehouse.

37
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:30,467
When I finish up with them,

38
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:32,610
then I'll move them.

39
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,160
You're moving them by yourself?

40
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,220
I'll have to call someone.

41
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,200
If I can't do it on my own, I can call you. You're pretty strong.

42
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,167
Ah, I can't. I'll be busy tomorrow... 
Joon Hyuk needs to be vaccinated.

43
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:45,598
Then that's too bad.

44
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,453
Aigoo, our unnis.

45
00:02:47,453 --> 00:02:49,394
- You came? 
- You hungry?

46
00:02:49,394 --> 00:02:51,144
You didn't have to buy this.

47
00:02:51,144 --> 00:02:53,033
Wow, thank you.

48
00:02:53,033 --> 00:02:55,364
You don't have any special plans tomorrow, right?

49
00:02:55,364 --> 00:02:56,748
Tomorrow? Why?

50
00:02:56,748 --> 00:03:00,078
Well, you can help Kae In move her furniture.

51
00:03:00,078 --> 00:03:04,145
Oh, no!  Tomorrow's a little...

52
00:03:04,145 --> 00:03:07,267
- What? 
- That's fine. That's fine.

53
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:09,067
I'll just call some people to help.

54
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:11,133
You see...

55
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,667
As I was saying, you should call Jin Ho.

56
00:03:15,953 --> 00:03:18,992
Although he acts all high and mighty,

57
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:21,904
once he starts work, he is more hardworking than a slave!

58
00:03:22,013 --> 00:03:23,833
Yeah, that's a good idea.

59
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,122
It's really good. I like it.

60
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:29,400
Why don't you have some? Eat.

61
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,325
Oh yeah, when's your company's presentation?

62
00:03:40,325 --> 00:03:42,167
There's about 2 or 3 days left.

63
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:45,300
Aigoo, I'm so worried, I can't even sleep anymore.

64
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,333
We have to pay damages too.

65
00:03:48,718 --> 00:03:52,867
If we don't make it in this competition, we will go bankrupt for sure.

66
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:56,951
If he keeps getting misunderstood about stealing Professor Park's sketch,

67
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:59,733
there is a chance that his right to participate will be revoked.

68
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:03,112
What do we do? This is a big deal...

69
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:07,267
I just don't understand him.

70
00:04:07,267 --> 00:04:10,500
His expression is that he's grieving because of Kae in,

71
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,675
but he's just trying to end it with her. 
I just don't understand it.

72
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,667
I mean at these times, if Kae In were by his side,

73
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:20,166
she could be encouraging. How great would that be?

74
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:24,533
That's what I'm saying! I think Jin Ho's pride is too much.

75
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,936
What I see is... the company is having difficulties. 
That is why he doesn't want to be with Kae In.

76
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,333
That is also a possibility.

77
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:37,067
Well either way, being beside him, it's so frustrating.

78
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:40,807
That's what I'm saying. I don't know what to do anymore.

79
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,506
Kae In.

80
00:06:48,506 --> 00:06:50,200
Kae In.

81
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:55,667
Why are you sleeping right here?

82
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,633
Did you just see someone come in here?

83
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:02,000
Who?

84
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,467
No.

85
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:09,500
But...

86
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,200
what are you doing here?

87
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,733
Oh, while I was walking by, the light was turned on so brightly,

88
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:16,867
so I just stopped by to see if you were here.

89
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:19,267
But do you really still have a lot to do?

90
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:21,700
I'm gonna go.

91
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,667
Okay, I'll take you home. Let's go.

92
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:29,433
This... did you...

93
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:30,867
... put this on me?

94
00:07:31,121 --> 00:07:32,467
No.

95
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:38,291
Hurry up.

96
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,600
I said I'll just take a taxi.

97
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Kae In, do you know how dangerous it is for a girl to take a taxi home at night alone?

98
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,133
You just listen to me, can't you?

99
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:51,867
Hurry...

100
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:13,967
This is a newer concept of the Dam Arts Center Project.

101
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:15,133
Please have a look.

102
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:17,174
Yes.

103
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,900
What do you think?

104
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,200
Who is the designer?

105
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,633
It's M Construction's Jeon Jin Ho.

106
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:03,900
The work of the immoral architect who stole the plans.

107
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,000
How can he be a finalist?

108
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,862
Does this make sense? How can you let this happen?

109
00:09:08,862 --> 00:09:11,200
No matter what happened before.

110
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,500
But now,

111
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,800
there shouldn't be any problems.

112
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,367
And that company might be declaring bankruptcy anytime soon.

113
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:22,067
Whatever do you mean by that?

114
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:24,767
There was a problem with an earlier design.

115
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:27,092
And they are facing a lawsuit now.

116
00:09:27,092 --> 00:09:31,700
That's why they will have to pay a large sum as damages.

117
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,367
They won't be able to get that sum of money.

118
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,467
Is that true?

119
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,800
Until my father is done,

120
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,200
we shall wait in the room next door.

121
00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:56,200
Yes.

122
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:02,533
I'm actually unaware of this as well.

123
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:06,367
If it happens like that, Jeon Jin Ho's entry,

124
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:09,867
whether he qualifies to be in the finals, is still unconfirmed.

125
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:11,467
But then...

126
00:10:11,991 --> 00:10:16,405
Director Choi, as to why you are backing Jeon Jin Ho,

127
00:10:16,405 --> 00:10:18,100
I am curious.

128
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,733
If Director Jeon planned on imitating the Sang Go Jae's concept from the start,

129
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:24,100
if he planned to steal the blueprints,

130
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,533
he would never have devised this new design.

131
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,467
Looks like you really

132
00:10:30,467 --> 00:10:32,200
believe in him.

133
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,000
Although he had his own work ready,

134
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,267
he did not mention that to you at all.

135
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,967
Why is this?

136
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:44,267
What do you want... from me?

137
00:10:44,267 --> 00:10:45,933
What do you want... from me?

138
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:48,333
I hope you don't view Jeon Jin Ho's entry with prejudice.

139
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,800
I really hope so.

140
00:10:57,167 --> 00:10:59,133
No.

141
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:02,033
I apologize for asking a favor such as this.

142
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:05,900
Okay, then.

143
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,233
Another rejection?

144
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:11,233
No, I still have some places left.

145
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:12,667
Never mind.

146
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:16,667
A person as prideful as you, going this far is enough.

147
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,433
I know you'd rather die.

148
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:24,033
Don't be like that. Just swallow your pride this once

149
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:27,233
and borrow from Tae Hoon's father.

150
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:29,233
Alright?

151
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:36,967
Yes, Director Choi?

152
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:47,467
You came.

153
00:11:47,467 --> 00:11:49,500
Jin Ho, please introduce yourself.

154
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,633
This is one of my most senior and respected staff.

155
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:54,167
This person

156
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:58,433
will be of immense help to you. 
Please keep in contact with each other.

157
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,033
We'll see each other later.

158
00:12:03,267 --> 00:12:05,233
Have a seat.

159
00:12:10,467 --> 00:12:11,967
But then...

160
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,033
Why did you call me here?

161
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:18,533
When I returned to Korea, at my father's request

162
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:22,000
I began to receive a regular salary in my bank account.

163
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,500
I don't really spend much money,

164
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,567
and thanks to those people, 
it has become a large sum now.

165
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:32,767
So, I heard the news about your company.

166
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:35,333
I want to be of some help.

167
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,967
You don't have to do this.

168
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:38,800
Being a friend,

169
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,100
helping when you need help, isn't that what a friend is?

170
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,400
Being weak and only receiving help,

171
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,967
I don't think that's a friend.

172
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:49,667
You even admitted to the act of stealing another person's plans.

173
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:52,133
If you can't accept help,

174
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:53,733
I can't understand your response.

175
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:56,133
I can't understand your response.

176
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:59,033
You let other people misunderstand you, 
yet you still want to enter the finals.

177
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:03,333
Weren't you trying to prove your integrity to yourself?

178
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,900
If I pass like this,

179
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,167
I don't think I can maintain integrity.

180
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:12,667
I feel very thankful, but I have to go.

181
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,433
If it's like this,

182
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:22,100
I hope, more than anyone, 
that this competition will be fair and square.

183
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,500
But...

184
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,567
what I worry of is you being distracted

185
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:29,733
and not being able to showcase your talents.

186
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:35,300
If you are rejected this time too,

187
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,600
then I can't hold it in anymore.

188
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:43,633
Really?

189
00:13:43,633 --> 00:13:46,000
Are you really not going to accept my help?

190
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:57,867
You have passed the preliminary stages, 
but if you can't advance in the competition

191
00:13:57,867 --> 00:13:59,467
because of your inexperience and pride,

192
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:01,767
it would be too wasteful.

193
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:05,133
What...  do you mean?

194
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:07,533
Although it hasn't been announced yet,

195
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,667
it has been already been confirmed by the Committee.

196
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:13,567
Congratulations.

197
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:15,867
The preliminary competition...

198
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:17,767
You've passed.

199
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,500
Is this for real?

200
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,467
This is just the start. You're not going to give up, are you?

201
00:14:25,467 --> 00:14:27,933
Alright, right now...

202
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:31,067
your head must be frustrated with so many things going on.

203
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:34,000
Go inside and rest.

204
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,833
That's right,

205
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,100
you remember where we went fishing last time, right?

206
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,367
That seems good.

207
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,933
I'm not saying let's go together.

208
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:49,100
So there's no need to be so nervous.

209
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,267
Oh, right.

210
00:14:56,267 --> 00:15:00,100
Please inform the vacation home staff to thoroughly clean the house.

211
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,033
Are you going to the vacation home?

212
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:04,867
Director Jeon is going down there for a while.

213
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:15,233
You've worked hard.

214
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:16,933
Thank you.

215
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:18,867
Please, come in.

216
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,633
You've worked hard, Park Kae In.

217
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:29,500
It's better than what I thought.

218
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,233
Thank you.

219
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:34,167
Aigoo!

220
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:38,467
WOW! This is... amazing!

221
00:15:38,467 --> 00:15:41,933
This is all due to your good wishes!

222
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,633
Even a bouquet of flowers!

223
00:15:45,633 --> 00:15:50,400
It would have been nice if Jin Ho could 
come along and congratulate you too.

224
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:07,233
Dad.

225
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:21,267
I didn't do it because I wanted you to be sad.

226
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:26,167
You growing up without a mother,

227
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:29,233
I just... couldn't stand to watch it.

228
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,367
I...

229
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:37,000
...always thought you were angry at me.

230
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:43,100
Although I couldn't remember what I had done to my mother,

231
00:16:43,967 --> 00:16:49,100
I have always been aware of you being angry with me.

232
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,800
That's why I was always afraid.

233
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,933
So I was always trying to show you 
the good and talented side of me.

234
00:16:58,233 --> 00:17:02,200
Every time I did that, I always made a mistake.

235
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,667
I really...

236
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:08,433
must've been really selfish.

237
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,467
I always thought of my own feelings first.

238
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:17,133
What you were feeling...

239
00:17:17,133 --> 00:17:21,933
I never even once considered it.

240
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,500
I understand.

241
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:29,167
Mom...

242
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:33,933
You loved her so much.

243
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:40,600
You, too...

244
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,967
I loved you just like your mom.

245
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:54,467
Hiding your mom's picture, and blocking the basement...

246
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:01,100
it was so you couldn't remember anything.

247
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:07,833
It might seem like an excuse,

248
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:12,700
but getting angry at you for doing the same work your mom did...

249
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,033
It was painful for me to see

250
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:23,633
your hands getting hurt every time you worked.

251
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,100
Father...

252
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:42,933
Such small hands...

253
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,633
It seems like you've grown up so fast.

254
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:55,167
You did a good job.

255
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:02,400
Dad...

256
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:20,733


257
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:26,300
Then...

258
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:31,033
Let's not be like this.

259
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:33,866
Today's a happy day.

260
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,367
Let's go.

261
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:58,733
Dad, please go on in.  I'll go in soon.

262
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:28,833
Why are you always following me? 
And you keep hiding away from me.

263
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:32,600
I'm not hiding from you.

264
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,667
I know everything.

265
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:37,800
When I fell asleep while working,

266
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,800
the person who put the jacket over me,

267
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,033
it was you.

268
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:48,633
And you said you never followed me? Liar...

269
00:20:48,633 --> 00:20:53,700
From the moment we met until now, everything you said is a lie.

270
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:56,233
That's right.

271
00:20:57,267 --> 00:20:59,100
I lied about everything.

272
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,100
Then me being here,

273
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:07,233
think that it's a lie too.

274
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:14,333
I think it's best if we don't see each other,

275
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:17,800
Kae In, since you are here, 
I will go back home and pack my things.

276
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:22,700
Now,

277
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,767
there won't be any reason for us to meet.

278
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:46,467


279
00:21:56,137 --> 00:22:08,310


280
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:16,987
 Ah, don't lift that. 

281
00:22:16,987 --> 00:22:20,457
 When I moved in, because of that thing, 
I thought I was gonna have a heart attack. 

282
00:22:20,457 --> 00:22:21,760
 So, why are you making fun of my pride? 

283
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,614
 Ahh, so set that down. 

284
00:22:23,614 --> 00:22:25,103
 So what's with my pride? 

285
00:22:25,103 --> 00:22:27,432
 It's the best. 

286
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:46,031
 Father's hands are healing hands... 

287
00:22:46,902 --> 00:22:49,871
 Our baby's belly is sticking out. 

288
00:22:57,029 --> 00:22:58,936
 Why are you calling that thing Jin Ho? 

289
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:04,421
 Because you hit this, do you feel a lot better? 

290
00:23:42,526 --> 00:23:44,232
Congratulations, Miss Kae In.

291
00:23:44,232 --> 00:23:47,337
First you seemed so hesitant about it, 
but in the end it turned out very well.

292
00:23:47,337 --> 00:23:49,064
Thank you.

293
00:23:49,064 --> 00:23:51,964
For letting me test my skills.

294
00:23:53,153 --> 00:23:56,288
To be honest, in the beginning,

295
00:23:56,288 --> 00:23:58,442
I couldn't even imagine being successful.

296
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:02,186
- Have a seat. 
- Yeah.

297
00:24:07,551 --> 00:24:08,882
But...

298
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:11,739
Why don't I see Jeon Jin Ho?

299
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,493
We broke up.

300
00:24:16,493 --> 00:24:19,314
Him coming is even more awkward.

301
00:24:20,685 --> 00:24:24,330
Even then, you still waited?

302
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:30,930
If you've really decided to break up, then do it.

303
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,284
However,

304
00:24:32,284 --> 00:24:34,822
if you have even a little bit of feelings for him,

305
00:24:34,822 --> 00:24:37,522
I can help you just one time.

306
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:41,657
Right now, Jin Ho...

307
00:24:41,657 --> 00:24:44,383
is where my cabin is.

308
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:47,474
I told him so he could get some rest.

309
00:24:48,938 --> 00:24:50,504
You don't have to tell me things like that.

310
00:24:50,504 --> 00:24:53,535
You don't have to tell me things like that.

311
00:24:53,844 --> 00:24:57,061
Miss Kae In... you're quite a disappointment.

312
00:24:57,893 --> 00:25:03,154
When I first let Jeon Jin Ho go, I wasn't too depressed.

313
00:25:03,154 --> 00:25:05,734
It was because of you.

314
00:25:06,466 --> 00:25:08,572
If it was you,

315
00:25:08,572 --> 00:25:10,854
I thought you would love Jeon Jin Ho lots,

316
00:25:10,854 --> 00:25:12,447
and take care of him.

317
00:25:12,447 --> 00:25:14,694
And I thought you will have trust in him.

318
00:25:14,694 --> 00:25:15,418
Even if you say that,

319
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:19,213
it no longer matters.

320
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,339
To that person...

321
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:24,895
I am not the person he needs.

322
00:25:24,895 --> 00:25:28,069
Your faith in him must only be that much.

323
00:25:28,352 --> 00:25:30,223
I got it.

324
00:25:30,223 --> 00:25:32,474
If that is so,

325
00:25:32,474 --> 00:25:35,048
then I will no longer get involved with you two.

326
00:25:40,969 --> 00:25:42,233
Heh, brat.

327
00:25:42,233 --> 00:25:44,733
The way you eat your apple is still the same.

328
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:48,340
It's yummy to eat it like this, too.

329
00:25:49,585 --> 00:25:51,022
Then give me one too.

330
00:25:51,022 --> 00:25:52,284
Yes.

331
00:26:01,323 --> 00:26:03,086
This...

332
00:26:03,086 --> 00:26:04,533
What is it?

333
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:11,666
So that's how it was...

334
00:26:12,777 --> 00:26:14,619
That guy, Jeon Jin Ho...

335
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:18,354
No wonder his design stands out so.

336
00:26:19,469 --> 00:26:21,724
It was this apple.

337
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:27,633
Jin Ho's project concept...

338
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:30,291
wasn't Sang Go Jae...

339
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:32,531
but an apple?

340
00:26:32,531 --> 00:26:34,838
 Accept my apology. 

341
00:26:37,377 --> 00:26:40,400
No matter what his first intentions 
were for entering Sang Go Jae,

342
00:26:40,707 --> 00:26:44,869
In the end, while thinking of you, he drew a new sketch.

343
00:26:47,743 --> 00:26:49,333
Father,

344
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:51,869
I need to go somewhere.

345
00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:53,463
Where?

346
00:26:54,386 --> 00:26:58,191
I might be a bit late, so don't wait and just go to bed.

347
00:27:13,682 --> 00:27:17,067
At this rate, I was worried that you might jump into the lake.

348
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,367
What's your business here?

349
00:27:22,367 --> 00:27:26,267
There's a few documents I brought over for you.

350
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:30,909
I don't need the umbrella.

351
00:27:40,733 --> 00:27:45,264
Director, could you give me the address of your cabin?

352
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,600
What's wrong?

353
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,200
Are you okay?

354
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,867
Yes, I'm fine.

355
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:02,667
You have a high fever.

356
00:28:04,194 --> 00:28:06,200
It will get better in a bit.

357
00:28:07,098 --> 00:28:09,400
It's late, so could you please go?

358
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,567
How could I leave a sick person like this?

359
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:14,991
There isn't any fever suppressant medicine here either...

360
00:28:17,051 --> 00:28:19,033
Of course you would get sick,

361
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:23,267
you've had so much to deal with in the past.

362
00:28:24,104 --> 00:28:27,867
Just wait a moment, let me search around  
and see if there's any medicine.

363
00:28:27,867 --> 00:28:30,090
Kim In Hee,

364
00:28:31,967 --> 00:28:34,233
just go home.

365
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,533
Even if you're here beside me...

366
00:28:39,767 --> 00:28:43,267
I have no room to see you.

367
00:28:44,736 --> 00:28:47,167
Right now, me being sick...

368
00:28:47,167 --> 00:28:49,002
It might just be because

369
00:28:49,002 --> 00:28:53,867
no one can understand my heart now.

370
00:28:53,867 --> 00:28:56,067
So just go.

371
00:28:57,333 --> 00:29:00,133
I'm not saying to change your heart right now.

372
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:02,333
Even if it's 1 year or 2 years,

373
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:06,348
I can stay beside you making you worry and making you happy.

374
00:29:06,348 --> 00:29:08,202
If I keep doing that,

375
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:10,933
maybe you won't let me go.

376
00:29:10,933 --> 00:29:16,267
There might be a day I won't be here...

377
00:29:20,873 --> 00:29:23,127
Where are you going?

378
00:29:23,837 --> 00:29:26,733
I'll go sleep in the car.

379
00:29:41,367 --> 00:29:43,367
Did you come to meet Jin Ho?

380
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:46,133
You... Why are you here?

381
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:47,333
Why not?

382
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:50,867
While you were gone, I could have just come.

383
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,933
And you've broken up with Jin Ho anyway, right?

384
00:29:53,933 --> 00:29:56,467
Between me and Jin Ho,

385
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,500
there's no place for you.

386
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,600
I really hate you.

387
00:30:02,316 --> 00:30:05,833
The first time when I saw  your kind 
demeanor, I already hated you.

388
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:07,636
Tell me honestly...

389
00:30:07,636 --> 00:30:11,767
You didn't treat me as a friend initially, 
but as a pitiful insect.

390
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:13,244
Isn't that why you let me stay with you?

391
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:15,354
To me...

392
00:30:15,354 --> 00:30:17,400
you were family.

393
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:20,733
- Didn't you feel the same? 
- No.

394
00:30:20,733 --> 00:30:23,000
To just live in your house,

395
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:26,033
I merely pretended to be family.

396
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,300
Pretended to be family?

397
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,900
Although I thoroughly detest you,

398
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,495
to continue staying in your house, I had to pretend.

399
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,933
Whenever I got in trouble with my dad,

400
00:30:35,933 --> 00:30:38,567
you always helped me.

401
00:30:38,567 --> 00:30:40,667
You even said you'd find a picture of my mom!

402
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:43,900
You even went through trash cans!

403
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,867
That was you.

404
00:30:48,078 --> 00:30:50,700
Is that pretending to be family?

405
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,500
That's right.

406
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,933
I didn't do those things with heart.

407
00:30:55,933 --> 00:30:58,133
I really felt tiresome.

408
00:30:58,133 --> 00:31:00,200
Stop lying.

409
00:31:00,867 --> 00:31:03,200
Saying you didn't do it with your heart, 
isn't that even more tiresome?

410
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,100
It's not that I didn't have the heart.

411
00:31:05,898 --> 00:31:09,154
I really hate you. I hate you to death!

412
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:13,000
I don't have anything.

413
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,167
Even if I die, everything that I wanted, I couldn't have.

414
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,233
But why can you...

415
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:21,033
... have everything?

416
00:31:21,033 --> 00:31:23,234
I've never tried to have everything.

417
00:31:26,067 --> 00:31:28,500
You're such a fool.

418
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:31,233
You don't even know yourself...

419
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,833
how much you do  have.

420
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:08,033
Jin Ho.

421
00:32:26,867 --> 00:32:29,300
Jin Ho's very sick right now.

422
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:34,033
He's in his car.

423
00:32:34,033 --> 00:32:36,833
Where?  How sick?

424
00:32:38,267 --> 00:32:40,900
That, you need to see for yourself.

425
00:32:43,867 --> 00:32:46,300
Because he didn't want me to be with him,

426
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,667
he went to sleep in the car.

427
00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:51,433
He said he can't see me even though I'm right in front of him.

428
00:32:51,433 --> 00:32:53,643
He said he can't see me even though I'm right in front of him.

429
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:57,927
Seeing me as nothing...

430
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:02,063
it really hurts.

431
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,573
Jin Ho said that.

432
00:33:16,918 --> 00:33:23,997


433
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:31,068
Jin Ho!

434
00:33:31,068 --> 00:33:33,240
Jin Ho!

435
00:33:33,393 --> 00:33:35,091
Jin Ho!

436
00:33:35,091 --> 00:33:37,110
Jin Ho!

437
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,611
Jin Ho, wake up!

438
00:33:44,238 --> 00:33:46,932
Do you think you can walk?

439
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,808
Jin Ho...

440
00:34:09,808 --> 00:34:12,506
Are you back to your senses?

441
00:34:13,883 --> 00:34:15,328
Kae In?

442
00:34:17,048 --> 00:34:22,668
You are so sick. And yet you still slept in your car...

443
00:34:25,507 --> 00:34:27,440
Stop worrying and just go.

444
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,643
Who's worried?

445
00:34:37,162 --> 00:34:40,353
I'll be fine,

446
00:34:40,554 --> 00:34:42,312
so you should go.

447
00:34:42,905 --> 00:34:46,662
Can you be saying you're alright even though 
you're showing that you're not well?

448
00:34:46,662 --> 00:34:49,600
Your father may be worried.

449
00:34:50,977 --> 00:34:54,093
So go!

450
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:56,263
Who said I was going to sleep here?

451
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:58,478
Please turn over.

452
00:34:58,478 --> 00:35:00,797
I'll leave after applying the damp cloth.

453
00:35:08,087 --> 00:35:09,930
Go!

454
00:35:15,923 --> 00:35:17,995
I said go.

455
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,020
I got it.

456
00:35:22,485 --> 00:35:25,937
Your fever has probably gone down...

457
00:35:31,419 --> 00:35:33,852
Don't go.

458
00:35:35,045 --> 00:35:36,986
Let go of me.

459
00:35:41,476 --> 00:35:43,695
Don't go.

460
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:50,030
I just...

461
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,458
I want to trust you.

462
00:35:55,107 --> 00:36:00,862
100 times, 1000 times. Even if I'm made use of.

463
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,971
I just want to keep trusting you.

464
00:36:05,608 --> 00:36:08,542
Naive as I may be...

465
00:36:09,192 --> 00:36:13,558
Because that's the one specialty Park Kae In has.

466
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,018
Even if I become sad again...

467
00:36:28,779 --> 00:36:31,713
I just want to trust you.

468
00:36:33,429 --> 00:36:36,598
Because from now onwards,

469
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:40,020
I cannot be without you, Jin Ho.

470
00:40:15,552 --> 00:40:18,325
I know you're not sleeping.

471
00:40:21,743 --> 00:40:23,703
Didn't I tell you?

472
00:40:23,703 --> 00:40:27,102
You can't act.

473
00:40:28,263 --> 00:40:31,151
I don't know.

474
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:34,208
Come here.

475
00:40:36,607 --> 00:40:37,995
Stop it!

476
00:40:42,663 --> 00:40:44,108
Kae In...

477
00:40:44,522 --> 00:40:46,246
Thank you.

478
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:03,151
I have a wish.

479
00:41:03,613 --> 00:41:04,941
What is it?

480
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:12,072
Before I die, I want to invent a time machine.

481
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,839
What kind of silly wish is that?

482
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:20,967
By riding it, there's a moment I want to relive.

483
00:41:20,967 --> 00:41:23,501
When?

484
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:29,012
When you were five.

485
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:36,431
I want to go back then,

486
00:41:36,431 --> 00:41:40,580
and appear in front of you when you were 5.

487
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,830
And also...

488
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:46,671
tell you this while I hug you tightly...

489
00:41:49,928 --> 00:41:52,732
"It was just an accident.

490
00:41:53,538 --> 00:41:56,963
It wasn't your fault."

491
00:41:56,963 --> 00:41:59,297
Telling you like this...

492
00:41:59,297 --> 00:42:02,188
Do not hate yourself for being a fool from now on.

493
00:42:02,188 --> 00:42:04,663
I want to tell you not to do that.

494
00:42:13,961 --> 00:42:16,003
There's no need...

495
00:42:16,003 --> 00:42:18,750
for a time machine.

496
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:22,242
I met you, didn't I?

497
00:42:22,242 --> 00:42:24,227
I met you,

498
00:42:24,227 --> 00:42:27,579
and got to hear you say this.

499
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:39,017
You must meet my father and clarify yourself.

500
00:42:39,017 --> 00:42:40,271
Let's hurry in.

501
00:42:40,271 --> 00:42:42,547
Not just yet.

502
00:42:44,363 --> 00:42:46,953
What are you doing?

503
00:42:54,869 --> 00:42:58,650
If you've come, then you should go inside.

504
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:04,106
If you don't plan on clarifying, then I'll do the asking.

505
00:43:04,106 --> 00:43:08,263
The one who stole my blueprints, was it you?

506
00:43:09,263 --> 00:43:11,463
Yes.

507
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:13,542
Why is that something you did?

508
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:16,028
Sang Jun turned in something that was yours.

509
00:43:16,028 --> 00:43:17,491
Did you steal it?

510
00:43:17,491 --> 00:43:22,563
Whether it was someone I worked with, 
it's the same thing as it being me.

511
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:31,153
Was it true that you just used my daughter 
to come into Sang Go Jae?

512
00:43:31,153 --> 00:43:36,268
It is true that I came into Sang Go Jae 
initially to understand it totally.

513
00:43:36,268 --> 00:43:38,963
At that time, my company was in peril.

514
00:43:38,963 --> 00:43:42,797
To save my company and staff, I had to do it.

515
00:43:43,597 --> 00:43:45,259
However...

516
00:43:45,259 --> 00:43:48,629
from this moment on, I want to officially 
and openly be Kae In's man.

517
00:43:48,629 --> 00:43:50,330
This is how it is.

518
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:54,030
So is that why you sketched a new design?

519
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:56,630
To have a clear conscience against my daughter?

520
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,062
Yes.

521
00:43:59,597 --> 00:44:03,763
You are lucky, the plans were accepted by the Committee.

522
00:44:03,763 --> 00:44:05,763
You passed the Committee?

523
00:44:05,763 --> 00:44:07,697
But, why didn't you tell me?

524
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,330
I didn't want you to get disappointed later on.

525
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:14,397
I was going to tell you when I won the prize in primary screening.

526
00:44:14,397 --> 00:44:16,697
Didn't I tell you that I really hate it when you do that?

527
00:44:16,697 --> 00:44:18,730
I'm the only one who tells you every single thing.

528
00:44:19,763 --> 00:44:20,930
Sorry.

529
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:23,197
I can't do this yet for now.

530
00:44:23,197 --> 00:44:25,030
I really hate you.

531
00:44:28,663 --> 00:44:31,963
What do you like about my daughter?

532
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:34,730
Why?

533
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:36,763
Is it hard to answer?

534
00:44:36,763 --> 00:44:37,830
No.

535
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:44,730
I haven't really thought about a certain good thing about her.

536
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:48,930
I just followed my heart, which makes me love Kae In.

537
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:54,918
However, If you give me a chance,

538
00:44:54,918 --> 00:44:56,563
I will come up with the reason why I love her.

539
00:44:56,563 --> 00:44:58,130
Are you prepared?

540
00:44:58,130 --> 00:44:59,197
Yes?

541
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:01,930
I mean, are you prepared to stay up all night drinking with me.

542
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:05,997
You can't, father.Jin Ho's still in pain  
 from yesterday, so he has to rest.

543
00:45:05,997 --> 00:45:07,663
Are you already on his side?

544
00:45:08,563 --> 00:45:09,797
No.

545
00:45:09,797 --> 00:45:10,930
It's not like that...

546
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:13,530
I'll go out and buy some alcohol.

547
00:45:21,563 --> 00:45:23,530
For all your hard work, I have prepared some snacks.

548
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:24,963
I hope you like it.

549
00:45:25,397 --> 00:45:28,130
Kae In, when did you have the time to prepare all this?

550
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,797
I can do that whenever you need.

551
00:45:30,797 --> 00:45:31,863
Help yourself!

552
00:45:31,863 --> 00:45:32,863
- Yes, thank you. 
- We'll eat well.

553
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:35,330
Jin Ho, you have one, too.

554
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:41,897
Jang Mi...

555
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,463
My Jin Ho...

556
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:59,663
has already insisted on you.

557
00:45:59,663 --> 00:46:02,663
But I still can't bring myself to accept you, Park Kae In.

558
00:46:03,063 --> 00:46:04,197
Yes.

559
00:46:04,197 --> 00:46:05,663
I understand.

560
00:46:05,663 --> 00:46:11,530
My son is not kind of person who shows his feelings 
to others easily, even when he has a hard time.

561
00:46:12,297 --> 00:46:15,197
He is always tolerating everything by himself.

562
00:46:17,157 --> 00:46:18,830
As his mother,

563
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:22,397
I feel regretful that I can't do anything for him.

564
00:46:22,397 --> 00:46:25,763
But, Jin Ho loves you so much.

565
00:46:25,763 --> 00:46:29,930
When Jin Ho first came into my house, 
hearing his calls from you...

566
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:32,130
I envied him.

567
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:36,197
I was very touched with such 
a beautiful relationship you two have.

568
00:46:37,563 --> 00:46:38,597
I too...

569
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:43,530
would've done the same if my mother was still alive.

570
00:46:46,597 --> 00:46:48,897
Like Jin Ho...

571
00:46:48,897 --> 00:46:52,330
I want to be close with you.

572
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:56,130
Can't you make that happen?

573
00:46:58,497 --> 00:47:01,063
Please come over to my house.

574
00:47:01,063 --> 00:47:03,530
Let's have a meal together.

575
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:08,530
As everyone sees, the design of the exterior, 
is similar to our traditional Korean Han house.

576
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:12,130
Every section is linked together, 
yet they are independent of each other.

577
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:16,197
To remove the feel of being packed together,

578
00:47:16,197 --> 00:47:19,697
every section is like a small "village".

579
00:47:19,697 --> 00:47:22,297
We can link with each section easily.

580
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:25,897
Just like in the design of a aged tree,

581
00:47:25,897 --> 00:47:29,997
being able to spread upwards 
is like a person reaching out to the sky.

582
00:47:30,697 --> 00:47:34,063
Making use of louvre windows, sunlight will seep in.

583
00:47:34,663 --> 00:47:38,063
It will have an effect of an apple tree's fruits ripening, 
and dropping down on you.

584
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:41,197
In this section, there will be another building.

585
00:47:41,197 --> 00:47:46,797
Let us play, and appreciate the Arts together.

586
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:48,463
It's very fulfilling.

587
00:47:48,463 --> 00:47:52,030
Based on all the entries shown,

588
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:54,597
Mirae Construction's  The Sound of the Sky 

589
00:47:54,597 --> 00:47:59,763
and M Construction's  Apple Town  design, 
have both entered the final selections.

590
00:47:59,763 --> 00:48:05,797
Mirae Construction  The Sound of the Sky , 
has combined both traditional and modern effects,

591
00:48:05,797 --> 00:48:11,997
of design successfully. They have achieved 
the highest possible score.

592
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:17,197
For the M Construction's  Apple Town, 

593
00:48:17,197 --> 00:48:22,063
lots of consideration went into the "open" design.

594
00:48:22,063 --> 00:48:24,797
They have also achieved the highest possible scores.

595
00:48:24,997 --> 00:48:27,730
Director Choi will now make the keynote speech.

596
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:34,130
I shall reveal the outcome.

597
00:48:34,997 --> 00:48:37,830
The prize goes to...

598
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:40,963
M Construction's  Apple Town. 

599
00:48:46,968 --> 00:49:08,389


600
00:49:18,697 --> 00:49:21,530
While I was preparing for this...

601
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:23,197
I decided on one thing.

602
00:49:24,697 --> 00:49:27,263
To fight a proper and honest battle.

603
00:49:27,263 --> 00:49:29,997
And to properly and honestly give up.

604
00:49:38,897 --> 00:49:43,397
You can take my hands, which means 
just congratulations to you.

605
00:49:49,963 --> 00:49:52,930
I have done so many bad things,

606
00:49:54,163 --> 00:49:55,797
This time...

607
00:49:55,797 --> 00:49:57,730
it was really Jin Ho's win.

608
00:50:01,897 --> 00:50:03,730
It's okay if you laugh.

609
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:07,030
Sorry.

610
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:10,997
I said that I would give you up,

611
00:50:10,997 --> 00:50:13,397
but in reality, it seems I haven't.

612
00:50:14,314 --> 00:50:19,197
That guy... I really want to see him as a wicked person.

613
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:23,197
But this time, I really...

614
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:26,997
have to give you up.

615
00:50:46,697 --> 00:50:48,597
Congratulations!

616
00:50:49,363 --> 00:50:50,597
Thank you.

617
00:50:51,297 --> 00:50:52,397
Don't you know?

618
00:50:52,397 --> 00:50:55,897
My work is my apology for making you cry.

619
00:50:55,897 --> 00:50:56,997
I like it.

620
00:50:56,997 --> 00:50:59,263
Accepted.

621
00:51:00,563 --> 00:51:03,597
Today is truly a beautiful day.

622
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:09,597
Before Jeon Jin Ho's speech,

623
00:51:09,597 --> 00:51:12,197
shall we hear Park Kae In sing?

624
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:14,663
Sing a song!

625
00:51:15,397 --> 00:51:17,863
You guys... Why would you want to hear me sing?

626
00:51:17,863 --> 00:51:19,130
If you can't sing, then one-shot.

627
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:19,997
That's right, just one shot!

628
00:51:19,997 --> 00:51:20,997
Punish!! Drink!!

629
00:51:20,997 --> 00:51:22,330
All right! I'll drink, is that fine?

630
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:23,633
Wait a minute.

631
00:51:24,397 --> 00:51:26,297
Kae In, are you okay?

632
00:51:26,297 --> 00:51:28,963
I'm a good drinker. If not today, 
then when could I drink like that?

633
00:51:28,963 --> 00:51:29,797
I'll drink it all.

634
00:51:29,797 --> 00:51:30,997
Wait!

635
00:51:32,563 --> 00:51:34,963
Yeah, that's right. 
Now, let's break out the soju.

636
00:51:34,963 --> 00:51:36,068
Hyung! Don't!

637
00:51:36,068 --> 00:51:37,263
This person can't drink.

638
00:51:37,263 --> 00:51:39,430
What's wrong? I'm a great drinker.

639
00:51:53,163 --> 00:51:54,597
It's very late.

640
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:56,530
I apologize.

641
00:51:58,097 --> 00:51:58,951
Give her to me.

642
00:51:58,951 --> 00:52:00,797
I'll carry her.

643
00:52:00,797 --> 00:52:02,297
Just give her to me.

644
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:11,530
Are you okay?

645
00:52:12,497 --> 00:52:14,397
I am fine.

646
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:17,363
I think... I'll just carry her in.

647
00:52:36,797 --> 00:52:38,335
Can you see me...

648
00:52:38,335 --> 00:52:40,030
for a moment?

649
00:52:53,979 --> 00:52:56,597
I want to say thank you.

650
00:52:58,730 --> 00:52:59,663
No.

651
00:53:01,897 --> 00:53:03,543
30 years ago,

652
00:53:04,763 --> 00:53:07,530
when I was in charge of the Dam Arts Center,

653
00:53:09,163 --> 00:53:13,463
I built Sang Go Jae, incorporating 
some elements of the project to it.

654
00:53:15,097 --> 00:53:21,397
I was thinking that my wife could work while watching the child.

655
00:53:22,163 --> 00:53:23,730
However...

656
00:53:24,697 --> 00:53:31,063
my desire that my family has a happy time here,

657
00:53:32,097 --> 00:53:34,130
by my mistake,

658
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:36,997
was gone in an instant.

659
00:53:39,363 --> 00:53:43,197
So, I might have neglected Kae In for a long time.

660
00:53:46,763 --> 00:53:49,397
You must have had a hard time

661
00:53:49,397 --> 00:53:51,930
as much as Kae In did.

662
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:57,663
I feel like I'm confessing my sins at church.

663
00:53:58,563 --> 00:54:00,230
I am sorry.

664
00:54:02,763 --> 00:54:05,030
My daughter...

665
00:54:05,197 --> 00:54:07,063
I'm trusting you to take care of her.

666
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:14,197
I still have some unfinished business left. 
I'm going back to England.

667
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,942
If you ever...

668
00:54:19,942 --> 00:54:22,663
hurt Kae In...

669
00:54:22,663 --> 00:54:25,898
I'll bury you in this field myself!

670
00:54:25,898 --> 00:54:27,330
Yes.

671
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:31,997
I shall take good care of Kae In.

672
00:55:27,169 --> 00:55:30,038
I'm proposing to you now...

673
00:55:30,038 --> 00:55:32,419
Jin Ho...

674
00:55:33,334 --> 00:55:36,608
Oh!

675
00:55:36,608 --> 00:55:38,789
How could you let go of that?

676
00:55:40,557 --> 00:55:42,890
W-Why are you getting angry at me?

677
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:45,320
I'm going to go crazy...

678
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,678
Just get on for now.

679
00:55:46,678 --> 00:55:47,723
What?

680
00:55:47,723 --> 00:55:48,820
Where is it?

681
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,790
A little more to the right!!

682
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:51,723
Is it here?  Here?

683
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:52,712
To the right?

684
00:55:52,712 --> 00:55:54,907
A little back.

685
00:55:54,907 --> 00:55:55,790
Is it here?  Here?

686
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:56,866
To the left.  Left!

687
00:55:56,866 --> 00:55:58,228
To the left?

688
00:56:01,228 --> 00:56:02,247
I can't.

689
00:56:02,247 --> 00:56:03,449
A little higher!

690
00:56:03,449 --> 00:56:05,803
No! More forward!

691
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:08,203
Why would you hang a ring on this?!

692
00:56:08,203 --> 00:56:10,580
I wanted to propose to you in a creative way!

693
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:11,834
You could've just done it the old-fashioned way!

694
00:56:11,834 --> 00:56:13,140
Instead of putting it here...

695
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:13,924
Geez!

696
00:56:13,924 --> 00:56:14,995
I'm going to go crazy!

697
00:56:14,995 --> 00:56:15,805
Where is it?

698
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:16,667
To the left.  To the left. To the left.

699
00:56:19,723 --> 00:56:22,835
Oh! I got it! I got it!

700
00:56:26,463 --> 00:56:28,026
Congratulations.

701
00:56:28,026 --> 00:56:30,873
I heard you two were getting married.

702
00:56:30,873 --> 00:56:31,739
Thank you.

703
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,019
I received a lot of help from you,

704
00:56:36,019 --> 00:56:37,978
Director Choi.

705
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:40,590
No.

706
00:56:41,457 --> 00:56:43,623
You proved my faith in you.

707
00:56:43,623 --> 00:56:46,964
So I'm grateful to you, Director Jeon.

708
00:56:46,964 --> 00:56:48,897
But what will I do now?

709
00:56:48,897 --> 00:56:50,543
If you two get married,

710
00:56:50,543 --> 00:56:54,779
I'll have no one to play with, and become lonely.

711
00:56:56,842 --> 00:56:59,090
Then, if you think of us, just call us.

712
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:01,157
We'll come over.

713
00:57:01,157 --> 00:57:04,890
After meeting you and Park Kae In, I have learned a lot.

714
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:07,290
Like fighting the unfair world,

715
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:10,323
and being courageous.

716
00:57:12,564 --> 00:57:13,900
Be happy!

717
00:57:17,454 --> 00:57:19,987
Thank you.

718
00:57:40,441 --> 00:57:42,553
I heard you were going to China.

719
00:57:42,553 --> 00:57:46,158
Yeah. For a few years.

720
00:57:46,158 --> 00:57:48,352
Or I might not come back.

721
00:57:48,352 --> 00:57:50,442
Have a good trip.

722
00:57:50,442 --> 00:57:53,524
Thanks for transferring it to me.

723
00:57:53,524 --> 00:57:56,346
The construction is overwhelming to our company after all.

724
00:57:56,346 --> 00:57:59,428
You could have transferred it to others.

725
00:57:59,428 --> 00:58:01,190
Mirae Construction...

726
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:07,921
Your father has been chasing it his whole life.

727
00:58:13,277 --> 00:58:15,232
Do you remember?

728
00:58:15,232 --> 00:58:16,890
When we were really young,

729
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:19,882
we used to go camping together.

730
00:58:19,882 --> 00:58:22,090
My father and your father,

731
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:25,629
our whole family.

732
00:58:25,629 --> 00:58:28,215
I remember.

733
00:58:28,215 --> 00:58:30,423
I used to think that

734
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:33,730
I would grow up to be an Entomologist. (Insect scientist) 
I ran around catching insects.

735
00:58:34,776 --> 00:58:38,377
The insects we used to collect together,

736
00:58:38,377 --> 00:58:39,890
I still have them.

737
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:40,857
It's in my room.

738
00:58:43,123 --> 00:58:47,284
If it weren't for our fathers...

739
00:58:47,284 --> 00:58:51,390
we still would've been good friends.

740
00:58:52,723 --> 00:58:54,623
When you return from China,

741
00:58:54,623 --> 00:58:57,080
call me.

742
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,557
So then?

743
00:58:58,557 --> 00:59:00,423
You are planning to host me in your new house?

744
00:59:00,423 --> 00:59:01,557
That...

745
00:59:01,557 --> 00:59:03,588
seems a little difficult.

746
00:59:04,399 --> 00:59:06,023
My wife-to-be,

747
00:59:06,023 --> 00:59:09,556
she has a bit of problems with cooking.

748
00:59:10,857 --> 00:59:12,492
Jeon Jin Ho,

749
00:59:12,492 --> 00:59:15,709
congratulations on your marriage.

750
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,223
Look at this little one!

751
00:59:21,223 --> 00:59:25,090
The baby has all 10 fingers and toes.

752
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:26,557
It looks like me.

753
00:59:26,557 --> 00:59:27,748
Don't you think? You think it's a girl?

754
00:59:27,748 --> 00:59:28,532
I'm not quite sure.

755
00:59:28,532 --> 00:59:29,838
It could be a girl.

756
00:59:29,838 --> 00:59:32,090
What? What? What are you going to do about it?

757
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:32,890
Well...

758
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:34,017
Speak properly.

759
00:59:34,017 --> 00:59:38,540
I'm just saying that the baby will be very cute.

760
00:59:39,857 --> 00:59:43,082
Aigoo... I wish I was a daughter.

761
00:59:43,082 --> 00:59:43,990
Why?

762
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:45,616
Why you?

763
00:59:45,616 --> 00:59:48,310
Well...

764
00:59:50,161 --> 00:59:53,195
What is this?

765
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:57,684
Owww!

766
00:59:57,684 --> 00:59:58,690
Oh!

767
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:01,290
Honey! Why did you come so late?

768
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:04,215
Didn't I tell you that I was afraid to get the exam by myself?

769
01:00:04,215 --> 01:00:06,958
Sorry. I'm sorry.

770
01:00:06,958 --> 01:00:08,159
Are you finished?

771
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:11,346
Without you, how could I be done?

772
01:00:11,346 --> 01:00:14,951
You know that I wouldn't be able to do anything without you.

773
01:00:14,951 --> 01:00:18,325
I'll do it then.

774
01:00:28,957 --> 01:00:30,677
You saw him, right?

775
01:00:30,677 --> 01:00:33,054
You saw my husband getting all jealous.

776
01:00:33,054 --> 01:00:35,357
It was because of you.

777
01:00:35,357 --> 01:00:38,890
Although it may be okay for you, can I say the truth?

778
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:40,891
I'm very scared of that person.

779
01:00:40,891 --> 01:00:41,792
Why?

780
01:00:41,792 --> 01:00:43,895
He thinks you're gay.

781
01:00:43,895 --> 01:00:49,224
I even set you up on dates because of how thankful I am.

782
01:00:49,224 --> 01:00:52,463
Right! Date!

783
01:00:52,463 --> 01:00:53,482
Fighting!

784
01:00:53,482 --> 01:00:54,605
Darling,

785
01:00:54,605 --> 01:00:55,389
let's pick this.

786
01:00:55,389 --> 01:00:57,890
I think this one's the prettiest.

787
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:59,464
Okay.

788
01:00:59,464 --> 01:01:02,363
After a few days I'll add a game...

789
01:01:02,363 --> 01:01:04,035
You've gotten really cool, darling!

790
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:06,090
Of course.

791
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:07,723
Give me a present.

792
01:01:10,205 --> 01:01:10,779
One more.

793
01:01:10,779 --> 01:01:11,977
Uh uh!

794
01:01:11,977 --> 01:01:13,708
One more.

795
01:01:24,938 --> 01:01:26,762
Aigoo!

796
01:01:26,762 --> 01:01:29,557
Hello.

797
01:01:29,557 --> 01:01:31,757
How are you?

798
01:01:31,757 --> 01:01:33,554
What brings you here?

799
01:01:33,554 --> 01:01:34,572
I...

800
01:01:34,572 --> 01:01:35,957
have an appointment.

801
01:01:35,957 --> 01:01:38,057
I see...

802
01:01:39,723 --> 01:01:43,458
Bye.

803
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:50,690
You're not quite my style...

804
01:01:50,690 --> 01:01:52,701
But looking at a marriage point of view,

805
01:01:52,701 --> 01:01:54,623
we can discuss a few.

806
01:01:54,623 --> 01:01:57,357
You don't have to worry, the honeymoon is only for one day.

807
01:01:57,357 --> 01:01:58,490
But, I...

808
01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:01,090
I might be a little out of hand here...

809
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:03,229
I made a small little questionnaire.

810
01:02:03,229 --> 01:02:06,964
From the very beginning, I'd like you to answer honestly.

811
01:02:06,964 --> 01:02:08,427
What's your favorite color?

812
01:02:08,427 --> 01:02:09,890
Because I have been too busy lately,

813
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:12,215
I haven't found the time to date.

814
01:02:12,215 --> 01:02:13,690
Oh, I'm sorry.

815
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:17,152
Let me answer a call.

816
01:02:17,152 --> 01:02:18,537
Oh, right.

817
01:02:18,537 --> 01:02:21,023
Oh how much did the KOSPI raise?

818
01:02:21,023 --> 01:02:23,239
Oh, I didn't check that.

819
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,433
Let's talk about the household chores. Shall we split duties?

820
01:02:25,433 --> 01:02:27,418
 ­ 

821
01:02:27,418 --> 01:02:30,060
It might be better that way.

822
01:02:30,257 --> 01:02:31,262
Cheers!

823
01:02:37,057 --> 01:02:38,423
To tell you the truth,

824
01:02:38,423 --> 01:02:40,218
In Hee, a chic woman like you,

825
01:02:40,218 --> 01:02:41,557
guys that say they don't like you,

826
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:44,293
I really can't understand them.

827
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:47,088
Jin Ho's tastes are quite strange.

828
01:02:47,088 --> 01:02:50,145
Even when you look at me...

829
01:02:50,145 --> 01:02:52,157
you probably think I'll still lose to Kae In, right?

830
01:02:52,157 --> 01:02:54,623
I'm going to say this truthfully.

831
01:02:54,623 --> 01:02:57,090
To tell you the truth, In Hee...

832
01:02:57,090 --> 01:03:00,557
you're my ideal girl.

833
01:03:00,557 --> 01:03:03,423
Sang Jun...

834
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,617
Yes?

835
01:03:04,617 --> 01:03:07,390
You wanna date?

836
01:03:11,257 --> 01:03:13,942
Do you know?

837
01:03:13,942 --> 01:03:15,823
Sang Go Jae...

838
01:03:15,823 --> 01:03:19,490
was named by my mother.

839
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:25,390
The meaning is to be a place where we can be together, always.

840
01:03:25,723 --> 01:03:32,414
Let's live a happy and long life here.

841
01:03:32,723 --> 01:03:34,191
Of course.

842
01:03:35,968 --> 01:03:39,359
Including your parents.

843
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:41,257
All of us.

844
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:47,090
  Park Kae In's daily forecast for tomorrow. 

845
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:51,297
 Although it isn't a clear and sunny day always, 

846
01:03:51,297 --> 01:03:56,626
 when I walk a path in the dark starless night, 

847
01:03:56,626 --> 01:03:58,623
 if I have this man by my side, 

848
01:03:58,623 --> 01:03:59,892
 I think I'll have the courage to walk on... 

849
01:03:59,892 --> 01:04:03,549
 I think I'll have the courage to walk on... 

850
01:04:03,549 --> 01:04:06,945
  Jeon Jin Ho's daily forecast for tomorrow. 

851
01:04:06,945 --> 01:04:09,823
 I ran with all my might, 

852
01:04:09,823 --> 01:04:14,023
 but in the end, I have come back to my first dream. 

853
01:04:14,023 --> 01:04:16,479
 However, ever since meeting this woman... 

854
01:04:16,479 --> 01:04:19,957
 I know how to pause sometimes, 

855
01:04:19,957 --> 01:04:22,623
 knowing I can go farther. 

856
01:04:22,623 --> 01:04:25,723
 Now, I know.
