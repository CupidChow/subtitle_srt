1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,500
Before my mother's anger is appeased,

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,000
I have the confidence that I will still be with you.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,480
Why do you have to go to that extent?

4
00:00:13,251 --> 00:00:16,076
Because I want to be with you.

5
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:19,999
I want you...

6
00:00:20,252 --> 00:00:22,925
to be acknowledged as my woman.

7
00:00:30,127 --> 00:00:32,016
Thank you.

8
00:00:32,769 --> 00:00:36,287
At this moment, I am feeling grateful.

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,800
So I am thanking you.

10
00:01:05,318 --> 00:01:07,547
Hello, my name is Jeon Jin Ho.

11
00:01:07,547 --> 00:01:09,880
Hello, I am Park Kae In.

12
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,866
I hope you treat me well.

13
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:13,246
Yes, me too.

14
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:15,148
Please keep the bathroom clean!

15
00:01:15,148 --> 00:01:18,056
All this hair on the floor is yours, isn't it?

16
00:01:19,088 --> 00:01:20,351
Whoever sees it first, cleans it.

17
00:01:20,351 --> 00:01:23,137
But I think it's pretty clean!

18
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:31,418
Whoever uses the bathroom last, cleans it.

19
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:34,722
What are you doing?

20
00:01:35,855 --> 00:01:37,283
Can't see what I'm doing?

21
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:40,573
I was here first.

22
00:01:40,573 --> 00:01:43,487
If we do it together, then we can save time.

23
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:49,181
Then... Uhh... we might as well take a shower together too.

24
00:01:49,552 --> 00:01:51,458
Should we?

25
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:53,596
That's a good idea.

26
00:01:59,818 --> 00:02:01,798
Aigoo...

27
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:13,318
Jeez... why am I afraid of him?

28
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:15,643
Not even speaking to me politely...

29
00:02:15,643 --> 00:02:18,003
Just because I'm his girl now, I'm easy?

30
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:21,364
Did we sleep together? What did we do?

31
00:02:22,383 --> 00:02:24,281
That's right...

32
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:26,824
We did... kiss...

33
00:02:28,143 --> 00:02:32,462
Should I count that as sleeping together?

34
00:02:32,462 --> 00:02:34,373
Aigoo, I don't know.

35
00:02:43,938 --> 00:02:46,041
Jeon Jin Ho,

36
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,679
you have become braver!

37
00:02:57,353 --> 00:03:02,333
Episode 14
  Training My Woman 

38
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,933
I'm so full.

39
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:11,362
I ate well.

40
00:03:12,643 --> 00:03:14,823
Where are you going?

41
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:17,900
Sit down.

42
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,983
I'm done eating.

43
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:29,779
There's still some spicy paste left.

44
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,889
That trick won't work here.

45
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,042
I'll watch you until the end.

46
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:54,151
Nicely and cleanly, wash them well.

47
00:04:11,971 --> 00:04:12,777
What?

48
00:04:12,777 --> 00:04:13,966
What are you doing?

49
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:16,642
What do you mean? I'm getting ready to go to work.

50
00:04:16,642 --> 00:04:20,300
Oh, wow. You're so dedicated. 
Going to work on a Sunday.

51
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:22,860
Today's Sunday?

52
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,067
Love is only in your brain now!

53
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:27,666
You don't even know the time.

54
00:04:30,213 --> 00:04:32,033
That's not it. Where are you?

55
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:35,633
Where can I be... I'm buying the groceries.

56
00:04:36,252 --> 00:04:38,633
Hey, but are you that happy?

57
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:40,832
I'm happy, but...

58
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:43,400
Jin Ho has become weird lately.

59
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,704
He's using Banmal (informal speech) with me.

60
00:04:45,704 --> 00:04:47,067
He even made me do the dishes.

61
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:48,983
I feel like I'm getting married.

62
00:04:49,675 --> 00:04:51,333
Ahh, the answer's coming.

63
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,700
Answer?

64
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,233
What does that mean?

65
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:56,433
He's training you to be his woman.

66
00:04:57,367 --> 00:04:58,622
Training?

67
00:04:58,622 --> 00:05:00,067
Get your head straight.

68
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:03,167
If you back down now, you are finished for the rest of your life!

69
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:17,200
Can't back down!

70
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:21,667
What are you doing?

71
00:05:21,967 --> 00:05:24,067
You should bring out your blankets too.

72
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:26,167
I don't want to!

73
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:28,275
I have lots of things to do.

74
00:05:28,275 --> 00:05:30,434
Well then you can be like that...

75
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:31,601
But...

76
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:34,833
if you don't come out right now with your blankets, then you don't get lunch.

77
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:40,651
Wow, you're threatening me with food. 
You're so unfair.

78
00:05:40,651 --> 00:05:43,667
I'm going to eat some mixed noodles.

79
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:45,772
That must be good...

80
00:05:45,772 --> 00:05:47,267
No way, no way.

81
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:50,780
With lots of spicy paste, and sesame oil.

82
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,467
No, no way, never, never.

83
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:55,000
And with that I'm going to put some kimchi-

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,933
Radish kimchi!

85
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,849
Shake it well.

86
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:06,275
This is the first time you've shaken blankets, right?

87
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:07,733
No.

88
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:10,133
You have to do it with strength.

89
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:19,627
This feels so nice.

90
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:22,265
You should have cleaned it earlier.

91
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,121
Jin Ho, it's Sunday. What should we do?

92
00:06:37,121 --> 00:06:38,933
Do you want to go watch a movie?

93
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:41,596
Huuuh, I wonder...

94
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,384
I just want to stay at home with you.

95
00:07:04,606 --> 00:07:06,809
Jin Ho,

96
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:08,933
are you sleeping?

97
00:07:24,084 --> 00:07:27,911
Your eyelashes are longer than mine...

98
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,696
Jeon Jin Ho's forehead.

99
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:39,980
Jeon Jin Ho's nose.

100
00:07:40,603 --> 00:07:43,362
Jeon Jin Ho's lips.

101
00:07:51,714 --> 00:07:54,556
It's the face I see everyday...

102
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:57,429
But why do I feel so nervous?

103
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,524
 

104
00:08:27,776 --> 00:08:29,600
Jin Ho...

105
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,519
Really...

106
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,895
You aren't going to leave me

107
00:08:33,895 --> 00:08:36,900
and go anywhere, are you?

108
00:09:12,105 --> 00:09:15,013
You're not going to pick up my call?

109
00:09:17,138 --> 00:09:18,867
Thank you.

110
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:21,831
From now on in the semi-finals,

111
00:09:21,831 --> 00:09:25,083
please judge on the entries fair and square.

112
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:28,523
And please be cautious.

113
00:09:28,523 --> 00:09:31,383
Don't let the finalists names be leaked out.

114
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:33,291
Also,

115
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:36,321
I plan to allow a special judge for the finals.

116
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:40,103
I'm giving my opinion first to everyone here.

117
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,300
You must be really tired.

118
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,197
You even fell asleep.

119
00:10:13,424 --> 00:10:15,565
Did you get everything I told you to get?

120
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,039
Even if you're the boss, you can't just call once?

121
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,069
I'm pondering over the concept.

122
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:23,655
Great! How is it? Any progress?

123
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:24,743
Yeah.

124
00:10:24,743 --> 00:10:26,801
What is it?

125
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,733
Just a refreshing feeling?

126
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:34,267
Like the sky is refreshing.

127
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,888
Bye!

128
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:46,630
Jin Ho...

129
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,447
Jin Ho...

130
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:01,230
Jin Ho...

131
00:11:09,172 --> 00:11:11,763
What were you doing down there?

132
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,430
I heard a strange sound!

133
00:11:16,063 --> 00:11:17,830
What sound?

134
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,097
Rat!! I thought I heard a rat!

135
00:11:26,256 --> 00:11:27,630
What are you doing?

136
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,325
Rat!!

137
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:31,230
I'm terrified of rats!

138
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,240
Are you terrified of rats? Or do you like me too much?

139
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,550
I... I... I really hate rats!

140
00:11:42,263 --> 00:11:43,553
I'll allow myself to be lied to this once.

141
00:11:43,553 --> 00:11:45,363
It's the truth!

142
00:11:46,553 --> 00:11:48,763
In that case, don't go down there in the future.

143
00:11:48,763 --> 00:11:51,163
I'll buy some anti-pest poison tomorrow.

144
00:11:52,248 --> 00:11:55,363
No can do! Who knows when it might crawl up...

145
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:58,697
Must buy a cat now!

146
00:11:59,274 --> 00:12:00,963
Don't think there's a need to buy a cat.

147
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,605
Hand.

148
00:12:04,107 --> 00:12:05,165
Give me your hand.

149
00:12:05,463 --> 00:12:09,030
Wh-Why?! Why do you need to look at my hand?

150
00:12:09,802 --> 00:12:11,030
Look at those nails.

151
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,297
Look at this.

152
00:12:15,797 --> 00:12:17,697
When did you last cut your nails?

153
00:12:18,263 --> 00:12:19,430
I don't remember.

154
00:12:24,663 --> 00:12:25,830
Hey, you startled me.

155
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,030
You need to hold still.

156
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,297
Don't snip too much away!

157
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:32,881
I have to cut this much!

158
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,163
Hold on. Hold on.

159
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,830
Don't cut too much away...

160
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,830
Yes.

161
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,630
Son...

162
00:12:53,797 --> 00:12:54,963
Were you drinking?

163
00:12:56,597 --> 00:12:57,697
Jang Mi...

164
00:12:58,797 --> 00:12:59,963
Jang Mi...

165
00:13:15,263 --> 00:13:17,063
I need to go out.

166
00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:20,097
Alright.

167
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:31,163
I won't be too late. Don't worry.

168
00:13:32,797 --> 00:13:33,897
I'm going.

169
00:14:06,163 --> 00:14:07,797
This is the person you were looking for.

170
00:14:07,797 --> 00:14:11,430
He supervised the carpentry at Sang Go Jae.

171
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,697
Hello, sir.

172
00:14:12,697 --> 00:14:15,830
I brought you here at this late hour. My deep apologies.

173
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,863
That's fine.

174
00:14:16,863 --> 00:14:18,497
Please grant us this favor.

175
00:14:18,497 --> 00:14:19,463
Of course.

176
00:14:20,997 --> 00:14:23,663
I will explain to everyone based on this blueprint.

177
00:14:41,497 --> 00:14:44,097
Kim In Hee is here.

178
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:52,362
What brings you here?

179
00:14:52,362 --> 00:14:56,063
Working on a Sunday... it's so unlike you Chang Ryul.

180
00:14:58,563 --> 00:15:02,063
I'm very busy, just spit it out.

181
00:15:04,963 --> 00:15:07,963
The finalists results will be announced tomorrow.

182
00:15:07,963 --> 00:15:10,663
This is the names of the shortlisted finalists.

183
00:15:23,497 --> 00:15:25,063
Sorry. Don't need it.

184
00:15:33,844 --> 00:15:37,330
Are you really planning to compete with Jin Ho fair and square?

185
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,868
Why?

186
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,930
You think I will lose?

187
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,400
If you think too lowly of me, it was my mistake.

188
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:53,730
But, I'm not as weak as you think I am. 
I will let everyone know my real strength.

189
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,900
If that's the case...

190
00:15:58,563 --> 00:16:02,639
why didn't you show it to me earlier?

191
00:16:05,963 --> 00:16:09,197
Love is really almighty.

192
00:16:09,963 --> 00:16:12,797
Chang Ryul, you have changed so much.

193
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:14,930
Or...

194
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,730
you think you still owe a debt?

195
00:16:18,797 --> 00:16:19,763
Oh, right...

196
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,697
There will be another special judge for the finals.

197
00:16:24,863 --> 00:16:27,563
Aren't you curious who it is?

198
00:16:51,797 --> 00:16:53,030
 I don't like her. 

199
00:16:53,663 --> 00:16:58,197
 She has complicated relations with the Han family. 

200
00:16:58,197 --> 00:17:00,763
 She will not be my daughter-in-law even on my death-bed. 

201
00:17:22,263 --> 00:17:24,097
If it wasn't for me, I don't know what would have happened.

202
00:17:24,097 --> 00:17:26,630
Do you know how saddened your mother was?

203
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,363
She objects so much, but you still want to be together with that woman?

204
00:17:33,997 --> 00:17:35,897
You are going to find her again?!

205
00:17:40,063 --> 00:17:41,163
Jin Ho...

206
00:17:42,997 --> 00:17:45,430
Will you be alright?

207
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:50,063
I must have faith in you, right?

208
00:17:50,063 --> 00:17:52,297
Didn't you say...

209
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,630
I will be acknowledged as your woman by everyone?

210
00:18:39,563 --> 00:18:41,797
What do I have to do?

211
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:47,730
Why not try talking to Kae In, mother?

212
00:18:48,563 --> 00:18:55,397
 If she is still human, she will listen to you if you talk to her. 

213
00:19:14,497 --> 00:19:16,130
Did I wake you up?

214
00:19:16,897 --> 00:19:18,130
You okay?

215
00:19:20,497 --> 00:19:21,863
Err...

216
00:19:21,863 --> 00:19:26,530
Your mother saw us together... Is she angry? Did you get a scolding?

217
00:19:29,897 --> 00:19:31,730
Jin Ho...

218
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,463
Why don't I try talking to her?

219
00:19:34,463 --> 00:19:39,863
Once... or twice... It doesn't matter. Ten, twenty times.. I'll do it.

220
00:19:39,863 --> 00:19:41,197
Kae In...

221
00:19:42,863 --> 00:19:48,463
do you know the fastest way to undo a dead knot?

222
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,997
What way?

223
00:19:50,997 --> 00:19:52,997
Use scissors to cut it away.

224
00:19:53,997 --> 00:19:58,463
A string that's cut away can be restrung. There will be a gap in its place.

225
00:19:58,963 --> 00:20:00,130
That gap

226
00:20:00,963 --> 00:20:03,063
will never be filled.

227
00:20:04,363 --> 00:20:09,530
I hope that both of your hearts

228
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,463
will never have that hole.

229
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,663
And so,

230
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:20,530
even if it takes more time,

231
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,330
I will slowly undo the knot.

232
00:20:24,763 --> 00:20:26,597
I am sorry...

233
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,797
I said we would wait together...

234
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:31,863
But you,

235
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:36,397
you went to visit your mother. Is she better? I will wait...

236
00:20:42,163 --> 00:20:43,263
Kae In...

237
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:47,008
Yes.

238
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,797
Shall I sing for you?

239
00:20:52,963 --> 00:20:57,863
 Three bears, Living together 
(Gom Semari Ka, Han Jibe Itso) 

240
00:20:57,863 --> 00:21:01,063
 Father bear, Mother bear, Baby bear. 
(Appa gom, Omma gom, Aegi gom.) 

241
00:21:01,063 --> 00:21:06,630
 Father bear is very fat, 
(Appa gom eun tuntun ae,) 

242
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:11,063
 Mother bear is slim, 
(Omma gom eun nalshin ae,) 

243
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:15,330
 Baby bear is very cute, 
(Aegi gom eun nalmu-giyowuh,) 

244
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:19,997
 They live happily all under one roof. 
(U suk, u suk, Jal handa.) 

245
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,923
Sing more!

246
00:21:26,923 --> 00:21:28,459
More?

247
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:29,730
Yes.

248
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,447
You woke me up!

249
00:21:32,447 --> 00:21:35,007
Now you must sing til I fall asleep.

250
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:38,298
I can't really sing...

251
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:19,194
♫  Watching you from behind as you leave, 

252
00:22:19,194 --> 00:22:25,284
♫  I pray you will not cry because of me. 

253
00:22:25,284 --> 00:22:32,516
♫  Seeing the tears that flowed from you, I can't bear to leave. 

254
00:22:32,516 --> 00:22:38,132
♫  I won't let you go. 

255
00:22:38,132 --> 00:22:45,172
♫  The rain falls endlessly, It's all right. 

256
00:22:45,172 --> 00:22:52,042
♫  Can't see the tears, It's all right. 

257
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:59,914
♫  It's all right, 
I won't hold you back as you leave. 

258
00:22:59,914 --> 00:23:05,208
♫  All the painful and hurtful memories in your heart, 

259
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:08,861
♫  Will be washed away by the rain. 

260
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:15,448
♫  Your inner heart is crying, 

261
00:23:15,448 --> 00:23:20,916
♫  That's why it's raining. 

262
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,678
 ­ 

263
00:23:27,678 --> 00:23:30,059
You slept well?

264
00:23:30,973 --> 00:23:34,223
You know how long I sang last night?

265
00:23:35,048 --> 00:23:37,383
You fell asleep and you didn't say anything!

266
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:41,679
How can I say anything when I'm asleep...?

267
00:23:41,902 --> 00:23:43,668
Oh yeah...

268
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:52,978
Argh... I wanted to take the bus...

269
00:23:52,978 --> 00:23:57,248
If I had taken the bus, I would have reached the office by now.

270
00:23:57,248 --> 00:24:00,248
I'm treating you well, and you aren't thankful.

271
00:24:00,248 --> 00:24:03,230
I'm late as well because of who?

272
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,890
Feels like I should apologize now.

273
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,631
Feels like I should apologize now.

274
00:24:06,631 --> 00:24:09,769
If you are feeling thankful, then say "Thank you".

275
00:24:10,062 --> 00:24:11,167
Ah! Right!

276
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:13,714
You know what I found yesterday?

277
00:24:13,714 --> 00:24:15,438
Tada!

278
00:24:15,438 --> 00:24:16,745
You remember this?

279
00:24:16,745 --> 00:24:18,390
Where's your handphone?

280
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,444
Ah, no way!

281
00:24:19,444 --> 00:24:21,264
Where is it?

282
00:24:21,264 --> 00:24:22,623
Isn't it here?

283
00:24:22,623 --> 00:24:24,651
It's here!

284
00:24:24,651 --> 00:24:26,819
Just like a child... Tsk.

285
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:28,400
This proves that you are my man!

286
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,993
You can't tear it away!

287
00:24:29,993 --> 00:24:31,169
What if it gets dirty?

288
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:34,372
No to that too!

289
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:40,981
That rascal! First time he's so late...

290
00:24:41,692 --> 00:24:45,484
Looking at the situation now...

291
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,818
I think we will do fine.

292
00:24:50,264 --> 00:24:52,867
What are you watching?

293
00:24:53,147 --> 00:24:55,027
You downloaded it?

294
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:56,957
It's Hye Mi.

295
00:24:56,957 --> 00:24:58,890
Looks good!

296
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,623
What good?!

297
00:25:02,257 --> 00:25:04,590
Hey! Jin Ho, you...

298
00:25:05,057 --> 00:25:07,990
Err...

299
00:25:10,523 --> 00:25:15,457
Because of Park Kae In, our Jin Ho...

300
00:25:15,457 --> 00:25:17,257
is in a very bad spot now. Is that for real?

301
00:25:17,257 --> 00:25:19,057
Err this...

302
00:25:19,057 --> 00:25:21,423
I want the truth.

303
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,257
Yes.

304
00:25:28,857 --> 00:25:33,290
Don't tell Jin Ho we met.

305
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:38,357
Is Park Kae In working at the Dam Art Gallery?

306
00:25:38,357 --> 00:25:40,123
Ah... Mother... Wait!

307
00:25:40,657 --> 00:25:41,990
Please wait.

308
00:25:48,123 --> 00:25:53,523
You see, mother, Kae In is very important for our concept in this project.

309
00:25:53,523 --> 00:25:55,257
If it's that important,

310
00:25:55,257 --> 00:25:56,790
why is she hindering our Jin Ho's future?

311
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,857
Err that... that...

312
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,790
It's because things became complicated.

313
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,790
But at this time,

314
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,257
if Jin Ho and Kae In's relationship becomes strained,

315
00:26:06,457 --> 00:26:08,457
then it will become more difficult for me.

316
00:26:08,457 --> 00:26:09,557
Then...

317
00:26:09,557 --> 00:26:11,990
the future of Jin Ho lies in Park Kae In's hands?

318
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:14,123
No no, it's not like that.

319
00:26:14,123 --> 00:26:16,057
How should I say it...

320
00:26:16,057 --> 00:26:18,857
For further details, I'll tell you in the future.

321
00:26:18,857 --> 00:26:21,957
Just wait til this present project's results is announced. Please. Okay?

322
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:23,457
Just a little longer please.

323
00:26:24,923 --> 00:26:26,423
I'm begging you.

324
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:49,590
Every minor thing, you wouldn't miss out?

325
00:26:55,057 --> 00:26:56,457
That's right.

326
00:26:57,057 --> 00:27:00,390
The you who calculates love

327
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,657
will think this is very minor.

328
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:15,290
Love might be like this...  But what about marriage?

329
00:27:15,723 --> 00:27:19,723
Does Jin Ho's mother like you?

330
00:27:24,657 --> 00:27:25,990
So?

331
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:30,390
Oh yeah, who wouldn't like Park Kae In?

332
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:34,257
Just because you are treated a little better, you think you are loved?

333
00:27:34,257 --> 00:27:36,257
But what if...

334
00:27:36,257 --> 00:27:40,523
Jeon Jin Ho doesn't really love you?

335
00:27:40,523 --> 00:27:42,457
He said he was gay,

336
00:27:42,457 --> 00:27:45,790
and made use of Director Choi's feelings.

337
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,190
Hasn't it crossed your mind you migh be used too?

338
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:52,923
Why would Jin Ho make use of me?

339
00:27:52,923 --> 00:27:54,590
There is no reason to.

340
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:58,457
Because I think there is no reason for him to like you.

341
00:27:58,457 --> 00:28:01,257
It doesn't bother me.

342
00:28:01,257 --> 00:28:02,857
Doesn't bother you?

343
00:28:02,857 --> 00:28:04,790
In Hee...

344
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:11,457
I used to...

345
00:28:11,457 --> 00:28:14,557
envy you, my friend.

346
00:28:14,557 --> 00:28:16,490
You are very confident...

347
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:20,923
Loving yourself more than others do.

348
00:28:20,923 --> 00:28:24,323
But now,

349
00:28:24,323 --> 00:28:28,057
look at you.

350
00:28:28,057 --> 00:28:31,657
Causing hurt to people...

351
00:28:31,657 --> 00:28:35,423
Without batting an eyelid.

352
00:28:37,057 --> 00:28:38,390
I feel that's not right...

353
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,123
Park Kae In...

354
00:28:40,123 --> 00:28:42,657
are you lecturing me now?

355
00:28:42,657 --> 00:28:46,223
You can't even solve your personal problems.

356
00:28:48,857 --> 00:28:50,590
You...

357
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:56,823
You will regret what you just said in the future.

358
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,657
It's not a lecture.

359
00:29:01,357 --> 00:29:06,623
It's my last... real feelings.

360
00:29:06,623 --> 00:29:09,657
If you continue like this,

361
00:29:09,657 --> 00:29:13,923
in the end you will have no one beside you.

362
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:24,390


363
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,490
Where did you go early in the morning?

364
00:29:32,557 --> 00:29:36,690
 Please don't tell him we met. 

365
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:40,990
Err, I was having a little toilet trouble.

366
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:43,923
You say you were in the toilet til now?

367
00:29:43,923 --> 00:29:46,223
Yeah...

368
00:29:46,223 --> 00:29:49,557
Err this... I have carefully looked through the plans.

369
00:29:49,557 --> 00:29:52,057
Err this... I have carefully looked through the plans.

370
00:29:52,623 --> 00:29:57,589
But I still don't understand what does Director Choi sees in Sang Go Jae.

371
00:30:08,123 --> 00:30:11,623
Sang Go Jae is but a small portion of his interest.

372
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:14,823
What do you mean by that?

373
00:30:14,823 --> 00:30:15,890
Huh?

374
00:30:16,623 --> 00:30:19,757
I mean, this is my analysis of the concept.

375
00:30:19,757 --> 00:30:22,490
What is your basis of the concept then?

376
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,823
I'll tell it to you in time.

377
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:27,757
As I said, just when will you tell it to me?

378
00:30:27,757 --> 00:30:31,923
In not much time, the selection will be over.

379
00:30:35,623 --> 00:30:37,690
Maybe...

380
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:40,957
your mind is in a mess right now.

381
00:30:40,957 --> 00:30:44,290
This is the first time i'm seeing your table messed up.

382
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,757
You learned from Kae In?

383
00:30:50,423 --> 00:30:52,757
That Kae In...

384
00:30:52,757 --> 00:30:57,390
You must teach her cooking, laundry, etc.

385
00:30:58,457 --> 00:31:01,757
Then only can you change your mother's mind.

386
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:17,757
I heard from Secretary Jin. You have been working OT since last week?

387
00:31:17,757 --> 00:31:18,323
Yes.

388
00:31:18,323 --> 00:31:21,923
You are turning into a real career-man now!

389
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:25,190
Is Park Kae In the cause of the change?

390
00:31:26,223 --> 00:31:29,890
As I said, a man must find the right woman!

391
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,957
Things going fine with Kae In?

392
00:31:33,823 --> 00:31:36,080
Oh yes, Professor Park...

393
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,957
has confirmed his return to the country.

394
00:31:37,957 --> 00:31:41,557
You have to be there at his arrival. Get prepared for it.

395
00:31:41,557 --> 00:31:43,490
Yes.

396
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:47,223
Looks like things will get more interesting from now on.

397
00:31:54,957 --> 00:31:56,890
Please call...

398
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,223
Call me Jeon Jin Ho...

399
00:31:59,223 --> 00:32:01,690
Call me please! Call!

400
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:04,257
Through telepathy...

401
00:32:14,659 --> 00:32:16,621
What's this?

402
00:32:16,621 --> 00:32:18,999
I'm starting to hallucinate.

403
00:32:26,417 --> 00:32:28,177
You came because you missed me?

404
00:32:28,177 --> 00:32:30,617
Do you think I have nothing to do?

405
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:42,350
 ­ 

406
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:07,203
Why are those two together?

407
00:33:07,203 --> 00:33:08,717
Don't worry about it.

408
00:33:08,717 --> 00:33:12,583
I'll resolve the Kae In conundrum by myself.

409
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:15,983
Don't disappoint me.

410
00:33:15,983 --> 00:33:20,622
If you're talking about disappointment, 
Jeon Jin Ho will be the one being disappointed.

411
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:26,350
Aigo... Director Choi, how have you been?

412
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,083
How are you here personally?

413
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:32,573
Although we don't have much of an interest in arts,

414
00:33:32,573 --> 00:33:36,117
this is the a new beginning for the Dam Arts Center.

415
00:33:36,117 --> 00:33:38,803
How could I miss it?

416
00:33:39,348 --> 00:33:42,016
I see. Thank you for being here.

417
00:33:42,016 --> 00:33:44,172
What thanks?

418
00:33:44,172 --> 00:33:49,769
But I say... Do you have any news of Professor Park Chul Han?

419
00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:52,950
He will attend my son's wedding.

420
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:56,801
For this reason, he will return to the country a bit earlier.

421
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:59,383
We are really thankful!

422
00:33:59,383 --> 00:34:00,994
Yes, I see.

423
00:34:00,994 --> 00:34:02,736
Ambition is ambition.

424
00:34:02,736 --> 00:34:05,944
We hope that we can win.

425
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:07,556
It's just the judgment...

426
00:34:07,556 --> 00:34:09,250
Don't be too suspicious.

427
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,083
I have other matters to attend to.

428
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,886
Ah, yes.

429
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,983
You are so smug only because of your father!

430
00:34:18,983 --> 00:34:21,750
When this project is finished,

431
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:24,073
watch out!

432
00:34:25,883 --> 00:34:27,966
Looks like you are winning.

433
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:35,417
The special judge is Park Kae In's father, Professor Park.

434
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:39,162
If he was to know his daughter has been made use of...

435
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:40,739
what would happen?

436
00:34:56,749 --> 00:34:59,574
You must head inside soon?

437
00:35:05,634 --> 00:35:09,417
Everyone must be waiting now...

438
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,917
Um, Jin Ho...

439
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,554
Don't turn back and regret,

440
00:35:20,554 --> 00:35:22,650
take a good look now.

441
00:35:23,883 --> 00:35:26,350
Aren't we seeing each other at home in a few hours time?

442
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:30,068
Go quickly! Before I drag you back...

443
00:35:30,068 --> 00:35:31,857
Why don't you?

444
00:35:32,517 --> 00:35:35,917
What's wrong? You seem like you are going to a faraway place.

445
00:35:38,283 --> 00:35:41,508
It seems I might not be able to return home for a period.

446
00:35:41,508 --> 00:35:45,917
Even so, we still can meet up if we miss each other, right?

447
00:35:45,917 --> 00:35:48,317
I'll be very busy...

448
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:52,917
You won't even have time to meet for a short while?

449
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:10,050
My hair's messed up!

450
00:36:13,683 --> 00:36:15,899
You're just going?

451
00:36:18,017 --> 00:36:20,150
Hey, Park Kae In!

452
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,817
You'll die horribly if you sneak a peek at other men 
while my back is turned!

453
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:37,283
How can I use an eye and peek? "Hey, Park Kae In"?!

454
00:36:37,283 --> 00:36:39,753
So directly and informally!

455
00:36:39,753 --> 00:36:45,283
If you said, "If you peeked at other men with one eye, you might die.." It will be strange...

456
00:36:49,784 --> 00:36:51,350
There's something missing...

457
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,650
Why isn't he back?

458
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:00,860
How was it? Are we in the shortlist?

459
00:37:01,713 --> 00:37:03,502
Yeah.

460
00:37:08,683 --> 00:37:11,217
"You" are our lifeline now...

461
00:37:12,283 --> 00:37:13,861
Time to start waging the war, yeah?

462
00:37:13,861 --> 00:37:15,750
Of course we've got to stay sharp from now on.

463
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:16,683
Hyung!

464
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:19,459
Hyung, look at this.

465
00:37:23,526 --> 00:37:26,550
 

466
00:37:27,983 --> 00:37:29,773
What's that?

467
00:37:31,117 --> 00:37:32,830
What do we do?

468
00:37:38,483 --> 00:37:42,914
Jeon Jin Ho is finally being evicted from his office.

469
00:37:42,914 --> 00:37:44,817
Really?

470
00:37:44,817 --> 00:37:49,217
Jeon Jin  Ho, what kind of brilliant design masterpiece will you come up with this time?

471
00:37:49,217 --> 00:37:51,617
Shall I anticipate it?

472
00:37:51,617 --> 00:37:53,650
The Director is here.

473
00:38:03,583 --> 00:38:07,683
Everyone, the real battle starts now.

474
00:38:07,683 --> 00:38:14,483
Winner takes all. From now on, I won't start a fight where I'd lose.

475
00:38:21,736 --> 00:38:23,350
What's with you guys?

476
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:27,583
Don't you guys remember we started out with basically nothing too?

477
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:29,806
We are better than that.

478
00:38:29,806 --> 00:38:32,550
We should be on our way up, not down.

479
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:37,717
This is life, there are up and downs. We can pick ourselves up again.

480
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,417
I'm feeling good today.

481
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:43,095
To celebrate our "moving in" today, 
I'll treat you guys to ribeye steak tonight.

482
00:38:43,095 --> 00:38:45,281
I'm not interested in ribeye steaks.

483
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:48,398
Save that money, and use it for a better office.

484
00:38:48,398 --> 00:38:49,530
Hey, punk.

485
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:51,217
I still have the money to buy you ribeye steak.

486
00:38:51,217 --> 00:38:54,806
Don't talk nonsense. Just tidy the place up.

487
00:38:59,783 --> 00:39:02,317
You've done a lot of hard work.

488
00:39:02,317 --> 00:39:05,217
It was probably really hard to rent a place like this too.

489
00:39:06,417 --> 00:39:08,839
Hyung, let's tough it out for a while more.

490
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:12,064
I will bring a satisfactory result for us in the Dam Arts Center project.

491
00:39:12,064 --> 00:39:15,083
Hey, although the place is small, there's a good "feel" to it!

492
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:18,783
It should be like this... Rowdy and noisy.

493
00:39:18,783 --> 00:39:19,717
Right?

494
00:39:19,717 --> 00:39:21,860
We usually rub shoulders everyday.

495
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,654
Are you gonna use your mouth to help?

496
00:39:23,654 --> 00:39:25,017
Not allowed to?

497
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:32,883
Errr, I have considered it...

498
00:39:32,883 --> 00:39:34,583
How about I make supper for you guys tomorrow?

499
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:37,090
Park Kae In's Special fist rice balls.

500
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:39,128
I have confidence I can make that well.

501
00:39:39,128 --> 00:39:42,471
You can't even bear with it for a few days?

502
00:39:42,471 --> 00:39:45,997
I am  not going there because I miss you.

503
00:39:45,997 --> 00:39:48,427
I wanted to cheer you on.

504
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:51,950
And cheer on the rest of your co-workers too.

505
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,788
It would cheer me on for you to not come here.

506
00:39:54,788 --> 00:39:56,417
Ah, why?

507
00:39:57,387 --> 00:40:02,483
When I see your face, I don't think I can do my work.

508
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:05,583
If I see you, I'll want to be with you.

509
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:09,756
And when I am with you, 
I don't think I'll want to let you go.

510
00:40:09,756 --> 00:40:14,758
Jeez... Really... Am I that good?

511
00:40:14,758 --> 00:40:18,773
Okay, I got it... Then, you'd better dream about me while you sleep.

512
00:40:18,773 --> 00:40:20,817
Don't even think of entering my dreams!

513
00:40:20,817 --> 00:40:26,150
While I am working, Park Kae In, your name...

514
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:28,083
and your face...

515
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:30,350
they will be completely erased from my mind.

516
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:34,083
Jin Ho, you are really too much!

517
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:40,217
But I'll always keep you in my heart.

518
00:40:41,938 --> 00:40:44,817
You must work hard, Jin Ho.

519
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,719
Why don't you eat the pickled radish?

520
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:39,908
I don't eat those.

521
00:41:42,269 --> 00:41:44,885
Where did Jin Ho go?

522
00:41:45,722 --> 00:41:48,621
You think he's out eating something delicious by himself?

523
00:41:48,621 --> 00:41:50,257
Yes, Sir.

524
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:53,153
I spoke to you before about the pressured strong glass.

525
00:41:53,153 --> 00:41:55,883
When can you finish it?

526
00:41:56,823 --> 00:41:58,129
Is that so?

527
00:41:58,926 --> 00:42:00,715
I am counting on you then.

528
00:42:00,968 --> 00:42:02,152
Yes.

529
00:42:42,869 --> 00:42:46,247
My house is really big...

530
00:43:22,276 --> 00:43:23,725
Are you finished?

531
00:43:24,361 --> 00:43:25,802
Take a look.

532
00:43:26,316 --> 00:43:27,988
We done for the day?

533
00:43:27,988 --> 00:43:29,912
You are still thinking of the end of the day?

534
00:43:29,912 --> 00:43:32,237
This is the beginning now.

535
00:43:32,237 --> 00:43:33,861
Just after one night...

536
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,407
It feels like it's been a hundred years since I seen Hye Mi.

537
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:38,867
Well,

538
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:41,149
I think someone else is in that situation too.

539
00:43:41,149 --> 00:43:45,446
Last night, those two were going on about love so much that my heart was worn out.

540
00:43:46,509 --> 00:43:48,528
I'll go out for a bit.

541
00:43:53,082 --> 00:43:54,406
Yes, Sir.

542
00:43:54,406 --> 00:43:57,980
I've already departed, so I should be there in around 20 minutes.

543
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:58,938
Yes.

544
00:43:58,938 --> 00:44:01,041
Then I'll meet you in front of Sang Go Jae.

545
00:44:16,413 --> 00:44:18,412
After sighing like that,

546
00:44:18,412 --> 00:44:20,241
it seems like the ground will collapse.

547
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:22,383
Ah, Director.

548
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,447
Is there something wrong?

549
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:27,590
If I said there is something...t here will be something.

550
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:29,932
And nothing will be nothing.

551
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:33,681
But I see that you're pretty successful in here.

552
00:44:33,681 --> 00:44:36,320
Today, you Director...

553
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,344
I am blaming you.

554
00:44:38,841 --> 00:44:40,773
It's Jin Ho.

555
00:44:41,531 --> 00:44:46,389
Because of the ongoing competition, he has been busier than anyone.

556
00:44:47,822 --> 00:44:50,404
Listening to your words,

557
00:44:50,404 --> 00:44:53,678
I feel that I did something terribly wrong.

558
00:44:54,101 --> 00:44:57,187
Because of me, you and Jin Ho

559
00:44:57,187 --> 00:45:00,025
have become the Cowherd and Weaver Maid.

560
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:04,893
To offer my repentance,

561
00:45:04,893 --> 00:45:06,112
I'll allow you to stave off work.

562
00:45:06,112 --> 00:45:07,713
How?

563
00:45:08,111 --> 00:45:09,847
While you're working,

564
00:45:10,327 --> 00:45:12,630
I heard you suffered a "serious injury".

565
00:45:13,713 --> 00:45:17,253
Making a lie for me.

566
00:45:17,253 --> 00:45:21,602
I feel my eyes misting over with tears.

567
00:45:21,602 --> 00:45:23,353
Should I give you a tissue?

568
00:45:25,774 --> 00:45:26,962
Really.

569
00:45:26,962 --> 00:45:28,480
Sigh... My jokes...

570
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,111
You always have a bad reaction to them.

571
00:45:32,508 --> 00:45:35,556
There it is, Miss Kae In. Please smile.

572
00:45:35,556 --> 00:45:38,634
Your smiling face is the best.

573
00:45:39,693 --> 00:45:43,319
Your laughter will be a big encouragement for Jin Ho.

574
00:45:43,698 --> 00:45:46,087
Thank you.

575
00:45:46,087 --> 00:45:48,056
Someone said this to me.

576
00:45:48,056 --> 00:45:52,375
You're just supposed to say  thank you.  At these times.

577
00:45:53,603 --> 00:45:57,260
Somehow, you're...

578
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,572
like my father...

579
00:45:59,572 --> 00:46:03,137
You give me a sense of security.

580
00:46:04,836 --> 00:46:08,649
Have you heard the news about your father?

581
00:46:08,649 --> 00:46:10,687
Yes.

582
00:46:11,136 --> 00:46:12,632
He said...

583
00:46:12,632 --> 00:46:14,813
he's coming back soon.

584
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,821
May I ask...

585
00:46:16,821 --> 00:46:19,799
If you know why he's returning?

586
00:46:19,799 --> 00:46:22,154
Not once...

587
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:27,318
has my father given any explanation to me.

588
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:31,884
When he leaves... or comes back.

589
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:40,958
That's why my father's nickname is "Gremlin".

590
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:43,235
Isn't it funny?

591
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,783
Hey, be careful.

592
00:46:49,783 --> 00:46:51,411
Be careful over there.

593
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,137
That's it. Steady.

594
00:46:54,137 --> 00:46:55,680
Adjust to this side a little.

595
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,561
Okay.

596
00:46:56,561 --> 00:46:57,477
This side.

597
00:46:57,477 --> 00:46:59,813
Yes, this is the spot.

598
00:46:59,813 --> 00:47:01,280
- Yes. 
- Yes.

599
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:05,747
Is it fine?

600
00:47:05,747 --> 00:47:07,480
Yes, it's perfect.

601
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,647
Alright.

602
00:47:09,647 --> 00:47:10,879
Goodbye.

603
00:47:10,879 --> 00:47:12,336
Yes.

604
00:47:25,913 --> 00:47:27,613
Kae In?

605
00:47:27,613 --> 00:47:29,384
Jin Ho?

606
00:47:32,547 --> 00:47:34,580
It seems you called the wrong person.

607
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,738
I'm not Park Kae In.

608
00:47:36,738 --> 00:47:39,747
If you aren't Park Kae In, then you're Park Il-Min.

609
00:47:41,147 --> 00:47:45,347
You said you were going to forget my name. Guess it's for real.

610
00:47:45,347 --> 00:47:47,147
Guess where I am right now.

611
00:47:47,147 --> 00:47:49,013
You're probably at work.

612
00:47:49,013 --> 00:47:51,380
Nope.

613
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,413
I'm at Sang Go Jae right now.

614
00:47:56,013 --> 00:47:57,280
You're finished with work?

615
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,813
No.

616
00:48:01,825 --> 00:48:05,580
Then why? Did you go to get something?

617
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:08,213
Then you should've told me to bring it to you.

618
00:48:08,213 --> 00:48:11,080
I'll tell you why I'm at Sang Go Jae.

619
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:18,480
Am i...
Someone whom you can order to and fro now?

620
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,832
For now, I'll check my schedule and-

621
00:48:20,832 --> 00:48:23,013
Alright, do that then.

622
00:48:23,013 --> 00:48:26,347
Ah really! With Korean language you have to listen to the whole sentence to know what the person is trying to say.

623
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:30,313
Don't go anywhere and stay put. Alright?

624
00:48:30,313 --> 00:48:32,213
Don't think it's an emergency and trip on the way here.

625
00:48:32,213 --> 00:48:34,700
Just be careful while getting here. I'll be waiting.

626
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,480
Okay.

627
00:49:05,947 --> 00:49:09,547
Mother! Bad news!
Oppa has been evicted from the office!

628
00:49:16,347 --> 00:49:18,747
Yes, this is the Dam Art Gallery.

629
00:49:21,713 --> 00:49:24,680
Yes, please wait a moment.

630
00:49:24,968 --> 00:49:26,747
Excuse me, Director.

631
00:49:28,347 --> 00:49:30,880
It's Park Chul Han on the phone.

632
00:49:34,113 --> 00:49:36,480
Yes, Choi Do Bin speaking.

633
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,613
Ah, yes. This is Park Chul Han.

634
00:49:41,547 --> 00:49:43,313
Yes.

635
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:53,813
What on earth happened?

636
00:49:53,813 --> 00:49:57,513
Until now we still can't find him?

637
00:49:57,513 --> 00:50:01,013
Well... the picture I have is rather old...

638
00:50:01,013 --> 00:50:02,713
Does that make sense?

639
00:50:03,499 --> 00:50:04,647
You...

640
00:50:04,647 --> 00:50:08,347
Til now, you can't recognize your father-in-law's face?

641
00:50:36,913 --> 00:50:38,213
Yes.

642
00:50:45,413 --> 00:50:47,347
Jin-

643
00:50:49,947 --> 00:50:52,813
Did Jin Ho leave it like this?

644
00:50:54,447 --> 00:50:56,213
Jin Ho...

645
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,513
Jin Ho!

646
00:51:03,613 --> 00:51:05,280
What is this now?

647
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,147
He said he'd wait for me...

648
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,747
- Kae In? 
-  I'm sorry for not being Kae In. 

649
00:51:22,147 --> 00:51:23,847
Oh, hyung.

650
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:26,455
Hey, do you remember the Dream Art Center?

651
00:51:26,455 --> 00:51:28,679
Where did you put the blueprint for it?

652
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:29,375
Why?

653
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:32,872
Woo Sung from Myung Sin Construction called.

654
00:51:32,872 --> 00:51:35,719
He said to make the design we did for him clearer.

655
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,445
Now is not the time to be nitpicking.

656
00:51:38,445 --> 00:51:41,492
It's not the time to ask if the rice is hot or cold.

657
00:51:41,492 --> 00:51:44,753
It's in the green tube.

658
00:51:45,211 --> 00:51:48,807
I'll be back shortly.

659
00:51:48,807 --> 00:51:51,062
Yeah, of course, of course.

660
00:51:51,062 --> 00:51:53,587
Take your time with your lover and come back.

661
00:53:18,123 --> 00:53:20,719
It's way too hard to get to this place.

662
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:22,168
It's the greatest.

663
00:53:22,168 --> 00:53:24,127
My goodness... what a hassle.

664
00:53:27,015 --> 00:53:28,113
Unni, you came?

665
00:53:28,113 --> 00:53:30,397
Yes, I'm here.

666
00:53:30,698 --> 00:53:32,969
But, what's this?

667
00:53:32,969 --> 00:53:34,333
What's what?

668
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:36,300
It's a design blueprint.

669
00:53:39,313 --> 00:53:41,002
What's wrong with you?

670
00:53:42,684 --> 00:53:44,591
Hey, come to your senses.

671
00:53:51,749 --> 00:53:52,977
Jeon Jin Ho...

672
00:53:52,977 --> 00:53:54,666
You are really bad...

673
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:57,287
How petty... Leaving without saying anything.

674
00:54:04,862 --> 00:54:06,195
Jin Ho...

675
00:54:06,195 --> 00:54:08,102
Why are you here?

676
00:54:47,338 --> 00:54:48,774
 Mom. 

677
00:54:49,062 --> 00:54:50,942
 Mom. 

678
00:55:50,711 --> 00:55:52,565
 Mom. 

679
00:55:53,297 --> 00:55:54,838
 Mom. 

680
00:55:55,256 --> 00:55:56,902
 Mom. 

681
00:56:24,853 --> 00:56:26,237
Hello.

682
00:56:26,681 --> 00:56:29,685
Wait... Can we talk?

683
00:56:29,685 --> 00:56:33,969
Yes... Come in.

684
00:56:33,969 --> 00:56:37,365
No need, let's just talk right here.

685
00:56:42,747 --> 00:56:44,131
What did you just say, you jerk!?

686
00:56:44,131 --> 00:56:47,004
Are you joking right now?!

687
00:56:49,564 --> 00:56:51,707
But mister, this is your fault!

688
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,154
Sit.

689
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:36,115
I'm... a person that doesn't like to beat around the bush.

690
00:57:37,003 --> 00:57:41,235
I'm sure you know the situation Jin Ho is in.

691
00:57:42,515 --> 00:57:43,873
Huh?

692
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,060
You don't know?

693
00:57:48,758 --> 00:57:53,199
How can you not know when it's all your fault?

694
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:55,789
Right now, my Jin Ho...

695
00:57:55,789 --> 00:57:58,657
because of you, he has been evicted from his office.

696
00:57:59,024 --> 00:58:01,061
You really don't know?

697
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:04,823
 She really doesn't know? How can she not know? 

698
00:58:04,823 --> 00:58:07,723
 Her mother's incident. 

699
00:58:07,723 --> 00:58:09,760
 She is a child without a mother. 

700
00:58:09,969 --> 00:58:11,667
I don't know...

701
00:58:13,313 --> 00:58:15,089
Kae In...

702
00:58:29,274 --> 00:58:30,684
Park Kae In...

703
00:58:31,181 --> 00:58:32,670
Listen to me.

704
00:58:33,741 --> 00:58:37,189
My Jin Ho cannot give up just like that.

705
00:58:38,495 --> 00:58:45,940
After the incident with his father, 
he has been striving towards this target.

706
00:58:46,253 --> 00:58:47,612
 Mom. 

707
00:58:52,523 --> 00:58:54,613
 Mom. 

708
00:58:55,527 --> 00:58:57,042
 Mom. 

709
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:59,080
 Mom. 

710
00:59:01,561 --> 00:59:05,871
If he was to give up now, he can never get back to where he was.

711
00:59:07,439 --> 00:59:14,309
If he ends up just like his father.. I won't be able to live with myself.

712
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:19,873
If you don't want to see me die, break up with my Jin Ho.

713
00:59:46,466 --> 00:59:48,399
 Kae In! 

714
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,253
 Mom! 

715
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:51,716
Ahhh...

716
00:59:53,806 --> 00:59:55,060
Kae In...

717
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:59,135
Kae In, I'm sorry...

718
01:00:03,341 --> 01:00:05,509
Please understand my feelings as a mother.

719
01:00:06,397 --> 01:00:07,834
I...

720
01:00:11,282 --> 01:00:12,693
I'll be going.

721
01:00:23,481 --> 01:00:24,918
Please excuse me.

722
01:00:50,858 --> 01:00:52,268
What's going on?

723
01:00:54,593 --> 01:00:58,668
Is that why?

724
01:01:01,019 --> 01:01:11,076
Is that why you hate me that much?

725
01:01:16,118 --> 01:01:22,753
I've always wondered why you hated me as a child.

726
01:01:22,753 --> 01:01:25,940
Why did you hate me so much?

727
01:01:28,526 --> 01:01:32,549
Day after day, it's always this saddening.

728
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:42,606
If I were you, I would have done the same.

729
01:01:47,334 --> 01:01:50,260
I am a daughter who killed her mom.

730
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:53,369
Kae In, what are you talking about?

731
01:02:14,487 --> 01:02:15,687
Kae In!
