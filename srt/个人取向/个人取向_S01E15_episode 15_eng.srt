1
00:00:03,995 --> 00:00:06,515
I've always wondered...

2
00:00:06,515 --> 00:00:10,821
why you hated me as a child.

3
00:00:10,821 --> 00:00:13,878
Why did you hate me so much?

4
00:00:15,455 --> 00:00:20,395
Day after day, it's always saddening...

5
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:25,685
If I were you...

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,020
I would have done the same.

7
00:00:33,357 --> 00:00:36,021
I am a daughter who killed her mom.

8
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:37,709
Kae In,

9
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:40,326
what are you saying?

10
00:00:57,028 --> 00:00:58,978
Kae In.

11
00:01:06,284 --> 00:01:07,991
Who are you?

12
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:11,830
I should have introduced myself sooner. I am Jeon Jin Ho.

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,737
Leave.

14
00:01:15,397 --> 00:01:17,016
Kae In!

15
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:19,393
Are you okay?

16
00:01:20,085 --> 00:01:22,318
I...

17
00:01:22,662 --> 00:01:25,819
remember everything.

18
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,866
It was...

19
00:01:28,866 --> 00:01:32,880
a bright and sunny day...

20
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,589
When I looked at the sky and my mom...

21
00:01:36,207 --> 00:01:38,401
My mom's face...

22
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:41,602
for a second, I couldn't see it.

23
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,192
 Mom. 

24
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,282
 Mom. 

25
00:01:46,282 --> 00:01:48,859
I was just...

26
00:01:49,682 --> 00:01:51,671
My mom...

27
00:01:51,671 --> 00:01:54,318
I was just trying to call her.

28
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:57,079
I...

29
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:59,938
just wanted to ask her to play with me.

30
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:02,155
Just to take care of me...

31
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:04,402
But...

32
00:02:05,016 --> 00:02:08,189
mom didn't answer...

33
00:02:15,396 --> 00:02:17,332
Then, I...

34
00:02:19,558 --> 00:02:21,869
I...

35
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,667
No.

36
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:24,995
It's not like that.

37
00:02:24,995 --> 00:02:28,591
Kae In, you just had a bad dream.

38
00:02:29,331 --> 00:02:31,412
I remember.

39
00:02:32,462 --> 00:02:34,467
Back then...

40
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:36,267
Mom...

41
00:02:38,118 --> 00:02:39,867
looked at me.

42
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:44,212
And she was smiling.

43
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:13,867
This picture...

44
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,552
Where did you find it?

45
00:03:32,448 --> 00:03:34,032
The basement,

46
00:03:34,032 --> 00:03:35,804
you opened it?!

47
00:03:38,339 --> 00:03:39,618
Yes.

48
00:03:40,585 --> 00:03:42,387
Who are you to do so?

49
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:45,600
WHO ARE YOU TO DO SO?

50
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,066
Get out.

51
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:51,067
Get out of my house this instant!

52
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:54,567
I said get out!!!

53
00:04:00,477 --> 00:04:05,433
Episode 15 
  Trying to forget you 

54
00:05:08,204 --> 00:05:10,032
Mom.

55
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,506
Because of me...

56
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:23,685
Mom...

57
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,160
While trying to save me,

58
00:05:30,967 --> 00:05:33,089
Kae In...

59
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:37,765
My dad...

60
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:43,834
I've always wondered why he hated me.

61
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:46,046
Now, I know.

62
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:49,703
I would have done the same thing.

63
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,942
If I had a daughter like me...

64
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:56,033
I'd rather not see her either.

65
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:17,800
- Tae Hoon.
- Yeah.

66
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,833
I got the new blueprints.

67
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,100
Look over it carefully.

68
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,900
How old is this paper?

69
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,992
While he was at Sang Go Jae,

70
00:06:25,992 --> 00:06:28,939
Jin Ho was rushing through work. 
And there wasn't any other draft paper.

71
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:30,633
What's that?

72
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:32,067
It's just what it is, you punk.

73
00:06:32,067 --> 00:06:33,746
To save our skins,

74
00:06:33,746 --> 00:06:36,271
it's the Ace of Spades "hidden card".

75
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:39,053
Ace of Spade... so what is this?

76
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:40,267
Your job is to print.

77
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,944
Not finding out what it is. Got it?

78
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:44,683
Just tell me, I'm part of this company too. 
You don't tell me anything always.

79
00:06:44,683 --> 00:06:47,200
It's because you can't know. 
You know what I mean?

80
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,067
I can't figure it out. Just tell me.

81
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:51,582
- You can't know. 
- Just tell me!

82
00:06:51,582 --> 00:06:53,567
JUST DON'T TALK ABOUT IT!

83
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:00,267
Are you standing up to me? Huh?

84
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:01,233
No.

85
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,500
Just do as I told you to.

86
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,756
Hello, I am M Construction's Noh Sang Jun.

87
00:07:13,756 --> 00:07:15,589
Yes, hello, Director.

88
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,033
Excuse me? $200 million?!

89
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:25,633
He said we had to raise 200 million by the end of the month.

90
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:27,541
If it's not solved by the end of this month,

91
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:30,484
then he plans to take legal actions.

92
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,373
I am sorry, Jin Ho.

93
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,899
This is the only choice we have.

94
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,491
This is our company's finished draft of the Dam Arts Center.

95
00:08:02,763 --> 00:08:06,820
I wanted to see what you would say if I brought it to you.

96
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:10,638
I know this is a little underhanded...

97
00:08:10,638 --> 00:08:13,351
If you could just point out some good or bad points,

98
00:08:13,351 --> 00:08:17,730
then following that, we could make some improvements.

99
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,551
Did Director Jeon request  this?

100
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:20,970
Of course.

101
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,482
Jin Ho...  I mean Director Jeon...

102
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:27,282
If it was Director Choi,

103
00:08:27,282 --> 00:08:28,762
he will seriously help by taking a look.

104
00:08:28,762 --> 00:08:30,905
he will seriously help by taking a look.

105
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:37,906
Well, then I'll leave it to you.

106
00:08:39,056 --> 00:08:41,215
You are Noh Sang Jun, correct?

107
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,600
Yes.

108
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,397
If it's the Director Jeon I know, then I know he wouldn't do something like this.

109
00:08:47,397 --> 00:08:50,062
This is a characteristic I see in him.

110
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:54,911
Or is it that I've misinterpreted him all this time?

111
00:08:56,844 --> 00:08:58,725
No, sir.

112
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,285
That...  I...

113
00:09:02,213 --> 00:09:04,368
Take it back.

114
00:09:06,702 --> 00:09:08,769
Truth is...

115
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:12,152
our company is having a really hard time.

116
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,438
This isn't something Director Jeon would ask,

117
00:09:14,438 --> 00:09:17,899
but in a state of panic, I came here.

118
00:09:18,505 --> 00:09:20,655
Please, sir.

119
00:09:45,163 --> 00:09:46,764
Go.

120
00:09:56,713 --> 00:09:58,389
I...

121
00:09:59,739 --> 00:10:03,300
I don't know what to say at this moment,

122
00:10:05,124 --> 00:10:08,285
but can you think of this one thing?

123
00:10:09,979 --> 00:10:11,576
I...

124
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:14,371
am always beside you.

125
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:19,897
Right now, it may not be much.

126
00:10:19,897 --> 00:10:21,059
No.

127
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,578
Since you're here by my side...

128
00:10:26,489 --> 00:10:28,869
right now, for me,

129
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:31,142
is everything.

130
00:10:48,642 --> 00:10:53,371


131
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:02,733
I...

132
00:11:03,341 --> 00:11:08,234
although I am not old-fashioned enough not to misunderstand youths these days,

133
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:14,225
my daughter is living with a man before marrying...

134
00:11:14,225 --> 00:11:19,324
Jin Ho was living here while paying rent.

135
00:11:19,324 --> 00:11:21,867
You gave him a room to rent?

136
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:26,542
Let's talk about this later.

137
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:29,032
Go inside and rest for today.

138
00:11:36,016 --> 00:11:39,429
That Jeon Jin Ho did something he wasn't supposed to.

139
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:42,973
I've blocked the basement,

140
00:11:42,973 --> 00:11:44,658
so forget what happened.

141
00:11:45,429 --> 00:11:49,143
You can't erase something that has already happened.

142
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:51,450
Kae In!

143
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,357
Good night.

144
00:12:36,995 --> 00:12:38,897
Thank you very much.

145
00:12:38,897 --> 00:12:42,528
You can be part of the judgment panel this time, 
I don't know how to thank you.

146
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:46,768
The Dam Arts Center Project is fated with me.

147
00:12:46,768 --> 00:12:50,287
I am participating as a judge now.

148
00:12:50,287 --> 00:12:51,728
Ah, right!

149
00:12:51,728 --> 00:12:53,556
I don't know if I'll be of much help.

150
00:12:53,556 --> 00:12:55,480
- Please, have a seat. 
- Yes.

151
00:12:56,826 --> 00:12:58,515
You are headed to the Dam Art Gallery?

152
00:12:58,515 --> 00:12:59,734
Yeah...

153
00:12:59,734 --> 00:13:02,337
Ji-Jin Ho... wait...

154
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:07,449
Your sketch... I just went ahead and gave it to Director Choi.

155
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:08,142
Sketch?

156
00:13:08,142 --> 00:13:10,819
The Dam Arts Center Project sketch.

157
00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:12,391
That isn't completed yet.

158
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,659
Yeah, that's right, but...

159
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:18,055
I think he can give us some pointers. 
So I went ahead and gave the plans to him.

160
00:13:18,055 --> 00:13:19,100
What do you mean by that?

161
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,467
The sketch that was in the black case.

162
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:25,333
I showed it to him.

163
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:29,031
The thing in there... You showed it to Director Choi?!

164
00:13:29,031 --> 00:13:32,239
I know that you hate things like that,

165
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:36,784
but if we show it to him first, 
he will be more considerate of us.

166
00:13:36,784 --> 00:13:39,744
Aigoo, I didn't draw that.

167
00:13:39,744 --> 00:13:41,356
Then who did?

168
00:13:41,356 --> 00:13:43,341
Professor Park Chul Han.

169
00:13:43,341 --> 00:13:45,018
Kae In's father.

170
00:13:45,018 --> 00:13:50,851
Th-then ho-how do you ha-have Professor Park's sketches?

171
00:13:50,851 --> 00:13:51,633
Hey! Where are you going?

172
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:54,078
What do you mean? I have to go get them back.

173
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:57,233
Why did you do something I didn't even ask you to?!

174
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:09,933
Jin Ho...

175
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,580
Where do I find Director Choi?

176
00:14:16,077 --> 00:14:20,022
Before the judgment is set, 
this set of blueprints I have...

177
00:14:20,022 --> 00:14:21,728
Will you take a look at it?

178
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,526
Yes.

179
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,067
Please sit.

180
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:51,346
Yes.

181
00:14:56,066 --> 00:15:00,506
Kae In, how...?  Here...?

182
00:15:00,506 --> 00:15:01,808
Come in.

183
00:15:01,808 --> 00:15:04,120
Yes.

184
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:08,213
She's designing the Children's Room.

185
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:09,627
Have a seat.

186
00:15:09,627 --> 00:15:11,078
Yes.

187
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:12,733
Ah... I see.

188
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:16,755
Now that your father came, we might as well have a meal together.

189
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:20,933
You must be shocked to see that your daughter is working at the Dam Art Gallery.

190
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:26,185
She is still lacking in many ways, 
I don't know if she has caused more trouble here.

191
00:15:26,185 --> 00:15:27,387
No.

192
00:15:27,387 --> 00:15:31,832
Miss Park Kae In is very talented. 
I think I have good foresight.

193
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:36,333
I am proud of scouting her and discovering her talent.

194
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:39,667
Thank you for saying so.

195
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,989
Excuse me... That...

196
00:15:45,782 --> 00:15:47,480
Who is it?

197
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,677
The person who did this?

198
00:15:48,677 --> 00:15:52,752
M Construction's director Jeon Jin Ho.

199
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:58,503
I don't know if you've heard yet, but Kae In and Jin Ho...

200
00:15:58,503 --> 00:16:01,176
they are dating each other.

201
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:06,940
Jeon Jin Ho is a person with many talents.

202
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,041
Jeon Jin Ho is here.

203
00:16:24,308 --> 00:16:28,640
This sketch... is it yours?!

204
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,047
I...  That...

205
00:16:31,047 --> 00:16:33,851
IS IT YOURS?!

206
00:16:36,511 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm sorry.

207
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:50,587
This is my design of the Dam Arts Center from 30 years ago.

208
00:16:50,587 --> 00:16:53,333
Is this the reason you came into our house?

209
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,967
I wasn't trying to steal it,

210
00:16:55,967 --> 00:16:59,312
but I understand your present feelings.

211
00:16:59,312 --> 00:17:02,734
What... are you saying?

212
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:06,025
What sketch are you saying you stole?

213
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:10,400
I think there's some misunderstanding.

214
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,948
Jin Ho, go ahead and say it.

215
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,100
Eh?

216
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,867
You're really amazing...

217
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:20,158
You moved into my house solely because of these plans!

218
00:17:20,158 --> 00:17:23,533
When you got the chance, you searched everywhere in my house.

219
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:26,244
In the end, you found this sketch.

220
00:17:26,244 --> 00:17:30,402
And you played with my daughter's feelings. 
WAS IT FUN?!

221
00:17:30,402 --> 00:17:32,267
That's not it.

222
00:17:32,267 --> 00:17:36,279
My love for Park Kae In has no deception.

223
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:41,686
How can I trust the words of someone who stole my plans now?

224
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:44,956
Underhanded bastard!

225
00:18:04,905 --> 00:18:06,400
Father!

226
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,867
Who are you calling "father"?!

227
00:18:08,867 --> 00:18:14,467
Can you please... listen to my explanation?

228
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:17,653
Please listen to Jin Ho's explanation.

229
00:18:17,653 --> 00:18:20,600
There must be some type of misunderstanding.

230
00:18:21,106 --> 00:18:23,533
Are you still that way?

231
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:26,200
Not knowing if he has a knife to your neck,

232
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,121
trusting anyone you meet.

233
00:18:29,121 --> 00:18:32,386
To win the Dam Arts Center Project,

234
00:18:32,386 --> 00:18:35,100
he used you!

235
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:38,551
No...

236
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,719
It wasn't like that.

237
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:44,033
Right, Jin Ho?

238
00:18:44,367 --> 00:18:48,067
The Dam Arts Center was something that belonged to me.

239
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:49,833
And he knew that,

240
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:53,767
so from the start to steal my sketch he came into Sang Go Jae!

241
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:56,667
If there is some misunderstanding, then say it.

242
00:18:59,867 --> 00:19:01,367
Yes.

243
00:19:04,704 --> 00:19:06,954
What you said was right.

244
00:19:08,267 --> 00:19:14,500
When I first moved into Sang Go Jae, 
I had some of those thoughts.

245
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:21,932
When I heard that the Dam Arts Center's concept would be Sang Go Jae, I wanted to see if I could get some insight.

246
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:29,167
What did you say just now?

247
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,471
However...

248
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:34,433
once I started liking Kae In,

249
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:37,100
I changed my mind.

250
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,124
Because you thought...

251
00:19:39,124 --> 00:19:43,726
that being my son-in-law will benefit you in many ways.

252
00:19:45,372 --> 00:19:49,433
You are okay with that kind of love?

253
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:04,986
So, is it really because of the Dam Arts Center project...

254
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:08,311
that you came to Sang Go Jae?

255
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,433
I'm sorry.

256
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:14,791
I was going to tell you, but...

257
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,300
When?

258
00:20:16,467 --> 00:20:19,767
After you won the Dam Arts Center Project?

259
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:23,000
With the sketch you stole from my father?

260
00:20:23,611 --> 00:20:24,525
Kae In...

261
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:25,633
that's not it.

262
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:28,033
How?

263
00:20:28,033 --> 00:20:31,967
How could you do this to me?

264
00:20:33,224 --> 00:20:34,733
Then...

265
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,700
from the start...

266
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:44,933
you came close to me just to use me?

267
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,294
Jin Ho!

268
00:21:31,294 --> 00:21:33,005
Jin Ho!

269
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,441
Did you get the sketch?

270
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:41,076
I couldn't just sit around and wait because I was so worried.

271
00:21:41,912 --> 00:21:43,300
It's all over.

272
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,207
It's all over?

273
00:21:44,207 --> 00:21:46,662
Professor Park stopped by.

274
00:21:46,662 --> 00:21:48,333
By using Kae In,

275
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:52,252
and revealing he took the plans, Professor Park was very angry.

276
00:21:52,252 --> 00:21:54,708
Tha- That's not the truth.

277
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:55,518
That sketch,

278
00:21:55,518 --> 00:21:58,339
I thought Jin Ho made it and took it to Director Choi.

279
00:21:58,339 --> 00:21:59,201
Jin Ho.

280
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:02,466
I'll go to Professor Park and Director Choi, and figure it all out.

281
00:22:02,466 --> 00:22:05,366
I'll tell them that our company was in bad condition, and this is how it turned out.

282
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:08,030
And I'll say that we're aiming for a new concept, okay?

283
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,049
Leave it alone.

284
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:10,486
How can I just leave it alone?

285
00:22:10,486 --> 00:22:13,333
If we call it like this, 
that's the end of the company and you.

286
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,200
Wait a second.

287
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,933
It's better to have a talk with Director Choi first.

288
00:22:16,933 --> 00:22:17,852
I said stop it.

289
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,867
I did wrong.

290
00:22:22,867 --> 00:22:27,219
Because I had the wrong intentions when I entered Sang Go Jae.

291
00:22:27,219 --> 00:22:30,203
That's why it happened.

292
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,739
Why did you want to meet again?

293
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:37,644
Congratulations.

294
00:22:37,644 --> 00:22:39,177
What are you talking about?

295
00:22:39,177 --> 00:22:41,243
Events have changed,

296
00:22:41,243 --> 00:22:43,612
it became favorable to you.

297
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,267
What?

298
00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:46,561
The person who worked with Jin Ho

299
00:22:46,561 --> 00:22:49,867
revealed Professor Park's Dam Arts Center sketch,

300
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:51,507
as if it were Jin Ho's.

301
00:22:51,507 --> 00:22:53,933
and showed it to Director Choi.

302
00:22:53,933 --> 00:22:55,292
So in the end,

303
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:57,869
Professor Park's sketch,

304
00:22:57,869 --> 00:22:59,900
Jin Ho stole it.

305
00:23:00,834 --> 00:23:02,467
Now, Jin Ho...

306
00:23:02,467 --> 00:23:05,764
He'll probably lose the director's trust.

307
00:23:05,764 --> 00:23:08,933
Looking at Professor Park's attitude,

308
00:23:08,933 --> 00:23:11,967
it may all be buried away.

309
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,833
Jeon Jin Ho, that crazy bastard...

310
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,112
Call up that person and tell him to pack his stuff.

311
00:23:30,463 --> 00:23:34,100
If you can't do it, then I will.

312
00:23:35,385 --> 00:23:39,004
I'll... do it.

313
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:46,097
Me as a person..

314
00:23:46,097 --> 00:23:49,231
If I weren't your daughter...

315
00:23:49,231 --> 00:23:51,533
I wouldn't have gotten love

316
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:55,676
from anybody.

317
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,126
 

318
00:24:51,415 --> 00:24:53,500
Aren't you going to answer your phone?

319
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,150
What would I have to say?

320
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:00,168
Why wouldn't you have something to say?

321
00:25:00,168 --> 00:25:03,600
It was my fault you got into Sang Go Jae.

322
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,367
And it was also my fault for continuously saying that you were gay.

323
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:08,504
And the sketch-

324
00:25:08,504 --> 00:25:11,639
No matter what you did...

325
00:25:11,639 --> 00:25:15,167
they were still my mistakes.

326
00:25:16,601 --> 00:25:20,267
Explaining everything now won't help.

327
00:25:20,267 --> 00:25:21,909
The truth doesn't disappear.

328
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:26,105
Then are you going to keep ignoring Kae In's phone calls?

329
00:25:26,105 --> 00:25:30,065
Are you going to keep taking the blame for things that you didn't do?

330
00:25:30,742 --> 00:25:34,267
Look how far you and Kae In went.

331
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:36,949
If you two are breaking up, I will feel so sorry.

332
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:39,480
How can I look at your face?

333
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,409
Jin Ho,

334
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:42,267
let's just find them and beg.

335
00:25:42,267 --> 00:25:45,215
You don't have to say anything, okay? 
Let me do the talking.

336
00:25:45,215 --> 00:25:47,839
You and Kae In can't end things like this.

337
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:49,533
Even if you end it,

338
00:25:49,533 --> 00:25:51,267
let's clear up the misunderstanding.

339
00:25:51,267 --> 00:25:54,248
If you break up with Kae In now...

340
00:25:54,248 --> 00:25:57,999
how will Kae In face her father?

341
00:26:06,967 --> 00:26:12,836


342
00:26:19,783 --> 00:26:23,567
Anybody there?

343
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:28,822
Oh gosh, Professor Park!

344
00:26:28,822 --> 00:26:33,595
It's a pleasure to see you face to face after only seeing pictures of you.

345
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:37,019
I'm sorry, but, who are you?

346
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:38,067
Oh, yes.

347
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:43,067
I greeted you on the phone once. 
I'm Han Yoon Sub from Mirae Construction.

348
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:44,633
Oh, yes.

349
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:46,067
But, then,

350
00:26:46,067 --> 00:26:47,561
what brings you here?

351
00:26:47,561 --> 00:26:49,333
What are you doing, brat?

352
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:53,367
Introduce yourself to your father-in-law, quick.

353
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,827
Pleased to meet you.

354
00:26:55,827 --> 00:26:57,000
I am Han Chang Ryul.

355
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,205
He's my son.

356
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:24,700
I heard Jeon Jin Ho stole Professor Park's plans.

357
00:27:24,867 --> 00:27:26,900
Underhanded bastard!

358
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:31,100
I warned you so much not to get close to him...

359
00:27:33,367 --> 00:27:38,366
By chance... did you know about this?

360
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:42,429
About why Jin Ho came into Sang Go Jae?

361
00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:45,600
In the end, you found out too.

362
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,025
To prevent you from getting more scars...

363
00:27:48,025 --> 00:27:50,767
It would have been better if you wouldn't have known...

364
00:27:54,367 --> 00:27:57,104
Even after experiencing this,

365
00:27:57,104 --> 00:27:59,961
you won't still have feelings for him, right?

366
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:03,267
Lying about being gay to get in here,

367
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:06,867
it was all to get Professor Park's sketch.

368
00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:10,067
Isn't that what you and your father are doing as well?

369
00:28:10,067 --> 00:28:12,733
Everything you said about getting back together,

370
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,400
was all because of the Dam Arts Center.

371
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,049
Your father finding himself here...

372
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:20,200
They're all the same reasons.

373
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,533
Kae In!

374
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,933
I'm not like that!

375
00:28:23,933 --> 00:28:26,133
Everything...

376
00:28:26,133 --> 00:28:29,323
it's all the same.

377
00:28:40,628 --> 00:28:42,967
You must have been very shocked.

378
00:28:42,967 --> 00:28:45,967
Having been caught head-on with so many problems.

379
00:28:45,967 --> 00:28:47,633
But that Jin Ho...

380
00:28:47,633 --> 00:28:51,467
did something unimaginable.

381
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:57,100
Jin Ho, he has always harbored some bad blood with my family.

382
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,167
So then,

383
00:28:58,167 --> 00:29:02,810
he knew that my son was dating your daughter,

384
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:06,333
but he still managed to get close to her.

385
00:29:07,133 --> 00:29:09,451
Please don't talk like that.

386
00:29:09,451 --> 00:29:10,519
That's not it.

387
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:12,100
This man...

388
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,733
What is your relationship with him?

389
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,127
We were dating before.

390
00:29:23,127 --> 00:29:26,133
We broke up because it was my fault.

391
00:29:26,935 --> 00:29:32,500
Young people breaking up and getting together, isn't that what they do these days?

392
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,100
Well anyways,

393
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:38,633
you know my son had good intentions

394
00:29:38,633 --> 00:29:40,900
when using Do-Il Furniture.

395
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:45,033
He bought all of your daughter's furniture designs.

396
00:29:45,435 --> 00:29:48,100
Having your own name as a brand

397
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,633
is every designer's dream.

398
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:52,767
Do-Il Furniture...

399
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:56,167
You did that?

400
00:29:56,975 --> 00:29:58,300
The launching...

401
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,861
We aren't fully responsible for it.

402
00:29:59,861 --> 00:30:01,567
We aren't fully responsible for it.

403
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:04,533
So don't mind it too much.

404
00:30:13,532 --> 00:30:14,766
 If you end it, 

405
00:30:14,766 --> 00:30:16,933
 let's still clear up all the misunderstanding. 

406
00:30:16,933 --> 00:30:19,433
 If you bear the misunderstanding and break with her... 

407
00:30:19,433 --> 00:30:23,133
 what will Kae In be to her father? 

408
00:30:36,844 --> 00:30:39,467
Aigo, it is an honor that you can come to be a judge.

409
00:30:39,467 --> 00:30:41,867
Thank you very much.

410
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:43,967
Coming here without prior notice,

411
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,767
it seems very impolite of us. We are very sorry.

412
00:30:45,767 --> 00:30:48,484
I'm sorry.

413
00:30:48,484 --> 00:30:50,100
Chang Ryul...

414
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,567
Yes, father-in-law.

415
00:30:51,567 --> 00:30:55,500
Are your feelings for my daughter sincere?

416
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,680
Yes.

417
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,833
Of course.

418
00:30:57,833 --> 00:30:59,700
Back then,

419
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,633
I gave her so much hardship.

420
00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:04,767
And although Kae In's heart isn't opened up to me yet,

421
00:31:04,767 --> 00:31:06,700
I am prepared to wait,

422
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,233
and give effort.

423
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:13,143
When my daughter opens her heart to you,

424
00:31:13,143 --> 00:31:16,325
then, I guess we will be meeting again.

425
00:31:16,325 --> 00:31:18,567
I will do my best.

426
00:31:29,067 --> 00:31:32,133
Let's talk.

427
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,500
If it's about Jin Ho,

428
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,967
then I don't want to talk.

429
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,633
So...

430
00:31:44,633 --> 00:31:50,167
are you saying you'll keep meeting up with the man who stole my blueprints?

431
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:51,300
Although I'm not sure...

432
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:55,300
there has to be a reason.

433
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,500
Jin Ho would not cause something that he would get caught so quickly for.

434
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,967
He is not that foolish of a person.

435
00:31:59,967 --> 00:32:01,367
Because he is so sly,

436
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:05,533
he obviously did it after he captured your heart.

437
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:11,633
Anyways, about the Chang Ryul lad...

438
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:13,467
he seems okay.

439
00:32:13,467 --> 00:32:16,167
You don't know him.

440
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:19,967
What kind of pain Chang Ryul gave me.

441
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:21,433
That pain...

442
00:32:21,433 --> 00:32:23,433
How Jin Ho cleared all that away...

443
00:32:23,433 --> 00:32:25,625
How could you still want to protect Jeon Jin Ho?

444
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:27,962
If he, to whom you feel so grateful, 
really is that innocent,

445
00:32:27,962 --> 00:32:30,549
Then he should have come down by now and explained everything.

446
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:31,750
But yet, he didn't.

447
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,209
You said you wanted to talk.

448
00:32:35,277 --> 00:32:38,729
But yet, you're not listening to what I have to say.

449
00:32:40,005 --> 00:32:42,778
You don't even believe me.

450
00:32:53,958 --> 00:32:57,658


451
00:33:06,598 --> 00:33:09,475
 Is this why you came into my house? 

452
00:33:32,903 --> 00:33:34,805
I mean,

453
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:38,471
you should at least come and explain something.

454
00:33:48,284 --> 00:33:49,277
Yes, Young Sun.

455
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,937
I heard everything from Sang Jun.

456
00:33:51,937 --> 00:33:54,845
Don't tell me you met with Jin Ho?

457
00:33:54,845 --> 00:33:55,803
No.

458
00:33:55,803 --> 00:33:56,435
Really?

459
00:33:56,435 --> 00:34:00,004
What I heard from Sang Jun, he said that Jin Ho left to go see you.

460
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:01,498
He didn't come.

461
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,087
I heard that there was a big problem because of the sketch.

462
00:34:06,435 --> 00:34:09,491
- I'm hanging up. 
-  Hold on, don't hang up.  I'm asking you to listen. 

463
00:34:09,491 --> 00:34:12,317
Jin Ho didn't do it.

464
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:14,799
  It wasn't Jin Ho's intention to steal them. 

465
00:34:14,799 --> 00:34:15,970
What do you mean by that?

466
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:19,720
Sang Jun, this moron, 
took it by mistake to let Director Choi see it.

467
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,919
But when Jin Ho went to go find them, he encountered your father.

468
00:34:25,635 --> 00:34:29,919
But, the fact that he came into my house with a motive...

469
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:31,303
Yeah...

470
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:33,950
That's right.

471
00:34:34,678 --> 00:34:38,443
Anyways, with knowing that situation, it wasn't Jin Ho's fault.

472
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,742
Alright, hanging up.

473
00:34:43,085 --> 00:34:44,487
Hey!

474
00:34:44,487 --> 00:34:47,743
Can you be eating at a time like this?

475
00:35:07,436 --> 00:35:09,268
Father...

476
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,995
you think I am a bad person...

477
00:35:15,995 --> 00:35:19,482
and want to punish me, don't you?

478
00:35:20,753 --> 00:35:23,583
When I did wrong,

479
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:27,057
I can't even beg for forgiveness.

480
00:35:28,616 --> 00:35:31,629
I'm pathetic, right?

481
00:35:34,453 --> 00:35:38,107
But father...

482
00:35:39,614 --> 00:35:41,285
I...

483
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,350
There is nothing I can do for that woman.

484
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:53,929
Being recognized by her father...

485
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:56,858
is the only wish in her heart.

486
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,853
But I shamed her in front of her father.

487
00:36:05,553 --> 00:36:08,566
I'm pretty useless, aren't I?

488
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:14,861
Where are you?

489
00:36:15,053 --> 00:36:21,052
I'm at the tourist rest-stop that we've been before.

490
00:36:21,052 --> 00:36:26,016
Whether you get this message or not, I'll wait.

491
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,320
 What did you wish for? 

492
00:37:40,787 --> 00:37:43,320
 That us two, 

493
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,053
 that there will never be a time where we have anything to hide from each other. 

494
00:38:19,053 --> 00:38:21,420
I was very angry before,

495
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:25,553
so I said we should never meet again...

496
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:29,487
I, as a person... can't do it.

497
00:38:29,987 --> 00:38:35,387
I would like to give you one last chance to explain things.

498
00:38:37,553 --> 00:38:40,320
Until you tell me what happened yourself,

499
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,187
I won't believe any of that.

500
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:45,787
I don't care if I see it with my own eyes, 
I don't care what other people say.

501
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,120
Say it... Say that it's a misunderstanding.

502
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,153
Say that it wasn't on purpose.

503
00:38:52,153 --> 00:38:55,053
That the truth is, it's not because of you,

504
00:38:55,053 --> 00:38:58,187
but because of Sang Jun, it became like that.

505
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,353
It was all me.

506
00:39:05,287 --> 00:39:08,087
Don't lie to me.

507
00:39:08,087 --> 00:39:11,820
Look at my eyes, and tell me.

508
00:39:14,258 --> 00:39:17,020
Going into Sang Go Jae, pretending to be gay,

509
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,287
and the sketch.

510
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,087
It was all me.

511
00:39:22,087 --> 00:39:24,620
I don't know what Sang Jun said,

512
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:28,820
but after hearing the Dam Arts Center's concept was Sang Go Jae, I entered the house.

513
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:32,787
And to not get caught, I pretended to be gay.

514
00:39:33,453 --> 00:39:35,953
And then I found Professor Park's sketch.

515
00:39:35,953 --> 00:39:38,753
I imagined that I hit the jackpot.

516
00:39:38,753 --> 00:39:41,753
You were my woman already,

517
00:39:41,753 --> 00:39:43,987
even if I got discovered, what can you do?

518
00:39:43,987 --> 00:39:46,320
This is what I thought.

519
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:49,720
Now do you understand?

520
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,420
What's wrong with you, Jin Ho?

521
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,165
Why are you being like this to me?

522
00:39:55,165 --> 00:39:58,326
I made use of you all this time,

523
00:39:58,326 --> 00:40:01,987
yet you still believe me like a fool.

524
00:40:02,153 --> 00:40:05,787
That's why you got thrown away by Chang Ryul.

525
00:40:05,787 --> 00:40:09,120
Do you think I would like a girl like you?

526
00:40:09,587 --> 00:40:14,187
You love me.

527
00:40:14,187 --> 00:40:18,887
That's why you looked at me with those eyes.

528
00:40:18,887 --> 00:40:22,420
Because my heart was in pain,

529
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:25,787
and you hugged me.

530
00:40:27,687 --> 00:40:30,091
I pretended to love you

531
00:40:30,091 --> 00:40:32,853
to do whatever I could to succeed.

532
00:40:35,653 --> 00:40:39,620
Because tricking a girl like you isn't difficult.

533
00:40:40,653 --> 00:40:42,053
Then...

534
00:40:42,053 --> 00:40:48,420
why didn't you lie to the end? 
Why are you telling me now?

535
00:40:48,953 --> 00:40:52,987
If you have just told me it wasn't you, I would have believed you.

536
00:40:52,987 --> 00:40:55,346
Only you will trust me.

537
00:40:55,346 --> 00:40:57,989
Professor Park wouldn't have.

538
00:40:58,753 --> 00:41:02,216
Lying to you isn't difficult,

539
00:41:02,216 --> 00:41:05,091
but Professor Park is not that stupid.

540
00:41:05,091 --> 00:41:07,446
Don't be like this.

541
00:41:07,446 --> 00:41:10,550
You're trying to give me scars on purpose.

542
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,905
Don't talk like that.

543
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:15,787
You're not someone like this.

544
00:41:15,787 --> 00:41:17,187
No.

545
00:41:18,087 --> 00:41:22,413
The person you knew from the start was like this.

546
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:25,336
I'm telling you this now,

547
00:41:25,336 --> 00:41:29,253
only because I am feeling a little pity for you.

548
00:41:32,345 --> 00:41:34,404
Because you're sorry,

549
00:41:34,404 --> 00:41:37,256
That's why you're being like this.

550
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,987
Please tell me that.

551
00:41:41,387 --> 00:41:44,365
I'm not sorry to you for anything.

552
00:41:45,353 --> 00:41:49,058
I'm just frustrated things didn't go as I planned.

553
00:41:49,058 --> 00:41:51,884
So...

554
00:41:52,377 --> 00:41:55,933
don't ever appear in front of me again.

555
00:42:39,245 --> 00:42:43,302
I'm not going to love Park Kae In.

556
00:42:44,753 --> 00:42:48,318
I don't love Park Kae In.

557
00:42:51,287 --> 00:42:55,057
I've never loved Park Kae In.

558
00:43:17,081 --> 00:43:19,905
Where have you been, coming home at this time of night?

559
00:43:24,521 --> 00:43:26,540
Where have you been?!

560
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:30,402
Like you told me to do,

561
00:43:31,888 --> 00:43:34,481
I broke up with Jin Ho.

562
00:43:47,513 --> 00:43:49,972
Have you decided to come back home?

563
00:43:51,096 --> 00:43:52,532
Yes.

564
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,759
You broke up with that young lady, right?

565
00:43:57,061 --> 00:43:58,209
Yes.

566
00:43:58,794 --> 00:44:00,116
Yes.

567
00:44:00,116 --> 00:44:01,601
Thank you.

568
00:44:24,620 --> 00:45:13,020


569
00:45:36,718 --> 00:45:39,660
You seem to look alright.

570
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:43,953
I'm worried because there seems to be more work to be done than I expected.

571
00:45:43,953 --> 00:45:46,787
As stated in the contract, I need to finish by next week.

572
00:45:46,787 --> 00:45:50,787
Because of that, I think I will have to work through nights too.

573
00:45:50,787 --> 00:45:52,020
Miss Kae In...

574
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,987
with so many things going on, it must be hard.

575
00:45:53,987 --> 00:45:55,396
Don't overdo it.

576
00:45:55,396 --> 00:45:58,356
Director, I think you are caring too much about me.

577
00:45:58,356 --> 00:46:02,413
If the other staff members hear of this, they will protest!

578
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,853
You remember what you promised me, right?

579
00:46:06,953 --> 00:46:07,553
Huh?

580
00:46:07,553 --> 00:46:10,287
I want to fulfill that promise with you today.

581
00:46:10,953 --> 00:46:12,853
Follow me.

582
00:46:14,587 --> 00:46:17,320
Oh, did you see Kae In?

583
00:46:18,887 --> 00:46:20,020
Then, you did well.

584
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:24,120
Although the motive wasn't good, 
you didn't do anything wrong after you moved in.

585
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,987
To be honest, after you met Kae In, she completely changed into a different person!

586
00:46:26,987 --> 00:46:28,720
Then even that's good enough.

587
00:46:30,553 --> 00:46:31,787
I ended it with Kae In.

588
00:46:31,787 --> 00:46:33,653
That's right, Kae in...

589
00:46:35,753 --> 00:46:37,320
You broke up?

590
00:46:37,953 --> 00:46:40,253
I'm going to continue the Dam Arts Center project.

591
00:46:40,687 --> 00:46:42,453
Don't be concerned.

592
00:47:04,353 --> 00:47:06,087
It's yummy.

593
00:47:06,187 --> 00:47:09,420
This is good, and that's good too.

594
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,720
Your expression...

595
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,920
It seems like you don't know if food is entering 
through your mouth or your nose.

596
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:20,620
You know you have no acting skills, right?

597
00:47:22,953 --> 00:47:26,087
We, as friends, in times of difficulty or pain,

598
00:47:26,453 --> 00:47:28,553
should always confide with each other.

599
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,653
Tell me.

600
00:47:30,653 --> 00:47:33,686
Tell me what happened with Jeon Jin Ho.

601
00:47:37,953 --> 00:47:39,520
Everything...

602
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:43,087
It's true that he used me.

603
00:47:44,553 --> 00:47:46,553
From the start...

604
00:47:46,553 --> 00:47:48,920
he didn't...

605
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,220
love me as a woman.

606
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,120
I see.

607
00:47:56,353 --> 00:47:58,453
But Kae In,

608
00:47:58,953 --> 00:48:00,753
do you believe his words?

609
00:48:03,453 --> 00:48:05,953
If it was for success,

610
00:48:05,953 --> 00:48:08,753
then why didn't he go all the way with his "gay lie"?

611
00:48:08,853 --> 00:48:10,387
And...

612
00:48:10,587 --> 00:48:13,653
when he told me he wasn't gay...

613
00:48:13,653 --> 00:48:16,087
do you know what Jin Ho told me?

614
00:48:17,653 --> 00:48:19,720
"I'm sorry.

615
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,953
I am in love with Park Kae In."

616
00:48:28,853 --> 00:48:30,920
That person...

617
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,487
No matter what comes out of his mouth, if you look at his eyes you will know the truth.

618
00:48:35,187 --> 00:48:37,353
Jeon Jin Ho's gaze...

619
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:40,753
is proof of what he said is true.

620
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:53,620
I couldn't sleep for a few days, and now I can't get my head straight.

621
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:56,161
I better go get some sleep.

622
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,620
Aren't you going?

623
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,907
What?

624
00:50:17,907 --> 00:50:20,453
Are you going to meet Kae In?

625
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,087
Jin Ho...

626
00:50:28,153 --> 00:50:30,553
The director wants to see you.

627
00:50:30,553 --> 00:50:32,153
Hey...

628
00:50:32,153 --> 00:50:35,220
It seems that Director Choi hasn't thrown you away just yet.

629
00:50:41,753 --> 00:50:44,253
I thought you would give up.

630
00:50:44,253 --> 00:50:46,220
But you still withheld your feelings.

631
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:48,087
Pretty brave.

632
00:50:50,553 --> 00:50:53,187
The participant will only be allowed one competition entry.

633
00:50:53,187 --> 00:50:55,653
The participant will only be allowed one competition entry.

634
00:50:55,653 --> 00:50:57,587
Are you confident?

635
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:00,320
Fact is...

636
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,387
I don't know right now.

637
00:51:03,453 --> 00:51:05,387
Even so...

638
00:51:05,387 --> 00:51:07,753
everything I can do,

639
00:51:07,753 --> 00:51:09,553
I plan to do the best I can.

640
00:51:12,587 --> 00:51:14,820
To enter Sang Go Jae,

641
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:18,253
did you lie about being gay?

642
00:51:23,587 --> 00:51:26,020
Then,

643
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,753
what are your feelings about Kae In?

644
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,887
That...

645
00:51:32,887 --> 00:51:34,387
wasn't a lie, was it?

646
00:51:35,953 --> 00:51:38,753
Whatever my feelings may be...

647
00:51:38,753 --> 00:51:41,153
what use are they now?

648
00:51:41,153 --> 00:51:46,387
When I first met you, I thought that you were a very capable and dependable person.

649
00:51:46,387 --> 00:51:51,587
I discovered feelings that I previously have never felt from you.

650
00:51:51,587 --> 00:51:52,687
However...

651
00:51:52,687 --> 00:51:55,752
no matter how much I tried to understand it,

652
00:51:55,752 --> 00:51:58,220
without knowing everything, I will be defeated.

653
00:51:59,553 --> 00:52:01,620
I...

654
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:04,187
I've decided that I want to...

655
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:07,720
trust you one last time.

656
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,220
Because I...

657
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:11,387
still have a bit of feelings.

658
00:52:12,953 --> 00:52:15,953
Professor Park will be together with me.

659
00:52:16,953 --> 00:52:18,953
So please do your best.

660
00:52:18,953 --> 00:52:20,987
I'm thankful for that...

661
00:52:20,987 --> 00:52:22,487
but it's okay.

662
00:52:23,287 --> 00:52:25,853
From the start, I have never walked the first step properly.

663
00:52:25,853 --> 00:52:30,053
In the end I will. I have confidence in the end result.

664
00:52:30,053 --> 00:52:35,587
The messed up buttons, why don't you try to re-button it correctly this time.

665
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:38,920
I'm sorry.

666
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:49,920
Hey, don't you think you can forgive Jin Ho now?

667
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,453
Everything's over...

668
00:52:55,453 --> 00:52:57,453
What's there to forgive?

669
00:52:57,453 --> 00:53:00,587
Do you think it's that easy to just forget about your feelings?

670
00:53:02,487 --> 00:53:05,120
Although the going wasn't smooth,

671
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,653
you know that Jin Ho loves you,

672
00:53:07,653 --> 00:53:10,020
and I know, as well as everybody else.

673
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,720
If you're going to keep talking about that, then let's go.

674
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,787
Okay, okay.  Stay seated.

675
00:53:14,787 --> 00:53:16,420
Just have another drink.

676
00:53:21,953 --> 00:53:23,087
Well...

677
00:53:23,087 --> 00:53:25,953
I heard that their office will need to move again...

678
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:28,453
And they will have to forfeit their deposit...

679
00:53:28,453 --> 00:53:31,120
Seems like Jin Ho will be tired out...

680
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,987
Hey, Lee Young Sun!

681
00:53:32,987 --> 00:53:34,853
Fine!

682
00:53:34,853 --> 00:53:36,687
Geez... I can't even say anything...

683
00:53:36,687 --> 00:53:38,887
In front of me...

684
00:53:39,153 --> 00:53:41,420
don't talk about that person.

685
00:53:41,887 --> 00:53:43,953
Please, I'm asking you.

686
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:47,587
I feel more pained whenever I listen to those stories.

687
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,987
So please stop.

688
00:53:50,153 --> 00:53:51,420
Please.

689
00:53:53,687 --> 00:53:56,687
You're still so loyal, really loyal.

690
00:53:56,687 --> 00:53:58,487
Never mind. Just go.

691
00:53:58,487 --> 00:54:01,520
I don't know what the hell you do everyday.

692
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,120
Get up!

693
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,820
Now!

694
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:05,920
Kae In.

695
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,852
Kae In.

696
00:54:08,442 --> 00:54:10,082
Park Kae In!

697
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,739
What am I doing here?

698
00:54:48,801 --> 00:54:50,820
Oh please, just come and take a look.

699
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,009
  I'm sorry. 

700
00:54:52,009 --> 00:54:53,681
Please drop Kae In off at home.

701
00:54:53,681 --> 00:54:56,772
Are you joking with me? 
Are you really going to be like this?

702
00:54:56,772 --> 00:54:59,380
I have no reason to meet with Kae In anymore.

703
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:04,269
Fine! I have to go home, so I'll just leave Kae In here. 
 I don't care about whether someone else takes her somewhere or not.

704
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,535
Kae In, let's wake up, okay?

705
00:55:19,181 --> 00:55:21,040
Oh, Jin Ho!

706
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:26,726
Why were you so stubborn before?

707
00:55:26,726 --> 00:55:30,313
From now on, this is none of my business. 
I will leave it all to you. I'm leaving.

708
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:11,351
Jin Ho...

709
00:56:12,644 --> 00:56:15,191
Just how much did you drink?

710
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,115
Let me give you a piggyback.

711
00:56:45,659 --> 00:56:47,165
Let go.

712
00:56:50,004 --> 00:56:52,703
You can't even walk properly because you're drunk.

713
00:56:55,151 --> 00:56:56,883
Why did you come?

714
00:57:00,401 --> 00:57:02,395
I'm asking why you came!

715
00:57:04,115 --> 00:57:06,078
I don't know either.

716
00:57:07,045 --> 00:57:08,934
I answered Young Sun's call...

717
00:57:08,934 --> 00:57:11,302
And I came without even knowing what I was doing.

718
00:57:13,049 --> 00:57:15,142
Why should you?

719
00:57:16,179 --> 00:57:19,139
Why would you come?

720
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:23,884
Didn't we break up?

721
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:27,133
Therefore, everything's over!

722
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:37,634
Before you fall over, just get a piggyback.

723
00:57:41,622 --> 00:57:43,172
Why should I?

724
00:57:44,413 --> 00:57:46,753
Do you see me as an easy woman?

725
00:57:46,753 --> 00:57:49,289
When you call me, I'll come.

726
00:57:49,289 --> 00:57:51,662
If you say go, then I'll go?

727
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:00,130
From now on,

728
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:02,607
don't ever look for me.

729
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:06,003
Even if you hear that I died,

730
00:58:06,003 --> 00:58:08,824
pretend that you didn't hear about it.

731
00:58:09,038 --> 00:58:11,619
Why would you die?

732
00:58:12,612 --> 00:58:14,623
I'm so pathetic!

733
00:58:17,763 --> 00:58:20,953
I shouldn't have ever met you.

734
00:58:22,618 --> 00:58:25,490
When I broke up with Han Chang Ryul,

735
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:27,711
I just...

736
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:31,620
If I just suffered by myself...

737
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:33,614
now...

738
00:58:34,029 --> 00:58:36,088
I would've been able to laugh like nothing has ever happened...

739
00:58:36,088 --> 00:58:38,813
by myself.

740
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:42,731
Please, just get on my back.

741
00:58:46,587 --> 00:58:49,405
Because I met you...

742
00:58:49,405 --> 00:58:52,344
everything has been messed up.

743
00:58:56,672 --> 00:58:57,996
Let go!

744
00:58:57,996 --> 00:58:59,687
Let go!

745
00:59:14,887 --> 00:59:18,336
 Park Kae In's weather forecast for tomorrow... 

746
00:59:19,287 --> 00:59:21,662
 A moment of clear weather, 

747
00:59:21,662 --> 00:59:23,104
 after breaking up, 

748
00:59:23,104 --> 00:59:26,591
 feels like it's overcast from a thunderstorm. 

749
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:29,421
 A heart that seems like a tornado... 

750
00:59:29,421 --> 00:59:32,834
 Everything is a big mess. 

751
00:59:34,611 --> 00:59:36,569
 And yet... 

752
00:59:36,569 --> 00:59:38,947
  when I'm on this man's back... 

753
00:59:38,947 --> 00:59:42,996
 it makes me feel warm. 

754
00:59:43,658 --> 00:59:45,438
 In the future... 

755
00:59:45,438 --> 00:59:48,011
 there won't be any chances for me to get on his back... 

756
00:59:48,011 --> 00:59:50,467
 ever again. 

757
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:11,991
Kae In.

758
01:00:13,529 --> 01:00:15,544
Fa-Father...

759
01:00:24,152 --> 01:00:27,225
Both of you have been drinking til now?

760
01:00:28,301 --> 01:00:31,148
No... This...

761
01:00:31,148 --> 01:00:33,751
You, really...

762
01:00:34,052 --> 01:00:37,269
Even if you are thoughtless...

763
01:00:37,269 --> 01:00:40,561
I said so many times, no matter how young a child is,

764
01:00:40,561 --> 01:00:43,887
the child will know what to do.

765
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:47,178
You are really beyond help!

766
01:00:48,067 --> 01:00:49,500
I am sorry.

767
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,489
It's late, so just go in.

768
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:56,948
It wasn't Kae In's fault.

769
01:01:00,053 --> 01:01:03,165
The fault lies with me, so why are you apologizing?

770
01:01:10,711 --> 01:01:13,484
I might be wasting my breath,

771
01:01:13,484 --> 01:01:15,521
that I have no right to be saying anything right now,

772
01:01:16,275 --> 01:01:18,028
however...

773
01:01:18,028 --> 01:01:21,426
all Kae In has done is trust me and love me.

774
01:01:21,426 --> 01:01:22,470
What?

775
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:24,416
Since now,

776
01:01:24,416 --> 01:01:28,417
do you know what hardships Kae In has gone through because of you?

777
01:01:28,417 --> 01:01:30,403
Wanting to get her father's praise,

778
01:01:30,403 --> 01:01:32,284
she gave so much effort.

779
01:01:32,284 --> 01:01:34,870
What gives you the right to interfere in our relationship?

780
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:37,882
I don't have a reason to interfere.

781
01:01:38,322 --> 01:01:41,879
However, I can't hold it in because I'm angry.

782
01:01:43,595 --> 01:01:45,623
Are you crazy, Jin Ho?

783
01:01:45,623 --> 01:01:48,200
Kae In was so much in pain,

784
01:01:48,819 --> 01:01:51,801
you have no idea how hurt she was.

785
01:01:51,801 --> 01:01:53,852
Because she was blamed for her mother's death,

786
01:01:53,852 --> 01:01:57,422
that's why she saw her father hating her as a given.

787
01:01:57,967 --> 01:02:00,112
Just like a sinner.

788
01:02:01,444 --> 01:02:03,587
Is she not your daughter?

789
01:02:03,587 --> 01:02:06,034
Why must you let her lead her life as a sinner?

790
01:02:06,034 --> 01:02:07,871
Stop it!!!

791
01:02:10,692 --> 01:02:13,226
What do you know?

792
01:02:13,226 --> 01:02:16,760
From what I see, all your guilt and sorrow,

793
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,495
you have transferred them to your daughter.

794
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,351
Insolent fool...

795
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:32,435
What do you know? To lecture me like this!

796
01:02:32,435 --> 01:02:34,620
Go!

797
01:02:35,887 --> 01:02:38,408
Rejecting to oversee the Dam Arts Center,

798
01:02:40,019 --> 01:02:43,318
it was because you failed in the design of Sang Go Jae, isn't it?

799
01:02:49,376 --> 01:02:51,730
Is that not the truth?
