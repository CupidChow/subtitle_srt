1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,600
   

2
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,600
What am I gonna do?

3
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,200
Oh, no!

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I can tell you're not sleeping.

5
00:00:54,815 --> 00:00:57,679
Hey, Park Kae In. How can you still be at home?

6
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,500
Don't you know

7
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,800
what day it is today?

8
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,600
Also, make sure you put on some nice clothes!

9
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,700
No dragging sneakers in sweats. Hurry! I'm hanging up!

10
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,100
When did you come?

11
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,800
Oppa, how can you reject a sexy woman like me?

12
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,845
Stripping doesn't make you sexy.

13
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,717
Don't tell me... you like men?

14
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,000
You didn't know?

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I like men.

16
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,100
Jin Ho?

17
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Mother, I'm here.

18
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,600
Park Kae In's daily weather forecast.

19
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,900
My parents named me Kae In (sunny) in hopes of me having a sunny life,

20
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,800
but the past 29 years have been one long, 
gloomy rainy season,

21
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,600
and the rain never once stopped.

22
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,800
But starting today, with the sunny sky,

23
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,700
a sunny sky and lovely spring days.

24
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,880
♫  It's ridiculous that I also didn't know.  ♫

25
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,540
♫  I'm secretly looking only at you  ♫

26
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,030
♫  Even though I hate it, no matter what I do,   ♫

27
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,260
♫  even if I try to hide it, I can't stop   ♫

28
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,940
♫  This just won't do.  I continuously want to tell you   ♫

29
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,780
♫  I have fallen for you  ♫

30
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,590
♫  Even if I dream of it, although it's ridiculous    ♫

31
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:47,750
♫  that you're the only one for me, I love you  ♫

32
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,700
Taxi!

33
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,300
What are you doing?

34
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,500
What about you?

35
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,400
I got to it first.

36
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,100
I was first, but your arm is slightly longer than mine.

37
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,900
What are you saying?

38
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,000
I got to it first!

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,800
Are you...

40
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,770
Oh!

41
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,360
♫  It's ridiculous I didn't know either  ♫

42
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,370
♫  I've been secretly watching you.  ♫

43
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,890
♫  Even though I hate it and try to hide  ♫

44
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,350
♫  No matter what I do I can't stop  ♫

45
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,790
♫  This just won't do.    ♫

46
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,700
♫  I continuously want to tell you I have fallen for you.  ♫

47
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,250
♫  Even if I dream of it, although it's ridiculous   ♫

48
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,900
♫  that you're the only one for me, I love you  ♫

49
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,500
Are you going to sit?

50
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,000
Thank you.

51
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,300
Omo!

52
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,900
Where did you just touch?

53
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,500
No, I didn't touch it. 
I was blocking.

54
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,400
What do you mean blocking? 
I know you were ogling my butt!

55
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,400
You were about to sit on my model.

56
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,200
So to protect my model, I had no choice.

57
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
What?

58
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,000
You had no choice?

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,900
So are you saying this plastic thing is 
more important  than my butt?

60
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,400
This piece of plastic is my livelihood.

61
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,400
Wow...

62
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,900
Wow...

63
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,300
Really...

64
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,100
I can't reason with you... Such a pervert.

65
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:09,651
Ahjusshi, please take me to the police!

66
00:05:09,651 --> 00:05:14,120
Fine, let's go to the police station.

67
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,724
But have you heard of "Unintentional accident"

68
00:05:17,724 --> 00:05:19,359
Unintent...

69
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:20,200
What?

70
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,830
Because I didn't intend to do it,

71
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,868
even though I caused you discomfort, 
there's nothing illegal about it.

72
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,000
Also,

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,740
isn't it selfish of you to ask for the bus to
stop at the police station

74
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,308
with all these busy people?

75
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:36,900
Is your butt worth more than these people's precious time?

76
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,400
Yeah. I'm late already as I am. 
This is ridiculous.

77
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:48,300
Let it go. Just forget about it. Come on! 
I'll be late!

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,200
Oh! What are you doing?

79
00:06:01,368 --> 00:06:03,236
That makes it up for me.

80
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,060
- Why don't you answer the phone? 
 - Geez, careful!

81
00:06:59,578 --> 00:07:03,081
We can't get the acrylic right now!

82
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:05,382
I have to call the office.

83
00:07:05,382 --> 00:07:08,018
What do we do? What a disaster...

84
00:07:08,114 --> 00:07:09,354
Hyung!

85
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,700
Cut some off that.

86
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,123
What?

87
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:20,030
We have 20 minutes before the presentation.

88
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,466
Hey, hey!

89
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,167
Did we have any customers?

90
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,138
They'll trickle in eventually.

91
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,206
You didn't have breakfast, right?

92
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,240
Nope.

93
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:57,043
It's a brunch set.

94
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,946
- If not for me, who would take care of you? 
- Thank you.

95
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:05,117
But I have my Chang Ryul.

96
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,686
Oh, that Chang Ryul...

97
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:10,121
The guy who doesn't show up in person 
but just sends a potted plant?

98
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:12,259
Hey!

99
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,294
Did my Chang Ryul send this?

100
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:18,931
Hey, even his taste in potted plants is fantastic!

101
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,068
They look so fabulous!

102
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,204
Fabulous my butt.

103
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:27,273
Shouldn't he be coming here himself and 
show some moral support on a day like this?

104
00:08:28,762 --> 00:08:34,434
Listen, he told me already that he can't come 
today because he has a big presentation to make.

105
00:08:34,434 --> 00:08:37,036
That presentation is being held upstairs.

106
00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:47,045
I don't think there's any point in trying so hard to fix that.

107
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:56,255
Secretary Kim, give them one each.

108
00:09:06,403 --> 00:09:08,170
Are you getting married?

109
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,406
Oh, it's tomorrow!

110
00:09:11,406 --> 00:09:12,673
Yeah, that's right.

111
00:09:12,673 --> 00:09:14,708
I thought

112
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,546
I'd invite all your workers and feed them some hotel food.

113
00:09:17,546 --> 00:09:20,450
What is it, like 5 employees?

114
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,154
You have like 50 or something?

115
00:09:23,154 --> 00:09:25,756
People who clean up your mess for you.

116
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:31,195
I'll see you later.

117
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:39,070
We should go to the wedding, right?

118
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,873
Just to do some networking.

119
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,941
Did we ever get jobs by networking?

120
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:49,111
Aren't you curious to find out who's the woman 
who tied that player down?

121
00:09:50,046 --> 00:09:51,247
We have 7 minutes.

122
00:09:54,147 --> 00:09:57,984
The very first. The best. The biggest.

123
00:09:57,984 --> 00:10:00,520
Those are the values that Mirae Construction strives for.

124
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,391
We will make the Dream Art Center into a landmark representing the city

125
00:10:04,391 --> 00:10:08,428
just like the Sydney Opera House in Australia.

126
00:10:08,428 --> 00:10:10,964
Also...

127
00:10:27,965 --> 00:10:33,503
Oh, yes. Also, by making
 use of a metal screen, we will...

128
00:10:34,138 --> 00:10:37,741
I'm Jeon Jin Ho from M Construction.

129
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:49,052
What you see right now is the lot 
for the new Dream Art Center.

130
00:10:49,052 --> 00:10:51,655
Mountains, river, and a lake.

131
00:10:51,655 --> 00:10:56,026
Could human hands possibly fashion
 anything more beautiful than this?

132
00:10:56,026 --> 00:11:00,363
In this natural beauty the Creator Himself has made,

133
00:11:00,363 --> 00:11:03,167
we'd like to bring in another layer of nature.

134
00:11:07,205 --> 00:11:11,275
Our Dream Art Center will be an eco-friendly place

135
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:15,379
where nature and people, people and culture can communicate

136
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:19,017
and interact in harmony.

137
00:11:19,017 --> 00:11:23,690
A place where you can look at the landscape. 
A center that becomes part of the landscape.

138
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,393
The key concept of our company's proposal...

139
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,168
is "harmony."

140
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,730
 Yes, harmony. 

141
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:43,570
 That's right. 

142
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,420
It's depressing to eat ramen alone, right?

143
00:11:47,462 --> 00:11:49,698
It's depressing to eat ramen alone, right?

144
00:11:49,698 --> 00:11:52,068
Well, if you lift this up like this, you have a mirror.

145
00:11:52,068 --> 00:11:56,038
When you're bored, you can have a conversation with  yourself in the mirror.

146
00:11:56,038 --> 00:11:58,558
And if you lift this up, there is a laptop.

147
00:11:58,558 --> 00:12:02,943
You can watch a movie and listen to music.

148
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:07,714
First in the country. First in the world. A new concept of a multiplayer.

149
00:12:07,714 --> 00:12:10,636
It's called the Personal (Kae In) Table.

150
00:12:18,093 --> 00:12:21,697
Hey, kids, where are your parents who can purchase things?

151
00:12:21,697 --> 00:12:24,000
Mom? Mom!!

152
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,935
Hey, kids! Kids!

153
00:12:26,935 --> 00:12:29,103
Dang.

154
00:12:29,103 --> 00:12:31,807
Bring your moms.

155
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,511
Excuse me.

156
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:40,247
What you've got is absolutely my sort of thing.

157
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:47,554
But...

158
00:12:47,554 --> 00:12:51,093
I'm sorry, but I have a boyfriend.

159
00:12:51,093 --> 00:12:53,861
Ah, no, I didn't mean it that way.

160
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:56,164
I mean this.

161
00:12:57,932 --> 00:12:59,501
The Personal Table?

162
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:04,739
I would like to place an order for that 
computer desk, 30 to begin with.

163
00:13:04,739 --> 00:13:06,241
Really?

164
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:11,413
Secretary Lee.

165
00:13:11,413 --> 00:13:14,048
I'll pay you back! I promise!

166
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,951
What?

167
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:19,253
How come the interest is bigger than the borrowed amount?

168
00:13:19,253 --> 00:13:21,122
Hey, Won Ho! Hey!

169
00:13:21,122 --> 00:13:22,857
Yes, President. Yes.

170
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,127
Can you take care of this order?

171
00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:28,562
Oh, yes.

172
00:13:29,663 --> 00:13:31,531
- Please come this way. 
- Serve him some coffee.

173
00:13:31,531 --> 00:13:33,099
Yes. Yes.

174
00:13:36,703 --> 00:13:40,140
Chang Ryul, I pulled one off!

175
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,190
Why is that man here?

176
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,458
This is cool.

177
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,894
It's perfect for people living in a small place like me.

178
00:14:00,894 --> 00:14:04,229
What a brilliant idea...

179
00:14:04,229 --> 00:14:09,501
Warm, cozy, and sophisticated single life. That's me right there!

180
00:14:09,501 --> 00:14:13,805
It's fooling you with the many words. In a nutshell, it's "vanity."

181
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Hyung, you think you could have a proper meal on this?

182
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,700
It's more fitting for dog food, really.

183
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,100
You're being harsh again.

184
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:31,100
I bet the person who made this is an egotist that has never made a meal for someone

185
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,700
That may be true.

186
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,900
And has no idea about what it's like to have a relationship with someone.

187
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,000
If it's a woman, she's probably full of vanity and hysteria...

188
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,200
- ...and a spinster. 
- Yeah, a spinster.

189
00:14:43,227 --> 00:14:45,663
Oh, I'm sorry.

190
00:14:45,663 --> 00:14:47,499
You? From this morning?

191
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:54,035
So this is the woman who ruined our model?

192
00:14:54,035 --> 00:14:55,470
What?

193
00:14:56,304 --> 00:15:01,709
Full of... vanity.... and... an... ego... tist?

194
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,400
And what? Hysterical spinster?

195
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:09,384
I'm that furniture designer, Park Kae In.

196
00:15:09,384 --> 00:15:12,987
You can't even remember what you heard just five seconds ago?

197
00:15:12,987 --> 00:15:15,691
Just what do you know about furniture?

198
00:15:15,691 --> 00:15:19,261
A dinner table is where a family comes together 
to wind down after a tiring day.

199
00:15:19,261 --> 00:15:21,430
It is a place of communication.

200
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,699
So how can you make a dinner table like this?

201
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,600
In this world,

202
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:31,238
there are many without someone to have dinner with.

203
00:15:31,238 --> 00:15:34,041
And I wouldn't sell you anything anyway, you pervert!

204
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:37,444
As for buying something from a 
designer with such half-baked ideas...

205
00:15:37,444 --> 00:15:39,446
...I'm not at all interested either.

206
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,210
Geez...

207
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,550
So annoying...

208
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:52,200
And now, we will announce the winning proposal for the Dream Art Center.

209
00:15:55,366 --> 00:15:57,801
Almighty God, to whom my mother is so devoted,

210
00:15:57,801 --> 00:16:01,605
I even went to early morning prayers this morning. 
You must not let me down.

211
00:16:01,605 --> 00:16:05,075
If you don't grant us this, I'll leave the Church...

212
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,700
... and become a Buddhist. 
So please, please grant us this.

213
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,700
The final winner is...

214
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,805
"Flight" by Mirae Construction, led by
 Director Han Chang Ryul.

215
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:41,060
 Mirae Construction? There was a rumor that the winner was already decided on. 

216
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:45,580
 - But still, I had my doubts. You know...
 - They cut everyone else out. 

217
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:53,200
Oh, right. Remember when we were fixing 
our model and he said there was no need?

218
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,150
This was all rigged from the start.

219
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,980
Hi, In Hee.

220
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,450
- Did you tell? 
  - Huh? 

221
00:17:14,452 --> 00:17:19,957
Today, I'm taking action for sure. 
So don't worry and just wait, alright?

222
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,900
Stop just giving me empty words!

223
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,800
Hello? Hello?

224
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,500
She always hangs up while I'm still talking.

225
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,700
Secretary Kim.

226
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,100
Give me one more invitation.

227
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,800
Oh, hello! Here... here...

228
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:45,190
Oh, Chang Ryul.

229
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,200
How was your presentation today?

230
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,362
It went well, of course! You know me...

231
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,000
How's your business going?

232
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,400
It's good, of course.

233
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:56,236
Thanks for the plant.

234
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,600
Uh, yeah...

235
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,700
Umm...

236
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,930
Can we go somewhere and talk for a while?

237
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,040
Yep.

238
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:15,178

239
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,500
I don't know...

240
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,900
how or where to start to say this,

241
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,700
I really don't know...

242
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,200
What is it?

243
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,700
Chang-Ryul! What's this for? 
What are you doing?
 Looks like you're going to propose...

244
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
Chang Ryul!

245
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,300
Are you really...?

246
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,900
- Oh, no... 
- Wait, wait...

247
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,800
I don't think...

248
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,400
Oh... my heart is ready yet...

249
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:08,412
Wait, wait... Please give me... 
just a little... more time.

250
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,500
Han Chang Ryul!

251
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,900
Chang Ryul, do you know this man?

252
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,100
What did you mean before the presentation?

253
00:19:21,263 --> 00:19:23,425
When you said I didn't need to fix my model?

254
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,500
Was it you this time as well?

255
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,900
Did you fix the results?

256
00:19:30,064 --> 00:19:32,534
Was it you or your old man?

257
00:19:32,534 --> 00:19:34,436
My old man?

258
00:19:37,206 --> 00:19:38,000
Hey!!

259
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,900
Do you think you're still the son of the 
President of Mirae Construction?

260
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,400
I've been going easy on you for the sake of your late father.

261
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,100
But how dare you speak disrespectfully about my father?

262
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,900
Just because you have a mouth

263
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,000
doesn't mean you can talk crap.

264
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,400
What the hell do you think you're doing?!

265
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Well...

266
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,161
Did you want to fight or something?

267
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:05,300
Like a fistfight? Go ahead, then!

268
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:11,369
Listen up, Jeon Jin Ho...

269
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:13,237
At a time like this, you should be asking for help.

270
00:20:13,237 --> 00:20:15,700
"Help me out, please!" 
That's what you should be saying.

271
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,800
Or else even: "Please save me!"

272
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,700
You haven't learned your lesson yet.

273
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,000
I can see that.

274
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,400
I'll call you later.

275
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,100
Oh... Chang Ryul...!

276
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:38,600
I guess your presentation bombed today. 
Just accept your loss like a man.

277
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,500
Mind your own business.

278
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,100
But it  is  my business. 
I'm marrying him.

279
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,100
- Marry? 
- Yes!

280
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,100
He was about to propose to me and you rudely interrupted.

281
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,100
Are you going to take responsibility?

282
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,300
It's tomorrow!

283
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,400
And when is your wedding?

284
00:20:58,566 --> 00:21:02,720
Well if... As I was just being proposed to...

285
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,804
... at the latest...

286
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,200
this fall maybe...

287
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,600
But why do I have to explain that to you?

288
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,357
Look here,

289
00:21:10,357 --> 00:21:12,300
what kind of a man would run away by himself in a situation like this

290
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,383
leaving his future bride behind?

291
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,900
Chang Ryul isn't that kind of man at all, OK?

292
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,704
Argh! After ruining the moment of a wedding proposal, how rude!

293
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,100
With the on-site labor costs and the presentation prep,

294
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,200
our company's bank account has been in the red for a while now.

295
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,297
We'll be okay as long as we meet the deadline.

296
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,900
If we meet it then it's all resolved.

297
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,200
But the problem is right now!

298
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,800
Hey...

299
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,500
We might not be able to pay our employees this month!

300
00:21:55,124 --> 00:21:57,500
Let's take on the Dam Art Gallery new construction project.

301
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,800
Where did that come from?

302
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,000
That's the only way out.

303
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,100
We can't handle a project of that size.

304
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,100
If you do that, we'll really hit the bottom!

305
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,900
Just find out what Director Choi of the art gallery is doing tomorrow.

306
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,600
You're so stubborn.

307
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,300
Got it! You should go to Chang Ryul's wedding tomorrow.

308
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,997
The girl that he's marrying...

309
00:22:21,997 --> 00:22:24,300
is a curator at the Dam Art Gallery.

310
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,500
Since she works for him,

311
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,400
Director Choi should be there too.

312
00:22:29,937 --> 00:22:32,900
Wait, this may put Chang Ryul in favor.

313
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,900
We'll face it anyhow.

314
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,000
Hyung!

315
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,500
How could you chase Hye Mi out the veranda ?

316
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,800
In the office I told you to call me chief.

317
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,600
Forget all that and just fight me today.

318
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,400
Man to man!

319
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,500
Look this way!

320
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,600
Get closer.  Closer!

321
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,900
Put more feeling into it!

322
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,157
Great! That's good!

323
00:22:59,928 --> 00:23:01,496
Hey.

324
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,600
Back then...

325
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,500
that was a proposal, right?

326
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:07,035
Well you said he went down onto his knees!

327
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,600
Then he was proposing to you.

328
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,900
No, I didn't mean for you to kneel down.

329
00:23:13,075 --> 00:23:14,176
Focus on the upper body!

330
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,500
Get closer!

331
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,400
Don't be embarrassed! That's good!

332
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,000
Something about these guys creeps me out here.

333
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,400
You really are an ignoramus, aren't you?

334
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,600
Don't you know it's all the rage?

335
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,800
Metrosexual?  Never heard that?

336
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,500
OK, final shots now!

337
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,500
Imagine you want to kiss him.

338
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,400
Make like you want to give him a kiss on the cheek.

339
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,500
That's it!

340
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,400
A little more...

341
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,100
More!

342
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,100
More!!!

343
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,500
Aigoo!!

344
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,700
It's done.

345
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,300
Thanks for the hard work!

346
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,200
See you again next time.

347
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,600
Bye.

348
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,500
Hey, In Hee!

349
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,600
Who are those young hunks?

350
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:55,517
So lewd, when you're getting married tomorrow.

351
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,300
Did you get a facial?

352
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,500
You're glowing!

353
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,100
It's really soft!

354
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,900
Did the bed arrive?

355
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,200
Oh yes, it did.

356
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,200
Thanks! It arrived at our new home last night.

357
00:24:06,228 --> 00:24:11,232
Show your gratitude by putting it to good use! 
That's why I made it really strong.

358
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,500
Hyung, you don't have any personal feelings for Hye Mi?

359
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,500
No. None at all.

360
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,700
Then why did you take a look?

361
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,208
Look at what?

362
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,476
I know you took a look at Hye Mi's breasts !

363
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,700
Wowee!  Did you really?!

364
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,182
Hey!

365
00:24:26,182 --> 00:24:28,100
That's a misunderstanding.

366
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,500
Where I'm concerned, Hye-Mi is...

367
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,020
like my little sister.

368
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,600
Exactly! So what were you doing looking at her breasts?!

369
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,200
I even heard that that's when you wrote a marriage vow to her!

370
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:40,000
Well, she went frantic, burst into tears and 
said I had to take responsibility!
 What else could I do?

371
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,100
I was only 14 back then.

372
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,300
You know,

373
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,800
I get even jealous over the memories you and Hye Mi share!

374
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,500
You realize that?

375
00:24:47,637 --> 00:24:49,072
Let's drink.

376
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,900
Today is the last day, can't you sleep over?

377
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,800
You!

378
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,500
It's making me wanna cry.

379
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,800
Are you In Hee's mom or something?

380
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,100
Not so long ago, you two were pulling at each other's hair.

381
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,300
When did we?

382
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,500
You don't remember?

383
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,200
Surely you do?!

384
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,400
Back in grade school, In Hee had a crush on the president of the student council,

385
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,700
but he gave you chocolate on Valentine's Day,

386
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,500
So you guys had a nasty cat fight.

387
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,100
There was a time I was that popular?

388
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,900
Popular my ass.

389
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,100
By the way, did you sell a lot of  furniture?

390
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,600
I got my first supply contract.

391
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,900
Only a contract...

392
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:21,900
That's all.

393
00:25:22,484 --> 00:25:26,021
You have to do better, 
you even took out a loan behind your father's back.

394
00:25:26,021 --> 00:25:28,700
By the time he comes back in six months, 
I'll be done paying back the loan.

395
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,100
I'll have pulled off the perfect crime.

396
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,900
You sure will.

397
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,700
At any rate, tell me the rest of your story.

398
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,500
Did Chang Ryul propose to you or not?

399
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,100
Chang Ryul... did what?

400
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,300
In Hee...

401
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,600
I think I have good news too.

402
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,300
Throw the bouquet to me tomorrow, okay?

403
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,500
Shouldn't we practice catching the bouquet?

404
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,900
All right.

405
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,900
Just a moment.

406
00:26:06,664 --> 00:26:07,898
You said you were telling her today!

407
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,900
Do you want to die?

408
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,200
In Hee!

409
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,600
It's not what you think...

410
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,100
If you can't tell her, I shall.

411
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
No need.  I'm here outside her house right now.

412
00:26:21,045 --> 00:26:25,382
Chang Ryul, do you know what's scarier than an act of God?

413
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,000
A man that's indecisive!

414
00:26:32,187 --> 00:26:33,600
Why are you listening on other people?

415
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,400
I'm not really...

416
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,100
It's just that this is weird.

417
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,100
Weird?  What's weird?

418
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,100
There is something strange going on.

419
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,500
Huh?

420
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,700
You didn't get a wedding invitation either, did you?

421
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,900
Have you seen the guy she's marrying?

422
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,800
But they're marrying after only dating for a month.

423
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,400
We ought to cut her a little slack.

424
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,743
She's coming.

425
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,100
It's okay.

426
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,600
What is it?

427
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,200
Why are you staring at me like that?

428
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,900
What a great catch he must be

429
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,329
for you to keep us from seeing him, we were wondering.

430
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:17,633
Are we going to faint in shock tomorrow at your wedding?

431
00:27:17,633 --> 00:27:19,000
Who is it?

432
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,500
Who is he?

433
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,800
Is he a chaebol's son?

434
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,200
Is he a celebrity?

435
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,100
- Oh, Chang Ryul... 
- Gosh, is that Chang Ryul?

436
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:36,600
Oh, alright.

437
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,700
I guess you're getting the proposal 
you didn't get this morning.

438
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,100
You're so silly.

439
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,600
Change your clothes first.

440
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,000
Clothes...

441
00:27:58,253 --> 00:28:01,748
Kae In. I'm getting married tomorrow, to In Hee.

442
00:28:05,499 --> 00:28:09,329
No, no... That's too direct.

443
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,000
Kae In...

444
00:28:13,086 --> 00:28:18,178
To be honest with you, the man 
In Hee is marrying tomorrow...

445
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,400
Is it a diamond? Is it big?

446
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,600
I still didn't get to see the ring yet!
 I'm going to die from a heart attack.

447
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:39,105
Good luck!

448
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,200
Chang Ryul, what are you doing tomorrow?

449
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,500
Huh?

450
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,600
Why?

451
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,700
Well, if you have time,

452
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,456
let's go on a date for once.

453
00:28:58,456 --> 00:29:01,400
It's been a while since we went on a date.

454
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,000
Tell you what!  Let's go to In Hee's wedding together.

455
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,600
Oh my! Chang Ryul!

456
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,600
Oh! Oh!

457
00:29:18,475 --> 00:29:20,112
Kae In...

458
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,300
I'm begging you...

459
00:29:24,045 --> 00:29:25,951
You and I, will you...

460
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,759
will you...

461
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,700
Say it...

462
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,800
...break up with me?

463
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,000
Let's end it.

464
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,798
Now.

465
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,500
You're leaving?

466
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,735
You should just stay and sleep over here at Kae In's.

467
00:30:11,735 --> 00:30:13,400
My new house is closer to my work.

468
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,100
It'll be more comfortable there.

469
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,600
Why don't we just stay here and
 hear about Kae In's proposal.

470
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,700
Hmm...

471
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,100
Isn't it bed time for Joon Hyuk yet?

472
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,900
You're right!

473
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,700
I guess I'll let the two love birds be.

474
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,700
Wait. Let me pack up.

475
00:31:07,435 --> 00:31:08,228
 ­ 

476
00:31:08,228 --> 00:31:12,800
Did I do something wrong?

477
00:31:13,389 --> 00:31:14,988
I...

478
00:31:17,467 --> 00:31:20,329
was never in love with you.

479
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,600
What?

480
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,477
To me you were like...

481
00:31:25,477 --> 00:31:26,500
You were like...

482
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,400
...a pitiful puppy, totally wet and miserable

483
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,700
wandering round the neighborhood

484
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,292
on a rainy day.

485
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,800
A pitiful puppy?

486
00:31:47,055 --> 00:31:49,231
It wasn't love.

487
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,500
I think I just felt sorry for you.

488
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,700
And what's more...

489
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:00,700
Kae In, wait, I'm not done talking. Listen to what I have to say!

490
00:32:12,485 --> 00:32:14,020
Sorry...

491
00:32:15,255 --> 00:32:17,524
All this time,

492
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,200
you've been trying not to hurt me,

493
00:32:21,361 --> 00:32:23,930
and I was too dim-witted to realize it.

494
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,900
I can't say goodbye, but take care.

495
00:32:50,988 --> 00:32:52,700
If I win, hyung,

496
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,800
you have to go on a date with Hye Mi

497
00:32:55,028 --> 00:32:56,363
Nah, punk.

498
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:01,800
"If I win, you have to give up on Hye Mi!" is what you should say.

499
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,000
You guys still don't know what love is!

500
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,100
I can only be happy if Hye Mi is happy. 
That's what love is all about!

501
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:14,500
That's why I hope you two live your love 
happily and leave me out of it.

502
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,700
Promise me! If I win, 
you will go on a date with Hye Mi!

503
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,700
Okay, so this is how it's going to be.

504
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,000
If Jin Ho wins,

505
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,900
you stop working for us.

506
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,600
That will never happen!

507
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,600
And I won't let it happen either.

508
00:33:38,943 --> 00:34:09,919

509
00:34:28,221 --> 00:34:29,522
Kae In...

510
00:34:37,633 --> 00:34:40,336
I told you I smelled something fishy!

511
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,300
Hey, you really don't have good taste in men!

512
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:50,012
Just accept that this is for the better and just get over it.

513
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,400
The great Chang Ryul?

514
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:56,000
Great my ass!  He's nothing but a full-blown idiot.

515
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,200
That's enough.  I'm the stupid one.

516
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,400
Park Kae In is the stupid one.

517
00:35:03,526 --> 00:35:06,266
Hey, hey, you're not that bad!

518
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,700
You... You may not know,

519
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,000
but there were a lot of boys that liked you.

520
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,100
Ever since we were in elementary school

521
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,900
I've liked you all this time.

522
00:35:19,174 --> 00:35:20,109
You had no idea, right?

523
00:35:21,277 --> 00:35:23,778
Of course I knew!

524
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,500
I like you too, friend!

525
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,300
Ah! Not like that...

526
00:35:31,154 --> 00:35:34,190
I mean... as man and woman.

527
00:35:36,992 --> 00:35:39,160
If I told you now to come to me,

528
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,229
would you do that?

529
00:35:45,801 --> 00:35:47,312
Hey!

530
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:50,200
I am going to kiss you now.

531
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,100
If you don't want me to, stop me.

532
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,600
Hyung...

533
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,300
Hyung! You know how much I like you, right?

534
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,100
Yeah... I do, so let's get those clothes off you.

535
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,200
What exactly are you doing?

536
00:37:33,152 --> 00:37:35,220
I love you, Kae  In.

537
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,062
What?

538
00:37:39,062 --> 00:37:40,400
I love you, I said!

539
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,135
Hey! Crazy bastard!

540
00:37:55,135 --> 00:37:59,200
Right, I'm crazy. Because of you I'm really crazy!

541
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,542
You! How can you?

542
00:38:02,542 --> 00:38:07,200
I just... got dumped by... Chang Ryul...

543
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,300
...and I trusted you as a friend!

544
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,880
But this is my heart! My true heart! 
Can't you see it?

545
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,400
This won't do.

546
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,800
Tonight, I'll kill you and kill myself too.

547
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,500
Yaaah, wait a minute.

548
00:38:25,962 --> 00:38:33,500
Stop that! I think you're too drunk now.

549
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,300
Hye Mi...

550
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:57,104

551
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,300
Congratulations on being fired.

552
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,933
Go on the date.

553
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,600
Ah!

554
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,576
What the heck?

555
00:39:28,211 --> 00:39:29,612
Oh, it's the pervert.

556
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,900
Proposal girl?

557
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,200
Didn't you say you were getting married? 
And you switched to another man already?

558
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,100
If you don't know anything, could you just be quiet?

559
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,300
Have you ever heard of 'circumstantial evidence'?

560
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,800
That seems to fit the case here perfectly.

561
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:48,696
Hyung!

562
00:39:56,673 --> 00:39:58,975
Where are you going?

563
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,900
Circumstantial evidence...

564
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,600
What the heck are you thinking?

565
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,100
What you wrote on the mirror, do you really mean that?

566
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,800
You're not that kind of person.

567
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,400
Hey, Kim Tae Hoon.

568
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,800
You promised you wouldn't do this.

569
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Hyung! Please, don't be like this!

570
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,300
I'm only guilty of love!

571
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,500
What a jerk you are!

572
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,000
Mind your own business!

573
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,600
He says he's in love!

574
00:40:27,636 --> 00:40:29,771
That's not what this is about.

575
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,300
Hyung! Don't leave!

576
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,300
You know nothing about love!

577
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:51,401
Excuse me.

578
00:40:51,401 --> 00:40:52,905
So what is it now?

579
00:40:52,905 --> 00:40:56,607
I'm sorry about this morning's misunderstanding.

580
00:40:56,607 --> 00:40:59,477
What misunderstanding was that?

581
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,700
I can see you have a troubled love life.

582
00:41:09,954 --> 00:41:14,157
No matter what my troubles may be, 
 they can't be as bad as yours.

583
00:41:15,193 --> 00:41:15,893
Ehh?

584
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Tomorrow... No...

585
00:41:18,062 --> 00:41:20,064
...it's today now... what are you doing?

586
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,400
Today...

587
00:41:22,633 --> 00:41:25,737
I'm going to a close friend's wedding. Why?

588
00:41:25,737 --> 00:41:27,371
Umm... A wedding?

589
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,100
Listen carefully.

590
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,300
It's about a friend of mine.

591
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:37,749
She had a boyfriend, but didn't know 
he was planning to marry another woman.

592
00:41:37,749 --> 00:41:40,251
She went to that wedding.

593
00:41:40,251 --> 00:41:42,200
Huh, come on now...

594
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,700
That's complete nonsense.

595
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,800
How could any woman be that stupid?

596
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,431
Taxi!

597
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,800
This time, I really do have first call on the cab.

598
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,600
But tell me... What happened to that
 woman when she got to the wedding?

599
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,977
Well, you'll find that out soon enough.

600
00:42:13,421 --> 00:42:15,723
What is he talking about?

601
00:42:52,233 --> 00:42:54,536
Tomorrow...

602
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,400
the person In Hee is marrying...

603
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,600
it's me.

604
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,400
Kae In, I'm truly...

605
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:10,300
I'm truly sorry. I don't know what to say...

606
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,300
Also...

607
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:17,224
I know it's not my place to ask, but...

608
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,100
For tomorrow's wedding,

609
00:43:22,397 --> 00:43:25,366
it would be better if you didn't come.

610
00:43:26,701 --> 00:43:28,636
Please do as I ask.

611
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,200
 ­ 

612
00:44:54,171 --> 00:44:56,206
Put all the office staff on to blocking this woman.

613
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,700
Front entrance, back entrance, 
all the entrances. Cover the lot. Okay?

614
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,500
- But ir, isn't that going too far?  
- Just hurry up and get on with it!

615
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,804
I guess I just need to find a girl with a mole next to her nose.

616
00:45:16,531 --> 00:45:18,633
Life's a dirty business.

617
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,600
It even makes us go to Chang Ryul's wedding.

618
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,200
But it's worth it if it gets us to meet Director Choi in person.

619
00:45:26,343 --> 00:45:27,978
What's wrong with you?

620
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:32,100
The bottom of my t-shirt got stuck in my zipper when I went to pee.

621
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,500
It just won't budge.

622
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:34,984
Seriously, can't take you anywhere.

623
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,700
Let me see.

624
00:45:39,326 --> 00:45:41,324
This is a bit embarrassing.

625
00:45:41,324 --> 00:45:42,352
Oh, yeahh.

626
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,800
Ahhh...

627
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:48,000
Oh good...

628
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,200
Very nice.

629
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,200
Ah, we'll just take the next one.

630
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,800
Please continue what you were doing.

631
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,200
Uhh, no no.

632
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,000
We're all through. Do please get in. Get in.

633
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,607
Ah, you're all through. I see...

634
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,500
Oh yes, how did it go with Tae Hoon last night?

635
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,000
Ah, don't even mention it.

636
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:28,800
We ended up going to a motel. I thought I was going to die.

637
00:46:29,265 --> 00:46:31,303
That's why I left first.

638
00:46:31,303 --> 00:46:33,948
You do that next time. I'm out.

639
00:46:34,216 --> 00:46:37,952
It must have been quite fun, the two of you in a motel!

640
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,100
Chang Ryul, you'll get tired. Put me down...

641
00:47:05,283 --> 00:47:07,118
Shall I?

642
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,100
I'm not tired at all. I'm fine.

643
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,300
For believing me and following me all the way to this point,

644
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,500
thank you very much.

645
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:25,100
The vows we'll take now, I'll keep them forever.

646
00:47:25,202 --> 00:47:27,471
If you have something to say, say it now.

647
00:47:27,471 --> 00:47:29,700
You'll love only me, right?

648
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,174
Promise.

649
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:35,400
From now on, both your body and heart...

650
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,400
are all mine, right?

651
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,600
All I have is yours.

652
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:44,900
From now on, I, Han Chang Ryul, will live for you, In Hee.

653
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,992
Chang Ryul,   I love you!

654
00:47:47,992 --> 00:47:50,794
I love you, too.

655
00:47:51,229 --> 00:47:53,164
Hey!

656
00:47:54,732 --> 00:47:55,401
Young Sun!

657
00:47:55,401 --> 00:47:56,800
You...

658
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,800
I see you've gone totally crazy!

659
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,873
Did you botox your brain?

660
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,100
Lee Young Sun!

661
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,900
You have many guys.

662
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,500
Why did you have to pick Kae In's man?

663
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,100
It's easy for you to steal men and 
trash them right? Well, not for Kae In!

664
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,600
Young Sun, wait a minute. 
Let me talk to you.

665
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,000
Shut up, you bastard!

666
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,500
Argh, seriously!

667
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,100
And Kae In was so happy that 
she was going to catch your bouquet...

668
00:48:20,666 --> 00:48:22,333
Dirty bitch...

669
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:26,100
Young Sun, I'll make it up to Kae In for
what I've done for the rest of my life.

670
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,241
Why?

671
00:48:27,241 --> 00:48:29,743
Are you scared that I'll just mess the whole ceremony up?

672
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,300
Why would I when Kae In will do it herself?

673
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:35,200
We already told Kae In everything!

674
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,400
Kae In knows?

675
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,800
Chang Ryul told her.

676
00:48:42,825 --> 00:48:43,900
Then he didn't see her to propose last night, huh?

677
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,000
Then he didn't see her to propose last night, huh?

678
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,200
Both of you are really great.

679
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,300
How can you do this and still call yourselves human?

680
00:48:58,571 --> 00:49:00,406
Hey, Kim In Hee.

681
00:49:00,406 --> 00:49:02,700
Listen to me carefully.

682
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:06,800
If I were you, I'd cancel this wedding right now.

683
00:49:09,415 --> 00:49:10,300
Young Sun!

684
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,200
Young Sun!

685
00:49:12,618 --> 00:49:14,620
Young Sun  ...

686
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,100
Kae In, are you home?

687
00:49:20,156 --> 00:49:22,900
Are you okay?

688
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
It's a long story.

689
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,900
I've got to  the subway station, but now...

690
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,365
do I need exit 3 or exit 4?

691
00:49:29,365 --> 00:49:31,134
It's exit 3 of line 6.

692
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,336
What?!

693
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:35,800
Kae-In! 
Instead of coming here, 
would you stay right there and wait for me?

694
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,100
I'll come and find you, okay?

695
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,000
Hello?

696
00:49:40,778 --> 00:49:43,113
Ah, Park Kae In...

697
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,000
Ahjumma!

698
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,100
Ahjumma!

699
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:51,200
-  Thank you very much!   
- Please pick up,  pleeeease...

700
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:58,129
You sure you really told Kae In everything?

701
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,400
I already told you I did.

702
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,600
Don't worry too much.

703
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,900
We're about to start, so bride and groom please get ready.

704
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,100
Yes, just a moment.

705
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:14,200
I am here, right? 
Don't worry too much.

706
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,700
I love you.

707
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,400
Hey, wait a minute.

708
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,700
Turn round this way, please...

709
00:50:23,757 --> 00:50:25,659
Go in.  There's no mole.

710
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,700
Hold up!

711
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,000
There's Auntie Kae In!

712
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,175
Oh! Where?

713
00:50:43,175 --> 00:50:44,919
Kae In!

714
00:50:44,919 --> 00:50:45,800
Kae In!

715
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,400
Kae In!

716
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,391
You're here!

717
00:50:47,391 --> 00:50:49,694
Oh my, look how cute you are!

718
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,600
My face is totally bloated, right? I wonder if they'd let me catch the bouquet?

719
00:50:53,796 --> 00:50:55,331
Kae In...

720
00:50:55,331 --> 00:50:58,100
What? Is my face that bad?

721
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,500
Kae In...

722
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:03,800
Oh!

723
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,800
What?

724
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,600
Why is that man here?

725
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,200
Who?

726
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,800
What a jerk.

727
00:51:10,879 --> 00:51:13,328
I see he dumped the boy because he got himself a new boyfriend.

728
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,500
What are you talking about?

729
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:18,330
Yesterday, that tall man...

730
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,600
was breaking up with his boyfriend in cold blood.

731
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,600
What are you talking about right now?

732
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,000
He's into men.

733
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,300
Men?

734
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,600
Men.

735
00:51:28,662 --> 00:51:29,830
Oh... Really?

736
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,500
He's so good looking.

737
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,400
Oh, what am I talking about?

738
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,500
Kae In...

739
00:51:34,535 --> 00:51:35,769
You know...

740
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,600
Oh, it's about to start!

741
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,106
Kae In, hold on!

742
00:51:40,106 --> 00:51:41,500
What? Hurry, hurry!

743
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,000
Ow, my stomach!

744
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,200
My stomach!

745
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,000
There must be something wrong with me.

746
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,300
- What should we do?
- Let's get to a hospital.

747
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,600
Excuse me, can someone help us?

748
00:51:52,286 --> 00:51:53,353
Hey, which way are you looking at?

749
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,100
Stomach! My stomach!

750
00:52:57,450 --> 00:53:03,730
Next, the bride and groom will greet each other.

751
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,370
- Hey!
  - What's going on? 

752
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:30,930
 This is nuts. 

753
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:46,400
Kae In, wh-wh-why are you...

754
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:13,730
I'll receive the punishment I deserve later...

755
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:17,910
Kae In, could you please leave for now?

756
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:21,120
What punishment? Is marriage always assumed just because you dated?

757
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,890
Look at her, seriously! Hey, Kim In Hee!

758
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:24,550
- Secretary Kim! Secretary Kim! 
 - Hey!

759
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:30,130
Hey, let go of me! Let go! Hey, you b**** and bastard!

760
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:38,220
You b**** and bastard!

761
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,770
Hey, that woman... Isn't she that woman from that time?

762
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:44,360
Let go!

763
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:49,310
There must've been a misunderstanding. We'll continue with the ceremony.

764
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:54,190
Let go of me!

765
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:58,910
- You can't let them get out until the wedding is over. Got it? 
 - Yes, sir.

766
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:03,470
She definitely had a mole on her nose. When did she remove it?

767
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:08,960
It's gone. Geez!

768
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,200
Hey! Did you see that? That's how pathetic Han Chang Ryul is.

769
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,510
Whoa, look at him ignoring you altogether when things have come to this.

770
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:21,100
You should consider yourself lucky you didn't marry him!

771
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:26,500
- You can't leave!
 - What did we do wrong anyway?

772
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:33,970
That man who's getting married right now...

773
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:38,770
He was dating me up until yesterday.

774
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:50,930
That bride is a friend I've had for the last 10 years.

775
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:59,470
She said she was getting married, so I came to congratulate her...

776
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:06,320
I even made her a new bed wishing she'd be a happy bride.

777
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:11,640
What a dense idiot! How can you be in the dark and come all the way here when things have gone this far?

778
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:17,300
What an idiot. That b****. She always had a new guy.

779
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:21,650
 Of all the men out there, how dare she takes her friend's man? I oughtta! 

780
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:24,270
That's not true. Please?

781
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:27,880
 Didn't she date Yoon Choong Sil up until a month ago? 

782
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,720
 No, no, it wasn't Yoon Choong Sil. 

783
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,330
- It's not me. 
 - Was it Dong Gun? 

784
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:35,910
 Gosh! She had so many men that I'm getting all confused! 

785
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:46,420
Hyung, Director Choi is leaving.

786
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,850
Those guys are from Jiwook Construction.

787
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:05,830
Geez, things will go awry if we made any hasty move.

788
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,780
You said you knew someone at Dam Art Gallery, right?

789
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:15,250
The Dam Art Gallery? Yeah, right.

790
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:16,810
I'll call you later.

791
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,730
That's not all. She fixed everything about her face. She did her eyes and got a nose job.

792
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:27,080
What are you doing? They can hear you in the wedding hall.

793
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,840
Hey! Oh, no!

794
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:33,190
You! Oh, no. Geez...

795
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:35,430
- Geez! 
 - Let go of him!

796
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:41,700
Hey, this is bad. Let's go!

797
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,120
Who the heck are you guys?

798
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,510
Huh? Which one of you is my friend?

799
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:58,180
So, are you the one who supposedly dated me? What the heck is going on?

800
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:03,850
No, no. We're sorry. Our apologies.

801
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:05,900
- Our apologies. 
 - We'll press charges for this!

802
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:10,020
We're sorry... sorry...

803
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:14,520
In Hee! In Hee!

804
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,340
In Hee, wait!

805
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,450
Satisfied?

806
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:27,030
It would've been...

807
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:30,120
nice if you had told me in advance.

808
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:34,320
I'm sorry for messing up your wedding.

809
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:37,940
It's okay. I won't feel bad anymore either.

810
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:38,990
You!

811
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:42,110
You'll have to feel bad for the rest of your life, b****!

812
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:44,480
Come.

813
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,870
Hey!

814
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:47,750
In Hee, are you okay?

815
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:49,680
Let me see...

816
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:58,040
Yeah.

817
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:07,410
Thank you. Hyung, call me at the basement parking.

818
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:35,160
Hey, walk slowly.

819
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,660
Gosh, crazy b****.

820
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:39,780
How could she throw away a 10-year-old friendship over a man?

821
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:43,430
Stand up straight. You must've done something good in your past.

822
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:46,590
That's why you dodged that jerk.

823
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:49,780
And as they say, a sedan will drive up once you get rid of a junker.

824
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,570
Young Sun...

825
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:55,510
Yeah, what? Say it. Go ahead.

826
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:57,790
I'll go alone from here.

827
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:01,080
Why? Will you be okay?

828
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,470
I won't be okay.

829
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:05,780
Of course, I won't be. How would you feel?

830
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:07,270
Bye.

831
01:01:47,387 --> 01:01:52,191
