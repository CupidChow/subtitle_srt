1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,500
I am sorry.

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,400
What...

3
00:00:08,479 --> 00:00:09,847
are you sorry for?

4
00:00:10,308 --> 00:00:12,414
I...

5
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:16,568
am in love with Park Kae In.

6
00:00:21,106 --> 00:00:23,203
You are happy, right?

7
00:00:26,287 --> 00:00:29,428
Then, that's enough.

8
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:08,369
Chang Ryul!

9
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:11,277
Chang Ryul!

10
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:21,657
Episode 12  
  The secret of Sang Go Jae 

11
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:40,178
Doctor...

12
00:01:40,178 --> 00:01:41,495
is he okay?

13
00:01:41,495 --> 00:01:42,497
Yes.

14
00:01:42,597 --> 00:01:44,403
There's no physical damage, but...

15
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:45,773
I think he might have brain damage.

16
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:50,187
We'll have to wait and see.

17
00:02:58,743 --> 00:03:03,596
Hey, hey... I only met you because I thought you were gay.

18
00:03:03,596 --> 00:03:06,722
If you weren't gay I wouldn't have met up with you.

19
00:03:08,341 --> 00:03:12,514
It's real sad. Just because I'm always with Jin Ho, 
that's why you can't see how macho I am.

20
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:14,285
Once girls fall for me,

21
00:03:14,285 --> 00:03:16,305
they can't fall out of love.

22
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:18,763
You're kidding. Just shut up.

23
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,261
Watch.

24
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:21,673
Unni, watch.

25
00:03:21,673 --> 00:03:23,409
Why?

26
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:33,571
Please, continue eating.

27
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,781
They have a boyfriend...

28
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:39,793
What did you do just now?

29
00:03:39,793 --> 00:03:42,396
Don't kid yourself.

30
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:46,227
When you were in school, you didn't do well right?

31
00:03:49,048 --> 00:03:50,151
Hey, but unni,

32
00:03:50,151 --> 00:03:53,093
I like it that you and I made up.

33
00:03:53,093 --> 00:03:57,338
Unni, let's go out and play! We are in Jeju Island after all. We must play til our hearts' content!

34
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:59,968
Your nose is so slanted! How do you want to get married?

35
00:03:59,968 --> 00:04:02,752
Still wanna get married?

36
00:04:10,107 --> 00:04:11,904
Kae In.

37
00:04:15,084 --> 00:04:16,556
Kae In...

38
00:04:17,326 --> 00:04:20,467
Kae In isn't here.

39
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:23,279
I saw her leave with Chang Ryul.

40
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:04,825
Yes, Jin Ho?

41
00:05:04,825 --> 00:05:07,062
Where are you?

42
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,472
Well, you see...

43
00:05:11,142 --> 00:05:12,667
Beside you...

44
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:14,484
is someone there?

45
00:05:14,484 --> 00:05:18,829
I'm with Chang Ryul.

46
00:05:29,994 --> 00:05:33,102
He didn't even hear the full story and just hung up...

47
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:47,275
Kae In!

48
00:05:47,275 --> 00:05:48,211
Are you okay?

49
00:05:48,211 --> 00:05:50,139
What about you? Are you hurt?

50
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:51,880
No, I'm not hurt.

51
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,027
Does your head hurt?

52
00:05:54,027 --> 00:05:57,001
When you fell, you hit your head.

53
00:05:57,604 --> 00:05:59,476
I think I'm okay...

54
00:05:59,476 --> 00:06:01,214
It's alright if you're not hurt.

55
00:06:01,214 --> 00:06:03,253
You were unconscious for almost 5 hours.

56
00:06:03,253 --> 00:06:04,824
Are you really okay?

57
00:06:04,924 --> 00:06:06,829
I told you I'm okay.

58
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:09,771
I was sleeping for that long...

59
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:12,344
But all that time you were here?

60
00:06:12,344 --> 00:06:15,788
Well, a person who got hurt because of me is unconscious...

61
00:06:15,788 --> 00:06:18,327
Where can I go?

62
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:20,367
Why'd you do it?

63
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:21,403
What?

64
00:06:21,403 --> 00:06:23,576
That could have been a big accident!

65
00:06:23,576 --> 00:06:25,381
Big accident, yeah right.

66
00:06:25,381 --> 00:06:30,393
I should sacrifice my body just for you.

67
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:32,265
Chang Ryul...

68
00:06:33,135 --> 00:06:35,808
I'm kidding.

69
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:37,848
Kae In,

70
00:06:37,848 --> 00:06:39,519
don't  let it be a burden.

71
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:43,329
When a lady's in trouble, a man should jump in and save her.

72
00:06:44,436 --> 00:06:45,804
Thank you.

73
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:47,441
Thank you.

74
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:53,022
It just happens to be the last thing I say to you...

75
00:06:53,022 --> 00:06:57,836
It's better than saying goodbye.

76
00:06:57,837 --> 00:07:00,375
Let's leave.

77
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,991
Now that I see you here alone,

78
00:07:18,991 --> 00:07:23,038
it seems that Kae In is still with Chang Ryul.

79
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,583
They've been together for so long,

80
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:30,092
I guess they need more time to break off with each other.

81
00:07:30,092 --> 00:07:32,465
A glass please.

82
00:07:32,465 --> 00:07:34,705
Can you leave?

83
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:37,245
I would like to drink alone.

84
00:07:37,245 --> 00:07:43,162
If you look at Kae In and Chang Ryul, 
they have a lot in common.

85
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:48,042
They are both very emotional and can't let go of things easily.

86
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:50,716
I think I told you I wanted to drink alone.

87
00:07:50,716 --> 00:07:55,462
Don't you think we are alike?

88
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,176
We have to have something we desire to have.

89
00:08:00,176 --> 00:08:05,440
What we crave for, we must have. 
Whatever we don't want, trash it.

90
00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:14,884
So have you told everything to Director Choi?

91
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,533
Why did you have to go that far?

92
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:24,176
It would have been good enough to stay good friends.

93
00:08:24,176 --> 00:08:26,349
Because that's lying.

94
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:31,027
Were you really that kind of pure man?

95
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:38,113
If you didn't want to lie to anyone, you 
wouldn't have pretended to be gay.

96
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:43,095
That's what I'm curious about.

97
00:08:43,095 --> 00:08:45,536
Why did you pretend to be gay,

98
00:08:45,536 --> 00:08:48,644
and why did you enter Sang Go Jae?

99
00:08:53,857 --> 00:09:00,640


100
00:09:13,914 --> 00:09:15,217
 Answer me. 

101
00:09:15,217 --> 00:09:17,724
 Just say it. 

102
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:22,703
 If not, are you saying that you're really gay? 

103
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:28,653
 That's right... 

104
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:32,498
 Whatever kind of punishment you give me, I'll receive it. 

105
00:09:32,498 --> 00:09:35,373
 It started as a small thing, 

106
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:40,082
 but I'm sorry I didn't correct it long ago. 

107
00:09:41,657 --> 00:09:44,297
 If you tell me to give up the Dam Arts Center project, 

108
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:45,668
 then I will. 

109
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,640
 But, 

110
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,183
 I can no longer lie to you. 

111
00:09:51,183 --> 00:09:54,190
 I can no longer lie to you. 

112
00:09:57,635 --> 00:09:59,572
 Foolish guy. 

113
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:03,048
 If he wanted to lie, 

114
00:10:03,384 --> 00:10:06,525
 I would be willing to be fooled. 

115
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:20,264
If you still have a headache, 
then you should get examined more.

116
00:10:20,264 --> 00:10:22,437
I told you not to worry.

117
00:10:22,437 --> 00:10:25,800
To tell you the truth, I didn't die when I saw 
you go off holding hands with Jin Ho,

118
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,751
so I won't die just because of this small matter.

119
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,979
Call it my last vestige of pride.

120
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:38,000
If it's not today, then I won't have any 
other chance to ask for forgiveness.

121
00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:47,428
 The doors are closing. 

122
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,633
Shall I take a guess?

123
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:51,867
Why you entered Sang Go Jae?

124
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:54,029
I think it's time to stop, Kim In Hee.

125
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:54,733
Why?

126
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:57,700
Do you think I'll mess with your Achilles heel?

127
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,510
I said let's stop this.

128
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,167
Originally the Dam Arts Center Project

129
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:03,538
was handed over to Professor Park.

130
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:04,900
That's why, Jin Ho,

131
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,507
if only you could get in contact with Professor Park-

132
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,568
Watch what you say...

133
00:11:10,568 --> 00:11:11,633
Was I too...

134
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:14,633
harsh?

135
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,167
Jin Ho!

136
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,800
Jin Ho!

137
00:11:43,688 --> 00:11:45,433
I thought you were giving up Kae In.

138
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:47,400
It seems like you haven't.

139
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,807
So does that mean we're still on the same boat?

140
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:56,522
You're making this really hard, Kim In Hee.

141
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,586
Jin Ho!

142
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:00,205
Jin Ho!

143
00:12:01,294 --> 00:12:04,767
You didn't even hear what I had to say and you just hung up!

144
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:07,367
Does that mean you were with In Hee until now?

145
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:08,733
Then, Park Kae In,

146
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:11,400
why are you always with Chang Ryul?

147
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,318
I...

148
00:12:12,318 --> 00:12:14,199
I was in a situation with no other choice.

149
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:15,013
Today, Chang Ry-

150
00:12:15,013 --> 00:12:18,167
To you, is there ever a situation 
where you have another choice?

151
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:20,964
Why can you still not get away from that guy?

152
00:12:20,964 --> 00:12:23,167
Because you are still like that,

153
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,633
that's why Chang Ryul's father is still coming to your house!

154
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:28,253
I haven't done anything dishonest with Chang Ryul!

155
00:12:28,253 --> 00:12:29,333
And today,

156
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,900
I met with him to end things clearly.

157
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,933
You sure took a while to end it.

158
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:36,967
Don't talk to me like that.

159
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:39,167
I ended it, and when I turned around,

160
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:42,098
Chang Ryul got hurt because of me.

161
00:12:42,098 --> 00:12:43,267
Because he got hurt because of me,

162
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:46,300
I couldn't just leave an unconscious person!

163
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,800
You two look like you had a lot of fun...

164
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,633
If you're finished with him, why are you still seeing him?

165
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:53,467
Why are you saying such heartless things?

166
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:54,467
No.

167
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:56,400
I don't understand such a thing and get angry.

168
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,447
I'm that petty.

169
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:13,267


170
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,400
For telling me the truth,

171
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,067
do you have the heart to not regret it?

172
00:13:49,859 --> 00:13:51,367
After all,

173
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:54,533
you didn't have to tell me.

174
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:58,500
Honestly speaking,

175
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,867
I did think about not telling you.

176
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:04,233
However, I...

177
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:09,611
believe it's not the right way to treat you, 
who have such deep feelings for me.

178
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:14,322
And you treat the one I love with such respect too.

179
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:19,267
Why didn't you tell me earlier, Jeon Jin Ho?

180
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,233
However...

181
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:24,900
although it was for a short time,

182
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,367
I was happy.

183
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,800
I...

184
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,967
Since I was young,

185
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:35,533
because I'm different than others,

186
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:38,346
I was always hurting.

187
00:14:38,346 --> 00:14:40,067
And then I realized.

188
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:41,599
Oh!

189
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:44,233
Even if I don't hurt myself,

190
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:46,233
others will hurt me.

191
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:49,267
I'll live a painful life.

192
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:50,733
That's why...

193
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:53,300
I have to at least

194
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,933
pity myself.

195
00:14:57,767 --> 00:14:59,733
I'm sorry.

196
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,536
For giving you a scar.

197
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:05,267
No.

198
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,500
The other time, in front of Chang Ryul,

199
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,000
saying that you were gay...

200
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,600
I remember your face.

201
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,300
You...

202
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:19,733
felt sympathy for me?

203
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:26,167
Now,

204
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:28,900
all that time,

205
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,267
although it might be hard,

206
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:33,600
what happened, I'll try to forget.

207
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,167
Lying like that for me.

208
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:41,633
I don't want to lose a friend like that.

209
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:11,467
Oh, you! You smell!

210
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:14,100
Really?

211
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,167
Hey!

212
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:16,967
How much did you have to drink?

213
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:17,633
I don't know.

214
00:16:17,633 --> 00:16:20,067
How did I get here?

215
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:23,100
What happened between you and Jin Ho?

216
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:28,400
What's going on between you two?

217
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,100
We're exhausted from helping you out.

218
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,500
It's because of Chang Ryul...

219
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,633
Why are you talking about that Han Chang Ryul again?

220
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:36,133
No.

221
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:38,933
Chang Ryul got in an accident because of me.

222
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:41,167
So I stayed at the hospital with him.

223
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,700
He didn't even listen to what I had to say and just hung up!

224
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,567
So,

225
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:45,500
you came all the way here,

226
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,433
and you're with Chang Ryul. Even I would have gotten mad!

227
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:49,700
That's right.

228
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,133
You can get mad.

229
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:52,300
However,

230
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,700
seeing his behavior really makes me mad!

231
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,667
You just get too emotional always... Your character...

232
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,167
But it looks like Jin Ho really likes you.

233
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:06,333
I used to be like that when I was dating in the beginning.

234
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:11,000
Every time my husband was with another woman, 
I had so many thoughts of breaking up.

235
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,400
Aren't you like that?

236
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,867
If Jin Ho is like that with another girl, don't you get mad?

237
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,667
Of course I get mad!

238
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:18,067
Right!

239
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:20,433
Ah... Lee Joong Ki spoke so well!

240
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:22,900
Such conviction!

241
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,967
How do I...

242
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,367
Say it...

243
00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:28,500
Did you check everything I told you to check?

244
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,167
No.

245
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:29,867
Ah!

246
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:31,667
Jeon Jin Ho.

247
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,200
Let's talk for a bit.

248
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,300
Kae In was at the hospital because of me.

249
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,100
I know.

250
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,667
Now I've really given up Kae In.

251
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,867
It was because of that talk that 
we got in the accident yesterday.

252
00:17:52,867 --> 00:17:54,633
I heard it too.

253
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:57,033
Did you want to meet up because of that?

254
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:59,967
The fact that my father went to Sang Go Jae,

255
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:02,833
I heard it for the first time yesterday from Kae In.

256
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,967
I know it no longer had anything to do with me.

257
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:09,833
But if you feel bad because of that,

258
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:12,100
I'm sorry.

259
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:18,933
By saying all this to you,

260
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:21,533
I feel kind of bad.

261
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:24,433
But because Kae In is hurting because of me,

262
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:26,633
I no longer want to see it.

263
00:18:26,633 --> 00:18:29,067
That girl's heart,

264
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,300
don't pay attention to it anymore.

265
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:33,733
Punk.

266
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:39,633
Do you know you're being a bit ridiculous right now?

267
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:42,867
In my career,

268
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:46,000
I never even once gave up.

269
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,900
But because of Kae In,

270
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,133
and she had no other choice but 
 to be with me because of the accident...

271
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:53,867
are you saying you don't like that either?

272
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:56,667
If you have nothing else to say, then I'll be leaving.

273
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:59,800
Ahh, I'm jealous.

274
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,700
Getting mad and fighting.

275
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,733
Up until now, I've never had that when I was with Kae In.

276
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:11,300
Because Kae In always held it in.

277
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:15,567
Are you okay, where you got hurt?

278
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:17,567
What?

279
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:20,867
Are you worried about me?

280
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:24,333
Aren't you angry because of love?

281
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:28,000
Anyways, because you did that for my girl,

282
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,100
thank you.

283
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,067
Hey, Jeon Jin Ho,

284
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:33,067
even though my love was stolen by you,

285
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:37,433
I won't give up on the project.

286
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:40,700
This time, I don't have any plans to hide a rock in my fist,

287
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,833
I'll fight fair and square.

288
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,933
Be waiting for it.

289
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,900
I will.

290
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:03,500
She doesn't even pick up the phone.

291
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:29,500
Why aren't you picking up your phone?

292
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,233
It's up to me.

293
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:41,400
What?

294
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,733
Do you have something to say?

295
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:49,133
For example, saying sorry because you got mad?

296
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:51,967
Don't you have anything to say?

297
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:55,500
For example, saying sorry because you got me mad?

298
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:01,193
Ah! Where are you going?

299
00:21:04,293 --> 00:21:06,469
Ah! Really!

300
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,327
When did all these things appear?

301
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:12,967
When I came here last time, it wasn't here.

302
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:15,343
Why are you caring, you're not going to buy anything...

303
00:21:15,343 --> 00:21:16,833
I'm going to buy something!

304
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:17,833
What are you going to buy?

305
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,180
Why do I have to tell you that?

306
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,004
Then why did you say to come here?

307
00:21:22,004 --> 00:21:25,033
I don't know what to buy, that's why I'm here!

308
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:29,167
You're taking words right out of my mouth.

309
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,513
You're going to buy this?

310
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,953
Not even my mother, at her age, wears these.

311
00:21:35,953 --> 00:21:36,767
Then,

312
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:40,063
what kind of style would she like?

313
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:43,133
You've come here to buy her something?

314
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:46,847
Well, even this isn't enough,

315
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,200
but I want to show my true feelings.

316
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,733
but I want to show my true feelings.

317
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:58,133
Is it too tacky?

318
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,473
I'll be going.

319
00:22:06,473 --> 00:22:07,533
Aigoo.

320
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:09,467
What is this? I want a watch!

321
00:22:09,467 --> 00:22:10,879
You won't even get me a watch.

322
00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:11,850
I'm sorry.

323
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,533
Please come again.

324
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:16,767
The prize for this must be a watch!

325
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:20,000
So are you saying we should try this together?

326
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:22,667
Why would I do that with you?

327
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:25,712
Then are you going to play with some 
other ahjusshi at this couple event?

328
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:26,633
No!

329
00:22:26,633 --> 00:22:28,642
I can't even do these kinds of things.

330
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,233
Of course you can't.

331
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:33,800
You don't want to use your brain at all.

332
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,330
Then are YOU good at it?

333
00:22:35,867 --> 00:22:38,133
You think I won't be able to do that?

334
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:40,358
Well I haven't seen it, so...

335
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:43,900
Do you want to find out?

336
00:22:48,213 --> 00:22:51,933
Jin Ho, I think it's not that complicated but should be simple.

337
00:22:51,933 --> 00:22:54,433
You're noisy, just be quiet.

338
00:22:54,433 --> 00:23:00,372
8, 7, 6, 4. It might not be something so confusing!

339
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:03,568
Wait, I'm telling you this isn't it.

340
00:23:03,568 --> 00:23:05,633
These things are really simple.

341
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,333
What?

342
00:23:11,953 --> 00:23:13,400
What is this?

343
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,700
Please hold this up.

344
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,133
When do we get these watches?

345
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:23,333
First, let's take the picture.

346
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,367
Right here.

347
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,833
Okay.

348
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:32,433
You should smile brighter.

349
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:37,467
Why did you want to meet up?

350
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:39,669
The Dam Arts Center's concept...

351
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:41,333
do you know what is is?

352
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:42,900
The main concept is...

353
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,077
to have a traditional design, isn't it?

354
00:23:45,077 --> 00:23:46,667
It's Sang Go Jae.

355
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:48,167
Sang Go Jae?

356
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:49,900
Sang Go Jae is Kae In's house.

357
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,500
But why?

358
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,900
The first concept President Choi 
chose for the Dam Arts Center,

359
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,533
it was Sang Go Jae.

360
00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:58,000
How do you know this?

361
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,299
Director Choi's secretary told me.

362
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:05,200
The Chairman still doesn't know though.

363
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,867
Why do you think Jin Ho entered Sang Go Jae?

364
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:12,633
The house he entered by chance...

365
00:24:12,633 --> 00:24:15,233
was it Sang Go Jae?

366
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:16,867
Let's see... Then...

367
00:24:16,867 --> 00:24:19,167
Jin Ho knew that,

368
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:22,267
and that's why he entered Sang Go Jae?

369
00:24:22,267 --> 00:24:25,000
It seems you're finally getting it.

370
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,367
Then being like that with Kae In,

371
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:29,300
it was all because of that?!

372
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,367
Or...

373
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:33,733
how can you explain all these coincidences?

374
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:35,900
Jeon Jin Ho...

375
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,567
Jeon Jin Ho...

376
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:42,567
you can't even be compared with him. He's so much smarter.

377
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:45,367
Jin Ho,

378
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:48,433
does he truly love Kae In?

379
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:53,267
That son of a... Jeon Jin Ho!

380
00:24:53,267 --> 00:24:54,900
The weather is so nice.

381
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,100
Yes...

382
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,967
I didn't do it...

383
00:25:03,967 --> 00:25:05,733
I got wet.

384
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:11,389
Jin Ho...

385
00:25:11,389 --> 00:25:13,333
You don't want to eat more?

386
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:14,933
Say "ahhh".

387
00:25:16,633 --> 00:25:18,833
Hurry up and give it to me.

388
00:25:26,367 --> 00:25:28,667
Ah, this is great!

389
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:31,600
I'm so happy!

390
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,765
That's because you're with a cool guy like me.

391
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:35,500
Oh!!!

392
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,633
Oh, really!

393
00:25:36,633 --> 00:25:39,600
How can you say such a thing with your own mouth?

394
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,933
You didn't know how great I was?

395
00:25:41,933 --> 00:25:44,167
That's why you like me.

396
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,500
Who likes you?

397
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,100
You don't like me?

398
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,300
Are you just toying with me?

399
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,400
I love you.

400
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,733
Jeon Jin Ho!

401
00:25:53,733 --> 00:25:56,133
I love you!

402
00:25:56,133 --> 00:25:59,900
As much as heaven and earth!

403
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,800
Han Chang Ryul!

404
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:08,767
What are you going to do by finding him?!

405
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:11,400
I'm going to go kill Jeon Jin Ho!

406
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,033
So what's going to be solved?

407
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,267
You might not be able to kill him,

408
00:26:16,267 --> 00:26:19,167
but if you talk about how you know why he went to Sang Go Jae...

409
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:22,300
"Okay, I get it. I'm sorry."

410
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,533
Do you think Jin Ho will say that?

411
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:27,267
Please, think about what you're going to do!

412
00:26:27,267 --> 00:26:29,500
Don't act according to your emotion.

413
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,167
Then what do you expect me to do right now?!

414
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:35,633
You need to find an opportune time.

415
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:37,933
At the pivotal point,

416
00:26:37,933 --> 00:26:41,367
expose to everyone what kind of person Jin Ho is.

417
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:01,000
Go home.

418
00:27:01,633 --> 00:27:02,500
What?

419
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,233
Your mother knows that your seminar is ending today.

420
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:08,767
But she'll be sad if she finds out that you came here first.

421
00:27:08,767 --> 00:27:10,333
That's right, Jin Ho.

422
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:11,867
Before you get married,

423
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:14,867
upsetting your mother is not a good idea..

424
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:17,033
What marriage?  Don't overdo it.

425
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:18,533
Just be still.

426
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:22,667
When a man gets caught in the middle, he must step up.

427
00:27:24,933 --> 00:27:27,700
Then go in and rest.

428
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,800
Drive home safely.

429
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,033
There's just new drama right here.

430
00:27:45,033 --> 00:27:46,733
It's drama all right.

431
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:50,500
Oppa...

432
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,600
I heard you went to Jeju Island with that girl?

433
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,767
You went to the seminar, but she was there too?

434
00:27:55,767 --> 00:27:57,100
You two played together, didn't you?

435
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,800
Why did you go there?

436
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,300
Do you want to continue these useless acts?

437
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:07,633
Hello.

438
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,033
How could you...

439
00:28:10,033 --> 00:28:12,233
disappoint your mother so much?

440
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:14,333
I told you how much I didn't want you to,

441
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:15,833
yet you went to Jeju Island?

442
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,333
I didn't go for a vacation.

443
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:19,600
It was all for work.

444
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,367
I know why you're being like this,

445
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,567
but please trust me about Kae In.

446
00:28:25,567 --> 00:28:27,300
She's a good person.

447
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,833
I'm sure that you will like her.

448
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,600
I...

449
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,800
can never like that girl.

450
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,167
Being connected to the Han family,

451
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:37,500
I don't even want to think about it.

452
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,833
I don't like her!

453
00:28:43,508 --> 00:28:50,953


454
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:14,768
Hey!

455
00:29:14,768 --> 00:29:16,388
It's over.

456
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:18,833
Go to China directly!

457
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:20,233
I cannot.

458
00:29:20,233 --> 00:29:21,764
What?

459
00:29:21,764 --> 00:29:23,567
You can't go?!

460
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:26,300
What have you done to say that you can't go?!

461
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,667
Getting Professor Park's daughter stolen from you,

462
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:30,867
what good have you done?!

463
00:29:30,867 --> 00:29:31,732
Father...

464
00:29:31,732 --> 00:29:33,000
Won't you let go of this?!

465
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,233
Father...

466
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:37,232
Did you think all that time I got hit by you 
because I didn't have any strength?

467
00:29:37,232 --> 00:29:39,432
I am the future chief architect.

468
00:29:39,432 --> 00:29:42,833
You can't treat a 5 year old like this too!

469
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:43,700
You punk!

470
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,100
If you had done good, then would I be like this?!

471
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,000
I'm saying that I'll do better from now on!

472
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,600
You got Professor Park's daughter stolen from you,

473
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,100
what good have you done?!

474
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,767
Kae In...

475
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:54,300
I will get her back.

476
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,533
Miss Park,

477
00:29:55,533 --> 00:29:58,210
can you do it?

478
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,667
Just sit back and watch.

479
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:00,433
So,

480
00:30:00,433 --> 00:30:02,067
the project you've gotten ready until now,

481
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:04,300
I will do my utmost for it.

482
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,367
What did you say?

483
00:30:05,367 --> 00:30:06,726
Look at this punk!

484
00:30:06,726 --> 00:30:09,469
I have to devise a project with a new concept.

485
00:30:09,469 --> 00:30:11,376
I need more people.

486
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:12,367
Also,

487
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:13,700
for the sake of secrecy.

488
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,333
please allow me a separate office.

489
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:18,233
Do you really have something?

490
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,567
I will let you know later.

491
00:30:20,567 --> 00:30:23,940
But please promise me one thing.

492
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,767
What?

493
00:30:25,767 --> 00:30:28,700
The situation between me and Jeon Jin Ho,

494
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,533
please do not get involved.

495
00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:41,367
This is all the information about Sang Go Jae.

496
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,533
Why do you only have this?

497
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:51,267
Professor Park doesn't want the design to be made public.

498
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:54,833
What's out in the public, this is all of it.

499
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:56,367
By chance,

500
00:30:56,367 --> 00:31:00,533
did you get any good ideas from Jeju Island?

501
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:03,667
Anything that has to do with Sang Go Jae...

502
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:05,950
From now on, if you talk nonsense,

503
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,767
know that you're going to be fired.

504
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:13,167
In one hour, I'll be having a meeting about the Dam Arts Center, so get ready.

505
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:14,600
Wait outside.

506
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,500
Yes.

507
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:26,067
Hello.

508
00:31:26,067 --> 00:31:28,851
It's the person who called earlier, Han Chang Ryul.

509
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:31,491
Have you decided?

510
00:31:31,491 --> 00:31:32,762
Hey, we're in big trouble.

511
00:31:32,762 --> 00:31:33,965
We're in big trouble.

512
00:31:33,965 --> 00:31:35,022
What's wrong?

513
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:39,781
I just talked to the landlord, and he said 
we had to move out by this month.

514
00:31:39,781 --> 00:31:40,519
What?

515
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:42,090
He said he sold the office.

516
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:44,594
And that new person will be moving in.

517
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:52,151
He hasn't raised the rental fees for the past 3 years...

518
00:31:52,151 --> 00:31:53,787
What are we going to do?

519
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,424
I'll go talk to him.

520
00:31:55,424 --> 00:31:56,995
There's no use.

521
00:31:56,995 --> 00:31:59,237
He has already signed a contract with the new tenant.

522
00:31:59,237 --> 00:32:00,973
What are we going to tell them?

523
00:32:03,883 --> 00:32:06,522
I'll tell them to get the table ready for lunch.

524
00:32:06,522 --> 00:32:08,628
Get it ready for 2.

525
00:32:09,465 --> 00:32:11,569
Are you having a guest?

526
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,644
I'm planning on eating with Park Kae In.

527
00:32:14,644 --> 00:32:15,917
Go to the room where she's working,

528
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:17,686
and please call Park Kae In for me.

529
00:32:19,126 --> 00:32:20,527
I understand.

530
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,298
You've worked hard.

531
00:32:22,298 --> 00:32:23,235
Thank you.

532
00:32:28,251 --> 00:32:30,054
Go to the Director.

533
00:32:30,054 --> 00:32:31,725
He wants to have lunch with you.

534
00:32:33,532 --> 00:32:34,267
With me?

535
00:32:34,267 --> 00:32:36,170
Your skills are amazing.

536
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:38,712
From a person who always ate alone,

537
00:32:38,712 --> 00:32:40,382
you even get invited.

538
00:32:40,886 --> 00:32:42,200
Now,

539
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,926
you are finding fault in everything I do.

540
00:32:43,926 --> 00:32:46,131
You've never used your own strength to fight for something.

541
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,273
You always...

542
00:32:48,273 --> 00:32:50,778
depend on luck alone.

543
00:32:50,778 --> 00:32:52,251
Unlike me.

544
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:54,823
Just for the smallest things,

545
00:32:54,823 --> 00:32:56,661
I have to slave

546
00:32:56,661 --> 00:32:58,299
and slog for it.

547
00:32:58,299 --> 00:32:59,635
So...

548
00:33:00,273 --> 00:33:02,410
is that why you hate me so much?

549
00:33:02,646 --> 00:33:04,750
Is that why you stole Chang Ryul?

550
00:33:05,153 --> 00:33:06,055
If you look at it that way.

551
00:33:06,055 --> 00:33:08,258
So...

552
00:33:08,258 --> 00:33:10,732
is that why you want to steal Jin Ho too?

553
00:33:10,732 --> 00:33:15,659
At Jeju Island, when Jin Ho and I 
were like that in the elevator,

554
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:16,618
it seems like you were jealous.

555
00:33:16,618 --> 00:33:18,087
No.

556
00:33:18,087 --> 00:33:19,925
I'm not jealous.

557
00:33:20,228 --> 00:33:22,231
Because I have faith in Jin Ho.

558
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:25,340
With those little things,

559
00:33:25,911 --> 00:33:28,415
my old friend Kim In Hee,

560
00:33:28,685 --> 00:33:29,920
I pity you.

561
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,324
Are you pitying me right now?

562
00:33:31,324 --> 00:33:33,529
You're acting that way.

563
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:38,042
You have too much confidence, Park Kae In.

564
00:33:38,345 --> 00:33:40,817
Because Jin Ho said he loves you,

565
00:33:40,817 --> 00:33:43,423
it seems like you've got the world.

566
00:33:44,562 --> 00:33:47,000
But don't be too proud.

567
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,907
Because you trusted Chang Ryul like that,

568
00:33:48,907 --> 00:33:50,677
but you got betrayed.

569
00:33:51,047 --> 00:33:52,516
Jin Ho is different.

570
00:33:52,516 --> 00:33:56,559
Fine, he's far smarter than Han Chang Ryul.

571
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,766
His ambitions are great too.

572
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,741
But isn't it strange?

573
00:34:01,741 --> 00:34:06,155
Why someone like him would love someone like you?

574
00:34:06,155 --> 00:34:07,624
If you want to put me down,

575
00:34:08,025 --> 00:34:09,863
go ahead.

576
00:34:10,565 --> 00:34:12,103
The more you do that,

577
00:34:12,472 --> 00:34:14,743
the more pathetic you will be.

578
00:34:22,968 --> 00:34:25,439
You don't know Jeon Jin Ho as much as I do.

579
00:34:29,754 --> 00:34:31,130
Please come.

580
00:34:35,303 --> 00:34:36,604
Please sit.

581
00:34:44,996 --> 00:34:46,765
I wanted to ask you something.

582
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,946
You knew you were like that with Jeon Jin Ho,

583
00:34:52,249 --> 00:34:55,088
yet you told me about one-sided love.

584
00:34:55,391 --> 00:34:57,429
And made me call you One-sided love Teacher.

585
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,469
Miss Park Kae In,

586
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:01,506
you have a lot to be sorry about.

587
00:35:01,506 --> 00:35:04,950
Well, you see, Director,

588
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:08,795
I've never thought that Jin Ho was a man who could love me.

589
00:35:08,795 --> 00:35:10,029
Either way,

590
00:35:10,798 --> 00:35:13,872
I'm very confused and stressed right now.

591
00:35:13,872 --> 00:35:15,244
So...

592
00:35:15,244 --> 00:35:18,988
I am feeling a little down.

593
00:35:18,988 --> 00:35:20,725
So I hope we can clear the air over lunch.

594
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:25,472
I am really sorry.

595
00:35:29,118 --> 00:35:30,620
Congratulations.

596
00:35:32,494 --> 00:35:33,129
Huh?

597
00:35:33,129 --> 00:35:35,701
That you graduated from the One-sided Love club.

598
00:35:38,176 --> 00:35:40,213
Your one-sided love...

599
00:35:41,217 --> 00:35:43,188
it was Jeon Jin Ho, right?

600
00:35:45,965 --> 00:35:47,366
Yes.

601
00:35:48,204 --> 00:35:50,040
As much as me,

602
00:35:50,344 --> 00:35:52,848
you've seen the difficulty of love.

603
00:35:54,756 --> 00:35:56,291
That's a relief.

604
00:35:58,533 --> 00:36:00,268
Thank you.

605
00:36:00,268 --> 00:36:03,277
For telling me... like this.

606
00:36:03,277 --> 00:36:05,383
If you're really thankful,

607
00:36:05,987 --> 00:36:08,725
have lunch with me.

608
00:36:09,129 --> 00:36:11,266
Occasionally.

609
00:36:11,266 --> 00:36:14,307
Of course. Anytime.

610
00:36:15,914 --> 00:36:17,040
Go ahead.

611
00:36:17,686 --> 00:36:19,355
I'll eat it well.

612
00:36:28,248 --> 00:36:29,583
Yes?

613
00:36:32,126 --> 00:36:34,229
Yes, this is Park Kae In.

614
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:37,105
You must be surprised for notifying you so suddenly.

615
00:36:37,674 --> 00:36:39,177
Yes, a little.

616
00:36:39,177 --> 00:36:41,183
Last time, at the furniture exhibition,

617
00:36:41,183 --> 00:36:43,522
I saw the furniture you designed.

618
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,502
After debating about it for a long time, we finally decided to contact you.

619
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:55,321
At our company this year, we were thinking of 
releasing a single brand furniture.

620
00:36:55,523 --> 00:36:59,099
And so, the furniture you designed,

621
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:03,543
we feel that it fits our image the best.

622
00:37:07,055 --> 00:37:08,925
Re-Re-Really?

623
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,095
Yes.

624
00:37:17,095 --> 00:37:18,619
Jin Ho, where are you?

625
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:19,958
What do you mean where? I'm at the office.

626
00:37:19,958 --> 00:37:21,462
When you get off, come home.

627
00:37:21,462 --> 00:37:23,165
Because I have good news!

628
00:37:23,434 --> 00:37:24,936
Yes.

629
00:37:31,557 --> 00:37:35,232
Hey, we could have met at the house, but why in front of a bank?

630
00:37:35,232 --> 00:37:38,139
You said you got a job, right? 
Then you're going to get paid, right?

631
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:40,247
This is the time to do a little charity.

632
00:37:40,247 --> 00:37:44,090
You're going to get married to Jin Ho,

633
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,628
you should think about how to divide your assets!

634
00:37:45,628 --> 00:37:48,234
You should do this at least.

635
00:37:48,234 --> 00:37:51,343
Hey, I didn't even get paid yet, what's the rush?

636
00:37:51,343 --> 00:37:53,651
And what do you mean by marriage?

637
00:37:53,651 --> 00:37:55,454
Hey, hey.

638
00:37:55,454 --> 00:37:58,831
Your mother-in-law isn't liking you very much at this point.

639
00:37:58,831 --> 00:38:02,941
Our daughter-in-law is ready to be our daugher-in-law. 
Don't you have to show that kind of image at least?

640
00:38:02,941 --> 00:38:04,949
Ah, it's so bothersome.

641
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,085
Shut up.

642
00:38:07,155 --> 00:38:09,660
Have you done any asset management?

643
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,699
No.

644
00:38:10,699 --> 00:38:14,641
Miss, have you ever invested in Gold Bonds?

645
00:38:15,178 --> 00:38:21,526
I did before... But it wasn't me who actually invested in them.

646
00:38:21,526 --> 00:38:23,163
Me.

647
00:38:23,163 --> 00:38:25,637
Why isn't Sang Jun here yet?

648
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,577
Sang Jun is coming too?

649
00:38:27,577 --> 00:38:29,684
If it's not me, then who else will take care of him?

650
00:38:29,684 --> 00:38:31,721
There's no one else to take care of him except me.

651
00:38:31,721 --> 00:38:33,726
Why aren't you coming?

652
00:38:34,464 --> 00:38:35,331
What?

653
00:38:35,331 --> 00:38:36,969
It looks like you're going to get kicked out?!

654
00:38:39,311 --> 00:38:40,712
Unni!

655
00:38:40,716 --> 00:38:42,284
Ah, I am sorry...

656
00:38:42,284 --> 00:38:45,092
It's so crazy trying to look for a new office.

657
00:38:45,092 --> 00:38:47,700
Really? Have you found a place yet?

658
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,404
Well, it's hard.

659
00:38:49,404 --> 00:38:54,418
I would use my money, but with the amount I have, there isn't any place that is suitable.

660
00:38:54,418 --> 00:38:57,525
If I knew this would happen, I would have earned more money...

661
00:38:58,196 --> 00:39:02,105
If something happens to me, I always tell him first...

662
00:39:02,105 --> 00:39:04,679
No no no, it just happened out of nowhere.

663
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:06,684
And you know how Jin Ho is about his pride.

664
00:39:07,556 --> 00:39:10,830
Well, Sang Jun,

665
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:13,603
if it's really urgent and hard to get a space...

666
00:39:13,603 --> 00:39:16,846
Wait, Sang Jun, I have something to tell Kae In.

667
00:39:16,846 --> 00:39:17,516
Just a second.

668
00:39:17,516 --> 00:39:18,684
What?

669
00:39:18,684 --> 00:39:20,489
Why?

670
00:39:21,628 --> 00:39:23,899
Why are you doing this before your wedding?

671
00:39:24,837 --> 00:39:27,442
It's Jin Ho, how can I pretend not to notice?

672
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,083
That's your problem!

673
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:32,523
Always so self-sacrificial.

674
00:39:34,062 --> 00:39:35,666
You can never do that...

675
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:39,143
You don't even know how you and Jin Ho are gonna end up. You cannot spend your money away like that.

676
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:40,846
You're really weird!

677
00:39:40,846 --> 00:39:44,689
When was it that you said 
I have to get ready to marry Jin Ho?

678
00:39:44,926 --> 00:39:47,498
That was that, and this is this.

679
00:39:47,498 --> 00:39:48,634
Ah, I don't know.

680
00:39:48,634 --> 00:39:50,941
Because I'm stupid, I can't live with calculating all that.

681
00:39:50,941 --> 00:39:51,841
Don't get involved.

682
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,516
I am thinking for you.

683
00:39:55,556 --> 00:39:57,561
 ­ 

684
00:40:05,182 --> 00:40:07,286
What's the good news?

685
00:40:08,457 --> 00:40:12,533
All that time, you made fun of me 
for making furniture that doesn't sell.

686
00:40:14,408 --> 00:40:15,943
Tada!

687
00:40:15,943 --> 00:40:19,052
New star of the Furniture Design World, Park Kae In!

688
00:40:19,052 --> 00:40:20,456
You heard of the Do-Il Furniture Company?

689
00:40:20,456 --> 00:40:21,694
Yes, I've heard the name before.

690
00:40:21,694 --> 00:40:25,403
They said that this year, they're releasing a new brand.

691
00:40:25,403 --> 00:40:28,711
They decided to choose my design!

692
00:40:28,711 --> 00:40:30,082
Are you serious?

693
00:40:30,082 --> 00:40:32,256
You don't have any trust in me...

694
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:37,803
How could such a big company 
choose a nameless person like you?

695
00:40:37,803 --> 00:40:39,109
I have a name, you know...

696
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:42,583
I'm just saying, it's so sudden.

697
00:40:43,053 --> 00:40:46,227
They said that their company debated about it a lot.

698
00:40:46,227 --> 00:40:48,467
So today, the final decision came out.

699
00:40:48,467 --> 00:40:51,307
So, only writing the contract is left.

700
00:40:51,307 --> 00:40:53,146
Anyways, that's good.

701
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:58,696
If I sign the contract, money will be given automatically.

702
00:40:58,696 --> 00:41:00,466
Should I lend you some?

703
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:01,670
What?

704
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:05,079
I can lend you some with low interest.

705
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:07,519
Are you saying you're charging interest to your boyfriend?

706
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:09,225
Business is business!

707
00:41:09,225 --> 00:41:10,462
You like that kind of stuff.

708
00:41:10,462 --> 00:41:12,401
Being a loan shark is being business-like?

709
00:41:12,401 --> 00:41:15,475
I'll give you lower interest than banks.

710
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:19,386
For now, just borrow and use it.

711
00:41:19,788 --> 00:41:21,725
There's no need to borrow money.

712
00:41:24,402 --> 00:41:29,280
Just borrow it and use it. 
I don't have anywhere to use it anyways.

713
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,690
After getting the sum of money, just pay off the mortgage of this house.

714
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,496
After I do that, I'll still have some left over.

715
00:41:35,496 --> 00:41:38,171
So just borrow some...

716
00:41:38,171 --> 00:41:40,277
and put it in your bank!

717
00:41:40,277 --> 00:41:43,218
If you put it in the bank, it'll grow right?

718
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,331
Why are you insisting on me borrowing your money?

719
00:41:49,736 --> 00:41:51,174
I'm making an investment!

720
00:41:51,174 --> 00:41:53,882
If you get the Dam Arts Center Project,

721
00:41:53,882 --> 00:41:56,421
then you're going to get a lot of money!

722
00:41:56,891 --> 00:41:58,121
There's a chance I won't make it.

723
00:41:58,121 --> 00:41:59,949
Just trust me when I say you will.

724
00:41:59,949 --> 00:42:02,818
I have faith investing in you!

725
00:42:02,818 --> 00:42:05,665
I'm awesome, right?

726
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:09,975
That's okay. Just drink in congratulations.

727
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:26,641
Congratulations.

728
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:30,324
You're not coming?

729
00:42:30,804 --> 00:42:32,864
You've settled it down with your husband?

730
00:42:32,864 --> 00:42:35,868
Right, right. That's great. You did well.

731
00:42:35,868 --> 00:42:39,311
If a married couple fights, it'll only end up in exhaustion.

732
00:42:40,648 --> 00:42:45,429
What are you saying?

733
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:46,734
Jin Ho?

734
00:42:47,153 --> 00:42:50,308
Why would Jin Ho be here?

735
00:42:50,575 --> 00:42:52,398
Aigoo, really...

736
00:42:53,944 --> 00:42:57,126
That lady is really planning to go home today.

737
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:00,709
Jin Ho...

738
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:06,164
It's getting late. Shouldn't you be going home?

739
00:43:12,809 --> 00:43:14,685
Jin Ho...

740
00:43:19,022 --> 00:43:21,786
Has he already fallen asleep?

741
00:43:32,836 --> 00:43:34,869
Jeon Jin Ho,

742
00:43:35,997 --> 00:43:38,609
you're really overdoing it...

743
00:43:45,745 --> 00:43:49,951
How much did he drink to pass out like that?

744
00:43:49,951 --> 00:43:51,832
He said he was going to go home...

745
00:43:51,832 --> 00:43:54,913
He should've at least spent some 
time with me before leaving...

746
00:44:41,773 --> 00:44:43,653
You woke up?

747
00:44:44,495 --> 00:44:49,239
For a person with high tolerance, 
how could you get drunk that easily?

748
00:44:50,738 --> 00:44:53,873
If you're sober now, you should get going back home.

749
00:44:53,873 --> 00:44:58,800
If you don't go home, your mother will know you're here.

750
00:45:00,312 --> 00:45:03,324
It's strange how I can't sober up tonight.

751
00:45:05,393 --> 00:45:07,639
It seems...

752
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:09,802
It seems like I'll have to stay here for the night.

753
00:45:12,341 --> 00:45:16,364
That wine must've been very strong... very strong...

754
00:45:16,364 --> 00:45:17,800
Yes.

755
00:45:18,454 --> 00:45:24,008
I guess I can't make a drunk person go...

756
00:45:25,742 --> 00:45:27,200
Eh...

757
00:45:31,927 --> 00:45:35,794
In 2000,

758
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,493
you look a lot better there.

759
00:45:38,493 --> 00:45:40,945
Ah! Don't look at this one!

760
00:45:40,945 --> 00:45:42,396
Why not?

761
00:45:42,396 --> 00:45:44,263
You can't look at this one... Ahhh!

762
00:45:44,263 --> 00:45:46,118
It's fine.

763
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,755
Everyone says that I must've gotten 
surgery after seeing that picture.

764
00:45:49,587 --> 00:45:51,227
Well, you did change a little.

765
00:45:51,227 --> 00:45:54,093
No! I just got prettier as I grew

766
00:45:54,093 --> 00:45:56,093
But, this looks better.

767
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:05,082
You don't have any pictures of your mother?

768
00:46:07,916 --> 00:46:11,404
When I was young, my house must've caught on fire.

769
00:46:11,404 --> 00:46:14,293
All of them must have burnt up.

770
00:46:16,393 --> 00:46:19,693
And the remaining ones after that...

771
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,225
Dad got rid of them all.

772
00:46:32,276 --> 00:46:34,078
Jin Ho,

773
00:46:35,306 --> 00:46:39,637
don't be annoying to your mother.

774
00:46:40,557 --> 00:46:43,593
I don't mind waiting a long time.

775
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:45,833
So don't rush things.

776
00:46:46,539 --> 00:46:51,706
Until your mother opens her heart slowly, 
just be patient and wait.

777
00:46:52,827 --> 00:46:54,727
Alright?

778
00:46:59,427 --> 00:47:04,036
You should get going home now. 
Your mother must be waiting for you.

779
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,540
I-I can't right now.

780
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:09,160
Why not?

781
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,160
Drunk-driving is being strictly checked now.

782
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,893
If I'm caught, I'll be arrested.

783
00:47:18,227 --> 00:47:21,827
Yes... Don't drive then.... Can't do that..

784
00:47:21,827 --> 00:47:23,193
Yes.

785
00:47:24,827 --> 00:47:26,428
Then,

786
00:47:26,428 --> 00:47:28,293
what shall we do?

787
00:47:29,227 --> 00:47:31,760
Umm... I'm not sure.

788
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,637
Well...

789
00:47:34,827 --> 00:47:37,295
 Random News 

790
00:47:37,295 --> 00:47:41,360
 Random News 

791
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:46,227
If I knew this was going to happen, 
I would've rented a DVD or something.

792
00:47:46,227 --> 00:47:50,493
If you haven't sobered up yet, 
you should go to your room and rest.

793
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:53,327
I can't sleep because of a headache.

794
00:47:55,393 --> 00:47:57,660
Shall we watch something else?

795
00:48:00,093 --> 00:48:03,860
 Chimps mating time is very short. 

796
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:05,480
 It's around six seconds. 

797
00:48:06,293 --> 00:48:09,360
 However, when they are in heat, they often... 

798
00:48:21,293 --> 00:48:23,060
Ah! I think I'll have to go to bed.

799
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,993
I'm suddenly getting really tired.

800
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:36,360
  I put them somewhere around here before. 

801
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,027
  Where did they go? 

802
00:48:38,027 --> 00:48:40,260
  Is it here? 

803
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,727
  Ah! Just stand over there. 

804
00:48:49,027 --> 00:48:50,427
Oh... No way!

805
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:53,927
Jeon Jin Ho... Get a hold of yourself.

806
00:49:34,827 --> 00:49:36,793
Why is it so hot in here?

807
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,360
Am I getting a fever?

808
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,027
Oh my...

809
00:49:41,027 --> 00:49:43,460
Why is my skin so hot?

810
00:50:02,627 --> 00:50:04,160
I'm so thirsty.

811
00:50:05,027 --> 00:50:08,427
I think I'm getting sober now. I'm sober.

812
00:50:08,427 --> 00:50:09,893
I think I'll get going.

813
00:50:10,893 --> 00:50:12,427
That's right.

814
00:50:12,427 --> 00:50:14,293
I'm going to go work in the office.

815
00:50:14,293 --> 00:50:16,927
I should probably finish constructing.

816
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:32,359
I've already seen everything there is to see.

817
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,593
But why am I so nervous?

818
00:51:14,027 --> 00:51:19,127
Learning that she's Professor Park's daughter is amazing...

819
00:51:19,127 --> 00:51:22,993
And you're marrying her. You are amazing.

820
00:51:22,993 --> 00:51:27,293
Your future is paved with gold!

821
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,193
What's with the talk suddenly?

822
00:51:29,193 --> 00:51:32,993
Well yesterday, I met up with Kae In.

823
00:51:32,993 --> 00:51:35,260
You said that you would go for lunch together.

824
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:41,727
She was talking about giving money 
to borrow or something like that.

825
00:51:41,727 --> 00:51:42,727
Mind your own business.

826
00:51:42,727 --> 00:51:45,260
Let's hire more architects.

827
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,327
And pick out 2 cute lady assistants!

828
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:50,727
Since something like that won't ever happen, 
go back out and do your work.

829
00:51:50,727 --> 00:51:52,127
Oh, right!

830
00:51:52,127 --> 00:51:54,193
I know someone who works at Do-Il Furniture.

831
00:51:54,193 --> 00:51:57,860
Right, I could call that person and ask about Kae In.

832
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:00,693
Don't do it, hyung. Hyung!

833
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,993
I don't know how to tell you...

834
00:52:20,993 --> 00:52:22,560
What?

835
00:52:24,393 --> 00:52:27,260
What I'm saying...

836
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,768
Stop stuttering and just spit it out.

837
00:52:32,463 --> 00:52:35,545
It seems the Hans are behind this.

838
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:38,732
All of a sudden, an investor came along and said...

839
00:52:38,732 --> 00:52:42,572
that the designer has to be Park Kae In.

840
00:52:42,572 --> 00:52:46,491
What on earth is Chang Ryul thinking 
to be doing something like this?

841
00:52:52,291 --> 00:52:54,110
What's with you?

842
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:56,574
Why did you want to see me first?

843
00:52:59,966 --> 00:53:03,653
Didn't you say that you were going to give up on Kae In?

844
00:53:05,578 --> 00:53:08,303
When you said it back at Jeju Island, 
what was it if you weren't telling the truth?

845
00:53:09,131 --> 00:53:10,614
Or...

846
00:53:10,614 --> 00:53:13,628
if you are feeling sorry and you want to be a benefactor?

847
00:53:13,628 --> 00:53:15,940
Stop beating around the bush

848
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:18,229
and get to the point.

849
00:53:19,876 --> 00:53:21,638
Do-Il Furniture.

850
00:53:21,638 --> 00:53:24,647
That's it... You truly are amazing, Jeon Jin Ho.

851
00:53:24,647 --> 00:53:27,790
Very impressive networking skills.

852
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:29,499
Based on your network,

853
00:53:29,499 --> 00:53:31,230
what have you found out now?

854
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:34,379
Why do you have to get involved in this like that?

855
00:53:34,379 --> 00:53:37,111
But, is that something for you to be worried about?

856
00:53:37,111 --> 00:53:39,528
You have to vacate the office right now,

857
00:53:39,528 --> 00:53:41,818
Do you have even have the time to worry about that?

858
00:53:44,206 --> 00:53:49,393
I guess you still don't know who took your office?

859
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:55,784
I thought you said to fight fairly.

860
00:53:55,784 --> 00:53:58,197
That's when I thought you were fighting fairly.

861
00:53:58,197 --> 00:54:00,522
What are you talking about?

862
00:54:00,522 --> 00:54:02,503
You should ask yourself that.

863
00:54:02,503 --> 00:54:05,130
It's useless asking me that.

864
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:07,719
Because you're doing this, 
do you think our relationship will be different?

865
00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:10,213
I guess we'll find out with time.

866
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:11,517
Why?

867
00:54:11,517 --> 00:54:15,620
Are you going to run to Kae In and 
say that this is all a plot by Chang Ryul?

868
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,371
So you want her to drop everything?

869
00:54:18,778 --> 00:54:23,382
This is Kae In's first real opportunity, 
and you're going to block that?

870
00:54:23,817 --> 00:54:26,624
All because of your petty pride?

871
00:54:28,507 --> 00:54:30,567
Jeon Jin Ho,

872
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:35,347
do you know why I'm chasing after Kae In again?

873
00:54:35,347 --> 00:54:39,191
Although you're a guy who can't do anything for Kae In,

874
00:54:39,191 --> 00:54:40,964
I can.

875
00:54:42,435 --> 00:54:43,739
Cowardly punk...

876
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:45,108
Coward?

877
00:54:47,995 --> 00:54:49,888
I think you might know better

878
00:54:49,888 --> 00:54:51,143
who the cowardly one is.

879
00:54:51,143 --> 00:54:52,797
What are you saying I did?

880
00:54:52,797 --> 00:54:55,505
That's why I'm telling you to ask yourself.

881
00:54:55,505 --> 00:54:57,710
Think really hard...

882
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:00,115
as to what kind of man you are.

883
00:55:03,694 --> 00:55:07,436
I won't let you use Kae In.

884
00:55:07,436 --> 00:55:09,694
No matter what it takes.

885
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,471
Really?

886
00:55:19,471 --> 00:55:21,308
Next week?

887
00:55:21,308 --> 00:55:23,214
That quickly?

888
00:55:24,886 --> 00:55:28,371
That's alright with me. 
Anytime is perfect for me.

889
00:55:29,566 --> 00:55:30,736
Oh, yes.

890
00:55:30,736 --> 00:55:33,141
Then, I'll see you then.

891
00:55:34,644 --> 00:55:36,404
Did you have lunch?

892
00:55:36,404 --> 00:55:38,524
I'll pay for today.

893
00:55:38,524 --> 00:55:41,164
Since I'm getting a lot of money, 
I might as well spend it.

894
00:55:41,164 --> 00:55:42,468
If must've been a very exciting phone call.

895
00:55:42,468 --> 00:55:43,571
Yes.

896
00:55:43,571 --> 00:55:45,873
They asked to sign the contract next week.

897
00:55:45,873 --> 00:55:49,187
I'm about to be really busy now.

898
00:55:49,187 --> 00:55:52,073
With this job, and as a designer too.

899
00:55:52,073 --> 00:55:53,900
That...

900
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,205
new job you're talking about...

901
00:55:56,205 --> 00:55:57,375
Yes.

902
00:55:57,375 --> 00:55:59,448
Aren't you rushing things a bit?

903
00:55:59,448 --> 00:56:03,626
It's all up to them anyways.

904
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:05,164
But, still...

905
00:56:05,164 --> 00:56:07,437
Shouldn't you slow down and think about it a bit?

906
00:56:07,437 --> 00:56:09,308
What's there to know?

907
00:56:09,308 --> 00:56:12,751
They chose me because my design was good.

908
00:56:15,389 --> 00:56:17,999
Until now...

909
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:22,645
I've never had something great to 
show to my dad, that I've done...

910
00:56:23,325 --> 00:56:26,055
But this time, to do this before my dad 
is scheduled to come back,

911
00:56:26,055 --> 00:56:27,660
for something like this to happen...

912
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:30,266
You have no idea how happy I am.

913
00:56:31,871 --> 00:56:33,542
As a designer,

914
00:56:33,542 --> 00:56:36,150
you should know what it means.

915
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:39,057
To have your own brand name.

916
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:44,231
That's what I've just done.

917
00:56:45,309 --> 00:56:47,480
I now...

918
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,553
for the very first time...

919
00:56:49,553 --> 00:56:52,494
can gain recognition for something I've done from my father.

920
00:56:55,301 --> 00:56:57,541
Do your work.

921
00:56:58,244 --> 00:56:59,580
What?

922
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:02,988
You're going to go? 
We're not going to have lunch together?

923
00:57:04,161 --> 00:57:06,533
It might be hard because of how busy you are.

924
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:20,905
Director Jeon...

925
00:57:20,905 --> 00:57:22,178
Have you been well?

926
00:57:22,178 --> 00:57:24,317
What are you doing here?

927
00:57:24,317 --> 00:57:25,586
Please, sit.

928
00:57:25,586 --> 00:57:29,128
He came with honey!

929
00:57:30,868 --> 00:57:33,608
Thanks for cleaning up the mess the other time.

930
00:57:33,608 --> 00:57:37,786
I know now that the money used to pay off the workers was all from you.

931
00:57:37,786 --> 00:57:39,624
I'm very thankful.

932
00:57:39,624 --> 00:57:42,666
Our director Jeon can't express his feelings very well...

933
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:45,509
but he thinks of everybody very highly.

934
00:57:45,509 --> 00:57:49,553
Of course, I know that there's no one like him.

935
00:57:49,553 --> 00:57:52,059
It was something that had to be done.

936
00:57:52,059 --> 00:57:54,265
That's right... So, how's everything now?

937
00:57:54,265 --> 00:57:56,304
Business is hard right?

938
00:57:56,773 --> 00:57:58,010
Well...

939
00:57:58,010 --> 00:58:00,148
It's so-so, but bearable.

940
00:58:02,451 --> 00:58:05,295
Oh, isn't this sang Go Jae?

941
00:58:06,663 --> 00:58:08,604
Do you know Sang Go Jae?

942
00:58:08,604 --> 00:58:10,243
How come you know Sang Go Jae?

943
00:58:10,243 --> 00:58:12,048
If it's Sang Go Jae, then I know it well.

944
00:58:12,048 --> 00:58:16,426
I was one of the workers who helped 
build the place from start to finish.

945
00:58:16,896 --> 00:58:18,499
Is that so?

946
00:58:18,499 --> 00:58:21,540
As a beginner, even though I didn't play 
a huge part in the building process,

947
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:24,316
how could I forget building my first house?

948
00:58:24,316 --> 00:58:28,093
So you know Sang Go Jae pretty well?

949
00:58:28,093 --> 00:58:30,599
Well, you could say that.

950
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:33,639
Then while building it, were there any 
hard parts to construct?

951
00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:36,649
Do you remember anything special about the place?

952
00:58:42,266 --> 00:58:45,239
  Well... since it's been such a long time... 

953
00:58:46,277 --> 00:58:47,613
  Oh, that's right. 

954
00:58:47,613 --> 00:58:50,888
 There was a basement... 

955
00:58:50,888 --> 00:58:53,695
It was really hard making it.

956
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:56,537
A basement?

957
01:00:19,434 --> 01:00:21,507
Oh, Jin Ho.

958
01:00:21,507 --> 01:00:22,542
What is this?

959
01:00:22,542 --> 01:00:23,945
You're home?

960
01:00:23,945 --> 01:00:25,818
You said you'd be late...

961
01:00:25,818 --> 01:00:27,823
But, you're cleaning.

962
01:00:27,823 --> 01:00:30,563
Hey... such a kind man.

963
01:00:30,563 --> 01:00:31,399
Wah! Shall I give you a kiss?

964
01:00:31,399 --> 01:00:33,604
A little later.

965
01:00:33,604 --> 01:00:36,046
Do you know what I found?

966
01:00:37,182 --> 01:00:39,789
A picture of your mother.

967
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:43,533
My mother's picture?

968
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:52,959
This must've been the place 
where your mother used to work.

969
01:01:23,111 --> 01:01:25,382
Shall I show you something really cool?

970
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:28,458
One of the people who built Sang Go Jae

971
01:01:28,458 --> 01:01:31,165
is a person I know.

972
01:01:31,165 --> 01:01:36,212
That person told me that there used 
to be a glass floor right there.

973
01:01:36,212 --> 01:01:37,717
On nice days,

974
01:01:37,717 --> 01:01:41,126
it was for sunlight to go through.

975
01:01:42,396 --> 01:01:45,270
While your mother would work,

976
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:47,478
she would watch you play upstairs through the glass.

977
01:01:47,478 --> 01:01:49,216
 They live in one house. 

978
01:01:49,216 --> 01:01:51,555
 Daddy bear, Mommy bear... 

979
01:01:51,555 --> 01:01:53,995
 Baby bear. 

980
01:01:53,995 --> 01:01:58,907
 Daddy bear is very fat. 

981
01:01:58,907 --> 01:02:01,415
 Mom. 

982
01:02:01,415 --> 01:02:03,220
 Mom! 

983
01:02:06,096 --> 01:02:08,200
 Mom... 

984
01:02:12,948 --> 01:02:15,454
 - Mom.  
- But, why was this room covered up?

985
01:02:15,454 --> 01:02:18,261
 - Mom. Mom.  
- The structure of this room was ingenious and very clever.

986
01:02:22,775 --> 01:02:24,947
Kae In, what's wrong?

987
01:02:26,118 --> 01:02:27,788
Kae In!

988
01:02:28,391 --> 01:02:29,895
Hey, Park Kae In!
