1
00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:03,077
What's wrong with you?

2
00:00:03,077 --> 00:00:05,284
Are you trying to drink yourself to death?

3
00:00:11,485 --> 00:00:14,074
If you really feel like you've been treated so unfairly...

4
00:00:14,074 --> 00:00:17,299
then lure him back and hold on to him.

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,179
You've got to make him regret...

6
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:23,321
losing a woman like you.

7
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:29,304
Jin Ho...

8
00:00:29,889 --> 00:00:31,789
Can you...

9
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:35,589
make me into a woman?

10
00:00:48,676 --> 00:00:53,580
Episode 5 
   Project: Creating a woman 

11
00:01:12,647 --> 00:01:13,625
Oh!!

12
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,480
Jin Ho, what are you doing in my room?

13
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,627
This is my room.

14
00:01:17,627 --> 00:01:20,525
Why did you bring me into this room?

15
00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:22,846
You forced yourself into my room. You don't remember?

16
00:01:27,814 --> 00:01:31,893
 Can you... make me into a woman? 

17
00:01:34,822 --> 00:01:37,941
 Are you saying that knowing what it means? 

18
00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:39,634
 I too... 

19
00:01:40,387 --> 00:01:46,226
 I want to be a real woman, Jin Ho. 

20
00:01:46,226 --> 00:01:49,216
 A woman asking a man to make her into a woman... 

21
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:51,476
 Do you even know what that means? 

22
00:01:51,885 --> 00:01:54,374
 No matter how absent-minded you are, 

23
00:01:54,654 --> 00:01:56,631
 why are you so incorrigible? 

24
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,217
 It's senseless having a conversation with you. 

25
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:01,248
 Jin Ho... 

26
00:02:01,248 --> 00:02:02,983
 Jin Ho... 

27
00:02:02,983 --> 00:02:06,544
 I'm serious with my words, Jin Ho. 

28
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:11,008
 Someone saying I'm not really a woman... 

29
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:13,018
 I don't want to hear those words again. 

30
00:02:13,018 --> 00:02:16,495
 Do you think I will take this act of yours seriously? 

31
00:02:17,558 --> 00:02:20,267
 You were born as a man... 

32
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:25,038
 but you can't live as a man, Jin Ho. 
So of course you know what it feels like. 

33
00:02:25,038 --> 00:02:30,833
 Someone saying that I'm not a proper woman. 
Surely, you know what I feel right? 

34
00:02:31,311 --> 00:02:33,847
 So please... 

35
00:02:33,847 --> 00:02:35,982
 You have to sort out your own life. 

36
00:02:35,982 --> 00:02:38,609
 I've got better things to do, 
than to get involved in someone else's life. 

37
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,259
 Jin Ho! 

38
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:55,969
 This business... Do you really not know what it's all about? 

39
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:03,101
 That means "I dumped you because you didn't sleep with me." 

40
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,476
 Do you really not know it means that? 

41
00:03:07,476 --> 00:03:09,149
 I know... 

42
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:15,650
 Then you may know what you said "Make Park Kae In a woman" 

43
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,992
 is nonsense, right? 

44
00:03:17,992 --> 00:03:25,999
 But... a man and woman sleeping together, 
isn't it really what love is about? 

45
00:03:27,687 --> 00:03:31,272
 "I want to hold this woman in my arms" 

46
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:36,510
 you think a man without any passion 
would be capable of love? 

47
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:44,167
 Wanting to be touched and hold the woman he loves... 

48
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:47,154
 is a man's natural instincts. 

49
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:49,556
 A man's natural instincts? 

50
00:03:51,591 --> 00:03:54,294
 How come you know that? 

51
00:03:57,954 --> 00:04:01,146
 Just shut up and have another drink. 

52
00:04:06,106 --> 00:04:07,908
 But... 

53
00:04:07,908 --> 00:04:10,010
 even leaving that sort of thing out of it... 

54
00:04:10,711 --> 00:04:16,383
 there probably is some sort of woman that a man couldn't bear to lose... 

55
00:04:16,383 --> 00:04:19,463
 That's the kind of woman I want to become. 

56
00:04:20,421 --> 00:04:25,826
 If she's a woman who makes a man yearn for her, 

57
00:04:27,728 --> 00:04:32,001
 regardless of sleeping or something, 

58
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:35,936
 he won't dump her at least. 

59
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:56,289
How long are you going to stay on my bed?

60
00:04:58,292 --> 00:05:01,461
Thanks to you, I had a great sleep.

61
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:05,699
Jin Ho, thank you so much.

62
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:12,105
I feel like my mom sent you to be my friend.

63
00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:16,210
Go wash your face.

64
00:05:16,877 --> 00:05:19,513
You're rambling in front of a man 
with eye mucus on your face.

65
00:05:19,513 --> 00:05:21,481
That's why you got dumped.

66
00:05:24,216 --> 00:05:27,454
Did you still remember our agreement last night?

67
00:05:27,454 --> 00:05:29,757
I was drunk last night, so I don't remember anything at all.

68
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:32,693
In that case, you'll have forgotten something else too.

69
00:05:32,693 --> 00:05:35,148
What you said about not wanting 
your rental deposit back?

70
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:37,397
That you'd just move out without it?

71
00:05:37,397 --> 00:05:39,700
Hey, come on! I most certainly never...

72
00:05:43,003 --> 00:05:45,773
For the time you'll be living in this house, let's give it a try.

73
00:05:45,773 --> 00:05:48,208
The "Make Park Kae-In into a woman" project.

74
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:52,546
But you came and laid down on my bed 
crying like a baby, what else could I do...

75
00:05:52,546 --> 00:05:54,514
You're a weird guy.

76
00:05:54,514 --> 00:05:57,351
Who said that one thing he couldn't stand was lying?

77
00:05:58,485 --> 00:06:00,654
Alright, alright! 
Let's give it a try.

78
00:06:00,654 --> 00:06:04,558
There's not the faintest chance of it working, 
but let's try it all the same.

79
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:09,896
Jin Ho, I really feel that my mom 
sent you to me as her gift.

80
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:15,168
Stop talking and go wash your face!

81
00:06:17,338 --> 00:06:18,872
You've been sleeping out here?

82
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:27,881
When did you come in?

83
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:30,350
Didn't I tell you to get back here straight away?

84
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,485
Why don't you listen?

85
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:41,862
Did you hear what I said?

86
00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:44,564
I asked! Did you listen to me?

87
00:06:49,937 --> 00:06:51,038
Get out, please.

88
00:06:51,838 --> 00:06:52,673
Why should I get out?

89
00:06:52,673 --> 00:06:54,374
Are you going to keep on being selfish?

90
00:06:54,374 --> 00:06:56,577
I've only got 8,300 won left in my account.

91
00:06:56,577 --> 00:06:59,246
I spent lots of money preparing my wedding with you.

92
00:06:59,246 --> 00:07:02,082
You think I got all these household items as freebies?

93
00:07:02,082 --> 00:07:03,850
Now you're asking me why you have to go?

94
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,518
First of all...

95
00:07:05,552 --> 00:07:07,954
this isn't your house.

96
00:07:07,954 --> 00:07:09,356
Second...

97
00:07:09,356 --> 00:07:11,425
I'm not the one who decided to end it.

98
00:07:11,425 --> 00:07:13,960
But you were the one who made me 
want to end it, weren't you?

99
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,396
Maybe. But it was you  who made me 
want to end it with Kae In.

100
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:19,266
You're telling me now, "Because you were being a wench.  You should take the blame?"

101
00:07:23,203 --> 00:07:24,972
Why do you go away when we are speaking?

102
00:07:24,972 --> 00:07:32,279
In Hee, I have a nagging headache from last night.
If I just have a shower. Let's talk later.

103
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,481
Will you not let me finish what I have to say?

104
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:37,984
No I  won't, because I don't want to! 
I told you!

105
00:07:45,426 --> 00:07:48,327
Oh Mom, what's the problem, 
this time in the morning?

106
00:07:48,395 --> 00:07:49,197
Are you sick?

107
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,966
Mom, what do you mean? 
Why are you crying?

108
00:07:56,337 --> 00:07:58,105
I came to give you your morning coffee.

109
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,907
I don't drink instant coffee.

110
00:07:59,907 --> 00:08:02,543
Look, I'm trying to be nice to my instructor...

111
00:08:02,543 --> 00:08:04,612
so try to be nice and drink it.

112
00:08:04,612 --> 00:08:05,813
Are we in the army or something?

113
00:08:06,547 --> 00:08:08,081
Your instructor?

114
00:08:08,081 --> 00:08:10,150
Today we start it, right?

115
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,819
There's an idiom that goes, kill two birds with one stone.

116
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:14,321
How is that an idiom?

117
00:08:14,321 --> 00:08:15,656
It's a proverb.

118
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,360
Also... how long have you been wearing those track pants?

119
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,763
As far as I can remember, 
you wear them in bed and around the house,

120
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:25,832
and you even wear them when you go out.

121
00:08:25,832 --> 00:08:29,201
I remember hearing that you wore these pants and slippers on a date.

122
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:32,071
What man on earth would give 
a woman looking like that a second glance?

123
00:08:32,071 --> 00:08:35,174
Keep changing my clothes takes too much time.

124
00:08:35,174 --> 00:08:37,144
We've so little time together. 
That's why I wanted to make the most of it.

125
00:08:37,744 --> 00:08:39,579
Am I wrong?

126
00:08:39,579 --> 00:08:41,748
Is that sort of thing such a big deal?

127
00:08:43,117 --> 00:08:44,251
Yes, it is.

128
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,855
Men don't feel attracted to a woman 
who has bad appearance.

129
00:08:48,855 --> 00:08:53,327
The woman who coveted the man is the one 
who is able to charm them.

130
00:08:58,698 --> 00:09:01,168
Let's start now.

131
00:09:03,904 --> 00:09:04,839
Use this.

132
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:05,572
What?

133
00:09:05,572 --> 00:09:07,107
Put your head in it.

134
00:09:07,107 --> 00:09:07,875
Why?

135
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,743
Have you forgotten what your problem is?

136
00:09:10,744 --> 00:09:14,414
Park Kae In, didn't you say you wanted to 
be a woman that men took an interest in?

137
00:09:14,414 --> 00:09:17,384
So your problem is that first. 
You've got to take an interest in yourself.

138
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,492
Can you explain simply so I can understand it better?

139
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:21,593
Because he may wait or be anxious, 
you've rushed to go out

140
00:09:21,593 --> 00:09:24,329
either in your home clothes or your pajamas...

141
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:26,297
I've never gone out in my pajamas before.

142
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:28,966
Please continue.

143
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:35,540
Once you understand why women always show up 10 minutes late, you'll be on the road to being a real woman.

144
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,210
But, do I always have to be 10 minutes late?

145
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,711
Will you give me a chance to finish?

146
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:41,145
Ah, I apologize.

147
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:47,685
It is a tactic used to make a guy anxious, at the same time you are confident enough that he will wait for you.

148
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,788
Are you trying to act smart right now?

149
00:09:50,788 --> 00:09:52,156
What's with the 'ah?'

150
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:56,561
The most important thing for you right now 
is building up your patience.

151
00:09:56,561 --> 00:09:59,898
First, you have to fix your bad habit 
of going right away whenever a guy calls you.

152
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:00,832
Do you understand?

153
00:10:00,832 --> 00:10:02,300
That makes sense, instructor.

154
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,869
Of course it does. Here we go.

155
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:04,869
Yes.

156
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,375
Isn't it similar to water torture?

157
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:13,444
If you refuse to follow my instructions,

158
00:10:13,444 --> 00:10:14,646
I've no choice but to give up on you.

159
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:17,015
I will,

160
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:18,615
I will put my head in the water.

161
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:25,190
 Jin Ho's making a woman project: 
Patience, patience, and patience. 
Then you will get the guy. 

162
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,138
Park Kae In.

163
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:43,741
Park Kae In?

164
00:10:50,682 --> 00:10:52,350
You can only last 40 seconds?

165
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,585
I feel like dying!

166
00:10:53,585 --> 00:10:56,354
It's not like I'm a leader of a 
national independence movement.

167
00:10:56,354 --> 00:10:58,856
Why do I have to be tortured with water!

168
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,094
Oh my goodness! Oh, my! Oh, my!

169
00:11:03,762 --> 00:11:07,031
No matter what happens, you can't come out for an hour.

170
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:12,203
A man is waiting outside right now.

171
00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:15,907
But I will not go outside for an hour.

172
00:11:15,907 --> 00:11:17,541
Do you understand?

173
00:11:19,544 --> 00:11:21,179
Excuse me.

174
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:23,849
Can you... bring me 2 comic books?

175
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,549
Do you think you're in there to have fun?!

176
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:33,457
What am I supposed to do in here?

177
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:38,129
A package has arrived for you.

178
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:39,564
Where?

179
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,033
I told you not to come out.

180
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:46,571
How about we break for lunch?

181
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,840
Should we?

182
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,309
Fire! Ahhh!

183
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,445
Where?! Where?!

184
00:11:56,131 --> 00:12:11,496


185
00:12:11,496 --> 00:12:13,364
Time's up?

186
00:12:16,768 --> 00:12:18,637
 Jin Ho's making a woman project:
 Light of foot will make an elegant woman. 

187
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:22,506
There's something different about his back view, too.

188
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:29,880
Can't you walk more elegantly?

189
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,150
Make your legs straight.

190
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:35,085
Like this.

191
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:36,621
Let's try this.

192
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,957
Stretch your legs more.

193
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:44,262
Oh! I'm sorry!

194
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:47,398
That's why your hands are full of scars.

195
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,469
It's fine. Go get me some rubber gloves.

196
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:57,108
What are you doing?

197
00:12:57,742 --> 00:12:59,510
I told you to get me rubber gloves.

198
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,413
Jin Ho...

199
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:05,416
We'll be long time friends.

200
00:13:19,464 --> 00:13:23,335
 Jin Ho's making a woman project: 
A real charming woman can live 
by only eating dewdrops. 

201
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:23,902
Why not?

202
00:13:23,902 --> 00:13:28,039
Do you know why women out on a date 
only eat tiny amounts of food from the dish?

203
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,775
Is it because the fact they've gotten a date 
gives them sustaining energy?

204
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:33,043
You think women who wolf down their food are attractive?

205
00:13:33,043 --> 00:13:35,046
I do, actually.

206
00:13:35,046 --> 00:13:38,116
I'd say just picking at your food when 
you're with a guy you love is bad manners.

207
00:13:38,116 --> 00:13:40,152
It kind of suggests he's putting you off your food.

208
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,453
He could easily take it that way.

209
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:45,456
That's a new idea, I have to admit.

210
00:13:45,456 --> 00:13:47,726
Then, I can eat right?

211
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:52,230
So you think women with a meat craving 
are attractive to guys?

212
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,238
Ah, hello!

213
00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:01,740
Ah, yes! We've met before, right?

214
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,174
Yes.

215
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:07,212
It is a weekend, so I guess you've come to meet Jin Ho.

216
00:14:07,212 --> 00:14:10,648
You guys are working in the same office but if you don't see each other even for a day, you're becoming anxious to meet?

217
00:14:13,088 --> 00:14:13,785
Pardon?

218
00:14:15,954 --> 00:14:17,722
Kae In.

219
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:20,726
- Hello, Jin Ho. 
- Yes, yes.

220
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,327
How come you guys are both so late?

221
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:26,098
Me? I couldn't get away until my husband 
had taken our kid to the bathhouse.

222
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:31,269
And there's so many things to do for a project 
this size that I couldn't leave work before now.

223
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:33,038
Ew, hyung, I've already used that. I'll get you a clean set.

224
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:37,708
Oh, come on. Two people as close as you 
needn't bother about things like that?

225
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,178
We know that's not the only thing the pair of you share.

226
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:42,748
Pardon?

227
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,850
Forget chopsticks. You should make wraps 
and feed each other by hand.

228
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,419
I'm very broad-minded about things.

229
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,020
That's enough.

230
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,689
Jin Ho doesn't like that kind of stuff.

231
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:57,629
What do you mean? Lovers should be... Why would he hate that?

232
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:02,166
It's just the way it is, so what can you do?

233
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,002
Isn't that right?

234
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:06,471
Where I live, there are many gay people in the area.

235
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:08,173
So, I...

236
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:09,107
understand everything.

237
00:15:09,107 --> 00:15:10,742
Right, that's right. Gay.

238
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,079
Excuse me?!

239
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:17,249
Hey, Lee Young Sun! I told you not to say that out loud!

240
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,684
Jin Ho doesn't like hearing that he's gay!

241
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:32,330
So, those girls think that you're gay?

242
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,401
Not just me, you too.

243
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:45,443
I'm sorry, I had no other way.

244
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,113
Come to think of it...

245
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,550
If you don't want to be kicked out,

246
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,884
then I guess this idea's the only way forward.

247
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:00,559
Jin Ho.

248
00:16:01,526 --> 00:16:02,961
From now on,

249
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:05,731
for the good of the company, 
I'll do my best to play along.

250
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:08,600
Never mind. The best thing 
you can do is keep your mouth shut.

251
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,168
No, no.

252
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:11,736
This is the plan.

253
00:16:11,736 --> 00:16:14,506
Jin Ho, from now on, I'm not your colleague.

254
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:15,640
I'm your lover.

255
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,575
What are you saying?

256
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,877
I won't explain anything right now, 
but I'll tell you later-

257
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:19,511
Are you crazy?

258
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:20,778
Jin Ho.

259
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:21,146
Just go.

260
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:21,980
People will think-

261
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,148
Hurry up and go!

262
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,983
However, I love you!

263
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,387
Darling, let's talk a little bit more.

264
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,390
- No! 
- But, wait! Darling!

265
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,724
Darling! Darling!

266
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,894
My darling's a little too sensitive.

267
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,771
Wow, I think I'm really going to go crazy.

268
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,178
Sang Jun...

269
00:16:54,178 --> 00:16:55,847
You must be upset.

270
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,783
I am upset.

271
00:16:58,783 --> 00:17:04,722
Since he's a little embarrassed to show 
our relationship in front of others...

272
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,863
But what can we do? 
He doesn't want anybody to know.

273
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:13,931
I guess you'll just have to cope with it.

274
00:17:13,931 --> 00:17:15,533
I know.

275
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:18,536
I know, but sometimes it's too hard to take.

276
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,408
Sang Jun.

277
00:17:23,408 --> 00:17:27,645
I understand everything. So, just tell me everything.

278
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,552
Can I call you "unni" from now on?

279
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:52,804
Ah, aren't you Director Choi from the Dam Art Gallery?

280
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,513
Well, goodness me! If it isn't Director Choi 
from the Dam Art Gallery!

281
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:11,596
Well well!  Fancy meeting you again here, Director Choi!

282
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:30,709
Ah! Am I right in thinking that you're 
Director Choi from the Dam Art Gallery?

283
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:36,047
How do you do? My name is Han Chang Ryul from Mirae Construction.

284
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:37,482
Oh, I see.

285
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:42,982
Meeting unexpectedly in a place like this,

286
00:18:42,982 --> 00:18:44,442
it's truly an honor.

287
00:18:44,442 --> 00:18:46,445
Yes. Well, please get on with your exercise.

288
00:18:46,445 --> 00:18:48,047
Excuse me...

289
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:52,120
I heard a lot about you from In Hee.

290
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,648
That misunderstanding at the wedding, 
it was a little awkward,

291
00:18:56,648 --> 00:18:58,724
but at least it was resolved amicably.

292
00:18:58,724 --> 00:19:01,555
These are personal matters,

293
00:19:01,555 --> 00:19:02,795
so there's no need to tell me about them.

294
00:19:02,795 --> 00:19:06,048
But still. Even though I don't know 
what In Hee may have said-

295
00:19:06,048 --> 00:19:07,672
I haven't spoken about it to her at all.

296
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:12,543
But people's personal affairs are their own business.

297
00:19:12,543 --> 00:19:14,040
Gosh...

298
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,244
I knew your reputation, but I see it's true you draw a clear line between business and private matters.

299
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:19,847
You see, I was a bit worried

300
00:19:19,847 --> 00:19:22,648
you might have gained a bad impression of me 
over the wedding issue.

301
00:19:22,648 --> 00:19:24,283
You've put my mind at rest.

302
00:19:24,617 --> 00:19:25,685
Well,

303
00:19:25,685 --> 00:19:29,555
no matter what complications people have in their purely private lives, I don't concern myself with them.

304
00:19:30,756 --> 00:19:33,946
I hope that's true of you as well.

305
00:19:33,946 --> 00:19:35,327
Goodbye now.

306
00:19:44,637 --> 00:19:48,340
How many times have I told you not to say that I was gay?

307
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:54,195
I did wrong.

308
00:19:54,847 --> 00:19:56,482
Did you forget the contract already?

309
00:19:56,482 --> 00:19:58,851
If you ever say I'm gay ever again,

310
00:19:58,851 --> 00:20:00,753
what should I do?

311
00:20:00,753 --> 00:20:04,757
But it depends on the situation though...

312
00:20:04,757 --> 00:20:05,891
Also,

313
00:20:05,891 --> 00:20:08,427
it's not like it's something we don't know...

314
00:20:17,002 --> 00:20:20,273
C-Can... I put my hands down?

315
00:20:20,273 --> 00:20:22,041
Did I tell you to put them up?

316
00:20:23,142 --> 00:20:26,317
It's an important text message. Can I...

317
00:20:26,317 --> 00:20:27,513
Answer it.

318
00:20:27,913 --> 00:20:30,849
This is the last time I'm letting this slide.

319
00:20:37,256 --> 00:20:39,324
Yes!

320
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:41,761
I'm going for a job interview tomorrow.

321
00:20:41,761 --> 00:20:44,241
If you help me, I think I have a shot tomorrow.

322
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:45,398
You're going to help me, right?

323
00:20:45,398 --> 00:20:46,832
What should I wear tomorrow?

324
00:20:46,832 --> 00:20:49,134
So what have you done to deserve my help?

325
00:20:49,134 --> 00:20:53,105
I've shown remorse. Tearful remorse.

326
00:20:59,578 --> 00:21:02,648
My instructor has a seriously great complexion!

327
00:21:02,648 --> 00:21:04,016
Honey.

328
00:21:04,016 --> 00:21:05,874
Here it is.

329
00:21:06,285 --> 00:21:07,053
Milk.

330
00:21:07,053 --> 00:21:09,155
Yes, teacher.

331
00:21:09,155 --> 00:21:11,323
Egg yolk.

332
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:21,567
Wow! It's tasty!

333
00:21:22,501 --> 00:21:23,836
Stop!

334
00:21:23,836 --> 00:21:26,372
Stop eating and let's use some for your skin.

335
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:29,809
I didn't get to eat any meat at lunch today because of you.

336
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:31,743
So you just want to eat this up and forget about the rest?

337
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,015
Just add a little kelp extract now.

338
00:21:44,356 --> 00:21:48,026
I don't understand why I have to do this, too

339
00:21:48,794 --> 00:21:51,130
It would've been a waste to throw the rest out.

340
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,532
I couldn't eat...

341
00:21:53,532 --> 00:21:56,135
Hey, who was it that wanted to eat it all just now?

342
00:21:56,135 --> 00:21:57,169
Shh!

343
00:21:57,169 --> 00:22:00,039
If you talk with a facepack on, you get wrinkles.

344
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:03,809
Your boyfriend is sure to like you doing this.

345
00:22:12,084 --> 00:22:13,752
Hello?

346
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:16,289
Jang Mi?

347
00:22:17,923 --> 00:22:20,359
Is it a girl on the phone?

348
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:23,362
How could you do this to me?

349
00:22:23,362 --> 00:22:26,599
My son, you should be at home.

350
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,900
I'm sorry.

351
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,568
I've been very busy with work.

352
00:22:29,568 --> 00:22:32,104
Is it a girl? A girl?

353
00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:34,073
Aish...

354
00:22:34,073 --> 00:22:35,741
Have you got someone there with you?

355
00:22:35,741 --> 00:22:37,610
No, it must be the neighbor's dog.

356
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:38,644
Huh?

357
00:22:38,644 --> 00:22:41,447
How can a dog sound like a human?

358
00:22:41,447 --> 00:22:45,985
Apparently there are dogs nowadays that
 because they've only ever known human company,
 think they're humans too.

359
00:22:47,453 --> 00:22:49,888
Ha ha!  You don't say?!

360
00:22:49,888 --> 00:22:52,091
Son, shall we go on a date?

361
00:22:52,091 --> 00:22:53,392
I'm afraid that's a bit difficult.

362
00:22:53,392 --> 00:22:56,429
I have an important appointment, 
so I don't think I can go.

363
00:22:56,429 --> 00:22:58,731
You can't be that nice to a girl!

364
00:22:58,731 --> 00:23:01,166
That's very bad!

365
00:23:02,201 --> 00:23:04,770
I'm sorry. I'll call you back later.

366
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:07,039
I got it.

367
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,555
Although it can't be helped that you're busy,

368
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,977
I feel sad inside.

369
00:23:11,977 --> 00:23:14,814
I'm sorry for making you feel sad today, I'll make it up to you.

370
00:23:14,814 --> 00:23:16,148
I'll make you a promise.

371
00:23:16,148 --> 00:23:18,884
No! You can't make promises!

372
00:23:18,884 --> 00:23:22,054
Hey... why is that dog so loud?

373
00:23:22,054 --> 00:23:23,823
Don't you think you should move?

374
00:23:23,823 --> 00:23:27,059
No. For now, I'm hanging up and I'll call you back later.

375
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:27,993
Yes.

376
00:23:28,627 --> 00:23:31,930
You know, Jin Ho, you're a really awful guy.

377
00:23:37,436 --> 00:23:39,638
How could you go that far and do that to a woman?

378
00:23:39,638 --> 00:23:43,442
You have to be cold to women. You don't even love them.

379
00:23:43,442 --> 00:23:44,643
I love that one.

380
00:23:44,643 --> 00:23:46,311
Huh?

381
00:23:48,848 --> 00:23:49,882
Impossible...

382
00:23:49,882 --> 00:23:51,084
What's impossible?

383
00:23:52,185 --> 00:23:53,385
Is he bi?

384
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,756
That was my mother.

385
00:23:56,756 --> 00:24:00,493
You call your mother... Jang Mi?

386
00:24:00,493 --> 00:24:01,260
Yes.

387
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,795
That's what I do.

388
00:24:02,795 --> 00:24:05,330
My mother also likes it that way.

389
00:24:08,267 --> 00:24:10,069
You're very lucky.

390
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:14,573
You have a mother who calls you up.

391
00:24:14,573 --> 00:24:19,678
If my mom were still alive, 
I wonder if I could talk to her that way...

392
00:24:19,678 --> 00:24:22,414
..calling her Eun Young?

393
00:24:24,784 --> 00:24:27,386
Your mother...

394
00:24:27,386 --> 00:24:29,955
When did she pass away?

395
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:33,358
When I was five.

396
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,629
But, it's really strange.

397
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,098
What is?

398
00:24:39,098 --> 00:24:46,072
When you're five, you should remember things.
 But, I don't remember anything.

399
00:24:46,072 --> 00:24:50,642
I only know what her face looked like from photos.

400
00:24:51,377 --> 00:24:54,213
Your must have a poor head for such things.

401
00:24:54,213 --> 00:24:56,849
That must be it.

402
00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:59,418
I was just joking.

403
00:24:59,418 --> 00:25:03,122
No. You're right about me having a poor head.

404
00:25:03,122 --> 00:25:07,793
That's why I can't do anything right.

405
00:25:08,761 --> 00:25:15,968
To a 5 year old child, losing its mother 
is such a big event...

406
00:25:15,968 --> 00:25:19,972
that it seems best to forget about everything.

407
00:25:20,973 --> 00:25:22,475
That approach...

408
00:25:22,475 --> 00:25:25,844
...can be a form of self-defense.

409
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:30,649
Don't you think that's what happened in your case?

410
00:25:35,187 --> 00:25:37,790
Jin Ho...

411
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,625
I...

412
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:42,828
I've not said this so far, have I?

413
00:25:45,197 --> 00:25:48,066
You've come into our house...

414
00:25:48,734 --> 00:25:51,703
and you're welcome here.

415
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:09,189

416
00:26:23,489 --> 00:26:24,689
Did you sleep well?

417
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:30,589
Do you have a skin allergy?

418
00:26:32,689 --> 00:26:33,789
You too...

419
00:26:33,813 --> 00:26:35,181
M-Me too?

420
00:26:35,181 --> 00:26:36,815
Me too?

421
00:26:40,353 --> 00:26:42,655
You said it was good for my skin.

422
00:26:42,655 --> 00:26:44,557
Did you maybe use a rotten egg?

423
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:47,493
What should I do?

424
00:26:47,493 --> 00:26:49,795
I've got that interview...

425
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,298
You're here early, aren't you?

426
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:55,201
What's wrong with you today, hyung?

427
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:56,936
So why have you come in so early, too?

428
00:26:56,936 --> 00:27:01,373
I came early because I had to tell you something...

429
00:27:01,373 --> 00:27:02,575
But why are you like that?

430
00:27:02,575 --> 00:27:04,110
Hey!

431
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,412
Even you are at work early, Tae Hoon.

432
00:27:06,412 --> 00:27:10,950
That shows this Dam Arts Center project is 
really putting new life into our firm.

433
00:27:11,517 --> 00:27:13,152
But what's wrong with you?

434
00:27:13,152 --> 00:27:15,353
I've got a splitting headache and this is to cool me down.

435
00:27:15,353 --> 00:27:17,657
If you have a headache, 
then you should take a pain medication.

436
00:27:17,657 --> 00:27:18,824
You think you can cure it like that?

437
00:27:18,824 --> 00:27:19,792
By the way...

438
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:22,160
are you getting on well okay at Sang Go Jae?

439
00:27:24,297 --> 00:27:25,931
Tae Hoon, you...

440
00:27:25,931 --> 00:27:27,833
What are you talking about?

441
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:28,968
Hyung!

442
00:27:28,968 --> 00:27:31,303
How come you've caught chicken pox at your age?

443
00:27:31,303 --> 00:27:33,239
You better not scratch even if it's really itchy!

444
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:34,840
It's not the chicken pox.

445
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,975
What were you talking about?

446
00:27:35,975 --> 00:27:38,744
Hey, why pretend we don't all know the truth?

447
00:27:38,744 --> 00:27:41,047
Since you two were keeping me in the dark,

448
00:27:41,047 --> 00:27:42,782
I couldn't help telling Hye Mi all about it too.

449
00:27:42,782 --> 00:27:45,851
Kiddo, what's this nonsense you're 
coming out with so early in the morning?

450
00:27:45,851 --> 00:27:47,887
Come on, I know all about it.

451
00:27:47,887 --> 00:27:49,822
About Jin Ho living at Sang Go Jae.

452
00:27:49,822 --> 00:27:50,723
But hey...

453
00:27:50,723 --> 00:27:53,459
doesn't Professor Park's daughter 
live by herself in that house?

454
00:27:53,459 --> 00:27:56,028
How can you be living in the same house 
with a single woman?

455
00:27:56,028 --> 00:27:57,730
What's going to become of Hye Mi?

456
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,398
This is really bad of you.

457
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:01,833
Leaving Hye Mi like this.

458
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:02,724
It's not like that.

459
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:06,061
What do you mean it's not? 
I heard you moved into a girl's house.

460
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:08,096
You may like to be successful,

461
00:28:08,096 --> 00:28:11,699
but you are really low if you're thinking 
of using Professor Park's daughter.

462
00:28:11,699 --> 00:28:13,835
It is like you are saying you can do anything to be successful.

463
00:28:13,835 --> 00:28:15,837
You punk. Do you really not know Jin Ho?

464
00:28:15,837 --> 00:28:17,472
You think Jin Ho is that kind of a person?

465
00:28:17,472 --> 00:28:19,841
Even so, it's true that they're living together.

466
00:28:19,841 --> 00:28:21,576
Let's talk outside.

467
00:28:37,226 --> 00:28:42,563
  I feel like you're a gift my mom's sent to me. 

468
00:28:42,563 --> 00:28:45,433
  You've come into our house... 

469
00:28:46,168 --> 00:28:47,668
 ...and you're welcome here. 

470
00:28:47,668 --> 00:28:49,972
 Jin Ho, 

471
00:28:49,972 --> 00:28:52,306
 we'll be life-long friends. 

472
00:28:54,977 --> 00:28:59,814
But isn't Director Choi the one in charge 
of the Dam Arts Center project?

473
00:29:00,314 --> 00:29:04,619
I thought his father would be taking a backseat role.

474
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:08,757
The son was made front man to boost his prestige,

475
00:29:08,757 --> 00:29:13,495
but it's still his father, President Choi, 
who rules the roost in the MS Group.

476
00:29:13,495 --> 00:29:17,832
So, did he give you any indication he'll favor our side?

477
00:29:17,832 --> 00:29:21,903
Hey, do you think he is that easy?

478
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:24,372
Then... why did you...

479
00:29:24,773 --> 00:29:27,575
We need to get the rules of the contest changed.

480
00:29:28,744 --> 00:29:34,750
So that they don't give opponents 
we don't want to face a chance.

481
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,952
But... what do you mean by that?

482
00:29:38,921 --> 00:29:43,124
You will know everything soon enough.

483
00:29:44,927 --> 00:29:46,627
Yes, of course.

484
00:29:46,627 --> 00:29:48,229
Sir,

485
00:29:48,229 --> 00:29:52,000
I have Professor Park Chul Han on the line from  England.

486
00:29:56,071 --> 00:29:58,106
Hello.

487
00:29:58,106 --> 00:30:03,111
It's about the request I made to you last time. I said I'd contact you in England about the Dam Art Gallery selection process.

488
00:30:03,111 --> 00:30:06,815
Not at all. I'm not calling to make another attempt 
to get you to take on the project yourself

489
00:30:07,449 --> 00:30:09,050
Since you're adamant about that, I'm just calling...

490
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:12,654
...to ask again whether you'd consider 
helping us make the selection.

491
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:16,591
You wouldn't need to come back to Korea, 
we could send you all the information.

492
00:30:20,129 --> 00:30:22,399
I was just really hoping you'd be prepared to reconsider.

493
00:30:25,267 --> 00:30:28,269
Well, if you change your mind, 
you only have to contact me, any time.

494
00:30:28,269 --> 00:30:30,071
I hope you will.

495
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:31,272
Thank you.

496
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:35,911
So once again,

497
00:30:35,911 --> 00:30:37,745
he's turned you down, hasn't he?

498
00:30:39,648 --> 00:30:41,583
I'm going to try going to Sang Go Jae.

499
00:31:11,347 --> 00:31:14,350
The wood was so beautiful, I thought it would be a real waste just to throw it away.

500
00:31:16,785 --> 00:31:17,419
Wow...

501
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:20,188
Maybe you aren't a complete no-hoper after all.

502
00:31:20,889 --> 00:31:23,191
From the look of this, you really are a designer.

503
00:31:26,528 --> 00:31:28,963
But, what's that?

504
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:30,966
Oh, this... Well...

505
00:31:30,966 --> 00:31:34,102
This is a must-have item for friends 
who can't wash properly, like you.

506
00:31:34,889 --> 00:31:36,271
It's cleansing milk.

507
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:39,074
Starting today, please use this to clean your face properly.

508
00:31:39,074 --> 00:31:41,043
You ordered this today and it came today?

509
00:31:41,043 --> 00:31:43,177
Didn't I tell you I have a great website?

510
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:50,118
But how come you flunked your interview, 
yet you still feel like doing this sort of stuff?

511
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:54,389
So you want me to lie in bed and be a lazy butt then?

512
00:31:54,389 --> 00:31:58,393
How come your personality always 
sees a good side in things?

513
00:31:58,393 --> 00:32:02,096
One friend steals your boyfriend from you,

514
00:32:02,097 --> 00:32:06,501
another guy robs you of your house and goes into hiding,

515
00:32:06,501 --> 00:32:09,504
you make a hopeless mess of a job interview,

516
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:13,475
yet you don't feel bad, and you don't fly into a rage.

517
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:14,710
Hey.

518
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:19,715
The way they fuss over educational background, 
drop you because you're not good on paper.

519
00:32:19,715 --> 00:32:21,082
Casting someone aside like that,

520
00:32:21,082 --> 00:32:24,452
saying I took the wrong major and didn't study abroad.

521
00:32:24,452 --> 00:32:26,220
Why are they so picky?

522
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:30,158
I guess that earning my living in a 
big organization really isn't right for me.

523
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:31,927
I suspect it's more that you aren't right for them.

524
00:32:31,927 --> 00:32:33,828
I told you that already.

525
00:32:36,432 --> 00:32:39,367
But, why isn't Jin Ho here yet?

526
00:32:40,068 --> 00:32:42,236
I have to give him his present.

527
00:32:42,236 --> 00:32:44,739
To show him what I can do.

528
00:32:45,495 --> 00:32:46,274
Aigoo.

529
00:32:47,209 --> 00:32:49,212
But, you...

530
00:32:49,212 --> 00:32:51,880
you seem to have gotten a lot closer with Jin Ho.

531
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,516
I wish I could share a facepack with him too.

532
00:32:55,317 --> 00:32:57,352
But isn't he annoying lately?

533
00:32:57,352 --> 00:32:59,921
I mean, the way he talks is a little weird.

534
00:32:59,921 --> 00:33:01,789
That,

535
00:33:01,789 --> 00:33:04,025
I got used to that.

536
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:05,527
Even when he grunts,

537
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:07,895
I somehow find him cute.

538
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,698
Also...

539
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:11,132
What else?

540
00:33:11,132 --> 00:33:13,302
It's really rare,

541
00:33:13,302 --> 00:33:15,037
but at times,

542
00:33:15,037 --> 00:33:16,738
At times?

543
00:33:18,474 --> 00:33:19,774
At times what?

544
00:33:19,774 --> 00:33:23,978
He comes out with things that go straight to my heart.

545
00:33:23,978 --> 00:33:25,747
And that's why...

546
00:33:27,383 --> 00:33:29,417
yesterday,

547
00:33:29,417 --> 00:33:34,388
I said really cheesily that he was welcome here in our house.

548
00:33:37,793 --> 00:33:39,460
This won't do, Park Kae In!

549
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,562
What won't?

550
00:33:40,562 --> 00:33:43,165
No matter how naive and pure your heart is,

551
00:33:43,165 --> 00:33:44,966
you can't love a gay person!

552
00:33:44,966 --> 00:33:47,268
That means heading for a tragedy.

553
00:33:48,203 --> 00:33:49,371
Young Sun.

554
00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:52,708
The tragedy of being killed at the hands of your friend...

555
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:55,176
do you want to experience it?

556
00:33:55,878 --> 00:33:56,545
Huh?

557
00:34:12,695 --> 00:34:14,395
Who is it?

558
00:34:14,863 --> 00:34:17,131
I believe this is Professor Park Chul Han's house?

559
00:34:17,131 --> 00:34:18,867
Yes, but...

560
00:34:18,867 --> 00:34:20,502
my dad's not here at the moment.

561
00:34:20,502 --> 00:34:22,437
Yes, I understand that.

562
00:34:22,437 --> 00:34:24,739
I would like to talk to his daughter.

563
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:30,612
What do I do? What do I do? 
I think someone's looking for my dad!

564
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:33,448
Hey, calm down.

565
00:34:33,448 --> 00:34:35,917
How come everything strange always begins
 with the mention of your father's name?

566
00:34:35,917 --> 00:34:37,452
Hey, do you think I can calm down in a time like this?

567
00:34:37,452 --> 00:34:40,822
If he finds out I mortgaged this house to 
borrow money from a private lender, he'll kill me.

568
00:34:40,822 --> 00:34:42,792
He must be...

569
00:34:42,792 --> 00:34:44,592
Kae In...

570
00:34:44,592 --> 00:34:48,229
How can he know all that from England?

571
00:34:49,364 --> 00:34:50,698
You think?

572
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,745
Excuse me... W-What is it that brings you here?

573
00:35:10,853 --> 00:35:12,087
 Where did you- 

574
00:35:12,087 --> 00:35:17,725
 That's not it! This man's gay! 

575
00:35:20,229 --> 00:35:21,496
Oh, I'm...

576
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:22,564
Yes...

577
00:35:22,564 --> 00:35:25,333
I am Choi Do Bin from the Dam Art Gallery.

578
00:35:26,602 --> 00:35:28,236
You are Jeon Jin Ho's...

579
00:35:29,037 --> 00:35:30,572
friend, right?

580
00:35:31,105 --> 00:35:32,273
Excuse me?

581
00:35:36,011 --> 00:35:36,945
Here...

582
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:40,748
Yes. Thank you very much.

583
00:35:43,118 --> 00:35:44,652
That's really ingenious.

584
00:35:44,652 --> 00:35:47,689
She remodeled a broken chair she found.

585
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,592
She wants to give it to the spicy rice cake store she visits frequently.

586
00:35:50,592 --> 00:35:52,727
It will be useful to short kids.

587
00:35:52,727 --> 00:35:54,162
How did you know?

588
00:35:54,162 --> 00:35:55,830
That's exactly why I made it.

589
00:36:03,272 --> 00:36:05,507
I'm sorry I couldn't be much help.

590
00:36:05,507 --> 00:36:09,178
I'm afraid I'm not a daughter her father takes much notice of.

591
00:36:09,178 --> 00:36:13,481
I thought you were a very brave woman 
when I saw you the other day,

592
00:36:13,481 --> 00:36:16,284
and yet you seem to lack confidence 
where your father is concerned.

593
00:36:16,284 --> 00:36:18,786
You've... seen me before?

594
00:36:19,521 --> 00:36:22,891
Right! Earlier you mentioned that I was Jin Ho's friend.

595
00:36:23,647 --> 00:36:24,860
How did you know?

596
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:28,296
I feel like we'll be meeting again. 
So, we can talk at leisure another time.

597
00:36:28,296 --> 00:36:31,399
So... I think I'll be leaving now.

598
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:32,433
Yes.

599
00:36:32,433 --> 00:36:34,068
- Goodbye. 
- Goodbye.

600
00:36:38,774 --> 00:36:43,110
What a weird way of saying goodbye...

601
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,245
I'm not sure.

602
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:46,014
I've no idea what that was about.

603
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:58,626
Aren't you leaving?

604
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:07,502
What could it be?

605
00:37:09,471 --> 00:37:13,475
Why is MS Group using Sang Go Jae for its concept?

606
00:37:13,475 --> 00:37:15,743
You see? Even you don't know.

607
00:37:15,743 --> 00:37:18,212
So what chance has an ordinary guy like me of knowing?

608
00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:21,883
There's definitely something behind this.

609
00:37:22,684 --> 00:37:23,875
Maybe...

610
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:29,776
You know how the story goes, don't you?

611
00:37:29,776 --> 00:37:35,024
How the roof of the National Assembly building 
opens and robot Tae-Kwon V emerges?

612
00:37:35,024 --> 00:37:41,581
Maruchi and Arachi are living in Sang Go Jae, where Professor Park Chul Han presses a button and they emerge too.

613
00:37:41,581 --> 00:37:43,089
Are you having fun, hyung?

614
00:37:43,089 --> 00:37:47,694
No, I'm not having fun, but saying this helps the anxiety.

615
00:37:47,694 --> 00:37:49,574
What can it be?

616
00:37:56,902 --> 00:37:59,428
So, has your face gotten better?

617
00:37:59,428 --> 00:38:00,023
Yes.

618
00:38:00,023 --> 00:38:03,176
That's a relief. My face got better too 
after I ate something.

619
00:38:03,176 --> 00:38:08,179
According to Young Sun, 
it's because of the salt in the kelp.

620
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:09,582
How did your interview go?

621
00:38:09,582 --> 00:38:12,451
It didn't go well.

622
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:14,153
Is that something to be proud of?

623
00:38:14,153 --> 00:38:18,924
I'm sorry. You helped me a  lot.

624
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:20,827
It's fine. There's nothing to apologize to me about.

625
00:38:20,827 --> 00:38:22,862
Are you coming home early today?

626
00:38:23,996 --> 00:38:24,664
Why?

627
00:38:24,664 --> 00:38:28,201
Well, Young Sun brought some side dishes so 
I thought we could have dinner together.

628
00:38:28,201 --> 00:38:30,235
I'll think about it.

629
00:38:30,837 --> 00:38:33,806
Come home early so we can have dinner together.

630
00:38:34,892 --> 00:38:37,226
If someone heard this, 
they'd think you two were a newly-wed couple.

631
00:38:37,226 --> 00:38:39,578
Newly-wed couple my foot!

632
00:38:40,313 --> 00:38:42,415
Alright. You should get going.

633
00:38:42,415 --> 00:38:47,854
Go and eat dinner together... Take a bath together.

634
00:38:47,854 --> 00:38:49,521
Are you sure you haven't gone crazy?

635
00:39:02,568 --> 00:39:04,303
Yes, In Hee?

636
00:39:06,172 --> 00:39:08,107
Please sit.

637
00:39:13,846 --> 00:39:18,951
I was thinking what to do after work, 
and I remembered you said you'd buy me a meal.

638
00:39:18,951 --> 00:39:20,945
Have I hit on a busy time for you?

639
00:39:20,945 --> 00:39:22,199
Not at all.

640
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:26,225
  Young Sun brought some side dishes so 
I thought we could have dinner together. 

641
00:39:26,225 --> 00:39:32,063
I'm sorry, but let's just have some tea
 this evening and a meal another time.

642
00:39:32,063 --> 00:39:36,370
Will you attend the party for architects?

643
00:39:38,104 --> 00:39:40,981
I would like to give some information about that party.

644
00:39:40,981 --> 00:39:45,608
Do you really think one cup of tea 
would give us enough time for that?

645
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,174
My parents passed away in my senior year of high school.

646
00:40:11,174 --> 00:40:16,676
I didn't have any place to go and so 
Kae In took me in to her place.

647
00:40:16,676 --> 00:40:24,350
She would act like she was the only one who could protect me in this world.

648
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:28,454
In school and at home too, 
she was always following me around, asking...

649
00:40:28,454 --> 00:40:31,989
what can I do for you, what can I get for you?

650
00:40:31,989 --> 00:40:37,997
But I was so wretched and I couldn't stand 
her sympathy, it was making me feel worse.

651
00:40:37,997 --> 00:40:40,733
So I wanted to yell out saying

652
00:40:40,733 --> 00:40:43,569
'Stop pretending to be so kind'.

653
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:47,073
She wasn't pretending to be kind. She truly was kind.

654
00:40:47,073 --> 00:40:48,774
But you know what?

655
00:40:48,774 --> 00:40:51,677
When people give you things too easily,

656
00:40:51,677 --> 00:40:55,448
you get the urge to try to take things 
away from them altogether.

657
00:40:55,448 --> 00:41:03,422
I thought, "I'll take something we can't share 
away from her, and see if she's still so kind."

658
00:41:03,422 --> 00:41:05,725
I guess that sort of feeling lay behind what I did.

659
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:08,295
So you were a fool, weren't you?

660
00:41:09,862 --> 00:41:17,137
You should have seen it through, stuck with what you'd gained by stealing a lover from a friend like that, and ended up happy.

661
00:41:17,137 --> 00:41:20,843
Throwing away the gains from 
your misdeeds was a foolish waste, surely?

662
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:26,479
You're right.

663
00:41:26,479 --> 00:41:31,551
They really were misdeeds.

664
00:41:31,551 --> 00:41:37,056
But somehow... what you say consoles me.

665
00:41:37,056 --> 00:41:41,460
Since I wasn't so good at doing misdeeds, 
I can't be all that evil.

666
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:45,364
Something like that.

667
00:41:45,364 --> 00:41:50,837
Can we go for a drink somewhere?

668
00:41:50,837 --> 00:41:53,634
I feel like drinking tonight.

669
00:42:19,016 --> 00:42:20,830
Are you okay?

670
00:42:22,702 --> 00:42:25,404
What terrible driving!

671
00:42:25,404 --> 00:42:30,710
Can you really not love a woman?

672
00:42:36,215 --> 00:42:43,356
In that case, why am I getting these 
very manly vibes from you?

673
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:47,760
I think you've had too much to drink.

674
00:43:29,502 --> 00:43:31,170
Are you alright?

675
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,971
Thank you.

676
00:43:39,111 --> 00:43:42,948
How can you come home in 
the company of that Jin Ho guy?

677
00:43:44,884 --> 00:43:47,953
We had dinner together.

678
00:43:48,955 --> 00:43:50,957
What are you trying to imply?

679
00:43:50,957 --> 00:43:53,259
That it would be okay for me to run around with women?

680
00:43:53,259 --> 00:43:57,263
Is that why you keep hanging out with Jin Ho?

681
00:43:58,664 --> 00:44:01,067
I get it. I'm supposed to go half-crazy with rage.

682
00:44:01,067 --> 00:44:05,338
You think I'll say "I don't like women like you" and end it, don't you?

683
00:44:05,338 --> 00:44:06,339
Am I sleeping around?

684
00:44:06,339 --> 00:44:08,241
The things you're doing amount to the same!

685
00:44:08,241 --> 00:44:12,111
Right, I sleep around. Isn't that precisely 
what you like about me?

686
00:44:12,111 --> 00:44:17,584
You were sick and tired of Kae In because she's so uptight, 
so you came to me because I sleep around.

687
00:44:17,584 --> 00:44:18,985
I loved you.

688
00:44:18,985 --> 00:44:20,253
You loved me?

689
00:44:21,654 --> 00:44:22,889
That's in the past tense.

690
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:25,291
I feel the same way.

691
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:30,096
You belong in my category of past regrets.

692
00:44:30,096 --> 00:44:34,867
That's why I want to start all over again. 
______________________.

693
00:44:34,867 --> 00:44:36,536
So...

694
00:44:36,536 --> 00:44:38,838
So does that mean starting with that Jin Ho guy now?

695
00:44:38,838 --> 00:44:44,143
I don't know yet. But I am attracted to that man.

696
00:44:44,143 --> 00:44:46,012
You know why?

697
00:44:46,012 --> 00:44:51,216
Because he's so different from you. 
Just that one thing is good enough for me.

698
00:44:55,755 --> 00:45:01,160
I get the feeling that I can't break up with you now.

699
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,230
Why? Is that because your rival is Jeon Jin Ho?

700
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:11,722
That's why you can't be the one. You're a guy who'll  throw 
your life away out of jealousy.

701
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:19,846
I'll regard that as my alimony.

702
00:45:19,846 --> 00:45:23,883
To compensate for the hurt that I caused Park Kae In.

703
00:45:23,883 --> 00:45:25,584
Right?

704
00:46:05,491 --> 00:46:09,828
What's the betting that girl won't have 
eaten dinner yet because I'm not back?

705
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:33,352
What are you doing?

706
00:46:35,321 --> 00:46:38,291
You weren't waiting for me, were you?

707
00:46:38,291 --> 00:46:40,860
I know you must be busy, with your two lovers,

708
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:44,597
but if you're going to eat dinner, 
you could have told me so.

709
00:46:44,597 --> 00:46:46,065
The table was all set...

710
00:46:46,065 --> 00:46:47,959
I made rice and prepared bean paste stew.

711
00:46:47,959 --> 00:46:49,861
True, I didn't get to enjoy them,

712
00:46:49,861 --> 00:46:51,295
but I appreciate the thought.

713
00:46:51,295 --> 00:46:54,132
I made it really tasty this time...

714
00:46:54,132 --> 00:46:55,833
Like I said, I really appreciate your trouble.

715
00:46:56,401 --> 00:46:58,602
But I hope you didn't go without food yourself 
because you were waiting for me?

716
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:03,643
I ate up all the food intended for you, too.

717
00:47:07,746 --> 00:47:09,080
Patience.

718
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,214
Have you already forgotten?

719
00:47:10,816 --> 00:47:13,851
Forgotten how a true woman 
doesn't go crazy at the mere sight of food?

720
00:47:13,851 --> 00:47:16,654
And don't you know people who play games 
with food like that are as mean as you can get?

721
00:47:16,654 --> 00:47:17,645
Really?

722
00:47:20,659 --> 00:47:22,126
Are you making fun of me with your height?

723
00:47:22,126 --> 00:47:23,494
Do you like being short?

724
00:47:34,172 --> 00:47:35,873
It really looks delicious!

725
00:47:37,709 --> 00:47:38,910
We could have just...

726
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:41,312
eaten the bean paste stew at home.

727
00:47:42,347 --> 00:47:45,082
Should we just go home and eat bean paste stew then?

728
00:47:45,082 --> 00:47:48,185
It's just a waste of money if we leave all of this. 
What's up with you?

729
00:47:52,925 --> 00:47:54,559
Here! Eat.

730
00:47:56,427 --> 00:47:57,996
Did you wash your hands?

731
00:47:57,996 --> 00:47:59,897
I didn't wash them.

732
00:48:00,565 --> 00:48:02,634
Don't eat it then. I was just behaving naturally...

733
00:48:02,634 --> 00:48:03,901
Forget it.

734
00:48:03,901 --> 00:48:05,603
I can live with it this time. Just eat.

735
00:48:09,841 --> 00:48:11,209
But then...

736
00:48:11,209 --> 00:48:13,011
what have you been doing that it's gotten 
this late without you eating dinner?

737
00:48:14,446 --> 00:48:15,813
Ah, yes...

738
00:48:15,813 --> 00:48:17,282
I was busy with work.

739
00:48:17,282 --> 00:48:19,517
I was busy working too, that's why I didn't get to eat.

740
00:48:19,517 --> 00:48:21,319
It wasn't because I was waiting for you.

741
00:48:21,886 --> 00:48:22,954
From now on,

742
00:48:22,954 --> 00:48:26,190
I'm never going to miss out on eating 
through waiting for someone.

743
00:48:34,899 --> 00:48:39,370
So you used to wait for Chang Ryul without eating as well?

744
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:44,442
That... Well, my stomach made noises...

745
00:48:44,442 --> 00:48:51,015
So you were dying to eat, yet you waited 
for a guy like that... That's why you got dumped.

746
00:48:51,015 --> 00:48:54,919
That's why I'm working hard, so you can be proud of me.

747
00:48:55,587 --> 00:48:58,823
No need to be on your best behavior now. Just eat.

748
00:49:10,168 --> 00:49:12,469
Jin Ho, that was a really great meal!

749
00:49:12,469 --> 00:49:14,472
I feel like a pig right now.

750
00:49:15,974 --> 00:49:18,609
You shouldn't say things like that in front of a man.

751
00:49:19,144 --> 00:49:20,812
Always lecturing me.

752
00:49:25,517 --> 00:49:26,818
Jin Ho.

753
00:49:28,086 --> 00:49:31,356
If the "creating a woman" project is a success,

754
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:34,192
I...

755
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,227
Could I...

756
00:49:36,227 --> 00:49:38,663
be able to fall in love again?

757
00:50:05,657 --> 00:50:06,357
 Kae In, 

758
00:50:06,357 --> 00:50:08,460
 this is the best stress reliever! 

759
00:50:09,327 --> 00:50:11,262
 You should give it a try. 

760
00:50:11,262 --> 00:50:13,564
 Oh my. I'm scary. I'm gonna hit with all my might. 

761
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:16,067
 Let's go. Hit! 

762
00:50:17,335 --> 00:50:18,469
 That's right. 

763
00:50:18,469 --> 00:50:20,805
 Can't you hit harder? 

764
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:29,881
Jin Ho, give me 500 won.

765
00:50:30,749 --> 00:50:31,616
Give me 500 won.

766
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:34,552
This is the best stress reliever.

767
00:50:34,552 --> 00:50:37,088
I bought you dinner and now 
you expect me to pay for this, too?

768
00:50:37,088 --> 00:50:39,690
It's not like I'm asking for 500 won? 
Just this once, please?

769
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,035
 I... 

770
00:50:51,035 --> 00:50:53,338
 was never in love with you. 

771
00:50:59,311 --> 00:51:01,112
 To me you're... 

772
00:51:02,313 --> 00:51:06,617
 a wet and miserable dog... 

773
00:51:06,617 --> 00:51:14,392
 wandering around the neighborhood 
on a rainy day... kind of like a puppy. 

774
00:51:18,597 --> 00:51:19,997
That's enough now.

775
00:51:20,465 --> 00:51:21,800
Just a few more tries.

776
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,836
A few more tries, I know I can do it.

777
00:51:24,836 --> 00:51:27,471
You won't feel better by whacking this thing.

778
00:51:27,471 --> 00:51:30,141
Hitting his face would be better.

779
00:51:31,242 --> 00:51:33,277
That's really what you want to do...

780
00:51:33,277 --> 00:51:35,179
Isn't it so?

781
00:51:37,015 --> 00:51:40,516
Giving him a slap across the cheeks... 
what difference would that make?

782
00:51:44,322 --> 00:51:46,257
I would still be...

783
00:51:46,257 --> 00:51:50,695
as pitiful as I am now.

784
00:51:52,597 --> 00:51:55,566
The typical act of a pitiful person...

785
00:51:55,566 --> 00:51:58,903
...to take my anger out on him.

786
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:02,707
Then what is it that you really want to do?

787
00:52:03,908 --> 00:52:06,611
What will it take to get closure on all this?

788
00:52:10,448 --> 00:52:12,350
I don't know.

789
00:52:15,053 --> 00:52:18,690
How I can break free of it, put an end to it...

790
00:52:21,326 --> 00:52:24,362
How I can end things...

791
00:52:25,296 --> 00:52:26,864
I have no idea.

792
00:52:37,943 --> 00:52:40,211
Do you have time this Saturday?

793
00:52:41,346 --> 00:52:42,213
Please spare some time.

794
00:52:42,213 --> 00:52:43,915
You have to go somewhere with me.

795
00:52:45,784 --> 00:52:46,617
Where?

796
00:52:46,617 --> 00:52:48,086
We're going to a party.

797
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,089
Chang Ryul will be there too.

798
00:52:52,323 --> 00:52:53,791
On that occasion...

799
00:52:53,791 --> 00:52:56,394
"I'm getting on just fine without you",

800
00:52:57,162 --> 00:53:00,298
"Look what a great woman this 
Park Kae In whom you despised truly is",

801
00:53:00,398 --> 00:53:04,467
let's show him that.

802
00:53:17,916 --> 00:53:19,550
It looks strange, doesn't it?

803
00:53:26,791 --> 00:53:28,626
You look like you're dressed to meet a prospective husband.

804
00:53:31,663 --> 00:53:32,309
How about this?

805
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:35,333
So are you going there just to flirt with men?

806
00:53:36,901 --> 00:53:38,636
It's not like you're a bodyguard...

807
00:53:44,843 --> 00:53:45,948
Thank you.

808
00:53:50,615 --> 00:53:51,749
I'm sorry.

809
00:53:51,749 --> 00:53:53,785
I always owe you.

810
00:53:55,186 --> 00:53:56,487
As long as you know that.

811
00:53:56,487 --> 00:53:58,723
Let's walk you through the party.

812
00:53:59,257 --> 00:54:04,429
I've actually been wanting to go to such a party like in the movies, with the wine and everything.

813
00:54:04,429 --> 00:54:06,631
I'm really looking forward to it!

814
00:54:06,631 --> 00:54:08,032
Don't be too ecstatic.

815
00:54:11,536 --> 00:54:14,038
How can you run a salon this way?

816
00:54:14,038 --> 00:54:16,541
I should've fired you guys a long time ago!

817
00:54:16,608 --> 00:54:18,076
Do you not have eyes? Eyes?!

818
00:54:20,011 --> 00:54:20,679
Mr. Lee?

819
00:54:20,679 --> 00:54:22,613
What? What?! What?!

820
00:54:24,082 --> 00:54:25,250
Jin Ho.

821
00:54:26,051 --> 00:54:29,253
Long time no see. It's been a long time 
since we've seen each other like this.

822
00:54:29,253 --> 00:54:31,056
You remodeled this place, right?

823
00:54:31,056 --> 00:54:32,106
You're right.

824
00:54:34,525 --> 00:54:36,094
You're too much, my dear.

825
00:54:36,094 --> 00:54:38,196
You didn't even visit me once.

826
00:54:38,196 --> 00:54:40,531
How can you be like this?

827
00:54:40,531 --> 00:54:41,432
Sorry.

828
00:54:41,432 --> 00:54:42,900
I've been very busy lately.

829
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,535
I'll let you off just this once.

830
00:54:49,641 --> 00:54:50,375
Who's this?

831
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:53,611
Ah, this is my friend.

832
00:54:53,611 --> 00:54:54,979
The favor I asked you about.

833
00:54:55,914 --> 00:54:57,248
She's really your friend?

834
00:54:58,116 --> 00:54:58,950
It's true.

835
00:54:59,684 --> 00:55:02,420
"Friend." "Friend..."

836
00:55:03,021 --> 00:55:04,622
Bring me water!

837
00:55:04,622 --> 00:55:05,890
Another lover?

838
00:55:07,492 --> 00:55:09,327
You should've introduced me as your younger sister.

839
00:55:09,327 --> 00:55:11,996
You want people to mistake you for my stepsister?

840
00:55:15,732 --> 00:55:17,969
So... what should we do here?

841
00:55:19,406 --> 00:55:21,339
I really don't know.

842
00:55:21,339 --> 00:55:23,274
I'll take care of it then.

843
00:55:32,917 --> 00:55:33,664
Right here.  That's right.

844
00:55:40,158 --> 00:55:41,853
Aigoo...

845
00:55:59,711 --> 00:56:03,414
You're doing well with In Hee, right?

846
00:56:04,383 --> 00:56:05,117
Huh?

847
00:56:06,217 --> 00:56:07,310
Yes.

848
00:56:08,694 --> 00:56:11,163
Why do you give that kind of response?

849
00:56:11,163 --> 00:56:13,132
You punk.

850
00:56:13,132 --> 00:56:14,433
Oh my, President Han.

851
00:56:14,433 --> 00:56:17,102
- Oh, how long has it been? 
- Oh yes!

852
00:56:17,102 --> 00:56:18,303
Have you been doing well?

853
00:56:18,303 --> 00:56:19,605
Yes, yes.

854
00:56:22,475 --> 00:56:24,443
Are you ready?

855
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:25,677
Yes.

856
00:56:25,677 --> 00:56:28,347
It's okay. Just trust me.

857
00:56:30,649 --> 00:56:32,818
Should we go?

858
00:57:08,854 --> 00:57:10,055
You came?

859
00:57:10,055 --> 00:57:10,956
Yes.

860
00:57:10,956 --> 00:57:14,193
I didn't expect that Kae In would be your partner tonight.

861
00:57:15,428 --> 00:57:18,463
Yes, Kae In came with me.

862
00:57:25,071 --> 00:57:27,239
You two know each other?

863
00:57:28,507 --> 00:57:33,845
Hold on... Kae In... how did you come here with this guy?

864
00:57:33,845 --> 00:57:36,816
I came because I wanted to.

865
00:57:36,816 --> 00:57:38,851
Hey, oppa is to die for!

866
00:57:38,851 --> 00:57:42,987
No matter what you wear...

867
00:57:45,591 --> 00:57:47,359
Hello.

868
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,661
K-Kae In?

869
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:54,200
Wow, you've become very graceful.

870
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,670
If I just put a little effort, I become very different.

871
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:58,804
Very good.

872
00:57:58,804 --> 00:58:00,506
Very good, right?

873
00:58:01,841 --> 00:58:03,576
You have to greet Director Choi.

874
00:58:03,576 --> 00:58:04,343
Right.

875
00:58:04,343 --> 00:58:07,646
Kae In, let's go.

876
00:58:15,688 --> 00:58:17,054
Hey, hey.

877
00:58:18,255 --> 00:58:19,358
How did this happen?

878
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:20,393
What?

879
00:58:20,393 --> 00:58:22,328
I mean how did those two...

880
00:58:22,328 --> 00:58:23,695
No...

881
00:58:23,695 --> 00:58:25,664
Since when did they hook up?

882
00:58:25,664 --> 00:58:28,500
If you're curious, why don't you ask them?

883
00:58:30,402 --> 00:58:31,037
What's wrong?

884
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:33,839
Now you see her looking good,

885
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:36,107
you want to get back with her?

886
00:58:38,444 --> 00:58:41,513
Just do that then.

887
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:48,521
I see your friend is accompanying you to the party?

888
00:58:49,488 --> 00:58:51,690
We meet here again.

889
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:53,459
You look beautiful.

890
00:58:53,459 --> 00:58:54,893
Thank you.

891
00:58:55,828 --> 00:58:57,262
You two...  How...?

892
00:58:57,262 --> 00:58:58,631
You don't mind if I tell him, do you?

893
00:58:59,831 --> 00:59:04,737
I wanted Professor Park to help with the selection, 
but he turned me down on the telephone.

894
00:59:04,737 --> 00:59:09,642
So to make one last effort, I went to see his daughter.

895
00:59:09,642 --> 00:59:10,743
Ah.

896
00:59:10,743 --> 00:59:12,544
I see.

897
00:59:13,367 --> 00:59:14,680
Director Jeon,

898
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,083
could I escort you to greet our guests?

899
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:19,151
Fine.

900
00:59:19,151 --> 00:59:20,952
Please go ahead.

901
00:59:20,952 --> 00:59:23,289
Since I'll be keeping your partner company.

902
00:59:23,289 --> 00:59:25,858
In that case...

903
00:59:26,525 --> 00:59:28,627
Don't worry, I'll be fine here.

904
00:59:28,627 --> 00:59:32,666
I'll be the perfect woman you made me into.

905
00:59:34,399 --> 00:59:37,236
Don't make me worry then...

906
00:59:37,236 --> 00:59:40,139
Just do me that one favor.

907
00:59:43,509 --> 00:59:44,343
Come this way please.

908
00:59:44,343 --> 00:59:45,577
Of course.

909
00:59:49,882 --> 00:59:53,552
Hey you, I didn't expect you to be with the Sang Go Jae lady.

910
00:59:53,552 --> 00:59:56,589
She is just as beautiful as her mother was in the old days.

911
00:59:56,589 --> 00:59:59,691
I brought her here because I thought she was bored.

912
01:00:01,494 --> 01:00:08,334
The man in the suit right there is MS Group's team leader.

913
01:00:08,334 --> 01:00:14,540
He would be of great help when 
the project comes into fruition.

914
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:16,809
He's a great enthusiast for medieval architecture.

915
01:00:16,809 --> 01:00:18,644
Approach him on those lines.

916
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:21,180
Right this way please.

917
01:00:22,314 --> 01:00:24,616
I like her.

918
01:00:24,616 --> 01:00:30,255
Since you're friends with Jeon Jin Ho, 
it must be of a great help to him.

919
01:00:30,255 --> 01:00:31,657
Oh, there's nothing like that.

920
01:00:32,524 --> 01:00:36,929
Jin Ho doesn't know whose daughter I am, 
and we haven't been friends for any length of time.

921
01:00:36,929 --> 01:00:38,597
Ah, is that so?

922
01:00:45,862 --> 01:00:47,473
Was that the fastest you can drive?

923
01:00:47,473 --> 01:00:50,709
The party started an hour ago!

924
01:00:52,211 --> 01:00:54,480
We're late because of traffic.

925
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,884
Even though you spent a while on your hair and makeup, you'll probably be the most beautiful.

926
01:00:58,884 --> 01:01:00,085
Of course!

927
01:01:00,085 --> 01:01:03,422
But Jin Ho oppa must be a little lonely without a partner.

928
01:01:04,056 --> 01:01:05,858
You must be uncomfortable 
carrying your train. I'll carry it for you.

929
01:01:05,858 --> 01:01:07,626
Let's hurry up then!

930
01:01:08,627 --> 01:01:10,029
T-Then...

931
01:01:10,029 --> 01:01:15,234
You mean you're... you're actually... offering me a job?

932
01:01:19,872 --> 01:01:22,975
We are planning on creating a children's gallery, you see.

933
01:01:22,975 --> 01:01:28,881
After seeing your chairs for children, 
I thought you'd be the right person for the job.

934
01:01:40,726 --> 01:01:47,767
Then, I get to design all of the furniture 
in the main lobby right?

935
01:01:48,734 --> 01:01:50,268
Then, will I-

936
01:01:50,268 --> 01:01:53,939
I think my partner may have taken up 
rather a lot of your time.

937
01:01:53,939 --> 01:01:55,140
Far from it.

938
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:57,243
We were talking about something rather important.

939
01:01:57,243 --> 01:02:00,412
But, what important issues could 
you have talked about with my friend?

940
01:02:00,412 --> 01:02:01,880
Excuse me.

941
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,415
Jin Ho,

942
01:02:03,415 --> 01:02:05,085
the Director has offered me...

943
01:02:05,085 --> 01:02:07,186
Oppa! Jin Ho oppa!

944
01:02:07,186 --> 01:02:08,954
Excuse you, excuse you.

945
01:02:10,189 --> 01:02:12,191
Oppa, seriously what gives?

946
01:02:12,191 --> 01:02:15,728
Don't you realize how awkward 
it is to go to a party without a partner?

947
01:02:16,395 --> 01:02:19,298
It seems like you have two partners tonight.

948
01:02:19,298 --> 01:02:20,900
Uh, about that...

949
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:22,835
Two partners?

950
01:02:22,835 --> 01:02:24,237
Who's the other one besides me?

951
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:26,667
Who are you?

952
01:02:26,667 --> 01:02:27,506
I'm...

953
01:02:28,106 --> 01:02:30,009
I am Park Kae In.

954
01:02:30,009 --> 01:02:34,646
Oh, here you are!  You can accompany 
your oppa who's all alone, right?

955
01:02:34,646 --> 01:02:37,416
Why would I be your partner and leave Jin Ho oppa all alone?

956
01:02:37,416 --> 01:02:39,885
Oppa, what happened?

957
01:02:39,885 --> 01:02:41,287
Miss Park Kae In,

958
01:02:41,287 --> 01:02:43,789
let's finish our conversation next time we meet. I have to go.

959
01:02:44,623 --> 01:02:47,359
You can come to my office next time, right?

960
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:49,662
Of course.

961
01:02:49,662 --> 01:02:51,497
Then... I'll be going my way.

962
01:02:51,497 --> 01:02:53,865
Yes. Goodbye.

963
01:02:57,436 --> 01:03:01,172
What do we do? I don't think he found that amusing.

964
01:03:03,275 --> 01:03:04,701
You, how did you get in here?

965
01:03:04,701 --> 01:03:06,745
I was the one who brought her here.

966
01:03:06,745 --> 01:03:08,380
I specifically told you not to do so.

967
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:11,410
How many times did I tell you that 
your best way of helping us is to do nothing?

968
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:14,620
I-I thought he didn't have a partner.

969
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:16,255
This woman, I asked who she is.

970
01:03:16,255 --> 01:03:18,857
Tell me who she is.

971
01:03:19,892 --> 01:03:23,962
Hye Mi, let's talk outside. 
Kae In, just a minute please.

972
01:03:23,996 --> 01:03:25,731
Are you caring for her now?

973
01:03:25,731 --> 01:03:30,035
No, it's not that he's caring for me...

974
01:03:30,035 --> 01:03:31,569
Aigoo.

975
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:33,906
I guess you're in the dark about it...

976
01:03:33,906 --> 01:03:37,009
It's really going to break your heart...

977
01:03:37,743 --> 01:03:39,445
Park Kae In, can you please..

978
01:03:39,445 --> 01:03:40,879
Jin Ho!

979
01:03:40,879 --> 01:03:43,148
How long were you planning on hiding this from everybody?

980
01:03:43,148 --> 01:03:44,316
Huh?

981
01:03:46,218 --> 01:03:48,354
There's nothing to hide. 
What are you talking about?

982
01:03:48,354 --> 01:03:52,027
You have to clean up this mess once and for all.

983
01:03:52,027 --> 01:03:58,364
Think about what wounds you can inflict on this young lady.
