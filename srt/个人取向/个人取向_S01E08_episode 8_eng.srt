1
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:11,949
 Answer me. 

2
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:13,751
 Admit that you came to take advantage of Director Choi. 

3
00:00:14,786 --> 00:00:15,920
 If not... 

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,020
 Are you saying you're really gay? 

5
00:00:23,494 --> 00:00:25,029
 That's right. 

6
00:00:30,034 --> 00:00:31,235
 I... 

7
00:00:35,506 --> 00:00:36,940
 I am gay. 

8
00:00:49,286 --> 00:00:51,921
 What's your relationship with that man? 

9
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:54,558
 Why do you keep hanging around that dirty guy? 

10
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:56,860
 What... are you in a relationship with 
 a gay man or something? 

11
00:01:01,232 --> 00:01:02,265
 You... 

12
00:01:02,265 --> 00:01:04,167
 I think you're feeling sympathy for him but 

13
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:06,169
 Kae In, get your head straight... 

14
00:01:06,169 --> 00:01:11,474
 He's a guy who found out that Director Choi 
is gay and tried to take advantage of him! 

15
00:01:11,474 --> 00:01:17,680
 He was only interested in trying to get the Dam Arts Center project by taking advantage of Director Choi. He's a dirty guy! 

16
00:01:23,353 --> 00:01:27,490
 Even though you're a guy who only treats love like a toy, 

17
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,258
 Jin Ho isn't like that. 

18
00:01:29,258 --> 00:01:32,561
 Jin Ho isn't the type of person 
to take advantage of people or use them! 

19
00:01:32,561 --> 00:01:34,564
 How would you know? 

20
00:01:34,564 --> 00:01:36,898
 Because I know! 

21
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:38,334
 Unlike you, 

22
00:01:38,334 --> 00:01:40,369
 I know him a lot more. 

23
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:42,037
 So... 

24
00:01:42,038 --> 00:01:43,839
 Quit talking nonsense. 

25
00:01:48,411 --> 00:01:49,912
 Director Choi... 

26
00:01:49,912 --> 00:01:51,146
 is what? 

27
00:01:52,615 --> 00:01:54,116
 Did you still not know? 

28
00:01:54,116 --> 00:01:56,118
 I thought you were supposed to be Director Choi's right-hand man. 

29
00:01:56,853 --> 00:01:58,587
 So then, Director Choi... 

30
00:01:58,587 --> 00:01:59,622
 And Jin Ho were... 

31
00:01:59,622 --> 00:02:01,923
 Jin Ho must be really happy... 

32
00:02:01,923 --> 00:02:03,724
 Because he can get around anywhere. 

33
00:02:25,914 --> 00:02:27,215
Jin Ho...

34
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,738
 Jin Ho... 

35
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:53,074
 I'm calling because I'm worried. 

36
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:56,744
 If you're driving in that kind of mood, 
you could get in an accident! 

37
00:02:56,744 --> 00:03:00,381
 So just park the car and take a deep breath. 

38
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:05,152
 Don't do anything else but
 inhale deeply and exhale deeply. 

39
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:08,122
 You're going to do that for me, right? 

40
00:03:21,231 --> 00:03:24,310
 

41
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:32,446
Are you writing the ancestral tablet?

42
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:34,248
Yeah. Hyung, how'd you get here?

43
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:37,484
Your mom called saying we should eat together.

44
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:39,856
Aigoo, you punk.

45
00:03:39,856 --> 00:03:43,022
How do you write so neatly?

46
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,360
Aigoo...

47
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:52,632
It's because I'm me that's around you. 
Around guys, with your style you'll surely be a loner.

48
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,071
Are you upset?

49
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,909
Did something bad happen 
at the Dam Art Gallery?

50
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:04,885
No.

51
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,180
That's strange...

52
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,883
I smell it.

53
00:04:15,053 --> 00:04:17,156
I smell something fishy...

54
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,093
What are you doing?

55
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:22,528
What are you doing to my Jin Ho oppa?

56
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,542
Do what?

57
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:27,266
What you were doing just now... 
Do you have any idea how weird that looks?

58
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,435
Sang Jun oppa...

59
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,003
By any chance, do you like men?

60
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,939
Hye Mi,

61
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:35,341
can you help me?

62
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,475
Yes.

63
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:42,381
You know...

64
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,385
Perhaps I really  am  in love with you?

65
00:04:47,385 --> 00:04:50,856
Even a clueless thing like Hye Mi finds it suspicious.

66
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,625
Makes me wonder...

67
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,828
Am I in love with you?

68
00:04:57,596 --> 00:04:58,831
Wait outside.

69
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,366
Wow... You're really sexy being 
so cold-hearted, darling.

70
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:02,534
I said to wait outside.

71
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:03,733
Okay.

72
00:05:04,436 --> 00:05:05,470
Mother!

73
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:11,141
Please set me up on a blind date! I think I've been living single too long, I'm full of energy!

74
00:06:00,491 --> 00:06:01,992
What?!

75
00:06:01,992 --> 00:06:03,060
Really?!

76
00:06:06,664 --> 00:06:08,999
Jin Ho has a lot of courage.

77
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,802
It wouldn't have been easy for him...

78
00:06:11,802 --> 00:06:15,806
I'm curious as to what he's doing right now... 
because he's not answering his phone.

79
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:18,842
Also...

80
00:06:18,842 --> 00:06:20,577
What else? What?

81
00:06:21,245 --> 00:06:23,046
I caused a scene today.

82
00:06:23,581 --> 00:06:26,483
What did you get into this time? 
What? Tell me.

83
00:06:26,483 --> 00:06:28,651
I slapped Han Chang Ryul in the face.

84
00:06:29,986 --> 00:06:31,387
You?

85
00:06:32,489 --> 00:06:34,524
Really? You?

86
00:06:34,524 --> 00:06:36,226
My friend, Park Kae In?!

87
00:06:36,226 --> 00:06:37,427
That's right!

88
00:06:37,427 --> 00:06:39,195
But, why?

89
00:06:39,196 --> 00:06:41,330
With what courage?

90
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,801
I'm not sure why I did it either.

91
00:06:44,801 --> 00:06:49,372
Chang Ryul was saying that Jin Ho was a dirty person.

92
00:06:49,372 --> 00:06:52,008
And without me knowing, my hand just 
went up and slapped him right across the face.

93
00:06:52,008 --> 00:06:54,277
You...

94
00:06:54,277 --> 00:06:58,547
Are you sure you're not seeing Jin Ho in another way?

95
00:07:01,117 --> 00:07:04,320
Wh-Wha-What? 
What do you mean in another way?

96
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,622
That's what I'm saying. Jin Ho...

97
00:07:06,622 --> 00:07:08,958
You know, like a friendship gone weird.

98
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:12,227
Well things can happen when the two of you are living together.

99
00:07:12,227 --> 00:07:15,264
You know, cause then the friendship gets weird...

100
00:07:15,998 --> 00:07:17,752
Hey! You!

101
00:07:17,752 --> 00:07:20,135
You're talking crazy talk... This person...

102
00:07:20,135 --> 00:07:24,306
Our relationship is just a friendship! A friendship.

103
00:07:24,306 --> 00:07:27,275
It's just between a man and woman. A beautiful friendship.

104
00:07:27,275 --> 00:07:30,178
This person... talking about ridiculous things...

105
00:07:33,982 --> 00:07:35,250
Friendship?

106
00:07:58,373 --> 00:07:59,474
What's wrong with you?

107
00:07:59,474 --> 00:08:02,410
I heard you went out driving recklessly.

108
00:08:04,147 --> 00:08:06,047
Hyung,

109
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,985
why is living so complicated?

110
00:08:11,786 --> 00:08:12,653
W-What's wrong?

111
00:08:12,653 --> 00:08:13,888
Did something happen?

112
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,492
About the Dam Arts Center Project...

113
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,094
Should we drop it?

114
00:08:21,295 --> 00:08:24,131
What's the point of just dropping out, 
we've got nothing left.

115
00:08:32,172 --> 00:08:33,607
 I... 

116
00:08:35,008 --> 00:08:36,043
 I am gay. 

117
00:08:37,111 --> 00:08:39,913
 So you're saying you were never really a man? 

118
00:08:39,913 --> 00:08:43,617
 If your father knew, he'd roll over in his grave. 

119
00:08:43,617 --> 00:08:44,651
 Stop it! 

120
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:46,019
 Who are you to be laughing at him? 

121
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:49,022
 It's not like Jin Ho wanted to be born this way. 

122
00:09:09,943 --> 00:09:11,211
You're home?

123
00:09:14,014 --> 00:09:15,648
What are you doing instead of sleeping?

124
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:17,850
I couldn't sleep...

125
00:09:18,518 --> 00:09:21,220
It seems like you had some alcohol...

126
00:09:21,621 --> 00:09:23,156
Yes, a little.

127
00:09:24,624 --> 00:09:26,492
Looking from before, it seems...

128
00:09:26,492 --> 00:09:29,266
It looks like you're tired. Go in and rest.

129
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:36,106
But, Jin Ho...

130
00:09:40,377 --> 00:09:44,880
Why did you reveal so much 
during the conversation before?

131
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,557
You don't like to talk about this, right? I'm sorry.

132
00:09:54,557 --> 00:09:56,359
Go in and rest.

133
00:10:08,571 --> 00:10:11,073
That Chang Ryul guy...

134
00:10:11,073 --> 00:10:14,210
accused me of taking advantage of Director Choi...

135
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:19,881
But that's when I saw Director Choi's eyes.

136
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:23,786
Those eyes...

137
00:10:25,254 --> 00:10:27,356
looked very sad.

138
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:31,259
I couldn't just ignore it...

139
00:10:34,063 --> 00:10:35,130
So that's what happened...

140
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,265
But...

141
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:39,368
is that all?

142
00:10:43,438 --> 00:10:45,474
The thought of winning against that Chang Ryul guy...

143
00:10:45,474 --> 00:10:47,776
wasn't it a scheme to take advantage of the situation?

144
00:10:49,311 --> 00:10:50,846
Or...

145
00:10:51,947 --> 00:10:54,416
did I really want to take advantage of Director Choi

146
00:10:55,217 --> 00:10:58,153
and win the Dam Arts Center project?

147
00:11:01,323 --> 00:11:02,991
I don't really know.

148
00:11:04,226 --> 00:11:06,361
Jin Ho, you're not that kind of person.

149
00:11:09,064 --> 00:11:10,565
Why do you always take my side like that?

150
00:11:10,565 --> 00:11:12,266
Because I'm your friend.

151
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:15,703
Friends always take each other's sides.

152
00:11:16,637 --> 00:11:17,939
But you're always the one who gets cheated.

153
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:19,007
Hey!

154
00:11:19,007 --> 00:11:22,409
No matter how stupid I may be, 
would I get cheated by you?

155
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,952
To tell you the truth...

156
00:11:30,952 --> 00:11:32,320
I'm-

157
00:11:33,187 --> 00:11:35,456
I'd better get to work now.

158
00:11:35,456 --> 00:11:37,190
Jin Ho, do you know this?

159
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,126
They say that a tree

160
00:11:38,126 --> 00:11:42,429
is much better-looking 
with some knots and some scars.

161
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:45,299
Good night.

162
00:11:47,435 --> 00:11:55,076


163
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:07,054
I'm alright.

164
00:12:07,054 --> 00:12:09,289
There were plenty of times when you helped me.

165
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:11,258
Then hold it properly.

166
00:12:16,764 --> 00:12:18,398
Here.

167
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,234
Jin Ho,

168
00:12:21,234 --> 00:12:22,202
would you like to help me?

169
00:12:22,202 --> 00:12:24,838
You could be my special assistant.

170
00:12:24,838 --> 00:12:26,840
I'm a person who does big things.

171
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,941
Don't push me around.

172
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:31,244
Are you telling me that I only 
make furniture that doesn't sell?

173
00:12:31,244 --> 00:12:32,278
Yes.

174
00:12:32,712 --> 00:12:35,014
Giving me such a headache...

175
00:12:35,015 --> 00:12:36,382
But you should try to make something anyways.

176
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:38,284
If I make a lot of money,

177
00:12:38,284 --> 00:12:40,086
who knows whether or not I'll buy them all.

178
00:12:40,086 --> 00:12:42,088
Sympathy is a rejection.

179
00:12:42,088 --> 00:12:43,289
Really?

180
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:46,292
I'm a person who carries a lot of pride with her.

181
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:48,327
Do you know what pride is?

182
00:12:51,464 --> 00:12:52,531
Oh!

183
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:57,636
Don't hold that near me! When I first moved here, I thought 
I was going to die of a heart attack because of that thing.

184
00:12:57,636 --> 00:12:59,138
Then why are you saying that I have no pride-

185
00:12:59,138 --> 00:13:00,706
Ah! Just put that thing down!

186
00:13:00,706 --> 00:13:02,208
Then what about my pride?

187
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,108
It's the best!

188
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:04,642
- Put that down quickly. 
- Okay.

189
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,646
Jin Ho.

190
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,949
Don't I look different?

191
00:13:45,984 --> 00:13:48,786
Do you think a squash can magically 
transform into a watermelon?

192
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:52,121
Even so, I'm wearing a hat,

193
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:53,924
and I put some lipstick on.

194
00:13:54,392 --> 00:13:56,494
Aren't you wearing the hat 
because you didn't wash your hair?

195
00:13:56,494 --> 00:13:58,396
Yes, you're right.

196
00:13:59,564 --> 00:14:00,899
Jin Ho! That's the bus I have to take!

197
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,233
Please, drop me off here. 
Quickly, quickly!

198
00:14:24,956 --> 00:14:26,590
Jin Ho!

199
00:14:52,616 --> 00:14:53,783
Kae In.

200
00:14:57,154 --> 00:14:58,322
Let's talk for a little bit.

201
00:14:58,322 --> 00:15:00,557
I have nothing to talk about with you.

202
00:15:02,492 --> 00:15:03,793
I do.

203
00:15:05,796 --> 00:15:08,330
I have to work. Hurry up and say it.

204
00:15:09,099 --> 00:15:12,001
You're really a different person now.

205
00:15:12,001 --> 00:15:14,103
You should have been like this before.

206
00:15:15,238 --> 00:15:17,106
No matter how long I made you wait for me...

207
00:15:17,106 --> 00:15:19,275
and I always had everything my way,

208
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:22,345
you never knew how to get mad at me, 
it must have been tiring.

209
00:15:24,514 --> 00:15:27,483
I understood you when I talked 
about that Jin Ho guy that way.

210
00:15:27,483 --> 00:15:29,819
But you hitting my cheek...

211
00:15:29,819 --> 00:15:32,054
I was really shocked.

212
00:15:33,623 --> 00:15:36,458
Is she really the Park Kae In I once knew?

213
00:15:37,226 --> 00:15:39,094
Even though I got mad,

214
00:15:39,094 --> 00:15:41,597
to tell you the truth, I was rather anxious.

215
00:15:42,398 --> 00:15:45,867
If you were this honest to me from the very beginning,

216
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:48,036
we wouldn't be like this.

217
00:15:48,036 --> 00:15:50,071
I didn't want this to happen.

218
00:15:50,706 --> 00:15:53,275
What did you want to talk about right now?

219
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,378
What I didn't know...

220
00:15:57,746 --> 00:15:59,981
I want to know more about you now.

221
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:04,618
Kae In... I know this might not make sense but...

222
00:16:06,755 --> 00:16:08,857
I want to start things over again with you.

223
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,562
Do you think  that makes any sense?

224
00:16:13,562 --> 00:16:15,596
Although it may not make sense to you,

225
00:16:15,596 --> 00:16:17,164
it does to me.

226
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:20,635
I understand well that your heart

227
00:16:20,635 --> 00:16:21,737
won't be easy to open right now.

228
00:16:21,737 --> 00:16:23,671
However,

229
00:16:23,671 --> 00:16:25,206
I'll wait.

230
00:16:26,641 --> 00:16:28,809
To you,

231
00:16:29,377 --> 00:16:31,312
I must still be an easy catch.

232
00:16:32,347 --> 00:16:33,948
Right now,

233
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:35,883
whatever you say is good.

234
00:16:37,085 --> 00:16:38,986
In front of my mother, pretending to be In Hee,

235
00:16:38,986 --> 00:16:41,989
and helping me out, I was truly thankful.

236
00:16:43,925 --> 00:16:45,493
To you, I was always

237
00:16:46,293 --> 00:16:49,129
never good enough for you.

238
00:16:50,063 --> 00:16:51,499
But at one point,

239
00:16:51,832 --> 00:16:54,168
you gave me everything I needed.

240
00:16:56,337 --> 00:16:58,172
Kae In...

241
00:16:58,305 --> 00:17:00,274
I really don't want to lose you.

242
00:17:00,274 --> 00:17:02,342
Stop talking nonsense,

243
00:17:02,342 --> 00:17:03,044
and leave now.

244
00:17:03,044 --> 00:17:05,712
Kae In, please think about starting over again.

245
00:17:05,712 --> 00:17:08,148
If you're angry, then get angry at me.

246
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:10,183
If you want to hit me again, then hit me.

247
00:17:10,183 --> 00:17:13,153
If you want to think of me as a crazy man, then do so.

248
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:16,790
I'll be waiting for you,

249
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,525
like the way you waited for me.

250
00:17:22,496 --> 00:17:23,697
From now on,

251
00:17:23,697 --> 00:17:25,866
I don't want to hear anything you have to say.

252
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,148
What is this?!

253
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:44,984
Hey! The Dam Arts Center project 
qualifications have been changed again.

254
00:17:44,984 --> 00:17:46,286
They'll give an exception.

255
00:17:46,286 --> 00:17:47,354
Really?

256
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:49,422
How?

257
00:17:50,624 --> 00:17:53,860
A person or company that does 
not fall under the qualification.

258
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,329
One will have the chance to compete against

259
00:17:56,329 --> 00:17:58,697
the qualified.

260
00:17:59,932 --> 00:18:00,833
Then...

261
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,301
Then does that mean there'll be two screenings?

262
00:18:02,301 --> 00:18:05,071
Who cares, we might have another chance!

263
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:07,406
It seems as if the Heavens haven't thrown us away yet.

264
00:18:09,308 --> 00:18:10,409
Hey, Jin Ho!

265
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:13,145
It's been changed, we can enter again.

266
00:18:13,145 --> 00:18:14,546
The Dam Arts Center project.

267
00:18:15,014 --> 00:18:17,350
But, why did they change the qualifications so suddenly?

268
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,685
Do you think people did nothing about it?

269
00:18:19,685 --> 00:18:23,054
That's why the MS Group home page was down!

270
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,100
It's because the company 
have their own reputation to live up to.

271
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,300
So it's a solution they thought of.

272
00:18:28,326 --> 00:18:29,595
That's exactly it!

273
00:18:29,595 --> 00:18:32,097
No, this isn't it. Director Choi isn't the 
type to change his mind so easily.

274
00:18:32,097 --> 00:18:33,966
There has to be a reason for this.

275
00:18:33,966 --> 00:18:36,201
I'm going to expose that secret.

276
00:18:36,535 --> 00:18:38,470
Stop talking nonsense.

277
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,304
Go get working.

278
00:18:39,304 --> 00:18:41,139
Hey. Hi-five!

279
00:18:41,139 --> 00:18:42,141
Hey, Jin Ho. Hi-five!

280
00:18:42,141 --> 00:18:43,608
Stop going overboard.

281
00:18:43,608 --> 00:18:45,677
Our chances are getting slimmer.

282
00:18:47,246 --> 00:18:49,480
Wait... President...

283
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,216
How did this happen...?

284
00:18:52,884 --> 00:18:54,319
Ah, yes.

285
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:59,523
I totally understand the fact that
 Director Choi is your son, but...

286
00:18:59,523 --> 00:19:00,992
Even then,

287
00:19:00,992 --> 00:19:02,927
for the Dam Arts Center, you should have uprooted your son's wishes.

288
00:19:02,927 --> 00:19:04,011
I thought...

289
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:07,047
Ah, yes.

290
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:08,815
I'm sorry. You must be busy.

291
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,584
Yes, please continue working. Goodbye.

292
00:19:13,954 --> 00:19:16,389
What did President Choi say?

293
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:17,657
What?

294
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:20,527
Since when can children win their parents over?!

295
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:26,933
Did Director Choi come out that strongly?

296
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:30,603
I mean, how strong did he fight 
to get the President to change his mind?

297
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:31,738
This is all...

298
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:35,474
so he can get Jin Ho a tiny spot.

299
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:38,444
Director Choi did this!

300
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,613
There's going to be a lot of tension.

301
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:43,649
Yes, I understand.

302
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:46,452
Wait outside.

303
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,295
I need a special plan!

304
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,164
A special plan.

305
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,500
Please sit.

306
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:21,553
I would like you to do a background check

307
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,922
on Jeon Jin Ho of M Construction Architectural Firm.

308
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,524
If I'm doing a background check...

309
00:20:26,524 --> 00:20:27,800
where do I start?

310
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,003
Oh, wow, you really didn't know!

311
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:45,009
Oh my, oh my. Then J-Jin Ho is...

312
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:47,579
C-C-Coming out?

313
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,881
Yeah! Did it catch you off guard, honey?

314
00:20:50,881 --> 00:20:55,800
Then...  you must not have known 
about Director Choi and Jin Ho at all, huh?

315
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:03,461
I heard that you and your friend, Tae Hoon 
or what not, were wearing couple shirts.

316
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:05,863
I heard it all from Kae In.

317
00:21:05,863 --> 00:21:06,647
Why?

318
00:21:06,647 --> 00:21:08,599
Did you betray him first?

319
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,168
Oh my, oh my.  That... What do you...

320
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:14,939
Heterosexual relationships are hard as it is...
But looking at it, homosexual relationships are even harder.

321
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:16,107
Unni, unni...

322
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:19,643
I'm sorry, but I think I'm going to have 
to go ahead and leave.

323
00:21:19,643 --> 00:21:20,611
I'm s-sorry...

324
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,200
Oh, it's gotten to this level. 
How embarrassing.

325
00:21:32,056 --> 00:21:33,757
Did I make a mistake in telling him?

326
00:21:33,757 --> 00:21:37,027
He's the one who betrayed him first,
so why is he making such a big deal out of it?

327
00:21:39,129 --> 00:21:40,061
Jin Ho...

328
00:21:40,698 --> 00:21:41,898
Hey, you...

329
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:44,100
Hey, you...

330
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,403
In front of Chang Ryu... With Director Choi...

331
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,405
Coming out?

332
00:21:50,607 --> 00:21:51,608
How did you know about that?

333
00:21:51,608 --> 00:21:52,876
I heard it from Young Sun unni.

334
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:54,511
Hey, would you stop with the "unni"?

335
00:21:54,511 --> 00:21:56,813
My unni isn't the important thing right now, Jin Ho.

336
00:21:57,581 --> 00:21:59,115
How could you go that far...?

337
00:22:00,117 --> 00:22:01,985
I'm going to the Dam Art Gallery, 
and then I'm going home.

338
00:22:01,985 --> 00:22:03,086
Why are you going to the Dam Art Gallery?

339
00:22:03,086 --> 00:22:04,120
To meet Director Choi.

340
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,288
To go on a date?

341
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,528
Hey, Jin Ho...

342
00:22:11,528 --> 00:22:12,762
You know you can't do that.

343
00:22:12,762 --> 00:22:15,364
What's the use in saying, "I'm not gay" now?

344
00:22:15,364 --> 00:22:17,233
Look, whether or not it's a misunderstanding,

345
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:18,568
Director Choi is forgoing his own feelings to help us,

346
00:22:18,568 --> 00:22:20,570
so you can't just go and ruin it like this.

347
00:22:21,404 --> 00:22:22,279
For now,

348
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:24,140
after we've finished the project,

349
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,209
then let's go and clear this all up.

350
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:29,912
This is an opportunity from the heavens, 
so we have to grab it.

351
00:22:29,912 --> 00:22:31,280
We have to.

352
00:22:39,522 --> 00:22:40,556
Welcome.

353
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:43,959
Please sit.

354
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:44,593
Yes.

355
00:22:51,501 --> 00:22:53,335
If you came to tell me how grateful you are,

356
00:22:54,002 --> 00:22:55,003
I'll decline.

357
00:22:56,071 --> 00:22:57,139
I have only

358
00:22:57,139 --> 00:22:59,508
opened a small door for you...

359
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:01,276
But I hope that, through the passage of that door,

360
00:23:01,276 --> 00:23:03,178
you can enter a different world

361
00:23:03,178 --> 00:23:04,446
by your means,

362
00:23:04,446 --> 00:23:06,014
Mr. Jeon.

363
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,425
I'm sorry.

364
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,588
You've created a path for me

365
00:23:13,588 --> 00:23:16,524
with your feelings for me, but I...

366
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:18,159
What is it?

367
00:23:19,728 --> 00:23:22,397
I cannot share those sentiments, 
Director Choi.

368
00:23:24,566 --> 00:23:26,534
You're going to think of me as a despicable bastard.

369
00:23:27,502 --> 00:23:29,170
You'll think that, now that I've got a chance...

370
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,139
I'm saying something different.

371
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,541
However,

372
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:36,578
I didn't want to tell you the truth before,

373
00:23:37,746 --> 00:23:40,648
because I didn't want to give off 
the impression that I am using you...

374
00:23:40,648 --> 00:23:41,483
Do you...

375
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,652
really want to make me out to be a bad person?

376
00:23:48,723 --> 00:23:50,024
Do you think I'm using business

377
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:54,028
to get someone's heart?

378
00:23:58,466 --> 00:23:59,733
Sometime in the future,

379
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,036
let's go fishing.

380
00:24:02,536 --> 00:24:05,639
This time, I'll show you my skills...

381
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:13,847
I have prior engagements...

382
00:24:17,585 --> 00:24:19,353
The gratitude you've shown me,

383
00:24:20,287 --> 00:24:22,623
I'll add it to my hard work.

384
00:24:22,623 --> 00:24:25,158
That's what I wanted to hear.

385
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:53,453
Congratulations.

386
00:24:53,453 --> 00:24:55,254
On being put back in the competition.

387
00:24:55,822 --> 00:24:56,735
Thank you.

388
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,858
Don't you think

389
00:24:58,858 --> 00:25:00,393
you need to take me out to eat once more?

390
00:25:00,827 --> 00:25:02,128
In exchange for my help?

391
00:25:09,168 --> 00:25:10,136
Yesterday,

392
00:25:10,136 --> 00:25:12,004
something rather unbelievable happened.

393
00:25:12,972 --> 00:25:14,774
Because of you,

394
00:25:14,774 --> 00:25:17,276
Kae In slapped Chang Ryul in the face.

395
00:25:18,811 --> 00:25:20,813
Did she do it for your sake, because you're her friend?

396
00:25:23,516 --> 00:25:24,583
Perhaps Kae In...

397
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:28,087
also feels something different towards you, whatever it is.

398
00:25:28,087 --> 00:25:29,888
That's what I wondered.

399
00:25:31,857 --> 00:25:34,393
Since three years ago, when the Dam Art Gallery started,

400
00:25:34,393 --> 00:25:37,129
I helped Director Choi.

401
00:25:38,364 --> 00:25:40,966
When I started working for him

402
00:25:40,966 --> 00:25:44,903
I even thought about

403
00:25:44,903 --> 00:25:46,772
becoming the wife of Director Choi.

404
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,375
If I want to reveal my self, I have to come clean.

405
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:51,676
You have to do it right.

406
00:25:52,044 --> 00:25:53,245
But...

407
00:25:53,812 --> 00:25:55,447
the feeling was weird.

408
00:25:56,114 --> 00:25:58,717
We went on work trips together,

409
00:25:58,717 --> 00:26:02,353
and there were many nights when the two of us
 worked late in the office, alone.

410
00:26:03,088 --> 00:26:05,590
But strangely, I never felt an attraction to him as a man.

411
00:26:07,514 --> 00:26:08,336
If you've lived in another's house for a long time, as I have,

412
00:26:08,336 --> 00:26:10,261
If you've lived in another's house for a long time, as I have,

413
00:26:10,261 --> 00:26:11,096
your senses become sharper.

414
00:26:11,096 --> 00:26:12,730
I don't really...

415
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,199
get what you're trying to say.

416
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:16,167
But with you, Jin Ho,

417
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:18,203
I don't have that same feeling I had with Director Choi.

418
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:20,638
I don't understand why I must keep having these kinds of conversations.

419
00:26:20,638 --> 00:26:21,606
I don't understand why I must keep having these kinds of conversations.

420
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,208
Perhaps I like...

421
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:26,444
having these kinds of conversations with you, Jin Ho.

422
00:26:30,014 --> 00:26:30,958
I'm sorry.

423
00:26:31,582 --> 00:26:33,317
I need to get going.

424
00:26:35,453 --> 00:26:36,496
Mr. Jeon...

425
00:26:38,422 --> 00:26:39,991
Kae In's Sang Go Jae...

426
00:26:39,991 --> 00:26:41,358
Why did you choose to live there?

427
00:26:43,594 --> 00:26:45,996
You probably happened upon it by chance...

428
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,000
and decided to move in, right?

429
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,700
Park Kae In.

430
00:27:09,386 --> 00:27:15,091
I am Han Chang Ryul's father.

431
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,400
Hello.

432
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:29,205
I'd figure you might not want to meet up if I called you.

433
00:27:29,205 --> 00:27:32,542
That's why I came in person instead.

434
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:36,346
On what... business... are you here?

435
00:27:36,913 --> 00:27:39,047
To get straight to the point,

436
00:27:39,047 --> 00:27:41,918
I'm coming here on behalf of my son to apologize.

437
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,754
That fool,

438
00:27:44,754 --> 00:27:48,424
he had been beat around so much, 
he got seduced by that fox like girl.

439
00:27:48,424 --> 00:27:54,029
And it seems that he left you
 with a deep scar in the process.

440
00:27:55,331 --> 00:27:56,325
That's all...

441
00:27:56,325 --> 00:27:57,600
in the past now.

442
00:28:00,836 --> 00:28:02,137
"All... in the past now."

443
00:28:02,137 --> 00:28:04,106
"All... in the past now."

444
00:28:05,408 --> 00:28:06,542
You truly are completely different from that fox-like woman.

445
00:28:06,542 --> 00:28:10,846
You truly are completely different from that fox-like woman.

446
00:28:14,483 --> 00:28:19,588
How could he not see that a person like you
 would fit so perfectly in our household

447
00:28:19,588 --> 00:28:26,495
and make such a foolish mistake? 
 As a father I have nothing better to say.

448
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:28,299
I...

449
00:28:29,832 --> 00:28:33,401
don't really know what you are trying to say.

450
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:36,237
Miss Park Kae In,

451
00:28:36,237 --> 00:28:39,341
if I had known that you were Professor Park Chul Han's daughter,

452
00:28:39,341 --> 00:28:43,577
I wouldn't have just left the issue alone the way I did.

453
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,617
For a family in architectural business,

454
00:28:50,617 --> 00:28:57,290
if we became in-laws with a 
great professor like Park Chul Han,

455
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:02,829
that would be like giving us a wing.

456
00:29:04,131 --> 00:29:05,932
In any case,

457
00:29:05,932 --> 00:29:08,301
trust me,

458
00:29:08,301 --> 00:29:11,104
and please accept him.

459
00:29:25,685 --> 00:29:26,842
Han Chang Ryul...

460
00:29:28,188 --> 00:29:29,442
Really!

461
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:32,658
You really make a person feel
 pathetic right to the very end.

462
00:29:35,128 --> 00:29:36,229
Kae In!

463
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:37,670
Kae In!

464
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:40,733
Where is she... Kae In!  Kae In!

465
00:29:41,133 --> 00:29:42,101
What?

466
00:29:42,602 --> 00:29:44,370
Hey, but... Why is your hair like that?

467
00:29:44,871 --> 00:29:46,239
Anyways, I have great news.

468
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:47,640
It's the best.

469
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,342
- You know those chairs that I put up for sale on my website? 
- Yes.

470
00:29:50,943 --> 00:29:52,478
They've all sold out.

471
00:29:52,478 --> 00:29:53,779
I'm saying they've all been sold.

472
00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:54,813
- Really? 
- Yeah.

473
00:29:54,813 --> 00:29:57,750
But the most important thing is, 
do you know who bought all of them?

474
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,450
Who?

475
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,452
Han Chang Ryul, that crazy bastard.

476
00:30:03,355 --> 00:30:04,289
Hey.

477
00:30:04,857 --> 00:30:06,491
I'm flipping out.

478
00:30:09,853 --> 00:30:25,311


479
00:30:30,482 --> 00:30:33,020
Why don't you know how to be careful? 
Let me see.

480
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,387
It's fine.

481
00:30:55,173 --> 00:30:56,307
What happened?

482
00:30:59,444 --> 00:31:01,178
You know, you have a strange habit.

483
00:31:03,915 --> 00:31:06,217
When you're angry, you hurt yourself...

484
00:31:07,118 --> 00:31:08,485
That's the strange habit.

485
00:31:09,387 --> 00:31:10,955
I'm just that dumb...

486
00:31:12,823 --> 00:31:13,791
Everyone else

487
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:15,392
probably sees me as insignificant, too.

488
00:31:29,373 --> 00:31:30,362
Kae In...

489
00:31:30,808 --> 00:31:32,876
You giving me the first call,

490
00:31:32,876 --> 00:31:34,144
it really shocked me.

491
00:31:35,312 --> 00:31:37,414
What happened to your hand? 
Did you get hurt?

492
00:31:39,082 --> 00:31:40,150
What are your motives?

493
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:46,022
You bought all of my chairs off of Young Sun's site. 
What are your motives behind that?

494
00:31:46,723 --> 00:31:47,681
Ah, that...

495
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:52,662
I wanted to resolve things with Young Sun &gt;br&gt;and she won't answer my calls.

496
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:56,466
So I thought I might at least write an e-mail, 
and I went on her site...

497
00:31:56,466 --> 00:31:58,268
and I saw that your chairs were up there for sale.

498
00:31:58,268 --> 00:31:59,344
Why?

499
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:01,504
Why did you do something like that?

500
00:32:02,572 --> 00:32:04,907
Even if they weren't for sale and
 you bought them anyways.

501
00:32:04,907 --> 00:32:07,376
Did you think I'd be thankful?

502
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:08,978
That's not it...

503
00:32:09,746 --> 00:32:13,883
I just want what's special to you
 to be special to me, as well.

504
00:32:13,883 --> 00:32:15,918
And also, those chairs...

505
00:32:15,918 --> 00:32:20,789
I'm gonna send them to poor people who live far away.

506
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:23,325
Slowly, I'm trying to become a nicer person too.

507
00:32:23,325 --> 00:32:25,027
Can't you just see this as a nice gesture?

508
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:28,997
Do you really...

509
00:32:28,997 --> 00:32:30,533
want to start things over again with me?

510
00:32:32,435 --> 00:32:33,735
Park Kae In!

511
00:32:43,312 --> 00:32:44,947
And what exactly are you doing?

512
00:32:44,947 --> 00:32:48,016
My mind is full, so I'm trying to clear it.

513
00:32:55,323 --> 00:32:57,159
I used to be able to do it for five minutes...

514
00:32:58,026 --> 00:32:59,960
I guess I'm getting old now.

515
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:03,198
Do you think doing that for five minutes 
would get your head straight?

516
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:08,903
But during those five minutes, all the blood just rushes 
to my head, and I can't bring myself to think about anything.

517
00:33:10,172 --> 00:33:12,107
Why is your head so frustrated?

518
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,213
This won't do. I'd better run.

519
00:33:36,665 --> 00:33:41,769
 If I had known that you were Professor 
Park Chul Han's precious daughter then, 

520
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:45,005
 I wouldn't have let you go. 

521
00:33:47,441 --> 00:33:50,077
 Kae In, I know this is crazy, but... 

522
00:33:50,077 --> 00:33:52,246
 I want to start over with you. 

523
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,900
You're not even athletic, 
so why are you running so much?

524
00:34:14,968 --> 00:34:16,269
Did you get yourself into some kind of problem again?

525
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,048
I...

526
00:34:24,048 --> 00:34:25,345
am going to take revenge.

527
00:34:27,214 --> 00:34:28,748
I'm telling you, 
I have no choice but to do it!

528
00:34:28,748 --> 00:34:32,185
If I want to remove that evil Han Chang Ryul from my life,

529
00:34:32,185 --> 00:34:33,386
there is no other choice.

530
00:34:33,386 --> 00:34:34,888
You know what Socrates said, right?

531
00:34:34,888 --> 00:34:36,523
Know yourself.

532
00:34:36,523 --> 00:34:37,657
It seems like you know it well.

533
00:34:37,657 --> 00:34:39,359
Yes, go figure out yourself first.

534
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,295
Yes, I know, I know myself and 
I know I can't go through revenge.

535
00:34:42,295 --> 00:34:45,498
If you help, Jin Ho, I know it'll be the perfect revenge, 
and I can just end this once and for all.

536
00:34:46,032 --> 00:34:47,062
You...

537
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:50,136
you don't have revenge in any part of your DNA.

538
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,838
I can do it.

539
00:34:52,171 --> 00:34:53,906
I really want to end it.

540
00:34:54,407 --> 00:34:58,477
The bad person who thought I was an easy catch,

541
00:34:58,477 --> 00:35:02,314
I want to get the perfect revenge on him.

542
00:35:04,884 --> 00:35:07,419
Out of anyone else in this world, 
I love my mother the most.

543
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,454
What?

544
00:35:08,454 --> 00:35:10,256
Why are you suddenly talking about this?

545
00:35:10,256 --> 00:35:14,526
But, out of anyone else in this world, my mother 
is also the person who makes me hurt the most.

546
00:35:15,995 --> 00:35:16,867
What?

547
00:35:17,663 --> 00:35:19,198
She's too naive.

548
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,514
So?

549
00:35:21,514 --> 00:35:23,669
My mother also wants to take revenge on someone.

550
00:35:24,303 --> 00:35:25,738
But she could never do it.

551
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:27,499
Why is it?

552
00:35:27,499 --> 00:35:28,240
Why?

553
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,042
When she sees the person she wants to take revenge on,

554
00:35:30,042 --> 00:35:32,077
she bursts into tears.

555
00:35:33,345 --> 00:35:35,781
Do you know why I became friends with you?

556
00:35:37,449 --> 00:35:39,885
You resemble my mother so much.

557
00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:44,222
Therefore, you can never do something like take revenge.

558
00:35:47,492 --> 00:35:50,995
If I don't do this, my head is going to burst!

559
00:35:54,266 --> 00:35:55,319
Taking my oath.

560
00:35:56,568 --> 00:35:57,902
I, Park Kae In,

561
00:35:57,902 --> 00:36:01,005
with my best friend and best teacher, Jeon Jin Ho,

562
00:36:01,005 --> 00:36:02,940
until it's   game over, 

563
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,277
I will get rid of Han Chang Ryul.

564
00:36:06,277 --> 00:36:09,080
Rather than taking an oath on one thing,

565
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:11,382
get your feelings straight.

566
00:36:11,382 --> 00:36:13,084
Through your teachings, Jin Ho,

567
00:36:13,084 --> 00:36:16,387
I am going to exact the perfect revenge upon Han Chang Ryul.

568
00:36:17,522 --> 00:36:18,889
Until then,

569
00:36:18,889 --> 00:36:20,291
I will take care

570
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:22,193
of this weak heart.

571
00:36:23,127 --> 00:36:24,962
But do you really have to do this?

572
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,832
Why are you saying that?

573
00:36:27,832 --> 00:36:29,867
I think it's better if it's not done.

574
00:36:29,867 --> 00:36:31,402
That's not it.

575
00:36:32,837 --> 00:36:34,204
 "An eye for an eye, 

576
00:36:34,204 --> 00:36:36,173
 a nose for a nose."
 Isn't there a saying like that?

577
00:36:36,173 --> 00:36:37,341
 "An eye for an eye, 

578
00:36:37,341 --> 00:36:39,209
 a tooth for a tooth."  That's what it is.

579
00:36:40,377 --> 00:36:41,347
I respect you.

580
00:36:41,347 --> 00:36:42,379
It's common sense.

581
00:36:50,721 --> 00:36:52,089
Go on and try it.

582
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,495
Oh, I don't think I can do it.

583
00:36:58,495 --> 00:37:00,463
I can't do it because I'm too shy.

584
00:37:00,463 --> 00:37:02,265
Why don't you think you can do it? 
Of course you can do it.

585
00:37:05,736 --> 00:37:08,238
I really don't think this is it, I don't think this is it.

586
00:37:09,339 --> 00:37:11,240
You don't want revenge, do you?

587
00:37:20,717 --> 00:37:23,318
Say it with self-confidence.

588
00:37:23,318 --> 00:37:24,821
I am beautiful.

589
00:37:27,957 --> 00:37:29,425
Say it with confidence.

590
00:37:29,425 --> 00:37:30,260
I am  shexy. 

591
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,527
What on earth is  shexy? 

592
00:37:32,361 --> 00:37:33,029
The words just won't come out of my mouth.

593
00:37:33,029 --> 00:37:34,597
That's right, they won't, will they?

594
00:37:34,597 --> 00:37:36,165
But if you keep doing it, 
they'll come out perfectly.

595
00:37:36,399 --> 00:37:37,833
Try it again.

596
00:37:41,604 --> 00:37:43,272
I am worthy of love.

597
00:37:45,675 --> 00:37:46,809
I...

598
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:47,977
am perfect!

599
00:37:57,409 --> 00:38:10,990


600
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:23,001
Wait!

601
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:24,135
What?

602
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,108
Now. Please get in, princess.

603
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:33,611
Why are you being like this? It's gross.

604
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:37,500
A woman who thinks she deserves the best, 
gets the best treatment.

605
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,400
Do you understand?

606
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:44,055
Here.  Please come in, princess.

607
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:46,991
Of course.  And so I should.

608
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,899
Since you've gone to the trouble to help me,

609
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,167
I'll treat you this time.

610
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,569
I've saved up a lot of points.

611
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:01,238
You're not collecting points

612
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:03,407
every time a guy does something bad, do you?

613
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,509
I'm not like that.

614
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:07,911
What do you want to watch?

615
00:39:07,911 --> 00:39:08,979
What about you?

616
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:10,013
You can choose.

617
00:39:10,013 --> 00:39:11,481
 You  can choose.

618
00:39:11,781 --> 00:39:14,251
Were you always like this 
when you went on dates?

619
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:15,252
Like what?

620
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:16,753
With no preferences of your own,

621
00:39:16,753 --> 00:39:18,189
just doing whatever the guy told you to do.

622
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,723
That's thinking about the other person.

623
00:39:19,723 --> 00:39:21,825
Rather than a quiet woman,

624
00:39:21,825 --> 00:39:24,994
a man is much more nervous when
 he's with a woman with a strong personality

625
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,300
I want to see an action blockbuster.

626
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,968
Nonsense!

627
00:39:32,068 --> 00:39:34,303
I am going to see a romantic comedy.

628
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:36,874
That's it.

629
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,641
Very good.

630
00:39:41,144 --> 00:39:42,579
Jin Ho!

631
00:39:54,724 --> 00:39:56,592
So it is you.

632
00:39:57,227 --> 00:39:58,327
Oh.

633
00:39:58,327 --> 00:39:59,929
Eun Soo.

634
00:40:00,964 --> 00:40:03,065
Long time no see.

635
00:40:03,065 --> 00:40:04,667
Have you been doing well?

636
00:40:09,572 --> 00:40:11,273
Who's this?

637
00:40:12,308 --> 00:40:15,010
Oh, this is Park Kae In.

638
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,546
How are you? I'm Park Kae In.

639
00:40:18,214 --> 00:40:19,949
I'm Yoon Eun Soo.

640
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,785
By chance, Jin Ho, is she your...

641
00:40:22,785 --> 00:40:24,686
girlfriend?

642
00:40:24,987 --> 00:40:26,922
No.  It's not like that.

643
00:40:27,757 --> 00:40:29,591
So am I your boyfriend then?

644
00:40:38,367 --> 00:40:41,135
I heard that you opened an architectural firm.

645
00:40:41,135 --> 00:40:42,938
Wouldn't you say you're doing too well?

646
00:40:43,272 --> 00:40:45,139
You, too.

647
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:48,009
I heard you are a real highflyer at Johns Hopkins.

648
00:40:48,009 --> 00:40:50,345
You hear rumors about me?

649
00:40:50,478 --> 00:40:52,246
That's good to hear.

650
00:40:52,814 --> 00:40:54,682
So have you moved back for good?

651
00:40:54,682 --> 00:40:56,951
No, I just came to see my mom for a bit.

652
00:40:56,951 --> 00:40:59,053
I have to go back tomorrow night.

653
00:41:00,722 --> 00:41:03,558
You two aren't in the same field, but it seems

654
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:07,828
you must have been very close in university.

655
00:41:07,828 --> 00:41:09,030
Were we...

656
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,664
like that?

657
00:41:12,033 --> 00:41:13,567
Well, I suppose...

658
00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:16,704
We did both live in the library, after all.

659
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:20,441
It seems as though you're living like a real person now,

660
00:41:20,441 --> 00:41:21,509
even coming out to see a movie.

661
00:41:21,509 --> 00:41:24,277
It's my first time seeing one in three years.

662
00:41:24,277 --> 00:41:25,646
I might have caught ten minutes of it.

663
00:41:25,646 --> 00:41:27,348
I fell asleep during most of it.

664
00:41:29,751 --> 00:41:32,019
Even so, I envy you.

665
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:33,621
You can come out to the movies like this

666
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:35,656
with your girlfriend.

667
00:41:35,656 --> 00:41:37,491
I'm still an outcast.

668
00:41:37,491 --> 00:41:39,860
I'm not his girlfriend.

669
00:41:41,562 --> 00:41:45,766
But it seems like a lot of guys 
would want to date you, Eun Soo.

670
00:41:45,766 --> 00:41:48,268
No, there's really nobody.

671
00:41:48,269 --> 00:41:50,637
She's busy dating her patients,

672
00:41:50,637 --> 00:41:52,272
she probably doesn't have 
enough time to look elsewhere.

673
00:41:52,272 --> 00:41:55,042
I guess old friends are really good, huh?

674
00:41:55,042 --> 00:41:56,677
Giving others an excellent impression of me.

675
00:41:56,677 --> 00:41:58,812
What's having friends good for?

676
00:42:00,347 --> 00:42:01,981
But...

677
00:42:01,981 --> 00:42:04,617
what happens when you want to stop being friends?

678
00:42:13,893 --> 00:42:15,428
Ah, excuse me.

679
00:42:15,428 --> 00:42:16,696
Eun Soo,

680
00:42:16,696 --> 00:42:17,697
Jin Ho,

681
00:42:17,697 --> 00:42:20,733
when he used to be in university, 
was he always this picky?

682
00:42:20,733 --> 00:42:22,769
If he didn't look like that,

683
00:42:22,769 --> 00:42:25,138
- he probably would have been an outcast. 
- I thought so!

684
00:42:26,473 --> 00:42:28,507
But...

685
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:32,744
how did the two of you meet the first time?

686
00:42:32,744 --> 00:42:36,282
Oh, well, that's... a bit complicated...

687
00:42:36,282 --> 00:42:38,417
At our first meeting,

688
00:42:38,417 --> 00:42:39,786
this guy grabbed my bu--

689
00:42:39,786 --> 00:42:41,020
Hey, now! Drink this.

690
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,488
Hey, now! Drink this.

691
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:45,891
Drink more.

692
00:42:48,795 --> 00:42:50,329
- Don't. 
- Okay.

693
00:42:51,831 --> 00:42:53,065
When you first met...

694
00:42:53,532 --> 00:42:56,034
Your... butt?

695
00:43:04,243 --> 00:43:05,110
I hope the two of you

696
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:07,612
enjoy your movie.

697
00:43:07,612 --> 00:43:08,247
I'm going first.

698
00:43:08,247 --> 00:43:11,383
No. Jin Ho, why don't we go to dinner together?

699
00:43:11,383 --> 00:43:14,086
It's been a while since you've met,
and you guys probably have a lot to talk about.

700
00:43:14,086 --> 00:43:15,687
No.

701
00:43:15,687 --> 00:43:17,756
I don't want to interfere.

702
00:43:17,756 --> 00:43:19,691
Jin Ho, I'll be leaving first.

703
00:43:22,628 --> 00:43:23,629
Wait.

704
00:43:23,629 --> 00:43:27,765
If there's an occasion where we meet again, 
I'll see you, Eun Soo.

705
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:29,201
Kae In,

706
00:43:29,201 --> 00:43:29,802
wait a moment.

707
00:43:29,802 --> 00:43:31,369
Why?

708
00:43:31,737 --> 00:43:33,405
I'll walk you.

709
00:43:33,405 --> 00:43:35,139
There's no need for that.

710
00:43:35,808 --> 00:43:37,208
Let's go.

711
00:43:58,163 --> 00:44:00,764
I know I shouldn't be asking things like this

712
00:44:00,764 --> 00:44:03,233
to someone who has a girlfriend.

713
00:44:03,768 --> 00:44:05,836
But, I still want to ask.

714
00:44:07,505 --> 00:44:09,106
Before I went to study abroad,

715
00:44:09,741 --> 00:44:11,375
when I said that, if you stopped me,

716
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:13,277
I wouldn't leave,

717
00:44:13,511 --> 00:44:14,912
do you remember that?

718
00:44:16,814 --> 00:44:17,815
Yeah.

719
00:44:18,549 --> 00:44:20,084
Then, at that point,

720
00:44:20,084 --> 00:44:21,652
not stopping me...

721
00:44:23,554 --> 00:44:25,155
Do you not regret it?

722
00:44:29,426 --> 00:44:30,627
I'm sorry.

723
00:44:31,027 --> 00:44:32,629
You're so cool.

724
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:35,965
That's probably why I liked you so much.

725
00:44:38,235 --> 00:44:39,469
I...

726
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:42,605
Before I find someone to go to the movies with as well,

727
00:44:43,073 --> 00:44:47,009
I hope that we don't meet like this again.

728
00:44:47,978 --> 00:44:51,447
Let's meet again in 10 years or so.

729
00:45:04,294 --> 00:45:05,961
Kae In...

730
00:45:06,963 --> 00:45:09,165
she seems like a good person.

731
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:21,610
Jin Ho,

732
00:45:21,944 --> 00:45:23,246
the two of you

733
00:45:23,379 --> 00:45:26,382
seem like former lovers.

734
00:45:28,651 --> 00:45:31,386
Out of all people - doesn't matter if woman or man -

735
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,700
she was the one who attracted me the most. 
  (also on a romantic and/or sexual level) 

736
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,600
Eun Soo.

737
00:45:35,624 --> 00:45:37,659
Even from a woman's point of view,

738
00:45:37,659 --> 00:45:40,762
Eun Soo seems like an incredible person.

739
00:45:41,597 --> 00:45:44,566
When I looked ahead and saw that friend running,

740
00:45:44,967 --> 00:45:46,835
she seemed so much like me

741
00:45:47,136 --> 00:45:49,404
that I felt like she was an ally.

742
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:55,411
Let's go inside.

743
00:45:55,411 --> 00:45:57,212
The movie should be starting.

744
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,680
Me too,

745
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,849
I hope I can become someone like Eun Soo.

746
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,452
Someone you perceive as an ally.

747
00:46:04,786 --> 00:46:07,855
Someone you perceive as an ally.

748
00:46:07,855 --> 00:46:09,457
That kind of person.

749
00:46:33,515 --> 00:46:35,049
I like you.

750
00:46:37,485 --> 00:46:39,153
Jin Ho...

751
00:46:40,121 --> 00:46:42,389
After everything, I still smile because of you.

752
00:46:44,892 --> 00:46:46,427
No...

753
00:46:46,427 --> 00:46:47,695
But...

754
00:46:47,695 --> 00:46:49,563
You're...

755
00:46:49,931 --> 00:46:52,166
When you come up to a place this high,

756
00:46:52,166 --> 00:46:54,268
People get more courage.

757
00:46:54,468 --> 00:46:57,404
And so we get the strength to confess.

758
00:46:57,571 --> 00:46:58,772
What?

759
00:46:59,307 --> 00:47:01,675
Later, when I decide to propose to someone...

760
00:47:01,675 --> 00:47:03,376
this is where I would come with the person.

761
00:47:08,715 --> 00:47:10,684
What are you thinking about?

762
00:47:11,919 --> 00:47:12,686
Did I say anything?

763
00:47:16,014 --> 00:47:19,043
I didn't think anything.

764
00:47:32,156 --> 00:47:33,716
 Eun Soo. 

765
00:47:33,716 --> 00:47:35,392
 Yes? 

766
00:47:35,392 --> 00:47:38,295
 I want to tell you something. 

767
00:47:43,734 --> 00:47:51,487
 Should we... stop being friends? 

768
00:47:52,843 --> 00:47:56,316
 I want to stop. 

769
00:47:56,316 --> 00:47:57,347
 Jin Ho... 

770
00:48:09,926 --> 00:48:13,797
Let's end today's lesson here for now.

771
00:48:13,797 --> 00:48:16,482
Jin Ho.

772
00:48:16,482 --> 00:48:18,341
Don't turn around.

773
00:48:26,598 --> 00:48:29,208
What are you doing?

774
00:48:32,495 --> 00:48:33,697
Park Kae In,

775
00:48:33,697 --> 00:48:36,388
what are you writing right now?

776
00:48:36,388 --> 00:48:38,974
 Park Kae In's weather forecast. 

777
00:48:38,974 --> 00:48:41,661
 Where the lilacs tickle our noses... 

778
00:48:41,661 --> 00:48:42,825
Please say something.

779
00:48:42,825 --> 00:48:48,273
 Park Kae In is writing on her friend's back. 

780
00:48:48,273 --> 00:48:51,904
 Next time... next time... 

781
00:48:51,904 --> 00:48:53,916
 when you're born again, 

782
00:48:53,916 --> 00:49:00,080
 please be born as a man who can love a woman. 

783
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,211
 Tomorrow, when we begin our revenge, 

784
00:49:02,211 --> 00:49:04,182
 the weather is something I won't care about. 

785
00:49:04,182 --> 00:49:06,353
 This was Park Kae In's daily forecast. 

786
00:49:18,026 --> 00:49:21,730
Men are attracted to women

787
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:23,434
who have a sense of humor.

788
00:49:23,434 --> 00:49:25,968
I'm totally confident in that!

789
00:49:25,968 --> 00:49:28,269
You know that's my one specialty.

790
00:49:28,269 --> 00:49:30,247
What humor?

791
00:49:30,247 --> 00:49:32,173
You trip, you fall, and you break things.

792
00:49:32,173 --> 00:49:34,147
How is that humor?

793
00:49:36,444 --> 00:49:38,954
You know what's the funniest but shortest story on earth?

794
00:49:41,254 --> 00:49:45,185
It rained on weather forecaster's sports competition.

795
00:49:48,623 --> 00:49:52,460
Then, Jin Ho, you tell me one.

796
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:55,172
Ah, that...

797
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,000
I don't remember any right now.

798
00:49:57,398 --> 00:49:59,867
Isn't it that the mentor should show me 
so that I can learn or not?

799
00:49:59,867 --> 00:50:02,302
Isn't it that the mentor should show me 
so that I can learn or not?

800
00:50:04,872 --> 00:50:08,275
Then, when you think of one, call me. I'll listen to it.

801
00:50:11,245 --> 00:50:12,913
You just wait till I remember one.

802
00:50:14,214 --> 00:50:15,916
A funny story?

803
00:50:15,916 --> 00:50:17,618
Are you dating without me knowing?

804
00:50:17,618 --> 00:50:18,186
What?

805
00:50:18,186 --> 00:50:19,623
When you ask for funny stories,

806
00:50:19,623 --> 00:50:21,922
it usually means that you're using it for dating.

807
00:50:21,922 --> 00:50:24,157
By chance... behind Hye Mi's back?  Hyung!

808
00:50:24,157 --> 00:50:25,692
No.

809
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:27,027
As three guys...

810
00:50:27,027 --> 00:50:30,764
that are eating together, it's rather boring.

811
00:50:30,764 --> 00:50:31,832
In any case,

812
00:50:31,832 --> 00:50:34,234
why would a guy like you 
need to know those things?

813
00:50:34,234 --> 00:50:35,569
Those kinds of things only apply to guys like me,

814
00:50:35,569 --> 00:50:36,937
who have no looks to show off

815
00:50:36,937 --> 00:50:38,605
and need to impress people in other ways.

816
00:50:38,605 --> 00:50:40,674
Why are you nodding your head, you punk?

817
00:50:40,674 --> 00:50:41,775
Do you know that one?

818
00:50:41,775 --> 00:50:44,834
The one about apples, peaches, and pears in a truck?

819
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:59,225
Yes, Jin Ho.

820
00:50:59,225 --> 00:51:00,026
An apple,

821
00:51:00,026 --> 00:51:01,060
a peach,

822
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,529
and a pear were in a truck.

823
00:51:03,529 --> 00:51:04,664
What?

824
00:51:04,664 --> 00:51:08,601
But suddenly a dog ran out of 
nowhere and the truck had to stop.

825
00:51:08,601 --> 00:51:10,269
Oh! Humor!

826
00:51:10,269 --> 00:51:12,838
What do you think fell out of the truck?

827
00:51:12,838 --> 00:51:14,607
I said to be funny,

828
00:51:14,607 --> 00:51:15,941
not give riddles.

829
00:51:15,941 --> 00:51:17,457
Whatever the method is,

830
00:51:17,457 --> 00:51:18,911
doesn't it count as long as it's funny?

831
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,678
Peach?

832
00:51:19,678 --> 00:51:21,981
Nope.

833
00:51:21,981 --> 00:51:24,016
What fell...

834
00:51:24,016 --> 00:51:25,951
was the speed.

835
00:51:25,951 --> 00:51:27,753
I'm hanging up.

836
00:51:30,488 --> 00:51:31,657
Hello?

837
00:51:31,657 --> 00:51:33,725
Park Kae In.

838
00:51:37,663 --> 00:51:39,331
But on the inside...

839
00:51:44,603 --> 00:51:46,571
Look through them.

840
00:51:50,709 --> 00:51:51,610
What is it?

841
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:53,278
How is this?

842
00:51:53,278 --> 00:51:54,780
I'd like Pyeong Baek wood.

843
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,314
This is Pyeong Baek wood!

844
00:51:56,314 --> 00:51:56,982
Kids are going to be using this,

845
00:51:56,982 --> 00:52:00,051
so I already told you that I need the best wood.

846
00:52:00,051 --> 00:52:00,852
Where are you?

847
00:52:00,852 --> 00:52:03,388
 I'm here to buy wood. 

848
00:52:03,388 --> 00:52:04,422
 Hey, we only sell goods of first-class quality! 

849
00:52:04,422 --> 00:52:06,691
 Hey, we only sell goods of first-class quality! 

850
00:52:06,691 --> 00:52:08,026
Even though you know that, you're being like this?

851
00:52:08,026 --> 00:52:10,562
This time it's really funny, right?

852
00:52:10,562 --> 00:52:14,666
In the alphabet, do you know which letter is the prettiest?

853
00:52:14,666 --> 00:52:19,470
A, B, C, D, E, F, G. 
    

854
00:52:21,005 --> 00:52:22,040
Teacher,

855
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,775
you'd better work harder.

856
00:52:23,775 --> 00:52:25,410
I understand.

857
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:27,044
I shall call you again later.

858
00:52:29,614 --> 00:52:32,883
Geez!  How did she know that?

859
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:41,392
I feel sensational today!

860
00:52:41,392 --> 00:52:43,861
This is very fine wood.

861
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:45,462
The wood is even more beautiful than the skin of my wife,

862
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:48,231
when she was young.

863
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,535
If this next one is bad, 
I won't be answering next time.

864
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:54,571
 What would be bad? 

865
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:55,572
Chang Ryul?

866
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:56,840
Hello?

867
00:52:57,902 --> 00:53:00,077
Where are you?

868
00:53:00,077 --> 00:53:02,112
The wood hardware store?

869
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:04,581
The place where you and I went once?

870
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:05,983
That place is far!

871
00:53:05,983 --> 00:53:08,752
You should've asked me to give you a ride.

872
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:10,320
 Day one of my revenge.   

873
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,190
 He's calling me. 

874
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,459
  I'll go there now. 

875
00:53:15,459 --> 00:53:17,194
You don't need to.

876
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,296
I already told you that I don't need to see you again.

877
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:21,798
Kae In, we already agreed that 
we need to see each other again.

878
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:23,433
Anyway, let's meet up and talk,

879
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:25,068
because I'm leaving right now!

880
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:26,602
I'm hanging up!

881
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,100
Han Chang Ryul,

882
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,400
right now, you're digging your own grave.

883
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,353
This time I'm starting to feel disappointed, teacher.

884
00:53:44,353 --> 00:53:46,255
 I remembered another one. 

885
00:53:46,255 --> 00:53:49,625
A grandmother collapsed with palsy,

886
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:51,861
and the mother sent her daughter a text.

887
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:54,096
But she made a typo, and there was a misunderstanding.

888
00:53:54,096 --> 00:53:56,699
Do you know what she said in the text?

889
00:53:56,699 --> 00:53:57,633
I don't know.

890
00:53:57,633 --> 00:54:02,537
"Grandmother has collapsed from the wind."
   

891
00:54:04,306 --> 00:54:05,707
You laughed, right?

892
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:10,212
Your teacher has been a good role-model to you.

893
00:54:10,212 --> 00:54:13,515
It's now your turn to work hard.

894
00:54:13,515 --> 00:54:17,586
Ah, yes.

895
00:54:20,556 --> 00:54:22,691
Ahhhhhh!

896
00:54:24,259 --> 00:54:25,327
 Hello? 

897
00:54:25,327 --> 00:54:28,230
Park Kae In.

898
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:30,031
What's the matter?

899
00:54:30,031 --> 00:54:30,798
 Hello, Park Kae In? 

900
00:54:41,576 --> 00:54:43,244
Hey, hey! Where are you going?

901
00:54:44,746 --> 00:54:48,116
Oh my! There's a woman in there!

902
00:54:48,116 --> 00:54:50,185
- It's a woman! 
- Are you alright?

903
00:54:50,185 --> 00:54:52,620
- Slowly! 
- Lift them up carefully!

904
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:56,658
Oh my! She's really hurt!

905
00:54:56,658 --> 00:54:59,059
Hurry up and take this!

906
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,802
It's Ji Young lumber dealer in Yanpyeong.

907
00:55:27,421 --> 00:55:29,523
Is this Ji Young lumber dealer?

908
00:55:33,627 --> 00:55:35,863
 Miss Kae In got into an accident! 

909
00:55:35,863 --> 00:55:36,296
 That's right. 

910
00:55:36,296 --> 00:55:38,065
 This seems very serious! 

911
00:55:38,065 --> 00:55:39,966
 Come here quickly! 

912
00:56:21,641 --> 00:56:22,975
Kae In, have some water.

913
00:56:22,975 --> 00:56:26,111
Here.

914
00:56:56,958 --> 00:56:58,056
Are you alright?

915
00:57:03,466 --> 00:57:04,847
Jin Ho...

916
00:57:07,538 --> 00:57:08,805
What are you doing here?

917
00:57:11,174 --> 00:57:13,102
How badly are you hurt?

918
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:15,945
I didn't get hurt a lot.

919
00:57:19,088 --> 00:57:20,860
What are you doing right now?

920
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:23,969
You can't even love a woman. 
Why do you keep getting between us?

921
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,089
Is it all about being able to love a woman?

922
00:57:32,728 --> 00:57:34,063
Are you able to get up?

923
00:57:34,063 --> 00:57:35,431
What?

924
00:57:36,272 --> 00:57:37,266
Let's go.

925
00:57:40,661 --> 00:57:42,934
What do you think you're doing right now, you punk?!

926
00:57:42,934 --> 00:57:45,207
I'm starting to love this woman,

927
00:57:45,774 --> 00:57:47,042
so don't interfere.

928
00:58:28,726 --> 00:58:31,704
I even trained her for revenge.

929
00:58:32,827 --> 00:58:34,812
Why are you interfering,

930
00:58:35,323 --> 00:58:37,425
Jeon Jin Ho?

931
00:58:39,958 --> 00:58:41,526
Isn't this going to scar?

932
00:58:41,526 --> 00:58:42,830
Should I ask them to do it again?

933
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:44,686
I said I'm fine.

934
00:58:47,401 --> 00:58:49,370
This injury isn't anything

935
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:51,405
compared to the hurt you gave me.

936
00:58:52,628 --> 00:58:53,874
So,

937
00:58:54,608 --> 00:58:56,177
don't pretend that you're worried.

938
00:58:56,944 --> 00:58:58,679
Pretend?  Kae In,

939
00:58:58,679 --> 00:59:00,648
I am really worried as well.

940
00:59:00,648 --> 00:59:01,715
I don't believe you.

941
00:59:02,816 --> 00:59:04,151
Didn't we agree to start over?

942
00:59:04,151 --> 00:59:05,819
How do you expect us to start over like this?

943
00:59:06,153 --> 00:59:07,988
I didn't say I forgive you.

944
00:59:08,288 --> 00:59:09,923
I didn't say that I would trust you, either.

945
00:59:09,923 --> 00:59:12,526
What do you mean then? 
That you'll just keep me by your side?

946
00:59:12,526 --> 00:59:14,294
To make me feel bad?

947
00:59:17,297 --> 00:59:18,498
You said to get mad,

948
00:59:18,598 --> 00:59:19,633
hit,

949
00:59:19,733 --> 00:59:21,168
and look down on you.

950
00:59:21,635 --> 00:59:23,370
You said to do whatever,

951
00:59:23,370 --> 00:59:23,970
and now,

952
00:59:24,838 --> 00:59:26,206
you can't even tolerate this?

953
00:59:31,878 --> 00:59:33,222
Excuse me.

954
00:59:33,222 --> 00:59:36,216
I would like to know about 
emergency patient Park Kae In's condition.

955
00:59:36,216 --> 00:59:37,617
Are you her guardian?

956
00:59:40,186 --> 00:59:41,488
Yes.

957
00:59:45,516 --> 00:59:47,894
 The CT scan results were normal. 

958
00:59:48,427 --> 00:59:50,763
 It's a minor concussion. 

959
00:59:54,066 --> 00:59:56,068
Everything I can do for you...

960
00:59:57,269 --> 00:59:59,472
I've done.

961
01:00:03,075 --> 01:00:05,344
Where do you think you're going in your condition?

962
01:00:05,645 --> 01:00:07,013
Kae In, I'll drop you off, okay?

963
01:00:07,013 --> 01:00:07,980
It's fine.

964
01:00:11,217 --> 01:00:13,686
I knew from the very beginning

965
01:00:13,686 --> 01:00:15,588
that it wouldn't be easy to get your forgiveness.

966
01:00:17,356 --> 01:00:21,126
I can understand and be patient 
when you ignore or belittle me.

967
01:00:21,126 --> 01:00:22,394
However,

968
01:00:22,394 --> 01:00:25,197
don't make me not worry about you.

969
01:00:25,731 --> 01:00:27,166
I'm begging you, Kae In.

970
01:00:34,372 --> 01:00:36,141
Where is your car?

971
01:00:37,542 --> 01:00:38,876
It's outside.

972
01:00:38,876 --> 01:00:39,878
Stay right here.

973
01:00:39,878 --> 01:00:41,513
I'll bring it here right away.
