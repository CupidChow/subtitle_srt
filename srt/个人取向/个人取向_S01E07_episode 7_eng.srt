1
00:00:02,867 --> 00:00:05,421
It's just like the time when my father died...

2
00:00:09,754 --> 00:00:11,766
I was a kid who couldn't do anything.

3
00:00:15,221 --> 00:00:17,054
Jin Ho...

4
00:00:18,987 --> 00:00:21,054
No matter how hard I run...

5
00:00:23,687 --> 00:00:25,854
I always stay in the same place.

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,420
Jin Ho...

7
00:00:35,387 --> 00:00:36,687
Are you crying?

8
00:00:47,887 --> 00:00:51,487
Jin Ho, don't cry.

9
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,320
What's going on?

10
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,686
How could that happen?

11
00:01:46,986 --> 00:01:48,353
And did it really happen?

12
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,520
Has he now started to take an interest in women?

13
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,753
But to me?  To me?

14
00:01:58,453 --> 00:01:59,720
Me?

15
00:02:04,453 --> 00:02:06,020
Are you... going to work?

16
00:02:09,853 --> 00:02:11,186
Last night,

17
00:02:12,153 --> 00:02:14,553
I believe I was very drunk...

18
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:17,886
I might have done some strange things...

19
00:02:18,353 --> 00:02:19,686
You don't remember...

20
00:02:19,686 --> 00:02:21,586
anything at all?

21
00:02:24,153 --> 00:02:24,919
In that case,

22
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:28,186
it must have fallen through those gaps in your memory,

23
00:02:28,186 --> 00:02:31,886
that 50,000 won I lent you.

24
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:41,119
No, it's fine. I was only joking.

25
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,419
Whoever heard of a man who gets so drunk 
he doesn't remember a single thing?

26
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:47,386
You're no fun at all...

27
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:50,052
If I did something wrong...

28
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:54,986
please forgive me.

29
00:02:54,986 --> 00:02:56,986
I drank far too much last night.

30
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:07,319
Hey, we're friends, remember? 
Why should we worry over something like that?

31
00:03:08,086 --> 00:03:11,086
It's all right. Go to work.

32
00:03:20,385 --> 00:03:21,952
Right.

33
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,385
You mistook me for your lover.

34
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:29,085
But even if you were that drunk...

35
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:32,019
You would do that to just anybody?

36
00:03:49,352 --> 00:03:51,052
 Are you completely clueless, Park Kae In? 

37
00:03:51,718 --> 00:03:52,952
 Are you stupid? 

38
00:03:52,952 --> 00:03:57,352
 Why does everybody think I'm such a pushover?! 

39
00:03:57,885 --> 00:04:00,318
 What did I do that was so wrong ? 

40
00:04:01,018 --> 00:04:05,485
 Why? Why does everyone make me feel so pathetic? 

41
00:04:07,385 --> 00:04:09,085
 Thanks a lot. 

42
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,018
 Jin Ho, to me... 

43
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:18,818
 you're like a friend, 

44
00:04:18,818 --> 00:04:21,185
 like a dad. 

45
00:04:23,018 --> 00:04:24,751
 You've come into our house... 

46
00:04:26,285 --> 00:04:28,018
 and you're welcome. 

47
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:36,285
 This isn't right! 

48
00:04:36,285 --> 00:04:38,518
 No matter how successful you think this will make you... 

49
00:04:38,518 --> 00:04:42,451
 If you use Professor Park's daughter like this, 
you are really bad. 

50
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:45,018
 This just means you'll use any means to succeed! 

51
00:04:49,851 --> 00:04:51,418
There's not much luggage.

52
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:52,851
Yes.

53
00:04:53,485 --> 00:04:54,951
No, not a van...

54
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:57,784
I think just a normal car will do.

55
00:04:57,784 --> 00:04:59,751
Then, please come on Saturday.

56
00:05:00,651 --> 00:05:02,151
Are you going to move out of Sang Go Jae?

57
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:04,251
Yeah. There's not much reason to stay anymore.

58
00:05:04,251 --> 00:05:05,818
Right. You made the right decision.

59
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:08,384
You'd  just get hurt even more by staying there.

60
00:05:11,184 --> 00:05:12,718
Right, let's just brush this off,

61
00:05:12,718 --> 00:05:13,751
Right, let's just brush this off,

62
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:15,051
and start on different work.

63
00:05:15,718 --> 00:05:18,251
I'll call around here and there to see what I can find.

64
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,051
There are lots of places
that are willing to work with us, you know?

65
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:25,584
But...

66
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:28,251
there's something I wanted to discuss with you.

67
00:05:29,184 --> 00:05:34,817
My mother is quite close with someone who runs 
a catering facility at the Presidential Mansion.

68
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:37,917
So if she puts in a few words for us...

69
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:41,217
maybe we could get to try our hands 
on a project to remodel the Mansion.

70
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:51,184
Don't you think that's funny?

71
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,184
Do I have to laugh?

72
00:05:53,017 --> 00:05:54,251
You...

73
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:56,317
You really have no sense of humor.

74
00:06:05,084 --> 00:06:06,217
Take this.

75
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:12,017
What is this?

76
00:06:12,017 --> 00:06:13,450
This is a workplace, if you don't mind.

77
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,884
Don't you realize you have to 
address me formally here?

78
00:06:19,117 --> 00:06:21,150
It's a cash advance for your work 
on the recreational space.

79
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,784
Director Choi suggested you might 
need it to meet any initial expenses.

80
00:06:31,784 --> 00:06:32,917
Hello, Jin Ho...

81
00:06:35,283 --> 00:06:36,617
Are you okay?

82
00:06:37,217 --> 00:06:40,283
I'm calling because the way you left 
yesterday had me a bit worried.

83
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,250
I thought I might maybe buy you a drink.

84
00:06:44,983 --> 00:06:46,050
I'm sorry,

85
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,217
today is not...

86
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,250
Oh come on, please. Spare a bit of time for me.

87
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,350
I have a prior engagement.

88
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,383
In that case, I guess it's not on.

89
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:57,650
Anyway, keep your spirits up, Jin Ho.

90
00:07:01,817 --> 00:07:02,817
So...

91
00:07:03,617 --> 00:07:04,517
what is that about?

92
00:07:05,417 --> 00:07:07,717
"The way he left yesterday..."

93
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,883
You didn't know?

94
00:07:09,883 --> 00:07:11,116
Even though you're roommates?

95
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:16,850
The entry conditions for the Dam Arts Center project 
were changed yesterday, and he's excluded.

96
00:07:16,883 --> 00:07:21,383
That means that all the work that Jin Ho 
has done up to this point has gone to waste.

97
00:07:23,383 --> 00:07:25,116
 No matter how hard I run, 

98
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,683
 I still stay in the same place. 

99
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,716
 Jin Ho. 

100
00:07:32,716 --> 00:07:33,750
 Are you crying? 

101
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:39,950
You're always like that, aren't you?

102
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:42,483
No matter what a show of kindness you put on,

103
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:44,583
you only ever see what it suits you to see.

104
00:07:46,783 --> 00:07:47,749
In any case,

105
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:50,949
there wouldn't be any reason for Jin Ho 
to tell you something like that.

106
00:08:11,383 --> 00:08:14,983
 

107
00:09:03,249 --> 00:09:04,282
Hey, you,

108
00:09:05,315 --> 00:09:07,382
from now on, this is your home.

109
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:09,015
There's a guy who lives here

110
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,249
who looks exactly like you.

111
00:09:11,249 --> 00:09:12,482
With long legs just like yours.

112
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:16,415
Such a charmer, you've even got roses!

113
00:09:16,415 --> 00:09:20,615
From now on, your name is Jin Ho.

114
00:09:20,615 --> 00:09:21,682
Be sure to remember that.

115
00:09:33,882 --> 00:09:35,748
Oooh... salty!

116
00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:07,014
Saturday will be your last day,

117
00:10:07,014 --> 00:10:08,514
Jeon Jin Ho.

118
00:10:13,609 --> 00:10:15,087
There's no reason to stay any longer.

119
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:23,854
Tada!

120
00:10:25,107 --> 00:10:26,154
Though there's not a lot of food,

121
00:10:26,154 --> 00:10:27,105
please eat a lot.

122
00:10:28,842 --> 00:10:31,414
What kind of food is this exactly?

123
00:10:31,414 --> 00:10:32,382
Fish stew.

124
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,154
Where's all the fish?

125
00:10:37,154 --> 00:10:38,267
Well,

126
00:10:38,267 --> 00:10:42,020
when the fish first went into the soup,
 they still looked like fish...

127
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,733
but they slowly started falling apart and disappearing...

128
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:47,733
How long did you cook it 
for the fish to have all disappeared?

129
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:50,587
What matters is that I put my heart into making it.

130
00:10:50,587 --> 00:10:52,168
From now on,

131
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:53,327
just show me you care.

132
00:10:53,327 --> 00:10:55,153
For me, it's like this.

133
00:10:55,153 --> 00:10:57,187
When I have a really bad day,

134
00:10:57,187 --> 00:10:59,431
if I sit in front of a well-laid out table, I think,

135
00:10:59,531 --> 00:11:00,533
"Eat this and become strong.

136
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:01,153
Right.

137
00:11:01,153 --> 00:11:02,953
I can do anything. Fighting!"

138
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,429
And while I think things like this,

139
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:05,953
I feel strength bubbling within me!

140
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:09,787
Then, eat and become strong

141
00:11:09,787 --> 00:11:11,120
and live happily.

142
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,553
Jin Ho too.

143
00:11:12,553 --> 00:11:13,787
Eat and become strong.

144
00:11:15,387 --> 00:11:16,733
Well, hurry and eat.

145
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,653
Please don't trip and fall while you run,

146
00:11:20,653 --> 00:11:23,092
stock up on medication in advance,

147
00:11:23,092 --> 00:11:24,953
and don't cut yourself while you use a knife.

148
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,571
You can handle the knives,

149
00:11:29,571 --> 00:11:32,620
and if I fall, you can help me back on my feet,

150
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,553
and when I run out of medicine, you can get more...
What do I have to worry about?

151
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,220
Just how long do you think I'll be staying here for?

152
00:11:44,156 --> 00:11:46,053
What's wrong, Jin Ho?

153
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:47,520
Suddenly,

154
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,986
you are talking about leaving the house...

155
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,220
It's not like I'll be living here forever.

156
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,586
That's true.

157
00:11:53,586 --> 00:11:55,653
It's true but...

158
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:58,153
Still,

159
00:11:58,153 --> 00:12:01,380
you suddenly talking about leaving 
gives me a strange feeling.

160
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:05,719
I'm not going to leave right now.

161
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:07,886
So eat.

162
00:12:09,653 --> 00:12:12,468
But now that I'm thinking about 
the possibility of you leaving...

163
00:12:12,468 --> 00:12:14,986
I suddenly seem to have lost my appetite.

164
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:18,798
You need to fix that as well.

165
00:12:18,798 --> 00:12:21,186
Don't attach yourself so easily to people like this,

166
00:12:21,186 --> 00:12:23,153
and that includes your lover.

167
00:12:23,153 --> 00:12:25,186
I guess I was just born this way.

168
00:12:28,186 --> 00:12:30,132
I think I'm just the type that needs more affection.

169
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:43,986
 Brought to you by the Personal Taste viikii team! 

170
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,500
Are you working?

171
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:54,419
Can't you tell?

172
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:56,886
I'm going out to throw the trash.

173
00:12:56,886 --> 00:12:58,060
So?

174
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,723
It's a little heavy... Can't we take it out together?

175
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:05,152
You're saying that  that's  heavy?

176
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:09,389
I mean, if we go out and take a walk 
while we're at it, you'll feel better!

177
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:12,952
Working makes me happy.

178
00:13:13,852 --> 00:13:15,785
It's not like you have to do it right now...

179
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:18,385
What did you say?

180
00:13:19,252 --> 00:13:21,452
Nothing.

181
00:13:24,718 --> 00:13:27,152
Do you have time tomorrow?

182
00:13:27,152 --> 00:13:28,297
Tomorrow, why?

183
00:13:33,252 --> 00:13:34,985
Let's have a final test tomorrow.

184
00:13:34,985 --> 00:13:36,352
Final test?

185
00:13:36,352 --> 00:13:38,485
To see how high your excellence rating is.

186
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,013
Let's try and find out tomorrow.

187
00:13:40,013 --> 00:13:41,685
How?

188
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:44,085
I'll play the part of your boyfriend,

189
00:13:44,085 --> 00:13:46,685
so think of it as a date with a guy,

190
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:48,052
and put what you've learned so far into practice.

191
00:13:48,052 --> 00:13:49,618
So are we going on a date?

192
00:13:49,618 --> 00:13:50,818
Not a date,

193
00:13:51,938 --> 00:13:53,552
but a final test.

194
00:13:54,642 --> 00:13:57,385
But can you take the day off from work tomorrow?

195
00:13:57,385 --> 00:13:58,585
Yes, I'm going to take a day off of work.

196
00:13:58,585 --> 00:14:00,952
Then I'll transform into an amazing woman

197
00:14:00,952 --> 00:14:02,984
and completely astound you!

198
00:14:02,984 --> 00:14:04,132
Look forward to it.

199
00:14:16,385 --> 00:14:17,718
Chang Ryul.

200
00:14:18,518 --> 00:14:19,551
Kae In...

201
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:26,051
Chang Ryul, why did you come here?

202
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:27,918
Never mind...

203
00:14:27,918 --> 00:14:29,285
I'm leaving.

204
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,418
I should get going...

205
00:14:33,818 --> 00:14:35,671
I said, why do you keep coming here?

206
00:14:40,485 --> 00:14:42,484
I just came.

207
00:14:43,784 --> 00:14:47,221
Though I know I shouldn't come back here to see you,

208
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:51,218
I'm just so frustrated and distressed...

209
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:54,984
I just ended up coming here without even realizing it.

210
00:14:56,284 --> 00:15:00,184
I wish as well there was somebody else 
I could talk to about things,

211
00:15:00,184 --> 00:15:02,451
but there's nobody

212
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:04,584
to listen to my troubles, Kae In.

213
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:09,684
You were always...

214
00:15:09,684 --> 00:15:12,584
such a good listener to whatever I had to say.

215
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:16,517
Chang Ryul,

216
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,417
if you hadn't cast me aside the way you did,

217
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:22,184
I think I could have been there for you like that,

218
00:15:22,184 --> 00:15:23,651
right to the very end.

219
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:26,051
Kae In!

220
00:15:27,851 --> 00:15:29,684
Kae In...

221
00:15:33,951 --> 00:15:35,084
The truth is...

222
00:15:35,884 --> 00:15:37,217
Mom...

223
00:15:38,984 --> 00:15:40,584
My mom...

224
00:15:40,584 --> 00:15:41,786
Mom?

225
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,884
Which mom?

226
00:15:44,884 --> 00:15:45,784
What's wrong?

227
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:52,617
Did she pass away?

228
00:15:54,284 --> 00:15:56,950
After she broke up with my father,

229
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,950
she married a guy

230
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,750
who works for an International Aid Agency.

231
00:16:04,217 --> 00:16:06,717
If my mom leaves for Africa,

232
00:16:08,084 --> 00:16:10,550
I might not be able to see her again.

233
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,417
Africa...

234
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,017
She's going very far away.

235
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:19,317
She couldn't even come to my wedding 
because of my father...

236
00:16:20,284 --> 00:16:23,283
and before she leaves she'd like to share a meal...

237
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:26,983
with her son and her new daughter-in-law.

238
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,217
So since this may be the last time 
in my life I'll ever see her...

239
00:16:31,217 --> 00:16:33,550
But isn't this something...

240
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,283
you should be talking to In Hee about?

241
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:41,483
We're finished.

242
00:16:43,717 --> 00:16:45,350
In Hee,

243
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,317
she said the man she loved 
was the one in your imagination.

244
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:50,617
You spoke of me like

245
00:16:51,217 --> 00:16:54,683
I was the coolest guy in the world,

246
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,983
and she said she mistook me for that guy.

247
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,750
I was

248
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,583
only coolest

249
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,816
in front of Park Kae In.

250
00:17:18,616 --> 00:17:19,950
Park Kae In,

251
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,183
I'm coming in.

252
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:30,249
Did she go for a walk by herself?

253
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:31,783
Right.

254
00:17:33,616 --> 00:17:35,316
It doesn't make any sense,

255
00:17:35,316 --> 00:17:36,616
I know that too.

256
00:17:38,498 --> 00:17:40,183
I'm a crazy man, aren't I?

257
00:17:40,183 --> 00:17:43,149
How could I possibly ask you 
to act the part of In Hee?

258
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:45,083
Is that something anyone in their 
right mind would even consider?

259
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:48,516
I'm sorry, Kae In.

260
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:51,383
Just think that I've gone crazy.

261
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:55,283
Chang Ryul, you crazy little...

262
00:17:55,849 --> 00:17:58,416
But you see, that Bundang (city in Korea) mom...

263
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:01,616
whenever my father tried to hit me with his golf clubs,

264
00:18:01,616 --> 00:18:04,082
she covered me with her own body.

265
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:06,649
She even got a scar on her hand doing that...

266
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,016
Kae In, I know

267
00:18:10,016 --> 00:18:12,416
it's a crazy thing to even say.

268
00:18:14,449 --> 00:18:15,449
However,

269
00:18:15,449 --> 00:18:18,182
I'm doing it because 
I don't have anyone to turn to but you.

270
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,749
You're really something.

271
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:24,749
How could you ask me to do something like this?

272
00:18:26,116 --> 00:18:27,449
The truth is...

273
00:18:29,116 --> 00:18:30,616
this mom who's leaving...

274
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:35,716
is my real mother.

275
00:18:40,915 --> 00:18:41,682
But...

276
00:18:41,682 --> 00:18:43,682
I thought you said your real mom

277
00:18:43,682 --> 00:18:45,515
passed away.

278
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:47,915
My father...

279
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:51,549
had been cheating on her, that's why she left.

280
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,482
That's why "my mother passed away"...

281
00:18:55,482 --> 00:18:57,049
That's what I told myself.

282
00:18:58,815 --> 00:19:00,649
I know it doesn't make sense,

283
00:19:02,715 --> 00:19:04,749
but my mother's last wish...

284
00:19:07,115 --> 00:19:09,015
I really want to fulfill it.

285
00:19:27,318 --> 00:19:28,484
Excuse me...

286
00:19:28,484 --> 00:19:29,951
Jin Ho...

287
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:31,284
Our date...

288
00:19:31,284 --> 00:19:33,251
can't we do it another time?

289
00:19:34,517 --> 00:19:36,284
I got a phone call from a friend.

290
00:19:36,284 --> 00:19:38,046
She just gave birth.

291
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:39,613
You see, that friend

292
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:46,551
doesn't have a mother or any close relatives anymore, 
so I'm the only one she can count on...

293
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:48,984
Weren't your only friends Young Sun and In Hee?

294
00:19:48,984 --> 00:19:50,250
Hey... that...

295
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,250
Jin Ho,

296
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,106
I'm not totally without friends you know!

297
00:19:55,217 --> 00:19:56,253
Wait...

298
00:19:57,128 --> 00:19:57,986
By any chance,

299
00:19:57,986 --> 00:20:00,384
are you disappointed 
because we can't go on that date?

300
00:20:00,384 --> 00:20:02,150
Why should I be disappointed?

301
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:05,944
On the contrary, I'm glad that I don't 
have to go to all that trouble after all.

302
00:20:06,617 --> 00:20:08,650
Why do you always have to...

303
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,050
Weren't you the one that brought up 
the date in the first place?

304
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:15,005
That's just because continuing this "Making her into a woman" project would be even more troublesome.

305
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,784
Let's just get it over with.

306
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:17,484
That's what I meant.

307
00:20:17,484 --> 00:20:18,650
Jin Ho...

308
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,017
do you always have to be so cold?

309
00:20:33,383 --> 00:20:34,222
I know.

310
00:20:34,222 --> 00:20:36,716
Things don't always go as you plan.

311
00:20:37,853 --> 00:20:38,884
You...

312
00:20:40,086 --> 00:20:41,817
you don't even know how to get angry!

313
00:20:41,817 --> 00:20:43,483
Just let your anger out.

314
00:20:44,997 --> 00:20:45,917
Fool.

315
00:20:46,686 --> 00:20:50,183
Why can't you just be honest to a friend?

316
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,550
Are these all you've got?

317
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,083
Oh, Jin Ho!

318
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:03,283
Where are you going?

319
00:21:03,283 --> 00:21:05,016
What difference would knowing that make to you?

320
00:21:05,016 --> 00:21:07,183
Sorry...

321
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,047
I'm the one that cancelled our date,

322
00:21:09,047 --> 00:21:11,850
and yet I was the one who got mad.

323
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,450
I was wrong.

324
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:16,716
But...

325
00:21:16,716 --> 00:21:19,150
you are going to give me another 
chance to take that final test, right?

326
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:24,915
But where are you going?

327
00:21:24,915 --> 00:21:26,116
Where are you going?

328
00:21:26,183 --> 00:21:27,883
Take me with you too.

329
00:21:34,516 --> 00:21:36,283

330
00:21:43,516 --> 00:21:45,583
Hey, we're going to get into an accident. 
Keep your head in the car.

331
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,149
Jin Ho,

332
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:50,649
you've never shouted like this before, have you?

333
00:21:52,088 --> 00:21:53,803
Even if you're angry, you repress it.

334
00:21:53,803 --> 00:21:55,283
&gt;hen you're sad, you repress it.

335
00:21:55,283 --> 00:21:56,849
You think I'm some sort of cartoon character?

336
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,183
Exactly.

337
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,449
Even if you aren't a cartoon character,

338
00:21:59,449 --> 00:22:02,016
why do you repress yourself when you're sad or lonely?

339
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:03,649
I'm not lonely, and I'm not sad.

340
00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:05,116
You're going to get sick that way.

341
00:22:07,482 --> 00:22:08,482
All right,

342
00:22:08,482 --> 00:22:10,249
nobody's going to hear you if you shout now,

343
00:22:10,249 --> 00:22:11,382
so try shouting good and loud!

344
00:22:11,382 --> 00:22:12,185
Right?

345
00:22:13,382 --> 00:22:14,722
Like this.

346
00:22:14,722 --> 00:22:16,320
What are you waiting for?

347
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:20,916
Yah!

348
00:22:22,182 --> 00:22:24,039
Louder!

349
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:24,716
YAH!

350
00:22:24,716 --> 00:22:26,216
Don't kid around with me!

351
00:22:26,216 --> 00:22:27,882
If you do, you're dead!

352
00:22:27,882 --> 00:22:28,563
Like this.

353
00:22:28,563 --> 00:22:29,949
I can't do it like you do.

354
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:31,849
Come on, just give it one try.

355
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:33,882
You feel so much better inside afterward.

356
00:22:33,882 --> 00:22:35,049
Right?

357
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:36,382
Come on. Do it to please a friend!

358
00:22:36,382 --> 00:22:37,382
Just go ahead and give it a go!

359
00:22:37,382 --> 00:22:39,252
Stop doing that!  I told you, we'll have an accident!

360
00:22:39,252 --> 00:22:40,249
Aha!

361
00:22:40,249 --> 00:22:42,049
You dropped the formal speech!

362
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:42,849
Jin Ho.

363
00:22:42,849 --> 00:22:44,349
Can't we carry on talking this way? Can't we? Uh?

364
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:48,349
That was a slip. It was just because you scared me.

365
00:22:48,349 --> 00:22:48,949
Okay.

366
00:22:48,949 --> 00:22:49,582
In that case,

367
00:22:49,582 --> 00:22:52,882
we'll argue about that one later. For now...

368
00:22:52,882 --> 00:22:54,815
just try giving a really loud yell. 
For friendship's sake, uh?

369
00:22:54,815 --> 00:22:56,649
Just one yell, just one will do!

370
00:23:01,168 --> 00:23:02,449
More loudly!

371
00:23:07,082 --> 00:23:09,848
Jin Ho, you're shouting like a girl.

372
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:11,648
YAAHH!  Like that.

373
00:23:13,182 --> 00:23:15,115
Yah!!! You are all dead today!

374
00:23:15,115 --> 00:23:16,615
OK!

375
00:23:16,615 --> 00:23:18,948
YAH! YOU GUYS ARE ALL DEAD!

376
00:23:18,948 --> 00:23:21,048
YAH! YOU GUYS ARE ALL DEAD!

377
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:22,648
LOUDER!

378
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:36,748
So...

379
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:40,416
after shouting like that, you feel a lot better, don't you?

380
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:41,718
Having a friend like me

381
00:23:41,718 --> 00:23:43,281
is better than not having a friend, right?

382
00:23:44,918 --> 00:23:46,281
The two of us,

383
00:23:46,281 --> 00:23:47,781
since we're already out here,

384
00:23:48,615 --> 00:23:50,281
do you think we should do that final test now?

385
00:23:51,928 --> 00:23:53,548
I'm not in the mood for that now.

386
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:57,915
Then if you're not in the mood, I'll help you brighten your mood.

387
00:23:57,915 --> 00:23:59,681
You're not curious how many points I'll get?

388
00:23:59,681 --> 00:24:01,448
I know I'll do well for sure.

389
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,581
Park Kae In.

390
00:24:11,615 --> 00:24:12,715
Yes?

391
00:24:12,748 --> 00:24:14,288
Don't fall for me.

392
00:24:15,714 --> 00:24:17,681
Because it's not you that I love.

393
00:24:19,914 --> 00:24:20,949
I see...

394
00:24:22,214 --> 00:24:24,381
Of course...

395
00:24:26,581 --> 00:24:27,885
Oh, is this...

396
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:29,914
is this part of the test?

397
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:34,228
Wow...

398
00:24:34,228 --> 00:24:36,914
It really felt like it was for real.

399
00:24:36,914 --> 00:24:38,681
Continue on.

400
00:24:38,681 --> 00:24:40,748
That means...

401
00:24:40,748 --> 00:24:42,781
we'd be starting a long-term relationship.

402
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,181
The reason I decided to date you

403
00:24:46,181 --> 00:24:48,714
was because you were so much like

404
00:24:48,714 --> 00:24:50,381
an ex girlfriend I was in love with.

405
00:24:52,847 --> 00:24:55,934
I can't forget that woman.

406
00:24:55,947 --> 00:24:58,414
No matter how hard I try,

407
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,577
I can't shake the memories of her.

408
00:25:03,181 --> 00:25:04,781
So in the future,

409
00:25:05,814 --> 00:25:08,614
I might even accidentally call you by her name,

410
00:25:10,047 --> 00:25:13,247
I might even end up asking you

411
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:14,881
to act like that girl for me.

412
00:25:17,881 --> 00:25:19,547
Would you be able to accept that?

413
00:25:25,347 --> 00:25:27,347
You must have...

414
00:25:27,347 --> 00:25:30,180
really loved that woman a lot.

415
00:25:31,214 --> 00:25:32,237
I did.

416
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,447
I'll do it.

417
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,714
Since

418
00:25:39,714 --> 00:25:42,914
Jin Ho, I love so much.

419
00:25:42,914 --> 00:25:44,847
And when you really love someone, you should...

420
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:46,180
try to do what they want you to do--

421
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,514
Hey, Park Kae In.

422
00:25:47,514 --> 00:25:48,980
Is this what I taught you?

423
00:25:51,314 --> 00:25:53,414
Nothing's changed.

424
00:25:53,414 --> 00:25:55,747
Are you any less of a foolish woman than you used to be?

425
00:25:55,747 --> 00:25:57,047
No...

426
00:25:57,047 --> 00:25:59,080
It's just...

427
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,632
Those words...

428
00:26:00,632 --> 00:26:03,113
just came out of my mouth.

429
00:26:03,113 --> 00:26:05,747
Jin Ho, you were asking me so passionately.

430
00:26:05,747 --> 00:26:09,147
How long will you let people manipulate you like that?

431
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:22,747
Then...

432
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,213
how was I supposed to respond?

433
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,946
Being in love with someone...

434
00:26:31,946 --> 00:26:33,680
means pride doesn't matter.

435
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,346
You throw it all away.

436
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,213
Love doesn't make you throw away your pride.

437
00:26:41,246 --> 00:26:42,813
It defends your pride.

438
00:26:45,213 --> 00:26:47,113
So from now on, change your ways.

439
00:26:47,113 --> 00:26:49,880
Stop trusting people so readily,

440
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,713
don't love them so readily,

441
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,914
and don't be so ready to forgive them, either.

442
00:27:01,979 --> 00:27:03,079
Please.

443
00:27:04,446 --> 00:27:05,779
Grow stronger.

444
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:13,813
I'll do that.

445
00:27:14,879 --> 00:27:16,346
I'll try my best.

446
00:27:17,746 --> 00:27:21,983
 Then you shouldn't have agreed to help Chang Ryul. 

447
00:27:22,879 --> 00:27:25,013
 You're never going to change. 

448
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:29,479
So that's everything...

449
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:31,646
I have to teach you.

450
00:27:32,413 --> 00:27:34,613
How come?

451
00:27:34,613 --> 00:27:36,112
You have no trust in me?

452
00:27:40,728 --> 00:27:42,279
Hey, I'm going to try!

453
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:43,848
I can change.

454
00:27:43,848 --> 00:27:47,204
If you don't trust me, who will?

455
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:56,007

456
00:27:57,598 --> 00:27:59,286
Go in.

457
00:28:00,706 --> 00:28:02,347
What about you?

458
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,713
I have to go somewhere.

459
00:28:05,713 --> 00:28:06,627
Will you be late?

460
00:28:06,627 --> 00:28:08,520
I don't know that myself.

461
00:29:14,793 --> 00:29:16,957
 Please, 

462
00:29:16,957 --> 00:29:18,571
 grow strong. 

463
00:29:59,046 --> 00:30:01,804
Is this...

464
00:30:01,804 --> 00:30:04,579
Was it you that...?

465
00:30:04,579 --> 00:30:05,913
Never forget,

466
00:30:05,913 --> 00:30:08,081
roses have thorns.

467
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:11,213
The moment you realize that,

468
00:30:11,213 --> 00:30:13,906
no matter what you have to do, you'll succeed.

469
00:30:24,831 --> 00:30:26,246
Hey!

470
00:30:27,379 --> 00:30:30,146
Jinsung High School have made enquiries 
about building a gym.

471
00:30:30,146 --> 00:30:32,450
It looks more promising than we thought.

472
00:30:33,979 --> 00:30:36,046
And also...

473
00:30:40,356 --> 00:30:41,679
Yes, Kim In Hee?

474
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:42,579
I think my boss...

475
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:44,244
has gone to his country villa.

476
00:30:44,244 --> 00:30:45,879
If I tell you where it is,

477
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:47,479
please try to find him there.

478
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:48,679
From what I heard...

479
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:50,279
from President Choi's secretaries,

480
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:52,612
my boss and his father quarreled violently,

481
00:30:52,612 --> 00:30:55,279
and he left for the villa.

482
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,179
So I think you may still be in with a chance.

483
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:58,712
Please don't give up.

484
00:30:59,556 --> 00:31:00,879
In any case,

485
00:31:00,879 --> 00:31:02,425
thank you very much.

486
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:05,545
 Be strong, Jin Ho.   

487
00:31:05,545 --> 00:31:08,590
Since our bid for the Dam Arts Center project is dead in the water,

488
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,579
what's Kim In Hee phoning you about?

489
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:26,379
Unni?

490
00:31:26,379 --> 00:31:28,645
Why are you calling so early in the day?

491
00:31:28,645 --> 00:31:31,345
"Unni"?!

492
00:31:31,345 --> 00:31:33,679
Yes!  This is tasty.

493
00:31:38,378 --> 00:31:41,145
From today onwards, let's stop being gay.

494
00:31:41,145 --> 00:31:42,545
Young Sun,

495
00:31:42,545 --> 00:31:44,245
I'm a straight man.

496
00:31:44,245 --> 00:31:45,312
Okay?

497
00:31:45,312 --> 00:31:47,412
So everything's fine?

498
00:31:47,412 --> 00:31:48,978
Ah, that's right!

499
00:31:48,978 --> 00:31:49,778
I noticed the other day,

500
00:31:49,778 --> 00:31:51,578
you were concerned about skin,

501
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:53,645
so I thought maybe,

502
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:54,578
vitamins and face cleansers were what you needed.

503
00:31:54,578 --> 00:31:56,178
You just need to put this in water.

504
00:31:56,178 --> 00:31:57,645
Once you start neglecting your complexion,

505
00:31:57,645 --> 00:31:59,778
it quickly deteriorates.

506
00:32:02,478 --> 00:32:03,877
Thank you, unni.

507
00:32:06,178 --> 00:32:06,812
Unni,

508
00:32:06,812 --> 00:32:08,645
Yeah?

509
00:32:08,645 --> 00:32:10,445
I have a confession to make...

510
00:32:10,445 --> 00:32:10,845
Yes, what is it?

511
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,406
Out with it!  Out with it!

512
00:32:12,406 --> 00:32:14,575
The truth is,

513
00:32:14,575 --> 00:32:16,730
I'm straight.

514
00:32:17,678 --> 00:32:18,978
Really?

515
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,318
No!

516
00:32:22,011 --> 00:32:24,083
You don't look like one.

517
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:25,184
Geez.

518
00:32:28,311 --> 00:32:29,878
Actually,

519
00:32:29,878 --> 00:32:31,378
I have a confession to make, too.

520
00:32:31,378 --> 00:32:32,547
What... what... what?

521
00:32:32,547 --> 00:32:36,155
This is something you please mustn't mention to Kae In...

522
00:32:36,992 --> 00:32:40,853
Considering me as a woman,

523
00:32:40,853 --> 00:32:42,145
what do you think of me?

524
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:47,393
Are you asking me if I think of you as a woman?

525
00:32:47,393 --> 00:32:48,311
No.

526
00:32:48,311 --> 00:32:48,978
It's just that...

527
00:32:48,978 --> 00:32:50,546
they always say people of your sort

528
00:32:50,546 --> 00:32:51,787
have a particularly good aesthetic sensibility,

529
00:32:51,787 --> 00:32:53,784
so I thought you could give me an objective opinion.

530
00:32:53,784 --> 00:32:56,511
Am I maybe... not attractive as a woman?

531
00:32:56,511 --> 00:32:58,411
How can you say that?

532
00:32:58,411 --> 00:32:59,878
You're really fantastic.

533
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:01,311
You're a very good looker!

534
00:33:01,311 --> 00:33:02,678
I am, aren't I?

535
00:33:02,678 --> 00:33:04,520
What would I do without you, little sis?

536
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,244
But really,

537
00:33:05,244 --> 00:33:06,688
I try hard to look after my complexion, too,

538
00:33:06,688 --> 00:33:08,611
and I go to a health club too.

539
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,444
Your body is so great!

540
00:33:10,444 --> 00:33:12,279
Your body... well...

541
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:12,844
It's great!

542
00:33:12,844 --> 00:33:15,211
You're absolutely right!

543
00:33:15,211 --> 00:33:16,844
But why did you ask me that?

544
00:33:16,844 --> 00:33:19,244
Well, it's just that...

545
00:33:19,244 --> 00:33:20,744
So as a woman, I'm "very good"?

546
00:33:20,744 --> 00:33:22,144
Very good.

547
00:33:22,144 --> 00:33:23,277
And I'm great?

548
00:33:23,277 --> 00:33:25,511
Oh!  You've no idea how fantastic it is to have a friend like you!

549
00:33:25,511 --> 00:33:27,977
Oh!  You've no idea how fantastic it is to have a friend like you!

550
00:33:28,577 --> 00:33:29,411
I'm just going to the bathroom, okay?

551
00:33:29,411 --> 00:33:30,144
Okay.

552
00:33:30,144 --> 00:33:31,911
There may be no tissues.

553
00:33:31,911 --> 00:33:33,177
Oh, thanks...

554
00:33:34,811 --> 00:33:36,177
What am I going to do?

555
00:33:36,177 --> 00:33:38,211
It's like I suddenly got hooked on acting gay.

556
00:33:40,277 --> 00:33:41,477
Excuse me...

557
00:33:45,977 --> 00:33:47,577
Oh!

558
00:33:47,577 --> 00:33:49,511
You're back already?

559
00:33:49,977 --> 00:33:52,077
Why are you so scatterbrained today?

560
00:33:52,077 --> 00:33:53,844
Ah, well...

561
00:33:53,844 --> 00:33:55,444
I told you earlier,

562
00:33:55,444 --> 00:33:56,744
that my friend,

563
00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:57,877
was having a baby...

564
00:33:57,877 --> 00:34:01,377
So I need to hurry and go now...

565
00:34:01,377 --> 00:34:04,110
Then, shouldn't you have gone earlier?

566
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,044
Oh, of course I went already!

567
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,544
I went earlier,

568
00:34:07,544 --> 00:34:09,510
but the baby puked over my hair

569
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,177
so I had to nip back home and wash it.

570
00:34:11,177 --> 00:34:14,544
I'll be going right on back.

571
00:34:14,544 --> 00:34:16,510
Mind how you go, then.

572
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,077
Park Kae In...

573
00:34:24,077 --> 00:34:27,643
why are you telling lies like this?

574
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:40,577
In Hee, you're such a good eater.

575
00:34:40,577 --> 00:34:46,077
I was a bit worried when I heard you were a gallery curator, but... wowee!

576
00:34:50,077 --> 00:34:52,210
Mom. In Hee,

577
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:54,910
she can't pay attention to much else when she sees good food.

578
00:34:54,910 --> 00:35:00,543
That's fine.  Someone who really enjoys their food seldom has a bad character.

579
00:35:00,543 --> 00:35:04,310
But, In Hee, you don't have much to say.

580
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:08,576
You greeted me when you arrived 
but you haven't said a word since then, have you?

581
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,243
Oh, oh, oh.

582
00:35:14,243 --> 00:35:16,710
I'll bring you more.

583
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,743
Yeah.

584
00:35:18,576 --> 00:35:19,576
Talk some, why don't you?

585
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:21,776
You're doing nothing but eating.

586
00:35:21,776 --> 00:35:23,443
You said eating was all I had to do.

587
00:35:23,443 --> 00:35:25,076
But still--

588
00:35:25,076 --> 00:35:28,810
Isn't it delicious? You're eating so well.

589
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:30,309
Seeing how In Hee really enjoys her food makes me very happy.

590
00:35:30,309 --> 00:35:32,509
Seeing how In Hee really enjoys her food makes me very happy.

591
00:35:32,509 --> 00:35:33,176
In Hee,

592
00:35:33,176 --> 00:35:34,143
after we eat,

593
00:35:34,143 --> 00:35:35,943
let's talk a lot.

594
00:35:35,943 --> 00:35:37,876
How you met Chang Ryul,

595
00:35:37,876 --> 00:35:40,043
how he proposed to you,

596
00:35:40,043 --> 00:35:41,409
there's so much I'm curious about,

597
00:35:41,409 --> 00:35:43,109
from start to finish!

598
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:44,143
Mom.

599
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:45,709
I'll tell you all that stuff.

600
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:46,843
My In Hee...

601
00:35:46,843 --> 00:35:48,376
is a woman of very few words,

602
00:35:48,376 --> 00:35:50,943
and she feels more comfortable not talking.

603
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:06,409
What am I doing here?

604
00:36:06,409 --> 00:36:09,709
You should be ashamed of yourself, Park Kae In.

605
00:36:12,209 --> 00:36:15,176
I hear you got into out-an-out rivalry with Jin Ho?

606
00:36:15,176 --> 00:36:16,908
How did that happen?

607
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:18,742
Was it over the Dam Arts Center project?

608
00:36:18,742 --> 00:36:21,276
I wanted to win that on my own merits,

609
00:36:21,276 --> 00:36:23,441
but of course father had to go 
putting his boot in before I got a chance,

610
00:36:23,441 --> 00:36:24,342
in his usual way.

611
00:36:24,342 --> 00:36:26,776
What did your father do?

612
00:36:26,776 --> 00:36:28,809
He talked to the MS Group President into making sure

613
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:31,542
that that Jin Ho kid was squeezed out.

614
00:36:31,542 --> 00:36:33,509
And quite right too.

615
00:36:33,509 --> 00:36:38,409
I was secretly worried the ill-fated relationship 
between your fathers might carry over to you two.

616
00:36:40,975 --> 00:36:43,175
Oh! Why are you just standing there like that?

617
00:36:43,175 --> 00:36:44,409
Hurry and come over here!

618
00:36:44,409 --> 00:36:48,322
I have something to give to you, In Hee.

619
00:36:48,322 --> 00:36:48,393
Here.

620
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,455
I was given this when I got married to Chang Ryul's father.

621
00:36:53,455 --> 00:36:54,884
I wanted to give it to you.

622
00:36:54,884 --> 00:36:58,109
Oh... No, I couldn't...

623
00:37:04,584 --> 00:37:06,260
Oh my! It's pretty!

624
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,441
It suits you perfectly!

625
00:37:10,017 --> 00:37:11,336
It's pretty!

626
00:37:11,817 --> 00:37:13,817
It's really pretty.

627
00:37:20,284 --> 00:37:24,727
I'm really, really grateful to you for today.

628
00:37:27,697 --> 00:37:28,829
What's wrong?

629
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:32,484
Ah, why are you giving this to me?

630
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:34,280
My mom gave it to you.

631
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,817
She gave it to In Hee.

632
00:37:37,117 --> 00:37:39,484
In Hee doesn't deserve to get this.

633
00:37:39,484 --> 00:37:42,320
And I have no reason to accept it.

634
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,384
Kae In, still,

635
00:37:43,384 --> 00:37:45,184
since my mom gave it to you,

636
00:37:45,184 --> 00:37:46,384
do whatever you want with it.

637
00:37:46,384 --> 00:37:49,217
Do I have to do these petty things too?

638
00:37:49,217 --> 00:37:51,350
Whether you throw it away or give it to In Hee,

639
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,950
you take care of it, Chang Ryul.

640
00:37:54,317 --> 00:37:55,850
Kae In!

641
00:37:59,783 --> 00:38:03,817

642
00:38:24,217 --> 00:38:25,117
What's wrong?

643
00:38:25,117 --> 00:38:27,050
Do you have indigestion?

644
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:43,083
What could you have possibly eaten when you were out...

645
00:38:49,773 --> 00:38:51,127
It's like this...

646
00:38:51,127 --> 00:38:55,280
I ate everything of what everybody else left over...

647
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,848
I must've gotten indigestion.

648
00:38:58,316 --> 00:38:59,516
Go on in and sleep.

649
00:38:59,516 --> 00:39:01,749
Jin Ho,

650
00:39:01,749 --> 00:39:07,762
I'm still feeling a little queasy...
 Do you think you could prick my finger for me?

651
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,383
I don't know how to do those things.

652
00:39:09,383 --> 00:39:10,416
Oh, it's quite easy.

653
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:13,832
You just need to stick a needle in at the tip.

654
00:39:13,832 --> 00:39:14,949
If it's that easy, why don't you do it on your own?

655
00:39:14,949 --> 00:39:17,583
Oh that... I'm scared of doing it on my own.

656
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:19,849
Oh, I don't want to. I can't do it.

657
00:39:25,582 --> 00:39:27,816
Jin Ho, quickly stick the needle in.

658
00:39:30,616 --> 00:39:31,416
Right here?

659
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:33,016
No, right there.

660
00:39:33,016 --> 00:39:34,616
You seem to know it well.

661
00:39:34,616 --> 00:39:35,404
You mean here, right?

662
00:39:35,404 --> 00:39:36,982
Yes.

663
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:48,169
Ouch!! Were you trying to drill right the way through?

664
00:39:48,616 --> 00:39:49,249
Oh!

665
00:39:49,249 --> 00:39:52,593
Blood keeps gushing out.  Isn't there too much?

666
00:39:52,593 --> 00:39:54,316
Did... Did I do it right?

667
00:39:54,316 --> 00:39:54,982
Yes.

668
00:39:54,982 --> 00:39:56,382
Is that all?

669
00:39:56,382 --> 00:39:57,816
Yes.

670
00:39:57,816 --> 00:39:59,449
Wait...

671
00:39:59,449 --> 00:40:01,749
Jin Ho.

672
00:40:02,388 --> 00:40:04,382
Your father...

673
00:40:04,382 --> 00:40:09,515
... and Chang Ryul's father, 
did they have some sort of troubled relationship?

674
00:40:14,249 --> 00:40:15,349
How did you know that?

675
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:18,615
Oh... Some time back...

676
00:40:18,615 --> 00:40:22,515
Chang Ryul mentioned it to me, 
and it recently came to my mind again.

677
00:40:22,982 --> 00:40:24,982
What would Chang Ryul possibly have to say?

678
00:40:24,982 --> 00:40:26,115
But...

679
00:40:26,115 --> 00:40:29,615
I really didn't get to hear anything. What happened?

680
00:40:30,104 --> 00:40:35,215
Chang Ryul's father used to work as 
a subordinate in my father's company.

681
00:40:35,815 --> 00:40:36,882
But...

682
00:40:36,882 --> 00:40:40,215
he conspired with some competitors

683
00:40:40,215 --> 00:40:43,315
and seized control of the firm.

684
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:52,115
I see... That's why... you're always so hard on yourself.

685
00:40:52,115 --> 00:40:55,015
What's been the point of being hard on myself?

686
00:40:55,015 --> 00:40:59,415
No matter how hard I strain or run, I'm always 
still leaden-footed in the same spot.

687
00:40:59,815 --> 00:41:02,182
Don't give up.

688
00:41:02,182 --> 00:41:04,315
That's not like you.

689
00:41:04,315 --> 00:41:08,815
Are you going to let cowardly opponents 
who attack from behind

690
00:41:08,815 --> 00:41:10,348
and plot against you win out over you?

691
00:41:10,348 --> 00:41:13,382
But... How did you find out about that?

692
00:41:13,382 --> 00:41:16,248
Ah, that... You see...

693
00:41:16,248 --> 00:41:19,515
When I was at the gallery, I heard people talking.

694
00:41:19,515 --> 00:41:24,615
About how Chang Ryul's father had 
influenced the President of the MS group.

695
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:26,015
It's time for bed.

696
00:41:26,015 --> 00:41:27,415
Excuse me.

697
00:41:27,415 --> 00:41:29,315
Jin Ho.

698
00:41:29,315 --> 00:41:31,181
Let me make you something yummy.

699
00:41:31,181 --> 00:41:32,848
I told you before.

700
00:41:32,848 --> 00:41:35,115
No matter what hardships and discouragement you may be facing,

701
00:41:35,115 --> 00:41:37,281
if you sit down to a delicious meal someone's made for you,

702
00:41:37,281 --> 00:41:39,848
you think, "Right. Everything will be alright.
 Let's eat and build up my strength."

703
00:41:39,848 --> 00:41:42,281
And sure enough, you do get new vigor and energy.

704
00:41:44,248 --> 00:41:47,081
Be strong, Jin Ho.

705
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:51,814
Don't go picking at whatever's left over anymore.

706
00:41:54,314 --> 00:41:57,848
 

707
00:42:35,947 --> 00:42:38,414
Please, grab a fishing rod and sit down.

708
00:42:38,414 --> 00:42:39,247
Pardon?

709
00:42:39,247 --> 00:42:40,514
Mr. Jeon,

710
00:42:40,514 --> 00:42:43,214
the way you're standing there

711
00:42:43,214 --> 00:42:44,847
is scaring all the fish away.

712
00:42:44,847 --> 00:42:47,332
Ah... Yes.

713
00:42:55,414 --> 00:42:57,714
Have you ever gone fishing?

714
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,514
No.

715
00:43:02,147 --> 00:43:04,214
Take this then.

716
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,980
What... is this?

717
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:09,747
It's what the fish here like the most.

718
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,314
They are still alive.

719
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,880
Give it here.

720
00:43:22,947 --> 00:43:23,847
Oh!

721
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,480
What's wrong, Mr. Jeon?

722
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,113
You look like the kind of person who's not afraid of anything.

723
00:43:38,613 --> 00:43:43,280
Why... are you not speaking about the Dam Arts Center Project?

724
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,980
That must be the reason why you're here...

725
00:43:48,613 --> 00:43:51,613
Right now, I feel like becoming friends

726
00:43:51,613 --> 00:43:54,047
would be better.

727
00:43:55,513 --> 00:43:57,713
Mr. Jeon,

728
00:43:57,713 --> 00:44:00,947
have you ever confessed your love to someone?

729
00:44:01,813 --> 00:44:04,846
In all my life so far,

730
00:44:04,846 --> 00:44:07,246
I've only ever tried it once.

731
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:10,413
I did have a friend who I gave my heart to.

732
00:44:10,413 --> 00:44:13,380
In my case, it was a younger university 
classmate of mine.

733
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,380
Same here.

734
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,680
What happened?

735
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,480
It was my fault.

736
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:26,780
I felt the responsibilities of being in love 
were too much for me.

737
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:29,046
Do you regret it?

738
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,880
Maybe so.

739
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,446
I...

740
00:44:33,446 --> 00:44:37,079
Because that person worked part-time at the library,

741
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:41,513
I never missed a day of going to the library myself.

742
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:44,446
Naturally, I confessed my love.

743
00:44:44,446 --> 00:44:48,546
And although it was very brief, we did love each other.

744
00:44:48,546 --> 00:44:51,079
And then we broke up.

745
00:44:53,446 --> 00:44:56,446
It's a boring story, isn't it?

746
00:44:56,879 --> 00:44:57,779
Why...

747
00:44:57,779 --> 00:44:59,113
did you two break up?

748
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:02,213
To that person my love was...

749
00:45:02,213 --> 00:45:05,213
no different from poison.

750
00:45:05,213 --> 00:45:10,379
That's why I first suggested that we break up.

751
00:45:10,379 --> 00:45:14,946
The handkerchief I lent to you

752
00:45:14,946 --> 00:45:17,046
was a present that the person gave to me.

753
00:45:17,046 --> 00:45:21,745
Why give it to me, if it was such a treasured gift?

754
00:45:22,612 --> 00:45:28,046
I guess so that we can be friends like this.

755
00:45:44,912 --> 00:45:48,479
Now that I've done everything I can,

756
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:51,679
I have no regrets.

757
00:45:56,512 --> 00:46:01,545
The night sky I've seen sitting here in Sang Go Jae...

758
00:46:01,545 --> 00:46:05,045
I think I'll spend the rest of my life longing to see it.

759
00:46:05,045 --> 00:46:11,379
So... let's just stay living here for a really, really long time.

760
00:46:29,612 --> 00:46:30,445
You came?

761
00:46:30,445 --> 00:46:33,178
Oh! Hyung... This...

762
00:46:33,178 --> 00:46:35,078
Ah... What is this?!

763
00:46:35,078 --> 00:46:36,012
Isn't that Jin Ho hyung's shirt?

764
00:46:36,012 --> 00:46:37,912
Jin Ho doesn't wear it, so I took it and wore it.

765
00:46:37,912 --> 00:46:39,154
Did you have the same thing?

766
00:46:39,154 --> 00:46:41,187
I bought the same thing that Jin Ho did.

767
00:46:41,187 --> 00:46:42,021
Are you two dating?!

768
00:46:42,021 --> 00:46:43,921
I'm following him because Hye Mi liked it.

769
00:46:43,921 --> 00:46:47,821
From now on, everything that Jin Ho 
has and eats, I'm going to follow.

770
00:46:48,321 --> 00:46:49,421
Ah, hyung!

771
00:46:49,421 --> 00:46:51,187
Don't give this to Sang Jun hyung!

772
00:46:51,187 --> 00:46:52,521
It looks like it's going to explode.

773
00:46:52,521 --> 00:46:53,721
Ah, you really...

774
00:46:53,721 --> 00:46:55,121
Tae Hoon,

775
00:46:55,121 --> 00:46:57,354
if you're going to keep on letting
  your private life interfere with work,

776
00:46:57,354 --> 00:46:58,687
then write your resignation letter.

777
00:47:02,587 --> 00:47:04,821
Don't you think Jin Ho hyung is being too strict with me?

778
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:07,154
It's because you're wearing Jin Ho's clothes.

779
00:47:07,154 --> 00:47:09,887
Ah, but you're also wearing the same thing...

780
00:47:09,887 --> 00:47:12,054
Hey, but it's different.

781
00:47:12,754 --> 00:47:14,987
The relationship between Jin Ho and me,

782
00:47:14,987 --> 00:47:16,954
there's a secret that you don't know.

783
00:47:32,287 --> 00:47:34,620
 Jin Ho, 

784
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:36,287
 are you crying? 

785
00:47:53,553 --> 00:47:55,920
Why am I like this?

786
00:47:59,153 --> 00:48:00,487
I mean,

787
00:48:00,487 --> 00:48:03,020
what does that mean?

788
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,187
Even if I'm not there,

789
00:48:05,187 --> 00:48:08,187
I'll tell the office all about you,

790
00:48:08,187 --> 00:48:10,387
so don't worry about it...

791
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,920
But why so suddenly?

792
00:48:13,653 --> 00:48:15,020
Is it...

793
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,220
because of the Dam Arts Center ?

794
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,353
That incident

795
00:48:20,353 --> 00:48:22,553
makes you really worried about Mr. Jeon, right?

796
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,020
Yes.

797
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,786
The Dam Arts Center...

798
00:48:26,786 --> 00:48:29,286
I'm thinking of fighting for it one last time.

799
00:48:29,286 --> 00:48:31,020
If things work out, I'll stay.

800
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:33,020
But if it doesn't work,

801
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:34,353
then I'm going to leave.

802
00:48:34,353 --> 00:48:36,120
Director Choi...

803
00:48:36,853 --> 00:48:39,086
So that's why I'm telling you this.

804
00:48:39,086 --> 00:48:40,486
I might even have to leave without saying goodbye.

805
00:48:40,486 --> 00:48:43,086
I might even have to leave without saying goodbye.

806
00:48:43,586 --> 00:48:45,286
Then.

807
00:48:47,953 --> 00:48:49,620
Director Choi!

808
00:48:54,919 --> 00:48:56,786
Fighting!

809
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:10,319
But we've put together a great concept presentation,

810
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:11,353
don't you think?

811
00:49:11,353 --> 00:49:13,919
All the same, going in without an appointment is a bit...

812
00:49:13,919 --> 00:49:16,986
And talking about the Dam Arts Center Project, 
do you think he will like it?

813
00:49:16,986 --> 00:49:18,353
You punk.

814
00:49:18,353 --> 00:49:21,853
Do you think that guy would welcome us 
with open arms if we asked for an appointment?

815
00:49:21,853 --> 00:49:24,319
To pull off something like this,

816
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,086
you have to go in there with all guns blazing.

817
00:49:26,086 --> 00:49:27,652
Do you understand?

818
00:49:31,819 --> 00:49:33,386
That woman...

819
00:49:34,252 --> 00:49:36,686
wasn't she the one who ruined your wedding?

820
00:49:36,686 --> 00:49:38,186
It is her, isn't it?

821
00:49:38,186 --> 00:49:40,686
You are very sharp-eyed, sir.

822
00:49:40,786 --> 00:49:43,486
But then once seen, she's never forgotten...

823
00:49:43,486 --> 00:49:46,619
But what's she doing here?

824
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:47,919
Go find out...

825
00:49:47,919 --> 00:49:49,519
what she's come here for.

826
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,019
Yes, sir.

827
00:49:52,952 --> 00:49:59,485
 English

828
00:50:01,052 --> 00:50:03,585
Like I told you on the way here,

829
00:50:03,585 --> 00:50:06,752
without an appointment, we won't get to see him.

830
00:50:06,752 --> 00:50:08,552
President!

831
00:50:09,952 --> 00:50:11,652
I found out.

832
00:50:11,652 --> 00:50:13,419
Park Kae In,

833
00:50:13,419 --> 00:50:15,919
because she's Park Chul Han's daughter,

834
00:50:15,919 --> 00:50:17,519
Director Choi hired her

835
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:20,785
to be in charge of the children's section of the Gallery.

836
00:50:20,785 --> 00:50:22,719
What?

837
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:23,885
Who is who's daughter?

838
00:50:23,885 --> 00:50:26,985
Park Kae In is Park Chul Han's daughter.

839
00:50:28,152 --> 00:50:29,119
You...

840
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,819
You rejected Park Chul Han's daughter,

841
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:33,418
and married that other girl instead?!

842
00:50:33,418 --> 00:50:34,752
What's wrong with that?

843
00:50:34,752 --> 00:50:36,885
Do you not know who Professor Park Chul Han is?

844
00:50:36,885 --> 00:50:38,985
He's an architectural LEGEND!

845
00:50:38,985 --> 00:50:40,718
And you cast away that legend's daughter?

846
00:50:40,718 --> 00:50:41,352
You!

847
00:50:41,352 --> 00:50:42,418
Father,

848
00:50:42,418 --> 00:50:45,552
what does it matter who is whose daughter, now?

849
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:47,818
What did you say?!

850
00:50:47,818 --> 00:50:50,052
What good has he done, to act like this?!

851
00:50:50,052 --> 00:50:51,152
Ah, he really...!

852
00:50:51,152 --> 00:50:53,685
Can't we do anything about the Dam Arts Center?

853
00:50:53,685 --> 00:50:56,285
Don't even bring that up anymore.

854
00:50:56,285 --> 00:50:59,518
I tried to look at their website just now and it was down.

855
00:50:59,552 --> 00:51:01,985
There's been a huge backlash from would-be participants.

856
00:51:01,985 --> 00:51:03,352
Wait a few more days...

857
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:04,818
to see the final decision.

858
00:51:05,518 --> 00:51:07,285
But still, take that shirt off.

859
00:51:07,285 --> 00:51:08,651
It really doesn't suit you, hyung.

860
00:51:08,651 --> 00:51:09,951
Ah, you're starting it again.

861
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,818
Ah, take it off, take it off!

862
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,885
I don't want people thinking you and me are a couple.

863
00:51:13,885 --> 00:51:15,185
It really doesn't suit you, hyung.

864
00:51:15,185 --> 00:51:17,185
Hey, you'll spill the coffee!

865
00:51:17,185 --> 00:51:18,318
You spilled the coffee!

866
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:19,785
Then you can take it off.

867
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,018
I'm not taking it off.

868
00:51:21,018 --> 00:51:23,351
- Just take it off! 
- I don't have anything else to wear but this.

869
00:51:23,351 --> 00:51:24,118
Just take it off.

870
00:51:24,118 --> 00:51:27,018
Hey, if you keep doing this, it's going to rip...

871
00:51:28,651 --> 00:51:30,751
Then you can just take it off.

872
00:51:30,751 --> 00:51:32,851
Ah, take it off.

873
00:51:32,851 --> 00:51:34,285
Really, how can you...

874
00:51:35,118 --> 00:51:36,751
Oh, Kae In.

875
00:51:38,518 --> 00:51:39,751
Ah, this is...

876
00:51:39,751 --> 00:51:41,284
It can't be that...

877
00:51:42,351 --> 00:51:43,984
you two are...

878
00:51:43,984 --> 00:51:45,284
No, no, no.

879
00:51:45,284 --> 00:51:46,318
I can explain this.

880
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:48,084
Sang Jun, how could you be like this?

881
00:51:48,084 --> 00:51:51,251
You perfectly know what kind of situation Jin Ho's in right now,

882
00:51:51,251 --> 00:51:53,051
You are Jin Ho's boyfr-

883
00:51:55,918 --> 00:51:58,418
I'm really ashamed of you, Sang Jun.

884
00:51:58,651 --> 00:52:01,351
I wanted you two to trust each other.

885
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:02,951
- How can you... 
- What happened?

886
00:52:03,918 --> 00:52:06,518
Ah, well, Kae In...

887
00:52:06,518 --> 00:52:10,351
had a misunderstanding about the relationship between me and Tae Hoon.

888
00:52:12,184 --> 00:52:13,984
Darling, you know that you're the only one right?

889
00:52:15,651 --> 00:52:17,184
Just because you're in front of Kae In doesn't mean you have to be...

890
00:52:17,184 --> 00:52:19,017
Are you embarrassed?

891
00:52:19,017 --> 00:52:21,184
Please just start dating Tae Hoon.

892
00:52:21,184 --> 00:52:22,051
Is that jealousy I hear?

893
00:52:22,051 --> 00:52:24,884
Get out, get out!

894
00:52:25,817 --> 00:52:30,551
You did well. With those kind of people, you can't let them get away.

895
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:35,551
I've never dated them.

896
00:52:35,551 --> 00:52:36,717
Either of them.

897
00:52:36,717 --> 00:52:37,484
What?

898
00:52:37,484 --> 00:52:40,284
You misunderstood it from the very beginning.

899
00:52:40,284 --> 00:52:41,584
Misunderstood?

900
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:55,684
I'm...

901
00:52:55,684 --> 00:52:56,884
actually not...

902
00:52:56,884 --> 00:52:59,950
About the misunderstanding before,

903
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:01,817
Tae Hoon and I have no relationship at all.

904
00:53:01,817 --> 00:53:04,017
- Hyung just...
- He's a man you know.

905
00:53:06,417 --> 00:53:08,317
Ah, really.

906
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:12,250
I forgot for a moment why I came here.

907
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:14,584
I came from meeting Director Choi,

908
00:53:14,584 --> 00:53:15,950
the Dam Arts Center issue

909
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:19,017
seems as though it will come out fine, 
so I just wanted to tell you not to worry.

910
00:53:19,017 --> 00:53:21,217
That's why I'm here now.

911
00:53:21,217 --> 00:53:23,883
He said he'll fight, and threaten to leave if he loses.

912
00:53:23,883 --> 00:53:25,650
If he goes into the fight making that threat,

913
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:27,850
don't you think he's sure to win?

914
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:29,350
So,

915
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:31,450
don't be so down, Jin Ho.

916
00:53:32,717 --> 00:53:33,983
If that was all you wanted to tell me,

917
00:53:33,983 --> 00:53:35,417
you could have just called me.

918
00:53:35,417 --> 00:53:36,583
Jin Ho,

919
00:53:36,583 --> 00:53:38,050
your smiling face,

920
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:40,750
I wanted to see it with my own eyes.

921
00:53:44,783 --> 00:53:45,983
Yes.

922
00:53:45,983 --> 00:53:47,650
Yes.

923
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:51,083
Park Kae In has not yet returned to the gallery.

924
00:53:51,083 --> 00:53:52,216
Yes.

925
00:53:53,683 --> 00:53:54,916
He's here with me.

926
00:53:54,916 --> 00:53:57,083
Yes, yes.

927
00:54:04,016 --> 00:54:05,616
Ah, it's Park Kae In.

928
00:54:05,616 --> 00:54:08,683
She's coming with Director Jeon.

929
00:54:10,916 --> 00:54:13,083
Are the two in some relationship?

930
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:16,950
It's probably because of me.

931
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:19,083
She knows that he and I don't get along,

932
00:54:19,083 --> 00:54:21,650
so she's doing it to get back at me.

933
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:24,283
It doesn't look like that though.

934
00:54:28,616 --> 00:54:29,816
Chang Ryul!

935
00:54:29,816 --> 00:54:31,616
Hey, Joe!

936
00:54:33,549 --> 00:54:35,049
Wow, how long has it been?

937
00:54:35,049 --> 00:54:37,316
I know. I heard you came back to Korea.

938
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:38,583
You got married right?

939
00:54:38,583 --> 00:54:42,749
Right, your wife is an art gallery curator?

940
00:54:42,783 --> 00:54:45,949
Yeah, that's right... I married.

941
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,783
Wait, how do you know that?

942
00:54:47,783 --> 00:54:51,549
I know Director Choi.

943
00:54:52,449 --> 00:54:56,716
My friend here is planning an exhibition there, 
so we're on the way over there now.

944
00:54:56,716 --> 00:54:57,949
Really?

945
00:54:57,949 --> 00:55:00,049
You know Director Choi?

946
00:55:00,049 --> 00:55:01,449
We both studied abroad, so we knew each other for a brief time...

947
00:55:01,449 --> 00:55:04,316
Anyway, we weren't really the same kind of people,

948
00:55:04,316 --> 00:55:05,882
so we weren't very close.

949
00:55:05,882 --> 00:55:07,282
Not the same kind of people?

950
00:55:07,282 --> 00:55:08,516
What do you mean by that?

951
00:55:09,616 --> 00:55:10,716
Well...

952
00:55:10,716 --> 00:55:13,849
Mr. Choi is... special.

953
00:55:13,849 --> 00:55:14,982
"Special?"

954
00:55:15,915 --> 00:55:18,616
I don't understand.
What's that supposed to mean?

955
00:55:18,616 --> 00:55:20,482
Well, let me ask you something.

956
00:55:20,482 --> 00:55:21,982
Do you know what he likes?

957
00:55:22,649 --> 00:55:24,949
I don't know. You tell me!

958
00:55:25,949 --> 00:55:30,716
If I knew what significance that handkerchief had carried, 
I'd have returned it to you sooner.

959
00:55:30,716 --> 00:55:32,649
I'm very sorry.

960
00:55:33,949 --> 00:55:36,782
You've returned it, so everything's fine.

961
00:55:40,015 --> 00:55:42,582
Park Kae In told me about it.

962
00:55:42,582 --> 00:55:44,615
The Dam Arts Center...

963
00:55:46,315 --> 00:55:49,682
About fighting for the project with the threat of leaving...

964
00:55:49,682 --> 00:55:54,782
I came here to thank you no matter what the results may be.

965
00:55:54,782 --> 00:55:55,849
You know?

966
00:55:56,982 --> 00:55:59,482
When I'm with you, Mr. Jeon,

967
00:55:59,482 --> 00:56:01,682
it's strange, but I feel very happy.

968
00:56:01,682 --> 00:56:04,715
I also feel happy when I meet with you, Director Choi.

969
00:56:05,982 --> 00:56:08,782
Then, do you know that I like you, Mr. Jeon?

970
00:56:09,482 --> 00:56:11,615
I like you, too, Director Choi.

971
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:21,417
Do you really mean that?

972
00:56:21,417 --> 00:56:22,184
Yes.

973
00:56:22,184 --> 00:56:24,417
Because you're very charming.

974
00:56:33,051 --> 00:56:35,851
Come on Joe, just spit it out! 
 What is it?

975
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:37,884
Nevermind, nevermind. 
 Forget about it.

976
00:56:37,884 --> 00:56:39,717
Man, what is your problem?

977
00:56:39,717 --> 00:56:41,151
I was wondering about it anyways.

978
00:56:41,151 --> 00:56:43,551
So you have got to tell me what he likes, okay?

979
00:56:43,551 --> 00:56:44,851
Well...

980
00:56:44,851 --> 00:56:47,350
You will never be able to fulfill his desire.

981
00:56:48,217 --> 00:56:50,750
What Mr. Choi likes is...

982
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:52,850
a man.

983
00:56:57,717 --> 00:56:59,184
I'm sorry, but...

984
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,184
what was it you said just now?

985
00:57:03,284 --> 00:57:05,284
At the Dream Arts Center presentation,

986
00:57:05,784 --> 00:57:08,217
the first time I saw you, Mr. Jeon,

987
00:57:09,117 --> 00:57:10,717
my heart was trembling.

988
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:15,584
And then, that evening...

989
00:57:15,584 --> 00:57:18,250
when I heard about your orientation,

990
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:21,617
I thought we were meant to meet.

991
00:57:24,283 --> 00:57:25,317
Don't tell me...

992
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:28,299
Then...

993
00:57:29,417 --> 00:57:31,150
I told myself...

994
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:33,783
I'd never confess again, but...

995
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:36,583
you've shared my pain,

996
00:57:36,583 --> 00:57:38,417
so I believed that you would understand.

997
00:57:38,417 --> 00:57:39,950
So,

998
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:42,417
this has turned into a confession.

999
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:47,664
For now...

1000
00:57:47,717 --> 00:57:50,083
we don't have to do anything about it.

1001
00:57:50,917 --> 00:57:52,283
Gradually,

1002
00:57:52,283 --> 00:57:54,450
as we get to know each other better over time,

1003
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:56,716
we can figure things out.

1004
00:58:21,682 --> 00:58:22,450
Aigoo...

1005
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:24,383
Look who's here again.

1006
00:58:30,149 --> 00:58:35,649
I thought unqualified people like you were already out of this project.

1007
00:58:35,649 --> 00:58:37,816
But do you still have business left here?

1008
00:58:37,816 --> 00:58:39,949
I'm not in the mood to fight with you right now, so just leave.

1009
00:58:41,649 --> 00:58:42,916
You're not, right?

1010
00:58:42,916 --> 00:58:44,516
You wouldn't be.

1011
00:58:44,516 --> 00:58:51,249
Jeon Jin Ho wouldn't be the kind of guy who would 
pretend to be gay just to take advantage of Director Choi.

1012
00:58:51,249 --> 00:58:54,683
I thought you said you like to fight 
with your bare fists, you little punk.

1013
00:58:54,683 --> 00:58:57,549
Why do you keep hanging around here so annoyingly?

1014
00:59:05,482 --> 00:59:07,616
What is this, now?

1015
00:59:07,616 --> 00:59:09,882
You mean you're acknowledging that I'm right?

1016
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:15,516
I'm really disappointed.

1017
00:59:15,516 --> 00:59:17,616
You disappoint me, Jeon Jin Ho.

1018
00:59:18,816 --> 00:59:22,682
I didn't know you were going to stoop this low 
to pretend to be gay to take advantage of Director Choi.

1019
00:59:22,682 --> 00:59:24,449
I've never taken advantage of Director Choi.

1020
00:59:24,449 --> 00:59:26,716
Then what is it? Are you two dating?

1021
00:59:26,716 --> 00:59:29,516
Why do you keep coming here back and forth? It annoys me.

1022
00:59:38,849 --> 00:59:40,182
Answer me.

1023
00:59:40,182 --> 00:59:42,482
Just say it, you came here to use Director Choi.

1024
00:59:42,482 --> 00:59:43,749
If not,

1025
00:59:43,749 --> 00:59:46,515
are you saying that you're really gay?

1026
00:59:54,649 --> 00:59:56,015
Answer me.

1027
01:00:03,831 --> 01:00:05,080
That's right.

1028
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:11,948
I...

1029
01:00:16,015 --> 01:00:17,315
I am gay.

1030
01:00:35,648 --> 01:00:36,531
What?

1031
01:00:37,082 --> 01:00:38,615
Is that so?

1032
01:00:39,015 --> 01:00:42,715
So you weren't really a man?

1033
01:00:42,748 --> 01:00:44,781
What are you going to do, huh?

1034
01:00:44,781 --> 01:00:45,981
If your father knew about this,

1035
01:00:45,981 --> 01:00:48,981
wouldn't he turn over in his grave?

1036
01:00:48,981 --> 01:00:50,448
His only son can't even be a man.

1037
01:00:50,448 --> 01:00:52,481
The one who has to carry on his father's name.

1038
01:00:53,515 --> 01:00:54,215
No... But then...

1039
01:00:54,215 --> 01:00:56,615
How long has this been going on?

1040
01:00:56,615 --> 01:00:58,615
You should have told me so.

1041
01:00:58,615 --> 01:01:01,548
Then I would have pitied you.

1042
01:01:01,548 --> 01:01:03,681
Then I would have given you what you needed and wanted...

1043
01:01:03,681 --> 01:01:05,030
Stop it!

1044
01:01:06,181 --> 01:01:08,448
What gives you the right to laugh at him?

1045
01:01:08,448 --> 01:01:09,554
Kae In...

1046
01:01:09,554 --> 01:01:12,181
Just what have you done that gives you 
any right to laugh at him?

1047
01:01:12,181 --> 01:01:15,081
It's not like Jin Ho wanted to be born this way.

1048
01:01:15,081 --> 01:01:16,381
Stop it.

1049
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:18,681
So if a man loves a woman it's love,

1050
01:01:18,681 --> 01:01:21,481
but if a man loves another man it's not love?

1051
01:01:21,548 --> 01:01:23,681
So are you a real man?

1052
01:01:23,714 --> 01:01:25,948
Is it because you're a real man that you tore my heart out?

1053
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:27,714
I said stop it!!!

1054
01:01:30,781 --> 01:01:31,941
Jin Ho.

1055
01:01:31,941 --> 01:01:33,381
Kae In,

1056
01:01:33,414 --> 01:01:34,748
why in the world are you being like this?

1057
01:01:34,748 --> 01:01:35,981
Let go of me!

1058
01:01:42,081 --> 01:01:43,314
Jin Ho.

1059
01:01:45,181 --> 01:01:46,151
Please talk to me.

1060
01:01:46,151 --> 01:01:47,414
Talk about what?

1061
01:01:49,847 --> 01:01:51,147
I don't have anything more to say.

1062
01:01:58,347 --> 01:01:59,347
Move.

1063
01:01:59,347 --> 01:02:00,914
Park Kae In.

1064
01:02:00,914 --> 01:02:03,547
What is the deal with you and that guy?

1065
01:02:03,547 --> 01:02:06,181
Why are you always defending that disgusting guy?

1066
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:08,681
Are you in a relationship with a gay man now or what?

1067
01:02:10,947 --> 01:02:12,508
Disgusting?

1068
01:02:12,508 --> 01:02:13,947
What's disgusting?

1069
01:02:13,947 --> 01:02:16,181
Why is Jin Ho disgusting?

1070
01:02:16,181 --> 01:02:20,514
Whether it's a man or woman, loving someone is still love.

1071
01:02:20,514 --> 01:02:23,614
You're a person who's never really loved anyone.

1072
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:25,480
So who are you...

1073
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,214
to be calling Jin Ho disgusting?

1074
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:31,280
Kae In, what's wrong with you?

1075
01:02:32,214 --> 01:02:34,980
Even when I broke up with you, you weren't like this.

1076
01:02:35,747 --> 01:02:37,514
Even on the day of the wedding,

1077
01:02:37,514 --> 01:02:40,114
you've never hit me before.

1078
01:02:40,114 --> 01:02:41,580
What are you doing right now?

1079
01:02:42,314 --> 01:02:43,380
That's right.

1080
01:02:44,614 --> 01:02:46,580
I was like that before.

1081
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:47,914
Even through all those things, I couldn't say a word.

1082
01:02:47,914 --> 01:02:51,014
I was a fool who couldn't do anything.

1083
01:02:51,014 --> 01:02:53,313
But not anymore.

1084
01:02:53,313 --> 01:02:55,147
Jin Ho must've changed me.
