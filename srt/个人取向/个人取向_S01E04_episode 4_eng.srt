1
00:00:01,896 --> 00:00:03,793
Episode 4

2
00:00:03,793 --> 00:00:07,424
Oh, Ji-Jin Ho... Oh, it hurts...

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,373
Oh, Jin Ho... It hurts...

4
00:00:10,373 --> 00:00:12,212
Please be more gentle.

5
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:16,044
Jin Ho... Yes... Like that...

6
00:00:16,044 --> 00:00:18,621
A little bit higher.

7
00:00:22,491 --> 00:00:25,091
I don't think I can continue because you're so loud.

8
00:00:26,337 --> 00:00:28,922
It's getting late. Hurry up and go to bed.

9
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:35,078
Can't you do it a little longer? It was refreshing.

10
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:37,530
I'm a renter, not your damned servant!

11
00:00:38,868 --> 00:00:44,583
Anyways... Thanks. I love having a gay for a roommate! This is so great!

12
00:00:51,347 --> 00:00:53,330
My God, I'm going crazy.

13
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,364
Humiliating me like that in front of Director Choi...!

14
00:00:58,115 --> 00:01:00,335
I shouldn't let this distract me...

15
00:01:01,516 --> 00:01:03,104
I shouldn't let this distract me...

16
00:01:17,382 --> 00:01:21,494
W-Why am I here?

17
00:01:23,002 --> 00:01:28,573
 That's not it! This man is gay! 

18
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,494
This man is not going to let this be.

19
00:01:39,275 --> 00:01:40,663
Ow... my stomach...

20
00:01:41,297 --> 00:01:42,965
My stomach...

21
00:01:42,965 --> 00:01:45,367
Ow...my stomach hurts...

22
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,838
Don't come to the office, 
come to the construction site directly, all right?

23
00:01:50,472 --> 00:01:52,457
I'll be going there, too.

24
00:01:59,348 --> 00:02:01,513
She was sleeping on the sofa before...

25
00:02:03,463 --> 00:02:05,052
Look here.

26
00:02:07,223 --> 00:02:08,583
Park Kae In!

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,128
Go sleep in your bedroom. 
You'll get a twisted mouth sleeping there.

28
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:18,967
Her sleeping habits are so bizarre.

29
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:41,393
Did I just drink alcohol last night?

30
00:02:44,026 --> 00:02:46,095
Did you sleep well?

31
00:02:46,495 --> 00:02:47,858
Yes.

32
00:02:47,858 --> 00:02:49,331
How about you?

33
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,501
Don't you have anything to say to me?

34
00:02:53,101 --> 00:02:54,537
Something to say to you?

35
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:56,105
I can't really think of anything...

36
00:02:56,105 --> 00:02:59,174
Wha.... Did I do something wrong last night?

37
00:02:59,174 --> 00:03:03,876
I'm like... when I drink, I completely lose recall of what I did when I was drunk.

38
00:03:03,876 --> 00:03:06,815
Still... I'm sure I didn't do anyone any harm...

39
00:03:06,815 --> 00:03:08,684
You didn't do any harm, you say?

40
00:03:10,384 --> 00:03:14,323
My stomach... You'll have to excuse me. 
My stomach really hurts...

41
00:03:14,323 --> 00:03:16,579
Goodbye.

42
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:26,769
What was I thinking? I called him gay 
in front of so many people...

43
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:29,738
Me and my stupid mouth... my mouth...

44
00:03:31,805 --> 00:03:33,142
My stomach hurts...

45
00:03:33,142 --> 00:03:37,312
If you go straight this way, 
there will be a multi IT complex.

46
00:03:38,213 --> 00:03:40,482
Here to the east, there will be a gallery.

47
00:03:40,482 --> 00:03:42,584
To the west, a theme park.

48
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:53,362
If the Dam Arts Center is built, there will be a range of artists' studio buildings around here.

49
00:03:53,362 --> 00:03:54,797
So...

50
00:03:54,797 --> 00:03:57,066
To the other side, there will be public offices.

51
00:03:57,066 --> 00:03:59,168
And separate buildings.

52
00:03:59,168 --> 00:04:00,669
Outdoor showrooms.

53
00:04:01,203 --> 00:04:02,503
Parking lot over there.

54
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:03,639
Other facilities such as dining over there.

55
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:08,410
The essential thing is to make a 
powerful impression on Director Choi.

56
00:04:08,843 --> 00:04:12,313
 This man here is gay! 

57
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,021
I'm sure he's already gained a powerful impression of me.

58
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:21,232
What?

59
00:04:21,758 --> 00:04:22,891
Nothing.

60
00:04:25,461 --> 00:04:27,129
Hey.

61
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:30,466
From what I saw last time, 
it looks like that woman's interested in you.

62
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:31,767
How can you possibly think that?

63
00:04:32,468 --> 00:04:34,870
How can a man be interested in another man?

64
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,472
What are you talking about?

65
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:39,441
Now, you're really thinking of Park Kae In as a man?

66
00:04:45,214 --> 00:04:47,683
Coming all the way here!

67
00:04:47,683 --> 00:04:49,918
You're really going to do it?

68
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:50,953
Then...

69
00:04:50,953 --> 00:04:52,687
Have a look around, please.

70
00:04:52,687 --> 00:04:56,691
Wouldn't it be better if you 
didn't follow your father's footsteps?

71
00:04:56,691 --> 00:04:58,860
You...

72
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,197
think what happened to your father was all my fault?

73
00:05:02,197 --> 00:05:03,866
Maybe you think that way but...

74
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:06,301
Your father...

75
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:09,437
He destroyed himself.

76
00:05:09,437 --> 00:05:11,807
Business is like that.

77
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,043
If one goes too far beyond one's abilities,

78
00:05:14,043 --> 00:05:16,411
then the result is a sure thing.

79
00:05:17,513 --> 00:05:18,847
No.

80
00:05:20,216 --> 00:05:24,887
Trusting one's subordinate as a partner when that person was just looking for chances to betray him,

81
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:26,555
that is what brought such results.

82
00:05:26,555 --> 00:05:29,959
Someone who dwells in the past

83
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:32,861
cannot devise great projects.

84
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:37,499
So I suggest you try looking for 
a project that fits your capacity better.

85
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,834
I understand.

86
00:05:55,552 --> 00:05:58,654
There are some really good fakes 
around nowadays, aren't there?

87
00:05:58,654 --> 00:06:01,824
Too true.  Every Tom, Dick 
and Harry can own luxury goods.

88
00:06:04,794 --> 00:06:07,262
You should be careful.

89
00:06:07,262 --> 00:06:08,897
But who are you?

90
00:06:08,897 --> 00:06:10,666
I don't think I've seen you before, have I?

91
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,035
I've come to see Director Jeon Jin Ho.

92
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:15,103
You must be working here?

93
00:06:16,205 --> 00:06:19,007
Me?  I'm his fiancée, I'll have you know.

94
00:06:19,007 --> 00:06:21,076
Fiancée?

95
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:23,311
Director Jeon Jin Ho?

96
00:06:23,311 --> 00:06:25,113
Been kept in the dark, have you?

97
00:06:39,327 --> 00:06:41,063
Ah, oppa!

98
00:06:41,063 --> 00:06:42,998
Hey! Hye Mi, you're here!

99
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:45,701
Hello.

100
00:06:45,701 --> 00:06:46,802
Hello.

101
00:06:46,802 --> 00:06:48,470
What brings you here?

102
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,508
You've come to our humble office...

103
00:06:55,378 --> 00:06:57,279
Oppaaa!

104
00:06:58,715 --> 00:07:00,815
Do you think this place is a playground?

105
00:07:01,951 --> 00:07:05,754
I came because mother said you left your vitamins so...

106
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,226
If your fiancée doesn't take care of you, who else will?

107
00:07:12,461 --> 00:07:14,863
Please come in.

108
00:07:14,863 --> 00:07:16,431
Yes, please go in.

109
00:07:21,304 --> 00:07:23,105
Please sit here.

110
00:07:28,845 --> 00:07:31,380
But... what brings you here?

111
00:07:36,516 --> 00:07:40,889
This is an invitation to the Architects Evening 
we at the MS group are sponsoring.

112
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:42,424
If you come this evening,

113
00:07:42,424 --> 00:07:45,327
you'll get a chance to meet many people
 connected with the Dam Arts Center.

114
00:07:45,327 --> 00:07:47,829
Ah, thank you.

115
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:51,200
You could have sent it by mail 
but you came with it personally.

116
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,036
You were in trouble because of me last time.

117
00:07:54,036 --> 00:07:56,204
I came as a way of saying thanks and all.

118
00:07:56,204 --> 00:07:58,106
You don't have to worry about it.

119
00:08:01,878 --> 00:08:03,378
Please, take it.

120
00:08:05,715 --> 00:08:07,182
 

121
00:08:09,684 --> 00:08:12,187
It's a call I don't need to take.

122
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,557
You're calling her again?

123
00:08:18,194 --> 00:08:20,595
 Your call could not be connected. 
Please call again later or... 

124
00:08:20,595 --> 00:08:23,966
Hey... So I told you to make a phone call before coming.

125
00:08:23,966 --> 00:08:27,636
Then what do you want me to do?  
She never answers my calls.

126
00:08:30,473 --> 00:08:33,742
Still we came here. We could wait and meet her.

127
00:08:33,742 --> 00:08:36,977
Kim In Hee is Director Choi's right hand, isn't she?

128
00:08:40,483 --> 00:08:43,452
There was no need to see me all the way out.

129
00:08:43,452 --> 00:08:45,454
How is your schedule this afternoon?

130
00:08:45,454 --> 00:08:48,821
Our Dam Art Gallery has just acquired some new paintings.

131
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:50,392
Wouldn't you like to have a look?

132
00:08:51,727 --> 00:08:54,964
Our chairman has no appointments this afternoon.

133
00:08:54,964 --> 00:08:59,434
And it's a habit of his to look around the 
art gallery when he has no appointments.

134
00:09:09,145 --> 00:09:11,880
He was just showing her out, where did he go?

135
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,915
Huh, Jin Ho's car isn't here.

136
00:09:13,915 --> 00:09:16,384
He surely hasn't gone off with that woman, has he?

137
00:09:16,384 --> 00:09:17,853
Well, I wouldn't know.

138
00:09:19,221 --> 00:09:22,190
Hey, I thought you wanted to go on a date with me?

139
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,227
Hurry up and find out where Jin Ho is living, 
like I already told you to!

140
00:09:28,631 --> 00:09:31,934
How are you finding... Sang Go Jae?

141
00:09:31,934 --> 00:09:33,302
Eh?

142
00:09:33,302 --> 00:09:35,804
Isn't it uncomfortable for you staying at Sang Go Jae?

143
00:09:35,804 --> 00:09:37,706
It's not uncomfortable for me.

144
00:09:38,774 --> 00:09:41,009
Living under the same roof with Kae In...

145
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:43,511
It doesn't seem to bother you at all.

146
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:45,514
Besides... How should I thank you?

147
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:51,853
You gave me such important information. 
I don't feel that I should just take it for nothing.

148
00:09:52,587 --> 00:09:54,223
Then treat me to a nice meal some day.

149
00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:56,489
I shall do that.

150
00:10:09,371 --> 00:10:13,542
That is... In Hee getting Director Jeon Jin Ho's phone number, right?

151
00:10:13,976 --> 00:10:17,679
He knows very well the relationship 
between you and Ms. Kim In Hee.

152
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,315
Is... Is that allowed?

153
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:22,484
Please, give me a call anytime.

154
00:10:22,484 --> 00:10:27,889
If you succeed in getting this Dam Arts Center project, 
you know that one meal's not going to be enough, right?

155
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:29,857
Of course.

156
00:10:29,857 --> 00:10:31,326
I'll be going.

157
00:10:39,134 --> 00:10:42,104
I want to find out what Jeon Jin Ho is doing...

158
00:10:42,104 --> 00:10:46,332
I want to find out what Jeon Jin Ho is doing nowadays.

159
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:11,153
Chairman, you may have gotten the 
wrong impression about me from last night.

160
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:13,365
That's not the way my inclinations lie.

161
00:11:16,338 --> 00:11:19,508
Yesterday's situation was a misunderstanding.

162
00:11:19,508 --> 00:11:21,710
I'm not into men.

163
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,804
I am not gay.

164
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,624
Hey!

165
00:11:35,624 --> 00:11:38,594
- Oh, hey. 
- Take this off me.

166
00:11:38,594 --> 00:11:39,495
What is it then?

167
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:40,629
Oysters!

168
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:43,264
Mom sent me some so I brought a few over.

169
00:11:43,264 --> 00:11:47,719
Wow! It looks so good! They're very fresh.

170
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:53,409
You know those items the department store sent back? I've put them in my online store. I'll let you know if any orders come in.

171
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:56,391
What a girl!  What would I do without you?

172
00:11:56,391 --> 00:11:57,991
Right enough!

173
00:11:57,991 --> 00:11:59,591
What were you doing?

174
00:11:59,591 --> 00:12:04,691
I'm writing a resumé. 
I signed up on an Internet recruitment site and I have to go for an interview.

175
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,591
I thought you said you'd never go work for a company?

176
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:09,591
What else can I do?  I need money to live on right now.

177
00:12:09,591 --> 00:12:11,994
What about Won Ho?  Did you give up on his debt?

178
00:12:11,994 --> 00:12:14,691
Right now... that's not the problem...

179
00:12:14,697 --> 00:12:17,999
Why? Did you get into trouble again?

180
00:12:33,415 --> 00:12:36,918
What brings you here at this time?

181
00:12:36,918 --> 00:12:38,820
Hello.

182
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:45,327
I thought... if I'm to design the future Dam Arts Center,

183
00:12:45,327 --> 00:12:49,330
I should start by knowing what sort of paintings the gallery currently has.

184
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,769
Is today a coincidence as well?

185
00:12:55,364 --> 00:12:57,973
The first time, you damaged my car.

186
00:12:57,973 --> 00:13:01,944
This encounter seems well-planned 
rather than a further coincidence.

187
00:13:01,944 --> 00:13:04,880
Please put it down to a young man's keenness.

188
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,115
It's a fine thing... being young.

189
00:13:07,115 --> 00:13:09,351
It allows you to be reckless, doesn't it?

190
00:13:09,351 --> 00:13:14,058
By the way, whoever your friend was, 
she seems to be a kindred spirit.

191
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:17,125
I got the impression that you have a girlfriend who's great fun to be with.

192
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,929
It seems like there's a misunderstanding about yesterday...

193
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:25,333
As far as I'm concerned, I don't really care about other people's personal preferences, so don't worry.

194
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,504
Just please focus on drawing up your design proposals.

195
00:13:28,504 --> 00:13:32,541
Then, let's continue meeting coincidentally like this.

196
00:13:34,543 --> 00:13:36,009
Before I go...

197
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:39,514
What are your views on Kandinsky?

198
00:13:39,514 --> 00:13:42,771
I'm referring to the painting that's 
hanging back there in the lobby.

199
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:47,764
I think a Kandinsky might suit that spot better than a Klimt.

200
00:13:47,764 --> 00:13:50,424
It's not a bad idea.

201
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:56,031
I'll see you at our next supposedly coincidental meeting.

202
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:06,691
You really don't learn, do you?  
How could you really not keep your promise again?

203
00:14:06,691 --> 00:14:10,891
You said it again? Inside a restaurant? 
In front of all those people?

204
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,591
Every time I drink I...

205
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:16,718
You don't think he'll let this one slide this time?

206
00:14:16,718 --> 00:14:19,191
This is serious.

207
00:14:20,491 --> 00:14:21,591
This won't do.

208
00:14:21,591 --> 00:14:23,391
Follow me.

209
00:14:23,391 --> 00:14:24,760
Where are we going?

210
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,796
- Get up! 
- I don't want to go.

211
00:14:26,796 --> 00:14:35,404
Whenever my husband's on a stakeout, 
I tell him I've made a feast of a dinner. 
That always brings him home in a flash!

212
00:14:35,404 --> 00:14:39,074
A feast of a dinner? So what happens after that? Come on, tell me!

213
00:14:39,074 --> 00:14:41,077
What do you think?

214
00:14:41,077 --> 00:14:44,613
He says he's eaten too much and goes right out again.

215
00:14:44,613 --> 00:14:48,517
So supposing Jin Ho enjoys the meal 
then leaves anyway, what do I do?

216
00:14:48,517 --> 00:14:51,854
Hey, why should Jin Ho act like my husband?

217
00:14:51,854 --> 00:14:55,256
At first, you feed him to get him into the right mood,

218
00:14:55,256 --> 00:14:57,592
then you try a bit of flirting.

219
00:14:57,592 --> 00:15:03,498
Women are like a lump of stone to him. 
What good would flirting do?

220
00:15:06,802 --> 00:15:11,140
I must admit, if I were a man, 
you'd look like a lump of stone to me, too.

221
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,942
Do you wanna die?

222
00:15:12,942 --> 00:15:14,710
For now, let's just focus on giving him a good feed.

223
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:19,681
Just forget it. I can't cook, and 
I couldn't cater to his finicky tastes!

224
00:15:19,681 --> 00:15:22,651
When I get the money, I'll just kick him out!

225
00:15:22,651 --> 00:15:26,121
Why do you keep thinking of throwing him out?

226
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:29,758
You should think of ways to soften him up.

227
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:32,691
Welcome back.

228
00:15:32,691 --> 00:15:34,391
Hello.

229
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,891
Yes, In Hee?

230
00:15:38,891 --> 00:15:41,091
Aah...

231
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:43,291
Yes.

232
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,791
Alright.

233
00:15:46,191 --> 00:15:48,391
Of course.

234
00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:52,080
Thank you for contacting me.

235
00:15:53,816 --> 00:15:55,818
You did it again?

236
00:15:55,818 --> 00:15:57,319
What are you talking about?

237
00:15:57,319 --> 00:15:58,921
You've brought Kim In Hee over to our side, haven't you?

238
00:15:58,921 --> 00:16:01,857
What do you mean? What am I? 
Some spy from North Korea?

239
00:16:01,857 --> 00:16:06,562
She's calling you at this hour.  
She must have defected to you. What's going on?

240
00:16:06,562 --> 00:16:07,663
Did she give you any important information?

241
00:16:07,663 --> 00:16:10,499
Director Choi wants to have dinner tomorrow night.

242
00:16:10,499 --> 00:16:12,501
Oh ! Bravo.

243
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:14,491
Oh! Bravo, Jeon Jin Ho!

244
00:16:14,491 --> 00:16:15,338
Oh! Bravo, Jun Jin Ho! 
 Oh!

245
00:16:15,338 --> 00:16:18,874
What did I do in my past life to 
deserve a brilliant boss like you?

246
00:16:18,874 --> 00:16:20,176
Ooh, bravo!

247
00:16:20,176 --> 00:16:25,514
You may be a blabbermouth, 
but you're the best friend anyone could wish for.

248
00:16:25,514 --> 00:16:32,822
Isn't that the great thing about having a gay friend?  
You can talk about your boyfriends with them and still not feel weird.

249
00:16:32,822 --> 00:16:38,826
First feed him food and watch a movie together.

250
00:16:38,826 --> 00:16:41,430
Like this one, for instance.

251
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:48,337
This would be the manual for living with a gay roommate.

252
00:16:48,337 --> 00:16:52,541
In fact if you consider, this is good for both your sides.

253
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:54,410
What does that mean?

254
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,980
You felt betrayed because you lived with 
In Hee and she betrayed you like that.

255
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,285
That empty heart, you can help it heal with Jin Ho.

256
00:17:03,285 --> 00:17:05,087
Is that too hard?

257
00:17:05,087 --> 00:17:10,025
In that case... imagine that Jin Ho is me.

258
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:13,495
That's not hard, right?

259
00:17:21,737 --> 00:17:26,342
If I should build a friendship with Jin Ho, 
then I should help him too, right?

260
00:17:26,342 --> 00:17:33,149
It must be so difficult for him to stay a gay and keep it a secret. I, as his roommate, should understand his loneliness.

261
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:36,751
  Gay boyfriend 

262
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:39,955
You know what's the #1 Christmas wish 
of  female college students?

263
00:17:39,955 --> 00:17:41,890
How should I know that?

264
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,361
Clothes, maybe. Or perhaps... a boyfriend?

265
00:17:45,361 --> 00:17:50,866
Bingo. It's a boyfriend they want. 
But above all, they want a gay boyfriend.

266
00:17:50,866 --> 00:17:51,901
Where does it say that?

267
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:55,938
Hey... you really think girls would want 
a gay boyfriend for Christmas?

268
00:17:55,938 --> 00:18:03,579
"The reasons why girls want a gay boyfriend. They can go shopping together, they understand women, and it's easy to have proper conversations with them."

269
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:07,750
I suppose if you're dating, advice from the 
opposite sex would come in useful.

270
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,785
That's right.

271
00:18:09,785 --> 00:18:12,989
I thought you were leaving. Aren't you going?

272
00:18:13,956 --> 00:18:16,092
O-Oh... yeah. I should be going.

273
00:18:16,092 --> 00:18:18,194
Are you interested in this too?

274
00:18:18,194 --> 00:18:20,196
No.

275
00:18:20,196 --> 00:18:23,031
Please, take care of this.

276
00:18:38,681 --> 00:18:41,082
Jin Ho hyung... I'm sorry.

277
00:18:41,082 --> 00:18:44,319
You know that there's nobody in 
this world you can trust, right?

278
00:18:46,991 --> 00:18:53,691
How come you've turned out so beautiful, Hye Mi? 
You were once this little girl, and now you're a grown woman.

279
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:57,591
But I still don't understand why Jin Ho thinks of me as a little girl.

280
00:18:57,591 --> 00:19:04,391
It's just because Jin Ho isn't all that interested in women. 
It's not because you're not beautiful.

281
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:07,643
He saw his father die in unfortunate circumstances.

282
00:19:07,643 --> 00:19:17,353
He was studying so hard in school and crazy to 
succeed so he had no time to date women.

283
00:19:17,353 --> 00:19:22,357
But he pays me so little attention... It makes me mad.

284
00:19:22,357 --> 00:19:25,761
That's what all the men in this family are like.

285
00:19:25,761 --> 00:19:27,997
The same thing happened to me.

286
00:19:27,997 --> 00:19:32,034
I chased after Jin Ho's father from my time in high school.

287
00:19:32,091 --> 00:19:33,191
Really?

288
00:19:33,191 --> 00:19:42,091
If you wait for him a bit, he will come to realize
 "there is only Hye Mi that's right for me!"

289
00:19:42,111 --> 00:19:46,415
Anyways, where could he be staying?

290
00:19:46,415 --> 00:19:50,653
I'm really curious if he's eating well. I'm dying of curiosity.

291
00:19:50,853 --> 00:19:55,191
Don't worry, mother. I'll find out where
 he's staying soon and take you there.

292
00:20:09,305 --> 00:20:12,274
 The reasons why girls want a gay boyfriend. 

293
00:20:12,274 --> 00:20:15,544
 They can go shopping together, 
they understand women, 

294
00:20:15,544 --> 00:20:17,046
 and it's easy to have proper conversations with them. 

295
00:20:17,046 --> 00:20:22,451
Even if I really was gay, I couldn't do 
those things with that woman Park Kae In.

296
00:20:22,451 --> 00:20:26,422
Today's menu is... oyster gratin.

297
00:20:26,422 --> 00:20:29,892
I have no confidence. I've never used an oven before.

298
00:20:29,892 --> 00:20:31,560
My dear friend, can't you do it for me before you go?

299
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,028
You are such a nuisance.

300
00:20:33,028 --> 00:20:36,465
You're not a friend, just a nuisance.

301
00:20:36,465 --> 00:20:40,603
No! If you, Jin Ho and I, we three eat together, it's great, right?

302
00:20:40,603 --> 00:20:44,173
Not me... I've got my kid to look after... I can't.

303
00:20:44,173 --> 00:20:48,511
Oh no!  What do I do? What do I do? 
 I bet he still won't have forgiven me!

304
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,379
Calm down! Calm down!

305
00:20:56,018 --> 00:21:00,623
The first character reads 'Sang', the second is... what?

306
00:21:00,623 --> 00:21:08,397
The last one is  'Jae'... Sang something Jae... Mmm...

307
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:11,204
Sang Go Jae?

308
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:17,472
It was right in front of my nose... That's right. It's Sang Go Jae.

309
00:21:21,343 --> 00:21:24,446
Jin Ho, you're home already?

310
00:21:24,446 --> 00:21:26,785
Gosh, are you two still speaking so formally?

311
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,419
You're almost the same age, 
so why don't you speak in a relaxed way?

312
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:31,546
Why don't you speak in a more relaxed way?

313
00:21:31,546 --> 00:21:33,322
Informal.

314
00:21:33,322 --> 00:21:34,689
Informal... Right.

315
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,755
Jin Ho, you're hungry, right?

316
00:21:39,996 --> 00:21:42,621
Do you want me to cook something delicious for you?

317
00:21:43,566 --> 00:21:45,686
Would you like that?

318
00:21:45,686 --> 00:21:52,965
Seeing how you're sharing the same house, 
wouldn't it be best to speak in a friendly way to each other?

319
00:21:54,076 --> 00:21:55,944
Would you like to have a cup of tea?

320
00:21:55,944 --> 00:21:59,180
I'll adopt informal speech if and when the right time comes.

321
00:22:00,382 --> 00:22:04,719
Wow... You don't look it but you must be shy.

322
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:07,889
*yo (polite speech)?

323
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:12,086
So... If you'll excuse me...

324
00:22:16,365 --> 00:22:18,266
What should I do?

325
00:22:18,266 --> 00:22:19,533
Huh?

326
00:22:20,184 --> 00:22:22,337
I really must go because of Joon Hyuk.

327
00:22:22,337 --> 00:22:25,239
Hey! How can you be leaving me like this? 
You know I don't know how to cook anything!

328
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:26,541
Why are you being like this?

329
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,143
I'm a mom.

330
00:22:28,143 --> 00:22:31,126
I have a hungry child to feed. Just cook whatever.

331
00:22:31,126 --> 00:22:32,314
What? You're really leaving?

332
00:22:32,314 --> 00:22:34,269
Hey! Really? Really? Hey. Hey!

333
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,001
Fighting!

334
00:22:35,001 --> 00:22:37,752
Hey. Hey! Hey! Hey!

335
00:22:37,752 --> 00:22:39,020
I'm leaving...

336
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,310
You meanie!

337
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,869
Can we talk for a bit?

338
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,205
Huh?

339
00:23:00,075 --> 00:23:04,697
So... You're saying you don't remember 
a single thing about last night?

340
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,292
No...

341
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:11,228
What can I do about the fact that 
I get drunk and have no recollection whatsoever...

342
00:23:11,228 --> 00:23:15,024
Then you don't remember that 
I had to pay for your short ribs last night?

343
00:23:15,024 --> 00:23:15,991
Oh, my!

344
00:23:15,991 --> 00:23:18,060
Did I really put such heavy burden on you?

345
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,015
I'll definitely pay back your money.

346
00:23:21,015 --> 00:23:23,698
And have you forgotten as well that to move in here,
 I handed over 10 bills of 100,000 won in cash,

347
00:23:23,698 --> 00:23:25,883
and deposited a million won in your bank account?

348
00:23:25,883 --> 00:23:28,035
Of course not... One million won...?

349
00:23:30,505 --> 00:23:33,542
When did I ever borrow money from you?

350
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:36,740
Wow! Wow, you're such a cheater!

351
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,315
When have I ever borrowed money from you?
 And a  huge amount like one million won?!

352
00:23:40,315 --> 00:23:44,106
Maybe the drink left holes in your memory?

353
00:23:46,253 --> 00:23:50,892
I can forgive everything else, but I cannot forgive lies.

354
00:23:50,892 --> 00:23:57,477
Look... I'm sorry. I'll never do it again. I'm sorry 
 Undertaking 

355
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:03,305
If I, Park Kae In, should ever again even once 
publicly divulge the personal tastes of Jeon Jin Ho,

356
00:24:03,305 --> 00:24:08,191
.. pu-bli-cly di-vulge...

357
00:24:08,543 --> 00:24:10,811
What's next?

358
00:24:10,811 --> 00:24:12,614
You write whatever you think to be right.

359
00:24:12,614 --> 00:24:14,061
What will you do?

360
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:15,641
I will bite my tongue and die!

361
00:24:15,641 --> 00:24:19,798
So what if you do bite your tongue and die? 
What good would that do me?

362
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:28,091
If I, Park Kae In, should ever again even once 
publicly divulge the personal tastes of Jeon Jin Ho, 
I shall do without reservation whatever he demands of me.

363
00:24:29,725 --> 00:24:31,599
Is that good enough?

364
00:24:45,947 --> 00:24:47,850
Do you have any objections?

365
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,751
This should cover it right?

366
00:24:49,751 --> 00:24:51,876
For now.

367
00:24:52,346 --> 00:24:55,157
Then wait a bit, I'll make dinner.

368
00:24:55,157 --> 00:24:58,226
It's to compensate for the short ribs.

369
00:25:00,895 --> 00:25:06,762

370
00:26:01,656 --> 00:26:05,410
They are all burnt! Oh no...

371
00:26:41,163 --> 00:26:45,400
I spent hours making this for a certain person's benefit...

372
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,036
My God! It hurts... I think my finger was burned.

373
00:26:48,036 --> 00:26:52,774
Here, it was bleeding so much because of the knife...

374
00:27:02,417 --> 00:27:03,485
How is it?

375
00:27:04,286 --> 00:27:07,822
Well... it's fit for human consumption.

376
00:27:13,662 --> 00:27:16,130
Are you going to have some?

377
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,867
No! It's alright! I already ate a whole lot 
of them while I was cooking.

378
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:21,169
In that case...

379
00:27:25,673 --> 00:27:27,675
Is it tasty?

380
00:27:28,076 --> 00:27:31,546
But you said you just ate some, 
so you must know how they taste?

381
00:27:37,386 --> 00:27:41,356
Please... eat your fill!

382
00:27:42,357 --> 00:27:46,261
I've always thought that good food is something that
 should be shared and bring people closer together...

383
00:27:47,262 --> 00:27:52,066
I haven't the slightest possible wish to get closer to you.

384
00:27:56,438 --> 00:27:59,173
It was nice. Thanks.

385
00:27:59,173 --> 00:28:00,676
Jeon Jin Ho.

386
00:28:00,676 --> 00:28:03,244
Let's try and get along.

387
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,283
You just need to watch yourself, then we'll be fine.

388
00:28:30,205 --> 00:28:31,906
Oh... Jin Ho...

389
00:28:31,906 --> 00:28:35,177
We had dinner together. 
Do you want to watch a movie together?

390
00:28:35,177 --> 00:28:38,460
I don't have the time.

391
00:28:42,918 --> 00:28:45,387
Who'd have thought that, after all the trouble 
I went over to make that food?

392
00:28:45,387 --> 00:28:49,724
I did it TWICE! 
He's so heartless...

393
00:29:50,552 --> 00:29:52,787
Why are you being so childish?

394
00:29:52,787 --> 00:29:56,190
I am a childish person, didn't you know?

395
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,260
Is that something to be proud about?

396
00:29:59,094 --> 00:30:00,571
What about you?

397
00:30:00,571 --> 00:30:03,698
Since when were you so close to Jin Ho 
that you're riding in the same car with him?

398
00:30:03,698 --> 00:30:06,033
You got his number and you were just loving it, weren't you?

399
00:30:06,033 --> 00:30:08,103
Are you having me watched?

400
00:30:08,103 --> 00:30:11,306
I was in the art gallery earlier and I saw it, all right?

401
00:30:11,306 --> 00:30:14,242
It's over between us, so don't butt in.

402
00:30:14,242 --> 00:30:16,811
Hey! You...!

403
00:30:17,712 --> 00:30:19,381
Is it all over if you're the only one who says it's over?

404
00:30:19,381 --> 00:30:20,649
Yes, it is for me.

405
00:30:20,649 --> 00:30:23,890
Look at you. Didn't you end your relationship 
with Kae In without considering her?

406
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,029
And just who made me do that, then?

407
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:30,917
You're putting all the blame on me, now?

408
00:30:30,917 --> 00:30:32,794
That is so like you, Han Chang Ryul.

409
00:30:32,794 --> 00:30:35,831
You may be finished with our relationship, but I'm not, not yet.

410
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:41,303
So I think that gives me the right to ask 
why you were riding in Jin Ho's car.

411
00:30:41,303 --> 00:30:44,072
Since you're curious, I'll give you a straight answer.

412
00:30:44,072 --> 00:30:47,809
I'll meet Jeon Jin Ho whenever I feel like it.

413
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:49,978
Is that enough for you?

414
00:30:52,581 --> 00:30:53,849
You can't with Jin Ho!

415
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:55,150
I can't?

416
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,217
So why not?

417
00:30:56,217 --> 00:30:59,654
You saying I can't just makes me more determined.

418
00:30:59,654 --> 00:31:00,923
If you want...

419
00:31:02,357 --> 00:31:04,759
I'll beg on my knees

420
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:06,461
So, please give me another chance.

421
00:31:06,461 --> 00:31:09,965
You know, I like handmade brands.

422
00:31:09,965 --> 00:31:13,568
I want to pick a top-quality item and keep it for a long, long time.

423
00:31:13,568 --> 00:31:17,406
But, you, Chang Ryul... you're not a top-quality item.

424
00:31:17,406 --> 00:31:20,441
I'm not sure if I want to keep you for a long time.

425
00:31:21,243 --> 00:31:24,580
In Hee, please!

426
00:31:37,192 --> 00:31:40,028
What can I do?

427
00:31:40,829 --> 00:31:43,698
It's not your problem, it's mine.

428
00:31:43,698 --> 00:31:48,737
Once someone has left my heart, 
there's no way back.

429
00:31:49,604 --> 00:31:52,807
Okay, fine.

430
00:31:52,807 --> 00:31:55,110
Okay, let's carry on living this way.

431
00:31:55,110 --> 00:32:02,117
It'll be messy... But in return, 
I'll stay here as long as I want to.

432
00:32:02,117 --> 00:32:02,884
Understand?

433
00:32:02,884 --> 00:32:04,185
Fine.

434
00:32:04,185 --> 00:32:06,655
Please don't interfere with my personal relationships.

435
00:32:06,655 --> 00:32:09,557
No matter who I date.

436
00:32:11,731 --> 00:32:13,933


437
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:19,905
Looks like you're a woman who doesn't know 
what it is to have worries.

438
00:32:21,174 --> 00:32:25,277
Your boyfriend two-times you and 
rejects you, your friend betrays you...

439
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,813
and all the same, you're feeling good again so soon.

440
00:32:26,813 --> 00:32:28,914
In Hee, I want some water, too!

441
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:52,171
Here...

442
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:06,451
Would you like some popcorn?

443
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,020
No thanks.

444
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,629
Don't you go on a diet?

445
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:19,565
I don't easily put on weight.

446
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:22,767
Even if you don't put on weight, 
at your age it still builds up belly fat.

447
00:33:25,905 --> 00:33:29,241
How many years did you live with Kim In Hee?

448
00:33:29,976 --> 00:33:32,878
Even after how she hurt you, 
you called out for her in such a normal voice...

449
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:35,313
I guess you two must have lived together 
for quite a long time

450
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,084
Ten years.

451
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:48,526
Heck, how come no matter how much I eat, 
the popcorn never gets any less?

452
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:06,845
Well, the popcorn is edible.

453
00:34:08,014 --> 00:34:10,282
Hm? You said at our age it all ends up as belly fat?

454
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:12,684
Ah, but I've a body type that doesn't get fat there.

455
00:34:14,187 --> 00:34:17,422
Huh! Have you taken lessons in polite conversation?

456
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,278
But...

457
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:42,781
How long have you known?

458
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:43,682
Known what?

459
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:45,250
That you're gay...

460
00:34:46,319 --> 00:34:48,220
Oops!  I mean...

461
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,922
that you're different from others.

462
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:53,458
I was seven when I realized I was.

463
00:34:54,594 --> 00:34:56,428
Are you a lesbian?

464
00:34:59,732 --> 00:35:04,303
The fact that I didn't have a mother. 
That's what made  me  different from others.

465
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:06,438
That's when I realized it.

466
00:35:08,508 --> 00:35:10,943
There was a talent show in the kindergarten.

467
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:13,311
We were wearing children's national costumes.

468
00:35:13,713 --> 00:35:18,350
At that day, all the other children had their mom 
come and help them dress.

469
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,586
I had no idea how to tie my ribbons.

470
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:22,488
I was standing alone lost.

471
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:25,958
Someone else's mom came and tied them for me.

472
00:35:26,759 --> 00:35:29,127
That was the time

473
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:34,699
I realized my mom was no longer there.

474
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:37,102
...That struck home to me.

475
00:35:41,908 --> 00:35:44,643
Maybe you...

476
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:48,248
felt like that. That was the thought that came to me.

477
00:35:48,248 --> 00:35:51,149
I never took part in any talent shows.

478
00:35:52,418 --> 00:35:53,369
Why not?

479
00:35:53,369 --> 00:35:55,821
Getting dolled up and dancing onstage,

480
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:57,989
I really hated all that sort of thing.

481
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:07,199
Why are you laughing?

482
00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:11,436
That was the start! Of you liking boys, right?

483
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:13,172
That's why you acted more manly, right?

484
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:14,640
Right? Right?

485
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,941
Isn't that right?

486
00:36:15,941 --> 00:36:17,776
Just be quiet and eat up!

487
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:21,180
Tell me about it, all right?

488
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,550
When was it?

489
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,984
Please, can we just eat?

490
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,920
Tell me about it! Huh? Huh?

491
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:32,123
Tell you what?

492
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:35,627
You know... What style of men do you like?

493
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:38,463
You look your prettiest when your mouth's shut.

494
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:40,632
Someone like... Hm...

495
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:41,367
But still... I'm curious...

496
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:42,601
Hey, let's just watch the movie, alright?

497
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:46,639
Hi!  I'm sorry...

498
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:48,107
You're here!

499
00:36:48,107 --> 00:36:50,008
Sorry I'm late.

500
00:36:52,412 --> 00:36:55,447
The director is not in yet?

501
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:56,182
He already came in.

502
00:36:56,182 --> 00:36:57,950
I don't smell coffee.

503
00:36:58,284 --> 00:36:59,952
There's no music either?

504
00:36:59,952 --> 00:37:01,553
He went to the toilet.

505
00:37:05,558 --> 00:37:06,392
Ah, there you are.

506
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:10,296
I got stuck in a traffic jam on the way here.

507
00:37:10,296 --> 00:37:12,497
There's been an accident outside the...

508
00:37:16,202 --> 00:37:17,036
Is there something wrong?

509
00:37:17,036 --> 00:37:17,770
Don't follow me.

510
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,305
Hey, what is it?  What is it?

511
00:37:19,305 --> 00:37:22,074
Don't come after me, I said!

512
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,500
Out of the way!

513
00:38:02,315 --> 00:38:05,117
How may I help you?

514
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:08,553
Ah... Yes... I need some indigestion... tablets...

515
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:10,055
Yes?

516
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:11,456
Indigestion medicine.

517
00:38:12,225 --> 00:38:13,659
What?

518
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:19,331
Diarrhea medicine!!

519
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:23,435
Resume, self-introduction letter, 
supporting documentation.

520
00:38:23,435 --> 00:38:25,537
All right, I'm ready.

521
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:32,077
Oh, Young Sun?

522
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:33,079
Are you okay?

523
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,146
How do you mean?

524
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:35,614
The oysters, I mean...

525
00:38:35,614 --> 00:38:38,650
Mom said there were some bad ones mixed in with them.

526
00:38:39,476 --> 00:38:40,686
What?

527
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:43,222
I'm fine because I didn't eat any, 
but I was wondering if  you're okay?

528
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:45,924
Of course, I'm all right.

529
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,261
Because Jin Ho ate them all...

530
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:56,435
I had... oo... oysters...

531
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,405
Oysters must be giving you trouble.

532
00:38:59,405 --> 00:39:02,474
I'm sure... I'm sick... Please give me medicine!

533
00:39:16,022 --> 00:39:18,958
Hah... Where is the toilet?

534
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:22,528
You go out, and to the right...

535
00:39:32,505 --> 00:39:34,206
Hey!

536
00:39:34,774 --> 00:39:38,376
You'll be needing the toilet keys!

537
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:58,897
Park Kae In!

538
00:40:01,267 --> 00:40:02,834
Park Kae In!

539
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:07,606
You're so dead!

540
00:40:09,008 --> 00:40:12,011
 There is no answer from the 
number you were calling, so... 

541
00:40:12,445 --> 00:40:14,813
He's not answering, Jin Ho...

542
00:40:14,881 --> 00:40:17,248
Is he alright?

543
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,287
I don't know... When I get a job, then...

544
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:24,856
If he wants out, then I'll just return him his deposit.

545
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:27,292
Why should I tiptoe around him? Huh!

546
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:28,160
What time is it now?

547
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,729
Oh! No!

548
00:40:43,509 --> 00:40:46,612
Are you sure you'll be able to meet Director Choi in that condition?

549
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:49,213
Don't worry. I'll be okay.

550
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:50,582
I'll give you a call.

551
00:40:59,325 --> 00:41:03,496
So you'll be sourcing the materials
 for this project from our company...?

552
00:41:03,496 --> 00:41:06,498
I won't be able to decide on it by myself...

553
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:08,200
Still, let me have a look first.

554
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,535
Yes, yes of course. Please come upstairs.

555
00:41:19,212 --> 00:41:20,913
Oh come, come now.

556
00:41:20,913 --> 00:41:24,049
The word is, you have a golden touch in this area.

557
00:41:24,851 --> 00:41:29,455
How do you do?  
I'm Park Kae In, the furniture designer.

558
00:41:29,455 --> 00:41:30,823
I was called for an interview.

559
00:41:30,823 --> 00:41:32,325
I see. Leave your resumé there, then you can go.

560
00:41:32,325 --> 00:41:34,960
W-W-W-Wait a minute!

561
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,164
This... is my portfolio of work I've done.

562
00:41:38,164 --> 00:41:40,299
All of these were designed by me... and...

563
00:41:40,299 --> 00:41:42,668
Especially this furniture is made for singles...

564
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:44,703
You plug this into your computer's USB port, then...

565
00:41:44,703 --> 00:41:48,740
Now listen, Miss. It's a secretary 
we're looking to hire, not a furniture designer.

566
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,075
You are?

567
00:41:50,075 --> 00:41:53,345
It looks like there's been a misunderstanding.

568
00:41:55,748 --> 00:41:57,282
I see.

569
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,018
I'm sorry.

570
00:42:09,662 --> 00:42:14,767
Sir, look at that woman. 
The one in a trench coat...

571
00:42:21,674 --> 00:42:22,174
Secretary Kim...

572
00:42:22,174 --> 00:42:22,775
Yes?

573
00:42:22,775 --> 00:42:26,278
Get out. I'll do the driving.

574
00:42:26,479 --> 00:42:27,579
Yeh?

575
00:42:28,014 --> 00:42:30,282
There's no subway here either!

576
00:43:21,862 --> 00:43:23,596
Please take a seat.

577
00:43:27,934 --> 00:43:31,304
Substituting a Kandinsky has given 
that area a much better feel,

578
00:43:31,304 --> 00:43:35,107
so I wanted to thank you by asking you to dinner

579
00:43:35,107 --> 00:43:38,845
With vision like that, in the forthcoming 
Dam Arts Center design competition,

580
00:43:38,845 --> 00:43:41,447
I'm looking forward to you 
submitting a really creative proposal.

581
00:43:41,447 --> 00:43:43,349
I have high expectations for you.

582
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:44,651
Thank you.

583
00:43:44,651 --> 00:43:46,586
I will do my best.

584
00:43:53,326 --> 00:43:55,261
Are you uncomfortable in some way?

585
00:43:56,529 --> 00:43:57,331
Ah, no, I'm fine.

586
00:43:58,198 --> 00:44:00,266
You're in a cold sweat.

587
00:44:00,266 --> 00:44:01,968
Here.

588
00:44:07,874 --> 00:44:10,476
We can meet for a meal some other time, 
I don't mind at all.

589
00:44:10,476 --> 00:44:12,211
Don't overwork yourself.

590
00:44:12,211 --> 00:44:14,480
Ah, no. I am fine.

591
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,015
No.

592
00:44:16,015 --> 00:44:18,151
I think it would be better for you to get some rest.

593
00:44:21,888 --> 00:44:23,423
That handkerchief...

594
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,458
Please make sure to return it next time we meet.

595
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:27,427
It's very special to me.

596
00:44:29,229 --> 00:44:31,130
I apologize.

597
00:44:36,102 --> 00:44:44,777

598
00:45:41,802 --> 00:45:43,069
Jin Ho!

599
00:45:44,471 --> 00:45:45,505
Are you okay?

600
00:45:45,505 --> 00:45:47,073
Do I look alright to you?

601
00:45:47,907 --> 00:45:50,009
I'm so sorry... I didn't know...

602
00:45:50,009 --> 00:45:51,244
You had diarrhea, right?

603
00:45:51,244 --> 00:45:52,846
Di...Diarrhea?

604
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,081
That's it.  Enough.

605
00:45:55,081 --> 00:45:56,849
W-W-W-Wait a minute.

606
00:45:56,849 --> 00:45:59,151
I have a medicine that works really well with diarrhea.

607
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:32,585
Where did it go?

608
00:46:35,021 --> 00:46:37,723
You're thinking of dripping water all over the house?

609
00:46:41,795 --> 00:46:42,795
Jin Ho,

610
00:46:42,795 --> 00:46:43,730
shall I make some porridge for you?

611
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:46,199
If you had diarrhea all day, you have to eat something.

612
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:48,367
Hey, stop with that diarrhea thing!

613
00:46:50,804 --> 00:46:52,505
I'm fine.

614
00:46:52,505 --> 00:46:54,473
You'll catch a cold. Go and change your clothes.

615
00:47:59,773 --> 00:48:01,274
Move aside.

616
00:48:02,943 --> 00:48:07,346
Does never a day go by without 
you having some sort of accident?

617
00:48:08,715 --> 00:48:10,350
And what about you, Jin Ho?

618
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:12,385
If a day goes by without you treating me badly,

619
00:48:12,385 --> 00:48:14,220
that day's just not complete for you, is it?

620
00:48:15,222 --> 00:48:17,856
Why do you have to say that, eh?

621
00:48:19,259 --> 00:48:22,395
Just get the worst of it up, your porridge will get cold...

622
00:48:23,797 --> 00:48:25,665
I made porridge for you.

623
00:48:38,011 --> 00:48:39,712
Try it.

624
00:48:39,712 --> 00:48:40,480
Yeh?

625
00:48:40,491 --> 00:48:42,491
I don't know if it's poisoned or not.

626
00:48:42,491 --> 00:48:43,691
What?

627
00:48:43,691 --> 00:48:47,291
Since you made it, I'm sure it's possible 
you made a mistake there, too.

628
00:48:51,992 --> 00:48:53,693
You saw me, right?

629
00:49:03,303 --> 00:49:04,704
Do you know something?

630
00:49:05,505 --> 00:49:07,807
Right now, you and I

631
00:49:07,807 --> 00:49:09,976
had an indirect kiss!

632
00:49:11,978 --> 00:49:14,147
I think I might have preferred being poisoned.

633
00:49:14,147 --> 00:49:16,215
You, you're a real jerk!

634
00:49:18,652 --> 00:49:20,153
What's with your hand?

635
00:49:20,153 --> 00:49:22,468
This is all because of you, Jin Ho.

636
00:49:22,468 --> 00:49:24,324
I got this yesterday, making that gratin.

637
00:49:24,324 --> 00:49:26,125
Then I cut myself here with a knife yesterday, too.

638
00:49:26,125 --> 00:49:28,427
That's how my fingers got this way.

639
00:49:28,427 --> 00:49:29,862
Put a band-aid on.

640
00:49:30,296 --> 00:49:33,199
That's all right. It's nothing.

641
00:49:46,012 --> 00:49:48,848
Take it. It seems like an urgent call.

642
00:49:52,852 --> 00:49:55,321
It's Chang Ryul...

643
00:50:06,099 --> 00:50:08,201
Kae In, it's me...

644
00:50:10,637 --> 00:50:12,605
I'm in front of your house, right now...

645
00:50:12,605 --> 00:50:14,574
Could you come out... just for a minute?

646
00:50:14,941 --> 00:50:16,843
Let me see your face just once, huh?

647
00:50:16,843 --> 00:50:18,711
Just your face.

648
00:50:18,711 --> 00:50:19,845
Anyways...

649
00:50:19,845 --> 00:50:22,481
I will wait until you come out...

650
00:50:24,985 --> 00:50:26,552
He wants to meet, right?

651
00:50:28,088 --> 00:50:31,024
He says he's outside now.

652
00:50:32,359 --> 00:50:33,693
Don't go outside.

653
00:50:35,728 --> 00:50:37,263
I am not going out.

654
00:50:37,697 --> 00:50:40,600
It's written all over your face. You want to go.

655
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,503
You should never hang onto a lost love.

656
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:53,813
My bet's on you going out.

657
00:50:55,782 --> 00:50:58,217
No. I'll never go out.

658
00:52:18,699 --> 00:52:20,433
Jeon Jin Ho...

659
00:52:20,833 --> 00:52:22,302
wins.

660
00:53:13,019 --> 00:53:15,454
Go back home to bed. You'll get a twisted mouth.

661
00:53:18,358 --> 00:53:19,859
Kae In...

662
00:53:21,127 --> 00:53:24,530
Haven't you come to the wrong place? In Hee isn't here.

663
00:53:29,903 --> 00:53:32,404
It's you I came to meet.

664
00:53:34,841 --> 00:53:35,975
Why?

665
00:53:37,043 --> 00:53:40,813
It rained today... So did it remind you of the soggy, wet puppy?

666
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:45,752
Park Kae In.

667
00:53:49,356 --> 00:53:51,090
I am sorry.

668
00:53:52,286 --> 00:53:57,261
I really wanted to say it. Directly to you.

669
00:53:57,261 --> 00:53:58,796
All that's for...

670
00:53:58,796 --> 00:54:01,183
is to make you feel better about yourself, isn't it?

671
00:54:03,834 --> 00:54:07,305
Until the very end... you are really selfish.

672
00:54:07,305 --> 00:54:09,774
It isn't like that.

673
00:54:09,774 --> 00:54:11,863
Kae In,

674
00:54:11,863 --> 00:54:13,611
why don't you just hit me? Huh?

675
00:54:13,611 --> 00:54:16,380
I truthfully came here because I wanted you to hit me.

676
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:17,950
Hit me... Huh?

677
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:20,592
Why would I hit you, Chang Ryul?

678
00:54:20,592 --> 00:54:22,211
My hands will get dirty.

679
00:54:24,055 --> 00:54:25,894
Dirty?

680
00:54:28,712 --> 00:54:30,895
You're right.

681
00:54:30,895 --> 00:54:36,266
I'm not even worthy of you getting your hands dirty on me.

682
00:54:48,779 --> 00:54:51,849
Why?

683
00:54:51,849 --> 00:54:53,884
Why was it In Hee of all people?

684
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:59,690
Why was it In Hee of all people,
 I asked you.

685
00:55:00,825 --> 00:55:07,664
Because... In Hee gave me everything.

686
00:55:08,733 --> 00:55:10,067
What?

687
00:55:14,839 --> 00:55:17,074
What do you mean by that?

688
00:55:17,074 --> 00:55:19,877
Where I was concerned, you always...

689
00:55:19,877 --> 00:55:23,381
kept yourself a step apart from me.

690
00:55:23,381 --> 00:55:29,387
You always acted as if you couldn't really believe...

691
00:55:29,387 --> 00:55:33,391
.... that I could become the kind of guy 
who'd stay with you the rest of your life.

692
00:55:33,391 --> 00:55:36,360
When did I act like that? When?

693
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,396
I don't understand what you're saying.

694
00:55:38,396 --> 00:55:40,097
Explain it to me so that I can understand.

695
00:55:40,097 --> 00:55:41,933
You see?

696
00:55:41,933 --> 00:55:45,436
Even now, you still don't understand what I'm saying.

697
00:55:45,436 --> 00:55:49,507
Kae In... you and me...

698
00:55:49,507 --> 00:55:51,876
we aren't a young girl and a young boy.

699
00:55:51,876 --> 00:55:55,680
I mean, we aren't just a couple of teenagers 
with a crush on each other.

700
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,616
I approached you as a grown-up man,

701
00:55:58,616 --> 00:56:01,419
but you always responded to those approaches...

702
00:56:01,419 --> 00:56:03,287
with the heart of a completely inexperienced,

703
00:56:03,287 --> 00:56:06,290
totally innocent little girl.

704
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:09,327
That's how it was...

705
00:56:09,327 --> 00:56:10,894
Isn't that right?

706
00:56:13,164 --> 00:56:15,032
So is that...

707
00:56:15,032 --> 00:56:17,334
how things were?

708
00:56:19,303 --> 00:56:20,905
Was it because of that...

709
00:56:20,905 --> 00:56:22,439
... that we broke up?

710
00:56:28,846 --> 00:56:31,415
I...

711
00:56:31,415 --> 00:56:39,223
always trembled whenever you gave me even a playful kiss.

712
00:56:39,223 --> 00:56:42,426
You only needed to sigh,

713
00:56:42,426 --> 00:56:47,932
and my heart became heavy too.

714
00:56:47,932 --> 00:56:52,136
Whenever you were taking me out...

715
00:56:52,136 --> 00:56:55,573
... this may seem feeble, but it's true...

716
00:56:55,573 --> 00:56:58,676
I even begrudged the time that getting 
changed would keep me apart from you,

717
00:56:58,676 --> 00:57:01,745
so I rushed out wearing just sweats.

718
00:57:05,316 --> 00:57:10,220
But that... wasn't enough for you?

719
00:57:12,924 --> 00:57:18,396
Didn't you see that as me giving you everything?

720
00:57:18,396 --> 00:57:20,264
It wasn't down to me.

721
00:57:20,264 --> 00:57:23,668
You really think that was the way to 
make me believe you were the one?

722
00:57:23,668 --> 00:57:26,570
Don't you realize I'm a simple sort of guy?

723
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:28,940
Your job was to make me believe that you 
were the woman I simply had to marry.

724
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:32,109
Why couldn't you manage to do that?

725
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:38,849
So it's my fault.

726
00:57:38,849 --> 00:57:41,485
I'm not saying it's your fault.

727
00:57:41,485 --> 00:57:45,756
You and I were different.

728
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:54,631
 

729
00:58:00,404 --> 00:58:01,539
What is it?

730
00:58:01,539 --> 00:58:03,708
How could you leave in the middle of a conversation?

731
00:58:03,708 --> 00:58:06,009
Come back so we can  finish our talk.

732
00:58:06,991 --> 00:58:07,791
Come home!

733
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:09,091
Come home and we can finish with this conversation.

734
00:58:09,091 --> 00:58:11,491
You know how much I hate drawing out things like this.

735
00:58:11,549 --> 00:58:13,284
Hey, Kim In-

736
00:58:14,752 --> 00:58:18,155
I have nothing to say to you tonight.

737
00:58:18,191 --> 00:58:20,791
Don't wait up for me. Just go to bed.

738
00:58:27,632 --> 00:58:32,936
So right now, you're living with In Hee?

739
00:58:44,749 --> 00:58:47,485
And yet...

740
00:58:47,485 --> 00:58:49,687
you came to find me...

741
00:58:49,687 --> 00:58:51,822
and you're behaving like this?

742
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:58,829
Right to the very end, 
I've just been one big joke in your eyes.

743
00:58:58,829 --> 00:59:02,166
Oh...

744
00:59:02,166 --> 00:59:04,101
How totally pathetic of me...

745
00:59:06,971 --> 00:59:09,440
How...?

746
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,876
How could you make someone feel so pathetic, 
right to the bitter end?

747
00:59:16,191 --> 00:59:17,691
Please go away!

748
00:59:17,691 --> 00:59:19,091
Please.

749
00:59:35,933 --> 00:59:38,669
Park Kae In, don't you have any pride?

750
00:59:38,669 --> 00:59:41,172
Are you a fool?

751
00:59:41,172 --> 00:59:43,307
He calls and you just go out?

752
00:59:46,177 --> 00:59:48,079
Please stop it.

753
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:49,814
You really are like a puppy.

754
00:59:49,814 --> 00:59:50,915
Even after he dumped you,

755
00:59:50,915 --> 00:59:54,051
all he has to do is call and you go out smiling.

756
00:59:55,486 --> 00:59:58,222
Do you know how pathetic that makes you look?

757
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:03,561
Everyone...

758
01:00:03,561 --> 01:00:07,131
Why all of you think that you can just push me around?

759
01:00:07,131 --> 01:00:10,267
What was so wrong about what I did?

760
01:00:10,267 --> 01:00:11,802
Why...

761
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:16,273
Why does everyone make me feel pathetic?

762
01:00:16,273 --> 01:00:17,393
Why...?

763
01:00:19,477 --> 01:00:22,480
You're really asking why you're so pathetic?

764
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:26,049
Can't you see it's nobody but you 
yourself that's made yourself pathetic?

765
01:00:27,918 --> 01:00:31,255
Someone like you...

766
01:00:31,255 --> 01:00:34,292
...has probably never ever waited a whole day long...

767
01:00:34,292 --> 01:00:38,429
...just for someone you're fond of to call you.

768
01:00:40,297 --> 01:00:43,901
Just the mere sight of him,

769
01:00:43,901 --> 01:00:48,005
the way it makes your heart feel about to burst,

770
01:00:48,005 --> 01:00:52,109
even if you died and lived a second lifetime, 
you'd never know what that's like.

771
01:00:54,712 --> 01:00:56,681
The man who made me feel that way about him...

772
01:00:56,681 --> 01:01:00,851
asks me to come out to him.

773
01:01:00,851 --> 01:01:03,621
No matter what wrongs he's done me...

774
01:01:03,621 --> 01:01:06,324
... I wanted to hear him tell me...

775
01:01:06,324 --> 01:01:10,394
...why he'd come. What other choice did I have?

776
01:01:11,462 --> 01:01:13,031
That's just the way I'm made.

777
01:01:13,031 --> 01:01:15,199
I can't help it.

778
01:01:32,216 --> 01:01:35,453
He said I didn't give him everything.

779
01:01:35,453 --> 01:01:38,022
In Hee gave him everything, but I didn't.

780
01:01:38,022 --> 01:01:40,691
I didn't, and so,

781
01:01:40,691 --> 01:01:43,160
he couldn't bring himself to believe...

782
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,631
that I was the woman he simply had to marry.

783
01:01:46,631 --> 01:01:48,766
Hah! That punk!

784
01:01:49,667 --> 01:01:52,270
Why is he coming to say that now?

785
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:55,606
He said I was just a little girl,

786
01:01:55,606 --> 01:02:00,311
not a woman in his eyes.

787
01:02:00,311 --> 01:02:02,079
Forget about it all now.

788
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:05,883
How can I forget it?

789
01:02:05,883 --> 01:02:09,320
The first man who was ever special in my life...

790
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:13,223
...comes and says...

791
01:02:14,959 --> 01:02:19,063
...he never saw me as a woman...

792
01:02:19,063 --> 01:02:21,665
...and that's why I lost him.

793
01:02:22,567 --> 01:02:26,270
Now all this has happened, 
what's the point of talking about it?

794
01:02:28,372 --> 01:02:31,441
Somehow...

795
01:02:31,441 --> 01:02:37,315
I keep thinking it was all my fault...

796
01:02:37,315 --> 01:02:41,185
It was not Chang Ryul's fault.

797
01:02:41,185 --> 01:02:44,822
It wasn't that In Hee was bad.

798
01:02:44,822 --> 01:02:49,660
Everything was all because of... me.

799
01:02:50,828 --> 01:02:52,797
What's the matter with you?

800
01:02:52,797 --> 01:02:54,965
Are you determined to drink yourself to death?

801
01:03:01,372 --> 01:03:03,641
If you feel so wronged,

802
01:03:03,641 --> 01:03:07,178
then make him come and grab you again.

803
01:03:07,178 --> 01:03:09,547
The fact that he's lost a woman like you,

804
01:03:09,547 --> 01:03:12,249
make him regret it.

805
01:03:12,249 --> 01:03:14,351
Jin Ho...

806
01:03:24,762 --> 01:03:31,668
Do you think you could maybe... 
make me into a woman?
