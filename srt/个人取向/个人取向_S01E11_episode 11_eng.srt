1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,100
The same way you disregarded me, Chang Ryul.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,500
I wanted to do the same thing to you.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,900
But...

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,300
I don't want to anymore.

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,800
I can't take it anymore.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,600
Kae In,

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,400
if this is because you're feeling sorry towards me, it's okay.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,000
Even if you started off feeling that way, 
I'm saying it's okay.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,700
It's okay, I can change you..

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,400
No.

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,400
You don't have the ability to change me.

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,800
Kae In...

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,600
Chang Ryul, you don't know.

14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,300
My heart...

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,900
My heart...

16
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,000
who it is...

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,500
it's drawn to.

18
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,500
Its "Game over".

19
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,300
What are you doing?

20
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,400
Just what on earth are you doing?

21
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,200
Didn't I allow you to part with her as friends?

22
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,300
I wanted to do it too, but...

23
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,400
I can't bring myself to do it.

24
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,000
What?

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,200
I...

26
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,200
from now on, with this girl,

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,500
I'm going to love her as a man.

28
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,700
Jeon Jin Ho...

29
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,300
Jin Ho...

30
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,900
What is this supposed to mean?

31
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,500
How would you...

32
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,900
As a man...?

33
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,300
Kae In,

34
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,900
I...

35
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,800
am not gay.

36
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,900
Then...

37
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,200
I apologize

38
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,100
for telling you so late.

39
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,400
Can you at least forgive me

40
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,900
for telling you now?

41
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Episode 11 
 Clear skies beginning today? 

42
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,000
Are you really just going to let it end this way?

43
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,400
What else can I do?

44
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,700
Find Kae In, then kneel and beg her!

45
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,000
So what if I beg?

46
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,200
You saw it too.

47
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,400
The moment when Jin Ho said that he wasn't gay, Kae In's reaction.

48
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,700
That spells it all out clearly.

49
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,800
I don't even have a shred of hope left.

50
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,700
And you give up just because of that?

51
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,400
Didn't you say you couldn't live without her?

52
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,400
If that is the case, hold on to her.

53
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,700
I don't want to.

54
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,300
Why?

55
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,500
Why don't you do it?

56
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,500
Why?

57
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,300
You ask me why?

58
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,800
Because I love her.

59
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,600
I caused her so much hurt and pain.

60
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,400
But now because of Jin Ho, she can laugh.

61
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,000
That feels like love, doesn't it?

62
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,400
Letting her go... It really feels like love, doesn't it?

63
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,400
Don't be mistaken, Han Chang Ryul.

64
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,500
That is only

65
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,900
an excuse for your weak will.

66
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,600
You go ahead and drink away your sorrows here.

67
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,500
From now on, I'm going to do as I please.

68
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,100
Please stop now, Kim In Hee.

69
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,300
You will only be more pathetic in the end.

70
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,100
There is only one rule for my opinion of love.

71
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,100
If I can't get it,

72
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,900
nobody else can.

73
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
I know I have done wrong.

74
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,900
No, I know I deserve to die.

75
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,500
So...

76
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,100
please don't be mad at me.

77
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
You don't want to face me anymore?

78
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,700
 You can't even start to realise how much turmoil I felt during this period. 

79
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,900
 I kept wishing you were a real man. 

80
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,600
 I really felt like such a fool. 

81
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,900
 Do you know? 

82
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,300
 I didn't have the confidence, 

83
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,500
 Your feelings for Chang Ryul.. 

84
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,900
 I was afraid you couldn't let go of them. 

85
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,700
 Jin Ho, when I realised my feelings.. 

86
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:05,600
 I felt really alone and speechless... 
That is why I distracted myself with other matters. 

87
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,200
 Doing what I have never done before in seeking revenge. 

88
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,400
 I have seen the truth today finally. 

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,500
 When I heard you telling Chang Ryul... 

90
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,400
 you can't do it anymore. 

91
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,800
 Are you a fool? 

92
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,700
 How could you realise this only now? 

93
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,600
 I impersonated a man... Being friends with you... 
I exhausted myself. And it all didn't matter to you... 

94
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,700
 I... 

95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,400
 Although I am a bit foolish, 

96
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,000
 Jin Ho, 

97
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,000
 to be by your side the rest of my life... 

98
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,500
 even if I were to forsake myself being a woman, 

99
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,500
 I wouldn't... 

100
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,100
 I wouldn't mind it at all. 

101
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,700
 You are really... 

102
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,100
 a fool. 

103
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,300
 This period... 

104
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,200
 I have suffered so much hurt. 

105
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,500
 And pain too. 

106
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,100
 I am really sorry. 

107
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,900
 Please forgive me. 

108
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,600
 I won't. 

109
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,900
 I will not forgive you. 

110
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,300
 I will not...forgive you. 

111
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,300
 Park Kae In's weather forecast for tomorrow. 

112
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,100
 I always wished he would stay by my side as a good friend... 

113
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,800
 But today, he wishes for us to start afresh, as a couple. 
And he apologized to me too... 

114
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,100
 Although my heart was really fluttering, 

115
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,000
 after all the tears, 

116
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,700
 I won't forgive him tonight. 

117
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,600
 But from tomorrow onwards, no matter the weather,
I will not be afraid anymore. 

118
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,800
Go.

119
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,100
Tonight, I...

120
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,600
I don't want to see you.

121
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,000
Please go.

122
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,400
Kae In.

123
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,200
I know you feel betrayed now.

124
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,200
So...

125
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,300
you don't want to forgive me now.

126
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,700
But...

127
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:25,200
this is my first time expressing my feelings to somebody,
 I don't know how to handle this well.

128
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Take it that I don't know anything, 
so will you forgive me?

129
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,200
This isn't your first time.

130
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,200
Jin Ho,

131
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,000
you have loved somebody too.

132
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:53,000
The other day, we met her... Eun Soo.

133
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,400
Eun Soo...

134
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,900
you were mindful of her?

135
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,700
Then I'll explain it to you.

136
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,600
Eun Soo and me...

137
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,200
Oppa!

138
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,400
Oppa...

139
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,200
Oppa~~

140
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Why isn't it me?

141
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,500
Tae Hoon, take care of her.

142
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,900
I'm asking you why it can't be me?

143
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,800
I'm younger and prettier than her.

144
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,700
And I'm the one that loves you more. Why?

145
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,700
Why?

146
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,600
Hey!

147
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,200
Kae In...

148
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,900
Kae...

149
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,600
Why am I not the one? And she is?

150
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,600
I don’t see anyone else as a woman except for her.

151
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Satisfied?

152
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,200
Oppa...

153
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
If... If I forgave him immediately...

154
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,600
Park Kae In, you will be a total pushover!

155
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,700
Come here.

156
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,700
Oppa, it hurts!

157
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,900
I want to trash it out with the other woman right now!

158
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,100
You have nothing to talk things over with.

159
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,600
And Tae Hoon you... What are you doing?

160
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,400
Why did you let Hye Mi get here?

161
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,000
No.

162
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,100
When she started drinking, she wasn't saying anything. 
She just kept crying.

163
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,700
Then she started running here like a mad girl all of a sudden.

164
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,600
That's right. I'm crazy now.

165
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,300
I said I'm crazy...

166
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,200
I'm really going mad because of you!

167
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,200
She fell asleep.

168
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,200
She's too young to have issues 
that can't be resolved  easily.

169
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Short-term is better than long-term hurt.

170
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,100
Do you know how much Tae Hoon likes her?

171
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,900
She will forget me soon enough.

172
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,300
Don't worry.

173
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,900
Not coming back are you?

174
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,300
I'm going.

175
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,400
You are going to continue staying there?

176
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,400
Even if you were both planning to get married...

177
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,100
you mustn't be like this.

178
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,000
Ah... This?

179
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,700
I...

180
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,600
I am continuing a project with Kae In.

181
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,000
That's why if we are both staying together... 
it will be more convenient.

182
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Is she an architect too?

183
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,600
No.

184
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,400
She is... a furniture designer.

185
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,600
This project I'm doing, she is in charge 
of designing a very important furniture.

186
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,000
But still...

187
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,500
But still this isn't right.

188
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,000
Hye Mi isn't letting me go easily too.

189
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,900
I will feel awkward staying with her now.

190
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,900
So I'll be going.

191
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,300
Hey!

192
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,300
Jin Ho!

193
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,400
You better be thinking twice!

194
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,500
How do you treat other women?

195
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,800
Letting them go crazy over you...

196
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,600
You bad man!

197
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,700
What are you doing now?

198
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,800
And why is this doll "Jin Ho"?

199
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,600
After hitting it, you feel better?

200
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,800
You might as well hit me then.

201
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,200
I'm a total jerk, so hit me then.

202
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,300
Ah... Ah... Ah... You really...

203
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,100
Let go!

204
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,000
Hye Mi, what's your relationship with her?

205
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:08,200
Err no... Hye Mi said that she was your fiancee. 
I'm sure there are feelings for her.

206
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,800
From 7 years old, she was already like that, Hye Mi.

207
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,800
She liked you from 7 years old?

208
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
Wow...

209
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,400
You have really made a lot of women cry.

210
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,200
Jealous much?

211
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,700
Jea... Jea... Who's jealous ?

212
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,000
Heh, you are obviously jealous.

213
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Jealous my foot!

214
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,800
I really can't understand you.

215
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,000
I thought you were a very savvy (easy-going) man.

216
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,800
Hye Mi has liked you since she was 7.

217
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,500
How could you treat her like that?

218
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,600
It's none of my business,

219
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,800
so do whatever you want!

220
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,700
What a cruel person...

221
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,700
That's right.

222
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,700
I have a cruel side to me.

223
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,400
I don't care what other people think,

224
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,600
,either do I have the time to.

225
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,700
That's why, Kae In, I caused you hurt.

226
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You treated Eun Soo this cruelly too?

227
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,400
Before she went abroad, she told me...

228
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,000
If I didn't want her to go, she'd stay.

229
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,100
But...

230
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,800
I didn't let her stay.

231
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,200
Wh... Why?

232
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:29,500
Didn't you say... you became gay after she left you?

233
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,700
I didn't know if I had the confidence

234
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,200
that she was the one meant for me in my life.

235
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:45,800
Then I... Jin Ho, what do I mean to you?

236
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,200
Even if we were to be reborn,

237
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,000
I will not want to be separated from you in my life.

238
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,000
Excuse me...

239
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,100
Aren't you hungry?

240
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,100
I'll cook ramen for you!

241
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,300
When you ask if I want to eat,

242
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,000
that means you are feeling embarrassed.

243
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,500
I love you.

244
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:28,100


245
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,200
Here comes coffee!

246
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,700
2 teaspoons of sugar for you!

247
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,100
You drank alcohol yesterday. Here, black coffee.

248
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,700
Hyung, 2 teaspoons sugar, 2 teaspoons milk correct?

249
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,100
Hyung, what's the matter with you?

250
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,900
Treating us to coffee?

251
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,400
Anything to cheer about?

252
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,300
Is this poison?

253
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,200
Do you have anything hiding from us?

254
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,100
You gonna announce something explosive to us?

255
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,900
This is brunch. For you guys who haven't had breakfast yet.

256
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,900
Ah...

257
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,300
This difficult period, you guys have worked hard.

258
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,800
Fighting!

259
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,300
Love you all!

260
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,100
Why?

261
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,000
Aren't you being disrespectful?

262
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,200
But I'm taller than you.

263
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,700
Wanna die?

264
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,700
What?

265
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,200
Jin Ho isn't gay.

266
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,600
What?

267
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,700
Jin Ho treats me like a woman.

268
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,000
Did you... eat wrong medicine?

269
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,500
Or you saw something you aren't supposed 
to see between him and Director Choi?

270
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,700
Kae In, are you feeling too lonely? 
You are living in an imaginary world.

271
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,700
I too...

272
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,300
wasn't sure if it was a dream or reality at the start.

273
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,700
It was just our misunderstanding.

274
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,200
What mistake...? Dumbo!

275
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,500
Jin Ho might have been lying in front of his mother, 
didn't you think of that?

276
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,900
Treating you like fart...

277
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,400
Jin Ho...

278
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,900
In front of Chang Ryul's face,

279
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,200
he kissed me.

280
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,300
"I...

281
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,400
want to love Park Kae In wholely."

282
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,100
In front of In Hee and Chang Ryul,

283
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,600
He said those things, and ran towards me to grab my hand too!

284
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,100
My heartbeat.... thumped real fast...
My legs felt like Jell-O.

285
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,500
Really??

286
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,400
Really?

287
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,000
If you were dreaming and you told me a lie... you're dead!

288
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,500
No!

289
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,600
It's real.

290
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,600
I have good taste!

291
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,800
I said it... I knew it when I wanted Jin Ho to stay here.

292
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,800
Wait a minute...

293
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,400
Then Sang Jun, that jerk too...

294
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,000
Unni!

295
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,700
Came early?

296
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,600
So you aren't gay.

297
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,800
What do you mean?

298
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,200
How did you know?

299
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,000
Ah!

300
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,300
I'll talk after I smack you good once!

301
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,700
Ahh, really...

302
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,900
What I couldn't tell Kae In, I told you...

303
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,500
How embarrassing...

304
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,200
Unni, you can't think of it that way. I was worried about you, tried to understand you. Didn't you know?

305
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,800
Shut up!

306
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,200
We won't ever meet again.

307
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,100
Even if we wanted to, we can't!

308
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,700
But how did you know?

309
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,900
Ahh, is it because even when I was acting gay, you felt my male attractiveness?

310
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,000
You must be joking... I really feel like punching you right now!

311
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,600
Kae In and Jin Ho are starting to date!

312
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,200
Who?? Who is dating who now?

313
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,500
Hey you!

314
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,900
You...

315
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,400
What is it?

316
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,900
You...

317
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,500
You and Kae In...

318
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,400
News does spread fast.

319
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,500
What?

320
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,700
So it's true??!

321
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,400
Yes. Truth.

322
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,200
How do we handle this...

323
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,000
Then Director Choi...

324
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,200
He thinks you're gay! 
That's why he has been supporting you all the time.

325
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,400
I will be honest with him.

326
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
Hey! Hey! Hey!

327
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,000
Don't be hasty!

328
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,900
This is very complicated!

329
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,600
If Director Choi gets mad at you,

330
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,000
you will not be the forerunner anymore. What will you do?

331
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,400
It can't be helped then.

332
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,300
You love Kae In that much?!?

333
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,300
Yeah.

334
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,800
Jeju Island?

335
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,200
Yes.

336
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,700
There are many childrens' theme parks in Jeju Island,

337
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,600
so let's do some research there.

338
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,000
Yes.

339
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,100
And Jeon Jin Ho will be participating in our MS Group's seminar.

340
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,800
So help me out here.

341
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,500
What?

342
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,100
The dinner previously... Your acting skills was bad to say the least.

343
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,000
It was a very awkward situation.

344
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,900
So be more natural this time.

345
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Am I requesting too much from one-way love teacher?

346
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,700
But you see, sir,

347
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,600
Jin Ho, he...

348
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,700
Time to head to the airport.

349
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,800
I'm headed to Japan first, 
I'll catch up with you in Jeju.

350
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,200
See you there.

351
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,200
Yes, goodbye.

352
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,400
What should I do...?

353
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,900
That's not it.

354
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,100
It cannot be!

355
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,100
Hmm, but if you think of it this way...

356
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,400
Of course!! If you were to be Professor Park's son-in-law,

357
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,900
the Dam Arts Center project will obviously be yours!

358
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,800
It's a given, isn't it?

359
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,500
He will tell you Sang Go Jae's secret too!

360
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,700
You! I'm impressed with you!

361
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,500
Of course! Compared with Director Choi, Professor Park is ahead of him!

362
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,800
Hyung,

363
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,700
don't put words in my mouth.

364
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:35,900
Of course! I know this isn't the reason for you.

365
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,100
But I feel mighty relieved.

366
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,800
If you continue being like this, 
I'll give up the Dam Arts Center project.

367
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,000
All right, all right, I'll  shut the mouth .

368
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,800
You, really!

369
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,500
Get out.

370
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,600
Oohh!

371
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,200
Shut your mouth.

372
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,100
He's driving me crazy...

373
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,600
The President is here!

374
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,500
Hey, you rascal!

375
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,300
You don't want to live anymore?

376
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,000
You deserve death!

377
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,500
Hey, you crazy guy!

378
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,000
You drank, and you didn't go to work!

379
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,800
This is a critical period now! 
And yet you still have time to sleep?

380
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,400
I'm getting on in years, but I'm still working like poop!

381
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,900
But you! You don't even care about the company anymore!

382
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:30,700
You rascal! If you continue like this, don't bother anymore. 
Head back to China immediately!

383
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,500
I don't want to see you!

384
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,000
Yeah...

385
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,200
I'll go.

386
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,200
Wha-wha-what did you say?

387
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,400
- This punk! 
- President!

388
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,700
Aigoo...

389
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,100
I don't have the confidence to stay here any longer.

390
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,300
I'll be headed to China.

391
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,600
Wha-wha-what?

392
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,300
Congrats. Both of you have come clean with your feelings.

393
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,600
You were brave.

394
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,000
If you were thinking like this, thank you.

395
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,500
What is so good about Kae In?

396
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,300
Director Choi will be very disappointed if you continue like this.

397
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Is Kae In so self-sacrificial?

398
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,400
Yes.

399
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,800
I'll be off to meet Director Choi.

400
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,900
Jin Ho, it's because of you.

401
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,300
You are planning on coming clean with Director Choi,

402
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,600
but he's abroad in Japan.

403
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,500
I'll meet him another day then.

404
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,300
This is a seminar invitation card to Jeju Island.

405
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:55,500
Judges from the Dam Arts Center Project will also be there.

406
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,500
Director Choi hopes that you will participate in the seminar too.

407
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,600
Jeju Island...

408
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,500
Director Choi is very fond of the place.

409
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:16,700
But because of you, it will turn into a very hurtful place.

410
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,400
Then...

411
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,900
Why is it Kae In?

412
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,300
As your companion, am I not a better choice?

413
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,300
Consoling the disappointed Director Choi,

414
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,100
affecting the results of the Dam Arts Center Project,

415
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,700
I am better than her in those areas.

416
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,200
I'm not looking for a business partner.

417
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,000
I'm looking for a partner for life.

418
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,200
And you think Kae In has the right to be that person?

419
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,100
Why are you wasting your lifeblood away?

420
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,700
You saw us together yesterday,

421
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,800
and yet you are saying this nonsense. 
Aren't you wasting your time?

422
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:04,500
It might be me hating to lose,

423
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,300
isn't it?

424
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,300
You really have a loose way of living your life...

425
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,300
Looks good.

426
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,000
If you have the time, let's go on a date.

427
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,400
Umm... Although I'm real busy...

428
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,000
Since you begged that way...

429
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Hah. When have I ever begged?

430
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,200
I'm finishing up. Wait a bit!

431
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,200
Ahh, while we are on a date, let's continue where we left off last night about Eun Soo...

432
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,600
Ah! I suddenly remembered I have some unfinished business...

433
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,900
I must use this method frequently.

434
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,500
"Pricking" you is pretty fun.

435
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,000
I have to go.

436
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,700
Go where!!??

437
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,200
Yes, Jang Mi.

438
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,400
Don't worry.

439
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,000
My mother won't be a hateful person.

440
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,000
But I'm so nervous...

441
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,800
If your mother doesn't approve of us, what do we do?

442
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,700
Actually I know my looks are not to be taken seriously,

443
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,600
and I'm a bit dumb too...

444
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,300
You know it too!

445
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,800
If I like someone, my mother will like her too.

446
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,000
Is that so?

447
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,100
Yes.

448
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,100
She will treat you like her own daughter.

449
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,500
So don't worry.

450
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,400
Hello.

451
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,500
Did you wait for me too long?

452
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,200
No, not at all.

453
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,700
Park Kae In, isn't it?

454
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,400
Yes.

455
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,300
It was too messy the other day.

456
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,300
We never had a good discussion too.

457
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,400
No, I apologize.

458
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,700
I should be the one visiting you instead.

459
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,900
I have trust in Jin Ho,

460
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:22,800
I am sure he has picked a perfect woman.

461
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,400
I am lacking a lot...

462
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,900
That isn't supposed to be said...

463
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,300
She is so honest!

464
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Looks like my Jin Ho is really head over heels with you.

465
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,500
This is the first time I've seen him 
speak up for someone in front of me.

466
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,600
If I don't help her say anything, she won't.

467
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,200
I'm not petty like that.

468
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,300
Although I'm not petty,

469
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,800
there is still something...

470
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,000
Yes?

471
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,200
The project the both of you are involved in together...

472
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,900
Although there's no choice but to work together...

473
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,600
Project?

474
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:04,700
That's the project we are involved in now...

475
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,800
I'm in charge of the planning, 
Kae In you must help me out.

476
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:15,100
That's why we need to pool our opinions together, under the same roof.

477
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,600
I see...

478
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,700
That...

479
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:27,600
As I said, since that is the reason both of you are staying 
together... I tried to be understanding as much as I could.

480
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,700
So...

481
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,600
you must promise...

482
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,100
one thing.

483
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
What?

484
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,500
No pregnancy before marriage, 
if that doesn't happen it would be good.

485
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,000
Ah, mother...

486
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,100
Yes?

487
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,500
You gave me a fright!

488
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,500
Pack your bags and move out immediately!

489
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,300
What?

490
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,800
Why must you lie to your mother to stay here?

491
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,900
Pregnancy before marriage...

492
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,600
Why do I have to consider myself being in this situation?

493
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,350
There is no need to-

494
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:22,600
I won't lay my hands on you anywhere... 
Don't exaggerate things will you?

495
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,100
Jin Ho, what use do you have then?

496
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,350
Your mother will be very worried.

497
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,250
Then I'll really be going?

498
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,500
Go!

499
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,000
This woman... So cold towards me...

500
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,900
Really, shall I go?

501
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,350
Go!

502
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,750
Do you want some help?

503
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,450
That's fine.

504
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,900
But...you are packing real slow.

505
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,000
I like to take my time doing things.

506
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,250
Don't want to go, is that it?

507
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,050
Why wouldn't I want to leave?

508
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:03,300
I'm happy I don't have to clean up for you in the future.

509
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:11,400
Let's date only once a week, shall we?

510
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,800
I'm real busy designing the furniture for the Children's Playroom.

511
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,100
Don't know if I even have the time to date once a week...

512
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,000
Ah... really?

513
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,400
That's great. I'll be busy planning for the Dam Arts Center project too.

514
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,500
In that case, we might as well meet up once a month.

515
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,800
Ah yeah, sure. I like it.

516
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,850
Finish packing and leave then. I still have some work to do.

517
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,600
Argh... It's not supposed to be like this...

518
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,300


519
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,650
I'm going.

520
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,250
Go.

521
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,450
Aren't you sending me out?

522
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,750
I'm too busy, I don't have time for that.

523
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,550
Work till death then! I'm leaving.

524
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,300
Bye, bye.

525
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,900
Really... I am leaving.

526
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,850
Really. Can't you open the door by yourself?

527
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,200
Acting cool... Acting cool...

528
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,300
You only know how to act cool!

529
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,650


530
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,900
Park Kae In, you dumb fool.

531
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:54,250
If I leave again, can I think of another reason to come back?

532
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,100
Pregnancy before marriage?

533
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:13,400
As a woman when I heard those words... 
How can I let him continue to stay here?

534
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,500
But yet how could you leave just like that without 
saying anything when I said those few words?

535
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,200
PETTY PETTY!! PETTY rascal!

536
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:30,050
Owww... my tummy!! Gotta head to the bathroom.

537
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,950
Sigh... Too crazy.

538
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:44,150
Let me check if you have locked up... You are too clumsy.

539
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:49,200
Pffft... It's too fake...

540
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,750
The car is getting low on gas. Gotta top it up.. Can I borrow some money?

541
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:02,400
Did my Army Reserves letter arrive? It's almost time for it.

542
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,950
Why are you back?

543
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,500
I came for my laptop.

544
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,950
You always carry it around, why do you forget about it only now?

545
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:37,600
I also have moments when I forget.

546
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,600
Pack it up and leave quickly.

547
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,050
I'm packing it now!

548
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,200
Don't come back. 
Now think carefully what item have you left out?

549
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,000
I got everything!

550
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,250
So then, really goodbye.

551
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,700
Take real good care of yourself then.

552
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,900
Yawnnn, so sleepy...

553
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,900
Fine, fine.

554
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,950
Not sending me off again...

555
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,050
Ah, ah, aaaah! Oh!

556
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,400
What's wrong?

557
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,450
I slipped and fell... I think I might have sprained it...

558
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,700
Where is it? Where? Here? This spot?

559
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,300
Where? Where?

560
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,900
It tickles!

561
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,800
It's this spot on my leg...

562
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,600
What is this?

563
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,100
Ah... It's a scar from when I was young.

564
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,050
I can't remember what happened.

565
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,250
It must have hurt a lot...

566
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,300
It tickles, it tickles...

567
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,100
Aaah, it hurts.

568
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,550
Stop the act.

569
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,650
It's really sprained!

570
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,550
Your acting skills are really terrible.

571
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,700
Ah, really...

572
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,450
Kae In!

573
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,500
What to do? What to do?

574
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,600
Why?

575
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,250
Young Sun knows you aren't gay now!

576
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:52,800
So?

577
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,700
So if she catches us in a room together, what would she think?!

578
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,850
Don't utter a sound, stay here quietly!

579
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,650
Park Kae In!

580
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,400
Young Sun.

581
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,800
What brings you here so late at night?

582
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,750
Give me some water, quick.

583
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,450
Aaah... yeah...

584
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:35,700
What's with the luggage?

585
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,000
You know the answer and yet you ask.

586
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,600
Had a fight with your hubby again?

587
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,300
Kae In,

588
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:53,050
can I stay here for the time being?

589
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,300
Argh... you have a perfectly good home to go back to!

590
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,500
But you leaving the house like that isn't the answer.

591
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,350
You are a mother. What's going to happen to the child?

592
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,250
How would I know?! He can figure that out himself!

593
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
It wasn't easy for him to be back home.

594
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,500
I wanted to liven up the atmosphere.

595
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,700
But after showering,

596
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,300
I turned around and he had fallen asleep.

597
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,650
Nothing I did could wake him up...

598
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,100
Jin Ho has heard everything!

599
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,450
Ooooh, no.

600
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:43,100
He doesn't live here anymore!

601
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,900
Ah yes yes... Because he isn't gay now...

602
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,700
That's why both of you aren't staying together now.

603
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,800
Yes, of course! I'm very particular about these matters.

604
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,400
But, I still worry for you.

605
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,700
If it will affect the budding love

606
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,000
both of you are having now.

607
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,800
You thought it through...

608
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,500
So why have you come then?!

609
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,200
- Mm...? 
- Oh, yeah...

610
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,200
After a big fight, I'm hungry... I have to eat something.

611
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,600
Hey hey hey!

612
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,400
You will get indigestion if you eat while you are feeling down!

613
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,100
Take a shower to relax first.

614
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,000
What are you saying?! I have showered already!

615
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,500
You quarreled with your husband, right?

616
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,300
You will be angry after you have quarreled.

617
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,300
And when you are angry, you perspire.

618
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,100
Ooh, okay...

619
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:26,900
True that.

620
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,700
Ooh, yeah. Okay.

621
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,850
Ah...

622
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,450
Jin Ho!

623
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:37,850
Jin Ho?

624
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,550
Ask her to go home quickly!

625
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,900
She just had a fight with her husband, 
how can I ask her to go back?

626
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,900
Then you expect me to hide in here till when?

627
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,100
Jin Ho, just go out quietly...

628
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,500
You have to go sooner or later anyway.

629
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,050
Wish I was gay now!

630
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,450
So you can stay with me?

631
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,300
Kae In, that thingy-

632
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,000
Hello.

633
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Hello.

634
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,300
I didn't see anything. Please continue.

635
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,450
It's all right if you sleep here too.

636
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:21,250
It's okay, I'll get going.

637
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,200
Just a second.

638
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,450
Excuse me, if...

639
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:27,400
I interrupted what you guys were doing before I came in...

640
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,700
Looks like something almost did happen..

641
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,500
You!! Sleep on the floor tonight!

642
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,500
I didn't do anything but I'm so tired...

643
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,550
These are the materials for the Dam Arts Center Project that Director Choi wanted.

644
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:18,250
I will inform the Director.

645
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:21,350
If Professor Park had accepted the job from the start,

646
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:25,850
I think it will be very successful.

647
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,850
Why would the Director

648
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:29,800
give the Dam Arts Project

649
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,400
to Professor Park to handle?

650
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,550
I think it is because...

651
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,800
he designed Sang Go Jae.

652
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,800
That is why he wants to do that.

653
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,350
Sang Go Jae?

654
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,750
Hye Mi...

655
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:54,400
Are you really going to marry Jin Ho oppa?

656
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,550
I don't have much time left, so please answer.

657
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:01,450
I made a pit-stop here before I'm headed to the airport.

658
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:03,050
Are you leaving?

659
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:06,250
I cannot accept Jin Ho oppa marrying someone else.

660
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,000
Why have I come to Korea? Why have I come to this place?

661
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,250
I gave up my parents, friends and studies.

662
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:15,100
All because of Jin Ho oppa.

663
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,600
I am sorry.

664
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,400
I didn't know it would turn out to be like that.

665
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,500
Sorry?

666
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,150
I don't know how will I understand your term "Sorry".

667
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:27,950
I am really going crazy!

668
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,850
In this world,

669
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:35,300
it will be impossible for another woman to love Jin Ho oppa like I do.

670
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,150
Compared to you Hye Mi,

671
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:41,200
I wouldn't know if I love Jin Ho more than you.

672
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,850
I do not have the confidence to answer this question.

673
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:45,300
See?

674
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,500
But...

675
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,450
Jin Ho,

676
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:52,400
although I thought he was gay,

677
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,650
when he proposed to me in front of his mother,

678
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,500
Jin Ho...

679
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,750
when Jin Ho said that...

680
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,500
even if he was gay...

681
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,400
I would've married him.

682
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,250
That's how much

683
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:18,150
I wanted to stay by Jin Ho's side.

684
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,350
I don't care...

685
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:23,100
Geez...

686
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,600
Yes.

687
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,500
Yes, I understand.

688
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,500
Then please do that.

689
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,150
Yes...

690
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,700
Hye Mi.

691
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,400
Is something wrong?

692
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:59,150
During that time, you had feelings for Jin Ho as well, right?

693
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,700
Just forget it.

694
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,000
Since everything is over now.

695
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,150
Now his mother isn't thinking about me,

696
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:10,600
but rather the other woman.

697
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,500
It advanced faster than I expected.

698
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,750
Even if Jin Ho was gay,

699
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:17,100
the woman said she would've married him.

700
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,850
I'm going crazy.

701
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,850
It's like the 2 of them are really in love!

702
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:22,850
How could people see Jin Ho...

703
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,250
as someone gay?

704
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:27,000
I also thought that was strange...

705
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,200
Don't you think there is a problem somewhere here?

706
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,800
I think Jin Ho is being kept in the dark about something.

707
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,400
Don't you hear that?

708
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,500
This woman...

709
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,200
Do you know her?

710
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,200
She has been my friend for 10 years.

711
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,950
By chance...

712
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:45,700
has she returned back to a man named Han Chang Ryul?

713
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,350
Han Chang Ryul?

714
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:50,050
That son of the man who took 
 everything when Jin Ho's father died?

715
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:52,550
How do you know that household?

716
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:56,650
If things didn't go wrong, he would've been my husband.

717
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:57,650
Ah! Really?

718
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:02,350
However, everything went terribly wrong 
during the wedding ceremony.

719
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:06,400
Kae In spoiled the plans.

720
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,250
Why?

721
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:10,800
Kae In was Chang Ryul's girlfriend.

722
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,400
That's how the two of us...

723
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,700
broke up.

724
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,100
But...

725
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,550
although it hasn't been long since the two of us broke up...

726
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:22,400
these two people

727
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,600
have been meeting up again.

728
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,350
Ah... Then...

729
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,300
You are saying that Park Kae In is two-timing both of them?

730
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,600
Jin Ho oppa and that Han Chang Ryul person?

731
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,000
Aigoo! You are here.

732
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,750
I got too impatient waiting for Chang Ryul.

733
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,350
Well since it isn't much,

734
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:47,850
please accept these gifts, theres no meaning to them.

735
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:49,950
Take it that  I'm substituting for my son.

736
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:51,650
Please open the door.

737
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:53,300
- What are you doing not bringing them in? 
- Wait.

738
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,150
Ah... No.

739
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:54,850
I...

740
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:56,000
I can't let you.

741
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,250
I...

742
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,300
I broke up with Chang Ryul.

743
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,100
No.

744
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,700
I've never got back together again with him.

745
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:09,000
A relationship is bound to have quarrels.

746
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,500
But my son,

747
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:15,000
although he may not know how much wrong he has done to you,

748
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I would like to apologize on his behalf.

749
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,400
I haven't taught my son well, so it is my fault.

750
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,000
Please be magnanimous, and forgive him for his past actions.

751
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,300
Bring them in.

752
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,200
Wait... I...

753
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,900
Mother...

754
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,500
How...

755
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,200
Sister-in-law,

756
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,700
what brings you here?

757
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,200
I don't believe it...

758
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,600
Do you know my future daughter-in-law?

759
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,800
Daughter-in-law?

760
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,100
Ah... Then...

761
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,300
M-Mother...

762
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,500
Mother?

763
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,000
Why are you calling her mother?

764
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,100
Mother...

765
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,000
I will explain everything to you later.

766
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,900
Don't call me mother.

767
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,400
Mother!

768
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,200
Mother!

769
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,600
Mother!

770
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,600
Mother...

771
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,800
Oppa, how could you choose that woman?

772
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,500
That father of that household brought her stuff-

773
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,700
You just stay still.

774
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,800
Mother...

775
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,300
I will explain everything to you.

776
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,600
I will not allow the both of you to be together even on my deathbed!

777
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,700
She can't be it.

778
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,600
If you want to see me die,

779
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,400
then do as you wish.

780
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:02,200


781
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,900
Give me an explanation!

782
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,300
Give me an explanation!!!

783
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,700
The Park's daughter...

784
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,100
and that Jin Ho's mother...

785
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,100
and why she called her mother?!

786
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,400
Why?

787
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,300
Why?!

788
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,100
How is... mother?

789
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,300
She must've been very angry, right?

790
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,500
How did Chang Ryul's father

791
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,700
find you and give you presents?

792
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,800
It wasn't something I could've prevented.

793
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,700
He just came directly.

794
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,300
That's why you shouldn't have any form of interactions with them.

795
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,800
That's because of you.

796
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,600
I tried so hard to forget you... So I tried to distract myself with thoughts of revenge.

797
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:04,400
Then you should've said that at the very beginning.

798
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,500
"Because I like you, that's why I distracted myself with other things."

799
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,600
How could I say that?!

800
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,300
Then why didn't you tell me that 
you weren't gay from the very beginning?

801
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,400
Then things wouldn't have gone this far.

802
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,800
Fine! Everything was my fault from the very start.

803
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,600
No...

804
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,700
That's not what I meant...

805
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,600
Anyway this was started by me,

806
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,400
I will resolve it.

807
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,700
J...Jin Ho!

808
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,400
She and Chang Ryul,

809
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,600
they'd broken up a long time ago.

810
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,600
Just a month...

811
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,400
Just a month ago...

812
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:46,000
It was she who broke up Chang Ryul's marriage.

813
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,600
I understand how angry you may be right now.

814
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:49,600
Then...

815
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,800
let's not talk about this anymore.

816
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,700
However...

817
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,600
I was the first one to like her,

818
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,600
and I was the first one to truly love her.

819
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,200
Jin Ho!

820
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,800
If she was still together with Han Chang Ryul,

821
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,800
I would never have fallen for her.

822
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,400
I'm your son, but do you not know me?

823
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,400
I don't like her.

824
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,600
No matter what you say,

825
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,200
having relations with the Han family...

826
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,300
I do not wish for her to be my daughter-in-law.

827
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,500
Mother...

828
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:27,600
I can't exist if it isn't that woman.

829
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,500
How does Han Chang Ryul that rascal keep being a pest to you?

830
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,100
Ah! Geez...

831
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,800
Jin Ho's words were right.

832
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,800
I did wrong.

833
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,700
I took revenge as an excuse and caused trouble for him too.

834
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:49,850
Why are you speaking of the past?

835
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:52,800
You guys will be fine again.

836
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,850
If the both of you persevere, 
everything will be all right.

837
00:51:55,850 --> 00:52:00,700
Jin  Ho was very upset and stormed out.

838
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:04,650
What shall I say to his mom?

839
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,450
I called Sang Jun.

840
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:10,900
I didn't really want to have any contact with him.

841
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:14,850
But because of you, I called him.

842
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:17,350
What did he say Jin Ho was doing right now?

843
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:19,250
He's not in the office.

844
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,100
Oh! Right!

845
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:25,600
Jeju Island! You go too!

846
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,400
He's going there.

847
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,900
Explain things clearly to him when you are there.

848
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,000
No, no.

849
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,300
Just get pregnant first before marriage.

850
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:36,400
That way even Jin Ho's mother can't refuse.

851
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,050
Oh! Yes.

852
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:51,800
Director Choi is your savior indeed.

853
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,050
He is helping you out,

854
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:56,000
when you really need it!

855
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,400
I don't know if me going there is a good idea.

856
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,000
Jin Ho... He probably wouldn't have wanted me to go here.

857
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,600
Hey... Geez...

858
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:08,100
He will be so moved when he sees you there!

859
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,100
But Kae In...

860
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,600
why am I going?

861
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,050
I wanted to ask you too... Why are you going?

862
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,100
Hey!

863
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,250
Why aren't you coming down? Come down.

864
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,100
Oh! Yeah!

865
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,500
I'm going down right now.

866
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,500
I'll be right there.

867
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,450
Yeah, I got it.

868
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:38,850
Oh, Joon Hyuk's dad is calling so hang up.

869
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:40,550
Yeah...

870
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:47,850
Oh, Sang Jun.

871
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,400
Kae In's down at the lobby right now.

872
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,300
What about Jin Ho?

873
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,500
This unni is really...

874
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,100
Who am I?

875
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,200
But Jin Ho doesn't know this and he went downstairs.

876
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,600
Shouldn't we be there with them?

877
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,500
Ah! Forget it!

878
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:02,500
Why would we want to be the third wheel when they are dating?

879
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,500
Those two will figure things out by themselves.

880
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:09,700
I am free now. How about a drink?

881
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,700
I feel like drinking.

882
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:40,700
Don't you think you like me too much?

883
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,700
Young Sun... that evil witch...

884
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,700
I'm here for work.

885
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:54,200
Director Choi invited me here!

886
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,200
Excuses.

887
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,900
It's not an excuse.

888
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,100
Let's go outside and fight.

889
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
What's going to happen to your mother?

890
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,400
It won't be easy for her to accept when she's this angry.

891
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,200
Just trust me.

892
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,400
How can I?

893
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,100
I don't think she'd actually just stab her son to death.

894
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,400
I told her that if it wasn't you, then I'd die.

895
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:25,800
Jin Ho...

896
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:28,600
Don't be so thankful... That's just the way it came out.

897
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,400
Do you really think I'll die because of you?

898
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,500
Don't joke around.

899
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,400
I'm really worried to death.

900
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,100
I'm not joking.

901
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,000
I have no plans on breaking up with you.

902
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,400
So, don't worry about it.

903
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,400
Shall we pretend we are still fighting?

904
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,500
What?

905
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,800
Let Sang Jun and Young Sun be fooled. It'll be fun.

906
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,300
You are real bad!

907
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,000
Hello.

908
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,800
Director.

909
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,400
The meeting with the Japanese investors finished early, so...

910
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,200
I came as quickly as I could.

911
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,200
You have a seminar, right?

912
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:35,800
Yes.

913
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,400
How about you, Park Kae In?

914
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,600
Did you take a look at the theme parks?

915
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,500
Not yet.

916
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,100
Should we... go for dinner together?

917
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,000
I...

918
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,000
I have something to tell you.

919
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,000
Right now?

920
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,500
Yes.

921
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,000
Well then, let's go.

922
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:10,400
Let me handle it. I'll get going first.

923
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,000
Kae In...

924
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,600
Chang Ryul,

925
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:46,200
let's discuss some matters outside.

926
00:57:54,100 --> 00:58:13,400

927
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,600
Is the seminar of help to you?

928
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,700
Thank you for treating me so kindly everytime.

929
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:32,300
Don't be thankful.

930
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:38,100
I just want to think that I have selected the right man.

931
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,800
If you are successful,

932
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,800
we will be in contact very often.

933
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,300
But...

934
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,900
what is it you want to tell me?

935
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,400
- I... 
- Oh,

936
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,800
Jin Ho, you like Kandinsky, right?

937
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:04,400
It wasn't easy finding his paintings.

938
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,300
Come to my room later and take them.

939
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:11,800
Err no, take if from the lobby reception.

940
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,300
I am sorry.

941
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,800
I cannot receive the gift.

942
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,700
There...

943
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:19,000
is no meaning to the gifts.

944
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Receive them please.

945
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,300
Can you receive them for me?

946
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,200
I knew it beforehand that you will dislike this.

947
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,800
But...

948
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,400
just looking at your expression,

949
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,700
it makes me very sad.

950
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,400
I don't know what you want to say,

951
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,100
but just from your expression alone..

952
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:54,000
it won't be good news.

953
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,900
Save it...

954
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,700
for next time.

955
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,000
Director Choi...

956
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,800
Your father,

957
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:18,900
I hope he won't visit me again at my home.

958
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,800
Okay.

959
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,700
I'll do that.

960
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:26,100
I have caused you a lot of trouble in the past.

961
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,700
I have caused you a lot of trouble in the past.

962
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,800
The revenge matter...

963
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,700
and meeting you again,

964
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,600
I am sorry.

965
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:43,000
You didn't take revenge on me.

966
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:49,000
I'm gonna go.

967
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,400
You'll be happy, right?

968
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:02,100
Will you be happy with that jerk, Jin Ho?

969
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:05,800
Yes.

970
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:10,600
Then, that's enough.

971
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,900
That's fine.

972
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,300
I am really sorry.

973
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,800
What are you so sorry about?

974
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,700
I...

975
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:43,500
I am in love with Park Kae In.

976
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,100
Chang Ryul!

977
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:06,800
Chang Ryul!
