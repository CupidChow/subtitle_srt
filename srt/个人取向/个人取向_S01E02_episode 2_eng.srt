1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,100
Episode 2

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,600
Ka... Ka... Kae In?

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,100
Why... why are... you here?

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,300
Seriously?!  Hey! Kim In Hee!

5
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,800
Secretary Kim! Secretary Kim!

6
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,900
Let go!

7
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,900
You evil jerks, let go!

8
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,100
Get out.

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,900
Isn't it that woman again?

10
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,100
Let go.

11
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,800
There must have been a misunderstanding. 
The ceremony will continue.

12
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,300
Hyung, Director Choi is leaving.

13
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,700
In Hee!

14
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,100
In Hee!

15
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,200
In Hee, hold on.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,900
Are you happy now?

17
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,500
I'm sorry that I messed up your wedding.

18
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,900
That's okay...

19
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,100
I won't be sorry from now on, either.

20
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,000
Why you little...

21
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,600
You have to be sorry for the rest of your life, bitch!

22
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,500
Let's go!

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,200
Hey!

24
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,700
In Hee, are you okay?

25
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,800
Oh, hyung.

26
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,100
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,700
I was in a hurry to leave and I accidentally...

28
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,900
I'm really sorry.

29
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,800
It's okay.

30
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,500
I see you've left your contact information.

31
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,000
Please just go.

32
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,700
The Dream Art Center presentation.

33
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,100
I enjoyed your speech.

34
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,400
My schedule is busy today...

35
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,000
why don't you contact me around Tuesday?

36
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,600
I have something to say too!

37
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,900
I'm in the same situation as you...

38
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,800
Listen to me... I, too...

39
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,300
In Hee...

40
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,500
Hey! Wait a minute! 
 Hey!

41
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,900
I really told Kae In! 
I even gave her a wedding invitation!

42
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,000
Forget it.

43
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,600
Whenever you open your mouth, you lie.

44
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,200
Just look at all the embarrassment you've caused me.

45
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
Give me the ticket.

46
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,100
Ticket?

47
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,900
Right! The ticket.

48
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,900
We can do the wedding again later.

49
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,200
Let's go on a honeymoon first.

50
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,600
You think I'm crazy enough to go on a honeymoon with you?

51
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,800
Hey! Wait a minute!

52
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,600
What do you mean? We're going together!

53
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,600
I must have been crazy!

54
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,500
Forget it...

55
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,700
In Hee!

56
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,400
In Hee, wait!

57
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,000
Well sir,

58
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,500
at least you didn't get your face slapped.

59
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,500
What kind of a man can't keep his girl under control and creates such a fiasco?

60
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Father...

61
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Ok, ok.

62
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,700
Ohhh okay, thank you.

63
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,200
The project was originally going 
to a firm of foreign architects, 
but Mr Choi intervened to stop that.

64
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,500
He insisted that foreign firms had to
 compete on the same terms in an open contest.

65
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Really?

66
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,100
If it's a fair play, it's good for us.

67
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,600
Oh boy, we were just going to butt in
 without knowing anything...

68
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
You ARE really something.

69
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,700
This is only the beginning.

70
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,200
You're already back from the wedding?

71
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,300
Hey kid, what are you doing here? Get out!

72
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,300
You're not really going to fire me
 just for losing a drinking bet?

73
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,700
Hyung, get rid of Tae Hoon's desk.

74
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,000
Okay, let's get rid of it.

75
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Where are all the office staff?

76
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,500
No way! It can't be like this!

77
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,600
If you throw me out, you'll regret it

78
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,800
Then do whatever you want. 
But there will be no salary. Forever.

79
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,400
Salary? No way!

80
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,700
Hyung, hyung!

81
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,100
But I have a piece of information. 
 A top-class tip-off!

82
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,400
Don't need it, bye-bye!

83
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,700
But it is a secret plan to win the Dam Art Gallery contest!

84
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,500
Have you ever heard of a house called Sang Go Jae?

85
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,800
- What? 
 - Sang Go Jae.

86
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,720
Sang Go Jae. Sang-Go-Jae.

87
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,000
Isn't that what it says?

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,350
Doesn't that character say  'Ko'?

89
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,500
It's not "Ko", hyungnim.
It's Hyang Oh Jae, hyungnim.

90
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,100
Kae In, answer my call.

91
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,100
Kae In...

92
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
 

93
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,300
Please leave a message.

94
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,500
I'm sorry, Kae In.

95
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,100
Without you knowing,

96
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,900
I borrowed an extra ￦ 10,000,000 ($ 10,000).

97
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,900
Some famous star did their commercial,

98
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,500
so I thought it was a bank or something.

99
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,800
But hey,

100
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,400
they just had the facade of a bank.

101
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,600
I... will definitely pay you back.

102
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,900
Sorry.

103
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,100
Evil jerks... I trusted them and used the money...

104
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,300
Evil jerk! I trusted you and gave the money.

105
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,800
Hyungnim! Here is the rat!

106
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,000
Get him!

107
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,100
Get him!

108
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,400
GET HIM!

109
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,800
Han Chang Ryul...

110
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,000
Was that your best effort?

111
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,300
 

112
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,400
 

113
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,500
Put the house on auction? No way...

114
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,300
Hey, Lee Won Ho! Answer the call!

115
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,300
Hey!

116
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:06,000
So, Tae Hoon... You're saying that Director Choi who heads the MS Group, which is the parent company of the Dam Art Gallery,

117
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,400
is your dad's friend.

118
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,700
Okay, from here a new person comes into the picture.

119
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Director Choi was completely smitten by a traditional Korean house called Sang Go Jae built by Professor Park Chul Han.

120
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,200
So he invited Professor Park to head up the Dam Art Gallery,

121
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,400
but Professor Park turned him down.

122
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,100
That's right.

123
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,300
So you're saying... Director Choi still has a special interest  in that house called Sang Go Jae?

124
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,500
That is exactly it.

125
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
Hey Jin Ho,

126
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,300
if what he says is true, this is a sure thing for us.

127
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,300
Ah, I said it was true.

128
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,900
First, let's find out more about Sang Go Jae.

129
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,310
But...

130
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,960
who's your father that he's friends with a corporation chairman?

131
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,440
Really?

132
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,720
Really, you're seriously the son of that family?

133
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,360
Oppa!

134
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,820
Hi, Hye Mi.

135
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,450
Aigoo...

136
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,080
Hye Mi!

137
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,150
Wow, is today a special day?

138
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,180
Yup! The day I go on a date with Jin Ho oppa.

139
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,110
- What is she saying?
 - Stop fooling around. Go home if you're done shopping.

140
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:15,430
No, you'll have to go on a date with me today.

141
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,100
Just wait and see.

142
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,500
Hey, Lee Won Ho!

143
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,400
Father?

144
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,500
Why are you ringing at this hour? 
Isn't it around dawn over there?

145
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,200
Ye...Yes, how have you been?

146
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,500
Am I having problems?

147
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,900
N-No, none at all.

148
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,100
Y-Yes...well... It's been a while since we've talked...

149
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,400
May...?

150
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,000
Weren't you originally coming back in August?

151
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,300
Ahh, I see.

152
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,500
I'll see you then... Yes...

153
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,400
What do I do?

154
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,900
What do I do?

155
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,600
If father comes home...

156
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,600
I'm dead meat.

157
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,600
Hey...hey come to your senses.

158
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,100
There's got to be a way.

159
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,000
What should I do? What should I do?

160
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,500
Regular Savings Plan...

161
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,200
...that's $2,250...

162
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,700
...if I add this... And this...

163
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,300
In Hee!

164
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,200
Kim In Hee!

165
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,400
Young Sun...

166
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,100
What do I do?

167
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,610
Happy birthday.

168
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:32,110
Please blow the candles. Don't forget to make a wish.

169
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,740
We could've done this at home since you're so busy. Why bother coming out?

170
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,940
There are too many candles.

171
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,980
That's too much.

172
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,590
I don't look like I'm in my thirties.

173
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,330
Who says?

174
00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:00,260
You have no idea. If I walk around with you locking arms, people whisper, "Are they lovers?"

175
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,710
They whisper like crazy.

176
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,840
Their eyes are messed up. My gosh!

177
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,260
Mother, did you make a wish?

178
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,420
There's not much to it.

179
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,620
You two getting engaged soon.

180
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,190
Mother, your birthday gift.

181
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,650
My gosh! Thank you.

182
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,500
Your presence is a gift enough.

183
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,450
Why bother with this, too?

184
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:39,990
The sensible son, do you have a gift for her?

185
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,010
Hi, Sang Jun hyung.

186
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,550
Really?

187
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:55,130
Okay, we'll talk when I get back. Did you make a reservation to that spa?

188
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:58,500
I see. All right. Thanks.

189
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,140
Mother, you wanted to go to a spa, right?

190
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,610
Go with Hye Mi.

191
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,190
- It's your birthday gift.
 - Gosh...

192
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,340
I can't say anything with you around.

193
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,960
I just mentioned it. I can't believe you remember it.

194
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,420
I'll see you at home later. Something urgent came up.

195
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,580
Really?

196
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,420
Hye Mi, please take care.

197
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,300
Oppa...

198
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,080
Hi, Sang Joon hyung.

199
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,590
Make a reservation at that spa.

200
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,200
Kae In.

201
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,200
Park Kae In.

202
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,100
What are you doing there without any of the lights on?

203
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,600
Cheer up!

204
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,300
You came.

205
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,700
Seeing you're stuffing yourself,
 I guess you have a tenacious hold on life.

206
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:11,700
Eat up.

207
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,600
I have no one but you, Young Sun.

208
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,000
You little rascal... We're bosom buddies, aren't we?

209
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,300
That's why I want to ask...

210
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,800
Umm...

211
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,200
Do you have any money you could lend me?

212
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,300
Wow, this looks delicious. 
Did you use those herbs I brought you before?

213
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,600
I thought we weren't strangers.

214
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,500
Well, strictly speaking... there's nothing between us.

215
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,800
We're not a couple or something.

216
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,700
Just go then, you wench!

217
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,900
Just tell your father what happened.

218
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,600
Don't you know what my relationship with my father is like?

219
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,500
Why oh why did your father have to love 
your mother the way he did?

220
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,000
Lee Young Sun.

221
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,500
Look, I didn't mean it that way... It's just...

222
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,200
...you and your father are all that's left of your family,
 so why do you give each other such a hard time?

223
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,600
Sorry.

224
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,100
Just at the time Sang Go Jae was finished, 
Park Chul Han lost his wife.

225
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,600
Since then, almost 30 years ago now, 
not a single outsider has ever been allowed in.

226
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:36,400
But don't you think the exterior is very simple, 
considering that Professor Park designed it?

227
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,700
What on earth sparked Director Choi's interest?

228
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,700
It seems Professor Park is in the UK 
right now on a faculty exchange program.

229
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,200
So, who's actually living there?

230
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,800
His only daughter is living there now.

231
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,300
Hold on.

232
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,800
A daughter means a woman. 
And seeing how she's a woman...

233
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,700
That's your opening, Jin Ho.

234
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,200
Why let that handsome face and fine body go unused?

235
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,600
Let's exploit your good looks.

236
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,800
Stop speaking nonsense and focus.

237
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,600
Why is this nonsense? It's exactly the answer we're looking for.

238
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,900
Also,

239
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,100
they say Professor Park's wife was a stunning beauty.

240
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,500
What if the daughter takes after the mother?

241
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,100
Drop that idea. I'll be making my way 
over to the Dam Art Gallery tomorrow.

242
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,300
You're the one who's keen on beautiful women, 
so go to Sang Go Jae and spy out the land.

243
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,500
I really wanted...

244
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,000
...to get recognition from Father,

245
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:22,000
so I tried really hard.

246
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,200
But in the end, here I am like this again...

247
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,300
But...

248
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,500
today, I can cry for once, can't I?

249
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,800
Let me just

250
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:12,000
...abandon myself to the pain for this one day only.

251
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,200
Then I'll shake it all off and stand tall again, Mom.

252
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,900
I'm your brave daughter, Kae In.

253
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,200
No, no, I'm 29 years old.

254
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,400
Yes. No.

255
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
No, it's not that.

256
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,900
Fortune teller, what will happen to me now?

257
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,900
Wait!

258
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,000
I see it. I see it.

259
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,200
See what?

260
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,800
An important visitor is approaching you from the East.

261
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,800
They're here. Yes, they're here.

262
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,500
Where?  Where?

263
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,600
The person coming from the East today
 is the one who will open the gate to your fortune.

264
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,900
No matter what, hold on to him tightly.

265
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,400
The person from the East.

266
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,500
East...

267
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,000
This...

268
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,600
It's the important visitor!

269
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,100
Important visitor, sir!

270
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,300
You!

271
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,400
Y-You're...f-from the wedding yesterday...

272
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,100
No. I'm not.

273
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,500
What's this?

274
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,400
What's that woman doing here?

275
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,300
Could it be that... she's Professor Park's stunningly beautiful daughter?

276
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,600
Don't tell me...
Did you come from the East?

277
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,900
Our office is south of the river.

278
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,200
Aiiishhh...

279
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,000
You should separate from that pervert.

280
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,100
Your scheming is showing.

281
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,300
She's crazy. Totally gone.

282
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,900
Hello?

283
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,020
 Is this Creative Director Park Kae In, of Kae In Design's? 

284
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,490
Yes.

285
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,800
I'm Park Kae In. Who is this?

286
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,600
This is Nice Department Store.

287
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,200
Do you think you can come in right now?

288
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,500
Yes.

289
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,500
I'll leave right now, yes!

290
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,900
We're sorry.

291
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,500
I really think it's an extraordinary piece of art, but...

292
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,400
the higher ups say it's not marketable.

293
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,500
I've been ordered to cancel the order.

294
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,300
Listen, I'll fix it.

295
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,800
Whatever you want, it's all possible.

296
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,800
N-no. It's not a matter of modifying it.

297
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,700
I'm sorry.

298
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,600
Wa-wait!

299
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,800
Yes.

300
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,900
What would you like to eat?

301
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,000
Ah, yes.

302
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:19,200
Jin Ho!

303
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,600
Do you know this person?

304
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,200
"Know him" isn't the word!

305
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,200
His father and I were the very best of friends back in the old days.

306
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,600
You rascal! Didn't I tell you to think of our house 
as yours and come and visit us often?

307
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,800
It's been a long time since we've met.

308
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,200
Yes, that's true. But what brings you here?

309
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,100
I just had some business to do.

310
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,800
Ah, is that so? Well, we're about to go to lunch right now.

311
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Is it alright if he comes along?

312
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,100
He's like a son to me.

313
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,600
No, thank you.

314
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,900
I'll come back again another time.

315
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,000
Yes, I think that would be best.

316
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You're going to enter the contest 
for the Dam Arts Center project, I believe?

317
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,800
Yes.

318
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,000
I'll look forward to seeing your entry.

319
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,100
Let's go.

320
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,000
Ahh, yeah.

321
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:15,600
A young man full of passion is a good thing, but...

322
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,400
you should be able to tell the difference 
between passion and foolhardiness.

323
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,200
I'm not saying it in particular to you.

324
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,500
 Wow Daddy! Is this our new house? 

325
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,700
 That's right. 

326
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,100
Hey, Director Choi is leaving with Mr. Han.

327
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,900
Are they trying to fix this like the Dream Art Center?

328
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,100
What's going on with Sang Go Jae?

329
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,200
Oh hey... don't even talk about it.

330
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,100
We've got a magnitude 12 earthquake situation here.

331
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,300
What do you mean by that?

332
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,400
That girl is the daughter.

333
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,700
The girl who messed up Chang Ryul's wedding,

334
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,700
the one who makes strange furniture, 
the egotist, she's the professor's daughter.

335
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,400
What?

336
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,400
Sang Go Jae has never been opened 
to anyone at all for thirty years.

337
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:48,400
You think a woman as crazy as that would let us look round?

338
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,400
Let's not try it,

339
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,800
let's just give up for once.

340
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,300
Hyung.

341
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,500
I'm determined to do this.

342
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,300
I really wanted to invite you!

343
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,300
Mom, did Dad really leave things like that?

344
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,200
He's too much.

345
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,200
That's just too much.

346
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,500
Huh?

347
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:13,500
That...it's because the house hasn't been cleaned yet. 
When I clean it, you may come over.

348
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,300
Yes.

349
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,000
By the way, are you regularly checking your blood sugar?

350
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,100
Yes, the brown rice is very good for you. 
You have to eat continuously.

351
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,600
It's Yun Hee Dong's mother.

352
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,700
Mom, I got a call from Yun Hee Dong's mom right now.

353
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,000
I'll call you later, Mom.

354
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,300
Yes.

355
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,000
Yes, Mom.

356
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,000
Of course, the wedding was fantastic!

357
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,500
Honeymo...

358
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,700
Since I was so busy...

359
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,100
we'll go on a honeymoon later.

360
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,700
What? Because of my wedding, 
you decided to get botox?!

361
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,000
You're pretty enough without that.

362
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Where?

363
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,600
Mom, it's a call from Dad. Yes, I'll call you back.

364
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,000
Yes.

365
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,400
Yes, Father.

366
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,300
Where have you been cooped up?

367
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,700
You said you hated the very sight of me!

368
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,500
What?

369
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,100
Arrrgh...

370
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,300
Jin Ho, that rascal.

371
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,200
He seems to be interested in the Dam Arts Center.

372
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,800
Ehh?!

373
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,200
The kid's going to have another go?

374
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:43,100
This time, the method we used with 
the Dream Art Center isn't going to work.

375
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,600
As the man who inherited the MS Group,

376
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,400
there's nothing Mr Choi really wants
 that he hasn't got already.

377
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:56,000
Father, I will never lose to Jin Ho, 
 so you don't need to worry.

378
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,000
And...about the situation with In Hee... I'll-

379
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,300
Don't even mention it, you punk!

380
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:20,000
Do some research on Jeon Jin Ho 
and the people around him.

381
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,200
Background check?

382
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,000
You know the sort of thing...

383
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,100
his regular drinking places, relationships with women,

384
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,200
character flaws, stuff like that.

385
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,600
Jeon Jin Ho.

386
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,500
Don't fall apart just yet.

387
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,300
This time, let's fight properly.

388
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,600
Ew, fundamental measures are necessary. 
What to do?

389
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,200
I'm going to catch Lee Won Ho, that jerk.

390
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,500
How can you catch him when 
he's determined to stay hidden?

391
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,900
So what do I do?

392
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,600
Why not just rent out In Hee's room?

393
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
Are you crazy?

394
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,700
I got a loan off that house! How can I let an outsider in Sang Go Jae?!

395
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,400
If I let a stranger in, my father will kill me!

396
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,200
But taking in a stranger would solve the loan problem. 
Any other ideas?

397
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,800
I don't.

398
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,500
Let's put it on the market before we go back.

399
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,400
Huh?

400
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,100
Who's that?

401
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,800
We're there. Wake up!

402
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,100
- Won Ho! It's Won Ho! 
 - Won Ho!

403
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,300
- Won Ho! 
 - Ahjussi! Let us out here!

404
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,400
HEY!  LEE WON HO!

405
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,000
HEY! YOU!

406
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,200
YOU!

407
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,600
Kae In!  Fighting!

408
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,600
HEY! Stop there! I won't hit you!

409
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,100
HEY!  LEE WON HO!

410
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,700
Hey!  Stop! You hear me?

411
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,100
HEY! YOU!

412
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,700
You sure have complicated relationships with men.

413
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,600
Oh!  What are you doing here?

414
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,000
Hey!!! You!!

415
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,500
Are you okay?

416
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:02,100
I'm okay, but that man there! Catch him!

417
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,100
HEYYY!!!

418
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,500
Hey, you!

419
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,700
If you ran away...

420
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,100
You...

421
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,300
Hey you!

422
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:47,100
￦10,000,000 ($10,000 in US)
What happened to it?

423
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,200
How much do you have left? 
You didn't use it all, right?

424
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,900
You have to have something left over. 
Hurry up and hand it over. Quickly!

425
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,300
Hurry!

426
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,000
I used it all.

427
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,600
Hey!  Hey!  Lee Won Ho!

428
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,300
What am I going to do, Lee Won Ho? 
 What am I going to do?

429
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,800
Haven't you even been eating?

430
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,800
Eat slowly.

431
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,200
Or you'll have vomiting and diarrhea like crazy.

432
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,700
You're the one who gave me vomiting and diarrhea.

433
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,300
Shut up and just eat.

434
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,700
Before I hit you.

435
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,500
So... do you really have no money?

436
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:46,800
My father is coming back 3 months earlier.
  What am I going to do?

437
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:52,300
I even put the room In Hee used to have up for rent.

438
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,700
Rent a room at Sang Go Jae?

439
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm going to go to the washroom for a second.

440
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,600
Oh...hey... Make sure you come right back.

441
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,300
Are you stupid?

442
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,900
Can't you see he's running away?

443
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,400
Don't worry,

444
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,500
he wouldn't lie to me....

445
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,200
Hey!  Hey!  Lee Won Ho!

446
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,000
Yahhh!

447
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,200
Are you always like this?

448
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,800
What?

449
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,600
You just trust everyone like that?

450
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,700
It's kind of my chronic disease.

451
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,700
I think you have to go to the hospital.

452
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,500
It's fine. It'll be just a waste of money 
if I go to the hospital now...

453
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,100
Let's go to the hospital.

454
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,100
This is so strange.

455
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,800
Thank you.

456
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,300
Let's go. I'll drive you home.

457
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,600
So what's your motive, then?

458
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,100
Ehh?

459
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:42,200
Well, you caught Won Ho for me... 
and you paid the hospital bill...

460
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,100
and you're even dropping me off at my house.

461
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:49,900
You seem to have changed from how
 you were a while back and become kind to me.

462
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:54,100
In a situation like this, you're just supposed to say
   'Thank you.'  

463
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,500
I'll definitely pay you back for the hospital bill.

464
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:04,000
You don't have to pay me back with money.

465
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,400
If you're so grateful, 
how about showing me round Sang Go Jae?

466
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,300
How do you know the name of my house?

467
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,800
My father hasn't sent you here, has he?

468
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,000
I just read what it says on the signboard.

469
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,300
And how should I know who your father is?

470
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,900
Then...why do you want to look round my house?

471
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,800
Aren't you renting out a room?

472
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,000
Well...thank you for today.

473
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,500
I'll repay you for today some time in the future.

474
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,100
Come on, don't be like that. 
Just let me take a look at your house.

475
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,100
Our house is always closed to outsiders.

476
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,800
So goodbye now...

477
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,200
Then why did you put a room out for a rent?

478
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,700
Well, I don't plan to rent out a room to you.

479
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,900
Aishh...  He doesn't understand me at all.

480
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,500
Don't be so obstinate, at least consider it.

481
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,700
What is this?

482
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,900
Did you use your house as collateral for a loan?

483
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,400
This isn't any of your business.

484
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,800
It's obvious.

485
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,600
You're going to lose a house like this to a loan shark just for the sake of a little cash.

486
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,700
You are really...

487
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,400
Please mind your own business.

488
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,900
Why are you making this matter more difficult?

489
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,600
Can't you just put out a room for rent to me.

490
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,800
You have to take care of the immediate problem first. 
(D.T - You need to extinguish the immediate fire first)

491
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,200
But...

492
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,000
how can a girl who's living by herself let some random guy into her house?

493
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,400
 What girl are you talking about? 

494
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,500
 Is it you? 

495
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,100
You're back?

496
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,200
Yeah.

497
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,200
What about Won Ho?

498
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,200
I knew that was going to happen.

499
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,800
I've put that returned furniture at the back.

500
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,100
Thank you.

501
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,400
That person from before...

502
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,700
From the wedding ceremony...

503
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,900
Right?

504
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,300
But why are you two...?

505
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,600
Then... you may leave now.

506
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,300
Can you think about it again?

507
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,300
Hey.

508
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,500
Although I may not know what's going on right now,

509
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,000
I'll make things work out, so just wait here for a second.

510
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,200
What's wrong with your foot?

511
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,400
I fell chasing after Won Ho and sprained my ankle.

512
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,600
But,

513
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,400
did that man want to rent a room in this house?

514
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,100
That's right.

515
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,400
Then what's the problem?

516
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,100
That's good. Everything's worked out.

517
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:02,500
Huh?

518
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,600
You have a room. He has money.

519
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,700
Hey! Even so, how can I live in the same house with a man?

520
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,600
It's not like you don't know him, so why make such a big fuss?

521
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,500
And bear in mind that...

522
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,600
Bear in mind what?

523
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,200
Well, that whatever happens, that guy certainly won't try anything on you.

524
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,800
You won't be more than a rock or a tree in his eyes.

525
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,500
You think so?

526
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,700
Of course.

527
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,000
And what good would it do if you rent out to a female?

528
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,900
She might just betray you like In Hee.

529
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,100
For now, let him in.

530
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:37,300
And if you don't like him, just return his deposit and kick him out.

531
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,700
Kae In,

532
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:43,600
gay friends are really fantastic.

533
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,960
- Oh, this. I totally love it. 
- What's that?

534
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:19,220
Kae In's complexion needs some attention.

535
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,770
Right here.

536
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,600
Hey!

537
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,900
Come in and see the room.

538
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,100
Quick, quick!

539
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,600
Come in.

540
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,800
Please, look around.

541
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,400
Oh, you're back?

542
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,200
Yeah.

543
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:42,900
You're back?

544
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,100
How was it?

545
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,500
You didn't even get as far as the doormat, I'll bet.

546
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,300
I just got a room.

547
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,900
A room?

548
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,600
What room?

549
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,000
Are you planning to move out because of Hye Mi?

550
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,400
Well, that too.

551
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,600
Several reasons.

552
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,400
So where?

553
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,700
Where else?

554
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,900
Sang Go Jae, of course.

555
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,900
What? Sang Go Jae?

556
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,300
Really?

557
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,000
Hyung,

558
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,800
I'm going to move into Sang Go Jae.

559
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,100
How did you pull that off?

560
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,400
You've got to keep this a secret from Hye Mi and Tae Hoon. Understood?

561
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,100
I mean it!

562
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,800
Oh, of course!

563
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,200
You're really the best.

564
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,100
So, are you allowed to move in right away?

565
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,100
Of course.

566
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,700
Nice!

567
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,300
 ­ 

568
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,700
What is it?

569
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,500
What?

570
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,700
You can leave early.

571
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,000
- Goodbye! 
- Goodbye.

572
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,800
It's nothing.

573
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,600
You, look after the office.

574
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,700
What is it now?

575
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,800
Bravo!

576
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,000
Hey,

577
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,600
I'm not sure if you can applaud this.

578
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,100
I'm now going to live in a house with another man.

579
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,200
Anyway, it still doesn't feel right.

580
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,100
Ever since I met him, all of these bad things kept happening to me.

581
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,400
Hey, just forgive him.

582
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,200
He's good-looking.

583
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,100
What?

584
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:08,800
Kae In...

585
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,700
When someone looks like that, you gotta forgive him whatever he does to you.

586
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:15,200
Aw, if only I could grab those pert buttocks.

587
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,800
They sure were pert, like chock-full in my palms...

588
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,900
What did you do?

589
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,600
If there's something good, we have to share.

590
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,700
We're good friends, aren't we?

591
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,000
Come on, you're a middle-aged woman with a kid!

592
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,800
You'd better pull yourself together.

593
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,200
I'm only just letting him in because of the situation.

594
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,200
Finally you enter Sang Go Jae.

595
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,200
Our company's life depends on you.

596
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,300
That's why I came to live with that Miss Clumsy.

597
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,700
Whether she is Miss Clumsy or Miss Wild,

598
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,700
I think that lady is interested in you.

599
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,800
If she wasn't, do you think she'd let a man move into a house where she lives alone?

600
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,600
Yup. She would.

601
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,200
Ah, I've got to tell you...

602
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,500
Be careful.

603
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,900
Always leave your door ajar.

604
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,100
Watch your personal hygiene for when the inevitable happens.

605
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,700
And when it happens, you have to sacrifice your body for the sake of our company.

606
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,300
Stop saying horrible things!

607
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,400
I'm not saying horrible things.

608
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,700
You're a guy...

609
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,900
who's already had that woman's hands on your butt.

610
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,500
If you think of it that way, it'll be easier.

611
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,400
Hyung,

612
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:09,800
let me get in.

613
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,600
Alright. Because you're important.

614
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:29,900
Oh yeah.

615
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,400
Why did you come to our house?

616
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,600
Oh yes, yes...  Well... That... 
Well, it just happens that...

617
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,200
You two...

618
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,600
must have known each other a long time.

619
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,700
Sure, that's right. A real long time.

620
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:49,400
He's a bit picky, so it's not that easy to be around him.

621
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,500
But...

622
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,100
how did you know about us two?

623
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,800
Ah...well... I was a little curious...

624
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,200
But... you can't take interest in our Jin Ho...

625
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,100
Hyung, stop talking about weird nonsense.

626
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,400
You two are too obvious.

627
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,500
Well, there aren't that many rules you have to follow,

628
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,500
but you definitely can't take pictures of the house. My father hates that.

629
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,200
And we'll share the use of the fridge and the washing machine.

630
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,100
That's about it.

631
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,400
Hold on a second.

632
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,200
There are a number of things I need you to pay attention to.

633
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,200
What?

634
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,000
The house is too messy right now.

635
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,800
While I'm living here, I expect you to always keep it clean.

636
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,600
You've got pots of instant noodles lying around all over the house.

637
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:52,000
Please keep your hands off any food I leave in the refrigerator.

638
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,500
And I hope you won't make the mistake of washing my clothes when you wash yours.

639
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:02,000
I believe you're civilized people here, right?

640
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,300
Ah, right then...

641
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,900
Let me make some things really clear then.

642
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,900
Mr. Jeon Jin Ho, please keep away from me, except your own room and the shared areas... If you break that rule...

643
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,000
What are you going to do?

644
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,700
I'll cut it off.

645
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,300
Ehh?

646
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,900
Cut what off?

647
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,200
Any part of your anatomy that crosses the line.

648
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,700
Oh, she's a real joker!

649
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,000
Well...

650
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,500
She has a great sense of humor!

651
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,400
Yes, yes.

652
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,100
Then...

653
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,100
- why don't we close the contract like this?
- Oh, sure.

654
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,600
- I hope we will have a good relationship.
- Yes, yes, let's do our best in that direction.

655
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,200
You punk.

656
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,700
Why are you pushing her buttons?

657
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,400
Don't you see this place is a mess?

658
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,900
She has no respect for the spirit of this house.

659
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,400
Ouch!

660
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,600
- Ow! 
- What?

661
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,700
What? What's wrong?

662
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,100
What? Let me see.

663
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:04,800
Oh boy, you got a scratch on your million-dollar thigh!

664
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,500
Hold on a second, where's the first-aid kit...

665
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,800
Forget it.

666
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:12,500
Hey, take off your pants. I'll put on the medicine.

667
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,900
I said it's fine.

668
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,400
In a relationship in which we saw everything off each other, are you embarrassed?

669
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,620
I said I don't want to.

670
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:20,200
It'll get infected.

671
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,400
What? You think I'm going to hurt you?

672
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,500
I'll do it carefully.

673
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,000
Oh boy, don't be such a crybaby.

674
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,200
Ow! Do it carefully!

675
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,700
I'm rubbing it carefully, so stop whining!

676
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,200
I'm doing it for you.

677
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,400
I'll go in more gently, okay?

678
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,700
Ahh, you punk!

679
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,800
Just be patient.

680
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,500
Eavesdropping like that, you dreadful woman!

681
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:47,000
Oh, you've really been blessed!

682
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,300
It must be true that you saved the nation in a previous existence.

683
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,400
I wanna move into Sang Go Jae too!

684
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:57,600
Just cause they're alone, they think they can do anything in there!
And with a man too, what are they doing anyway, really?

685
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,900
Whatever they're up to, you ought to be thankful for it.

686
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,200
In any case,

687
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,500
I feel so sorry for his partner.

688
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,400
Why? They really like each other.

689
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,600
Do you know how promiscuous he is?

690
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,900
The other night at the motel,

691
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,500
he was kicking up a tremendous racket with a huge beast of a man, it doesn't bear thinking about.

692
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,400
Oh, really?

693
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,400
But why were you at a motel?

694
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,100
Ah...Things just happened that way.

695
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,700
When will that beast of a man come calling?

696
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,000
I want to see him.

697
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,400
Anyways, I'm going to have to put my foot down firmly.

698
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,800
I'm not going to let him bring home men from here, there and everywhere.

699
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,200
Where does he think he is.

700
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,000
You mean girl!

701
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,100
Is love a sin?

702
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,800
Is it?!?!

703
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,400
I thought you were a respectable woman!

704
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,600
Oh!

705
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,200
Well, I'll be going now.

706
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,200
I'll be trusting you to take care of this guy.

707
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,700
Yes, well...of course.

708
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,300
You don't have to worry about it at all.

709
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,300
Bye.  I won't see you out.

710
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,200
Umm... But...

711
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,000
Where's... the other man?

712
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,900
Huh?

713
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:09,800
Umm...

714
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,600
Hey, Jeon Jin Ho.

715
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,000
There is one thing you have to keep in mind.

716
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,600
Hey!

717
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,200
Don't worry about her and keep going on.

718
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,500
- Huh? 
- Love is always on the move~

719
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,700
In Hee?

720
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,300
Why are you here?

721
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,600
This is our house.

722
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,200
Honey...

723
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,600
You came back.

724
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:10,100
Are you crazy, what makes you think this is your house?

725
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,600
Will you leave, please?

726
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:16,600
I've been kicked out, so I can't go back to my house.

727
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,700
And...this is a house that my dad bought for us.

728
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,300
How cheap you are!

729
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,200
Hey, get up!

730
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:23,700
What?

731
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,100
This bed, it was a present that Kae In gave me.

732
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:26,900
So, get up.

733
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,100
Gosh, you've a nerve!

734
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,600
If she'd known you were the one who'd stolen  her guy,

735
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:32,800
do you think she'd have given you this present?

736
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,400
But the same goes for you, seeing you were that guy!

737
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,100
Hey! This blanket is mine too!

738
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:38,100
So are the pajamas! Take them off!

739
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:39,700
Alright.

740
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,600
You think I won't take off the clothes if you tell me to?

741
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,900
Hey...well you're one dirty and selfish person...

742
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,400
-Hey! Hey! 
 -Take them off!

743
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,200
Take them all!

744
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,000
Here! Here!

745
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,300
You think I'm happy to see this?

746
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:53,200
Aigoo...even your underwear is ugly.

747
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:57,200
What's wrong with this?

748
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,600
Then what about you?

749
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,200
What are you wearing underneath? You're probably wearing the lingerie I bought for you from France!

750
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,000
If you are, I want that back too.
Quickly, take it off.

751
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,600
I'll take it all off, you jerk!

752
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,200
Wait a minute...

753
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:12,100
That lipstick you're wearing right now looks like one I bought you, too. Am I right? The pink one-

754
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,300
Hey!

755
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,800
Here you go.  Satisfied?

756
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,900
You really...!  Hey!

757
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:20,810
Then, this is my house.

758
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:23,030
Don't even step on the floor.

759
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:27,880
I bought the air filter. Don't you breathe.

760
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,500
 Your call was unsuccessful, you will be connected to  voicemail after the tone... 

761
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,500
Don't worry, Hye Mi.   I'll call him.

762
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,200
Jin Ho will certainly answer a call from me.

763
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,700
 

764
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,000
 

765
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,600
 

766
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,000
Jin Ho, where are you right now?

767
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,800
I can't answer the phone right now.

768
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,500
I'll call you back later.

769
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,200
What are you doing right now?

770
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,400
Just hang up for now,

771
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,600
and I'll talk to you later.

772
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:24,800
But you can tell me right now, can't you?

773
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,200
OH MY!

774
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,300
What are you doing in here?

775
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,400
Do you think you can tell me right now?

776
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:38,900
It was dark so I got into the wrong room...

777
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,300
The agreement we made earlier...

778
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:44,100
you do remember it, don't you?

779
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,700
What agreement?

780
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,500
Did I come on too strong?

781
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,100
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

782
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,600
Hey...

783
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,300
Kim In Hee...

784
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,100
How come you're showing your face here?

785
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:49,700
I'm coming back to where I live.  Do I need your permission for that?

786
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:50,900
What?

787
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,800
I ended things with Chang Ryul,

788
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,200
so that should satisfy you.

789
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:02,000
Then you're saying... Good for you then.

790
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:05,800
Let's not fall out over one guy.

791
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,500
Hey!

792
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:14,800
Do you even know what you did?

793
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,200
Did you forget?

794
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,000
What about you?

795
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,300
Wasn't it because of you the party ended?

796
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,800
I have no place to go and I'm treated like an outcast at work.

797
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,000
How are you going to make that up to me?

798
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:35,600
Anyone listening to you might think I was the one who'd stolen your lover.

799
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,400
Lover?

800
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:41,100
You're really funny.

801
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,600
What?

802
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,400
Do you really think there was a moment that you were ever his lover?

803
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:49,400
What did you say?

804
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,700
Park Kae In. You don't know what love is like.

805
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:56,000
You need someone to love you first before you can know.

806
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:01,400
So you've been given so much love,

807
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,800
and yet you steal my lover and lie to me?

808
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,100
Is that how hard-hearted you are?

809
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:09,900
But I don't beg for love like you do.

810
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:12,500
You don't even know the difference between love and pity.

811
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,600
Men pity you so they give you some attention,

812
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,400
and you think that amounts to love?

813
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,400
Hey!

814
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:22,100
- You! You! 
- AAHHH!

815
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,300
Hey! Let go of me!

816
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:25,700
- Hey! 
 - Ahh!

817
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,400
- Are you not going to let go?! 
- You!

818
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,200
- Ah! 
- Hey!

819
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,500
- You better let go right now! 
- You!

820
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,600
Kae In! Geez!!!

821
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,000
Did you come out to watch?

822
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,300
Please be quiet.

823
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,700
You think you're the only one in the house?

824
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,600
Hey... What's with that guy?

825
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,600
What will you do if you know?

826
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,600
Park Kae In.

827
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,600
You shouldn't live so recklessly.

828
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:15,600
How can you take in a man like this, especially one as young as him?

829
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,800
Why?

830
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,200
Do you envy me him, too?

831
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,800
Do you want to take him too?

832
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,600
I've never taken others. They just come to me.

833
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,900
But, you definitely can't take that guy.

834
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,000
Why not?

835
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:31,400
Give me any man at all for 10 minutes, and I'm in business.

836
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:36,200
You can bust a gut trying,

837
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,900
but you're not his type!

838
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,400
Is that so?

839
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,200
Then I guess we'll have to find out.

840
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,500
You can put all you've got into seducing him.

841
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,100
That man...

842
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,800
is gay!
