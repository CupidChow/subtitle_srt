00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,460
You can tell me

187
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,630
what you want directly.

188
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,510
No.

189
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,820
I have to win
before I tell Your Majesty.

190
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,790
Whatever you want to compete with me,

191
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,510
I'll agree.

192
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,580
Let's just have a horse race.

193
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,580
Whoever reaches the wood ahead first

194
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,220
will be the winner.

195
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,630
Aren't we going to have
an equestrian archery contest?

196
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,340
I don't want to crush Your Majesty.

197
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,550
Your Majesty.

198
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,390
Your Majesty,

199
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,700
I've lost.

200
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,910
If your wish

201
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,300
is to go back to Xiyan,

202
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,790
I won't agree.

203
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,820
If I knew your riding skills
were so excellent,

204
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,100
I wouldn't have competed
with Your Majesty.

205
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,180
When His Majesty

206
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,670
a prince,

207
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,820
he never lost​ an equestrian archery
contest to other princes.

208
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,150
How can I defeat Your Majesty then?

209
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,150
Concubine Yan, you are very smart.

210
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,670
As long as you can fall in love
with this place,

211
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,300
you can defeat me.

212
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,150
Your Majesty, do you mean

213
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,820
you will take me to Lushan often?

214
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,060
When I have time, I will take you here.

215
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:42,820
Really?

216
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,700
The Emperor does not speak lightly.

217
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,820
Take Concubine Yan to have a rest.

218
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,340
Come.

219
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:54,750
Your Majesty,

220
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,820
in one year,

221
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,300
I will surpass you.

222
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,030
Okay.

223
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,270
Concubine Yan is naturally carefree.

224
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,340
It's indeed a hardship for her

225
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,510
to stay in the palace all day.

226
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,870
Yes, Your Majesty.

227
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:24,820
Did you hear

228
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,300
Yin Luomei is going to choose a husband?

229
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,150
She will choose
the champion of this year.

230
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,940
Could His Majesty place his bet
on Prince Jing as well?

231
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,100
Everybody knows Prince Jing

232
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,790
is often the top one in Lushan Hunt.

233
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,060
Let's go.

234
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:39,980
Hurry up.

235
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,670
Let's go.

236
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:42,550
General,

237
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,180
the imperial edict for the arranged
marriage has been issued.

238
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,390
Even if Prince Jing is unwilling,

239
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,300
he has to accept it.

240
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,700
The Lushan Hunting Ground is just 50 li
from the West Mountain Mine.

241
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,270
If I encounter danger and go missing
on the hunting ground,

242
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,300
Father will definitely send

243
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,220
the Lulin Army stationed
at the West Mountain Mine

244
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,150
to search the mountains.

245
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,550
That will be

246
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,510
your best opportunity
to capture Li Qing.

247
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,270
My lord, when I'm not by your side,

248
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,180
please be careful.

249
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,180
Don't worry.

250
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,300
Go now.

251
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,700
If anything happens,

252
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,790
use a pigeon to send me a message.

253
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:18,980
Yes.

254
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,270
Is Mei Lin

255
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,670
still in Fanghua Palace?

256
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,220
Yes.

257
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,580
Concubine Yan's maid said

258
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,820
Mei Lin didn't want to see you,

259
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,340
so she stayed in the Fanghua Palace.

260
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,390
Okay.

261
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,430
Third Brother,

262
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,870
everyone says
you are highly skilled in archery

263
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,870
and that you must be the top one
in this spring hunt.

264
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,630
But I don't think

265
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,060
it's for sure.

266
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,270
You are right, Big Brother.

267
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,750
I haven't participated

268
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,670
in spring hunt for many years.

269
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,180
It was all in the past.

270
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,460
Your Highness,

271
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,790
as planned, Yang Zhen

272
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,750
has released the prisoners of war
from the West Mountain Mine.

273
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,180
In six hours,

274
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:24,980
there will be

275
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,910
traces of the Xiyan prisoners
of war in Lushan.

276
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,870
When our assassins disguise themselves
as prisoners of war

277
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,150
to carry out the assassination,
even if it fails,

278
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,430
Yang Zhen will be held responsible.

279
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,510
This assassination during the hunt

280
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,030
must succeed.

281
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:45,980
You are not allowed to fail.

282
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,150
Understood.

283
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,820
I will reach the West Mountain Mine

284
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,100
after climbing over two mountains.

285
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:03,750
Stop there!

286
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,790
Aren't you Prince Jing's Beauty?

287
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,430
Why aren't you with Concubine Yan?

288
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:21,870
And you are dressed like this.

289
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,460
Beauty,

290
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,300
I've long been interested in you.

291
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,270
With your looks,

292
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,510
I didn't expect Prince Jing
to let you go so soon.

293
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,790
What a pity.

294
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,910
How dare you touch my woman!

295
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,980
I can cripple you at will.

296
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,150
Your Highness,

297
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,270
I'm sorry.

298
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:45,820
I...

299
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,270
I'll leave now.

300
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,270
Stop there.

301
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,510
If you dare

302
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,460
to leak anything about
what happened here,

303
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,390
Princess Hengyang will have to
arrange her son's funeral.

304
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,670
Understood,

305
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:00,740
Your Highness.

306
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,740
I didn't see anyone.

307
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,180
I got hurt by myself.

308
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:03,870
Get lost.

309
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,390
There're many patrolling Imperial Guards
on the Lushan Hunting Ground.

310
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,310
Aren't you afraid
of implicating Concubine Yan?

311
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,740
There are no Imperial Guards
patrolling here.

312
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,430
You haven't seen me,

313
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,740
and Concubine Yan won't be implicated.

314
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,830
You're familiar with the terrain
of the hunting ground.

315
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,150
It seems you are well-prepared.

316
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,700
Are you going to the West Mountain Mine
to find the witness?

317
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,390
Whatever I do

318
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,460
has nothing to do with you.

319
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,310
General,

320
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,430
inspection of this area is complete.

321
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,540
Go over there to take a look.

322
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:52,910
Yes.

323
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,830
Play along with me.

324
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,830
Otherwise, you'll be known
as the assassin of a prince.

325
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,150
Nothing here.

326
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:09,630
I'll go over there to take a look.

327
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:11,980
Let's go over there.

328
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,430
Nothing here either.

329
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,670
Nothing here.

330
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,110
Nothing here either.

331
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,780
You taught me this.

332
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,820
If we are discovered,

333
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,540
you won't be able to go
to the West Mountain Mine.

334
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,110
That's outrageous.

335
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,670
The assassins disguised themselves
as the prisoners of war.

336
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,150
It seems the Crown Prince

337
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,260
borrowed help
from the West Mountain Mine this time.

338
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,470
Carry these two bodies
to a conspicuous place.

339
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:37,710
Also,

340
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:38,950
you two

341
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:39,870
will follow Mei Lin

342
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,580
and ensure her safety.

343
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:42,980
The rest of you

344
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,190
will cover for me

345
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,470
to the Sunset Cliff.

346
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,020
Yes.

347
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,580
Your Highness,

348
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,740
our people were nearly discovered
by General Yin.

349
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:04,820
We've lost

350
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:05,870
track of them.

351
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,110
We can't succeed in one go.

352
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:07,780
Send more people.

353
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,430
Don't give them any chance
to catch their breath.

354
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,060
Understood.

355
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:39,780
Luomei,

356
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,670
are you sure this isn't just hearsay?

357
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,390
I've never seen any red foxes

358
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,580
on the Lushan Hunting Ground.

359
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,300
Anyway, you have to hunt
the foxes with me.

360
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:48,630
Since you've lost,

361
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:49,540
you have to keep your word.

362
00:21:58,910 --> 00:21:59,950
According to legend,

363
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,190
if two people see a red fox together,

364
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,540
they will love each other forever.

365
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,470
Are you upset about choosing a husband?

366
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,670
Did my aunt tell Your Highness that?

367
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,260
There is no need for Her Highness
to remind me that.

368
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,430
She just encouraged me
to win the first place.

369
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,220
But I know

370
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,910
you've made a choice, General.

371
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,780
Why should I force my will on anyone?

372
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,540
If possible,

373
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,740
I'm willing to guard the frontier

374
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,020
and never get married in my life.

375
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,020
But I'm a daughter of the Yin family.

376
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,820
I can't decide my marriage.

377
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,630
There's a way.

378
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,950
In this spring hunt,

379
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,020
as long as you can win the first place,

380
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,020
you can tell my father

381
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,350
to postpone it.

382
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,220
I'm willing to give

383
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,390
the prey I've hunted

384
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,580
to you.

385
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,300
I certainly hope

386
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,260
you can write my name

387
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,910
in the imperial edict
for the arranged marriage.

388
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,300
But other than that,

389
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,110
I wish you could still live
as you did before,

390
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,390
daring to love and hate

391
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,780
and being carefree and bold.

392
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:57,710
Luomei,

393
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,060
as long as I, Murong Xuanlie, am alive,

394
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,740
I won't let anything

395
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,540
upset you.

396
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,220
The legend about the red foxes
in Lushan is true.

397
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,470
Perhaps

398
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,390
I shouldn't use

399
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,150
this knife now.

400
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,780
I need to arrive before dark

401
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,350
to have a chance to sneak
into the West Mountain Mine.

402
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,950
Killing him is too merciful.

403
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,470
What we should do

404
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,190
is make him atone

405
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,350
for Qingzhou's 100,000 souls,

406
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,870
for the innocent Weibei soldiers
who died.

407
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,980
Your Highness, two people died.

408
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,390
It seems Prince Jing

409
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,300
is well-prepared for this spring hunt.

410
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:16,580
Time is limited.

411
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,740
We must kill him
before the Imperial Guards.

412
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,110
Rest assured, Your Highness.

413
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:20,740
Prince Jing

414
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,580
is doomed to die.

415
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,020
He is deeply scheming.

416
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:32,780
I don't need to worry about him.

417
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,150
He was General Weibei back then.

418
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,020
Attack him together!

419
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,350
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

420
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,430
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

421
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,710
Real prisoners of war?

422
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,350
Why did you come back to save me?

423
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,350
Out of instinct.

424
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,430
I'm different from you.

425
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,110
I can't watch anyone die in vain.

426
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,710
I'm truly blessed by the gods.

427
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,350
If there weren't a deep pool
below the cliff,

428
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,190
we

429
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,780
would have died here.

430
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,980
You already knew there is a deep pool
below the cliff?

431
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,710
You tried to escape in this way?

432
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,500
With your scheming personality,

433
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,710
​how could you not anticipate
the Crown Prince's murderous intent?

434
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,710
I shouldn't have come back.

435
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:54,870
You can't leave.

436
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,430
I told you

437
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,980
I didn't want to go with you.

438
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,300
Now that you've come back to me,

439
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,220
I won't let you leave me again.

440
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,220
It's not up to you.

441
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,390
It's getting dark.

442
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:05,820
Without me,

443
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,820
do you think you can leave here alive?

444
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,110
No need for you to worry about me.

445
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:11,390
It's useless for you to go
to the West Mountain Mine.

446
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,870
Li Qing can only be at my disposal.

447
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,430
If you dare to ruin my plan,

448
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,820
I will kill you.

449
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,710
I can kill you now.

450
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:25,950
Watch out.

451
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:46,950
You and I

452
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,740
are on the same path

453
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,740
and share the same goal.

454
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,350
Stay.

455
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:54,740
Stay by my side.

456
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,470
The snake is venomous.

457
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,630
To survive, you need to drain
the blood immediately.

458
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:08,870
I know that.

459
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,390
The snake venom has paralyzed your leg.

460
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,740
You must detoxify.

461
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,150
I'll send you back to Lushan.

462
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,060
Not necessary.

463
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,670
Follow the stream downstream.

464
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,980
There's a hunter's cabin

465
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:41,980
where there's medicine.

466
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,020
Whatever plan you have,

467
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,980
I can't watch an innocent man
die in vain.

468
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:52,910
Don't worry.

469
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,060
This time,

470
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,020
I myself is the bait.

471
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,300
It's Prince Jing's arrow.

472
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,020
Hurry up and report it.

473
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:30,670
Yes.

474
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,780
How could there be prisoners of war
on the royal hunting ground?

475
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,430
The West Mountain Mine
is 50 li away from here.

476
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,820
Most of the workers there
are Xiyan prisoners of war.

477
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,780
Escapes by prisoners of war are common.

478
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,020
Perhaps

479
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,540
there was a lapse
among the Imperial Guards.

480
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:46,540
Your Majesty,

481
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,780
it's a dereliction of duty on my part.

482
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:48,980
Please pardon me.

483
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:50,710
Father,

484
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,670
General Yin has only recently taken
command of the Imperial Guards,

485
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,820
so it's inevitable that there would be
some lapses among the troops.

486
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:56,740
Get up.

487
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:01,910
The urgent task now

488
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,870
is to find Jinghe.

489
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:05,820
Your Majesty,

490
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,300
these prisoners of war

491
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,670
are all soldiers who have gone to war.

492
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,780
Now they are cornered and desperate,

493
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,020
so we cannot let our guard down.

494
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:13,300
I propose that the Imperial Guards

495
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,150
seal off the mountain
and conduct a thorough search.

496
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:20,820
Father,

497
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,390
sealing off the mountain for a search

498
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,780
will require a lot of manpower,

499
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,670
leaving the hunting palace
understaffed and at risk.

500
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,110
General Yin,

501
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,350
please stay and protect my father.

502
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,740
I request to go search for Jinghe.

503
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,350
I will find Jinghe

504
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:32,710
before it's dark.

505
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,470
Your Majesty,

506
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,220
I also...

507
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:34,740
I know

508
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,150
if you stay at the hunting palace,

509
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,020
you'll be worried.

510
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:41,910
General Yin,

511
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,110
go to the West Mountain Mine

512
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,870
and mobilize the Lulin Army for support.

513
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,350
The escape of the prisoners of war

514
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,390
is their responsibility.

515
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,260
Understood, Your Majesty.

516
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:03,670
Search carefully.

517
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:04,710
You go over there.

518
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,220
Yes.

519
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,220
Let's go over there.

520
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,710
The hunting ground
is full of fierce birds.

521
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,430
Let's hope nothing bad has happened.

522
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:11,910
Here.

523
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:13,740
Search carefully.

524
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,220
General,

525
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,980
Mei Lin can't be found
on the hunting ground.

526
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,820
Could Prince Jing's disappearance
be related to her?

527
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:21,980
Perhaps.

528
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,060
No mater what,

529
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,670
let's first find Prince Jing.

530
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:31,350
Your Highness,

531
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,670
in at most a day,

532
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,670
we can finish searching
the entire Lushan Hunting Ground.

533
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,060
Prince Jing will definitely be found.

534
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,060
However,

535
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,780
General Yin will bring the troops back

536
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,110
within a day.

537
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:40,910
Well...

538
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,300
Send a message to Yang Zhen

539
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:43,630
to have him stall them
as much as possible.

540
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,630
I'm afraid Yang Zhen will fail.

541
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:46,950
Tell him to do his best.

542
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:47,670
Remember,

543
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:48,670
just stall them.

544
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,220
Don't offend them.

545
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:49,820
Yes, Your Highness.

546
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,060
Murong Jinghe,

547
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:57,910
you should have disappeared
from this world

548
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,220
ten years ago.

549
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,310
Let's take a break.

550
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:06,620
I can't walk anymore.

551
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,100
What does this horn signal mean?

552
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:37,700
My father has ordered
the end of the hunt

553
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,950
and the sealing of the mountain.

554
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,540
What exactly is your plan?

555
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,620
The commander at the West Mountain Mine
works for the Eastern Palace.

556
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:52,140
I deliberately staged
an accident and disappearance

557
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:55,470
to give Qing Yan a chance
to capture Li Qing.

558
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,580
So you released the prisoners of war
in the West Mountain

559
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,980
to create chaos?

560
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,950
They are scapegoats released
by the Crown Prince.

561
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,620
In the Battle of Qiujiang,

562
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,060
I decisively defeated the Xiyan army.

563
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,140
Their general committed suicide.

564
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,060
The rest prisoners of war

565
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,430
were locked up to do labor
in the West Mountain Mine.

566
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,140
The Qiujiang prisoners of war

567
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:22,540
escaped to the hunting ground,

568
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,180
intending to take revenge

569
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,540
and kill me.

570
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,310
It makes sense.

571
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,540
If the Crown Prince

572
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,430
leads the search and seals the mountain,

573
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,750
won't we become birds in a cage?

574
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,430
They are sealing Lushan.

575
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:36,870
Here

576
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,270
is Zhongshan.

577
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,230
The snake venom
has paralyzed his nerves.

578
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,060
I'm thirsty.

579
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,470
Get some water for me.

580
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:00,310
Let me help you.

581
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:00,910
Hurry up!

582
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,230

[Hunter's cabin]

616
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,580
You've taken the antidote.

617
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,100
The snake venom
will soon be neutralized.

618
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:03,870
Thank you.

619
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:14,740
I once spent three years

620
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,430
as a cripple
unable to take care of myself.

621
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,870
The pain and humiliation
during that time

622
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,030
were far worse than today's.

623
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,620
During my nightmares,

624
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:29,510
I felt resentment,

625
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,100
hatred,

626
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,620
and regret,

627
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:38,550
for following the order
not to harm civilians,

628
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,550
which allowed Li Qing to escape.

629
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:41,910
Stop!

630
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,390
Don't point blades at the civilians.

631
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:44,830
Otherwise,

632
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,660
the battle for revenge

633
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,580
wouldn't have been so difficult.

634
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,950
Actually, I admire you very much.

635
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,740
We both crawled out
of the pile of dead bodies.

636
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,910
Yet, you have always been

637
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:05,540
a good person.

638
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,140
Being a good person

639
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,740
comes with a price.

640
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,580
General Weibei

641
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,390
bore a tarnished name

642
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:22,580
but continued to protect the people
until the very end.

643
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:24,910
He is a good man

644
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:26,790
and a hero.

645
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:29,430
I admire him very much.

646
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,060
The current Prince Jing

647
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:41,870
is not worthy of being General Weibei.

648
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,310
They have always been the same person.

649
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,180
If the events from back then
were to happen again,

650
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,390
I'm not sure whether I would

651
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:52,740
make the same decision as before.

652
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:57,990
Once we win this battle

653
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,990
and expose the truth about Qingzhou,

654
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,660
I will take full responsibility

655
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,430
for the debts owed,

656
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:18,060
even if

657
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,100
it costs me my life.
