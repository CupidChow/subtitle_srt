00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,200
General,

193
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,750
His Highness is unwell
and refuses visitors.

194
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,550
I bring the remedy he needs,

195
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,960
one that

196
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,910
calms the Prince Heir's heart.

197
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,320
Inform him.

198
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,910
Seeing her

199
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,510
will cure the Prince Heir

200
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,080
more than any medicine.

201
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,320
Where is she?

202
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,440
Once lost, and now returned.

203
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,600
Do I not deserve a gift of thanks,
Your Highness?

204
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,840
Take me to her.

205
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,320
I must see her first.

206
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,870
Keep watch on them.

207
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,510
Report all

208
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,320
they say and do.

209
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,480
Yes.

210
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,440
Mei Lin,

211
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,750
it truly is you.

212
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,440
I'm grateful you're alive.

213
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,360
Fear not.

214
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,000
I won't force you again.

215
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,000
I can't bear to

216
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,000
let you die a second time.

217
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,840
I will

218
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,550
send you back to Qingzhou.

219
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,120
Mei Lin.

220
00:13:59,150 --> 00:13:59,960
Don't be afraid.

221
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,840
I won't hurt anyone anymore.

222
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,320
You can't hurt yourself anymore.

223
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,150
I will find more Snow Dragon Whisker
to save you.

224
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,870
The Snow Dragon Whisker
was an accident.

225
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,840
I don't blame you.

226
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,840
Stop blaming yourself.

227
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,550
Your Highness,

228
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,240
let me go.

229
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,750
I only wish

230
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,390
to live in peace.

231
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,550
You're the Princess Heir.

232
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,030
Your home is in Xiyan.

233
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,030
I'm no longer the Princess Heir.

234
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,510
You and I have parted ways.

235
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,390
I regret it.

236
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,750
Now that you live,

237
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,440
you must stay here.

238
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,840
If you are to die,

239
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,270
let it be by my side.

240
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,790
Your Highness,

241
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,360
I owe you

242
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,910
my life,

243
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,720
but I cannot

244
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,320
return your love.

245
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,120
You have no choice.

246
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,510
I hold Yin Luomei.

247
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,030
If you wish her safe,

248
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,440
stay.

249
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,200
Your Highness,

250
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,510
General Ming requests your presence.

251
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,600
Your Highness.

252
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:49,790
General Ming,

253
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,270
what do you want as thanks?

254
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,840
Your Highness,

255
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:53,960
take a seat.

256
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,000
Your Highness,

257
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,440
you know well

258
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,360
my desired thanks.

259
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,080
Very well.

260
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,550
I'll help you

261
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,670
seize Qingzhou,

262
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,000
but

263
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,750
release Yin Luomei first.

264
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,870
With her in hand,

265
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,150
why release her?

266
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,440
Better to execute her

267
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,000
before the armies,

268
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,750
rallying our troops.

269
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,030
Yin Luomei

270
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,240
is but a minor sheriff.

271
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,550
Her death

272
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,440
would only trouble our men.

273
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,840
But Murong Jinghe's fall

274
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,510
will deliver Qingzhou

275
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,150
without a fight.

276
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,670
Where's the Prince Heir?

277
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,120
Tell him

278
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,320
that I will stay,

279
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,240
but he must let General Yin return.

280
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,320
Release Yin Luomei as bait.

281
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,510
Murong Jinghe's death is paramount.

282
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,320
Stalling tactics.

283
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,640
Send word to Weibei Army's camp

284
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,790
that Yin Luomei was caught
spying on Xiyan's camp.

285
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,480
Out of regard for peace,

286
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,310
I will overlook it,

287
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,270
but I require Qingzhou's governor

288
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,350
to fetch her at Liucui River.

289
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:16,550
Yes, Your Highness.

290
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,880
If Mingju and Yue Qin are allied,

291
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,240
it could prove problematic.

292
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,240
Choose a trusted team

293
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,920
from the Pingnan Army

294
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,240
to assist in their rescue.

295
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,270
Also,

296
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,000
keep General Yin's absence

297
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,310
secret.

298
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:32,960
Understood.

299
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,590
Enemy sighted!

300
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Enemy sighted!

301
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,200
Enemy sighted!

302
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,780
[Yin Luomei caught spying. Governor to]
[retrieve her at Liucui River, Wu hour]

303
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:46,960
Qingyan.

304
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,200
"Yin Luomei was caught spying.

305
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:07,790
Qingzhou's governor is to collect her
at Liucui River at Wu hour."

306
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,550
Now, I only wish

307
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,510
the Princess Heir would
stay in Xiyan willingly.

308
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,920
Alas,

309
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,240
her heart belongs to Murong Jinghe.

310
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,960
It seems Xiyan seeks a reason

311
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,680
to break the treaty and ignite war.

312
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,550
Let us fight them.

313
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,350
The General said

314
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,200
the Pingnan Army does not seek war,

315
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,350
yet fears it not.

316
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,030
Kill the Xiyan soldiers,

317
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:42,920
save the General!

318
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,310
Kill the Xiyan soldiers,

319
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,070
save the General!

320
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,960
Kill the Xiyan soldiers,
save the General!

321
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,750
Kill the Xiyan soldiers,
save the General!

322
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,110
Kill the Xiyan soldiers,
save the General!

323
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,070
Kill the Xiyan soldiers,
save the General!

324
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,960
We cannot engage them.

325
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,640
With the decree and the treaty,

326
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,640
we should not be the first
to declare war.

327
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,350
Moreover, Xiyan's excuse

328
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,160
is sound.

329
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,350
I believe

330
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,640
we should follow their words.

331
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,400
His Excellency can go to retrieve her.

332
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,110
No,

333
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,030
it's likely a trap.

334
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,070
I agree.

335
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,550
If His Excellency and the General
fall into danger,

336
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,640
Qingzhou

337
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,680
will be left defenseless.

338
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:15,880
Your Excellency, let me go.

339
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:16,880
Even if it costs my life,

340
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,510
I'll bring back
General Yin and Miss Hua.

341
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,790
Miss Hua is less important.

342
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,030
General Yin is crucial.

343
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,310
Over half of Qingzhou's troops

344
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,350
are

345
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,960
former Pingnan Army.

346
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,550
Choose a team to rescue them.

347
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,720
I'll lead.

348
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,240
Be assured, General.

349
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,240
I release you with a sincere heart.

350
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,720
But

351
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,350
wait a while for Qingzhou's governor
to fetch you.

352
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,960
I will use Yin Luomei to put on a show

353
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,720
to have Mei Lin's spirit broken.

354
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:05,830
Therefore,

355
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,200
Murong Jinghe must die by my hand.

356
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,480
A clever ruse, Your Highness.

357
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,030
I want her to stay

358
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,510
and her heart, too.

359
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,240
Aid me, General Ming,

360
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,790
and Qingzhou

361
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,400
will be my gift to you.

362
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,830
Qingzhou is
the Princess Heir's homeland.

363
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,310
Your Highness,
so deeply in love with her...

364
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,790
Why should I believe

365
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,920
you'll give it to me?

366
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,000
General Ming, your soldiers outside

367
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,240
follow the gods.

368
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,200
Without the gods' blessing,

369
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,750
do you think they will
follow you into battle?

370
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,510
Your Highness.

371
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,550
I know you didn't remain willingly.

372
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,750
I offer another chance to leave.

373
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,550
You aim to incite war between nations.

374
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,960
I merely wish to watch a show.

375
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,160
Tell the governor

376
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,350
I await him with my beloved wife.

377
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,920
He must come alone.

378
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,240
Yes.

379
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,070
Your Excellency,

380
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,350
how are you?

381
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,030
If you seek peace,

382
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,400
release them now.

383
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,550
I shall.

384
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,960
Yet, General Yin and her men
spied on Xiyan's camp.

385
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,920
I must retain one as a pretext

386
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,550
for the army.

387
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Which one remains

388
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,960
is your choice,

389
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,680
Your Excellency.

390
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,880
You break your word.

391
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,270
I pledged to release General Yin,

392
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,160
not both of them.

393
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,960
Since this lady

394
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,550
is dear to you,

395
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,350
I bring you together, Your Excellency.

396
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,480
You should thank me.

397
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,000
Why should I trust you?

398
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,590
Choose Mei Lin.

399
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,590
You know

400
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,880
I'd never harm her.

401
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,240
I'm the Sun Kunlun,

402
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,510
under the gods' favor.

403
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,720
Moreover,

404
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,440
as Prince Heir

405
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:46,160
and future king,

406
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,200
I need not break my word to any subject.

407
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,030
I'm sorry.

408
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,070
Yin Luomei, come with me.

409
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,160
Your Excellency,

410
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,160
it seems you hold General Yin dearer.

411
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,920
General Yin, depart now.

412
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,510
You've made your choice.
Don't be greedy,

413
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,640
or you'll lose both.

414
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,680
General,

415
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,480
do you truly trust the Prince Heir?

416
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,350
With His Majesty gravely ill,

417
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,270
I comply

418
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,680
with the Prince Heir for now.

419
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,160
But as long as his heart
remains in Xiyan,

420
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,440
he'll keep his promise.

421
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,790
Mei Lin, see?

422
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,680
He abandoned you once more.

423
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,920
I knew he'd choose General Yin.

424
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,790
General Weibei values loyalty

425
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,550
but upholds justice above all.

426
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,720
He's unworthy of your sympathy!

427
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:55,880
Only I

428
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,270
will always choose you.

429
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:07,000
Murong Jinghe must die here.

430
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:08,920
Release the arrows!

431
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,960
Stop!

432
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,750
No one moves!

433
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,830
Stop!

434
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,160
Any who harm the Princess Heir

435
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,030
will be cut down by me.

436
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,550
So, the Prince Heir has been
playing his part all along.

437
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,110
I'm the Sun Kunlun.

438
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,830
If I fall,

439
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,400
you all fall with me!

440
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,400
[Weibei]
Yin Luomei, heed my command.

441
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,270
If I perish,

442
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,750
lead the Weibei Army
to protect Qingzhou.

443
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,510
[Weibei]

444
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,680
Generals, listen.

445
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,030
Without General Yin's order,

446
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,720
no soldier shall be deployed.

447
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,070
Yes, General!

448
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:09,790
Your Highness,

449
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,590
take care.

450
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:25,830
Mei Lin!

451
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,350

463
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,110
I planned to
send General Yin back first,

464
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,110
then find a way to send you.

465
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,310
You're as sharp as ever.

466
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,200
Wait a moment.

467
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,720
Qingyan will find us.

468
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,550
Why did you return?

469
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,680
Because I only wanted to choose you.

470
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,400
The river is treacherous.

471
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,640
How could you jump?

472
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,160

Turn back and stand by.

490
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,240
No wonder the governor's mansion
has cakes daily.

491
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,200
He's been smitten with Miss Hua
for a long time.

492
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,680
Right.

493
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,480

I thought you'd never forgive me.

498
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,720
Who said I forgave you?

499
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,110
Well...

500
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,790
This is Miss Hua's wish.

501
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,310
She admires the governor.

502
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,400
Miss Hua, please restrain yourself.

00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,110
I'm devoted to another

504
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,240

506
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,440
don't think resembling her

507
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,000
lets you near me.

508
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,030
Mei,

509
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,550
I'll spend my life

510
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,550
making amends

511
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,160
for my wrongs against you.

512
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:28,920
Jinghe,

513
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,480
promise me one more thing,

514
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,640
and I will forgive you.

515
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,640
Alright.

516
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,720
Anything,

517
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,270
I promise.

518
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,790
Swear that,

519
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,590
from now on,

520
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,270
no matter what,

521
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,790
you won't stop me.

522
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,920
Swear that,

523
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,440
you won't harm yourself for me.

524
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,720
I understand.

525
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,750
Even if the same situation arises,

526
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,160
I'll act as Qingzhou's governor.

527
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,590
Then, I will find you.

528
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,000
In this life,

529
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,160
we'll share life and death.

530
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,070
In life and in death.

531
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,880
You're going back on your word again.

532
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,790
I shouldn't have forgiven you.

533
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,790
Alright.

534
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,750
I swear.

535
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,350
You're so stubborn.

536
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,920
I will always listen to you.

537
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,510
Will you promise me?

538
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:06,680
I promise you.

539
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,160
And I know

540
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,680
you retrieved the Snow Dragon Whisker

541
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,110
and took the poison for me.

542
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,680
Truly,

543
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,310
what you owed is paid.

544
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,400
- Jinghe, from now on...
- My Lord!

545
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,240
Miss,

546
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,880
Concubine Yan...

547
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,680
Concubine Yan has passed away.

548
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:17,960
Father.

549
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,110
You have come just in time.

550
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,830
Mingju has planned to attack Qingzhou.

551
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,350
You have lived long in Great Yan

552
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,350
and are deeply knowledgeable
in Qingzhou affairs.

553
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,030
Go with the army

554
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,350
and aid Mingju

555
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,350
in seizing Qingzhou.

556
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,200
Your Majesty,

557
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,960
I fear His Highness,
devoted to his sister,

558
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,160
may lack commitment.

559
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:48,400
Zigu was wed to Great Yan.

560
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,830
Her well-being is no concern to Xiyan.

561
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,790
Seize Qingzhou

562
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,830
and claim the Sacred Mountain.

563
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,920
Only then can I secure immortality.

564
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,510
Yes,

565
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,070
Father.

566
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,030
Mingju, how dare you?

567
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,160
I wouldn't, Your Highness.

568
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,200
The Princess Heir has left.

569
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,790
I fear sorrow may overtake you,

570
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,790
making it hard to lead.

571
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,200
Don't overwork yourself.

572
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,070
Come,

573

574
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,880
back to his quarters.

575
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:57,790
Mei Lin,

576
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,510
you saved my brother,

577
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,960
and I am fond of you.

578
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,030
Can you join our family?

579
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,670
I know you enjoy a drink.

580
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:11,190
When I'm troubled, I drink as well.

581
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,630
Cheers, Your Highness.

582
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,590
Cheers!

583
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,030
Your Highness,

584
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,190
here.

585
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:25,960
Let's drink.

586
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,440
Mei Lin.

587
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,880
Mei Lin.

588
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,230
Mei Lin!

589
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,000
Mei Lin.

590
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,480
Mei Lin.

591
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,630
Mei Lin.

592
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:44,880
Mei Lin!

593
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,710
Will we meet again in this lifetime?

594
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,550
We'll definitely meet again.

595
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,070
I didn't realize
when we parted in Zhaojing,

596
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,110
it would be the last.

597
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,150
Chagu mentioned

598
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,630
Her Highness

599
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,840
didn't pass in pain.

600
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,590
His Majesty truly loved Her Highness.

601
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,590
With His Majesty by her side,

602
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,510
she did not pass in loneliness,

603
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,510
right?

604
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,000
By the gods above,

605
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,920
may Zigu

606
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,480
live without restraint in the afterlife.

607
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,360
Your Highness,

608
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,440
do you hear?

609
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,440
The gods say yes.

610
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,190
My Lord,

611
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,710
Xiyan has declared war on Great Yan.

612
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,400
Look.

Smoke rises.

614
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,400
What's happening?

615
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,710
A mountain fire!

616
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,550
A mountain fire.

617
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,000
It's spreading toward us.

618
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:37,920
It's getting closer.

619
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:38,840
Run!

620
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:42,590
Run!

621
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,070
Run now!

622
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,280
There's a fire.

624
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,590
My son!

625
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,400
Mother!

626
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,510
Mother!

627
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,400
Mother!

628
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,670
Are you alright?

629
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,550
Are you alright?

630
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,550
Thank you, Your Excellency.

631
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,710
Thank you, Your Excellency.

632
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:25,670
Let's go quickly!

633
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,110
What is happening?

634
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,480
I don't know.

635
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,710
Why can't we leave?

636
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,360
Excuse me.

637
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,320
Excuse me.

638
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,190
Excuse me.

639
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,030
Excuse me.

640
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:53,880
Dear townsfolk,

641
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,510
this mountain fire

642
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,230
is a sorrow shared by Qingzhou

643
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,000
and myself.

644
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,280
Now,

645
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,070
with both the Xiyan army

646
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,030
and the fire advancing,

647
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,550
only unity

648
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,630
will give us hope of survival.

649
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,670
The Weibei Army is clearing trees
to hold back the fire.

650
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,630
All elderly, women, and children

651
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,800
should gather near
the Monument of the Masses.

652
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:20,670
The Weibei Army will protect you all.

653
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,590
Can you stop the fire?

654
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,620
- Can you really stop it?
- Can you stop it?

655
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,320
My family was lost to the fire

656
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,440
- What should we do?
- ten years ago.

657
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,150
I wish to live!

658
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,670
Will my family's new cabin

659
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,630
burn down?

660
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,590
Yes.

661
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,030
All will be lost.

662
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,630
We've rebuilt with effort,

663
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,030
only to face ruin again.

664
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,110
We're short on time.

665
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,920
Let's halt the fire
with the Weibei Army.

666
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,000
Yes!

667
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,800
Yes.

668
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,710
Together, we'll stop the fire!

669
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,150
Your Excellency,

670
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,550
I want to join the army.

671
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,000
I'll join the Weibei Army

672
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,150
to fight for Qingzhou

673
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,280
and my home.

674
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,670
I want to join the army too.

675
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,760
I'm a butcher.

676
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,630
I can kill pigs.

677
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,760
I can kill enemies!

678
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,800
We trust His Excellency.

679
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,880
We will protect Qingzhou together!

680
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,590
I'm a carpenter.

681
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,030
I can build defenses.

682
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:04,880
So can I!

683
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:05,710
So can I!

684
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,280
So can I!

685
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,760
We will join the Weibei Army!

686
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,190
I, Murong Jinghe, hereby swear:

687
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:18,550
the Weibei Army will defend Qingzhou
to the death!

688
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:24,480
Defend Qingzhou to the death!

689
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,800
Defend Qingzhou to the death!

690
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,840
Defend Qingzhou to the death!

691
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:38,190
Defend Qingzhou to the death!

692
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:38,920
Your Excellency,

693
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,190
Mingju has an army of thirty thousand,

694
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,670
but the Weibei Army in Qingzhou

695
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,510
numbers only a thousand.

696
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,960
We must clear the woods
to prevent fire spread,

697
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,710
but if Mingju attacks,

698
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,400
we won't last two days.

699
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,920
General Yin, if you
seek reinforcements in Mozhou,

700
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,360
how soon could they return?

701
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,480
In two days.

702
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,630
You plan to take Youwen Ridge?

703
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:57,920
Yes.

704
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,280
You can't.

705
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,590
It's perilous

706
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:02,800
and

707
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,920
houses Xiyan's ninth division.

708
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,230
We can't go there.

709
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:07,920
If necessary,

710
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,280
we'll break through.

711
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,880
Very well, I trust you.

712
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,710
Qingzhou will hold until your return.

713
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,510
Qingyan,

714
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,150
General Yuan,
strengthen the city defenses

715
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,760
and gather all supplies.

716
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,280
Lord Li Jie will manage deployment.

717
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,590
In the face of a grave threat,

718
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,840
our troops and citizens
must remain calm.

719
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:29,320
