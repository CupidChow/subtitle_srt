191
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,360
I will present the Snow Dragon Whisker
to you personally.

192
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,870
Begin the execution.

193
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,080
There is a divine revelation.

194
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,910
The deities are angry.

195
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,320
Could the Prince Heir be innocent?

196
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,440
Please, gods, calm your anger.

197
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,790
Father,

198
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,510
my loyalty has been proved.

199
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,840
Please return

200
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,360
the Snow Dragon Whisker to me first.

201
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,670
Your Majesty,

202
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,840
the High Priest

203
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,270
died.

204
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,750
Your Majesty,

205
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,360
historical records mention

206
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,390
a High Priest punished by heaven

207
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,150
for deceiving the King,

208
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,550
leading to sudden death

209
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,630
on the spot.

210
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,630
The celestial signs indicated

211
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,000
that the High Priest angered the gods.

212
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,030
The High Priest's death

213
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,790
was a warning from the gods.

214
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,000
Please, gods, calm your anger.

215
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,790
Please, gods, calm your anger.

216
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,600
Please, gods, calm your anger.

217
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,840
The High Priest was murdered.

218
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,720
Please, Father, see this clearly.

219
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,240
Murdered?

220
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,550
All the subjects present

221
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,510
saw heaven punish the High Priest

222
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,870
on behalf of the King.

223
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,480
Now, you defend the High Priest...

224
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,360
Were you colluding with the High Priest

225
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,840
to deceive your Father?

226
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,600
Father.

227
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,750
Alright.

228
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,080
Considering that you

229
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,910
endured the trials by heaven,

230
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,510
I won't strip you of your title.

231
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,150
I have attained longevity,

232
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,150
with herbs available for preparation.

233
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,910
The Snow Dragon Whisker

234
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,120
is mine in the first place.

235
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,960
Why can't I eat it raw?

236
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,550
Father, you can't.

237
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,030
If you continue
with rebellious thoughts,

238
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,870
this will be your fate.

239
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,870
No, Father!

240
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,000
You can't.

241
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,030
You can't.

242
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,700
[Not Too Late]

243
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,600
The Princess Heir's pulse
is weak and floating,

244
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,030
indicating poisoning.

245
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,000
The sudden onset of the Momai poison

246
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,550
suggests she has been overworked

247
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,360
in Qingzhou or recently fell ill.

248
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,840
If untreated,

249
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,390
it will destroy her organs.

250
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,030
Your Highness,

251
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,510
now the antidote is lost.

252
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,870
What should we do about Mei?

253
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,550
There must be a way.

254
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:53,140
[Not Too Late]

255
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,120
Your Highness.

256
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,630
Your Highness,

257
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,360
the Great Shaman might have a solution.

258
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,270
I know the dark arts of blood.

259
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,880
We need compatible blood
for a transfusion,

260
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,480
but it's dangerous.

261
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,070
My lord.

262
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,110
Any news from the physician?

263
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,030
Does Mei Lin still sweat

264
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,440
or lose her appetite frequently?

265
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,400
- How many hours does she sleep?
- My lord,

266
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,350
the physician has just arrived in Xiyan,

267
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,590
no news yet.

268
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:34,960
No.

269
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,590
Send a visiting card to Xiyan Palace.

270
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,270
I won't be relieved
until I see Mei Lin well.

271
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,720
Yes.

272
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,140
[Prince Heir's Mansion]

273
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,720
The blood insect is ready.

274
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,000
After the blood transfusion,

275
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,510
the Princess Heir will wake up.

276
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:19,880
Mei Lin,

277
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,000
you are awake.

278
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,240
Are you feeling any discomfort?

279
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,750
Your Highness.

280
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,640
You went into a coma due to the poison.

281
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,440
Fortunately...

282
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,920
Fortunately, the Snow Dragon Whisker
bloomed.

283
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,590
The poison in you is neutralized.

284
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,350
I remember

285
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,750
when the poison acted up,

286
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,110
my internal organs

287
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,110
seemed to be burnt by fire.

288
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,240
The poison in me

289
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,680
has been neutralized?

290
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,590
I survived?

291
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:22,920
It's all in the past.

292
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,310
Come on.

293
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,750
Thanks to you

294
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,030
that I survived.

295
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Thank you for saving my life.

296
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,200
Mei Lin,

297
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,790
you are free now.

298
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,140
[Deed of Divorce]

299
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,350
When you recover,

300
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,160
I'll send you back to Qingzhou.

301
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,350
Just rest well.

302
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:25,880
Your Highness,

303
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,790
what's the matter?

304
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,510
Are you injured?

305
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,640
A minor injury from a few days ago,

306
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,240
but nothing serious.

307
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,160
It's a pity

308
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,030
about the Qingzhou Knot.

309
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,110
Once stained with blood,

310
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,920
it can't be cleaned.

311
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,480
I'll make a new one

312
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,720
and give it to you.

313
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,270
Okay.

314
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,440
Have a good rest.

315
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,440
Let us out!

316
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:45,240
Let us out!

317
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,240
The blood is not compatible.

318
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,350
Take her away.

319
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,720
Let us out!

320
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,510
- Next one.
- Let us out!

321
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:52,830
Mei Lin,

322
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,440
if you knew the truth,

323
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,240
you wouldn't forgive me,

324
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,200
would you?

325
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,030
Found it.

326
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,350
Your Highness,

327
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,880
even if I can't help you,

328
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,790
I hope you can be happy.

329
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,720
The Blood Slave technique
can't cure the Momai poison?

330
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,960
Miss Mei Lin fainted
due to the poison acting up.

331
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,830
Using a Blood Slave to exchange blood

332
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:03,000
only extends her life by three months.

333
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,510
Only the Snow Dragon Whisker

334
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,750
can fully eradicate the poison.

335
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,030
Snow Dragon Whisker.

336
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:10,640
Yes.

337
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,310
I'll find another Snow Dragon Whisker.

338
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,510
I can save Mei Lin.

339
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,920
She only has three months left.

340
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,550
After that,

341
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,160
even the Snow Dragon Whisker won't help.

342
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,400
I'll take my leave.

343
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,310
Your Highness.

344
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,310
Let's go.

345
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,510
Hasn't the poison
in me been neutralized?

346
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,070
What's with the Blood Slave technique?

347
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:52,640
Yi.

348
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:53,880
Yi.

349
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,350
Yi.

350
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,160
Yi.

351
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:11,920
Yi,

352
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,160
what happened?

353
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:18,590
Yi.

354
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,160
Using a Blood Slave to exchange blood

355
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,400
only extends her life by three months.

356
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,110
Are you okay, Yi?

357
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,960
Hold on.

358
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,200
Mei Lin,

359
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,680
it was my fault.

360
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,720
I failed to protect
the Snow Dragon Whisker.

361
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,270
If my blood can save you,

362
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,750
I won't hurt others.

363
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,440
Yi.

364
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,270
Don't

365
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,160
hurt Yi.

366
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,790
Prepare for the blood transfusion.

367
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,830
I'm sorry.

368
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,480
Great!

369
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,270
The poison in Miss Mei Lin
has been neutralized.

370
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,830
You can be relieved now.

371
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,480
But I still feel uneasy.

372
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,880
The visiting card from Xiyan
has arrived.

373
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:00,960
Let's go immediately.

374
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:01,960
My lord,

375
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,110
since the poison has been neutralized,

376
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,200
you should let it go.

377
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,440
My lord.

378
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,940
[Like the Constant Sun]

379
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,440
Yi.

380
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,790

571
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,030
Alright.

572
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,070
You will handle the funeral

573
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,840
of this Great Yan woman.

574
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:42,150
Make sure

575
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,630
her body is returned to Great Yan
for burial quickly,

576
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,960
so it doesn't taint
my Longevity grounds.

577
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,030
Farewell, Your Majesty.

578
00:40:59,110 --> 00:40:59,760
Mei.

579
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:02,760
Mei.

580
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:04,590
Mei.

581
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,550
Mei Lin.

582
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,320
Where is Mei Lin?

583
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,630
What do you want to do?

584
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:11,670
Your Majesty.

585
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,110
You've already divorced
the Great Yan woman.

586
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,320
Don't cause more trouble.

587
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,190
Your Highness.

588
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,230
If Father insists on stopping me,

589
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,360
I will only show my resolve
through death.

590
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,360
Your Highness,

591
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,880
I can't watch you kill yourself.

592
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,190
Life and death are beyond your control.

593
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,030
Sun Kunlun's life

594
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,110
belongs to me alone.

595
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,510
Don't you miss her?

596
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,190
I'll reward you

597
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,360
with confinement.

598
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,440
Tie him up.

599
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:54,550
Yes.
