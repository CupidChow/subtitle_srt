00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,550
I'll lead a fraction

195
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,670
of our troops

196
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,550
and seize Qingzhou.

197
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:46,870
Contain the fire

198
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,960
by dawn.

199
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,440
Protect the women and children.

200
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,540
[Yan]

201
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,270
Enemy sighted!

202
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,000
Full alert!

203
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,270
Attack!

204
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:46,720
Kill them!

205
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,080
Release the arrows!

206
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,870
Kill them!

207
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,270
Kill them!

208
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:26,830
Kill them!

209
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,420
[Qingzhou]

210
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,100
Hurry up and go.

211
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,550
Here.

212
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:40,920
Here.

213
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,000
He's still breathing.

214
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,070
Hurry up.

215
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,310
Come.

216
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,270
Take it easy.

217
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,680
I'll leave him to you.

218
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,550
Uncle,

219
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,160
have any casualties not been removed?

220
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,000
All have been carried out.

221
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,640
Only the fallen soldiers remain.

222
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,790
Big Guy.

223
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,160
Big Guy.

224
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,160
Big Guy.

225
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,110
Big...

226
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,400
Jia.

227
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,830
Big Guy.

228
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,270
Jia.

229
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,580
Big Guy.

230
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,160
Big Guy.

231
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,880
Big Guy.

232
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,680
Big Guy, wake up.

233
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,680
Big Guy.

234
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,440
Big Guy.

235
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,920
Wake up.

236
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,750
Get up.

237
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,310
Get up, Big Guy.

238
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,920
Big Guy, get up.

239
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,640
Get up.

240
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:16,480
You said you'd always be with me!

241
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,480
Wake up.

242
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,880
Get up.

243
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,790
Wake up, Big Guy.

244
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,830
Big Guy, wake up.

245
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,880
We will defend Qingzhou with our lives

246
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,240
and honor their sacrifice.

247
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,790
I underestimated General Weibei.

248
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,830
We've walked into a trap.

249
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,550
Those civilians on the walls

250
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,000
are disguised soldiers.

251
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,750
Reports said

252
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,400
Qingzhou had under a thousand defenders,

253
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,000
but it seems

254
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,880
reinforcements

255
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,000
may have entered the city.

256
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,000
Once the fire spreads,

257
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,110
let's see how long they last.

258
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,550
Pass my order:

259
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,720
postpone the attack.

260
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:16,510
Yes.

261
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,460
[Qingzhou]

262
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,200
How did you know

263
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,720
Mingju would withdraw?

264
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,790
He's naturally cautious.

265
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,590
The empty city ruse works only once.

266
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,720
If he learns our true numbers,

267
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,160
we won't last half a day.

268
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,750
Great!

269
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:53,880
Great!

270
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,720
Great!

271
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,550
The mountain fire is contained.

272
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,030
We have succeeded.

273
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,480
Qingzhou will be safe.

274
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,350
Yes.

275
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,720
Great!

276
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,590
Qingyan,

277
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,960
prepare a feast.

278
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,110
Men,

279
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,640
tomorrow, General Yin

280
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,350
will bring reinforcements.

281
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,440
But the Xiyan army

282
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,920
may attack before dawn.

283
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,920
Qingzhou's forces are weak.

284
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,070
Defense alone

285
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,790
won't suffice.

286
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,680
Thus, I've resolved

287
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,720
to

288
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,640
strike the Xiyan camp tonight.

289
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,000
By halting their advance,

290
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,550
we can

291
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,480
secure time
for reinforcements to arrive.

292
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,400
Men,

293
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,510
in Qingzhou's peril,

294
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,550
let the loyalty of the Weibei Army

295
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,960
be our shield,

296
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,440
and our courage our spear,

297
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,720
defending our people

298
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,110
and land.

299
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,240
General,

300
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,070
be assured.

301
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,310
Tonight,

302
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,720
I'll kill every single one I see.

303
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,400
I'll take down at least ten.

304
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,240
Yang,

305
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,480
you're getting timid.

306
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,790
Why stop at ten?

307
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,070
Kill ten, and I'll get ten taels.

308
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:09,960
Enough

309
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,000
for that jade bracelet

310
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,480
my daughter wants.

311
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,070
I'll aim for a hundred.

312
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,750
My mother dreams of a big house
on Qinglin Lane.

313
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,240
You are ambitious.

314
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,750
Qingzhou is our home.

315
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,880
Did you join the army for this?

316
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,240
Mr. Yuan,

317
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,790
we fight

318
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,960
for better lives,

319
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,640
for ourselves

320
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,880
and for those

321
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,400
we leave behind.

322
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,590
Any special wishes

323
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
beyond the usual rewards?

324
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,880
Let Qingyan record them.

325
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,270
But

326
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,550
I hope

327
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,000
each of you

328
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,880
returns alive to claim your reward.

329
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:49,790
General,

330
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,830
I'd like a post in Zhaojing.

331
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:51,830
Granted.

332
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,270
After this battle,

333
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,640
you'll serve in the Imperial Guard.

334
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,160
So cool.

335
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,790
That's amazing.

336
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,440
The Emperor's guard.

337
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,350
General, I'd like to
open a blacksmith shop.

338
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,920
General, I...

339
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,200
What do you want?

340
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,960
I want

341
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,160
ten gold pieces.

342
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,920
Wishful thinking.

343
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,750
Ten pieces, huh?

344
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,240
Zhang,

345
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,590
I certainly know what you want.

346
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,270
What do I want?

347
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,310
You just want a child

348
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,240
with the girl next door.

349
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,070
The general

350
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,790
can't help with that.

351
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,350
General Qingyan,

352
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,400
what about you?

353
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,510
Yeah.

354
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,200
Qingyan,

355
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,510
write down your wish, too.

356
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,070
Me?

357
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,000
I only wish to stay
by Prince Jing's side.

358
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,680
This is a great moment

359
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,110
to secure something
for your family, isn't it?

360
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,680
Yeah, General Qingyan.

361
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,440
I'm an orphan.

362
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,590
I've followed Prince Jing
since childhood.

363
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,960
He is my family.

364
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,830
You don't understand.

365
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,720
Following him, you can have everything.

366
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:49,880
General,

367
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:50,830
what about you?

368
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:51,960
Yeah, General.

369
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,070
What do you want?

370
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:53,960
Yeah, General.

371
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,270
What do you want?

372
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,880
I wish to be her in-house husband.

373
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,030
Bravo!

374
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,400
Miss Hua,

375
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,830
did you hear that?

376
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:24,160
Say yes!

377
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:29,750
Say yes!

378
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,590
Yes.

379
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:45,880
And your wish,

380
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,880
Miss Hua?

381
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,590
To see snow in Qingzhou again.

382
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,270
As you suspected,

383
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,310
Mingju led his troops
to Qingzhou overnight.

384
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,440
When shall we strike?

385
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,110
Before Mingju returns,

386
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,550
burn their supply camp,

387
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,960
and destroy the siege cannons.

388
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:02,680
Yes.

389
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,240
Great Yan's sneak attack!

I'm an orphan.

435
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,110
I've followed Prince Jing
since childhood.

436

We'll await reinforcements.

441
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:12,670
Don't shoot arrows.

442
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,320
It's General Yin.

443
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,440
