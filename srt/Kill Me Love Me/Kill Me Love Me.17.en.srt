since it's a chronic illness,

37
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,840

Once,

140
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,070
I drugged my teacher at the school
with a sedative,

141
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,750
knocking him unconscious for two days.

142

When my mother found out,

143
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
she gave me a severe punishment.

146

But I found you are good
at calligraphy and painting.

147
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,950
My mother hoped

148
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,000
that I could learn
more poetry and etiquette

149
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,950
and become more composed.

150
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,600
But I

151
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,360
have always aspired to be a general.

152
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,560
So I didn't have much time to sit down

153
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,920
and write or recite books.

154
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,950
After the great fire in Qingzhou,

155
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,950
I became a cripple.

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,160
All day long,

157
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,800
I was either in the wheelchair
or on the bed.

158
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,240
At that time,

159
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,630
besides painting,

160
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,870
I played Go.

00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:09,920
I didn't expect

162
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,120

00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,480

166
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,920
Given your temperament,

167
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,240
I doubt you could stay

168
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,630
in the fruit cake shop for long.

169
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,720
Of course, I couldn't.

170
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,800
But every day,

171
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,750
I just loved to sit there

172
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,000
watching my mother making fruit cakes.

173
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,600
You were craving the fruit cakes, right?

174
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,360
Of course.

175
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,630
Whenever my mother made fruit cakes,

176
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,070
she always saved the ones
with the most filling for me.

you are a general of Great Yan.

What you shoulder

186
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,870
is different from others.

187
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,630
You shouldn't continue to grieve
and be dejected

over someone who has passed away.

189
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,080
Don't worry, Aunt.

190
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,630
Tomorrow, I'll return to the training
ground to drill the troops,

191
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,960
and I will not be negligent.

192
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,360
Well...

193
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,120
You know I'm not talking
about military affairs,

194
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,080
but rather your marriage.

195
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,720
You just said you came here today
to pray and relax.

196
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,270
A Buddhist temple is a place
of peace and quiet,

197
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,480
and it's not suitable to discuss
such worldly matters here.

198
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,630
I'm tired.

199
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,720
Let's go to the side hall
to have a rest.

200
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,700
[Wan'an Hall]

201
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Wan'an Hall?

202
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,600
I don't know

203
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,550
when this Wan'an Hall was built here.

204
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,360
Let's go

205
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,510
take a look.

206
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,440
Luomei,

207
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,750
today's military report informed me
that you led only a dozen light cavalry

208
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,600
[In the 17th year of the Zhaoming era]

209
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,750
to launch a sneak attack
on the enemy's scout camp at night.

210
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,200
My heart sank
as if falling into an ice cave

211
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,120
and then burned
as if doused with fire oil.

212
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,910
I keep thinking of how you are
diligently engaged in your duties,

213
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,200
both day and night.

214
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,440
Luomei,

215
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,960
learning that you would soon return
to the capital with your troops

216
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,600
filled me with joy.

217
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,120
However, yesterday I heard
that my father was worried

218
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,670
about the unrest in Baiyue
and has already sent an urgent decree,

219
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,200
ordering you to divert
and pacify the disturbance.

220
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,670
This means it will be

221
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,480
several more months
before I can see you again.

222
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,030
General,

223
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,840
this Wan'an Hall was built
by His Highness for one person.

224
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,030
The deities enshrined inside are all
to ensure the safety of that one person.

225
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,720
Apart from His Highness,

226
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
there are no other worshippers.

227
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,900
[Hoping to ensure Luomei's
safe and unobstructed journey]

228
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:35,960
Luomei,

229
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,910
going to battle for our country
is your heartfelt wish.

230
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,510
I cannot ride alongside you

231
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,270
nor guarantee

232
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,600
that there will be no wars

233
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,910
or injuries.

234
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,440
I beseech the gods and Buddhas.

235
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,960
Yin Luomei cares for the people

236
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,240
and disregards her own safety.

237
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,270
I don't ask for much.

238
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,840
I spent the night copying scriptures

239
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,120
to accumulate blessings,

240
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,200
hoping to ensure Luomei's
safe and unobstructed journey

241
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,240
and peace in all matters.

242
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,200
Since your first battle,

243
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,120
the Crown Prince has been praying
for your safety,

244
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,480
and this practice has never ceased
over the years.

245
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,840
It seems

246
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,750
I misjudged the Crown Prince,

247
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,750
mistaking his genuine concern

248
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,750
for a desire for military power.

249
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,750
I believe

250
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,150
in His Higness' genuine concern.

251
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,360
Now that you believe in it,

252
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,150
you should agree to this marriage.

253
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,910
I've told you

254
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,720
that in the imperial family,
there is no love,

255
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,120
only favor.

256
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,550
But the Crown Prince truly
cares about you,

257
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,480
which makes it
a really good marriage for you.

258
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,630
His Highness is very nice.

259
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,360
I just haven't made up my mind.

260
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,000
If Prince Jing were still alive,

261
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,910
I would never force you.

262
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,960
But the imperial edict for the arranged
marriage has been issued.

263
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,960
You have to

264
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,480
get married anyway.

265
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,480
If you cannot be with the one you love,

266
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,080
just find a man

267
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,150
who truly loves and protects you.

268
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,000
Giving the man around you a chance

269
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,000
means giving yourself

270
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,870
a chance.

271

[Prayer for Blessings
in the 20th Year of Zhaoming]

00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,670
please remember your promise.

[Wan'an Hall]

278
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:38,840
Your Highness,

279
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,080
when did you arrive?

280
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,840
I saw you were inside
and didn't want to disturb you.

281
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,000
So I've been waiting here.

282
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,670
So you have done so much for me,
Your Highness.

283
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,840
But I am unable
to give you the same in return.

284
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,630
Do you know
that my father wants to reclaim

285
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,910
the Yin family's military power
through your marriage?

286
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,270
If you are willing to marry me,

287
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,670
I will do my best to protect
the Yin family for you and your aunt.

288
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,030
But if I were to use
your genuine feelings

289
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,150
to protect the Yin family,

290
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,510
that would be unfair to you.

291
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,270
Luomei,

292
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:16,270
I...

293
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,320
It doesn't matter.

294
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,720
You don't have to agree now.

295
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,750
But I hope you can remember

296
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,720
that what I said to you

297
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,320
forever counts.

[Wan'an Hall]

299
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,910
May the gods and Buddhas witness

300
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,000
that I built this temple
with no selfish intentions.

301
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,840
But as a mortal,

302
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,670
I have ultimately given in to greed,

303
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,550
desiring to keep my beloved by my side.

304
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,910
If my wishes come true,

305
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,200
even if I were to fall

306

into eternal hell after death,

307
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,670
I would accept it with contentment.

General,

309
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,550
the Crown Prince sent these to you

310

to congratulate you
on returning to the capital.

311
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,240
The best place to watch it has shifted.

312
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,240
In this world, everything changes.

313

Clinging to childhood memories

314
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,960
will make you miss even better sights.

I've never forgotten your ambition.

316
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,070
Even if you become the Empress,

317
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,790
the military power will remain yours.

318
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,480
You'll still be General Yin,

319
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,880
and I'll never confine you to the harem.

The legend about the red foxes
in Lushan is true.

As long as I, Murong Xuanlie, am alive,

328

Tasty.

I'll give you more if you are obedient.

331
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,750
Okay. You'll get more later.

332
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,400
How much longer does he have to
take this medicine?

333
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,790
It's hard to tell.

334
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,590
Based on the current condition,

335
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,240
it'll be at least ten days.

as long as the medicine
doesn't kill him.

00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,680
Each day Prince Jing remains outside

339
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,790
is another day of danger for him.

340
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,270
Don't worry. I understand.

346
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,350
Li Qing would be cured

348
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,870
Great!

349
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,070
I like the gloves

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,390
Look at this.

352
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,350
Does it look like the Dengguo
in Qingzhou?

353
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,000
It's called Red Fruit
in Laowozi Village.

354
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,630
The ones picked early in the morning
are the freshest.

355
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,920
You got up so early these days.

356
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,520
Did you not sleep well at night?

357
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,200
Rise with the sun.

358
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,520
Rest at sunset.

359
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,200
I like the life here

360
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,000
very much.

After avenging Qingzhou,

00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,440
I want to continue

00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:09,920
What about you?

365
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,280
How did you sleep recently?

366
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,240
Do we need to catch fireflies
for lighting?

367
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:13,920
No.

368
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,790
I had no nightmares these days.

369
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,280
Really?

370
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,150
Mei Lin.

371
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,440
Mei Lin.

372
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:23,590
Big Brother.

373
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:27,520
Liu.

374
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,240
Well,

375
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,110
Mei,

376
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,350
when no one is around,

377
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,790
don't call me Big Brother.

378
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,000
I feel awkward.

379
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:40,720
Awkward?

380
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,440
What should I call you then?

381
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,870
Whatever, you can call me anything.

382
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:45,680
In all,

383
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,630
just don't call me Big Brother.

384
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,680
Mu

385
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,000
Rong

386
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:53,870
Jinghe.

387
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,440
Fine.

388
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,590
Just call me by my name.

389
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,310
Murong Jinghe,

390
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:02,760
I'm off to work.

391
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,680
Are you going to dry Tianjing Grass?

392
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,390
I'll go with you.

393
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,680
I'm feeling much better now.

394
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,240
I can work

395
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,590
a bit with you.

396
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,110
Let's go.

397
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,760
Miss, Sir,

398
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,000
you don't need to go.

399
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,870
This basket is for Madam Wang.

400
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,110
Thank you, Wei.

401
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:18,790
Mei,

402
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,150
what do you like to eat?

403
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:20,920
Me?

404
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,070
Mei?

405
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,550
It's the annual Spring Harvest Banquet
of Laowozi Village in a few days.

406
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:31,200
Each family will prepare a dish.
It'll be very lively.

407
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:31,870
Mei,

408
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,440
I'll cook

409
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,280
whatever you like to eat.

410
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,110
Wei, I...

411
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,390
Mei loves dragon meat.

412
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,830
Dragon?

413
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,310
What is it like?

414
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,960
I've never seen any dragon.

415
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:43,630
Wei,

416
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,680
my brother loves talking nonsense.

417
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,830
Don't listen to him.

418
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,240
I like all kinds of food.
Everything is fine.

419
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,480
Mei

420
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,630
is picky about people.

421
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,520
If she doesn't like the man,

422
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,520
whatever he cooks,

423
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,550
she won't like it.

424
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,760
What does Brother-in-law mean?

425
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,680
If she dislikes the man,
she won't like the food he makes.

426
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,440
But Mei told me she likes
all kinds of food just now.

427
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:08,630
Could it be

428
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,520
that Mei also likes me?

429
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,790
I got it.

430
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,000
What did you get?

431
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,550
You understood it wrongly.

432
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,350
What's going on with Wei?

433
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,760
There's something wrong about him.

434
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,760
Stay away from him.

435
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,720
There's something wrong with
the way he looks at you.

436
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,350
What's wrong with it?

437
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,720
Where are you going?

438
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:29,790
I'm going to catch a dragon.

439
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,550
- It smells good.
- Yeah.

440
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,680
My husband never cooks.

441
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,390
This man looks nice.

442
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,480
I heard he can do needlework.

443
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,280
He is very handsome.

444
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,390
Is he married?

445
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,630
My sister-in-law isn't married yet.

446
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,870
We can ask him later.

447
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:06,620
Right.

448
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,790
Sir, please wait.

449
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,070
Erniu's mother says you...

450
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,000
I'm married.

451
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,390
Married?

452
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,000
You heard it, didn't you?

453
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,550
Madam Wang said

454
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,480
his family suffered a calamity.
I'm afraid his wife was...

455
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,720
My wife is very fine,

456
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,590
and I'll only love her

457
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,920
in my lifetime.

458
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:36,440
Thank you for the kitchen.

459
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,070
This is her favorite snake broth.

460
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,590
I need to send it to her while it's hot.

461
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:40,870
Well...

462
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:45,760
His...

463
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,350
Is his wife also in the village?

464
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,110
Isn't he here just with his sister?

465
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,150
Sister?

466
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:56,830
Wei,

467
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,070
these are...

468
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,240
These are all betrothal gifts for you.

469
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,830
I want to marry you.

470
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:04,920
I can hunt

471
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,720
and farm.

472
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,680
I won't let you starve.

473
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,070
Wei,

474
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,240
we are leaving soon.

475
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,440
Where will you be going?

476
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,240
I'll go...

477
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,350
Wherever you go, I'll follow you.

478
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,110
Anyway, I'm the only one left
in my family.

479
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:21,680
Mei Lin,

480
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,440
you saved my life before.

481
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,760
I won't let you live a hard life.

482
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,440
Wei,

483
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,760
actually, it was my brother
who saved you.

484
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,680
Don't worry.

485
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,790
We'll become family
after we get married.

486
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,480
I'll treat my brother-in-law well.

487
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,000
Actually, I'm married.

488
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,720
I know.

489
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,920
Madam Wang told me about it.

490
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,150
Your husband has died.

491
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:39,350
He...

492
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,350
Who said I had died?

493
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,310
Brother-in-law?

494
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,520
Who is your brother-in-law?

495
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,280
I'm her husband.

496
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:54,790
You...

497
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,200
Aren't you siblings?

498
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,760
We are not siblings.

499
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,830
We are childhood sweethearts.

500
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,280
During our journey,

501
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,720
I made many mistakes

502
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,830
and made my wife angry.

503
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,830
That's why she didn't want

504
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,920
to mention our relationship
in front of others.

505
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,350
Mei,

506
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,310
it's been so long.
You should be calm now.

507
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,110
It was my fault

508
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,280
for making Wei misunderstand.

509
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,200
I...

510
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,960
They are a couple.

511
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,590
Madam,

512
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:27,720
it was all my fault.

513
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,390
It's okay.

514
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:30,630
Well,

515
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,920
I have good taste, right?

516
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,390
Just

517
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,550
give up.

518
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,040
Stop it.

519
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,240
Don't cry.

520
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,040
A real man doesn't need to worry
about getting a wife.

521
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,720
Madam.

522
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,680
All couples quarrel.

523
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,830
By compromising with each other,

524
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,390
you'll stay together for a lifetime,

525
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,110
right?

526
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,040
I think your husband's attitude
is quite nice.

527
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:55,870
You can forgive him.

528
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,480
Yes.

529
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,040
Actually, I forgave him long ago.

530
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,350
That's good to hear.

531
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,070
That's good to hear.

532
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:19,760
Come on.

533
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:20,680
Try it.

534
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,790
Didn't you go to catch a dragon?

535
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,550
Your eyes are so poor

536
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:36,680
that you caught a snake?

537
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,110
The Book of Strange Records mentions

538
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,960
that snakes, originally named Hui,

539
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,680
transform into dragons
after 1,000 years of cultivation.

540
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,550
So, a dragon is essentially a snake,

541
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,550
and dragon meat is snake meat.

542
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,480
Roasted snake meat is more delicious.

543
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,550
You previously hurt
your spleen and stomach.

544
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,520
Meat broth will help with digestion.

545
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,590
You can have roasted snake meat
some other time.

546
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,070
It was my first time cooking.

547
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,350
Let me try it first.

548
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,680
I'm not picky about food.

549
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:38,590
How is it?

550
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,110
Doesn't it taste better
than the dragons in the sky?

551
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,350
It's tasty.

552
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:45,680
I owe you this.

553
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,480
When we were in the wilderness, I said

554
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,150
as long as we could make it alive,

555
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,830
I would treat you to dragon meat.

556
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,790
Actually, I said Meat Dragon.

557
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,350
The Meat Dragon was made by my mother.

558
00:27:58,870 --> 00:27:59,350
Meat Dragon?

559
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,830
It's a type of cooked wheaten food,

560
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:02,790
a steamed bun

561
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,040
with meat in it.

562
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,630
In Qingzhou,

563
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,480
every family made Meat Dragons
for joyful occasions.

564
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:08,870
Haven't you tried it?

565
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,920
I seem to have seen it in a border city

566
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,150
I passed by.

567
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,200
They call them meat buns.

568
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,280
How about we make Meat Dragons

569
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,920
for the Spring Harvest Banquet?

570
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,350
I'll take a try then.

571
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:23,870
I think I can make them.

572
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,200
As long as they are cooked.

573
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,480
As a couple, we can't just eat for free.

574
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,550
We should at least

575
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,350
prepare something.

576
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,390
Since you are a couple,

577
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,550
don't sleep on separate beds.

578
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:58,720
Madam.

579
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,040
Madam Wang.

580
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,630
We'll sleep separately.

581
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,150
It'll be more spacious.

582
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,720
How can you say that?

583
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,240
Couples have arguments,

584
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,240
but they make up quickly.

585
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,440
If you keep sleeping separately,

586
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,720
your feelings will fade.

587
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,520
Why are you smiling?

588
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,790
If you offend your wife again,

589
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,110
I can't help you anymore.

590
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,240
Yes.

591
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,150
I'll be obedient.

592
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,040
I'll listen to you and my wife.

593
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,720
That's more like it.

594
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,070
Take care, Madam.

595
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,590
We need

596
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:34,440
to listen to Madam Wang.

597
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,240
We've slept on the same bed anyway.

598
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,040
Are you

599
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,680
asleep?

600
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,200
Rest at sunset.

601
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,000
She should be asleep.

602
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,150
You

603
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,110
can't fall asleep?

604
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,590
If you can't fall asleep either,

605
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,280
I can talk with you.

606
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:47,790
I...

607
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,680
I...

608
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,480
I have nothing to say.

609
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:00,430
Sleep then.

610
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,080
Actually,

611
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,040
I'm also quite sleepy.

612
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,560
There is a mosquito.

613
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,280
It's dead.

614
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:40,910
We can sleep now.

615
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,630
I hope such days

616
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,350
can last forever.

617
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:15,780
[Yanming Palace]

618
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,480
We've searched for such a long time.

619
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,150
How could there be no traces?

620
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,080
Your Majesty,

621
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,000
here is the tea I just made.

622
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,110
Please try it.

623
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:00,760
Sit.

624
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,520
Let me see.

625
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,000
Fortunately, the burn that day

626
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,080
did not leave a scar.

627
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,560
The burn ointment bestowed
by Your Majesty is very effective.

628
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,080
Thank you,

629
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,190
Your Majesty.

630
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,110
Concubine Yan,

631
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,870
you are afraid of me?

632
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,350
No.

633
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:29,760
Your Majesty, you are a benevolent ruler
and have been very nice to me.

634
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,150
I'm not afraid.

635
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,870
I don't remember

636
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,040
you were skilled in these things.

637
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,520
Is the tea I made not good?

638
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,480
I'll make another pot.

639
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:13,960
No.

640
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,040
You did it very well.

641
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,670
I'm just not used to it.

642
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,000
Thank you for your praise, Your Majesty.

643
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,110
There is a lot I need to learn.

644
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,190
Maybe I scared her that day.

645
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:40,270
Concubine Yan,

646
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,190
take a look.

647
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:44,960
I don't dare.

648
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,110
I allow you to read it.

649
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,400
Look.

650
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,750
The Prince Heir?

651
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,630
My brother has become
the Prince Heir of Xiyan.

652
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,190
I thank Your Majesty
on behalf of my brother.

653
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,790
I know

654
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,670
my brother relied
on Your Majesty's support

655
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,190
to become the Prince Heir of Xiyan.

656
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,000
It's because your brother
has the capability.

657
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,480
I merely took pleasure in his success.

658
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,710
From now on, there will be
someone backing you up.

659
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,190
So,

660
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,560
don't be afraid of me.

661
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,710
I'm never afraid of Your Majesty.

662
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:35,840
I don't need you

663
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,590
to serve me here.

664
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:38,840
It's late at night.

665
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,400
Go back to Fanghua Palace and rest.

666
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

667
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,590
Don't you think

668
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,230
she is acting more and more properly
as a concubine of Great Yan?

669
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,880
Concubine Yan is smart.

670
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,000
She learned the rules very fast.

671
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,080
Today, I heard the Noble Consort

672
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,150
praising her

673
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,880
for being sensible and courteous.

674
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,790
I just don't want to see her

675
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,880
being so well-behaved.

676
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,840
Send a letter of congratulations
to the Prince Heir of Xiyan.

677
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,880
Sure enough,

678
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,440
he didn't disappoint me.

679
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

680
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,560
Your Highness,

681
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,590
you're the reincarnation
of the Sun Kunlun.

682
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,230
So the Princess Heir

683
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,230
should be the reincarnation
of the Moon Kunlun.

684
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,840
The union of the Sun Kunlun
and Moon Kunlun

685
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,190
brings the harmony of Yin and Yang,

686
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,400
ensuring favorable weather.

687
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,400
It will surely bless Xiyan

688
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:03,750
with everlasting prosperity.

689
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,560
As long as the Sun Kunlun
and Moon Kunlun unite,

690
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,920
Your Majesty will surely enjoy
a prolonged life.

691
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,480
Heaven begins with one.
Earth completes with six.

692
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,710
Once one and six unite,
all origins become clear.

693
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,750
May this be the guiding principle
and ultimate source of life.

694
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,310
Please, heavenly deities,

695
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,920
guide us to find the Moon Kunlun now.

696
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,710
How is it?

697
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:31,750
Found her.

698
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,590
Your Majesty, I've found her.

699
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,080
The sacred woman reincarnated
from the Moon Kunlun

700
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,520
is in Zhaojing of the Yan Dynasty.

701
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,310
The Princess Heir is from Great Yan?

702
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:42,840
Father,

703
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,630
the Sun Kunlun and Moon Kunlun

704
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,560
are the divine envoys
of the Xiyan heavenly deities.

705
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,560
Now that the sacred woman
is the Moon Kunlun,

706
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,590
she must be from Xiyan.

707
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,560
I suppose

708
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,880
she is just temporarily residing
in the Yan Dynasty.

709
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,310
Your Highness,

710
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:59,790
you have a point.

711
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,310
Send our men to search
for her immediately.

712
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,560
Make sure to find the sacred woman

713
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,920
and bring her back to Xiyan.

714
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,230
Father,

715
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,440
I request to speak.

716
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,670
I've been in the Yan Dynasty
for several years

717
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,520
and I'm quite familiar

718
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:13,790
with Zhaojing.

719
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,790
If I am to search for the sacred woman,

720
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,920
success is assured.

721
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,630
You can't.

722
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,960
You are the Prince Heir.

723
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:23,560
Why should you go to the Yan Dynasty?

724
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,360
This is something confidential.

725
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,440
You can't tell it to anyone.

726
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,440
Father,

727
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,560
coincidentally,

728
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,520
I've received
the letter of congratulations

729
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,150
sent by the Emperor of the Yan Dynasty.

730
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:36,560
He invites me

731
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,080
to discuss border trade.

732
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,960
Isn't this a great opportunity

733
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,920
given by the heaven deities?

734
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,310
God bless Xiyan.

from Great Yan]

736
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:00,880
Alright.

737
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,440
Since this is about your Princess Heir,

738
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,110
you'll find her

739

in person.

740
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,670
Yes, Father.

741
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,480
Your Highness, you are wise.

742
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,670
How were you sure

743
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,520
His Majesty

744
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,960
would believe in the reincarnation
of the Sun and Moon divine envoys?

745
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,080
Who among those at the pinnacle of power

746
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,750
does not yearn for immortality?

747
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,670
But you

748
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,630
don't believe in immortality,
Your Highness.

749
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,080
Immortality.

750
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,000
Immortality is good.

751
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,000
Immortality

752
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,400
would eliminate the regret
of unfulfilled ambitions

753
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,110
and dispel the ignorance
of overreached attempts.

754
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,710
Even as the seas turn
and the earth changes,

755
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,590
deep emotions are not bound
by shallow fates.

756
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,560
How wonderful it would be!

757
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:05,480
Mei Lin,

758
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,150
my Princess Heir,

759
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,920
wait for me to go back.
