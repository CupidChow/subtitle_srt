and get the antidote.

185
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,870
Instead of getting the antidote,

186
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,550
you ended up facing the Shadow Works'
attempt to silence you.

187
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,480
But you came to me today.

188
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,390
Just get me out of here.

189
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,840
I'll take care of the rest.

190
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,480
Whether you can leave
the Imperial Prison alive

191
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,870
depends on the quality

192
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,320
of your evidence.

193
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,600
I saw the arsonists with my own eyes.

194
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,510
They were wearing
the Weibei Army's token.

195
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,960
The token was fake.

196
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,200
Where is the token?

197
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,790
After I get out of the Imperial Prison,

198
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,960
I'll give it to you.

199
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,600
Betting on both sides

200
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,360
leads to an earlier death.

201
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,270
You and I are both living for the dead.

202
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,870
If the wronged souls
cannot rest in peace,

203
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,270
we

204
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,120
dare not die.

205
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,000
Sir,

206
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,120
we are one step late.

207
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,000
It seems the fake death potion
is useless now.

208
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:24,100
[Imperial Prison]

209
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,360
My lord,

210
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,120
may I have a word with you?

211
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,870
It's improper for the diplomatic hostage
from Xiyan to go to the Imperial Prison.

212
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,750
You're a wise man.

213
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,360
You would surely know to evaluate
the situation and act accordingly.

214
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,870
Why go against the tide

215
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,390
and invite trouble?

216
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,120
It seems

217
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,120
you've guessed my plan.

218
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,840
You've overestimated me.

219
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,590
Did you go to the Imperial Prison

220
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,350
to kill

221
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,000
or rescue someone?

222
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,160
To kill.

223
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,160
You are a righteous man, Mr. Yue Qin.

224
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,920
Killing is not your style.

225
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,270
You've also overestimated me, my lord.

226
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:23,880
His Majesty is benevolent

227
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,440
and does not wish to see another war
between the two nations.

228
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,640
If I kill your assassin,

229
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,110
it can prove Xiyan's innocence

230
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,640
and avoid suspicion
between the two nations.

231
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,550
I merely wish to earn a reputation

232
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,750
for being pragmatic before His Majesty.

233
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,110
Do you know who she is?

234
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,510
She was an orphan
in Qingzhou ten years ago.

235
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,070
She merely became a Beauty
in the peace-making marriage delegation.

236
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,550
This has nothing to do with Xiyan.

237
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,750
You don't have to kill anyone.

238
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,240
Since she is from Qingzhou,

239
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,000
if you seek imperial pardon
for the orphan of Qingzhou,

240
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,720
it would be your opportunity
to take credit.

241
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,400
I've heard

242
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,030
you and His Majesty are friends
despite the difference in age.

243
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,960
You must know very clearly His Majesty

244
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,310
strongly resents any rehash
of what happened in Qingzhou.

245
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,440
You are setting me up for trouble.

246
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,310
As I see it,

247
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,830
the most trouble-free solution

248
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,030
is to kill the orphan of Qingzhou

249
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,510
secretly.

250
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:25,960
Please don't do that.

251
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,400
It has nothing to do with Xiyan.

252
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,200
If you meddle any further,

253
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,590
it really would be inappropriate.

254
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,400
He wants to save her.

255
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,310
He and Mei Lin
must be old acquaintances.

256
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:12,680
Investigate them.

257
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,550
Yes.

258
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,400
Your Highness,

259
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,000
I believe

260
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,160
Prince Jing orchestrated
the assassination attempt in the palace

261
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,400
to lure out my Momai Warriors

262
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,270
and take this opportunity...

263
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,920
Take this opportunity to reopen
the old case in Qingzhou?

264
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,830
She is obviously Prince Jing's bait.

265
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,310
Yet you've taken the bait.

266
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,720
Your Highness,

267
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,680
I listen to your instructions every day.

268
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,830
I know very well how to get
someone killed without doing it myself.

269
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,160
Please rest assured.

270
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:47,030
I'll use the Xiyan gentleman
to achieve the goal.

271
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,110
Even if Prince Jing catches my man,

272
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,640
the Xiyan guy will be the scapegoat.

273
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,240
You even want to drag
the Xiyan guy into this?

274
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,200
Won't it make things worse?

275
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,350
The man you sent to kill her

276
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,070
is now under Prince Jing's control.

277
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,400
The only option now is
to lose something to survive.

278
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,590
You can't keep any
of those Momai Warriors.

279
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,830
Your Highness.

280
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,720
Sir,

281
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,160
I've kept the second-rank
official position for you.

282
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,590
Why leave the others an opportunity
to use those Warriors against you?

283
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,200
The battle in the court
is the battle of public opinion.

284
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,880
The means must be presentable.

285
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,440
If the Momai Warriors are discovered,

286
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,480
at most, I will be accused
of misjudging my subordinates.

287
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,720
But you...

288
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,000
You committed arson in Qingzhou

289
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,400
and attempted to assassinate a prince.

290
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,350
Each is a capital offense punishable
by the execution of all your clans.

291
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,640
It's

292
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,030
for your own good.

293
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,480
Make a quick decision.

294
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Thank you for reminding me,
Your Highness.

295
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,920
I'll get it done right away.

296
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,680
Minister Zhang, Your Highness,

297
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,680
Prince Jing has entered the palace.

298
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,880
Minister Zhang,

299
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,550
I hope it's not too late.

300
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,160
I can't kill her.

301
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,110
But I can't keep her, either.

302
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,680
The grudges of Qingzhou

303
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,640
can lead to changes over time.

304
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,640
It's my fault.

305
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,510
I am willing to atone for it

306
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,200
to resolve the grudges of Qingzhou.

307
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,720
Do you think pardoning one person

308
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,400
from Qingzhou can erase the hatred?

309
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,510
To reestablish Qingzhou
is not difficult.

310
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,510
The challenging part
is winning back the people's trust.

311
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,680
The Pingnan Army is now dealing
with various constraints in Qingzhou

312
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,590
to clean up the mess you've made!

313
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,070
I accept any punishment.

314
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,400
Fine.

315
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,400
There was enough punishment.

316
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,640
Qingzhou belongs to the Murong family.

317
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,510
Does my son

318
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,400
have to compensate them with his life?

319
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,400
Get up.

320
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,590
Vile people fear power
but do not cherish virtue.

321
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,030
The orphan of Qingzhou dared to attempt
an assassination in the palace.

322
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,400
We have to execute her

323
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,160
to assert our divine might.

324
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,680
Father,

325
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,000
you can't kill her.

326
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,550
In Jingbei,

327
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,240
that Beauty had many times
to get close to me.

328
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,440
But why did she take action
at the peace-making marriage banquet?

329
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,070
There must be a scheme behind this.

330
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,400
Some people want to use
the grudges of Qingzhou

331
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,960
to incite trouble.

332
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,790
No matter Mei Lin

333
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,830
is an orphan of Qingzhou
or a peace-making Beauty,

334
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,270
she can't be killed.

335
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,590
If we kill her,

336
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,750
we will fall into the enemies' trap.

337
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,030
If the orphan of Qingzhou is killed,

338
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,160
it will cause the people
to bear a grudge,

339
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
which will endanger the state.

340
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,350
If the peace-making Beauty is killed,

341
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,960
it will lead to mutual suspicion
between the two nations,

342
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,640
affecting the overall peace-making
marriage arrangement.

343
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,240
Do you have a solution?

344
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,550
Father,

345
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,480
Mei Lin tried to assassinate me

346
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,480
because I summoned her rudely

347
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,590
and insulted her before.

348
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,270
As a woman, she hates me

349
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,960
with only personal feelings involved.

350
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,680
It has nothing to do
with the grudges in Qingzhou

351
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,000
or the peace-making
marriage arrangement.

352
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,550
You are not a lecher.

353
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,790
This excuse

354
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,240
is not sufficient to convince others.

355
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,270
Father,

356
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:32,680
men

357
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:33,960
can change.

358
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,270
People believe that General Weibei

359
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,590
committed arson
and a massacre back then.

360
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,270
They will also believe

361
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,030
that Prince Jing

362
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,750
is now absurdly lustful.

363
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,310
Your Majesty.

364
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,110
- Your Majesty.
- Your Highness.

365

for mercy and pardon.

harboring resentment.

with the peace-making marriage.

Therefore, the death penalty
is pardoned.

395

The punishment will be
carried out before the throne.

punished by flogging.

00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,110
When General Weibei attacked the city,
I was abandoned by Xiyan.

549
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,000
I nearly committed suicide.

550
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,510
Without your help,

551
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,800
I wouldn't have lived till this day.

552
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,630
I have not yet repaid

553
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,480
your life-saving grace

554
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,030
and have always felt guilty about it.

555
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,000
Back then,

556
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,190
you saved yourself.

557
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:51,920
Please take a seat.

558
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,630
I did it to repay the favor.

559
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,960
In the 15th year of the Zhaoming era,

560
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,400
you released all the Qingzhou servants
in your mansion.

561
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,440
My whole family was among them.

562
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,480
I was too little at that time.

563
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,670
But my parents told me

564
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,480
Mr. Yue Qin had helped Xiyan.

565
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:16,760
They asked me to remember
and repay the favor.

566
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,190
Sir,

567
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,400
you don't owe me anything.

568
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,550
I do.

569
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,480
I released the servants

570
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,960
just for the reputation of benevolence.

571
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,670
You have given me

572
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,360
a chance to stay alive.

573
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:39,960
Well,

574
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,760
let's consider the Dengguo Cakes
you sent into the Imperial Prison

575
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,550
a gesture of repayment.

576
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,280
Thank you so much.

577
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,280
I'm in no position to talk you

578
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,440
into forgetting the grudges in Qingzhou.

579
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,400
But after all, he is a prince
of Great Yan.

580
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,440
To seek revenge, you must
be cautious with your plan.

581
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,320
But now I only want to stay alive.

582
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,110
You'll stay alive and live well then.

583
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,030
Now, the most important thing
is to recuperate.

584
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,550
I've brought you some tonics.

585
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,710
They are all for nourishing the body.

586
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,590
No matter what,

587
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,320
you said before,

588
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,590
"Keep moving forward,
and you will find a way to survive.

589
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,480
The road will be brighter
and brighter as you go."

590
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,190
I should stop disturbing you now.

591
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,590
I will come to see you again.

592
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,150
Be careful.

593
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,360
Thank you, sir.

594
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,070
Red Coix Seed.

595
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,280
Your Highness,

596
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,400
I've silenced all 300

597
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,550
Momai Warriors.

598
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,320
Zhang Yin,

599
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,590
you are too impatient.

600
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,320
If I hadn't asked you to be silent,

601
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,630
you would've missed this good show.

602
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:56,630
Earlier, I lost my composure

603
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,440
and nearly disrupted
Your Highness's plans.

604
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,400
But you are quite efficient this time.

605
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,630
Your Highness,

606
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,150
Prince Jing has returned to the capital

607
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,000
to re-investigate the old case
in Qingzhou.

608
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,710
He won't let us off so easily.

609
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:17,670
No.

610
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,360
He won't let me off.

611
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,360
I committed arson in Qingzhou.

612
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,070
I cannot escape the death penalty.

613
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:25,840
But...

614
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,030
But if

615
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,960
Prince Jing clears his name
from the massacre,

616
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,710
he will be known as the meritorious
general who has reclaimed Qingzhou.

617
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,110
It will be effortless for him to compete
for the position of crown prince.

618
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,880
Please get prepared as soon as possible,
Your Highness.

619
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,840
As long as you are sincere to me,

620
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:48,510
I

621
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,840
will not treat you poorly.

622
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,710
Thank you, Your Highness.

623
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,440
Sir,

624
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,670
the blood on your hand...

625
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:01,800
I...

626
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,550
I understand.

627
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:03,800
I'll wash it off right away.

628
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,280
Wang Quan,

629
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,230
the Warriors in Wenhua Pavilion
must still be alive.

630
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,550
Send your men to silence them now.

631
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,480
Zhang Yin actually
deceived Your Highness?

632
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:19,230
He's getting bolder and bolder now.

633
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:22,440
I value his boldness.

634
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,550
It's a pity that he's just

635
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,590
too greedy.

636
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:26,880
Understood.

637
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,670
I know what to do now.

638
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,920
I will get the Warriors

639
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:32,920
to await their doom.

640
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:40,760
General Yin

641
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,110
is back.

642
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,340
[Yin Luomei, General of Great Yan]

643
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:12,880
General,

644
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:14,030
shall we take a break before we go?

645
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:14,920
General.
