[Episode 19]

19
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,870
How come Your Highness arrived first?

20
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,030
Your Highness.

21
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,750
I heard Concubine Yan is ill

22
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,750
and got anxious...

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,840
I see.

24
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,430
I was inspecting the patrol

25
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,360
and arrived just in time to welcome you.

26
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,190
Thank you for welcoming me in person.

27
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,360
Please enter the city with me.

28
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,080
There will be people
welcoming the envoy.

29
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,520
We must show up in front of everyone

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,240
so that all the officials
will know I'm back alive.

31
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,630
This way,

32
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,560
the Crown Prince can't kill me

33
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,400
for impersonating a prince.

34
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:04,870
Yue Qin

35
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,360
should recognize me
by the Qingzhou Knot.

36
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,840
He can help us get into the city.

37
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,590
But

38
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,280
I'm worried about your safety.

39
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,680
I'll protect myself well.

40
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,030
Like you said,

41
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,960
only by staying alive
can you take revenge.

42
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,030
By the way,

43
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,150
Whatever he says,

44
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,680
don't listen

45
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,960
or promise him anything.

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,520
I...

47
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,710
I mean

48
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,280
I'll repay Yue Qin's favor.

49
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,360
You don't need to worry

50
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,560
or make any promises to him.

51
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,080
I don't want you
constantly thinking about him.

52
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,870
Got it.

53
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,840
Your memorial on the border trade

54
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,800
has been submitted.

55
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,080
The details of the deliberations

56
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,520
will be considered by my father.

57
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,310
His Majesty is busy
with official duties.

58
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,150
No rush.

59
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,870
With your current status,

60
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,160
you need not remain
in this small Court of State Ceremonial.

61
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,040
You may move to the Xiaoxiang Courtyard
I've prepared for you.

62
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,120
It's more spacious

63
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,070
and elegant.

64
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,720
You don't have to worry about this.

65
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,310
I'm used to staying
in the Court of State Ceremonial.

66
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,310
I didn't expect

67
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,870
everything here

68
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,480
remained the same.

69
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,560
Since you left,

70
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,360
no external guests
have been received here.

71
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:37,830
By the way,

72
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,160
I have

73
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,720
obtained a token from my father for you,

74
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,600
allowing you to enter
and leave Fanghua Palace freely.

75
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,630
This will make it easier for you
to meet Concubine Yan.

76
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,190
Thank you to His Majesty

77
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,190
and Your Highness.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,870
I have heard
your care for Fanghua Palace.

79
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,270
I am very grateful.

80
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,120
I have prepared some gifts

81
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,270
to congratulate Your Highness
and General Yin on your wedding.

82
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,630
You are too kind.

83
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,950
I like your farewell gift very much.

84
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,480
I'm just returning the favor.

85
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,160
Besides,

86
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,630
you and I

87
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,920
are on the same boat now.

88
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,870
Upon arriving in Great Yan,

89
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,720
I heard of Prince Jing's passing.

90
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,390
Now, Your Highness
stands alone at the pinnacle,

91
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,830
no longer sharing the boat.

92
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,390
As the Prince Heir of Xiyan,

93
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,480
I shall not meddle

94
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,720
in Great Yan's affairs.

95
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,560
I took your boat

96
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,560
for the peace of our realms.

97
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,430
Peace between our realms?

98
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,000
This is the desire
of the Great Yan Emperor as well.

99
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,270
Fine.

100
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,120
So you only take the Emperor's boat.

101
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,070
The Crown Prince is the future Emperor.

102
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,720
Don't Your Highness
have confidence in yourself?

103
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,950
Prince Jing has passed away.

104
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,920
I stand alone at the top.

105
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,120
I will remember

106
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,600
what you said today.

107
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,510
Her Highness is ill.

108
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,680
I feel worried.

109
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,430
So I misspoke.

110
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,070
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

111
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,000
You've had a long and tiring journey.

112
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,870
I won't disturb you further.

113
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,600
Your Highness, it's been traced back.

114
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,800
This is Tianjing Grass
from Yongtai Pharmacy.

115
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,510
As we entered the city,

116
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,800
their caravan was also arriving.

117
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:17,720
Your Highness,

118
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,240
should I send people

119
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,360
to look for Miss Mei Lin
outside the city?

120
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,950
The Crown Prince tried hard
to win me over.

121
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,070
Could

122
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,560
Prince Jing still be alive?

123
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,430
She should be safe for now.

124
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,750
We've just entered Great Yan,

125
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,870
and we're drawing attention.

126
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,750
Sending someone

127
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,270
could endanger her.

128
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,310
I'll visit Zigu at the palace.

129
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,800
Get a prescription for me
from Yongtai Pharmacy.

130
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,270
Yes.

Where is the princess?

136
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,670
You may leave.

Zigu,

139
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,040
I'm back.

140
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,910
Qin,

141
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,400
I'm sorry.

142
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,430
I promised you to look after Mei Lin.

143
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,950
I didn't expect...

144
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:00,520
She is fine.

145
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,120
Really?

146
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,830
You...

147
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,480
You are comforting me, right?

148
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,790
Of course not.

149
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,310
I assure you

150
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,550
Mei Lin is alive.

151
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,120
You've seen her, haven't you?

152
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,240
Why don't you bring her back?

153
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,550
Qin, I know

154
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,240
you want to keep me out of this,

155
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,360
but I've grown up

156
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,040
and can handle it.

157
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,710
Mei Lin is now

158
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,480
in a safe place.

159
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,070
When the time is right,

160
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,000
she will return.

161
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,070
Don't tell anyone.

162
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:38,710
Besides,

163
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,480
it's about Great Yan's internal affairs,

164
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,400
and your involvement

165
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,590
could implicate you.

166
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,670
I believe you.

167
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,590
As long as Mei Lin is fine.

168
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:08,950
Mr. Yue Qin.

169
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,240
Mei Lin.

170
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,880
I didn't expect you back so soon.

171
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,590
You're the Prince Heir now.

172
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,160
Congratulations, Your Highness.

173
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,640
But I feel it took too long.

174
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,310
Did you see the princess
after returning?

175
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,310
Zigu misses you very much.

176
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,160
She feels she hasn't protected you well.

177
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,950
I couldn't bear her sadness,

178
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,280
so I told her you are alive.

179
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,160
Rest assured, I instructed her

180
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,790
not to tell anyone.

181
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,240
I trust the princess.

182
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,120
The princess treats me well.

183
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,120
It's my sincerity that lacks.

184
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,590
Mei Lin,

185
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,000
you always think of others.

186
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,790
You didn't tell Zigu
to avoid involving her.

187
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,120
I'm glad

188
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,710
you sought my help

189
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,070
this time.

190
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,040
I've heard about
what happened with you and Prince Jing.

191
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,160
But I guess

192
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,760
Prince Jing isn't dead.

193
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,950
If you had truly killed him,

194
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,310
you wouldn't have come to me,

195
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,400
and the Crown Prince wouldn't
enforce strict security

196
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,520
at the city gates against you.

197
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,830
The city

198
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,280
is filled with
the Crown Prince's informants.

199
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,670
It's hard to guard against enemies,

200
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,760
even with your skills.

201
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,480
Mei Lin...

202
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,670
Don't worry, Your Highness.

203
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,790
I won't risk my life recklessly.

204
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,880
I know.

205
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:38,790
Tomorrow,

206
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,310
I'll gift the Crown Prince a Hequ Horse.

207
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,430
This horse responds
to the Xiyan horse-taming tune

208
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,880
when you whistle.

209
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,070
I'll teach you the whistle to control
the horse and create chaos,

210
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,950
giving you the opportunity
to enter the city.

211
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,550
I thought you would...

212
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,950
That I would stop you again?

213
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,360
Since you refused

214
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,280
to return to Xiyan with me last time,

215
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,520
I've realized

216
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,040
you won't leave Zhaojing

217
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,950
until your revenge is accomplished.

218
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,670
I took pains to become
the Prince Heir of Xiyan

219
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,160
to assist,

220
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,520
not obstruct, you.

221
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,590
Thank you, Your Highness.

222
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,240
Please teach me
to whistle the horse-taming tune.

223
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,040
If a single note is wrong,

224
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,480
the horse won't obey the command.

225
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,480
I can learn it.

226
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:35,880
Come on.

227
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,790
Your Highness,

228
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,590
This Nanhai coral tree
is from the Prince of Nan'an,

229
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,120
along with ten hu of East Sea pearls.
[*Ancient Chinese unit of volume]

230
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,790
The Gongcheng Marquis's Mansion

231
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,280
sent 100 bolts of pearl silk

232
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,830
and 100 bolts of tribute silk brocade.

233
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:56,910
Alright.

234
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,710
Luomei doesn't like these items.

235
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,480
The Armor Workshop just made such trash?

236
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,950
Mr. He,

237
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,670
are you being dismissive
of His Highness?

238
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,430
I don't dare.

239
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:16,550
Your Highness,

240
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,120
this batch of fish-scale armor

241
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,640
was forged with the latest techniques
at the Armor Workshop.

242
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,760
Even

243
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,280
the Imperial Guards
haven't received it yet.

244
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,160
What about the Red Forge Armor?

245
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,000
Your Highness's urgent request

246
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,520
has the craftsmen working day and night.

247
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,310
but...

248
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,760
Rest assured, Your Highness.

249
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,070
I won't delay
Your Highness's important matters.

250
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,640
I'll take my leave.

251
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,190
Your Highness,

252
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,950
Though the Emperor has approved
your marriage to General Yin,

253
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,430
it is still within the mourning period
for Prince Jing.

254
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,790
Wouldn't such an ostentatious
betrothal gift

255
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,000
displease the Emperor?

256
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,280
The Emperor's approval of our marriage
has already caused him displeasure.

257
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,160
Why should I be cautious
and let Luomei suffer?

258
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,190
I believe my father will
understand my feelings.

259
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,120
He must take care

260
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,120
and not become angry.

261
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,120
Your Majesty,

262
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,880
The Crown Prince is a bit impulsive.

263
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,280
Should I

264
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,830
go and talk to him?

265
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,070
As to the matter concerning Luomei,

266
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,640
he won't even listen to me.

267
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,710
How can he listen to you?

268
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,000
His Highness is truly devoted.

269
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,520
Forget it.

270
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,120
He must shoulder
the burden of Great Yan,

271
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
facing many compromises
and choices ahead.

272
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,120
Without a close companion by his side,

273
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,000
the days of ruling alone

274
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,520
will be difficult.

275
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,000
Your Majesty.

276
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,160
Your Majesty,

277
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:14,160
how about letting Concubine Yan come
to serve Your Majesty?

278
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:16,710
Well?

279
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,590
Do you want to slack off?

280
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,550
Please pardon me, Your Majesty.

281
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,520
I have served Your Majesty
for many years

282
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,120
and have never seen you bestow

283
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,760
such favor on any consort,

284
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,550
not even the late Empress Dejia.

285
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,880
This level of blessing
for Concubine Yan,

286
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,520
for her and for Xiyan, is a good thing.

287
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:39,520
But

288
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,520
I don't understand.

289
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,480
Why

290
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,310
Your Majesty recently

291
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,950
has withdrawn this favor?

292
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,760
Feathers of the sky,
when tamed by humans,

293
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,070
are easily perished.

294
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,950
If she is a free bird,

295
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,430
this palace

296
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,640
is her cage.

297
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,520
It will confine her
and diminish her spirit.

298
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,830
I'm much older than her.

299
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,590
I will inevitably pass before her.

300
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,160
If she has a child,

301
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,880
she'll have to stay in this cage

302
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,520
for the rest of her life.

303
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,670
Your Majesty means...

304
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,640
After I pass away,

305
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,790
send her back to Xiyan.

306
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,640
Her Highness is
the peace-making marriage princess.

307
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,120
If so...

308
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,120
The peace-making marriage princess
is just a symbol.

309
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,310
True peace between the two countries
lies here.

310
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,520
In this border trade
governance memorandum

311
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,120
written by Yue Qin.

312
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,710
If this initiative succeeds,

313
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,280
it will benefit generations to come.

314
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,520
Your Majesty is worried
about His Highness,

315
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,760
Her Highness,

316
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,310
and the country,

317
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,070
but not yourself.

318
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,790
I'm old now.

319
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,790
I worry there isn't enough time.

320
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,590
Your Majesty, you are in your prime.

321
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,390
May you live forever
and enjoy boundless blessings.

322
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,480
Enough.

323
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,350
No emperor can live forever.

324
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,000
I do wish for a legacy

325
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,920
that lasts for millennia.

326
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,630
Pass my order.

327
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,150
Cancel tomorrow's court session.

328
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,040
I will discuss political matters

329
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,390
with the Prince Heir of Xiyan.

330
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,110
[Zhaojing]
Come and take a look.

331
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,110
We have spun threads in various colors.

332
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,310
Come and take a look.

333
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,200
So this is Xiyan's Hequ Horse?

334
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,240
So gorgeous.

335
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,590
This is a select Hequ Horse from Xiyan,

336
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:54,000
intended as a wedding gift
for the Crown Prince of Great Yan.

337
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,350
Here are the documents
for your verification.

338
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,720
Please let it pass.

339
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,240
The horse is startled.

340
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,550
Control the horse!

341
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,630
Make way!

342
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,070
Those over there,

343
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:09,870
guard the city gate!

344
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,870
Disperse!

345
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,100
[General's Mansion]

346
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,070
Please come in.

347
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,390
Please come in.

348
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:22,830
Please.

349
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,630
Please come in.

350
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,060
[General's Mansion]

351
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,310
Mr. Wang is here.

352
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,680
Welcome him.

353
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:32,590
Well,

354
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,150
His Highness has truly spared
no expense this time.

355
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,960
Work hard.

356
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,630
Each of you

357
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,440
will get a set.

358
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,830
Thank you.

359
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,920
The Crown Prince is here.

360
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,630
Greetings, Your Highness.

361
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,520
Today is the day of my betrothal.

362
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,520
There is no need for formalities.

363
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,790
Congratulations, Your Highness.

364
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,070
The high-quality fish-scale armor
can be used

365
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,150
to reward military commanders
of Duwei rank and above.

366
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:20,760
Thank you, Your Highness.

367
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,350
On your big day,

368
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,000
you still worry
about such trivial matters.

369
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,440
Your Highness,

370
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,830
Luomei's concern for military affairs

371
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,280
is vital for Great Yan's protection,

372
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,440
just as my concern for General Yin

373
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,680
is important for the Crown Prince.

374
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,240
You spoil her too much.

375
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,590
Your Highness,

376
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,920
if our general becomes Crown Princess,

377
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,550
will she ignore us?

378
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,440
Right.

379
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,830
Will she ignore us?

380
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,440
How dare you

381
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,920
be impolite to His Highness?

382
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,590
She won't.

383
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:50,920
How could she?

384
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,240
When Luomei dons her armor,

385
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,200
she leads the Pingnan Army
of 30,000 as a general.

386
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,200
When she removes her armor,

387
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,390
she leads me alone
as the Crown Princess.

388
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,760
Bravo!

389
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,680
Bravo!

390
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,240
I heard Your Highness ordered
the Armor Workshop

391
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,720
to make a Red Forge Armor
for the general.

392
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,150
May I have the chance

393
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,040
to see it?

394
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:33,590
Yeah.

395
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,630
Let us broaden our horizons.

396
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,240
Right.

397
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,110
Lu Neng,

398
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,520
that's a betrothal gift.

399
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,000
It's up to the general.

400
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,150
Luomei,

401
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,630
tell us your attitude.

402
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,760
The Red Forge Armor.

403
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,590
How dare you?

404
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,870
Who is using my armor?

405
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,390
General Yin,

406
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,150
long time no see.

407
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,590
I've heard

408
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,790
there is an imposter

409
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,520
pretending to be me in Zhaojing.

410
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,280
The Crown Prince and I
share a deep bond as brothers.

411
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,790
He won't mistake anyone else for me.

412
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,240
Xuanlie,

413
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,390
I'm back.

414
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:42,920
Jinghe?

415
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,590
What happened on earth?

416
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,870
My father planned
to separate me from Mei.

417
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,000
I wanted to leave with Mei

418
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,070
to live a reclusive life,

419
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,520
but

420
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,960
without my father's protection,

421
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,110
malicious people always
threatened us with swords.

422
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,110
I couldn't bear that hardship,

423
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,150
so I came back.

424
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,150
Our father has issued a decree
granting the marriage.

425
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,440
You touched the betrothal gifts

426
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,350
without my agreement.

427
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,760
How dare you!

428
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,240
I haven't worn armor in years,

429
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,520
and I wanted to try it on when I saw it.

430
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,550
Forgive me, General Yin.

431
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,000
Mei.

432
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,680
I will go to Yanming Palace
to plead my case to my father.

433
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,040
I won't

434
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,680
disturb you two anymore.

435
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,480
Jinghe.

436
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,830
General.

437
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,790
Murong Jinghe.

438
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,590
General.

439
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,920
Your Highness.

440
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:19,260
[Prince Jing's Mansion]

441
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,000
It's my fault to disturb
you and the Crown Prince

442
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,520
on the day of your betrothal.

443
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,630
I believe you and Miss Mei
are truly in love,

444
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,070
but I don't believe you have eloped.

445
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,070
Why did you disappear?

446
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,480
Was it because of the Crown Prince?

447
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,000
Don't you

448
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,480
know it all along?

449
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,550
Your Highness,

450
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,350
I think you have misunderstood.

451
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,480
Prince Jing had an accident
during the Lushan Hunt

452
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,630
due to my failure
to provide proper protection.

453
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,720
Sending Prince Jing back
to his mansion today

454
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,680
was out of concern for a comrade.

455
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,040
In truth, I've chosen you in my heart

456
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,830
long ago.

easily crushed♪

458

♪Destiny wrongly arranges

465
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,680
From now on,

466
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,310
stay by my side.

467
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,040
Don't abandon me again.

468
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,040
Today,

469
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,390
it was my fault.

470
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,740
[Prince Jing's Mansion]

471
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,310
My Lord.

472
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,310
You are back!

473
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,350
It's him.

474
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,390
You are back!

475
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,310
My Lord.

476
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:39,870
My Lord.

477
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,550
My Lord.

478
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,110
You are back.

479
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,830
Gods bless you.

00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,280
You are really back.

481
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,350
Miss Mei Lin is back, too.

482
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,720
From now on, everyone in my mansion

483
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,520
should regard Mei Lin as they regard me.

484
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,830
Yes.

485
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,150
Remove all the white banners
immediately.

486
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,110
They are ominous.

487
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,790
Yes.

488
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,590
Lianxiu,

489
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,790
take good care of Mei Lin.

490
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,040
Go over there.

491
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,200
Please come with me

492
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,440
to see your accommodations
in the mansion.

493
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,440
Go ahead.

494
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,040
My Lord, the Emperor
canceled today's court session

495
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,960
to discuss border trade
with the Prince Heir of Xiyan.

496
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,280
No rush.

497
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,920
Let's meet Li Qing first.

498
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,000
You deserve to be General Weibei.

499
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,680
You actually stood up again.

500
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,200
A servant kneeling for long

501
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,280
will certainly find it strange
to stand upright.

502
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,920
Servant?

503
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,870
Murong Jinghe,

504
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,240
you want to kill me,

505
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,310
but you can't.

506
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,390
I could make Murong Xuanlie
the Crown Prince.

507
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,920
I can also drag him down to hell.

508
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,390
Aren't you imperial nobles

509
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,390
manipulated by a servant?

510
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,870
You plotted the Qingzhou fire

511
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,870
for the Crown Prince?

512
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,150
Yes.

513
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,680
The whole plan was perfect, wasn't it?

514
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,720
First, I convinced
the Xiyan garrison commander

515
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,280
to plant spies among the civilians

516
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,240
during the evacuation, causing chaos.

517
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,830
Then, I spread the rumor
that General Weibei ordered

518
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,280
to keep the land but not its people
to root out traitors.

519
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,720
Afterwards,

520
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,520
I provoked Zhang Yin's Momai Warriors
to set fires

521
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,920
and pledged allegiance
to Murong Xuanlie.

522
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,520
Why?

523
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,240
Murong Xuanlie wanted to destroy you

524
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,960
and the Weibei Army,

525
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,070
and I only want

526
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,870
to destroy your royal Murong family.

527
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,200
Fight it out.

528
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:16,150
Hopefully, it leads to the Murong family
losing their throne.

529
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,440
You are from the Yuwen family
of the previous dynasty?

530
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,520
Well?

531
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,760
Didn't expect the servant in your eyes

532
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,000
was from a former royal family, huh?

533
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:27,720
The people of Qingzhou
were once your subjects.

534
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,910
Do you feel no remorse

535
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,320
for killing tens of thousands
with underhanded tactics?

536
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,110
Commoners barely surviving

537
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,080
find life harder than death.

538
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,040
Wasn't it a mercy

539
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,870
to bring them to heaven sooner?

540
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,190
No wonder your Yuwen family

541
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,480
couldn't hold onto power.

542
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,110
Don't go.

543
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,430
Don't you want to take revenge?

544
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,350
Don't you want to clear
the Weibei Army's name?

545
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,320
Write down your crimes clearly.

546
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,240
My Lord,

547
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,240
this is Li Qing's confession.

548
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,430
I didn't expect him
to confess so quickly.

549
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,720
The Qingzhou fire was caused
by the succession struggle.

550
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,830
He believes revealing the truth

551
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,720
would use public opinion

552
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,320
to undermine our Great Yan's foundation.

553
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,240
So you mean...

554
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,720
Since it was a man-made disaster,
he must confess.

555
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,910
Tomorrow in the court,

556
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,830
I will make Li Qing's confession public.

557
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,080
Afterward, have him executed
by the fish-scale flaying method,

558
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,670
ensuring he suffers in life and death.

559
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:38,520
Yes.

560
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,190
You are still thinking
about Prince Jing and the Crown Prince?

561
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,080
Their struggle for succession

562
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,350
has become intensely hostile.

563
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,240
The imperial edict for the arranged
marriage has been issued.

564
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,190
Even if you intend to remain neutral,

565
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,800
officials see the General's Mansion

566
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,830
as siding with the Eastern Palace.

567
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,040
Regardless of who wins or loses,

568
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,320
I hope they spare each other's lives

569
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,800
out of consideration

570
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,520
for their childhood bond.

571
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,020
[Shuanglin Courtyard]

572
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,190
Ever since the Beauties were bestowed
during the marriage alliance,

573
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,830
Prince Jing personally supervised

574
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,240
the preparation of Shuanglin Courtyard.

575
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,590
He has clearly chosen you.

576
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,480
Shuanglin Courtyard
was originally prepared for you.

577
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,110
The red robes in his painting

578
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,110
were embroidered by the late Empress
as wedding attire

579
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,080
for him and Princess Jing.

580
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,520
Stand properly.

581
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,630
Don't move, Your Highness.

582
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,630
A wedding robe that's too short
is considered inauspicious.

583
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,560
If you dare move again,

584
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,320
I'll take away your Zhanyun Sword.

585
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,390
Mother, a true man should aspire
for the battlefield,

586
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,080
not be held back by love and affection.

587
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,350
No rush to find me a princess.

588
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,080
You've been granted a title
and established a mansion.

589
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:24,390
Naturally, there should
be a princess in it.

590
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,670
This wedding robe is strikingly red
and garish.

591
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,320
I don't see anything special about it.

592
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,560
The robe is nothing special,

593
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,080
but the person will be.

594
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,390
Once you marry the woman you truly love,

595
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,630
you'll see what it means
to be utterly captivated.

596
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,800
I definitely won't.

597
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,150
The way of a general begins
with governing the heart.

598
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,390
A peaceful mind leads to success.

599
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,320
I will never allow anyone

600
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,350
to disrupt my state of mind.

601
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,110
Tomorrow, when I attend court,

602
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,390
I will bring Li Qing to meet my father.

603
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,560
Everything

604
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,350
will be over then.

This is...

Some soil from Laowozi Village.

619

Only with this soil

I feel this year

634
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,390
is much hotter than before.

635
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,760
My Lord,

636
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,800
the wandering healer is here.

637
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,720
The wandering healer

638
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,630
was a former field medic
for the Weibei Army.

639
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,520
Given your injuries from this trip,

640
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,720
it would be reassuring

641
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,910
to have him examine you.

642
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,080
How is she?

643
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,350
The lady is easily fatigued
and shows signs

644
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,560
of night sweats from a fever,

645
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,310
indicating the early onset
of Momai poison.

646
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,190
Fortunately,

647
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,750
we have found a source

648
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:14,880
for the essential
and irreplaceable ingredient

649
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,920
in the prescription:

650
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,270
Snow Dragon Whisker.

651
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,080
Where is it?

652
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,960
Two years ago, someone traded

653
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:22,040
a Snow Dragon Whisker seed
on the black market.

654
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,920
I've learned this person is in Zhaojing.

655
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,790
Seed?

656
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,560
Snow Dragon Whisker grows
in extremely cold highlands.

657
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,750
In the Central Plains,

658
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,560
it can only be preserved as seeds.

659
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,590
With an ice cellar,

660
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,630
it can bloom

661
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:37,750
within a month,

662
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,360
which should be timely
for detoxifying the lady.

663
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,920
Obtain it

664
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:42,880
at all costs.

665
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:43,710
Yes.

666
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,150
Border trade integration
is a plan for the centuries.

667
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,710
In my view,

668
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,880
the top priority

669
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,750
is to solidify
the truce and marital alliance

670
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,440
between Great Yan and Xiyan.

671
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,790
Once the larger situation stabilizes,

672
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,960
commerce will naturally flow.

673
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,790
I have no princesses

674
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,110
to marry the King of Xiyan.

675
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,750
But the Prince Heir of Xiyan can marry
a woman from Great Yan

676
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,110
as the Princess Heir.

677
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,590
Can your father agree?

678
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,150
Xiyan worships gods.

679
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,520
The High Priest has revealed

680
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,790
that the Princess Heir

681
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,920
is the reincarnation
of the celestial deity Moon Kunlun,

682
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,560
reborn in Great Yan.

683
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,790
Your Majesty should know

684
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,480
how I became the Prince Heir.

685
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,920
My father believes in gods.

686
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,110
He had to agree.

687
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,000
So this is the purpose
behind your manipulation

688
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,360
of the deity's reincarnation.

689
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,150
You are also from Xiyan.

690
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,960
Yet you don't believe in gods.

691
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,230
I believe more

692
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,080
in the power of men.

693
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,080
Good.

694
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,360
If you find your Princess Heir,

695
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,880
I will ensure she is sent off
with the honor befitting a princess.

696
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,560
Wishing you

697
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,080
a harmonious

698
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,920
and long-lasting union.

699
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,310
Thank you, Your Majesty.

700
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,840
You are in your prime

701
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,080
with strategic insight.

702
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,270
Your Majesty,

703
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,080
do you need to summon
the imperial physician?

704
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,400
No need.

705
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,080
Recent events

706
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,880
have been troubling,

707
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,110
and I've been somewhat unsettled.

708
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,190
It's truly regrettable

709
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,960
that Prince Jing passed away so young.

710
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,150
May Your Majesty find solace.

711
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,440
Your Majesty.

712
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,360
Your Majesty.

713
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,110
Your Majesty.

714
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:27,840
Your Majesty.

715
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,590
So flustered.

716
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,710
Without demeanor.

717
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,560
Please take care.

718
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:37,630
I will

719
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,040
take my leave.

720
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,590
Your Majesty,

721
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:51,080
Prince Jing is back!

722
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,750
What?

723
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,710
Prince Jing is still alive.

724
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,230
Alive?

725
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,790
He's still alive.

726
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,920
Your Majesty.

727
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,230
Prince Jing is still alive.

728
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,400
My Lord,

729
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,040
His Majesty knows you have returned

730
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,270
and has summoned you
to the palace immediately.

731
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,190
Concubine Yan wants Miss Mei Lin
to accompany you.

732
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,560
She also said

733
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,750
if you confine her,

734
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,920
she would visit you in person.

735
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,110
Got it.

736
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,220
[Fanghua Palace]

737
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,880
Why hasn't Mei Lin returned yet?

738
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,040
Is Prince Jing confining her?

739
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,710
Chagu,

740
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,520
shall I request permission
to leave the palace

741
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,840
and fetch Mei Lin personally?

742
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,960
Don't worry, Your Highness.

743
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,560
Mei Lin was assigned to Fanghua Palace

744
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,880
by the Emperor's decree.

745
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,520
Prince Jing wouldn't dare
defy the Emperor's orders.

746
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,270
It's dark now.

747
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,310
The Noble Consort won't allow us
to leave the palace.

748
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,230
What should we do?

749
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:51,400
Your Highness.

750
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:54,840
Mei Lin,

751
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,880
it's great you're back.

752
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,920
I apologize

753
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,670
for making you worry
about me for so long.

754
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,670
It's okay.

755
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,080
I'm just glad you're back.

756
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,590
Look at you.

757
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,080
You've lost weight.

758
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,560
You need to take care
of yourself. Understand?

759
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,400
Oh, right.

760
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,880
My brother has brought me
a lot of bamboo brew.

761
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,880
You can drink as much as you can.

762
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

763
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,000
Sit down.

764
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,400
Mei Lin,

765
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,150
people in the palace say
you eloped with Prince Jing.

766
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,310
But my brother said

767
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,480
this concern both
Prince Jing and the Crown Prince.

768
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,480
What exactly happened?

769
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:31,960
Your Highness,

770
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,920
it's been so long

771
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,040
and there are many things
I should have been honest about.

772
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,480
However...

773
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,560
It's okay.

774
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,750
Just tell me when you want to.

775
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,590
Anyway,

776
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,520
you belong to Fanghua Palace.

777
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,230
No matter what happens,

778
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:49,000
my brother and I will protect you.

779
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,520
There is something I need to tell you.

780
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,840
Prince Jing and I are engaged.

781
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,880
Well, you...

782
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,590
You and Prince Jing...

783
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,230
You...

784
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:03,840
Well, you...

785
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,440
Sit down, please.

786
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,710
Listen to me.

787
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,710
In the past,

788
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,150
I only saw him as my companion.

789
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,710
It's only during this time

790
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,960
that I've truly understood
his character,

791
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,880
and I've come to understand
my own feelings.

792
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,360
Well,

793
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,270
my mother said true feelings
need to be tested by time.

794
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,590
Mei Lin,

795
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,960
Prince Jing is very good at pretending.

796
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,790
You haven't spent much time with him,

797
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,920
so how do you know
if you truly like him?

798
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,230
I know.

799
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,920
If you like him,

800
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,040
you want to understand his past,

801
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,400
empathize with his experiences,

802
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,480
and wish to be with him in the future.

803
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,920
Wish to be with him in the future?

804
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,040
Jinghe,

805
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,230
I know you are dissatisfied with me,

806
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,040
but when we meet our father,

807
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,400
please consider his health.

808
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,520
Isn't it too late for you

809
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,840
to consider his health now?

810
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,440
Your Majesty,

811
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,230
the two princes are both here.

812
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,400
Tell them to leave.

813
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,150
Kneel down!

814
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,480
Father.

815
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,750
Kneel down!

816
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,560
You rascals!

817
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,190
If you want to fight,

818
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,400
wait until I'm dead!

819
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,080
Father.

820
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:01,000
Father.

821
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,310
Kneel properly.

822
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,040
Don't say you are wronged.

823
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,360
I am fully aware of all your thoughts.

824
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:22,630
You.

825
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,360
Those who plot against the monarch

826
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,040
first plot against the realm.

827
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,920
Those who seek quick gains
and harm the people

828
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,040
are unfit to rule.

829
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:31,960
You.

830
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:33,710
Those who conspire against the monarch

831
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,040
must set aside personal grudges.

832
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:36,400
Those who misuse public power
for personal gain

833
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,920
and harm their kin

834
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,310
are unfit to govern.

835
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:41,790
Father,

836
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,560
I admit my mistake.

837
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:49,960
Father,

838
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,110
I made no mistake.

839
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,880
If I wanted to compete

840
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,270
for the position of Crown Prince,

841
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,360
I wouldn't have waited until now.

842
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:59,440
Jinghe,

843
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:00,920
our father is unwell.

844
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,520
Could we please

845
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:02,750
postpone our discussion?

846
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,710
Let him say it.

847
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,000
The chaos in Qingzhou back then

848
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,790
was actually a man-made disaster.

849
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:11,670
Our father said

850
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,920
the matter of Qingzhou
shall never be spoken of again.

851
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,230
You've just returned to the capital

852
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,790
and disregard our father's health,

853
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:18,080
and now you wish
to defy the imperial decree!

854
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,920
The true culprit of the Qingzhou chaos

855
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:22,230
is none other than the Crown Prince,

856
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,080
Murong Xuanlie.

857
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,190
