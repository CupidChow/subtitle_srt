How can I accept your gold?

Without Your Excellency,

197

Changle House wouldn't be
what it is today.

Booking the scented sachets for a month

199
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,150
is not a big deal for Changle House.

200
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,080
It's a private matter,

201
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,550
so I can't

202
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,150
let you pay for it.

is very skilled.

just ordered scented sachets
enough for a month.

And try this one.

This one is also pretty.

has shed her identity
as the Princess Heir.

238

I entrusted her to the wrong person.

If she weren't so smart,

240
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,390
she would be trapped

people have been coming
to Qingzhou for business.

so

338
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,160
I used local gooseberries

I didn't expect to run into you.

00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:17,270
I found tung oil
in the firecrackers here,

00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,000
likely from the same Xiyan spies

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,310
there are Xiyan spies
among the recruits,

00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,270
The pro-war faction of Xiyan,
led by Mingju,

508

the bleeding won't cease.

550
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,510
A special hemostatic was used.

551
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,360
With rest, recovery is expected.

But...

Yi said Mei Lin fled to her death

564
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,440
because she was imprisoned
by the Prince Heir.

565
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,510
Could the Prince Heir have sealed them

566
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,760
to keep her captive?

573
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,670
is due to me.

574
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,840
You are already trying to make amends.

575
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,920
You risked your life to get the Snow
Dragon Whisker from the Crown Prince.

576
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,880
The poison in her is purged.

577
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,030
Don't blame yourself too much.

578
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,110
This is what I owe her.

579
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,510
From now on,

580
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,840
protect her in secret.

581
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,880
I want her safe

582
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,150
for the rest of her life.

583
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,880
Keep moving forward,

584
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,400
and you will find a way to survive.

585
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,070
The road

586
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,400
will be brighter as you go.

587
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:50,670
Your Highness,

588
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,320
I'm back.

589
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:54,590
Mei Lin.

590
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,030
Gods bless you.

591
00:36:59,480 --> 00:36:59,920
Your Highness.

592
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,840
Your Highness, you are finally awake.

593
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:03,920
Your Highness.

594
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,400
Your Highness.

595
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,280
Your Highness.

596
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,030
You must rest more, Your Highness.

597
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,000
Step aside!

598
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,000
Your Highness.

599
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,070
Your Highness.

600
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:23,960
Your Highness.

601
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,360
Your Highness,

602
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,440
the Princess Heir has passed,

603
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,230
but you still have the princess.

604
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,190
Please think of the princess.

605
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,710
If something happens to you,

606
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,030
what will she do in Great Yan?

607
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,320
I beg you, Your Highness.

608
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:44,440
Oh, right.

609
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:45,550
Right.

610
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,630
The princess has sent you a letter.

611
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:47,920
It's a secret letter from Great Yan.

612
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:48,670
Here, Your Highness.

613
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,110
Your Highness.

614
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,630
Concubine Yan has passed,

615
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,710
and I share

616
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:12,800
your

617
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,400
sorrow.

618
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,710
For the sake of peace
between our countries,

619
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,000
please suppress your grief

620
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,960
and seek a resolution to the conflict.

621
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,550
Will we...?

622
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,920
Will we meet again in this lifetime?

623
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,360
Qin,

624
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,840
congratulations.

625
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,920
You'll soon be an uncle.

626
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,440
The little prince wants a wooden horse,

627
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,280
larger than the one you gave me
when we were young.

628
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,960
It's not me.

629
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,550
The little prince asks this.

630
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,550
He is here.

631
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:22,920
Your Highness,

632
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,800
the princess urged you

633
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,360
to make the wooden horse again.
