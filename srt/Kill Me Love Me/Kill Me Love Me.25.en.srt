have you been?

Greetings, Your Excellency.

00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,310
How have you been?

40
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,590
I'm fine.

41
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,120
I didn't expect Your Highness
to be the governor.

42
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,510
It really is a small world.

43

Your Highness and I

44
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,680
both have deep ties with Qingzhou.

45
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,310
And the Princess Heir

46
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,720
is from Qingzhou.

50
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,310
are all old acquaintances,

51
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,160
this matter should be easier.

52
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,950
As long as Your Highnesses
work together,

53
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,390
Qingzhou is sure to become the most
prosperous place on the border.

54
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,000
The border trade in Qingzhou will shape

55
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,480
the success or failure of trade relations
between our two nations.

56
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,120
Great Yan has set up
a Border Trade Supervision Office,

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,480
and Mr. Li Jie is its first supervisor.

58

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,120
demonstrates Xiyan's sincere commitment.

When discussing the specifics,

66
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,360

for both nations.

69

Your Excellency,

70
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,600
here are several key issues

71
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,950
listed by Xiyan
for this border trade negotiation.

72
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,390
Please review them.

73
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,950
Xiyan places great importance
on border trade

74
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,680
and hopes to establish shops in Qingzhou

75
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,750
for the indigenous people of Xiyan.

76
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,120
Along with me on this visit to Qingzhou

77
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,190
is a group of merchants.

78
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,360
Among them

79
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,360
is the owner

80
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,000
of the highly prestigious
Yanlai Fragrance Shop in Xiyan,

81
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,630
which also hopes
to open a branch in Qingzhou.

82
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,190
Your Excellency, we hope

83
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,750
that favorable policies can be enacted

84
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,120
within the Qingzhou Chamber of Commerce.

85
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,310
If the road is not passable,

86
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,600
profit will not flow.

87
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,390
"If Xiyan and Great Yan

88
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,040
can build an official road,

89
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,830
it will benefit generations to come."

90
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,270
Your Highness, this proposal

91
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,630
aligns perfectly with my vision.

92
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,390
I believe the border trade with Xiyan
will surely proceed smoothly.

93
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,160
Your Highness, I have long heard
that you are a master of Weiqi.

94
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,360
Many of the elders in the city
share your passion

95
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,310
and have long admired Your Highness.

96
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,750
I humbly invite Your Highness

97
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,240
to engage in a match
with a top Weiqi player.

98
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,360
It'll add a fine story to the Weiqi world
of both Great Yan and Xiyan.

99
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,830
You flatter me.

100
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,480
I merely play occasionally
in my free time.

101
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,270
But since I have earned
the favor of the Weiqi masters,

102
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,750
it would be rude of me to refuse.

103
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:26,630
Your Highness,

104
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,190
please.

105
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,310
Your Highness,

106
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,240
the room is too stuffy.

107
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,870
I'll go out to get some fresh air.

108
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,390
No matter how I tried to mend it,

109
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,920
I couldn't erase

110
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,430
the crack on this stone hairpin.

111
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,870
A broken stone hairpin
will always bear a crack,

112
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,070
no matter how you fix it.

113
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,800
Your Excellency,

114
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,240
you don't have to waste
any more effort on it.

115
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,830
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,390
I didn't take good care of it.

117
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,070
Perhaps it wasn't that sturdy
to begin with

118
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,950
and was bound to break sooner or later.

119
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,920
What happened in the past

120
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,800
was Prince Jing's debt

121
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,950
to the peace-making beauty, Mei Lin.

122
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,360
Now,

123
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,240
I'm the Princess Heir of Xiyan.

124
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,670
Your Excellency, you owe me nothing.

125
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,910
Father,

126
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,600
Mother,

127
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,630
it's time for me to move on.

128
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,510
Moving forward will always lead
to diverging paths.

129
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,080
Your Excellency,

130
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,480
why burden yourself and others?

131
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,320
You worry too much, Your Highness.

132
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,320
I know how to walk

133
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,550
the road ahead.

134
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,790
I'm glad.

135
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,790
I just wanted

136
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,000
to offer a kind reminder.

137
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,360
And I, in turn,
must remind you, Your Highness,

138
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,120
not to forget the vow you made,

139
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,630
to never force her into anything.

140
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,790
When it comes to keeping one's word,

141
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,720
you don't seem to have the right
to remind me.

142
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,790
The Snow Dragon Whisker
will bloom in a month.

143
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,320
By then,

144
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,630
the poison you planted in her

145
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,720
will be neutralized.

146
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,390
After the detoxification,

147
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,360
Mei Lin can choose

148
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,630
where to go.

149
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,030
But how do you know

150
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,480
she won't choose to stay in Xiyan

151
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,360
and remain as my Princess Heir?

152
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,030
It's late.

153
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,480
Your Excellency,

154
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,120
you should return
to the mansion and rest.

155
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,750
Come on. Put this on.

156
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,320
Mei Lin,

157
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,720
the night road is full of risks.

158
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,720
Don't look back.

159
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,960
Focus on the path ahead

160
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,510
and keep moving forward.

161
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,440
Some memories are etched into the bones.

162
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,440
They are hard to forget.

163
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,870
I look back

164
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,750
to see the road I've walked clearly

165
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,840
and to make sure I don't take
the wrong steps again.

166
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,480
Didn't you say

167
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,600
the road would get brighter
the further we went?

168
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,390
The border trade is about to begin.

169
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,480
Everything will go as planned.

170
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:55,870
By the way,

171
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,240
Jia's fragrance shop is about to open.

172
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,030
She invited us to pick
sachets in the woods tomorrow.

173
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,550
Pick sachets in the woods?

174
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,390
Fragrance shops are everywhere in Xiyan.

175
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,320
This is a common way
to attract customers.

176
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,390
But Jia is really clever.

177
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,870
By being her first customers,

178
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,150
we'll probably end up
giving her business advice,

179
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,550
and in return, we'll only get

180
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,320
some free scented sachets.

181
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,080
The first customers?

182
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,200
Well, I have a good sense of smell.

183
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,720
Jia might not get the better deal here.

184
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,030
Mei Lin,

185
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,960
she seems to have invited
the governor too.

186
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,120
No one knows Qingzhou
better than he does now.

we'll need to hang up
the shop sign later.

223
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,080
The shop sign is heavy. Let me do it.

224
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,440
I'm the shopkeeper.

225
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,840
I need to hang the sign myself.

If I can't even handle the sign,

227
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,360
how can I run this shop?

228
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:53,150
Alright.

229
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,240
I'm off to see the governor
in the woods then.

230
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,270
I don't understand it.

231
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,270
Why do you have to see the governor?

232
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,000
When I first came to Qingzhou,

233
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,360
the shop wasn't doing well,

234
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,750
and I could barely make any money.

235
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,480
The food was bad,

236
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,870
and I was so hungry I lost weight.

237
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,670
But after the governor came,

238
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,320
things in Qingzhou
got better day by day,

239
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,670
and we started earning more money.

240
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,080
I want to thank the governor

241
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,670
for helping me get enough to eat.

242
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,120
The person you should thank
the most is me.

243
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,960
It's me who pays your salary.

244
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,550
No.

245
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,000
The person I should be most thankful to
is still the governor.

246
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,270
Had it not been for what he's done,

247
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,080
there wouldn't have been
Yanlai Fragrance Shop,

248
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,960

00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,000
that if I follow
the scent I truly desire

252
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,270
and stay loyal to it,

253
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,960

this sachet first.

I have no reason to take it from you.

256
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,920
This is also the scent
you picked at the very beginning.

and Princess Heir of Xiyan?

He's a resident laborer
in my fragrance shop.

275
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,880
He's a little slow in the head.

276

277
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,880

a destined romance.

of matching sachets.

Together, they are called

The two sachets look alike,

289
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,000
but their scents differ slightly,

290
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,270
perfectly complementing each other.

291
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,070
They symbolize unity

292

293
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,270

dancing alone in the air.

369
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,440
Come and take a look.

370
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,960
- Your Highness, this is a great idea.

371
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,240

372
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,160
- solve its pest control issues...
- Everyone can get one.

373
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,220
- Please come and get one.
- And get them to accept us more quickly.

374
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,310
Come and take a look!

375
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,400
It's for free.

376
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,750
Come and take a look!

377
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,240
- Insect-repellent sachets from Yanlai.
- Free insect-repellent sachets.

378
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,510
- The sachets are poisonous!
- It's for free.

379
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,200
The sachets are poisonous!

380
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,790
Don't keep them.

381
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,200
- The sachets are poisonous.
- How could they be?

382
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,000
Zhuang smelled
your scented sachets yesterday,

383
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,830
and today, he is like this.

384
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,750
Impossible.

385
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,790
Don't look!

386
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,110
What am I supposed to do about Zhuang?

387
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,750
The sachets must be poisonous.

388
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,510
Madam,

389
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,310
the child seems to have contracted
toxic moth fever.

390
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,400
Madam,

391
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,400
the symptoms appear
three or four days after the bite.

392
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,720
You used the sachet too late.

393
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,960
You're still trying
to justify yourselves.

394
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,240
You're not selling scented sachets.

395
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,110
You're selling poison!

396
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,350
Scented sachets can repel insects,

397
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,720
but they can't cure illnesses.

398
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,440
Your grandson needs to be sent
to a clinic right now.

399
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,680
We can go with you.

400
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,070
Don't believe these Xiyan people!

401
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,790
Who knows if they are helping us
or harming us?

402
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,590
- Yeah.
- With them around,

403
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,200
- your grandson's condition might worsen.
- Right.

404
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:08,750
Exactly!

405
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,920
Send him to the clinic first.

406
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,240
Don't, Madam.

407
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
Don't listen to her nonsense.

408
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:12,880
Yesterday,

409
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,590
I saw the mass murderer governor

410
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,000
entering this shop.

411
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,590
These scented sachets

412
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,160
- are probably used to poison us!
- That's right!

413
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,070
- I saw it too.
- Right!

414
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,440
These Xiyan people

415
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,960
are trying to harm
us Qingzhou residents!

416
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:21,960
- That's right.
- Yeah.

417
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,590
- What should we do?
- Right.

418
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,160
They are

419
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,240
so evil!

420
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,200
They won't even spare little children!

421
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,550
What's your relationship
with the mass murderer?

422
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,110
Are you in cahoots with him?

423
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,160
Are you trying to harm us?

424
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,680
The mass murderer is going
to massacre the city again!

425
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,640
- I'll fight you!
- Fight you!

426
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:35,550
What are you doing?

427
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,270
What are you doing?

428
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,400
My poor Zhuang...

429
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,160
Come on.

430
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,000
Calm down.

431
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:41,920
Stop pushing.

432
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,160
Mr. Li said

433
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,480
you were not welcome in Qinglin Lane.

434
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,110
Hurry and leave!

435
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,310
- Go!
- Hurry and go!

436
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,350
Don't pretend to be merciful.

437
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,030
Leave!

438
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,070
- Go!
- Leave our Qinglin Lane.

439
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,030
Mr. Li is the old man

440
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,030
who threw stones at you.

441
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,750
He has considerable prestige
in Qinglin Lane,

442
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,960
and all the neighbors listen to him.

443
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,030
Mass murderer, go!

444
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,960
Hurry and go!

445
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,510
Hurry and go!

446
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,350
Leave here. Go!

447
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,400
Please quiet down.

448
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,270
I'm also from Qingzhou.

449
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,880
Madam,

450
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,070
I'm the daughter of Mr. Mei,
a mason in Qinglin Lane.

451
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,200
I won't harm my fellow townspeople.

452
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,510
Can Zhuang

453
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,240
really recover?

454
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,160
I promise you

455
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,750
I'll have someone cure Zhuang.

456
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,110
Take them to Fuxin Clinic

457
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,640
and have a physician cure her grandson.

458
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:33,640
Yes.

459
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:34,920
Go ahead.

460
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,110
Don't worry.

461
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,680
Okay.

462
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,110
Don't worry.

463
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,240
The Fuxin Clinic

464
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,830
has an imperial physician
I brought from the palace.

465
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,000
Zhuang will be fine.

466
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,590
- Go. You're not welcome here!
- Leave here!

467
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,000
Get lost!

468
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:07,790
Qingyan.

469
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,960
Dear fellow townspeople...

470
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:12,790
Hurry and go!

471
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,830
The purpose of engraving
the Monument of the Masses

472
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,400
is to pray for the souls
of those who perished in Qingzhou.

473
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,030
I hope everyone

474
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,200
will not misunderstand anymore.

475
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,310
We don't trust you!

476
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:20,880
Right!

477
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,550
We don't trust you!

478
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,590
Go! Whatever you say,
we won't believe it!

479
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,310
- Beat him to death!
- We don't believe you!

480
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:25,720
Your Excellency!

481
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,590
Your Excellency.

482
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,480
The people are surrounding
the Prince Heir and Princess Heir of Xiyan

483
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,640
at the door of Yanlai Fragrance Shop.

484
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,030
Go!

485
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,920
Go! Don't ever come back!

486
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,030
Get lost!

487
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,920
I can understand why the Qingzhou people
don't like the Xiyan people.

488
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
But why do they hate
the governor so much?

489
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,680
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

490
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,350
Go ahead and work.

491
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,830
The grievances of Qingzhou

492
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,590
should not be borne by the governor.

493
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,680
But deep-seated issues

494
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
are not formed in a single day.

495
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,480
The Qingzhou people

496
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,750
have long been holding grudges

497
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,720
against the governor and Xiyan.

498
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,920
It's not easy to change people's hearts.

499
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,350
Your Highness and the governor
both want what's best for Qingzhou.

500
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,480
In time,

501
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,110
the people will come to see that.

502
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,920
I can already see it.

503
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:13,880
So can I.

504
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,240
As long as we keep at it,

505
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,680
people's hearts can be changed.

506
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,480
Mei Lin is right.

507
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,790
As long as we persist,

508
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:26,960
the Qingzhou people

509
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,640
will one day understand
our good intentions.

510
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,480
I believe that too.

511
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,790
I have a way that can

512
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,550
help ease the issue
of insect-borne fevers in Qingzhou

513
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,240
and also change the people's
prejudices against us.

514
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,350
What did you just say?

515
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,550
Concubine Yan is pregnant.

516
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,640
However...

517
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,110
Is there a problem with the pregnancy?

518
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,160
With her condition,

519
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,960
she'll probably suffer
during her pregnancy.

520
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,640
Her well-being

521
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,880
must come first above all else.

522
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,750
But she...

523
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,350
Your Majesty!

524
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,030
Your Majesty.

525
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,510
Your Majesty,

526
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,000
I'm going to be a mother.

527
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,480
Aren't you happy?

528
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,400
Yes, I am.

529
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,440
You are lying.

530
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,640
I'm just worried you'll suffer.

531
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:37,960
Your Majesty,

532
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,070
I am in very good health.

533
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,440
Even if something happens,

534
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,110
the gods will protect me.

535
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,000
Alright. Sit down.

536
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,720
My mother often said

537
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,960
bearing children

538
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,270
was always hard work.

539
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,440
I'm not afraid.

540
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,550
Anyway, he is in my womb,

541
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,350
so I get the final say.

542
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:01,960
Alright.

543
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,640
You get the final say.

544
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,790
Your Majesty,

545
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,880
now I have one more relative
in Great Yan.

546
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,030
I'm really happy.

547
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,460
[Peace and Tranquility Prevail]

548
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:32,480
Your Excellency,

549
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,680
I traveled all over Qingzhou today,

550
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,830
but I only gathered
fewer than ten names.

Yue Qin was besieged by the locals?

00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,640
The Qingzhou people hate Murong Jinghe.

571

Now that Yue Qin is overseeing
the border trade,

572
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,550
in people's minds, he is in cahoots
with the mass murderer.

after we parted at the mine in Qingzhou,

612
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,920
I looked for you for many years,

613
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,880
and I visited this mine countless times.

614

for saving your life.

I thought the mine was fun,

and I often pestered him
to bring me here to play.
