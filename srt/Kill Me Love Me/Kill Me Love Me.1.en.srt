00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,550
Only by scattering paper money
as an offering

187
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,790
can I express my sorrow.

188
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,840
Your Highness,

189
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,840
His Highness
has just lost his old friend

190
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,480
[Liu Zhong]
and is extremely sad.

191
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,910
Please forgive us

192
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,480
if we have been rude in any way.

193
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,960
Who is Qi?

194
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,550
[Qingyan]
Qi was Prince Jing's turtle.

195
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,440
You...

196
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,630
How dare you call us turtles?

197
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,480
I'm merely paying respects
to an old friend.

198
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,630
You're overthinking it.

199
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,300
Well...

200
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,480
It seems my Ba

201
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,960
has quite a connection with you.

202
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,200
What do you want to do?

203
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,630
I will do

204
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,440
whatever you will do in Great Yan.

205
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,630
My lord.

206
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,910
After entering the capital, the Beauties
go through a grand selection

207
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,360
before being assigned

208
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,750
to the mansions of the imperial family
and high-ranking officials.

209
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,960
How many can I have?

210
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,960
Imperial relatives can have four.

211
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,200
Four.

212
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,790
After much deliberation,

213
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,150
this particular Beauty is the only one

214
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,790
who catches my fancy.

215
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,790
Yet if I choose only one,

216
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,550
it would seem like a loss for me.

217
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,670
Well,

218
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,840
as for the remaining three...

219
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,510
Ba will pick for me.

220
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,030
My lord...

221
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,510
Didn't you say

222
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,510
I could pick four?

223
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,240
According to protocol,

224
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,000
a grand ceremony must occur
before selecting the Beauties.

225
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,030
Then what's the use of me

226
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,750
being the wedding envoy?

227
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,550
Enough!

228
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,270
They are peace-making Beauties,
not captives.

229
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,550
You have no right to insult them.

230
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:31,910
Exchanging 100 peace-making Beauties
for 10,000 captives

231
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,790
to return to Xiyan

232
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,390
was a proposal initiated by your side.

233
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,390
I merely went along with it.

234
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,670
How can this be considered an insult?

235
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,790
If you want to blame someone,

236
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,600
blame your father.

237
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,550
Your Highness,

238
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,480
Prince Jing was joking just now.

239
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,150
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

240
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,550
In Great Yan,
etiquette is highly valued.

241
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,440
The peace-making Beauties
will absolutely not be summoned

242
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,000
before the grand ceremony takes place.

243
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,440
The Beauties are not yet accustomed
to the new environment.

244
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,790
Let them enter the capital
to rest and adjust.

245
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,960
That won't do.

246
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,200
I need to wait
until Qi's seventh-day memorial is over.

247
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,360
Prince Jing is joking again.

248
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,480
His Majesty, understanding
your weary travels,

249
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,480
has granted a special decree for you
to rest and recuperate in Jingbei

250
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,670
before proceeding to the capital.

251
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,840
[Jingbei Relay Station]

252
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,320
Riding in the carriage for so long

253
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,120
is really tiring.

254
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,720
Please come in, Miss.

255
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,840
When can we depart for Zhaojing?

256
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,750
[Jingbei Relay Station]
This is so beautiful.

257
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,870
I hope we can arrive in Zhaojing soon.

258
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,510
There is food.

259
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,600
I noticed you haven't eaten anything
in the evening.

260
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,480
So I fetched some Dengguo Cakes

261
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,550
from the kitchen,
just in case you're hungry.

262
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,840
Try them.

263
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,120
Dengguo Cakes?

264
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,400
Mei Lin, come and eat.

265
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,920
It's so sour.

266
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,680
So sour.

267
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,790
Dengguo Cakes made
by Qingzhou people are the tastiest.

268
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,110
I wonder what secret ingredient
they put in.

269
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,440
You can't even taste the sourness
of Dengguo in them.

270
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,160
Mountain licorice.

271
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,000
Is the cake no longer sour
after adding mountain licorice?

272
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,270
There is someone outside the room.

273
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,160
I can't fall asleep.

274
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,310
Your Highness,

275
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,640
this is a leather pendant
my mother made for me.

276
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,070
Placing it under the pillow
can help you sleep peacefully.

277
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,480
It's useless.

278
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,240
Here are all things from Xiyan.

279
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,750
Bamboo tube wine can help with sleep.

280
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,880
Why not take a try?

281
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,000
I can't sleep when I'm too full.

282
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,160
Shall we jump with Your Highness?

283
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,590
You'll fall asleep when you are tired.

284
00:17:59,640 --> 00:17:59,960
Right.

285
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,310
That sounds very unreliable.

286
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,200
Is there any way
to fall asleep right away

287
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,830
without having to exert myself?

288
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,640
Knock Your Highness out.

289
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,550
First, apply pressure
to the shoulders and neck

290
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,310
to numb the meridians.

291
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,030
Then guide the force
to the Fengchi point.

292
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,510
With a precise application of strength
to the wrist, deliver a single strike

293
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,480
that causes immediate unconsciousness
without pain,

294
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,110
ensuring at least 12 hours of sleep.

295
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,240
Mei Lin,

296
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,830
are you serious?

297
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,030
If Her Highness gets hurt,

298
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,030
could you bear the responsibility?

299
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,750
Mei Lin must be joking.

300
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,310
Mei Lin,

301
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,400
if you have the confidence,

302
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,350
I may take a try.

303
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:43,680
Your Highness,

304
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,720
please don't!

305
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,640
This is a method I heard about

306
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,310
from a wandering doctor
when I was little.

307
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,400
I've never tried it before,

308
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,440
but I am confident it will work.

309
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,110
Your Highness said you were afraid.

310
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,790
Why?

311
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,920
If anyone in Great Yan dares
to bully Your Highness,

312
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,830
His Majesty won't let them off the hook.

313
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,550
That lunatic was right.

314
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,920
My father

315
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,750
sold me to Great Yan.

316
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,030
He wants nothing to do with me.

317
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,880
Don't believe the lunatic's words.

318
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,510
Your Highness is smart and cute.

319
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,310
Everyone will like Your Highness.

320
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,200
But there are so many princesses
in the palace.

321
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,510
Ziyu, the Queen's daughter,
is totally the better match.

322
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,960
My father just can't part with her.

323
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,070
He designated me
for the marriage alliance

324
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,880
just because...

325
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,510
Because Your Highness are...

326
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,160
The prettiest.

327
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,000
Right.

328
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,640
I am the prettiest.

329
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,350
Mei Lin, do you feel afraid?

330
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,400
There is nothing to be afraid of
in this world.

331
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,680
Right.

332
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,550
I've come to Great Yan
to see my brother.

333
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,590
I have to be fine

334
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,920
so as not to make my brother worry.

335
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,550
There is nothing to be afraid of.

336
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,000

[Jingbei Mansion]

338
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,680
It's him who set the fire.

339
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,270
You caused their death.

340
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,240
Why did you set the fire?

341
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,920
Minor tricks.

342
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,400
Well, sly foxes never play the fool.

343
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,400
So many people want to kill you.

344
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,880
But I'm the one who'll actually do it.

345
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,680
Let me repeat the rules.

without anyone serving him.

348
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,960
Leave immediately

349
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,880
after delivering the herbs.

350
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,550
Yes.

351
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,270
Why is he soaking
in the medicinal spring again?

352

Having you serve
as my medicine attendant

359
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,110
is unfair to you.

360

I don't just want
to be a medicine attendant.

361

00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,400
You expressed your love boldly.

370
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,400
What do you want on earth?

371
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,270
If you want my life,

372
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,880
I can't afford to give it to you.

373
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,720
I just want you.

374
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,070
Bleeding

375
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,000
should be

376
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,830
on the wedding night in Zhaojing.

377
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,640
What do you think?

378
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,830
I can't wait so long

379
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,680
and I don't want to.

380
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,960
No matter what you want,

381
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,350
such eagerness

382
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,720
will bring you trouble.

383
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,790
Assassin!

384
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:42,960
Catch the assassin!

385
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,310
Catch the assassin!

386
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,510
Assassin!

387
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,200
Protect Prince Jing!

388
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,750
Catch the assassin!

389
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,480
Where is Prince Jing?

390
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,550
Protect Prince Jing!

391
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,200
Hurry!

392
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,880
Go to the medicinal spring.

393
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:11,590
My lord.

394
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,310
My lord, there is an assassin.

395
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:12,790
There is an assassin.

396
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,880
My lord, there is...

397
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:22,750
Go.

398
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,400
Everyone sees me as a lunatic.

399
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,000
A lunatic

400
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,160
can do anything.

401
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,110
I can fulfill your desire here.

402
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,510
Of course, I can also

403
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,000
kill you here.

404
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,920
So,

405
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:22,000
don't irritate a lunatic.

406
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,960
I'm not afraid of death.

407
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,960
I'm just afraid I can't die

408
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,480
with you.

409
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,880
Your eyes

410
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,720
are truly unique.

411
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,640
Have we met before?

412
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,030
Perhaps

413
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,310
we met in our past lives.

414
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,240
You and I

415
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,960
are definitely meant

416
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,550
to be together by destiny.

417
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,400
You also think so?

418
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,510
Very well.

419
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,000
Stay

420
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,750
in my mansion tonight.

421
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,750
Tomorrow,

422
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,830
go back

423
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,640
to Zhaojing with me.

424
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,160
Okay.

425
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,000
He can walk!

426
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,720
You really didn't disappoint me,

427
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,030
little beggar.
