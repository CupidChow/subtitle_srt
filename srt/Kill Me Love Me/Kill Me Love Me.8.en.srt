Once our men start to take action,

92
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,510

Whether this embroidered screen
is considered repaired

113
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,830
lies solely in Prince Jing's discretion.

114
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,120
If he wants
to make things difficult for you,

115
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,870
you may never finish repairing it.

you don't have to worry.

128
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,120
Actually, the grudge
between Prince Jing and me

129
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,360
was settled long ago,

130
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,040
and it was even decreed
in the imperial edict.

131
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,560
Don't worry about me.

132
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:44,920

I won't be able
to leave the palace at will.

145
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,750

146
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,240

180
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,080
I can't hear you.

181
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,360
I won't go back.

182
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,320
Your Highness, the palace gate
is about to be closed.

183
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,240
If you go back late,

184
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,360
the Noble Consort will punish you.

185
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,840
I'll be punished anyway.

186
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,240
I'll go back tomorrow.

187
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,870
If you are grounded
and can't leave the palace,

00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,750
how will you drink with Mei Lin again?

189
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,960
Right.

190
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,390
Your Highness,

191
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,750
let's drink together.

192
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,000
Fine.

193
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,000
Mei Lin, promise me.

194
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,000
Ask my brother whenever you need help.

195
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,960
He'll help you.

196
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,750
I know you two

197
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,150
are good people.

198
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,480
Take it slow.

199
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,320
You mean,

200
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,200
Mei Lin still doesn't know
your feelings for her?

201
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,390
Why didn't you tell her?

202
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,670
You two won't be together
until you confess your feelings to her.

203
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,240
Zigu,

204
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,840
a relationship requires
mutual affection.

205
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,910
Mei Lin isn't in the mood
for a relationship right now.

206
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,910
If I confess my feelings rashly,

207
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,750
it will put her in a difficult position.

208
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,080
Now

209
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,390
is not a good time to confess.

210
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,080
You always have your reasons.

211
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,320
But if you don't tell her now,

212
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,550
you might have no chance
to tell her in the future.

213
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,940
[Passport]

214
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,420
[Passport]

215
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,950
If I can send away Zhang Yin
successfully,

216
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,360
I can use this channel

217
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,310
to help Mr. Yue Qin
to send Miss Mei Lin away.

218
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,710
Sir.

219
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,550
Are you

220
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,040
injured?

221
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,760
It's a minor injury.

222
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,520
It's nothing.

223
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,400
I've already applied the medicine.

224
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,070
What's wrong?

225
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,640
Why do you seem
to have a lot on your mind?

226
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,280
Now, besides Prince Jing,

227
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,280
even General Yin

228
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,400
is watching Mei Lin.

229
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,640
Mei Lin must be trying to take revenge.

230
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,040
But staying in Zhaojing
is fraught with danger.

231
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,310
I just want her to survive.

232
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,710
Sir,

233
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,310
actually, we can use the channels
of black market smugglers

234
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,710
to send Miss Mei Lin away.

235
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,710
This way, not only
you won't be implicated,

236
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,880
but Prince Jing will also
have no way to investigate.

237
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,070
This

238
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,240
is the Travel Permit
from the black market to Xiyan.

239
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,400
Smuggling in the black market?

240
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,430
How did you know

241
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,070
the smugglers in the black market?

242
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,190
Those in the black market

243
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,830
are all about money.

244
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,950
As long as you pay, they'll do the job.

245
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,040
Rest assured, Sir.

246
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,590
Anyway,

247
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,910
I will receive word from that person

248
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,160
after the Shangsi Festival.

249
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:50,180
[Court of State Ceremonial]

250
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,120
What do you need, my lord?

251
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,480
I'm concerned about the Beauty

252
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,160
and the embroidered screen.

253
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm here to supervise the repair work

254
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,670
and speed it up.

255
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:01,880
My lord,

256
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,190
there are no spare rooms here.

257
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,430
I'm afraid you can't stay here.

258
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,000
These are my personal bedding items.

259
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,310
You don't have to prepare them for me.

260
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,480
As for the rooms,

261
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,160
don't worry about that.

262
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,480
The Beauty...

263
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,400
I'll be

264
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,000
wherever the embroidered screen is.

265
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,950
The distribution is around the corner.

266
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,670
Can't you wait just a few days?

267
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,640
I can,

268
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,830
but I don't want to.

269
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,310
Mei Lin damaged
Empress Dejia's embroidered screen.

270
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,710
The magnitude

271
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,710
of this offense

272
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,040
lies

273
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,520
in my discretion.

274
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,000
Since you want to be the good guy,

275
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,830
you might as well help
with the whole thing.

276
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,280
Oh, right.

277
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,520
The Beauty is shy at night.

278
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,760
Outside the embroidery room,

279
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,880
there should only be people
from my mansion.

280
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,430
Thank you.

281
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,550
The Imperial Guard

282
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,120
originally patrolled every hour.

283
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,640
But since you came,
they haven't left their posts.

284
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,160
Did you move
to the Court of State Ceremonial

285
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,400
because you made new progress
in finding the man?

286
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,000
The Meiniang you saw in Wenhua Pavilion

287
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,240
is indeed a man.

288
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,280
By following him,
we can find where Zhang Yin is.

289
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,880
Now, the Court of State Ceremonial
is full of spies.

290
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,280
You must cooperate with me
to divert attention

291
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,240
so that Qingyan

292
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,550
can continue the pursuit.

293
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,400
Understood.

294
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:04,710
My lord,

295
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,590
General Yin came to me today.

296
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,240
I know

297
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,360
someone wants to use you against me.

298
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,710
This is just a common tactic of intrigue

299
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,830
used in the court.

300
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,710
You don't need to know this.

301
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,160
Now you

302
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,640
only have to cooperate with me
to put on a good show.

303
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,070
No women dare to take the initiative

304
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,830
to sleep in my bed.

305
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,910
Don't overthink it.

306
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,670
I won't do anything to you.

307
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,950
I should say that to you.

308
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,240
But you can't defeat me.

309
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,760
Do you think you call the shots
with your superb martial arts skills?

310
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,880
Go to bed,

311
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,710
my lord.

312
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,240
Get up.

313
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,190
I'll take the inside.

314
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:35,950
When I'm sleeping,

315
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,190
I won't show my back to anyone.

316
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:53,910
Leaving the lights on while sleeping

317
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,640
is also one of my rules.

318
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,350
You are lying on my robe.

319
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,520
You can't fall asleep, can you?

320
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,520
With a killer beside me,

321
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,520
I certainly can't fall asleep.

322
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,550
You've said

323
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,590
I'm just an ordinary Beauty now,

324
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,200
whom you can kill at any time.

325
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,200
It's just the wind.

326
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,040
I have a way to make you fall asleep.

327
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:03,720
What is it?

328
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,200
First, apply pressure
to the shoulders and neck

329
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,760
to numb the meridians.

330
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,390
Then guide the force
to the Fengchi point.

331
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:13,960
With a precise application of strength
to the wrist...

332
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,830
So many people want to kill you.

333
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,440
How can you sleep soundly?

334
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:29,720
Just sleep.

335
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,790
I'll guard you.

336
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,480
Minister Zhang, the Travel Permit
is ready.

337
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,150
Meet you at the old place
on the Shangsi Festival.

338
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,830
How dare you

339
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,190
knock me out?

340
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,390
You even took off my outer robe.

341
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,760
Did you sleep well last night?

342
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:31,760
No.

343
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,240
But you snored.

344
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:41,320
Help me put it on.

345
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:05,830
My lord,

346
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:07,280
please have breakfast.

347
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,960
This crispy cake is sour and astringent.

348
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,240
You love this?

349
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,110
How can you eat
such a distasteful thing?

350
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,110
I can't taste anything.

351
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,080
The day after the fire in Qingzhou,

352
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,590
I lost my sense of taste.

353
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,240
Mother,

354
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,630
where are you?

355
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,000
Mother, where are you?

356
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,590
Mother.

357
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,830
On the day
the Weibei Army entered the city,

358
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,830
I urged my mother to make cakes for me.

359
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,520
My mother said she'd make ten cakes

360
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,440
to make up for all the missed birthdays.

361
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,590
That night,

362
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,680
my mother kept making cakes.

363
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,680
From then on,

364
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,070
I couldn't taste anything.

365
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,000
Did you get treated?

366
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,790
That's not necessary.

367
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,040
The taste of food is not important.

368
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,350
Filling the stomach matters the most.

369
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,350
My lord.

370
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,760
Zhang Yin and Shumo arranged
to meet on the Shangsi Festival.

371
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,390
On the Shangsi Festival,

372
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:46,760
you can go out.

373
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,040
Is there any news about Zhang Yin?

374
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,960
Zhang Yin will show up
on Shangsi Festival.

375
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,830
At that time,

376
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,000
we can catch him directly.

377
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:58,960
Shangsi Festival

378
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,350
will be an opportunity for us.

379
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,720
Get a few unfamiliar faces

380
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,040
to keep a close watch on Shumo.

381
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,070
Mei Lin and I will help you draw
attention away from the others.

382
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,680
If Zhang Yin dares to show up,

383
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,830
we will catch him immediately.

384
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,000
Yes.

385
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:11,960
Besides,

386
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,550
get a few men to keep a close watch
on Concubine Yan in the palace.

387
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,720
She is Yue Qin's vulnerability.

388
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,790
Should the plan change,

389
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,720
we can use her to control
both him and his servant.

390
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,240
Okay.

391
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:25,680
Oh, right.

392
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,520
Get a wandering healer

393
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,960
to concoct a remedy
for the loss of taste.

394
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,590
Have you lost your sense of taste?

395
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,070
When you get the remedy,

396
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,200
send it to her.

397
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,070
Well,

398
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,960
to whom?

399
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:41,790
Hey,

400
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:42,790
who should I send it to?

401
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,390
To whom?

402
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,300
[Fengyi Palace]

403
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:49,590
Your Highness,

404
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,870
you've been watching me
to practice for four hours.

405
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,070
How about you take a break?

406
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,200
I am appointed by His Majesty
to instruct you.

407
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,520
If you still can't remember

408
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,200
all the rules in the palace,

409
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,920
I dare not take a break.

410
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,000
I've remembered them.

411
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,480
Your Highness,

412
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,790
I've heard Shangsi Festival is a grand
celebration of spring of Yan Dynasty.

413
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,200
Everyone in the palace and commoners are
busy with rituals and prayers.

414
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,720
Your Highness,

415
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,280
you should hurry and attend
to your important matters.

416
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,870
Don't let my affairs delay your prayers.

417
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,040
You want to slip out of the palace?

418
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,070
No.

419
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,630
Imperial concubines can only

420
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,480
leave the palace under my permission.

421
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,630
Keep it in mind.

422
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,920
Yes.

423
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,590
Your Highness, can I leave the palace?

424
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,720
No.

425
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,000
The Shangsi Festival
is both a spring celebration

426
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,680
and a day for romantic enjoyment.

427
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,350
As a royal concubine,

428
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,830
what are you joining in the fun for?

429
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,110
Continue to practice.

430
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,000
Your Highness.

431
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:01,960
Your Highness.

432
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,200
Your Highness,

433
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:04,960
I need to use the restroom.

434
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:10,920
Go ahead.

435
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,310
Please go back, Your Highness.

436
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,000
If it takes too long,
the Noble Consort will punish you.

437
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,310
Let me rest a while longer.

438
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,150
Chagu,

439
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,630
my leg really hurts.

440
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,720
Rub it a little more.

441
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,310
It's Concubine Yan.

442
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:43,960
Chagu,

443
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,390
when we go back, just say

444
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,760
I ate something bad

445
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:48,480
and had loose bowels.

446
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,960
You've used this excuse before.

447
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,310
Why are there so many rules
in Great Yan?

448
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,440
They are more annoying
than the mosquitoes in Xiyan.

449
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,680
Does the Noble Consort spend all day
doing nothing

450
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,150
but watching me?

451
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,920
I've heard that the Noble Consort
is most concerned

452
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,070
about the marriage of her niece,
General Yin.

453
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,000
Right.

454
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,870
The No. 1 female general in Great Yan.

455
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,200
Forget it. I can't beat her.

456
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,110
Your Highness,

457
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,680
what do you want to do?

458
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,550
What can I do?

459
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,000
I just want the Noble Consort

460
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,150
to keep her eyes off me.

461
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:26,920
Could you ask Mr. Yue Qin

462
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,280
to plead with Her Highness?

463
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,070
No.

464
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,790
I can't bring trouble to my brother.

465
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,720
How about pleading with His Majesty?

466
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,000
I think His Majesty is nice
to Your Highness.

467
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,110
No.

468
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:45,920
I think

469
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,440
His Majesty is unfathomable.

470
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,760
Maybe he is more terrible
than a black bear when he gets angry.

471
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,790
I'd rather go back

472
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,350
​and stand in punishment
than plead with him.

473
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,780
[Fengyi Palace]

474
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,350
Greetings, Your Highness.

475
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,350
You still remember

476
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,720
that I'm in the palace.

477
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,760
I received my orders
right after I returned,

478
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,000
so I really couldn't get away.

479
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,200
Don't use His Majesty
as an excuse with me.

480
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,520
Now that you've returned
to the capital,

481
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:28,830
an arranged marriage for you

482
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,070
is inevitable.

483
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,070
You know it, Aunt.

484
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,200
My life's ambition is in the army.

485
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:37,440
Don't tell me you would
marry Great Yan again.

486
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,870
It's a pity you're a girl.

487
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,280
I was against it when my elder brother

488
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,480
had you join the army.

489
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,110
Fortunately, over these years,

490
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,720
you've earned quite a bit
of military merit

491
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,630
and gained the rights

492
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,070
to choose.

493
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,070
His Majesty's intention

494
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,870
is for you to choose one
from among the adult princes.

495
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:59,040
Whether or not the military token
of the Pingnan Army

496
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,440
can be passed down depends
entirely on His Majesty's decision.

497
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,390
The women of the Yin family

498
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,280
ultimately must marry
into the royal family.

499
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,480
I can see

500
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,760
the Crown Prince is into you.

501
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,110
But you just keep thinking
about Prince Jing.

502
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,830
Prince Jing is frivolous
and unrestrained.

503
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,720
How can he be worthy
of our Yin family's female general?

504
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,480
Aunt.

505
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,870
In all,

506
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,280
the Crown Prince

507
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,200
is the best choice.

508
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,830
On this Shangsi Festival, how about...?

509
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,520
Aunt,

510
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,790
the matters entrusted by His Majesty
have not been completed.

511
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,920
It's really not appropriate
to celebrate.

512
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,760
Your Highness, the Crown Prince
requests an audience.

513
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,070
Let him come in.

514
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
Greetings,

515
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,200
Your Highness.

516
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:45,870
As you were.

517
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,110
General Yin.

518
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,520
Greetings, Your Highness.

519
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,150
Your Highness, you've come just in time.

520
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,870
Just now, Luomei and I

521
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,520
were talking about you.

522
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,520
She's just returned to the capital,

523
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,630
and Your Highness sent her
many precious gifts.

524
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,240
She likes them very much.

525
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,110
As long as General Yin is satisfied.

526
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,150
I like her return gifts

527
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,920
very much.

528
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,520
Speaking of which,

529
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,630
you've been childhood sweethearts
since you were kids.

530
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:18,110
Why do you now seem distant now?

531
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,150
I remember

532
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,680
that Luomei loved all the excitement
and activity

533
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,680
when she was little.

534
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,760
One year on the Shangsi Festival,

535
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,480
she took Your Highness
to see the fire dragon.

536
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:30,920
Aunt,

537
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,200
it was Prince Jing

538
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,440
who took His Highness
to see the fire dragon.

539
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,520
Although the Shangsi Festival
is a day to celebrate the spring,

540
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:41,760
the custom of the fire dragon dance

541
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,790
is a ritual passed down
from our ancestors to honor the gods.

542
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,240
This year happens to mark the 35th year
of my father's reign.

543
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,590
The fire dragon display
will be the most spectacular.

544
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,200
General,

545
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,520
you haven't been back to the capital
for a long time.

546
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,190
Why don't you come with me

547
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:56,320
to pray for the safety and blessings
of our Great Yan's 100,000 soldiers?

548
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,320
Rest assured, Sir.

549
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,760
No matter what,

550
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,240
I will receive word from that person

551
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,040
after the Shangsi Festival.

552
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:24,430
Come and take a look.

553
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,590
Bravo!

554
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,880
Bravo!

555
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,880
