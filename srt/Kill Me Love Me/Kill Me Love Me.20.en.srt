The true culprit of the Qingzhou chaos

20
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,710
is none other than the Crown Prince,

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,480
Murong Xuanlie.

What did you just say?

23
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,120
Ten years ago,

24
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,230
the Crown Prince
forged the Weibei Army's token

25
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,430
and used Zhang Yin's Momai warriors, who
disguised themselves as the Weibei Army

26
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,760
and set fire to Qingzhou City.

27
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,760
Then, he dispatched his former advisor,
Li Qing,

28
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,840

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,870

the Wenhua Pavilion's fire incident

49
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,960
was orchestrated by the Crown Prince
to silence Zhang Yin

and his Momai warriors.

Ten years ago,

Big Brother tried to kill Li Qing,

56
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,680
but Zhang Yin saved him in secret

57
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,120
and hid him at the West Mountain Mine.

58

This

61
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,150

Unexpectedly, he has fallen ill now.

189
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,270
His Majesty has seen
all kinds of things in his life.

190
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,670
How could he faint suddenly?

191
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,150
Could it be an illness
that has been accumulating?

192
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,960
The symptoms appear to be a stroke.

193
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,750
Since it's a stroke,

194
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,360
why haven't you prescribed
a cure for him yet?

195
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,000
Every day wasted is a delay in saving.

196
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,720
I'm afraid Father

197
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,390
isn't truly suffering from a stroke.

198
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,750
This may be a dangerous move
of the Crown Prince.

199
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,670
The urgent task now

200
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,630
is to quickly identify the cause

201
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,120
and wake Father up as soon as possible.

202
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,960
By order of the Eastern Palace,

203
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,720
the palace gates are sealed.

204
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,360
No one is allowed in or out
without authorization.

205
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,910
With the Forbidden City
under martial law,

206
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,440
news from the palace will not get out.

207
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,030
I will stay in the palace to help you.

208
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,150
No.

209
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,600
The palace is too dangerous.

210
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,840
I can't keep you here.

211
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,120
I now stay at Fanghua Palace

212
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,640
under Concubine Yan's protection.

213
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,480
The Crown Prince won't dare
to attack me.

214
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,070
Don't worry.

215
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,000
I will find a way to resolve this.

216
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,760
You shouldn't be involved
in this any longer.

217
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,480
Revenge is never just your burden.

218
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,520
It shouldn't fall solely on you.

219
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,430
My Lord, if you let me stay,

220
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:36,950
I can assist you in investigating

221
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,360
His Majesty's illness more quickly.

222
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,310
Close the palace gates!

223
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,000
I'll leave my mother's hairpin with you.

224
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,670
I won't risk my life recklessly.

225
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,740
[Chengping Gate]

226
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:35,910
General,

227
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,070
we have learned that

228
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,190
tonight, His Majesty summoned
the Crown Prince

229
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,000
and Prince Jing to Yanming Palace,

230
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,070
dismissing everyone else.

231
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,160
Even Eunuch Liu is unaware

232
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,910
of what happened in the palace.

233
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,040
What's the situation now?

234
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,120
Eunuch Liu has begun inspecting

235
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,950
everything
His Majesty has come into contact with.

236
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,640
So far, nothing unusual has been found.

237
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,430
The Imperial Medical Institute claims

238
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,120
His Majesty's stroke

239
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,790
is due to accumulated fatigue.

240
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,160
With the Forbidden City
under martial law,

241
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,480
His Majesty's illness may not be minor.

242
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,590
Issue my orders.

243
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,190
Have all units of the Pingnan Army
strengthen their defenses

244
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,640
to prevent external threats.

245
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,710
The tiger tally has already
been handed over to His Majesty.

246
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,040
Someone will take over.

247
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,910
As long as military matters
aren't officially handed over,

248
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,120
I remain a general of Great Yan.

249
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,240
Do not slack off.

250
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,830
You may go back.

251
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,950
I will visit Aunt.

252
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes.

253
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,910
His Majesty

254
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,070
has long been worn out.

255
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,760
This day was bound to come.

256
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,590
I'm worried

257
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,310
someone might cause trouble

258
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,000
out of dissatisfaction.

259
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,910
Are you referring

260
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,190
to Prince Jing?

261
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,950
The food, medicinal soups,

262
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:56,880
and incense I sent to Yanming Palace

263
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,240
have all been inspected by Liu Zhong.

264
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,950
They even suspect me
of poisoning His Majesty.

265
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,280
Eunuch Liu is just
doing a routine check.

266
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,240
If we have nothing to hide,

267
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:10,910
then let them investigate.

268
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,520
We and the Eastern Palace
share the same fate.

269
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,280
They are trying to smear Fengyi Palace

270
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,590
to prevent the Crown Prince
from taking over as regent.

271
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,310
Given the circumstances,

272
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,360
I actually hope His Majesty
won't wake up.

273
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,400
As long as the Crown Prince
ascends the throne,

274
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,360
the Pingnan Army's tiger tally
will be returned to the Yin family.

275
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,190
Do you think

276
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,000
I am heartless?

277
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:52,950
But for so many years,

278
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:58,190
His Majesty has only been
treating me as the sovereign.

279
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,640
The Yin family in the harem

280
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,830
can never long for his love.

281
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,910
If I hadn't been tough,

282
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,430
I would have perished
in this palace long ago.

283
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:16,670
Luomei,

284
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,910
you're luckier

285
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,360
than me.

286
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,950
You don't have to choose
between the Yin family and love.

287
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,120
The Crown Prince needs you
more than I do.

288
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:42,950
Your Highness,

289
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,000
Liu Zhong is now
investigating everything

290
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,590
that entered Yanming Palace
in the past month,

291
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,760
including

292
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,480
the incense sent by Fengyi Palace.

293
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,240
Has he found anything?

294
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,040
No.

295
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,480
Rest assured, Your Highness.

296
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,160
All traces have been erased.

297
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,280
It won't be easy to discover anything.

298
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,310
My concern is that

299
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,190
Liu Zhong

300
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,830
seems to have sided with Prince Jing.

301
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,710
Liu Zhong is a loyal dog.

302
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,480
He has been in the palace longer
than anyone else.

303
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,640
He won't take sides.

304
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,190
By the way, Your Highness,

305
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,910
since Fengyi Palace
and the Eastern Palace are allies,

306
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:12,950
why don't we

307
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,550
inform the Noble Consort of our plans?

308
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,880
It's not the right time yet.

309
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,760
It's a pity we're just one step away.

310
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,670
Now, with the Imperial Guards
defending Yanming Palace,

311
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,910
we can't take action.

312
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,640
As long as they don't find the cause,

313
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,760
they'll perform stroke therapy.

314
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,360
It's only a matter of time

315
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,670
before His Majesty passes away.

316
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,070
At such a critical moment,
we mustn't lower our guard.

317
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,520
While the palace is under lockdown,

318
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,550
remove all of Jinghe's spies
in the palace.

319
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:43,830
Understood.

320
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:45,760
Your Highness,

321
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,000
the Prince Heir of Xiyan is here.

322
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,240
This way.

323
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:09,880
Your Highness,

324
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,120
the Prince Heir has arrived.

325
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,120
Prince Heir,

326
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:14,910
you've come just in time.

327
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,000
I was just troubled by this chess game.

328
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,520
Your Highness,

329
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,430
I tried to visit Concubine Yan just now,

330
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,550
but the Imperial Guards stopped me,

331
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,310
saying I needed a decree
from the Eastern Palace to enter.

332
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,400
Your Highness, have you forgotten?

333
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,280
I was granted the privilege

334
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,910
to visit Fanghua Palace at any time.

335
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
My apologies.

336
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,000
This is a special time.

337
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,710
There's nothing I can do.

338
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,710
What special time?

339
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,070
You don't know?

340
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,360
Well, you'll find out tomorrow.

341
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,710
Father often says
you are a skilled chess player.

342
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,310
Why not help me solve this puzzle?

343
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,120
If I want to win with the black pieces,

344
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,350
how should I move?

345
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,870
The black pieces
have surrounded the white ones.

346
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,550
No matter where you
place the next piece,

347
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,630
victory is assured.

348
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:19,760
But what if you want to help
the white pieces break free?

349
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,790
I am not a player in this game,

350
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,920
but a mere observer.

351
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,350
I have no intention
of disrupting Your Highness's strategy.

352
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,520
Outside the chessboard,

353
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,390
are you my enemy or my friend?

354
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,520
The farewell gift I offered
when leaving Great Yan

355
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,240
was a gift to a friend.

356
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,310
I have few close ties in this life,

357
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,830
and the only one I care for
is my sister.

358
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,870
If Your Highness can promise
not to harm Fanghua Palace,

359
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,350
I'll be

360
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,790
your friend.

361
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,440
Otherwise,

362
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,000
I'll be your enemy.

363
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,310
Very well.

364
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,680
Rest assured, Prince Heir.

365
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,390
Concubine Yan

366
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,000
will live peacefully

367
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,310
and prosperously

368
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,870
in Fanghua Palace.

369
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,310
You've got quite some skills,
Prince Heir.

370
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,350
I'm not sure if we can be friends,

371
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,590
but I won't be your enemy.

372
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,440
I'm flattered, Your Highness.

373
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:56,790
As I said before,

374
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,000
I have no interest
in the internal politics of Great Yan.

375
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,830
I only wish to protect
the ones I care about.

376
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,520
Your Highness,

377
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,830
Mei Lin is still in Fanghua Palace.

378
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,350
Forget it.

379
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,440
At this moment, I cannot risk
pushing the Prince Heir of Xiyan

380
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,920
toward Prince Jing.

381
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,480
Dawn

382
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,630
is approaching.

383
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,300
[Taichi Palace]

384
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,070
Proclamation:

385
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,760
I, as the sovereign of this realm,

386
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,310
for the stability of the state

387
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,520
and the expectations of the people,

388
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,350
while ruling the nation,

389
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,110
I have diligently considered
day and night

390
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,760
how to restore propriety

391
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,440
and govern justly.

392
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,550
If any sudden illness

393
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,240
has prevented me
from attending to state affairs,

394
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,760
the Crown Prince is granted

395
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,520
the authority to act as regent.

396
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,440
All military and governmental matters

397
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,280
are entrusted to the Eastern Palace.

398
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,350
Proceed with caution and due diligence

399
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,280
Execute as decreed.

400
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,520
The proclamation is now complete.

401
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,150
I humbly accept the decree.

402
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,630
I will not fail Father's trust.

403
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,310
We will comply with the decree.

404
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,390
Your Highness,

405
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,720
I have a matter to present.

406
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,680
Lord Censor, please speak.

407
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,720
The governance of Great Yan

408
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,720
has always relied
on His Majesty's decisions.

409
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:58,310
The Yin family has long been graced
by His Majesty's favor,

410
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,590
commanding the thirty thousand soldiers
of the Pingnan Army

411
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,440
with the authority
to mobilize the troops independently.

412
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,790
The camp to the west of the city

413
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,480
is tasked with defending Zhaojing.

414
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,870
Most of its troops
are former members of the Pingnan Army.

415
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,550
I've heard that since General Yin
returned to the capital,

416
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,480
she has been inspecting the camps
at the West Suburbs Barracks.

417
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,720
What do you mean by this, Lord Li?

418
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:27,070
The Yin family and the Pingnan Army
are loyal to His Majesty

419
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,390
and to Great Yan.

420
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,110
Now that His Majesty is unwell,

421
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,390
if General Yin is truly loyal,

422
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,070
she should hand over the tiger tally

423
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,760
to reassure the people

424
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,790
and restore order.

425
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,680
Lord Censor, you're overthinking it.

426
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,720
When Father arranged my marriage,

427
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,280
General Yin already relinquished
her military authority.

428
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,200
The tiger tally

429
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,150
is now in my possession.

430
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,960
Eunuch Liu,

431
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,790
is this appropriate?

432
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,280
With the Crown Prince acting as regent,

433
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,790
the tiger tally should indeed
stay in the Eastern Palace.

434
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,480
The Yin family members
are all loyal subjects.

435
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,240
Both I and Father
have no doubts about them.

436
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,390
Your Highness,

437
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,240
although the tiger tally
has been handed over,

438
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,870
the transition of military command
takes time.

439
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,630
The day after tomorrow will be
my final inspection of the camps.

440
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,000
By then,

441
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,590
I will present to the court
a well-disciplined Pingnan Army

442
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,350
with clear defense protocols.

443
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,040
General Yin's strict military governance

444
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,680
is what reassures me the most.

445
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,630
The Censorate has the duty
to oversee all officials.

446
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,150
Lord Censor is known
for his integrity and fairness.

447
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,200
I will not reproach him
for his vigilance.

448
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,550
As His Majesty has entrusted me

449
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,000
with the nation's affairs
in these perilous times,

450
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,440
I ask all of you to assist me

451
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,200
in stabilizing the state

452
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,590
and ensuring His Majesty's health.

453
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,070
We shall fulfill our duties

454
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:13,720
and help Your Highness
protect the nation and its people.

455
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,280
General Yin,

456
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,480
His Highness would like to see you.

457
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:12,550
My Lord,

458
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,520
this is the residue
from His Majesty's recent tonic.

459
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,680
Take it

460
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,720
and have a physician examine it.

461
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,630
Yes.

462
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:23,480
Also,

463
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,680
all our spies in the palace

464
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,310
have been replaced quietly.

465
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,550
Fortunately,

466
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,760
we still have Miss Mei Lin
secretly relaying messages.

467
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,150
Don't worry, My Lord.

468
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
She is clever

469
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,520
and will be fine.

470
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,150
Send a message to General Yin.

471
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,520
Ask her to come to the mansion.

472
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,150
General Yin is betrothed
to the Crown Prince.

473
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,280
Besides,

474
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,720
the tiger tally is currently
in the Crown Prince's possession.

475
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,240
It might not be wise

476
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:47,960
to rope her in now.

477
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
She is loyal to the Emperor.

478
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,480
I trust her.

479
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,310
Your Highness' foresight is impressive.

480
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,150
Prince Jing's Mansion sent this man to
send a message to the General's Mansion.

481
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,480
I've taken care of it.

482
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,200
Tell Jinghe

483
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,760
that I have received his message

484
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,310
on my Crown Princess's behalf.

485
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,580
[Sima's Code]

486
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,350
Your Highness.

487
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,350
I apologize
for your mistreatment today in court.

488
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,040
Rest assured,

489
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,960
I will return the tiger tally to you
soon.

490
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,150
Lord Censor spoke only

491
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,520
for the sake of the court's stability.

492
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,480
I did not feel mistreated.

493
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,070
Your Highness,

494
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,550
have you not been resting well?

495
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,390
Father fell ill today.

496
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,520
I'm managing state affairs,

497
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,150
worried about possible unrest.

498
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,590
I'm mentally exhausted.

499
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,350
Only when I'm with you

500
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,200
do I feel at ease.

501
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,440
So,

502
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,870
are you worried
about my Yin family causing trouble,

503
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,150
so you placed spies in my mansion

504
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,960
and secretly detained
Prince Jing's messenger?

505
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,070
You met him?

506
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,000
Before I did,

507
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,870
your men took him away.

508
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,070
I know of your concerns,

509
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,680
but my family has been loyal
to the Emperor for generations,

510
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,630
never harboring any
treacherous intentions.

511
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,920
Military authority of the Pingnan Army
has already been handed over.

512
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,680
Even if I want to help anyone,

513
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,520
I am powerless.

514
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,960
Why would you think that?

515
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,070
If I doubted you,

516
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,720
why could I give you a letter of
commission to lead troops into battle?

517
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:50,390
Have you forgotten?

518
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,520
I told you,

519
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,680
I would fulfill

520
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,110
whatever I promised you.

521
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,070
Then why did you

522
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,150
place spies in my mansion?

523
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,280
The Yin family's loyalty is known.

524
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,110
Even without military power,

525
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,390
you still hold respect
and support among the people.

526
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,680
I'm worried someone might exploit it.

527
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,110
Given the current situation,

528
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,520
we must be wary of Prince Jing.

529
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:16,870
Remember,

530
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,720
whatever he says

531
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,390
is only
to manipulate your military authority

532
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,790
and sow discord between us.

533
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,440
Are you worried that

534
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,550
I will take my previous relationship
with Prince Jing into account?

535
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:36,920
Ever since we were children,

536
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,070
whenever Jinghe was present,

537
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,440
you would be looking at him.

538
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,200
Compared to me,

539
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,550
you have always been closer to him.

540
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,550
Yet, compared to Prince Jing,

541
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,240
I have spent more time with you.

542
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,920
Do you remember
when the incident in Qingzhou happened,

543
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,760
and we were not sure
if Prince Jing was dead or alive?

544
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,000
I waited an entire night
at the city gate,

545
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,110
and you were the one
who stayed by my side.

546
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,350
When he returned alive,

547
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,150
you left me a letter the next night

548
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,630
and departed for Qingzhou.

549
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:19,040
Your Highness,
do you remember this sachet?

550
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,680
In the 19th year of the Zhaoming era,

551
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,280
I went to war in Nanyue.

552
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,870
Nanyue was filled
with insects and diseases.

553
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,680
It was you

554
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,000
who sent this insect-repelling sachet
to the border.

555
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,720
I just found out about this now.

556
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,520
Every gift you gave me

557
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,520
is a sign of your true intentions.

558
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,150
You've done so much for me.

559
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,240
I just realized it too late.

560
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,110
As long as you understand,

561
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,350
it is never too late.

562
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,870
Your Highness,
as the heir apparent of Great Yan,

563
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,630
you are known
for your benevolence and kindness,

564
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,000
loving your people
as a father loves his children.

565
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,520
Jinghe and I are merely comrades.

566
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,000
But you

567
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,720
are my beloved.

568
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,110
No matter what happens,

569
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,310
I will stand by you.

570
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,150
Didn't you promise to stand with me

571
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,440
in defending Great Yan?

572
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,280
Luomei,

573
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,240
whatever kind of person
you wish me to be,

574
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,720
I will become.

575
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,920
You're known
for your benevolence and kindness,

576
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,520
loving your people
as a father loves his children.

577
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:07,870
This is...

578
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,590
The Crown Princess
sent this calming tonic,

579
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,070
specifically instructing me

580
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,350
to ensure you finish it.

581
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,200
Is there any news from Yanming Palace?

582
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,390
Every item His Majesty uses,

583
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,920
from large utensils

584
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,280
to small grains he eats

585
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,200
is being thoroughly inspected
by Liu Zhong.

586
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,960
But rest assured, Your Highness,

587
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,110
all arrangements have been made.

588
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,590
Even if His Majesty's illness is traced

589
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,720
back to the incense at Yanming Palace,

590
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,200
that incense was sent by Fengyi Palace.

591
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,550
It has nothing to do with
the Eastern Palace.

592
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:55,390
If the Noble Consort is found guilty
of regicide,

593
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,110
the Crown Princess,
in order to protect the Yin family,

594
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,440
will still stand by your side.

595
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:04,790
Let's go

596
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,240
to Fengyi Palace.

[Petition from]
[the Imperial Medical Institute, Huang Qi]

599
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,240
I have discovered the cause
of Father's illness.

600
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,830
He was poisoned,

601
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,110
and the culprit is you, Your Highness.

602
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,960
Who dares to slander me?

603
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,550
The incense

604
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:28,240
was sent from Fengyi Palace
to Yanming Palace.

605
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:34,960
The incense

606
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,150
was a gift from the young lord of Xiyan.

607
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,760
It has a calming effect on sleep.

608
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,150
Recently,
Concubine Yan has gained favor,

609
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,830
and Father can't sleep
since he's worried about Third Brother.

610
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,150
Your Highness,

611
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,790
why not use this incense

612
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,200
to ease Father's mind?

613
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,240
How dare you.

614
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,960
You tried to kill the Emperor.

615
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,830
There is both evidence and testimony.

616
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,680
How could the crime of regicide
be pinned on me?

617
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,110
Do you dare to falsely accuse me?

618
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,150
Aren't you afraid of implicating Luomei?

619
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,150
Your Highness,
you may be the one endangering Luomei.

620
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,390
If this petition reaches
the Ministry of Justice,

621
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,240
the entire honor of the Yin family

622
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,000
will be destroyed by you.

623
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,920
Are you trying to use the Yin family

624
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,240
and my life to threaten Luomei?

625
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:45,240
Father's condition won't remain hidden
for long.

626
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,310
Luomei might show mercy to Jinghe

627
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,630
and make a different choice from you.

628
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,350
You and I are in the same boat,
Your Highness.

629
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,110
If I disembark now,

630
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,040
I'm afraid

631
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,830
you'll end up a ghost
at the bottom of the water.

632
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,720
Luomei has long since chosen you.

633
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,630
Luomei chose

634
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,390
the benevolent and kind Crown Prince.

635
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,760
Do you think that's me?

636
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,830

Are ten years not enough?

648
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,040
I'll offer another ten.

00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,070
what should I do?

652
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,000
I'm so scared.

653
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,190
Don't be afraid, Your Highness.

654
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,110
I'm here,

655
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,270
and so is your brother.

656
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,360
My brother sent me a letter
a few days ago,

657
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,320
saying he would take me back to Xiyan.

658
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,630
You don't want to go back to Xiyan?

659
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,800
In the past,

660
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,230
I would have been very eager to return.

661
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,270
But now, I don't know why.

662
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:59,150
Whenever I think about
leaving His Majesty,

663
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,040
I feel extremely sad.

664
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,110
His Majesty's been nice to me.

665
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,880
I can't leave him now.

666
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,270
What should I do?

667
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:10,550
Even the gods
don't seem willing to help me.

00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,750

669
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,590
It's okay.

670

It's fine.

671
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,040
Better to rely on people than gods.

00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,800

to save His Majesty.

says he can't be saved.

All matters, large or small,
in the palace

There is no need
to make independent purchases.

00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,550
His Majesty once decreed

694
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,480
that since Concubine Yan
follows different customs,

695
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,960
she may make purchases independently

696

I have been praying for his recovery
these past few days.

The tung oil scrolls used
for the prayers have run out,

to retrieve the scrolls
that I previously offered.

707
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,110
I beseech the gods and Buddhas.

708
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,960

by others.

I have sent my personal maid.

between Great Yan and Xiyan.

00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,590
while the tonic contains sulfur
to invigorate the yang.

734
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,270
If they're taken together,

735
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,880
it will erode the heart meridians,

736
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,960
posing great harm to the body.

737
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,360
Is there an antidote?

738
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,150
Only if we get the exact formula

739
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,800
can I prepare an antidote.

740
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:43,040
Even a slight mistake
could worsen the condition.

741
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,710
Using centennial agarwood in incense

742
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,550
is a unique method created
by the Prince Heir of Xiyan.

743
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,040
It seems the Crown Prince is quite adept

744
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,840
at using others
to carry out his schemes.

745
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,960
Using the Noble Consort
is not enough for him.

746
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,710
The Prince Heir would not harm
His Majesty.

747
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,840
He became the Prince Heir of Xiyan

748
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,440
with Father's support.

749
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,110
The succession of Great Yan

750
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,230
holds no benefit for him.

751
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,360
My Lord.

752
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:13,670
My Lord,

753
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,110
the Prince Heir of Xiyan is here.

754
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,800
We can just...

755
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:17,880
I will meet him shortly.

756
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:18,800
Yes.

757
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,800
I don't want you to meet him.

758
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,630
My Lord.

759
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,190
You need to rest now.

760
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,360
Other matters

761
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,070
are not worth your concern.

762
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,670
If you feel any discomfort,

763
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,670
tell me immediately.

764
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,630
It's summer,

765
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,840
and I've always feared the heat.

766
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,040
I'm fine.

767
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,110
Then stay in Zhanyue Pavilion.

768
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,360
As the Prince Heir of Xiyan,
you're indeed a capable man.

769
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,110
You're skilled in tea brewing,

770
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,070
playing chess,

771
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,110
incense making,

772
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,670
and many other things.

773
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,960
No wonder the Crown Prince
praises the gifts

774
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,590
given by you, Prince Heir.

775
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,070
I thought you wouldn't see me.

776
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,040
His Majesty is gravely ill.

777
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,270
I'm visiting you late at night.

778
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,190
Aren't you afraid the Crown Prince

779
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,320
will accuse you
of conspiring with Xiyan?

780
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,750
I doubt the Crown Prince would
be willing to part

781
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,520
with the incense you gave him.

782
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,040
Would he really let you
accompany me to the grave?

783
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:53,150
His Majesty's illness

784
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,880
is related to the incense I made?

785
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:55,630
That's right.

786
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,550
To prepare the antidote,

787
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,440
we need your incense.

788
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:01,110
If my father passes away,

789
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,960
it will do you no good.

790
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,440
You're a wise man.

791
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,070
You should know what choice to make.

792
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,960
I made the incense merely
for peace of mind.

793
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,550
Since you like it,

794
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,040
it is yours now.

795
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,860
[Incense Formula]

796
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,840
Here is the detailed formula.

797
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:28,880
Thank you.

798
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,960
You may have the formula,

799
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,320
but I seek a favor in return.

800
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,550
She is not a favor.

801
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,110
She is the one I love.

802
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,440
I love her too.

803
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,710
I hope that you let go

804
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,520
and let Mei Lin choose freely.

805
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,590
And if I refuse?

806
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,190
You will eventually agree.

807
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,110
I just don't wish

808
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,070
to see Mei Lin in danger again.

809
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,270
In the current situation,

810
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,710
I am the only one
who can protect Mei Lin.

811
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,880
She is my woman.

812
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,750
I will protect her myself.

813
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:06,110
During the spring hunt,

814
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,800
if Mei Lin hadn't risked her life
to get you out of the hunting grounds,

815
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,520
the one by her side now would be me.

816
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,270
Murong Jinghe,

817
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,670
it is not you who protects her,

818
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,400
but she who protects you.

819
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,920
If His Majesty truly does not wake up,

820
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:23,880
by that time,

821
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,190
in your current state,

822
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:26,880
it may be difficult to
even protect yourself, Prince Jing,

823
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,320
let alone protect Mei Lin.

824
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:32,000
Thirty thousand Xiyan royal troops
are already stationed at the border.

825
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,230
Even if the Crown Prince ascends
to the throne,

826
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,550
he will still fear me.

827
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,230
Only I

828
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:38,750
can protect Mei Lin

829
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:39,880
while you

830
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:41,800
can achieve nothing.
