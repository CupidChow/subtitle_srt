00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,630
Niuniu is right.

193
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,390
Family is

194
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,910
where the immortals are.

195
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,150
These piles of stones

196
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,320
can be used for a tribute

197
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,080
and prayers.

198
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,240
Father,

199
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,510
Mother,

200
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,080
don't worry.

201
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,840
I'll take care of myself

202
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,440
and forget about the unpleasant things.

203
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,440
I'll live on well.

204
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,550
Once the Crown Prince
faces his punishment,

205
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,630
I will help you open
a spring flower cake shop.

206
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,510
It's a deal.

207
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,960
It's a deal.

208
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,660
[Shuanglin Courtyard]

209
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,480
Let's make a bet.

210
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,670
If I can grow Red Fruits,

211
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,080
you will marry me.

212
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,120
The Red Fruit has sprouted.

213
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,960
It's a good sign.

214
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,550
Get me a flower pot.

215
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,910
Yes.

216
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,360
After we bring down the Crown Prince,

217
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,120
when the situation is stable,

218
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,120
we will go back to Qingzhou together.

219
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,910
You'll open a fruit cake shop

220
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,390
and I'll be General Weibei.

221
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,390
In peace, we'll paint.

222
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,750
In war, we'll fight.

223
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,670
Would you like

224
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,390
such a life?

225
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,960
Yes.

226
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,600
I must fulfill

227
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,790
at least one of the things
I promised you.

228
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,600
My Lord,

229
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,550
Mei Lin and the Prince Heir
are arriving at Xiyan's court.

230
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,320
Should we withdraw her protectors?

231
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,750
When she arrives safely,

232
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,790
withdraw them.

233
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,120
Yes.

234
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:04,870
Look,

235
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,080
the Prince Heir's carriage!

236
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,910
The Prince Hier is back
with Moon Kunlun.

237
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,600
God bless Xiyan.

238
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,960
Greetings, Sun Kunlun.

239
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,910
Greetings, Moon Kunlun.

240
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,550
Your Highness.

241
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,720
The people of Xiyan worship the gods.

242
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,960
We are the reincarnations
of Sun and Moon Kunluns

243
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,030
who bring blessings to Xiyan.

244
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,750
Naturally, people worship us.

245
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,600
But I'm not really
the reincarnation of Kunlun.

246
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,670
Marrying you as the divine woman
and bringing you back to Xiyan

247
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,870
was not only

248
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,630
a desperate measure to help you escape,

249
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,790
but it was also my intention

250
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,630
to legitimize trade
between our countries.

251
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,750
As long as trade flourishes

252
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,670
and wealth can be easily amassed,

253
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,080
Father will believe I'm the Chosen One.

254
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,320
When we part,

255
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,080
it won't affect our nations' relations.

256
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,960
I understand.

257
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,440
Thank you, Your Highness.

258
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,790
I'm a grateful person.

259
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,360
I'd also prefer

260
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,150
peace between our countries.

261
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,960
Don't worry, Your Highness.

262
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,110
I'll do my best
to ensure smooth border trade.

263
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,030
Father,

264
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,110
I've fulfilled my promise.

265
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,750
Princess Zongshuo of the Yan Dynasty

266
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,350
is the divine woman I've sought.

267
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,510
I'm Princess Zongshuo, Mei Lin.

268
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,070
Greetings, Your Majesty.

269
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,310
Congratulations, Your Majesty,
on the divine woman's arrival.

270
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,000
Long live Your Majesty.

271
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:03,880
Your Majesty,

272
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,750
the princess has not made
any offerings to the gods.

273
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,920
Why would she be protected by the gods?

274
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,200
General, do you mean that I have
misunderstood the will of Heaven?

275
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,110
General, you don't know

276
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,350
that Princess Zongshuo is from Qingzhou.

277
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,590
When I was King of Qingzhou,

278
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,350
she lived at my mansion.

279
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,310
Everyone in the mansion
made offerings to the gods.

280
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,240
Certainly,

281
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,070
the princess did that too.

282
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,070
This is a detailed list

283
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,400
of the servants in my mansion
ten years ago.

284
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,070
Please check it, Father.

285
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,790
The gods have blessed us.

286
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:18,640
I'll choose an auspicious day
to crown her Princess Heir.

287
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,400
The gods have blessed us.

288
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,750
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

289
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,200
Congratulations, Prince Heir.

290
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,750
Congratulations, Princess Heir.

291
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,270
The gods have blessed us.

292
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,400
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

293
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,350
Congratulations, Prince Heir.

294
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,480
Congratulations, Princess Heir.

295
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,070
The divine prophecy should
be embroidered on the divine woman.

296
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,590
This has been the rule
throughout the ages.

297
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,110
There has never been a precedent of
embroidering it on Sun Kunlun.

298
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,400
The Sun Kunlun and Moon Kunlun are one.

299
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,030
Since it's a blessing for Xiyan,

300
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,160
it's just as well it's on me.

301
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,000
Well...

302
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,480
I'll explain to His Majesty's first.

303
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,550
Time is running out.

304
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,480
It's the auspicious time now.

305
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,350
Do you want to disobey the gods' will,
Great Witch?

306
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,750
I'll explain

307
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,070
the rest to Father myself.

308
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,830
What is it?

309
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,240
Your Majesty,

310
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,880
General You, General Zuo,
and Minister Zhong in the court

311
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,000
oppose the mutual market with Qingzhou.

312
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:54,920
Father,

313
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,960
here is the agreement drawn up

314
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,000
by the Emperor of the Yan Dynasty

315
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,750
for the border trade interchange
with Xiyan.

316
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,920
It will also

317
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,400
support your immortality plan, Father.

318
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:18,030
You always want to build the
Tower of Immortality in the southwest.

319
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,960
After the two countries start trading,

320
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,960
wealth can be easily amassed.

321
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,480
With the blessing from the divine woman,

322
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,960
the border trade will go smoothly.

323
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,920
By then, Father shall
use the funds from trade

324
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,440
to build the Tower of Immortality.

325
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,640
That's good.

326
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,310
I'll arrange your wedding

327
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,110
on the day when the tower is completed.

328
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,590
Your Majesty,

329
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,880
Qingzhou is rich in iron ores.

330
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,270
If we seize Qingzhou,

331
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,590
Xiyan will no longer

332
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,240
rely on the Yan Dynasty for iron.

333
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,680
This is an extraordinary gain.

334
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,590
Your Majesty, please rest assured.

335
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,350
When the Tower of Immortality is built,

336
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,960
Your Majesty will be cured.

337
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,270
Let the divine woman and the Prince Heir

338
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,680
leave for Qingzhou as soon as possible

339
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,160
to open the mutual market.

340
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:28,830
Yes.

341
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,590
Your Highness.

342
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,880
Mei Lin,

343
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,830
Father agreed to the border trade.

344
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,720
We'll return to Qingzhou soon.

345
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,270
You don't look well.

346
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,550
Are you feeling any discomfort?

347
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,400
No.

348
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,110
It's just the rush back.

349
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,640
There's a lot to be done
about the border trade.

350
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,240
Wait here for a moment.

351
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:29,880
It hurts.

352
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,830
Mei, it's me, Jia.

353
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,200
Jia?

354
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,350
Mei, you're still so strong!

355
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,590
You're strong like a man.

356
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,640
Did I hurt you?

357
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,400
Jia, I told you.

358
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,590
Don't surprise Mei.

359
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,000
You'll startle her.

360
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,590
Yi?

361
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,310
It's you two.

362
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,000
It's nice to see you here.

363
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:51,590
Mei,

364
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,110
come on.

365
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:52,550
Take a seat.

366
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,000
Sit.

367
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,640
It's thanks to the Prince Heir

368
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,550
we're alive

369
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,030
and back in Xiyan.

370
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,750
I once wanted to be East Palace's madam,

371
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,400
but he caused the Qingzhou incident.

372
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,750
Forget it.

373
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,750
He paid with his life.

374
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,400
I knew Mei'd be more capable
than any of us.

375
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,750
Mei, you're the divine woman of Xiyan.

376
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,310
If the Prince Heir found you sooner,

377
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,000
you wouldn't be
a peace-making Beauty.

378
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,960
Being the Princess Heir is better than
a concubine in Prince Jing's Mansion.

379
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,920
Alright now.

380
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,160
We're in Xiyan's palace.

381
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,680
Mei is the Princess Heir now.

382
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,270
Let's not talk about the past,

383
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,270
or Mei will be affected.

384
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,720
Right.

385
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,960
Where's your neighbor boy?

386
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,240
He married long ago.

387
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,750
I don't blame him.

388
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,160
We weren't meant for each other.

389
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,920
Yi, you should blame him.

390
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,920
If he hadn't rejected you publicly,

391
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:41,960
you wouldn't have been embarrassed

392
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,110
in front of the village

393
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,880
or become a palace maid.

394
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,000
We should

395
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,350
put him in a sack

396
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,550
and throw him to the bears.

397
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,110
Right.

398
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,000
I'll beat him up.

399
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,400
We'll beat him up.

400
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,640
Thank you.

401
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,750
I'm content to enter the palace

402
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,750
under the Prince Heir's protection.

403
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,030
I once sought refuge through beauty,

404
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,400
but now I know

405
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,680
I must rely on myself

406
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,880
for safety.

407
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:04,640
Yi,

408
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,680
you should leave the palace
and do business with me.

409
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,070
You're doing business now?

410
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,310
These are my bestselling powders.

411
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:13,110
The Xiyan-Qingzhou border trade
will be approved soon.

412
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,830
Mei, you're from Qingzhou,

413
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,750
you must know
the popular fragrances there.

414
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,110
I was wondering
why you'd be so generous.

415
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,640
So, that's what you're after.

416
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,550
Mei, wait up.

417
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,920
Yi, hurry up.

418
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:33,680
Let's go now.

419
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,160
Your Highness,

420
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,240
you've done so much,

421
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,960
why hide it from the Princess Heir?

422
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,270
She wasn't

423
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,830
supposed to bear this.

424
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,510
But...

425
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,820
[Fanghua Palace]

426
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,160
Save the beads to make a golden phoenix.

427
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,640
Collect the silk to make a hairpin.

428
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,110
Different kinds of pearls.

429
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,680
Chagu,

430
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,310
I don't think Mei Lin likes

431
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,110
any of these things.

432
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,240
Your Highness,

433
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,160
the princess's dowry
needs to be valuable.

434
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,550
Right.

435
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,310
If she doesn't like them,
she can sell them.

436
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,680
Chagu,

437
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,070
prepare something else

438
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,160
that Mei Lin likes.

439
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,960
But what does Miss Mei Lin like?

440
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,750
Prince Jing?

441
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,480
She no longer likes him.

442
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,160
I really don't know

443
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,440
what Mei Lin likes.

444
00:27:59,350 --> 00:27:59,920
Chagu.

445
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:00,880
Chagu,

446
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:01,880
look.

447
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,160
Should I give Mei Lin these two items?

448
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,350
Mei Lin is a good fighter,

449
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,720
so she'll need this
for hunting in Xiyan.

450
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,510
The saber will also look good
on her belt.

451
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,680
Your Highness brought it

452
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,920
all the way from Xiyan to the palace.

453
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,200
It's Your Highness' favorite.

454
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,160
I won't need it in the Imperial Palace,

455
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,400
but Mei Lin will need it in Xiyan.

456
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,880
Chagu, get me a brush.

457
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,070
I'll write to Mei Lin.

458
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,750
There's much fun

459
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,110
to be had in Xiyan's palace.

460
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,070
I almost forgot this.

461
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,830
She's too restrained in the palace.

462
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,440
Your Majesty,

463
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,200
shall I ask Her Highness to receive you?

464
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,000
Do it.

465
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,790
Yes, Your Majesty.

466
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,720
Your Highness,

467
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,830
His Majesty is here.
Will you receive him?

468
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,500
[Fanghua Palace]

469
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:32,790
Your Majesty,

470
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,830
Her Highness said

471
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,110
her wound hasn't healed,

472
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,830
and it's indecent to meet you.

473
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,510
She fears upsetting Your Majesty

474
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,480
and asks for mercy.

475
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,440
Your Highness,

476
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,550
why are you hiding from His Majesty?

477
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:11,920
Look,

478
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,830
my injury hasn't healed.

479
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,270
I don't want His Majesty to see it.

480
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,830
This is the wound
from rescuing Your Highness.

481
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,480
His Majesty should see it.

482
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,160
He might reward you.

483
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,110
Fanghua Palace is full

484
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,400
of rewards I don't like.

485
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,510
What do you like, Concubine Yan?

486
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,680
Stop there.

487
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,510
The physicians
of the Imperial Medical Institute

488
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,240
failed, didn't they?

489
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,830
I have recovered, Your Majesty.

490
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,270
So that means

491
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,400
you're deliberately avoiding me.

492
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:12,720
I...

493
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,160
I'm afraid.

494
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,440
Afraid of what?

495
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:19,640
Afraid of me?

496
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,160
Apart from being afraid,

497
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,070
I'm also...

498
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,440
I'm also...

499
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,070
Also what?

500
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,030
If you like him,

501
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,240
you want to understand his past,

502
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,350
empathize with his experiences,

503
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,310
and wish to be with him in the future.

504
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,590
I'm also

505
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,000
shy.

506
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,880
And...

507
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,830
I think I really like you, Your Majesty.

508
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,550
It's him.

509
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,960
How dare he come here?

510
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,270
How sickening.

511
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,590
He's cunning and despicable.

512
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,180
Look at him.

513
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,640
He's so vicious.

514
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,640
It's all because of him.

515
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,880
There was a Dengguo wood
in my courtyard.

516
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,160
Every year, when it snowed,

517
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,110
the fruits on the trees

518
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,110
were as beautiful
as the wintersweet you painted.

519
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:04,260
[Qinglin Lane]

520
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,670
When the Xiyan people were in Qingzhou,

521
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,590
the neighbors in Qinglin Lane
often paid my mother

522
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,400
for the fruit cakes she made.

523
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,000
[Qinglin Lane]

524
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,590
If my mother were still alive,

525
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,960
our family's fruit cake shop
would surely be

526
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,150
the best business in all of Qingzhou.

527
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,360
Stop running! Fatty, don't run!

528
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,110
Stop there! Don't run!

529
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,190
Stop!

530
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,920
You shouldn't have scared my mother.

531
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,480
I won't dare do it again.

532
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,320
I'll beat you up.

533
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,710
You shouldn't have scared my mother.

534
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,190
I once knocked out two teeth

535
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,840
of the fat boy
who lived next door to us.

536
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,590
I was only eight at that time.

537
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,190
I dare you to do it again.

538
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,590
Why?

539
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:47,840
Did he bully you?

540
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,760
How can you beat him?

541
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,440
He scared my mother with a dead mouse.

542
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,760
When she found out I beat him,

543
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,070
she chased me to beat me.

544
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,710
I want to go home.

545
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:06,800
Who are you?

546
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,800
[Stonemason Li]
You're General Weibei,

547
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,550
the mass murderer.

548
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,630
You set the fire to Qingzhou,
didn't you?

549
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:12,800
The court

550
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,230
has issued a notice.

551
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,880
The fire in Qingzhou had nothing
to do with the Weibei Army.

552
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,760
Nonsense!

553
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,320
- I saw it with my own eyes!
- Your Highness.

554
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,630
- The folks all saw it!
- Your Highness.

555
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,150
- Sir, you're being muddle-headed.
- He set the fire!

556

Come on.

557
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,780
- He's the mass murderer.
- Send him back.

558
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,030
He burned Qingzhou down!

559

Let's go home now.

- Enough.

- He burned Qingzhou down!
- They say bad guys pretended

563
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,360
[Li Jie]
to be the Weibei Army and set the fire.

564
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,630
Alright now. Let's go now.

565
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,190
Your Highness,

566
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,510
please don't blame him.

567
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,550
This old man is muddle-headed.

568
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,190
Officer Li,

569
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,590
I'm now just the governor of Qingzhou.

570
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,150
I'm not Your Highness.

571
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,670
Your Excellency.

572
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,670
Your Excellency, please don't blame him.

573
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,920
That old man is a pitiful man,

574
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,550
a stonemason from Qinglin Lane

575
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,000
who lost his family

576
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,400
in the fire.

577
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,510
He has no way to vent his anger.

578
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,480
His mind

579
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,960
isn't always clear.

580
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,710
Healing the people's hearts

581
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,230
and regaining their trust

582
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,670
will take

583
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,230
quite some effort.

584
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,150
Officer Li.

585
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:33,590
Yes.

586
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,710
I want to build
the Monument of the Masses here

587
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,150
with the names of the deceased engraved.

588
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,030
This land was their home.

589
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,960
Their names must be remembered.

590
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,110
That way,

591
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:44,960
there will be a place

592
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,840
for prayers.

593
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,110
Your Excellency,

594
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,000
I'll make

595
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,070
the arrangements right away.

596
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:20,480
Officer,

597
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,150
come and take a look.

598
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,280
This stone hairpin

599
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,760
is made from a rare ore in Qingzhou.

600
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:29,880
Each one

601
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,510
is unique.

602
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,400
Unique?

603
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:33,960
Yes.

604
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,360
Do you think there's a way

605
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,070
to fix this hairpin?

606
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,960
There's no such thing

607
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,800
as two identical stones in this world.

608
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,590
Even if they're similar,

609
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,440
there's always a difference
in the pattern.

610
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,110
If you can find a similar original stone
for this hairpin,

611
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,800
it's possible to restore it.

612
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,110
However,

613
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,670
in Qingzhou,

614
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,400
there are over a dozen mines.

615
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,150
Finding a match

616
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,710
will take effort.

00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,110
Yes.

632
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,880
We need men to rebuild Qingzhou.

633
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,480
But now Qingzhou is full of

634
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,110
old, weak people, women, and children.

635
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,760
Your Excellency,

636
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,590
after the great fire in Qingzhou,

637
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,670
many young men have gone

638
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,880
to the mountains to become bandits.

639
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:35,840
There is

640
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,280
a shortage of men.

641
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,670
Send a decree:

642
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,630
bandits, except for felons,

643
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,880
can farm

644
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,230
in exchange for amnesty.

645
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,840
All refugees who enter Qingzhou,

646
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,590
whether from Qingzhou or not,

647
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,030
will be resettled
according to military households

648
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,550
and provided
with farming tools and seeds.

649
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,150
Also,

650
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,190
Qingzhou is a border trading city
set up by the court.

651
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,630
All traders in Qingzhou,

652
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,920
whether they're Yan people
or from Xiyan,

653
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,110
will be exempted from 30% of taxes.

654
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,630
Your Excellency is wise.

655
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,800
Once border trade is approved,

656
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,230
Qingzhou's supply shortages

657
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,510
will be solved.

658
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,360
Your Excellency.

659
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,030
Your Excellency,

663
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,190

my dad carried me on his back

676
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,670
to see the lanterns on this street
during the first month.

677
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,880
From this entrance
to the end of the street

678
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,920
was a short distance,

679
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,710
but the walk took him two hours.

680
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,590
That's what Qingzhou was like.

681
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,000
I've heard

682
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,800
there's a new governor in Qingzhou

683
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:21,190
who loves the people, rebuilt homes,

684
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,760
and resettled refugees

685
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,590
instead of rushing to open mines.

00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,440
Border trade is imminent,

00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,030

688
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,030

689
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:30,920
even better than before.

690
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,360
The most important thing for Qingzhou
is soothing the people's hearts.

We'll see the lanterns by then.

00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,840
The walk will take four hours

695
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,880
