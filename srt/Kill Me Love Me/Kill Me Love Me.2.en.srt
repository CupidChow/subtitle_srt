00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,900
A fatal blow in one strike.

193
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,510
No.

194
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,540
That's where the cows'
and sheep's heart and lung are.

195
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,350
How about in humans?

196
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,630
Here?

197
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,580
No. Here?

198
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,350
Or here?

199
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,820
Your Highness,

200
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,060
don't worry.

201
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,390
I can protect myself.

202
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:02,660
Forget it.

203
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,780
If you kill him,

204
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,780
you can't survive.

205
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,510
How about this?

206
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,180
On our way to the capital,

207
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,420
you stay with me.

208
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,700
I am the princess.

209
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,110
I can surely protect you.

210
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,510
Thank you, Your Highness.

211
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,180
You don't have to thank me.

212
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,630
Since it's the Beauty
my third brother is interested in,

213
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,300
[Eastern Palace Garden]
you must investigate her thoroughly.

214
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,940
Don't let him be fooled
by the Xiyan people.

215
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,350
Rest assured, Your Highness.

216
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,580
I've asked someone to investigate her.

217
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,110
The butterfly is not a dirty thing.

218
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,030
Let it fly around here.

219
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,660
This will do for one pot.

220
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,420
Boil water.

221
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,060
Use pine charcoal.

222
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:07,700
Yes.

223
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:23,630
Your Highness,

224
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,270
I have something to report.

225
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,060
You've come just in time.

226
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,030
This is Bamboo Cloud Dragon Tea.
Care to try this with me?

227
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,660
Let's talk while drinking.

228
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:33,990
Your Highness,

229
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,820
[Zhang Yin, Minister of Defense]
I am but a simple warrior.

230
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,870
I don't understand the art of tea.
I'm afraid...

231
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,870
Mr. Zhang,

232
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,780
I don't understand
the art of tea, either.

233
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,820
But I know

234
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,660
only two tins of Cloud Dragon Tea
were produced this year.

235
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,990
His Majesty bestowed

236
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,270
one of them

237
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,510
to His Highness.

238
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,630
Good tea requires good water.

239
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,180
The spring water from Tianshou Mountain
is filtered through bamboo conduits

240
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,940
and then boiled with pine charcoal

241
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,350
before it is used to brew tea.

242
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,350
Pine charcoal, with its gentle
and slow-burning nature,

243
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,910
is what allows the spring water
to be thoroughly heated.

244
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,190
Mr. Zhang,

245
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,190
please wait a moment.

246
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:17,670
Your Highness,

247
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,340
do you know the other tin
of Cloud Dragon Tea

248
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,190
was sent to Prince Jing's Mansion
in Jingbei?

249
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:30,910
Thank you, Your Highness.

250
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,670
Zhang Yin,

251
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,510
you're getting bolder and bolder.

252
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,270
You actually placed a spy
by my father's side.

253
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,710
I wouldn't dare.

254
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,030
The news

255
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,990
comes from my scout in Jingbei.

256
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:00,230
I've told you when you are handling
anything related to Prince Jing,

257
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,230
you must be very cautious.

258
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,270
Sir,

259
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,100
hold it steady and drink.

260
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,300
Your Highness,

261
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,140
I know I was wrong.
I'm willing to accept punishment.

262
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:13,430
I'm just

263
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,510
worried that when Prince Jing
comes back to the capital,

264
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,780
he might re-investigate
the old Qingzhou case.

265
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,910
If he finds some new evidence...

266
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,820
That's why I sent a scout.

267
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,190
Did he find anything?

268
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,380
I don't know.

269
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,510
The scout

270
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,140
was killed by Prince Jing.

271
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,100
So what do you want from me today?

272
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,100
I hope Your Highness
can tell me what to do.

273
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,340
This butterfly was flying just fine.

274
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,950
If it hadn't acted rashly,

275
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,670
it wouldn't have been caught
by the wing.

276
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,230
I don't get it.

277
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,270
Please enlighten me.

278
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,380
My third brother's act
of killing indicates

279
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,140
that he believes the timing is not right

280
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,230
and that he lacks evidence.

281
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,710
If you make a false move,

282
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,340
you may face dire consequences.

283
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,060
Mr. Zhang,

284
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,230
remember that.

285
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,030
I will

286
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,860
keep your instructions in mind,
Your Highness.

287
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,860
Since you are not familiar
with the art of tea,

288
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,990
I shall not insist on your staying.

289
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,950
I'll take my leave.

290
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,750
A hard reputation to live up to.

291
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,910
The Cloud Dragon Tea is nothing special.

292
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,780
A disgraced prince actually

293
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,580
[Wang Quan]
still receives favors.

294
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,510
It seems His Majesty now
is ready to forgive Prince Jing.

295
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,620
My father still favors my third brother.

296
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,910
There can be two tins
of Cloud Dragon Tea.

297
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,300
But there can be
only one Crown Prince in Great Yan.

298
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,710
Your Highness
is the true loong incarnate.

299
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,270
No matter what,

300
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,510
the position of the Crown Prince

301
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,140
cannot possibly go to a prince

302
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,190
who massacred civilians.

303
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,860
[A street in Zhaojing]
I heard the peace-making princess

304
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,510
was Mr. Yue Qin's sister.

305
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,100
Marriage alliance
with the Xiyan princess.

306
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,860
We will enjoy peace from now on.

307
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,710
It seems there will be no more wars.

308
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,860
Mr. Yue Qin's sister
must be very beautiful.

309
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,990
Come here.

310
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,340
The Beauties behind the carriage
are also so beautiful.

311
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,030
Yeah.

312
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,060
I heard the wedding envoy this time
was Prince Jing.

313
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,140
The former General Weibei.

314
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,580
That mass murderer general.

315
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,950
Exactly.

316
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,030
Has His Majesty forgiven him?

317
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,140
The mass murderer is unfit
to be the wedding envoy.

318
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,950
He certainly doesn't deserve it.

319
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,750
A crow perches on a withered tree.

320
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,230
The pale moon at the second watch
shines on decayed bones.

321
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,700
- Troops enter the city by candlelight.
- What's that?

322
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,340
I don't know.

323
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,140
Surveying the land
turned into scorched earth.

324
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,710
A disabled guide leads the way.

325
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:41,380
The people look around anxiously.

326
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,140
Injustice cries out
to the nine heavens for redress.

327
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,780
Summoning 100,000 lost souls
to kill the mass murderer.

328
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,950
A crow perches on a withered tree.

The pale moon at the second watch
shines on decayed bones.

The people look around anxiously.

334
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,470
Injustice cries out
to the nine heavens for redress.

335
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,710
- Summoning 100,000 lost souls to kill.
- The people did not forget the grudge.

336
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,190
How could my father forget it?

337
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,060
Kill the mass murderer!

338
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,340
Avenge the 100,000 wronged souls
of Qingzhou.

339
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,910
Blood for blood!

340
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:40,780
Kill him!

341
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,190
Blood for blood!

342
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:48,340
Kill him!

343
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,940
Who dares to curse again?

344
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,090
- A life for a life!
- Qingyan.

345
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,220
Whoever does it again

346
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,780
will be buried with the Qingzhou people.

347
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,980
[Weibei]

348
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,220
[Weibei]

349
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,410
Enough, don't blow things
out of proportion.

350
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:20,740
Yes.

351
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:24,940
Go.

352
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,370
Be quick.

353
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,540
My lord, they are the ones
who sang the nursery rhyme.

354
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,940
Who taught you

355
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,980
that nursery rhyme?

356
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,410
I

357
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,060
will teach you a more interesting one.

358
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,700
One or two jin of wine
without getting drunk.

359
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,780
Listening to tunes until the third
or fourth watch without feeling tired.

360
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:01,330
Being a ghost and knowing
all the tricks of ghosts.

361
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:06,610
The Ghost General, perfect in every way.

362
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,020
Well?

363
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,370
I'm giving you less than him?

364
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,700
He gave us five sticks
of candy-coated haws.

365
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:27,890
This can buy

366
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:30,370
100 sticks of candy-coated haws.

367
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,170
Go ahead.

368
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,540
Sing the new one loudly.

369
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,700
Let the entire Zhaojing know

370
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,220
I, the Ghost General,

371
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,260
is back.

372
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,260
One or two jin of wine
without getting drunk.

Listening to tunes until the third
or fourth watch without feeling tired.

374
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,940
Being a ghost and knowing
all the tricks of ghosts.

375

The Ghost General, perfect in every way.

376
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,500
The Ghost General?

377
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,980
He'd rather be a ghost than be a man.

378
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,610
The Ghost General, perfect in every way.

379

[Yanming Palace]

380
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:04,780
Thank you, Father.

381
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,130
Jinghe,

382
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,460
I've sent you to Jingbei for ten years.

383
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:16,980
Do you harbor any resentment?

384
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,570
Father.

385
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,540
In the past, I was too eager
for quick success

386
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,090
and committed grave errors,

387
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,940
failing to live up
to your earnest care and protection.

388
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,570
You volunteered to escort
the marriage delegation.

389
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,700
I thought you had come to your senses.

390
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,370
But you scattered paper money
during the wedding procession in Jingbei.

391
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,570
Could it be that you harbored
private resentment

392
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,460
and intended to sabotage
the marriage alliance?

393
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,700
Father,

394
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,980
if I truly intended to sabotage
the marriage alliance,

395
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,810
there would be plenty
of covert means to do so.

396
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,060
Why would I make
such a public spectacle,

397
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,740
giving the censors ammunition

398
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,130
to file complaints against me?

399
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,410
Then you were venting
personal resentment.

400
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,460
I

401
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,890
wouldn't dare disrupt your grand plans.

402
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:08,700
Over these years

403
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,940
of dealing with Xiyan,
I have come to understand

404
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:14,220
that their king
is extremely patient and cunning.

405
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,980
How do we know they aren't using
the marriage alliance

406
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,060
as a chance to recuperate

407
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,170
and regroup?

408
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,740
Therefore, in my view,

409
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,330
we must make a public example of them,

410
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,500
so that Xiyan understands that agreeing

411
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:26,850
to the marriage alliance

412
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,300
is a great favor we are granting them.

413
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,020
If they dare cause trouble again,

414
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,220
there will be no leniency.

415
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,300
I'm very happy that you understand

416
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,060
all this.

417
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,940
Don't make things difficult
for Xiyan people,

418
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,500
especially Princess Zigu.

419
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,700
Her brother is still a hostage
in Great Yan.

420
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:49,170
Do not let this create a rift
between our countries.

421
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:50,940
Otherwise, the marriage alliance

422
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,610
will be meaningless.

423
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:54,130
Yes.

424
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,610
I will follow your instructions.

425

Jinghe,

426
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,060
allowing you to return to the capital

427
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,370
has already invited criticism.

428
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,460
The nursery rhyme
reflects public opinion.

429
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,170
The public opinion is like water.

430
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,610
Water can carry a boat,
but it can also capsize it.

431
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:12,890
I understand.

432
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,780
In the 14th year of the Zhaoming era,

433
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,330
you volunteered to reclaim Qingzhou.

434
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,570
You suffered in Qingzhou

435
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,090
and was unable to see your mother
for the last time.

436
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,170
I know that you harbor regret
and resentment

437

in your heart.

440

your return to the capital this time

441
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,650
is still about the old matters
of Qingzhou, right?

442
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:41,330
Father,

443
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,130
I wouldn't dare.

444
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:45,020
Father, you've said

445
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,570
that the events of Qingzhou

446
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:49,650
should never be spoken of again.

451
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,500
I've never seen these plants in Xiyan.

452
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,650
I just saw someone

453
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:06,890
selling Whitening Pills
at the street corner.

454
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,540
When entering the city yesterday,
Your Highness must be frightened.

455

Upon hearing of this, His Majesty

456
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:22,220
has ordered Imperial Healer Zhang
to prepare a soothing potion for you.

Well...

458
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,700
Do I have to meet His Majesty
in the palace at once?

459

Today is the late Empress'
death anniversary.

460

I'm afraid His Majesty will have no time
to meet Your Highness.

Besides, according to the customs
of Great Yan,

462

should not coincide.

463

Please forgive us.

Given that Your Highness endured
a long and tiring journey,

466
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,260
please first rest
at the Court of State Ceremonial

00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,250
I was wrong.

553
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,290
My mistake was being merciful.

554
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,210
For ten years...

555
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:26,690
For ten years,

556
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,980
I have been regretting my mercy.

557
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,170
Who is it?

558
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:47,460
My lord,

559
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,820
it's a wild cat.

560
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,730
If it's a vengeful wild cat,

561
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,130
it would be troublesome.

562
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:06,170
[Zhang Mansion]

563
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,210
My Lord, look.

564
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,770
Your intention to have these guards
build support for the Crown Prince

565
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:13,940
was well-meaning,

566
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,060
but unexpectedly,

567
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,340
Prince Jing managed

568
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,340
to use it against you.

569
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,570
Shall we report this
to the Eastern Palace?

570
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:24,820
No.

571
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,130
These bodies

572
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,340
do not bear the mark of Zhang Mansion.

573
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:33,570
Prince Jing merely sent a few corpses
to vent his anger,

574
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,730
which proves he can't do much to me.

575
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,690
Why should I

576
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,860
seek trouble with the Crown Prince then?

577
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:45,820
Get rid

578
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,250
of these troubles.

579
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,500
Yes. Hurry up.

580
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,020
Who is it?

581
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:18,940
My lord?

582
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,020
This room is good.

583
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,650
It makes it convenient for me
to sneak in at night.

584
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:28,730
I dare not covet you anymore.

585
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:42,090
You started this game.

586
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:43,650
Now,

587
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,940
it's not your turn to end it.

588
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,650
Sooner or later, I will be your woman.

589
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:55,500
Why don't you wait
until after the alliance banquet?

590
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,290
I can wait,

591
00:41:58,770 --> 00:41:59,820
but I

592
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,290
don't want to.

593
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,650
I see you are wearing little.

594
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,130
I'm afraid you may catch a cold.

595
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,380
So

596
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,210
I'll warm your bed for you.

597
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,380
It's warm.

598
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:57,460
When I was little,

599
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:00,570
I was burnt by fire.

600
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:03,900
I'm afraid of fire,

601
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:07,940
but I'm not afraid of the cold.

602
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:20,290
What about you?

603
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,770
What a coincidence!

604
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,250
The same as you,

605
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,340
I'm afraid of fire.

606
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,170
Wild cats are running around.

607
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,770
It's alright they wake you up.

608
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:51,810
Be careful

609
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:54,020
not to lose your life.

610
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:09,730
Mother,

611
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:11,650
your son, the mass murderer,

612
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:12,980
is back.

613
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:15,770
The Weibei Army has strict discipline

614
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:18,420
and never turns their weapons
on the people.

615
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:22,380
So they incited ignorant civilians
to besiege the military camp

616
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,250
and even broke Prince Jing's legs.

617
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,210
Should those misled civilians
be held accountable

618
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:28,730
and admit their guilt?

619
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,460
[Weibei]

620
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,820
[Weibei]

621
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,810
The noise is different.

622
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:06,060
Master of the Shadow Works.

623
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:57,500
Greetings, Master.

624
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:02,020
You acted on your own

625
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:03,500
and betrayed the Shadow Works.

626
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:06,060
You should meet your end.

627
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,500
The alliance banquet tomorrow

628
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,940
is your last chance.

629
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:36,860
Momai poison is about to take effect.

630
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:38,380
Without the antidote,

631
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:41,690
you will die in three days.

632
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:53,250
Yes,

633
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:55,900
Master.

634
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:34,770
My lord,

635
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,100
is she the wild cat?

636
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:39,540
Even if it's not her,

637
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:42,290
I can't try my luck.

638
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,250
I've been planning for ten years.

639
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:47,420
It's just based

640
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:50,420
on her hatred for the mass murderer.

641
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:54,290
We must win.

642
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,900
Only you have cultivated a killer

643
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:02,900
to kill you yourself.

644
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:06,650
An attempted assassination in the court

645
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,690
will only lead to her execution.

646
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:11,900
Only the orphan of Qingzhou

647
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:15,170
is determined to die with me.

648
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:18,500
After the plan is carried out,

649
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,500
give her a grand burial
according to the custom

650
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:21,690
of Qingzhou.

651
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:33,020
Little beggar,

652
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:35,730
I will

653
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:39,290
avenge you.
