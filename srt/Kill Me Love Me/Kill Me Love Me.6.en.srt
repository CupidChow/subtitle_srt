00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,020
It's her, isn't it?

191
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,500
Brother, don't ignore me!

192
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,070
Brother,

193
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,110
If you don't say anything,

194
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,500
I'll take it as a yes.

195
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,310
This is bamboo brew,

196
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:07,780
made by me myself.

197
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,860
Mei Lin must be the one
in your heart, right?

198
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,020
I added your favorite sour berries.

199
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,260
Want to try?

200
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,230
Brother.

201
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,310
You've been carving the little figure

202
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,540
in the image of Mei Lin, have you?

203
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,990
Someone's shy and needs liquid courage.

204
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,740
Zigu.

205
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,470
Brother,

206
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,430
am I getting a sister-in-law soon?

207
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,230
Do not worry.

208
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,620
I like Mei Lin too.

209
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,140
And you're such a good person.

210
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,540
She'll surely like you.

211
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,260
Zigu,

212
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,830
she's still a peace-making beauty.

213
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:47,830
Oh, right.

214
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,430
You've met again so late.

215
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,470
The timing isn't right.

216
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,540
But don't worry,

217
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,260
I can help you.

218
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:55,620
No.

219
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,140
I have my own plans.

220
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,350
You mustn't interfere.

221
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,830
So, you've been teaching

222
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,380
at the Court of State Ceremonial

223
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,620
to help Mei Lin?

224
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,590
Will you bring her back to Xiyan?

225
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,990
What can I do for you two?

226
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,710
You take care of yourself,
that's enough.

227
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,110
Don't make me worry.

228
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,140
Your Highness,

229
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,990
it's time to return to the palace.

230
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,230
I got it.

231
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,140
Brother,

232
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,310
I'm leaving now.

233
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,350
Your Highness,
are you really determined?

234
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,990
Taking a peace-making beauty
isn't easy,

235
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,310
especially

236
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,380
with Prince Jing now watching her too.

237
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,350
Precisely because of that,

238
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,020
leaving Zhaojing

239
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,350
is her only chance.

240
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,780
You've never discussed politics

241
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,740
with the Yan Emperor,

242
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,380
yet now you break that rule
to save her.

243
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,500
If this draws suspicion,

244
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,110
you might never return to Xiyan.

245
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,470
Your Highness,

246
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,500
if I may speak,

247
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,540
Mei Lin

248
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,540
is not your fated match.

249
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,830
She will always be one of the Great Yan,

250
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,190
and she has great enemies too.

251
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,310
I understand your concerns.

252
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,660
From the beginning,

253
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,020
I've only wanted
to protect those around me.

254
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,590
Now, there's just one more.

255
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,070
That's why we need to act carefully,

256
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,620
without implicating Zigu,

257
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,380
or leaving any trace.

258
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,860
The priority is to prevent Mei Lin

259
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,620
from being assigned,

260
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,110
to keep her
in the Court of State Ceremonial,

261
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,500
so we can take action.

262
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,590
My life is yours.

263
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,380
Whatever you decide,

264
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,990
I will follow.

265
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,990
Whatever you want to do,

266
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,740
I'll do it for you.

267
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,590
Just let me know.

268
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,620
In these years in Zhaojing,

269
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:20,780
thank you.

270
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,020
But,

271
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,780
have you fallen ill?

272
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,310
You look pale.

273
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,380
It's cold.

274
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:35,950
I've just caught a chill.

275
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,500
No need to worry, Your Highness.

276
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,860
Tomorrow,
the beauties will begin their studies,

277
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,430
I'll make sure

278
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,660
Mei Lin is taken care of.

279
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,020
[Court of State Ceremonial]

280
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,740
Beauties,

281
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:53,900
it's time for class.

282
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,620
I am Attendant Shang
from the Imperial Household Department.

283
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,170
Here to teach you proper etiquette.

284
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:13,860
I will only

285
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,500
say the rules once.

286
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,980
If you forget,

287
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,620
you'll be punished with ice water.

288
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,260
Clear your minds,

289
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:23,570
and remember well.

290
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,140
No peony flower?

291
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,980
Did I misremember?

292
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,170
[Prince Jing's Mansion]

293
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:32,620
My lord.

294
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,220
We've searched
the entire Court of State Ceremonial,

295
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,770
but there's no woman
with a peony flower mark.

296
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,290
Did Mei Lin

297
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,410
really see it?

298
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,770
Or was she just seeing things?

299
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,770
You were tasked with finding people,

300
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,500
and this is how you do it?

301
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:23,770
I haven't found her yet.

302
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,290
I have a sneaking suspicion
that there was more to that night,

303
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,380
but I can't quite remember.

304
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,690
So I tried soaking in cold water

305
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,740
to see if I could recall anything else.

306
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,050
Anything, then?

307
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,620
You said that night,

308
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,260
it was General Qingyan who saved me,

309
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,460
but I still can't remember it clearly.

310
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,340
Qingyan checked.

311
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,410
There is no such woman

312
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,810
in the Court of State Ceremonial.

313
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,530
I suspect

314
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,740
you were hallucinating.

315
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:57,860
Hallucinating?

316
00:14:58,810 --> 00:14:59,980
Taking too many Red Coix Seeds

317
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:00,860
can cause hallucinations.

318
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,500
Last night, I saw it with my own eyes.

319
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,050
You were hallucinating.

320
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,100
Do you truly remember nothing?

321
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,140
This concerns
the whereabouts of Zhang Yin.

322
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,100
You must recall.

323
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,650
Then I'll take the Red Coix Seed again,

324
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,500
maybe it will help me remember.

325
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:20,980
No.

326
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,460
Do you think Red Coix Seed

327
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,530
is something
you can just find anywhere?

328
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,930
It's not a good thing.

329
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,890
You are not to take it again.

330
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:44,810
In your hallucination,

331
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:46,860
you mistook my hair

332
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,140
for wildflowers.

333
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,260
Remember?

334
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:06,770
This is where you bit me.

335
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,570
Bite it again.

336
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,530
With this,

337
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:24,890
someone will be there to meet you.

338
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,140
Thank you, Meiniang.

339
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,650
The Formosan gum.

340
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,770
Its resin is slightly bitter,

341
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,050
but it can stop bleeding.

342
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,740
General Weibei was wronged.

343
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,570
He shouldn't die.

344
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,140
The one who should die is you,

345
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,770
the owner of Shadow Works.

346
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,570
Little flower,

347
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:42,810
go home with me.

348
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:44,650
The flower is here.

349
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,690
The Northern Snow Lotus Pill
neutralizes all toxins.

350
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,690
Nanyang Red Coix Seed
neutralizes all toxins.

351
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,460
You don't need to look for it anymore.

352
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,380
I've found the Red Coix Seeds.

353
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:07,980
Well?

354
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,090
I've remembered everything.

355
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,020
I started hallucinating
only after leaving the Wenhua Pavilion.

356
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,770
That woman wasn't a hallucination.

357
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,330
The peony flower isn't a tattoo.

358
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,500
It was painted on.

359
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,700
The woman's neck

360
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,420
must have a noticeable scar.

361
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,330
So she used the peony to hide it.

362
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,530
Keep looking for her.

363
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,370
Red Coix Seed.

364
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,850
You also searched for it?

365
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:17,940
I went through

366
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,980
a lot of trouble
to get you out of the Imperial Prison.

367
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,050
If you were to die so soon,

368
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,740
it would be a waste of my efforts.

369
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,420
If you have important matters,

370
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,850
use this to contact me.

371
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,770
Running off to the Court
of State Ceremonial every day,

372
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,130
what is that about?

373
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:58,660
Father,

374
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,660
I'm bored
staying in the mansion all day.

375
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,940
Going there to admire all the beauties

376
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,530
at least brings me some pleasure.

377
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,940
It's just a beauty, after all.

378
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,330
And this one harbors resentment.

379
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,420
You need to be cautious with her.

380
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,740
Did you

381
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,700
upset Luomei again?

382
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,090
Father, why is that?

383
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,810
She just returned to the capital
after changing duties,

384
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,770
then went straight
to the West Suburbs Barracks.

385
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:26,810
Father,

386
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,330
General Yin is fully devoted
to training troops for Great Yan.

387
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,330
How could I dare interfere?

388
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,370
Speaking of Luomei,

389
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,810
you two were childhood companions.

390
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,530
Greetings, Father.

391
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:43,660
Big Brother.

392
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:44,570
Father,

393
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,180
please find another chess partner.

394
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,220
I'm no match for you.

395
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,370
Your brother has business to attend to.

396
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,220
Have you figured out
what happened at the Wenhua Pavilion?

397
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,260
Yes, Father.

398
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:11,500
It was an accident?

399
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:12,700
Yes, Father.

400
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,500
That night was dry and windy.

401
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,610
The servants at the Wenhua Pavilion
forgot to close the windows,

402
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:17,900
letting the wind
knock over the candle stand.

403
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,940
The pavilion was filled
with flammable artifacts and calligraphy.

404
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,980
By the time the fire was discovered,
it was too late.

405
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,660
What was Zhang Yin doing

406
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,850
at the Wenhua Pavilion so late at night?

407
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,370
Zhou Yu, the Vice-Minister of Rites,
is from the same hometown as him.

408
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,770
The two of them hit it off,

409
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:33,850
plotting to steal the Xiyan tributes.

410
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,850
They had not expected such an accident.

411
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,260
Zhang Yin, driven by greed,
rushed back to retrieve the tributes,

412
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,660
only to be trapped in the flames.

413
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:40,530
All of this

414
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,850
are Zhou Yu's confession.

415
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,460
A second-rank official,

416
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,420
coveting tributes,

417
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,810
risking his life for wealth.

418
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,610
How amusing.

419
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,570
Third Brother is right.

420
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,740
But Zhang Yin has been stationed
in the military camps for years,

421
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,370
with few opportunities to amass wealth.

422
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,050
Returning to the capital
in the Ministry of Defense,

423
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,420
he might have lost his resolve

424
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,220
and given in to temptation.

425
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,370
Crown Prince,

426
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,610
is this the man you promoted?

427
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,260
Father,

428
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,050
I failed to see through his character.

429
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,850
I am willing to accept punishment.

430
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:19,740
Enough.

431
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,460
As if this embarrassment
isn't bad enough?

432
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,610
Zhang Yin and Zhou Yu's affairs,

433
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,130
deal with them as you see fit.

434
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:28,850
Thank you, Father.

435
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,260
Xiyan tributes were destroyed,

436
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,700
and I am responsible.

437
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:38,900
I request to assist Mr. Yue Qin

438
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,090
in organizing the studies
at the Court of State Ceremonial

439
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,570
as a means of making amends.

440
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:46,610
Father,

441
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,500
I would also like to help
at the Court of State Ceremonial.

442
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,180
This isn't something for fun.

443
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,420
Father,

444
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,500
Third Brother is familiar
with the peace-making delegation.

445
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,740
I believe he can be of help.

446
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:00,770
Yeah.

447
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,460
Father,

448
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,020
with Big Brother keeping an eye on me,

449
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,130
what do you have to worry about?

450
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,700
Very well.

451
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,220
Seeing the two of you getting along

452
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,570
brings me great comfort.

453
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,180
I remember
when you first started walking,

454
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,130
you convinced your brother

455
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,370
to sneak into the Imperial Study
and steal my cinnabar ink.

456
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,740
The two of you pressed your handprints

457
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,050
all over the Rong'an Palace,

458
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,610
the walls covered with red.

459
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,130
Father's memory is sharp.

460
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,290
I visited the palace recently,

461
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,980
and the handprints are still there.

462
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,180
Father misses Mother.

463
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,260
The Rong'an Palace

464
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,130
remains just as it was, unchanged.

465
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,770
Now that Jinghe has returned,

466
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,500
you two

467
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,130
should go visit it together.

468
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:40,980
Yes, Father.

469
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,460
[Memorial to Empress Dejia of Great Yan]

470
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:31,810
Mother,

471
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,460
it wasn't me.

472
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,420
I didn't break the embroidery frame.

473
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,770
It wasn't me.

474
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,090
It's been ten years.

475
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:40,900
Mother,

476
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,460
Third Brother finally comes back.

477
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:44,940
I was the one

478
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,220
who accidentally broke the frame.

479
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,420
But who knew, before I could explain,

480
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,770
Mother punished you instead.

481
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,420
Empress Dejia,

482
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,740
feeling pity for me

483
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,220
because my birth mom passed away early,

484
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,570
was always partial to me.

485
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,770
You always said I gave in to you.

486
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,290
With Mother's kindness in my heart,

487
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,530
how could I not yield to you?

488
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,420
If you are so willing to yield,

489
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,460
why not yield the position
of Crown Prince to me?

490
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,570
Third Brother,

491
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,130
don't be too reckless.

492
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,530
What's wrong, Big Brother?

493
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,500
Can't keep up the act anymore?

494
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,290
You're upset and talking nonsense,

495
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,420
so I'll let it go.

496
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:38,940
As long as you're still willing

497
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,020
to call me brother,

498
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,500
I will always be your big brother.

499
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,260
No need to continue this farce
of brotherly affection,

500
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,660
Crown Prince.

501
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,810
I'm tired of playing the role too.

502
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,050
Prince Jing,

503
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,420
what do you have to say?

504
00:24:58,770 --> 00:24:59,900
Now that Zhang Yin is dead,

505
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,260
you've won this round.

506
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:04,900
However,

507
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,260
no one wins forever.

508
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,090
It seems you've returned to the capital

509
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,660
with the sole intention
of seizing the throne.

510
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,660
Seizing? That's a bit too harsh.

511
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,940
Coming from you, Crown Prince,

512
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:17,570
it seems

513
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,050
you're quite familiar with the art.

514
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,900
Pretending to be disabled for ten years,

515
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,700
constantly playing the victim,

516
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,940
your tactics
are no less cunning than mine.

517
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:25,940
But no matter what,

518
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,420
the heir to the throne of Great Yan

519
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,850
will never be a mass murderer like you.

520
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,530
Who's truly the mass murderer?

521
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,940
You and I both know the answer.

522
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,220
Do you know

523
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,020
how Mother died?

524
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,850
When news of the Qingzhou massacre

525
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,290
reached Zhaojing,

526
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,330
Empress Dejia

527
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,660
went to the Yanming Palace,
and begged for forgiveness.

528
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,020
Even on her deathbed,

529
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,500
she was embroidering a screen
to atone for you.

530
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,570
As a woman from a military family,

531
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,130
she lived to protect the empire.

532
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,740
But she gave birth to a son
who slaughtered civilians.

533
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,570
She was deeply ashamed.

534
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,420
She met her end in melancholy

535
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,570
because of you.

536
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,130
A criminal in the eyes
of his own mother.

537
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,050
How do you have the right
to challenge me?

538
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:07,570
A criminal?

539
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,660
Right and wrong

540
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:15,330
aren't defined solely by the victors.

541
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,290
What you've stolen from me,

542
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,530
I will reclaim in full.

543
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,420
In time,

544
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,900
who the real criminal is

545
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,850
will be clear.

546
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:49,810
Your Highness.

547
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,020
Your Highness, bad news.

548
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,460
What?

549
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,530
A woman fled
from the Wenhua Pavilion that night.

550
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,940
We tracked her to the Court
of State Ceremonial, but she vanished.

551
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,020
She bears the marks
of Xiyan martial arts.

552
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,290
Why wasn't this reported sooner?

553
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,130
It's my fault
for not disciplining the men.

554
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,740
They feared punishment

555
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,330
and thought they could cover it up.

556
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,130
What happened is happened.

557
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,220
Even if you wipe it off now,

558
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,460
everyone has already noticed it.

559
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:26,770
I'm willing to accept my punishment.

560
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:30,090
Enough, get up.

561
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:34,570
Thank you, Your Highness.

562
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,900
That woman is the witness
to the Wenhua Pavilion fire.

563
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,810
Find her,
and leave no evidence behind.

564
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,850
That woman was wounded

565
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,370
by a fire arrow on her wrist.

566
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,740
It won't be difficult to locate her.

567
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,980
But if she's a Xiyan beauty...

568
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,770
No matter who she is.

569
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,700
If anyone inquires

570
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,260
about the Wenhua Pavilion,

571
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,330
those involved
won't need their heads anymore.

572
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,180
Let Attendant Shang

573
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,700
handle this.

574
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:58,260
Yes, Your Highness.

575
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,260
Wait.

576
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,260
The nights have been getting colder.

577
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,810
I've got a new silver fox fur cloak.

578
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,530
You want to send it to General Yin
at the West Suburbs Barracks?

579
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,460
Deliver it yourself.

580
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:24,570
Understood.

581
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,180
I'll take care of it immediately.

582
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,130
Embroidery is so difficult.

583
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,050
Indeed,

584
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,420
holding a needle is harder
than holding a sword.

585
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,530
Time for class.

586
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,290
Let's go.

587
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:50,610
Go.

588
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,740
Still no sign of anyone with the scar.

589
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,420
Embroidery

590
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,060
is a skill all women of Great Yan
must learn.

591
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,130
Our Empress Dejia

592
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,410
[Attendant Shang]
was a renowned master of needlework.

593
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,330
This embroidery, "Instruct the Young,"

594
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,460
is one of her final works
before she passed.

595
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:14,370
The Ministry of Rites

596
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,650
placed this
in the Court of State Ceremonial,

597
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,500
so everyone could study it closely,

598
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,810
to follow the Empress's example

599
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,860
and strive for perfection
in all things.

600
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,270
Surrender!

601
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:29,860
[Empress Dejia]

602
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,910
- Surrender.
- Jinghe.

603
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,140
[Young Jinghe]
Don't.

604
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,780
A general of Great Yan

605
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,820
only wields his sword to slay enemies.

606
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:48,540
Never to harm his family or friends.

607
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,380
Nor should he hurt innocent civilians.

608
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,100
Remember that.

609
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,620
Beauties, take a good look at this.

610
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,510
"Instruct the Young"?

611
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,780
Who was she instructing?

612
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,060
Empress Dejia was Prince Jing's mother.

613
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,820
It's about the Qingzhou massacre.

614
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,430
They say the Empress died
from the shame of it.

615
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,910
Do not point blades at the people.

616
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,860
These were your teachings, Mother.

617
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:38,910
But why,

618
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,030
even until your death,
did you refuse to trust me?

619
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,750
You still begged for me.

620
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,580
You admitted fault on my behalf.

621
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,340
[Changxi Pavilion]

622
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:24,910
Mother,

623
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,860
why didn't you believe in me?

624
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:40,620
Come inside.

625
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:52,820
I made it,

626
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:53,710
like you said,

627
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,620
with added licorice root.

628
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:55,950
Dengguo Cakes?

629
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,270
You're from Qingzhou, aren't you?

630
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:00,510
I...

631
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:01,910
I'm right.

632
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,300
Do not worry.

633
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,620
I won't tell anyone.

634
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,340
These past few days,

635
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,620
I've noticed
that you've been looking troubled.

636
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,510
Are you homesick?

637
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,860
Here's a taste of home.

638
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,510
Try it.

639
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:25,860
Is it sour?

640
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:28,990
No, not at all.

641
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,300
How can you stomach something so bitter?

642
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:39,860
Bitter?

643
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,670
Did you grind the roots and stems

644
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,190
along with the leaves?

645
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:47,910
I'm so foolish.

646
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,540
I should've asked you first.

647
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,190
Don't eat it anymore.

648
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:51,990
Give it to me,

649
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,380
and I'll make a new batch tomorrow.

650
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,230
It's not bitter.

651
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,100
It is bitter.

652
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:55,990
Stop eating it.

653
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:56,860
Give it to me.

654
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,710
What happened to your waist?

655
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:04,990
It's nothing.

656
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,540
I burned it
while making the Dengguo cakes.

657
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,980
I've already applied medicine.

658
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,770
It looks serious.

659
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,290
It's not serious.

660
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,610
Don't eat the bitter cake.

661
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,650
I like it.

662
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,340
It's not bitter.

663
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,730
Your voice sounds off.

664
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,460
What's wrong with your throat?

665
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:37,820
Maybe

666
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,460
I caught a cold.

667
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,090
Really?

668
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:43,860
Actually,

669
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,980
it's from taking this.

670
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,860
[Whitening Pill]
This pill is meant to whiten the skin.

671
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,420
But for two hours after taking it,

672
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,140
my voice becomes thin.

673
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,140
Men prefer fair skin.

674
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,510
Last year,

675
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,100
my father found me a match,

676
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:10,910
but the man thought I was too dark.

677
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,390
My father was so angry

678
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,350
that he broke off the engagement.

679
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:14,790
Actually,

680
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,790
I should have held it back.

681
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,470
Father said,

682
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,060
if we'd given him a few more cows,

683
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,470
I wouldn't have had to
come to Great Yan for this marriage.

684
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,260
Don't listen to them.

685
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,260
I think...

686
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,140
you look better with darker skin.

687
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:30,620
I look better with fairer skin.

688
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,740
No, your darker skin is beautiful.

689
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:34,540
Oh,

690
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,580
I've been taking these pills
for days now.

691
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,390
Look.

692
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,740
Do you think I've become fairer?

693
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,220
Yes.

694
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:41,830
Really?

695
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:42,580
Really.

696
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,620
This pill works,
so you should take it too.

697
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,140
Forget it.

698
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,660
You are already fair enough.

699
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,180
No need to take it.

700

But I also want to be fairer.

701
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,140
Take the whole bottle.

from now on,

708
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,690
don't eat anything dark.

709
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,730
Eating dark foods will make you darker.

710
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,610
Eating dark foods will make me darker?

[Prince Jing's Mansion]

712
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,500
My lord,

00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,500
these are the Whitening Pills
from Mei Lin.

714
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,250
Eat it.

715
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:47,340
I'm not...

716
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,420
I'm not dark.

717
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,090
Mei Lin said that after taking these,

718
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,380
your voice will become thin.

719
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,460
I want to know

720
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,940
just how thin it will get.

Well,

will my voice return to normal?

If not,

724
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,870

that mutes you forever.

This is right.

was actually a man in disguise.

732
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,100
That peony flower must've been painted

Relax.

I've uncovered something.

The Attendant Shang you saw before

742
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,740
does indeed have connections
to the Eastern Palace.

Our men followed her for several days

744
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,140
and discovered that she's been
using her embroidery lessons

745
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,910
as a cover to search for a woman
with an injured wrist.

746
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:56,990
It seems

747
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,430

is also hunting for her.

748
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,740
But now we know

749
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,430
the injured one is actually a man.

750
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,830
We've gained the upper hand.

751
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,060
Rest assured, my lord.

752
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,950
I'll send people
to search the Court of State Ceremonial.

753
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,060
Since they are looking

754
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,700
for women with wrist injuries,

755
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,140
let's send them

756
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,470
a few more candidates.

757
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,060
Are you okay?

758
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,470
Dai overslept again.

759
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,700
Attendant Shang will surely scold her.

760
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:07,540
Indeed,

761
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,060
we should go wake her.

762
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,100
Dai, wake up.

763
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,730
If you're late,
the attendant will mark you down,

764
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,500
and you won't find a good match.

765
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,030
She's close with Mei Lin.

766
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,990
Maybe the two of them

767
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,580
already planned
to serve Prince Jing together.

768
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:27,390
Dai,

769
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,300
wake up.

770
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:29,830
Dai?

771
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,620
Dai?

772
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,430
Dai?

773
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,700
[Yayun Pavilion]
What's going on?

774
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:54,990
Sir.

775
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:57,740
Mei Lin.

776
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,030
The coroner has arrived.

777
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:25,430
Sir,

778
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,470
this is the Golden Monkey Mushroom,

779
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,740
named for its blackish-gold color.

780
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,660
It mostly grows in Great Yan,

781
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,740
rarely in Xiyan.

782
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,830
This young lady consumed it,

783
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,700
causing her to die of poisoning.

784
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:45,740
Why were poisonous mushrooms found

785
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,430
in the Court of State Ceremonial?

786
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,470
We'd never purchase poisonous items.

787
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,990
It's been raining for several days,

788
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,620
and damp places are prone
to growing Golden Monkey Mushrooms.

789
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:58,740
It could be the servants were negligent,

790
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:01,180
failing to clear them out in time.

791
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,350
That's how

792
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:06,220
Dai must have mistakenly eaten one.

793
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:19,990
Dai died from ingesting
a poisonous mushroom.

794
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,180
There are no assassins
in the Court of State Ceremonial.

795
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:24,780
Remember,

796
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:27,430
from now on, don't eat anything dark.

797
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,260
Eating dark foods will make you darker.

798
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,990
Dai would never have eaten
something like that.

799
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,470
Send the words.

800
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,070
Remove all Golden Monkey Mushrooms

801
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,580
from the Court of State Ceremonial.

802
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:41,470
As for Dai,

803
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:42,510
give her a proper burial.

804
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,350
Yes.

805
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:14,510
I will find the one

806
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:16,740
who killed you.

807
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,510
Why did you poison Dai?

808
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,620
Please, don't kill me.

809
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:39,990
Dai, she...

810
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,910
she poisoned herself
by eating those mushrooms.

811
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:43,580
Tell me the truth,

812
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,180
or I'll make you
eat all the mushrooms yourself.

813
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,070
No, please.

814
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:47,550
Fine.

815
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,470
I'll talk.

816
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,100
They,

817
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,660
they told me to find a woman

818
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,070
who left the Court of State Ceremonial
on the night of the eighth.

819
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,510
The woman had a burn on her waist.

820
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,180
I found Dai,

821
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,030
but they said I had the wrong person.

822
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,950
Yet Dai clearly had a burn on her waist.

823
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,870
Then they told me to keep searching.

824
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:01,550
"They"?

825
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,180
Who are "they"?

826
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:03,830
I...

827
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,660
I really don't know.

828
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,780
Who are you?

829
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,990
Don't eat the bitter cake.

830
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:36,830
I'll make a new batch tomorrow.

831
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:39,910
I made it,

832
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,830
like you said, with added licorice root.

833
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:44,990
Are you homesick?

834
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:46,870
Here's a taste of home.

835
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:47,950
Try it.

836
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,350
What's happening?

837
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:39,950
My lord,

838
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:43,780
a Xiyan beauty died today.

839
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:46,780
She had a burn on her right wrist.

840
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,300
She was mistakenly killed
by Attendant Shang.

841
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,430
Is Attendant Shang
searching for the same person as us?

842
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:00,070
Yes.

843
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,830
Who's behind her?

844
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:03,700
Is this connected
to the Qingzhou massacre?

845
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:09,030
We need to find Zhang Yin,

846
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:10,390
only then,

847
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:12,390
will the truth be revealed.

848
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,580
Since they know
they killed the wrong person,

849
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:17,180
they will keep searching.

850
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,550
And if they can't find her,

851
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:22,030
they'll kill more innocents.

852
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:24,620
Then let them kill me.

853
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:30,780
I will be the bait.

854
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,100
I'll make them believe

855
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,180
I am the woman
who fled the Wenhua Pavilion.

856
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:47,390
I can't bear to see another Dai

857
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,620
die in front of me.

858
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,510
You've been to the Wenhua Pavilion.

859
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:56,470
You are indeed the perfect bait.
