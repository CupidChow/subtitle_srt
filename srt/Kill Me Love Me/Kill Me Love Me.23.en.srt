00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,920
Don't go.

191
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,310
Mei Lin.

192
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:13,720
My lord,

193
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,160
you finally woke up.

194
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,200
Great!

195
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,590
My lord.

196
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,270
Did she come?

197
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,480
She? I've been in the courtyard

198
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,030
and saw no visitors.

199
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,350
- She came.
- You must be blessed.

200
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,480
Surely it's the luck
of the repaired wedding robe

201
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,680
- from Mei Lin.
- She came.

202
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,550
Wedding robe?

203
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,680
The wedding robe embroidered
by the Empress

204
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,030
had missed stitches, an ominous sign.

205
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,440
When Miss Mei Lin saw it,

206
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,680
I explained the situation.

207
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,640
Later, I learned

208
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,680
she quietly fixed the stitches for you.

209
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,440
It's easier to hold a knife.

210
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,480
It's done.

211
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,240
Gods bless us.

212
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,790
We must win.

213
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,790
After we succeed,

214
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,160
I'll give you this wedding robe
personally.

215
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,270
I never expected that after all this,

216
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,510
you would end up marrying my brother.

217
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,590
Now, I finally understand

218
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,030
it's so hard to spend

219
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
a lifetime together.

220
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,480
Imperfection

221
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,440
is a common part of life.

222
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,110
Are you still in love with Prince Jing?

223
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,440
All debts

224
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,790
and grievances between us are settled.

225
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,160
I once thought fate was unfair,

226
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,200
but it treats everyone the same.

227
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,830
My brother is right.

228
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,270
Do your best and leave the rest to fate.

229
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,480
Mei Lin,

230
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,590
my brother protected you

231
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,510
as the Princess Heir

232
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,350
to repay his debt for saving his life.

233
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,550
But my father believes you are a goddess

234
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,110
and trusts the Sun and Moon Kunluns.

235
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,550
You must return to Xiyan

236
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,640
before the deity's birthday.

237
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,270
Otherwise, my brother's position
as Prince Heir

238
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,110
and your life will be in danger.

239
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,440
In order to save me,

240
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,310
His Highness staked his own future.

241
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,200
Your Highness,

242
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,270
the Prince Heir is here.

243
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,110
Qin.

244
00:22:59,070 --> 00:22:59,550
Mei Lin,

245
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,200
for this trip back to Xiyan,

246
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,400
I won't trap you with
the Princess Heir identity.

247
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,790
I will do everything I can
to grant you freedom,

248
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,640
but until then,

249
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,110
I can only ask you to endure

250
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,790
and play the role of my Princess Heir.

251
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,240
I will try my best

252
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,720
to repay your favor.

253
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,000
Your Highness,

254
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,750
Eunuch Wang is still waiting outside.

255
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:20,960
The auspicious hour is approaching.

256
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,110
The Prince Heir and the Princess Heir
should be leaving.

257
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:31,790
Let's go.

258
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,240
We're leaving.

259
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,830
Qin, Mei Lin.

260
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,480
Qin,

261
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,270
when Mei Lin is in Xiyan,
you are her only friend.

262
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,920
Don't bully her.

263
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,270
I promise you.

264
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,240
Mei Lin,

265
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,550
my brother lacks martial skills.

266
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,880
You can't bully him, either.

267
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,000
Okay, I promise you.

268
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,350
Your Highness.

269
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,070
Well,

270
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,750
you can go now.

271
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,030
Qin, Mei Lin.

272
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:03,920
Well,

273
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,880
there's no bamboo brew
left in Fanghua Palace.

274
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,790
I'll brew it for you
when I return to Xiyan.

275
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,680
You have to brew a lot.

276
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,510
Mei Lin also loves it.

277
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,750
I'll help him brew it.

278
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,480
Hurry and go.

279
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,680
Have a safe journey.

280
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,480
We're leaving.

281
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,720
Qin, Mei Lin.

282
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,000
Will we...?

283
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,720
Will we meet again in this lifetime?

284
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:57,830
Of course.

285
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,960
Once we are free,
we'll come to Zhaojing.

286
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,270
We'll definitely meet again.

287
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,720
Well...

288
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,000
Well,

289
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,830
go now.

290
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,590
Don't keep His Majesty waiting

291
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,590
or miss the auspicious hour.

292
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:47,590
We're leaving.

293
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,550
We're leaving.

294

[Taichi Palace]

295
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,790
Among my subjects is a young woman
from Qingzhou named Mei Lin,

296
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,000
who has rendered meritorious service

297
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,440
and demonstrated loyalty and obedience.

298
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,640
She is hereby bestowed
the title of Princess Zongshuo,

299
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,590
granted a dowry of 100 palanquins,

300
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,960
and honored as a princess
in a peace-making marriage,

301
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,790
signifying the friendly relations
between our nations,

302
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,510
to take place
with the Prince Heir of Xiyan.

303
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,200
Let those in charge
carry out these orders.

304
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,440
I saved the throne

305
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,590
not for reward,

306
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,720
but to seek the truth
behind the Qingzhou case.

307
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,920
The case of Qingzhou is now

308
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,160
being re-examined
by the three ministries.

309
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,480
An accounting will be given to Qingzhou.

310
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,510
You have shown great righteousness,

311
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,070
and I am deeply comforted by this.

312
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,400
From now on,

313
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,270
the royal family of Great Yan
will be your family.

314
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,680
I trust you will, like Concubine Yan,

315
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:40,440
promote peace between our nations.

316
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,480
Your Highness,

317
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,070
these are the documents

318
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,200
for establishing border trade
in Qingzhou by Great Yan.

319
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,200
As this benefits both nations,

320
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:05,750
Great Yan is willing
to partner with Xiyan.

321
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,680
Upon returning to Xiyan
with the Princess Heir,

322
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,750
I will discuss border trade
with my father

323
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,200
and send envoys

in Prince Xian's mansion, Li Qing,

374
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,720
and former Mozhou sheriff Zhang Yin
to seize power.

375
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,350
In the 15th year of the Zhaoming era,
they set fire to Qingzhou

376
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,960
and framed the Weibei Army,

377
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,960
leading to the annihilation
of a righteous army,

378
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,830
countless civilian deaths,

379
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,960
and great hardships for survivors.

380
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,110
They are eternal sinners of Great Yan,

381
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,590
guilty and deserving of execution.

382
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,790
I decree that all authorities
bestow a mausoleum

383
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,960
and inscribe a stele for the Weibei Army

384
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,240
to comfort the loyal spirits.

385
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:19,720
Qingzhou shall be exempt from taxes
for three years to mourn the deceased.

386
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,510
Let those in charge
carry out these orders.

387
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,590
Your Majesty is wise.

388
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:27,350
Prince Jing maintained
private armed forces,

389
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,790
which should be punished.

390
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,310
However, his meritorious service
in saving the throne

391
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,960
cancels his merits and demerits.

392
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,440
Thank you, Father.

393
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,200
Yin Luomei

394
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,790
allowed a criminal
to harm a loyal minister.

395
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:49,310
Given your repentance and service,

396
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,790
the death penalty is waived.

397
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,030
You are stripped

398
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,160
of your command of the Pingnan Army

399
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,070
and demoted to registrar in Mozhou.

400
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,750
You cannot return to Zhaojing
without an imperial edict.

401
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,070
Thank you, Your Majesty.

402
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,760
I have held the ancestral legacy
for 35 years

403
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,590
and strived diligently.

404
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,030
Yet, I failed to raise my sons

405
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,880
and trusted the wrong people.

406
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:27,000
The disaster in Qingzhou
was also my fault.

407
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,440
I will issue a decree of self-reproach

408
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:30,760
to remind myself of my duty

409
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,320
to nurture the people

410
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,630
and ensure the realm's peace.

411
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,510
Great, we finally won a battle.

412
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,440
Happy, huh?

413
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,630
[Taichi Palace]
I'm overjoyed.

414
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:05,800
I'll tell you something.

415
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,880
My wife sent me a letter,

416
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,760
saying my son can walk now.

417
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,280
Congratulations.

418
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,230
Can you ask your wife

419
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,590
to introduce me a wife?

420
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,670
Sure.

421
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,150
My wife happens to have
a younger sister.

422
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,510
I'll talk to her when I'm back.

423
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,630
Really?

424
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:19,960
That's good.

425
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,230
Our relationship will be even closer.

426
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,550
Mr. Yang,

427
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,840
you stay in the camp every year.

428
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,230
Now, the war is over.

429
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,800
You can finally go home.

430
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,670
I'm from Qingzhou.

431
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,230
When Qingzhou is reclaimed, I'm home.

432
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:34,840
That's true.

433
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,230
The general vowed, "No homecoming
until Xiyan is defeated."

434
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,760
I told my mother

435
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,630
it would take at least ten years,

436
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,280
so I didn't expect to return so soon.

437
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,920
We'll be home soon.

438
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:43,800
When you are home,

439
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,960
your mother will no longer have to

440
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,030
wait for you at the door.

441
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:46,880
You are right.

442
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:54,960
General.

443
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,670
Weibei Army, report for duty!

444
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,920
Murong Jinghe,

445
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,360
report for duty!

446
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,030
I've imagined countless times

447
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,360
how you look in a wedding robe.

448
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,150
But I never expected
I would be in such a state.

449
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,510
I thought

450
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,670
you didn't want to see me again.

451
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,920
Marrying Your Highness

452
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,030
is my wish.

453
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,400
With your words,

454
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,840
I would be happy even if I went to hell.

455
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,920
I have rarely known

456
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,670
true freedom and happiness.

457
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,960
All my beautiful memories

458
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,110
are of you.

459
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:46,630
Even now,

460
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:47,920
I still recall

461
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,360
every detail of our first meeting.

462
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,150
That year, you were eight.

463
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,400
You stood up for me
against the young masters

464
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,550
of the Marquis's Mansion,

465
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,440
saying

466
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,800
you wouldn't tolerate bullying.

467
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:10,030
Thinking back, that was my first fight,

468
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,030
and it was exhilarating.

469
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,000
Later, I learned

470
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,670
that the eight-year-old girl

471
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,280
was the general's daughter.

472
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,480
Each time you visited the Noble Consort,

473
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,710
I found excuses to go to Fengyi Palace.

474
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:26,880
Eventually,

475
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,320
the Noble Consort noticed,

476
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,360
and I had to

477
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,030
use Jinghe as an excuse.

478
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,480
Now, I think about it...

479
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,150
You liked me that early?

480
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,400
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

481
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,070
I didn't dare.

482
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:49,710
Do you know?

483
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,110
For every time I looked at you,

484
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,630
you looked at Jinghe just as often.

485
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,360
Even if I had confessed,

486
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,880
you would only choose him.

487
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,670
But if you

488
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,320
had told me earlier,

489
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,440
the outcome might have been different.

490
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,800
Would it?

491
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,360
Yes.

492
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,800
But if you chose me,

493
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,030
I wouldn't dare

494
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,440
risk losing you.

495
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,510
To die by your hand

496
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,550
would complete my life.

497
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,190
As General Yin, I offered you
the poisonous wine.

498
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:47,880
As Luomei,

499
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,480
I wish to drink cross-cup wine with you.
