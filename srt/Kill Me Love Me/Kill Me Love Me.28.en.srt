00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,000
Mei,

380
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,590
if you lied,

381
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,350
I'll throw you into the woods in Xiyan

382
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,310
and feed you to the bears.

383
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,440
Here.

384
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,510
God bless

385
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,590
Mei.

386
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,110
She must wake up.

387
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:32,960
Mei.

388
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:35,440
Come on.

389
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,830
Yi.

390
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,110
Yi,

391
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,270
Mei is awake.

392
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,270
Mei is awake.

393
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,270
Mei,

394
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,830
how do you feel?

395
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:57,830
Mei.

396
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,640
Mei, I was so scared.

397
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,110
Mei, you finally woke up.

398
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,070
Jia.

399
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,030
Yi.

400
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,110
Mei,

401
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,110
Yi told me everything.

402
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,160
You suffered so much.

403
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,000
You should have told me sooner.

404
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,960
It's good

405
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,480
to be alive

406
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,480
and see you.

407
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,680
I already died once.

408
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,790
I'm grateful

409
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,920
to be alive now.

410
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,920
The poison in me...

411
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:58,920
Mei,

412
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,640
the poison can be neutralized.

413
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,160
Yes.

414
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,160
The hunters said

415
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,790
Snow Dragon Whisker lives with the snow.

416
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,310
In four months,

417
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,790
during the big snowstorm

418
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:08,750
in the mountains,

419
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,400
we will find a new Snow Dragon Whisker

420
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,070
to save your life.

421
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,030
Those hunters also said

422
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,070
the first snowfall in past years

423
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,350
was at this time of year.

424
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,030
You will stay here for more days.

425
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,880
Don't worry, everything's taken care of.

426
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,350
No one will find you here.

427
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,160
Oh, right.

428
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,550
You said you wanted
to learn business from me.

429
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,550
I've already

430
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,880
found a store near the fragrance shop

431
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,270
for you to open a cake shop.

432
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,920
There's no rush.

433
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,790
You need to recover first.

434
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,680
You can't be a shopkeeper

435
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,880
without good health like mine.

436
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,510
Alright now.

437
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,000
Stop talking.

438
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,440
Let Mei get some rest.

439
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,350
Let's go make porridge for her.

440
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,680
Mei, take a good rest.

441
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,160
We will make you some porridge.

442
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:51,960
Okay now. Let's go.

443
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,110
Let's go.

444
00:31:59,110 --> 00:31:59,880
Jia,

445
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,240
Yi,

446
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,680
I probably won't

447
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,440
be able to wait four months
for the big snow.

448
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,260
[To days later]

449
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,350
I need this.

450
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,350
And another one with meat.

451
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,750
Miss, you have great taste.

452
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,000
It smells great.

453
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,880
Here. Take this.

454
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,590
Sugarcoated haws.

455
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,920
Sweet sugarcoated haws.

456
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,070
Sugarcoated haws.

457
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,550
Sugarcoated haws.

458
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,030
Freshly baked fruit cakes.

459
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,590
Take a look at the sugarcoated haws.

460
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,680
Come and take a look.

461
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,830
Check this out.

462
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,160
Take a look
at the freshly baked fruit cakes.

463
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,510
Miss.

464
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,590
Sugarcoated haws.

465
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,480
Jiahe Cake Shop is open today.

466
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,070
Welcome to buy more cakes at my store.

467
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,160
Sugarcoated haws.

468
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,510
Here.

469
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,640
The freshly baked cakes are delicious.

470
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,240
Thank you.

471
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,240
You're welcome.

472
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,510
Today, the old houses
on Qinglin Lane are repaired.

473
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:08,510
It'll be much warmer in winter.

474
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,790
Qingzhou is returning to the way it was.

475
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,110
Let's drink to that.

476
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,830
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

477
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,310
I'm telling you,

478
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,440
no cheating.

479
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,750
- Bottoms up.
- Okay. Bottoms up.

480
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,400
Bottoms up.

481
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,110
Father,

482
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,400
mother,

483
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,960
the wine at the liquor store
smells good.

484
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,240
The fruit cakes are sweet.

485
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,750
Mr. Li and the others are doing well.

486
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,880
Qingzhou

487
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,270
has finally returned to
how it was before the fire.

488
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:40,720
Hurry up.

489
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,480
The Lancang River spectacle
has appeared in Qingzhou.

490
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,640
It's a once-in-a-century.

491
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,270
- Hurry up, or it will be too late.
- Hurry up.

492
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:45,590
Hurry!

493
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,590
Wait for me.

494
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,480
I need to get my stuff.

495
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,200
It's just ahead.

496
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,310
Lancang River.

497
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,030
Look at that.

498
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,440
That's so beautiful.

499
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,590
Yes, it's beautiful. Look at that.

500
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,280
It's the governor.

501
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,280
Your Excellency?

502
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,710
The governor looks so strange.

503
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,510
Why is he wearing a wedding dress?

504
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,280
It's so beautiful. Let's make a wish.

505
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:29,960
It's beautiful.

506
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,230
It's so beautiful.

507
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,110
Where did they come from?

508
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,000
Do you know?

509
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,550
I don't know.

510
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,510
Lan'er, look.

511
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,000
These little things

512
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,150
swam hundreds of lis
along the warm currents

513
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,590
of the Lancang River

514
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,920
before arriving in Qingzhou.

515
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,880
Lan'er, watch carefully.

516
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,480
They'll only be here

517
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,550
for three months.

518
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,800
What will happen after?

519
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,440
It took them two months to swim
to Qingzhou.

520
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,230
The summer in Qingzhou
is especially short.

521
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:16,400
They can't survive when it's cold.

522
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,030
Look.

523
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,070
Aren't they amazing?

524
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,760
Lan'er, you must be persistent

525
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,030
like them.

526
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,480
Three months.

527
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,760
They know they're nearing

528
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,670
the end of their lives,

529
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,360
but they run toward the brief summer.

530
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,190
Is it worth it?

531
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,670
The warmer it is,

532
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,070
the brighter the mayfly light.

533
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,400
They shine freely
to their hearts' content,

534
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,800
brighter than the stars in the sky.

535
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,760
Even if they're short-lived,

536
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,030
it's worth it.

That man came to see you
at the fragrance shop.

558
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,360
Luckily, you were out.

559
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,670
He should have accepted the truth.

560
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,190
However,

561
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,880
are you really not going to see him?

562
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,360
Mei Lin has been buried.

563
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,440
I have a new name,

564
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,550
which is

565
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,800
Spring

566
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:29,630
Flower,

567
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,550
Miss Hua.

568
