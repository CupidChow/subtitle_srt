00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,270
We can't let you spread it!

192
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,320
Exactly! You can't leave!

193
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,360
Listen to me.

194
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,870
My sister and I aren't infected.

195
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,080
Wei and the villagers

196
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,480
got sick from the mountain stream water.

197
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,600
I know how to cure them.

198
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,550
Are you

199
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,910
a physician?

200
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,360
My sister and I caught the same illness

201
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,630
while we were fleeing.

202
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,200
A traveling physician saved us

203
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,960
with Thunder Duke Vine.

204
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,030
I'm sure

205
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,960
it can save them too.

206
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Can Thunder Duke Vine work?

207
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,440
Why...

208
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,670
Why should we believe you?

209
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,750
I can go up the mountain
to gather the herbs.

210
00:09:59,150 --> 00:09:59,960
I'll go with you.

211
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,910
Let your sister go.

212
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,960
You're too weak.

213
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,720
Stay here as a hostage.

214
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:04,960
I'll go with them.

215
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,320
Let's go.

216
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:07,960
Alright, this way.

217
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,750
- Come on.
- Let's go gather the herbs.

218
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,080
Let's go.

219
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:16,100
[West Suburbs Barracks]

220
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,320
Luomei,

221
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,150
remember,

222
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,440
protect the nation.

223
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And keep Great Yan safe!

224
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,270
Your Highness.

225
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,360
General Yin,

226
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,870
I'll practice with you.

227
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,150
I've lost.

228
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,550
If we were on the battlefield,

229
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,320
my dagger slipping

230
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,550
would have meant death by your sword.

231
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,440
Longer weapons have the advantage.

232
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,150
I fought your short dagger
with my long sword.

233
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,200
My victory has no honor.

234
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,150
A defeat is a defeat.

235
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,360
Everything is already decided.

236
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,870
Indeed.

237
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,440
Everything is already decided.

238
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:12,870
Luomei,

239
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,790
these past years,

240
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,790
Jinghe didn't have it easy.

241
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,960
He wanted

242
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,320
to be buried in Qingzhou
with the Weibei Army.

243
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,630
Perhaps this way

244
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,320
is a release for him.

245
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,080
I'm just sad

246
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,750
Prince Jing didn't die
on the battlefield.

247
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:39,910
Forget it.

248
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,750
Let this dagger

249
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,510
be buried with him.

250
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,120
That dagger

251
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,240
was actually a gift from me.

252
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,030
It pairs

253
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,790
with this one.

254
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,360
When we were younger,

255
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,600
I knew of your feelings for him
and didn't dare compete,

256
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,600
so I

257
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,960
gave it to you through him.

258
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,320
I never thought I'd get to say this

259
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,440
or

260
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,510
that these two daggers would reunite.

261
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,720
Luomei,

262
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,440
in fact,

263
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,030
it's not just Jinghe

264
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,750
who can fight by your side. I can too.

265
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,080
I can stand with you
through life and death.

266
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,240
Will you

267
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,320
keep this dagger for my sake?

268
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,270
I've already decided

269
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,790
to bury it with Prince Jing.

270
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,480
Though it was a gift from Your Highness,

271
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,150
it holds

272
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,270
many memories of my time with him.

273
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,670
Let it carry those memories

274
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,270
and be buried with him.

275
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,480
I hope Prince Jing

276
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,480
can once again be
a great general in his next life.

277
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,360
Strike the drums for the general,

278
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,000
and send his heroic soul off to battle!

279
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,150
Luomei,

280
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,320
I hope this is the last time

281
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,080
you grieve for him.

282
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,840
Farewell, General!

283
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,790
Farewell, General!

284
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,120
Why aren't they back yet?

285
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,510
They've been gone too long.

286
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,390
Is that them over there?

287
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,790
Why aren't they back yet?

288
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,360
I don't know.

289
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,550
It really is them!

290
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,200
They're back!

291
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,080
They're back!

292
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,120
We found it.

293
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,240
Here.

294
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,550
Boil the Thunder Duke Vine

295
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:48,510
with this medicine.

296
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,600
It'll work faster.

297
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,440
Come on. Let's get to it.

298
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,150
- Right.
- Let's go.

299
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,750
That's his sleeping powder.

300
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,790
It really worked!

301
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,030
- Thank you so much, miss!
- What a relief.

302
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,720
Thank you.

303
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,620
[Wei]
Futian's father,

304
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,070
What happened to me?

305
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,590
You were poisoned.

306
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,240
They saved you.

307
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,830
Thank you, miss.

308
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,350
Avoid heavy labor

309
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,310
for the next few days.

310
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,830
Madam Wang,

311
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,960
we'll head back now.

312
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,030
Alright.

313
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,070
Who are they?

314
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,400
They're siblings
who fled to our village.

315
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,310
They're really kind,

316
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,030
especially the girl.

317
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,400
You've got your eye on her, haven't you?

318
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,720
No, I haven't.

319
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,510
No?

320
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,680
Who would believe that?

321
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,880
Miss Mei Lin!

322
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,160
Miss Mei Lin.

323
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,880
Madam.

324
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,960
There's something I'd like to ask you.

325
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,550
Are you engaged?

326
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,550
- No.
- Yes.

327
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,030
She was engaged,

328
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,750
but her fiance

329
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,750
died while we were fleeing.

330
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,830
Now, it's just the two of us.

331
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,960
After all this time,

332
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,960
as her brother,

333
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,240
I'm reluctant to let her go.

334
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,070
All women eventually marry,

335
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,640
right?

336
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,880
You wouldn't want
to hold your sister back.

337
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,480
Miss Mei Lin,

338
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,550
there are plenty of good men
in our village.

339
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,480
Take your time to pick.

340
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,440
I'm sure both you and your brother
will be satisfied.

341
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,480
It's up to my brother.

342
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:34,790
Madam Wang, here's the thing.

343
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,550
Once Mei Lin gets better,

344
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,830
we'll be on the road

345
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,030
to find our relatives.

346
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,030
It's dangerous out there.

347
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,440
Why don't you stay here?

348
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,350
Laowozi Village

349
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,640
is safe from war

350
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,000
and government interference,

351
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,000
with plenty of mountains and streams
to keep you fed.

352
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,270
If you stay, you'll have a good life.

353
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,510
Think it over.

354
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,510
We'll think about it.

355
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,640
Think it over, okay?

356
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,480
Madam,

357
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,030
I'm the one who makes the call.

358
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,640
Right,

359
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,480
my brother makes the call.

360
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,350
Alright then.

361
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,310
I'll go get a bed ready for you two.

362
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,640
A bed?

363
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,030
Oh, right.

364
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,480
You're siblings,

365
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,510
so you can't share the same bed.

366
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,160
I'll prepare two beds.

367
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:20,960
Two.

368
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,830
Do I really get to make the call?

369
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,960
I'm not as good at making up stories,

370
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,750
so you decide.

371
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,550
If only you'd always listen to me.

372
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,160
Come with me.

373
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:43,920
Where?

374
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,350
You'll see when we get there.

375
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,680
I saw them while gathering herbs
in the mountains.

376
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,070
You brought me here

377
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,480
to watch fireflies with you?

378
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,400
We're here to catch them,

379
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,110

You like fireflies?

397
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,550
Don't you like sleeping
with the light on?

398
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,590
The villagers don't
want to waste lamp oil,

399
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,640
so you can hang
this firefly pouch by your bed.

400
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,240
It might help you sleep.

401
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
Why are you doing this?

402
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,000
You gave your sleeping powder
to the villagers.

403
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,440
Without it, you can't sleep.

404
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,480
I can't knock you out
every night, right?

405
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,110
I'm the reason they suffer.

406
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,830
I deserve the consequences.

407
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,880
Hurt your hand breaking the window?

408
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,200
Let's go home and treat it.

409
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,270
It's just a scratch.
Don't worry about it.

410
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,240
For a moment, I thought
they were going to...

411
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,240
Why were you so panicked today?

412
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,160
You weren't scared at all

413
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,590
when Wenhua Pavilion caught fire.

414
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,640
I was afraid you'd end up
like my father.

415
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,440
During the Qingzhou fire,

416
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,350
he saved me at the cost of his life.

417
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,480
I watched as he was burned alive,

418
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,960
but he never let go of the rope.

419
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,160
Mei, hold on tight!

420
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,960
- Father!
- Mei!

421
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,030
- Father!
- You must...

422
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,880
You must survive!

423
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,680
I used to struggle with sleep.

424
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,550
Even a sliver of light

425
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,110
would give me nightmares.

426
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,160
But now,

427
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,070
I don't anymore.

428
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Both the Qingzhou fire

429
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,480
and Zhongshan poisoning

430
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,200
resulted from

431
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,110
the power struggle for the throne.

432
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:25,920
You,

433
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,440
Wei,

434
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,310
the Xiyan beauties,

435
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,400
and the 100,000 innocent people

436
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,160
don't deserve any of these consequences.

437
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,960
I once valued
the honor of the Weibei Army

438
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,440
above all,

439
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,270
but now I realize

440
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,350
the suffering of the people

441
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,510
far exceeds anything
the Weibei Army went through.

442
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,310
What's done is done.

443
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,440
We have to look ahead.

444
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,790
We both need to learn
to wake up from our nightmares.

445
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,310
Let's go.

446
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,680
It makes the room much brighter.

447
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,070
Sleep well.

448
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,270
Even a lifetime of atonement

449
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,960
may never be enough.

450
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,160
What?

451
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,110
The Crown Prince

452
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,550
is also searching for Mei Lin?

453
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,200
His Highness often says in private

454
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,550
that he doesn't believe

455
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,640
Prince Jing's death

456
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,030
was an accident.

457
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:12,960
Liu Zhong,

458
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,880
what do you think?

459
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,640
Speak freely.

460
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,680
Your Majesty,

461
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,110
in my humble opinion,

462
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,590
His Highness and Your Majesty

463
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,550
are thinking the same thing.

464
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:33,590
Both General Yin
and Princess Hengyang's son

465
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:37,310
saw Mei Lin at Lushan Hunting Ground.

466
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:41,480
I'm afraid the truth
behind Prince Jing's death

467
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,680
can only be uncovered

468
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,400
when we find Mei Lin.

469
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,200
You sly old fox,

470
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,270
you're just circling around!

471
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,000
Send some Imperial Guards

472
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,920
to secretly follow
the Crown Prince's men.

473
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,270
We must find Mei Lin

474
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,350
before they do.

475
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,640
Your Majesty, do you mean...?

476
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,830
I suspect the Crown Prince
is searching for Mei Lin

477
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,680
to kill her.

478
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,640
Your Majesty,

479
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,720
are you implying

480
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,550
that His Highness

481
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,960
was behind Prince Jing's death?

482
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,070
Liu Zhong,

483
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,270
do you think it's my bad karma

484
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,790
that my sons

485
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,750
have come to this?

486
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,720
Your Majesty,

487
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,200
Prince Jing is already gone.

488
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,350
Even if you uncover the truth,

489
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,240
what good would it do?

490
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,350
Jinghe,

491
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,240
Empress Dejia,

492
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,350
don't blame me.

493
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,070
Born into the imperial family,

494
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,270
this is his fate.

495
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,440
I've walked this same path myself.

496
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,510
As long as the Crown Prince

497
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,550
doesn't jeopardize the nation,

498
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,960
I cannot strip him of his position.

499
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,350
But I must

500
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,790
know the truth!

501
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,200
Your Highness?

502
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,270
What brings you here?

503
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,240
Where is everyone?

504
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,880
Why didn't you report
Her Highness's arrival?

505
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,350
I acknowledge my mistake.

506
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,270
I...

507
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,830
I've overstepped my bounds.

508
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:53,750
I just

509
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,310
wanted to bring some ginseng soup
to Your Majesty.

510
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,310
The filth and gossip in the palace

511
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,590
are none of your concern.

512
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,680
Don't listen to it,

513
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,640
and don't overthink things.

514
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,350
Yes, I understand.

515
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,030
Liu Zhong.

516
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,030
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Where's the burn ointment?

517
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,070
I'll fetch it right away.

518
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,310
I know you're worried about Mei Lin.

519
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,750
I've already sent people
to search for her.

520
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,920
If she had nothing to do
with Jinghe's death,

521
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,750
I wouldn't harm her.

522
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,640
But if she was involved,

523
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,590
I don't want you to interfere.

524
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,830
Do you understand?

525
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,590
Yes.

526
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,790
Your Majesty.

527
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,750
Did I scare you?

528
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,240
Next time I'm angry,

529
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,400
stay away

530
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,110
from me.

531
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,750
We might receive good news

532
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,440
from your brother in Xiyan soon.

533
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,110
No need to be scared.

534
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,680
Go back and rest.

535
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

536
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,270
Under the divine envoys' watch,

537
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,440
His Majesty fulfills heaven's will,

538
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,070
blessing Xiyan with peace, prosperity,
and abundant resources

539
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,590
through all seasons.

540
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,110
The people of Xiyan

541
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,070
give thanks to the heavens
and honor our King!

542
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,550
Rise.

543
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,750
The gods revealed in a dream
to His Majesty

544
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:45,110
that the Left Divine Envoy, Sun Kunlun,
was born into the royal family of Xiyan.

545
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,440
Today, we have
the Second Prince, Yue Chu,

546
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,070
and the Sixth Prince, Yue Qin,

547
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,750
both wise and brave.

548
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,640
We beseech the gods for a clear sign

549
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,070
to appoint the rightful heir

550
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,070
and bless Xiyan
for a thousand generations!

551
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,160
I have seen the will of the gods.

552
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,640
You are the chosen one.

553
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,550
The Second Prince tampered
with the altar.

554
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,510
I will set everything back

555
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,160
on the right track.

556
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,460
[Mingju, General of Xiyan]

557
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,440
It seems the Sixth Prince

558
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,510
is the reincarnation of the Sun Kunlun!

559
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,680
You...!

560
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,350
Father,

561
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,790
the High Priest and Yue Qin
are colluding.

562
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,550
They've

563
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,310
tricked you!

564
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,790
Father,

565
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,880
I would never dare
interfere with divine will.

566
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,160
The Second Prince
disrespects the divine envoys

567
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,270
and will face heavenly punishment.

568
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,270
The Sixth Prince, Yue Qin,

569
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,720
is the reincarnation of Sun Kunlun.

570
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,960
The will of heaven

571
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,030
can not be defied!

572
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,310
Nonsense!

573
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,680
I refuse to accept this!

574
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,400
I'm the Second Prince of Xiyan.

575
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,680
Come nearer if you dare.

576
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,790
The Sixth Prince, Yue Qin,

577
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,160
is blessed by the gods.

578
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:07,640
He shall ascend to the throne of Xiyan.

579
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,880
Long live the King!

580
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,840
The gods have chosen the true heir!

581
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,710
With divine protection,

582
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,030
Xiyan shall flourish for all eternity!

583
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:07,060
[Prince Heir's Mansion]

584
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:07,630
Mr. Yue Qin...

585
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,030
no, Your Highness,

586
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:12,400
news of your ascension as Prince Heir
has reached Great Yan.

587
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,510
The princess will hear of it soon.

588
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,960
As per your instructions,

589
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,480
we've transplanted

590
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,360
some Qingzhou crops to the estate.

591
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,550
When Mei Lin moves to Xiyan,

592
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,630
she can tend to these Qingzhou crops

593
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,070
to ease her homesickness.

594
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,920
Farming?

595
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,710
Will Miss Mei Lin
enjoy that kind of life?

596
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:40,710
Madam Wang!

597
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:42,800
Madam Wang.

598
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,230
The harvest is here!

599
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,190
In a few days,

600
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,320
we'll hold a big feast to celebrate.

601
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,550
There'll be so much delicious food!

602
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,550
Madam,

603
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,550
we'll help you out.

604
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,150
Yeah.

605
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,000
You stay here.

606
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,590
The physician said

607
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:00,000
you were still weak and needed rest.

608
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,920
Your sister's quick and capable.

609
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,190
Her help is enough.

610
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,070
Listen to Madam Wang.

611
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,280
Don't get in the way.

612
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,320
I'll help too.

613
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,760
I'm all better now.

614
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,280
Thank you, Mei Lin.

615
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,030
Wei,

616
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,800
you still have poison in you.

617
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,920
If you don't rest,

618
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,440
you won't do heavy work again.

619
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,960
Without strength,

620
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,190
how will you make a living?

621
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,760
Exactly. Listen to my brother.

622
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,320
Just rest.

623
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:21,670
Enough.

624
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,360
You two will just make things harder.

625
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,110
Mei Lin's help is all I need.

626
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,590
Let's get to work.

627
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,360
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

628
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,840
I'll help once I fully recover, okay?

629
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,480
Just rest.

let me help you.

654
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,440
It's alright, Wei.

655
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,070
I've got it.

656
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,710
It's alright. I can do it.

657
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,150
I'm really fine.

658
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,960
Futian's father said I could work again.

659
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,510
Stop working and go rest.

660
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,400
No worries.

661
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,190
Let me help you.

662
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,880
Here, wear my hat.

663
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,400
It's too hot. Put it on.

664
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,920
I don't need it, Wei.

665
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,030
Just put it on.

666
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:35,840
I'm not hot. You wear it.

667
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,190
I really don't need it.

668
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:38,630
Erniu,

669
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,280
see that big guy up ahead?

670
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,800
Tell the big brother Erniu did it!

671
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Erniu!

672
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,960
I'll beat you up!

673
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,030
Is it pretty?

Here.

675
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,000
Did you make these?

676
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,760
I borrowed them from Erniu's mother.

677
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,960
The crops can be prickly.

678
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,000
Better put them on.

679
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,630
They fit perfectly.

680
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,360

681
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,190
He can even do needlework!

682
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,320
Miss, you're such a lucky girl!

683
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,190

Ergou, let your wife take a break.

Look at her. She's exhausted!

687
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,190
Do it like this.

688
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,480
Make a clean cut.

689
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:20,670
Like this?

690
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,000
You're weak,
yet you have great strength.

691
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,110

you pulled out the roots too.
