00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,600
Alright.

189
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,870
Here you go.

190
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:39,840
My lord?

191
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,240
I don't have any money.

192
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,150
Hurry up.

193
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,150
Thank you, sir.

194
00:12:59,360 --> 00:12:59,870
Thank you.

195
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,120
Lanterns for sale!

196
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,270
Fancy lanterns!

197
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,200
After I escaped from Qingzhou,

198
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,720
I traveled with a stray dog for a while.

199
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,840
That dog was fierce.

200
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,000
It would steal the wild vegetables
and buns I scavenged.

201
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,600
To avoid starving,

202
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,960
I had to fight it for food.

203
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,080
Look here, my lord.

204
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,390
This scar is from the dog's bite.

205
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,030
Later on,

206
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,440
it kept following me.

207
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,080
Eventually, I got used to it.

208
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,440
Having it by my side,

209
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,440
it protected me.

210
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,080
If anyone bullied me,

211
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,030
it would bite them back.

212
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,120
My lord.

213
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,510
I'm giving this to you.

214
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,200
This dog lantern suits you perfectly.

215
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,510
How dare you!

216
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,120
Comparing me to a dog!

217
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,600
That dog was my only companion

218
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,790
after the fire in Qingzhou.

219
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,140
[Exemplary Conduct and Virtue]

220
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,840
You

221
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,750
should have told me
all of this long ago.

222
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,440
I was foolish.

223
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,910
I was deceived by Zhang Yin,

224
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,360
thinking I could keep everything hidden

225
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,360
and still help you send Mei Lin away.

226
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,600
In the end,
it's me who dragged you into this mess.

227
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,600
Zhang Yin had me
smuggle goods to Xiyan,

228
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,120
but he secretly brought them back
to Great Yan.

229
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,910
They're hidden
in the West Mountain Mine.

230
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,030
I suspect

231
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,360
the mine holds evidence
against the Crown Prince.

232
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,630
If you use this information

233
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,320
to earn the Crown Prince's help,

234
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,840
perhaps you can find safety

235
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,750
return to Xiyan.

236
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:57,840
Here.

237
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:05,550
Shumo.

238
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,550
Rest assured.

239
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,840
I'll take care of the rest.

240
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,910
You need to focus on recovering.

241
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,320
Let me help you.

242
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:56,790
How is it?

243
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,630
The arrow was poisoned.

244
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,790
Even with the finest medicines,

245
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,120
he will have at most...

246
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,720
three days.

247
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,480
Minister Zhang,

248
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,920
how does the food

249
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,270
at my mansion

250
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,270
compare to the meals
at the Eastern Palace?

251
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,830
It's the same.

252
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,110
Both are the last meals
for the condemned.

253
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,440
I thought you had grown too comfortable

254
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,070
over the years,

255
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,440
that your spine had hardened,

256
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,000
and you weren't afraid
of death anymore.

257
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,240
My lord, you know,

258
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,070
I'm just a pawn in someone else's hands,
like a dog on a leash.

259
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,480
If you kill me,

260
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,960
you'll only dirty your hands.

261
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,160
At least you're self-aware.

262
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,750
But I keep you well-fed for a reason.

263
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,720
To bite.

264
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,790
You want me
to turn on the Crown Prince?

265
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,350
The Crown Prince falls,

266
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,750
and you'll live.

267
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:42,000
You know, there were two masterminds

268
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,030
behind the Qingzhou fire.

269
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:43,790
One

270
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,070
was the strategist Li Qing,
advisor to Prince Xuanlie at the time.

271
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,110
The other

272
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,350
was me.

273
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,000
That strategist

274
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,590
was silenced years ago,

275
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,830
but I chose to play the scapegoat

276
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,830
to prove my loyalty,
and that's how I survived.

277
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,750
I'm the only living witness

278
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,680
who can testify
against the Crown Prince.

279
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,480
Surely, Your Highness,

280
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,440
you know this well by now.

281
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,550
You should consider yourself lucky.

282
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,510
You still

283
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,640
have value as a dog.

284
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,750
Roast meat.

285
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,070
Qingyang Restaurant makes it the best.

286
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,550
The pork needs to be smoked
with pine wood, perfect with wine.

287
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,030
This...

288
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:49,960
My lord.

289
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,030
A dog needs to eat well
to have the strength to bite, right?

290
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Do you really think I believe

291
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,350
a dog about to bite its master

292
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,510
cares about what it eats?

293
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,350
If I'm not mistaken,

294
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,200
Qingyang Restaurant has spies

295
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,270
working for the Crown Prince.

296
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,400
Pork head,

297
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,510
that's the signal, right?

298
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,790
Do you still think

299
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,830
your master will come to save you?

300
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,550
Even if I help you,

301
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,070
I'm still as good as dead, aren't I?

302
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,020
[Weibei]

303
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,510
This.

304
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,830
Does this look familiar?

305
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,550
You created it.

306
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,200
Life

307
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,590
or death.

308
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,680
It depends on you.

309
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:12,790
My lord.

310
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,270
Wait! My lord.

311
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:16,510
My lord.

312
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:17,880
I have more proof.

313
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,480
Even if I speak out,

314
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,270
it won't be enough
to convict the Crown Prince.

315
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,640
Ten years ago,
I wasn't yet working for him.

316
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,590
The only person

317
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,960
who can destroy the Crown Prince now

318
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,070
is the strategist Li Qing.

319
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,880
Li Qing is still alive?

320
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,880
No wonder you survived

321
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,110
and dared to contact the Crown Prince.

322
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,030
So that's your life-saving card.

323
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:50,830
My lord.

324
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,640
Spare my life,

325
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,790
and I'll tell you where Li Qing is.

326
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,200
I'm the only one

327
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,400
in the world who knows.

328
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,550
It seems

329
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,480
I underestimated you, Minister Zhang.

330
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,350
Confirm

331
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,550
if Li Qing is indeed
at the West Mountain Mine.

332
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,350
Yes, my lord.

333
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,750
Infiltrate the peace-making
marriage delegation of Xiyan

334
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,880
and assassinate
the third prince of Great Yan,

335
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,200
Murong Jinghe.

336
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,240
Prince Jing has discovered us.

337
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,640
If the Qingzhou case is reopened,

338
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,640
I'm as good as dead.

339
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:37,830
Everyone,

340
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,640
cease all actions,

341
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,000
and go into hiding among the civilians.

342
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,920
You've been waiting for a long time?

343
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,270
What grudge do Zhang Yin and you have
that he had to

344
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,750
drag innocent Qingzhou civilians
to their deaths?

345
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,440
Zhang Yin and his Momai Warriors

346
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,880
were just pawns.

347
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,480
The one you should hate

348
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,000
is the man behind it all.

349
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,880
My elder brother,

350
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,920
the Crown Prince of Great Yan,

351
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,110
Murong Xuanlie.

352
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,200
If

353
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,960
I had returned victorious
from recapturing Qingzhou,

354
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,720
I would've been sitting pretty

355
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,160
as the Crown Prince.

356
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,960
But my brother coveted the position,

357
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,680
so,

358
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,270
he turned General Weibei,
who had saved Qingzhou,

359
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,590
into the mass murderer general
who slaughtered civilians.

360
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,960
I heard

361
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,960
the Crown Prince was raised
by your mother.

362
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,680
Then you...?

363
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,160
Once, we were close as brothers.

364
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:51,960
Now,

365
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,750
it's kill or be killed.

366
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:01,350
What about you?

367
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,880
Aren't you afraid

368
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,200
of opposing the Crown Prince?

369
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,310
Ha, the Crown Prince?

370
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,880
He bought his position

371
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,510
with the lives of innocent civilians.

372
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,110
I will kill him with my own hands.

373
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,400
At worst, it's a life for a life.

374
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,720
If my death can take down

375
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,960
the Crown Prince,

376
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,200
it's worth it.

377
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,750
Killing him is too merciful.

378
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,200
What we should do

379
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,270
is make him atone

380
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,590
for Qingzhou's 100,000 souls,

381
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,160
for the innocent Weibei soldiers
who died.

382
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,680
He should confess his sins
before the world.

383
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:38,750
So,

384
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,310
to defeat the Crown Prince,

385
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,960
we don't need to trade lives.

386
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,830
It would be a waste

387
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,160
if you died.

388
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,960
Prince Jing and Mei Lin
are working against the Crown Prince.

389
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,680
Could the Crown Prince

390
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,440
be the true culprit of Qingzhou fire?

391
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,160
Mr. Yue Qin.

392
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,160
Mr. Yue Qin.

Your Highness.

396
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,310
Lie down and rest.

397
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,070
I've taken care of everything.

398
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,640
Zigu won't be harmed,

399
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,400
and neither will I.

400
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,480
We'll return to Xiyan together.

401
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,480
Have some rest...

402
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,030
That's good to hear.

403
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,510
That's good to hear.

404
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,270
After you return to Xiyan,

405
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,310
you'll need to manage some connections.

406
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,070
I've already prepared gifts for you.

407
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,350
They're stored
in the side courtyard warehouse.

408
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,790
I'm not exaggerating.

409

if you wish it,

411
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,960
the throne of Xiyan could be yours.

412
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,440
And that bamboo brew.

413
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,000
It's been specially prepared
for the Princess.

414
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,960
Make sure to remind her

415
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,550

to carve wood figurines late at night,

419
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,440

This tea recipe,

422
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,790
I found it to protect your eyes.

423
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,590
As for that boy Yunqi.

424
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,880
He's quite clever.

425
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:13,350
Over the years, I have kept him
by my side, teaching him everything.

426
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,350
He knows

00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,030
all your preferences.

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,200

Please,

436
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:55,640
could you pass me the wooden tiger tooth
from the table?

437
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,310
You said

438
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,200
it's meant to protect people.

439
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:12,920
Alright.

440
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,830
Shumo!

441
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,920
Damaging a sacred object

442
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,680
means your entire family
faces execution by strangulation.

443
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,480
It was an accident!

444
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,200
Wait for me.

445
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:30,920
Mother once told me,

446
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,790
living people are more important
than wood.

447
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,270
After all,

448
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,030
the sacred object's purpose
is to protect people

449
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,030
I don't have to die anymore.

450
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,030
Thank you for saving my life,
Your Highness.

451

My whole family is saved!

452
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,270
Don't mention death.

453
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,070
I hate seeing it.

454
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,680
It's okay.

455
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:10,200
I'm not a scared eight-year-old anymore.

456
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,680
There's nothing to fear.

457
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,240
The Yisang flower is used in Xiyan
to honor the dead.

458
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:35,350
In Great Yan,
we don't grow such inauspicious flowers.

459
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,200
Your Highness.

460
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,920
Your Highness.

461
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,400
I couldn't find any Yisang flowers.

462
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,510
What about you?

463
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,510
Did you find any?

464
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,590
We came here together,

465
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,200
we must return home together.

466
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,030
When we first arrived in Great Yan,

467
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,720
the household was lacking in money,

468
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,200
and we barely had enough to eat.

469
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,790
I always thought

470
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,270
you sold my wooden carvings

471
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,510
to improve our situation.

472
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,920
Who would've guessed

473
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,960
that the money came

474
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,200
from your smuggling operations?

475
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:01,000
You took on so much risk for me.

476
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,480
It's I who burdened you.

477
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,110
I couldn't protect you.

478
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,440
I can't even

479
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,440
carve a simple Yisang flower properly.

480
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,830
Not even a single flower...

481
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,550
Miss Mei Lin.

482
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:48,720
Where is Mr. Yue Qin?

483
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,640
After His Highness returned,

484
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,790
he locked himself in his room,

485
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,920
refusing to see anyone.

486
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:01,790
Shumo...

487
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,590
I can't even carve
a single Yisang flower.

488
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,200
A small, simple Yisang flower...

489
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,270
I can't carve it.

490
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,400
I can't.

491
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,310
Your Highness.

492
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,550
I embroidered this Yisang flower sash.

493
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,680
I know that in Xiyan,

494
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,110
if a person from Xiyan dies
in a foreign land,

495
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:52,270
a Yisang flower sash must be placed
in a high spot.

496
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,320
Let's send Shumo home together.

497
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,760
Yisang flower,

498
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,230
a ladder to the heavens.

499
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,880
We beseech the god
to guide the soul home.

500
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,110
With the Yisang flower sash here,

501
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,480
Shumo has returned home.

502
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,400
Mei Lin,

503
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,510
come with me.

504
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,400
I can't stand by and watch you

505
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,630
meet the same end as Shumo.

506
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,590
Mr. Yue Qin,

507
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,360
I'll protect myself.

508
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,760
But the path you've chosen
is lined with thorns.

509
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,920
After the great fire in Qingzhou,

510
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,920
I never thought
there was any other path for me.

511
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
There's no turning back.

512
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,360
Since you've made up your mind,

513
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,230
I hope this will help you.

514
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,190
These letters were left by Shumo.

515
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,280
I know

516
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,840
that you're working with Prince Jing.

517
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,510
The most important clues
must be kept in your own hands.

518
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,480
That's the only way

519
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,630
to avoid becoming a pawn,

520
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,280
thrown away to die.

521
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,670
No matter what you choose to do,

522
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,960
I just want you to survive.

523
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,630
Thank you, Mr. Yue Qin.

524
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,400
The letters only mention

525
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,400
Shumo helping Zhang Yin smuggle goods

526
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,920
to the West Mountain Mine.

527
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,630
Why would that be evidence
against the Crown Prince?

528
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,880
To protect himself,

529
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,360
Zhang Yin has been hiding

530
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,800
a key witness from the Qingzhou fire.

531
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,670
The Crown Prince's strategist,

532
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:50,670
Li Qing.

533
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,280
All these years,

534
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,760
he's been using Shumo's smuggling

535
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,960
to stay in contact with Li Qing.

536
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,800
So, Your Highness,

537
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,630
Li Qing is hiding
in the West Mountain Mine?

538
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:01,840
That's right.

539
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,710
And Li Qing is even more important

540
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,190
than Zhang Yin.

541
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,440
When should we capture him?

542
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,230
Capturing Li Qing

543
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,800
requires careful planning.

544
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,550
If we aren't prepared,

545
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,360
it will arouse
the Crown Prince's suspicion.

546
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:19,670
So, for now,

547
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,760
you just need to play the role
of my Beauty.

548
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,670
Yue Qin gave you these things

549
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,110
to teach you how to manipulate me.

550
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,800
Too bad his schemes were in vain.

551
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,360
Mr. Yue Qin doesn't truly understand

552
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,670
your character, Your Highness.

553
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,440
His worries are natural.

554
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,920
Then tell me,

555
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,360
what kind of person do you think I am?

556
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,360
You are

557
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,190
different

558
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,230
from the reckless princes.

559
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,150
Mr. Yue Qin is helping us.

560
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:04,440
I wonder
if he'll make it back to Xiyan safely.

561
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,630
Shumo's crimes

562
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,550
will be erased by my people.

563
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,630
Yue Qin has nothing to do with this,

564
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,920
and he'll return safely.

565
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,920
As for you,

566
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,440
whatever debts you owe him,
they're settled now.

567
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:27,630
From now on,

568
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,230
don't concern yourself with people
who don't matter.

569
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,360
This dog lantern suits you perfectly.

570
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,670
How dare you!

571
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,280
Comparing me to a dog!

572
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,320
That dog was my only companion

573
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,480
after the fire in Qingzhou.

574
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,030
if I were just a tool,

575
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,190
you would have perished long ago.

576
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,670
To avenge Qingzhou.

577
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,190
I am willing to be a sharp blade.

578
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,760
Even if it means cutting myself.

579
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,190
I have no regrets.

580
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,760
It bit you,

581
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,550
yet you still made it your friend.

582
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:49,920
You're a fool.
