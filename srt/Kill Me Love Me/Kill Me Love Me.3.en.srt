00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,150
First wishes work best.

191
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,910
Give it a try.

192
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,840
Your Highness.

193
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,480
Your Highness,

194
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,320
His Highness is returning.

195
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,840
I got it.

196
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,720
Go ahead and try.

197
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,030
I know what to do now.

198
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,660
Father, Mother,

199
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,980
please bless me.

200
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:46,340
[Changxi Pavilion]

201
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,340
Mr. Yue Qin.

202
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,180
[Yue Qin, Xiyan Prince]

203
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,630
Zigu detests confinement.

204
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,300
Get a maid familiar with Yan etiquette,

205
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,110
to guide her in the palace.

206
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:10,780
Oh,

207
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,630
have you changed the incense?

208
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,940
Zigu sleeps best with familiar scents.

209
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,540
If there's a familiar scent,

210
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,030
maybe she can sleep better..

211
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,580
You may rest assured.

212
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,900
[Shumo]
I prepared her incense yesterday,

213
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,030
and by the way,

214
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,990
arranged everything to her liking.

215
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,420
Mei Lin.

216
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,110
Wait for me, Your Highness.

217
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:03,940
It's a Qingzhou knot,

218
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,270
a charm from Qingzhou folk.

219
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:19,660
Mei Lin,

220
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,300
is that you?

221
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,660
Your Highness,

222
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,030
was it really her?

223
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,110
The beauties

224
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,780
include Xiyan exiles from Qingzhou.

225
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,660
Others know the Qingzhou Knot, too.

226
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,390
Your Highness.

227
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,150
It's time to go.

228
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,420
Her Highness awaits.

229
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,870
Brother's craftsmanship is unmatched.

230
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,990
His Highness must've put in much effort.

231
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,660
Zigu.

232
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,470
Brother.

233
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,270
Brother.

234
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,350
Brother.

235
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,700
I missed you so much.

236
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,300
Brother, look.

237
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,700
I'm all grown up now.

238
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,900
No longer the tearful little fairy.

239
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,030
But I still think

240
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,270
that's the you I find most adorable.

241
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:34,700
Brother,

242
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,510
they say after the alliance banquet,

243
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,300
you'll return to Xiyan.

244
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,350
I won't go anywhere

245
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,470
until you're settled

246
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,110
and everything is done.

247
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,940
What if I never settle?

248
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,420
I can't protect you forever.

249
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,270
Does the Emperor of Great Yan

250
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,990
kill people at his will?

251
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,580
No,

252
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,470
he's a wise ruler.

253
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,580
No need to worry.

254
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,380
Is he handsome?

255
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:12,820
Forget it.

256
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,580
Handsome or not, he's still an old man.

257
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,230
Brother,

258
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,950
do you have a girl you like?

259
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,580
What about you, Zigu?

260
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,820
Ziyu used to mock me,

261
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,670
saying no one dares to take this.

262
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,820
Now, it seems, she is true.

263
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,100
I wouldn't even know

264
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,140
what it feels like
to have a special someone.

265
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,430
What you think of each day.

266
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,670
What you dream of each night.

267
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,060
Brother,

268
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,230
do you have someone in your heart?

269
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,670
Tell me, who is she?

270
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,300
I fear that in this life,

271
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,670
I will be fated to miss her.

272
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:13,910
Zigu,

273
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,710
tomorrow, after the alliance banquet,

274
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,780
you will be Concubine Yan of Yan Dynasty.

275
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,670
The jade ring not being given away

276
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,430
is both a regret and a blessing.

277
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,860
The palace rules are complex,

278
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,540
one wrong step...

279
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,860
And it may bring harm to Xiyan.

280
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:30,860
I know.

281
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,430
No, it would harm you.

282
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,060
Xiyan needs a princess's marriage

283
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,540
to secure peace with Yan Dynasty,

284
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,470
but you owe Xiyan nothing.

285
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,380
Wait for me.

286
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,620
Is this not the dagger
Mother gave to you, Brother?

287
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,300
Now,

288
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,820
it is yours.

289
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,470
If, one day,

290
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,990
you face a dilemma,

291
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,190
I hope you

292
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,340
can prioritize protecting yourself.

293
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,620
Mother doesn't wish for me
to wield weapons.

294
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,910
You've grown up, Zigu,

295
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,140
and should learn how to use a blade.

296
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,040
[Imperial Palace]

297
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,990
Princess Zigu of Xiyan
greets Your Majesty of Great Yan.

298
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,540
May Your Majesty be blessed
with health and a long reign.

299
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,510
Proceed.

300
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:12,670
To Princess Zigu of Xiyan:

301
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,030
Regal and demure,

302
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,820
gentle and graceful,

303
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,780
wise and reserved,

304
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,430
virtuous in conduct,

305
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,510
and fit for the inner palace.

306
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,580
Thus,

307
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,710
appointed as Concubine Yan,

308
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,190
granting residence in Fanghua Palace.

309
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,030
Execute as decreed.

310
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,860
The proclamation is now complete.

311
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,270
Now, Great Yan and Xiyan

312
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,190
forge ties of harmony.

313
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,710
Let the people of both lands

314
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,910
live as one family

315
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:48,300
in eternal peace and joy.

316
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,100
Long live Your Majesty's wisdom.

317
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:04,420
[Taichi Palace]

318
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,140
[Taichi Palace]

319
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,060
Twenty chests of lacquered potteries.

320
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,540
Six new gilt sapphire loongs.

321
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,300
Ten pairs of agate cups
in the shape of animal heads.

322
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,030
Ten jars of fermented mare's milk.

323
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:29,190
Ten jars of Yangpuli wine.

324
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,580
Ten hu of East Sea pearls.
[*Ancient Chinese unit of volume]

325

Two Liuli phoenix-tail fans.
[*Chinese traditional colored glaze]

Twenty Ferghana horses.

Two bottles of Toxin-Neutralizing
Red Coix Seed Potion.

328
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:56,190
The 18 Tribes of Xiyan congratulate
Concubine Yan on her marriage.

329
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,140
Concubine Yan, you've come from afar.

330
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,510
I've had imperial cooks
specially prepare

331
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,340
Xiyan's bamboo brew

332
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,430
to ease your homesickness.

333
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,510
Well,

334
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,300
Your Majesty...

335
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,030
Concubine Yan, no need for formalities.

336
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,710
Thank you, Your Majesty.

337
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,190
Today is a day of joy.

338
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,030
All in the palace may feast.

339
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,780
There's no need for restraint.

340
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:38,060
Let the first group of beauties line up.

341
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,270
[Noble Consort Yin]
The beauties of Xiyan

342
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,340
[Noble Consort Yin]
are all remarkably graceful.

343
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:11,300
Marrying Xiyan beauties
to Yan Dynasty officials

344
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,060
also serves the peace
between our nations.

345
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,380
Since the Eastern Palace
leads the noble clans,

346
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,470
Crown Prince
shall make the first choice.

347
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,820
Thank you, Father.

348
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,540
What is your name?

349
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,470
Your Highness,

350
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,140
my name is Mei Lin.

351
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:25,060
Judging by your features,
you look like one of our own.

352
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,300
I was born

353
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,510
on the Xiyan-Great Yan border

354
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,470
and have lived
within Great Yan territory.

355
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:35,910
Welcome to the Eastern Palace.

356
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,670
Here, take this jade pendant.

357
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:03,780
Wait.

358
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,430
Third Brother, you...

359
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,510
Son,

360
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,620
your leg...

361
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,990
My leg is healed.

362
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:07,910
Father,

363
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,910
I was so focused on the beauty.

364
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,140
I feared Big Brother
would pick her first.

365
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,470
In my haste,

366
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,710
I actually stood up on my own.

367
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,030
That's good news.

368
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,990
But you should still have
Imperial Healer Zhang examine it.

369
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,300
Yes, Father.

370
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,990
You aren't the true culprit
of the massacre.

371
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,470
I have proof.

372
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:01,950
Save me.

373
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:13,780
Son!

374
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:14,430
Your Majesty!

375
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,230
Your Majesty, rest assured.

376
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,510
Thankfully, Prince Jing
wore a Gold Silk Armor.

377
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,710
It was truly

378
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,230
a divine intervention
that saved his life.

379
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,510
Easy there.

380
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,180
Father,

381
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,470
I am fine,

382
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,550
just a few scrapes.

383
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,340
But I

384
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,550
was shaken.

385
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,180
Third Brother,

386
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,710
you can walk,

387
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,820
yet you've used a wheelchair.

388
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:06,900
This

389
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,140
can be a crime against the throne.

390
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:11,710
Father,

391
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:12,820
Big Brother,

392
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,990
I had no choice.

393
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,790
Even as a disabled man,
I attract assassins.

394
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,660
Were I to stand up fully,

395
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,820
I doubt

396
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,620
If I'd live longer.

397
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,100
Fortunately, I was prepared,

398
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,470
and that saved me this time.

399
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,580
Son,

400
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,380
for all these years,

401
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,550
you have suffered in Jingbei.

402
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,310
Now that you can stand, all is well.

403
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,310
Back then, I thought

404
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,900
your leg couldn't be saved.

405
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:46,900
The healer said,

406
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,340
only by breaking and resetting the bone

407
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,550
do you stand a chance to walk again.

408
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,470
Heavens blessed you.

409
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,860
You are truly fortunate.

410
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,580
I never expected

411
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,230
that Xiyan beauty

412
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,030
had seduced me

413
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,580
just to try and assassinate me.

414
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:42,950
Father,

415
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,100
how would you handle her?

416
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,750
Do not worry.

417
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,310
I will see to it

418
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,030
personally.

419
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,180
First, recover well.

420
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,420
Father,

421
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,900
those Xiyan people hate me,

422
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,140
but would not dare
assassinate me so openly,

423
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,900
jeopardizing the peace-making marriage.

424
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,900
You mean to say?

425
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,510
Within the court,

426
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,820
someone wish to use them

427
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,790
to rid me for good.

428
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,340
Who do you suspect?

429
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,660
Of everyone in court,

430
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,860
only you, Big Brother,

431
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,550
would never harm me.

432
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,420
Father,

433
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,820
I request

434
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,900
that the Eastern Palace
lead the investigation.

435
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,030
Son,

436
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,510
this is related to Xiyan.

437
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,420
Handle this with utmost caution.

438
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,310
Rest assured, Third Brother.

439
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,860
I'll uncover

440
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,860
who's behind this.

441
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,340
[Imperial Prison]

442
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,070
Fear not, Your Highness.

443
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,180
No one leaves here with secrets intact

444
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,580
after facing these instruments

445
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,310
of torture.

446
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:31,620
Your Highness,

447
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,790
Minister Zhang
has waited outside for long.

448
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,380
He claims the woman has no ties to him.

449
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,030
If this woman isn't Zhang Yin's agent,

450
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,270
then she must be Third Brother's.

451
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,710
Ten years on,

452
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,100
Prince Jing still uses
this "feigned injury" ploy,

453
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,660
proving he has no other evidence

454
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,550
beyond Momai Warriors.

455
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,620
The Qingzhou incident was flawless.

456
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,310
Even with ten more years,

457
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,470
Prince Jing wouldn't be able
to trace it back to Your Highness.

458
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,710
Tell Zhang Yin to hold steady.

459
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,990
Now, go and summon my third brother.

460
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,070
Yes, Your Highness.

461
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,470
You aren't the true culprit
of the massacre.

462
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:21,830
I have proof.

463
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,070
Save me.

464
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,550
She even pierced the Gold Silk Armor

465
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:32,950
yet deliberately spared me.

466
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,070
My lord.

467
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:40,910
My lord.

468
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,430
The medicine is cold now.

469
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,390
Qingyan,

470
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,390
could there be clues out there?

471
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,950
Clues that we missed?

472
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,030
Even if there are,

473
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,580
none would expose the Crown Prince.

474
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,830
Years of effort

475
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,350
only led to Zhang Yin.

476
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,510
If not for Your Highness recognizing

477
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,660
that Eastern Palace advisor
among the mob,

478
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,580
we'd never have suspected

479
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,140
the Crown Prince

480
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,620
was behind the Qingzhou arson.

481
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,390
Now, Mei Lin's assassination attempt

482
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,550
exposes the Momai on her.

483
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,740
It'll eventually trace back
to Zhang Yin's Momai Warriors.

484
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,170
All we need to do

485
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,650
is wait for Zhang Yin to make his move.

486
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,500
If he silences Mei Lin,

487
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:45,130
he'll bear the blame
for this assassination.

488
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,290
Unable to shoulder such a charge,

489
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,540
he'll turn to the Crown Prince.

490
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:51,540
And the Crown Prince,

491
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,690
to protect himself,

492
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,060
will discard Zhang Yin.

493
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,170
Zhang Yin then has but one option

494
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,940
to accuse the Eastern Palace.

495
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,100
Though his confession

496
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:06,330
won't topple the Crown Prince,

497
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,730
it will sow seeds of doubt

498
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,420
in our father's heart.

499
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:11,380
Then we'll have grounds

500
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,730
to investigate
the Qingzhou affair openly.

501
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,380
Someone reported

502
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,500
Zhang Yin waited hours outside prison

503
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,650
but never saw the Crown Prince.

504
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,610
Zhang Yin values profit over loyalty.

505
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,100
A good dog

506
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,860
when in favor,

507
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,690
but a deadly one

508
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,330
when betrayed.

509
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,210
The Crown Prince won't see him,

510
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:34,540
he'll surely

511
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,610
silence Mei Lin himself.

512
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:38,690
Your Highness,

513
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,810
the Crown Prince wants you
to visit the prison.

514
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,540
It seems Big Brother has guessed

515
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,060
Mei Lin was a bait I laid.

516
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,250
As ever, Your Highness,
your strategy is sound.

517
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,580
The Shadow Works was founded

518
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,100
to gather truths of old,

519
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,460
and now executes

520
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,500
the Momai plan.

521
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,380
Only Mei Lin

522
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,290
bears the Momai poison.

523
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,900
Even under torture,

524
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:04,860
it will be traced solely to Zhang Yin.

525
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:39,380
Did she confess?

526
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:40,210
No,

527
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,690
she hasn't uttered a word.

528
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,250
No rush.

529
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,540
Once she's been through everything,

530
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,380
even her iron will shall break.

531
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,250
With these tools of torture
at our disposal,

532
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,810
any secrets she holds

533
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,940
will be revealed as we wish.

534
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,730
Whether she speaks,

535
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,290
or what she says,

536
00:37:59,020 --> 00:37:59,730
no longer matters.

537
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,690
True enough.

538
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,250
To withstand such torture,

539
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,020
she never said a thing.

540
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,170
This shows something.

541
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,460
You're right.

542
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,170
She's no mere Xiyan beauty

543
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:32,730
but a trained assassin.

544
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,250
The mark on her arm

545
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,980
tells of her fate
in the hands of Momai poison.

546
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,610
How do you know this so clearly?

547
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,330
It's not hard to obtain the poison.

548
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,290
But as to who slipped it to her,

549
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:51,170
only she holds the key to that mystery.

550
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,420
Why haven't you spoken yet?

551
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:55,940
Waiting for an antidote?

552
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,100
Your master deceived you.

553
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,770
There is no antidote.

554
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,250
Who ordered you to attack Prince Jing?

555
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,100
Speak.

556
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,170
No one ordered me.

557
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,610
Hold.

558
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,500
Reveal what you know,

559
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,940
and I'll grant you a quick death.

560
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,130
A quick death

561
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,610
is mercy.

562
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,500
But after all you've suffered,

563
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,140
how could I show her mercy?

564
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,550
If I granted her quick death,

565
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,620
how would I account to Father?

566
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,260
I

567
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,100
cannot die.

568
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,830
An attempted assassination in the court

569
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,910
will only lead to your execution.

570
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,220
From the start,

571
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,470
you were someone's pawn,

572
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,390
dead the moment you failed.

573
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,580
To imagine otherwise is folly.

574
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,580
Brother, don't waste time on her.

575
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,470
She won't reveal what you seek.

576
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,030
She's merely a tool

577
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:20,910
who knows nothing of her master.

578
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,950
[Prince Jing's Mansion]

579
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:46,580
Minister Zhang,

580
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,300
how was the show

581
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:50,470
I arranged for you?

582
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:52,830
Your Highness, I don't get it.

583
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,620
Please enlighten me.

584
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,510
In the 14th year of the Zhaoming era,

585
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,580
when we first met,

586
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,390
you were but
a minor border patrol officer.

587
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,350
Now, a decade later,

588
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,550
you are the Minister of Defense,

589
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,660
leaping six ranks in ten years.

590
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,620
Tell me,

591
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,620
what kind of lucky streak
have you been riding on?

592
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,260
I am unworthy, Your Highness.

593
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:20,470
It's all thanks

594
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,740
to your heroic deeds
in recovering Qingzhou.

595
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,660
When Qingzhou's battle began,

596
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,580
you dismissed me for cowardice.

597
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,510
But when Weibei Army suffered defeat,

598
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,070
I survived and gained my fortune.

599
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,260
Yet I, as their general, still live.

600
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,470
Weibei Army
won't bear this shame in vain.

601
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,990
However lucky streak
you may have been riding on,

602
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,390
if the tide turns,

603
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,870
you'll end up in hot water.

604
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,870
As someone I hate,

605
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:56,220
guess what will happen to you?

606
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:00,830
Your Highness,

607
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:02,780
I don't understand.

608
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:04,030
Please enlighten me.

609
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,070
She's no mere beauty.

610
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,740
She's a death warrior
with the Momai poison in her.

611
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,780
Momai Warriors.

612
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,100
I encountered them

613
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,700
in Qingzhou.

614
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:27,660
Your Highness,

615
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,390
I have no ties to this woman.

616
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,510
The prison's methods

617
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,830
are effective,

618
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,180
but a prince's assassination,

619
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:48,740
not even your master

620
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:51,070
could afford the consequences.

621
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,700
If things go south for your benefactor,

622
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:54,740
your fate is clear:

623
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:56,660
be silenced,

624
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,180
or be the scapegoat.

625
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:02,830
You know I lost a whole bunch
of my best men.

626
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,510
So, whether you survive or not

627
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,870
depends on my mood.
