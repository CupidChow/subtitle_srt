00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,560
Your Highness,

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,510
the identities
of those ten burned Beauties

21
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,710
have already been forged.

22
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,760
Once General Yin discovers
these irregularities,

23
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,710
she will naturally suspect Prince Jing.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,470
Your Highness,

27
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,080
you asked me to investigate those

28
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,750
who visited Fufang Pavilion
during the Shangsi Festival.

29
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,910
Here is the list.

30
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,630
The nobles were all there
to watch the fire dragon dance.

31
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,120
No other irregularities were found.

32
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,470
I still feel

33
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,840
that Jinghe's visit to Fufang Pavilion
on Shangsi Festival

34
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,840
wasn't about watching
the fire dragon dance.

35
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,400
He had another purpose.

36
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,910
Your Highness, are you worried

37
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,430
that someone in the court

38
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,710
has already secretly pledged allegiance
to Prince Jing?

39
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,240

40
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,030

41
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,910
at Fufang Pavilion individually.

42
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,960
I want to know

43
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,150
who Jinghe met and what he ate.

44
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:57,710
Also,

45
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,910

46
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,030

My failure to gain access
to the interior of the mine

50
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,030
was a dereliction of duty on my part.

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,800

Don't alert the enemy.

My Lord,

57
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,120
on the day of the Shangsi Festival,
the Crown Prince already had suspicions.

58
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,240
I'm afraid

00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,710

can't be kept secret anymore.

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,030
Besides,

61
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,430
the Eastern Palace
has already sent some people

62
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,960
to keep an eye on Miss Mei Lin
at the Court of State Ceremonial

63
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,870
and has also dispatched some men
to investigate Fufang Pavilion.

to keep it hidden,

66
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,560
to protect Li Qing.

67
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,520
Ideally, make the Crown Prince believe

68
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,470
that my sole purpose on Shangsi Festival

69
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,680
was to accompany Mei Lin

70
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,150
to watch the fire dragon dance.

71
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,030
This way, both witnesses
will be protected.

72
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,710
Everyone believes that you dote
on Miss Mei Lin.

73
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,870
How could anyone become suspicious?

74
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,960
Could it be that Miss Mei Lin didn't act
convincingly and revealed a flaw?

75
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,560
She is a killer.

76
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,080
Naturally, she's not skilled at acting.

77

my whereabouts on Shangsi Festival.

78

I will

79

the festival with her,

83

or boxing?

Continue to practice.

I'll visit the Court of State Ceremonial
frequently recently.

91

the Crown Prince's suspicions,

92
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,000
it can at least

93
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,160
buy us some time.

94
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,830
Since Miss Mei Lin isn't good at acting,

95
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,510

After you go back to Xiyan this time,

188
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,550
we will never meet again, won't we?

189
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,120
We will meet again.

190
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,870
I promise you

191
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,120
I will come back to Zhaojing to see you.

192
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,150
Really?

193
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:23,840
Of course.

194
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,510
But you lied to me before.

195
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,440
When our mother passed away,

196
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,200
you clearly promised me

197
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,550
no matter what happened,

198
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,320
you would stay by my side.

199
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,630
Sir,

200
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,390
it's time

201
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,440
to set off.

202
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,360
Wait a while longer.

203
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,910
Chagu said

204
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,750
the princess was really angry this time.

205
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,360
She said it was a good thing
you were leaving.

206
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,910
No one would discipline her anymore.

207
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,240
She could do anything she wanted.

208
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,630
Sir,

209
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,390
how can you still laugh?

210
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,790
Ziyu is always watching her
and telling on her.

211
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,200
She wouldn't dare to do
anything out of line.

212
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:15,790
Liar.

213
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,200
Big liar.

214
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,390
Your Highness,

215
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,840
Mr. Yue Qin is about to go to Great Yan.

216
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,200
If you don't go now, it'll be too late.

217
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,030
I won't go.

218
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,870
I swore to the gods last night.

219
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,270
If he really leaves,

220
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,600
I will never forgive him.

221
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,720
She has always been

222
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,030
this childish,

223
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,360
acting on her whims and moods.

224
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,390
When our mother passed away,

225
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,320
she was only eight.

226
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,320
I've been strict in teaching her

227
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,480
to be more mature and sensible,

228
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,240
hoping she'll grow up faster

229
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,240
and avoid causing trouble.

230
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,670
But now I'm leaving.

231
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,870
I can't protect her anymore.

232
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,120
Now, I don't

233
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,120
want her to grow up.

234
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:03,910
Am I

235
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,120
very greedy?

236
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,030
Let's go.

237
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,000
Mr. Yue Qin is really leaving.

238
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,670
Brother,

239
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,960
don't go!

240
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,910
Brother,

241
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,870
don't go!

242
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,600
Chagu,

243
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,390
I have no mother now.

244
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,000
I've also lost my brother.

245
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,680
I thought that if I went
to plead with Father,

246
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,480
kneeling for three days and nights,

247
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,160
or seven days if that didn't work,

248
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,510
and even if it meant getting beaten,

249
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,400
you would always find a way

250
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,310
as you did before.

251
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,880
I thought if I was angry,

252
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,590
you would not leave.

253
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,200
It was my fault.

254
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,110
I know that back then,

255
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,350
if it weren't for you going
as a Hostage Prince,

256
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,270
it would have been me going
for a peace-making marriage.

257
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,510
Actually, I lied to the gods.

258
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,070
I forgave you long ago.

259
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,070
Zigu,

260
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,070
I promise you

261
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,440
I won't lie to you again.

262
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,590
I've grown up.

263
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,550
It's my turn to protect you now.

264
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,270
Okay.

265
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,220
[Yanming Palace]

266
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,350
You have played go with me
these past few years,

267
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,110
but only today have you shown

268
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,510
your true strength.

269
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,750
I concede defeat
from the bottom of my heart.

270
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,920
Winning this half-move
against Your Majesty

271
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,510
has already taken all my effort.

272
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,880
I'm flattered, Your Majesty.

273
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,750
There's no need for modesty.

274
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,000
When it comes to the art of go in Xiyan,

275
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,480
as long as you put your heart into it,

276
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,440
there's no game you can't win.

277
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,510
I want to win.

278
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,400
But to win,

279
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,550
I have to rely on the go style

280
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,160
I've learned from Your Majesty
over the years.

281
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,000
The majesty of Great Yan's ruler

282
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,590
is the key to victory.

283
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,110
Have you really come around?

284
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,960
If I still don't understand,

285
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,110
wouldn't I be failing to live up
to Your Majesty's kindness?

286
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,310
Why have you only developed

287
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,480
great ambitions today?

288
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,270
Your Majesty, you can see

289
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,310
I'm not an ambitious man.

290
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,750
Your Majesty, you're wise

291
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,070
and are willing
to provide me with support

292
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,110
​for the long-standing peace
between Great Yan and Xiyan.

293
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,480
The reason I want to win

294
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,110
is to protect those around me.

295
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,240
Your Majesty, you have said

296
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,830
Concubine Yan

297
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,480
is a symbol of peace
between the two nations.

298
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,240
As long as Great Yan and Xiyan
maintain good relations,

299
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,440
Her Highness

300
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,350
can live out her days peacefully
in Great Yan.

301
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,440
The Emperor does not speak lightly.

302
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,790
I'm quite moved

303
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,270
by the affection
between you and Concubine Yan.

304
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,640
Liu Zhong,

305
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:14,830
the gift list.

306
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,790
These are gifts prepared for you

307
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,720
by Concubine Yan for your return home.

308
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,960
She constantly talks to me

309
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,830
about what you like and dislike,

310
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,350
always worried that your journey
might be difficult

311
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,790
and that you might suffer along the way.

312
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,070
Her Highness may be impulsive,

313
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,400
but she is

314
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,750
ultimately someone without guile.

315
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,750
If there are

316
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,240
any improper actions in the future,

317
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,310
I hope Your Majesty will show mercy.

318
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,790
Someone as genuine as Concubine Yan

319
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,750
is rare in the imperial harem.

320
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,550
I wish for her

321
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,920
to remain forever innocent.

322
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,550
Mei,

323
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,510
happy birth...

324
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,640
These are all given by Prince Jing?

325
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,310
This piece of clothing is so heavy

326
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,400
and it's not really gorgeous.

327
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,880
I thought Prince Jing
was deeply in love with you.

328
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,400
How could he be so petty?

329
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,750
There is not even
a golden swaying ornament.

330
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,200
Mei doesn't wear those things.

331
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,550
I think Prince Jing is thoughtful.

332
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,640
Gold Silk Armor.

333
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,880
Wound powder.

334
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,790
They're all bottles of medicine.

335
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,070
Isn't Prince Jing cursing Mei
to get hurt?

336
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,680
Prince Jing can even
see such a small wound.

337
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,830
Now, I kind of believe in him.

338
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,480
I don't think his feelings
toward Mei are feigned.

339
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,070
Don't misjudge him.

340
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,270
It's fine if we misjudge him.

341
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,350
As long as Mei doesn't misjudge him.

342
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,680
What do you think, Mei?

343
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,200
Me?

344
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,550
Prince Jing speaks with a mix
of truth and falsehood.

345
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,270
Actually,

346
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,720
​I can't often see through him either.

347
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,350
Scar-removing cream.

348
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,200
This is the scar-removing cream
from the Xinfang Garden.

349
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,270
It's just for noble ladies

350
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,640
and is never sold publicly.

351
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,270
Mei,

352
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,750
you have so many bottles.

353
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,000
Can you give me one?

354
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,440
What happened to you?

355
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,480
Did you get hurt?

356
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,640
I accidentally hurt my arm
a few days ago.

357
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,920
The scar is very big and ugly.

358
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,960
It's not on your face.

359
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,880
It's not a big deal.

360
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,000
What do you know?

361
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,030
I'm going to serve the Crown Prince.

362
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,920
I can have no scar on my body.

363
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:37,880
Jia,

364
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,310
must you go to the Eastern Palace?

365
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,960
It's just her wish.

366
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,000
We don't get to choose.

367
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,480
Well,

368
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,350
with my pretty face,

369
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,680
I'm sure the Crown Prince
will be interested in me.

370
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,200
Mei,

371
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,680
did you do that with Prince Jing?

372
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,640
Do what?

373
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,480
The thing people do
when they get undressed.

374
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,720
Get undressed?

375
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,350
Why do we do that?

376
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:01,920
Sit.

377
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,790
You haven't done it, right?

378
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,270
Then it's useful for you.

379
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,640
Well...

380
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,400
How can you give her this

381
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,750
on her birthday?

382
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,640
Didn't you say gifts
should be practical?

383
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,590
This is the most practical.

384
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,510
Jia,

385
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,480
today is my birthday.

386
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,920
I haven't celebrated my birthday
for many years.

387
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,160
Thank you for being with me.

388
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,110
When you enjoy your life
in Prince Jing's Mansion,

389
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,160
don't forget about me.

390
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,640
Please don't forget about me either.

391
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,680
How can I forget about you?

392
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:46,680
Let's go

393
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,640
pick the gifts.

394
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:48,400
Okay.

395
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,440
Pick the gifts.

396
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,550
Pick the gifts.

397
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,200
Sir.

398
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,790
Miss Mei Lin,

399
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:00,790
happy birthday!

400
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:02,960
Thank you, Sir.

401
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,590
I've heard

402
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,270
when Qingzhou people
celebrate their birthdays,

403
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,680
they eat Dengguo Cakes.

404
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,720
I've added

405
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,270
mountain licorice

406
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,440
in the Dengguo Cakes.

407
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,200
Try them.

408
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,070
It won't be sour.

409
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,440
Actually, today is not my birthday.

410
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,000
It turns out

411
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,240
the birth dates in the list of Beauties
for the marriage alliance are incorrect.

412
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,480
Well...

413
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,350
Who said I can't eat Dengguo Cakes
if it's not my birthday?

414
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,550
I can eat the Dengguo Cakes
you made for me

415
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,030
until tomorrow.

416
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,310
Mei Lin, sit.

417
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,070
Actually,

418
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,440
even if today is not your birthday,

419
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,550
I have something to tell you.

420
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,830
This jade ring

421
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,030
is something I keep close to me.

422
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,550
If anything happens to you in Zhaojing,

423
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,270
you can go to Mr. Huang

424
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,680
in Tianxiang Tower with this.

425
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,680
This man's influence in Zhaojing
is complex and extensive.

426
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,270
He can surely help you.

427
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,030
You've already helped me a lot.

428
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,270
Mr. Yue Qin, you are
a rule-abiding person.

429
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,590
How can you disturb my woman

430
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,880
in the middle of the night?

431
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,070
There's no need to act

432
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,680
in front of me.

433
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,160
You are merely
in a cooperative relationship.

434
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,350
How do you know there won't be a day

435
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,440
when our fake relationship
becomes real?

436
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,590
Mei Lin is a sincere person

437
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,960
and would not seek genuine feelings
in a pretense.

438
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,070
If you're not meant
to walk the same path,

439
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,200
don't pursue the destiny
of traveling together.

440
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,400
Miss Mei Lin,

441
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,550
There are too many so-called companions

442
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,920
who will stab you in the back
in this world.

443
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,110
Only Mei and I

444
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,400
share joys and sorrows

445
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,510
and face life and death together.

446
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,240
Sir,

447
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,350
rest assured.

448
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:36,350
I won't entrust my life
to anyone easily.

449
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,310
Let me remind you,

450
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,440
what you need to do

451
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,240
is in Xiyan.

452
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,070
Everything else is a waste of effort.

453
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:54,920
Today

454
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,750
is Mei's birthday.

455
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,750
If you are still interested,

456
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,400
you may join us

457
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,270
on our journey.

458
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,750
Is this your first time on a boat?

459
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:02,960
No.

460
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:06,070
When I was a kid, my father
took me boating on the lake.

461
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,000
When I was younger,

462
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,960
I went to the northern borders
of Great Yan for battle.

463
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,480
When sailing down the Lancang River,

464
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,830
I saw a blue starry river.

465
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,830
That's the most beautiful scenery

466
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,000
I've ever seen.

467
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,830
How could there be a blue starry river
on the Lancang River?

468
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,720
It was caused by the gathering
of mayflies in the river.

469
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,200
There is a legend

470
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,070
about that blue starry river.

471
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,240
Once upon a time,

472
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,510
there was a bird fairy clad
in a blue-feathered divine robe

473
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,070
who was enchanted by the scenery
of Yuqing Mountain

474
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,590
and transformed into a maiden.

475
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,640
She was playing there

476
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,720
when a young boy happened to pass by.

477
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,590
The two fell in love at first sight.

478
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,240
In order to stay with the young boy
in the mortal world,

479
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,920
she cast the blue-feathered divine robe
into the river

480
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,240
and it became the blue starry river.

481
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,110
However, Lancang River is too far away.

482
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,680
So I moved the blue starry river here

483
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,790
for you.

484
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,160
I want you to see

485
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,440
the most beautiful scenery

486
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,310
I've ever seen.

487
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,270
There is a legend by the Lancang River

488
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,920
that if mortals see the starry river,
they can be together forever.

489
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,270
Prince Jing must be deeply in love
with Mei Lin.

490
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,750
I don't think there is anything special
about Mei Lin.

491
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,110
She is just pretty.

492
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,310
I think General Yin is most suitable
for Prince Jing.

493
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,110
Those are just old stories
from the past.

494
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,960
They actually compare

495
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,160
that petite Beauty to you.

496
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,590
♪If life is♪

is your birthday after all.

499
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,030
Only by doing this

500
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,200
will the Crown Prince
not become suspicious.

501
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,300

Other people's comments
have nothing to do with me.

504
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,640
I'm tired now.

505
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,110
Investigate the Xiyan spies

506
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,750
carefully tomorrow.

507
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,160
Your Highness,

508
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,680
Prince Jing had some his men

509
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,110
take back these mayflies
from Lancang River.

510
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,920
The news of Prince Jing's favor
toward Mei Lin has spread

511
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,880
throughout the Court of State Ceremonial
in these past few days.

512
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,110
In order to deceive me,

513
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,030
he has to deceive the people
in the Court of State Ceremonial.

514
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,960
What did the shopkeeper
in Fufang Pavilion say?

515
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,030
He said on the day
of the Shangsi Festival,

516
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,350
Prince Jing met with a lot of people.

517
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,750
I will have to question them one by one.

518
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,480
It is now past midnight.

519
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,550
Today

520
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,830
is your real birthday.

521
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:54,720
My Lord,

522
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,000
how did you know that?

523
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,720
You are not a real peace-making Beauty.

524
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:03,030
The birth date on the name list
is certainly fake.

525
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,640
You are cooperating with me.

526
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,640
It's very easy for me to know about you.

527
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,640
Knowing your birthday
is nothing strange.

528
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,030
This Dengguo Cake
must be very delicious.

529
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:28,920
Whether it's delicious or not,

530
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,640
you'll have to wait
until your tongue is cured

531
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:31,960
to judge.

532
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
You said it.

533
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,750
The flavors of life

534
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,550
don't necessarily have to be tasted
with the tongue.

535
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,640
I can also enjoy them with my eyes.

536
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,240
Look.

537
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,750
This Dengguo Cake is so beautiful.

538
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,110
It must be very delicious.

539
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,030
The imperial physician said

540
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,790
it wasn't difficult to cure your tongue.

541
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,480
As long as you take medicine on time,

542
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,310
you'll be cured.

543
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,680
My mansion recently hired a chef
from Qingzhou.

544
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,070
It's said that he has a secret method

545
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,240
to make Dengguo Cakes.

546
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,550
Whether the chef is a good one or not,

547
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,400
we'll have to wait
until your sense of taste recovers

548
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,920
to judge.

549
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,280
The Dengguo Cakes he makes

550
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,230
must be less tasty than the ones
made by my mother.

551
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,800
When the Xiyan people were in Qingzhou,

552
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,230
the neighbors in Qinglin Lane
