The Red Fruits are sweet.

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,640
The wheat is fragrant.

Tianjing Grass fills the storehouse.

The Red Fruits are sweet.

23
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,310
The wheat is fragrant.

24
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,510
Tianjing Grass fills the storehouse.

25
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,960
Can't you chop the filling?

26
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,120
You have greater strength.

27
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,310
Actually, it's my first time
making Meat Dragons.

28
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:35,910
Don't worry.

29
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,400
I've already made it known

30
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,590
that my wife and I will make sure
it's cooked,

31
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,400
despite the taste.

32
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,750
Don't add too much of this old dough,

33
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,430
or it will turn sour.

34
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,360
I didn't add much.

35
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,520
You are using too much strength.

36
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,120
You have greater strength
than the cook in my army.

37
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,240
You'll make the dough too hard.

38
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,910
You are covering it now?

39
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,000

If you don't add alkali water,
it'll turn sour.

Murong Jinghe,

43
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,280
go burn the wood.

44
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,800
Burn the wood.

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,960
You have greater strength than me.

46
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,080
I just have great strength.

47
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,310
My mother said that I have been strong
since I was a child.

48
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,870
She was always worried

49
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,800
that I would drive away my husband

50
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,280
who we'd get with great effort.

51
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,840
What kind of son-in-law

52
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,400
would your mother like?

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He should be nice
and have a good temper.

54
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,630
He should be able to help my father
with his work.

55
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,430
He should know how to read and write

56
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,310
so that he can teach our kids.

57
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,430
He'd better be able to help
with the accounts for the shop.

58
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,030
My father was a rough man.

59
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,840
My mother always complained
that he couldn't keep the books right.

60
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,630
Your mother wasn't looking
for a son-in-law.

61
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,800
It's more like she was hiring a laborer.

62
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,520
What about you?

63
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,680

00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,400
Me?

65
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,870
I haven't thought about it.

66
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,590
As long as my mother could be satisfied.

67
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,630
It's much more delicious
than the dragon meat I cooked.

68
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,560
You are better than me.

69
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,920
Erniu's mother said

70
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,720
you can do needlework
and look after children.

71
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,600
She says you are very capable.

72
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,120
My wife,

73
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,240
you know martial arts

74
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,040
and can make Meat Dragons.

75
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,120
You're also very capable.

76
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,510
There is flour on your face.

77
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,600
On your hair, too.

78
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,870
I'll clean it.

79
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,070
Let me help you.

80
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,600
What about you?

81
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,560
What?

82
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,480
What

83
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,390
kind of wife would you like?

84
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,920
My wife...

85
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,480
I haven't thought much about it.

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,870
At that time,

87
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,430
I had my heart set on going to war

88
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,750
and even made a bold vow

89
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,720
that I would not get married

90
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:12,870
until I defeated Xiyan.

91
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,680
The Empress must be very worried

92
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,600
about your marriage.

93
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,870
Indeed.

94
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,750
Later, I couldn't refuse
my mother any longer,

95
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,510
so I agreed to get married.

96
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,430
At that time, I thought

97
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,560
I must find someone I didn't like

98
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,870
to be my wife.

99
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,870
Someone you don't like?

100
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,720
Without feelings or love,
there will be no attachments.

101
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,360
Only in this way

102
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,040
can I be fearless and selfless
on the battlefield.

103
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,630
Your wife is so pitiful.

104
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,000
However,

105
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,360
later, someone changed my mind.

106
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,870
I now feel

107
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,270
that love

108
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,270
is both a weakness

109
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,630
and armor.

110
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,270
Having someone you want to protect

111
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,190
gives you the strength

112
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,800
to survive on the battlefield.

113
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,310
Regardless of whether I can
go to war in the future,

114
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,310
when choosing a wife,

115
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,070
I want to choose someone I truly love.

116
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
Don't you want to ask me

117
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,720
what type of woman I like?

118
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,390
What type of woman

119
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,480
do you like?

120
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,190
I like

121
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,950
a good woman.

122
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,120
She's a good person who would rather
harm herself

123
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,750
than let an innocent suffer.

124
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,160
Her personality is resilient

125
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,390
and stubborn.

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,920
Once she makes up her mind,

127
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,240
she will never give up.

128
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,390
Her words and actions

129
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,600
are straightforward

130
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,750
and sincere.

131
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,000
Her frown

132
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,240
and her smile

133
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,680
can easily get to me.

134
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,270
She is the most special woman

135
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,560
in this world.

136
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,480
She knows martial arts,

137
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,040
how to embroider,

138
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,870
and how to make Meat Dragons.

139
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,680
She

140
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,510
won't give in to me on everything.

141
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,200
She can be quite fierce

142
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,320
when we argue.

143
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,720
You know

144
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,320
I hate to lose

145
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,440
the most.

146
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,320
But I'm willing

147
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,550
to lose to her for the rest of my life.

148
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,440
Sir,

149
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,480
are the Meat Dragons ready?

150
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,080
Yes.

151
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,390
Brat,

152
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,000
you really picked a good time.

153
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,320
The harvest banquet is about to begin.

154
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,240
Hurry up.

155
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,870
Come on.

156
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,000
Cheers.

157
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,150
Cheers!

158
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,750
Bottoms up.

159
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,510
Come on. Bottoms up!

160
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,000
Here.

161
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,080
Here. Try this.

162
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,000
I'll pour you some wine.

163
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,320
Thank you.

164
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,910
Don't talk for now.

165
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,550
I've said

166
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,840
all I want to say.

167
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,080
Previously, I felt they were strange.

168
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,600
They don't look like siblings.

169
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,670
It turns out the couple had a quarrel.

170
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,910
They reconciled a long time ago.

171
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,960
Couples don't hold grudges
for long, right?

172
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,910
Right.

173
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,440
Wei,

174
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,320
Madam.

175
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,510
Take a seat.

176
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,360
Are these Meat Dragons?

177
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,320
Wei,

178
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,910
did you brew the Red Fruit Wine
yourself?

179
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:33,670
Yes.

180
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,550
This wine is very sweet. Try it.

181
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:45,790
Here.

182
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,630
Give it to me.

183
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,670
You have a weak spleen and stomach.

184
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,750
When you recover,

185
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,480
I'll drink with you.

186
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:53,790
See?

187
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,600
Big boy,

188
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,600
I'll drink to you.

189
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,720
Actually, you have very good taste.

190
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:02,790
However,

191
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,270
she is mine.

192
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,720
You are not allowed
to think about her anymore.

193
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,080
I've come around.

194
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,360
I won't compete with you
for Mei Lin anymore.

195
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,750
You are no match for me.

196
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,240
Sir, Miss,

197
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,630
I'll drink to you.

198
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,440
I will repay the life-saving grace

199
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,720
of you two.

200
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,360
I'll drink up.

201
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,790
It's the right thing to do.

202
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,320
Yeah.

203
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,030
Good.

204
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,080
Mei Lin,

205
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,870
your husband can make Meat Dragons.

206
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,510
He is really skilled in cooking.

207
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,440
Actually, I didn't make
the Meat Dragons.

208
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,720
My wife did.

209
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,670
I only needed to burn the wood.

210
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,440
Look.

211
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,790
Mei Lin, your husband is really nice.

212
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,960
You have the best taste
in choosing a husband.

213
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,030
Madam, she didn't pick me.

214
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,510
My mother-in-law did.

215
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,360
I'm their live-in husband.

216
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,270
Her mother has the final say

217
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,670
about the choice
of her live-in son-in-law.

218
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,720
He is good at putting on an act.

219
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,480
It's hard to tell whether his words
and actions are true or false.

220
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,600
Don't let him fool you.

221
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,790
Look at them.

222
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,870
Do you still think

223
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,320
I'm putting on an act now?

224
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,670
When they first came to our village,

225
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,790
this girl simply wouldn't let go
of his hand.

226
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,550
I asked her if he was her husband.

227
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,960
However, she said no.

228
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,240
It's like

229
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,550
birds of the same kind live together.

230
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,720
You are both good at putting on an act.

231
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,030
Am I right?

232
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,480
Yes.

233
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,670
You are right.

234
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,600
I can put on an act, too.

235
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,480
You brat are being naughty again.

236
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,320
I'll beat you.

237
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,670
Stop there!

238
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,320
Wei,

239
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,480
get us some more wine.

240
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,030
Okay.

241
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,550
Can I talk to her?

242
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,720
Mei Lin.

243
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,630
Madam.

244
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,910
Tell me the truth.

245
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,200
Are you satisfied with your husband?

246
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,630
He has

247
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,150
many shortcomings,

248
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,720
but he is a good guy.

249
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,840
He...

250
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,390
He treats me very well.

251
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,720
He's willing to give in
after an argument.

252
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
He...

253
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,840
Anyway, my mother should be satisfied
with him.

254
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,720
I'm asking you.

255
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,360
Why do you talk about your mother?

256
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,910
My mother is satisfied.

257
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,440
So am I.

258
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,630

We are catching fireflies.

290
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:30,870
Sir,

291
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,630
please take me with you.

292
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:33,750
Where to?

293
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:34,960
To the outside world.

294
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
I hate to be beaten.

295
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,870
I don't want to stay
in the Laowozi Village anymore.

296
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,600
Erniu,

297
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,150
there are many ferocious beasts outside.

298
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,720
They eat people.

299
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,840
Your mother beats you
because she wants to protect you.

300
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,670
Home is the safest place.

301
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,670
Why don't you go home?

302
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:52,870
Because we...

303
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,750
Because her parents

304
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,000
were eaten
by a ferocious man-eating beast.

305
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,440
So

306
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,550
we need to go outside
to catch that ferocious beast.

307
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,270
Only then can I give her a new home.

308
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,720
Sir,

309
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,600
you must catch that ferocious beast.

310
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:07,960
Don't worry.

311
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:09,910
Let's go.

312
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:10,870
Let's go.

313
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,070
I am really

314
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,160
not worth you wasting
any more effort on me.

315
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,030
Your Highness,

316
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,640
His Majesty's Imperial Guards

317
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,000
have been following us secretly.

318
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,920
Fortunately, Your Highness
made preparations in advance.

319
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,920
With the excuse
of seeking the culprit Mei Lin,

320
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,270
we can cover it up.

321
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,640
It's just that
with the Imperial Guards around,

322
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,200
we face many constraints in our actions.

323
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,880
It'll be harder to find Prince Jing.

324
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,720
Even if Prince Jing comes back,

325
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,160
the throne may not necessarily be his.

326
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,110
But Luomei

327
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,110
must be mine.

328
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:52,960
I want Father to grant me

329
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,310
the marriage of Luomei.

330
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,960
But how can His Majesty agree
to let Your Highness marry

331
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,920
a Crown Princess
who holds military power?

332
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,960
Besides, General Yin is...

333
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,510
It depends on what we make of it.

334
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,640
They have no other choice.

335
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,240
Send this to the Fengyi Palace.

336
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,640
I heard my aunt's headache

337
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,590
is getting more and more serious.

338
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,270
Her Highness' headache stems
from emotional distress.

339
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,310
Her Highness is worried
about your marriage,

340
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,350
but you are solely focused
on military affairs

341
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,790
and show no interest in getting married.

342
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,350
This dress

343
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,550
was custom-made for you
by the best embroiderer

344
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,160
in the tailor's workshop
at Her Highness's request.

345
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,480
If you are willing to wear
women's clothing for Her Highness,

346
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,200
it will alleviate
her headache considerably.

347
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,070
Okay.

348
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,240
Thank you, General.

349
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,960
Luomei, are you alright?

350
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,640
Luomei.

351
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,270
Luomei.

352
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,750
Wait.

353
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,030
I crossed the line just now.

354
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,310
My aunt did this.

355
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,160
She wants to force His Majesty
to grant the marriage.

356
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,110
General,

357
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,440
just forget

358
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,830
about what happened today.

359
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,750
Don't feel pressured.

360
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,750
Your Majesty,

361
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,070
Fengyi Palace has just collected
lotus dew today.

362
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,830
It's best for making tea.

363
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:57,920
Stay here.

364
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,110
I'll deal with this.

365
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:03,830
Luomei,

366
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,000
don't worry.

367
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,070
I got this.

368
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,620
[Fengyi Palace]

369
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,400
Father.

370
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,270
Your Highness.

371
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,070
Your Highness,

372
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,030
where is Luomei?

373
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,480
Did you see her?

374
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,830
No.

375
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,200
Maybe I missed her.

376
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,160
Why are you here?

377
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,350
I heard Her Highness is sick.

378
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,030
So

379
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:41,830
I've come to see her.

380
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,270
Your Majesty,

381
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,030
I caught a cold at night recently.

382
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,510
I feel quite feeble.

383
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,720
I'm getting better now.

384
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:51,680
Your Majesty,

385
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,590
please come in.

386
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:57,960
I accidentally

387
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,510
broke Your Highness's screen.

388
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,000
Please go to another place to have tea.

389
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,680
Is Luomei inside?

390
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,880
Is there anything we can't see?

391
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,270
Xuanlie,

392
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:13,960
go to Yanming Palace.

393
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,350
Why did he change the plan?

394
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,680
Luomei,

395
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:41,750
I...

396
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,110
Actually, you didn't have to do this.

397
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,720
Father,

398
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,830
I want to marry Yin Luomei.

399
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,350
Only she

400
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,270
can be my Crown Princess.

401
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,070
Rascal!

402
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,270
Your third brother has just passed away.

403
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:04,350
How can you...

404
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,590
The third Brother is dead.

405
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,310
Father, how much longer

406
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,720
will you keep thinking about him?

407
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:11,960
You!

408
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,960
You did it!

409
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,590
Yes.

410
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,480
I hate him

411
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,240
and I'm jealous of him.

412
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,030
All the things I strive for so hard,

413
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,720
including your favor

414
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,750
and Luomei's affection,

415
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,000
have been obtained by him effortlessly.

416
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,160
Yet he doesn't care at all.

417
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,440
I wish I could kill him
with my own hands.

418
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,680
But if he had really died in my hands,

419
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,400
it would ruin my reputation

420
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,880
and I would have no chance

421
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,750
to get what I want.

422
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,830
You suspect me.

423
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,880
I don't want to explain.

424
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,070
After we find Mei Lin
and interrogate her,

425
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,680
the truth will be revealed.

426
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,070
Everything was due to his own fault.

427
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,310
Xuanlie,

428
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,310
you've been sensible
since you were little.

429
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,640
Your third brother was mischievous,

430
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,160
When he got into trouble,
he'd seek your protection,

431
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,960
and you'd protect him.

432
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,400
I am aware that you suffered
many punishments because of this.

433
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,350
I had thought that the two of you

434
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,510
caring for each other was a good thing,

435
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,920
but in the end,
it still caused you suffering.

436
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,240
Father,

437
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,920
if I can marry Luomei,

438
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:36,960
all the suffering

439
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,790
would not matter.

440
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,590
You are the Crown Prince.

441
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,350
You will take the throne

442
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,350
and be the Emperor.

443
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,310
In the future, you will take
this dragon throne

444
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,680
and manage the affairs of the realm!

445
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,510
Indulging in personal emotions

446
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,000
will eventually lead to your downfall.

447
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,350
I know

448
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,510
what you are afraid of, Father.

449
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,240
Holding military power
by relatives of the Empress

450
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,720
has always been a great concern.

451
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,480
I did not forget

452
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,030
the lessons from the fall
of previous dynasties.

453
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,750
You may not believe in the loyalty
of the Yin family,

454
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,160
but you should at least trust me.

455
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,550
I will not allow anyone

456
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,070
to overthrow our Murong family's reign.

457
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,110
But I have granted Luomei

458
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,880
the freedom to choose a husband.

459
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,070
Luomei will agree sooner or later.

460
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:44,880
If I cannot even

461
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,880
win her heart,

462
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,350
how can I assure you

463
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,400
that the Great Yan's reign
will remain secure?

464
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,460
[Yanming Palace]

465
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,030
Your Highness,

466
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,680
I bear the responsibility

467
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,000
of the Yin family and the Pingnan Army.

468
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,480
It's okay now.

469
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,640
Don't worry.

470
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,750
No matter what my father says,

471
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,550
just follow your heart.

472
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,830
Actually, if my aunt hadn't done it,

473
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,480
I would write your name
in the imperial edict

474
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,030
for the arranged marriage.

475
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,480
I am a martial artist.

476
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,720
I don't quite understand love.

477
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,750
But I will strive to reciprocate

478
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,680
the genuine feelings you have shown me.

479
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,240
Your Highness,

480
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,830
why did you change the plan?

481
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:18,830
Your Highness,

482
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,720
just now,

483
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,070
Luomei agreed.

484
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,350
That was a smart scheme of yours.

485
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,590
You know how strong-willed Luomei is.

486
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,790
Using an aphrodisiac to force
intercourse with her

487
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,640
might provoke her rebellious nature.

488
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
What I want

489
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,350
has always been

490
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,480
her willingness.

491
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,640
Mr. Li,

492
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,440
it's been a while.

493
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,880
It's been a while.

494
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,440
I can help you
bring down the Crown Prince.

495
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,070
However,

496
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,920
I need to meet your master first.

497
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,400
Sir, His Majesty has withdrawn
all the Imperial Guards.

498
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,590
Those who are watching us now
are all the Crown Prince's men.

499
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,240
His Majesty wants to marry
General Yin into the Eastern Palace.

500
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,510
It seems

501
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,160
the Crown Prince has dispelled
His Majesty's doubts.

502
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,550
Send a secret message to Prince Jing

503
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,070
and wait for his order.

504
00:30:59,350 --> 00:30:59,680
Yes.

505
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,440
I guess I'll have to find my own way
back to the capital.

506
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,510
Little drunkard,

507
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,310
you can't drink anymore.

508
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,240
I know my own condition.

509
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,790
I'm happy these days.

510
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,030
I want to drink.

511
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,160
Well,

512
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,960
after we leave Laowozi Village,

513
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,510
will we have such happy days?

514
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,440
As long as it's a day you enjoy,

515
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,480
I am willing to spend it with you.

516
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,400
Well?

517
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,640
You don't believe it?

518
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,240
Qingyan says in the letter

519
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,830
that Li Qing has been cured.

520
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,110
We need to hurry back then.

521
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,510
There's no rush.

522
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,790
Qingyan has been targeted.

523
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:13,070
We may need to go back
to the capital by ourselves.

524
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,200
It's going to be a rough trip.

525
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,440
No trip can be more difficult
than the one in Zhongshan.

526
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,830
Li Qing is now the key witness.

527
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,550
Since he has been disposed of
after serving his purpose,

528
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,640
he must hate the Crown Prince
even more than we do.

529
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,160
In all,

530
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,200
when we go back to the capital,

531
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,830
we can bring down the Crown Prince.

532
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,400
After we bring down the Crown Prince,

533
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,200
when the situation is stable,

534
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,110
we will go back to Qingzhou together.

535
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,400
You'll open a fruit cake shop

536
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,830
and I'll be General Weibei.

537
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,200
In times of leisure,

538
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,790
we'll paint and do what we like.

539
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,830
In times of turmoil,

540
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,750
we'll wield our swords
to defend the country.

541
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,510
Would you like

542
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,350
such a life?

543
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,590
Yes.

544
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,790
Come back if you encounter
any difficulties outside.

545
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:28,510
Okay.

546
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,480
Come back to see us when you can.

547
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,440
Don't worry.

548
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,510
These days...

549
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,400
Erniu said
you've been to the battlefield.

550
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,110
I lied to him.

551
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,640
I don't dare to kill a chicken.
How can I kill men?

552
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,270
I dare

553
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,030
to kill a chicken.

554
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,310
Awesome.

555
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,960
Jinghe,

556
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,350
you wrote so many prescriptions for me.

557
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,480
Here is your reward.

558
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,720
Tianjing Grass can be eaten
and also used to treat illnesses.

559
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,880
It truly is a wonderful thing.

560
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,400
Thank you, doctor.

561
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,550
It's getting late.

562

Let's set off.

563
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,000
Go ahead.

564
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,200
Madam, we're leaving.

565
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,400
Take care.

566
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,280
There is someone behind us.

567
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:50,800
Wei.

568
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,150
I...

569
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,670
I will go with you.

570
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,710
I can protect you.

571
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,960
Why do you think I can't protect her?

572
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,150
You don't dare to kill a chicken,

573
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,400
but I dare.

574
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:06,880
Wei,

575
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,280
please go back.

576
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,510
We can protect ourselves.

577
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,440
I told you.

578
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,480
Since you saved my life,

579
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,920
I will repay you.

580
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,070
I have great strength.

581
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,400
I can help you.

582
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,030
How is it?

583
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:30,800
Wei,

584
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,150
you can't survive outside

585

relying solely on brute force.

586
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,760
You are smart,

587
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,760
so I'll follow you.

588
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,630
I want to see the outside world, too.

589
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:49,800
Wei,

590
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,840
can you pull up that tree?

591
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,440
That tree?

592
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:02,960
I can.

593
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:22,920
Let's go.

594
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,190
Do you think he has gone back?

595
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,360
Whether he goes back or not,

596
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,920
it's his choice.

597
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,360
We don't need to worry about him.

598
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,030
What are you picking?

599
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,630
Red Fruit seeds.

600
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,320
Don't you love them?

601
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,630
I'll grow them for you when we're back.

602
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,510
I've never seen these Red Fruits
in other places.

603
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,590
Could it be

604
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,630
they can only grow in the soil here?

605
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:07,630
It makes sense.

606
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,280
Let's bring some soil back.

607
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,150
The fruits will definitely
taste the same.

608
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,550
Let's make a bet.

609
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,070
If I can grow Red Fruits,

610
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,070
you will marry me.

611
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:26,960
I won't make a bet with you.

612
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,000
I won't be married off.

613
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,030
I'll just take a live-in husband.

614
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,670
My family won't agree, I'm afraid.

615
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,760
Unless you write a promise,

616
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,320
stating that you will always
admit defeat first

617
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,630
whenever we argue.

618
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,280
Didn't you say you are willing
to lose to me forever?

619
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,000
I'm willing to lose
to my princess forever.

620
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,000
Liar.

621
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,070
Alright now.

622

Let's get married
when we return to Qingzhou.

623
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,880
Anyway, Qingzhou is so far away.

624
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,000
My father can't interfere.

625
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,840
You need to first grow the Red Fruits.

626
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,630
Didn't you say you wouldn't
make a bet with me?

627
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:03,760
It's too late now.

628
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,000
Liar.

629
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:09,590

[Memorial to Empress Dejia of Great Yan]

Empress Dejia,

633
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,030
I am indebted to you.

634
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,190
As a father,

635
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,510
I believed I never owed Jinghe anything,

636
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,280
but it turns out I ended up harming him.

637
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,280
Maybe I

638
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,230
shouldn't have summoned Jinghe
back to the capital.

639
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,440
Everyone in the court believes that
I intended to change the heir.

640
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,400
I am the one who made Jinghe a target.

641
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,030
When it comes to the ruling,

642
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,670
Jinghe fell short compared to Xuanlie.

643
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,590
My choice was not wrong.

644
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,070
I had given him a chance,

645
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,960
but Qingzhou...

646
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,710
As an Emperor,

647
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,030
I treated him fairly.

648
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,360
Now, Jinghe has been buried.

649
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,440
As for

650
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,670
who killed him,

651
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,150
I don't want to know,

when I first ascended the throne,

your Yuchi family served with merit.

657

Jinghe suffered such a calamity

658
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,510
because I've broken my promise.

Her Highness is worried.

665
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,230
Tell Concubine Yan

666
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,590
to consider Mei Lin already dead,

667
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,670
