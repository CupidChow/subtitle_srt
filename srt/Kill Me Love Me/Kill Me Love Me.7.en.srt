and in doing so,

seeks accountability,

has long coveted Zhang Yin's position.

172
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,200

173
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:13,960
Yes.

174
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,030
How could he not care?

175
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,480
My lord.

176
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,600
My lord.

177
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,240
The Imperial Household Department
is deliberately making things difficult.

178
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,840
They don't want to lend us
Empress Dejia's embroidery guide at all.

179
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,670
You and I are from Xiyan.

180
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,200
The fact that they allowed me

181
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
to copy the guide

182
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,440
was already a rare exception.

183
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,630
But there's so much content,

184
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,670
you won't sleep tonight.

185
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,120
I'll prepare some food for you.

186
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,320
No need.

187
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,480
You've only just recovered

188
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,550
from a cold.

189
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,030
Get some rest early.

190
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,000
As long as you don't sleep,

191

wouldn't have been damaged...

It wasn't entirely for your sake.

They intended
to use Mother's embroidery as a trap.

If I hadn't acted first,

might have been destroyed.

So, investigating the mastermind

373
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,680
is also for the sake
of the King of Xiyan.

374
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,760
Moreover,
Mr. Yue Qin is still in Zhaojing.

375
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,520
This investigation

376
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,720
must be carried out in secret.

00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,070
Who do you think

378
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,310
is suitable for the task?

379
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,240
General Yin has fought
many campaigns against Xiyan.

380
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,800
She's familiar with the situation.

381
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,800
I believe

382
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,150
she's the right person for the job.

383
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,240
Your Highness.

384
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,960
Is General Yin still
at the West Suburbs Barracks?

385
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:29,550
Yes.

386
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,000
Let's go to the West Suburbs Barracks.

387
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,390
I may be slow,

388
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,480
but why not send our people
to investigate?

389
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,720
What if General Yin
sides with Prince Jing?

390
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,070
You don't know her.

391
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,390
When it comes to Great Yan,

392
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,800
she would never show favoritism.

393
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,590
But she's still clinging

394
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,680
to some childhood ties
she won't let go of.

395
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,870
It's time for me

396
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,070
to give her a little push.

The coachman was negligent
and deserves punishment.

This horse was a tribute from Xiyan.

not yet fully tamed, and still
they dared to let you ride it.

431
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,000
It's not their fault,
I insisted on riding it myself.

432
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,040
I nearly embarrassed myself,
General Yin.

433
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,000
I wouldn't dare.

did you win it from Jinghe?

440

This dagger was one
he snatched from me long ago.

441
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,310
I didn't expect it would end up
in your hands now.

442

But today, this dagger belongs to me,

I came today not just for a visit.

450
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,680
There's official business to discuss.

451
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,760
Someone has submitted a memorial,

452
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,150
claiming

453
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,720
they've discovered Xiyan spies
in Zhaojing.

454
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,520
Father is concerned
Xiyan might be planning something.

455
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,000
So, he wants you

456
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,180
to investigate this matter in secret.

457
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,000
Xiyan spies.

458
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,680
They must have infiltrated
through the delegation.

459
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:46,590
I suspect this is linked to Mingju
from the hawkish faction in Xiyan.

460
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,110
Are we

461
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,310

for the King of Xiyan?

462

I knew I had chosen the right person
for this task.

463

You've fought many battles
against Xiyan.

of both armies well.

is Jinghe.

behind the scenes,

between the two nations.

479

to matters of the state,

00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,600

it's part of a pair.
