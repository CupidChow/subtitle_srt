00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,790
Mei Lin!

20
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,350
Are you hurt?

21
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,840
Do you have any other injuries?

22
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,400
Prince Heir,

23
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,000
you don't have to worry.

24
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,120
I was just blinded by white moths.

25
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,560
It's my fault for being late.

26
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,680
Let's go.

27
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,590
Don't worry, Prince Heir.

28
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,910
Princess Heir's blindness is temporary.

29
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,630
The moth's wing dust

30
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
poisoned her eyes.

31
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,840
Luckily,
we applied medicine in the cave.

00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,150
her sight will fully recover.

35
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,030
Oh,

36
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,870
this cloth band

37
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,870
must be changed every half incense time.

38
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,080
Otherwise, the effect will wear off

39
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,800
and her recovery
will be greatly delayed.

40
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,910
Rest assured, Prince Heir.

41
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,520
I will watch over her all night

42
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,630
and change her cloth band.

43
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,630
I'll take care of her.

44
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,960
You may leave.

45
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,070
Prince Heir,

46
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,430
I've uncovered that

47
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,680
the mine incident

48
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,070
was Mingju's doing.

49
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,040
Mingju dared harm the Princess Heir!

50
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Summon the High Priest.

51
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,630
Yes.

52
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:48,800
Your Majesty.

53
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,240
Once trade resumes,

54
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,680
Xiyan's merchants will profit greatly,

55
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,270
and we could

56
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,360
build three more

57
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,070
Towers of Immortality.

58
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,480
What is this strange wind?

59
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,270
Your Majesty, it's the divine prophecy.

60
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,800
The dark sun is rising in the north.

61
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,800
The fire

62
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,510
won't go out.

63
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,390
It will cover the old days

64
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,870
and replace them.

65
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,360
What does this prophecy mean?

66
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,430
It's the sign
of Mars guarding the heart.

67
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,600
Your Majesty,

68
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,680
Mars signifies rebellion.

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,360
The Heart constellation
represents the emperor.

70
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,720
Mars guarding the heart

71
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,160
is an omen

72
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,950
of great misfortune,

73
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,040
foretelling defeat
and the fall of the ruler.

74
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,070
The dark sun is rising in the north.

75
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,190
North.

Your Majesty.

78
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,630
This is no ordinary omen.

79
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
Order Mingju

80
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,160
to transfer half his troops
to the Prince Heir's command

81
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,120
for building the Tower of Immortality.

82
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:32,800
Yes.

83
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,390

I can see now.

87
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,000
Thank you for taking care of me.

88
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,560
Did you find out

89
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,430
who caused the mine explosion?

90
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,310
Mingju sent people to do it.

91
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,480
Mingju.

92
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,390
He plotted against you?

93
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,510
Don't worry.

94
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,560
I've set a trap with the High Priest

95
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,600
to deal with Mingju.

96
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,720
Just now,

97
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,120
my father sent word.

98
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,040
He summoned me urgently back to Xiyan.

99
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,720
I'll return with you, Prince Heir.

100
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,240
You can't.

101
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,680
Border trade between our nations
has just begun.

102
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,600
One of us must stay

103
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,430
in Qingzhou.

104
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,920
Mingju failed once,

105
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,310
he might try again.

106
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,680
My father

107
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
has likely punished him,

108
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,270
so for now,

109
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,430
he won't act against me.

113
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,800
take care of yourself.

114
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,750
If anything happens,

115
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,920
send a pigeon.

116
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,630
You must be careful as well.

117
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,950
Let's go take a look.

118
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,160

Five wen.

120
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,600
And this one?

121
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,870
Also five wen.

122
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,320
Then I'll take this one.

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
This sachet is great
for repelling insects.

125
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,910
When I went into the mine last time,

126
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,510
after hanging these up,

127
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,030
the bugs all disappeared.

128
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:42,750
How much for this?

129
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,550
Five wen.

130
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:44,750
Shopkeeper,

131
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,480
could you make it cheaper?

132
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,750
Your wife shortchanged me last time.

133
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,150
I'm not the shopkeeper,

134
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,150
and she's not my wife.

135
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,840
You only got a discount
because you bought three.

136
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,240
Buy more,

137
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,240
and I'll reduce it

138
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,360
by one coin each.

139
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,750
Your wife drives a hard bargain.

140
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,460

- Alright, I'll take a look around.

Are you okay?

144
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,910
Much better after the medicine.

145

That's good.

146

Jia wanted to thank you,

157
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,320
but the Prince Heir said

158
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,150
it would disturb your rest.

thrown by the townspeople.

Why did you step on me?

168
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,720
You deserve it.

169
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,630

He's a good official,

173
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,150
but they won't believe it.

174
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,720
They won't even give him a name list.

Especially that old stonemason.

176

00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,670
How does a young girl like you know it?

193
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,390
Uncle Li.

194
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,600
Are you...?

195
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,080
Mei the stonemason's daughter,

196
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,510
Mei Lin.

197
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,030
The Mei family's daughter?

198
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,360
Little Mei!

199
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,790
You've grown so much!

200
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,510
Come on.

201
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,870
Sit down.

202
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,600
Take a seat.

203
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,960
The taverns on Water Street.

204
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,150
Father loved to come here after work.

205
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,320
Indeed.

206
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,910
Whenever the taverns closed,

207
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,480
your mother would bring you along

208
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,240
to pick him up.

209
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,670
Back then,

210
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,670
you were only this tall.

211
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,480
Little girl,

212
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,270
do you remember Yun?

213
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,440
She was born the same year as you.

214
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,440
If only...

215
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,910
She should be

216
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,030
as tall as you now.

217
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,720
Uncle Li.

218
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,910
Of course, I remember Yun.

219
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,080
Look,

220
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,080
there's the bridge.

221
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,600
When we were kids,

222
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,150
we used to play there all the time.

223
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,000
Yun

224
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,240
loved to play and eat.

225
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,150
I used to wonder

226
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,030
who would marry

227
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,270
such a playful girl.

228
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,720
But...

229
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,320
As her father,

230
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,750
I failed.

231
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,240
I couldn't protect her.

232
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,240
My father was burned alive
in front of me,

233
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,790
not even his bones were left.

234
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,320
I only survived

235
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,120
by crawling out of the mine

236
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,320
where he worked.

237
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,910
I always thought

238
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,030
I survived because I was lucky.

239
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,790
Then I realized,

240
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,670
that without the Weibei Army,

241
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,960
I wouldn't have lived.

242
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,440
But they were Qingzhou's enemies!

243
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,670
Weibei Army was wronged.

244
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,630
Our true enemy was Crown Prince,

245
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,150
Murong Xuanlie.

246
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,080
We've avenged ourselves.

247
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,870
I saw it!

248
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,200
The Weibei Army started the fire.

249
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,200
Girl,

250
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,120
don't be fooled by mass murderer's lies.

251
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,120
Those weren't real Weibei Armies.

252
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,150
Today's governor of Qingzhou

253
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,390
was General Weibei back then.

254
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,870
He ordered that

255
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,240
their blades should never
turn against civilians.

256
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,870
He led the army to protect Qingzhou

257
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,720
until the very last moment,

258
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,870
giving us the chance to escape.

259
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,150
The real Weibei Army,

260
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,840
along with the souls of Qingzhou's dead,

261
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,240
are buried in this land.

262
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,150
Over the years,

263
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,390
they've been falsely accused

264
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,080
and cursed by the people,

265
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,150
but they are Qingzhou's true heroes.

266
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,910
Did he

267
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,360
send you to say all this?

268
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,360
I'm speaking
for the deceased of Qingzhou.

269
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,630
Uncle Li.

270
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,510
With the monument

271
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,270
and the names carved on it,

272
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,600
they can find their way home.

273
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,910
Yun can come home, too.

274
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:06,550
Mr. Li!

275
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,840
The mass murderer's here again!

276
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,870
Sir,

277
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,720
the list for the Monument of the Masses
is only missing Qinglin Lane.

278
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,550
If you want to be
a governor of Qingzhou,

279
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,510
you must learn the craft.

280
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,440
Focus on the back half of the chisel

281
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,360
for better control.

282
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,670
Long cuts like this can be angled.

283
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:26,910
Strike boldly.

284
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,750
I'll carve the characters.

285
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,270
You write the names.

286
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,510
Qinglin Lane, Qingzhou.

287
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,640
He Mu.

288
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,070
Li Yun'er.

289
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,590
Li Jiang'an.

290
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,720
Guo Yu.

291
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,550
Wang Lihua.

292
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,640
Mei Dashan.

293
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,310
Liu Chunxi.

294
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,700
[Kangjian Street, Xiangyun Lane]

295
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,380
[Kangjian Street, Changqing Lane]

296
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,740
[Kindness Lane, Kangjian Street,]
[Xiangyun Lane, Qinglin Lane...]

297
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:19,920
Today marks ten years

298
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,510
since the Great Fire of Qingzhou.

299
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,350
Ten years ago,

300
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,640
my family's mistakes

301
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,310
caused a hundred thousand deaths.

302
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,510
Countless souls still cannot find peace.

303
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,550
The Qingzhou massacre

304
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,310
will haunt me for the rest of my life.

305
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,160
Failing to protect
the people of Qingzhou

306
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,030
was my greatest failure.

307
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,590
This monument

308
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,510
is a reminder

309
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,030
that the Murong family must atone.

310
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,830
I'll never forget

311
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,550
the names of those lost,

312
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,750
and neither

313
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,830
will Qingzhou

314
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,550
or Great Yan.

315
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,550
There are still names missing

316
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,920
from this monument.

317
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,640
The Weibei Army

318
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,960
defended Qingzhou

319
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,110
and gave their lives to protect it,

320
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,680
even though they were slandered,

321
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,550
their blades never turned against
civilians.

322
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,790
Those 13,000 soldiers' names

323
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,960
deserve to be engraved here as well.

324
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,510
All of us must remember

325
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,310
their names.

326
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,240
Yes.

327
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,720
If it weren't for the Weibei Army,

328
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,400
we'd still be bullied by Xiyan!

329
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,550
They were good men!

330
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,200
The Weibei Army didn't start the fire.

331
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,590
They were wronged!

332
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,350
The Weibei Army never harmed civilians.

333
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,240
But the civilians betrayed them.

334
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,880
Right.

335
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,310
She's telling the truth!

336
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,030
Will the Weibei Army

337
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,200
protect Qingzhou again?

338
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,200
The Weibei Army no longer exists.

339
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,790
There's no Weibei Army now.

340
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,000
But as long as you remember them,

341
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,510
then,

342
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,550
they live on.

343
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,720
I will carry on their legacy

344
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,830
and protect this land.

345
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:35,750
Qingzhou

346
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,400
remembers the Weibei Army.

347
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,880
The Weibei Army lives on!

348
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,590
The Weibei Army lives on!

349
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:11,510
One!

350
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,550
Two!

351
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,200
Three!

352
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,440
Four!

353
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,720
Five!

354
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,200
Six!

355
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:23,680
Seven!

356
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,590
Crown Prince Jinghe,

357
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,310
from governing Qingzhou,

358
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,110
promotes border trade

359
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,750
and cuts taxes,

360
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,510
bringing comfort far and wide.

361
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,240
Mines dug deep,

362
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,920
wealth in store,

363
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,550
bridging hearts

364
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,110
and minds once more.

365
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,880
Roads and bridges for all to tread.

366
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,510
By his hand, the people led.

367
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,160
Great his deeds, they bring me pride.

368
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,960
To his worth, none can hide.

369
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,000
Thus,

370
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,510
the Weibei Army's seal is returned

371
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,960
to Murong Jinghe, and honor is earned.

372
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,000
Rebuild the troops, with flag in hand.

373
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,680
- Porcelain!
- Rock candy hawthorn!

374
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,270
Come look at the porcelain!

375
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,070
Prince Heir.

376
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,270
The Prince Heir is waiting for you
in the council chamber.

377
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,160
The Prince Heir has returned?

378
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,240
Prince Heir.

379
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,070
Princess Heir.

380
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,270
We were sent by the King

381
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,160
to check on the border trade gains.

382
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,240
So you're from the King?

383
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,000
The tax records from the border trade

384
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,270
are all in order.

385
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,440
Thank you, Princess Heir.

386
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,160
We shall return immediately

387
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,350
to report to the King.

388
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:52,590
Prince Heir,

389
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,350
the King's Longevity Plan

390
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,310
requires lighting the lamp soon.

391
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,200
He has everything prepared

392
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,640
for tomorrow's climb
to Sun and Moon Kunluns.

393
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:10,640
Prince Heir,

394
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,350
what's the matter?

395
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,720
Mei Lin.

396
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,680
I must ask you for a favor of you.

397
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,310
The Prince Heir's border trade
has been quite successful.

398
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,790
The profits are substantial,

399
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,880
enough to build

400
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,920
the Tower of Immortality,

401
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,270
but something

402
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,480
is missing,

403
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:50,510
a Longevity Lamp to bless me.

404
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:55,960
Since Qingzhou is the land
blessed by Xiyan,

405
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,720
I want

406
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,000
the Sun and Moon Kunluns

407
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,110
to light the lamp

408
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,110
on Qingzhou's Sacred Mountain

409
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,790
for me.

410
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,550
I understand, Father.

411
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,720
Those men were here

412
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,550
to push for the ceremony, right?

413
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,440
If it were just about lighting the lamp,
I wouldn't mind.

414
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,350
We've worked hard
to establish border trade.

415
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,920
Step by step,

416
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,830
we've finally reached prosperity,

417
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,200
and even collected some taxes.

418
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,680
But the money,

419
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,160
instead of benefiting the people,

420
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,510
is being used for the Tower of Immortality.

421
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,720
Is eternal life

422
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,550
really more important than the living?

423
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,640
Prince Heir.

424
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,680
the border trade between nations
is good for Xiyan.

425
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,720
You've done your best.

426
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,480
Trade is booming,

427
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,310
and life in Xiyan

428
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:55,110
will improve too.

429
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,070
Congratulations,
Prince Heir and Princess Heir.

430
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:03,920
Words from Great Yan.

431
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,200
Concubine Yan is one month pregnant.

432
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,200
This is her letter.

433
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,240
Qin.

434
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:20,920
Mei.

435
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,400
I guess you didn't expect it.

436
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,680
I'm going to be a mother!

437
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,440
You must be so happy for me, right?

438
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,750
Are you grinning ear to ear?

439
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,000
Zigu always knows what to say.

440
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,310
But honestly, I'm nervous.

441
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,750
I don't know if I'll be a good mother.

442
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,000
I'm not as calm as my brother,

443
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,680
nor as wise as our mother.

444
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,880
The Emperor tried to comfort me

445
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,920
by praying with me.

446
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:59,680
He said it doesn't matter
if I'm a good mother.

447
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,640
He just wants our child and me

448
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,440
to be safe and content.

449
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,030
I can feel the baby kicking.

450
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,240
What should we name him?

451
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,310
Oh, Mei,

452
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,270
I picked out some wedding gifts for you.

453
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,590
Brother,

454
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,590
do you remember?

455
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,880
After Mother passed,

456
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,270
on my birthday,

457
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,350
Ziyu made me cry all day.

458
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,480
You made a sled for me

459
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,270
to cheer me up.

460
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,200
We played in the mud

461
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,790
and got scolded by Father.

462
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,680
That was the first time

463
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,160
I saw you so happy,

464
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,350
but it was the last time.

465
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:45,830
Brother always taught me
to follow the rules.

466
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,510
But I now think...

467
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,830
those rules are the chains
that bind you.

468
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,640
I just want you

469
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,160
to live as freely

470
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,110
as you did that day.

471
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,680
Zigu's all grown up now.

472
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,160
After Mother died,

473
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,480
palace life became hard.

474
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,920
Traps and murders

475
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,440
were everywhere.

476
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,070
Zigu and I,

477
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,960
had to tread carefully.

478
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,440
People say

479
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,920
being a Hostage Prince in Great Yan
is miserable.

480
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,510
They don't know

481
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,400
those were the happiest days of my life.

482
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,680
Although I was far from home

483
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,070
with all the hardships,

484
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,110
there were still moments of joy.

485
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,720
And the Emperor shared my vision.

486
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,590
The Emperor cares for the people

487
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,720
and their lives.

488
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,790
I hope that one day,

489
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,440
Xiyan can be like Great Yan.

490
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,880
Yue Qin.

491
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,640
You are more than just
the Prince Heir of Xiyan.

492
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,240
You are you.

493
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,920
Sometimes,

494
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,550
you can let go of the rules.

495
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,830
You can be free,

496
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,160
just like Zigu.

497
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,240
When we return to Xiyan,

498
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,590
let's go sledding together.

499
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,180
[Invitation]

500
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,070
The Xiyan court sent an invitation.

501
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:44,030
They heard about
the lamp-lighting ceremony in Qingzhou.

502
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,400
Now that trade is flourishing
between our nations,

503
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,830
a ceremony in Qingzhou

504
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,830
will symbolize lasting peace.

505
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,590
How will

506
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,350
the ceremony be conducted?

507
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,440
By then,

508
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,920
I will represent Xiyan's Sun Kunlun

509
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,000
and ascend the mountain

510
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,160
from the west.

511
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,750
Mei Lin will represent Great Yan's

512
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,880
Moon Kunlun

513
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,790
and ascend from the east.

514
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,070
We must not

515
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,480
touch the ground

516
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,790
during the ascent.

517
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,480
We will be carried

518
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,640
by palanquin bearers to the summit,

519
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,510
where we will offer prayers

520
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,920
and light the Longevity Lamp.

521
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,350
Once the lamp is lit,
the ceremony will end.

522
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,160
Very well.

523
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,880
We will fully cooperate.

524
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,590
Thank you, Your Excellency.

525
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,920
After the ceremony,

526
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,480
we will return to Xiyan.

527
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,480
By then,

528
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,550
the Snow Dragon Whisker should bloom.

529
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,350
Prince Heir,

530
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,960
do you remember our promise?

531
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,510
This trip to Xiyan

532
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,110
is for Mei Lin
to take the Snow Dragon Whisker.

533
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,200
Farewell.

534
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,350
My lord.

535
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,550
The palanquin bearers for Princess Heir

536
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,680
have been arranged.

537
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,640
The night wind is harsh,

538
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,240
drinking will harm your health.

539
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,160
After this parting,

540
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,240
we may never

541
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,480
meet again.

542
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,160
Let's make a bet.

543
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,000
If I grow Red Fruits,

544
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,550
you will marry me.

545
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,110
I won't bet.

546
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:20,880
I won't be married off.

547
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,000
I'll just take a live-in husband.

548
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,160
When we return to Qingzhou,

549
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,310
we will marry.

550
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,920
Qingzhou is so far away,

551
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,160
my father can't interfere.

552
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,240
You need to first grow the Red Fruits.

553
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,880
She's right.

554
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,640
Red Fruit...

555
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,110
Only in Laowozi Village,
they call it Red Fruit.

556
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,240
I didn't believe it then.

557
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,550
I thought I could grow one
with the same taste.

558
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,200
Some things,

559
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,030
if forced, turn bitter.

560
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:27,200
[Yanlai Fragrance Shop]

561
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,400
Even if we're far apart,

562
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,720
we can still write letters.

563
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,310
When you're too busy

564
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,550
running a business with your lover,

565
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,030
you'll forget about us.

566
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,830
Who said it?

567
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,240
I'll write to you all the time.

568
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,880
Don't get annoyed!

569
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,720
