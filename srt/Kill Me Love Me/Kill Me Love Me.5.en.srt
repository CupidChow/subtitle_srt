00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,200
Mother,

372
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,640
you'll open a fruit cake store.

373
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,000
I'm sure the business will be great.

374
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,070
You want me to carry on
with the stonework. What will you do?

375
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,550
- Right.
- I'll protect Mother.

376
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,680
Mother.

377
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,110
What is it?

378
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,510
Girl,

379
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,750
this stone hairpin was made
by your father for your dowry.

380
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,070
Why do you put it in my hair?

381
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,750
I won't get married.

382
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,070
Nonsense.

383
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,680
All girls will get married.

384
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,550
Rest assured. Even if you get married,

385
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,000
your father and I
won't let you get bullied.

386
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,550
With my skills,

387
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,590
I'll be the bully.

388
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,350
It's not easy to find a husband
who can be bullied.

389
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,030
Don't think about it anymore.

390
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:38,920
It's fine you don't get married.

391
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,960
I'll raise you for your entire life.

392
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,590
You must get married.

393
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,440
She won't.

394
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,030
I won't.

395
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,550
You have to.

396
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,110
I won't.

397
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,350
Never.

398
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,270
Never.

399
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,920
Then don't.

400
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,720
I'm homeless now.

401
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,640
I can't go home.

402
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,960
My parents said

403
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,110
where there were spring flowers,
there was home.

404
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,880
If I see spring flowers,

405
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,030
I can find my way home.

406
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:14,880
Little flower,

407
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,590
go home with me.

408
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,400
Won't you go home with me?

409
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,440
Let's go.

410
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,200
Let's go.

411
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:25,920
Go home with me.

412
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:27,960
The flower is here.

413
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,400
Go home with me.

414
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,480
Here is another flower.

415
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,590
Here is another one.

416
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,960
Here are two.

417
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,200
Here are many.

418
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,160
We are home.

419
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,030
My lord,

420
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:46,270
I took the lady's pulse just now.

421
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,400
The Momai poison in her body
hasn't been neutralized.

422
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,750
The effects of Red Coix Seeds have
the signs of her poisoning disappear,

423
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,440
but it only eased
the onset of the poison,

424
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,200
buying her one year.

425
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,200
Red Coix Seed could normally detoxify,

426
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:00,110
but Mei Lin's constitution
is different from most people's.

427
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,640
It seems that during her time wandering,

428
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,160
she ate too much spoiled food
to survive,

429
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,200
which damaged her health.

430
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,110
If she takes more
Red Coix Seeds now to detoxify,

431
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,590
it will cause her immediate death.

432
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,880
Without the antidote,

433
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,000
the hope brought by Red Coix Seeds

434
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,240
will just be meaningless.

435
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,070
Are there any other methods?

436
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,000
I can prepare an antidote for the lady,

437
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,030
but it requires
many rare medicinal materials.

438
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,240
Gathering them all will be no easy task.

439
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,680
Find them as soon as possible.

440
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,240
Tell me if you need anything.

441
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,400
The lady only has one year left.

442
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,920
Even if we manage
to prepare the antidote,

443
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,590
she might not survive until then.

444
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,480
If she can't survive until then,

445
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,030
that's her fate.

446
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,500
[Wan'an Hall]

447
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:02,620
[Scripture]

448
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,320
Mr. Wang,

449
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,110
His Highness is still copying
scriptures in the temple.

450
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,110
No one is allowed to disturb him.

451
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,550
How can you forget the rules?

452
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:17,760
Alright.

453
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:23,460
[Scripture]

454
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,070
Your Highness.

455
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,420
[Wan'an Hall]

456
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,480
Your Highness,

457
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,510
Wenhua Pavilion has been burnt to ashes,

458
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,510
and so has Zhang Yin.

459
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,480
Only this jade ring was left.

460
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,110
He should have died back then.

461
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,000
Your Highness let him live
ten more years.

462
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,550
He should be satisfied.

463
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:00,840
Where is my third brother?

464
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,230
When Prince Jing's men arrived
at Wenhua Pavilion,

465
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,510
it was too late.

466
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,880
Now that Zhang Yin is dead,

467
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,320
the evidence Prince Jing possesses

468
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,070
cannot be substantiated.

469
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,150
What a pity.

470
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,960
[Wan'an Hall]

471
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,400
So many treasures in Wenhua Pavilion

472
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,110
were burnt to ashes.

473
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,510
When it was first built,

474
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,230
my third brother and I went inside
and stole the Zhanyun Sword.

475
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,320
Jinghe,

476
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,840
if possible,

477
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,480
I still want to be your eldest brother.

478
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,400
Your Majesty,

479
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,150
I've lost.

480
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,590
It wasn't easy for you.

481
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,710
Every time you play chess with me,

482
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,400
you have to devote extra effort
to calculating

483
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,030
exactly how many moves
you should let me win by.

484
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,110
Your Majesty is wise and discerning.

485
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,880
Your Majesty plays with great strength

486
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,510
and always sees the big picture
with every move,

487
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,000
whereas I am preoccupied with minor
gains in the corners of the board.

488
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,510
Ultimately, it is due
to my inferior skills

489
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,190
that I always lose to Your Majesty.

490
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,360
You are about to leave the capital.

491
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,480
It's hard for me

492
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,630
to find another chess mate like you.

493
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,550
I've been troubling by something,

494
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,550
and I can't fall asleep.

495
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,510
Only when you return to Xiyan

496
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,510
can you help me solve this problem.

497
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:46,070
I have recently made
some scented powder

498
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,880
that has a calming effect.

499
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,230
I hope it can help relieve

500
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,710
Your Majesty's fatigue
from official duties.

501
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,360
Light it.

502
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,510
It has the fresh scent of plum blossoms.

503
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,800
This incense is called
Spring Message in the Snow,

504
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:19,230
and I made it following the recipe
from the Hermit of Dongli.

505
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,550
It's made of the snow melted
on plum blossoms in the first month

506
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,550
as well as

507
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,230
agarwood,

508
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:24,880
truffles,

509
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,630
linden,
and over a dozen other ingredients.

510
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,440
After being kneaded and pounded

511
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,960
for 49 days, it was made.

512
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,150
You're skilled at playing Guqin,
playing chess, calligraphy, painting,

513
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,150
arranging flowers,
betting on bird fights,

514
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,510
brewing wine, and making incense.

515
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,070
It seems to me there is nothing

516
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,670
you cannot do in this world.

517
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,280
What I know

518
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,920
is merely trivial pastimes
of little use,

519
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,510
and yet I am honored
by Your Majesty's praise.

520
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,590
But when I go back to Xiyan,

521
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,360
what can I do?

522
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,440
It is my lifelong wish

523
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,440
that Great Yan and Xiyan
maintain a lasting friendship.

524
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,880
With my intent to cease hostilities

525
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,590
and Xiyan's desire for peace,

526
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,440
no conflict will arise.

527
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,110
When you go back to Xiyan,

528
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,920
there is a lot you can do.

529
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,360
I pledge to do my utmost
for the peace between our two nations.

530
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,110
Before I leave,

531
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,190
I have one more request

532
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,960
concerning the arrangement
for the peace-making Beauties,

533
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,030
which may help to bridge the gap
between our two nations.

534
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,800
Great Yan is a land
of etiquette and culture,

535
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,150
whereas most of these Beauties

536
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,480
come from places
that are less civilized,

537
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,760
leading to a lack of understanding
of Yan customs and traditions,

538
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,880
which can easily result
in misunderstandings.

539
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,150
I believe

540
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,360
that if the Beauties
in the Court of State Ceremonial

541
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,760
can first learn
the culture and customs

542
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,710
before being allocated,

543
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,480
it can foster mutual understanding

544
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,440
and uphold the original intention
of friendship between our two nations.

545
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,480
That's a great plan.

546
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,070
If Your Majesty trusts me,

547
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,400
I am willing to teach these Beauties

548
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,400
and do my utmost
to promote the culture of Great Yan.

549
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,630
I will go back to Xiyan

550
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,030
after the Beauties
finished their learning.

551
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,710
I know

552
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,840
you are worried about Concubine Yan.

553
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,510
But Concubine Yan is a symbol
of peace between the two nations.

554
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,400
As long as Great Yan and Xiyan
maintain good relations,

555
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,000
Concubine Yan

556
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,280
can live out her days peacefully
in Great Yan.

557
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,280
Considering that it's rare

558
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,920
for you and your sister to reunite,

559
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,510
I allow you

560
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,070
to oversee the teaching arrangements
at the Court of State Ceremonial.

561
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,030
After the marriage alliance is formed,

562
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,710
you can go back to Xiyan.

563
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,840
I will live up
to Your Majesty's expectations of me.

564
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,880
I'll take my leave.

565
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,280
After Mr. Yue Qin goes back to Xiyan,

566
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,030
it'll be hard for Concubine Yan
to see him again.

567
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:56,960
In three days,

568
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,550
school starts
at Court of State Ceremonial.

569
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,800
Let Concubine Yan
go to Court of State Ceremonial.

570
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:03,920
to take a look.

571
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:05,590
Yes.

572
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,710
A dead piece

573
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,440
has somehow made a way out.

574
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:23,630
My lord,

575
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,360
Wenhua Pavilion has been burned
to ruins,

576
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,070
and the bodies are unrecognizable.

577
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,860
[Zhanyue Pavilion]

578
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,400
The poison has really been neutralized.

579
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,920
What did you see in Wenhua Pavilion?

580
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,030
My lord.

581
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,280
I saw the Master of Shadow Works.

582
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,070
The Master of Shadow Works.

583
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:34,840
He said

584
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,550
you had found his involvement
in the Qingzhou massacre.

585
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,670
He asked all Momai Warriors
to stop their actions.

586
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,320
Did you see

587
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,630
a middle-aged man
with a scar on his eyebrow?

588
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,190
Who is he?

589
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,590
The Minister of Defense,

590
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,510
Zhang Yin.

591
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:48,840
Zhang Yin.

592
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,670
He was the true culprit.

593
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,630
He didn't die in Wenhua Pavilion.

594
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,190
He escaped through a secret passage.

595
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,550
All Momai Warriors were wearing
phosphorus-coated garments.

596
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,630
Obviously, they were silenced.

597
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,630
Does the arsonist of Wenhua Pavilion

598
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,320
have something to do
with the Qingzhou massacre?

599
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,190
I'm also investigating it.

600
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,630
Why did Zhang Yin
commit arson in Qingzhou?

601
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,630
After the battle of Qingzhou,

602
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,360
I dismissed him from his position.

603
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,960
He has harbored resentment ever since.

604
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,710
If he wanted to kill you,

605
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,110
he could send many Momai Warriors
like me

606
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,400
to carry out the task.

607
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,190
Why did he have to sacrifice

608
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,550
100,000 innocent Qingzhou people?

609
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,760
I also want to know why.

610
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,280
He can try if he wants to kill me.

611
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,230
Why should the innocent
Weibei Army soldiers be sacrificed?
