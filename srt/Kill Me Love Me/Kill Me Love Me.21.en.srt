00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,550
So you are seeking help from the gods,

188
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,960
not my third brother.

189
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,200
Arrest him.

190
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:56,840
Yes.

191
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,440
What are you doing?

192
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:58,670
Go.

193
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,200
Go.

194
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,030
Your Highness,

195
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,200
I just want to pray for blessings.

196
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,240
I want to pray for blessings
for His Majesty.

197
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,670
Without Eunuch Liu,

198
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,910
Jinghe

199
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,440
will seek Luomei's help.

200
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,550
Keep a close watch,

201
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,240
especially on Mei Lin.

202
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,630
Yes.

203
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,750
[Prince Jing's Mansion]

204
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,150
My Lord,

205
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,840
Eunuch Liu has been captured
by the Crown Prince.

206
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,790
The only person
who can rescue Eunuch Liu

207
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,030
without alerting
the Crown Prince's spies

208
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,270
is General Yin.

209
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,390
However, we received no reply

210
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,440
to our previous messages to her.

211
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,030
The day after tomorrow
will be my final inspection of the camp.

212
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,390
By then,

213
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,870
I will present to the court
a well-disciplined Pingnan Army

214
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,840
with clear defense protocols.

215
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,510
Go to the West Suburban Guard Post.

216
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,750
Today is General Yin's last inspection
of the camp.

217
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,200
There aren't many spies in the army.

218
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,840
This is our last chance.

219
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,510
Greetings, General.

220
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,440
Greetings, General.

221
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,080
Greetings, General.

222
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,120
Greetings, General.

223
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,360
Today is my last inspection of the camp.

224
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,840
From now on,

225
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,750
even though I will no longer
be in the army,

226
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,320
the Pingnan Army must keep their oaths

227
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,120
and protect the people of Great Yan.

228
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,120
I, Yin Luomei,

229
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,000
will always be a comrade
of the Pingnan Army.

230
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,200
Remove the armor.

231
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,670
Take down the flag.

232
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,580
[Yin]

233
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,580
[Yan]

234
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,870
Farewell, General!

235
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,120
Who are you? Come out.

236
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,440
General Yin,

237
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,510
it's me.

238
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,790
I've come to deliver a message
from Prince Jing.

239
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,030
How dare you trespass
into the military camp?

240
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,830
Aren't you afraid I would kill you?

241
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,720
I know you

242
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,830
and General Weibei
are both humane commanders

243
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,920
who would not kill innocents
indiscriminately.

244
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,590
The General's Mansion won't participate
in the struggle for succession.

245
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,480
I can't give Prince Jing what he wants.

246
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,070
[To General Yin]

247
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:26,830
Please read the letter, General.

248
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,270
How dare you

249
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,480
enter the tent
without announcing yourself!

250
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,240
Please pardon me, Your Highness.

251
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,240
The Crown Prince has important matters
to discuss with you.

252
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,830
Please return to the palace
as soon as possible.

253
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,680
You go back first.

254
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,160
After addressing military affairs,

255
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,440
I will return to the palace.

256
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,720
Yes.

257
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,240
Tell Prince Jing

258
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,750
that I am now the Crown Princess.

259
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,680
No matter what happens,

260
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,880
I will stand with the Eastern Palace.

261
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,640
If he tries to sow discord again,

262
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,110
don't blame me for showing no mercy
despite our past.

263
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,790
Jiangtu,

264
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,440
escort her back
to Prince Jing's Mansion.

265
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:17,790
Yes.

266
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,200
Set up a perimeter one li away.

267
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,270
No one is allowed to approach.

268
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,110
Yes.

269
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,000
I didn't expect you still remember how
to beat the Great Yan charge drum.

270
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,270
Only General Weibei

271
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,270
would add an extra beat
to the three rounds.

272
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,400
You went to such great lengths

273
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,270
for the sake of the struggle
for succession?

274
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,960
The struggle for succession

275
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,590
began ten years ago.

276
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,960
The Qingzhou matter
was settled long ago.

277
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,160
Even now,

278
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,000
do you still want to
blame the Crown Prince?

279
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,030
Do you remember

280
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,350
the strategist Li Qing
in the eldest prince's mansion?

281
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,350
I heard he was a spy from Xiyan.

282
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,550
Wasn't he executed?

283
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,160
That was merely
Xuanlie's own explanation.

284
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,790
Li Qing was planted
in the Ministry of Defense.

285
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,030
The Qingzhou massacre

286
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,070
was orchestrated by him and Zhang Yin.

287
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,510
Anticipating that

288
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,680
Xuanlie would eliminate witnesses,

289
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,160
he devised a plan
to hide in the West Mountain Mine.

290
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,640
So during the Lushan Hunt,

291
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,750
you deliberately disappeared
to find him?

292
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,880
That's right.

293
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,550
Now, Li Qing is in my mansion.

294
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,440
This is his confession.

295
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,070
The evidence and witnesses are all here.

296
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,960
If you still have doubts,

297
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,160
you are welcome to verify them.

298
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,030
The Crown Prince feared I would
return and overturn the case,

299
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,310
so he administered
a slow-acting poison to our father.

300
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,720
Eunuch Liu has been imprisoned
by the Crown Prince

301
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,000
for secretly giving our father
an antidote.

302
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,160
Now

303
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,640
the only one who can save Eunuch Liu

304
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,550
is you.

305
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,510
The Yin family has always been loyal.

306
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,680
At this critical moment for Great Yan,

307
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,110
I hope you can

308
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,750
act decisively

309
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,160
and turn the situation around.

310
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,790
I failed

311
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,640
to prevent Prince Jing's people
from acting.

312
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,070
But

313
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,680
the Crown Princess burnt the letter

314
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,880
and said

315
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,110
in any situation,

316
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,000
she would stand by Your Highness.

317
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,310
Got it.

318
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,160
How is the interrogation
of Liu Zhong going?

319
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,750
Don't worry, Your Highness.

320
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,790
An expert executioner

321
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,550
can break even the strongest will
within two days.

322
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,240
Liu Zhong has always favored
Prince Jing.

323
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,510
Planning to assassinate the Crown Prince
while exploiting the Emperor's illness

324
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,830
to secure the throne for Prince Jing.

325
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,510
If he signs this confession,

326
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,680
Prince Jing will surely face death.

327
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,590
Eunuch Liu,

328
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,790
for my third brother,

329
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,550
you are so cruel to yourself.

330
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,510
I would rather die

331
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,640
than let you prevail.

332
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,240
When you will die

333
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,160
is up to me.

334
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,030
General Yin.

335
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,000
Please stop, General Yin.

336
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,160
General Yin,

337
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,750
the Crown Prince committed regicide
and treason by poisoning the Emperor.

338
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,680
He killed 100,000 Qingzhou...

339
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,750
General Yin, you've misjudged him.

340
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,960
Kill me

341
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,960
and save His Majesty.

342
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,350
Scoundrel,

343
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,070
how dare you slander me!

344
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,240
Kill me and save His Majesty.

345
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,110
When Luomei dons her armor,

346
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,110
she leads the Pingnan Army
of 30,000 as a general.

347
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,830
When she removes her armor,

348
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,550
she leads me alone
as the Crown Princess.

349
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,830
Your Highness,
as the heir apparent of Great Yan,

350
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,680
you are known
for your benevolence and kindness,

351
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,920
loving your people
as a father loves his children.

352
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,350
No matter what happens,

353
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,440
I will stand by you.

354
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,000
Didn't you promise to stand with me

355
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,680
in defending Great Yan?

356
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,790
The Yin family has always been loyal.

357
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,070
At this critical moment for Great Yan,

358
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,480
I hope you can

359
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,000
act decisively

360
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,440
and turn the situation around.

361
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,550
Luomei.

362
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,720
Luomei.

363
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,480
You schemed against my aunt

364
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,030
and the entire Yin family.

365
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,200
As a daughter of the Yin family,

366
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,400
do I have a choice?

367
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,640
Yes.

368
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,680
It was me.

369
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,790
I schemed against Jinghe,

370
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,440
and I schemed for the throne.

371
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,680
I plotted against everything
within my sight.

372
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,830
But I never schemed against you.

373
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,030
So what they said is all true.

374
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,510
Why?

375
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,680
Because in your eyes,

376
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,720
there is forever only Murong Jinghe.

377
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,510
If it weren't for my decisive actions
in Qingzhou

378
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,550
that caused Jinghe to lose
the people's support,

379
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,310
how could my father make me
the Crown Prince?

380
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,830
And how could I stand

381
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,640
before you like this,

382
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,440
so that you could see me?

Luomei,

384
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,070
you have promised me a lifetime.

385
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,830
I won't allow you to take it back.

386
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,440

388
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,110
but he refuses to let it go,

389
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,640
insisting on overturning the verdict,

390
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,000
disrupting you and me,

391
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,000
and ruining everything.

392
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,200
As long as he is around,

393
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,550
I will always be the loser.

394
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,440
Slap me again.

395
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,070
Even to this day,

396
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,350
you show no remorse whatsoever.

397
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:37,400
Slap me

398

This slap

400
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,030
is for all the wronged souls
in Qingzhou.

401

This slap

402
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,550
is for His Majesty who placed
high hopes in you.

403
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,070
This slap

404
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,440
is for myself.

I falsely claim to be loyal
to the Emperor and the country.

406
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,640
I actually fell in love with you.

407

Just pretend that nothing happened.

408
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,750
It was me who plotted treason.

409
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,160
Everything is unrelated to you.

410
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,030

412
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,750
I will fulfill

413

418

How could it be so hot?

420
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,880
I just caught a cold.

It's nothing.

But if you want to persist on,

424
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,480
it will harm your health.

I can endure it.

The medicine is ready.

427
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:20,200
My lord, after taking the medicine,
you will feel better.

He...

432
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,030
You may leave now.

00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,720
I'll take my leave.

There is Xuanhu in it.

439
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,790
It's for killing pain.

440

Are you wounded?

This is an old ailment from Qingzhou.

Damp weather

After taking the medicine,

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,790
I will recover very soon.

452
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,160
you have to promise me.

and betrayed the Shadow Works.

into the Fanghua Palace

It was me who caused her
to be poisoned with Momai.

559
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,070
No matter how painful,

560
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,190
I should endure it.

561
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,590
When the Emperor wakes,
we can bring down the Crown Prince.

562
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,360
Then we can get the Snow Dragon Whisker.

563
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,320
Why must you put yourself in danger?

564
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,150
I dare not bet on the only choice.

565
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,840
One more method of detoxification,

566
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:27,960
for her,

567
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,000
is one more chance to survive.

568
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,880
You must first ingest the poison.

569
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,360
Then I can use your body

570
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,710
to test the leech detoxification method.

571
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,710
You will have to endure the pain
of the leeches' bites.

572
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,670
If you can't hold on,

573
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,710
you must take the antidote promptly,

574
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,880
or it will

575
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,480
endanger your own life.

576
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,440
But Prince Jing has taken the antidote.

577
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,440
He should wake up very soon.

578
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:03,880
Your Highness.

579
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:04,960
Your Highness.

580
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,710
Your Highness,

581
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,670
how is His Majesty?

582
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,030
Concubine Yan,

583
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,030
you don't understand
the rules of attending to the sick.

584
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,710
I will oversee things here
at the Yanming Palace.

585
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:15,880
You may go back.

586
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,510
Your Highness,

587
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,710
His Majesty can't wake up, can he?

588
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:21,800
Don't talk nonsense.

589
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,590
But everyone in the palace said so.

590
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,510
I beg you, Your Highness.

591
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,110
Please let me in to see His Majesty.

592
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,590
I know I'm useless.

593
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,880
I can't cure His Majesty,
but I just want to stay with him.

594
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,510
Let me go in. I beg you.

595
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:36,880
Your Highness.

596
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:37,960
Your Highness.

597
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,710
I beg you, Your Highness.

598
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,110
Please let me in to see His Majesty.

599
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,630
Your Highness.

600
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,840
I beg you, Your Highness.

601
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:45,960
Your Highness,

602
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,280
His Majesty treated me so well.

603
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,190
I just want to stay with him.

604
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,670
Let me go in, okay?

605
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,110
I beg you, Your Highness.

606
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,710
I beg you, Your Highness.

607
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,230
Get up.

608
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,360
You agreed, right?

609
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,230
Your Highness, you...

610
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,710
Anyone wishing to enter
must be searched first.

611
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,030
Yanming Palace is heavily guarded.

612
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,150
Only by becoming the antidote myself

613
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,550
can I avoid detection during a search.

614
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,440
Go in now.

615
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,400
Thank you, Your Highness.

616
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:41,840
Catch her.

617
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:42,480
Yes.

618
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,150
Follow me.
