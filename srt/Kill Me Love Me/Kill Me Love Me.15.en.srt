00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,270
Zhu Li.

391
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,480
The King has abandoned state affairs
for years,

392
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,830
focusing on longevity

393
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,960
and consulting numerous priests.

394
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,510
Yet

395
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,000
he trusts only one

396
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,920
in the end.

397
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,270
Zhu Li?

398
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,070
Who?

399
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,920
Greetings, Your Highness.

400
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,830
I'm Zhu Li.

401
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,920
I'm Prince Pingyang's daughter.

402
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,880
What were you doing just now?

403
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,240
My father says the Longevity Lamp,
transformed from a celestial deity,

404
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,400
will never be extinguished.

405
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,830
But I wonder

406
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,160
if it truly never goes out.

407
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,350
Aren't you afraid of divine punishment?

408
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,480
I don't believe in gods.

409
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,640
Today,

410
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,720
my mother punished me
because I don't believe in gods.

411
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,960
I'd like to see

412
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,160
what happens when

413
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,310
the lamp's blown out.

414
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,920
It seems the gods are not as terrible
as my mother.

415
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,640
Madam.

416
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,960
Why do you come to the altar?

417
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,720
The people of Xiyan suffer

418
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,000
while the royal court

419
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,550
spends tens of thousands

420
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,590
on mermaid oil

421
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,750
to keep the lamps lit.

422
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,110
This is

423
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,750
far too extravagant of you.

424
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,550
Please be cautious with your words.

425
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,070
The Longevity Lamp

426
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,510
is transformed from a celestial deity.

427
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,480
Only by keeping it burning

428
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,240
can the King's reign

429
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,880
endure forever.

430
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,640
But you are not

431
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,640
a guardian chosen by the deities.

432
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,000
How dare you!

433
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:38,960
Twenty years ago,

434
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,750
Prince Pingyang's twin daughters
were born.

435
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,200
The elder sister's Zhu Li.

436
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,880
Her birth chart

437
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,400
aligned with Father's heavenly mandate,

438
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,750
a blessing of fortune and prosperity
bestowed by the heavens.

439
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,000
And you,

440
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,270
the younger daughter Zhu Shun,

441
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,550
hating the injustice of heaven

442
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,160
and jealous of your sister,

443
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,960
killed her with your own hands

444
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,590
and took her place.

445
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,790
Nonsense!

446
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,270
I'm Zhu Li.

447
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,720
How can you

448
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,880
slander me without proof?

449
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,350
It concerns my Father's longevity.

450
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,240
Whether you're Zhu Li or Zhu Shun,

451
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,880
he'll find out.

452
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,480
Don't worry.

453
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,680
I will

454
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,920
keep your secret for you.

455
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,720
I've heard my second brother, Yue Chu,

456
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,720
has been trying
to win you over in secret.

457
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,440
I hope you can

458
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,640
assess the situation carefully

459
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,920
and make decisive moves.

460
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,680
I only follow the King's orders.

461
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,350
Since you have discerned heaven,

462
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,240
earth,

463
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,030
deities,

464
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:42,750
and humans,

465
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,160
you should know

466
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,110
immortality is a delusion.

467
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,680
If one persists in delusions,

468
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,350
the nation will be harmed.

469
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,720
How can the priests find peace

470
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,030
with Xiyan's stability at risk?

471
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,310
If I become Xiyan's young ruler,

472
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,030
ensuring its long-term stability,

473
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,720
the position of the priests can endure.

474
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,000
You're back.

475
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,400
You're back.

476
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,070
Off to work?

477
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,400
Come on, take this.

478
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,200
I want one, too.

479
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,920
Careful. Don't fall.

480
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,590
Let Sister play.

481
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,270
Busy working?

482
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,640
Where's everybody?

483
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,590
The Crown Prince reported your death
using a fake corpse.

484
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,680
His Majesty believed

485
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,350
and withdrew the Imperial Guards,

486
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,440
leaving only

487
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,510
the Crown Prince's men
watching your mansion.

488
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,310
I feared causing you trouble...

489
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,440
I acted in secret.

490
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,920
Spreading the news about my death

491
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,400
before killing me.

492
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:44,790
Where's this?

493
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,400
This is Laowozi Village
deep in Zhongshan.

494
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,000
Villagers are refugees
from the previous dynasty.

495
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,110
This village is hidden,
even from the government.

496
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,440
Rest assured, my Lord.

497
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,510
I accidentally found this place.

498
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,960
I wiped away our traces of coming here.

499
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,750
The villagers think we are refugees
fleeing from war.

500
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,550
They kindly offered us a shelter
to recover.

501
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,720
How is Li Qing?

502
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,240
He went mad.

503
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,030
The physician said he'll recover.

504
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,510
But it takes time.

505
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:13,550
My Lord,

506
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,830
I'll gather secret guards,

507
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,240
risking our lives to escort you.

508
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,750
There's no need for sacrifices.

509
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,310
Use their plan.

510
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,920
I'll hide in Laowozi Village

511
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,790
and let the Crown Prince search

512
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,830
until Li Qing recovers.

513
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,310
Once Li Qing's awake,

514
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,030
I'll return to see His Majesty.

515
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,000
A few secret guards will protect you.

516
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,000
No need.

517
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,400
Mei Lin is enough.

518
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,750
You return immediately.

519
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,960
Arrange my funeral.

520
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:34,790
For my safety,

521
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:35,960
make it convincing.

522
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:37,720
Okay.

523
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:38,830
Well,

524
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,440
I'll leave once Mei Lin wakes.

525
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,680
I've something to tell her.

526
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:43,720
About what?

527
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,680
To look after you.

528
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,270
Although your external injuries
are fine,

529
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:47,960
your lack

530
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,640
of food and water has weakened

531
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,510
your spleen and stomach.

532
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,960
Avoid raw and cold foods.

533
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,680
Fine.

534
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,160
I can look after myself.

535
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,200
Hurry back.

536
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:56,880
My Lord,

537
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,920
I've left the usual medicines

538
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,110
for you in the room,
along with the sleeping powder.

539
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,310
The physician warned

540
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,750
that you must not exceed

541
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,830
one spoonful of the sleeping powder
per day,

542
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,550
or you

543
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,680
might depend on them forever.

544
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,310
Haven't you finished?

545
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,480
Your stay risks my safety.

546
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,640
Hurry back.

547
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:11,960
Yes.

548
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,240
I'm leaving.

549
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,640
Hasn't your wife woken up yet?

550
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,830
Thank you for these days.

551
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,440
It's strange.

552
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,750
She can sleep for so long.

553
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,790
She can eat and drink but won't wake up.

554
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:32,680
Oh, right.

555
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,480
The porridge is on the stove.

556
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,000
Okay.

557
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:35,880
Thanks, Madam.

558
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,960
I'll get busy.

559
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,150
You're dreaming again.

560
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,150
How much longer will you sleep?

561
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,800
Are you deliberately tormenting me?

562
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:50,710
Father,

563
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,190
Mother,

564
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,920
sugar figure.

565
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,110
No wonder...

566
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,840
I want more.

567
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,030
Not too much.

568
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,510
You'll get tooth decay.

569
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,550
Father,

570
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,590
sing a song.

571
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,190
Sing a song.

581
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,360
Yes.

582
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,880

Apricot flowers.

587

What apricot flowers?

588
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,440
Peach blossoms are red.

589
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,670
Apricot flowers are white.

590
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,440
You sang pear flowers are white.

591
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,150
You're wrong.

592
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,840
I wasn't wrong.

593
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,110
You were dreaming again.

594
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,360
A dream?

595
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,710
But I clearly heard your voice just now.

596
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,320
The young lady is awake.

597
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,070
Madam.

598
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,960
Your husband was so worried about you.

599
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,510
When you were sleeping,

600
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,510
you said

601
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,480
you wanted sugar figures.

602
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,960
There are no such things in our place.

603
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,840
Your husband got wild honey

604
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,280
to coax you to sleep.

605
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:33,840
Here.

606
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,110
I've added some in this.

607
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,150
It's really sweet.

608
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:36,630
Let me.

609
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,550
What happened to your hand?

610
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,230
Were you stung by a bee?

611
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,190
It doesn't matter.

612
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,230
Here.

613
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,190
Drink it.

614
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,550
Just feed her.

615
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,510
Feed your wife.

616
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,110
Madam,

617
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,800
actually, we are not...

618
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,000
We...

619
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,880
We're siblings who survived a calamity.

620
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,320
We're grateful for your help.

621
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,150
We'll repay you

622
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,000
in the future.

623
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,710
So you are siblings?

624
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,880
Aren't you a couple?

625
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,400
Our parents

626
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,710
died of illnesses long ago.

627
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,360
As her brother,

628
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,440
I have to

629
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,550
take care of her.

630
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,760
You have also had a tough life.

631
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,400
But you are fortunate

632
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,550
to have found our place.

633
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,760
You can live here as long as you want.

634
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:31,920
Madam,

635
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,840
since my sister is awake,

636
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,400
we need to get the physician.

637
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,320
Right.

638
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,320
She needs the physician.

639
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,510
I'll go.

640
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,280
Madam,

641
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,630
no need.

642
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,110
We'll go see him later.

643
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,230
Right.

644
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,030
Your brother's hand needs to be treated.

645
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,230
I'm leaving.

646
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,070
Go on eating.

647
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,590
Okay.

648
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,230
- They don't seem local.
- Never seem them.

649
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,360
Are they from around here?

650
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,960
Was it a bee sting?

651
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,070
The groundweed root
should reduce swelling.

652
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,110
The physician will have it.

653
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,190
Fine.

654
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,190
There's honey in the porridge.

655
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:36,960
It's sweet.

656
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:39,920
Thanks to you,

657
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,440
I have survived.

658
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,150
I should satisfy your cravings

659
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,030
for good food.

660
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:47,760
Once

661
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,840
we return,

662
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,360
I'll grant you

663
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,550
whatever you wish.

664
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,030
We are allies.

665
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,030
Helping you was to help myself.

666
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,480
So

667
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,440
you'll continue with me,

668
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:06,400
right?

669
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,670
We have the same goal.

670
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,480
Even if we get lost,

671
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,480
we must move forward together.

672
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,800
The Crown Prince faked my death.

673
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,800
Now Murong Jinghe

674
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,320
is a dead man.

675
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,230
Once Li Qing is cured,

676
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,630
we can return to Zhaojing

677
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,230
to settle scores with him.

678
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,480
Concubine Yan will surely search for me

679
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,550
now that I'm missing.

680
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,280
Will the Crown Prince trouble her?

681
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,360
At the Lushan Hunting Ground,

682
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,400
more than one person

683
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,320
saw us together.

684
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:46,800
They'll guess

685
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:47,960
I was with you

686
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,190
when the accident happened.

687
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,550
You might be

688
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,110
the only one with the truth.

689
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,590
Even if Concubine Yan's silent,

690
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,400
Father will send searchers for you.

691
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,440
With my Father's people around,

692
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:01,320
the Crown Prince will think twice
before doing anything.

693
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,800
It's a good thing for us.

694
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,280
In all,

695
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,070
before Li Qing is cured,

696
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,190
we just need to hide in the village

697
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,670
as a pair of common

698
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:12,800
refugee siblings.

699
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,400
My Lord.

700
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,510
Call me Jinghe.

701
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,070
Jinghe.

702
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,920
Is this place safe?

703
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,000
