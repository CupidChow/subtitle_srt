of State Ceremonial say

168

Prince Jing is deeply in love with her.

169

Good thing I caught myself,

172
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,200
so it doesn't count
as defying your will.

173
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,630
Are you worried that Jinghe
will take revenge on her privately?

174

Do not worry.

175

When she marries,
she can leave from there,

180
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,150

181

189
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,320
isn't this too risky?

190
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,000
This is the only way

191
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,360
to win.

192
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,720
If we rescue the hostage, Li Qing,

193
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,270
we can bring down the Crown Prince
in one move.

Your Highness,

197
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,270
Mr. Yue Qin has come

198
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,550
to bid farewell.

199
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,720
What are you doing...?

200
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,550
In the three years in Yan,

201
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,480
I received much care from you.

202
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,390
As I am about to depart,

203
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,200
I bring a small gift

204
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,030
to express my thanks.

205
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,630
You are my father's friend.

206
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,910
It's not even considered offering care.

207
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,390
I'm ashamed

208
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,630
to accept the gift.

209
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,510
Please,

210
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,910
Your Highness.

211
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,510
don't be too hasty to refuse.

216
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,240
His Majesty often reads them

this

His Majesty has been using this

to ease his burden of state affairs.

230
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,480
So that's the incense Father uses.

231
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,440
No wonder
you're such close friends with him.

232
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,870
Well then,

233
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:45,870
thank you.

00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,440
Such a precious gift,

Mr. Yue Qin,

236
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,000
you should send one
to Prince Jing as well.

237
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,720

238
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,960

and goodwill for the future.

the future of Great Yan rests with you,
Your Highness.

242
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,440
So this gift

00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,200
is only for you.

244
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,390
Very well.

00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,360
But,

246
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,030
Mr. Yue Qin,

247
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,480
there's something else
I'd like to ask of you.

248
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,670
Please speak.

249
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,120
It's about the ten beauties
who are to return with you to Xiyan.

250
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,720
I've been thinking

251
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,360
about their suspicious origins.

252
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,510
Father doesn't want to delve deeper

253
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,360
because of the political implications,

254
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,720
but to avoid trouble in the future,

255
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
they cannot live.

256
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,550
If you

257
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,440
are willing to ease my burden,

258
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,080
why not come over

259
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,840
and have a cup of tea with me?

260
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,550
May I have the honor

261
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,960

00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,320
Certainly.

00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,320
Certainly.

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,720
you were a gentleman

275
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,960

Just past the Chen hour.

and personally fetch her
when the time comes.

295
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,240
Yes, my lord.

296
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,240

that when you marry the one
you truly love,

298

Visiting Great Yan

303
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,960
has certainly been an eye-opener.

just come back to Great Yan
and bring Mei Lin away.

Go to the Emperor for help.

Do not worry.

329
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,310

- The imperial decree has arrived.

for your virtuous character

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,880
and exceptional talent,

362
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,550
you are chosen to serve

00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,200
in the Fanghua Palace

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,400
under the care of Concubine Yan.

365
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,750
The proclamation is now complete.

366
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,070
Mei Lin,

367
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,160
aren't you happy?

368
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,030
I wasn't allowed to tell you before

369
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,550
because His Majesty

370
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,680
didn't want Prince Jing
to know and interfere.

371
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,270
So...

372
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:38,830
Your Highness,

373
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,920
I understand your concerns.

374
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,000
But I forgot to give something
to Mr. Yue Qin.

375
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,350
I need to hurry and deliver it.

376
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,400
Then go.

377
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,790
You look better
with a simple appearance.

378
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,960
Actually, your festive look is nice too.

379
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,270
My lord.

380
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,440
- Has she...
- My lord.

381
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,750
Miss Mei Lin has been assigned
to Fanghua Palace.

382
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,680
My lord.

383
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,070
Concubine Yan asked me to inform you

384
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,680
that Miss Mei Lin,

385
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,480
unwilling to part from Mr. Yue Qin,

386
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,350
has gone to see him off.

387
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,400
There's no need for you
to make the trip.

388
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:32,790
Qingyan,

389
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,350
follow the Xiyan delegation.

390
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:34,750
Yes, my lord.

391
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,750
Mei Lin?

392
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,030
It's my failure.

393
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I couldn't protect them.

394
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,640
Jia.

395
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,680
Jia, wake up.

396
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,480
Wake up.

397
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,030
Jia.

398
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:44,680
Yi.

399
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,070
Don't sleep.

400
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:47,830
Get up.

401
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:49,830
Wake up.

402
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:51,960
Get up.

403
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,270
Mei Lin,

404
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,750
I'll take them back.

405
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,510
I'll bring them home.

406
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,310
Stay calm.

407
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,920
They shouldn't have gone home like this.

408
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,000
They were innocent,

409
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,550
caught in a deadly power struggle
in Great Yan.

410
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,640
And I'm no more than a pawn.

411
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,030
Even with the will,
I lack the power to save them.

412
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,920
When you left,

413
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,550
I saw it.

414
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,880
I saw an Eastern Palace secret guard
following you.

415
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,240
Was this the Crown Prince's doing?

416
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,440
Mei Lin, don't be rash.

417
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,200
You now belong to Fanghua Palace.

418
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,070
Our fates are intertwined.

419
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,110
Believe me,

420
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,440
no one will dare harm you.

421
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,880
Live and wait for me to return.

422
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,110
If you really want to know the truth,

423
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,510
ask Prince Jing.

424
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,350
The girls,

425
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,160
I'll take them home.

426
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,550
Mr. Yue Qin,

427
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,070
I leave them in your care.

428
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,480
You mustn't be seen,

429
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,680
or the Crown Prince's hands

430
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,240
will never be clean.

431
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,750
I can't bear to see another Dai

432
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,920
die in front of me.

433
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,240
The Crown Prince couldn't deal with you,

434
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,160
so he mimicked your burn mark

435
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,720
to frame me,

436
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,790
claiming I'm using the Xiyan beauties
to bribe court officials

437
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,480
and threaten
the Crown Prince's position.

438
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,110
What have you done?

439
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,750
Bandits killed my Xiyan people

440
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,160
for profit.

441
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,790
They have been dealt with.

442
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,200
Now,

443
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,960
both Great Yan and Xiyan

444
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,270
have their answers.

445
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,680
Mr. Yue Qin,

446
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,200
you are so thorough.

447
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,030
Let me beg the Crown Prince

448
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,200
for mercy

449
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,440
so I can bring their bodies

450
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,000
back to Xiyan for burial.

451
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,480
Mr. Yue Qin.

452
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,880
You're also so compassionate.

453
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,920
It's done.

454
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,640
I must return to the Eastern Palace
to report.

455
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:07,680
Farewell,

456
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,350
Mr. Yue Qin.

457
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,270
Farewell.

458
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:18,780
[Guests Like Clouds]

459
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,160
My lord,

460
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,310
time is running out.

461
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,000
We must go.

462
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,160
The matter of the beauties is settled.

463
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,400
His Majesty won't see you.

464
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,200
My lord,

465
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,480
please return.

466
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,030
I'll find another way.

467
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,240
No matter what,

468
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,110
I won't let you...

469
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,270
What did you do to those ten beauties?

470
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,880
The burn marks on their wrists,

471
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,750
did you do that?

472
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,310
Yes.

473
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,830
I asked you before,

474
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:17,920
and you lied to me.

475
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,590
Why?

476
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,510
You burned yourself too,
but you didn't tell me.

477
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,310
Like you,

478
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,030
I was buying time.

479
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,550
But you knew

480
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,880
Dai died because of that.

481
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,070
I had no intention of killing anyone.

482
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,920
But when you burned them,
you were killing them.

483
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,880
Those ten beauties didn't know anything.

484
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,550
They became pawns

485
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,750
because you chose them.

486
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,400
And now look at them.

487
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,030
I'm your pawn too.

488
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,200
And I thought
we were partners in vengeance.

489
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,720
Isn't it funny?

490
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,270
A player

491
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,200
and a pawn

492
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,310
work together to win,

493
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,110
not to flip the board.

494
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,070
A pawn

495
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,510
can never be a winner.

496
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,750
All I wanted

497
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,200
was justice for the innocent.

498
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,480
Do you think
I wanted anything different?

499
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:13,880
Everything I did

500
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,110
was to make sure the ones responsible
for the fire were punished.

501
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,270
That the Weibei Army was vindicated.

502
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,200
That the 100,000 innocent souls
in Qingzhou

503
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
could rest in peace.

504
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,400
But the way you seek justice

505
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,830
for the innocent,

506
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,790
doesn't it sound absurd even to you?

507
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,070
Fighting the man
who slaughtered 100,000 people,

508
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,200
does it matter
if the methods are absurd?

509
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,550
This is what sounds absurd to me.

510
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,440
Do you know who we're up against?

511
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,960
Our enemy is the Crown Prince.

512
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,550
Court politics are no less brutal
than the battlefield.

513
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,350
On the battlefield,

514
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,070
the only thing that matters is victory.

515
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,750
I won't work with you

516
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,070
from this moment on.

517
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,510
My lord,

518
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,790
the ten beauties have been silenced
by the Crown Prince.

519
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,440
What?

520
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,270
When I reached the delegation,

521
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,350
Miss Mei Lin already knew

522
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,480
about the deaths.

523
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,510
Yue Qin has likely formed an alliance
with the Crown Prince.

524
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,030
There's no way the silencing

525
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,200
could've gone so smoothly without help.

526
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,720
Tell me everything you know.

527
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,540
[Guests Like Clouds]

528
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,110
Sir,

529
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,750
after they loaded the bodies, they left.

530
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,400
I didn't see anything else.

531
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,510
I'll take my leave now.

532
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,790
It's Xiyan's closed-breath pill.

533
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:51,790
My lord,

534
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,550
the manager of the way station said

535
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,920
Wang Quan
from the Eastern Palace was here.

536
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,400
You were right.

537
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,000
Yue Qin and the Crown Prince

538
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,590
have formed an alliance.

539
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,350
Qingyan,

540
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,110
we underestimated him.

541
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:11,830
Mr. Yue Qin,

542
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,790
don't worry.

543
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,830
Thanks to the closed-breath pills,

544
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,030
we've deceived the Crown Prince.

545
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,160
It is late.

546
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,400
Let's rest briefly,

547
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,640
and then continue on our journey.

548
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,920
Mr. Yue Qin,
you have truly done a good job,

549
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,070
killing two birds with one stone.

550
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,350
My Xiyan people shouldn't die in vain.

551
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,510
And Mei Lin
shouldn't be deceived by you either.

552
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,640
My lord.

553
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,680
All of you,

554
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,110
write a letter to Mei Lin,
telling her you're safe.

555
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,960
She's already burdened
by the 100,000 souls of Qingzhou.

556
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,070
Don't add ten more lives to that burden.

557
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,030
No need for them to write.

558
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,350
This letter

559
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,400

upon our return to Xiyan.

560

750
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,400
you'll never see the person

751
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,550
who troubles you again.

752
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,800
Forget-Sorrow Flower.

753
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,480
It works.

754
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,510
When Ziyu bullied me,

755
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,440
I prayed with the Forget-Sorrow Flower,

756
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,590
and the next day,
I was in the peace-making marriage.

757
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,590
Whether

758
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:13,630
he loves me or not,

759
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,800
we've already become strangers.

760
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,590
It doesn't matter anymore.

761
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,070
Let's go, Your Highness.

762
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,320
Wait!

763
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:26,190
It's about to sink!

764
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:27,320
Just wait a little longer.

765
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,360
The paper flower is already wet.

766
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,550
It'll sink sooner or later.

767
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,230
Let's go.
