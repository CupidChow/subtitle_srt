371
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,550
Murong Jinghe,

372
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:54,830
do you admit to your crimes?

373
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,270
I do.

374
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,750
Considering you're of royal blood

375
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,110
and blessed by Heaven,

376
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,230
confess your crimes

377
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,550
before your ancestors.

378
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,230
With Heaven above,

379
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,480
and Earth below,

380
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,150
the Murong clan,

381
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,800
ordained by Heaven's decree,

382
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,320
governs the people.

383
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,760
With ancestors honored,
the nation has prospered.

384
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,880
But now, an unfilial descendant
of Murong,

385
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,400
driven by selfish ambition,

386
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,840
has cast aside the ancestors' teachings

387
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,190
and committed three unforgivable crimes.

388
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,320
First,

389
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,190
he failed the Emperor, his father,

390
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,670
by plotting treason
against his own family.

391
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,670
This makes him unfilial.

392
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,880
Second, as a prince,

393
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,440
he disregarded the people's welfare

394
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,360
and caused the deaths
of hundreds of thousands in Qingzhou.

395
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,070
This makes him unjust.

396
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:54,760
Third, he betrayed the bond of kinship

397
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,920
by bringing harm to his own brother.

398
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,550
This makes him disloyal.

399
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,760
Such unfiliality, injustice,
and disloyalty

400
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,400
make him unworthy to face
his ancestors or serve the nation.

401
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,440
Jinghe,

402
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,510
take your own life

403
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,230
to repay the world.

404
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,960
I attempted
to assassinate the Crown Prince

405
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,920
not out of greed for the throne,

406
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,960
but to rid the nation of evil.

407
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,110
The one guilty of being unfilial,

408
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,320
unjust,

409
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,880
and disloyal

410
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,110
is none other than the Crown Prince,

411
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,030
Murong Xuanlie.

412
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,960
Do you admit to your crimes?

413
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,030
Protect the Crown Prince!

414
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,590
My lord.

415
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,590
Go to Yanming Palace.

416
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,760
Murong Jinghe has rebelled.

417
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,670
Execute him on the spot!

418
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,440
Wang Quan,

419
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,000
take your men to guard Yanming Palace.

420
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:21,670
Yes.

421
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,800
The Imperial Guards
outnumber us several times.

422
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,190
Avoid direct confrontation

423
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,800
before we reach Yanming Palace.

424
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,360
When the battle drums sound,

425
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,670
a soldier must fight and never retreat

426
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:47,960
until the drums fall silent.

427
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,360
As long as she still remembers
the sound of the battle drums,

428
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,190
she will remember the duty of a general.

429
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,710
If we can win General Yin's support,

430
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,590
we will have
a better chance of survival.

431
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,440
When the battle drums sound,

432
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,360
a soldier must fight and never retreat
until the drums fall silent.

433
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,150
The Yin family has always
been loyal and brave.

434
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,440
At this critical moment for Great Yan,

435
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,440
I hope you can act decisively

436
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,840
and turn the situation around.

[of the Zheng Kingdom]

438

[Memorial Tablet of Marquis of Wuyang,]
[General Yin Sheng of Great Yan]

439
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,880
Will the legacy of the Yin family

440
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:43,000
really end in my hands?

441
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,230
You're so clever, honey.

442
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,360
Father, your hands are so rough.

443
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,000
I forgot.

444
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,110
Mother said you held Great Yan
in the palm of your hands,

445
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,280
and that's why they grew calluses.

446
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,920
Great Yan is so vast.

447
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,630
You can leave
some of it in my hands, Father.

448
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,070
Very well.

449
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,880
Very well.

450
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,800
When you grow up and become a general,

451
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,760
I'll entrust some of it to you.

452
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,070
What a good child.

453
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,030
Peeking at the military drill?

454
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,360
Using the targets without permission?

455
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,840
Do you still not see your mistakes?

456
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,320
Father, do you also despise me
for being a girl?

457
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,190
Have you forgotten the promise
you made to me when I was a child?

458
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,670
I thought it was just idle talk.

459
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,230
Luomei,

460
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,840
I gave my life to the battlefield

461
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,960
and wronged both you and your mother.

462
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,840
I don't want you to follow my path.

463
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,630
I never felt wronged as a child

464
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,550
because I knew

465
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,710
you held the safety of Great Yan

466
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,590
in your hands

467
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,000
and were the backbone of the nation.

468
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,440
But now, kneeling before you,

469
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,550
I feel wronged.

470
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,670
I never wanted to walk your path.

471
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:19,550
I only want to walk the one I chose!

472
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,920
Does it hurt?

473
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,590
I lanced it

474
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,110
so it can heal faster.

475
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,440
At the Mao hour, the drill begins.

476
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,190
Anyone late will receive five strikes.

Have you agreed to let me
become a general?

478
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,230
My daughter,

479
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,440
when the calluses on your hands

480
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,760
are as thick as mine,

481
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,440
you will be qualified

482
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,480
to become a general
to protect the nation.

483
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,400
Since you've chosen this path,

484
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,070
do not betray

485
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,320

00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,000
I understand, Father.

489
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:35,670
Father,

490
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,280
now the calluses on my hands

491
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,000
are already thicker than yours.
