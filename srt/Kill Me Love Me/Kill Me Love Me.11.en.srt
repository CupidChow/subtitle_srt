besides their fake identities,

they all have identical burns
on their wrists.

30
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,870
General Yin,

31
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,150
why don't we just arrest them all
and interrogate them together?

Clearly, that was no accident.

General Yin,

41
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,150
I suspect all of this

42
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,430
may be related to Prince Jing.

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,310
I've checked.

44
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,030
When the ten Beauties were burned,

45
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,590
Attendant Liu was present.
She used to work at Rong'an Palace.

46
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,870
She's certainly following orders
from Prince Jing.

47
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,960
These Beauties are about to be ennobled

48

Do not jump to conclusions.

51
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,400
Forgive me, General Yin,
but I'm not making baseless claims.

52
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,800
Ever since Mei Lin entered
the Court of State Ceremonial,

53
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,680
Prince Jing has been
a frequent visitor there.

54

He's even done a lot
of absurd things for her.

55
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,520
In my view,

56
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,120
Prince Jing is using his affection
for Mei Lin as an excuse

57
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,630
to contact spies.

for interrogation,

59
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,400

been hidden in the West Mountain Mine.

by the miners.

Li Qing is imprisoned
in the dungeon beneath the mine.

at the mine, Yang Zhen,

65
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,360
has secretly pledged loyalty
to the Crown Prince.

66
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,960
Zhang Yin simply hid Li Qing
right under our noses.

right under the Crown Prince's nose?

If I disguise myself as a guard,

it would surely
attract the Crown Prince's attention.

will require a longer plan.

I couldn't tolerate that,

137
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,920
so I retaliated in kind.

138

so he mimicked your burn mark

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,080

to bribe court officials

no matter what happens,

164
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,630
the most important thing
is to keep Mei Lin safe.

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,550
Rest assured, my lord.

166
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,030
Mei Lin is skilled in martial arts.

167
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,440
This will be a simple task for her.

you planted it yourself.

179
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,720
It was you who forced me to plant it.

180
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,670
I lost to you
in an archery contest that year,

181
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,480
and you wouldn't let it go.

182
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,840
You made me plant this tree

as punishment.

184
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,030
Jinghe,

185
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,080
did you ever consider
that perhaps the archery contest

186
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,480
was just an excuse?

187
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,510
I don't believe you burned the Beauties

188
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,960
to win Mei Lin's favor.

189
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,150
What are you really up to?

190
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,200
Well,

191
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,320
what I want

192
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,030
is that supreme position.

193
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,790
That position belongs
to whoever is worthy.

194
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,120
If you've got the glory,

195
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,000
you can simply go for it
openly and honestly.

196
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,910
Why resort to using Xiyan spies

197
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,630
and underhanded methods?

198
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,600
General Yin,

199
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,080
you're overthinking it.

200
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,320
No matter which path I take,

201
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,720
I would never do anything
to harm my country.

202
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,360
Then what about these Xiyan spies?

203
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,480
General Yin, do you remember

204
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,480
the Zhonglin Mountain
where we used to hunt?

205
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,840
Come meet me there

206
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,000
in three days,

207
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,270
and you'll have your answer.

208
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,580
[Prince Jing's Mansion]

209
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,910
This was my failure.

210
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,030
Once I capture Zhang Yin,
I'll accept my punishment.

211
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,360
Send everyone.

212
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,670
Make sure he's captured alive.

213
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,270
Yes, my lord.

214
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,200
What?

215
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,910
He's still alive?

216
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,120
He escaped from Prince Jing's mansion

217
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,440
and fled to the outskirts.

218
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
Zhang Yin.

219
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,670
He's even more cunning than I thought.

220
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,510
He escaped from Prince Jing's grasp.

221
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,200
Take everyone.

222
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,550
This time,
I'll see him die with my own eyes.

223
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,390
Yes, Your Highness.

224
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,030
Attract them to Zhonglin Slope.

225
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,360
Zhang Yin is there.

226
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,550
The death-point hold
will only last for two hours.

227
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,750
The rest is up to you.

228
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,440
My lord.

229
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,270
Your Highness.

230
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,200
He's dead.

231
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:37,910
Hurry,

232
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,870
take the body away.

233
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:39,750
Yes, Your Highness.

234
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,120
Third Brother,

235
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,080
once again, you're too late.

236
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,600
This time,

237
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,270
I've won.

238
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,390
However,

239
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,630
no one wins forever.

240
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,150
Murong Jinghe!

241
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,390
Luo Mei?

242
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,840
You used General Yin
to stage the Xiyan spy plot,

243
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,270
so of course I could also use her

244
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,600
as my own witness.

245
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,360
A witness
who can expose Zhang Yin's death.

246
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,240
That arrow

247
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,550
bears the mark of the Eastern Palace.

248
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,840
Zhang Yin
was just a low-ranking official.

249
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,390
Even if you dragged his corpse
to Father,

250
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,960
he wouldn't take your word for it.

251
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,360
A mere body won't shake your position.

252
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,000
But it can plant a seed of doubt

253
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,870
in our father's heart.

254
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,960
The Wenhua Pavilion fire

255
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,750
was overseen by you alone.

256
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,960
If Father finds out

257
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,840
you silenced someone to cover it up...

258
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,390
After all your years
of careful maneuvering,

259
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,320
why ruin your image

260
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,600
in front of Father now?

261
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,150
So,

262
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,320
what do you want?

263
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,750
You know me well.

264
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,270
As long as you help me

265
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,360
solve the Xiyan spy situation,

266
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,320
I'll forget

267
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,120
I ever saw Zhang Yin today.

268
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,320
We both win a round,

269
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,840
how about that?

270
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,670
You won't lose anything.

271
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,670
Even now,

272
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,270
I've never wanted to see you dead.

273
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,200
Indeed.

274
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,000
You just wanted
to send me back to Jingbei.

275
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,630
But the contest between me and you
is far from over.

276
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,790
How could I leave the battlefield now?

277
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,550
Murong Jinghe!

278
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,030
Murong Jinghe!

279
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,320
General Yin.

280
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,240
I'm here.

281
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,270
Luomei suspects you

282
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,910
means Father suspects you.

283
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,720
Doesn't that bother you?

284
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,390
Thank you, for your cooperation.

285
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,790
Take the prey to Prince Jing's mansion.

286
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,000
Ask our people to hide immediately.

287
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,630
Yes, Your Highness.

288
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,960
Why is the Crown Prince here?

289
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,870
I invited Big Brother.

290
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,120
I was nearly ambushed,

291
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,320
and I'm in low spirits.

292
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,630
Only Big Brother

293
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,360
can help relieve my frustrations.

294
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,510
It's only natural for an older brother

295
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,270
to help his younger brother
in difficult times.

296
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,360
How long has it been

297
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,440
since we last came to the archery range?

298
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,120
Big Brother,

299
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,270
you know I'm not in the mood

300
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,390
for reminiscing right now.

301
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,630
Your Highness,

302
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,200
what's the deal
with the Xiyan spies case?

303
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,160
It was Gan Ning,
the Vice Minister of Defense,

304
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,640
who set a trap to frame Third Brother.

305
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,720
He misunderstood our brotherly bond,

306
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,680
thinking Prince Jing returned
to the capital

307
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,550
to compete for the throne,

308
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,440
so he wanted to send him back
to Jingbei.

309
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,350
Even though Gan Ning acted on his own,

310
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
you were wronged because of me.

311
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,550
I owe you an apology.

312
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,200
Sorry.

313
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,270
It's true that only Big Brother

314
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,510
can resolve my grievances.

315
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,880
How about we have a match,

316
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,590
like old times?

317
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,790
Luomei,

318
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,110
we all know.

319
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,240
I've always lost

320
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,590
here on the arrow field.

321
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,070
You have won before.

322
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,350
The only time

323
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,790
was because of you.

324
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,680
If you want to win,

325
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,440
win fairly.

326
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,400
I surrender.

327
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,920
If Big Brother hadn't let me win,

328
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,110
I wouldn't have won at all.

329
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,240
What's the point

330
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,240
in playing a game I can't win?

331
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,680
It's meaningless.

332
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,550
My grievances are resolved.

333
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,720
I won't interrupt the reunion

334
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,960
between you two any longer.

335
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,480
You're the only thing I refuse to lose,

336
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,920
Luomei.

337
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,270
- The Third Prince has won again.
- The Third Prince wins again.

338
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,310
Useless servants.

339
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,000
What kind of bow
did you give Prince Xuanlie?

340
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,550
I picked it myself.

341
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,200
They slack off

342
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,240
because you're too kind.

343
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,550
Use mine.

344
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,790
Xuanlie is much better than you.

345
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,270
With a better bow,
I'm sure he can beat you.

346
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,160
Let's try again.

347
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,270
Okay.

348
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,270
Let's have another match.

349
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,790
Luomei,

350
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:16,720
I've won.

351
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,640
See?

352
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,350
Like I said, you couldn't beat Xuanlie.

353
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,350
Third Brother is the best.

354
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,310
This time, I just had good luck.

355
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,790
But your archery is still better.

356
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,070
One day,

357
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,590
I'll surpass you, Big Brother.

358
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:32,830
Luomei,

359
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,920
you helped Big Brother win against me,

360
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:35,920
and I'm not even mad.

361
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,310
What's making you upset?

362
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,310
Father said

363
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,880
the military camp

364
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,160
is for men.

365
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,640
He said I'm not allowed
to come here anymore.

366
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,960
Why must women grow old
in the inner chambers

367
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,590
once they marry?

368
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,240
I refuse to marry!

369
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,030
Luomei,

370
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,550
don't worry.

371
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,400
When I become a great general,

372
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,240
I'll take you to the battlefield,

373
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,350
and we'll defend the country together.

374
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,510
Besides,

375
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,590
a female soldier stronger than the men,

376
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,110
why would I refuse that?

377
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,160
Really?

378
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,350
It's a promise, then.

379
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,270
It's a deal.

380
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,790
Protect the nation!

381
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,240
For Great Yan!

382
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,480
For Great Yan!

383
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,720
Protect the nation!

384
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,200
For Great Yan!

385
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
Protect the nation!

386
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,750
For Great Yan!

387
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,830
If it weren't for the bow
you gave me back then,

388
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,510
how could I have won?

389
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,680
Your Highness is a skilled archer.

390
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,000
The result was all in your hands.

391
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,160
I couldn't do much about it.

392
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,400
If I want to live a peaceful life

393
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,920
in the imperial harem,

394
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,240
I must keep losing.

395
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,030
Everyone thinks I'm lucky,

396
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,880
that even though my mother was lowborn

397
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,510
and died giving birth to me,

398
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:05,960
I was fortunate

399
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,920
to be raised by Empress Dejia.

400
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:12,960
Mother was kind to me.

401
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,160
But the kinder she was,

402
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,310
the more I suffered.

403
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,240
The servants at Rong'an Palace,

404
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,270
they've always feared

405
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,070
that I, the oldest son of His Majesty,

406
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,640
would outshine
their precious little master.

407
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,310
They've been against me from the start.

408
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,640
I knew from the beginning

409
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,030
that bow was faulty.

410
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,680
But because of you,

411
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,070
I had my first fair victory.

412
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,960
Since that day,

413
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,750
I've longed

414
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,960
to stand before you

415
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,350
and tell you

416
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,830
my heart.

417
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,920
Your Highness,

418
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,310
the Pingnan Army
doesn't just guard the throne.

419
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,000
It protects Great Yan's borders
and its people.

420
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,590
I earned my military achievements

421
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,440
to become a loyal subject of Great Yan.

422
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,680
I won't be used

423
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,200
as a pawn in your fight for the throne.

424
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,160
I don't want

425
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,590
the Pingnan Army's power.

426
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,590
I want you, Luomei.

427
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,030
Do you understand?

428
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,640
I've never forgotten your ambition.

429
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,270
The promise Third Brother made to you,

430
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,200
I'll fulfill it for you.

431
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,400
I have always said,

432
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,510
even if you become Empress,

433
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,030
the military power will remain yours.

434
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,000
You'll still be General Yin,

435
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,270
and I'll never confine you
to the imperial harem.

436
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,750
If I break this promise,

437
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:47,830
this vow,

438
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:48,920
General Yin,

439
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,350
you can make it public.

440
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,550
I cannot bear

441
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,510
your feelings.

442
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,400
The Lord ordered

443
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,070
you to wait here.

444
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,480
You won?

445
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,830
We have won.

446
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,790
And the Beauties?

447
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,110
Do not worry.

448
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,880
I will find a way

449
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,110
to send them back to Xiyan safely.

450
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:19,790
Are you hurt?

451
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,000
Why didn't you wear the Gold Silk Armor?

452
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,550
I did it on purpose.

453
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,510
Otherwise,
I couldn't fool the Crown Prince.

454
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,270
It's just a small injury.

455
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,440
It doesn't matter.

456
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,550
Here's some wound medicine.

457
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:55,920
It might...

458
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,510
sting a bit.

459
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,640
My lord,

460
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,550
I'm not afraid of pain.

461
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:31,830
Does it hurt?

462
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,070
It's nothing.

463
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,750
Just a minor injury.

464
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,270
It won't kill me.

465
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,680
You're not afraid of death,

466
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,830
nor of pain.

467
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:45,750
Is there anything

468
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,960
that you fear?

469
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,790
Yeah.

470
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,920
I'm afraid of my mother.

471
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,400
One only truly values life
when they have someone to care for.

472
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,160
Remember what you once said?

473
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,640
Your hairpin is also a bridge

474
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,720
between the living and the dead.

475
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,750
I believe

476
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,310
your mother is watching from above.

477
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,590
Seeing you fight so hard,

478
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,550
she must be worried too.

479
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,440
Who's there?

480
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,350
Who?

481
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,110
Show yourself!

482
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,110
Who's there?

483
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,070
Come out!

484
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,790
Who?

485
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,110
Minister Zhang.

486
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,500
[Pang Qi]

487
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,750
And you are?

488
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,400
Minister Zhang, don't you remember me?

489
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,680
Weibei Army.

490
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,350
Vanguard Battalion.

491
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,590
Pang Qi.

492
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,070
You're supposed to be dead!

493
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,480
So are you.

494
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:52,720
Confess.

495
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,790
Confess to every soldier
of the Weibei Army.

496
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,720
Confess!

497
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,160
Commander Pang,

498
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:00,750
I'll confess.

499
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,750
- I'll confess.
- Confess to them!

500
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,750
Yes.

501
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,160
Weibei Army Sheriff Liu Cheng.

502
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,480
I confess.

503
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,270
Weibei Army

504
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,680
Deputy General Yang Donghu.

505
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,830
I confess.

506
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,550
Weibei Army Company Leader Wang Futian.

507
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,400
I confess.

508
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,680
General Pang. Drink.

509
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,200
There is no more Weibei Army
in this world,

510
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,680
and yet you stubbornly follow me,

511
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,030
willing to live in a place like this.

512
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,110
I swear I'll take you.

513
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,310
I'll take them.

514
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,310
out of here.

515
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,270
We'll live in the sunlight again.

516
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,640
This sachet

517
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,680
should help him sleep better, right?

518
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,200
My lord?

519
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,480
Why haven't you left yet?

520
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,830
Have you been drinking?

521
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,880
Don't touch me.

522
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,350
In your hallucination,

523
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,920
this is exactly how you treated me.

524
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,160
So fierce.

525
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,480
Why did you drink so much?

526
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,200
I had to be fierce,

527
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,200
otherwise I'd get bullied.

528
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,680
You, so fierce,

529
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,160
yet still afraid of your mother?

530
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,110
My mother
always wanted me to get married.

531
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,440
She was eager to send me off.

532
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,200
And you don't want to get married?

533
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,110
It's mostly because it's hard
to find a good live-in son-in-law.

534
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,960
Why must you find a live-in son-in-law?

535
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,350
My father is always away

536
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,590
quarrying stone,

537
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,110
so I'm the only one
who can take care of my mother.

538
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,480
I planned
to take care of her my whole life.

539
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,110
So fear...

540
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,350
comes from love.

541
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,310
Are you afraid of me, then?

542
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,550
You are a good person.

543
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,000
I have no reason to fear you.

544
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,240
I'm not a good person.

545
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,720
I remember

546
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,550
every single thing

547
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:23,920
you've done to me.

548
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:25,640
I...

549
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,200
I even remember

550
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,310
that the second time

551
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,550
you saw me,

552
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,160
you bit my lip.

553
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:45,640
Well then,

554
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,160
if you hold a grudge,

555
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,110
you can bite me back.

556
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,070
- Now,
- You...

557
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,920
we can call it even.

558
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,880
I'll be holding
onto your hairpin for now.

559
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:31,030
Once we've taken down the Crown Prince,

560
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,030
I'll give it back to you.

561
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,270
If you want to talk to your mother,

562
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,960
come to me.

563
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,440
Gan Ning, a mere vice minister,

564
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:15,190
had the audacity to set up a trap
to frame a prince.

565
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,920
Crown Prince,

566
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,920
do you realize your guilt?

567
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:20,880
Father,

568
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,510
I failed to properly manage
my subordinates.

569
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,280
I accept any punishment you deem fit.

570
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,320
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

571
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,550
If not for the Crown Prince,

572
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,590
this matter

573
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,190
wouldn't have been resolved so swiftly.

574
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,920
General Yin, you may rise.

575
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,440
Thank you, Your Majesty.

576
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,550
The Xiyan spy matter

577
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,630
didn't cause a scandal,
all thanks to you.

578
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,630
You've returned to the capital,

579
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,360
and should have been given some rest.

580
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,590
Who knew

581
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,710
all these troubles would arise
to keep you busy?

582
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,320
It is my duty

583
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,710
to share Your Majesty's burdens.

584
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,190
Good.

585
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,070
Conclude this matter swiftly.

586
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,320
Gan Ning

587
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,440
will be executed in secret.

588
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,510
As for the Beauties,

589
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,400
make sure they are comforted.

590
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,070
But keep it quiet.

591
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,230
Avoid stirring up tensions
between the two nations.

592
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:13,880
Your Majesty,

593
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,960
I believe

594
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,150
that after being falsely accused,
these Xiyan Beauties

595
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,630
will undoubtedly harbor resentment.

596
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,190
It would be inappropriate for them
to continue the peace-making marriage.

597
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:25,150
Why not send them back
to Xiyan with Mr. Yue Qin?

598
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,320
This would show
Your Majesty's magnanimity,

599
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,190
and quell the rumors.

600
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,150
Okay.

601
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,190
Then proceed

602
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,630
according to General Yin's suggestion.

603
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

604
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,960
I'll take my leave.

605
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,920
Gan Ning borrowed his courage from you!

606
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,510
Servants like him only follow the wind.

607
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,360
If you weren't harboring concerns
about Jinghe,

608
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,480
would Gan Ning have dared
frame a prince to prove his loyalty?

609
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,190
Father,

610
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,880
I bear no ill will

611
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,630
toward Third Brother at all.

612
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,550
If you believe

613
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,510
I'm unfit for the role,

614
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,590
I am willing to give

615
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,760
the title of Crown Prince to him.

616
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,000
Enough.

617
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:38,590
Crown Prince,

618
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:42,590
you're responsible
for the future of Great Yan.

619
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,070
My expectations for you

620
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,110
are naturally higher than for Jinghe.

621
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,630
He's never been in good health,

622
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,480
and though his actions are reckless,

623
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,400
as his elder brother,

624
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,710
you must bear more responsibility.

625
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,630
I understand, Father.

626
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,480
I will heed your teachings.

627
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:10,070
His Majesty has granted you the right
to choose your own husband,

628
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,800
General Yin, that means

629
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,960
he hopes you will follow your heart.

630
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,110
I truly care for Mei.

631
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,230
I can't bear for her
to suffer any injustice.

632
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,320
Luomei.

633
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,070
people change

634
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,960
as they grow up.

635
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,070
My lord.

636
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:18,960
My lord.

637
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:22,000
The Xiyan spy matter
has been fully resolved.

638
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,000
The Crown Prince
has gotten what he deserved.

639
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,070
I heard he had been kowtowing
in the Yanming Palace for hours.

640
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,880
Did Father forgive him?

641
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,800
In the end,
Father still cares for Big Brother.

642
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,550
But truly, His Majesty

643
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,880
still favors you, my lord.

644
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,630
Today in court,

645
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,840
His Majesty even mentioned
General Yin's marriage.

646
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,510
In fact, His Majesty would prefer
to see a marriage

647
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,280
between you and the Yin family.

648
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,920
This came straight from Eunuch Liu.

649
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,590
Besides,

650
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,840
His Majesty has decreed
that none of the Beauties

651
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,630
can leave the Court of State Ceremonial
without permission.

652
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:57,880
I believe

653
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,800
His Majesty is giving you a hint.

654
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,630
Is Father trying
to play matchmaker again?

655
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,280
Tell Lianxiu.

656
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:06,760
When Mei Lin is ennobled
and enters the mansion,

657
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,230
she is to be received
with the ceremony of a concubine.

658
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,440
Hopefully,

659
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,110
that will put an end

660
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:11,920
to Father's thoughts of matchmaking.

661
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:12,880
Yes, Your Highness.

662
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:26,620
[Shuanglin Courtyard]

663
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,920
Shuanglin Courtyard...

664
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,550
Isn't this courtyard a bit small?

665
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,590
My lord, besides your Zhanyue Pavilion,

666
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,800
Shuanglin Courtyard is the largest.

667
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,230
Moreover, it's the closest
to Zhanyue Pavilion,

668
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,360
and it gets the best sunlight.

669
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,480
Do you mean

670
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,230
for Miss Mei Lin

671
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,960
to move into Zhanyue Pavilion?

672
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,320
No, Shuanglin Courtyard will do.

673
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,670
Breaking the rules

674
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:54,880
wouldn't be good.

675
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,710
You are the least concerned
with rules, my lord.

676
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,630
Leave it as is.

677
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,440
The Imperial Agricultural Department

678
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,920
recently cultivated
a few new green peony plants.

679
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,630
His Majesty gifted one to us.

680
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,630
My lord, if you enjoy flowers...

681
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,670
I prefer these Undying Flowers.

682
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,190
[Xieying Pavilion]

683
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,630
Buried in the soil, it finds its home.

684
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,320
In times of famine, it fills bellies.

685
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,190
in times of prosperity, it adorns hair.

686
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,510
Much better than any peony.

687
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,000
It's been a long time
since I've seen you so happy.

688
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,440
Now,

689
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,670
we can call it even.

690
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,590
I'll be holding
onto your hairpin for now.

691
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,710
Once we've taken down the Crown Prince,

692
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,360
I'll give it back to you.

693
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,800
If you want to talk to your mother,

694
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,190
come to me.

695
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,480
You are worried about me,

696
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,800
right?

697
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,150
Miss Mei Lin,

698
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,190
time to drink your medicine.

699
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,510
Attendant Liu.

700
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,550
Candied fruit?

701
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,320
Prince Jing said that soon,

702
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:12,230
you'll be able to taste again.

703
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,440
These candied fruits

704
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:17,360
were prepared especially for you

705
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,280
to take the bitterness
out of the medicine.

706
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,480
Thank you, Attendant Liu.

707
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,550
In a few days, you'll be ennobled.

708
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,360
When you enter
the Prince Jing's mansion,

709
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,760
make sure to thank him properly.

710
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,320
Once my taste returns,

711
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:31,960
I'll thank him immediately.

712
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,480
I'll take my leave now.

713
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,280
