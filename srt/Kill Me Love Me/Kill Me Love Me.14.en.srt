193
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,000
Qingyan has been serving Prince Jing
since childhood.

194
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,320
Ten years ago,

195
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,910
we fought once
on the military training ground.

196
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,000
Won't it be impossible

197
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,080
to cover up the fact

198
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,440
that His Highness and Your Excellency
have released the prisoners

199
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,840
and attempted
to assassinate Prince Jing?

200
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,080
Sun Tong,

201
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,320
listen carefully.

202
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,240
Take the fake account book

203
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,630
and report to the court.

204
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,150
You'll claim that Yang Zhen

205
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,030
was amassing wealth
by secretly trading prisoners.

206
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,510
Unexpectedly, an accident occurred,

207
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,240
allowing the prisoners of war to escape
to the hunting ground

208
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,080
and disturb His Majesty.

209
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,440
Feeling ashamed,

210
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,320
Yang Zhen committed suicide

211
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,240
and is already dead.

212
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:33,910
Your Excellency,

213
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,840
why do you...

214
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,320
I have to take the blame.

215
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,080
Only then
can His Majesty escape unscathed.

216
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,630
And you can escape too.

217
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,120
We can defect to Prince Jing!

218
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,550
No.

219
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,030
Prince Jing, favored by His Majesty,

220
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,200
opposes His Highness whenever he can.

221
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
If the throne

222
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,440
is seized by someone so ridiculous,
who kills so casually,

223
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,630
Great Yan will be in grave danger.

224
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,670
The people will suffer.

225
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,270
But, Your Excellency,

226
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,510
though for His Highness' kindness,

227
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,960
you don't have to
sacrifice your life for him.

228
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,030
I was merely the son of a stableman.

229
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,080
If not for His Highness
opening the academies,

230
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,120
I would never have received education
and become an official.

231
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,200
After I joined the court,
it was His Highness

232
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,320
who disregarded my background

233
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,390
and promoted me.

234
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,840
I believe that His Highness

235
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,200
will be the final victor.

236
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,200
Sun Tong,

237
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,670
I need you to do one more thing.

238
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:51,870
After I'm gone,

239
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,750
immediately send a letter
to the Eastern Palace.

240
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,440
Your Highness,

241
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,790
farewell.

242
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,840
Master!

243
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,030
Commander Yang often spoke
of the jujube tree in his hometown,

244
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,550
wishing to return someday.

245
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,200
Now he has died far from home,
bearing a tarnished reputation.

246
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,440
Commander Yang

247
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,390
is gone.

248
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,270
Your Highness,
please accept my condolences.

249
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,750
Send someone
to take Yang Zhen back to his hometown

250
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,000
and bury him beneath the jujube tree
in his courtyard.

251
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,000
Provide for his family
for three generations.

252
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,510
Yes, Your Highness.

253
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,360
Your Highness,

254
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,390
now that Commander Yang
has taken the blame,

255
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,510
the prisoner Qingyan rescued

256
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,720
poses no threat,

257
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,550
no matter what he knows.

258
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,630
Jinghe took such a risk.

259
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,550
It must be related to
the old case in Qingzhou.

260
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,840
Set up checkpoints along the route

261
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
to intercept Qingyan
and his companions.

262
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,120
Don't arouse Luomei's suspicion.

263
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:49,790
Yes, Your Highness.

264
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:51,790
Yang Zhen,

265
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,600
thank you.

266
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,350
I want to go home.

267
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,000
I want to go home.

268
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,720
He's feigning madness.

269
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,270
No.

270
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,590
He seems genuinely mad.

271
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,270
Take him back to Zhaojing.

272
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,680
If he's truly ill,

273
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,680
let the physicians treat him.

274
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,920
If he's faking it,

275
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,160
His Lordship will know what to do.

276
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:20,880
I want to go home.

277
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,400
Let's go.

278
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,510
I want to go home.

279
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,200
Move.

280
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,480
I want to go home

281
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,480
and eat white steamed buns.

282
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,200
I want to eat steamed buns.

283
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,960
I want steamed buns.

284
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,480
Hurry up.

285
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:34,830
Halt.

286
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,400
Let's go.

287
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,480
Don't kill me.

288
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,920
Don't kill me.

289
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:58,880
Set up a checkpoint here.

290
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,110
No one shall pass.

291
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,000
Yes.

292
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,310
My Lord,

293
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,160
should I shoot down
the Crown Prince's bird?

294
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:20,790
No.

295
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,590
If you shoot the falcon,

296
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,920
the Crown Prince will know we're
in Zhongshan.

297
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,350
Then what's your plan, my Lord?

298
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,310
There's no need
to ask his Lordship.

299
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,030
He will issue the orders
when he's ready.

300
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,590
I'm worried about Qingyan.

301
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,590
[My Lord, Li Qing is rescued.]
My Lord,

302
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,200
[Surrounded by Imperial Guards. From Yan]
Li Qing is rescued.

303
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,400
I'm surrounded by Imperial Guards.

304
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,000
Shoot the falcon.

305
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,070
My Lord, aren't you worried
the Crown Prince will discover us?

306
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,200
There's been a change of plan.

307
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,160
Qingyan is in danger.

308
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,110
Yes, my Lord.

309
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,310
Zhongshan.

310
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,070
Prince Jing is hiding in Zhongshan.

311
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,920
But Zhongshan is too vast.

312
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,000
Searching it will require manpower.

313
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,550
Intercepting Qingyan
will require manpower too.

314
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,070
Well...

315
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,720
Gather all our forces.

316
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,880
Send everyone to Zhongshan.

317
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,070
Block every exit.

318
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,830
You must find Prince Jing.

319
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,720
Yes, Your Highness.

320
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,000
Everyone, listen up!

321
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,160
You two, guard this spot.

322
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,200
The rest of you, follow me.

323
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,000
Yes.

324
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,830
If the Crown Prince
discovers anything amiss,

325
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,440
I will reveal my location

326
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,680
to buy you time.

327
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,270
No.

328
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,750
You are putting yourself in danger...

329
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,510
Follow my command.

330
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,440
Yes, my Lord.

331
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,960
Charge over with me.

332
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,200
Let's go.

333
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,440
Don't kill me.

334
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,240
It takes only a day

335
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,790
to travel from Lushan to Zhongshan.

336
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,920
Let's take the opportunity to get ready.

337
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,510
The earth stirs,

338
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:28,880
but the sky does not respond.

339
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,590
Tomorrow morning,

340
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:31,880
there will be only light fog.

341
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,830
Don't kill me.

342
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,400
Don't kill me.

343
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,440
I want steamed buns.

344
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,550
Don't kill me.

345
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,590
We're safe now.

346
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,310
You must take him back to Zhaojing.

347
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,030
Yes.

348
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,070
I want steamed buns.

349
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,720
White steamed buns.

350
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,720
I want steamed buns.

351
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,160
You fear ravens?

352
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,270
I don't fear them.

353
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,510
I just despise them.

354
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,830
Search thoroughly.

355
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,000
If you encounter Prince Jing,

356
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,790
release the signal.

357
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,680
Yes, sir.

358
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:28,920
Go.

359
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:17,920
Extinguish the fire!

360
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,720
Release the signal!

361
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:36,880
They're just ahead.

362
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,200
Chase after them.

363
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:39,400
Chase after them!

364
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,790
Kill Prince Jing!

365
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,240
Pang!

366
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,310
Pang.

367
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,680
Pang!

368
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,070
General,

369
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,350
I, Pang Qi, of the Weibei Army,

370
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,160
have finished my mission.

371
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,400
Pang.

372
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,480
Pang!

373
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:09,590
Mei Lin,

374
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,680
take his Lordship and leave quickly.

375
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,480
My Lord.

376
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,510
My Lord, leave now!

377
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,030
Let's go.

378
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,160
Let's go!

379
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,640
Chase after them.

380
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,160
Yes, sir.

381
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,160
Let's go.

382
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,830
Let's split up
and head for Xiaoyun Peak.

383
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,110
A former soldier of the Weibei Army.

384
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,200
Yes.

385
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,070
They can't run far.

386
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,680
Your Highness,

387
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,960
there are traces of Prince Jing
inside the cabin,

388
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:26,960
but no one is in there.

389
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:28,960
With Jinghe's personality,

390
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,310
even if he's cornered,

391
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,790
he won't give up without a fight.

392
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,200
Your Highness,

393
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,640
that's Prince Jing's signal fire.

394
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:44,720
Xiaoyun Peak.

395
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,790
They're at Xiaoyun Peak.

396
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,310
Your Highness, should we
go after them?

397
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,110
If the Imperial Guards see the signal,

398
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,350
they'll rush there too.

399
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,920
How did you know the Crown Prince
would definitely head to Xiaoyun Peak?

400
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,960
Because he can't afford to take a risk.

401
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,350
Searching the mountain again

402
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,640
will take a day.

403
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,310
But checking Xiaoyun Peak

404
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,590
takes only half a day.

405
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,720
If the Crown Prince wants to kill me,

406
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,200
he'll have to take the risk.

407
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,590
Let's go.

408
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,400
Only when we reach Lushan

409
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,440
will we win.

410
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,590
We'll go back to Lushan from here?

411
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,110
The path is rugged,

412
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,270
but it's safe.

413
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,960
There are no climbing holds
on this cliff.

414
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,750
You have considered even this.

415
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,750
When I was a child,
I took this route.

416
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,440
I was at Sunset Cliff.

417
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,720
if not for the accident,

418
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,070
I could have slowly climbed down here.

419
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,680
I'll go first.

420
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,160
There's water and food

421
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,550
along this path.

422
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,110
The pursuing soldiers
have been diverted by Qingyan.

423
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,350
For now, we're indeed safe.

424
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,480
But if the Crown Prince

425
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,590
sends people to encircle us
from Sunset Cliff,

426
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,400
we'll be walking into his trap.

427
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,310
He won't dare.

428
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,480
I disappeared at Sunset Cliff.

429
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,920
Father will certainly
have his trusted Imperial Guards

430
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,030
stationed at Sunset Cliff.

431
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,350
Unless the Crown Prince
wishes to die with me,

432
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,590
he won't

433
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,960
try to kill me
right under Father's nose.

434
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,310
It's just larks.

435
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,350
I despise ravens

436
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,590
because they always wait for death.

437
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,200
Ravens only eat the dead.

438
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,270
As long as you're breathing,

439
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,270
they'll fear you.

440
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,400
The truth is, I'm afraid of dying.

441
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,750
But I can't die,

442
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,160
not on the way to revenge.

443
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,270
What about you, my Lord?

444
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,680
What do you fear?

445
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,160
I fear losing.

446
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,680
Anyone who's been on a battlefield

447
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,200
fears losing.

448
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,200
The battlefield

449
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,270
is a slaughterhouse.

450
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,030
Except killing,

451
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,510
there's no time
to think of anything else.

452
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,240
When your comrades die,

453
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,310
you have only three seconds to grieve.

454
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,030
The Weibei Army had an order.

455
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,720
During the battle,

456
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,110
if a comrade fell,

457
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,200
we would tap our chests three times.

458
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,200
That was our way of mourning.

459
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,160
On the battlefield,

460
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,160
only victory

461
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,030
ends the killing.

462
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,830
For generals,

463
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,240
winning

464
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:03,920
as fast as they can

465
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,960
is the greatest mercy.

466
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,830
It seems

467
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:10,920
I want to win so badly

468
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:13,880
that I've forgotten

469
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,790
I'm no longer General Weibei.

470
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,920
Taking revenge

471
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,400
isn't the same as going to war.

472
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,110
Your Highness,

473
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,110
we've been tricked.

474
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,790
They indeed returned to Lushan
by this path.

475
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,100
Take the trail to pursue them.

476
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:03,480
Yes.

477
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,030
Stop the pursuit.

478
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,640
We're a day behind.

479
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,030
There's no way to catch up.

480
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,270
Your Highness,

481
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,790
this path leads only to Sunset Cliff.

482
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,070
We can send a message to our men

483
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,830
to have them encircle the cliff
from below.

484
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,480
But the top of Sunset Cliff
is guarded by Father's men.

485
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,000
Our forces can't get down.

486
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,440
How many days will it take
to return from here to Sunset Cliff?

487
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,000
At least five days.

488
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,830
If a man doesn't eat or drink
for five days,

489
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,030
what will happen?

490
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,200
What are you carrying

491
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,830
that smells so foul?

492
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,110
General,

493
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,350
it's the remains of a hunt.

494
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,590
The stench from the corpse
must be overwhelming.

495
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,790
I was ordered to bury it

496
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,750
far from the hunting palace.

497
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,000
There's a ban at Sunset Cliff.

498
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,270
Bury it elsewhere.

499
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,240
Yes.

500
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:47,710
The water is poisoned.

501
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,230
The Crown Prince did this.

502
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,510
He poisoned the upstream to trap us.

503
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,710
Now he must have sent his men

504
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,360
to guard at the bottom.

505
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,670
There's no way back.

506
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,030
We can only move forward.

507
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:01,960
But what if we

508
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,190
do not eat or drink...

509
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,960
The Crown Prince will

510
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,230
keep poisoning the water to trap us.

511
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,360
Qingyan will

512
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,590
surely notice this

513
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,670
and come to our aid.

514
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,760
But if he can't arrive in time...

515
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,320
I once

516
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,400
led an attack on the Xiyan royal camp.

517
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,110
The vanguard could last four days
at most without food or water.

518
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,400
I managed to crawl out
of a pile of corpses back then.

519
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:32,630
Now,

520
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,000
I can do it again.

521
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,320
We'll survive together.

522
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,960
Cheers.

523
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,190
His Majesty is worried
about Prince Jing now.

524
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,630
Who has the mood to hunt?

525
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,550
Now,

526
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,880
we're down to roasting a few wild hares.

527
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,760
After all these days,

528
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,000
we haven't seen
a single living prisoner.

529
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,400
Is this an act?

530
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,320
Are you saying

531
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,190
Prince Jing disappeared on purpose?

532
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,280
Why would he do that?

533
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,360
It's a test.

534
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,360
Prince Jing is testing
His Majesty's favor toward him.

535
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,030
Look.

536
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,510
Now the whole court knows

537
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,150
the Third Prince
is His Majesty's favorite.

538
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,000
In terms of talent and influence,

539
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,630
the Crown Prince far surpasses
Prince Jing.

540
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:31,480
But nothing

541
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,110
matters more than His Majesty's favor.

542
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,320
There's no point speculating now.

543
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,480
Let's just

544
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,030
find Prince Jing first.

545
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,880
Cut that out.

546
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,030
Come on. Cheers.

547
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,480
Everyone says
Prince Jing disappeared on purpose.

548
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,230
Your Highness, don't worry.

549
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,000
Who's worried about him?

550
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,030
That man is full of schemes.

551
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,840
Your Highness, His Majesty isn't here.

552
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,590
Why do you care about
Prince Jing's whereabouts?

553
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,710
His Majesty hasn't eaten properly
for days.

554
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,400
I'm worried about His Majesty.

555
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,280
His Majesty's been nice to me.

556
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,550
But there's nothing I can do.

557
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,630
Tell me.

558
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:31,400
Will the gods
protect the Emperor of Great Yan?

559
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,400
I'm not sure.

560
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,230
But they'll surely

561
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,710
protect Your Highness.

562
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,230
Didn't you pray to the gods

563
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,760
for Mei Lin to be with Mr. Yue Qin?

564
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,000
Maybe it's a sign from the gods.

565
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,590
That's why Prince Jing hasn't returned.

566
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,320
I didn't mean it like that.

567
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,480
Even if Prince Jing
isn't a good person,

568
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,360
he's still a human life.

569
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,110
Then you should quickly ask the gods
to take back your wish.

570
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,630
Gods,

571
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,480
all my wishes were sincere.

572
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,000
Please grant them.

573
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,190
But I also don't want anything wrong
to happen to Prince Jing.

574
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,480
Please guide Prince Jing back safely.

575
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,880
If Prince Jing returns,

576
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,360
His Majesty will regain his appetite.

577
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,000
His Majesty hasn't eaten properly
for days.

578
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,480
Your Highness,

579
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,190
it's getting late.

580
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,840
Let's head back.

581
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,550
Your Highness,

582
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,280
General Yin has returned
with reinforcements.

583
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,070
It seems

584
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,320
she was injured by a prisoner.

585
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,400
Forgive my rudeness.

586
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,360
I heard you were wounded.

587
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,670
Where's your injury?

588
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,670
Who hurt you?

589
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,440
I had a minor injury
during the suppression.

590
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,320
It doesn't matter.

591
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,070
The court physician is outside the tent.

592
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,400
Let him treat you.

593
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,480
I was delayed half a day
for getting the reinforcements.

594
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,590
For Prince Jing,
that's half a day of more danger.

595
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,880
The most important thing now

596
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,030
is to find Prince Jing.

597
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:45,710
Luomei,

598
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:46,920
there's news of Jinghe.

599
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:49,920
Why don't you

600
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,920
join me in reporting to Father?

601
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,590
You said Jinghe was in Zhongshan

602
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,000
and lit a signal fire.

603
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,440
The patrolling Imperial Guards saw it.

604
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,920
I reached Zhongshan

605
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,070
but found no trace of Jinghe.

606
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,150
I only found a hunter's cabin

607
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,150
stocked with supplies
of food and medicine.

608
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,440
It didn't look like
it belonged to a hunter.

609
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,960
Could Prince Jing
have disappeared on purpose?

610
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,960
Forgive my presumption.

611
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,440
Do you think so too?

612
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,230
Jinghe and I have raised falcons
together.

613
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,280
I found a dead falcon in Zhongshan.

614
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,000
The arrow in it

615
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,280
has the insignia
of Prince Jing's Mansion.

616
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,510
What is Jinghe up to now?

617
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,230
Father, rest assured.

618
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,400
At least it indicates

619
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,760
Third Brother is currently safe.

620
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,030
Fine.

621
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,360
It's good to have some news.

622
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,840
Division One of the Lulin Army

623
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,030
will stay at the hunting palace.

624
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,550
You will personally lead Division Two

625
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,880
and bring Jinghe back.

626
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,440
No matter what he is up to,

627
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,710
bring him back first.

628
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,880
Tell him it's my decree.

629
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,920
But you must ensure his safety.

630
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,190
Yes, Father.

631
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,230
Your Majesty,

632
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,360
I can assist His Highness

633
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,400
in the search for Prince Jing.

634
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,000
I was delayed in deploying the troops.

635
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,440
If Prince Jing suffers any harm,

636
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,150
I will not be able to escape the blame.

637
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,000
This isn't your fault, General Yin.

638
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,000
Yang Zhen of the Lulin Army
released the prisoners of war.

639
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,800
He's already killed himself
to escape punishment.

640
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,400
His deputy, Sun Tong,
even dared to harm you, General Yin.

641
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,840
He should be severely punished.

642
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,400
Deal with the Lulin Army's affairs

643
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,000
as you see fit.

644
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,440
General Yin,

645
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,800
assist the Crown Prince

646
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:35,800
in finding Jinghe.

647
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

648
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,400
Yes, Father.
