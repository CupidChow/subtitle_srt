1
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,880
You two

2
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,680
broke up?

3
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,280
No,

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,300
we were just ordinary friends to begin with.

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,000
Do you really like him that much?

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,960
Now that the misunderstanding is cleared up,

7
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,200
my shoulder

8
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,490
is always available for you to lean on.

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,560
Forget it.

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,360
I'm leaving.

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,400
Bye-bye.

12
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,480
Come on, come over here and help me out, quick!

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,280
Hey, hey, hey!

14
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,400
Yi Xinran, have you been drinking?

15
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,330
What's going on?

16
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,760
She got dumped by Qingkong, that's what.

17
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,240
I've always said

18
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,039
you should date someone with comparable talents.

19
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,090
Bai Qianyu, can't you speak like a normal person?

20
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,440
Yi Xinran.

21
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:34,120
Yi Xinran.

22
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,280
Get down.

23
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,520
Move aside.

24
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,720
My position.

25
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,759
Are you crazy, Guan Ling?

26
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,800
How to make a girl like you again.

27
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,479
First, don't be a simp.

28
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,120
You need to give her space.

29
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,160
What a coincidence.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,130
This doesn't count as simping, right?

31
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,079
This.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,040
just left.

33
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,480
Second, showcase yourself like crazy.

34
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,440
Let her appreciate your talents.

35
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,320
It's enough just to watch you from afar.

36
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,340
I guess this counts as talent, right?

37
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,480
Third, win over her best friend.

38
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,720
Use external help.

39
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,960
Qingkong

40
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,320
Why did you look for me?

41
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,720
Yi Xinran said she doesn't like me anymore.

42
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,960
I want you to help me.

43
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,220
Make her like me again.

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,240
That's easy.

45
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,940
Bring some snacks.

46
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:01,940
Mm-hmm.

47
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,360
First,

48
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,880
find important places

49
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,280
in the school for you two.

50
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,760
Xinran, my stomach hurts.

51
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,890
Wait for me a moment.

52
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,280
What's going on?

53
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,800
Just these rice crackers are a bit dry.

54
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
Drink some water.

55
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,720
Second, use the weather to your advantage.

56
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,440
It's really hot today.

57
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,480
If only there was a little breeze right now.

58
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,920
Finally,

59
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,520
create a surprise.

60
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,370
Just like in Korean dramas.

61
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,400
Korean dramas?

62
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,480
Blow that way, blow that way.

63
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,400
Harder.

64
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,240
Put more effort into it.

65
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,080
That way, that way.

66
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,840
Actually,

67
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,060
I've been feeling really awful these past few days.

68
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,520
I'm afraid of hurting you again.

69
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,520
Actually,

70
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,600
we can be a couple

71
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,000
who can't touch each other.

72
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,760
That's not it either.

73
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We can't.
