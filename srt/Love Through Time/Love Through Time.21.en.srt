1
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,640
This place

2
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,920
is nice, isn't it?

3
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,520
It's quite a view.

4
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,840
Drowning your sorrows in alcohol like this

5
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,010
will only make you more miserable.

6
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,520
Since you have the whole forest,

7
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,600
why hang yourself on just one tree?

8
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,520
Have you ever loved someone?

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,400
Do you understand the feeling

10
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,800
of a passionate love?

11
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,289
How do you know I haven't loved?

12
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,240
The kind of love where you can only watch from afar,

13
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,760
isn't that even harder?

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,480
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,880
It's okay, senior.

16
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,320
anyway,

17
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,640
we still have some memories.

18
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,000
Right?

19
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,400
Cheers.

20
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,160
Get up, get up, get up!

21
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,400
It's bad, hurry!

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,920
What's going on?

23
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,320
There are photos of you and Jia Yan hugging all over the school.

24
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,920
Photos of you two embracing.

25
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,840
What?

26
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,800
Yi Xinran.

27
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,520
That's her.

28
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,079
hugging and embracing someone.

29
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:48,560
Because of you, it's wonderful.

30
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,290
It's wonderful because of you.

31
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,680
Stop filming, stop filming, stop filming!

32
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,400
Stop filming!

33
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,880
There's nothing worth filming. Stop it!

34
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,560
Stop filming!

35
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,720
Delete the photos.

36
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,720
What are you doing? I'm warning you.

37
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,760
Why are you touching my phone?

38
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,560
Stop filming!

39
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,480
Everyone, stop filming!

40
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,080
Delete the photos quickly.

41
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,040
Yi Xinran,

42
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,940
I believe you're not that kind of person.

43
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,200
Put down your phones. Stop filming.

44
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,079
Delete all the photos quickly.

45
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,480
Let's go, let's go, let's go. It's over.

46
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,680
Everyone, disperse.

47
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,360
Qingkong.

48
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,280
It's not what you think.

49
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,440
But it's just as well for you to forget about me.

50
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,760
Xinran.

51
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,570
I won't let anyone hurt you.

52
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,600
Yi Xinran.

53
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,760
What's going on here?

54
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,890
I don't want to say anything right now.

55
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,680
Don't be like this.

56
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,200
What exactly happened?

57
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,880
I never would have guessed.

58
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,540
Yi Xinran, you're quite the player, aren't you?

59
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,200
You just went camping with Qingkong,

60
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,520
and now you're with another guy,

61
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,680
all cuddled up.

62
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,560
This time management,

63
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,680
I'm really impressed.

64
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,160
Bai Qianyu.

65
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,600
If you keep talking nonsense, I'll tear your mouth apart.

66
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,620
Ugly people often act strangely.

67
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,650
arguing with you

68
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,200
just lowers my IQ.

69
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,000
A petty person has gained power.

70
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,800
Don't pay attention to her.

71
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,200
The most important thing for us now

72
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,460
is to find Jia Yan first

73
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,850
and figure out what's really going on.

74
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,040
Never mind.

75
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,000
Never mind.

76
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,520
Why not use it?

77
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,240
We must resolve this matter.

78
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,100
We must make him come and clarify.

79
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,340
Bai Qianyu.

80
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,730
Why are the photos everywhere now?

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Stay away from me.

82
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:59,820
I don't want any more rumors spreading about us.

83
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,930
You're really something, Bai Qianyu.

84
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,960
You're biting the hand that feeds you.

85
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,020
You play the game better than anyone.

86
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,720
Just you wait.

87
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,800
I'm going to report this right now.

88
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,060
What are you afraid of?

89
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,650
Yi Xinran is the one at a disadvantage now.

90
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,700
I just want to make Yi Xinran sick.

91
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,690
And make Qingkong sick too.

92
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,210
Isn't this what you wanted as well?

93
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,520
May you both die a terrible death.

94
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,000
So,

95
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,080
there are others who hate those two as well.

96
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,720
They played me too.

97
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,720
It seems

98
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,680
we have a common enemy.

99
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,360
So,

100
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,160
you want to work together?

101
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,400
I think

102
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,880
I have a plan.

103
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,240
But I told you later that I didn't want to anymore.

104
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,960
That's why I went to take secret photos.

105
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,120
if you had agreed to continue working with me then,

106
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,580
would I have had to do this?

107
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,700
I don't find it disgusting at all.

108
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
Qingkong,

109
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,920
there is also.

110
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,280
It's because I saw you.

111
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,840
Just by standing in front of me,

112
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,760
you've achieved your goal.

113
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,640
You again...

114
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,570
People who make the same mistakes are really stupid.

115
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,800
However, this time,

116
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,660
I not only have audio recordings,

117
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,900
but also video.

118
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,360
Just you wait.

119
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,380
I'm going to report you right now.

120
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:32,920
What are you afraid of?
