1
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,680
There are countless

2
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,520
timelines similar to Earth

3
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,360
existing parallel to Earth in time,

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,680
coexisting simultaneously.

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,480
I am a person with special abilities,

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,080
capable of freely traveling

7
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,520
between different timelines as a time traveler.

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,160
During my last time travel,

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,400
I accidentally lost my energy core.

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,720
Following the residual signal of the energy core,

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,000
I arrived in this timeline.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,880
Here,

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,320
My name is Qing Kong.

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,440
What's wrong?

15
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,960
quite gentlemanly.

16
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,800
You're not helping me up?

17
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,440
I'm Yi Xinran.

18
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,840
Top student in the Music Department of Jiangnan University.

19
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,539
Bai Qianyu.

20
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:38,120
A textbook narcissistic personality.

21
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,080
Listening to her talk,

22
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,410
even plain water turns into aged vinegar.

23
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,080
See you in the classroom.

24
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,960
The Angelina of the sports field.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,680
This is Guan Ling.

26
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,920
Roommate and best friend.

27
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,440
The legendary cute pet.

28
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,280
This is Quan Ge.

29
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,320
Our respected department head.

30
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,050
Everyone, keep an eye on your own exam papers.

31
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,300
Teacher, I'm turning in my paper.

32
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,320
This is a red envelope from the teacher as a reward.

33
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,160
This is

34
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,100
the stacking of memories after time travel.

35
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,480
Who changed the past?

36
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,640
Hurry up.

37
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,420
I'm going to be late. Okay.

38
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,880
What is this feeling?

39
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,370
What's happening to me?

40
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,040
Why did it light up again?

41
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,620
Sure enough, I've time-traveled again.

42
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,840
What does it mean exactly?

43
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,040
Luckily, I'm not late. I made it.

44
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,000
Fortunately, I've already finished the test paper.

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,460
Now Quan Ge can't scold me.

46
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,720
Come earlier next time.

47
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,320
Don't always cut it so close.

48
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,600
Don't run off after school.

49
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,730
I need to talk to you.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,600
Yi Xinran,

51
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,440
what's going on with you?

52
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,960
You think you did well on this exam.

53
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,220
and now you can be proud of yourself, huh?

54
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,640
Don't think

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,120
that just because I didn't catch you

56
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,000
stealing the test papers this time,

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,920
I can't do anything about it.

58
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,180
Teacher, I didn't steal any test papers.

59
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,760
Are you looking down on our school's security guards,

60
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,160
or are you underestimating me as a teacher?

61
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,159
No, no,

62
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,120
really, I didn't.

63
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,920
Yi Xinran,

64
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,330
a perfect score,

65
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,780
and for the last question,

66
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,540
you even provided two different solutions.

67
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
Yi Xinran,

68
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,080
since you're so smart

69
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,610
and such a good student,

70
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,140
I, as your teacher,

71
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,620
have decided to give Yi Xinran

72
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,450
some special tutoring.

73
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,120
Oh no, she's in trouble now.

74
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,120
Come and do this arrangement.

75
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,520
Three days.

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,460
Give it to me in three days.

77
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,520
Three days.

78
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,040
I give up.

79
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,320
Brother Quan's special training for you is way too intense.

80
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,240
It's really life-consuming.

81
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,040
Yi Xinran, you've lost your mind.

82
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,080
What a unique musical style.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,480
Are you sure you're not getting back at Brother Quan?

84
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,280
I think it's quite interesting.

85
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,040
I don't think so.

86
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,840
It's her.

87
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,160
It's him again.

88
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,840
Why is he looking at me like that?

89
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,600
There's something familiar about her.

90
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,080
Is my hair messy?

91
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,210
Could this feeling be the energy core?

92
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,360
Guan Ling.

93
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,360
How is it?

94
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,960
The suona is awesome, right?

95
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,020
It's definitely awesome.

96
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,960
Quan Ge scolded me for half an hour.

97
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,420
He was scolding me while drinking black tea.

98
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,520
A real drama queen.

99
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,680
It's all over after the rain.

100
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,080
After the rain comes fair weather.

101
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,280
How is that possible?

102
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,960
I won't be able to sleep again tonight.

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,120
If only it could be like in web dramas,

104
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,050
where we could travel back in time.

105
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,480
Yeah,

106
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,610
if we could go back in time, everything would be fine.

107
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,320
How do we activate this thing?

108
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,960
Do we need to use a spell?

109
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,800
Prajnaparamita.

110
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,480
Bala bala energy.

111
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,040
Exploding Star.

112
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,840
Open sesame.

113
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,090
Dynamic light wave.

114
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,640
How do we use this thing anyway?

115
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,040
Water.

116
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,770
We don't have to get completely wet, do we?

117
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,610
Dog Brother.

118
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,380
I will travel back in time and defeat you.

119
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,400
How on earth can I get back?

120
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,420
Why do I have to meet him at such an unlucky moment again?

121
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,860
I'm soaked to the bone.

122
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,970
how clumsy of me.

123
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,120
It's not so bad to fall into water occasionally.
