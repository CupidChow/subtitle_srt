1
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,960
Qingkong, what are you spacing out for?

2
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,200
she seems to be silly every time.

3
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,400
who cares if she's silly or not?

4
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,760
hurry up and get the energy core back.

5
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,000
we need to interact with her more to be sure.

6
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,080
Xinran.

7
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,690
Where have you been?

8
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,520
Why are you soaking wet like a drowned rat?

9
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,200
It's too hot outside.

10
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,460
I went to take a shower.

11
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,800
You took a shower with your clothes on?

12
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,260
Who are you trying to fool?

13
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,680
No, no, I didn't.

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,140
How did you end up like this, baby?

15
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,960
Tell us the truth.

16
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,020
Whose is it really?

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You're talking about Qingkong.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,560
He's known as the famous ice prince.

19
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,479
He must like you if he gave you his coat.

20
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,240
So his name is Qingkong.

21
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,720
Come on, come on.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,960
Let me help you make a plan.

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,640
I don't need it at all.

24
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,720
Tell us your plan.

25
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,640
Step one, return the clothes.

26
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,800
What's next after returning them?

27
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,120
Then of course, you need to get his WeChat.

28
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,360
And after getting his WeChat?

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,440
After that, of course, communicate more.

30
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,039
Get to know his preferences.

31
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:53,640
Oh, right.

32
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,479
Remember to post more beautiful photos of yourself on WeChat Moments.

33
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,759
Show off your charm.

34
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,160
The ultimate goal is...

35
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,880
A date.

36
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,960
No, no.

37
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,000
That's too fast.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,040
You should tidy up your WeChat Moments first.

39
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,640
Oh, right.

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,440
I need to supplement my vitamins recently.

41
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,120
I wonder what fruit would be good to eat.

42
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,600
Being too charming can also be a burden.

43
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,570
For example,

44
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,480
I

45
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,360
five

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,680
Who is it?

47
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,640
I'll do it for that

48
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,880
That's Li Wei and Zhang Xu.

49
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,210
The fruit that Zhao Jie gave to Bai Xianyu.

50
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,960
I can't post carelessly on social media either.

51
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,720
So many people are sending me fruit.

52
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,200
It's my treat today. Help yourselves.

53
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,600
Take the opportunity when returning clothes

54
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,200
to invite him to summer camp,

55
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,460
creating chances for sweet encounters.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,200
Blue sky.

57
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,570
Thank you for your coat.

58
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,740
without your coat yesterday,

59
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,040
I caught a cold.

60
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,770
You're welcome.

61
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,660
Hey, wait a moment.

62
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,079
To show my gratitude,

63
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,280
are you interested in participating in this?

64
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,680
What's this supposed to be?

65
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,520
Do you agree or not?

66
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,880
Why did this light up?

67
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,000
Could the energy core really be inside her?

68
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,560
Where am I?

69
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,600
Have I been annihilated?

70
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,120
Student,

71
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,280
are you feeling unwell?

72
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,120
No.

73
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,660
I think you're feeling too comfortable.

74
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,240
Get out.

75
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,780
Go outside and freshen up.

76
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,810
Let's continue with the class.

77
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,840
Has Quan gone crazy today?

78
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,400
I thought leaving high school

79
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,440
would free me from the nightmare of the disciplinary teacher.

80
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,040
How come he's still following us like a shadow?

81
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,600
Your idol

82
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,760
openly fell asleep in his class.

83
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,640
when Quan shouted,

84
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,520
my eardrums nearly burst.

85
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,640
What taste.

86
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,600
Quan's class is interesting.

87
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,530
Who would sleep?

88
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,720
From heartthrob to gatekeeper.

89
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,200
And there's still a fangirl defending him.

90
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,020
I won't argue with you.

91
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,240
Guan Ling.

92
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,960
Lingling, what's wrong?

93
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,260
She's wound up.

94
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
Nothing at all.

95
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,480
Don't make a fuss over nothing.

96
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,600
Quick, smell it in the air,

97
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,320
the sour stench of love.

98
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,520
Lingling, you're in love!

99
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,000
Don't listen to her nonsense.

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,930
It hasn't gotten to that point yet.

101
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,920
It's just that guy who invited me

102
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,200
to the summer camp.

103
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,080
What about you?

104
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,940
How's it going?

105
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,080
I... I don't know if it's going well or not.

106
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,880
Why don't you just ask on WeChat?

107
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,640
WeChat?

108
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,840
I forgot to ask for it.

109
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,680
Given to you by your crush.

110
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,090
I suddenly want to eat some snacks.

111
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,210
Here you go. Go ahead and eat until you're fat.

112
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,480
Just ran into your crush.

113
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,120
The love note he gave you.

114
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,040
Hand it over.

115
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,040
Meet at the basketball court at 3 PM.

116
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,000
How should I ask for their WeChat?

117
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,840
What's wrong?

118
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,450
Let's add each other on WeChat.

119
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,200
What is that faint light?

120
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,370
I don't have WeChat.

121
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,000
Then how do you keep in touch with your friends?

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,400
I don't have any friends.

123
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,760
What about your parents?

124
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,600
What about your relatives?

125
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,260
Do you keep in touch with them?

126
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,200
My parents are not in this world.

127
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,220
Let me help you download WeChat then.

128
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,370
Could it be the energy core?

129
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,640
It's done now.

130
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,370
I've also added you as a friend.

131
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,400
From now on, we're friends.

132
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,760
So, as your friend, I'd like to ask you something.

133
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,880
About the firefly camp next weekend,

134
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,240
would you like to come?
