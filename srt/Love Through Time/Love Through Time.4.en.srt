1
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,520
Why hasn't Guan Ling come back yet?

2
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,320
Come downstairs for a moment.

3
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,480
I'll wait for you downstairs.

4
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,610
I need to talk to you.

5
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,530
You want me to come down?

6
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,040
Do you want to see me?

7
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,360
I'll be right there.

8
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,640
No, no.

9
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,200
Yi Xinran,

10
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,200
you have a mission.

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,280
Not today.

12
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,680
I have something to do. I'll explain later.

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,840
Are you out of your mind?

14
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,039
Wearing a scarf in the middle of summer.

15
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,080
How is it?

16
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,000
Looks good, right?

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,720
Fang Lin knitted it himself.

18
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,039
Fang Lin.

19
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,280
The video situation has been cleared up too.

20
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,920
Both of those girls like him.

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,160
they've both confessed their feelings.

22
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,240
But Fang Lin rejected them both.

23
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,520
They each thought the other was Fang Lin's girlfriend.

24
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,450
That's why they started fighting.

25
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,920
Actually, it's me.

26
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,960
Guan Ling, can you please come to your senses?

27
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,890
You've been fooled by just a scarf.

28
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,680
He didn't fool me at all.

29
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,240
Also, Fang Lin said he forgives you.

30
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,840
He knows you mean well for me.

31
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,800
See how magnanimous he is?

32
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,520
You said such harsh things about him,

33
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,080
and he doesn't even hold it against you.

34
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,720
You've made up so quickly.

35
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,960
That's quite efficient indeed.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,660
Fang Lin gave it to you, right?

37
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,080
It's the height of summer now.

38
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,410
Aren't you feeling hot?

39
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,800
There are quite a few loose threads.

40
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,240
I guess they must have

41
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,970
bought too many in bulk at once.

42
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,800
What do you mean by bulk?

43
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,170
This was hand-knitted by Fang Lin.

44
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,960
He just finished knitting it since he met me.

45
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:31,280
Oh, so that's the story he's going with.

46
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,560
Guan Ling,

47
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,960
since we're roommates,

48
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,579
let me tell you something.

49
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,640
You know what?

50
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,760
You're the sixth person

51
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,040
in our school to receive this scarf.

52
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,100
Don't doubt me.

53
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,400
You can go online and check for yourself.

54
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,480
See if this scarf

55
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,360
was really knitted by Fang Lin.

56
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,480
Guan Ling.

57
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,720
He deceived me again.

58
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,400
This kind of emotional manipulation trick

59
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,530
only fools emotional idiots like you.

60
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,580
Bai Qianyu, keep your mouth shut.

61
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,200
Qingkong, are you downstairs?

62
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,000
Guan Ling just ran down.

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,330
Quick, help me stop her.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,760
I told you to watch her.

65
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,160
How did you knock her out?

66
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,600
I didn't hit her.

67
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,000
She knocked herself out.

68
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,820
Xinran, I have something to tell you.

69
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,520
Keep an eye on that person for me.

70
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,250
I'll take Guan Ling back first.

71
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,079
Don't get caught.

72
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,140
I'll be right back.

73
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,680
No, wait! We haven't finished yet.

74
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,810
You absolutely can't travel back now.

75
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,880
Why haven't I traveled back?

76
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,640
Qingkong.

77
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,800
You forcibly prevented yourself from traveling before.

78
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,320
You've violated the rules.

79
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,640
The system is now locked.

80
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,899
Physical contact doesn't work anymore.

81
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,640
You must kiss the energy core owner

82
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,120
for more than three seconds

83
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,720
to unlock the time travel function.

84
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,520
Qingkong.

85
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,130
Why did you change your outfit?

86
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,680
To cover up.

87
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,840
Cover.

88
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,970
He's not going to kiss me, is he?

89
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,400
Fang Lin is over there.

90
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,530
Hurry up and follow.

91
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,280
Why does unlocking require a kiss?

92
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,490
We've been discovered.

93
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,040
Now's the chance, kiss him.

94
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,520
He's not really going to kiss me, is he?

95
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,810
Quickly, follow me.

96
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,620
Welcome to Sakura Smart Lock.

97
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,040
Facial recognition passed.

98
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,320
Someone has entered.

99
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,520
I suddenly have an idea.

100
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,320
You need to help me.

101
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,920
What for?

102
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,920
A living human undercover.

103
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,180
Real-time monitoring via mobile phone.

104
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,120
Stop talking.

105
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,200
I'll call the roll first.

106
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,360
Wang Yunyun.

107
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,200
Here.

108
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,600
Fang Lin.

109
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,240
Here.

110
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,160
Jia Yan.

111
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,080
Jia Yan.

112
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,840
What's going on?

113
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,970
Is there no one named Jia Yan among you?

114
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,420
Qingkong, you are now called Jia Yan.

115
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,360
Are you calling me?

116
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,800
You are Jia Yan.

117
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,440
I am Jia Yan.

118
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,520
Didn't you hear me calling you earlier?

119
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,560
Didn't I already answer you?

120
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,730
You're so handsome.

121
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,080
You must have a lot of girls who like you.

122
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,480
Coming here for classes,

123
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,240
it seems your intelligence is the issue.

124
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,200
But don't worry,

125
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,980
I guarantee you'll see changes in a week.

126
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,120
Brother, you've made the right choice coming here for classes.

127
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,520
I've been taking classes here for two months now.

128
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,980
let me tell you something,

129
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,320
those girls

130
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,040
are head over heels for me.

131
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,640
Two months of classes.

132
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,800
Bai Qianyu was right.

133
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,800
That scumbag really did come to take the emotional manipulation class.

134
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,000
This must be Jia Yan.

135
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,560
We absolutely can't let him in.

136
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,690
Otherwise, Qingkong will be exposed.

137
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,360
Welcome to Sakura Smart Lock.

138
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,520
Fingerprint verification passed.

139
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,800
Jia Yan.

140
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,880
You know me?

141
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,040
Of course I do.

142
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,800
Aren't you taking classes here?

143
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,480
So am I.

144
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,080
It's my first time here.

145
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,480
How do you know me?

146
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,480
The time has been changed today.

147
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,120
I'm in charge of registration.

148
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,960
Everyone has left.

149
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,840
you're the only one left.

150
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,440
Aren't you Jia Yan?

151
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,200
So that's what happened.

152
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,080
I didn't even know.

153
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,680
I came here for nothing.

154
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,120
Yeah, we just got notified.

155
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,600
It's getting late.

156
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,130
you should head back first.

157
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,360
Okay.

158
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,680
Well, I'll head back then.

159
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,880
Thank you, senior.

160
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,480
You're welcome. Hurry back.

161
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,039
Bye-bye.

162
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,799
Bye-bye.

163
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,520
That was close. We almost got exposed.
