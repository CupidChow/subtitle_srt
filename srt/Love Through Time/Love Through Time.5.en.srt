1
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:19,840
Let's head back quickly.

2
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,920
Bye-bye.

3
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,800
That was close. We almost got caught.

4
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,080
Hey, senior.

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,800
Why did you come back?

6
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,200
I...

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,560
I wanted to add you on WeChat.

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,820
My phone is out of battery.

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,520
How about we talk about it tomorrow?

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,850
We'll be in class tomorrow anyway, right?

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,440
Alright then.

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,960
So, see you tomorrow.

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,040
Mm-hmm.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,120
Well, bye-bye.

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,840
Bye-bye.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,560
Get some rest when you get back.

17
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,560
Bye-bye, senior.

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,180
Come and collect your phones.

19
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,650
We have to hand in our phones again?

20
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,360
What are you all doing here?

21
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,600
We're having a class.

22
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,800
A class? What kind of class?

23
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,520
Teaching people how to date.

24
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,200
How to make someone

25
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,120
fall head over heels for you in a short time.

26
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,760
Fang Lin, you damn scumbag!

27
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,199
What's wrong?

28
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,020
He's experimenting on my friend.

29
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,440
I need your help.

30
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,000
Okay.

31
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,720
This kind of emotional manipulation course

32
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,360
needs to be completely eradicated.

33
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,560
We still need to kiss.

34
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,800
Wait until this time tomorrow,

35
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,440
then come back here.

36
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,240
We'll meet up.

37
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,960
Alright.

38
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,120
That's so strange.

39
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,460
Why does he agree to everything I say?

40
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,900
It hurts so bad.

41
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,860
Alright, let's get going.

42
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,680
Oh, come on.

43
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,800
When you wear clothes like this,

44
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,130
you look more like someone who would take that kind of class.

45
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,360
Here.

46
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,120
What's this?

47
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,520
This is a voice recorder.

48
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,280
After you hand in your phone,

49
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,740
you can use this to record.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,360
I don't know how to use it.

51
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,420
You don't know how?

52
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,610
Then I'll teach you.

53
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,420
Finally, just press this button.

54
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,080
Here.

55
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,240
Go on then.

56
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,480
Oh no.

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,329
Jia Yan is coming today.

58
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,570
Wang Yunyun.

59
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,600
Jia Yan.

60
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,680
Here.

61
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,690
You're also called Jia Yan?

62
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
Which one of you is actually Jia Yan?

63
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,079
I am Jia Yan.

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,930
I am also Jia Yan.

65
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,040
Now this is interesting.

66
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,160
Teacher, he's not Jia Yan.

67
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,480
He is the real one.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
No, I am.

69
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,600
Irrelevant personnel, please leave.

70
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,360
You, get out.

71
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,800
I'll leave.

72
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,000
No, no.

73
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,600
No, I really am Jia Yan.

74
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,080
You, get going.

75
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,120
I really am.

76
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,360
I really am.

77
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,440
You, get out.

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,640
Hi.

79
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,320
Hello.

80
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,159
I need to call the police.

81
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,440
I've encountered a pig-butchering scam.

82
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,840
I've been scammed out of tens of thousands.

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,600
I was just following Jia Yan.

85
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,680
Playing games within games with me.

86
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,210
You really think I'm a fool?

87
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,960
How come you weren't taken away?

88
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,060
Because I gave the voice recorder to the police.

89
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,680
Impressive.

90
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,580
You think everyone is like me?

91
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,640
I'm the only one willing to help you.

92
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,159
Pig brain.

93
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,880
You... you're putting theory into practice.

94
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,720
You're manipulating my emotions.

95
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,380
No, I'm not.

96
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,280
Yes, you are.

97
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,010
You're the one with a pig brain.

98
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,890
So this is what kissing feels like.

99
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,040
Qingkong took the initiative to kiss me.

100
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,760
This guy must like me.

101
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,200
But this time travel...

102
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,060
why does it always come at such inconvenient times?

103
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,720
Have you seen Fang Lin recently?

104
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,320
Why are you still mentioning that scumbag?

105
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,840
There was a girl before

106
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,240
who was deceived for her money and body by him,

107
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,920
and eventually manipulated into committing suicide by jumping off a building.

108
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,760
I was blind before.

109
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,640
Someone committed suicide.

110
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,280
Have you lost your memory,

111
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,610
or are you just trying to reopen my wounds?

112
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,040
No, no,

113
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,460
you just go on with your love affair with your 2D character.

114
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,400
Why did someone die?

115
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,360
What's this about someone jumping to their death?

116
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,980
Is it because of changing the past through time travel?

117
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,640
Congratulations, Qingkong. You've unlocked the time travel function again.

118
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,560
How did the kiss feel?

119
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,200
Oh, right.

120
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,370
I have some bad news.

121
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,960
Because you traveled through time and changed the past,

122
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,690
it created a butterfly effect.

123
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,760
As punishment,

124
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,200
you need to retrieve the energy core before returning.

125
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,120
If you fail,

126
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,020
you'll still be annihilated.

127
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,600
How exactly do we retrieve the energy core?

128
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,919
Remember the camping trip tomorrow.
