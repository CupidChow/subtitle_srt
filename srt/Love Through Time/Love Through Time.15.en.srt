1
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,840
Actually,

2
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,060
I've been feeling really awful these past few days.

3
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,520
I was afraid of hurting you again.

4
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,520
Actually,

5
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,600
we can be a couple

6
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,000
who can't touch each other.

7
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,760
That's not it either.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
No, we can't.

9
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:02,960
Yi Xinran,

10
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,280
I like you.

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,740
Will you be my girlfriend?

12
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,200
Are you proposing to me?

13
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,720
Yi Xinran.

14
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,720
I like you.

15
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,180
Will you be my girlfriend?

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,000
Is that so direct?

17
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,120
Well,

18
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,920
do you agree?

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,960
Not really.

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,200
I don't agree.

21
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,720
I got her back.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,729
I feel Guan Ling is more reliable than searching.

23
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,960
I can't believe I'm dating a boyfriend from another dimension.

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,600
By the way,

25
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,080
you're a superpowered person.

26
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,940
Tell me the next lottery numbers.

27
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,560
Using superpowers is taboo.

28
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,080
So do you have a lot of money?

29
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,840
TV dramas are indeed all lies.

30
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,680
My interdimensional boyfriend

31
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,120
can't use his superpowers,

32
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,450
and can't even touch me.

33
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,690
Then, Qingkong,

34
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,000
can you fly?

35
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,560
Well.

36
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,160
Which planet are you from?

37
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,570
What does your true form look like?

38
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,960
Do you need to eat too?

39
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,680
Do you have wings?

40
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,200
How did you get here?

41
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,329
Did you ride in a UFO?

42
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,400
What else, what else?

43
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,000
Have you ever time-traveled to ancient times?

44
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,840
Hey, classmate,

45
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,600
how's it going today?

46
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,480
Xinran,

47
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,040
you can be a social butterfly if you want,

48
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,920
but please don't make me die of embarrassment, okay?

49
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,920
What are you afraid of?

50
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,720
We're about to graduate anyway.

51
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,000
Beautiful.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,800
Are you dating?

53
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,329
Who is it?

54
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,730
I don't know either.

55
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,480
Don't you know me, Yi Xinran?

56
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,920
Classmate,

57
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,200
you have a boyfriend now,

58
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,840
you've completely let yourself go, haven't you?

59
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,840
your true nature is showing.

60
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,240
Not worried about being unwanted anymore?

61
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,360
You know what?

62
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,240
I'm the one who was confessed to.

63
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,120
The one who was confessed to?

64
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,200
Quan Ge,

65
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,800
Teacher Zhang,

66
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,160
Guan Ling,

67
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,160
I'm just kidding.

68
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,520
Let's have dinner together tonight.

69
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,120
then watch a movie together.

70
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,120
Okay.

71
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,920
It seems to be the same as the online search results.

72
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,720
Things to do when in a relationship.

73
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,520
It's just eating, shopping, and watching movies.

74
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,570
You were absolutely right.

75
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,690
He just replied with an 'okay.'

76
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,160
What else? Should he have said no to you?

77
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,680
I just wanted to see

78
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,279
what kind of suggestions he could come up with.

79
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,810
And all we got was an 'okay.'

80
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,040
Oh, Qingkong,

81
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,500
he's definitely never had a girlfriend.

82
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,810
That's for sure.

83
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,480
He's a time traveler.

84
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,880
That makes sense.

85
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,380
So, you little energized light bulb,

86
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,000
want to have dinner together tonight?

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,320
Bah!

88
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,280
No way!

89
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,800
Yi Xinran, learn something good for once.

90
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,960
Do you have to make and eat dog food right away?

91
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,040
Be careful, Dog Brother might

92
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,370
give you a special lesson this afternoon.

93
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,540
You're just jealous and envious.

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,160
Where are you? Do you know you're late?

95
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,930
You're the one who arrived ten minutes early.

96
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,570
Arriving later than me means you're late.

97
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,040
I'll be there in two minutes.

98
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,880
Yi Xinran.

99
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,360
You look so beautiful today.

100
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,290
It's so different from how you look at school.

101
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,160
Thank you.

102
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,080
Oh, by the way,

103
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,040
I've made plans with my high school classmates today.

104
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,040
we're having dinner here together.

105
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,740
How about it? Are you free?

106
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,200
Would you like to join us for dinner?

107
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,600
My treat.

108
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,370
Qingkong, you're here.

109
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,240
Please, carry on.

110
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,720
Well, Yi Xinran,

111
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,080
I won't disturb you and your boyfriend.

112
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
I'll be going now.

113
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,120
Oh, right,

114
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,130
about what I just mentioned to you,

115
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,080
please give it some thought.

116
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:09,960
Mm-hmm.

117
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,640
Have a seat.

118
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,080
What are you thinking about?

119
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,320
Shouldn't you ask me what I want to eat first?

120
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,240
Are you hungry?

121
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,770
What's with this interrogating tone?

122
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,800
I'm sorry, then.

123
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,260
What would you like to eat?

124
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,210
What's with your attitude?

125
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,980
What attitude could I possibly have?

126
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,610
Tell me, what attitude do you have?

127
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:50,760
I...

128
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,280
Just eat by yourself.

129
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,280
You're back so early.

130
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,600
Finished eating and left.

131
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,860
Don't even mention it. I'm full of anger.

132
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,560
I waited for him for ages.

133
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,320
And all I got was a sour face.

134
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,660
Come on, I'll take you out for some good food.

135
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,600
And we can catch up on some gossip while we're at it.

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,680
I knew you were the best.

137
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,680
Come here and give me a kiss.
