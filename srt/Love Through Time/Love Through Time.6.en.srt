1
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,680
Hurry up.

2
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,800
How can I restore my energy core?

3
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,610
I almost didn't make it.

4
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,520
I brought you that...

5
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,980
that meat you love so much.

6
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,680
We've already kissed.

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,000
Is this reaction shyness?

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,600
I must figure out a way.

9
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,560
During this time we're alone together,

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,600
I must find

11
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,640
a way to get back my energy core.

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,360
He keeps looking at me.

13
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,000
Looks like he's just shy.

14
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,440
One, two, three.

15
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,840
Let's go.

16
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:25,240
Shall we go play over there?

17
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,200
Okay.

18
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,120
Slow down, slow down.

19
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,240
Her face is so red.

20
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,370
Is it the effect of the energy core?

21
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,240
She's wearing long sleeves.

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,840
How can I see?

23
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,720
Why is he always so...

24
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,760
staring at her like that?

25
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,720
You...

26
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,240
Are you hot?

27
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,170
Do you want to take off your jacket?

28
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,880
It's fine. There are a lot of mosquitoes outdoors.

29
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,920
He's concerned about me.

30
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
Do you want to get up and walk around?

31
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,920
What is this feeling?

32
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,690
Time is running out.

33
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,930
we need to think of a solution quickly.

34
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,440
Yi Xinran.

35
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,280
Close your eyes.

36
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,340
Hold out your hand.

37
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,560
Is he going to give me a gift?

38
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,610
Why are the sleeves of her coat so long?

39
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,600
What is he doing?

40
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,960
Is he putting a bracelet on me?

41
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,600
This is for you.

42
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,360
How romantic.

43
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,920
I have a gift for you too.

44
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,440
Let's be together.

45
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,280
Aren't we already together?

46
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,360
I...

47
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,400
I mean...

48
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,880
I like you.

49
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,640
Let's date.

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,840
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,440
I never thought about dating you.

52
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,880
let alone liking you.

53
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,120
You kissed me.

54
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,560
And agreed to go on a date with me.

55
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,560
And just now, you gave me fireflies.

56
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,480
Aren't these signs of liking someone?

57
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,080
Do you think these things mean liking someone?

58
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,490
If this doesn't count as liking...

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,680
I don't think these things mean liking someone.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,800
Okay.

61
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,130
I was just being presumptuous.

62
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,560
Qing Kong.

63
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,200
How could you hurt a girl's feelings like that?

64
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,880
what should we do now?

65
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,640
go after her!

66
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,560
if you don't retrieve the energy core soon,

67
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,440
you'll become weaker and weaker.

68
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,000
You'll soon fade away.

69
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,680
Why does my heart hurt a little?

70
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,320
Let's go.

71
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,320
Don't go, teacher!

72
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,760
Everyone, please quiet down.

73
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,960
Let me say a few words.

74
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,240
Our school's annual music festival

75
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,440
is about to begin.

76
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,530
The Golden Score Award for our music department,

77
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,540
who will win it?

78
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
We don't know yet.

79
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,520
For the sake of fairness,

80
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,400
students from both classes

81
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,600
will be randomly paired up.

82
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,200
You can choose freely, okay?

83
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,080
Teacher,

84
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,480
I want to be in a group with Yi Xinran.

85
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,520
What do you mean?

86
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,400
You're trying to play me again, aren't you?

87
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,530
Teacher, I won't be in a group with him.

88
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,970
Teacher, can I be in a group with Qingkong?

89
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,360
Teacher,

90
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,680
can I still be in his group?

91
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,740
Alright, alright.

92
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,280
Let's start the class first.

93
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,080
Um,

94
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,200
you can discuss it among yourselves after class.

95
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,040
Then report to the class monitor when you're done.

96
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,840
Class begins.

97
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,650
Yi Xinran, you're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,260
None of your business.

99
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,920
Xinran, what's going on with you guys?

100
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,380
I'm completely confused.

101
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,210
Go away, get out of here.

102
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
See you later at the music practice room.

103
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,520
Mm-hmm.

104
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,040
Here's the sheet music I've written.

105
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,000
Take a look at it.

106
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,260
then just memorize it.

107
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,320
No need. I don't accept handouts.

108
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,520
I can write it myself.

109
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,120
Qingkong.

110
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,159
Your energy is starting to decrease.

111
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:38,600
Only 70% of energy remaining.

112
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,520
Xinran.

113
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,920
You're here.

114
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,960
Did you just hear it?

115
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,640
What do you think of our new song?

116
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,140
Could you give me some advice?

117
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,880
Actually, I feel there are still some minor flaws.

118
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,240
I just can't find the right feel.

119
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,320
You guys.

120
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,160
Didn't Qingkong tell you?

121
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,000
Come to think of it,

122
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,080
I should thank you for us being able to form a team.
