1
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,440
I'd like to see what you can come up with.

2
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,680
Isn't this Bai Qianyu's good partner?

3
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,540
Why didn't you go find Bai Qianyu?

4
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,730
Who's partnering with her?

5
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,680
You sure have some nerve.

6
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,140
Everyone can get their hopes up for you, huh?

7
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,080
So, are you angry now?

8
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,010
What do I have to be angry about?

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,400
I just think you're a terrible person.

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,060
I saw everything between you and Bai Qianyu.

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,960
What exactly did you see?

12
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,960
Did I misunderstand him?

13
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,600
No, I need to go and clarify this.

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,200
Scumbag.

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,760
We're all classmates.

16
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,480
Isn't it normal to be in the same classroom?

17
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,240
Normal.

18
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,090
You're telling me it's normal?

19
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,490
It's normal for a man and woman to be alone in a room together?

20
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,560
But aren't we alone together right now?

21
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,800
in the same room?

22
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,600
Right, everything you say is correct.

23
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,080
In your eyes, we're all the same.

24
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,960
You...

25
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,920
Scumbag.

26
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,760
What's a scumbag?

27
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,360
A scumbag is someone like you, both stupid and foolish,

28
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,760
utterly clueless, like a block of wood.

29
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Utterly clueless, like a block of wood.

30
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,840
You idiot, you're driving me crazy!

31
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,280
The remaining energy has dropped to fifty percent.

32
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,480
I don't want to vanish along with you.

33
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,240
If you don't retrieve the energy core soon,

34
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,440
our journey will come to an end.

35
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,840
Okay.

36
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,980
I was getting ahead of myself.

37
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,640
Scumbag.

38
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,680
I seem to always make her angry.

39
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,360
How exactly can we retrieve the energy core?

40
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,720
That Qingkong guy

41
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,040
actually gave the song to Bai Xianyu.

42
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,040
And that narcissist Bai Xianyu

43
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,240
even came to brag about it to me.

44
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,460
That jerk Qingkong still won't admit it.

45
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,620
How can he be such a good actor?

46
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,040
Qingkong wouldn't do that, would he?

47
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
He's so aloof.

48
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,920
If he did something, he would admit it.

49
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,520
There's no need to lie to you.

50
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,079
I saw it with my own eyes.

51
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,200
The two of them

52
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,800
were alone in the classroom.

53
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,000
Bai Xianyu played the sheet music he wrote.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,200
What about your group assignment then?

55
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,079
What can I do?

56
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,240
I'll just do it myself.

57
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,160
By yourself?

58
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,960
What else can I do?

59
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,440
Now the only emotion left is happiness.

60
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,090
How can I make her happy?

61
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,120
First,

62
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,940
comfort her emotions.

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,860
Never argue about right or wrong.

64
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,160
Second, take action to solve the problem.

65
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,040
through actions, eliminate

66
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,500
the reasons for her anger.

67
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,400
Third,

68
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,160
give her a gift.

69
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,240
Create a surprise for her.

70
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,800
The sheet music I gave to Yi Xinran,

71
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,640
how did it end up in Bai Qianyu's hands?

72
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,240
What's really going on here?

73
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,180
So that's how it is.

74
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,960
I need to think of a solution.

75
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,440
Next, please welcome

76
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,900
Bai Qianyu to the stage to receive the award.

77
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,240
I originally thought she was just sharp-tongued.

78
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,159
I didn't expect her to be so mean-spirited.

79
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:00,080
Qingkong is the one who's despicable.

80
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,680
He provided the main melody.

81
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,880
A pair of scumbags.

82
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,320
They're not a couple at all.

83
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,560
This is what talent tastes like.

84
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,440
So,

85
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,540
isn't this Yi Xinran's good partner?

86
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,200
How did you end up here?

87
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,260
Take a look at this.

88
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,300
Give me some feedback.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,840
The chord progression and main melody of this score,

90
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,240
as well as the climax at the end,

91
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,500
were all written by me.

92
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,380
How did this score end up with you?

93
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,840
But being able to use your chords

94
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,680
and main melody so well,

95
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,159
doesn't it just prove

96
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,000
that I'm the talented one?

97
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,520
How about it? Team up with me.

98
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,740
But I never gave you the score.

99
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,560
Even kids know

100
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,680
to keep their things safe.

101
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,760
You were out of it at the time,

102
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,800
and didn't put the score away properly.

103
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,560
So,

104
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
you're blaming me?

105
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,480
This is theft.

106
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
It's plagiarism.

107
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,680
Don't put it so harshly.

108
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,480
This isn't stealing,

109
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,100
it's referencing.

110
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,880
Look, I still wrote part of it.

111
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,000
Without you,

112
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,340
the Golden Score Award is still mine.

113
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,120
Isn't she just a thief doing this?

114
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,380
That's right, a thief.

115
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,360
Thief, thief!

116
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,560
Thief, thief, thief!

117
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,480
So Qingkong turns out to be a scheming boy after all.

118
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,240
This time, Bai Qianyu is really socially dead.

119
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,960
Thief, thief!

120
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,200
She brought this upon herself.

121
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,120
Thief!

122
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:09,280
Thief, thief, thief!

123
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,920
I misjudged him.

124
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,780
That still can't make up for the harm he did to me.

125
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,360
Well done, Qingkong.

126
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,360
Yi Xinran will surely forgive you now.

127
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,960
The next step is to retrieve the energy core as soon as possible.

128
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,760
How to get it?

129
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,320
No, no.

130
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,960
My central processor is almost burnt out.

131
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,520
It has never happened in history

132
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,680
that a time traveler lost their energy core.

133
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,520
So you'll have to figure it out on your own.

134
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,040
Thief, thief, thief!

135
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,120
Thief!

136
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm leaving first.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,400
I won't disturb your date with your crush.

138
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,520
See you at the dorm later.

139
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,580
See you at the dorm.

140
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,890
Are you free for dinner?

141
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,720
I have something to tell you.

142
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,520
Okay.

143
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,440
6 o'clock, Su Bang Yuan Jian.

144
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,970
He must have arrived early, right?

145
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,040
I'm late.

147
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,520
No.

148
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840
We all came early.

149
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,640
I asked you to come here this time

150
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,679
to sincerely apologize to you.

151
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,840
Because of me,

152
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,799
you lost your eligibility to compete.
