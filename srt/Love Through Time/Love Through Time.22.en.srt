1
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,100
I don't feel disgusted at all.

2
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,720
Qingkong

3
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,450
there's also

4
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,960
that's because I saw you.

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,370
Just by standing in front of me,

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,360
you've achieved your goal.

7
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,240
You again.

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,400
People who make the same mistake twice are really stupid.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,200
But this time,

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,330
I not only have an audio recording,

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,570
but also a video.

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:57,960
Just you wait.

13
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm going to report this right now.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,260
What are you afraid of?

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,890
Yi Xinran is the one at a disadvantage now.

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,940
I just wanted to disgust Yi Xinran

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,060
and disgust Qingkong as well.

18
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,680
Do you have anything else to say?

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,520
Teacher,

20
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,010
my senior and I didn't do anything.

21
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,320
The photos

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,640
were secretly taken by Bai Qianyu using camera tricks.

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,320
In the end,

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
she was also the one who spread them.

25
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,000
Alright,

26
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,920
you two can go back first.

27
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,460
As for the outcome,

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,060
wait for the school's notification.

29
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,440
Bai Qianyu.

30
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,360
What can I say about you?

31
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,620
What about school?

32
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,360
This time, we can't keep you here.

33
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,120
Teacher,

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,080
I...

35
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,919
Why?

36
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,960
Everyone likes you.

37
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,640
Yi Xinran.

38
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,000
On what grounds?

39
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,360
Yi Xinran.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,640
You must be very happy now.

41
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,079
Qingkong likes you.

42
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,780
Even Jia Yan has gone from being your enemy to admiring you.

43
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,760
Not everyone is like you.

44
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,440
I don't know why,

45
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,640
but ever since my plan failed that time,

46
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,440
my hatred for you

47
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,320
has only grown stronger.

48
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,920
You still don't understand,

49
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,320
do you? Your own problem?

50
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,420
You always think it's someone else's fault.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,200
The development of things always has its inevitability.

52
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,200
No snowflake is innocent.

53
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,240
Isn't that right?

54
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,079
Hello, dorm supervisor.

55
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,400
Please carry on.

56
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,880
Can you forgive me then?

57
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,520
Why don't you just call 110?

58
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,880
Could it be that after that time travel,

59
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,560
I changed Bai Qianyu's fate?

60
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,160
To fall for the same person twice,

61
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,400
This time it's Qingkong again.

62
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,260
It's him again.

63
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,250
What on earth does he see in you?

64
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,400
Is Qingkong helping me again?

65
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,680
I'm about to leave.

66
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,280
Qingkong should be leaving today.

67
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,200
Yi Xinran.

68
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Stop right there!

69
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,240
Yi Xinran, don't think you can just walk away.

70
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,160
If it weren't for you,

71
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,560
how would I have ended up in this situation?

72
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,680
I won't let you off the hook.

73
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,680
Let go of me!

74
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,840
Yi Xinran!

75
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,240
Die!

76
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,000
Yi Xinran!

77
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,400
Die!

78
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,040
Qingkong.

79
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,080
It's so good to see you.

80
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,920
Qingkong.

81
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,560
You used your special ability.

82
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,120
You'll be punished.

83
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,120
I don't want you to hurt yourself for me.

84
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,540
I just want you to be healthy and well.

85
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,820
It's enough for me just to see you.

86
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,370
Every time we travel through time,

87
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,850
it creates a butterfly effect.

88
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,320
If one of us

89
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,080
has to be punished,

90
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,880
let it be me.

91
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,040
I don't want you to suffer.

92
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,530
Even if it means annihilation,

93
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,000
I don't want you to be annihilated.

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,360
Stop it now.

95
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,440
Yi Xinran.

96
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:04,960
I love you.

97
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,040
Qingkong.

98
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,560
I can't forget him.
