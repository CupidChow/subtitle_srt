1
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,600
Xinran.

2
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,080
Shouldn't you call me senior?

3
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,080
You have no respect for your elders.

4
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,860
I thought about it yesterday.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,730
Let's just practice two songs.

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,760
Practice makes perfect, you know.

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,600
I think so too.

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,480
Oh, right. This is for you.

9
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,360
I saw yesterday that your guitar pick wasn't working well anymore.

10
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,000
So I bought two new ones for you.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,800
I don't know if you'll like them.

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,200
Thank you.

13
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,800
I'm hungry.

14
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:05,360
I'm leaving first.

15
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,720
Come find me after school.

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,920
I'll be waiting for you.

17
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,680
Bye-bye.

18
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,120
Qingkong.

19
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,280
Give it to me.

20
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,240
Give you what?

21
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,840
The pick he gave me.

22
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,460
From now on, you can only use mine.

23
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,280
Okay.

24
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,960
Amazing, well done.

25
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,800
That's great.

26
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,800
Okay.

27
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,360
Ling Ling, what should I do?

28
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,290
What do you mean?

29
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,880
Wasn't the performance quite successful?

30
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,540
The performance was indeed successful,

31
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:48,000
but what about my relationship with Qing Kong?

32
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,960
What do you mean?

33
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,920
I think...

34
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,640
Qing Kong seems to be quite jealous lately.

35
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,520
That's true.

36
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,720
Every time Jia Yan talks to you,

37
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,560
Qing Kong's gaze

38
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,800
could kill.

39
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,600
Right?

40
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,480
Cheers.

41
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,520
Today,

42
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,940
I have a decision to announce.

43
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Our little group

44
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,980
will be disbanded from now on.

45
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,480
Why?

46
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,120
Isn't it obvious?

47
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,880
Because

48
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,500
I have other plans for the future.

49
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,450
If we don't disband now,

50
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,520
some people will become sour grapes.

51
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,240
It seems

52
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,580
we've arrived.

53
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,360
The journey was so short.

54
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,500
We've arrived so quickly.

55
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,360
I'll head back first.

56
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,280
Mm-hmm.

57
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,200
Back at the dorm.

58
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,040
You should go to bed early.

59
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,320
Okay.
