1
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,440
From now on, we're friends.

2
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,800
Then, as your friend, I'd like to ask you something.

3
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,920
The firefly camp next weekend,

4
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,420
would you like to come?

5
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,560
Then it's settled.

6
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,360
We'll go together next weekend.

7
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,960
See you next weekend.

8
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,560
Is it really her?

9
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,080
What's going on?

10
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,200
You seem so happy.

11
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,650
What could possibly be good for me?

12
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,440
I'm afraid I might disturb your private time together.

13
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,720
You're just a shameless scoundrel who forgets friendship when you see a pretty face anyway.

14
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,200
I think you've been cooped up in the dorm for too long.

15
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,530
You've caught something from Bai Xianyu.

16
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,340
That's an incurable disease.

17
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,780
How are things going with your crush?

18
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,320
He's already agreed.

19
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,850
Really? Which one of you confessed first?

20
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,880
I was talking about the summer camp.

21
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,400
He agreed to go.

22
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,280
Oh, by the way, did you know?

23
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,480
I found out later,

24
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,160
he might be an orphan.

25
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,120
An orphan?

26
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,400
An orphan?

27
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,570
They usually crave love, you know.

28
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,760
You're the one who craves love!

29
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,240
If I have physical contact with someone who possesses an energy core,

30
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,720
it will cause a distortion in space-time.

31
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,050
It will cause a distortion in space-time.

32
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,120
Is the energy core really

33
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,880
inside that girl?

34
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,760
Auntie,

35
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,079
Xinran.

36
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,280
What brings you here?

37
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,920
What's wrong?

38
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,660
Lingling hasn't been doing well lately.

39
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,160
The school suggested she take a leave of absence and come home.

40
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,360
to rest for a while.

41
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,920
Leave of absence?

42
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,680
What happened to you?

43
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,480
She won't tell us when we ask.

44
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,840
She just keeps crying.

45
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,240
Guan Ling.

46
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,200
You can tell me anything.

47
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,760
Auntie,

48
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,730
let's go.

49
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,079
What's wrong with Guan Ling?

50
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,640
What else could it be?

51
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,760
She got scammed in a relationship.

52
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,920
A guy, huh?

53
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,640
He's just fooling you guys,

54
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,600
who only start tasting

55
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
the sweetness of love in your senior year.

56
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,160
If you knew, why didn't you say something earlier?

57
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,720
I only heard about it too.

58
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,200
What? Are you two best friends?

59
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,440
You don't even know that?

60
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,600
It's all my fault lately,

61
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,280
I've been so focused on Qingkong.

62
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,320
His name is Fang Lin.

63
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,560
He's in the sports department.

64
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,040
Don't know where he got the skills,

65
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,120
but he's a player.

66
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,780
Yet girls are all head over heels for him.

67
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,000
Four days ago,

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,080
there were two more girls.

69
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,760
They got into a big fight over him on the playground.

70
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,160
I haven't finished speaking yet.

71
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,480
I need to travel back in time.

72
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,160
To expose Fang Lin's true colors.

73
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,560
How can I make it light up?

74
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,040
The water isn't right.

75
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,880
Could it be mineral water?

76
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,339
Take me back four days ago.

77
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,420
Take me back four days ago.

78
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,880
It's still not right.

79
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,560
How can I make it light up?

80
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,080
Ah, it's lit up.

81
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,040
Qingkong, Qingkong.

82
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,720
I've detected the energy core.

83
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,680
It's within a 50-meter radius.

84
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,810
You need to seize the opportunity.

85
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,280
Who is it?

86
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,920
Is it her?

87
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,840
It's right here.

88
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,720
Guan Ling, wait for me.

89
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,450
It really is her.

90
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,940
We've gone back four days.

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,720
There's still time.

92
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,400
Qingkong has a competition. Hurry up, hurry up.

93
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,440
Stop dawdling.

94
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,640
Guan Ling, this time let me protect you 99888.

95
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,000
Guan Ling, this time let me protect you.

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,200
Guan Ling, this time let me protect you.

97
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,920
That's her.

98
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,120
No.

99
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,960
I can't let her go back and make any changes.

100
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,570
The primary task is to find Yi Xinran as soon as possible.

101
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,920
I have an urgent matter.

102
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,000
Let's talk next time.

103
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,680
I must take you back.

104
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,960
I'm warning you.

105
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,320
Break up with Fang Lin immediately.

106
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,980
I won't break up with Fang Lin.

107
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,920
Got the evidence.

108
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,720
Guan Ling, wait for me.

109
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,290
Contact me on WeChat if anything comes up.

110
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,640
Yi Xinran, what do you mean?

111
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,240
You're my best friend.

112
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,570
Is this how you treat me?

113
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,570
Why are you speaking ill of him?

114
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,920
Don't you know he's my boyfriend?

115
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,120
Just don't accidentally hurt beautiful me.

116
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,680
I'm going to practice piano first.

117
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,520
Bye-bye.

118
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,120
Let me show you a video first.

119
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,680
I'm warning you.

120
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,040
Break up with Fang Lin immediately.

121
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,880
I won't break up with Fang Lin.

122
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,240
You're the one who should leave.

123
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
What did you say?

124
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,480
I should be the one warning you.

125
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:55,920
From now on,

126
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,440
stop pestering my boyfriend.

127
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,300
You're the one seducing Fang Lin.

128
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,040
How about that?

129
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,840
I didn't slander Fang Lin, did I?

130
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,880
Could it be someone with the same name?

131
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,280
It would be bad if we misunderstood him.

132
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,140
I'll go ask him.

133
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,480
Why are you so stubborn?

134
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,400
I really think

135
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,130
He's the only one in the world who's sincere to me.

136
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,720
I'm not even pretty.

137
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,640
Send me the video.

138
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,040
I'll go ask him right now.

139
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,860
I should have stayed with Qingkong instead.

140
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,080
Why is Qingkong acting so strange today?
