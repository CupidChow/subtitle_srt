1
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,120
Qingkong.

2
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,320
What should I do?

3
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,080
Did I hurt you again?

4
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:12,880
Hello.

5
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,840
You are from the 36th parallel space.

6
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,240
Time traveler number 952788.

7
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,700
You are currently in a state of energy core deficiency.

8
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,250
current remaining energy,

9
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,640
10 percent.

10
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,810
Where is this place?

11
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,760
This is stored in the shell of the space-time device,

12
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,200
an interdimensional grid.

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,600
It belongs to a one-time consumable space.

14
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,039
This space can help you

15
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:39,479
store consciousness after energy depletion,

16
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,680
until the return program is activated.

17
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,080
How can I go back?

18
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,000
The traveler's energy needs

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,800
to recover to above 50% survival level.

20
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,000
Let me out.

21
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,600
This space can withstand

22
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,040
a 24th-level planetary destruction equivalent.

23
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,169
Please be rational.

24
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,759
Let me out.

25
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,010
I want to go back.

26
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,329
I want to go back.

27
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,650
I want to go back.

28
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,760
Qingkong.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,760
Why haven't you woken up yet?

30
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,680
Why are you so stupid?

31
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,440
I've already gone back.

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,160
Obviously.

33
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,730
I don't want to have any interaction with you.

34
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,640
Tell me,

35
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,320
how can I recharge?

36
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,620
Retrieve the energy core.

37
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,040
Replenish energy.

38
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,480
Energy core.

39
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,480
It must be retrieved by the time traveler themselves.

40
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,460
Before going back,

41
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,280
I can only stay here.

42
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,760
Yes.

43
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,240
Time traveler's energy.

44
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,800
When it's below 30 percent,

45
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,380
must stay in the interdimensional grid.

46
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,720
Your remaining energy is insufficient.

47
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,250
Please recharge promptly.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,329
Qingkong, are you playing with me for fun?

49
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,920
Yi Xinran.

50
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,280
Fool.

51
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,260
Is running away going to help?

52
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,040
Current energy remaining: 2%.

53
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,480
Synchronize frequency with the energy core to recharge.

54
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,020
This is for you.

55
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,080
Could it be that I...

56
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,920
...have already fallen for her?

57
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,250
You've been unconscious for ten days.

58
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,320
Please wake up.

59
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,560
Energy core frequency fluctuation detected.

60
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,159
Time traveler and energy core...

61
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,820
...entering same frequency.

62
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,440
Energy reward obtained.

63
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,080
Current energy remaining: 32%.

64
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,080
33%.

65
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,560
34%.

66
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,400
Why did my arm suddenly light up?

67
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,540
And it flickers like a heartbeat.

68
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,600
Doctor, nurse.

69
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,080
Current energy remaining at 43%.

70
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,240
44.

71
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,840
The patient is awake.

72
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,770
A few days of observation and they can be discharged.

73
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,240
These past few days, she...

74
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,770
has barely closed her eyes.

75
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,280
I know.

76
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't move.

77
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,610
You're not fully recovered yet. Lie down.

78
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,920
Xinran.

79
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,040
I have something to tell you.

80
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,240
You just woke up. Are you hungry?

81
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,740
I'm not hungry.

82
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,520
All these experiences lately...

83
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,000
How are you feeling now?

84
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,860
Are you in any discomfort?

85
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
Actually, there are some things...

86
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,360
Since you're awake,

87
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,080
I think I'll head back to school.

88
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,240
You get some rest.

89
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,680
Qingkong.

90
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,360
I know what you want to say.

91
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
I want to tell you I feel the same way.

92
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,920
But I can't hurt you again.

93
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,100
We shouldn't see each other anymore.

94
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,360
What's wrong with her?
