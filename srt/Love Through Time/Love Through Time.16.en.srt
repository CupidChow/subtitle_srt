1
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,320
I waited for him for a long time.

2
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,040
But all I got was a sour face.

3
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,500
Come on, I'll take you out for some good food.

4
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,440
And we can catch up on some gossip while we're at it.

5
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,520
I knew you were the best.

6
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,050
Come here and give me a kiss.

7
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,800
What's wrong with me?

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,050
I get upset when I see them talking.

9
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,600
That's called being jealous.

10
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,760
Jealousy.

11
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,640
It's when someone else seems

12
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,720
better than you, and it makes you feel sour inside.

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,680
Like you've drunk vinegar.

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,120
You like Yi Xinran.

15
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,640
That Jia Yan likes her too.

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,960
So you're jealous.

17
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,560
He's better than me? Nonsense.

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,680
No wonder you feel sour inside.

19
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,760
That's what jealousy is.

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,400
This is what jealousy looks like.

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,440
Can't you even see that?

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,920
You single dog.

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,440
Look who's talking.

24
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,280
As they say, there are handsome guys in books.

25
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,320
The drivers in books know how to drive.

26
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,280
I'm a single dog.

27
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,400
But I know a lot.

28
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,440
You guys carry on.

29
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,620
What are you considering?

30
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,360
So Qingkong can get jealous too.

31
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,680
Should I send him a message?

32
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,320
Oh right, about what you just mentioned.

33
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,479
I'm quite interested.

34
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,960
Can you take me along?

35
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,520
What is it?

36
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,920
It's about the band that Jia Yan mentioned.

37
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,820
I'm really good at playing the drums.

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,920
Unfortunately, my family forced me

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,850
to learn classical and folk music.

40
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,580
I think forming a band is a great idea.

41
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,700
This way, we can continue to perform commercially after graduation.

42
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,400
Xinran, are you still angry?

43
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,800
Xinran, you're up so early.

44
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,600
How did you decide in the end?

45
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,520
What do you mean, how did I decide?

46
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,880
Stop pretending.

47
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,540
The band, it's about the band.

48
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,160
The band.

49
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,600
You said Qingkong was jealous.

50
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,720
Then why don't you invite him to join?

51
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,280
That's right.

52
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,320
Qingkong, I have something to tell you.

53
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,480
Xinran, I'm here.

54
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,880
I'm adjusting the sound.

55
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,640
Qingkong.

56
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,640
He's the one leading this.

57
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,200
That person.

58
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
You don't mind, do you?

59
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,600
I don't mind.

60
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,610
What's there for me to mind?

61
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,520
Stop.

62
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,240
Everyone's doing their own thing.

63
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,880
You two aren't cooperating at all.

64
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,480
How can we perform like this?

65
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,200
It's just the beginning.

66
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,440
Everyone is still getting to know each other.

67
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,560
We'll get along better after some time.

68
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,220
Just need some time to adjust.

69
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:36,770
Here.

70
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,170
Everyone, do your best.

71
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,000
Why do you look unhappy?

72
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,280
I'm not.

73
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:06,840
Oh.

74
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,900
Why did you stop asking me?

75
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,760
You said you weren't.

76
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,920
Then why have you been unhappy lately?

77
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,720
Wasn't I always like this?

78
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,080
I guess you're right.

79
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,720
But I prefer to see you happy.

80
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,200
Let's go eat.

81
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:51,960
Okay.

82
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,800
Xinran.

83
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,440
Shouldn't you call me senior?

84
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,100
You're being disrespectful.

85
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,220
I thought about it yesterday.

86
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,170
We can practice just two songs.

87
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,120
Practice makes perfect, you know.

88
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,960
I think so too.

89
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,840
Oh, right. This is for you.

90
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,680
I noticed yesterday that your pick wasn't working well anymore.

91
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,360
So I bought two new ones for you.

92
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,840
I hope you like them.
