1
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,680
It seems

2
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,900
we've arrived.

3
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,880
The journey was so short.

4
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,880
We got here so quickly.

5
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,800
I'll head back first.

6
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:53,720
Okay.

7
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,520
Back at the dorm.

8
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,480
You should go to bed early.

9
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,400
Why are you still following me?

10
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,520
Because I want to look at you one more time.

11
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,160
Alright.

12
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,400
I'll go back first.

13
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,520
Goodbye.

14
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,560
Do you like me?

15
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,400
Yes, I do.

16
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,840
I'll go up first.

17
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,440
Come on, baby.

18
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,840
I'm coming.

19
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,400
Yi Xinran, hug me.

20
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,530
Let's take a selfie.

21
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,440
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

22
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,080
Get up, Yi Xinran, wake up!

23
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,220
Qingkong is already downstairs.

24
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,680
You two aren't coming back tonight, are you?

25
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,720
Stop it, what are you saying?

26
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,360
Qingkong, you should thank me.

27
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,480
To encourage you,

28
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,880
I even sold out Yi Xinran.

29
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,440
Thank you.

30
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,120
Why are you thanking her?

31
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,680
Of course he should thank me.

32
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,740
You know, I even...

33
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,170
Let's go, go, go, go, go.

34
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:47,960
Let's go quickly.

35
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,000
Yi Xinran, you definitely won't want to see me tonight.

36
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,840
You better go now.

37
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,560
Good luck.

38
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,240
Wait, good luck.

39
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,080
Let's go.

40
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,210
There's actually a car.

41
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,320
I didn't know you could drive.

42
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,840
The car is rented.

43
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,520
I've known how to drive for a long time.

44
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,840
It's good to learn more things.

45
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,040
It can't hurt, right?

46
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,400
What are you thinking about? You look so happy.

47
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,440
I'm remembering when we were on the bus.

48
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,600
At that time,

49
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,280
I thought you were being shy.

50
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,560
Actually, I didn't understand emotions.

51
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,160
You've taught me a lot.

52
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,480
Let's go quickly.

53
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,560
Where are we going anyway?

54
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,680
You'll know when we get there.
