1
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,080
Qing Kong.

2
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,760
I know what you want to say.

3
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,480
I want to tell you I feel the same way.

4
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,320
But I can't hurt you again.

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,100
We'd better not meet anymore.

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,180
What's wrong with her?

7
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,400
I'll just take a quick peek.

8
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,730
What is Yi Xinran doing?

9
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,440
Why hasn't the food been delivered yet?

10
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,280
Who sent it?

11
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,040
Isn't it obvious who sent it?

12
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,480
Yi Xinran.

13
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,880
What are you sneaking around out there for?

14
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,000
N-nothing.

15
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,720
What?

16
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,840
Don't you have hands of your own?

17
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,360
Won't you blow it?

18
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,920
You still need to blow it?

19
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,560
Yi Xinran.

20
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,640
I want to eat an apple.

21
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,040
Do you know what I've been through

22
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,240
lately?

23
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,280
What happened?

24
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,720
I was trapped in a confined space.

25
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,880
I wanted to get out but couldn't.

26
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,320
I kept looking for a way out.

27
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,240
So how did you get out?

28
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,840
Because

29
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,040
Did you time travel?

30
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,480
Mm-hmm.

31
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,240
but I know

32
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,680
you time traveled to save me, didn't you?

33
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,920
Mm-hmm.

34
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,280
Why do you only know how to say 'mm-hmm'?

35
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,820
I'm heading back to school first.

36
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,120
Yi Xinran,

37
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,450
why are you staying so far away from me?

38
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,090
My legs aren't as long as yours.

39
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,159
Yi Xinran,

40
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,040
I like you.

41
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,880
But...

42
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,520
I don't like you anymore.

43
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,320
Qingkong,

44
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,020
it's for your own good.

45
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,280
I can only stay away from you.

46
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,620
This must be what it feels like to have your heart cut by a knife.

47
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,040
Qingkong,

48
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,160
I can only bring you trouble.

49
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,320
So leaving you

50
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,580
is what's best for you.

51
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,200
You, female scammer, indeed have no class.

52
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,200
So you're saying

53
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,860
you're not a shill hired by those emotional manipulators?

54
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,920
So you're saying

55
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,560
you went to that emotional manipulation training class

56
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,960
to work undercover?

57
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,200
Let me introduce myself.

58
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,040
My name is Jia Yan.

59
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,900
A promising young talent for the future of society.

60
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,400
Hello.

61
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,640
Yi Xinran.

62
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,720
That day,

63
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,130
I was the one who called the police.

64
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,640
You two,

65
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,260
have you broken up?

66
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,120
No.

67
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,140
We were just ordinary friends to begin with.

68
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,840
Do you really like him?
