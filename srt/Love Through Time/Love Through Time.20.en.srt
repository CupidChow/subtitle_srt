1
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,319
Qingkong.

2
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,960
The mission is accomplished.

3
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,960
The energy core has been successfully recovered.

4
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,160
The countdown for return has now begun.

5
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,120
In terms of this timeline, it's

6
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,450
seventy-two hours.

7
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,090
Am I really leaving so soon?

8
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,440
Why are you up so early?

9
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,520
Is something bothering you?

10
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,840
Yi Xinran,

11
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,720
I'm about to leave.

12
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,240
When will you be back?

13
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,600
Time travelers

14
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,280
never return to the same timeline.

15
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,680
Was it because of my previous selfishness

16
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,600
that drained your energy core,

17
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,360
causing you to leave so soon?

18
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,570
The duration of my travel this time

19
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,480
was always meant to be this long.

20
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,880
Then why did you come to provoke me?

21
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,120
Chase me, kiss me.

22
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,240
What am I to you, after all?

23
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,680
Someone I like.

24
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,400
Well, I'm truly honored.

25
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,400
That's not what I meant.

26
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,600
Then what do you mean?

27
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,920
Why are you only telling me this now?

28
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,000
I hate you.

29
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,680
Qingkong, I can't become your burden.

30
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,120
Why haven't I heard from you lately?

31
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,920
What have you been up to, senior?

32
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,320
Senior,

33
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,260
are you having a sweet time with your boyfriend?

34
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,080
Xinran.

35
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,080
Shouldn't you call me senior? Where are your manners?

36
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,320
Yi Xinran.

37
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,400
I'm about to leave.

38
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,280
Senior, do you have time to go out for a drink?

39
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,520
to catch up.

40
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,880
Okay.

41
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,200
This place

42
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
is nice, isn't it?

43
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,140
It has a great view.

44
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,400
Drowning your sorrows in alcohol like this

45
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,570
will only make you more miserable.

46
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,040
Since you own the entire forest,

47
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,760
Who have you loved?

48
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,960
Do you understand the feeling

49
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,360
after a passionate love?

50
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,850
How do you know I haven't loved?

51
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,800
The kind of love where you can only watch from afar,

52
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,320
isn't that even harder?

53
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,040
I'm sorry.
