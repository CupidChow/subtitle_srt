1
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,760
Yi Xinran.

2
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,280
I love you.

3
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,440
Qingkong.

4
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:28,000
I can't forget him.

5
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,080
Number 952788.

6
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,600
Target: The 36th parallel space.

7
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,620
Crossing identity: Student.

8
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,640
Name: Qingkong.

9
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,280
952788.

10
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,040
Use special ability to pause time.

11
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,640
Self-destruct energy core.

12
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,560
This means you can't cross parallel spaces again.

13
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,000
If I leave,

14
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,080
will Yi Xinran suffer?

15
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,600
No, she won't.

16
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,640
All traces of your presence

17
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,920
in the 36th parallel space

18
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,960
will disappear,

19
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,000
as if

20
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,760
you had never been here.

21
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,880
That's for the best.

22
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,560
That star is so bright.

23
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,840
Do you know it?

24
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,080
Alpha Lyrae,

25
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,200
also known as Vega.

26
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,080
It's about

27
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,080
25 light-years away from us.

28
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,159
That's far.

29
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,080
What we see is

30
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,240
Vega from 25 years ago.

31
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,400
But I feel the distance between us is even greater,

32
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,640
so far that it's unreachable.

33
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,690
I feel like I've forgotten something.

34
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,680
I'll remember it.

35
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,600
In the universe, there are countless other universes.

36
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,340
There might be many other versions of me.

37
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,370
As long as the stars continue to shine,

38
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,520
I believe

39
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,440
that one day

40
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,000
he will return.
