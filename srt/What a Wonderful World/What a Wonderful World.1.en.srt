And then?

Then...

00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,570
I left my bag in his car.

338
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,240
He sent me to the entrance
of my residential area.

339
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,240
Then he delivered my bag to my house.

340
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,920
Did that happen?

341
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,680
He went in?

342
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,830
A man and a woman indoors?

343
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,250
What else could've happened?

344
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,490
Your clothes were all wet.

345
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:27,920
You undressed

346
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,050
and closed the door.

347
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,950
You must've had fun, huh?

348
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:32,840

349
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,070
I was wrong.

350
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,400
I was wrong, okay?

351
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,080
I'll do whatever you say.

352
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,000
Disappear.

353
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,800
That won't do.

354
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,200
How annoying.

355
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,640
How do I unlock this?

356
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,830
How am I annoying?

357
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,790
In every way.

358
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,310
When you eat, drink, burp, and breathe,

359
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,070
must you be so loud?

360
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,310
Am I loud?

361
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,310
Yes, you're very loud now.

362
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,510
I'm going deaf.

363
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,830
You have schizophrenia.

364
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,110
There's a radar in your head.

365
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,440
You're basically a bat.

366
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,830
I'm only a bat

367
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,960
when it comes to you.

368
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,620
You must be fine with him, huh?

369
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,160
Let's make it clear.

370
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,360
I have someone I like.

371
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,940
Please disappear.

372
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,750
I have amnesia, okay?

373
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,960
Be understanding.

374
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,830
How?

375
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,920
You come to me when you're bored.

376
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,480
When you're sick of me,
you pretend to have an episode,

377
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,070
then come back in a few days
like nothing happened.

378
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,200
You think of me as a fool.

379
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,440
You even hit me.

380
