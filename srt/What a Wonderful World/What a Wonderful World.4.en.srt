[I was wrong.]

191
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,030
So vivid.

192
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,960
It's like a dream.

193
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,840
Never felt this good before.

194
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,790
I don't like the way you are now.

195
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,580
Don't move.

196
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,170
Nobody move!

197
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,240
This is my favorite song.

198
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:44,880
Come on.

199
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,650
What did you say?

200
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,550
What did I say?

201
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,440
Just now.

202
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,440
I said it's so vivid.

203
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,640
Not that.

204
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,880
What did you just say?

205
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,480
I said I like the way you are now.

206
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,480
Martial arts master.

207
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,350
Who is he?

208
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,000
An NPC.

209
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:30,760
Jia Xiaoduo.

210
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,050
Let's have a serious talk.

211
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:37,750
Okay.

212
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,000
No joking.

213
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,510
Okay.

214
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,350
With liquid courage in me now.

215
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,280
Or else I wouldn't have the guts to.

216
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,000
Go on.

217
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,960
Let's be together.

218
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,960
Let's work towards marriage.

219
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,240
A bit hasty, I know.

220
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,800
I should be saying this with a ring.

221
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,320
If you don't object,

222
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,580
I'll buy one tomorrow.

223
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,880
I'll take your reaction as a yes.

224
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,830
Aren't we already together?

225
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,510
I work at an AI company.
I don't earn much,

226
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,040
but it isn't shabby either.

227
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,360
If you agree,

228
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,710
I'll stop doing ride-hailing.

229
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,570
I have savings.

230
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,280
Every day, we'll go to work,

231
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,679
go shopping, play games;

232
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,639
live a good life.

233
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,440
One thing is guaranteed:

234
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,699
I'll love you forever.

235
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,840
I have no prospects.

236
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,590
Others look down on me,

237
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,250
and I don't dare to eye others.

238
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,000
Are you on board?

239
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,070
The battery is dying.

240
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,070
Move!

241
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:02,630
Watch it!

242
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,710
I said move!

243
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,550
You're blocking the way!

244
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,230
Move!

245
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,360
I'm warning you, don't push me!

246
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,710
Last warning!

247
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,840
Move now, you hear me?

248
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,760
Why should I move?

249
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,690
I'm in the right! Why should I move?

250
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,000
Move!

251
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,760
Not going to do it?

252
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,030
And what about it?

253
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,400
-Seriously?
-Try me!

254
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,330
Are you on board?

255
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,370
What do you mean?

256
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,250
Let's be together.

257
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,710
Let's work towards marriage.

258
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,440
Do you know who I am?

259
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,010
You're Jia Xiaoduo.

260
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,810
The NPC from Jinse Entertainment.

261
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,480
You are the NPC.

262
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,280
Be with me,

263
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,400
and I'll be your NPC for life.

264
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,710
Your dream!

265
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,450
Directing traffic.

266
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,440
Isn't it yours?

267
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,880
Your dreams are my dreams.

268
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,400
Watch it!

269
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,200
Don't push me.

270
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,320
So what if I push you?

271
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,320
Try it again.

272
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,000
Sure.

273
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,280
Officer.

274
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:28,940
Who are you?

275
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,080
Traffic police.

276
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,320
He's drunk.

277
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,400
Go back, go back.

278
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,730
Do something about him.

279
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,510
Go back!

280
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,230
Still not done, huh?

281
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:37,960
So what?

282
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,030
Shut up. Let the police settle this.

283
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,490
Let's talk this out first.

284
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,450
Come, this way.

285
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,320
This way.

286
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,000
Sir.

287
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,260
Why should I move for you?

[Police]

289
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,230

00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:20,960
you hear me?

291
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,710
You two!

292
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,340
Just get in the car.

293
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,880
Back up a little.

294
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,870
Sir, could you also back up a bit?

295
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,520
Back up just a little.

296
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,220
Back up.

297
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:47,240
Watch out for pedestrians!

298
