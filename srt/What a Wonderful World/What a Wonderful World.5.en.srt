Jia Xiaoduo is a girl I like.

379
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,030
I like her a lot.

380
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,760
And then?

381
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,360
Who are you?

382
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,120
I'm your attending doctor.

383
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,630
Who?

384
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,160
I first officially talked
and interacted with her

385
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,960
three days ago.

386
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,320
Before that, I was preparing
to do a beta test

387
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,150
of a virtual space for TXY.

388
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,840
I hadn't made up my mind to do it.

389
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,630
That night, Jia Xiaoduo

390
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:46,360
took me to an escape room
at Jinse Entertainment.

391
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,480
By daybreak,

392
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,760
I felt I must have fallen for her.

393
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,110
And then?

394
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,070
Now I feel very disturbed.

395
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,510
I don't know if this heart is mine

396
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,070
or Jia Xiaoduo's.

397
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,030
Last night in the virtual space,

398
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,590
Xu Tian died.

399
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,880
I can try to book
his ride-hailing service.

400
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,150
I have his number in my phone,

401
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,800
but I'm scared.

402
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,320
Scared he no longer exists in this world.

403
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,230
Maybe this is

404
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,070
why I became Jia Xiaoduo.

405
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,880
Xu Tian is dead?

406
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,800
How did he die?

407
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,590
A car.

408
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,920
In front of the police station.

409
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,840
I wish I hadn't told him the truth.

410
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,880
He also told me...

411
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,480
not to rush to log off.

412
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,530
That a lifetime might pass
before we know it.

413
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,070
I'm actually Xu Tian.

414
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,550
What's going on?

415
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,000
Weak cognition of

416
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,510
the host identity.

417
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,920
What the hell's going on?

418
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,670
This is Xishan Recovery Hospital.

419
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:42,800
You were admitted for
dissociative identity disorder.

420
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:45,120
Our treatment has been effective.

421
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,920
There are four alters in your body:

422
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,000
Tie Lin, the delivery agent,

423
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,200
Liu Tiao'er, the dieter,

424
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,760
and the motorcyclist—

425
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,960
Nonsense!

426
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,630
Who are you?

427
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,890
I'm your attending doctor,

428
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,710
Shi Yiben.

429
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,230
Have some water.

430
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,740
It's been three years.

431
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,150
We meet twice a week

432
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,760
for psychotherapy here.

433
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,320
We trust each other—

434
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,440
I don't trust you!

435
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,320
My head is about to explode.

436
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,720
The three alters inside you were

437
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,070
Yu Dan,

438
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,280
Liu Tiao'er,

439
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,020
and the motorcyclist.

440
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,000
Now,

441
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,920
only Tie Lin is left.

442
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,760
Who am I?

443
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,550
Now, you are Jia Xiaoduo.

444
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,190
What about Xu Tian?

445
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,400
Come in.

446
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:15,350
Let's schedule another
hypnotherapy session next week.

447
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,110
Am I still in the virtual space?

448
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:42,250
You're in Xishan Recovery Hospital.

449
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:44,760
As if.

450
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,360
This situation is rare.

451
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:52,710
What situation?

452
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,880
The alter replacing
the primary personality.

453
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,710
Who's replacing whom?

454
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:02,320
Book an appointment for next week.

455
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,550
Thanks, but I won't be coming back.
