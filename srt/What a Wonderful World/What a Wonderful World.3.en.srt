00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,840
to this stone pillar with a big chain.

170
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,960

171
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,360
I don't have a boyfriend.

172
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,670
What ex-boyfriend?

173
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,480
Can you stop beating around the bush?

175
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,420
Well...

176
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,570
Where did the pillar go?

177
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,620
There was a stone pillar here!

178
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,710
Shouldn't there be a stone pillar here?

179
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,950
Something like this.

180
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,910
You think I'm crazy?

181
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,710
I'm losing my memory?

182
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,790
The stone pillar had

183
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,960
"I love you, Wang Yangming"

184
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,030
engraved on it!

185
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,980

186
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,510
What were we doing inside just now?

187

188
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,400
How many of us were we?

189
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,200
You and I.

190
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,360
We were VIPs.

380
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,870

So we need to keep testing.

394

If I'm still unstable after another test,

395
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,720
it means there's something wrong with your virtual space.

398

It depends on whether that time
