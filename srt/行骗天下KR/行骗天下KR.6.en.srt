1
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:41,542
How is my condition in your opinion?

2
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:48,841
It's too late now.

3
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:50,634
Late?

4
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:52,428
What do you mean?

5
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:53,637
What do you mean late?

6
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,432
Are you saying she has no chance
even with surgery?

7
00:00:59,018 --> 00:00:59,852
It's because…

8
00:01:02,188 --> 00:01:04,774
Chairman Ju already came by.

9
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,821
She means she's already booked.

10
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:12,531
It doesn't mean you have no chance.

11
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:14,700
What a relief.

12
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:17,953
-And here, I thought… My goodness.
-This is great.

13
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:20,456
Chairman Ju? Then…

14
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:23,083
No, it wasn't me.

15
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:26,504
Someone that great
wouldn't have just inquired with me.

16
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,422
Please don't get me wrong.

17
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:29,381
Are you sure?

18
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:38,474
What a shame. Is the location that bad?

19
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,351
Is it in a different place?

20
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,854
It's near the left collarbone.

21
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,190
And the angiostenosis is too severe.

22
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,360
If we don't stop
the blockage of blood flow in time,

23
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,738
-it would cause serious brain damage.
-That's right.

24
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:56,408
<i>What? Brain damage?</i>

25
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:06,794
No.

26
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:13,717
Dr. Rachel, please help me.

27
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:15,845
I'm sorry. I have to go.

28
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,889
Doctor, no!

29
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,099
-Don't go. Please.
-Goddamn it!

30
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,016
Doctor!

31
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,643
-What are you doing?
-Geez!

32
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,603
-Don't touch her!
-Let go!

33
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:25,771
-Let her go!
-Move!

34
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:26,897
-Doctor!
-Let her go!

35
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:28,691
Please don't go, Doctor!

36
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,277
-Please, I'm begging you.
-Damn, that hurts.

37
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:34,572
Doctor, please.

38
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,742
Hey, has Chairman Ju
transferred the money yet?

39
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:40,578
Chairman Ju.

40
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,540
He promised to deposit
$2 million by 3:00 p.m.

41
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,417
<i>Two million dollars is 2.8 billion won.</i>

42
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,669
<i>For just one surgery?</i>

43
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:53,382
By 3:00 p.m.?

44
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:58,679
<i>Chairman Ju's life is worth $2 million?</i>

45
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,390
<i>Then, how much is my life worth?</i>

46
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,647
Shall we get going?

47
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:10,900
-Sure.
-Okay.

48
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,360
Seon-mi.

49
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,164
I'll pay you $2.5 million!

50
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:34,131
Great thinking.

51
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,300
Your life comes first. Money isn't--

52
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,760
Please do my surgery!

53
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:42,681
Please.

54
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:44,600
I'll wire you the money.

55
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,650
Once the money's deposited,
we're taking off!

56
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:01,700
By the way, where are we going?

57
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:02,785
The Philippines!

58
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,621
What? No, not the Philippines!
I hate the Philippines!

59
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,415
No, I have trauma from it!
No, not the Philippines!

60
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:11,752
Then, how about Boracay?

61
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,337
Boracay sounds good!

62
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,922
Boracay? Boracay!

63
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:16,298
I like Boracay.

64
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:21,011
We don't need to tell him that Boracay
is part of the Philippines, do we?

65
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:22,012
Of course not.

66
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:23,806
DEPOSIT RECEIVED FROM LEE SEON-MI

67
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,184
It's here!

68
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,268
Nice!

69
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,608
Am I reading this right?

70
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,361
How many zeros are there? One, two, three…

71
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,822
-Just 100 million?
-This is 334 million won.

72
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,323
It's missing one zero.

73
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,629
EPISODE 6

74
00:04:55,713 --> 00:05:00,050
{\an8}We're a little short on capital

75
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,511
{\an8}to immediately have cash on hand.

76
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,432
{\an8}We sent 10% first as a deposit.

77
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:10,019
{\an8}I'll pay you the rest after surgery--

78
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,396
{\an8}That's not what you said yesterday.

79
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,858
{\an8}It's due to construction on our branch.

80
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,610
{\an8}Our money is tied to that.

81
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:19,528
{\an8}I…

82
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,031
{\an8}will not do the surgery.

83
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:24,658
{\an8}No, wait…

84
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:25,701
{\an8}Return the deposit.

85
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:26,660
{\an8}What?

86
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,579
{\an8}What? But…

87
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,125
{\an8}What if I'd said that?

88
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,765
Goodness.

89
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,811
In return, if the surgery goes well,

90
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:56,607
we'll pay you 10% extra.

91
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,072
Was three billion won too much?

92
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,365
Damn, I thought we almost had it.

93
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,950
I saw this coming.

94
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:09,411
What do you mean?

95
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,044
We might as well do the surgery.

96
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:20,297
How can we perform surgery
on someone who's not even ill?

97
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,800
It's easier because she's not ill.

98
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,718
All we have to do is not kill her.

99
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:26,386
-Are you crazy?
-Are you crazy?

100
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:31,475
<i>Mom, are you crazy?</i>

101
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,770
How can you make such a deal
in this situation?

102
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:39,358
We don't even know
if the surgery will be successful or not.

103
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:42,069
How can we send
that much money all at once?

104
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,946
Gosh, I can't believe you.

105
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,781
We'll get a call.

106
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,202
No.

107
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,621
This is wrong, Mom!

108
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,790
We can't just keep waiting like this.

109
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,209
I'll call Professor Yu now.

110
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,252
COORDINATOR MA

111
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,211
Let's ask…

112
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,263
-Hello?
<i>-Hi, this is Coordinator Ma.</i>

113
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:11,849
<i>Rachel has decided to do the surgery.</i>

114
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,518
Okay, thank you.

115
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,105
See that?

116
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,318
See that? I told you.

117
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,572
You're really unbelievable.

118
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,713
This is my team from Boston.

119
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,674
This is Daniel,
who I've been working with for ten years.

120
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,426
Sandy.

121
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,886
Edmund.

122
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:49,970
Patrick.

123
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,347
And this is our nurse, Abigail.

124
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:56,602
They're the best specialists.
You can count on them.

125
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:57,853
Okay.

126
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:02,107
Now that I'm seeing them in person,
I feel relieved.

127
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,152
I'll leave it all in your hands, Doctor.

128
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,947
All right. Shall we go?

129
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:16,371
It'll go well, right?

130
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:19,583
Of course. Don't worry.

131
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,755
Actually, Rachel is very sensitive.

132
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,381
I see.

133
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:29,676
The contract doesn't allow
for observing in person,

134
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,594
so we should go now.

135
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:33,138
Right. Let's go.

136
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,980
RESTRICTED AREA

137
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:47,653
{\an8}You should go on ahead.

138
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,490
-Okay, I will.
-Thanks.

139
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,248
Has the surgery…

140
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:00,582
Are you out of money?

141
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,585
Do you regret it now
after giving it some thought?

142
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:09,424
You're already too late, you punk.

143
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:14,471
When I went to ask you in person,
that was the last chance of your life.

144
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,058
Did you think I wouldn't be able
to do anything without you?

145
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:20,435
You sure about that?

146
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,436
What if I wasn't?

147
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,442
As if you could do anything
with this damn hand.

148
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,319
Hey, get out of my sight.

149
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,612
You disgust me.

150
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,452
{\an8}JAEKYEONG HOSPITAL

151
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,186
The surgery has now begun.

152
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:06,356
I hope she gets through it.

153
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,733
Don't worry.

154
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,194
She's a strong woman,
so she'll get through it fine.

155
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,244
Okay, then!

156
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:22,205
-Now, what do we do?
-What else?

157
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,884
I don't know what that means, but sure.
Okay.

158
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,894
Wait, what's wrong with the screen?

159
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,396
-Call the control room.
-Yes, sir.

160
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,397
Hurry!

161
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,982
-Yes, Dr. Jo.
-Wait.

162
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,485
Let me try.

163
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,029
I worked in maintenance in the past.

164
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:59,368
-You should've checked this in advance!
-I'm sorry, sir.

165
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,122
THE VIDEO CANNOT BE PLAYED

166
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:10,837
There it is.

167
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,383
My apologies.

168
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,477
{\an8}What on earth?
They haven't even made a cut yet?

169
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,565
Hurry up and do something.

170
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:32,692
<i>He noticed you haven't cut her yet.</i>

171
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,444
Wait.

172
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:37,531
How does he know we didn't even cut…

173
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,159
Damn it. Hey, gather around.

174
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:43,286
Huddle up. Hey! Quickly!

175
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,247
Are we being filmed right now?

176
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,623
I think we're being filmed.

177
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,916
What do we do?

178
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,668
Damn it!

179
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,712
What do we do? We have to do something.

180
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,881
-What do we do?
-Wait, please be quiet!

181
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:56,675
Calm down for a second.

182
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,139
What's with you?

183
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,312
First, make the incision with the scalpel.

184
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:12,441
Next, open the incision
and check her aorta.

185
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:16,236
Cut it and stitch the ends back together.

186
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:18,905
Isn't that easy?

187
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,201
What are you… What on earth are you doing?

188
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:27,914
We might as well do the surgery.

189
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:30,333
All we have to do is not kill her.
I'll keep her alive.

190
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,545
You're not serious, are you?

191
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:38,258
I have the start and end
of this surgery all pictured in my head.

192
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,177
Okay, Yi-rang.

193
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,261
I know you're great.

194
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,305
I've always known you were smart.

195
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,140
I acknowledge that you're amazing.

196
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,727
But this is a whole different issue.

197
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,521
A person's life is on the line!

198
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:52,606
Do you get it?

199
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,317
Well, that's true.

200
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,402
-So…
-Yeah?

201
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:58,904
We should still open her up.

202
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,697
Only that will prove we performed surgery.

203
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,325
You think that makes sense?

204
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,826
All right. Are you guys ready?

205
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,247
What do you mean "Yeah"?

206
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,665
-Scalpel.
-What?

207
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:13,084
Don't do this, Yi-rang. Seriously.

208
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,337
You really don't have
any faith in me, do you?

209
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,922
Come on, Yi-rang.

210
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,173
Let's begin.

211
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,302
She actually did it!

212
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,598
Blood! She's bleeding!

213
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,353
They're beginning now.

214
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,731
Mom, please.

215
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:50,455
Damn it.

216
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,757
Prepare the artificial blood vessel.

217
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,594
She's as amazing as everyone says.

218
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,596
How is she so good at that?

219
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,954
Why is she so good at this?

220
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:53,643
All right, my hands are getting
a feel for this.

221
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,234
We've controlled the bleeding
and we'll close her up.

222
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:31,640
My gosh!

223
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,266
Poor Chairman Lee!

224
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,184
Damn it.

225
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,565
Suction. Closer.

226
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:16,101
Inject epinephrine every three minutes.
Up the charge to 30 joules.

227
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:26,319
Please.

228
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,030
I'll go get someone!

229
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,287
Mom!

230
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,541
My poor mom! Mom!

231
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,501
Hey, what's going on? What is it?

232
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,378
-Tell me. What's the matter?
-I…

233
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,587
Mom…

234
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,633
My gosh. What do we do?

235
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,519
-Somebody come in!
-Mom!

236
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,604
Mom! No!

237
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,870
"Fuck" isn't the answer.
The doctor's here!

238
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,705
Doctor.

239
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,791
Doctor, do something!
It's chaos in here.

240
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:22,792
Come on.

241
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,961
Everyone, everything's okay now.

242
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,547
Doctors, the doctor is here! Okay?

243
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,341
Now, we just need to wait calmly.

244
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:31,468
Yes.

245
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,471
And we have one more doctor!

246
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,765
This is even better! We're okay now.

247
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,894
I can't do it.

248
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:42,479
What?

249
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,274
Gwang-sik.

250
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:48,443
Gwang-sik.

251
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,738
Please save my mom.

252
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:55,950
Look, I didn't mean what I said earlier.

253
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,536
I was upset at you,
so I just said it out of anger.

254
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:02,123
I'm really sorry.
I shouldn't have done that to you.

255
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:05,627
I hid behind my mom and ruined everything.

256
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,671
So, just vent all your anger on me.

257
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:12,342
But please save my mom.

258
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,471
Gwang-sik!

259
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:18,890
We're doctors.

260
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,433
If something happens to my mom…

261
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,977
If we can't save her while we can…

262
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:31,069
I won't be able to carry on. Gwang-sik.

263
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:34,948
Didn't I tell you the same thing before?

264
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,493
Seong-woo, we're doctors.

265
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,829
If something happens to her,

266
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:42,914
you think we'll be able
to continue with our careers?

267
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,375
Stop whining, you idiot.

268
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:51,881
Stop whining.

269
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:11,693
Mom!

270
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:19,200
Hey, you.

271
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,704
Unless you're going to grab a scalpel,
get lost.

272
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:34,799
But…

273
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,345
NO SIGNAL

274
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:41,514
Hey, he's a doctor!

275
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,474
Why would you let a doctor go?

276
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,768
Why let him go, you fool?

277
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:49,022
{\an8}What are we going to do now?
Someone's dying!

278
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,357
{\an8}-We're all doomed…
-All done!

279
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,318
-Let's pack it in!
-Pack it in!

280
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:57,405
What do you mean "pack it in"? Why?

281
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:58,489
She's still open!

282
00:19:58,573 --> 00:19:59,616
Good job, everyone!

283
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,075
Well done!

284
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,710
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

285
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:11,836
-Good job.
-"Good job"?

286
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,464
-Go, go.
-Thank you!

287
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,548
Let's go!

288
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:25,558
James, what is going…

289
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:29,979
No, James! Don't!

290
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,773
-No! Don't!
-Attention, please.

291
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,279
What is that?

292
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,240
Doesn't it look so realistic?

293
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:43,576
It's made of silicon and fiberglass.

294
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,702
It looks so real.

295
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,746
Look at this. You have to see it.

296
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,706
The heart is even pounding inside.

297
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,084
This is the heart.

298
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,088
You made all of that?

299
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:58,466
Even though I knew it was fake,
I was so surprised.

300
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,843
Everything here is a prop
from a film set.

301
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,762
What would we do
without Mr. Mustache?

302
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:03,680
I know.

303
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,766
You know the medical drama I always watch?
We took everything from there.

304
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,810
Why was I left in the dark again?

305
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,062
Wait.

306
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:14,232
Why do you have to take things so far?

307
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,775
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

308
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:18,069
She has to pay
for what she did to Jae-hee.

309
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,781
Then, was Dr. Im Gwang-sik…

310
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:25,284
Well…

311
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,414
He seemed to be wavering, so I went
to make sure he didn't change his mind.

312
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:33,001
Because what if he suddenly appears
and grabs a scalpel? So…

313
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:47,056
Oh no. We ran out of alcohol.

314
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,726
Why do I have to listen to you?

315
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,605
We can't let other children
end up like Jae-hee.

316
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:01,487
What am I supposed to do then?

317
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,573
Jo Seong-woo will soon visit you.

318
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,033
When he does…

319
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:19,839
<i>Squeeze some ketchup on your finger</i>
<i>and wrap this around it.</i>

320
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,174
Simple, right?

321
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:23,760
All right.

322
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:27,055
But on one condition.

323
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:29,932
He said, "On one condition."

324
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:33,019
Then, he suddenly asked me
if he could enter the operating room.

325
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,270
He said he wanted to

326
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,856
get payback on Jo Seong-woo
for all he had done to him.

327
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,107
That means

328
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:42,987
Dr. Im Gwang-sik also knew
this surgery was fake.

329
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:44,072
Obviously.

330
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:47,283
Now, Jo Seong-woo knows
how Jae-hee's mom felt.

331
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,576
Exactly.

332
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,661
But why was I the only one
who didn't know?

333
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:52,413
Why only me?

334
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:58,878
What?

335
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,800
Because you doubted me last time.

336
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:05,176
When did I…

337
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:08,638
Doctor, my foot.
Anyone can disinfect wounds.

338
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,557
She probably just read about it
from a few books.

339
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:14,268
Hey, that's…

340
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,521
Wait, that's…

341
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:21,192
Because of that one single comment?

342
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:25,113
You're such a pure soul,
which is why it's so fun to mess with you.

343
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:26,030
Let's go.

344
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:27,031
Bye.

345
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:32,870
You brats. Wait for me.

346
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:35,164
Where do you think you're going?

347
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:37,542
-Clean everything up before you go.
-What?

348
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,794
No.

349
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:41,546
I can't do this.

350
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:42,463
Guys?

351
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:53,015
What the heck?

352
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,559
Hey, Yi-rang!

353
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,435
Hey!

354
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,906
{\an8}COORDINATOR MA

355
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:11,284
{\an8}Why did he send me…

356
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,410
{\an8}WE'VE CONFIRMED THE DEPOSIT

357
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,665
But how is that…

358
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,919
<i>The number you have dialed does not exist.</i>

359
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:25,715
No way…

360
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:34,348
Mom!

361
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,392
What? What's the matter?

362
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:38,519
-Seong-woo.
-Yes?

363
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:42,815
Did you send the money?

364
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,026
No, right?

365
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,236
Did you send the money or not? No, right?

366
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:49,322
-I did…
-You did?

367
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:51,407
You idiot!

368
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:55,244
Oh no, you idiot! Look at this!

369
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,747
It was all a scam!

370
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,374
Those bastards
didn't operate and faked it!

371
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,959
What am I going to do?

372
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:04,337
Hey, call the police.

373
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,005
Call the police right now.

374
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:07,548
What's that?

375
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:09,926
This picture… Mom, what…

376
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:12,011
So you're okay?

377
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:14,055
You crazy bastard.

378
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:15,681
Call the police now. Coordinator Ma…

379
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:17,058
Call the police.

380
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:18,142
Coordinator Ma…

381
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:19,852
Come on! Call the police!

382
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,146
What am I going to do?

383
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,314
Coordinator Ma!

384
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:25,650
Coordinator Ma, please!

385
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,026
I said call the police, you idiot!

386
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,362
<i>The number you have dialed does not exist.</i>

387
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,698
<i>Please check and dial again.</i>

388
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:39,747
Those bastards scammed us!

389
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,959
No! What am I going to do?

390
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,794
My money!

391
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,045
-Mom, then are you…
-I know!

392
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:48,547
Hey, go check
the security cameras right now.

393
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:53,261
Does that mean you're not sick?
Mom, you're okay!

394
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:56,097
You crazy bastard.

395
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,682
You damn moron.

396
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:00,518
That's what matters to you?
Do you know how much it was?

397
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:05,064
You crazy bastard!
Do you know how much money it was?

398
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:08,234
I have to check the security cameras
before they run away!

399
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:09,819
Mom!

400
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,989
{\an8}<i>How long have you been performing</i>
<i>ghost surgeries for?</i>

401
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,533
{\an8}<i>How many other ghost surgeries</i>
<i>have you done?</i>

402
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:21,247
I've been performing ghost surgeries
for Director Jo Seong-woo.

403
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,624
{\an8}However, regardless of the surgery,

404
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,752
{\an8}my goal was to save people.

405
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:28,296
That's what mattered to me the most.

406
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:29,839
<i>I apologize.</i>

407
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,925
<i>According to one insider</i>
<i>during today's press conference…</i>

408
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:35,094
So that's how it came to an end.

409
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,014
Look at how many cameras there are.

410
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:41,600
He was always hidden behind Jo Seong-woo,
and now, he's finally in the spotlight.

411
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:44,103
It was a wrong
he just had to right as a doctor.

412
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,438
Let's go.

413
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:52,445
There used to be a convenience store
over there, but now it's a cafe.

414
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,071
How do you know this place so well?

415
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:57,366
I was hospitalized here for a long time
when I was a kid.

416
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:00,077
Right. Did you prepare what I asked?

417
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:06,542
Jae-hee!

418
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,127
How have you been?

419
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,962
Here, this is for you.

420
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:12,131
-Ta-da!
-Ta-da!

421
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:13,257
What is all this?

422
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:15,217
Jae-hee, remember what I promised you?

423
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:16,886
Isn't this a bit too much?

424
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:20,973
Actually, this isn't from me.
It's from Yi-rang.

425
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:22,558
Say thank you.

426
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:26,771
I've been awake for a while.
What took you so long to visit?

427
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:30,483
While you were asleep,
we had a lot to deal with.

428
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,610
-Jae-hee, do you want to try it?
-Shall we?

429
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,532
-Wow!
-Keep going to the right.

430
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:40,326
-Wait, no…
-To the left.

431
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:44,288
-Let's try it again.
-That was so close.

432
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:46,165
Okay! You got it.

433
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,249
Now, press it.

434
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,546
-You did it!
-Yeah!

435
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,801
Let's take it out.

436
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:00,137
Want to give it another go?

437
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,061
Do you want to play again?

438
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:20,074
MARCH 28, 2000

439
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:23,285
Yi-rang, it's time.
You have to go to the birthday party.

440
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:26,247
James, what comes to your mind
when you look at this painting?

441
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,040
Are you calling me that again?

442
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,376
I'm not James. I'm Seo In-jae.

443
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,129
If you say Seo In-jae backwards,
it's Jae-in Seo.

444
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,130
It sounds like James.

445
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:35,798
Oh, is that so?

446
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,968
Then, I'll say Yun Yi-rang backwards
and call you Rang-yi Yun.

447
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:41,053
Rang-yi Yun?

448
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:42,012
It sounds nice.

449
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,017
<i>"Waves on the Edge."</i>

450
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:51,230
Is it a waterfall
flowing from top to bottom?

451
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:52,940
Just thinking about it
feels refreshing.

452
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:55,234
No, this is an explosion.

453
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:58,154
An explosion? But it's blue.

454
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:03,659
It looks like a water stream,
but it's not flowing down.

455
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,663
It's splashing upward
due to strong pressure.

456
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,959
After hearing that,
I think you have a point.

457
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:15,087
Whether it's good or evil,
or light or dark,

458
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:17,089
it may ambiguous on the outside.

459
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,717
But if you look closely,
everything is clear.

460
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:21,302
Isn't that interesting?

461
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:23,053
No, it's not interesting.

462
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:25,598
You might find it interesting
because you're a prodigy,

463
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:29,185
but I hate anything
ambiguous and philosophical.

464
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,769
No, this is science.

465
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:32,813
-Do you want to see it?
-No, I'm good.

466
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:34,398
I said I'm good. Yi-rang?

467
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,277
Where are you going in those nice shoes?

468
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,445
Yi-rang!

469
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:43,407
Yi-rang.

470
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:51,123
You'll be late for your birthday party.
We have to hurry.

471
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,791
Yi-rang.

472
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:56,170
Yi-rang!

473
00:29:58,589 --> 00:29:59,590
Yi-rang…

474
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:05,679
We're going to be late for the party.
We have to go now.

475
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:09,391
Put this in and it's done!

476
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,727
-What's that?
-A volcanic explosion experiment.

477
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,271
Mix liquid soap and hydrogen peroxide.

478
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:17,233
Lastly, if you drop in potassium iodide,

479
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,693
it'll start to bubble and boom!

480
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:21,362
Boom? That's too dangerous.

481
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:24,365
-We have to go. Come on.
-No, wait! Wait…

482
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:29,870
Watch out!

483
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,794
It won't actually blow up.

484
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:38,921
Geez, stop fooling around.

485
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:40,256
You little…

486
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,096
That was a first!

487
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,430
This is amazing!

488
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:49,765
What's so amazing?

489
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,642
-That was dangerous.
-Miss Yi-rang.

490
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,647
Shall we go now?

491
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,151
Thank you.

492
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:03,529
Thank you.

493
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,407
Thank you.

494
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,414
Hey, Yi-rang!

495
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,583
Yi-rang!

496
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:16,750
-Yi-rang.
-Yi-rang.

497
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:18,002
Yi-rang, look at Mommy.

498
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:25,050
<i>The center square is all clear.</i>

499
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:26,218
Seo In-jae.

500
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:27,886
Yes, sir.

501
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:32,891
I'm going to drop off the VIPs
after the party.

502
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:35,269
You're in charge in the meantime.

503
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:36,228
Yes, sir.

504
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:38,772
Yi-rang!

505
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,025
Ladies and gentlemen.

506
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:45,070
First, we'd like to thank you on behalf
of Yi-rang and Yi-rang's parents,

507
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:50,743
for taking the time to come here
and celebrate Yi-rang's tenth birthday.

508
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,578
One seat is vacant. I'll check.

509
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:55,205
-Now, let's welcome the birthday girl.
-Something wrong?

510
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:58,584
Let's welcome Princess Yi-rang,
by singing <i>Happy Birthday</i>…

511
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,961
-Where did the kid next to you go?
-There was nobody here.

512
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:02,338
Princess Yi-rang!

513
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,298
Where's the kid next to you?

514
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:09,678
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

515
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:13,515
<i>Happy birthday, dear Yi-rang</i>

516
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:16,977
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

517
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,196
Just a second.

518
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:30,449
Wait, that's not Yi-rang!

519
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,034
-Really?
-She's not Yi-rang?

520
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:33,077
Where's Yi-rang?

521
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,790
Yi-rang wanted to switch dresses…

522
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:38,749
Where?

523
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,709
In the restroom.

524
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:45,130
What happened?

525
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:47,007
Yi-rang is gone.

526
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,760
-Yi-rang!
-Yi-rang!

527
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:51,637
Yi-rang!

528
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,347
-Yi-rang!
-Yi-rang!

529
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,683
You three, check over there.
You three, that way.

530
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:57,601
-Yi-rang!
-Yi-rang!

531
00:32:58,102 --> 00:32:59,144
Yi-rang!

532
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:01,271
-Yi-rang!
-Yi-rang!

533
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,190
Yi-rang!

534
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:05,275
-Yi-rang!
-Yi-rang!

535
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:06,777
Yi-rang, where are you?

536
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,642
She's gone. I'm sorry.

537
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:43,480
Honey!

538
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,691
-Honey, are you okay?
-Yi-rang!

539
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:49,236
Yi-rang!

540
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,115
Bring three billion in cash

541
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,993
and wait at Tongjin Development
near Exit 1 of Yuhyeon Station.

542
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:57,745
Then, I'll tell you where to meet.

543
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:01,290
TONGJIN DEVELOPMENT

544
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:13,844
I think we've been fooled again.

545
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:17,181
<i>I know. How many times has it been?</i>

546
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:18,640
It's been four times already.

547
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,642
Do you think he's noticed
we're tailing him?

548
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,438
Then, things will get complicated.

549
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:32,738
{\an8}INVESTIGATION HEADQUARTERS
AT RINE CHAIRMAN'S HOUSE

550
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:34,907
Not at home either.

551
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:35,991
How did it go?

552
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:39,203
The number was routed to prevent tracking,

553
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:42,748
and he's going around in circles,
wasting our time on purpose.

554
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:45,250
He didn't want to make this
an easy deal from the start.

555
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:47,711
Something's off.

556
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:51,131
If he was just testing to see
whether we'd tail him,

557
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:53,550
he should've made another deal right away.

558
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,303
But why hasn't he still?

559
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:57,763
You think it's motivated by a grudge?

560
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:00,641
I'm not sure.

561
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,602
Anyway, we'll have to wait
for him to call again.

562
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,688
What about the security cameras
around the theme park?

563
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,483
We checked everything.

564
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:12,319
But for some reason,
we couldn't find anything.

565
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,699
-Who's that?
-He used to be our chief's senior officer.

566
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:21,286
No wonder why he seems so fierce.

567
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:25,332
36 HOURS SINCE THE INCIDENT

568
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:33,966
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

569
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:37,261
<i>Happy birthday, dear Yi-rang</i>

570
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:54,653
<i>She disappeared without a trace.</i>
<i>What did I miss?</i>

571
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,296
She wasn't waving at me.

572
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,382
Then, who was she waving at?

573
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:23,682
<i>The theme of the party</i>
<i>was </i>Alice in Wonderland<i>.</i>

574
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,601
<i>There was nothing strange about it.</i>

575
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:31,148
Don't get caught
until you blow out the candles.

576
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:33,108
Okay.

577
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,943
Blow out the birthday candles,

578
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:37,237
and when you take off the mask,
say "Surprise."

579
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,197
That sounds really fun!

580
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:41,617
What are you going to do in the meantime?

581
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:45,245
There's something I have to do
without anyone knowing.

582
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:47,831
<i>What did she have to do</i>
<i>without anyone knowing?</i>

583
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:48,999
Yes, sir.

584
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,711
<i>I followed Yi-rang's friend,</i>
<i>who switched dresses with Yi-rang.</i>

585
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,046
Yi-rang!

586
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:56,173
<i>And Yi-rang…</i>

587
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:13,857
<i>The rabbits were playing</i>
<i>a game with Yi-rang.</i>

588
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:16,777
<i>A circle and a square.</i>

589
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:31,416
<i>A circle and a square.</i>

590
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:35,963
The hot-air balloon.

591
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:46,139
<i>There should be shapes</i>
<i>like circles, triangles, and squares.</i>

592
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:48,976
But there's nothing.

593
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:02,656
Hurry up and look.

594
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:05,742
I'm dead if Chief finds out.

595
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:08,078
People don't die that easily.

596
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:10,747
You haven't starved to death either
thanks to me.

597
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:11,665
Fine, you're right.

598
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:15,293
I stayed at your <i>gosiwon</i>
and sponged off you, okay?

599
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:18,088
Do you really have to use that against me?
It's so unfair.

600
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:21,091
I fed you, sheltered you,
and turned you into a detective, you brat.

601
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:22,801
Geez.

602
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:27,389
Hello? Yes, sir.

603
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,392
Oh, I just stepped out to buy something.

604
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:34,229
It was in the picture, but not anymore.

605
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:39,943
A triangle and a half circle.

606
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:44,197
The pirate ship?

607
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,044
A square and a circle.

608
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:03,008
A circle and a cylinder.

609
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:06,428
The drop tower ride.

610
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,056
There it is.

611
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:15,270
{\an8}A circle and a triangle?

612
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:21,568
A circle and a triangle.

613
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,155
I think there were more here.

614
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,200
An inverted triangle.

615
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,508
I found it.

616
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,275
Yi-rang was made
to get in the truck on her own.

617
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,404
Who on earth would do this?

618
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,495
I need a trophy to celebrate

619
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:16,456
my perfect victory.

620
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:38,728
This is boring. I want to go home now.

621
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:41,106
Is it because you keep losing?

622
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:45,068
People say you have an IQ of 167,

623
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:47,195
and you take after your dad,

624
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,990
so you hate to lose.

625
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:53,535
Thus, Rine Group will soon become
the biggest conglomerate in the world.

626
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:56,663
Is that why you kidnapped me?

627
00:40:58,331 --> 00:40:59,207
No.

628
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:00,750
Then why?

629
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,670
Why do you want to know?

630
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:10,594
All you have to do is have fun.

631
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:12,053
Then…

632
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,641
everything will be over.

633
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,941
2 DAYS SINCE THE INCIDENT

634
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:29,196
How long have you been here for?

635
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:33,575
Hasn't it been suffocating here?

636
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,579
Do you think Mom is doing okay?

637
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:42,042
Seriously, can you believe
they still haven't found me yet?

638
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:49,549
What if I can never go back home?

639
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:52,802
I'm scared.

640
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:02,604
There must be a way to get out of here.

641
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,111
Do you remember this T-shirt?

642
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:13,865
Yes, of course.

643
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:16,034
Did you produce it?

644
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:19,120
No, I thought Rine
requested it to be made.

645
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:41,893
Thank you for calling IamJamJam.

646
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:47,941
I even got a call that he wanted
the rabbits to wear those T-shirts.

647
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,193
Were there any other requests?

648
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:54,239
I was asked to put weird shapes
here and there on the rides.

649
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:56,491
I think he said it was a surprise event.

650
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,493
He said kids would love it.

651
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,787
He asked me earnestly
to keep it a secret.

652
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:03,331
Kids would love it?

653
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,752
Judging from the situation,
the culprit's an acquaintance.

654
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:12,215
Could I see the security camera footage
from the hallway?

655
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:15,802
The security camera in the hallway
has been out of order for a long time.

656
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,138
There's one outside the building.

657
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,107
<i>The manager said</i>

658
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:32,068
the cops took the security camera footage
near the hot-air balloon.

659
00:43:32,152 --> 00:43:34,195
But it's not in the investigation data.

660
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:36,823
What? There's no security camera footage?

661
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:37,741
Nope.

662
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:42,704
And no security cameras outside captured
the ice cream truck you mentioned.

663
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:49,169
For someone to completely erase
the traces like this,

664
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:52,589
could it be…

665
00:43:58,595 --> 00:44:00,347
Yi-rang left on her own?

666
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:03,475
The culprit was playing
a game with Yi-rang.

667
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:05,977
He used a trick to leave without a trace.

668
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:08,772
Anything else you've found?

669
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,857
The security camera footage is gone.

670
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:12,942
The security camera footage is gone?

671
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:16,404
I think the culprit had an inside man
within the police.

672
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:22,744
I'll report it to the chairman.
Don't tell anyone about it for now.

673
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:25,663
-But--
-You know what I mean, right?

674
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:30,335
Yes, sir.

675
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:35,131
3 DAYS SINCE THE INCIDENT

676
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:38,635
Go.

677
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:46,684
<i>Hide tight</i>

678
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:50,397
<i>I can see your hair</i>

679
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,526
<i>Hide tight</i>

680
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:57,404
<i>I can see your hair</i>

681
00:44:57,487 --> 00:45:00,115
I mean, is this really necessary?

682
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:06,996
<i>Hide tight, I can see your hair</i>

683
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:13,503
<i>Hide tight, I can see your hair</i>

684
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:17,674
<i>Hide tight, I can see your hair</i>

685
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:40,572
Found you.

686
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:56,296
I think we need to switch it
to an open investigation.

687
00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:09,976
Are you the one who showed him
the security camera footage?

688
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:12,604
What? No.

689
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:15,315
Chief, why would you say that?

690
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:17,609
I heard you've been meeting
with the bodyguard often.

691
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:20,069
What do you mean "meeting"?

692
00:46:20,153 --> 00:46:22,906
We're friends,
so we've only said hi a few times.

693
00:46:23,573 --> 00:46:24,407
Is that so?

694
00:46:24,491 --> 00:46:26,367
Chief, you need to see this.

695
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:27,952
<i>Breaking news.</i>

696
00:46:28,036 --> 00:46:31,706

<i>Investigating authorities revealed today</i>
<i>they will switch</i>

700
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,174
Goddamn it.

701
00:46:41,758 --> 00:46:44,219
Switching to an public investigation
without any word?

702
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,387
Are they serious right now?

703
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:48,765
<i>The decision by police</i>
<i>and investigating authorities…</i>

704
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:50,099

CONVENIENCE STORE

706
00:47:01,611 --> 00:47:05,073
This is the last road connected
to the outer roads around the theme park.

707
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:12,622
Then, there should've been
traces left behind.

708
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:17,835
Good day, ma'am.

709
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:19,796
I'm from the police.

710
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,047
Could I check your CCTV?

711
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,716
When are you going to stop bothering me?

712
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,885
So they've been here already.

713
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:27,345
I wonder who it was.

714
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:31,724
By any chance, does the one
who took the security footage look--

715
00:47:31,808 --> 00:47:34,269
A ton of people have come by here.

716
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,271
How am I supposed to remember all that?

717
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:39,023
Right?

718
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:41,276
Of course.

719
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,360
How much is this?

720
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:49,617
Going straight out from Any World…

721
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:55,999
How can I be eating bread right now?

722
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:01,629
Yi-rang must be suffering
so much right now.

723
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:05,466
GYEAN-DONG

724
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,390
WILD BIRDS IN THIS AREA

725
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:16,394
That could have caught something.

726
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:22,483
-Hello.
-Hello.

727
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:24,652
I'm from the police.

728
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:26,654
Could I see what was caught on camera?

729
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,949
It's migratory bird season,
so it's been here for days.

730
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:31,242
It could've caught something.

731
00:48:34,704 --> 00:48:35,788
{\an8}Can you go back?

732
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:37,957
Wait, stop.

733
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:39,792
One second.

734
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:43,755
<i>It's already been five days</i>

735
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:47,800
<i>since Chairman Yun Tae-ho's only daughter</i>
<i>was kidnapped.</i>

736
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:51,846
<i>However, the victim's whereabouts</i>
<i>are still unknown.</i>

737
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:03,983
It's me.

738
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:06,611
We're getting rid of the girl tonight.

739
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:13,576
Really?

740
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:16,204
Okay. See you soon.

741
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:23,753
Who was that call from?

742
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:27,590
It's my wife.

743
00:49:27,674 --> 00:49:30,259
My child must've gotten
into trouble again.

744
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:36,974
Did you get all the data?
The security camera footage and all?

745
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:39,560
Yes, I'm sure my guys got them.

746
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:41,729
I'll see you later then.

747
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:43,189
Right. Bye.

748
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:24,540
Don't be a hassle. Just eat it, okay?

749
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:28,085
How long do I have to do this for?

750
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:29,670
I'm so sick of it.

751
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:33,007
Hey, mister.

752
00:51:34,884 --> 00:51:37,178
I'm really bored too. Let's play cards.

753
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:50,566
I have something to report.

754
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:56,572
I won this time, right?

755
00:51:58,533 --> 00:51:59,534
It's flush for me.

756
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:01,661
Damn it.

757
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:03,579
Let's play one more time.

758
00:52:03,663 --> 00:52:05,289
Hey, you think you can win?

759
00:52:05,373 --> 00:52:06,499
She really is a genius.

760
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:08,251
Let's play one more time.

761
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:13,714
Sure. But if I win again,
we'll play the game I want.

762
00:52:17,093 --> 00:52:18,678
I got it this time.

763
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:20,137
It's full house.

764
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:29,397
Damn it!

765
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,065
Let's play the game I want now.

766
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:32,483
Hide-and-seek.

767
00:52:32,567 --> 00:52:34,360
Count to 30 slowly.

768
00:52:34,443 --> 00:52:35,695
I'm going to hide.

769
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:42,910
One, two, three, four,

770
00:52:43,536 --> 00:52:47,707
five, six, seven, eight,

771
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:52,128
nine, ten, eleven, twelve,

772
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:57,049
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,

773
00:52:57,133 --> 00:52:59,552
seventeen, eighteen…

774
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:15,151
Here I come.

775
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:24,994
<i>Hide tight, I can see your hair</i>

776
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:31,208
<i>Hide tight, I can see your hair</i>

777
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:36,380
<i>Hide tight, I can see your hair</i>

778
00:53:37,757 --> 00:53:43,346
<i>Hide tight, I can see your hair</i>

779
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:48,893
<i>Hide tight, I can see your hair</i>

780
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:10,623
POTASSIUM IODIDE

781
00:54:17,046 --> 00:54:17,964
Found you.

782
00:54:25,388 --> 00:54:26,681
Where's the kid?

783
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:27,598
Inside.

784
00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:29,433
We're wrapping things up here tonight.

785
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:03,884
Five, four,

786
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:08,973
three, two, one.

787
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:31,954
<i>Hurry and check the kid's room!</i>

788
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:52,475
Yi-rang.

789
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:56,395
Damn it.

790
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:24,298
<i>Hang in there. I'll save you soon.</i>

791
00:56:26,509 --> 00:56:29,345
<i>Just a bit more. I can go home now.</i>

792
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:55,913
James!

793
00:57:00,835 --> 00:57:01,794
Yi-rang, run!

794
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:09,677
Yi-rang!

795
00:57:55,723 --> 00:57:58,309
MYUNG GU-HO

DOUBLE ABDUCTION?

00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:27,630
<i>Hide tight</i>

800
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:32,593
<i>I can see your hair</i>

801
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,548
{\an8}<i>Thanks to everyone</i>

802
00:59:11,632 --> 00:59:13,550
{\an8}who supported Mystique…

803
00:59:13,634 --> 00:59:15,511
{\an8}<i>This is unfair!</i>

804
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:19,139
{\an8}<i>Gil Beauty is the queen of power trips</i>
<i>and the queen of lawsuits.</i>

805
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:20,766
{\an8}<i>Your appearance is also your talent.</i>

806
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:22,977
{\an8}<i>It's 32.57?</i>

807
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,186
{\an8}What a pig.

808
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:26,563
{\an8}Okay, the operation will begin.

809
00:59:27,273 --> 00:59:29,066
{\an8}<i>This was stuck deep inside.</i>

810
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:30,025
{\an8}Mom!

811
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:31,151
{\an8}Son.

812
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:36,740
{\an8}<i>We'll lure in Gil Beauty in a way</i>
<i>that is mysterious, secretive,</i>

813
00:59:36,824 --> 00:59:39,159
{\an8}<i>and thus more attractive.</i>
