00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:57,037
Then let us reveal.

172
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,416
[music intensifies, fades]

173
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,754
White!

174
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,172
[all exclaiming]

175
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:08,382
White!

176
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,758
[cheering]

177
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,146
White or red?

178
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,607
Which one will you
place your bets on?

179
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,735
-[gambler 1] That's enough.
-[gambler 2] Wait, wait!

180
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:28,777
[gambler 1] Go red!

181
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,060
-[gambler 2] Oh my God!
-Red.

182
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,033
Red!

183
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:36,243
-That's right!
-Yeah!

184
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,577
[Gu-ho] Red!

185
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,204
[exclaims]

186
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,416
-[James] White!
-Bang!

187
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:43,583
[Gu-ho] White!

188
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,420
Red!

189
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:50,382
Wow, look at that. We're
rich now. [exclaims]

190
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:51,967
2 WEEKS AGO

191
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:56,096
[Baek-hwa] I see how someone
with a stature such as yourself

192
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,806
enjoys spending
their leisure time.

193
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:01,056
-[Baek-hwa chuckles softly]
-[Gu-ho clears throat]

194
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,187
Here's something we
thought you'd like.

195
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,899
-[Gu-ho] Call it a gesture of goodwill.
-Aw, you shouldn't have.

196
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,442
[dealer chuckles]

197
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:13,113
-Would you look at that? It's precious.
-That's just a tip.

198
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,186
[Baek-hwa] Here's the real gift.

199
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,744
[James] And what is this?

200
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,204
[enthralling music playing]

201
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:24,875
The great Gwiyisu of Paldalsan
deserves more respect.

202
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,795
You were the man able to call
the shots everywhere you'd go.

203
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:30,881
I want this for you.

204
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,383
Let's clean out your dumb
boss, get you back on top.

205
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,260
Let's make our own thing.

206
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:36,762
[music intensifies]

207
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,100
[James] White and
red sound different.

208
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:43,809
Red.

209
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,522
-Red!
-[all cheering]

210
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:49,649
Red! Red!

211
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,318
[exclaims]

212
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,195
Well, I think that's
enough for today.

213
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,367
All right now, come
on. Don't be silly.

214
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,285
Let me keep going here.

215
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:04,081
And that is the reason gambling's so hard.
Knowing when to quit when you're ahead.

216
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,624
Why do you want to stop now?

217
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,627
Ah!

218
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,171
You got no more cash
in reserve, do you?

219
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,173
Is that it? Huh?

220
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,676
-Is she outta cash?
-Seriously?

221
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,011
-What?
-Is she outta money?

222
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:19,471
Oh my God. How'd that happen?

223
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:20,889
-This is insane.
-What is she doing?

224
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:21,973
What the heck?

225
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,311
I guess she's not outta cash.

226
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:28,271
If you've got
eyeballs that work,

227
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,898
then look here.

228
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,067
We always have
more than we need.

229
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,236
Our reserve is
around three billion.

230
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,071
[laughs]

231
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,448
All right, well, that
was uncalled for.

232
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,868
Sorry about that.
I do apologize.

233
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,203
Okay, now.

234
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:46,248
I'm gonna play one
more final round.

235
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:48,792
All in.

236
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,377
[gambler] Whoa.

237
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,382
Ma'am, if you raise the stakes,
the remaining players...

238
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,176
Is the young, rich boss
about to get in here? Hmm?

239
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,846
Last round. Come
on. Let's do this!

240
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,931
[suspenseful music intensifies]

241
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,726
[music fades]

242
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,107
[Yi-rang] In that case,

243
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,652
I'll have a new dealer step in.

244
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,997
[intense music playing]

245
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:42,012
This is so crazy.

246
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:44,514
[Gu-ho sighs softly]

247
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:51,187
Now.

248
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,732
Let's roll the dice,
and see what we get.

249
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,737
[instrumental music intensifies]

250
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,617
[dice rattling]

251
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,331
White

252
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,208
or red?

253
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,253
Will you choose the moon,

254
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,798
or will you instead
choose the sun?

255
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,759
[suspenseful music playing]

256
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,303
Red?

257
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:24,971
It's not red. No, no. It's not.

258
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,610
Red.

259
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,445
-Red.
-Red. It's red.

260
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:41,529
-Red.
-Red.

261
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:42,988
Red.

262
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,159
Then I'm white.

263
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,707
[crowd gasping]

264
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:53,791
[indistinct chattering]

265
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:55,584
[sighs softly]

266
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,140
[Yi-rang] Shall we go
ahead and take a look?

267
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,925
Let's see who the
goddess of victory

268
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,135
decides to favor.

269
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:23,947
-[Baek-hwa gasps]
-[Gu-ho] Red!

270
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,783
-[Gu-ho] Red! [exclaims]
-[Baek-hwa cheers]

271
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,826
[all whooping]

272
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,119
[gamblers exclaiming]

273
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,663
-[gambler 1] Nice!
-This can't be happening.

274
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:33,999
[breathing heavily]

275
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,501
[Gu-ho] It's two
billion. Get it all in.

276
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,380
[Yi-rang] This is wrong!

277
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,007
It doesn't count. It's my money.

278
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,884
-[Yi-rang] Give it back!
-[Baek-hwa] You let go!

279
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,053
There's no way I'd lose this game.
Give it back. This is invalid!

280
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,888
You running a scam?
What are you doing?

281
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:51,891
You're the one who told us
that the odds were 50-50!

282
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,352
[Yi-rang straining]
Let go. Let go!

283
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:55,520
-[both grunting]
-[crowd gasping]

284
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,442
-Don't you touch that, you prick!
-[Gu-ho grunts]

285
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,735
Oh, I won this!

286
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,362
[Yi-rang exclaims, groans]

287
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:09,618
[Gu-ho] You got it? [grunts]

288
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,703
[intense music playing]

289
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,048
[swishes]

290
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:39,230
[sword swishes, zings]

291
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,248
The money stays here.

292
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,293
Leave the money and
I'll let you live.

293
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:03,463
[intense music playing]

294
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:06,924
[chuckles softly]

295
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:10,387
You really believe it's
that easy to kill someone?

296
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:11,887
What?

297
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,599
You don't think I can do it?

298
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,101
Okay.

299
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,729
Then let's see it.
Kill me. Come on.

300
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,065
[chuckles softly]

301
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,566
Do it if you're gonna do it.

302
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,155
[sword zings]

303
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,243
-It's the police!
-[all gasping]

304
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,161
[guard] The police are
here! Everyone out!

305
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:36,913
Run!

306
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,873
-[guard] Hurry! Get out! Go!
-[all clamoring]

307
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,212
Freeze where you are!

308
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,841
Well, well, well. It's
been a while, Kim Mi-yeong.

309
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,801
What's with the
sword? It's dangerous.

310
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,301
Ah...

311
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,347
Are you performing
shows at the casino now?

312
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,975
You sure are a busy lady.

313
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,561
[chuckles]

314
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,770
Ah.

315
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,565
Is this about that bag?

316
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:07,152
-Give it to me.
-What? Oh, the bag.

317
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:11,364
Baek-hwa, hurry. Do it, do
it. Here. Give it to him.

318
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,325
Hey, no stop! What're you
doing? That bag's mine.

319
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:15,952
Kim Mi-yeong.

320
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,497
You're under arrest for operating
an illegal gambling den,

321
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:22,333
and for the attempted murder
of Pak Tae-chun as well.

322
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:25,128
I need you to put
the sword down. Yeah?

323
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,589
How is spending your own money
in your own place illegal?

324
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:31,009
And what attempted murder? Are you
outta your mind? [chuckles softly]

325
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:34,137
And the rest of you, don't
you even think about leaving.

326
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,347
You all came here to
gamble, did you not?

327
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,016
So don't you act
all innocent now.

328
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,268
No one's getting out of
here. Not one person!

329
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,770
She's lost it.

330
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:43,688
-Get her!
-Not today!

331
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,316
[grunting]

332
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,777
-[James] Drop it!
-[Yi-rang] No one's leaving.

333
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:50,904
[Yi-rang] Where're you going?

334
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,347
-[Yi-rang grunts]
-[Gu-ho groans]

335
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,457
Deok-pil.

336
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,460
-Deok-pil. [panting]
-[weakly] Baek-hwa, get outta here.

337
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,087
-Are you okay?
-[Gu-ho] You need to run. Hurry.

338
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,505
[Baek-Hwa] Come with me.

339
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,381
[Gu-ho] Don't worry about me.

340
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,217
Promise you'll live a good life.

341
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,094
Now go! Go! Run! Get out!

342
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:16,888
I said get outta here!

343
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,057
My love!

344
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,309

348
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:37,158
God, I really thought
I was gonna die.

349
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,285
That ruthless slut.

350
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:40,787
My love!

351
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,122
I love you!

352
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,961
That kid's like obsessed with me or
something. It's a little embarrassing.

353
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:50,630
I can't help it, though.

354
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:52,757
That's the way it goes.

355
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,719
I guess if it's a crime
to be this beautiful,

356
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,013
then I should go to
prison. [chuckles softly]

357
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:01,891
[sirens wailing in distance]

358
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:18,950
Cut.

359
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,035
[quirky music playing]

360
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,623
Are you gonna lie there all day?

361
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,919
[straining] Dang it.
[sighs in relief]

362
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:32,589
Wearing this disguise
was overkill. Jeez.

363
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,924
[groaning in pain]
Ouch, that hurts.

364
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,053
Ow, that stings!

365
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,102
[both laughing]

366
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,531
Oh, God, this one was
freaking hilarious.

367
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:01,117
-[continues laughing]
-[Gu-ho] Why are you laughing? Quit it.

368
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,119
-That's enough.
-Hey. [chuckling]

369
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,454
Seriously? "My love"?

370
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:06,915

372
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:13,046
I love you!

373
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,381
-[Yi-rang chuckling]
-Hey, that was in the script.

374
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,759
Honestly, I almost
got up because of you.

375
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,095
-[James laughing]
-I was sticking to the script. Shut up!

376
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:22,972
-Gosh. Stop laughing!
-Hey, maybe he actually meant it.

377
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,349
All right, all right.

378
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,726
Hey, great work, everybody!

379
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,811
-Good work!
-[all cheering]

380
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,649
Good work! Nice job!

381
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:35,693
My money.

382
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,153
[groans]

383
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,159
Two billion.

384
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,083
The money...

385
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,462
What is this?

386
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:57,340
My two billion. Two
billion. Where's the money?

387
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:13,731
[angrily] Kim

394
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,265
I cannot believe you did that.

395
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:48,683
You had to switch the dealer?

396
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:51,019
-Did that make sense to you, James?
-[James chuckles]

397
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:53,521
It's always more fun if
you improvise a little.

398
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:55,231
That's the best part
of a plan, I think.

399
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,775
Yeah, improvising is
okay, but that was a lot.

400
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,403
It threw me when you
came in like that.

401
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:01,779
That's my point.

402
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:04,323
[Yi-rang] Okay, but that look
on your face was pretty good.

403
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:07,618
Wait, were you actually
swooning over me?

404
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:11,497
-No, I was not swooning. Okay?
-[Yi-rang giggles]

405
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:13,416
-I wasn't.
-Never mind then.

Mmm.

410
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,574
It's robust, yet not overwhelming,
with a delicate nose,

411
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,202
and I feel like I'm detecting
a subtle wisp of smoke.

412
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,705
I'd have to say, the best
white wine is Montrachet.

413
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:54,791
[James] Montrachet
goes down very smooth.

414
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,417
So, this time it'll be France?

415
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:59,462
You know, just last week,

416
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:02,799
I went shopping in Paris, and I
bought a winery while I was there.

417
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,593
Oh, I'm not surprised that you would
go global with your investments.

418
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:06,676
[chuckles]

419
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:09,430
So, how's the laundry
bill looking this time?

420
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:10,389
Well, it's not bad.

421
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:12,016
The cost of production dropped,

422
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,144
thanks to Mr. Mustache pulling in
that casino set from his film days.

423
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:18,189
Oh, that's so great!
Amazing! [chuckles excitedly]

424
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,025
We should go somewhere
to celebrate all this.

425
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:22,193
Yeah, just the three
of us, like old times.

426
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:25,029
How about Waikiki
and we go skydiving?

427
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:27,406
How'd you know that's
on my bucket list?

428
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,075
You always wanted
to skydive there?

429
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,952
Well, we really do need to go.

430
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,788
I've actually always dreamed
of going to Waikiki to surf,

431
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,457
-but this way we can do them both.
-[excitingly] Yeah, yeah!

432
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,421
-[Yi-rang] Let's go! [chuckles]
-Let's get it!

433
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,629
[Yi-rang giggles] Gu-ho,
you're coming, right?

434
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:44,423
Nah, I'll sit this one out.

435
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:47,301
-Hey, it's no fun without you, man.
-[Yi-rang] Why?

436
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:49,012
I just don't think this
line of work suits me.

437
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,721
I think that I'm done with it.

438
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:52,222
I'm out.

439
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:53,432
Ah, jeez.

440
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:56,116
-What, what are you even saying?
-[Gu-ho] I can't do it anymore.

441
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:57,352
Gu-ho.

442
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,814
Did you forget what we promised?

443
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:01,774
The ten billion?

444
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,110
We've done more
than that by now.

445
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,361
-We have?
-Mmm-hmm.

446
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:06,862
Uh, what about...

447
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:10,241
[chuckles] this one you do
'cause of your loyalty? Hmm?

448
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:13,452
'Cause I got some dirty laundry that
will require some extra cleaning.

449
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:15,163
The kind that only
you can handle.

450
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:17,331
Huh? Just stay.

00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:18,416

452
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:20,710
Hmm? Come on,
please? Just say yes.

453
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:21,793
Hmm?

454
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:23,254
-Huh?
-Hey, uh...

455
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,131
I really gotta go. Yeah?

456
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:26,716
-Don't try to call me.
-What...

457
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,676
-Guys, take care.
-Oh, you're going?

458
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:29,759
Are you leaving?

459
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:31,637
Without your cut?

460
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,766
Donate the rest of it.

461
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,310
Really? Nice guy.

462
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:38,352
[in unison] Split it?

463
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:40,438
[both laughing]

464
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:41,521
Split it?

465
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:46,235
Seriously? You're not gonna,
like, say goodbye, or take care?

466
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,946
Would it kill you to
say something like that?

467
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:49,864
-Okay. Bye.
-Take care.

468
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:51,323
Just forget it.

469
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:55,870
I'd bet my left arm
that he'll come back.

470
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:58,122
-I'd bet my feet.
-Oh yeah.

Hey, you guys, stay here.

516
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,084
-Okay?
-Okay.

517
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:08,044
-Okay.
-Okay.

518
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,337
[quirky music playing]

519
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,464
[Yi-rang] Ugh, I can't breathe.

520
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:14,216
[Yi-rang groaning]

521
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,509
Hey. Are you okay?

522
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:18,387
[Yi-rang straining]
What the heck?

523
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:19,597
[Gu-ho] Excuse me?

524
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:23,351
[Yi-rang] Hey.

525
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:24,560
[chuckles excitedly]

526
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:27,605
I missed you!

527
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:28,688

-[Gu-ho screams]
-[Yi-rang shrieking]

529
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,406
Yun Yi-rang.

530
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,575
-What are you doing here?
-[Yi-rang giggling]

531

533
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:47,416
What are you doing
here? Seriously!

534
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,293
[both exclaiming]

535
00:27:58,928 --> 00:27:59,928
[Yi-rang] Huh?

536
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:03,272
-[Yi-rang chuckles softly]
-[Gu-ho] Yi-rang.

537
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:06,769
Every time you decide to show up,
all peace goes out the window.

538
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,979
-Just like today.
-Think about it this way.

539
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:13,109
A really, really, really
quiet Indie film meets me,

540
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,652
and then before you know it,

541
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,862
it has turned into a
huge summer success.

542
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:18,781
A blockbuster smash hit.

543
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,659
Just like the day we
first met each other.

544
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,122
[pensive music playing]

545
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,391
[gasps softly] Look,
a shooting star!

546
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:49,478
I'm sure you see them every night.
How many have you seen from here?

547
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:53,899
If the sky is really nice and clear,
you can easily see 12 or so in a night.

548
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:55,943
-Twelve? Really?
-Yeah.

549
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,111
[gasps softly]

550
00:28:57,486 --> 00:29:01,699
Oh, that's 12 wishes that
could come true every day.

551
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,034
I love it here.

552
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:06,035
[chuckles softly]

553
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:08,122
Here.

554
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:11,417
[exclaiming] Thank
you! It's great!

555
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,586
I caught these today myself.

556
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:16,422
Here. They're fresh
wild abalones,

557
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:19,341
they should be fancy enough
for your delicate palate.

558
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:21,552
[gasps]

559
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:25,598
This is crazy delicious. It's not
just fancy. This is magnificent.

560
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,518
Mmm! It's chewy and...
Oh, yummy, yummy!

561
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:31,187
-Yum!
-[Gu-ho chuckles]

562
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:36,816
It's annoying.

563
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:39,862
What? What's wrong?

564
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,823
I mean, this whole time I was
thinking you were struggling,

565
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:44,867
living a pitiful life somewhere.

566
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:47,286
But you're breathing fresh
air, eating fresh food.

567
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:50,498
You don't think about me at
all, do you? It looks so nice.

568
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:55,085
-You were worried about me.
-[Yi-rang scoffs]

569
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:58,255
Oh, you know that I don't
worry about anything.

570
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:03,010
Right, I forgot, those emotions don't
belong to someone born a sociopath.

571
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:05,721
-Gu-ho.
-Hmm?

572
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:08,682
I'm not a sociopath, okay?

573
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,144
Sorry, I, um...

574
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:14,438
I was just joking.
That was a joke.

575
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:15,522
Okay?

576
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:17,149
The, uh...

577
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:19,652
The correct word is genius
sociopath, all right?

578
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:22,571
So will you call me a genio-path?
I'm your genio-path, yeah?

579
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:24,323
-[Yi-rang laughs]
-Yeah. Oh my God.

580
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,367
I never stood a chance
against a genio-path.

581
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,743
Just eat this, all right?

582
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:29,745
-Goodness.
-Mmm!

583
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,748
Mmm! This is cooked
perfectly. Mmm!

584
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,916

586
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:37,628
He's calling late.

587
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:41,881
James? Hello?

588
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:43,509
Hmm?

589
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,134
Hmm?

590
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,179
What?

591
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,933
What? What'd he say?

592
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,560
[rapid footsteps approaching]

593
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:53,852
There.

594
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:55,938
[both panting]

[machine beeping]

596
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:03,279
[Yi-rang] It's all your fault.

597
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:05,697
What?

598
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:08,074
Why?

599
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:09,952
What, um... What
happened, Yi-rang?

600
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:12,663
It was perfectly planned out.

601
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:15,207
What? What was planned out?

602
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,626
How did James end up
like this? What happened?

603
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:19,503
Huh?

604
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,088

608
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,808
He runs the Sand

What is absolutely imperative
for any relationship's success?

631
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,334
It's trust. I know it is.

632
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:42,586
Uh, sir, trust is
the most important.

633
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:44,546
I hear what you're saying,

We have an issue with the land
acquisition right now. Yeah.

Of course. We're family.

should help each other.

As family.

858
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,590
I do?

859
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:55,425
-Mmm-hmm. Don't you?
-No, I don't.

860
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:57,302
-You just can't pull it off, is all.
-I can't?

861
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:58,845
-Me?
-Yi-rang.

862
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:02,265
Honestly, you don't have what
it takes to do it. I'm sorry.

863
00:44:02,724 --> 00:44:06,603
[chuckles] Oh God, are you being serious?
I get my fortune read to me and...

864
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:09,773
I'm consistently getting nothing but
attractive and popularity energy.

865
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:14,235
-See, my best weapon is my beauty.
-[Gu-ho laughs]

866

[Gu-ho groans]

867
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,908
Tell me. Has it
ever worked for you?

868
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,494
Just look at the
way you blackmail.

869
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:25,789
You're always so over-the-top
enthusiastic, it's just overkill.

870
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:29,376
You make every romantic cell in a
guy's body shrivel up and disappear.

871
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:31,669
Do you remember that money
launderer a while ago?

872
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:34,422
The poor guy turned himself
in just to get away from you.

873
00:44:34,506 --> 00:44:36,841
And then what happens? We
won't only spend our money,

874
00:44:36,925 --> 00:44:39,636
-but we won't get his. After all that...
-I get it! Now, stop it!

875
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:43,598
I'll find some
other way to do it.

876
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,602
How could you be so cruel to me?

877
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:49,604
Seriously.

878
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,564
You got this.

879
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:52,774
-Get lost.
-I will.

880
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:54,983
You can do it!

881
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:56,945
Stupid idiot.

882
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:26,558
Did you give up on
the plan already?

883
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,643
I mapped it out, it's done.

884
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:29,806
You're just goofing around.

885
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:34,357
[scoffs] Well, we do get our
best ideas when we're having fun.

886
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:37,360
So, what did you come up with?

887
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:41,906
Well, the trap gets
set in such a way.

888
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:45,034
That even the Chairman
wouldn't be able to escape it.

889
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:49,581
We couldn't make it work
on the sea, so then,

890
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:52,167
we'll take it to...

891
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,252
[plane revving]

892
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:55,335
The sky.

[upbeat music playing]

894
00:46:10,894 --> 00:46:12,229
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome aboard.

896
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:15,440
Thank you for choosing
to fly with us today...

897
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:17,525
[speaking foreign language]

898
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:45,303
Some fruit for you.

899
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,514
May I offer you some
wine or anything else?

900
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:50,350
-No, I'm just fine.
-[Yi-rang] Very well, sir.

00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:57,273
-Mmm.
-Is there anything I can do for you?

903
00:46:57,357 --> 00:46:58,441
[laughs sarcastically]

904
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:01,945
You know, I'm sure you could have done
something better in life than this.

905
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:04,113
Sir, I'm sure that would
have been a waste of talent.

906
00:47:04,197 --> 00:47:05,197
Mmm-hmm.

907
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,832
[slurps]

908
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:17,836
-[screams] Oh, that's cold!
-What the...

909
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:19,295
-What is this?
-It's so cold!

910
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:21,714
[Gu-ho] Hey, don't you know
that I only drink water

911
00:47:21,798 --> 00:47:24,050
from Canadian glacier ice
from the North Atlantic?

912
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:26,803
Sir, I'm sorry, but we had
a delivery problem earlier.

913
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:27,762
[Gu-ho] Delivery problem?

914
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,723
All right, listen, it's
unacceptable that your problems

915
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:32,684
get in the way of the service
I should be receiving.

916
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:34,394
-[Yi-rang exhales]
-[Gu-ho] You know what?

917
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:37,689
Did you get hired by Choi? Should
I make sure both of you are fired?

918
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:39,274
No, I'm sorry. I'm
the only one at fault.

919
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:41,818
You got a lot of nerve
talking back to me, don't you?

920
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:43,570
-I could just...
-Keep it down.

921
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:45,197
It's not like you rented
out the entire plane.

922
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,657
[Gu-ho] Rented out the...
[laughs] What am I, poor?

923
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,285
Why on earth would I ever rent
a plane when I own this one?

924
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:51,995
You wanna get off?

925
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:55,123
[man] This is only gonna escalate
things. If you could please calm down...

926
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:57,125
[Gu-ho] Let go.

927
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,543
You people are all worthless.

928
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,962
Get me some freaking
water. Water. Now!

929
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:02,338
I was very clear.

930
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:04,591
And it needs to come from
Canadian glacier ice.

931
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:05,674
[Yi-rang] I'm sorry.

932
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:07,857
-I'm really sorry.
-[Gu-ho] From Canada!

933

[sighs]

934
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:35,163
Watch out, man.

935
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:36,748
What are you doing?
You little...

936
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:38,374
I'm so sorry. My apologies.

937
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:42,545
Gosh! Get my luggage. Let's go.

938
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:50,762
[Gu-ho] Are you kidding
me? What is this?

939
00:48:51,888 --> 00:48:54,932
[groans loudly] Oh my God.
You're driving me crazy.

940
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:56,059
What are you doing?

941
00:48:56,976 --> 00:48:58,102
That's not my bag!

942
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:01,022
Ah, seriously! This
is so ridiculous!

943
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:03,733
Why do you always have
to do everything wrong?

944
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:05,151
I can't believe you!

945
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:13,158
[purrs]

946
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:16,996
Where's the car? The car...

947
00:49:27,924 --> 00:49:30,468
-[Mr. Mule] I swear, I didn't touch it.
-What?

948
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:33,012
[trembling] I didn't
know that that money...

949
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:35,390
That that money was yours, sir.

950
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:37,183
I'm begging you, sir. Please.

951
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,812
I promise I'll work like a
dog from now on. Please, sir.

952
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:42,854
You still...

953
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:46,025
don't know your place.

954
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:47,484
Hmm.

955
00:49:48,361 --> 00:49:50,738
You've always been
nothing but a dog.

956
00:49:50,822 --> 00:49:53,616
-You've never been anything more.

[Mr. Mule whimpering]

958
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:07,505
You still owe me the
interest. And you'll pay it.

959
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,425
See what parts of him can
be sold. Dump all the rest.

960
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:11,592
[in unison] Yes, sir.

961
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:14,512
[sobbing] Sir, please
give me one more chance.

962
00:50:21,728 --> 00:50:23,020
That son of a bitch.

963
00:50:26,149 --> 00:50:27,650
What the hell is this?

964
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:36,367
[Gu-ho groans loudly] Oh my
God. You're driving me crazy.

965
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:38,327
That's not my bag!

966
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:39,851
<i>What're you gonna
do about my money?</i>

967
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,628
That's quite the coincidence.

[jazz music playing]

969
00:51:19,869 --> 00:51:22,455

relaxed, Ms. Flight Attendant?

[exclaiming]

971
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:27,043
What're you doing here?

972
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:29,003
It's surprising how
relaxed you are.

973
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:31,881
I got worried about you, I wanted
to see if you were all right.

974
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:34,091
Ah, 'cause of that guy?

975
00:51:35,343 --> 00:51:36,719
I'm sure the man is out there,

point, he likes to party.

[excitedly] Oh, wow! Oh,
thanks for bringing it!

979
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:53,945
I didn't know what to do because I
didn't have any way of contacting you.

know how to drink.

Why's life so difficult?

00:52:16,926 --> 00:52:19,595
You saw how I was treated
by that prick, didn't you?

988
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:21,806
Nobody should behave
that way to you.

989
00:52:22,515 --> 00:52:24,433
Thank you. I agree with you.

airline, his father does.

ever rent a plane when I own this one?

accident. A love child.

Oh, no!

Oh my goodness. No.
What am I saying?

Oh God. I'm sorry, uh...

00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:44,245
I totally, uh...

997
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:46,664
-I think we should forget what I told you.
-What?

I don't know what
you're talking about.

funny, aren't you?

is cute, right?

1002

Ugh, cute? You're insane. He's
a piece of shit, he really is.

Would you like...

1007

to go somewhere else?

1008
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:19,155
Round two?

Hello.

Oh, it's the young master
himself. [chuckles]

You seem really happy now.

We got one, high as
a kite, right here.

1028
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:45,324
And the other one
there, drunk as a skunk.

1029
00:54:45,992 --> 00:54:47,868
What a fantastic couple. Hmm?

1030
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,787
-You're an idiot!
-Yeah?

1031
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:51,622
-Do you wanna die?
-Die?

1032
00:54:51,706 --> 00:54:52,748
[laughs mischievously]

1033
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:54,792
[Tae-su] Wake up, young master.

1034
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:55,918
Time to get up.

1035
00:54:56,002 --> 00:54:57,003
-Hey.
-[Gu-ho groans]

1036
00:54:57,545 --> 00:54:58,587
Let go of me!

1037
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:01,214
[sighs in exasperation]

1038
00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:03,133
Shit.

1039
00:55:05,094 --> 00:55:06,095
Who are you?

1040
00:55:07,096 --> 00:55:07,930
Huh?

1041
00:55:08,014 --> 00:55:10,933
Hey. Put the bottle down
and fight like a man.

1042
00:55:11,017 --> 00:55:12,393
[scoffs] Not like a wuss.

1043
00:55:13,394 --> 00:55:14,394
Fine.

1044
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,646
Hey.

1045
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:16,564
Hey.

1046
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:19,650
I was a boxer. Let's
go. Huh. [exclaims]

1047
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:20,860
-[Gu-ho yells]
-You wanna fight?

1048
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:24,238
Yeah! [groaning]

1049
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:26,073
[both grunting]

1050
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:28,409
-[Gu-ho laughs]
-[Tae-su] You like that?

1051
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,831
[Gu-ho groaning]

1052
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:37,667
[thuds]

1053
00:55:42,131 --> 00:55:44,008
You can spend all this
money on gambling,

1054
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:46,427
or you can spend it on drugs.
It doesn't matter to me.

1055
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:48,220
What I wanna know...

1056
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:53,142
is how you two could smuggle
the money in with no issues.

1057
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:55,269
It was my first time doing it.

1058
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,604
You gotta believe me.

1059
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,523
Are you just trying to
get yourself outta this?

1060
00:55:58,606 --> 00:56:00,858
This is something I decided to
try this one time, you know?

1061
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:02,402
-It's not like I'm an expert...
-[man] Sir.

1062
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:03,765
You need to take a look at this.

1063
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:05,613
I've got a video clip here.

1064
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:07,490
It's Rising
Airlines' love child.

1065
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:11,118
Is that me on the video? Or...

1066
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:15,206
{\an8}RISING AIRLINES' LOVE CHILD

1067
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:23,380
Check his left arm out.

1068
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,382
Huh?

1069
00:56:27,343 --> 00:56:28,344
[Tae-su chuckles]

1070
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:33,432
[intense music playing]

1071
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:36,227
-[Tae-su groans]
-[Gu-ho] A gun? What for?

1072
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:38,661
-[Tae-su] Stand up.
-[Gu-ho whimpering]

1073
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:43,233
Ah.

1074
00:56:43,776 --> 00:56:45,528
Ah...

1075
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:46,903
[Gu-ho muffled groans]

1076
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:51,616
Who the hell are you?

1077
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:59,041
[laughing hysterically]

1078
00:57:05,548 --> 00:57:07,550

SAKWANG REAL ESTATE

1082
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:29,155
How can I help you?

1083
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,366
Well, I...

1084
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,201
I put the restaurant
up for sale.

1085
00:57:35,995 --> 00:57:36,995
[Ye-sol sighs]

1086
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:42,960
[Yi-rang] Jeong Ye-sol.

1087
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:48,132
How do you know my name?

1088
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:50,232
Aren't you popular
in this neighborhood?

1089
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,262
Here. This is for your mom.

1090
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:55,681
And just so you know,

1091
00:57:56,265 --> 00:57:59,393
you keep faking that cough and
you could get a real infection.

1092
00:57:59,852 --> 00:58:01,270
[somber music playing]

1093
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:04,023
You've done well in the past, and
you continue to do quite well.

1094
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,442
Trust yourself,
you'd be surprised.

1095
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:09,403
No more fortune tellers
for your mom, by the way.

1096
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,114
Okay. I'm sorry.

1097
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:15,492
Don't need to say sorry to me.

1098
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:17,118
Take care.

1099
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,705
[plastic rustling]

1100
00:58:23,209 --> 00:58:24,210
What is this money?

1101

["Got Me Good" by
An Shin-ae playing]

1102
00:58:28,172 --> 00:58:29,812
[Yi-rang] Let's call
it the laundry bill.

1103
00:58:31,467 --> 00:58:32,827
You gotta pay to
get things clean.

move the timeline up.</i>

1106

{\an8}[Mr. Ray-bang] <i>What do you
want me to do about the two?</i>

1107
