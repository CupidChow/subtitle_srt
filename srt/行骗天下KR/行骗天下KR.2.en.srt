00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:38,996
WELCOME GU-HO'S INN

178
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,748
Are you the one who
made the reservations?

179
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,790
-I made them, yeah.
-Great. Hello.

There are great
deals in this area.

183
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,354
-Is that all?
-[woman] Was if far?

184
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,064
It's just around the
corner. Go straight...

185
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:07,441
-It feels familiar here.
-[woman] 700.

186
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,527
[Yi-rang] It's peaceful,
simple, and so quiet.

187
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,280
[chuckles] You were
just like that guy.

188
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,824
[chuckles softly] I
was like him, wasn't I?

189
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:20,746
[yawns] Things aren't the
same as they used to be, huh?

190
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,915
We should go back there one day.

191
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:27,419
Are you sleeping?

192
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,882
You started this conversation.

193
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,805
[suspenseful music playing]

194
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,818

[ominous music playing]

196
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:08,876
Huh?

197
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,519
He's still knocked out.

198
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,816
I told you to go easy on
him. We're short on time.

199
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,820
-[man] Sorry, boss.
-Where's the girl? Let's get her.

200
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,324
[door shuts close]

202
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:46,414

203
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,375
[exhales deeply]

204
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,792

205
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,339
Oh, shit.

[groaned yawn]

208
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,647
Oh, God! You scared me.

209
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:53,565
Who are you?

210
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,151
Who do you think? I'm the
one who kidnapped you.

211
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,610
Kidnapped?

212
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,529
-You know Jeon Tae-su?
-Yeah.

213
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:00,489
Uh... no.

214
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:04,659
I used to work with him back in the day,
but there was a small misunderstanding.

215
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,286
So unfortunately, he...

216
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,289
had all of my internal
organs rearranged.

217
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:11,541
See, I'm not the kind of guy who

218
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:15,003
can sleep at night when I owe
others, so I plan to pay him back.

219
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,300
Is this your bag right here?

220
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:25,430
[scoffs softly] He's still
using the same old tricks.

221
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:29,017
If you'd shown up at the
drop point with this package,

222
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,394
the cops would've nabbed
you and tossed you

223
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,230
in some filthy cell for days.

224
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,190
That's his way of
testing loyalty, see?

225
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,192
Making sure you
won't rat him out.

226
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:40,820
[chuckles nervously] I... I
don't know why that's in my bag.

227
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:44,783
I have nothing to do with any of
this. You have to believe me, sir.

228
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,034
Look, lady...

229
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,036
Drop the lousy act.

230
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:51,790
I'm taking this to the
Narcotics Division in Korea,

231
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:55,168
and I'm gonna need you to
be a witness and testify.

232
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,256
[adrenaline-fueled
music playing]

233
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,139
Shit.

234
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,016
I have to get out of here.

235
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,894
Yi-rang, hang in there.

236
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,438
I'll go and get the cops.

237
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,817
Bastards. [grunts]

238
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:33,832
Oh.

239
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,256
[chuckles excitedly]

240
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,740
-Look at that.
-[music stops abruptly]

241
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,264
Hey, where are you going?

242
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:52,684
[chuckles nervously]

243
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,936
Uh, how's it going, guys?

244
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:56,688
Don't come this way.

245
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,815
-Stop! Hold on. Stop right there!
-What is this idiot doing?

246
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,818
[groans] Uh, excuse me.

247
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,112
-You're not getting out of here.
-Hey, wait. Don't!

248
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,740
[Gu-ho screams]

249
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,742
[breath trembling] Gu... Gu-ho.

250
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:12,078
Oh, I know. I get it. Chairman Jeon
told you to keep your mouth shut, right?

251
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:13,747
But guess what?

252
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,791
You know what happens when you
fail to carry out his orders?

253
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,297
[whispers] He tried to
escape. He's secured now.

254
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,381
[Mr. Mule] Ah, really?

255
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:28,136
[Gu-ho screams] Wait! Please,
just wait! Hold up, please!

256
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,971
Just hold on! [screams]

257
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,315
Oh, shit! I... Uh...

258
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,192
[Mr. Mule] Horrible, right?

259
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,236
The young man you came with,
he tried something cute.

260
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,446
Awful, right?

261
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:52,035
But even if you two make it out of here,
the Chairman's still going to kill you.

262
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,537
So? Feeling a bit
more cooperative now?

263
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:58,249
Or do you want your friend to wear mittens
for the rest of his miserable life?

264
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,130
[breathes heavily]

265
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,132
[soft music playing]

266
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,720
Please have mercy.

267
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,348
-What?
-Not on me...

268
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,644
on my friend.

269
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,313
Take his ring finger

270
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:21,940
-instead of the middle one.
-[music scribbles]

271
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,859
-[comical music playing]
-At the very least, let him earn a living.

272
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:26,361
Please.

273
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,029
I'm begging you, please.

274
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,287
[Gu-ho shudders]

275
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,502
[heavy panting]

276
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,838
The lady next door asked me
to chop your ring finger off

277
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,001
instead of your middle one.

278
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:48,842
Why? Why?

279
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,011
[Mr. Mule] But I'm only
going to cut your pinky.

280
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,179
Stay still. Don't move
or you'll lose your hand.

281
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,306
-[breathing raggedly]
-Clench your teeth.

282
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,725
It's going to hurt a bit.

283
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,435
[shuddering]

284
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,650

[yelps]

286
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,904
The fuck was that shit?

287
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,531
Don't move your
hand. Stay still.

288
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,286
-I'll cut her finger instead.
-No, wait!

289
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,540
I'll do it. I'll do it.

290
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,500
Keep your finger straight.

291
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,545
Put it here. I'll
just cut a piece.

292
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:28,298
-That's all I'll cut. Just here.
-[breathing heavily]

293

What the fuck is going on?

297
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:00,914
[bodyguard] Good job.

298
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:08,378

00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:17,554
Ah!

[grunts softly]

301
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:23,477
My finger.

302
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,815
I still have it. It's here.

303
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:30,652
Are you okay?

304
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,779
Chairman Jeon?

Come here, boy, come here.

-Chairman Jeon.
-[chuckles]

[relaxing music playing]

312
00:18:58,555 --> 00:18:59,556
[Yi-rang] Cheers!

313
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:04,936
[scoffs] You're really in
the mood for this right now?

314
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,105
Do you have any idea
what I went through?

315
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:09,524
And you told him to
take my ring finger?

316
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:10,859
Seriously Yi-rang?

317
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:12,777
[sighs]

318
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:16,865
Gu-ho, why do you always only
see one side of the story?

319
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:18,658
That's not true. I look
at things from all angles.

320
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,618
The man who kidnapped us.

321
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,664
He said so himself, he went through
exactly the same thing as us.

322
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,250
But he had all five
fingers on his hand.

323
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,295
He was just bluffing about the
whole chopping fingers off.

324
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,171
-[scoffs]
-It was all a set-up.

325
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:35,717
I bet you. Jeon Tae-su
heard every word we said.

326
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,345
[Mr. Mule scoffs softly] He's
still using the same old tricks.

[scoffs]

328
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:46,394
Anyway, thanks to your
heartfelt performance today,

329
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:49,272
I'm pretty sure Jeon
Tae-su's fully convinced now.

330
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,524
[chuckles] Lucky day for us.

331
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:55,737
I'm being completely
serious right now.

332
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,574
I think Jeon Tae-su cares
more than you, Yi-rang. Hmm?

333
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,827
Well, he hugged me, okay?

334
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:05,413
He comforted me. Huh? What else?

335
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:07,165
-Gu-ho.
-What?

336
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:09,042
Have you forgotten about James?

[heart monitor beeping]

Are you some kind of traitor?

Jeon Tae-su, that psycho.

340
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,262
-That's right.
-[sighs]

341
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:27,226
[sighs in satisfaction]

342
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,313
When is Jeon Tae-su
going to reach out?

343
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,607
[Gu-ho groans] That
son of a bitch.

344
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:35,818
Just wait until he calls me.

345
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,530
[ominous music playing]

346
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,909

00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,971
THIS IS TO NOTIFY YOU THAT A
TAX AUDIT WILL BE CONDUCTED

350
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,892
-[sighs]
-With this much evidence,

351
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,978
we could be looking at a
search warrant within a month.

352
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,771
I need to move the timeline up.

353
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:13,523
I'll keep that in mind.

354
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:16,067
What do you want me
to do about the two?

355
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,443
Should I keep digging?

356
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,369
No, don't.

357
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,496
There's no need for that.

358
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:35,253
Oh, my God. How
much is all this?

359
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:38,047
Fifty billion won.

360
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,427
[Gu-ho] Fifty billion
won? [clears throat]

361
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:49,392
It needs to be transferred to my
summer house in Manila by next Friday.

362
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,356
The amount's way bigger than we expected,
so our current methods just won't cut it.

363
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,983
[scoffs] Is that a no?

364
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,445
Sir, with such a
large sum of money,

365
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:04,157
wouldn't it be smarter to set up
a shell company in the Bahamas

366
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,600
-and route it there?
-[bangs table]

367
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,578
You think I didn't
look into that?

368
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:09,954
I'm sure you did, sir.

369
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,958
Quit running that useless brain of yours
in circles and figure something out.

370
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,044
This is why you're still alive.

371
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:21,966
Well, there is one way, sir.

372
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,594
Hmm. Okay. Okay. And that is?

373
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:29,140
To speed up boarding during peak
season, they opened a new lane

374
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:32,643
that lets passengers skip removing
their laptops from their luggage.

375
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,313
We can bypass the X-ray machine

376
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:37,774
by covering our luggage
with a shielding device.

377
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:47,283
This device will absorb the
radiation and block the rays,

378
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,786
allowing it to get
past all of security.

379
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:53,581
[Tae-su] Hmm.

380
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:11,098
All right.

381
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,059
Shall we get started?

382
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:16,228
Yeah!

383
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,458
[suspenseful music playing]

384
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,211
[sniffing]

385
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:44,382
[guard dog barking]

386
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,092
[chuckles] Gosh.
What's wrong with him?

387
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,175
Huh?

388
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:49,804
Go away.

389
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,055
[dog barking]

390
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,932
Hey, get away from me. Come on.

391
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,809
-Go away. Huh? What?
-Sir, you need to come with us.

392
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,172
[Gu-ho] Where are you taking me?

393
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,521
Hey! Let me go!

394
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,022
-[grunts] Shit!
-Stop resisting.

395
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,358
What? Do you know
who I... Let me go!

396
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,901
I'm so sorry, sir.

397
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,778
What happened?

398
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,947
Why was the damn dog
all over that bag?

399
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,534
Because of a recent uptick
in cash smuggling incidents,

400
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,203
a cash-sniffing dog was
deployed starting yesterday.

401
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,914
I should've informed you about
this in advance. I'm sorry.

402
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:17,998
[sighs]

403
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,751
And what about the money?

404
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:22,295
Do you know how
much was in there?

405
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:25,047
That was one billion
won. One billion!

406
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,717
-The love child returned.
-Get him.

407
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:31,596
Hey... Ah! Ah!

408
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,889
Ouch. Hold on.

409
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:34,765
Where's my bag?

410
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:35,849
Huh?

411
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:40,688
Well, my father got me out...
I mean, he pulled some strings.

412
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,481
Regarding the money though...

413
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,609
-that needs to be investigated.
-[sighs]

414
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:53,659
If anything happens to my money,

415
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:56,329
I'll gut you and sell off
whatever's worth a damn...

416
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,873
-down to the bones.
-[gasps] What?

417
00:24:58,956 --> 00:24:59,956
Take them both.

418
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:05,504
[music intensifies]

419
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:07,924
Would you like a flyer?

420
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:08,925
[Yi-rang grunts]

421
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,676
[music fades]

422
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,679
[Yi-rang] Ouch.

423
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,097
[annoyed groan]

424
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:27,777
Sir, this is it!

425
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:29,445
[funky music playing]

426
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:35,034
All you need to do is focus
on your responsibilities.

427
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,579
Have you lost your mind?

428
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:42,041
Oh, sir, just think about it.
What does the Sand Foundation do?

429
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,379
Protect children, respond to
disasters, and fight poverty.

430
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:49,173
What are you trying
to pull here now? Huh?

431
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:50,716
Basically, um...

432
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:55,054
We promote the Sand Foundation's
spirit of giving on a global scale

433
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,597
through a massive
donation campaign!

434
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:59,433
Which means that we
charter a private flight

435
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:01,394
to send relief
supplies overseas.

436
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:03,646
[upbeat music playing]

437
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,526
FILL A RELIEF BOX SPREAD
WARMTH ACROSS THE WORLD

438
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:11,028
So, what's your point?

439
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:14,490
We'll pack it with clothes,
medicine, and other relief supplies.

440
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,784
If we split the cash
between those boxes,

441
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,869
no one's gonna suspect a thing?

442
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:20,454
-Oh, yeah!
-That's it!

443
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,833
Okay. Leave the chartered
plane to me, sir.

444
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,418
You know, I have my ways.

445
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:26,501
Yeah?

446
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,465
-[laughs heartily]
-[laughing]

447
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,514
Ms. Kim.

448
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,059
That's outstanding.

449
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:44,854
-Good job.
-[chuckles]

450
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:46,563
[all laughing]

451
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:52,111
Get it together!

452
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:56,991
What the hell?

453
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:57,908
[music ends]

454
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:58,992
Mmm.

455
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:00,703
My blood sugar's dropping.

456
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,998
[muffled] Jeon Tae-su
sure is intense, right?

457
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:07,126
He said he'd sell whatever's
worth anything down to the bones.

458
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,628
-My gosh.
-You did well out there, Gu-ho.

459
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:11,213
Eat as much as you want.

460
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,428
[playful music playing]

461
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:25,186
-[sniffs]
-Hey!

462
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:27,938
This exquisitely, pungent
and funky cheese scent.

463
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:31,525
There's no way a dog
could resist that.

464
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:32,902
Your timing was impeccable.

465
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,779
-Go away. Huh? What?
-You need to come with us.

466
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,238
[Gu-ho] Are you serious? Really?

467
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:40,326
[Gu-ho] Why'd you go the hard way
and make things so complicated?

468
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,953
We could've just chartered a
plane right from the beginning.

469
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:44,246
[Yi-rang] Here's the thing.

470
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,874
I had to make it clear to Jeon
Tae-su that moving the money

471
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:49,543
the way we've been doing it
just wasn't an option anymore.

472
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:50,920
For that to happen,

473
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,713
he had to witness
you getting caught.

474
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:53,798
That's how it works.

475
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:58,886
Once suspicion dies down, trust
takes its place, of course.

476
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:01,806
If we'd mentioned the
chartered plane right away,

477
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,225
he would have never gone for it.

478
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,854
What? Did you fall for me again?

479
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,523
[chuckles] Oh my gosh.

480
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:12,149
Am I really that pretty?

481
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,484
Geez. [chuckles]

482
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:16,112
The shielding device you used
to get past the security...

483
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,656
-great stuff.
-Thank you.

484
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,741
Clever girl.

485
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:23,285
[scanner beeps]

486
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:28,582
Seriously, who would've thought that this
whole thing was planned from the start?

487
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:29,834
That's how people are.

488
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,670
They only believe what they
can see with their own eyes.

489
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:35,756
They have no clue how
tight aviation security is.

490
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,175
[scoffs] Gosh. Oh, Yi-rang...

491
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:42,930
Honestly, how do you keep coming
up with stuff like this? Huh?

492
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,432
You were born to do this.

493
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:46,976
It'd be a shame to let
this talent go to waste.

494
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:48,686
-Geez. [sighs]
-Gu-ho.

495
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:51,439
So what happens next?

496
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:53,023
[playful music playing]

497
00:28:57,862 --> 00:29:00,406
[Mr. Gwak] I just received word
that he'll be arriving soon.

498
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:04,660
Hey! Excuse me. Hey. Here.

499
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,537
Long time no see.

500
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:08,372
We're a little late...

501
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,376
-It's been a while, huh?
-[Mr. Gwak] Excuse me?

502
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,880
I was meant to meet you with the chairman,
but things have been hectic lately.

503
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,339
Sorry I didn't get in touch.

504
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,091
-[chuckles]
-[chuckles nervously] Yeah.

505
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:21,218
Um, so, how do we
know each other?

506
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:24,430
Don't be a stranger.
Come on. Card.

507
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:28,893
[scanner beeps]

508
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,020
Let's talk upstairs. Please.

509
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:34,732
-Thank you.
-Sure.

510
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:45,742
[Gu-ho sighs]

511
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,120
If things go according to plan,

512
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:52,166
the Sand Foundation will
fully back the funding.

513
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,044
Oh, of course. It's
for a good cause.

514
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,255
Naturally, we'll do
anything to support you.

515
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:58,547
If you need something else,

516
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:01,800
-besides the chartered flight, let us...
-Oh, and one more thing. Shh. Mmm.

517
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:06,597
No one outside of these four walls
must know about our meeting today.

518
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:10,100
Don't even tell the
chairman about this, okay?

519
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,773
You see, since we're a
charitable organization,

520
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:19,151
there's been quite a lot
of talk about our funding.

521
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:21,779
Ah...

522
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:24,031
I'll make sure to
keep that in mind.

523
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,992
-All right. I'll see you soon.
-Yes, sir.

524
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:31,454
Yeah.

525
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:34,375
Working out, huh?

526
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:35,960
-Goodbye.
-Okay. See you guys.

527
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:37,378
-Yes!
-Bye.

528
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,808
I just booked a chartered

530

Let's go.

531

Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

532
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,061
Hmm.

533
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,943
The trucks are entering
the premises. Yeah.

534
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,115
They've entered the premises.

535
00:31:56,624 --> 00:31:58,959
All right. Let's
get on the flight.

536
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,796
[Tae-su] And now, our great
journey finally begins.

537
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,382
-Sand Foundation, let's do this!
-Let's do this!

538
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,098
-[sighs] This is almost over.
-[Tae-su] I'd like to take a moment

539
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:13,641
to thank the volunteers
and supporters...

540
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:15,643
Anyway, why are the
supplies not here yet?

541
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:18,562
Just be patient. Luck's
always on my side.

542
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:20,006
[man] Can you make
a finger heart?

543
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:22,608

Thank you. Okay.

00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:29,114
-Sir.
-Yes.

547
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,825
We need to move. It's time.

548
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:33,451

-Close it out.
-Yes, sir.

552
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,424
We'll end the presentation here.

553
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:49,802
Our schedule requires
us to depart shortly.

554
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:50,886
Thank you very much.

555
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,430
[chuckles nervously] Sir.

556
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:00,688
-Let's get on that plane.
-Yes.

557
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,608
We should all stick around

558
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:06,235
and enjoy the finale.

559
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:08,611
[chuckles]

560
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,845
Something feels different,
don't you think?

561
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:23,335
Don't get distracted

562
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:25,587
-and keep your head in the game.
-But...

563
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,399
We took the money bags,

564
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,735
out of the cargo hold
and had them brought up.

565
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,319
Thank you.

566
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,657
-I couldn't have done it without you.
-Thank you very much.

567
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:56,118
[sighs] We don't
deserve the credit, sir.

568
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:58,162
I'm grateful you trusted us.

[Tae-su and Gu-ho chuckle]

570
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:02,875

574
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:16,889
I knew the plan up to this
point, but what's the next step?

575
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,474
We'll figure it out as we go.

576
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:22,895
Huh? Are you for real?
You don't even know? Huh?

A shame, really.

583
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:36,742
It was almost perfect.

584
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:39,369
Sir. What happened?

592
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:03,185

really lucky, right?

can... explain everything.

That reminds me. No wonder
you looked so damn familiar.

You know? [chuckles]

599
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,907
But who cares about
all of that now? Huh?

600
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,450
It'll all end soon enough.

[James] Thanks to everyone's
cooperation, we were able to react fast.

698
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,820
Thank you.

699
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,073
Huh? It's...

700
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:10,408
Hi. Get back to your seat.

701
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:13,870
Captain Kim. You bastards.

702
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:15,122
Are you insane?!

703
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:16,540
[wind blowing]

704
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:17,749
-[James] Gu-ho.
-Yeah.

705
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:18,792
-Gu-ho.
-Wha...?

706
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:19,960
Yi-rang needs you.

707
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:21,044
Huh?

708
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:23,296
Wake up, boy. Get to work.

709
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,133
[groans softly] Huh?

710
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:28,134
Huh?

711
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,304
-What's going on?
-[Tae-su] Are you fucking crazy?

712
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:31,555
Let go of me. Let go!

713
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,140
Did you just

714
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:35,934
dump all of my 50
fucking billion won?

715
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,102
[laughing maniacally]

716
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,437
[gasps] That's true!
That was your money!

717
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,399
So what now? What the
hell are we gonna do?

718
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:44,192
How are we getting it?

719
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:46,986
[sighs]

720
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:49,906
[screams]

721
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:50,990
Shit!

722
00:40:56,163 --> 00:40:57,163
[gasps]

723
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:01,209
-Open it!
-What?

724
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:03,628
-Grab that!
-Grab it?

725
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:05,755
-Okay.
-It's yours!

726
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:09,342
Try it on!

727
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:10,594
[Gu-ho] Are you

728
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:12,888
-saying I have to jump off?
-That's what I'm saying!

729
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,222
-Oh!
-[Tae-su grunts]

730
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:15,891
Don't you dare move!

731
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:18,518
Or I'm going to kill
you both! [grunts]

732
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:19,894
Hey, put it on!

733
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,105
What? Sir, why me?

734
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:23,481
Here, for you.

735
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,400
Put it on! What are
you waiting for?

736
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,360
Hurry, find my money now!

737
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:32,157
[scoffs]

738
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,119
I pulled you out of the
gutter when you had nothing.

739
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,665
Gave you a shot at a life, and
you repay me like this? Ha!

740
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:42,875
[scoffs]

741
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:51,009
[upbeat music playing]

742
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:53,720
[bodyguard] Sir,
what are you doing?

743
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,765
Are you actually
going to jump off?

744
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,600
You'll go, just for that?

745
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:01,895
"Just for that?"

746
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:03,687
[Tae-su scoffs]

747
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,609
This is the kind of cash
you dream of having...

748
00:42:08,944 --> 00:42:11,154
and will never get! [laughing]

749
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:12,989

750
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:24,876

[Tae-su grunts then screams]

752
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:51,361
[bodyguard] Whoa! Did he jump?

753
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:52,444
-Wow!
-Oh!

754
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:55,865

-Shut it! The door! The door!
-How do I close it?

757
00:43:09,129 --> 00:43:11,631
-Just pull the handle hard! Come on.
-[screams]

758
00:43:11,715 --> 00:43:13,133
-Just grab that!
-[screams]

759
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:14,342
Pull it!

00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:17,971

762
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:19,889
-[Yi-rang] One, two, three.

769
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:48,084
There are my babies.

770
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,170
Yeah, there they are.

771
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:52,714
My precious babies!

My babies.

775
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:06,477
Thank you.

776
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:09,439

[upbeat music playing]

779
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:23,953
What the hell?

780
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:29,292
[grunts] Shit!

781
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,133
[James] The aircraft is
now safe and on course.

782
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:40,387
Ladies and gentlemen, we'll get
you to your destination safely.

783
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:42,138
Ladies and gentlemen...

784
00:44:42,222 --> 00:44:43,848
[inhales deeply] Mmm.

785
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:44,932
Thank you.

786
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:47,685
["Lights, Camera,
Action" by Hui playing]

787
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:54,401
[Yi-rang] James, while
we're buying time outside,

788
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:57,153
swap the money bags that
are in the cargo hold.

789
00:44:57,237 --> 00:44:58,822
[James] Do you have
any idea how hard

790
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:00,949
it was to swap out all
those money bags on my own?

791
00:45:04,244 --> 00:45:05,244
Okay!

792
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,872
-[all cheering]
-[James] Wow, great job.

793
00:45:07,956 --> 00:45:09,874
Really convincing.
Nice performance.

794
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:11,376
Okay! Good job.

795
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:14,879
-Yi-rang, great work.
-[happy moans]

796
00:45:14,963 --> 00:45:15,963
Well done, my dear!

797
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,216
Gu-ho, well done.

798
00:45:19,843 --> 00:45:21,845
-James...
-Oh, oh, oh.

799
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:23,248
[Yi-rang] What is
wrong with him?

800
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:25,223
He's sleeping all day.

801
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:27,434
Oh, this kid. He's so fragile.

802
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,523
[screaming]

803
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:39,946
[screaming]

804
00:45:47,162 --> 00:45:49,456
-[music fades]
-[Yi-rang] Whoo!

805
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:51,166
Ta-da!

806
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:54,127
Remember how I bought a winery

807
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,005
-in Burgundy, France, last month?
-Yeah.

808
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:59,007
This champagne comes
from that winery.

809
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,676
And since I own it, I think
I deserve a little taste.

810
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:02,886
Of course you do.

811
00:46:04,304 --> 00:46:05,597
-Thank you.
-Mmm.

812
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:09,058
How could you do that to me?

813
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:10,727
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

814
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,687
[chuckles] Sorry, sorry.

815
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,189
Huh? Just come and join us.

816
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:15,607
-No way...
-Just come here.

817
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,025
-Absolutely not!
-Come on!

818
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:18,944
-[Yi-rang chuckles]
-[Gu-ho] I just don't understand.

819
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:20,445
You're gonna have
to explain it to me.

820
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:22,697
How much of it was real
and how much was fake?

821
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,240
[inhales through teeth]

822
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:28,870
[Yi-rang] It's true that James
approached him disguised as a captain.

823
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:31,331
If you don't mind, can I get
your business card as well?

824
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:34,334
[Yi-rang] Jeon Tae-su was way
more suspicious than we thought.

825
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,669
Earning his trust
was no easy task.

826
00:46:36,753 --> 00:46:39,422
So we figured it wasn't going
to work out, and we pulled out.

827
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:40,506
TRUTH

828
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:44,219
From that moment on,
everything was a lie.

829
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:47,472
Jeon Tae-su never actually turned
up at the cargo ship that day.

830
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:48,431
[grunts]

831
00:46:48,515 --> 00:46:51,267
So the whole story about James
getting assaulted and beaten

832
00:46:51,351 --> 00:46:52,268
was something we made up.

833
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:53,352
FALSE

834
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:57,565
After that, we kept waiting for
Jeon Tae-su to give us a call.

835
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:01,903
But since he was so suspicious,
he didn't even bother to text us.

836
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:04,656
Time to improvise.

837
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:09,786
However as soon as we came
up with the whole operation,

838
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:11,579
you immediately came to mind.

839
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:13,081
Because what Jeon Tae-su wants

840
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:16,960
isn't simply trust, but
absolute loyalty and obedience.

841
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:18,503
So, that was the plan.

842
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,505
-You both had this all
figured out -[laughs]

843
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:21,881
from the start!

844
00:47:21,965 --> 00:47:23,675
Gu-ho, get the truffle
oil, would you?

845
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:25,843
Could you grind me some
Himalayan pink salt?

846
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:28,888
[sighs] Seriously,
my life is just...

847
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:31,391
-Oh, tastes great, huh?
-It's so refreshing.

848
00:47:32,392 --> 00:47:34,102
-[sighs] Here you go.
-Thank you.

849
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:37,480
Gu-ho, see? Absolute
loyalty and obedience.

850
00:47:37,564 --> 00:47:38,815
That's what you embody.

851
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:40,525
You were perfect for this job.

852
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:45,572
-You know what? You can't have it.
-[Yi-rang and James chuckle]

853
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:47,365
We were saying that
you're considerate.

854
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,285
-Is that it?
-That's all.

855
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:55,206
-Okay.
-Okay.

856
00:47:55,707 --> 00:47:59,335
Wait, you were going to jump out of
the actual plane? What was that about?

857
00:47:59,419 --> 00:48:01,963
Huh? Yi-rang, I knew you
were a little unhinged,

858
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:05,425
-but I never thought you'd actually...
-At altitudes below 3,000 meters,

859
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:08,636
the pressure difference between the
cabin and the outside isn't drastic,

860
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,722
so sudden decompression
isn't really a risk.

861
00:48:11,264 --> 00:48:12,223
[mumbles]

862
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:13,600
FLIGHT ALTITUDE = 1,000 METERS

863
00:48:13,683 --> 00:48:16,686
So as long as we didn't
climb any higher, no problem.

864
00:48:17,145 --> 00:48:19,147
I did all the
necessary calculations.

865
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,610
-Okay, but that was wrong. All right?
-[James chuckles]

866
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:25,028
I mean it.

867
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:27,905
-It must've been so easy for you, huh?
-What?

868
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:30,992
While I was fighting for my
life, you were in a hospital bed,

869
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:34,329
kicking back all relaxed,
just wasting time, huh?

870
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,914
What are you talking
about? I was very busy.

871
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,833
I was always right
