1
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:14,097
Unnie..

2
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,059
Why are you so late?

3
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:20,853
Well..

4
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,659
I was waiting for you.

5
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,371
This is a first.

6
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,164
Seeing you this drunk.

7
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,250
Did something happen?

8
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,963
Don't.

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,007
Huh?

10
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,936
I told you not to meet him.

11
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:04,981
That Kwak Yeon-woo guy or whatever.

12
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,820
The Team Leader?

13
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:16,409
I don't like him.

14
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,250
Unnie, no way..

15
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,003
Are you jealous right now?

16
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,130
Yeah.

17
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,925
So don't meet him.

18
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,346
You didn't even tell me

19
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,681
that he was the Team Leader.

20
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,478
I didn't tell you?

21
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:46,981
I definitely texted you.

22
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,485
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,199
I don't know.

24
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,543
This isn't really like me.

25
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,503
I'm acting like a child.

26
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,925
I like it though, a lot.

27
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:25,269
You said you weren't the jealous type.

28
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,525
It's because it's you.

29
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:32,818
Because it's you.

30
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,536
You don't have to worry.

31
00:02:43,954 --> 00:02:45,623
Why would I meet him?

32
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,375
When I have you, Unnie.

33
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:55,092
Even if you weren't here, I wouldn't have any reason to meet him.

34
00:03:03,432 --> 00:03:05,309
Kiss me then.

35
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,985
Unnie, you started it.

36
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,715
You know, Ha-yoon, come to think of it, you're totally my type.

37
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,679
Excuse me?

38
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,349
I said you're totally my style.

39
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,143
Ha-yoon.

40
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,275
Oh, why so surprised?

41
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,527
I mean work-wise, work-wise.

42
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:00,532
An employee as quick-witted

43
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:03,367
and sharp as you isn't easy to find, you know?

44
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,498
Thank you.

45
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,501
So..

46
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:14,545
I have a proposition for you.

47
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,465
A proposition?

48
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:22,637
For the project I'm starting this time,

49
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,264
if you're okay with it, Ha-yoon,

50
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,141
would you like to handle the presentation?

51
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,894
Really?

52
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:33,565
If I could do that, it would be a huge honor.

53
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:36,902
I'll take that as a yes then.

54
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,070
Let's do a good job together, yeah?

55
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,677
Ha-yoon, regarding our project,

56
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,179
I put together some reference materials that might be useful.

57
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:07,849
Take a look, it'll help.

58
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,434
Yes, understood.

59
00:05:20,402 --> 00:05:22,030
This is exactly what you were planning, Unnie.

60
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,657
It's a carbon copy of your project.

61
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,534
From the concept to the direction.

62
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:32,373
Even the client is exactly the same.

63
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,143
How many hours has it been?

64
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,436
This is going to kill us.

65
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,233
It's okay, we have to work hard.

66
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,027
I don't have a team anymore, I'm alone.

67
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:34,476
Unnie..

68
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:36,353
Actually..

69
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,456
It's fine.

70
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,960
This industry is so small and competitive,

71
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,628
in a way, it's unavoidable.

72
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,884
At least it's a company I know,

73
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,594
that might be a blessing in disguise.

74
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,097
Still.

75
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,976
I just have to work hard and make it mine.

76
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,021
Of course, that won't be easy.

77
00:07:19,813 --> 00:07:22,567
So, work hard from now on, Lee Ha-yoon, okay?

78
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,568
Switch on for now.

79
00:07:30,657 --> 00:07:32,827
But come to think of it, we are competitors.

80
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,454
We need to keep work and personal life clearly separate.

81
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:36,998
Don't you think?

82
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,639
But we're at home right now.

83
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,476
No.

84
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,186
Don't do this.

85
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:01,856
My heart is pounding so hard I feel like I'm going to die.

86
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,652
Why are you so nervous?

87
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,907
Like it's your first time.

88
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,467
Stay still.

89
00:08:30,926 --> 00:08:32,846
Let's see how long you can last.

90
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,851
Hello?

91
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,438
It's me, Dae-young.

92
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,064
Is it too late?

93
00:09:26,064 --> 00:09:26,983
Huh?

94
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,527
Team Leader.

95
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,945
No, I haven't gone to sleep yet.

96
00:09:31,945 --> 00:09:33,363
But what's up?

97
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,449
By any chance..

98
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,577
Do you know a guy named Kwak Yeon-woo?

99
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,244
He's the new Team Leader

100
00:09:39,244 --> 00:09:41,163
who took my spot in the team.

101
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,375
Ah.. Kwak Yeon-woo.

102
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,210
Yes.

103
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:48,003
I heard about him a few times when I was at the overseas branch.

104
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:50,088
But why do you ask?

105
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:53,384
The project he's running

106
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,970
is identical to what I was doing.

107
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,099
It's not just a simple copy,

108
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,645
the way the whole thing is structured is too familiar.

109
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,730
Could you, perhaps with your overseas connections,

110
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,525
find out about his reputation?

111
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,237
I have a bad feeling about this.

112
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:13,820
Ah..

113
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,658
Understood.

114
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,243
I actually had some suspicions myself.

115
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,496
I'll check and let you know right away.

116
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,539
Please do.
