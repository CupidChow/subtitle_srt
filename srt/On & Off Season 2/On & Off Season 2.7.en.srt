1
00:00:00,712 --> 00:00:01,838
At my age, do you think

2
00:00:01,838 --> 00:00:03,924
I'd have this flashy career for nothing?

3
00:00:04,466 --> 00:00:06,635
It's only possible because I have connections backing me.

4
00:00:07,969 --> 00:00:09,721
So, let me say it again.

5
00:00:10,096 --> 00:00:11,514
If you keep going like this, Hayoon,

6
00:00:11,514 --> 00:00:12,682
you might never be able to

7
00:00:12,682 --> 00:00:14,935
set foot in this industry again.

8
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,565
For someone so high and mighty,

9
00:00:20,732 --> 00:00:22,025
can you only manage to close deals

10
00:00:22,025 --> 00:00:23,526
through blackmail every single time?

11
00:00:24,277 --> 00:00:24,861
What?

12
00:00:25,862 --> 00:00:28,073
Since last time, you've only been biting

13
00:00:28,073 --> 00:00:29,950
at my weak spots and refusing to let go.

14
00:00:30,492 --> 00:00:32,702
Every time I see you do that, Team Leader,

15
00:00:33,411 --> 00:00:35,705
honestly, it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.

16
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:41,211
Do you really have to live so cowardly

17
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:42,295
just to climb to that position

18
00:00:42,295 --> 00:00:44,047
at your age?!

19
00:00:44,506 --> 00:00:44,965
Hey!

20
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:52,305
What do you think you're doing?

21
00:00:53,723 --> 00:00:55,725
You two are making quite a scene here.

22
00:00:56,851 --> 00:00:59,854
Showing up at someone's house late at night to threaten them,

23
00:00:59,854 --> 00:01:01,231
and now you're even raising your hand?

24
00:01:01,648 --> 00:01:03,316
It's because words don't work with her!

25
00:01:03,817 --> 00:01:05,527
I'm warning you for the last time.

26
00:01:05,527 --> 00:01:07,320
If you don't want Lee Hayoon's career to end...

27
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,405
About that career,

28
00:01:08,405 --> 00:01:10,490
I think you should be the one worrying about yours.

29
00:01:15,036 --> 00:01:15,787
Team Leader.

30
00:01:18,665 --> 00:01:20,000
Did you wait long?

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,335
No, I just got here too.

32
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:24,546
Thanks for making time despite being busy.

33
00:01:24,546 --> 00:01:25,922
Oh, it's nothing.

34
00:01:31,761 --> 00:01:32,679
Here you go.

35
00:01:46,818 --> 00:01:48,820
Just as I thought.

36
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,489
Yeah.

37
00:01:51,823 --> 00:01:53,950
It's worse than I imagined.

38
00:01:54,492 --> 00:01:56,161
Not just in Canada,

39
00:01:56,161 --> 00:01:56,995
but it looks like she pulled the exact same stunt

40
00:01:56,995 --> 00:01:59,122
in Singapore as well.

41
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,624
Since there wasn't clear evidence,

42
00:02:01,624 --> 00:02:03,877
everyone probably just took the hit.

43
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:08,631
This should be enough.

44
00:02:08,757 --> 00:02:10,550
By the way, Team Leader...

45
00:02:11,342 --> 00:02:13,344
Are you sure you'll be okay?

46
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,222
She doesn't seem like an easy opponent.

47
00:02:16,931 --> 00:02:18,308
It's fine.

48
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:21,811
This will settle things very cleanly.

49
00:02:24,272 --> 00:02:26,691
You haven't changed a bit, Team Leader.

50
00:02:31,446 --> 00:02:32,906
And if you need anything else,

51
00:02:32,906 --> 00:02:34,532
contact me anytime.

52
00:02:35,784 --> 00:02:37,702
I owe you so much, Team Leader,

53
00:02:37,702 --> 00:02:40,205
I'm glad I could at least do this for you.

54
00:02:41,623 --> 00:02:43,625
Thanks, Daeyoung.

55
00:02:54,677 --> 00:02:57,305
Project Aurora, Project Merlion.

56
00:02:58,306 --> 00:02:59,265
These are names that can't be left out

57
00:02:59,265 --> 00:03:01,309
of Kwak Yeon-woo's career, right?

58
00:03:07,524 --> 00:03:10,485
You... how did you get this?

59
00:03:12,195 --> 00:03:13,154
If this gets out,

60
00:03:13,154 --> 00:03:16,366
the one who will never set foot in this industry again...

61
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:18,034
Who do you think that will be?

62
00:03:19,077 --> 00:03:20,662
Just you wait.

63
00:03:20,662 --> 00:03:23,581
I won't let you two get away with this.

64
00:03:29,045 --> 00:03:30,130
Let's go inside.

65
00:03:31,798 --> 00:03:32,257
Let's go.

66
00:03:43,184 --> 00:03:44,644
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:46,813 --> 00:03:48,857
I wanted to tell you beforehand, but

68
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:54,195
rumors had already spread at the company,

69
00:03:54,988 --> 00:03:55,905
and I was afraid you'd think

70
00:03:55,905 --> 00:03:58,658
it happened because of you, Unnie.

71
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,791
You're already having a hard time,

72
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:10,712
I didn't want to give you more things to worry about.

73
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:29,397
Why should you be sorry?

74
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:43,119
Since it's come to this,

75
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:45,622
let's just say I hired you a bit early.

76
00:04:46,456 --> 00:04:47,498
What?

77
00:04:50,126 --> 00:04:52,128
Let's prepare for it together.

78
00:04:52,128 --> 00:04:53,630
This project.

79
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:56,591
We're going to win so clearly,

80
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:59,052
and completely flatten their egos.

81
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:05,183
How about it, Ms. Lee Hayoon?

82
00:05:05,892 --> 00:05:07,769
Want to do it with me?

83
00:05:25,828 --> 00:05:26,663
Ever since Hayoon

84
00:05:26,663 --> 00:05:28,790
completely quit the company,

85
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,334
we planned the project together.

86
00:05:34,128 --> 00:05:35,380
Ms. Lee Hayoon.

87
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:37,090
The Excel file you organized yesterday,

88
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,633
can you send it to me?

89
00:05:38,841 --> 00:05:40,301
I'll send it right away.

90
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:41,803
Just a moment.

91
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:48,977
The switch that had been off for a while

92
00:05:48,977 --> 00:05:50,561
was turned back on.

93
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:15,837
How long are you going to act like a boss?

94
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:18,923
I haven't even had dinner yet.

95
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:23,219
Can't I go back to normal now?

96
00:06:32,687 --> 00:06:34,105
Shall we?

97
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:03,301
Shall we go to the room?

98
00:07:26,574 --> 00:07:29,786
Yes, understood.

99
00:07:31,537 --> 00:07:32,997
Yes.

100
00:07:43,674 --> 00:07:44,801
Why?

101
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:46,552
Who is it?

102
00:07:47,637 --> 00:07:48,930
The client.

103
00:07:50,807 --> 00:07:52,308
What did they say?

104
00:07:53,184 --> 00:07:54,310
What's wrong?

105
00:07:56,437 --> 00:07:58,314
Why the serious face?

106
00:07:58,314 --> 00:07:59,107
Huh?

107
00:07:59,732 --> 00:08:01,150
What is it?

108
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,570
We...

109
00:08:05,738 --> 00:08:06,948
We?

110
00:08:08,783 --> 00:08:10,493
We did it.

111
00:08:10,493 --> 00:08:11,828
Contract signed.

112
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:14,956
Really?

113
00:08:18,876 --> 00:08:20,628
You really worked hard.

114
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:32,515
Unnie, aren't you drinking too much today?

115
00:08:33,015 --> 00:08:34,434
It's fine.

116
00:08:35,476 --> 00:08:36,853
It's celebratory booze.

117
00:08:42,608 --> 00:08:44,110
Are you okay?

118
00:08:52,577 --> 00:08:55,413
When did we get this comfortable with each other?

119
00:08:55,746 --> 00:08:58,416
Unnie, are you asleep?

120
00:09:09,177 --> 00:09:11,012
That kind of 'off' mode...

121
00:09:11,012 --> 00:09:14,348
is something only I get to see, I guess.

122
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,365
You're driving me crazy.

123
00:09:34,327 --> 00:09:36,329
She always says she's going crazy.

124
00:09:44,837 --> 00:09:46,339
I know, right.
