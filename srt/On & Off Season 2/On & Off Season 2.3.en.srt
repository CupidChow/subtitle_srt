1
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,719
Unnie...

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,679
How did I get home yesterday?

3
00:00:16,807 --> 00:00:18,476
Did you blackout?

4
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:22,856
The Team Leader...

5
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:26,318
Other than her bringing me home, I don't really...

6
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:30,572
I whipped something up,

7
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,282
so go down and have some hangover soup.

8
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,289
Unnie, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:43,668
I somehow ended up sitting next to the Team Leader,

10
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,505
and she kept pouring drinks for me...

11
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,215
It was kind of hard to refuse...

12
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,054
That the Team Leader is "that person",

13
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,931
why didn't you tell me?

14
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:03,313
It's okay.

15
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:04,981
You drank that much,

16
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,942
and nothing bad happened.

17
00:01:07,483 --> 00:01:09,527
You got home safe.

18
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,949
Did really nothing happen yesterday?

19
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,827
When I just got home,

20
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,411
did I make a scene or

21
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,496
cause you any trouble, Unnie?

22
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:28,295
Whatever it was, I'm really sorry.

23
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:31,465
It's almost my first time blacking out like that.

24
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,471
That new Team Leader

25
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,181
brought you home safely,

26
00:01:38,597 --> 00:01:40,809
and once you got home, you just slept soundly.

27
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,563
So you really don't have to worry.

28
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,626
Are you not going to work because of that, Lee Ha-yun?

29
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:10,005
Hurry up and get ready for work.

30
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,090
Still, Unnie...

31
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,103
What?

32
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,985
I'm afraid I might smell like alcohol.

33
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,132
Should I not go?

34
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:01,139
No, you still have to go.

35
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,481
So you don't have to worry today,

36
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,150
I'll come home early and safe.

37
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,153
Take care.

38
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,076
I'm leaving.

39
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,047
Stop acting like a child, Kwon Se-a.

40
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,320
Team Leader, I'm really sorry about yesterday.

41
00:03:58,028 --> 00:03:59,405
I've never been that drunk before...

42
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,867
It rarely happens to me, but of all days...

43
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:04,369
I caused you unnecessary trouble...

44
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,911
Forget it.

45
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:07,789
It was on my way anyway.

46
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:10,416
Still, I'm really sorry.

47
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,585
Then...

48
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,628
Buy me a meal, or a drink is fine too.

49
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,630
A meal?

50
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,259
If it's a meal, I'll buy you as much as you want.

51
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,260
As much as I want.

52
00:04:20,467 --> 00:04:21,594
I'm kidding.

53
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,637
Where have you seen a boss

54
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,264
asking an employee to buy them a meal?

55
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,724
It's my treat,

56
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,601
you just come along and eat.

57
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,769
You can also tell me about the office atmosphere.

58
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,563
In terms of when you joined, Ha-yun,

59
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,481
you're way senior to me, right?

60
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:37,527
Uh...

61
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,070
Is this a bit uncomfortable?

62
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,574
If not today, I think it might be difficult

63
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,701
for a while.

64
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,536
I promised Unnie today

65
00:04:47,536 --> 00:04:49,998
that I'd come home early...

66
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,501
No...

67
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:54,960
It's okay.

68
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,838
Good, let's do it today.

69
00:04:58,088 --> 00:04:58,840
Okay.

70
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,592
Then let's set the details later after work.

71
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:19,027
[Unnie, today I...]

72
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:41,925
Just once should be fine, right?

73
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:44,302
[One Day Before]

74
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,594
Nice to meet you all.

75
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:47,429
I'm Kwak Yeon-woo, appointed as the new Team Leader.

76
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:49,099
As you may have heard,

77
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,184
I've worked abroad for a long time,

78
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,519
so I'm a bit clumsy around here.

79
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,144
So I'd appreciate it if you could teach me a lot.

80
00:05:54,144 --> 00:05:56,815
I hope we work well together.

81
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,275
[Unnie, this is insane.]

82
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,664
[The new Team Leader is super young!]

83
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:20,297
Ha-yun.

84
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,757
Can you help me organize this?

85
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,635
Yes.

86
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,139
Why is the progress so slow?

87
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,168
[Unnie, I suddenly have a plan with the Team Leader. We'll just have dinner and a light drink, I'll be back soon.]

88
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:13,557
[Can't you not go...?]

89
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:24,735
[Eat lots of good food and come back.]

90
00:07:34,661 --> 00:07:41,585
Drinking two days in a row must not be easy.

91
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,747
Aren't you tired?

92
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,832
Did I call you out tactlessly

93
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,960
without considering your condition?

94
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,545
No, no.

95
00:08:24,628 --> 00:08:25,712
I'm fine.

96
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:26,965
Well, there's always hair of the dog...

97
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:30,342
Really?

98
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,094
Is being even one year younger really better?

99
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,680
Team Leader, you also...

100
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,557
look perfectly fine.

101
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,309
I guess I'm immune.

102
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,186
Since I've drunk so much strong liquor.

103
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:43,981
How has it been working at the company,

104
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,525
anything uncomfortable?

105
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:48,069
Am I a somewhat decent boss?

106
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:50,947
Although I haven't been here long.

107
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,823
Oh, of course.

108
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:55,909
Everyone respects you a lot, Team Leader...

109
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:59,204
Is that so...

110
00:08:59,204 --> 00:09:00,331
Since I lived abroad for a long time,

111
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,127
I'm less used to the culture here.

112
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,421
If anything is uncomfortable,

113
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,797
tell me anytime.

114
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:10,716
Yes.

115
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:13,970
But you know...

116
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:11,027
As soon as I saw you, Ha-yun,

117
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,284
I had an intuition that we'd get close.

118
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:22,412
Come to think of it, Ha-yun...

119
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:30,963
You are totally my style.

120
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,966
Pardon?

121
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:35,635
I'm saying you're totally my type.

122
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,390
Ha-yun.
