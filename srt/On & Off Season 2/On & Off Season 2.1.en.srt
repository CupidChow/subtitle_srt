1
00:00:29,282 --> 00:00:30,992
Unnie...

2
00:00:36,456 --> 00:00:38,541
Going to work without you...

3
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,418
I just don't feel like working anymore.

4
00:00:42,545 --> 00:00:44,547
You used to nag me all the time,

5
00:00:44,547 --> 00:00:46,216
speaking as if you hated it.

6
00:00:48,218 --> 00:00:50,553
But now that the carrot and stick are gone,

7
00:00:50,553 --> 00:00:52,347
I actually miss it all.

8
00:00:53,223 --> 00:00:54,849
So hurry up and start your own company,

9
00:00:54,849 --> 00:00:55,850
and take me with you.

10
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:58,061
I'm a total talent now,

11
00:00:59,062 --> 00:01:01,064
thanks to someone's training.

12
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:04,484
That way, I can finally feel the thrill

13
00:01:04,484 --> 00:01:06,069
of handing in a resignation letter.

14
00:01:08,697 --> 00:01:09,739
Okay.

15
00:01:10,073 --> 00:01:11,574
I'll do that.

16
00:01:12,742 --> 00:01:14,119
Don't worry.

17
00:01:15,954 --> 00:01:18,248
Eventually, I quit my job

18
00:01:18,248 --> 00:01:20,041
and started working as a freelancer.

19
00:01:21,376 --> 00:01:23,128
Ha-yoon tried to stop me, but

20
00:01:23,128 --> 00:01:24,796
I have no regrets about my choice.

21
00:01:29,634 --> 00:01:31,511
I went grocery shopping on my way home.

22
00:01:31,511 --> 00:01:33,013
Shall I make you something delicious?

23
00:01:35,348 --> 00:01:37,517
Instead, I have a different goal now.

24
00:01:38,226 --> 00:01:40,895
Starting a company under my own name.

25
00:01:43,314 --> 00:01:44,274
And spending the rest of my life

26
00:01:44,274 --> 00:01:46,151
with Ha-yoon.

27
00:01:46,776 --> 00:01:48,611
Just like now,

28
00:01:48,611 --> 00:01:50,488
full of happiness.

29
00:01:52,198 --> 00:01:54,117
I'll help you prepare. Let's go.

30
00:02:20,643 --> 00:02:23,146
You smell so good, Unnie.

31
00:02:32,155 --> 00:02:34,157
We need to eat.

32
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:39,037
Right now, rather than food,

33
00:02:39,037 --> 00:02:41,539
I think I need you more, Unnie.

34
00:02:52,092 --> 00:02:54,469
You've grown up a lot, Lee Ha-yoon.

35
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:00,517
I learned it all from my Team Leader.

36
00:03:30,797 --> 00:03:32,465
Are you nervous?

37
00:03:39,722 --> 00:03:41,516
So what?

38
00:03:41,516 --> 00:03:43,309
We're not at the office anyway.

39
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:55,655
Close your eyes.

40
00:03:55,947 --> 00:03:57,282
Lee Ha-yoon.

41
00:04:39,032 --> 00:04:40,366
What?

42
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:42,410
It's cold, but why does it taste so good?

43
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:45,330
It's good, right?

44
00:04:45,622 --> 00:04:47,707
I told you I'm good at making pasta.

45
00:04:48,082 --> 00:04:51,044
You're going to crave it every day now.

46
00:04:52,587 --> 00:04:55,673
Unnie, you'd be in big trouble without me, seriously.

47
00:04:56,549 --> 00:04:57,926
You're right.

48
00:04:57,926 --> 00:05:00,178
I really can't do without you.

49
00:05:02,222 --> 00:05:03,723
How about it?

50
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:05,725
You're dying to live with me, aren't you?

51
00:05:08,895 --> 00:05:10,230
Is that so?

52
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:12,649
Shall we live together?

53
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,817
Pardon?

54
00:05:18,655 --> 00:05:20,615
Shall we live together, us?

55
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:25,578
Do you really mean it?

56
00:05:27,914 --> 00:05:29,415
Of course.

57
00:05:32,126 --> 00:05:35,296
But Unnie, you like being alone.

58
00:05:41,552 --> 00:05:44,138
I've come to like being with you more.

59
00:05:46,224 --> 00:05:48,601
Beyond comparison.

60
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,503
I said I'd help, isn't it heavy?

61
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,547
You're already busy,

62
00:06:17,547 --> 00:06:19,048
why would I take up more of your time?

63
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:20,842
Still.

64
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:23,344
You helped me move the big stuff,

65
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:25,513
and you caught a taxi for me coming here.

66
00:06:26,514 --> 00:06:27,307
Besides, I'm practically

67
00:06:27,307 --> 00:06:28,975
mooching off you in your house.

68
00:06:29,475 --> 00:06:30,601
From the gate to the front door,

69
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:32,729
can't I at least carry this in?

70
00:06:34,605 --> 00:06:37,650
And so, we started living together.

71
00:06:38,526 --> 00:06:40,111
Is that all the luggage?

72
00:06:40,111 --> 00:06:41,654
That's it, that's it. Don't worry,

73
00:06:41,654 --> 00:06:42,530
just go inside, go in.

74
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,073
Give it to me.

75
00:06:44,282 --> 00:06:45,325
Let's go.

76
00:06:46,034 --> 00:06:47,118
Let's go.

77
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:01,257
Lying here like this, we look like newlyweds.

78
00:07:02,216 --> 00:07:03,217
True.

79
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:06,929
How does it feel to move in?

80
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,641
Hmm...

81
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:11,976
I wonder if it's okay

82
00:07:11,976 --> 00:07:14,937
to feel like this is my home so quickly.

83
00:07:17,106 --> 00:07:18,858
It is your home.

84
00:07:19,734 --> 00:07:21,569
What's mine is yours.

85
00:07:22,403 --> 00:07:23,321
What's this...

86
00:07:23,321 --> 00:07:25,740
Why have you become so expressive lately?

87
00:07:26,491 --> 00:07:29,285
Without the stick, getting only the carrot...

88
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:31,204
It feels kind of awkward.

89
00:07:32,372 --> 00:07:33,873
So you don't like it?

90
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:39,754
No.

91
00:07:40,213 --> 00:07:42,673
I like it so much it scares me.

92
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:46,761
I really love it.

93
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,486
It feels like a dream.

94
00:08:22,922 --> 00:08:25,133
You always provoke me first,

95
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:27,635
so why are you so shy now?

96
00:08:30,012 --> 00:08:31,431
Cute.

97
00:08:34,142 --> 00:08:35,560
You're driving me crazy.

98
00:08:36,477 --> 00:08:37,937
Please...

99
00:08:39,439 --> 00:08:40,690
Where are you looking?

100
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:42,817
Look at me.

101
00:08:46,362 --> 00:08:47,321
Why?

102
00:08:48,698 --> 00:08:50,575
What do you think I'm going to do?
