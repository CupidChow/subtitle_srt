1
00:00:10,847 --> 00:00:11,681
What is this?

2
00:00:13,058 --> 00:00:14,225
It's my resignation.

3
00:00:15,226 --> 00:00:16,186
Resignation?

4
00:00:17,979 --> 00:00:19,564
I can't do that work anymore.

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,441
What?

6
00:00:22,192 --> 00:00:24,194
I don't think this is right.

7
00:00:25,236 --> 00:00:26,988
And I am capable of it.

8
00:00:27,572 --> 00:00:29,157
That lousy project...

9
00:00:29,157 --> 00:00:31,910
I'm capable enough to handle it alone.

10
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:39,459
Lee Ha-yoon.

11
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:43,421
Does everyone think I'm a pushover or something?

12
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,048
If you throw those petty conditions at me...

13
00:00:45,048 --> 00:00:46,967
Did you think I'd waver because of that?

14
00:00:47,258 --> 00:00:49,761
Ms. Lee Ha-yoon, you...

15
00:00:50,637 --> 00:00:53,098
I'll only work until a replacement is found.

16
00:00:54,307 --> 00:00:56,309
Do you think you can get away with this now?

17
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:58,561
Aren't you afraid of rumors?

18
00:00:59,437 --> 00:01:00,730
I'm not afraid.

19
00:01:01,022 --> 00:01:02,399
Go ahead and spread them.

20
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,650
Shall I do it myself?

21
00:01:06,903 --> 00:01:08,113
I'll be going now.

22
00:01:24,504 --> 00:01:26,089
In the end, the rumor that Unnie and I...

23
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:28,049
...were dating spread throughout the company.

24
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:30,969
They say Lee Ha-yoon and our former Team Leader...

25
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:32,220
...are dating?

26
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,346
No wonder...

27
00:01:33,346 --> 00:01:35,181
She scolded her but kept protecting her.

28
00:01:35,181 --> 00:01:36,558
It seemed suspicious.

29
00:01:37,183 --> 00:01:39,769
Turns out it was just a lovers' quarrel.

30
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:43,898
Then Team Leader Kwon Se-ah quitting must also be...

31
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,986
Shall we all go grab lunch together?

32
00:02:10,592 --> 00:02:12,844
And during the handover period...

33
00:02:12,844 --> 00:02:16,931
...Team Leader Gwak Yeon-woo's subtle bullying also began.

34
00:02:27,317 --> 00:02:29,194
Did you get back okay?

35
00:02:37,577 --> 00:02:39,287
Of course.

36
00:02:39,287 --> 00:02:42,624
The company doesn't run without me now.

37
00:02:47,754 --> 00:02:48,880
Come here.

38
00:02:58,848 --> 00:03:00,642
You worked hard.

39
00:03:08,566 --> 00:03:10,401
Maybe a bit later.

40
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:12,695
Let's talk later.

41
00:03:36,553 --> 00:03:37,971
Ms. Ha-yoon, since you're anyway...

42
00:03:37,971 --> 00:03:40,473
...going to leave once a replacement comes in...

43
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:41,850
There are plenty of people in this company...

44
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,518
...who want to get in.

45
00:03:44,102 --> 00:03:45,770
So I cleared your desk in advance.

46
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,902
You can use that one in the back for now.

47
00:03:57,073 --> 00:03:58,992
That's much more efficient.

48
00:03:58,992 --> 00:04:00,160
Don't you agree?

49
00:04:13,756 --> 00:04:15,049
You're back.

50
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:18,011
What should we have for dinner?

51
00:04:22,223 --> 00:04:24,517
Not right now.

52
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:26,811
I don't really have an appetite.

53
00:04:28,521 --> 00:04:32,025
Something has definitely changed.

54
00:04:33,735 --> 00:04:35,778
Did something happen at work?

55
00:04:37,822 --> 00:04:39,407
Work? No...

56
00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:41,159
It's nothing.

57
00:04:41,534 --> 00:04:44,204
I'm just a little tired.

58
00:04:53,713 --> 00:04:58,218
[Team Leader Gwak: I'm in front of your house. Ha-yoon, can you come out for a second? I'll wait.]

59
00:04:59,052 --> 00:05:00,929
No.

60
00:05:00,929 --> 00:05:02,889
If she even runs into Unnie...

61
00:05:06,643 --> 00:05:08,937
I'll be right back.

62
00:05:19,906 --> 00:05:20,823
You came out.

63
00:05:22,742 --> 00:05:23,910
Why did you come all the way to my house?

64
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:27,914
Isn't work life a bit tough?

65
00:05:29,249 --> 00:05:31,834
You kindly ruined it for me, Team Leader.

66
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:36,547
That's why I came.

67
00:05:36,547 --> 00:05:37,840
Because I'm sorry.

68
00:05:38,424 --> 00:05:39,634
You're sorry?

69
00:05:40,134 --> 00:05:41,094
Yes.

70
00:05:41,094 --> 00:05:43,596
I'm sorry, so I want to give you one last chance.

71
00:05:44,264 --> 00:05:46,557
I'll say this one last time.

72
00:05:46,557 --> 00:05:49,018
Hand that project over to me.

73
00:05:54,274 --> 00:05:55,692
It's really better for you to hand it over now...

74
00:05:55,692 --> 00:05:57,944
...Ms. Ha-yoon.

75
00:05:58,903 --> 00:06:00,655
If you're only going to say useless things...

76
00:06:00,655 --> 00:06:02,282
...I'll be going now.

77
00:06:02,282 --> 00:06:03,241
Even outside of work hours...

78
00:06:03,241 --> 00:06:05,034
...I don't wish to see you, Team Leader.

79
00:06:06,244 --> 00:06:08,371
You shouldn't just go like this now.

80
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:14,252
Ms. Ha-yoon, in this field...

81
00:06:14,252 --> 00:06:16,421
...do you not want to work anymore?

82
00:06:17,547 --> 00:06:18,256
Excuse me?

83
00:06:20,049 --> 00:06:21,467
Do you think I have such a flashy career at my age...

84
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:23,553
...for no reason?

85
00:06:23,803 --> 00:06:25,972
It's possible because I have connections.

86
00:06:29,475 --> 00:06:31,227
So I'll tell you again.

87
00:06:31,602 --> 00:06:33,021
If you leave like this, Ha-yoon...

88
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:34,188
...you might never be able to...

89
00:06:34,188 --> 00:06:36,441
...set foot in this industry again.

90
00:06:40,194 --> 00:06:42,071
For someone as great as you...

91
00:06:42,238 --> 00:06:43,531
...you can't seem to make a deal...

92
00:06:43,531 --> 00:06:45,033
...without using threats every single time.

93
00:06:45,783 --> 00:06:46,367
What?

94
00:06:47,368 --> 00:06:49,579
Since last time, you keep targeting my weak points...

95
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:51,456
...and won't let go.

96
00:06:51,998 --> 00:06:54,208
Team Leader, every time I see you do that...

97
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:57,211
...honestly, it feels a bit pathetic.

98
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:02,717
Do you really have to live so cowardly...

99
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:03,801
...to climb to that position...

100
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:05,678
...at your age?!

101
00:07:06,012 --> 00:07:06,596
Hey!
