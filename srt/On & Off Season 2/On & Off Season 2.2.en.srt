1
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:09,760
Wow, she's really pretty.

2
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,931
So you like that style?

3
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,936
No...

4
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:21,771
It's not exactly that, just...

5
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:25,275
It's okay, it's your type.

6
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:38,079
Why?

7
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,376
Unnie, don't you get jealous?

8
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,088
Jealous?

9
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,217
If I look at handsome or pretty people,

10
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,927
or stare blankly at someone on the street,

11
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,222
or watch these idol fancams,

12
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,474
you don't feel anything?

13
00:00:58,307 --> 00:00:59,726
Well...

14
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,313
I don't really know.

15
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,565
I don't really think much of it.

16
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,277
That's a bit disappointing.

17
00:01:10,778 --> 00:01:11,780
If you did that, Unnie,

18
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,032
I think I'd be super jealous.

19
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,411
I don't do that anyway.

20
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,246
That's not the point.

21
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,585
The person you're seeing right now is me.

22
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:28,588
What use is all that?

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,342
You love me anyway.

24
00:01:34,635 --> 00:01:36,804
That's true, but...

25
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:40,809
And technically speaking,

26
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,978
aren't I your type too?

27
00:01:48,315 --> 00:01:50,068
So, Lee Ha-yun,

28
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,485
instead of wasting time on useless thoughts,

29
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:53,447
focus on me a little.

30
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:06,876
You act like a boss only at times like this.

31
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:09,253
Didn't you say we're not at work anymore?

32
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,257
Shall we finish what we're doing

33
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,217
and go eat something good?

34
00:02:15,092 --> 00:02:16,802
Are you changing the subject?

35
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,014
No.

36
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,724
I gave you the whip, now I have to give you the carrot.

37
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,978
Just to make it clear so you don't get confused.

38
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:40,327
Oh, right.

39
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:43,329
The Team Leader position that was empty after you left,

40
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,873
I heard someone is coming in.

41
00:02:45,706 --> 00:02:46,750
Really?

42
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,503
Yeah.

43
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,505
I thought they'd promote someone from below,

44
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,507
but I heard it's someone coming back

45
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,382
from working at an overseas branch.

46
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,429
When is she starting?

47
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,556
From next week.

48
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,559
She's just getting the handover,

49
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,559
and they say she'll join

50
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:07,228
this project right away.

51
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,693
But looking at her experience alone,

52
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,695
she seems to be quite old.

53
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:17,780
It was really impressive.

54
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,869
I wonder who it is.

55
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,057
Why isn't she coming yet?

56
00:03:56,193 --> 00:03:57,027
Lee Ha-yun, where are you...

57
00:03:57,027 --> 00:03:58,195
Hello?

58
00:04:01,365 --> 00:04:02,284
Who is this?

59
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,494
Ah, I'm a colleague.

60
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,414
Ha-yun is very drunk right now.

61
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,458
Team Leader.

62
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,755
Do you want to start 'Day 1' with me today?

63
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,719
Why am I remembering that moment right now?

64
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,056
A bad feeling.

65
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:27,184
I'm coming.

66
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,809
Please text me the address.

67
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:30,394
No, you don't have to...

68
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,876
Hello, you're Se-ah Unnie, right?

69
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,632
Is she a cousin? They don't look alike.

70
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,596
We had drinks to celebrate my appointment today,

71
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,514
and Ha-yun got very drunk.

72
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,432
Did I force her too much?

73
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,648
Come here.

74
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:21,947
Thank you.

75
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,989
Team Leader...

76
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:25,699
I'm okay.

77
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,452
If I wait a bit, Unnie will...

78
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,498
If I call Unnie, she comes right away...

79
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,125
You don't have to take care of me...

80
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,422
You could have just left her, I would have picked her up.

81
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,882
My house is in the same direction,

82
00:05:41,882 --> 00:05:43,802
so I couldn't just leave her.

83
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,097
How are you related to Ha-yun...

84
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:49,891
Ah...

85
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,644
I'm the new Team Leader in Ha-yun's department.

86
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,144
My name is Kwak Yeon-woo.

87
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,150
But looking at her experience alone,

88
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,445
she seems to be quite old.

89
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,784
A young woman.

90
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,704
Thanks for bringing her.

91
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,039
Get home safely.

92
00:06:14,164 --> 00:06:14,833
Let's go.

93
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,108
Why did she get so drunk?

94
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:55,873
[Team Leader Kwak Yeon-woo: Did you get home okay? I'm worried because you looked very drunk. Message me tomorrow as soon as you wake up.]
