1
00:00:10,221 --> 00:00:11,932
Unnie, you're back?

2
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,853
I totally burned myself out again today.

3
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,733
Shall we have something good for dinner?

4
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:24,027
Since you worked hard all day.

5
00:00:24,861 --> 00:00:25,820
Sounds good.

6
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:27,072
What about you, Unnie?

7
00:00:28,573 --> 00:00:30,408
Me too, just so-so.

8
00:00:35,246 --> 00:00:38,541
Lying down like this is definitely the best.

9
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:41,378
I want to stay like this a little longer.

10
00:00:41,378 --> 00:00:42,879
Okay.

11
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:02,399
No, but that meeting...

12
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,567
Does it make sense for it to go that wrong?

13
00:01:07,779 --> 00:01:09,406
That's not something you should be telling me,

14
00:01:09,406 --> 00:01:11,658
you should be persuading the client.

15
00:01:13,034 --> 00:01:16,830
Persuade them somehow and bring them to me.

16
00:01:36,307 --> 00:01:36,891
Ha-yoon.

17
00:01:36,891 --> 00:01:39,394
Shall we grab some brunch out front for lunch?

18
00:01:39,394 --> 00:01:40,687
It's almost lunchtime.

19
00:01:42,647 --> 00:01:44,190
Then I'll ask the other team members too...

20
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:44,899
No.

21
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:45,984
Just the two of us.

22
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,445
Pardon?

23
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,325
I told you not to meet her.

24
00:01:55,076 --> 00:01:57,370
That Gwak Yeon-woo or whoever.

25
00:02:00,957 --> 00:02:03,209
You mean the Team Manager?

26
00:02:05,712 --> 00:02:08,798
I don't like that woman.

27
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,848
Team Manager, I'm sorry but...

28
00:02:17,474 --> 00:02:18,266
You can't?

29
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:20,310
It's an urgent work matter.

30
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:22,562
Then here...

31
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:26,191
It's a bit inappropriate to discuss this in a public place.

32
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:31,613
Understood.

33
00:02:31,863 --> 00:02:34,032
Let's have lunch together later.

34
00:02:48,004 --> 00:02:50,090
Ha-yoon, are you seeing anyone?

35
00:02:56,429 --> 00:03:00,350
Yes, I am seeing someone.

36
00:03:01,643 --> 00:03:02,894
I see.

37
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,355
How long have you been together?

38
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:09,901
It hasn't been that long,

39
00:03:09,901 --> 00:03:11,528
but it's been a while...

40
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:16,116
Whoever is dating you must be pretty.

41
00:03:21,704 --> 00:03:23,206
Is she older?

42
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:26,793
Yes.

43
00:03:27,794 --> 00:03:30,088
Where did you meet? At work?

44
00:03:32,048 --> 00:03:34,425
At my previous job...

45
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,011
It's Kwon Se-ah, right?

46
00:03:38,346 --> 00:03:39,347
Yes...

47
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:42,350
What?!

48
00:03:42,934 --> 00:03:44,435
I knew it.

49
00:03:45,061 --> 00:03:48,606
It looked like that when I saw you last time.

50
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:54,529
Don't worry, I don't have any prejudice.

51
00:03:56,156 --> 00:03:57,657
Ah...

52
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,577
I don't.

53
00:04:01,536 --> 00:04:02,245
Pardon?

54
00:04:02,912 --> 00:04:05,456
But I wonder if others will feel the same?

55
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:08,918
Manager.

56
00:04:10,336 --> 00:04:13,298
That Ha-yoon's lover is her former boss...

57
00:04:13,298 --> 00:04:14,924
It would be interesting if rumors spread in the company.

58
00:04:14,924 --> 00:04:15,967
Don't you think?

59
00:04:17,343 --> 00:04:19,220
You might get fired, Ha-yoon,

60
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:22,140
and people will constantly talk behind your back.

61
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:24,809
And what about Kwon Se-ah's guilt?

62
00:04:26,352 --> 00:04:27,854
What are you talking about...

63
00:04:27,854 --> 00:04:29,647
I'm asking because I already know everything,

64
00:04:29,647 --> 00:04:31,524
so don't even think about denying it.

65
00:04:33,568 --> 00:04:34,986
Even if you say no,

66
00:04:34,986 --> 00:04:36,696
nothing will change.

67
00:04:39,157 --> 00:04:41,159
Don't mess with Unnie.

68
00:04:41,868 --> 00:04:44,495
I'm not saying I'll definitely open my mouth.

69
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:47,165
Honestly, I don't really like

70
00:04:47,165 --> 00:04:49,292
using such dirty methods either.

71
00:04:55,465 --> 00:04:57,217
What do you want?

72
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:02,513
The project files that Kwon Se-ah has.

73
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,474
What?

74
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,436
If you hand that over, I'll keep quiet.

75
00:05:08,436 --> 00:05:10,897
I'll guarantee your promotion too.

76
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,567
Ah, and there's a reward for this job.

77
00:05:15,068 --> 00:05:17,070
Are you serious...

78
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,698
I'm not saying you have to answer right now,

79
00:05:20,698 --> 00:05:24,535
so cool down and think about it slowly.

80
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,664
A project of that scale?

81
00:05:27,664 --> 00:05:29,958
Even if Kwon Se-ah takes it, she can never do it.

82
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,793
How could she do it alone?

83
00:05:36,798 --> 00:05:39,801
She said she's considering starting a startup, right?

84
00:05:42,387 --> 00:05:45,056
I'll even provide the capital for that.

85
00:05:45,974 --> 00:05:47,684
This is a win-win.

86
00:05:47,684 --> 00:05:48,935
Isn't it?
