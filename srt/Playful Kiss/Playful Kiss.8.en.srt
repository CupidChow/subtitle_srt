1
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,400
What were you looking at?

2
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,500
The street down there.

3
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,989
People walking by and the alley... it's fun.

4
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,466
It's refreshing.

5
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,166
We'll stay here, and then we'll find a new house. Even though it's uncomfortable, just bear with it for a little while.

6
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:32,900
I'm alright.

7
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,133
It's fine, and I really like this neighborhood.

8
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:39,433
Since it's an old neighborhood,and it's a little emotional.

9
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:40,500
That's right. it definitely seems homey.

10
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:44,533
Yup there is definitely

11
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:47,831
Let's go eat.

12
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:48,765
Yes.

13
00:02:05,866 --> 00:02:07,500
Ha Ni, you came down?

14
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:09,700
Yeah...

15
00:02:09,978 --> 00:02:13,366
Just wait a bit, I'll make it right away.

16
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:16,433
Here.

17
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,300
I knew you would come back!

18
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,966
I didn't know that we would be together this soon though.

19
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:30,800
You rascal, what do you mean by being together, huh?

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,533
Hey, give me a plate.

21
00:02:33,466 --> 00:02:36,900
Ha Ni this is called yeongbap. Come on and try it.

22
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,900
Father, we eat and breathe together both upstairs and downstairs. If it's not being together then what is it?

23
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:46,966
If you're going to keep drinking Kim Chi soup and make things chaotic then just leave!

24
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:52,000
Father, how could you say something so sad. I...

25
00:02:56,933 --> 00:02:57,966
Eat.

26
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,766
Should I open it for you?

27
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:22,733
Have a meal.

28
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:24,966
But I don't have any appetite.

29
00:03:24,966 --> 00:03:28,533
Don't just stay at home, go outside, take some photos.

30
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,566
And meet your friends.

31
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,633
Because you keep staying at home.

32
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:38,866
I don't even have anything I want to do.

33
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,133
Are you okay?
Isn't there anything wrong with you?

34
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,800
I'm great, very comfortable.

35
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,433
Comfortable?

36
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,400
What comfort are you talking about?

37
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,733
Not having anything you can't do?

38
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:04,466
Being eveything by yourself?

39
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,166
Isn't that why you were so quiet and suffocating in your own bubble?

40
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:15,766
Not going to DaeSun University, and going to Parang University, didn't you do that because you hated that comfort zone?

41
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:25,333
Please try this.

42
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:39,766
Our Ha Ni is so out of it right now that...

43
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,866
I'm a bit worried.

44
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:48,800
Don't you think I should cheer her up by giving her a call?

45
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,033
This late?

46
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:52,066
This rascal.

47
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:58,533
Ha Ni is the prettiest when she's smiling. I'm just saying this because she's always sad now.

48
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,600
I'll make her return to a smiling face at once...

49
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,433
Couldn't you allow us to go on a night date?

50
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:12,966
You can make her return to a smiling face?

51
00:05:12,966 --> 00:05:14,433
Ah, of course.

52
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,033
Will you allow it?

53
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:18,266
Then well...

54
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:21,233
Yes.

55
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,866
Ha Ni...

56
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,033
Not available to answer the call. After the beep....

57
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:53,566
For the time being, dad said to split up some of the house chores.

58
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:54,732
Really?

59
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,632
Hyung, you have the cleaning, dishwashing, and the cooking.

60
00:05:58,632 --> 00:05:59,566
What?!

61
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,300
I'm doing it all?

62
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,265
Should a young kid like me have to do it?

63
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:07,233
Dad has to go to work...

64
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:46,666
You're going to take the test tomorrow, right?

65
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,166
You can do everything.

66
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,666
You have to use your brains to benefit people.

67
00:06:57,633 --> 00:07:02,900
I think people who has a lot should share what he has.

68
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:09,733
Good luck on your test! FIGHTING!!

69
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:22,715
I thought that you would always live in that house.

70
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:26,680
You're losing your advantage little by little.

71
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,981
It's fine, I don't need it now.

72
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:33,489
I really gave up Baek Seung Jo.

73
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:34,089
What?

74
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:35,643
Really?

75
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:39,258
You, the one that was so stubborn?

76
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,732
I'm a different person now than I was before.

77
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,275
Now, I will look for a really

78
00:07:47,275 --> 00:07:48,694
cool boyfriend.

79
00:07:48,694 --> 00:07:50,294
Really?

80
00:07:51,977 --> 00:07:55,217
Good-bye, Baek Seung Jo.

81
00:07:59,553 --> 00:08:02,047
Hey! Let's go have lunch.

82
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,523
I came out without the dean knowing. I have to quickly eat and go back.

83
00:08:04,523 --> 00:08:06,548
Right. I'm hungry.

84
00:08:06,548 --> 00:08:09,520
I don't feel like it. You guys go ahead.

85
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:11,558
Oh Ha Ni.

86
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,841
Because you're being like this, you don't seem like the Oh Ha Ni I know.

87
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:17,392
Is it because you're afraid that if you go to the cafeteria you might meet Baek Seung Jo?

88
00:08:18,942 --> 00:08:21,139
If I see Seung Jo,

89
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:23,036
my heart might waver again.

90
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:27,033
Hey Oh Ha Ni. If you made your decision, then it's a good thing to run into him often.

91
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:28,574
That way you can build tolerance.

92
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,160
That's right! Dok Go Min Ah said something right.

93
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,443
Let's go. I'm hungry!
Let's go quickly!

94
00:08:33,443 --> 00:08:36,700
Let's go! Let's go!

95
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,000
Omo!

96
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,266
[Oh Ha Ni grew tired of Baek Seung Jo and broke up!]

97
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:04,425
It's now time for a lovely mood with Bong Joon Goo.

98
00:09:04,425 --> 00:09:06,733
Did you see above?

99
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:08,726
Please spread the word.

100
00:09:08,726 --> 00:09:12,051
Even if you see someone you don't know, tell them about it.

101
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:12,533
Next order!

102
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:14,959
- Gogi dub bap please
- Gogi dup bap right here

103
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,533
Hey Bong Joon Gu, what are you doing?!

104
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:19,233
Ha Ni, you came. What do you want to eat today?

105
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:21,900
The Gogi Dup Bap (meat on top of rice) is really good today. Eat that.

106
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,999
Hey Bong Joon Gu! I'm not in the mood to play around.

107
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:25,533
Hey Bong Joon Gu, you're causing an incident.

108
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:29,766
Hey Bong Joon Gu, what are you thinking? If Baek Seung Jo sees this, what will Ha Ni become?

109
00:09:29,766 --> 00:09:32,566
Baek Seung Jo? He already saw it.

110
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,133
He's over there.

111
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:35,900
What?!

112
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,033
This is completely cheesy.

113
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:46,066
I'd probably get sick of it too.

114
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:50,566
You must get really tired, Baek Seung Jo.

115
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:56,033
Is this possibly a struggle to change Baek Seung Jo's interests?

116
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:58,566
Hey girl! What did you just say?

117
00:09:58,566 --> 00:10:00,266
No.

118
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,566
I forgot Seung Jo.

119
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:06,266
Baek Seung Jo has nothing to do with me anymore.

120
00:10:07,466 --> 00:10:10,100
We don't live in one house anymore...

121
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:12,966
Just...

122
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:15,066
We're strangers now.

123
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,033
Our Ha Ni is speaking well!

124
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:24,466
Hey Baek Seung Jo, you heard right? You heard correctly right?

125
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:39,533
Ha Ni ah! You're not going to eat Gogi Dup Bap?

126
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:02,666
Hey Oh Ha Ni!

127
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:05,099
Why are you being so sluggish?

128
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:06,666
Hurry up and bring the balls.

129
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,866
I'm really tired. Just a little...

130
00:11:09,866 --> 00:11:13,600
What did you do that you're so tired? Stop talking and bring the balls.

131
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,766
Hurry!

132
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:18,066
Sunbaenim.

133
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:20,700
That racket...

134
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,400
Could you put it down when you talk?

135
00:11:24,233 --> 00:11:25,600
What?

136
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,533
It's nothing.

137
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:41,533
I heard you're still just picking up the balls.

138
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:42,800
Why... did you come?

139
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,633
Why would I have come?

140
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:46,533
I'm part of the staff here too.

141
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:48,933
No...

142
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:51,300
That's that.

143
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:58,400
I'm trying so hard to suppress my feelings. I'm not even attending classes.

144
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,733
But if you just come like this, what am I supposed to do?

145
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:02,933
Ha Ni ah. Ha Ni ah.

146
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:07,700
Seung Jo. You're here, I have something to say to you.

147
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:13,366
Next Friday and Saturday, our Top Spin Club is going on an MT for two nights and three days. Let's go together.

148
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:14,833
I don't want to.

149
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,466
Why?

150
00:12:16,466 --> 00:12:19,533
I came on the condition where I could come only if I wanted to.

151
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,966
Seung Jo ah.

152
00:12:27,866 --> 00:12:32,066
Since we're players, should we make a bet with a match?

153
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:35,866
If you win, you don't have to go. And if I win, you go.

154
00:12:35,866 --> 00:12:38,900
Let's go outside and have a game. What do you think about that ?

155
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,133
I don't care...

156
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:43,966
But will you really be okay?

157
00:12:43,966 --> 00:12:45,566
Ah brat.

158
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:48,033
I know that you play well.

159
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:51,366
Let's just try it for fun.

160
00:12:51,366 --> 00:12:54,233
Let's do a dual match. That sounds fun.

161
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:56,000
You and Ha Ni on one team.

162
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,066
-Pardon?
-Pardon?

163
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:03,166
Then I... uh...

164
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:07,666
Should I play with Yoon Hae Ra?

165
00:13:17,966 --> 00:13:19,833
Is your brother upstairs?

166
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,866
No.

167
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:24,900
He's not there. Where did he go?

168
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,966
He said he didn't have class today, so he was going to stay home and read.

169
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:32,733
Earlier, he was holding a tennis bag and left.

170
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:36,300
Ahh, he went to the Tennis Club.

171
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,900
Have you been well? Yeah I'm Seung Jo's mom.

172
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,466
I've gotten curious about something.

173
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:57,533
Do you know what club Ha Ni signed up for?

174
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,400
Oh my! Really?!

175
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:16,533
Oh excuse me. Where can I find the Tennis Club?

176
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:19,633
I came to meet a student named Oh Ha Ni.

177
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:23,533
You probably don't know Oh Ha Ni. The club's name is Top Spin.

178
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:25,400
Ah Oh Ha Ni?

179
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,000
Oh my! You know Oh Ha Ni?

180
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,433
Something about her breaking up with Baek Seung Jo... there was some commotion at the cafeteria.

181
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:32,700
Oh my, what?!

182
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,066
What kind of rumor is that?

183
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:35,400
That is all a lie!

184
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,933
Baek Seung Jo and Oh Ha Ni will never break up.

185
00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:40,200
Those two people are doing fine!

186
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,766
You students tell the others too!

187
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:44,200
But then, who are you ma'am??

188
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,066
Who's that lady?

189
00:14:47,946 --> 00:14:52,014
Excuse me. Where should I go to find the Tennis Club?

190
00:14:52,014 --> 00:14:53,481
Ah wait a min...

191
00:14:55,481 --> 00:14:57,448
Possibly, Seung Jo's mother?

192
00:14:57,448 --> 00:15:00,214
Ah I was right! Hello.

193
00:15:00,214 --> 00:15:03,514
Oh Joo Ri, Min Ah! Nice to see you!

194
00:15:03,514 --> 00:15:06,814
What's going on? Wearing those kinds of clothes...

195
00:15:06,814 --> 00:15:10,581
Oh, I was trying to disguise. Does it show??

196
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:13,281
It's very obvious.

197
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:16,014
Did you come to watch Ha Ni play tennis?

198
00:15:17,148 --> 00:15:19,813
When you watch the Wimbledon matches,

199
00:15:19,813 --> 00:15:23,581
Sharapova wears those white tennis uniforms.

200
00:15:25,014 --> 00:15:26,481
And she does the swishing!

201
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:30,748
Imagining Ha Ni do that, could I just sit at home?

202
00:15:30,748 --> 00:15:33,648
Where are they playing? Let's hurry up and go watch.

203
00:15:33,648 --> 00:15:36,614
I think the practice is over now.

204
00:15:36,614 --> 00:15:37,614
It's over?

205
00:15:37,614 --> 00:15:42,548
Later tonight, Ha Ni and Seung Jo will be playing tennis on one team.

206
00:15:42,548 --> 00:15:44,581
What's up with being on the same side as Seung Jo?

207
00:15:44,581 --> 00:15:48,814
Yeah. Ha Ni is desperately trying to forget Seung Jo.

208
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,281
Oh my. What are you talking about?

209
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:56,514
Actually, I thought everything was going to be okay between Ha Ni and Seung Jo.

210
00:15:56,514 --> 00:15:59,148
I thought that way too. Think about it.

211
00:15:59,148 --> 00:16:01,546
After graduation, they...

212
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:03,714
They even kissed.

213
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:05,881
What?!

214
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,314
KISS!!!

215
00:16:07,314 --> 00:16:10,679
That was on the night of graduation.

216
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:13,748
And, Baek Seung Jo did it first!

217
00:16:17,781 --> 00:16:19,348
Awesome!

218
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,214
Seung Jo, really!

219
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,381
After doing that... why?!

220
00:16:26,414 --> 00:16:27,946
I've made my decision.

221
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:31,314
I'm going to have Ha Ni back at our house.

222
00:16:31,314 --> 00:16:34,581
Even if Seung Jo says something, it doesn't matter.

223
00:16:35,513 --> 00:16:37,881
They even kissed.

224
00:16:51,614 --> 00:16:54,948
We're going to lose anyways. So just tell them you're going to the MT.

225
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:56,948
You're saying to give up now?

226
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,214
Listen carefully.

227
00:17:00,214 --> 00:17:03,846
You just run the opposite way from the ball.

228
00:17:03,846 --> 00:17:05,048
Don't get in my way.

229
00:17:05,048 --> 00:17:06,381
Understood?

230
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:26,047
Just pretend that I'm not here

231
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:29,136
Don't serve me any balls, okay?

232
00:17:30,188 --> 00:17:33,694
I want to go with Seung Jo to the MT.

233
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:36,185
So I don't intend to go easy on you.

234
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:38,586
Show me what you've got.

235
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,671
PLAY.

236
00:17:48,194 --> 00:17:49,625
I told you to not get in my way!

237
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,859
Sorry.

238
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:53,609
0 - 15

239
00:17:58,159 --> 00:17:59,832
Ah, come on!

240
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,571
Hey! Don't come, don't come.

241
00:18:17,926 --> 00:18:20,382
Advantage. Wang Kyung Su and Yoon Hae Ra.

242
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:25,565
This time, if we don't get the point.

243
00:18:25,565 --> 00:18:27,409
It will be the game set.

244
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:30,274
Keep your mind on the game Oh Ha Ni. Got it?

245
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:36,218
Then, this is the last one.

246
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,710
Game set. Wang Kyung Soo and Yoon Hae Ra's win.

247
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,223
Yes! We won, we won!

248
00:18:48,223 --> 00:18:49,198
That punk!

249
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,186
Thank you Oh Ha Ni.

250
00:18:57,186 --> 00:18:58,886
Thanks to you, ever since the day I was born,

251
00:18:58,886 --> 00:19:01,417
this is the first time I ever lost.

252
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:03,244
Feels very refreshing.

253
00:19:03,244 --> 00:19:04,639
I'm sorry.

254
00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:06,861
That's why, from the start...

255
00:19:06,861 --> 00:19:08,633
Aigoo, Mr. Baek Seung Jo

256
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:11,009
Oh, your pride must have been hurt a lot.

257
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:13,609
Is this the first time you've lost?

258
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:16,319
I'd like to pay you back sometime.

259
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,132
Really?

260
00:19:17,132 --> 00:19:19,616
I'm cool, whenever you want.

261
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:25,142
However, we'll stay teamed the same way we are now.

262
00:19:25,142 --> 00:19:28,316
How about having it when we go on the MT?

263
00:19:28,316 --> 00:19:29,670
Huh?

264
00:19:30,964 --> 00:19:32,759
But the MT is next week.

265
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:38,013
Right, no matter how much of a genius you might be, 1 week is pushing it.... right?

266
00:19:38,013 --> 00:19:40,305
Fine. Let's try it out.

267
00:19:41,886 --> 00:19:44,949
On the last day of the MT. Call

268
00:19:45,546 --> 00:19:46,783
Call!

269
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,595
We have only one week.

270
00:20:04,006 --> 00:20:07,356
After one week, we'll win, for sure.

271
00:20:07,356 --> 00:20:08,796
Do you understand?

272
00:20:10,134 --> 00:20:11,134
Does that make any sense?

273
00:20:11,134 --> 00:20:13,161
When did you ever know what makes sense or not?

274
00:20:13,858 --> 00:20:16,782
When you asked me to raise you to the top 50 students,

275
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,664
Where'd that attitude go?

276
00:20:34,188 --> 00:20:37,612
Now, spread your legs shoulder width apart.

277
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:40,884
A little more, Yeah. Now lower your stance.

278
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,495
Good.

279
00:22:12,612 --> 00:22:15,492
She's really trying her best.

280
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:18,726
I mean Oh Ha Ni.

281
00:22:18,726 --> 00:22:22,109
Even so, what can you do with only one week?!

282
00:22:22,713 --> 00:22:25,435
Well, it's fun.

283
00:22:25,435 --> 00:22:28,100
Oh Ha Ni has the joy of raising /teaching.

284
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,263
Joy of raising/ teaching?

285
00:22:29,263 --> 00:22:34,846
She's amazing. It's like if she puts her mind into something and works hard, she can achieve it.

286
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:37,434
Certainly,

287
00:22:37,852 --> 00:22:40,753
That's because you're good at everything without having to make an effort,

288
00:22:40,753 --> 00:22:44,468
and having to work to death to accomplish something,

289
00:22:44,468 --> 00:22:45,692
you don't know anything about it.

290
00:22:45,692 --> 00:22:47,280
You're like that too.

291
00:22:48,717 --> 00:22:50,252
You're right.

292
00:23:25,453 --> 00:23:27,752
Follow the ball until the end.

293
00:23:31,437 --> 00:23:33,720
To the right, to the right.

294
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:43,472
Keep your eyes on it until the end.

295
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:46,885
No matter how hard I try I keep closing my eyes, so I can't see.
What can I do?!

296
00:23:47,657 --> 00:23:50,415
I said No! How many times do I need to tell you that.

297
00:23:50,415 --> 00:23:51,645
Father,

298
00:23:51,645 --> 00:23:52,899
Please think about it.

299
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:56,034
If they stay for 3 nights and 2 days, something's bound to happen, right?

300
00:23:57,961 --> 00:23:59,812
If you let me have a break...

301
00:23:59,812 --> 00:24:01,182
I can plan everything out.

302
00:24:01,182 --> 00:24:02,187
Hey!

303
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:05,593
How long are you just going to chase her?

304
00:24:05,593 --> 00:24:08,176
Don't just chase her.

305
00:24:08,176 --> 00:24:10,570
Can't you make Ha Ni come to you?

306
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:13,472
You need to have respect.

307
00:24:13,472 --> 00:24:15,980
Because you follow her around so crazily,

308
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,045
That's why she's not acknowledging you!

309
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,017
Hurry up and go finish what needs to be done in the kitchen.

310
00:24:27,377 --> 00:24:30,841
HEY! Change that hairstyle of yours!

311
00:24:30,841 --> 00:24:35,578
That-little- thing- That's not Ha Ni's style!

312
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,404
What am I really?

313
00:24:57,404 --> 00:25:00,955
Even though my resolution was firm...

314
00:25:00,955 --> 00:25:05,810
just thinking about spending 3 days and 2 nights with Baek Seung Jo...

315
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:10,500
my heart is fluttering.

316
00:25:11,258 --> 00:25:13,472
What to do?

317
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,934
This isn't right.

318
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,175
Ha Ni!

319
00:25:25,175 --> 00:25:28,217
Ah, Joon Gu. You came early.

320
00:25:29,515 --> 00:25:31,027
Here, take this with you.

321
00:25:31,027 --> 00:25:32,466
What is it?

322
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,648
It's a lunch box.

323
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,459
Joon Gu.

324
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:39,284
You have to remember,

325
00:25:39,284 --> 00:25:41,249
I am your home.

326
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:41,731
Home?

327
00:25:41,731 --> 00:25:42,753
Right.

328
00:25:42,753 --> 00:25:45,353
A home that will always be there for you no matter what.

329
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,021
It's still there after you've partied so much, and even

330
00:25:50,021 --> 00:25:52,157
after you've sobbed because things are so tough and then you come home.

331
00:25:52,157 --> 00:25:55,338
The thing that always stays the same, your home.

332
00:25:56,337 --> 00:25:59,773
Hurry up and go.
Be sure to come back safely.
Don't hurt yourself.

333
00:26:00,586 --> 00:26:03,419
Thank you.
I'll eat it well.

334
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:04,487
Right.

335
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:10,524
Joon Gu!

336
00:26:10,524 --> 00:26:12,405
Thank you.

337
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:28,241
Aish! This really isn't my style.

338
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:31,283
It's really tough to earn respect.

339
00:26:31,283 --> 00:26:32,815
Respect....

340
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,434
Ah, Sunbaenim!

341
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:45,361
You rascals... look at the way you're dressed.

342
00:26:45,361 --> 00:26:48,117
The MT of our tennis club...

343
00:26:48,117 --> 00:26:49,742
is for us to reside on campus...

344
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:52,754
and undergo special training.
It's a tradition.

345
00:26:55,315 --> 00:26:57,823
Be quiet.

346
00:27:00,006 --> 00:27:02,374
Starting now, I'll give you 5 minutes

347
00:27:02,374 --> 00:27:04,487
Go back and drop your stuff at the clubroom.

348
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:05,912
And then meet here again.

349
00:27:05,912 --> 00:27:07,970
Some people are not here yet,

350
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,735
Once everyone is here,

351
00:27:09,735 --> 00:27:10,696
We'll do it.

352
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:11,592
What?

353
00:27:12,335 --> 00:27:13,954
Who hasn't showed up yet?

354
00:27:13,954 --> 00:27:17,003
Baek Seung Jo,Yoon Hae Ra and Oh Ha Ni.

355
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:22,250
Fine.
Baek Seung Jo and Yoon Hae Ra

356
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,735
Are special members so that's okay,

357
00:27:24,735 --> 00:27:26,360
But Oh Ha NI?

358
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,450
What's with that punk?

359
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:34,789
Omo! Hello.

360
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:35,207
Yes.

361
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,950
It's a little idle right now.

362
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,771
Before the customers start coming for dinner...

363
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:47,083
Please take a seat.

364
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,350
Ah but...

365
00:27:58,255 --> 00:28:04,485
People like Ha Ni always ride these. It was so cute to me.

366
00:28:04,485 --> 00:28:08,016
So I bought one, but it doesn't fit in my car.

367
00:28:08,255 --> 00:28:09,988
I just brought it here.

368
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:14,583
Tell Ha Ni to ride it.

369
00:28:16,784 --> 00:28:19,617
I'm not sure if it's okay to keep receiving things.

370
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:21,923
If you don't take it, then it's not okay.

371
00:28:24,183 --> 00:28:25,916
And...

372
00:28:26,216 --> 00:28:27,583
Your mail...

373
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,216
Ah thank you.

374
00:28:29,816 --> 00:28:34,083
I haven't been able to change the address yet. I'm sorry.

375
00:28:35,523 --> 00:28:36,816
Do you like it?

376
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,783
Just the two of you living together?

377
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,183
What?

378
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,050
Ah well.

379
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:46,416
I got a disease... depression.

380
00:28:47,086 --> 00:28:49,783
It's pretty serious.

381
00:28:49,983 --> 00:28:52,150
I heard from Soo Chang.

382
00:28:53,750 --> 00:29:00,150
Before Ha Ni came, at our house, the person who talked and made mistakes...

383
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,716
I was the only one.

384
00:29:02,716 --> 00:29:09,383
Seung Jo and Eun Jo... they don't have that type of personality. And my husband is busy.

385
00:29:09,383 --> 00:29:12,783
If I don't laugh, our house turns into a depressing hole.

386
00:29:14,183 --> 00:29:19,183
But when Ha Ni came, I liked it so much. It felt like I was living.

387
00:29:19,183 --> 00:29:20,783
I was happy.

388
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:26,451
Would it be okay to live together again?

389
00:29:26,855 --> 00:29:29,350
You haven't changed your address yet.

390
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,716
I thought about it a lot.

391
00:29:34,716 --> 00:29:37,783
Maybe I'm being too selfish.

392
00:29:37,783 --> 00:29:43,183
That I'll be the only one that's happy. She seemed like the perfect match for Seung Jo.

393
00:29:43,183 --> 00:29:45,515
Maybe I'm being too greedy.

394
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,183
But...

395
00:29:48,183 --> 00:29:51,883
I feel like Ha Ni will be sad alone too.

396
00:29:52,316 --> 00:30:00,283
Actually I was waiting for that too. But now they're all in college, and if Seung Jo gets a new girlfriend...

397
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,616
Rather than having a hard time moving after getting close to everyone...

398
00:30:06,116 --> 00:30:09,450
I thought it might be better to hurt a little bit right now.

399
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:11,983
To Ha Ni...

400
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:24,383
We'll start tomorrow at 6:00AM. In the morning we'll swing. In the afternoon we'll learn how to top spin.

401
00:30:24,383 --> 00:30:30,616
To the people who think we're going on the MT to have fun, it's a good idea to reset that mindset.

402
00:30:32,283 --> 00:30:41,216
Here here here. It's time to rest. We'll all rest and after an hour, let's meet at the front court.

403
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,483
Good work.

404
00:30:49,783 --> 00:30:51,316
Yah Han Ni ah.
Come here.

405
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:57,283
You don't need to come to the evening training.

406
00:30:57,783 --> 00:30:58,916
Why?

407
00:30:58,916 --> 00:31:01,650
You're in charge of the dinner now.

408
00:31:02,383 --> 00:31:03,716
By myself?

409
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:11,550
You were tardy this morning. Think of it as a punishment and go make dinner.
It's better off this way. You don't have to train.

410
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,650
Wait a second.

411
00:31:13,116 --> 00:31:14,683
Then what about the match on the last day?

412
00:31:14,683 --> 00:31:17,216
Oh that? Of course we have to do that, since I promised.

413
00:31:17,216 --> 00:31:21,883
How can you put her in charge of the food? She needs to train more than the others.

414
00:31:21,883 --> 00:31:25,116
That's your problem. She was tardy though.

415
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:28,816
Are you not letting her practice because you think you might lose?

416
00:31:28,816 --> 00:31:30,150
Sunbae (Senior)

417
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:32,050
You have that low of confidence?

418
00:31:33,283 --> 00:31:37,583
Ah.. that...

419
00:31:41,016 --> 00:31:42,250
Hurry up with the food.

420
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,916
So we can train with the time leftover. I told you...

421
00:31:45,216 --> 00:31:47,950
The match after tomorrow, we have to win.

422
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,783
It'll probably be tiring... by yourself.

423
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,283
You're not saying that you'll help me.

424
00:32:00,816 --> 00:32:03,283
I don't really like cooking.

425
00:32:04,816 --> 00:32:07,283
I have something to say.

426
00:32:07,283 --> 00:32:11,316
You might have already noticed, but I'm interested in Seung Jo.

427
00:32:12,016 --> 00:32:15,150
So I'm going to tell Seung Jo this time.

428
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:17,350
It should be okay, right?

429
00:32:19,216 --> 00:32:21,050
Why are you asking me?

430
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,383
I'm not sure.

431
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:27,250
I keep feeling like I'm taking candy from a baby.

432
00:32:28,116 --> 00:32:29,250
What?

433
00:32:29,383 --> 00:32:31,816
Ah, it's not that.

434
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:33,850
I'm fine.

435
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,183
Really?

436
00:32:36,116 --> 00:32:37,683
I feel better then.

437
00:32:37,683 --> 00:32:39,116
Then work hard.

438
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:55,150
There's no end to this peeling.

439
00:32:57,216 --> 00:32:58,283
Ah hot.

440
00:32:59,116 --> 00:33:00,350
Yah Oh Ha Ni

441
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:03,716
Do you still have a lot left? If you keep going slow like that, there won't be any time to practice.

442
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:05,616
Seung Jo ah.

443
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,850
Baek Seung Jo.

444
00:33:09,816 --> 00:33:11,550
Help me.

445
00:33:11,916 --> 00:33:13,716
I need to hurry up and finish so I can practice.

446
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,616
Sesame oil.

447
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:39,383
Yes!

448
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,516
Yah Yah Yah!
Stop.

449
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,450
Ground red pepper.

450
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,616
Yes.

451
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,383
Put in a little bit.

452
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,550
I said just put in just a little.

453
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:19,183
Woah. It looks so good.

454
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:24,083
Who made this? It looks so good!

455
00:34:25,483 --> 00:34:26,683
Please sit down.

456
00:34:26,683 --> 00:34:31,550
Ha Ni, did you do this? You're really great.

457
00:34:32,683 --> 00:34:35,016
You can get married now. What is all this?

458
00:34:35,016 --> 00:34:37,316
It looks so delicious Ha Ni.

459
00:34:37,316 --> 00:34:40,016
Woah it's really good, it's really good! Try it, try it!

460
00:34:40,016 --> 00:34:41,550
What is this?

461
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,483
This is quite good.

462
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:46,350
It's shrimp! So good!

463
00:34:46,916 --> 00:34:48,416
Try this. It's really good.

464
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:51,716
Yah Baek Seung Jo.

465
00:34:51,716 --> 00:34:54,250
What are you? Give her some compliments.

466
00:34:56,316 --> 00:35:00,083
Seung Jo, he's very picky.

467
00:35:10,683 --> 00:35:11,650
Oh Ha Ni.

468
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,516
Let's go practice.

469
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:19,616
I wonder if the kids are doing okay.

470
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:24,783
It would be nice if they got closer so that she can come back.

471
00:35:24,783 --> 00:35:30,150
We spent all that time together. How can Seung Jo be so cold?

472
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:37,850
I didn't notice it when they were here. But since Ha Ni is gone, the house seems empty and no fun.

473
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,250
You think that way too, don't you?

474
00:35:41,216 --> 00:35:42,283
Honey,

475
00:35:42,283 --> 00:35:46,150
Can we ask Ki Dong shi to come live with us again?

476
00:35:49,283 --> 00:35:52,283
Should I meet Ki Dong once then?

477
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,816
Honey, thank you so much.

478
00:35:55,816 --> 00:35:58,216
Even if we live together again,

479
00:35:58,216 --> 00:36:01,750
I'm not going to give up my room. Definitely not.

480
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:07,416
1, 2

481
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:07,916
3

482
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:11,583
1, 2

483
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,916
Keep your back straight

484
00:36:15,116 --> 00:36:17,816
Keeps your hips straight. And your butt too.

485
00:36:17,816 --> 00:36:19,783
Ah I can't do this.

486
00:36:19,783 --> 00:36:20,550
Yah
Get up.

487
00:36:21,383 --> 00:36:22,783
Get up.

488
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:24,450
Yah!

489
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,083
Get up.

490
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:25,850
Quickly.

491
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:37,716
Get up.

492
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,816
Swing.

493
00:36:40,016 --> 00:36:41,183
To the outside.

494
00:36:41,316 --> 00:36:42,416
Back hand.

495
00:36:44,016 --> 00:36:44,950
One more time.

496
00:37:12,338 --> 00:37:14,083
What are you doing? Let's do it again.

497
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:29,301
Baek Seung Jo!

498
00:38:32,321 --> 00:38:34,715
You missed the afternoon training yesterday.

499
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:38,748
Without catching up first, don't do anything else.

500
00:38:38,748 --> 00:38:40,191
Will it be okay?

501
00:38:40,848 --> 00:38:41,915
You'll probably regret.

502
00:38:41,915 --> 00:38:42,381
What?

503
00:38:42,381 --> 00:38:47,993
Then maybe I should go buy some ramen.

504
00:39:16,084 --> 00:39:18,156
Ha Ni ah. What happened with this?

505
00:39:18,336 --> 00:39:24,706
Even though it looks like that, the taste should be okay.

506
00:39:24,706 --> 00:39:25,609
Really?

507
00:39:31,348 --> 00:39:32,348
Jong Suk.

508
00:39:32,848 --> 00:39:34,081
You eat one.

509
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:34,848
Yes?

510
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:36,848
Try one.

511
00:39:46,915 --> 00:39:50,848
Where did the Dae Jang Geum from yesterday go?

512
00:39:53,581 --> 00:39:55,215
I'm sorry.

513
00:39:55,715 --> 00:40:00,350
-Actually, I didn't make it yesterday.
-Then who made it?

514
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:04,948
You were the only one who missed the evening training.

515
00:40:05,248 --> 00:40:07,748
Ah!
Baek Seung Jo.

516
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:08,868
Huh?

517
00:40:09,048 --> 00:40:10,015
Seung Jo?

518
00:40:22,348 --> 00:40:23,311
Good job!

519
00:40:23,311 --> 00:40:24,333
Doing a good job!

520
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:58,380
Ah, you came?

521
00:41:09,148 --> 00:41:10,849
What are you doing Oh Ha Ni...

522
00:41:10,849 --> 00:41:13,124
What are you going to do by following them?

523
00:41:24,948 --> 00:41:29,881
No, I'm not following them. I'm just getting fresh air.

524
00:41:33,615 --> 00:41:36,248
What? Is there something you wanted to tell me?

525
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:45,581
I don't know what to say..this isn't my usual style.

526
00:41:45,781 --> 00:41:49,481
I was second when I entered the school

527
00:41:50,148 --> 00:41:52,848
I also applied to lower school than the ones that I could go.

528
00:41:53,748 --> 00:41:55,481
There were some circumstances.

529
00:41:55,481 --> 00:41:56,648
Is that so?

530
00:42:04,615 --> 00:42:06,315
I like you.

531
00:42:09,615 --> 00:42:10,515
And you?

532
00:42:11,715 --> 00:42:13,015
How do you feel?

533
00:42:29,915 --> 00:42:32,448
Hey.

534
00:42:36,815 --> 00:42:37,948
What are you doing?

535
00:42:37,948 --> 00:42:40,181
What are you doing? Watching them.

536
00:42:40,181 --> 00:42:44,315
Possibly, do you like Hae Ra?

537
00:42:44,315 --> 00:42:45,015
Shh!

538
00:42:59,681 --> 00:43:03,648
From the looks of it, this seems fun. However, I'm sorry but...

539
00:43:04,215 --> 00:43:08,281
I'm going to borrow her since we have a match tomorrow.

540
00:43:08,915 --> 00:43:11,248
Huh? Oh okay take her.

541
00:43:15,115 --> 00:43:18,848
You're doing good. In a position that can't even serve.

542
00:43:19,928 --> 00:43:20,748
That's not it.

543
00:43:20,748 --> 00:43:23,715
Come! We're going to practice until you get it right.

544
00:44:14,881 --> 00:44:20,115
Oh Ha Ni is really working hard. Right?

545
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:40,348
You're alright?

546
00:44:40,348 --> 00:44:42,248
Yes, I'm alright.

547
00:44:49,615 --> 00:44:52,215
Good Job. You succeeded.

548
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:56,148
The speed of your serve was pretty fast too.

549
00:44:57,014 --> 00:44:58,614
It works if I do it like this?

550
00:44:58,614 --> 00:45:00,814
Yeah... You did well.

551
00:45:02,414 --> 00:45:03,848
He smiled.

552
00:45:03,848 --> 00:45:07,281
Baek Seung Jo looked at me and smiled.

553
00:45:09,348 --> 00:45:11,948
To see that smiling face.

554
00:45:11,948 --> 00:45:13,848
"Good Job."

555
00:45:14,314 --> 00:45:16,114
To hear him say that...

556
00:45:22,148 --> 00:45:23,214
Did you get hurt?

557
00:45:23,814 --> 00:45:24,548
Huh?

558
00:45:24,548 --> 00:45:26,414
No.

559
00:45:32,614 --> 00:45:34,048
You are hurt.

560
00:45:35,448 --> 00:45:38,948
Well, it isn't Oh Ha Ni to just fall (and not cause trouble).

561
00:45:42,048 --> 00:45:43,081
What is it?

562
00:45:44,714 --> 00:45:48,581
We'll forfeit the doubles we were going to do later.

563
00:45:48,581 --> 00:45:49,181
Huh?

564
00:45:49,181 --> 00:45:50,714
Injury.

565
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:52,514
No, we have to do it.

566
00:45:52,514 --> 00:45:53,814
How can you do it like this?

567
00:45:54,114 --> 00:45:55,681
You can't even get up.

568
00:45:55,681 --> 00:45:56,814
But still.

569
00:45:57,581 --> 00:45:59,781
You said we have to win...

570
00:46:01,448 --> 00:46:03,681
I practiced really hard.

571
00:46:03,681 --> 00:46:05,114
With your feet?

572
00:46:06,981 --> 00:46:09,648
It's fine. There's nothing we can do about it.

573
00:46:11,648 --> 00:46:12,814
I'm sorry...

574
00:46:13,317 --> 00:46:17,181
-Because of me...
-I wasn't even counting on winning anyways.

575
00:46:18,714 --> 00:46:20,114
Get on.

576
00:46:31,314 --> 00:46:32,648
Hey! Baek Seung Jo!

577
00:46:34,248 --> 00:46:36,881
You have to play the match you promised. How can you just go?

578
00:46:37,148 --> 00:46:39,581
Do we have to do the game now?

579
00:46:39,581 --> 00:46:44,348
Let's set up another one soon. Today, as you can see...

580
00:47:25,496 --> 00:47:28,496
Omo! You look so cool!

581
00:47:28,496 --> 00:47:30,263
Huh? Woah.

582
00:47:30,263 --> 00:47:33,296
Ah. Who are you?

583
00:47:33,296 --> 00:47:35,263
It's a little awkward.

584
00:47:35,263 --> 00:47:36,677
You look like a different person.

585
00:47:36,677 --> 00:47:37,930
Yeah totally! You should have done it sooner.

586
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:39,230
What happened to your hair?

587
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:42,163
I cut it.

588
00:47:50,763 --> 00:47:53,996
Who is that?
Is it Seung Jo?

589
00:47:57,296 --> 00:48:00,763
What's going on?
What's going on?
She got hurt?

590
00:48:00,763 --> 00:48:01,596
Ha Ni!

591
00:48:01,596 --> 00:48:04,063
Where? Where did you get hurt?

592
00:48:04,063 --> 00:48:06,963
It seems she hurt her leg.

593
00:48:06,963 --> 00:48:10,663
Sit down, sit down!

594
00:48:10,663 --> 00:48:13,225
While training, she twisted her ankle.

595
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:16,296
Try using an ankle brace

596
00:48:16,296 --> 00:48:19,830
It'll be a good idea to keep it on for 6 weeks.

597
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,896
A half cast?
Alright.

598
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,730
You look different.

599
00:48:28,596 --> 00:48:30,330
What are you talking about, environment?

600
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:32,763
Can you say something like that right now?

601
00:48:32,763 --> 00:48:34,496
Bringing someone who was healthy home like this

602
00:48:34,496 --> 00:48:36,263
That's not it.

603
00:48:36,263 --> 00:48:40,730
It was my fault that I got hurt.
So don't say that.

604
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:42,030
That's right.

605
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:46,596
I guess If you say so.

606
00:48:46,896 --> 00:48:50,363
I get it. I'll keep my mouth shut.

607
00:49:01,172 --> 00:49:07,062
Ha Ni really didn't say anything about you changing your style?

608
00:49:07,896 --> 00:49:10,730
That's because she was with Baek Seung Jo.

609
00:49:11,763 --> 00:49:14,996
You're so pitiful!

610
00:49:16,196 --> 00:49:20,230
Though, your hair looks great!

611
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:24,896
I think so too! You look like a totally different person. You should have done this sooner!

612
00:49:24,896 --> 00:49:29,063
Hey, do you know? Ha Ni really likes this style.

613
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:32,396
He said she didn't notice.

614
00:50:34,863 --> 00:50:38,063
Ha Ni. Here eat!

615
00:50:38,063 --> 00:50:40,930
Eat this too. It's a boiled egg.

616
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:42,163
What about the other people?

617
00:50:42,163 --> 00:50:44,230
It's okay.

618
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:45,563
Thank you Joon Gu. I'll eat well.

619
00:50:45,563 --> 00:50:46,930
Okay.

620
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:16,629
Ha Ni, I'm really doing my best.

621
00:51:16,629 --> 00:51:18,230
Do you know?

622
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:31,496
So, in other words, what 'Dogma 95' means is

623
00:51:31,496 --> 00:51:36,196
to reveal the personal tastes or techniques of the movie from the very beginning.

624
00:51:36,196 --> 00:51:42,196
Like the first statement says, "All things are not studio but location."

625
00:51:42,196 --> 00:51:44,430
We take it from a realistic perspective.

626
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:48,896
So, from all these three perspectives, location, sound, and art,

627
00:51:48,896 --> 00:51:52,730
it basically means that anything artificial and technical shall be removed.

628
00:51:56,230 --> 00:52:00,096
Without even knowing, I ended up coming here.

629
00:52:01,563 --> 00:52:03,930
Since I already came,

630
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:07,763
How about I catch a little look of his face?

631
00:52:17,796 --> 00:52:19,696
Seung Jo.

632
00:52:19,696 --> 00:52:21,663
How about we go see a movie today?

633
00:52:21,663 --> 00:52:24,063
There is a movie I really want to see.

634
00:52:24,063 --> 00:52:27,196
What do you think? After watching it we can go __________.

635
00:52:27,196 --> 00:52:31,130
Okay, sounds good, I've been wanting to get out anyway.

636
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:49,730
Popcorn and two sodas.

637
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:52,130
It's 7000 won.

638
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:53,830
Let me pay.

639
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:59,730
I dreamed about going on a date together since freshman year of high school.

640
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:03,996
I would even have a fashion show the night before to pick out clothes to wear.

641
00:53:03,996 --> 00:53:08,930
Watch a movie, and when it ends go window shopping together.

642
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:12,563
Then sit together at a coffee shop and chat.

643
00:53:13,196 --> 00:53:16,896
All of that he's doing with Yoon Hae Ra.

644
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,000
I'm sorry.

645
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,733
Ha Ni! What are you doing here?

646
00:53:30,733 --> 00:53:32,867
Sunbae!

647
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:36,067
You... You!

648
00:53:36,067 --> 00:53:38,167
Sunbae you too.

649
00:53:43,767 --> 00:53:45,433
Ha Ni.

650
00:53:45,979 --> 00:53:49,433
You like Seung Jo, right? I know.

651
00:53:49,433 --> 00:53:53,667
And that's right, I like Hae Ra.

652
00:53:53,667 --> 00:53:58,233
But Hae Ra likes Seung Jo. Don't you think that's wrong too?

653
00:53:58,233 --> 00:54:02,067
That's why, you and I should collaborate.

654
00:54:02,067 --> 00:54:03,604
Collaborate?

655
00:54:03,604 --> 00:54:09,300
First, since we don't really have anything planned... we'll follow them...

656
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:15,233
When we get a chance, or if it gets dangerous we can leave.

657
00:54:15,233 --> 00:54:16,667
That's a little...

658
00:54:16,667 --> 00:54:18,133
What's a little?

659
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:24,433
Then did we come out just to watch them have fun together?

660
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:32,467
Anyways, does Seung Jo... does he have fast hands?

661
00:54:32,467 --> 00:54:35,833
Huh? What are you talking about?

662
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:40,635
Ah touching. Skinship. This kind of stuff.

663
00:54:41,767 --> 00:54:43,767
I'm not sure.

664
00:54:44,933 --> 00:54:47,500
I don't think it's like that.

665
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,384
He doesn't like doing those...

666
00:54:50,384 --> 00:54:52,033
Not interested...?

667
00:54:53,417 --> 00:54:55,700
That's because it's you.

668
00:54:55,700 --> 00:55:02,167
I don't think it'll be easy for Seung Jo to hold it in with someone as sexy as Hae Ra.

669
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:05,933
I love you.

670
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:11,267
I love you.

671
00:55:14,467 --> 00:55:17,800
This is me saying this.

672
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,733
So...

673
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:26,167
Like I said, these are my feelings.

674
00:55:27,233 --> 00:55:29,800
It's not a dream or anything, but...

675
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:34,500
Please don't let anything happen in this dark place.

676
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:56,900
I heard those two were engaged in real life.

677
00:56:19,467 --> 00:56:21,433
Aigoo.

678
00:56:21,433 --> 00:56:25,100
Aigoo. I'm so sorry.

679
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,867
You did well!

680
00:56:56,333 --> 00:56:57,433
I'm sorry.

681
00:56:57,433 --> 00:56:59,200
That brat... where is he puttng that hand?

682
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,900
-Ah really.
-Thanks.

683
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,400
What am I doing?

684
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:18,533
Sneaking around on someone else's date, planning to intrude.

685
00:57:18,533 --> 00:57:21,933
I just got to see them get along in the end.

686
00:57:21,933 --> 00:57:25,167
Ha Ni, they're going that way. Let's go quickly.

687
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,533
What is it?

688
00:57:33,233 --> 00:57:35,300
I'm thinking about stopping.

689
00:57:36,667 --> 00:57:38,900
What are you talking about?

690
00:57:39,667 --> 00:57:42,300
I can't watch anymore.

691
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:43,933
It's too difficult.

692
00:57:43,933 --> 00:57:46,933
Ah, what's wrong all of a sudden?

693
00:57:46,933 --> 00:57:51,467
We have to go, what if they make a move?

694
00:57:52,033 --> 00:57:58,667
If they like each other, there's nothing we can do.

695
00:58:00,633 --> 00:58:02,967
I've realized that now.

696
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:12,200
Then, are you saying that you're going to acknowledge them doing that?

697
00:58:14,333 --> 00:58:19,967
I don't wan't to be made a fool of anymore.

698
00:58:25,167 --> 00:58:27,300
Aish!

699
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,767
I'm so sorry!

700
00:58:29,767 --> 00:58:31,733
How am I supposed to get rid of it?

701
00:58:31,733 --> 00:58:34,600
I have to go meet my girlfriend right now!

702
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:37,200
Do you know how much this is?

703
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,867
I'll give you the money for dry cleaning.

704
00:58:38,867 --> 00:58:41,633
Yes, the money for dry cleaning.

705
00:58:41,633 --> 00:58:42,667
Dry cleaning money?

706
00:58:42,667 --> 00:58:45,567
Yes. How much...?

707
00:58:51,367 --> 00:58:55,567
Ah, she's my hoobae. I'll give it to you.

708
00:58:55,567 --> 00:58:57,767
Right here. 10,000 won.($10)

709
00:58:57,767 --> 00:58:59,733
Are you playing around right now?

710
00:58:59,733 --> 00:59:01,100
Huh?

711
00:59:01,967 --> 00:59:05,233
100,000 won?($100)

712
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,733
Oh. Why are you being like this?

713
00:59:09,733 --> 00:59:11,833
You're playing around with me right now, aren't you?

714
00:59:11,833 --> 00:59:12,533
Huh?

715
00:59:12,533 --> 00:59:15,200
This is worth 2,000,000 won!($2000)

716
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,567
Then you should at least pay half.

717
00:59:17,567 --> 00:59:20,333
1,000,000 won?($1000)

718
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:23,000
Sir!

719
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:29,300
I'm only 21. Where do I have that kind of money? Please forgive us.

720
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:34,067
Do you want to get beat up or do you want to quietly figure it out here?

721
00:59:34,067 --> 00:59:37,267
Ah please let this go and talk. Why are you being like this?

722
00:59:38,133 --> 00:59:40,433
Ha Ni!

723
00:59:40,433 --> 00:59:42,033
Are you okay?

724
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,533
Boss. What's going on here?

725
00:59:54,963 --> 01:00:00,863
Seung Jo. Do you have 1,000,000 won? You're from a rich family.

726
01:00:09,096 --> 01:00:10,663
Sunbae!
Yes?

727
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:20,096
Ah! One, two, three.

728
01:00:22,563 --> 01:00:24,030
-Hurry!
-Get them!

729
01:00:25,696 --> 01:00:27,530
Get them!!

730
01:00:59,196 --> 01:01:01,263
Let's move, Ha Ni.

731
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:10,563
Bye, Baek Seung Jo.

732
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:25,263
I forgot Seung Jo.

733
01:01:25,796 --> 01:01:30,063
Baek Seung Jo has nothing to do with me anymore.

734
01:01:31,796 --> 01:01:34,296
What is it that you wanted to tell me?

735
01:01:34,296 --> 01:01:36,363
I like you.

736
01:01:38,463 --> 01:01:40,030
You?
