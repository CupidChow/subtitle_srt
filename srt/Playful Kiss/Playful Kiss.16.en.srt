1
00:01:01,212 --> 00:01:02,749
How come you're riding a bike?

2
00:01:03,651 --> 00:01:04,399
Oh, you came.

3
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:05,167
Yeah.

4
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:06,500
Oh, hi.

5
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Hi.

6
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,860
Is it a couple bike?

7
00:01:12,945 --> 00:01:14,700
You're making it so obvious.

8
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,189
It's because of my mother.

9
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,267
She tried to make us wear couple clothes as well, but I ran away.

10
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:30,184
But, you're not wearing the most important thing, the ring.

11
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:32,600
Oh, later . . .

12
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,867
I'm going to wear it once we get our marriage license.

13
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,967
Marriage license?

14
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:38,340
Nothing, let's go.

15
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,067
Yeah.

16
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:46,567
Really?!

17
00:01:48,977 --> 00:01:49,767
Ha Ni . . .

18
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,900
So by law, you're not related specifically to him?

19
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:59,600
What are you talking about? The sky and land knows that we married.

20
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,833
Do you know how many witnesses there were? You came as well.

21
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,604
Because of that paper . . .

22
00:02:05,604 --> 00:02:07,933
That's the power of a document.

23
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,800
The stamp's power.

24
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:13,833
That means that I have another chance yet.

25
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,900
But is it true?

26
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:35,876
Yeah.

27
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,200
Is she going to do nursing because of you?Because you are going to be a doctor?

28
00:02:40,284 --> 00:02:41,075
Yeah.

29
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,367
Oh Ha Ni is amazing.

30
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,300
She's like a star that orbits around Baek Seung Jo.

31
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,300
Isn't it expected that the earth orbits around the sun?

32
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,567
Oh my god, Baek Seung Jo you're the macho type?!

33
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:13,767
What? Still have a chance?

34
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:15,233
Can't believe it!

35
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:21,200
And what?! You're not going to register me until I'm able to pass the test to change majors?!

36
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:23,600
So mean and petty.

37
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,544
Okay.

38
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:42,900
Since it's mean and petty, I will pass.

39
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,867
So we can make it like a buffet, and customers can personally make their own lunches with the food they like.

40
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:56,233
And if they order something they really like, then I can personally make it a lunch.

41
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:57,567
Doesn't that sound okay?

42
00:03:57,567 --> 00:03:58,900
Hello.

43
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,833
Welcome! Aigoo. You came?

44
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,233
Welcome.

45
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,500
Hey.

46
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,500
Eh?

47
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:18,633
What would you like?

48
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,467
Today, I want to eat Sam Gye Noodles.

49
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,816
Why do you always eat noodles?

50
00:04:23,816 --> 00:04:26,033
You should eat rice, and bread as well.

51
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:30,767
Better than noodles, I wanted to eat the seasoned cucumber. It tastes so nice.

52
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:32,500
Probably I'm addicted to it.

53
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,233
Ah, what should I do? There's no seasoned cucumber left.

54
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,167
Eh? Really?

55
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,000
What is that? It sure does look fancy.

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,633
It's a tereré, which you use to drink mate tea cold! Have some!

57
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:49,367
Why should I drink what you have been drinking?

58
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:52,600
We usually share this between people. It means that you're friends.

59
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,833
Why would people share this one thing?

60
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,100
I'll catch something from it! Put it away!

61
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,733
You won't get sick. Tereré has a component that kills bacteria.

62
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,000
Drink it so we can be friends.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,367
I don't want to be your friend. Just eat the noodles and go okay?

64
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:06,800
Then be my boyfriend.

65
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:09,433
What?

66
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:13,100
I like you Mr. Bong. I liked you at first sight.

67
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,233
Let's be a couple.

68
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:19,000
Oh my goodness, this girl is absolutely crazy! Didn't I say that I have someone that I like?

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,900
Liar! I came everyday and haven't seen her once!

70
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,033
I haven't seen you date as well

71
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:25,933
If I like someone, do I have to go on dates and be a couple with them?

72
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:29,833
Just by myself, in my heart, I see this one person.

73
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:31,033
What is that?

74
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:35,300
You, don't come from now on. Alright? Don't come!

75
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:48,533
Oh Min Ah.

76
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:50,800
I'm going right now.

77
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,400
I'll see you later.

78
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:00,267
Oh! Ha Ni.

79
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:01,567
Long time, no see.

80
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:02,667
Sunbae!

81
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:04,633
Why don't you come to practice tennis nowadays?

82
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,767
Just because you got married, you're skipping?

83
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,767
It's not that.

84
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:12,933
Change of major? Are you being serious?

85
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:16,633
Yes, I'm desperate.

86
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,033
I know a little about it because one of my friends is in the nursing program.

87
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:24,400
Employment and competition is really fierce for that program,

88
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,467
so not many people get in. How are you supposed to change into that major when you don't even have a chance?

89
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:30,100
I know that,

90
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,167
then what do I do? I really have to get in.

91
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:37,600
You're probably better off just studying again and reapplying at university under that major.

92
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,400
Try again? No way.

93
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,800
There's no way that the typhoon's gonna come at that time again.

94
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:45,333
Typhoon?

95
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,900
There's something like that.

96
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,900
Ha Ni!

97
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:53,400
I, had "something."

98
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,733
Something?

99
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:57,508
With Hae Ra?

100
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:01,433
Are you dating?

101
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:08,067
We're not exactly dating, but we are eating hot dogs together.

102
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:09,200
Hot dogs?

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,900
What is that?

104
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,800
Hot dogs are very important.

105
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,400
Yah, but how could it be like this?

106
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,633
Can a person like another person this much?

107
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:26,733
Sunbae! It is very possible a person can like another person that much.

108
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:31,433
Joo Ri!

109
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,667
You came?

110
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:31,200
At first, his hair was pretty long. Maybe up to his shoulders? Isn't it long?

111
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:37,500
He comes everyday and tells me to cut it little by little. That's why it's that short.

112
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:45,333
But the strange thing is, he comes a bit later after work hours, and that's why I cut it.

113
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:49,833
He's coming to see you.

114
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:54,300
It could be like that.

115
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,600
To you who doesn't have certification, pretty great.

116
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,432
I've been studying.

117
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:05,367
Hey Jung Joo Ri, if you leave me and start dating, it'll be the end of our friendship.

118
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:11,933
Hey, since you're always in a room drawing all the time, that's why you haven't dated yet.

119
00:09:11,933 --> 00:09:14,300
Aigoo Dok Go Min Ah, it's a waste of your face.

120
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,500
Why? She's cool.

121
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,400
Your cartoon ratings are really high.

122
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,900
I uploaded a new one yesterday. Do you want to see it?

123
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,267
Why did you draw me so fat again?

124
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:26,267
Because you're fat.

125
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,600
-How can you draw like this?
-My arms are so big!

126
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:35,633
Omo, it's really the same.

127
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,533
Hey! What is this? Why did you draw something like this?

128
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:49,233
This Oh Ha Ni is now Seung Jo's wife.That's something to see while living.

129
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,867
Right? I found it interesting while I was drawing.

130
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:57,633
I'm not his wife yet.

131
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:09,433
Everyone says it's not going to work.

132
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,300
The test to change majors is hard.

133
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,233
But they say there's no way there are spots available in the nursing program.

134
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,400
Really?

135
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:23,767
What should I do, Mother? Marriage license.

136
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,500
Ha Ni...!

137
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:31,100
Follow me.

138
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,333
Marriage license.

139
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,800
We can just do it then.

140
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:42,067
What is this? Doing it his own way? What is he?

141
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,767
But still, I promised.

142
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:49,467
How is that a promise? He did it alone.

143
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:52,100
Oh, it's here.

144
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:54,333
Marriage license.

145
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,300
Signatures of 2 witnesses.

146
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:01,867
Well, your father-in-law and I can do that.

147
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:03,133
Will it be okay?

148
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:04,767
It's alright, it's alright.

149
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:08,567
First we'll report it, and then you can take the test.

150
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:15,433
You pass for the report and the report for your passing. It's just a different way of going about it.

151
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:16,667
Is that so?

152
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:20,700
Of course. What's the point in waiting when we don't even know when a spot will open up for you!

153
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,533
This is the problem. Identification.

154
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,867
We need Seung Jo's ID.

155
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:28,400
ID?

156
00:11:28,867 --> 00:11:32,133
Does Seung Jo always carry around his ID?

157
00:11:41,185 --> 00:11:43,487
Good

158
00:12:24,843 --> 00:12:26,147
What are you doing?

159
00:12:27,055 --> 00:12:28,771
Why are you looking at someone else's wallet?

160
00:12:29,743 --> 00:12:31,344
What do you mean looking through?

161
00:12:31,344 --> 00:12:34,644
Your wallet was pretty so I was just looking at it.

162
00:12:34,644 --> 00:12:36,571
Ah, it's so cute!

163
00:12:36,571 --> 00:12:38,905
Should I buy a couple's wallet too?

164
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:41,379
Hey, Oh Ha Ni.

165
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:44,024
Are you touching your husband's wallet already?

166
00:12:45,277 --> 00:12:47,340
It's not that.

167
00:12:49,177 --> 00:12:50,671
It seems like there are a couple bills missing.

168
00:12:50,671 --> 00:12:54,251
Hey what are you talking about? What do you see me as?

169
00:12:59,631 --> 00:13:01,377
Aren't you gonna sleep?

170
00:13:01,377 --> 00:13:03,160
I am.

171
00:14:26,605 --> 00:14:28,209
It's already been reported.

172
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:29,609
What?

173
00:14:29,609 --> 00:14:31,659
That can't be.

174
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:33,499
This is the first time we've been here.

175
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:34,715
Really?!

176
00:14:34,715 --> 00:14:36,693
But why is it already done?

177
00:14:38,676 --> 00:14:41,805
Your husband registered it. Mr. Baek Seung Jo.

178
00:14:42,476 --> 00:14:44,301
Baek Seung Jo?

179
00:14:57,739 --> 00:15:01,291
Did you know that I took it?

180
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,437
Did you not know what was in here?

181
00:15:04,076 --> 00:15:05,555
Seung Jo.

182
00:15:05,555 --> 00:15:06,927
Why do you tease her so much?

183
00:15:06,927 --> 00:15:08,892
It's fun.

184
00:15:08,892 --> 00:15:11,929
I live for teasing Oh Ha Ni.

185
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:14,709
She tries hard when she has a goal.

186
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:17,176
Changing into the nursing program isn't easy.

187
00:15:17,176 --> 00:15:19,565
I did it on purpose so that she would set her mind to it.

188
00:15:19,565 --> 00:15:21,619
But then you touch my wallet.

189
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:23,655
I'm disappointed in you.

190
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:24,776
No.

191
00:15:24,776 --> 00:15:26,276
I'm gonna do it. I'll do it!

192
00:15:26,276 --> 00:15:27,961
I'll work hard.

193
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,969
Don't be disappointed.

194
00:15:29,969 --> 00:15:32,609
Well 1,000 hand outs for the time being.

195
00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:33,773
Ok.

196
00:15:34,849 --> 00:15:37,832
Let's see how many lunch boxes...

197
00:15:37,832 --> 00:15:39,509
Hey, but...

198
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:42,627
When will you finish all this?

199
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,936
The end is right in front of us so I think I'll have to pull an all-nighter.

200
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:50,989
Hey, but...

201
00:15:52,103 --> 00:15:55,171
After that day, Chris hasn't shown up.

202
00:15:56,743 --> 00:15:58,043
Is that so?

203
00:15:58,043 --> 00:16:00,632
I was so busy I didn't know.

204
00:16:04,609 --> 00:16:06,264
Ah paper cups...

205
00:16:09,895 --> 00:16:14,468
Breathing techniques for the Heimlich maneuver...

206
00:16:14,468 --> 00:16:18,156
Breathe into the mouth...

207
00:16:18,156 --> 00:16:19,676
Ha Ni, Ha Ni.

208
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,200
Hello.

209
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:24,061
Really?!

210
00:16:24,061 --> 00:16:25,720
Joon Gu?

211
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,320
Sit down.

212
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,408
Joon Gu is so cool!

213
00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:34,176
By any chance, because the food is so good...

214
00:16:34,176 --> 00:16:36,783
You're not confused are you? That could happen.

215
00:16:36,783 --> 00:16:38,809
No. I like everything.

216
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:42,143
I like the way he looks. I like how he's like a man.

217
00:16:42,143 --> 00:16:45,611
And especially the way he talks. It's like he's singing.

218
00:16:45,611 --> 00:16:46,987
Oh I see.

219
00:16:46,987 --> 00:16:49,676
I have to go to England on Christmas Eve.

220
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,243
But I don't want to go. I want to be with him.

221
00:16:52,243 --> 00:16:54,768
If Mr. Bong tells me not to go, I'm not going.

222
00:16:55,476 --> 00:16:57,280
You like him that much?

223
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,509
But Mr. Bong said that he has someone he likes.

224
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:02,307
Is that true?

225
00:17:02,307 --> 00:17:03,671
Who is it?

226
00:17:04,543 --> 00:17:06,104
He said that?

227
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,309
No. There's no such person.

228
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:13,977
Really?!

229
00:17:13,977 --> 00:17:15,143
I knew it!

230
00:17:15,143 --> 00:17:17,076
Then Ha Ni, help me a bit.

231
00:17:17,076 --> 00:17:19,376
Tell Mr. Bong that I'm pretty.

232
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:20,909
Alright.

233
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:23,176
So Pal Bok Lunches!

234
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:24,239
Here, here, here.

235
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:27,009
Hello!

236
00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:29,943
Hello, welcome to So Pal Bok. Please go inside.

237
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:34,509
Wow, this is great Bong Joon Gu.

238
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:36,397
You had this kind of ability?

239
00:17:37,176 --> 00:17:40,289
This is just for your opening.

240
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:44,171
Where did you leave Ha Ni and why are you with this girl?

241
00:17:44,171 --> 00:17:45,409
Joon Gu!

242
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:46,643
Hello.

243
00:17:46,643 --> 00:17:48,376
Ha Ni, you came? Good job!

244
00:17:48,376 --> 00:17:51,309
This is so that your business will unravel into greatness.

245
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:56,309
Buying this kind of present in this country...

246
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,576
I told her to buy it.

247
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,709
Oh really? Okay good job, good job!

248
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:02,143
We actually need this.

249
00:18:02,143 --> 00:18:03,643
Oh it's 3 fold!

250
00:18:03,643 --> 00:18:04,676
Thanks!

251
00:18:04,676 --> 00:18:06,209
Boss Bong!

252
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:08,476
Your honored guests are here so you should say something.

253
00:18:08,476 --> 00:18:11,509
Chef, what would I say? You may do it

254
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:15,509
What are you talking about? Boss Bong has to do it.

255
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:28,209
Although there may be some that already know...

256
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:31,209
There's a book known as the Michelin Guide.

257
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:33,743
It's a book that introduces the best restaurants around the world.

258
00:18:33,743 --> 00:18:37,027
Getting even 1 star in that book is the most honorable thing ever!

259
00:18:37,027 --> 00:18:40,476
The restaurant becomes a worldwide landmark overnight!

260
00:18:40,476 --> 00:18:42,709
At first I thought they were really jerks.

261
00:18:42,709 --> 00:18:46,309
Who are they to put stars next to someone else's food?

262
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:51,109
Right? But then the way they rate the food isn't just that it tastes good!

263
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:54,676
But it's about whether the food is always good no matter when you go.

264
00:18:54,676 --> 00:19:01,976
A star is only given if the taste of the food is always great whether the chef goes through heartache or happiness.

265
00:19:01,976 --> 00:19:08,309
So I too would like to receive a star with So Pal Bok Lunches!

266
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:11,576
Then the Goddess So Pal Bok in Heaven...

267
00:19:11,576 --> 00:19:13,609
would be so happy, right?

268
00:19:19,543 --> 00:19:20,976
Thank you. Thank you.

269
00:19:20,976 --> 00:19:22,976
You're so cool, Mr. Bong.

270
00:19:22,976 --> 00:19:24,976
Ah, Mr. Bong.

271
00:19:24,976 --> 00:19:27,876
I have to go to England, but I don't want to go.

272
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:30,209
Tell me not to, then I won't.

273
00:19:31,709 --> 00:19:34,709
What the hell are you talking about?!

274
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:37,609
Did I not tell you? ...

275
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,476
... I have no one but Ha Ni.

276
00:19:41,076 --> 00:19:42,609
Ha Ni?

277
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,109
Oh Ha Ni?

278
00:19:46,043 --> 00:19:48,076
Yeah, I have no one but Ha Ni.

279
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:52,709
You're going to England? Okay, go go go. Go and don't come back, okay?

280
00:19:52,709 --> 00:19:54,176
Bong Joon Gu.

281
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:01,409
Oh hey.

282
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:02,809
Chris!

283
00:20:16,543 --> 00:20:18,043
What should I do?

284
00:20:18,043 --> 00:20:21,443
Chris decided she was going to go to England.

285
00:20:23,043 --> 00:20:25,076
She trusted me and told me everything.

286
00:20:25,076 --> 00:20:26,976
I feel like I betrayed her.

287
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,609
Then why did you get involved in someone else's business?

288
00:20:31,343 --> 00:20:33,676
She told me to help her.

289
00:20:36,076 --> 00:20:38,076
You must like it.

290
00:20:38,076 --> 00:20:40,476
For an ahjumma to have a scandal and all.

291
00:20:40,476 --> 00:20:42,209
Why are you being like that!

292
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,976
But...

293
00:20:44,976 --> 00:20:47,243
What exactly happened?

294
00:20:48,643 --> 00:20:50,776
You and Bong Joon Gu.

295
00:20:50,776 --> 00:20:52,976
What happened...

296
00:20:52,976 --> 00:20:55,476
that he's acting that way even though we got married?

297
00:20:55,476 --> 00:20:57,676
Nothing happened.

298
00:20:57,676 --> 00:21:00,076
It's just Joon Gu's character.

299
00:21:00,076 --> 00:21:01,609
During Freshman year in high school...

300
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:05,409
Are you jealous?

301
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:07,443
Hey!

302
00:21:07,443 --> 00:21:10,176
Who's jealous?

303
00:21:10,176 --> 00:21:11,909
Jealous?!

304
00:21:14,776 --> 00:21:16,543
Ah just leave it.

305
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:18,109
Let those two figure it out on their own.

306
00:21:20,543 --> 00:21:22,776
If you keep getting involved...

307
00:21:22,776 --> 00:21:25,643
it might get worse.

308
00:21:25,643 --> 00:21:27,043
Maybe?

309
00:21:27,043 --> 00:21:28,443
Yeah.

310
00:21:28,443 --> 00:21:30,676
Just leave them alone,

311
00:21:30,676 --> 00:21:33,376
until they figure everything out.

312
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,176
I guess so.

313
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:38,709
You did that too, didn't you?

314
00:21:40,243 --> 00:21:41,576
What?

315
00:21:41,576 --> 00:21:42,943
You too,

316
00:21:42,943 --> 00:21:44,709
after leaving everything alone,

317
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:46,809
you found out your true feelings.

318
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:48,109
Ah,really.

319
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:48,876
I'm right, huh?

320
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:50,043
Hey, just study.

321
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:54,009
I'm right, aren't I? You were jealous earlier weren't you?

322
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:54,743
I said I'm not!

323
00:21:54,743 --> 00:21:57,009
I know you were.

324
00:21:57,009 --> 00:21:58,876
Are you crazy?

325
00:21:58,876 --> 00:22:01,043
Hey! Aigoo cute.

326
00:22:04,743 --> 00:22:06,009
Did you finish all the leftover dishes?

327
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:07,976
I'll get housewife's eczema like this!

328
00:22:07,976 --> 00:22:09,676
Me too.

329
00:22:10,643 --> 00:22:12,409
But, she's really not coming.

330
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:13,209
Who?

331
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:15,343
Chris.

332
00:22:15,343 --> 00:22:18,209
Yeah. Did she leave already?

333
00:22:18,209 --> 00:22:19,409
Hey, hurry and come!

334
00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:20,676
Let's hurry.

335
00:22:20,676 --> 00:22:23,476
Hello!

336
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:40,070
Chris is leaving.

337
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,025
You heard, right?

338
00:22:43,025 --> 00:22:45,703
What does that have to do with me?

339
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,903
Tell me honestly.

340
00:22:48,903 --> 00:22:50,437
Do you not like Chris?

341
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:51,707
Well . . .

342
00:22:51,707 --> 00:22:54,270
There's nothing to not like...

343
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,870
Doesn't not seeing her make you curious?

344
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,306
You miss her, right?

345
00:22:58,306 --> 00:23:00,037
No way.

346
00:23:00,037 --> 00:23:02,395
To me, you're the only one.
Didn't I tell you?

347
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,000
I told her.

348
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,400
That you're my family.

349
00:23:11,903 --> 00:23:14,037
I'm married, Joon Gu.

350
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,100
Now, Seung Jo is my family.

351
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,100
Yea, that's right.

352
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,300
Ah, in that case

353
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,300
Then, arms...

354
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,300
Think of me as an extra arm.

355
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,500
Whenever you're having a hard time, then you can come find me.

356
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:34,865
Usually don't people need to in someone's arms when they're tired and weak.

357
00:23:34,865 --> 00:23:36,637
Joon Gu

358
00:23:38,737 --> 00:23:41,403
Sit here.

359
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,503
Hurry.

360
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,175
All this time, Joon Gu, you

361
00:23:58,175 --> 00:24:00,903
you've supported me with everything I have done,

362
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:05,100
cheering me on and doing as I asked.

363
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,800
Thank you.

364
00:24:09,103 --> 00:24:11,423
So this time too...

365
00:24:11,423 --> 00:24:14,103
Just this once...

366
00:24:14,103 --> 00:24:17,670
Just listen to me once more.

367
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:22,270
Sit here and calmly think about it.

368
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,537
"My heart feels this way"

369
00:24:24,537 --> 00:24:26,403
I know myself.

370
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,200
Don't just keep telling yourself that.

371
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:35,800
Just leave your heart to the swaying swing

372
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
while looking up at the sky.

373
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:43,603
They say that then you'll really see your own feelings.

374
00:24:46,103 --> 00:24:48,437
Try it.

375
00:26:07,211 --> 00:26:08,837
And so?

376
00:26:08,837 --> 00:26:11,786
What do you want me to do about you receiving your draft notice?

377
00:26:11,786 --> 00:26:15,437
Ah, no it's not that you should do something...

378
00:26:15,437 --> 00:26:18,207
it's just, I don't know either.

379
00:26:18,207 --> 00:26:21,637
For some reason, I thought I should tell you.

380
00:26:22,137 --> 00:26:23,690
Why?

381
00:26:25,371 --> 00:26:29,322
Don't tell me it's because I cried in front of you that day...

382
00:26:29,322 --> 00:26:31,953
You don't think that we have some sort of special relationship, do you?

383
00:26:31,953 --> 00:26:33,981
Oh, no!

384
00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:36,191
Am I a fool?

385
00:26:36,191 --> 00:26:39,529
When I knew why you were crying.

386
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:42,357
I didn't think that, so don't worry.

387
00:26:42,847 --> 00:26:44,661
Then that's a relief.

388
00:26:47,537 --> 00:26:50,706
I

389
00:26:50,706 --> 00:26:54,945
I'm just saying this so

390
00:26:54,945 --> 00:26:57,671
don't feel burdened.

391
00:26:57,671 --> 00:26:59,104
Ok.

392
00:27:01,938 --> 00:27:04,338
When you're bored

393
00:27:04,338 --> 00:27:09,238
When you really have nothing to do and you're really bored

394
00:27:09,238 --> 00:27:13,071
A letter...

395
00:27:13,071 --> 00:27:15,571
Would you write a letter to me?

396
00:27:16,575 --> 00:27:18,371
I don't want to.

397
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:20,628
It's bothersome, it's not even e-mail.

398
00:27:20,628 --> 00:27:24,752
Right, it's not even an email.

399
00:27:24,752 --> 00:27:28,538
When would you write it, send it, and wait for it...

400
00:27:28,538 --> 00:27:31,380
I probably couldn't do it either.

401
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,964
With that time you might as well sleep!

402
00:27:34,964 --> 00:27:37,375
What?

403
00:27:44,907 --> 00:27:47,786
Yeah...

404
00:27:52,266 --> 00:27:55,938
Then, I'll go.

405
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:11,594
Hye Ra

406
00:28:11,594 --> 00:28:15,919
I have another favor to ask

407
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,571
A real one.

408
00:28:19,714 --> 00:28:21,927
From now on

409
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,371
don't cry alone.

410
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:30,516
Back then, you cried into my shoulder.

411
00:28:30,516 --> 00:28:32,180
I felt a bit bad.

412
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,658
like my bones were melting or something.

413
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:41,290
I'm really going now.

414
00:28:41,525 --> 00:28:43,700
Be well.

415
00:28:47,338 --> 00:28:52,404
If I'm really bored

416
00:28:52,404 --> 00:28:55,647
I'll go visit you.

417
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,100
Really?

418
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,000
I guess there are times the draft comes out this quickly too.

419
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,100
What a pity.

420
00:29:10,136 --> 00:29:11,886
Oh really?

421
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,200
You're the only one sad to hear that I'm going to the army.

422
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,400
Even my parents were glad, because tuition is so expensive.

423
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,552
But I didn't come here to say that.

424
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,622
I wanted to thank you.

425
00:29:24,622 --> 00:29:27,003
To me?
For what?

426
00:29:27,003 --> 00:29:29,400
Didn't you always tell me?

427
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,187
You don't need to prepare special events or anything.

428
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,587
Just sincerely

429
00:29:33,587 --> 00:29:36,739
Telling the truth is best.

430
00:29:36,739 --> 00:29:38,083
Of course.

431
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:41,624
Did you confess?

432
00:29:41,624 --> 00:29:42,947
To Hye Ra?

433
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:47,043
Why would I confess? But I did do something similar to confessing.

434
00:29:48,344 --> 00:29:51,075
Did you know...

435
00:29:51,075 --> 00:29:54,574
I learned a lot from you.

436
00:29:54,574 --> 00:29:57,774
I didn't do it at all because I was afraid of failing.

437
00:29:57,774 --> 00:30:00,803
Or being afraid of being rejected so I didn't confess.

438
00:30:00,803 --> 00:30:02,744
I was always like that.

439
00:30:02,744 --> 00:30:05,631
But watching you I began to think, who cares if I fail.

440
00:30:05,631 --> 00:30:08,220
And who cares if I get rejected.

441
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,339
This was my way of thinking, this mindset.

442
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:12,907
I learned all of this watching you.

443
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,900
There are a few things I know!

444
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,100
In any case, thanks to you I had a fun time.

445
00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:22,456
That's why

446
00:30:22,456 --> 00:30:25,044
this older brother of yours would like to..

447
00:30:25,044 --> 00:30:25,842
I wanted to give you a present.

448
00:30:26,682 --> 00:30:28,598
Really?

449
00:30:28,598 --> 00:30:30,114
Ok, give it to me.

450
00:30:30,114 --> 00:30:32,688
Not that kind.

451
00:30:32,688 --> 00:30:36,156
You said you wanted to get into the nursing program right?

452
00:30:36,156 --> 00:30:37,658
When I go to the army,

453
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:39,691
I'll open up a spot for you in the nursing program.

454
00:30:39,691 --> 00:30:43,395
How could you do that Sunbae? You're not even in the nursing program.

455
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,100
Ha Ni

456
00:30:46,163 --> 00:30:48,936
In this world our country is the only one that

457
00:30:48,936 --> 00:30:52,072
has a very great system known as the accompanying draft system.

458
00:30:52,072 --> 00:30:56,091
Remember last time when I said I had a friend in the nursing program?

459
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,100
He's a man.

460
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,200
When I get drafted, I'll take him with me.

461
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,300
Really?!

462
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,900
He said he'll go with you?!

463
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,200
What's he going to do if he doesn't go? I'm taking away the room from him!

464
00:31:09,287 --> 00:31:12,168
If I get rid of the room he has nowhere to go!

465
00:31:12,168 --> 00:31:14,095
If I go to the army he has to go to the army too.

466
00:31:14,095 --> 00:31:16,512
If I go to a secluded island, he has to go and catch tuna or something--

467
00:31:16,512 --> 00:31:18,368
Sunbaenim!

468
00:31:18,368 --> 00:31:21,896
So I'll make a spot somehow.

469
00:31:21,896 --> 00:31:22,600
The exam.

470
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,298
I can't do anything with the exam! So you have to do well and get accepted!

471
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:27,784
Aah of course!

472
00:31:27,784 --> 00:31:33,566
Aaaah! Assa! Thank you so much, really!

473
00:31:33,566 --> 00:31:38,323
Sunbae! Thank you! Sunbaenim!

474
00:31:39,262 --> 00:31:41,012
Thank you!

475
00:31:41,012 --> 00:31:42,554
Are you this happy to see me go into the army?

476
00:31:42,554 --> 00:31:45,384
Yes, I'm so happy.

477
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,067
Please cut it short.

478
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:24,433
It's already very short.
Do you want to make it shorter?

479
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:32,033
Oh, okay.

480
00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:39,767
I'm going to the army.

481
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:59,667
Then . . . we can't do it with this.

482
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:18,300
It's okay.

483
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,600
Don't worry,

484
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,067
I will wait for you.

485
00:33:31,233 --> 00:33:33,537
I choose a major!

486
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:40,300
The exam is pretty close.

487
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,416
Yeah. There aren't many days left.

488
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:43,700
But what can I do?

489
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,555
The competition is intense.

490
00:33:46,555 --> 00:33:48,000
Do well.

491
00:33:48,467 --> 00:33:50,300
How can you go to sleep already?

492
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,667
What do you want?

493
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:53,633
You have to help me study!

494
00:33:53,633 --> 00:33:55,643
Pick out the questions you think are going to appear on the exam. It's your major.

495
00:33:55,643 --> 00:33:57,115
It's your major, isn't it?

496
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,033
Please Mr. ESP Baek!

497
00:34:00,033 --> 00:34:01,633
I beg of you.

498
00:34:02,267 --> 00:34:04,933
In order to inspect the patient's nutritional status,

499
00:34:04,933 --> 00:34:09,000
when is the best time to inspect the patient's abdomen?

500
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:12,700
4 to 5 hours after a meal.

501
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:17,200
The 3 premises of setting up a goal in order to motivate someone?

502
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,700
Be detailed.

503
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:24,367
It must be achievable and yet slightly hard.

504
00:34:24,367 --> 00:34:25,633
Also . . .

505
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:28,400
By yourself . . .

506
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,220
That's right! It has to be set on your own.

507
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:35,200
See, you need a goal to be more motivated.

508
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,633
I even set up a goal for you.

509
00:34:37,633 --> 00:34:39,033
I have a goal!

510
00:34:39,033 --> 00:34:40,533
What is it?

511
00:34:40,533 --> 00:34:42,733
If I pass this time

512
00:34:42,733 --> 00:34:44,600
a date on Christmas Day.

513
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,967
A date?

514
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:51,700
We got married without even a proper date.

515
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,900
And during the honeymoon too.

516
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,133
If I pass, let's go on a date.

517
00:34:58,433 --> 00:34:59,733
All right.

518
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:02,533
All day. Full.

519
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:03,767
Fine.

520
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:05,433
Awesome!

521
00:35:05,933 --> 00:35:08,367
Shall we practice the practical skill portion?

522
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:10,833
The practical skill is giving CPR.

523
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:12,300
I read about it, but

524
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,167
I've still haven't tried it.

525
00:35:14,167 --> 00:35:17,400
About 100 compressions per minute.

526
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,967
So then,

527
00:35:20,233 --> 00:35:22,300
One-Two-Three.

528
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,636
About this much.

529
00:35:23,636 --> 00:35:25,533
Ok, I'll try it.

530
00:35:26,033 --> 00:35:28,067
The Heimlich maneuver.

531
00:35:31,967 --> 00:35:34,267
Uhh, check for breathing.

532
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:39,033
There's no breath.

533
00:35:39,033 --> 00:35:41,933
Open the airway, mouth to mouth

534
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,867
Hey, what are you doing?

535
00:35:47,933 --> 00:35:49,967
This is an emergency.

536
00:35:49,967 --> 00:35:51,628
You're feeling it?

537
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:54,600
That's not it! What do you mean "feeling" it?

538
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,833
Hurry, what's next?

539
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:57,633
Okay.

540
00:35:57,633 --> 00:36:01,207
Next, chest compressions, 30 times . . .

541
00:36:01,933 --> 00:36:05,733
One-two-three-four-five.

542
00:36:05,733 --> 00:36:06,967
Hey!

543
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:09,600
Are you treating a sick person or a healthy person right now?

544
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,033
Huh?

545
00:36:11,033 --> 00:36:12,800
I thought it would hurt.

546
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,367
Harder?

547
00:36:15,066 --> 00:36:16,233
One-two. . .

548
00:36:16,233 --> 00:36:17,466
Arms straight.

549
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,533
Four -- how is this?

550
00:36:20,433 --> 00:36:22,767
Five...Six...Seven...Eight...

551
00:36:22,767 --> 00:36:24,700
Rest a bit.

552
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,333
Come here.

553
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,967
I have a lot to do.

554
00:36:33,367 --> 00:36:35,333
This is study as well.

555
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:41,833
Ah, Eun Joo.

556
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:46,367
I wanted to ask you something.

557
00:36:46,367 --> 00:36:48,165
Gosh. . . hyung!

558
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:50,100
Oh Ha Ni sister-in-law!

559
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,133
Next to your room there's a way before adolescence' me

560
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:56,133
So please watch yourselves

561
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:57,567
Yeah.

562
00:36:57,567 --> 00:36:58,833
I'm sorry.

563
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:11,200
Here, take these to relax!

564
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,433
Did you say it was 2 sessions?

565
00:37:18,433 --> 00:37:23,833
The first is the writing exam and the second is the interview.

566
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:27,067
What would they ask? I'm so nervous.

567
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,667
No there's no need for that.

568
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:31,867
You'll do fine after eating this!

569
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,833
Hurry and go. It's almost time.

570
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:38,700
Ha Ni, Fighting!

571
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,100
Fighting!

572
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:53,267
She could have taken the easy route, but she chooses the hardest one!

573
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:15,733
Gosh, how does he know exactly what's on it?

574
00:38:15,733 --> 00:38:19,833
I really must have married an amazing man.

575
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:25,700
Min Ah, what if I really get into the nursing program like this?

576
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:28,400
Number 68, Oh Ha Ni.

577
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,167
Yes.

578
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:31,900
I'll get back to you later.

579
00:38:40,367 --> 00:38:42,367
Interviewer

580
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:50,567
Hello, I'm number 68, Oh Ha Ni.

581
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,767
By any chance are you the snail?

582
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:01,467
So you eventually got in.

583
00:39:02,267 --> 00:39:04,967
Why should we choose you?

584
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:09,600
Ah, yes, as an additional acceptee.

585
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,500
Oh, you got lucky.

586
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,233
A quick and accurate act of CPR,

587
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:20,900
increases the probability of survival by 3 times.

588
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,100
But if it's done incorrectly the patient can die as well.

589
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:28,700
In real life someone gave CPR to someone whose heart stopped.

590
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,367
They did it incorrectly and eventually went to jail.

591
00:39:32,367 --> 00:39:35,800
Really? It had to be done for the person to live.

592
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,433
- After all, murder is murder.
- Murder?!

593
00:39:40,433 --> 00:39:43,967
What would you do?

594
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:50,400
If someone can live or die by me giving CPR...

595
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,033
I have to try,

596
00:39:52,033 --> 00:39:53,833
For the sake of hope for their life.

597
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:55,167
Is that so?

598
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,800
Then, try it!

599
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:07,000
You have to check to see if they're conscious first!

600
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,667
Oh?

601
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:10,867
Are you alright?

602
00:40:25,766 --> 00:40:27,767
You're not going to report it?

603
00:40:29,432 --> 00:40:32,467
Someone please call 119!

604
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:46,200
Hey, are you treating a sick person or a healthy person here?

605
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:51,733
Stop. That's enough.

606
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:59,400
The people of our country will not call it in unless you say, "YOU do it!".

607
00:41:00,267 --> 00:41:04,833
Just a second ago you said "Please report it!", right?

608
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:07,633
The call probably still hasn't been made yet.

609
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:12,967
And you have to press in hard enough for it to be 4-5 centimeters deep.

610
00:41:12,967 --> 00:41:17,800
But you nearly crushed them with 6-7 centimeters deep.

611
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,233
This patient probably

612
00:41:20,233 --> 00:41:23,900
would have suffered broken ribs and died.

613
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,933
If this was a real situation,

614
00:41:26,933 --> 00:41:29,433
You just killing now.

615
00:41:30,133 --> 00:41:33,000
We can't choose a murderer as a nurse.

616
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,167
It was announced on the spot.

617
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,233
She said they can't pick a murderer.

618
00:41:44,233 --> 00:41:46,200
Oh my goodness!

619
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,600
What did I say?

620
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,067
I told you that Oh Ha Ni sister-in-law and being a nurse just doesn't match.

621
00:41:52,533 --> 00:41:54,667
That's right.

622
00:41:54,667 --> 00:41:58,267
I was nervous even though it was a mannequin.

623
00:41:58,633 --> 00:42:02,300
When she said the mannequin was dead,

624
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,933
my heart dropped.

625
00:42:03,933 --> 00:42:05,933
How in the world could I treat a person?

626
00:42:05,933 --> 00:42:07,300
Ha Ni.

627
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:10,967
Then, what are you going to do?

628
00:42:11,633 --> 00:42:14,800
I must have reached beyond my abilities, Dad.

629
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:18,000
I shouldn't have made the decision so easily.

630
00:42:19,633 --> 00:42:22,800
Oh, I should hurry and pick a major.

631
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,767
I will go upstairs first.

632
00:42:34,067 --> 00:42:37,033
It seems Ha Ni is quite upset.

633
00:42:37,033 --> 00:42:41,500
Really. She must be really ill fated with that professor.

634
00:43:01,401 --> 00:43:05,567
What to do? I guess there's no date after all!

635
00:43:05,567 --> 00:43:07,500
There's nothing we can do.

636
00:43:09,444 --> 00:43:12,733
I'm going crazy because I want to go on a date with Oh Ha Ni!

637
00:43:15,787 --> 00:43:19,545
I can't break it because a promise is a promise.

638
00:43:20,867 --> 00:43:25,580
Shouldn't just having dinner together be alright?

639
00:43:26,433 --> 00:43:28,396
Really?

640
00:43:42,147 --> 00:43:43,776
Hey!

641
00:43:43,776 --> 00:43:47,100
What are you doing in here, doing this? A young guy like you should be playing outside.

642
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:51,167
Why should I do anything on Jesus's birthday?

643
00:43:52,293 --> 00:43:53,800
That's right!

644
00:43:55,067 --> 00:43:58,367
Chris is leaving today, right?

645
00:43:58,367 --> 00:44:02,499
That's right, Chris said she was going to leave on Christmas Eve.

646
00:44:02,499 --> 00:44:04,900
That's right.

647
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:09,200
Really, she said it was a 7:00 o'clock plane. I'm sure of it!

648
00:44:10,933 --> 00:44:13,000
Aigoo!

649
00:44:16,844 --> 00:44:21,025
Right about now, she should be at the airport.

650
00:44:30,817 --> 00:44:36,331
Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viiikii.net

651
00:44:48,184 --> 00:44:50,917
This would be good.

652
00:44:50,917 --> 00:44:54,557
He said that this bag looked pretty.

653
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,995
Motorcycles are trouble makers!

654
00:45:10,451 --> 00:45:15,467
I'm sorry. Is there any way that I could get there faster?

655
00:45:15,467 --> 00:45:19,500
What can I do with the traffic?

656
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,867
What should I do?

657
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,552
There's an accident.

658
00:45:28,552 --> 00:45:32,069
Anyway, motorcycles cause accidents!

659
00:45:32,069 --> 00:45:33,633
Is that person dead?

660
00:45:33,633 --> 00:45:36,187
Are you alright, young lady?

661
00:45:36,187 --> 00:45:37,467
What should we do? What should we do?

662
00:45:46,681 --> 00:45:48,111
Someone do something.

663
00:45:48,111 --> 00:45:50,265
You've just murdered someone!

664
00:45:50,265 --> 00:45:52,233
Are you alright?

665
00:45:52,233 --> 00:45:55,472
What to do?!

666
00:45:55,472 --> 00:45:57,100
She seems to be unconscious!

667
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,700
Did anybody call the ambulance? Someone call the ambulance!

668
00:46:01,915 --> 00:46:03,756
What should we do?

669
00:46:03,756 --> 00:46:09,004
No air for 5 minutes is brain damage and over 10 minutes is death.

670
00:46:09,004 --> 00:46:11,200
Let her be!

671
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,421
If you wrongly move a hurt person

672
00:46:15,421 --> 00:46:19,495
and damage the spine, they can become paralyzed completely.

673
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,200
Did someone call the ambulance?

674
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,915
Someone must have.

675
00:46:47,915 --> 00:46:50,967
No one called?

676
00:46:50,967 --> 00:46:51,789
Ajusshi with the blue jacket.

677
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:52,333
Phone?

678
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:53,333
Call 119.

679
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:55,171
Oh, yes.

680
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:05,424
Oh. She's alive! She's alive!

681
00:47:05,424 --> 00:47:06,967
That's a relief!

682
00:47:06,967 --> 00:47:08,333
What kind of person is she?

683
00:47:08,333 --> 00:47:13,296
Oh my god, that's such a relief.

684
00:47:22,716 --> 00:47:23,668
Excuse me!

685
00:47:23,668 --> 00:47:25,084
Do you have a ticket?

686
00:47:25,084 --> 00:47:28,233
Did the plane going to the UK leave? Can't I just go in for a second?!

687
00:47:28,233 --> 00:47:30,267
- You can't go in without a ticket.
- It'll just be a minute!

688
00:47:30,267 --> 00:47:32,515
Just for one minute.

689
00:47:37,367 --> 00:47:43,333
What's up with you, Bong Joon Gu?
Why are you here? Are you crazy?

690
00:47:44,967 --> 00:47:47,280
Mr. Bong.

691
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,761
I was right. So I was right!

692
00:47:52,761 --> 00:47:57,792
I saw everything. You came here to get me, right? You're here to tell me not to go.

693
00:47:59,867 --> 00:48:04,701
I didn't come here to stop you. I came here to see you off.

694
00:48:04,701 --> 00:48:08,613
I came here late because there was traffic in the subway.

695
00:48:08,613 --> 00:48:12,200
How come you're here and not inside?
Did I get the time wrong?

696
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,929
No, I went inside and just came back out.

697
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:18,903
If I went in, then my heart,

698
00:48:18,903 --> 00:48:22,100
I thought it would hurt so much right here.

699
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:47,333
Tonight, it's really just me.

700
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:50,987
Ha Ni went to see her husband.

701
00:48:50,987 --> 00:48:57,800
Jong Gu . . .
looks like he went to the airport.

702
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,967
That rascal.

703
00:49:02,021 --> 00:49:05,045
Merry Christmas!

704
00:49:11,767 --> 00:49:13,338
She's all right.

705
00:49:13,338 --> 00:49:17,267
You've done well. Did you learn first aid?

706
00:49:17,267 --> 00:49:20,613
I didn't learn it, I just . . .

707
00:49:22,409 --> 00:49:28,720
If you didn't do it, then something big could have happened.
You saved a person.

708
00:49:44,667 --> 00:49:46,583
Customer,

709
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:49,233
Business hours are over.

710
00:49:49,233 --> 00:49:50,700
Yeah.

711
00:49:52,267 --> 00:49:53,533
Excuse me.

712
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:55,387
Yes.

713
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,427
It's nothing.

714
00:50:44,933 --> 00:50:47,759
There was an accident on the way.

715
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,267
If you were going to send a message, you should've sent it fast.

716
00:50:51,267 --> 00:50:55,183
I was worried that something happened.

717
00:50:55,183 --> 00:50:57,259
Are you okay?

718
00:50:57,259 --> 00:50:59,733
Nothing big, right?

719
00:50:59,733 --> 00:51:00,838
Yeah.

720
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:15,167
I thought you left.

721
00:51:27,259 --> 00:51:30,367
I'm hungry.

722
00:51:30,367 --> 00:51:35,300
Let's at least eat a hamburger somewhere.

723
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:41,233
Never mind. Where would we go like this?
We'd better go home.

724
00:51:44,667 --> 00:51:50,997
It's really hard to have one date.

725
00:51:54,557 --> 00:51:57,123
Even though I had told you that before.

726
00:51:57,123 --> 00:52:02,323
Ha Ni is right here.
If not for Ha Ni, I wouldn't have been here right now.

727
00:52:03,657 --> 00:52:07,257
Whether that is loyalty, friendship, or love,

728
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:13,623
whatever it's called, Ha Ni is nailed in right here.

729
00:52:13,623 --> 00:52:15,533
Do you understand?,

730
00:52:15,533 --> 00:52:16,423
So what?

731
00:52:16,423 --> 00:52:22,190
So... so... because of that...

732
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:25,823
I mean, I can't erase it, ever. Are you okay with that?

733
00:52:25,823 --> 00:52:27,623
I don't like it!
How can it be okay with me?

734
00:52:27,623 --> 00:52:30,423
Then I can't do anything. Go!

735
00:52:30,423 --> 00:52:31,757
Then I'm going to nail it in too!,

736
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:36,557
If Ha Ni is just 1 nail,
then I'm going to nail in 10, 20, 100 nails.

737
00:52:36,557 --> 00:52:38,390
I'm going to nail it all over Mr. Bong's body!

738
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:43,923
Are you trying to kill me?!

739
00:52:43,923 --> 00:52:47,157
With that many nails a person will die, not live!

740
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:49,557
Even 1 is this hard.

741
00:52:49,557 --> 00:52:52,157
Really? Then . . .

742
00:52:52,157 --> 00:52:55,690
Oh flowers! I'll cover you with flowers!

743
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:57,923
Because I don't like it when Mr.Bong is going through a hard time.

744
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:03,469
Kiddo, give up on the analogies.

745
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,100
I made a new batch of stuffed cucumber.

746
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,300
Why don't you come and have some of that?

747
00:53:10,323 --> 00:53:12,257
Come on, let's go.

748
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:17,223
Hey, let go! People are watching!

749
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:20,690
Hurry, hurry!

750
00:53:23,123 --> 00:53:24,690
Hey, wait. Let's go together.

751
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:36,100
Aren't cars not allowed here at night time?

752
00:53:36,123 --> 00:53:38,498
Probably.

753
00:53:38,498 --> 00:53:41,290
Then why did you go in? What if we get caught?

754
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:43,457
Just don't get caught.

755
00:53:43,457 --> 00:53:46,590
Isn't it exciting doing something we're not supposed to do?

756
00:53:47,823 --> 00:53:49,990
As long as we don't get caught.

757
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,100
Baek Seung Jo, you had this in you?

758
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:04,700
I had no idea.

759
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,900
That's cool.

760
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,600
I'm all kinds of charming you don't know about.

761
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,900
You're in big trouble now.

762
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:16,890
You've totally fallen for the magic that is Baek Seung Jo.

763
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:52,090
Hello?

764
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:56,057
This is a collect call. . .

765
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:05,700
Hae Ra, it's Kyung Soo! Press 1, press 1!

766
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:11,000
If you would like to continue, press 1 and if not, please hang up.

767
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:19,923
Hae Ra, thanks for accepting the call.

768
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,600
Making a collect call?

769
00:55:21,623 --> 00:55:23,490
Ah, I'm sorry.

770
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:27,657
It's just that it's Christmas Eve.
What are you doing? Where are you?

771
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,523
I'm out with my friends.

772
00:55:31,657 --> 00:55:34,257
Oh my, why in the world would I think of you, Sunbae?

773
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:38,590
Really, little by little.

774
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:45,123
Do you eat well in the army?

775
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,900
I thought this year would be the busiest, but it's the most quiet.

776
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:06,257
I like it. It's been awhile since I was able to spend time with you like this.

777
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:11,857
Does he not have any plans? Why didn't he go out?

778
00:56:14,223 --> 00:56:16,990
Anyway...
Merry Christmas!

779
00:56:20,757 --> 00:56:22,790
You're the Sunbae now.

780
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:26,723
I still haven't met a patient.

781
00:56:27,557 --> 00:56:29,890
You already saved someone.

782
00:56:30,457 --> 00:56:32,723
And killed a mannequin.

783
00:56:34,957 --> 00:56:39,623
Truthfully, I feel weird.

784
00:56:39,623 --> 00:56:43,690
It's really different from practicing on a mannequin.

785
00:56:44,557 --> 00:56:47,823
I didn't get scared.

786
00:56:47,823 --> 00:56:51,290
All I could think about was having to save her.

787
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,800
I even forgot that I had a date with you.

788
00:56:58,423 --> 00:57:03,590
I had purely wanted to get into the nursing program because of you.

789
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:12,400
It was much more amazing than what I had thought.

790
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:19,623
I'm thinking about reapplying.

791
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:21,990
I'll help you.

792
00:57:27,457 --> 00:57:31,390
It's a cool Christmas.

793
00:57:32,057 --> 00:57:34,390
It's Christmas year round,

794
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,500
if I'm with you.

795
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,300
Merry Christmas.

796
00:57:41,757 --> 00:57:43,723
Merry Christmas.

797
00:57:45,323 --> 00:57:47,690
Hey, what if someone saw us?

798
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:49,857
Who's going to see us?

799
00:57:52,023 --> 00:57:54,790
[Hey!]

800
00:58:01,957 --> 00:58:06,657
Hey, they say the calm cats are the first to climb up the wall..

801
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,100
Were you always so quick to move?!

802
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,900
What?

803
00:58:10,957 --> 00:58:12,357
What did you say?

804
00:58:15,157 --> 00:58:18,590
[Hey! Hey Oh Ha Ni...]

805
00:58:20,857 --> 00:58:21,823
Here please.

806
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:22,890
Yes.

807
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:24,623
Excuse me. Please give us three more side dishes.

808
00:58:24,623 --> 00:58:26,590
Here you go.

809
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:28,157
Excuse me!

810
00:58:28,157 --> 00:58:29,923
Okay.

811
00:58:37,157 --> 00:58:38,623
Thank you.

812
00:58:38,623 --> 00:58:39,390
Yes.

813
00:58:41,923 --> 00:58:43,490
Who should I make this out to?

814
00:58:43,623 --> 00:58:44,923
Lee Jin Ki (?)

815
00:59:01,257 --> 00:59:02,490
Salute!

816
00:59:27,957 --> 00:59:29,023
Here.

817
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:35,923
This is good.

818
00:59:35,923 --> 00:59:37,223
What is it?

819
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:47,157
Who are you here for?

820
00:59:47,823 --> 00:59:49,423
I'm here to visit soldier Wang Kyung Soo.

821
00:59:49,423 --> 00:59:53,357
Yes. Hey - open the gate.

822
00:59:57,923 --> 00:59:59,157
Have a nice day!

823
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:01,823
Have a good visit!

824
01:00:01,823 --> 01:00:02,523
Goodbye!

825
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,622
I love you.

826
01:00:38,399 --> 01:00:43,899
