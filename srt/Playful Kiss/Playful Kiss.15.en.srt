1
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,379
Everybody listen here!

2
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:42,700
Yes ?

3
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,167
I also have something to say.

4
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,033
Everyone please free your schedule on next Wednesday.

5
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:52,233
But... I'm going to play golf with Mr. Yoon on that day.

6
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:54,633
Ah, me too. I have to go somewhere with the shop workers on that day.

7
00:00:54,633 --> 00:00:57,000
I can't either. I got invited to a birthday party.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,700
Me too.

9
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,853
Ah okay. Cancel it all.

10
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:01,833
Why?
Why?

11
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,700
What's happening that day?

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,739
Your wedding.

13
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,200
W-w-wedding?!

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,333
Ah, please stop controlling us any which way you please.

15
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,533
Omo! Who's deciding?

16
00:01:16,767 --> 00:01:19,500
You said you want to get married.
I said after graduation!

17
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,700
When will that be? You have to become an intern, then a resident and you have to do your military service, too.

18
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,900
What's the point of delaying? It's better to do it now, when you're still pretty and youthful.

19
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,379
But....

20
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:32,367
- The birthday party ....
- Stop!

21
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:34,600
don't say anything else right now!

22
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,967
Do you have any idea how hard it is for me to reserve a wedding hall?

23
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:42,833
On that day, clear out all your schedules and you need to help each other out, alright?

24
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,233
You're still awake?

25
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:17,167
Ah... Yes.. .Yes.

26
00:02:22,481 --> 00:02:24,133
What is it?

27
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,533
Did I go overboard by doing what I please?

28
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:29,767
That... that's not it.

29
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:33,141
We're living together anyway.

30
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:38,833
I thought they might as well be married, and it would look better in the eyes of others too.

31
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:43,600
Oh I see. Honestly that was bothering me a bit too.

32
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,400
Thank you for everything.

33
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,800
But... Why are you like this? Your expression doesn't look good.

34
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,567
No, I'm doing good. It's just that I don't know what to start preparing first.

35
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:06,633
What is there to prepare?We already live together so there is nothing to buy, and the wedding hall has been booked.

36
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:10,200
We just need a dress and a ring, then everything will be fine.

37
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,300
Still...

38
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,767
Next Wednesday?!!!

39
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:19,533
Yeah.

40
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,233
Seung Jo's mother has some serious drive.

41
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:24,467
That's right.

42
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,667
Hey, did you guys cause some sort of accident?

43
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:33,667
Ya! It's not that!

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,600
Ah yes.

45
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,600
Does Bong Joon Gu knows?

46
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:43,767
Um... My dad has told him.

47
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:51,300
So that's why he looked so down in the dumps. He didn't even notice us when we came.

48
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:54,200
Hey, did you pick your dress?

49
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,733
You have to buy your ring too.

50
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:58,600
We have to start now. I'm busy.

51
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,200
Welc....

52
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,833
Sir!

53
00:04:14,044 --> 00:04:15,333
Hey hurry and talk to me.

54
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,267
Hey, let's eat!

55
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:18,197
Eat well!

56
00:04:18,197 --> 00:04:22,800
Sir, sir! A foreigner came! She is right over there, a foreigner!

57
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,433
Oh.

58
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,033
Hi.

59
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:27,867
Hi.

60
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,200
Thank you.

61
00:04:31,767 --> 00:04:34,267
Ha Ni, hurry up and take her order.

62
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,833
Me?

63
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,400
I can't speak English.

64
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,167
But, you're a college student. Hurry up!

65
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:44,067
Hi.

66
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:45,033
Hi.

67
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:47,400
How are you?

68
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:53,700
I . . . want to eat noodles!
Please give me chopped noodles.

69
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,467
She speaks korean very well.

70
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:11,067
What is it?

71
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:14,767
It's mushroom. Pine mushrooms.

72
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:17,033
Ah, pine mushrooms.

73
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:19,867
The scent . . . The scent is very nice!

74
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:21,600
How do you speak Korean so well?

75
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,033
My mom is Korean, but my dad is English.

76
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:27,933
I came to Korea to see my mother's hometown.

77
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:30,500
I have to go home in 10 days.

78
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,867
Ah... yeah.

79
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:39,133
It's delicious. Very, very delicious.

80
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:42,200
That's stuffed cucumber kimchi.

81
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:48,133
That guy over there made it!

82
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:51,300
This tastes good! It's killer!

83
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:57,500
He is from Busan, so he's a little curt.

84
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,100
Ah... Yes...

85
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:22,033
How was the one we saw before?

86
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:23,100
It's too showy.

87
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,267
Really ?

88
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:28,300
Then what about this one? This one is pretty.

89
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,967
I don't like it. It's too shiny.

90
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:35,467
Then, you choose it.

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,067
Hey! Do we have to get rings?

92
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,267
What are you talking about? It's a symbol of love.

93
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:44,000
A symbol of love?

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,967
Hey! How can something so materialistic be a symbol of love?

95
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:49,200
I'm not doing this!

96
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,667
No! You have to do it!

97
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,567
There needs to be a sign that you're a married man.

98
00:06:56,733 --> 00:07:01,133
So it's not really a symbol of love but more like shackles.

99
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:28,633
Forget it! What's there to buy when you only wear it that one day?

100
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:30,167
I have a suit already.

101
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:33,733
Still! Let's go in! I'm going to look for a dress.

102
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:36,533
Then go buy it and come back.
I'll go somewhere and wait for you.

103
00:07:38,267 --> 00:07:41,833
OK! Then, let's go to the studio.

104
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,067
Studio? Why?

105
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:46,833
Why? It's for the photo album shoot.

106
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,100
Photo album shoot?

107
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,667
Hey! I'm not doing that.

108
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:52,767
Husband look over here, bride smile a bit more...

109
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,367
You want me to do that silly thing?

110
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:56,500
Never.

111
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,533
This isn't fair. You don't want to match rings. You don't want to do the album photo shoot as well.

112
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:02,133
Why did you come out with me if you were going to be like this?

113
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:03,667
Do you think I came because I wanted to?

114
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:05,300
I came out just because they wanted me to.

115
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,900
Anyways, you came out. Can't you just put up with it and help?

116
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:13,533
You've only been irritated and saying you don't like this and that!

117
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,533
Hey. Why are you speaking like this in the street?

118
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:16,833
It's embarrassing.

119
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:20,233
Embarrassing? I'm embarrassed too!

120
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,000
What do you think the people at the rings store thought about us?

121
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:25,733
Why should I have to continually match your wants and needs?

122
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:26,933
Don't then.

123
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,000
If I don't... .What if I don't hold it in either?!

124
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,932
Now I see why couples break up before even getting married.

125
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:39,900
What?

126
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:53,267
I'm telling you now. Even after marrying you, I won't be able to just look to you.

127
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,333
I can't adjust myself for you.

128
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:58,933
When did you ever?

129
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,067
Really...

130
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:03,033
What's all this? It's because of my mom.

131
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,900
It's not because of Mother (in-law).

132
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:10,767
If so, why did you say you were going to marry me?

133
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:15,867
Yeah. I'm regretting why I said that.

134
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:20,900
I think we should think about it again.

135
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:34,000
Really?

136
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,800
So you weren't able to get your dress yet?

137
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:41,300
He doesn't even talk to me at home.

138
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:43,433
When we run into one another he avoids me.

139
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:46,267
What? There's not many days left...

140
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:49,467
He said he regrets asking me to marry him,

141
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:51,300
and that we should think it over.

142
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:56,333
No, you know how Baek Seung Jo is normally cold like that.

143
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,900
Even if he says that, he doesn't mean it.

144
00:10:18,925 --> 00:10:21,111
The business hours are over.

145
00:10:22,111 --> 00:10:23,378
Oh, Seung Jo!

146
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:26,423
Come on in!

147
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:33,278
Have a seat.

148
00:10:36,205 --> 00:10:37,945
You were reading a book?

149
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:41,678
From a dad to his daughter...

150
00:10:41,678 --> 00:10:43,978
I wanted to talk to her about it.

151
00:10:44,638 --> 00:10:46,881
What brought you here at this time?

152
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:50,445
I have something to tell you.

153
00:10:58,378 --> 00:11:00,467
Doesn't it look beautiful?

154
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:05,431
It would be nice drinking coffee with those cups.

155
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,678
Yes, it looks beautiful.

156
00:11:07,678 --> 00:11:10,745
Why does a bride-to-be's face look so upset?

157
00:11:10,745 --> 00:11:12,578
Is Seung Jo being a pain?

158
00:11:12,578 --> 00:11:14,078
No.

159
00:11:15,144 --> 00:11:17,178
Wow, how beautiful.

160
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:28,745
Hey Dad.

161
00:11:28,745 --> 00:11:30,478
Ha Ni, what are you doing?

162
00:11:32,531 --> 00:11:34,411
Oh, is that so?

163
00:11:35,831 --> 00:11:37,011
Then come here for a moment.

164
00:11:37,011 --> 00:11:38,378
Now?

165
00:11:38,978 --> 00:11:42,011
Why, did something happen?

166
00:11:42,678 --> 00:11:44,245
Date?

167
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:50,111
I understand. I'm coming now.

168
00:12:04,545 --> 00:12:05,145
Dad..

169
00:12:05,145 --> 00:12:07,178
Oh! Ha Ni.

170
00:12:22,411 --> 00:12:24,538
Where are we going?

171
00:12:24,538 --> 00:12:26,593
Where are we going, exactly?

172
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:29,078
You will find out once we get there.

173
00:13:14,011 --> 00:13:20,678
Seung Jo wanted to greet your grandmother and mother.

174
00:13:20,678 --> 00:13:23,278
I was busy so I forgot about it.

175
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,545
Nice to meet you, Mother.

176
00:13:27,578 --> 00:13:29,211
Grandmother...

177
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,278
Your grandson-in-law is here.

178
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:37,221
Do you like it?

179
00:13:40,178 --> 00:13:44,311
I'm worried because Oh Ha Ni isn't listening to me already,

180
00:13:44,311 --> 00:13:46,478
but you don't have to worry.

181
00:13:46,478 --> 00:13:49,645
I will take care of her.

182
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:53,078
I hate you.

183
00:13:54,178 --> 00:13:55,711
Hate ?

184
00:13:57,345 --> 00:13:59,245
I like it.

185
00:14:00,811 --> 00:14:02,678
Thank you.

186
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:08,778
Mom..

187
00:14:09,511 --> 00:14:11,333
Grandmom..

188
00:14:12,345 --> 00:14:14,311
I'm getting married.

189
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:26,778
Kyung Soo sunbae is going to be the host.

190
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:31,011
Officiator. Let's not have an officiator.

191
00:14:31,011 --> 00:14:32,645
What about our honeymoon?

192
00:14:32,645 --> 00:14:35,178
Where are we going for our honeymoon?

193
00:14:35,178 --> 00:14:38,145
Do we have to go? We don't have much time.

194
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:39,911
There you go again!

195
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:41,345
Fine, fine.

196
00:14:42,211 --> 00:14:45,311
Where? Is there a place you would like to go?

197
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:48,378
Yes! Italy? Perhaps Rome!

198
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:50,011
Rome?

199
00:14:50,011 --> 00:14:52,545
Rome? In your dreams.

200
00:14:52,545 --> 00:14:58,378
I was just joking. Even if it's not far away, I hope we go to an island.

201
00:14:58,378 --> 00:14:59,811
Island. Okay then

202
00:15:00,545 --> 00:15:01,978
Alright then.

203
00:15:02,145 --> 00:15:03,878
How about Yeo Eui Do?

204
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:05,845
Yeo Eui Do?

205
00:15:05,845 --> 00:15:07,211
Why?

206
00:15:07,211 --> 00:15:09,345
Yeo Eui Do was once an island as well

207
00:15:09,345 --> 00:15:12,311
Or...Bam Island?

208
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,011
Right!...Ddook I sland!

209
00:15:14,178 --> 00:15:16,311
Ddook Island?!

210
00:15:16,911 --> 00:15:19,211
How annoying.

211
00:15:21,245 --> 00:15:22,778
Fine.

212
00:15:22,778 --> 00:15:24,611
Let's determine with this.

213
00:15:24,611 --> 00:15:28,278
If 3 of the same pictures appear after a shake...

214
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:30,178
we'll go to the place you wish.

215
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:31,745
Okay.

216
00:15:31,745 --> 00:15:34,445
But isn't there only a small possibility?

217
00:15:34,445 --> 00:15:35,878
No.

218
00:15:37,345 --> 00:15:39,645
Jeju island, jeju island, jeju island.

219
00:15:39,645 --> 00:15:40,178
Yeo Eui Do...

220
00:15:40,178 --> 00:15:43,378
Jeju Island! Jeju Island!

221
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:48,411
It's Jeju Island. Wow!! Hooray!

222
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:52,811
Yes! Jeju Island!

223
00:15:53,645 --> 00:15:56,411
Yay!

224
00:15:58,178 --> 00:16:00,045
Hurray!

225
00:16:00,845 --> 00:16:03,211
How does it feel? It's tomorrow.

226
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:05,845
I don't know. It still hasn't hit me yet.

227
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:07,111
Have you packed your bag?

228
00:16:07,111 --> 00:16:08,811
Yeah, just the basics.

229
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:16,345
Surprise!

230
00:16:16,911 --> 00:16:17,945
What ,is it?

231
00:16:17,945 --> 00:16:19,111
Open it.

232
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,611
Oh my.

233
00:16:21,645 --> 00:16:23,345
Just rip it open, like this.

234
00:16:23,345 --> 00:16:24,545
Okay.

235
00:16:30,178 --> 00:16:31,011
Hey!!

236
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:33,578
What do you mean "Hey"?

237
00:16:33,578 --> 00:16:35,678
We searched on the Internet.

238
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:40,778
They said that the most important thing on the honeymoon is underwear and nightwear.

239
00:16:40,778 --> 00:16:42,545
And fragrance.

240
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:46,378
See.
You take a shower first.

241
00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:49,311
Seung Jo oppa!

242
00:16:49,611 --> 00:16:53,345
Then you wear this underwear all sexy, like this.

243
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:57,511
And you spray some of the fragrance.

244
00:16:59,145 --> 00:17:01,811
When you take a shower, there is an important point.

245
00:17:01,811 --> 00:17:02,345
What is it?

246
00:17:02,345 --> 00:17:06,078
Never, ever, hum to yourself.

247
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:06,911
Why is that?

248
00:17:06,911 --> 00:17:10,245
Men get scared when you are too powerful.

249
00:17:10,245 --> 00:17:12,711
I see.

250
00:17:12,711 --> 00:17:15,711
Hey, does Baek Seung Jo kiss well?

251
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:16,711
Hey!

252
00:17:16,711 --> 00:17:18,445
- Tell me.
- Does he kiss well?

253
00:17:18,445 --> 00:17:19,511
Hey!

254
00:17:19,511 --> 00:17:20,611
Was he good?! Was he good?!

255
00:17:20,611 --> 00:17:22,078
How did he do it?!

256
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:24,211
Stop!

257
00:17:27,511 --> 00:17:30,211
Here...

258
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:32,178
What is that?

259
00:17:32,745 --> 00:17:35,478
It's just silverware and a china set.

260
00:17:35,478 --> 00:17:37,445
Hey! Why did you buy this?

261
00:17:37,445 --> 00:17:40,945
I hear even if you do nothing, this is something you have to do.

262
00:17:40,945 --> 00:17:44,745
I also bought a set of blankets.

263
00:17:44,745 --> 00:17:46,411
It's in the room, but I don't know if you'll like it.

264
00:17:46,411 --> 00:17:48,211
Oh my!

265
00:17:48,211 --> 00:17:51,778
In law, please look to us kindly!

266
00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:52,945
Yes.

267
00:17:52,945 --> 00:17:55,311
Please look to me kindly too, in law!

268
00:17:57,078 --> 00:17:59,811
What to do.

269
00:18:10,578 --> 00:18:11,778
Hyung.

270
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:16,311
Are you asleep?

271
00:18:17,178 --> 00:18:18,545
No.

272
00:18:18,545 --> 00:18:21,545
So you're eventually getting married to Oh Ha Ni.

273
00:18:22,378 --> 00:18:24,078
It seems so.

274
00:18:24,078 --> 00:18:26,211
Why, you don't like it?

275
00:18:26,211 --> 00:18:28,145
Of course.

276
00:18:28,145 --> 00:18:32,211
Oh Ha Ni isn't smart and she's clumsy.

277
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,511
More than anything, she's stupid.

278
00:18:35,111 --> 00:18:40,078
Doesn't even know how to swim but tried to save me.

279
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:45,045
Even though you're mean to her, she smiles about liking you.

280
00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:51,945
I'm going to marry a girl much smarter and prettier than Oh Ha Ni.

281
00:18:52,911 --> 00:18:54,011
Okay.

282
00:18:54,011 --> 00:18:58,511
But, I'm all for Hyung and Oh Ha Ni getting married.

283
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:02,078
I like you very much,

284
00:19:02,078 --> 00:19:07,445
but to be honest, it is quite true that your personality has a few issues.

285
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:12,478
And so, I think that you should marry a person like Oh Ha Ni.

286
00:19:12,478 --> 00:19:16,011
You're doing the right thing. Congrats.

287
00:19:50,478 --> 00:19:52,378
Ha Ni,

288
00:19:52,378 --> 00:19:57,011
I'm really happy right now,

289
00:19:57,011 --> 00:20:04,145
because you're probably really happy right now.

290
00:20:05,778 --> 00:20:07,645
When you're happy,

291
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:14,278
I'm happy as well.

292
00:20:15,345 --> 00:20:18,378
Congratulations, Oh Ha Ni.

293
00:20:19,611 --> 00:20:21,811
Have beautiful dreams

294
00:20:22,745 --> 00:20:24,378
and I'll see you tomorrow.

295
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,924
Dad.

296
00:21:07,978 --> 00:21:10,221
Why aren't you sleeping?

297
00:21:14,534 --> 00:21:16,749
I can't sleep.

298
00:21:16,749 --> 00:21:18,298
How about you?

299
00:21:22,108 --> 00:21:23,736
Me too.

300
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,077
Dad.

301
00:21:31,698 --> 00:21:33,288
Yes?

302
00:21:34,686 --> 00:21:36,876
Thank you

303
00:21:36,876 --> 00:21:39,376
for raising me this well.

304
00:21:43,832 --> 00:21:45,042
Oh

305
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:48,037
Don't cry.

306
00:21:48,657 --> 00:21:50,742
If your eyes get swollen,

307
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:54,709
other people tomorrow will say that the bride's not pretty.

308
00:21:57,172 --> 00:21:58,632
Oh ?

309
00:21:59,242 --> 00:22:01,806
I said not to cry.

310
00:22:01,806 --> 00:22:04,037
Why do you cry when it's such a happy day?

311
00:22:06,524 --> 00:22:08,676
I will smile too.

312
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,952
You too, have to smile tomorrow, ok?

313
00:22:13,434 --> 00:22:15,813
The only daughter of a widowed father.

314
00:22:16,976 --> 00:22:20,949
If she cries on her wedding day her life will be rainy.

315
00:22:20,949 --> 00:22:22,817
Okay.

316
00:22:22,817 --> 00:22:24,509
I will smile.

317
00:22:25,322 --> 00:22:27,109
Yeah.

318
00:22:29,842 --> 00:22:31,693
Dad...

319
00:22:31,693 --> 00:22:32,538
Mm?

320
00:22:32,538 --> 00:22:34,693
Do you want to practice?

321
00:22:36,276 --> 00:22:37,658
Yeah.

322
00:22:52,597 --> 00:22:54,376
S....s...

323
00:22:54,376 --> 00:22:56,809
Ready, start.

324
00:23:33,046 --> 00:23:36,005
Aigoo.

325
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,088
Hello. Hello.

326
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,574
You must be very happy to get a new daughter-in-law.

327
00:23:43,574 --> 00:23:46,677
This is my son.

328
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:48,389
Congratulations.

329
00:23:48,389 --> 00:23:50,914
I hear you're working on a new business.

330
00:23:50,914 --> 00:23:53,533
- Oh sir you're here!
-Congratulations.

331
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:55,120
- I need to come even if I'm busy!
- Oh thank yoU!

332
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,742
One, two, three!

333
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:00,008
Me too!

334
00:24:00,008 --> 00:24:03,098
-Min Ah, Min Ah come here!
- Stand next to Ju Ri.

335
00:24:03,098 --> 00:24:05,232
I'll be compared to Min Ah then.

336
00:24:06,142 --> 00:24:08,316
I'm going to take it!

337
00:24:09,402 --> 00:24:10,970
Teacher!

338
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,542
Teacher.

339
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:15,209
Hi!

340
00:24:15,209 --> 00:24:17,476
Congratulations, Ha Ni!

341
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:21,742
Congratulations.

342
00:24:21,742 --> 00:24:24,517
You are pregnant?

343
00:24:27,486 --> 00:24:29,776
What happened to you!??

344
00:24:29,776 --> 00:24:32,313
It's embarrassing!

345
00:24:32,313 --> 00:24:34,020
Ha Ni, congratulations!

346
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,909
Marrying with Seung Jo, you're epic!!

347
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,676
You've succeeded!

348
00:24:39,676 --> 00:24:41,040
You've done it!

349
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,804
Ha Ni, see you later.

350
00:24:42,804 --> 00:24:45,260
Thank you for coming.

351
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,710
You look pretty!

352
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,858
Ha Ni, congratulations!

353
00:24:48,858 --> 00:24:50,577
You look really beautiful!

354
00:24:50,577 --> 00:24:53,709
Teachers getting married is pretty epic too.

355
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:55,922
Did you see that? You will one day get pregnant, too
Won't you?

356
00:25:09,142 --> 00:25:10,842
You look pretty.

357
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,709
You too.

358
00:25:12,709 --> 00:25:15,209
I feel good that it's you.

359
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:16,246
Hmm?

360
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:23,541
I feel good that Baek Seung Jo chose you, not me.

361
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:26,942
Yeah. This is why I like him.

362
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,442
I'm thinking like that.

363
00:25:29,442 --> 00:25:30,442
It's hard.

364
00:25:30,442 --> 00:25:31,976
What's hard?

365
00:25:31,976 --> 00:25:34,342
Baek Seung Jo has good taste in girls.

366
00:25:34,342 --> 00:25:36,442
That's what I mean.

367
00:25:36,442 --> 00:25:37,976
Hae Ra.

368
00:25:37,976 --> 00:25:39,630
Be happy,

369
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,142
so I become jealous and marry quickly.

370
00:25:42,142 --> 00:25:44,152
Okay, I'll try hard.

371
00:25:44,152 --> 00:25:45,676
Don't try hard.

372
00:25:45,676 --> 00:25:48,042
I feel scared when you say that you're going to try hard.

373
00:25:48,042 --> 00:25:50,842
Oh Ha Ni's patience and perseverance...

374
00:25:50,842 --> 00:25:52,906
To top that off if Oh Ha Ni tries hard too...

375
00:25:52,906 --> 00:25:54,742
Everyone's dead...

376
00:25:54,742 --> 00:25:56,242
All right.

377
00:25:59,409 --> 00:26:00,909
Congratulations.

378
00:26:02,776 --> 00:26:04,242
Thank you.

379
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:07,209
See you later.

380
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:20,614
You came?

381
00:26:20,614 --> 00:26:22,942
Ya, you look happy. You're smiling very wide.

382
00:26:22,942 --> 00:26:24,965
Your mouth looks like it's going to rip.

383
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:27,701
You look good.

384
00:26:27,701 --> 00:26:29,042
Of course.

385
00:26:29,642 --> 00:26:34,542
Be careful, Ha Ni might change her mind after seeing me.

386
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:38,776
I could run away with her.

387
00:26:38,776 --> 00:26:41,525
Ladies and gentlemen.

388
00:26:41,525 --> 00:26:49,121
Soon, bridegroom Baek Seung Jo and the bride Oh Ha Ni's wedding will start.

389
00:26:49,121 --> 00:26:50,776
What do I do, Eun Jo?

390
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,042
It's going to start.

391
00:26:52,042 --> 00:26:53,376
Are you nervous?

392
00:26:54,176 --> 00:26:57,954
Don't make mistakes again,

393
00:26:57,954 --> 00:27:01,542
whether you drop the ring or you step on your own dress and slip.

394
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:02,842
Hey.

395
00:27:02,842 --> 00:27:04,509
Don't say things like that.

396
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:07,642
Do you want

397
00:27:07,642 --> 00:27:10,709
me to give you a wedding present?

398
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:12,342
Gift?

399
00:27:12,342 --> 00:27:13,609
Yeah. What is it?

400
00:27:13,609 --> 00:27:15,376
Give me your ears.

401
00:27:20,892 --> 00:27:22,176
What?!

402
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:37,242
Ah, as you see, there's no officiator in this wedding,

403
00:28:37,242 --> 00:28:43,076
so we'll have the two of them doing their own officiating.

404
00:28:43,842 --> 00:28:45,609
Start.

405
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:52,776
I, Baek Seung Jo,

406
00:28:52,776 --> 00:28:57,309
will respect and love my bride, Oh Ha Ni, whatever it takes,

407
00:28:57,309 --> 00:28:59,176
will respect the elders,

408
00:28:59,176 --> 00:29:01,576
will be a good husband to her,

409
00:29:01,576 --> 00:29:04,076
I promise.

410
00:29:05,342 --> 00:29:06,609
I, Oh Ha Ni,

411
00:29:06,609 --> 00:29:08,776
with groom Baek Seung Jo,

412
00:29:08,776 --> 00:29:12,342
will love and respect forever whatever it takes.

413
00:29:12,342 --> 00:29:18,409
I promise I will respect the elders, and be a good wife to him.

414
00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:25,676
This bride's dad is a very old friend of mine.

415
00:29:26,442 --> 00:29:31,609
Until junior high, it was as if I lived at his house.

416
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:33,776
He's done a lot for me.

417
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:39,342
It was like that back then, and it was like that once we met again too.

418
00:29:39,342 --> 00:29:45,905
I always thought that there couldn't be a warmer and nicer person than him.

419
00:29:45,905 --> 00:29:50,576
This amazing friend of mine has now become my in law.

420
00:29:52,509 --> 00:29:54,376
My friend,

421
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:58,009
thank you for letting your well raised daughter marry my son.

422
00:29:59,852 --> 00:30:03,285
After thinking about what I should say,

423
00:30:04,118 --> 00:30:08,452
I remembered my short married life.

424
00:30:08,452 --> 00:30:13,518
On our wedding day, it snowed a lot.

425
00:30:14,752 --> 00:30:20,285
And on Christmas eve, while we were eating the leftover noodles,

426
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:24,032
we said "Merry Christmas"

427
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:25,952
to each other.

428
00:30:25,952 --> 00:30:30,952
After that, Ha Ni came and my wife passed.

429
00:30:31,818 --> 00:30:36,985
I was holding Ha Ni and crying.

430
00:30:36,985 --> 00:30:39,585
I remembered all that.

431
00:30:40,185 --> 00:30:46,360
Like how my mother-in-law would call her Noah's snail all the time.

432
00:30:47,252 --> 00:30:54,818
She knew what road to take, and she is a child who took that road smiling.

433
00:30:55,118 --> 00:31:02,218
I was always sad and sorry about her being alone.

434
00:31:03,118 --> 00:31:10,785
From today, since a caring and cool groom is going with her,

435
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:14,418
my heart is put at ease and I'm reassured.

436
00:31:16,452 --> 00:31:19,052
Thank you, Seung Jo.

437
00:31:20,118 --> 00:31:24,585
Go with Ha Ni to the end.

438
00:31:31,052 --> 00:31:34,218
It is time for the ring exchange.

439
00:31:34,218 --> 00:31:38,018
Groom and bride, please exchange rings.

440
00:32:11,885 --> 00:32:13,052
What to do?

441
00:32:17,085 --> 00:32:18,852
Here it is!

442
00:32:31,385 --> 00:32:33,152
Thank you.

443
00:32:36,785 --> 00:32:38,952
Dummy.

444
00:32:39,485 --> 00:32:41,885
Don't tease me, Baek Seung Jo,

445
00:32:41,985 --> 00:32:44,552
when you actually like me a lot,

446
00:32:44,552 --> 00:32:46,785
starting from a long time ago too.

447
00:32:46,785 --> 00:32:48,052
What?

448
00:32:48,518 --> 00:32:49,585
What are you talking about?

449
00:32:49,585 --> 00:32:54,985
The second kiss. Instead of in the rain, it was at the pension wasn't it?

450
00:32:54,985 --> 00:32:57,552
I was sleeping, how childish.

451
00:33:02,152 --> 00:33:04,785
After doing that, being so coy.

452
00:33:24,485 --> 00:33:25,785
What is this?

453
00:33:26,318 --> 00:33:30,585
Everyone, the bride is really bold!

454
00:33:34,718 --> 00:33:37,018
Look at you now.

455
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:44,452
Everyone let's give the bride and groom a round of applause!

456
00:34:06,585 --> 00:34:08,818
Wow! It's so cool!

457
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:12,185
Can we get out and see the ocean for a little while and then go?

458
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:17,185
Let's see it and go, huh? Let's see the ocean and go!

459
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:31,685
It's so pretty!

460
00:34:31,685 --> 00:34:34,018
Look at the color of the ocean.

461
00:34:34,018 --> 00:34:36,252
It's really pretty, isn't it?

462
00:34:42,185 --> 00:34:44,985
I feel like I've come to the South Pacific.

463
00:34:44,985 --> 00:34:47,418
How can the ocean be that blue?

464
00:34:51,118 --> 00:34:53,285
What?

465
00:34:53,285 --> 00:34:55,618
Are you still mad?

466
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,485
If you're done looking, let's go.

467
00:34:57,485 --> 00:35:03,218
The growing of our two lovebirds, the bride and groom,

468
00:35:03,218 --> 00:35:05,452
has been prepared through a video.

469
00:35:05,452 --> 00:35:11,085
Please continue eating the food in front of you, and let's appreciate this together.

470
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:25,518
Since she was a baby, her beauty was different from others

471
00:35:25,518 --> 00:35:32,952
This child, grew up to be a man over there.

472
00:35:42,118 --> 00:35:43,718
Is that hyung?!

473
00:35:43,718 --> 00:35:45,452
Right.

474
00:35:45,452 --> 00:35:47,252
That's hyung.

475
00:35:49,085 --> 00:35:52,918
I feel so much better. From now on, I don't think I can live holding a secret.

476
00:35:52,918 --> 00:35:56,452
Seung Jo, you live lightly too from now on.

477
00:35:56,452 --> 00:35:58,252
Carefree!

478
00:35:59,618 --> 00:36:03,118
Mother-in-law, really. She went overboard.

479
00:36:03,118 --> 00:36:06,318
Even though she was well aware of your temper.

480
00:36:08,152 --> 00:36:09,452
Hey! Where are you going?!

481
00:36:09,452 --> 00:36:12,285
Hey! Stop there! Hey, Baek Seung Jo!!

482
00:36:37,685 --> 00:36:39,985
How long are you going to keep on following me?

483
00:36:39,985 --> 00:36:42,785
Ah, about that...

484
00:36:43,218 --> 00:36:44,785
Hae Ra!

485
00:36:46,852 --> 00:36:48,385
Are you not hungry?

486
00:36:48,385 --> 00:36:51,852
I noticed earlier that you hadn't eaten anything.

487
00:36:54,385 --> 00:36:56,318
Do you want me to buy you food?

488
00:37:09,218 --> 00:37:13,385
It's different from the hotel that I thought of. It's really pretty.

489
00:37:14,018 --> 00:37:15,485
We're over there.

490
00:37:15,485 --> 00:37:16,985
Oh, how frustrating!

491
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:19,818
What kind of man has so little strength?

492
00:37:19,818 --> 00:37:21,152
I'm sorry.

493
00:37:23,818 --> 00:37:26,718
Oh, what's up with this? Are you staying here?

494
00:37:28,152 --> 00:37:29,718
Do you not remember?

495
00:37:29,718 --> 00:37:34,385
We sat next to each other on the plane.

496
00:37:34,818 --> 00:37:35,885
Ah, yes.

497
00:37:35,885 --> 00:37:37,218
Ah, check-in. Check-in!

498
00:37:37,218 --> 00:37:38,218
Oh okay.

499
00:37:39,018 --> 00:37:42,185
Couldn't even find the hotel gate. Making me come in through the back.

500
00:37:42,185 --> 00:37:44,185
Ah, I'm really going to go crazy.

501
00:37:45,218 --> 00:37:49,318
I didn't notice while I was sitting next to you earlier, but you're really handsome.

502
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:50,885
You could be an actor!

503
00:37:50,885 --> 00:37:52,485
Ah, then we'll be leaving first.

504
00:37:52,485 --> 00:37:53,685
Let's go.

505
00:37:57,318 --> 00:37:59,252
Oh, excuse me!

506
00:38:03,618 --> 00:38:06,618
You must really like hot dogs.

507
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:10,236
Do you not like hot dogs that much?

508
00:38:10,236 --> 00:38:11,518
Should we go eat something else?

509
00:38:11,518 --> 00:38:13,685
No, it's okay.

510
00:38:13,685 --> 00:38:15,318
Please eat.

511
00:38:21,017 --> 00:38:24,485
Do you want me to tell you something fun?

512
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:25,785
Eye booger.

513
00:38:25,785 --> 00:38:26,717
What?

514
00:38:38,852 --> 00:38:40,552
What is this?

515
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:45,718
What is this? Hot Dog Eating Competition.

516
00:38:46,552 --> 00:38:50,952
If you can eat 30 in ten minutes, you qualify for the competition in New York.

517
00:38:50,952 --> 00:38:53,418
They can go to New York.

518
00:38:53,418 --> 00:38:56,918
Between the ages of 20 and 40.

519
00:38:57,185 --> 00:39:00,252
I can do it, I'm 21. Right, right?

520
00:39:00,252 --> 00:39:02,285
Hey this...

521
00:39:02,285 --> 00:39:03,952
Hae Ra, Hae Ra!

522
00:39:04,685 --> 00:39:08,585
If it's 30 hotdogs in 10 minutes, then it's 1 hotdog per 20 seconds.

523
00:39:08,585 --> 00:39:11,852
It can't be done? I think it's possible.

524
00:39:11,852 --> 00:39:12,985
You're going to do it?

525
00:39:12,985 --> 00:39:15,785
I should go for things like that.

526
00:39:15,785 --> 00:39:23,918
I get to eat a lot of hot dogs, I get to go to New York, and I win, the prize which will probably be really big.

527
00:39:23,918 --> 00:39:29,685
If I win and get a prize, I'll buy you yummy stuff.

528
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,885
Let's practice.

529
00:39:31,885 --> 00:39:34,218
I'll eat this.

530
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:36,918
Count from 1 to 20 okay.

531
00:39:36,918 --> 00:39:39,652
1... 2...

532
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,552
You laughed.

533
00:39:50,652 --> 00:39:54,285
Did you not get sick that day?

534
00:39:54,285 --> 00:39:57,918
You practiced tennis real hard for a long time.

535
00:39:59,585 --> 00:40:00,752
I don't get sick over something like that.

536
00:40:00,752 --> 00:40:04,718
What do you mean something like that? You practiced for four hours.

537
00:40:04,718 --> 00:40:08,685
You were there for four hours, sunbae?

538
00:40:12,052 --> 00:40:14,285
Let's eat... hotdog.

539
00:41:05,018 --> 00:41:07,351
It's so nice here.

540
00:41:07,351 --> 00:41:09,018
And the ocean is right in front of our noses.

541
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:11,551
It is really beautiful!

542
00:41:16,284 --> 00:41:17,918
Excuse me...

543
00:41:20,072 --> 00:41:21,884
I'll try hard.

544
00:41:24,551 --> 00:41:27,558
I know I'm not that great with a lot of things,

545
00:41:28,618 --> 00:41:30,384
but I'll try!

546
00:41:30,384 --> 00:41:32,784
I'll be a good wife.

547
00:41:43,484 --> 00:41:45,184
Oh, what do I do!

548
00:41:45,184 --> 00:41:47,351
The environment seems so good.

549
00:41:47,351 --> 00:41:48,784
Oh!

550
00:41:48,784 --> 00:41:51,384
Ah, you're in that room.

551
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:54,484
Our room is over there.

552
00:41:54,484 --> 00:41:56,384
It is really fate!

553
00:42:01,828 --> 00:42:05,359
What is this candle light event?

554
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:10,202
It's our hotel's most popular program for newlyweds on their honeymoon.

555
00:42:10,202 --> 00:42:13,384
You should be pretty pleased with just the meal alone.

556
00:42:13,384 --> 00:42:15,118
The feedback is really good.

557
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:18,451
Grilled pork, eel, and lobster marinade.

558
00:42:18,451 --> 00:42:25,108
Caesar salad as well as live music and picture service.

559
00:42:25,108 --> 00:42:26,318
Should we try this?

560
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:29,088
Alright, we'll take this for our dinner tonight.

561
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,555
Yes, I got it.

562
00:42:30,555 --> 00:42:33,088
We'll contact your room as soon as it's ready.

563
00:42:33,088 --> 00:42:35,721
All you have to do is come to the restaurant next to the pond.

564
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:37,088
Yes.

565
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:42,588
There's only 1 other couple that requested this aside from you. Seeing there's only 2 couples it should be quite cozy.

566
00:42:42,588 --> 00:42:45,321
There's another honeymoon couple?

567
00:42:46,601 --> 00:42:50,588
Our fates are really entwined, don't you think?

568
00:42:52,221 --> 00:42:54,888
We should have just come together from the airport.

569
00:42:54,888 --> 00:42:57,465
We had a really hard time finding it.

570
00:42:57,465 --> 00:42:59,421
I'm not too good with roads.

571
00:42:59,421 --> 00:43:01,892
Is that all?!

572
00:43:02,407 --> 00:43:05,955
But both of you look young.

573
00:43:05,955 --> 00:43:08,988
Yes, we're 21.

574
00:43:09,521 --> 00:43:13,188
But you got married real early.

575
00:43:13,188 --> 00:43:14,221
Yes well...

576
00:43:14,221 --> 00:43:16,196
Shotgun wedding?

577
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:23,721
We're 11 years apart, but it looks more doesn't it?

578
00:43:27,155 --> 00:43:28,612
- Please have some.
- Yes.

579
00:43:31,865 --> 00:43:33,788
You're even good at pouring wine.

580
00:43:39,188 --> 00:43:42,121
Are you taking a shot?!

581
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:47,721
I don't know too much about drinking wine.

582
00:44:04,888 --> 00:44:08,021
Ah, slowly!
Slowly!

583
00:44:08,189 --> 00:44:09,661
I think I'm going to throw up.

584
00:44:10,028 --> 00:44:12,780
Why did you drink so much?

585
00:44:24,661 --> 00:44:25,728
Are you alright?

586
00:44:25,728 --> 00:44:26,953
yeah..

587
00:44:52,285 --> 00:44:54,595
Here you go pork chopped noodles.

588
00:45:00,261 --> 00:45:01,561
Ah!

589
00:45:01,561 --> 00:45:03,128
Give me a fork please!

590
00:45:04,295 --> 00:45:05,565
A fork?

591
00:45:05,565 --> 00:45:07,329
Do you think this is spaghetti?!

592
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:11,461
There's a way to eat all foods. Noodles like this

593
00:45:11,461 --> 00:45:13,555
you use chopsticks and go whoosh whoosh.

594
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,000
You need to eat it like that to get the full taste!

595
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,300
Here.

596
00:45:17,721 --> 00:45:19,661
I don't know how to use chopsticks.

597
00:45:19,661 --> 00:45:21,328
Didn't you say your mother is Korean?

598
00:45:21,328 --> 00:45:23,295
Haven't you learned how to use chopsticks?

599
00:45:25,961 --> 00:45:27,561
Look!

600
00:45:27,561 --> 00:45:29,628
Chopsticks...

601
00:45:29,628 --> 00:45:31,728
You need to know the fundamentals. Fundamentals, okay?

602
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:32,728
Do you know what fundamentals are?

603
00:45:32,728 --> 00:45:33,873
What?

604
00:45:35,408 --> 00:45:40,301
You place the chopstick like this and you only add pressure to here and here.

605
00:45:40,301 --> 00:45:42,484
And the other one you hang it off of here.

606
00:45:42,484 --> 00:45:45,061
And you just move this one like this.

607
00:45:45,061 --> 00:45:48,261
Where in the world are you looking when I'm here explaining it to you?

608
00:45:48,561 --> 00:45:51,795
Here. Not like that, over here.

609
00:45:51,795 --> 00:45:52,928
-Here, here!

610
00:45:52,928 --> 00:45:54,628
That's right.

611
00:46:00,595 --> 00:46:01,551
Wow!

612
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:04,861
How could they build such a big building with adobe?

613
00:46:04,861 --> 00:46:07,628
Once a year they paint the adobe.

614
00:46:07,628 --> 00:46:09,961
You see that thing sticking out?

615
00:46:09,961 --> 00:46:10,531
Yes.

616
00:46:10,531 --> 00:46:12,128
They step on that to climb up--

617
00:46:12,128 --> 00:46:14,461
Oh I see.

618
00:46:14,461 --> 00:46:16,595
How do you know so much, Seung Jo?

619
00:46:16,595 --> 00:46:20,095
Is it because you are a medical student? It'll be fun if we go around together.

620
00:46:20,095 --> 00:46:22,293
I'm going to follow you around like crazy.

621
00:46:22,293 --> 00:46:24,841
Ah! Are you alright?

622
00:46:24,841 --> 00:46:28,628
Do you know you downed two bottles of wine all on your own last night?

623
00:46:29,095 --> 00:46:31,128
Ah! Really?

624
00:46:33,061 --> 00:46:35,201
That's really interesting, right?

625
00:46:36,328 --> 00:46:39,495
Look at this! It's so pretty.

626
00:46:39,495 --> 00:46:40,328
Right?

627
00:46:47,322 --> 00:46:48,757
Look here!

628
00:46:48,757 --> 00:46:49,864
Yes!

629
00:46:49,864 --> 00:46:53,024
If you're the husband, take care of your wife!

630
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:56,124
Why am I stuck in this situation because of your wife?!

631
00:46:56,124 --> 00:46:58,157
I am sorry , Miss Ha Ni!

632
00:46:58,157 --> 00:47:01,157
Truthfully, I am worried too.

633
00:47:01,157 --> 00:47:04,124
Seung Jo is after my wife.

634
00:47:04,124 --> 00:47:05,590
What?

635
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:07,764
Seung Jo?

636
00:47:08,528 --> 00:47:12,724
Seung Jo isn't into women like that! Especially ones that force themselves like that.

637
00:47:12,724 --> 00:47:14,690
Women like that?!

638
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:19,290
Force herself?! My Hyun Ah is friendly and very affectionate.

639
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:24,930
She's misunderstood like that a lot, but she's a genuinely nice girl.

640
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:27,124
She's too good for me!

641
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:33,090
Once we're done here do you want to head to the other museum?

642
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:34,857
I hear it's totally fun there.

643
00:47:34,857 --> 00:47:36,361
Let's go to see!

644
00:47:36,361 --> 00:47:37,457
Let's go!

645
00:47:37,457 --> 00:47:40,890
-Oh, I am sorry!
-What is this?

646
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:07,290
Wow! It is really cute!

647
00:48:08,424 --> 00:48:10,590
Should we buy this for Eun Jo?

648
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:17,157
I don't think we need to buy it for him. Put it down.

649
00:48:19,524 --> 00:48:21,390
Did you see me looking at you?!

650
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:22,324
Oh, really!

651
00:48:22,324 --> 00:48:23,890
I'm here now!

652
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:27,190
Then you should have dressed better! What in the world is this?!

653
00:48:37,524 --> 00:48:39,690
We went to so many places today.

654
00:48:40,424 --> 00:48:42,890
I don't know how many museums we went to.

655
00:48:45,124 --> 00:48:46,757
Aren't you tired?

656
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,124
You had to drive too.

657
00:48:52,024 --> 00:48:54,024
Want to wash up first?

658
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:55,689
Oh!

659
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:58,457
Shall I?

660
00:49:10,824 --> 00:49:12,390
What do I do!

661
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:14,690
The time has finally come.

662
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:18,224
What to do?

663
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:28,124
Who is it?

664
00:49:28,124 --> 00:49:30,890
It is me. Open the door, please.

665
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:33,030
What is it?

666
00:49:36,024 --> 00:49:40,324
Let's have some champagne. This is really good stuff.

667
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:55,855
Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viiikii.net

668
00:49:55,855 --> 00:49:57,499
Hello.

669
00:49:57,499 --> 00:50:01,388
You're a bit late. Would you like a glass of wine?

670
00:50:01,888 --> 00:50:02,955
That's okay.

671
00:50:02,955 --> 00:50:05,222
Have a nice time

672
00:50:08,888 --> 00:50:11,067
Today's the last day.

673
00:50:13,922 --> 00:50:15,288
What is this?

674
00:50:15,288 --> 00:50:16,955
We haven't even been able to take a single picture yet.

675
00:50:16,955 --> 00:50:19,888
You probably don't have to worry about that.

676
00:50:19,888 --> 00:50:21,455
Huh?

677
00:50:21,455 --> 00:50:22,555
Why?

678
00:50:28,088 --> 00:50:33,488
I didn't have time to be with you, only us two.

679
00:50:35,422 --> 00:50:41,659
So, let's hang around with only us two for today, okay?

680
00:50:42,755 --> 00:50:43,707
Okay.

681
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:44,855
Truly?

682
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,700
I look pretty!

683
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,200
This is why he married me I guess

684
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,000
Seung Jo.
Seung Jo.

685
00:51:20,422 --> 00:51:22,788
Where does it hurt?

686
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:26,088
I don't know. It hurts all over.

687
00:51:26,088 --> 00:51:27,455
Hyun Ah...

688
00:51:27,455 --> 00:51:28,955
Just hold on.

689
00:51:33,522 --> 00:51:34,488
Is it here?

690
00:51:35,155 --> 00:51:37,655
No, I don't think it's over there.

691
00:51:38,422 --> 00:51:39,867
Then, here?

692
00:51:44,322 --> 00:51:45,121
Here?

693
00:51:48,322 --> 00:51:49,522
How about here?

694
00:51:50,022 --> 00:51:52,222
Here, this is where it hurts.

695
00:51:52,222 --> 00:51:53,522
Stop It!

696
00:51:54,255 --> 00:51:56,188
Don't touch a woman like that!

697
00:51:56,188 --> 00:51:58,688
Oh Ha Ni. What are you doing now?

698
00:51:58,688 --> 00:52:00,922
I don't like it

699
00:52:00,922 --> 00:52:03,222
when you touch some other woman's body.

700
00:52:03,222 --> 00:52:04,088
I don't like that.

701
00:52:04,088 --> 00:52:09,188
Oh Ha Ni! You married a person that's going to be become a doctor.

702
00:52:10,355 --> 00:52:13,122
What are you going to do if you're jealous of a sick person?

703
00:52:13,122 --> 00:52:15,488
Because I've touched them?!

704
00:52:21,022 --> 00:52:22,555
Miss Ha Ni!

705
00:52:23,122 --> 00:52:24,888
Hurry up and go follow her.

706
00:52:28,055 --> 00:52:29,422
What the!

707
00:52:29,422 --> 00:52:30,888
Gospodična Ha Ni!

708
00:52:36,555 --> 00:52:39,755
Finally, its only us two.

709
00:52:40,455 --> 00:52:43,922
Seung Jo, you don't like Ha Ni right?

710
00:52:43,922 --> 00:52:46,355
You don't want to touch her either, do you?

711
00:52:47,022 --> 00:52:52,055
How unfortunate. You should have met me before Ha Ni.

712
00:52:52,055 --> 00:52:53,822
If that's the case,

713
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:56,988
Then,

714
00:52:57,555 --> 00:52:59,688
I wouldn't have even glanced at you probably.

715
00:52:59,688 --> 00:53:00,388
What?

716
00:53:00,388 --> 00:53:04,488
I have no choice but to deal with you because of where we are right now.

717
00:53:05,288 --> 00:53:07,988
Don't you dare compare something like you to Ha Ni.

718
00:53:43,088 --> 00:53:46,722
I thought you wanted it to be just the two of us? So why are you leaving on your own?

719
00:53:53,222 --> 00:53:54,555
Are you still angry?

720
00:53:57,622 --> 00:53:59,788
Put yourself in my shoes.

721
00:54:01,122 --> 00:54:02,888
It would be weird not to get angry.

722
00:54:04,355 --> 00:54:06,688
But you're pretty when you smile.

723
00:54:12,722 --> 00:54:17,222
When you smile I start to feel good.

724
00:54:24,488 --> 00:54:25,855
It tickles!

725
00:54:25,855 --> 00:54:27,455
Hey, stop it!

726
00:54:29,922 --> 00:54:31,322
Don't!

727
00:54:31,322 --> 00:54:32,988
Don't!

728
00:54:32,988 --> 00:54:34,555
I'm sorry

729
00:54:58,888 --> 00:55:00,155
I'm sorry.

730
00:55:02,855 --> 00:55:05,888
That I acted stupid.

731
00:55:06,888 --> 00:55:09,622
Getting jealous at those things...

732
00:55:12,822 --> 00:55:15,255
Dork.

733
00:55:19,722 --> 00:55:21,755
You're cute.

734
00:55:23,422 --> 00:55:25,355
Every now and then.

735
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:30,588
There are also times when you're beautiful.

736
00:55:31,822 --> 00:55:33,422
From time to time.

737
00:55:37,388 --> 00:55:38,955
But ...

738
00:55:39,388 --> 00:55:41,088
Why do I like you?

739
00:55:43,088 --> 00:55:48,822
You're not that pretty and you're only cute now and then.

740
00:55:48,822 --> 00:55:51,088
Why would I always miss you?

741
00:55:55,622 --> 00:55:56,722
You...

742
00:55:58,422 --> 00:56:00,588
What did you do to me?

743
00:56:20,855 --> 00:56:21,788
Hey...

744
00:56:23,688 --> 00:56:25,722
Wait a minute...

745
00:56:27,655 --> 00:56:31,622
I have something to prepare...

746
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:34,122
Prepare what?

747
00:56:34,122 --> 00:56:36,288
See...

748
00:56:36,288 --> 00:56:38,788
A girl has things to prepare--

749
00:56:38,788 --> 00:56:40,288
It's fine.

750
00:56:40,288 --> 00:56:41,855
I can't wait any longer.

751
00:58:21,222 --> 00:58:23,022
Good morning!

752
00:58:23,022 --> 00:58:25,722
Why? You should have slept more.

753
00:58:25,722 --> 00:58:26,822
You must be tired.

754
00:58:26,822 --> 00:58:28,055
I'm sorry.

755
00:58:28,055 --> 00:58:31,655
What happened? The alarm went off at 5am.

756
00:58:31,655 --> 00:58:34,755
I was looking forward to what you would make for breakfast.

757
00:58:34,755 --> 00:58:38,155
Hyung you can rethink all this.

758
00:58:39,188 --> 00:58:40,755
Ha Ni, you sit down too.

759
00:58:41,655 --> 00:58:42,955
Do you want to wash up before you eat?

760
00:58:42,955 --> 00:58:44,222
Yes.

761
00:58:44,222 --> 00:58:45,088
I'm sorry.

762
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:47,155
Absolutely no need for that!

763
00:58:47,155 --> 00:58:50,655
You're going to the library, right? I'll be quick so lets go together.

764
00:58:50,655 --> 00:58:53,222
Going to study to get into the nursing program?

765
00:58:53,222 --> 00:58:54,355
Yes.

766
00:58:54,355 --> 00:59:00,588
The son will be a doctor and the daughter-in-law a nurse.
That's so great!

767
00:59:00,588 --> 00:59:05,722
Well I can't take the certification until I get into the program.

768
00:59:05,722 --> 00:59:07,722
If I don't then I may not be able to take it at all.

769
00:59:07,722 --> 00:59:08,488
Oh really?!

770
00:59:08,488 --> 00:59:10,422
Just because she takes it doesn't mean she's going to pass.

771
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:11,955
She's better off not being able to take it.

772
00:59:11,955 --> 00:59:14,755
Baek Eun Jo fix that mouth of yours!

773
00:59:14,755 --> 00:59:16,222
She's your sister-in-law now.

774
00:59:17,555 --> 00:59:19,855
Oh that's right! We have to register your marriage!

775
00:59:19,855 --> 00:59:21,122
Well...

776
00:59:21,122 --> 00:59:23,022
What kind of reply is that?

777
00:59:23,022 --> 00:59:26,355
I know you're busy, but there are priorities you know!

778
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:28,888
Hey Ha Ni later go with Seung Jo and--

779
00:59:28,888 --> 00:59:30,122
I'll think about it first.

780
00:59:33,055 --> 00:59:34,722
What?! Think about what?!

781
00:59:34,722 --> 00:59:37,322
About putting her on our family register.

782
00:59:37,322 --> 00:59:38,722
I want to wait and see.

783
00:59:38,722 --> 00:59:41,955
Is that something to say for someone that just came back from their honeymoon?!

784
00:59:41,955 --> 00:59:44,555
That was something that you forced on us, Mother.

785
00:59:44,555 --> 00:59:47,522
Baek Seung Jo does any of this make any sense?!

786
00:59:47,522 --> 00:59:49,822
Thank God Ha Ni's father isn't here!

787
00:59:49,822 --> 00:59:52,555
What is it that you want to think over?

788
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:54,455
Well...

789
00:59:54,455 --> 00:59:58,488
I don't know but something isn't right at all.

790
00:59:58,488 --> 01:00:01,455
It just feels like we're rushing through it all.

791
01:00:01,455 --> 01:00:03,688
You don't want that either right?

792
01:00:03,688 --> 01:00:05,422
Is that so...

793
01:00:05,422 --> 01:00:06,922
Then what do we do?

794
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:11,488
Changing your major to nursing.

795
01:00:11,488 --> 01:00:14,755
Let's register once you pass the test to change majors.

796
01:00:14,755 --> 01:00:16,355
What does that have to do with your marriage registration?!

797
01:00:16,355 --> 01:00:17,755
No way!

798
01:00:17,755 --> 01:00:20,188
What? Are you not confident?

799
01:00:21,422 --> 01:00:22,822
You jumped into it and this is it?

800
01:00:22,822 --> 01:00:28,122
No that's not it. There's a chance I may not be able to take it at all!

801
01:00:28,122 --> 01:00:30,455
I'm sure it'll happen, some day.

802
01:00:52,622 --> 01:01:01,088
Thanks to the amazing PKer team for all their hard work today.
Thank you to all the viewers who waited until the channel went green for GO to watch this episode.

803
01:01:04,822 --> 01:01:05,622
What?

804
01:01:05,622 --> 01:01:08,122
You won't put me on your family register until I pass?!

805
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:09,822
We can just do it!

806
01:01:09,822 --> 01:01:12,155
Family register.

807
01:01:12,155 --> 01:01:13,355
I like you Mr. Bong!

808
01:01:13,355 --> 01:01:14,088
What?!

809
01:01:14,088 --> 01:01:15,688
It was love at first sight!

810
01:01:15,688 --> 01:01:18,355
But Mr. Bong says he likes someone.

811
01:01:18,355 --> 01:01:19,955
Is it true?

812
01:01:19,955 --> 01:01:22,655
You must love it. The old lady gets a scandal and everything.

813
01:01:22,655 --> 01:01:25,488
By chance are you jealous? You're jealous right?!

814
01:01:25,488 --> 01:01:27,688
- I said I'm not!
- Whatever it totally is!

815
01:01:27,688 --> 01:01:30,322
Ever since that day Chris isn't around much.

816
01:01:30,322 --> 01:01:32,688
What the hell Bong Joon Gu? Why are you here?!

817
01:01:32,688 --> 01:01:34,122
Are you crazy?!

818
01:01:34,688 --> 01:01:36,255
I applied to change majors!

819
01:01:36,255 --> 01:01:39,188
If I pass this time then go on a date with me on Christmas.

820
01:01:39,188 --> 01:01:40,755
Hey what are you doing?

821
01:01:40,755 --> 01:01:43,122
- Come here.
- Hyung!

822
01:01:45,222 --> 01:01:47,288
Yeah! Yeah, Eun Jo!

823
01:01:48,688 --> 01:01:51,988
Man, I'm going crazy because I want to go on a date with Oh Ha Ni!

824
01:01:51,988 --> 01:01:53,188
I'm late!
