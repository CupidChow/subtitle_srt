1
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,000
I will call you, Mother .

2
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:05,666
Seung Jo, take care of yourself. Eat your meals, and eat lots of vegetables and fruits.

3
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:09,845
And don't wander during the night. And...

4
00:01:09,845 --> 00:01:11,366
I know, I know.

5
00:01:11,466 --> 00:01:13,258
If you need anything, call me.

6
00:01:13,258 --> 00:01:14,666
I don't need anything.

7
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:17,993
You have to come home once in a while, okay ?

8
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:27,633
I'm going Eun Jo.

9
00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:29,633
Hyung.

10
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:56,633
He left.

11
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,133
He really left like that.

12
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:10,166
I was so happy about living in this house with Seung Jo...

13
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,166
Even if he's cold towards me...even if he's says things I don't like...

14
00:02:17,366 --> 00:02:19,733
It was nice just being with him .

15
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,233
Ha Ni...don't cry.

16
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,500
Let's wait...

17
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,900
He didn't go far away. So he'll come back really soon...

18
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,700
Now I can't see him anywhere but at school.

19
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,133
He'll probably...

20
00:02:59,766 --> 00:03:02,666
Seung Jo will probably forget me.

21
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:12,000
We need two more King Chops.

22
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:17,700
Ha Ni went back to where she was a long time ago, huh ?

23
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:20,466
It's the same as it was in high school .

24
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:23,733
Here.

25
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:25,366
Ha Ni, you came?

26
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:30,666
You're humming. You must be in a good mood, Bong Joon Gu .

27
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,866
Of course.

28
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:36,913
Since I'm working with a stable mind now, Ha Ni will come to me.

29
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:40,433
This is nothing different than me beating Baek Seung Jo.

30
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:45,500
Then, Ha Ni will come to me on her knees.

31
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:48,299
please give me a King Cutlet .

32
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,473
Yes. Eat!

33
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:02,466
You're alright Ha Ni?

34
00:04:02,766 --> 00:04:03,566
I'm sorry.

35
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:04,566
For what?

36
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,200
What happened to Ha Ni?

37
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,566
Isn't she a bit strange?

38
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:15,100
They say Baek Seung Jo left his house.

39
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,666
She's in shock.

40
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,366
Let's practice.

41
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:23,966
Seung Jo isn't coming for practice.

42
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:28,833
I already knew he wouldn't, but I was thinking maybe...

43
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,400
Hey, Oh Ha Ni!

44
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:35,666
You can't even pick up the balls properly?

45
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:37,466
Yes...

46
00:04:37,466 --> 00:04:39,800
Ah really!

47
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,533
Ha Ni!

48
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,500
Do you feel like buying me dinner?

49
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:51,233
I don't.

50
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,566
Really?

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,066
That's a shame. I was going to let you in on some information about Baek Seung Jo.

52
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,000
If you don't want to, it's fine. Let's practice.

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,633
I'll buy it, sunbae! I'll buy it, sunbae!

54
00:05:05,866 --> 00:05:07,466
I'll buy it, I'll buy it!

55
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,066
I know a good place.

56
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:11,833
Yes?

57
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,433
It's not an expensive place, so you don't need to be pressured.

58
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:17,733
Besides that... the information you were talking about...

59
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:19,266
Ah information.

60
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:28,933
As you may already know, Seung Jo doesn't hide anything from me. So if I tell you, it's pretty good information.

61
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:32,000
After practice, I'll take you where Seung Jo is working part time.

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,166
What !?!?

63
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,166
Seung Jo works here?

64
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:53,133
Yeah. He's a waiter here. I introduced him to this place.

65
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:58,400
I actually work here on the weekends too. Let's go in.

66
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:04,100
Baek Seung Jo working at a family restaurant...

67
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,866
I can't believe it.

68
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:10,466
Ah they added this. It wasn't here last week.

69
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:15,100
Ha Ni.
Ha Ni!

70
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,933
Yes?

71
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:18,066
Quit looking around and order.

72
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:18,800
Yes.

73
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The Fresh Date Salad sounds okay.

74
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:31,333
The picture of the Garlic Steak Pie looks okay too.

75
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,966
Have you decided?

76
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,966
Why don't you just roughly decide?

77
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:39,333
Yes, I...

78
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,533
If you have thought about it for 15 minutes, that should be enough.

79
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:42,533
Baek Seung Jo.

80
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:44,600
Will it be the Grilled Soy sauce Salmon set?

81
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Or is it the Fresh Date Salad? Or the Garlic Baked Chicken?

82
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,833
I'll have the Grilled Soy sauce Salmon.

83
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,365
Fresh Date Salad.

84
00:06:57,365 --> 00:06:57,665
Ah, and tea...

85
00:06:57,665 --> 00:06:59,433
What kind of salad dressing would you like?

86
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:05,166
-Pinenut dressing..
-Would you like peach or lemon for your tea?

87
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,100
Lemon.

88
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,633
Shall I serve the tea after your meal?

89
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:08,866
Yes.

90
00:07:08,866 --> 00:07:10,500
Please wait a while.

91
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:18,133
Ha Ni, what do you think? I was right wasn't....

92
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,133
What?
Are you crying now?

93
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:23,500
Punk, being a baby.

94
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,133
It's been so long since I've talked with Seung Jo.

95
00:07:27,133 --> 00:07:31,200
Did you talk with him just now? I heard it as ordering.

96
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:32,333
Excuse me.

97
00:07:32,633 --> 00:07:33,933
Can I get a refill on my cola?

98
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:36,066
Yes.

99
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:37,733
Shall I give you more?

100
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:38,333
Yes.

101
00:07:40,633 --> 00:07:45,600
How can he look so cool in a uniform too?

102
00:07:48,756 --> 00:07:50,604
You have been waiting for long!

103
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:53,823
Grilled Soy sauce Salmon.

104
00:07:56,923 --> 00:07:59,523
Lemon chicken and fresh date salad for you

105
00:07:59,523 --> 00:08:00,690
Really Looks delicious

106
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,223
Enjoy your meal

107
00:08:04,387 --> 00:08:05,923
Seung Jo

108
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:08,706
Hello!

109
00:08:08,706 --> 00:08:09,756
Where do you live now?

110
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:12,167
I'm working now...

111
00:08:12,614 --> 00:08:15,190
Are you angry? Because I'm here?

112
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,723
I knew you'd come sooner or later,

113
00:08:17,723 --> 00:08:21,590
however don't be a tattle-tale about this.

114
00:08:34,823 --> 00:08:36,628
That's it!

115
00:08:36,823 --> 00:08:37,532
What?

116
00:08:37,532 --> 00:08:39,523
That!

117
00:08:40,356 --> 00:08:42,122
If I do part-time here,

118
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,890
I can very very casually...

119
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,223
I can be with Seung Jo

120
00:08:45,223 --> 00:08:48,190
But this is quite the opposite of casual.

121
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,990
Just a second.

122
00:08:50,983 --> 00:08:52,590
Oh? Part time?

123
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,723
Yes. I'll do my best!

124
00:08:54,723 --> 00:08:56,890
I'm sorry. What to do?

125
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,756
Yes?

126
00:08:57,756 --> 00:09:01,923
I just hired someone a minute ago, so the positions are all filled.

127
00:09:01,923 --> 00:09:02,991
Yes?!

128
00:09:02,991 --> 00:09:05,315
Sorry, but maybe next time.

129
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,923
You!

130
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,924
Why are you here?

131
00:09:11,924 --> 00:09:14,923
A part time job. I see you're a second late.

132
00:09:14,923 --> 00:09:18,256
Excuse me, don't you have any other positions?!

133
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:20,790
Sorry but we don't need any more right now.

134
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,323
Well then, please work hard starting today!

135
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,256
Looks like the tables have turned.

136
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:28,790
What is?

137
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:34,590
Ever since Seung Jo left his house, the only place you could meet Seung Jo is at the tennis club, right?

138
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,756
But then again Seung Jo barely ever goes.

139
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:41,823
I was in the same class and work in a part-time job in the same place as Seung Jo.

140
00:09:41,823 --> 00:09:46,856
Goodness why do I keep feeling like I'm taking candy from you?

141
00:09:48,723 --> 00:09:52,956
Well, I have to go to work so see you!

142
00:09:57,956 --> 00:10:00,723
Oh gosh that was good.

143
00:10:00,723 --> 00:10:04,844
Hey Ha Ni thanks to you, I really enjoyed my meal.

144
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,595
Oh right ! Did you get the part time job?

145
00:10:11,923 --> 00:10:15,123
Great, it's all figured out then.

146
00:10:15,123 --> 00:10:18,056
You have to be thankful to me.

147
00:10:18,056 --> 00:10:19,056
It's all thanks to me.

148
00:10:19,056 --> 00:10:20,590
Let's go now.

149
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,956
You're leaving ma'am?

150
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,156
There's still the tea left in your set meal.

151
00:10:27,156 --> 00:10:28,490
Oh!

152
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,723
Can you just save it for me for tomorrow?

153
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:32,456
Excuse me?!

154
00:10:32,456 --> 00:10:34,290
The tea...

155
00:10:35,556 --> 00:10:37,756
Can't I come back tomorrow and drink it?

156
00:10:37,756 --> 00:10:39,890
We cannot do that.

157
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:44,797
And I am not thankful at all if you show up tomorrow as well.

158
00:10:44,797 --> 00:10:47,723
I won't bother you.

159
00:10:47,723 --> 00:10:51,456
In the end, I'm still a customer.

160
00:10:51,456 --> 00:10:52,756
Hey!

161
00:10:53,256 --> 00:10:55,590
Don't you dare tell my family.

162
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,556
Then does that mean I can come?

163
00:11:07,123 --> 00:11:07,823
Busy, huh?

164
00:11:07,823 --> 00:11:11,823
Yeah, probably because there are a lot of customers.

165
00:11:12,656 --> 00:11:14,290
How is living alone?

166
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:18,023
I just can't leave feeling at ease when Hae Ra is always around.

167
00:11:18,023 --> 00:11:19,890
I need to come tomorrow and the day after as well.

168
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,556
Ha Ni, what are you doing? Lets go!

169
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,890
Anyway, I'm happy I could see Seung Jo.

170
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:34,097
I'm back home!

171
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:38,664
Oh! Ha Ni

172
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:41,731
You haven't eaten dinner yet have you? Come here, let's eat together

173
00:11:41,731 --> 00:11:43,697
I already ate out.

174
00:11:43,697 --> 00:11:45,697
Oh my!

175
00:11:45,697 --> 00:11:48,697
Ha Ni it's been a long time since I've seen you smile

176
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:50,664
Did something happen?

177
00:11:50,664 --> 00:11:52,799
Huh?

178
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:55,464
No. Just......

179
00:11:55,464 --> 00:12:02,197
You've been so sad since Seung Jo moved out. I was worried about you.

180
00:12:02,197 --> 00:12:07,131
Mother, Seung Jo is...

181
00:12:07,131 --> 00:12:09,006
Don't you dare tell my family.

182
00:12:09,006 --> 00:12:09,864
What!

183
00:12:09,864 --> 00:12:13,031
Seung Jo is working part time at a family restaurant!

184
00:12:14,097 --> 00:12:18,031
It was supposed to be a secret.

185
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,531
I had dinner there.

186
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:23,997
Oh my, oh my, it must have been so much fun!

187
00:12:23,997 --> 00:12:25,264
I want to see it myself.

188
00:12:25,264 --> 00:12:28,364
Right Eun Jo?! Seung Jo is a waiter!

189
00:12:28,364 --> 00:12:30,964
I want to see him too

190
00:12:30,964 --> 00:12:35,031
Then shall the three of us have dinner there tomorrow?

191
00:12:35,031 --> 00:12:36,236
Huh?

192
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,131
But he said it was a secret...

193
00:12:39,131 --> 00:12:41,297
Oh Ha Ni no need to be shy!

194
00:12:41,297 --> 00:12:45,964
Alright then. How about all of us disguising ourselves?

195
00:12:45,964 --> 00:12:48,331
We'll sit off to the side.

196
00:12:48,331 --> 00:12:49,664
Yeah!

197
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:11,164
Seung Jo, what are you doing all by yourself?

198
00:13:11,164 --> 00:13:16,271
Are you making dinner or are you reading a book?

199
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:20,197
Where in the world are you living right now?

200
00:13:20,197 --> 00:13:23,705
I would like mushrooms and lotus leaves over rice, cabbage salad, and omija tea.

201
00:13:23,705 --> 00:13:26,164
I would like abalone porridge, with grilled green tea mountain roots.

202
00:13:26,164 --> 00:13:28,164
Blueberry sorbet after the meal.

203
00:13:28,164 --> 00:13:30,564
I would like diced hot rice cakes with vegetables.

204
00:13:30,564 --> 00:13:33,564
And please don't add any pepper on my grilled salmon.

205
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:37,264
I would like the grilled rib steak with 6 pieces of lemon chicken, actually 8 pieces.

206
00:13:37,264 --> 00:13:39,131
Instead of the abalone porridge, I would like the chicken breast.

207
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:42,264
He won't know if we all order like this, so let's clear it up.

208
00:13:42,264 --> 00:13:42,970
What did you get?

209
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,997
Allow me to confirm your orders.

210
00:13:44,997 --> 00:13:48,164
Mushroom and lotus leaves over rice,
cabbage salad, and omija tea.

211
00:13:48,164 --> 00:13:51,897
Grilled green tea mountain roots, and the rice cakes with vegetables.

212
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,631
Grilled salmon with no pepper.

213
00:13:54,631 --> 00:13:58,864
Grilled chicken with orange sorbet.

214
00:13:58,864 --> 00:13:59,831
You forgot mine?

215
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:04,731
Yes, the blueberry sorbet after the meal. That's all.

216
00:14:08,071 --> 00:14:11,464
I don't think he even jotted it down.

217
00:14:11,464 --> 00:14:14,697
He's so smart, he must have memorized it all!

218
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:18,931
Hyung, you're so cool!

219
00:14:18,931 --> 00:14:20,865
He's definitely a prodigy.

220
00:14:20,865 --> 00:14:23,797
But he's not very cute.

221
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:27,131
My Seung Jo is cutest when he smiles.

222
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:32,064
Do you think Hyung has recognized us?

223
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:36,997
Hey Ha Ni, there's no way he could recognize us when we're disguised this well!

224
00:14:37,697 --> 00:14:40,297
Excuse me!

225
00:14:50,564 --> 00:14:52,631
Are you ready to order?

226
00:14:52,631 --> 00:14:56,023
Should we eat the lotus leaf steak?

227
00:14:56,023 --> 00:14:59,590
I want half lemon chicken half seasoned chicken.

228
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:03,356
I want to eat something I haven't tried.

229
00:15:03,356 --> 00:15:04,990
Hurry up!

230
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,723
What is today's special?

231
00:15:07,723 --> 00:15:09,156
Fried yam salad.

232
00:15:09,156 --> 00:15:10,623
Oh I had that yesterday ...

233
00:15:10,623 --> 00:15:12,223
Hey Ha Ni!

234
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,856
Idiot, Hyung probably already recognized us.

235
00:15:18,856 --> 00:15:20,956
Is this you in disguise?

236
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,723
I'm sorry.

237
00:15:28,556 --> 00:15:31,556
Oh it's Seung Jo's mother and Eun Jo.

238
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,190
Welcome.

239
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,990
Oh my gosh, why are you here?!

240
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,656
I work here part time with Seung Jo.

241
00:15:38,656 --> 00:15:40,156
What?!

242
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:41,823
What were you doing, Ha Ni?!

243
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:45,890
I'm sorry. Yoon Hae Ra made a move first!

244
00:15:51,223 --> 00:15:55,556
Son, come home once in awhile.

245
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:58,623
And be careful not to fall for Hae Ra, not at all!

246
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:00,523
I get it.

247
00:16:01,213 --> 00:16:05,356
Seung Jo, come on and tell me where you live.

248
00:16:06,123 --> 00:16:08,090
Hurry and leave!

249
00:16:16,422 --> 00:16:19,556
Alright Ha Ni? You cannot lose to Hae Ra.

250
00:16:19,556 --> 00:16:23,623
Don't you care what he says about you being persistent or tired of you.

251
00:16:23,623 --> 00:16:26,756
You have to meet him everyday. Stick to him like glue!

252
00:16:26,756 --> 00:16:28,990
Come here every day, alright?

253
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,623
Yes!

254
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:33,356
There's nothing like a stalker.

255
00:16:33,356 --> 00:16:36,390
My sad Hyung. Poor Seung Jo.

256
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,223
What?!

257
00:16:38,223 --> 00:16:40,023
Really?!

258
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:47,323
Yeah, it looks like Hae Ra has attached herself to Seung Jo.

259
00:16:49,056 --> 00:16:51,956
Hae Ra's pretty darn persistent too.

260
00:16:51,956 --> 00:16:56,090
Now that this has happened, you have no choice but to go every day as well.

261
00:16:56,556 --> 00:16:58,790
Don't you think Seung Jo will dislike it?

262
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:02,156
Oh my gosh! What in the world are you talking about?!

263
00:17:02,156 --> 00:17:08,156
It's Oh Ha Ni to happily go after him whether he runs away or doesn't like it.

264
00:17:08,156 --> 00:17:14,523
Like a cicada that sticks to a tree like glue and cries all summer long!

265
00:17:15,123 --> 00:17:17,690
Okay. That's it!

266
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,490
A cicada stuck to a tree!

267
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:29,456
But the problem is...Do you have the time and money to go visit Seung Jo every single day?

268
00:17:29,456 --> 00:17:31,056
Oh...

269
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,756
Are you renting this place?

270
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,023
Are you studying today again?

271
00:17:39,023 --> 00:17:42,223
I have a paper that I have to turn in by next week.

272
00:17:42,889 --> 00:17:44,589
I'll get the order here.

273
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:45,823
Ah...Okay.

274
00:17:48,689 --> 00:17:49,989
Why did you purposely come?

275
00:17:49,989 --> 00:17:53,689
It seemed like you were going to eat my friend.

276
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:55,456
What would you like?

277
00:17:55,456 --> 00:17:57,256
Give me anything.

278
00:17:57,256 --> 00:17:58,856
Yes, I understand.

279
00:17:58,856 --> 00:18:02,123
Then, just a little bit...

280
00:18:08,946 --> 00:18:11,003
The food you ordered has come out.

281
00:18:14,723 --> 00:18:16,823
Could you please move your books?

282
00:18:20,189 --> 00:18:21,823
What is this?

283
00:18:23,156 --> 00:18:27,323
This is our restaurant's most popular Super Special Set.

284
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:29,189
This big...

285
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,789
Is this a duck?

286
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:33,660
Not a duck... a chicken.

287
00:18:35,702 --> 00:18:37,889
Didn't you tell me to get you anything?

288
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:40,889
Then enjoy your meal. Thank you, thank you!

289
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,223
Customer!

290
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:21,756
Should I give you a fifth cup of coffee?

291
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:31,137
If you drink six cups of black coffee everyday, your stomach will feel terrible.

292
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:34,256
Aigoo, thank you. You even worry about me?

293
00:19:35,023 --> 00:19:35,956
It's okay.

294
00:19:35,956 --> 00:19:38,556
I'm nothing if not healthy.

295
00:19:39,292 --> 00:19:45,689
What guy in this world would like a girl that sits here all day wasting her life away watching him.

296
00:19:46,356 --> 00:19:50,189
If I were a guy, I'd probably get really tired of it.

297
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,623
Well anyways, work hard.

298
00:19:57,469 --> 00:20:00,323
Even if you do that, see if I leave.

299
00:20:11,989 --> 00:20:13,656
Excuse me, customer!

300
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:15,798
Customer!

301
00:20:19,023 --> 00:20:21,023
There isn't much time until we close.

302
00:20:21,023 --> 00:20:23,089
Ah... yes.

303
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,023
It's 123,000 won all together.

304
00:20:26,979 --> 00:20:29,180
What's that expensive?

305
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,856
You had a Super Special Set and 7 cups of coffee.

306
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,856
Super... whatever it is... how much is it?

307
00:20:34,856 --> 00:20:36,756
It is 58000 won.

308
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:40,956
A moment please.

309
00:20:53,189 --> 00:20:54,656
Wait a moment please.

310
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:07,423
Here.

311
00:21:07,423 --> 00:21:08,656
Yes.

312
00:21:08,656 --> 00:21:10,223
Thank you.

313
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:18,356
Excuse me. Until what time does Baek Seung Jo work?

314
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:25,260
Aye, tell me.

315
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,989
I'm not sure. It's probably until 9 pm.

316
00:21:28,989 --> 00:21:30,856
Ah, really?

317
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:31,856
Thank you.

318
00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:34,089
At 9 pm?

319
00:21:35,089 --> 00:21:37,523
Since it's 8:30 now...

320
00:21:39,189 --> 00:21:41,256
He should be getting off soon.

321
00:21:41,256 --> 00:21:42,223
Good.

322
00:21:42,223 --> 00:21:46,556
Today, I will go see where Seung Jo lives.

323
00:21:47,189 --> 00:21:49,156
Of course, just slightly.

324
00:22:16,723 --> 00:22:17,756
Were you waiting?

325
00:22:17,756 --> 00:22:18,894
I just came out.

326
00:22:19,426 --> 00:22:21,489
Really? It is a relief.

327
00:22:21,489 --> 00:22:23,689
Oh, I am tired.

328
00:22:23,689 --> 00:22:25,889
-Let's hurry
-Okay.

329
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:39,163
They're just going together because they live in the same area.

330
00:22:40,364 --> 00:22:42,518
It has to be like that.

331
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:40,882
What is this?

332
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:43,138
Seung Jo...

333
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:44,615
With Hae Ra...

334
00:25:17,105 --> 00:25:18,605
Ha Ni! What happened?

335
00:25:18,605 --> 00:25:20,306
Why are you so late?

336
00:25:20,306 --> 00:25:23,938
I was worried. It's past midnight already.

337
00:25:25,771 --> 00:25:27,271
I am sorry.

338
00:25:27,271 --> 00:25:29,794
Was there a club meeting?

339
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,038
Did something happen?

340
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:35,438
No, everything is alright.

341
00:25:36,998 --> 00:25:40,471
What about a bath? Should I get the water ready for you?

342
00:25:40,471 --> 00:25:43,671
I am just going to sleep today.

343
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:45,805
Good night.

344
00:25:48,271 --> 00:25:50,238
Okay.

345
00:25:50,238 --> 00:25:51,762
Good night.

346
00:25:57,477 --> 00:25:58,729
Strange.

347
00:26:28,495 --> 00:26:31,029
Seung Jo, who used to be right next door...

348
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:34,150
now lives with Hae Ra now.

349
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:37,440
What was all that talk about not hating me?

350
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:40,034
He doesn't hate me...

351
00:26:40,034 --> 00:26:42,562
but he likes He Ra. Is that it?

352
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:53,995
Right now, those two...

353
00:27:13,995 --> 00:27:15,569
I'll be back.

354
00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:17,395
Oh my, Ha Ni!

355
00:27:18,445 --> 00:27:20,438
There are dark circles under your eyes!

356
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,695
And your eyes are swollen.

357
00:27:22,695 --> 00:27:24,995
You look a bit sickly.

358
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:26,829
Really?

359
00:27:26,829 --> 00:27:28,895
I couldn't sleep that well.

360
00:27:28,895 --> 00:27:31,020
Aren't you studying too much?

361
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,929
That could never happen.

362
00:27:33,895 --> 00:27:35,329
Are you okay?

363
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:37,561
What do you think about taking a day off of school today?

364
00:27:37,561 --> 00:27:38,473
I'm okay.

365
00:27:38,473 --> 00:27:43,129
If you feel worse, ask Seung Jo to bring you home.

366
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:48,829
If you show that face to our hyung, he'll probably faint.

367
00:27:48,829 --> 00:27:50,695
He probably will.

368
00:27:50,695 --> 00:27:53,295
I better be careful.

369
00:27:53,295 --> 00:27:54,962
Then, I'll be back.

370
00:27:55,862 --> 00:27:57,262
Hey Ha Ni, what about breakfast?

371
00:27:57,262 --> 00:27:59,162
I don't have an appetite.

372
00:27:59,939 --> 00:28:01,157
Then.

373
00:28:08,429 --> 00:28:12,635
What do you think happened to Ha Ni?

374
00:28:12,635 --> 00:28:18,068
It seems like it's not something normal.

375
00:28:18,068 --> 00:28:20,019
What could it be?

376
00:28:21,723 --> 00:28:23,929
Ah, really!

377
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:25,447
Are you on a diet?

378
00:28:25,447 --> 00:28:28,759
Why aren't you eating these days?!

379
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:30,888
It's because I don't have an appetite...

380
00:28:30,888 --> 00:28:34,153
What's the matter? It's because of Baek Seung Jo, isn't it?

381
00:28:34,153 --> 00:28:36,607
Tell us, we will listen.

382
00:28:37,304 --> 00:28:38,975
I...

383
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,891
think I'll just give up now.

384
00:28:42,891 --> 00:28:44,037
Aigoo!

385
00:28:44,037 --> 00:28:46,220
I've heard that more than a hundred times before.

386
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,102
Right?

387
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:48,867
My ears refuse to hear it.

388
00:28:49,726 --> 00:28:52,722
But I really mean it this time...

389
00:28:56,853 --> 00:28:57,907
What?!

390
00:28:57,907 --> 00:28:59,432
Living together?!

391
00:29:00,315 --> 00:29:02,474
Yoon Hae Ra and Beak Seung Jo?!

392
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,285
Didn't you see it wrong or something?

393
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:07,675
But still,

394
00:29:07,675 --> 00:29:11,414
staying at home together for more than one hour and not going out,

395
00:29:11,414 --> 00:29:14,177
Wouldn't they be in that kind of relationship. . .

396
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:22,141
Seeing that it became like this,

397
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:26,298
I must have liked Seung Jo very much.

398
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:30,129
I could feel it all the way in my bones.

399
00:29:31,597 --> 00:29:35,655
Crushes are really painful...

400
00:29:37,699 --> 00:29:39,015
Ha Ni...

401
00:29:39,015 --> 00:29:41,089
What to do?

402
00:30:05,284 --> 00:30:07,309
Hello everyone.

403
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:29,967
1, 2, 3.

404
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:31,383
Back to the starting position!

405
00:30:31,383 --> 00:30:38,303
1, 2, 3.

406
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:39,742
Back to the starting position!

407
00:30:39,742 --> 00:30:42,831
1, 2, 3.

408
00:30:42,831 --> 00:30:45,013
Hey Oh Ha Ni! Won't you go back to your senses?!

409
00:30:45,013 --> 00:30:45,803
Yes.

410
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:51,910
1, 2, 3.

411
00:31:34,806 --> 00:31:37,135
Hey! Baek Seung Jo!

412
00:31:41,073 --> 00:31:42,174
Who are you?

413
00:31:42,785 --> 00:31:45,099
"Who... Who are you?"

414
00:31:45,748 --> 00:31:49,743
We've been around each other for so long, and you're saying you don't know who we are?

415
00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:51,439
We are Oh Ha Ni's friends.

416
00:31:52,623 --> 00:31:54,155
You have an IQ of 200

417
00:31:54,155 --> 00:31:55,688
but you can't even remember that?

418
00:31:55,688 --> 00:31:58,731
We weren't in the same class,
but we went to the same high school!

419
00:31:58,731 --> 00:32:01,586
I immediately erase useless data out of my head, you know.

420
00:32:02,073 --> 00:32:04,392
Ah, I remember!

421
00:32:04,392 --> 00:32:07,275
The two who have the same level of brains as Oh Ha Ni,

422
00:32:07,275 --> 00:32:08,784
Jung Joo Ri and...

423
00:32:08,784 --> 00:32:10,595
Go Min Ah, right?

424
00:32:12,058 --> 00:32:13,637
What's the matter?

425
00:32:13,637 --> 00:32:16,590
Ah really, what did Ha Ni like about a guy like you...

426
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,932
You're right.

427
00:32:18,861 --> 00:32:19,697
What did you want to say?

428
00:32:19,697 --> 00:32:21,010
Hey!

429
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,159
Don't you think, you were too much?

430
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,434
It's about Ha Ni, do you know?

431
00:32:24,434 --> 00:32:28,196
In the last 10 days she looks like she's been through hell and back!

432
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,682
As her friend,

433
00:32:29,682 --> 00:32:31,531
I can't just sit and watch her like this!

434
00:32:31,531 --> 00:32:32,947
So what?

435
00:32:32,947 --> 00:32:34,233
What is it you want to say?

436
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:37,064
Living together!

437
00:32:37,064 --> 00:32:38,991
Living together?

438
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:43,163
What? You want to stand here and deny it now?

439
00:32:43,163 --> 00:32:46,771
That you are living together with Yoon Hae Ra!

440
00:32:46,771 --> 00:32:51,290
Ha Ni said, she followed you two
and saw everything with her own eyes!

441
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:53,094
Ha Ni, the poor thing,

442
00:32:53,094 --> 00:32:56,256
Waited for more than one hour on the street!

443
00:32:56,256 --> 00:32:57,685
Although you know about Ha Ni's feelings,

444
00:32:57,685 --> 00:32:59,217
Did you have to leave home like this,

445
00:32:59,217 --> 00:33:01,446
and even live with another woman?

446
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,258
At least clear everything up first!

447
00:33:03,258 --> 00:33:05,099
You're such a coward.

448
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:06,950
Don't fool around behind her back!

449
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,947
Be a man and tell her the truth!

450
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:12,337
Fine. All I have to do is tell her the truth?

451
00:33:13,428 --> 00:33:17,631
If you're too honest then it'll be bad for Ha Ni so...

452
00:33:17,631 --> 00:33:22,275
She's a lot more sensitive than what she looks to be...

453
00:33:23,947 --> 00:33:27,476
So what we're saying is to stop tormenting Ha Ni!

454
00:33:27,476 --> 00:33:31,168
We're not telling you to stop liking Yoon Hae Ra.

455
00:33:31,168 --> 00:33:32,817
You understand, right?

456
00:33:32,817 --> 00:33:36,718
Tell her there's no hope and to give up.

457
00:33:36,718 --> 00:33:38,434
Oh Ha Ni...

458
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:40,649
has been in a one-sided love with you for 4 years.

459
00:33:40,649 --> 00:33:43,660
That's what we wanted to say.

460
00:33:45,588 --> 00:33:48,297
We'll get going now.

461
00:33:48,297 --> 00:33:49,256
Let's go.

462
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,424
Here. You were hungry right?

463
00:34:01,424 --> 00:34:03,351
Wow!

464
00:34:04,187 --> 00:34:05,580
This is abalone.

465
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,198
This is mountain root.

466
00:34:07,198 --> 00:34:08,909
This is duck.

467
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:12,592
Here Ha Ni eat up, it's a treat from Joon Gu and us.

468
00:34:13,057 --> 00:34:15,156
You have to take care of your body.

469
00:34:15,156 --> 00:34:17,863
And find a new love.

470
00:34:17,863 --> 00:34:19,217
That's right, Ha Ni.

471
00:34:19,217 --> 00:34:21,277
Hey, that's not important.

472
00:34:21,277 --> 00:34:23,181
Is he the only man in this world?

473
00:34:23,181 --> 00:34:26,176
Look around you, there are so many gorgeous man out there...

474
00:34:27,825 --> 00:34:29,729
You're right...

475
00:34:31,772 --> 00:34:34,466
But I have no appetite...

476
00:34:34,466 --> 00:34:36,555
You guys eat up.

477
00:34:36,555 --> 00:34:37,670
Hey, Ha Ni...

478
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,435
You taking it this hard...

479
00:34:39,435 --> 00:34:41,471
Is absolutely killing me.

480
00:34:42,191 --> 00:34:43,754
You should eat a little.

481
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:55,231
I haven't seen Seung Jo in two weeks already.

482
00:34:55,231 --> 00:34:56,687
Yeah...

483
00:34:56,687 --> 00:34:58,730
Without me trying...

484
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:03,165
There was no way for us to meet like this.

485
00:35:04,861 --> 00:35:08,011
What are you doing here?

486
00:35:08,011 --> 00:35:10,039
Are you waiting for someone?

487
00:35:12,268 --> 00:35:14,241
Long time no see...

488
00:35:16,633 --> 00:35:19,296
I haven't seen you around lately.

489
00:35:19,296 --> 00:35:22,392
Yeah that's right...

490
00:35:22,392 --> 00:35:24,396
Then I'm going to go first.

491
00:35:24,396 --> 00:35:27,454
Show some compassion.

492
00:35:27,454 --> 00:35:29,822
Can't you sit with me while I wait for someone?

493
00:35:29,822 --> 00:35:34,048
Well...I guess.

494
00:35:36,045 --> 00:35:40,085
Well... how is it? The new house?

495
00:35:40,085 --> 00:35:41,502
Oh...

496
00:35:41,502 --> 00:35:44,683
It's good. The rooms are spacious.

497
00:35:45,463 --> 00:35:47,323
Yeah...

498
00:35:48,175 --> 00:35:51,045
What about meals?

499
00:35:51,045 --> 00:35:52,787
Well,

500
00:35:52,787 --> 00:35:56,084
Sometimes I eat at my part-time job.

501
00:35:56,084 --> 00:35:58,452
Sometimes someone cooks for me.

502
00:35:58,452 --> 00:36:00,867
C-cooks for him?

503
00:36:02,137 --> 00:36:04,327
When you're suddenly living on your own,

504
00:36:04,327 --> 00:36:05,674
it must be quite lonely.

505
00:36:05,674 --> 00:36:07,438
Well, it isn't even like that.

506
00:36:07,438 --> 00:36:09,064
For the most part,

507
00:36:09,064 --> 00:36:12,315
I'm with Yoon Hae Ra quite often.

508
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:18,259
Ah... yeah...

509
00:36:19,513 --> 00:36:21,788
Teacher!

510
00:36:23,312 --> 00:36:25,857
I'm here!

511
00:36:25,857 --> 00:36:27,215
You're good about being on time.

512
00:36:27,215 --> 00:36:29,915
Coming to Parang University, which is my target...

513
00:36:29,915 --> 00:36:32,841
I'm really starting to think that I need to study really hard.

514
00:36:33,352 --> 00:36:34,543
Omo!

515
00:36:34,543 --> 00:36:36,161
This unnie...

516
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:38,089
are you maybe Oh Ha Ni unnie?

517
00:36:38,089 --> 00:36:39,552
Ah...

518
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,920
- How do you know me?
- I knew it!

519
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,196
She's exactly the way teacher Hae Ra described.

520
00:36:44,492 --> 00:36:48,236
I can recognize her instantly. I heard a lot about you.

521
00:36:48,236 --> 00:36:49,419
Ah yes...

522
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:51,770
Huh?! What did you hear about me?

523
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:58,289
I heard that you were the bottom of the school, but with the help of teacher Baek Seung Jo that you got into the top 50!

524
00:36:58,936 --> 00:37:01,447
I heard that's still a legend!

525
00:37:01,447 --> 00:37:03,736
Ah. Well, yes...

526
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,436
Teacher!

527
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:10,505
Did you wait long?

528
00:37:10,505 --> 00:37:12,436
No, I just came.

529
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:18,403
I'm getting English tutoring from Hae Ra teacher and math tutoring from Seung Jo teacher,

530
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:21,440
because I'm going to take the entrance exam for this school.

531
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,703
Then your teachers...

532
00:37:23,703 --> 00:37:28,436
They come over at least 3 times a week. My mom loves them.

533
00:37:28,436 --> 00:37:30,570
She even cooks them meals all the time.

534
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:37,470
But, it seems like Hae Ra teacher and Ha Ni unnie are not that close.

535
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,828
Then....

536
00:37:39,828 --> 00:37:45,936
the place you went in with Hae Ra... You weren't living together, right?

537
00:37:45,936 --> 00:37:47,303
Live together?!

538
00:37:47,736 --> 00:37:50,336
Making conclusions on your own basis...

539
00:37:50,336 --> 00:37:53,903
It's a good part-time job because it takes care of dinner.

540
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,470
Let's go now.

541
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,703
Then, good-bye.

542
00:38:38,636 --> 00:38:41,603
You were making chocolate??

543
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:45,736
You give chocolate to special people...

544
00:38:47,036 --> 00:38:48,670
You... perhaps...

545
00:38:49,836 --> 00:38:52,478
Oh my goodness!

546
00:38:52,478 --> 00:38:55,303
Do you know how long I've been waiting for this moment?

547
00:38:55,303 --> 00:38:56,570
It took too long, right?

548
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:59,436
It's seems like you came back to your own self now.

549
00:38:59,736 --> 00:39:04,049
I was so worried because you kept looking so lifeless these last few days.

550
00:39:05,703 --> 00:39:07,470
This time you really need to make things work.

551
00:39:08,103 --> 00:39:08,739
Yes.

552
00:39:08,739 --> 00:39:09,336
Fighting!

553
00:39:09,336 --> 00:39:10,370
Fighting!

554
00:39:23,703 --> 00:39:25,803
I just can't get it to taste right.

555
00:39:28,436 --> 00:39:31,070
Although the taste is not that important ...

556
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,036
What's wrong...

557
00:39:38,848 --> 00:39:41,403
Is it because I haven't been eating well for the past few days?

558
00:40:07,523 --> 00:40:08,690
Did you make it?

559
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:11,662
It looks beautiful.

560
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,390
It must be delicious.

561
00:40:24,156 --> 00:40:25,617
Should I put it on your finger?

562
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,256
Seung Jo...

563
00:40:48,793 --> 00:40:51,323
It's even raining on a day like this

564
00:40:51,556 --> 00:40:53,656
and I didn't bring my umbrella.

565
00:41:18,156 --> 00:41:20,090
Ahjusshi what's wrong?

566
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:23,321
What to do? The car seems to be broken.

567
00:41:23,321 --> 00:41:24,090
What?

568
00:41:47,586 --> 00:41:49,556
Oh, Ha Ni came.

569
00:41:49,556 --> 00:41:53,356
Seung Jo... I came.

570
00:41:53,856 --> 00:41:56,290
On a day when it's raining this hard!

571
00:41:57,113 --> 00:41:59,855
You're really an amazing person.

572
00:42:07,056 --> 00:42:09,856
There's no use in waiting until Seung Jo has finished.

573
00:42:10,456 --> 00:42:14,523
It seems things just get worse for you. Today we tutor Ji Yeon.

574
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:18,790
Ah, it's coffee, right? A lot of it?

575
00:42:34,456 --> 00:42:36,656
When will I be able to give this to him?

576
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:41,423
Here is a little...
And anyhow, Hae Ra is here too.

577
00:43:12,803 --> 00:43:14,456
What's with that face?

578
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:16,154
What's wrong with my face?

579
00:43:16,154 --> 00:43:17,323
You don't look good.

580
00:43:18,824 --> 00:43:20,424
You should get back home immediately.

581
00:43:20,424 --> 00:43:21,856
I'm fine.

582
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:40,370
Customer?

583
00:43:41,056 --> 00:43:42,656
Ha Ni?
Ha Ni?

584
00:43:42,656 --> 00:43:43,556
Oh Ha Ni?

585
00:43:43,756 --> 00:43:44,723
Ha Ni?

586
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:46,593
Oh Ha Ni?!

587
00:43:47,956 --> 00:43:48,656
Hey!

588
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:58,856
Are you alright?

589
00:44:02,356 --> 00:44:03,923
I'm sorry.

590
00:44:04,356 --> 00:44:05,356
Causing trouble.

591
00:44:05,356 --> 00:44:07,756
Will you be okay without calling an ambulance?

592
00:44:07,756 --> 00:44:10,589
Seung Jo Shi already gave you first aid.

593
00:44:11,823 --> 00:44:14,990
That's okay. I'm better now.

594
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:17,190
Baek Seung Jo shi, is this a person you know?

595
00:44:18,923 --> 00:44:19,323
Yes.

596
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,323
Is it? Then both of you should get back home.

597
00:44:22,323 --> 00:44:24,423
You should give this young lady a ride home.

598
00:44:24,623 --> 00:44:27,423
Ah, no. I'm really fine.

599
00:44:27,423 --> 00:44:30,534
How can you leave by yourself with this situation?

600
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:32,390
Do as I say Seung Jo shi.

601
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:33,890
Yes. I got it.

602
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:37,790
It seems that you'll leave alone.

603
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:40,090
I understand. There is nothing I can do about it.

604
00:44:40,623 --> 00:44:44,790
Getting bumped around by little Miss Trouble everyday, it must be painful.

605
00:44:47,723 --> 00:44:49,223
Oh Ha Ni!

606
00:44:50,323 --> 00:44:51,923
You are amazing.

607
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:54,390
Anyway take care of yourself.

608
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:56,290
I'm going.
I'm going.

609
00:45:13,956 --> 00:45:16,056
There aren't many cars around here.

610
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:19,323
I think it would be hard to find a cab here.

611
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:27,390
Seung Jo, you're getting wet. Come closer.

612
00:45:28,756 --> 00:45:31,856
Don't go whining about being sick after getting wet so you can just get closer.

613
00:45:35,856 --> 00:45:37,090
Seung Jo...

614
00:45:38,156 --> 00:45:41,923
I'll just walk over to the station so you just go in.

615
00:45:41,923 --> 00:45:43,956
It's a 30 minute walk to the station.

616
00:45:44,456 --> 00:45:48,456
And with rain this harsh...

617
00:45:48,456 --> 00:45:51,123
The trains might come to a halt like last time.

618
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:56,590
My apartment is 10 min away from here... You wanna come?

619
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:02,323
In my room, you can call mother and

620
00:46:02,656 --> 00:46:04,356
tell her to come here by car.

621
00:46:55,956 --> 00:46:58,956
Wow! It looks better than I expected.

622
00:47:00,056 --> 00:47:03,056
What you even have a full kitchen?!

623
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:07,956
Here is...

624
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:12,123
The bathroom.

625
00:47:35,456 --> 00:47:39,323
Hae Ra... came here too?

626
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:40,395
Here?

627
00:47:44,423 --> 00:47:46,290
You're the first to come over.

628
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:53,156
How are you doing?

629
00:47:53,956 --> 00:47:55,590
Now I'm okay.

630
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:59,623
That's what you get for drinking that much coffee on an empty stomach!

631
00:48:00,523 --> 00:48:02,490
It would be amazing if you didn't get a stomachache.

632
00:48:03,223 --> 00:48:05,323
I said I'm alright now.

633
00:48:08,123 --> 00:48:09,223
Here, a towel.

634
00:48:16,256 --> 00:48:17,756
Baek Seung Jo's smell.

635
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:20,956
What smell? it's brand new.

636
00:48:27,223 --> 00:48:28,222
Hello?

637
00:48:28,723 --> 00:48:30,123
It's me, Seung Jo.

638
00:48:31,389 --> 00:48:32,789
I'm at my home

639
00:48:33,556 --> 00:48:34,423
Pardon?

640
00:48:37,256 --> 00:48:38,556
I met her.

641
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:41,223
She came by my part time job.

642
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:45,323
She fainted after she drank a cup of coffee.

643
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:51,490
No, she seems fine right now.

644
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:57,456
The time for us being alone like this, will be over once Mother comes to pick me up.

645
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:00,656
Before that, I have to get a look at Seung Jo's bedroom.

646
00:49:00,656 --> 00:49:01,856
We are together now.

647
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:04,856
Omo! Really?!
We couldn't find a cab,

648
00:49:04,856 --> 00:49:07,956
therefore please come here to pick her up.

649
00:49:09,456 --> 00:49:10,190
Pardon?

650
00:49:11,223 --> 00:49:12,056
Pardon?!

651
00:49:12,723 --> 00:49:14,490
Are you joking now?

652
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:16,656
Mom?

653
00:49:16,756 --> 00:49:17,656
Mom?!

654
00:49:18,123 --> 00:49:19,156
Hello...?

655
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,390
Ah what?! Hanging up like that.

656
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:23,423
Why?

657
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:24,990
What did she say?

658
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:28,656
She doesn't want to come because it's raining too much.

659
00:49:28,656 --> 00:49:29,356
Huh?

660
00:49:29,356 --> 00:49:33,556
She will pick us up tomorrow, so we have to stay here for the night.

661
00:49:33,656 --> 00:49:34,790
That's what she said.

662
00:49:51,323 --> 00:49:57,056
He's taking a shower, and from now on it will only be the 2 of us all night long.

663
00:49:57,356 --> 00:49:58,256
Ah...

664
00:49:58,923 --> 00:50:02,123
A situation that only arises in romance novels!

665
00:50:04,056 --> 00:50:05,790
What should I do?

666
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:12,090
This happened before at Seung Jo's parents' house, but the situation is different now.

667
00:50:15,156 --> 00:50:18,556
In this house, there is only the two of us!

668
00:50:34,686 --> 00:50:37,353
There's also only one bed!

669
00:50:37,353 --> 00:50:38,520
Hey!

670
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,013
Yes?

671
00:50:39,013 --> 00:50:40,553
Are you going to take a shower?

672
00:50:41,053 --> 00:50:42,686
Sh-shower?

673
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:48,087
Ah, yeah, then... I'll take a shower.

674
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:49,853
Are you nervous?

675
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,523
Nervous? No way.

676
00:50:52,523 --> 00:50:53,620
Not at all.

677
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:57,558
Put that on.

678
00:50:57,558 --> 00:50:59,820
There's only my clothes.

679
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,420
If you don't like it then forget it.

680
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:05,839
Thank you.

681
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,822
I like this feeling of having my heart flutter like this.

682
00:51:17,822 --> 00:51:23,053
This spot where Seung Jo was just at...Now I'm here.

683
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:27,486
Is Seung Jo waiting for me outside?

684
00:51:29,053 --> 00:51:36,653
Tonight seems like a night that people only experience once in their lifetime.

685
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,520
Joong Gu, answer the phone!

686
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,253
Ah, yes. I understand.

687
00:51:58,331 --> 00:52:00,186
Hello, this is So Pal Bok Noodles.

688
00:52:00,186 --> 00:52:02,453
I'm calling from Seung Jo's house.

689
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,820
I'd like to speak to Ha Ni's father.

690
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,897
Ah, you are Baek Seung Jo's mother?

691
00:52:06,897 --> 00:52:11,577
Oh my, then who would you be?

692
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:12,952
Joong Goo-goon?

693
00:52:12,952 --> 00:52:14,586
Oh yes it's Bong Joon Gu.

694
00:52:14,586 --> 00:52:18,253
But our chef is extremely busy right now.

695
00:52:18,787 --> 00:52:25,425
Then listen carefully Joon Gu, and please make sure to tell Ha Ni's father.

696
00:52:25,425 --> 00:52:27,186
Yes I got it. Please tell me.

697
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:30,786
Ha Ni will be spending the night away from home tonight.

698
00:52:30,786 --> 00:52:32,720
That he need not to worry.

699
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,820
She's going to sleep over at Seung Jo's house.

700
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,720
What?

701
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:42,320
I just thought it was better for her to stay there than to come home during these windy rains.

702
00:52:42,786 --> 00:52:43,886
What...

703
00:52:43,886 --> 00:52:46,653
What...What did you say?

704
00:52:46,653 --> 00:52:48,453
Are you serious lady?!

705
00:52:48,453 --> 00:52:54,264
H-ha Ni is going to sleep over at Seung Jo's home?!

706
00:52:54,264 --> 00:52:56,020
Where is Baek Seung Jo now?

707
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:59,986
Omo, what to do... I don't know that.

708
00:52:59,986 --> 00:53:03,338
But although I know it, I'm not gonna tell you~

709
00:53:03,338 --> 00:53:04,320
What?!

710
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,513
Well then, I'm gonna hang up~

711
00:53:06,513 --> 00:53:07,853
Excuse me, hello--

712
00:53:07,853 --> 00:53:09,653
Ahjumma, don't hang up! Don't hang up!

713
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:11,365
What's the matter?

714
00:53:11,365 --> 00:53:14,920
Ch-chef! Do you know where that Baek Seung Jo lives?

715
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,520
How in the world would I know where Seung Jo lives!?

716
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:22,220
I only know that he's working at that family restaurant.

717
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:24,820
What's the name of the family restaurant?

718
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:29,253
I think they're selling Dak (Korean for "chicken") there, ah no, it was chicken, or something like that.

719
00:53:29,253 --> 00:53:31,620
Is it Dak or Chicken?

720
00:53:32,798 --> 00:53:34,486
I'm leaving first!

721
00:53:34,486 --> 00:53:35,738
Hey!

722
00:53:36,286 --> 00:53:37,662
Hey!

723
00:53:37,662 --> 00:53:38,553
Baek Seung Jo!

724
00:53:38,553 --> 00:53:40,186
Hey you! Joon Gu!

725
00:53:50,267 --> 00:53:51,903
I...

726
00:53:52,203 --> 00:53:54,186
I enjoyed the shower.

727
00:53:54,686 --> 00:53:56,190
Thank you.

728
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:57,383
Yeah.

729
00:53:59,353 --> 00:54:00,473
So...

730
00:54:00,473 --> 00:54:03,172
What are we gonna do from now on?

731
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,086
Who are you?

732
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:20,686
Hello?

733
00:54:21,986 --> 00:54:23,745
Hello?

734
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:28,353
I wanted... to ask something...

735
00:54:28,353 --> 00:54:30,378
At this restaurant...

736
00:54:30,886 --> 00:54:33,186
is there a guy called Seung Jo...

737
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,953
Seung Jo? Baek Seung Jo?

738
00:54:36,819 --> 00:54:37,785
I must find...

739
00:54:38,685 --> 00:54:40,742
I must find...

740
00:54:40,742 --> 00:54:41,686
Hello?

741
00:54:41,686 --> 00:54:43,320
Sir? Hello?

742
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,253
Excuse me!

743
00:55:00,986 --> 00:55:03,120
I'm going to go to sleep.

744
00:55:06,118 --> 00:55:07,553
Huh?

745
00:55:08,753 --> 00:55:12,620
Yeah, it's already 12 o'clock...

746
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:16,586
Well then I will sleep on the floor,

747
00:55:16,586 --> 00:55:19,820
so you just sleep in the bed.

748
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,520
Of course.

749
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:23,920
What?

750
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,053
There's only one blanket.

751
00:55:27,053 --> 00:55:29,353
if you're cold, go to the closet

752
00:55:29,353 --> 00:55:32,986
Pull out a coat of mine and go to sleep if you must.

753
00:55:32,986 --> 00:55:37,786
Hey, usually in situations like this, you should say to the girl

754
00:55:37,786 --> 00:55:43,153
"Hey, what are you saying, I'll sleep on the floor,
so you can sleep in the bed."

755
00:55:43,153 --> 00:55:44,720
Isn't that common sense?

756
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,353
I don't want to say something like that to you.

757
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:50,620
What did you say to a sick person?!

758
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,386
You're not even a human!

759
00:55:52,386 --> 00:55:54,086
You crazy cold human!

760
00:55:54,086 --> 00:55:55,378
What?

761
00:56:14,053 --> 00:56:16,120
Hey...

762
00:56:19,593 --> 00:56:21,520
Hey...

763
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,753
What is it?

764
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:27,120
I hate the dark...

765
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,734
Can't we turn the lights on?

766
00:56:28,734 --> 00:56:31,520
I can't sleep if it's not dark.

767
00:56:32,621 --> 00:56:35,053
A ghost could come out...

768
00:56:39,353 --> 00:56:41,005
Hey...

769
00:56:42,234 --> 00:56:43,886
What now?

770
00:56:44,695 --> 00:56:46,863
Aren't you cold?

771
00:56:46,863 --> 00:56:48,528
Of course I'm cold.

772
00:56:48,528 --> 00:56:50,120
Even my back is cold.

773
00:56:51,086 --> 00:56:53,520
I'll just sleep on the floor.

774
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,320
It's fine, so just go to sleep!

775
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,753
But still...

776
00:56:59,086 --> 00:57:00,386
But it's cold...

777
00:57:00,386 --> 00:57:02,986
Okay! I can sleep here too, right?

778
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:05,851
Wait! Then... I'll sleep on the floor...

779
00:57:05,851 --> 00:57:07,320
It's fine!

780
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,753
If I do this, then you'll quiet down too!

781
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,920
Sleep!

782
00:57:32,886 --> 00:57:34,782
Are you nervous?

783
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:39,542
Why do you keep asking that! Nervous? Whatever.

784
00:57:39,542 --> 00:57:41,522
I'm not.

785
00:57:41,522 --> 00:57:44,249
Then what's that sound of you swallowing your spit?

786
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,674
Huh?

787
00:57:45,674 --> 00:57:48,475
You're spending a night with me.

788
00:57:49,107 --> 00:57:51,520
You never know if something could happen.

789
00:57:52,305 --> 00:57:54,220
Like a kiss?

790
00:57:55,186 --> 00:57:56,920
Or...

791
00:57:57,413 --> 00:57:59,820
Something beyond that could happen.

792
00:58:11,491 --> 00:58:13,020
You may look forward to it...

793
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,986
Sorry.

794
00:58:14,986 --> 00:58:17,361
But I'm not going to do anything.

795
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,553
Sleep well.

796
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:24,001
Good night.

797
00:58:31,086 --> 00:58:34,686
It's like it all died down,

798
00:58:34,686 --> 00:58:37,486
but I think I feel relieved.

799
00:58:37,486 --> 00:58:41,953
But still, to not do anything while on a bed with a girl,

800
00:58:41,953 --> 00:58:46,320
I wonder if Seung Jo feels numb towards women or something.

801
00:58:47,686 --> 00:58:52,920
Maybe it's just because he doesn't see me as an attractive girl.

802
00:58:55,019 --> 00:58:57,720
That's it!

803
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,685
There's no way a girl like me...

804
00:58:59,685 --> 00:59:01,819
Are you blaming yourself?

805
00:59:02,628 --> 00:59:04,938
Blaming myself?

806
00:59:04,938 --> 00:59:06,328
No...

807
00:59:06,328 --> 00:59:07,728
I...

808
00:59:07,728 --> 00:59:11,961
Don't want to become what my mother thinks of me as.

809
00:59:14,361 --> 00:59:17,361
Say something did happen between us tonight.

810
00:59:18,228 --> 00:59:20,599
We'll totally be caught up in it.

811
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:24,728
Then we'll forever be controlled by my mother.

812
00:59:26,928 --> 00:59:28,661
That's all.

813
00:59:28,995 --> 00:59:30,728
So...

814
00:59:31,695 --> 00:59:34,630
So don't expect anything and just go to sleep.

815
00:59:39,995 --> 00:59:44,774
That's right, he said he didn't dislike me.

816
00:59:45,228 --> 00:59:48,877
For some reason I feel warm and happy.

817
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:52,528
Being able to sleep next to Seung Jo...

818
00:59:54,128 --> 00:59:57,328
It's so precious I can't fall asleep.

819
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:46,895
Baek Seung Jo!

820
01:01:46,895 --> 01:01:48,428
Yoon Hae Ra!

821
01:01:48,428 --> 01:01:49,850
One two!

822
01:01:52,961 --> 01:01:54,595
It's fun.

823
01:01:55,228 --> 01:01:56,480
Go on.

824
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:58,261
Alright.

825
01:01:58,261 --> 01:02:00,325
One more match.
