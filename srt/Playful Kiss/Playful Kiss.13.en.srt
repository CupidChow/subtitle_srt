1
00:00:58,173 --> 00:01:00,331
You arrived, Seung Jo-goon.

2
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,890
Hi, Baek Seung Jo.

3
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,644
Sit down.

4
00:01:14,123 --> 00:01:19,488
You don't have to be that surprised. I was surprised too when I heard you were my prospective marriage partner.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,557
"I would never have a marriage meeting"

6
00:01:22,557 --> 00:01:29,495
I was positive there would be no way I would marry a man my grandpa picked out for me.

7
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:31,657
Because of you, now I look funny.

8
00:01:31,657 --> 00:01:35,906
I, too, had no idea that Hae Ra and you knew each other.

9
00:01:35,906 --> 00:01:39,860
Yes, we go to the same school and are the same year. We're friends.

10
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:45,087
I did think it was weird that I got her to come out so easily.

11
00:01:45,087 --> 00:01:49,323
But it seems there is a destiny between you and Hae Ra.

12
00:01:49,908 --> 00:01:51,523
Then, let's have something to eat first.

13
00:01:51,523 --> 00:01:52,506
Ah, yes.

14
00:01:52,506 --> 00:01:54,621
Hae Ra, choose something delicious to eat.

15
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:56,057
Yes, Grandfather.

16
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,879
Seung Jo you also choose what you like.

17
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:58,901
Yes.

18
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:01,657
Oh, Seung Jo doesn't really like oily food.

19
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,904
What do you think about this set meal? It doesn't seem to be too much food either.

20
00:02:05,904 --> 00:02:06,823
That sounds good.

21
00:02:06,823 --> 00:02:12,423
Aigoo, you already get along well just like a married couple.

22
00:02:13,557 --> 00:02:18,923
I'm sorry if I have made you uncomfortable. I will be leaving early.

23
00:02:18,923 --> 00:02:21,523
What's the matter? Do you have something else to do?

24
00:02:21,523 --> 00:02:25,190
Do you think this grandfather doesn't have any sense?

25
00:02:28,074 --> 00:02:29,590
Baek Seung Jo!

26
00:02:31,257 --> 00:02:33,890
Hey, Seung Jo!
Mother.

27
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,890
Ha Ni, where is Seung Jo?

28
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:37,457
He went out.

29
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:38,223
He went out?

30
00:02:38,223 --> 00:02:43,857
He said he had an appointment, dressed well, and went out.

31
00:02:44,057 --> 00:02:45,423
But why?

32
00:03:00,823 --> 00:03:02,190
You were surprised right?

33
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:04,290
Yeah...

34
00:03:04,723 --> 00:03:05,657
A bit.

35
00:03:06,457 --> 00:03:10,523
You seem to have delighted my grandpa.

36
00:03:11,623 --> 00:03:16,123
That was the first time he brought a picture and told me to take a look at a guy.

37
00:03:17,257 --> 00:03:20,223
Of course at first, I didn't even look.

38
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,723
But then he said that he was the heir of a successful game company.

39
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,023
And when I saw the picture it was really you!

40
00:03:26,023 --> 00:03:29,857
But how can I not go when it's you? And it would be so much fun?!

41
00:03:32,757 --> 00:03:34,723
I wanted to see your expression.

42
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,123
How was it?

43
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:43,823
Your expression was... bitter

44
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:50,257
So, what do we do next?

45
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,714
If we want to be funded by your grandfather...

46
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,623
Does that mean I need to get married?

47
00:03:56,723 --> 00:03:57,623
With you?

48
00:03:59,336 --> 00:04:01,123
Well, that's possible too.

49
00:04:02,557 --> 00:04:05,657
But you wouldn't like that, right?

50
00:04:47,157 --> 00:04:50,623
In the condition we're in now, a game can't be released.

51
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,657
We're even behind on employees' salaries.

52
00:04:54,723 --> 00:04:56,023
That's why I came out today.

53
00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:01,790
But, since you're the other person, I'm actually relieved.

54
00:05:02,623 --> 00:05:06,057
But don't you dislike it? Since it's for that reason?

55
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:12,190
I didn't know these kind of words can come out of Baek Seung Jo's mouth.

56
00:05:13,057 --> 00:05:14,090
Really?

57
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:19,590
Living is pretty extreme. It's no joke.

58
00:05:19,757 --> 00:05:23,290
But, I came out because it was you.

59
00:05:25,023 --> 00:05:30,657
You came and you were relieved that it was me, but I

60
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,557
came because it was you,

61
00:05:33,923 --> 00:05:36,190
even though I knew why you came.

62
00:05:37,823 --> 00:05:45,023
Hey, since I knew the real reason, my pride was hurt so I did actually say that I didn't want to come.

63
00:05:45,023 --> 00:05:49,957
But when this morning came around, I wanted to come out looking pretty.

64
00:05:52,423 --> 00:05:55,723
Doesn't it seem like I really like you?

65
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:08,190
But don't worry. Even though the situation seems real, I don't want to go that far.

66
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:15,057
Let's just take a chance... on each other.

67
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,400
Let's try it out...

68
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,423
Okay, it's good.

69
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:26,143
Really?

70
00:06:26,825 --> 00:06:28,047
Really?!

71
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:37,242
It's alright. Be strong.

72
00:06:37,771 --> 00:06:44,008
Right now those people are probably just seeing his fright.
But once they see his true colors,
they'll probably say no first.

73
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:50,069
He's not humane, he's no fun, and he's not good to the ladies.

74
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,869
How is Seung Jo's dad doing lately?

75
00:06:53,636 --> 00:06:55,603
He is getting better.

76
00:07:00,108 --> 00:07:01,203
I'm back.

77
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:05,336
Let's talk for a bit Baek Seung Jo.

78
00:07:06,408 --> 00:07:08,269
Aren't you going to Father at the hospital?

79
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,169
Just go. We'll talk next time.

80
00:07:11,145 --> 00:07:13,036
Aigoo, look at that brat.

81
00:07:13,136 --> 00:07:16,603
Who would like someone that cold?

82
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:20,569
You're probably the only person that can handle that temper of his.

83
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:22,869
Be strong, okay?

84
00:07:35,603 --> 00:07:37,136
You came back early.

85
00:07:38,936 --> 00:07:39,704
Yeah...

86
00:07:40,369 --> 00:07:41,703
I can't?

87
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,936
Excuse me...

88
00:07:46,803 --> 00:07:49,103
You had a marriage meeting?

89
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:50,469
Yeah.

90
00:07:51,436 --> 00:07:52,669
How was it?

91
00:07:55,036 --> 00:07:57,136
Did you hear who it was with?

92
00:07:58,536 --> 00:07:59,303
Hae Ra.

93
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,569
I heard it was the granddaughter of Windy Media.

94
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:04,369
Yeah.

95
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:07,536
Pretty perfect, isn't it?

96
00:08:12,836 --> 00:08:18,303
Will you...
get married?

97
00:08:18,403 --> 00:08:19,603
Get married?

98
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,436
Probably.

99
00:08:24,436 --> 00:08:29,003
Marriage naturally follows a marriage meeting.

100
00:09:57,446 --> 00:09:58,336
Ha Ni!

101
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,669
Oh! Ha Ni!

102
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,769
What happened now?

103
00:10:06,403 --> 00:10:08,311
I guess something happened again.

104
00:10:12,036 --> 00:10:16,069
Ha Ni, why do you look so down again?

105
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,703
Was Baek Seung Jo mean to you again?

106
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:24,136
Did you get kicked out of Seung Jo's company?

107
00:10:24,469 --> 00:10:28,236
I said I was sick and that I was going to take a day off today.

108
00:10:29,236 --> 00:10:31,836
So, you're really sick?

109
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:37,403
You should go to the hospital if you're sick. Why did you come to school?

110
00:10:40,236 --> 00:10:42,069
It hurts here.

111
00:10:43,736 --> 00:10:44,703
Why?

112
00:10:45,703 --> 00:10:49,736
It's because there's going to be a marriage .

113
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:50,769
Marriage?

114
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:54,036
Maybe... Baek Seung Jo?!

115
00:10:54,336 --> 00:10:55,803
Who's the other person?

116
00:10:57,403 --> 00:10:58,303
Yoon Hae Ra.

117
00:10:59,003 --> 00:10:59,669
What?

118
00:10:59,936 --> 00:11:01,203
Yoon Hae Ra?!

119
00:11:02,636 --> 00:11:04,803
Why suddenly with Yoon Hae Ra?

120
00:11:05,636 --> 00:11:07,736
It was a marriage meeting.

121
00:11:08,303 --> 00:11:11,803
One of the big investors of the company, she's his granddaughter.

122
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:13,069
Oh my goodness.

123
00:11:13,469 --> 00:11:16,703
Yoon Hae Ra is no ordinary girl.

124
00:11:16,803 --> 00:11:17,936
Hey...

125
00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:22,769
So are they going to get married?

126
00:11:23,136 --> 00:11:24,469
He said he likes the idea.

127
00:11:25,736 --> 00:11:29,469
It's the first time I heard Seung Jo say something like that.

128
00:11:29,603 --> 00:11:31,757
Hey! That's good then!

129
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:34,623
Now, you can completely forget someone like Baek Seung Jo.

130
00:11:34,623 --> 00:11:37,203
And you can meet a good guy.

131
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,208
Excuse me, President.

132
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:55,060
How did the meeting go with the chairman's granddaughter?

133
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,293
Fine.

134
00:11:56,927 --> 00:11:59,793
I heard that you two already knew each other.

135
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,893
Ah, yes. Then, I'll be leaving.

136
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:19,160
Even if you're busy, don't skip meals. Fighting.

137
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,493
Acting like a girlfriend...

138
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,660
You've got a text.

139
00:12:55,027 --> 00:12:59,360
Looks like you're taking a leave of absence. I'll take it from today's salary.

140
00:13:18,893 --> 00:13:20,160
Hello!

141
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,427
Really delicious.

142
00:13:34,427 --> 00:13:34,927
Really!

143
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:36,460
Did you make it all by yourself?

144
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,126
Of course. I made the soup base on my own, and made the noddles too!

145
00:13:39,126 --> 00:13:42,393
This whole bowl I made all with my power.

146
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,960
How did you already...

147
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,127
You're amazing Bong Joon Gu.

148
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:52,660
I wanted to let you have the first noodles that I made.

149
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,660
Before I started working, I washed my hands throughly and prepared my heart.

150
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,927
I put all my passion into it.

151
00:13:58,927 --> 00:14:01,460
What am I that you'd go that far for me?

152
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,460
What do you mean what are you? If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't even wash my face.

153
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,927
It's really true.

154
00:14:06,927 --> 00:14:11,960
Since I never know when you're coming, I dress nicely, wash my hair everday, and work hard at learning how to cook.

155
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,593
To put it in one sentence, Ha Ni, you are the reason that I live.

156
00:14:15,793 --> 00:14:17,193
Thank you.

157
00:14:17,793 --> 00:14:22,427
Since you're saying that to me, I feel like a special person.

158
00:14:22,427 --> 00:14:25,460
And this is really delicious.

159
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:29,060
You're really cool.
You did well Bong Joon Gu.

160
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,627
Really?

161
00:14:34,593 --> 00:14:43,893
If you think that, we should go on a date sometime..

162
00:14:45,193 --> 00:14:48,027
It would be good to go on a date...

163
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:51,527
Ok, let's do it.

164
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,527
Let's go on a date.

165
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,827
Re..really?

166
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,560
Rea... Really? For real?

167
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,860
Date, date.

168
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,393
Ha Ni, thank you!

169
00:15:08,393 --> 00:15:10,760
When will we go on one? When will we go on the date?

170
00:15:23,827 --> 00:15:25,193
Where is Ha Ni?

171
00:15:25,193 --> 00:15:26,927
She is going on a date.

172
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:27,893
Date?

173
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,227
She really dolled herself up before leaving.

174
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:35,360
A red coat, and red shoes. She went out completely in red.

175
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,727
Really?

176
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,727
Sounds like she went with a guy with strange tastes.

177
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,093
Ha Ni!
Here, here!

178
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,760
Did you come early?

179
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,427
No, it has been about 3 hours?

180
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:09,860
What?

181
00:16:10,727 --> 00:16:12,493
Did I get the time wrong?

182
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:17,460
No, it's not that. At home, I kept looking at the clock but it felt like it wasn't moving.

183
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,627
So I just came.

184
00:16:19,627 --> 00:16:21,727
I see.

185
00:16:21,727 --> 00:16:23,727
You really came.

186
00:16:23,727 --> 00:16:26,760
I'm so touched that I feel like I'm going to die.

187
00:16:27,493 --> 00:16:30,927
Ha Ni is very pretty today.

188
00:16:30,927 --> 00:16:32,860
Where are we going now?

189
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,660
First, the basics of a date...

190
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,227
Let's watch a movie first. It was a wish of mine to watch a movie with you.

191
00:16:41,227 --> 00:16:43,660
I did too...

192
00:16:44,927 --> 00:16:46,427
Oh, I really wanted to see this movie.

193
00:16:46,427 --> 00:16:48,727
Is that right? I thought so that's why I got it.

194
00:16:48,727 --> 00:16:49,827
Let's go in.

195
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:52,193
Here's the Giant Combo.

196
00:16:52,193 --> 00:16:53,827
Let's go!

197
00:16:53,827 --> 00:16:56,793
My beating heart

198
00:16:56,793 --> 00:17:01,327
Is a mess like my room

199
00:17:01,327 --> 00:17:05,893
I just can't get a hold of it

200
00:17:08,593 --> 00:17:10,060
Take this.

201
00:17:14,893 --> 00:17:16,127
How is it?

202
00:17:16,127 --> 00:17:18,027
It's delicious.

203
00:17:23,693 --> 00:17:25,327
How is it?

204
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:31,927
For your own sake, forget all about me

205
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:38,193
I will call you, you

206
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,227
I wish to marry you

207
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:45,560
I wish to kiss you

208
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,593
I wish to steal your heart

209
00:17:49,593 --> 00:17:52,160
-Should I put it in (your hair?)
-I don't want it.

210
00:17:52,893 --> 00:17:55,327
-
-

211
00:17:55,827 --> 00:17:57,627
It's pretty, why not?

212
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:01,127
Do you want to take a picture?

213
00:18:01,693 --> 00:18:02,793
- Watch, watch!
- Hey!

214
00:18:02,793 --> 00:18:03,827
Hey!

215
00:18:03,827 --> 00:18:07,227
I'm sorry, but can you take one picture for us?

216
00:18:07,227 --> 00:18:09,093
-Hey!
-Here.

217
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,127
-You do it too, you do it too.
-Okay okay.

218
00:18:18,327 --> 00:18:21,127
My beating heart

219
00:18:21,127 --> 00:18:25,360
Like my messy room

220
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,293
Marriage?

221
00:18:26,293 --> 00:18:27,210
Yes.

222
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:31,593
I found out that the both of them got into Parang University ranked 1st or 2nd in their schools.

223
00:18:31,593 --> 00:18:34,693
During some point in high school,

224
00:18:34,693 --> 00:18:37,951
I heard that they met once at a tennis tournament.

225
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,593
Yes.

226
00:18:38,593 --> 00:18:40,160
It's a match made in heaven isn't it?!

227
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,193
If that's why you think so, then every couple is a match made in heaven!

228
00:18:45,193 --> 00:18:48,127
For a couple to be a match made in--

229
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:54,360
But this goes for both Seung Jo and Hae Ra. Maybe after they finish their studies--

230
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,960
Can they not study after they get married?

231
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,293
I'm thinking it might be nice if they study abroad.

232
00:19:02,627 --> 00:19:08,260
If those two get married think about how talented their children would be?

233
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,327
Doing business and all, I've learned that people are the most important factor.

234
00:19:12,327 --> 00:19:17,360
One smart person can do the work of 100 people.

235
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,093
Chairman Baek, no need to worry about money now. Just carry on with your company.

236
00:19:23,793 --> 00:19:25,027
Yes.

237
00:19:48,326 --> 00:19:51,260
Baek Seung Jo! Yoon Hae Ra!

238
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:54,727
Laugh while you can!

239
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:58,693
After today, living will suck.

240
00:20:05,393 --> 00:20:07,093
It's very entertaining.

241
00:20:07,093 --> 00:20:08,727
Keep going.

242
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,900
Ah, I'm so full.

243
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,600
I was going to buy dinner.

244
00:20:26,216 --> 00:20:29,570
What are you talking about? The man usually pays for the meals.

245
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,323
Today was fun.

246
00:20:33,323 --> 00:20:34,773
The movie was fun as well.

247
00:20:34,773 --> 00:20:36,854
I also had a great time.

248
00:20:36,854 --> 00:20:38,999
This is the best day of my life.

249
00:20:47,014 --> 00:20:50,539
Ha Ni, your smiling face is the best thing in the world.

250
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,623
If I got to see your smiling face everyday,

251
00:20:53,623 --> 00:20:55,819
I'd probably be full even if I didn't eat.

252
00:21:00,256 --> 00:21:01,246
Why?

253
00:21:01,246 --> 00:21:04,046
Is there something on my face?

254
00:21:06,386 --> 00:21:09,083
Then, am I being strange?

255
00:21:15,124 --> 00:21:16,585
Thank you.

256
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:19,557
Ha Ni.

257
00:21:21,526 --> 00:21:24,898
You really are a good person.

258
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,323
I already knew...

259
00:21:28,323 --> 00:21:30,306
but I really feel it these days.

260
00:21:33,023 --> 00:21:35,323
Ha Ni, have you ever been to the Han river?

261
00:21:35,323 --> 00:21:36,626
I haven't been there at night.

262
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:38,914
I haven't been there since I came up from Busan.

263
00:21:38,914 --> 00:21:40,260
Do you want to go?

264
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,639
Okay.

265
00:21:46,157 --> 00:21:49,527
Wah! The Han River is so pretty!

266
00:21:50,423 --> 00:21:52,006
It is.

267
00:21:57,772 --> 00:22:00,357
Your mind is everywhere these days, isn't it?

268
00:22:01,027 --> 00:22:02,957
Is the game development going okay?

269
00:22:02,957 --> 00:22:06,278
My grandpa said that the idea was really good.

270
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:07,299
It's just okay.

271
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:08,910
I'm going to go at it like a blue frog.

272
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,939
Blue frog?

273
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:13,323
Since everyone is always saying 3D, 3D,

274
00:22:13,323 --> 00:22:15,201
I'm planning to do something different from 3D.

275
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:17,290
Like an animation.

276
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,838
That's great.

277
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:23,768
Everyone's always talking about how to make a game more realistic,

278
00:22:23,768 --> 00:22:26,500
An animation type of game .

279
00:22:27,257 --> 00:22:28,723
That's contrarian.

280
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:31,090
That's exactly it. Contrarian.

281
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:35,670
Taking the game's weakest point and making it into the strongest.

282
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,853
I'm thinking about making it look like an animation.

283
00:22:38,853 --> 00:22:43,390
There was a reason that my Grandpa was so interested.

284
00:22:44,251 --> 00:22:47,234
He's really into you.

285
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,357
Do you want to go to a jazz bar in a little bit?

286
00:22:56,057 --> 00:22:57,990
Omo, omo. Ha Ni, let's get going.

287
00:23:00,757 --> 00:23:02,784
Wow, is this really the Han river?

288
00:23:02,784 --> 00:23:03,990
It's really pretty.

289
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:07,360
Ha Ni, what's this lit up area?

290
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,023
It seems like it's a cafe.

291
00:23:09,023 --> 00:23:10,323
Cafe?

292
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:13,357
Then, let's go inside the cafe.

293
00:23:13,357 --> 00:23:15,323
Should we have a caramel macchiato?

294
00:23:15,323 --> 00:23:16,123
Okay..

295
00:23:16,123 --> 00:23:16,790
Really...

296
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,323
Let's go.

297
00:23:18,323 --> 00:23:19,423
Let's go.

298
00:23:20,623 --> 00:23:22,023
The cafe is really pretty.

299
00:23:23,157 --> 00:23:26,952
This is the first time I've been someplace like this in my life.

300
00:23:26,952 --> 00:23:30,123
If I didn't know you, I would have never come here.

301
00:23:30,123 --> 00:23:32,890
These places come out on dramas.

302
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:33,590
Do you like it?

303
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,723
I really like today.

304
00:23:38,695 --> 00:23:41,857
Ha Ni, aren't you cold? You should have dressed warmly.

305
00:23:47,323 --> 00:23:48,890
Oh, Baek Seung Jo

306
00:23:49,723 --> 00:23:51,490
You're on a date?

307
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,657
Can you not see?

308
00:23:53,657 --> 00:23:56,857
Hey looking at you two, it looks like you're having a good time too.

309
00:23:56,857 --> 00:23:58,657
Yeah. It's good.

310
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:02,490
Could it be that Seoul is that small?

311
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:05,057
How did we run into one another here?

312
00:24:05,057 --> 00:24:06,157
I wonder...

313
00:24:06,157 --> 00:24:08,423
Ah! You wanna go together?

314
00:24:09,123 --> 00:24:11,157
We're going to a jazz bar.

315
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,023
It's just a casual place.

316
00:24:13,023 --> 00:24:13,923
Jazz?

317
00:24:13,923 --> 00:24:16,354
What's wrong? It'll be annoying for all of us.

318
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:20,390
You guys should go to some place like an arcade.

319
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,723
Isn't that more comfortable?

320
00:24:21,723 --> 00:24:23,657
Hey, what are you implying?

321
00:24:23,657 --> 00:24:26,523
We have ears too and we know how to listen to music as well.

322
00:24:27,357 --> 00:24:30,323
That's right. You know me quite well.

323
00:24:30,923 --> 00:24:32,257
Let's go somewhere else, Joon Gu.

324
00:24:32,257 --> 00:24:33,223
Sure.

325
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:34,556
Oh Ha Ni...

326
00:24:36,056 --> 00:24:38,723
You look quite good together.

327
00:24:41,723 --> 00:24:42,890
Really?

328
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,123
Does it really look that way?

329
00:24:45,123 --> 00:24:49,257
You guys are a match made in heaven too! You and your nasty personalities look perfect together!

330
00:24:49,257 --> 00:24:50,720
Let's go.

331
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,657
Good bye!

332
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,926
Ha Ni...

333
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:27,792
What?

334
00:25:28,992 --> 00:25:30,692
Ah...

335
00:25:30,692 --> 00:25:32,059
Wow!

336
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:33,892
It's so pretty!

337
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,326
It's really pretty.

338
00:25:40,292 --> 00:25:42,326
Thank you

339
00:25:42,326 --> 00:25:43,792
for bringing me here.

340
00:26:02,592 --> 00:26:04,059
Marry me.

341
00:26:04,826 --> 00:26:06,126
What?

342
00:26:06,126 --> 00:26:08,226
What I'm saying is...

343
00:26:08,226 --> 00:26:09,759
marry me.

344
00:26:23,826 --> 00:26:24,892
Why?

345
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:27,826
Do you not have hands?

346
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:31,159
You'd probably say that if I were Ha Ni.

347
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:32,592
Probably.

348
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,926
Why are you so mean to Ha Ni?

349
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,159
Well...

350
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:43,892
Oh, am I weird?

351
00:26:43,892 --> 00:26:48,226
Why do I feel that it'd be nice if you were mean to me too?

352
00:27:11,126 --> 00:27:13,159
Will you...

353
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:14,792
marry me?

354
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:18,826
Bong Joon Gu.

355
00:27:18,826 --> 00:27:20,492
I look at you,

356
00:27:20,492 --> 00:27:22,159
and you look at Baek Seung Jo.

357
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:24,692
It's already been 4 years of that.

358
00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:27,959
Of course...

359
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:31,792
I can wait however long for you.

360
00:27:32,492 --> 00:27:34,526
But, Baek Seung Jo...

361
00:27:34,526 --> 00:27:37,192
he's found someone else now.

362
00:27:38,026 --> 00:27:40,092
Both looking at someone else's back like that...

363
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:43,859
let's stop that now, Ha Ni.

364
00:27:45,126 --> 00:27:46,859
All you have to do it is turn around.

365
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:48,826
If you just turn around...

366
00:27:50,426 --> 00:27:51,926
I'm right here.

367
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,659
Joon Gu...

368
00:27:55,659 --> 00:27:57,426
Let's get married,

369
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:58,792
Ha Ni.

370
00:28:15,626 --> 00:28:16,959
He's late.

371
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:22,759
What is he doing right now?

372
00:28:25,459 --> 00:28:27,326
Jazz bar.

373
00:28:29,859 --> 00:28:31,692
It must be fun.

374
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:38,192
I'm thinking of Baek Seung Jo again.

375
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,692
You were home.

376
00:28:49,692 --> 00:28:51,326
What time is it right now?!

377
00:28:52,526 --> 00:28:54,391
11 o'clock.

378
00:28:54,391 --> 00:28:55,926
What have you done until now?

379
00:28:57,226 --> 00:28:59,659
You go to a marriage meeting without even telling us.

380
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:01,859
I heard you went on a date again.

381
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:03,626
What are you planning to do?

382
00:29:03,626 --> 00:29:05,426
What are you doing right now?

383
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:09,192
He said he's fine, so what's wrong with you?

384
00:29:09,192 --> 00:29:11,392
You don't have to do that. Your father's fine.

385
00:29:11,392 --> 00:29:13,059
I'm not doing it because of Father.

386
00:29:13,092 --> 00:29:13,992
Then,

387
00:29:13,992 --> 00:29:16,926
what's the reason to keep seeing President Yoon's granddaughter?

388
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:22,259
Are you really curious?

389
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:24,692
Because I like her.

390
00:29:24,692 --> 00:29:25,992
What?!

391
00:29:29,592 --> 00:29:30,792
That makes no sense.

392
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:33,092
That reason is enough right?

393
00:29:33,092 --> 00:29:34,992
You... Baek Seung Jo.

394
00:29:48,226 --> 00:29:49,692
Welcome back.

395
00:29:49,692 --> 00:29:50,759
You're late.

396
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:53,126
You came early.

397
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:55,192
You looked good together.

398
00:29:55,192 --> 00:29:57,559
Yes, it was good.

399
00:29:58,526 --> 00:30:01,926
It was fun, and he was nice.

400
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:05,559
Unlike someone, he wasn't mean to me.

401
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:06,992
I liked it.

402
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:09,859
That's good then.

403
00:30:09,859 --> 00:30:11,359
Good luck to you.

404
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:49,904
What? A proposal?

405
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:56,436
Bong Joon Gu is amazing.

406
00:30:56,436 --> 00:30:58,015
Marriage?

407
00:30:58,015 --> 00:30:59,803
So, what did you say?

408
00:30:59,803 --> 00:31:01,792
What did you say?

409
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,323
I didn't say anything.

410
00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:06,992
What is this?

411
00:31:06,992 --> 00:31:09,757
I know that Joon Gu is a really good person,

412
00:31:10,823 --> 00:31:12,418
but still...

413
00:31:12,418 --> 00:31:14,726
I don't have those feelings for him.

414
00:31:14,726 --> 00:31:17,605
Even when I received that sudden proposal...

415
00:31:19,856 --> 00:31:22,388
I was a little surprised.

416
00:31:22,388 --> 00:31:25,679
But since it passed, I just calmed down.

417
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:26,615
Hey...

418
00:31:26,615 --> 00:31:29,842
where is there a person who thinks about you as much as Joon Gu?

419
00:31:29,842 --> 00:31:30,950
Yeah.

420
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,861
Hey, honestly speaking,

421
00:31:32,861 --> 00:31:35,183
instead of Baek Seung Jo,

422
00:31:35,183 --> 00:31:38,851
you look much better with Bong Joon Gu.

423
00:31:47,426 --> 00:31:48,661
Baek Seung Jo

424
00:31:48,661 --> 00:31:51,424
is getting married with Yoon Hae Ra.

425
00:31:52,121 --> 00:31:53,816
Yeah, Ha Ni.

426
00:31:53,816 --> 00:31:57,624
This time, think carefully about Bong Joon Gu.

427
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,224
He looked at only you for four years.

428
00:32:00,224 --> 00:32:04,102
You probably know how Joon Gu feels, better than anyone.

429
00:32:04,102 --> 00:32:05,960
You know what I'm saying right?

430
00:32:06,917 --> 00:32:08,467
Okay.

431
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:17,170
The person that looks good with me

432
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,982
is not Baek Seung Jo,

433
00:32:18,982 --> 00:32:21,304
and it could be Bong Joon Gu.

434
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:25,056
Even if I don't get excited, he's comfortable,

435
00:32:25,056 --> 00:32:26,482
like family.

436
00:32:37,938 --> 00:32:39,438
I see you again.

437
00:32:43,475 --> 00:32:45,290
Are you shopping?

438
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,191
We're going to go eat dinner.

439
00:32:49,957 --> 00:32:51,443
Really?

440
00:32:52,233 --> 00:32:54,044
Do you want to come with us?

441
00:32:55,158 --> 00:32:56,551
Oh...

442
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,106
Shall we?

443
00:32:59,106 --> 00:33:01,219
Yes, let's go together.

444
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:03,843
Whatever you choose.

445
00:33:03,843 --> 00:33:06,211
It's not like I'm begging you to come with us.

446
00:33:06,211 --> 00:33:09,044
Yes, let's go together.

447
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,249
Are you going to look at those all day?

448
00:33:25,249 --> 00:33:27,285
Oh, Chef! I'm sorry.

449
00:33:27,285 --> 00:33:28,167
Clean it up.

450
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:29,375
Yes!

451
00:33:35,459 --> 00:33:36,427
Welco...

452
00:33:36,427 --> 00:33:38,616
Welcome.

453
00:33:41,946 --> 00:33:42,778
Dad.

454
00:33:42,778 --> 00:33:45,350
Oh! Ha Ni!

455
00:33:46,013 --> 00:33:46,974
Hello.

456
00:33:46,974 --> 00:33:49,310
Come in.

457
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:53,426
This place...Ha Ni, this is your...

458
00:33:53,426 --> 00:33:54,326
Yeah.

459
00:33:54,326 --> 00:33:55,062
Yeah that's right.

460
00:33:55,062 --> 00:33:56,734
Oh Ha Ni and Bong Joon Gu...

461
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:59,550
This place has 60 years of tradition, So Pal Bok Noodles, which Oh Ha Ni and Bong Joon Gu will be taking on!

462
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,546
Ah, but you're friends?

463
00:34:02,546 --> 00:34:06,865
Friends, Chef? They're getting married.

464
00:34:10,603 --> 00:34:12,661
Is that so?

465
00:34:12,661 --> 00:34:15,363
Sit... sit down please.

466
00:34:21,766 --> 00:34:24,513
Wow pretty.

467
00:34:24,513 --> 00:34:27,107
It's so pretty it feels like a waste to eat it.

468
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:29,521
Since this rascal came, our chef

469
00:34:29,521 --> 00:34:31,147
made something special.

470
00:34:31,147 --> 00:34:32,424
Of course.

471
00:34:32,424 --> 00:34:35,134
If it's Seung Jo and his friend, then they're VIP.

472
00:34:35,134 --> 00:34:36,208
Please eat a lot.

473
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:38,321
Yes. I'll eat well.

474
00:34:41,017 --> 00:34:45,164
Ah look at this, look at this. You don't even know how to eat it.

475
00:34:45,164 --> 00:34:47,579
With this Pyongyang Neng Myun...

476
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:51,109
you put the vinegar right onto the noodles.

477
00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:54,313
And after waiting a little bit for the noodles to soak up the vinegar...

478
00:34:54,313 --> 00:34:58,771
you pull them apart and eat them.

479
00:34:58,771 --> 00:35:00,413
Ohhh.

480
00:35:00,413 --> 00:35:02,813
Oh, it's like that. I didn't know either.

481
00:35:02,813 --> 00:35:07,618
Really? Well it's okay to not know. A lot of people don't. Eat a lot!

482
00:35:09,426 --> 00:35:11,054
Makes me look at him differently.

483
00:35:12,205 --> 00:35:14,282
You must be happy, Oh Ha Ni.

484
00:35:14,282 --> 00:35:16,418
Since your boyfriend knows a lot.

485
00:35:18,322 --> 00:35:21,411
I can't use chopsticks very well.

486
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,849
You can't make fun of me for using them strangely.

487
00:35:31,345 --> 00:35:32,224
Ha Ni.

488
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,089
What are you looking at like that?

489
00:35:34,089 --> 00:35:36,178
Seung Jo's face will fall off.

490
00:35:38,586 --> 00:35:40,219
Your Imagination Will Become A Game.

491
00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:42,943
Your imagination will become a game.

492
00:35:42,943 --> 00:35:46,953
We've portrayed many fun features for users within this game.

493
00:35:49,133 --> 00:35:51,961
It's a stylish action with top notch visuals.

494
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:53,586
With the various missions systems,

495
00:35:53,586 --> 00:35:56,147
users can enjoy different levels of enjoyment through the game.

496
00:35:56,147 --> 00:35:58,469
Especially because our games style concept differs from other games.

497
00:35:58,469 --> 00:35:59,723
Action game...

498
00:35:59,723 --> 00:36:01,866
That's the focus and the factor that will differentiate our game.

499
00:36:01,866 --> 00:36:06,032
Then, I will show the demo version.

500
00:36:06,032 --> 00:36:10,498
You have all just experienced the world of imagination.

501
00:36:11,761 --> 00:36:16,860
Just like he said, it looks like an animated movie.

502
00:36:18,621 --> 00:36:21,675
It must not have been easy, but you finished in a short time period.

503
00:36:21,675 --> 00:36:24,708
It was due to the late nights that the employees worked.

504
00:36:27,736 --> 00:36:29,863
-You worked hard.
-Goodbye.

505
00:36:30,428 --> 00:36:31,744
You worked hard.

506
00:36:31,744 --> 00:36:35,004
Should I ask Hae Ra to come out so that we can go eat somewhere?

507
00:36:35,004 --> 00:36:36,465
I'm sorry.

508
00:36:36,465 --> 00:36:38,710
Today is the day that my father gets discharged from the hospital,

509
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,730
so I have to go home and eat dinner at home.

510
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,263
Ah is that so?

511
00:36:42,263 --> 00:36:43,981
Then the timing is good!

512
00:36:43,981 --> 00:36:46,851
I'll ask Hae Ra to go over there.

513
00:36:46,851 --> 00:36:49,995
She needs to give her greetings now that he's out of the hospital.

514
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:54,592
Seung Jo, your mother came out.

515
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,583
-Hello.
-Yes.

516
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:03,695
Why are you here? Come here.

517
00:37:07,781 --> 00:37:10,328
I've met you once before.

518
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,232
I'm Yoon Hae Ra.

519
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:13,865
Oh is that so?

520
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:16,651
It seems like I've seen you before,

521
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:20,150
but I guess your impression wasn't that great.

522
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,156
Ah!

523
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:25,196
You know that Ha Ni and Seung Jo are living together right?

524
00:37:25,707 --> 00:37:27,913
Yes, of course.

525
00:37:29,244 --> 00:37:32,905
Oh my, you bought cake.

526
00:37:32,905 --> 00:37:36,510
He's (father) forbidden to eat anything sweet.

527
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:39,978
And Seung Jo doesn't like sweet things.

528
00:37:39,978 --> 00:37:43,912
I bought it, so that you could eat it.

529
00:37:43,912 --> 00:37:46,652
Oh, really?

530
00:37:47,395 --> 00:37:50,474
These are rice cakes.

531
00:37:50,474 --> 00:37:54,361
It's set to eat comfortably.

532
00:37:54,361 --> 00:37:55,591
Please eat it once.

533
00:37:55,591 --> 00:37:57,860
She is different from Oh Ha Ni.

534
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,051
What about rice cakes?

535
00:37:59,051 --> 00:38:01,652
Even if it's simple, rice cakes are rice cakes.

536
00:38:02,371 --> 00:38:06,342
Shall I eat cake?

537
00:38:09,114 --> 00:38:11,265
Then please talk.

538
00:38:11,265 --> 00:38:13,703
I should go in and lay down.

539
00:38:15,305 --> 00:38:17,534
Me too.

540
00:38:44,778 --> 00:38:46,652
Seung Jo.

541
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,680
He is my son,

542
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,937
but Seung Jo has a very tiring temper.

543
00:38:57,937 --> 00:39:01,164
He's self centered and naughty...

544
00:39:01,164 --> 00:39:02,627
And he's no fun.

545
00:39:02,627 --> 00:39:04,322
That's not true.

546
00:39:04,322 --> 00:39:05,646
He is fun.

547
00:39:05,646 --> 00:39:06,575
And he can converse well.

548
00:39:06,575 --> 00:39:08,525
You too...

549
00:39:08,525 --> 00:39:11,358
must be a boring style.

550
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:14,980
You talk back well and only talk about things from books.

551
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,397
You must be like that?

552
00:39:16,397 --> 00:39:18,997
Yes, you're right.

553
00:39:18,997 --> 00:39:23,409
We're both rational and logical.

554
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:27,264
But even though people look at us like that,

555
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,168
it's fun for us.

556
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:34,530
More than that, he is not good to women.

557
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:37,032
He doesn't say a single nice thing.

558
00:39:37,032 --> 00:39:42,937
He's the type of person to fix someone's love letter and give it back.

559
00:39:42,937 --> 00:39:43,912
Really?

560
00:39:45,297 --> 00:39:47,535
I've done that before too.

561
00:39:47,535 --> 00:39:50,298
Wow really? You really did that before?

562
00:39:50,948 --> 00:39:52,666
Yes.

563
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:56,335
You guys must be one of a kind.

564
00:39:56,335 --> 00:39:59,486
Baek Seung Jo seems like he's smart, right?

565
00:39:59,486 --> 00:40:02,326
But, he's dumb.

566
00:40:02,326 --> 00:40:05,228
He doesn't know his own feelings.

567
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:09,540
If he likes someone, he's colder to them and hurts them more.

568
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:13,634
And he pushes them away. That's what I see.

569
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:18,371
That means he's scared. People's feelings...

570
00:40:18,371 --> 00:40:21,661
can't be solved easily like a math equation.

571
00:40:21,661 --> 00:40:23,781
that he might get caught.

572
00:40:23,781 --> 00:40:25,226
Are you like that too?

573
00:40:25,226 --> 00:40:26,776
Mother!

574
00:40:46,566 --> 00:40:47,532
You're childish.

575
00:40:47,532 --> 00:40:49,165
What? Childish?

576
00:40:49,165 --> 00:40:52,032
I won't say anything about you liking Oh Ha Ni.

577
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:56,266
But, why are you pushing me to like her as well?

578
00:40:56,266 --> 00:40:57,866
Were my words wrong?

579
00:40:57,866 --> 00:40:59,566
You are my son.

580
00:40:59,566 --> 00:41:00,999
I know you.

581
00:41:00,999 --> 00:41:02,232
But you don't know yourself.

582
00:41:02,232 --> 00:41:03,366
Even if I don't,

583
00:41:03,366 --> 00:41:04,932
Let me do things the way I want.

584
00:41:04,932 --> 00:41:05,932
Beak Seung Jo.

585
00:41:05,932 --> 00:41:07,799
My career and even my love life.

586
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:09,832
Please stop your meddling.

587
00:41:09,832 --> 00:41:11,432
Meddling?

588
00:41:13,112 --> 00:41:15,266
I have always respected your decisions.

589
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:16,966
Isn't that so?

590
00:41:16,966 --> 00:41:18,406
But what is this?

591
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:20,582
You obviously know Ha Ni's feelings and you still brought her to our house!

592
00:41:20,582 --> 00:41:22,932
This is a problem with courtesy among people.

593
00:41:22,932 --> 00:41:25,699
Are you a kid that doesn't have courtesy?

594
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:27,099
Mother,

595
00:41:28,066 --> 00:41:29,499
I'm fine.

596
00:41:29,499 --> 00:41:30,932
Now, please

597
00:41:30,932 --> 00:41:32,501
Would you stop this!

598
00:41:32,501 --> 00:41:34,666
Baek Seung Jo, you!

599
00:41:35,532 --> 00:41:36,932
Right.

600
00:41:37,899 --> 00:41:42,999
Since you have always respected my decision, please do so this time as well.

601
00:41:58,666 --> 00:42:03,966
I thought that Seung Jo really liked Ha Ni.

602
00:42:03,966 --> 00:42:08,732
Since he is my son I believed that he would eventually come to like her.

603
00:42:09,899 --> 00:42:12,799
You can't control your kids like that.

604
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:16,699
But don't those two really suit each other well?

605
00:42:16,699 --> 00:42:21,066
They fill the missing spots and share what they have too much of.

606
00:42:21,066 --> 00:42:22,732
Isn't it really like that?

607
00:42:22,732 --> 00:42:25,132
That's how I see it too,

608
00:42:25,132 --> 00:42:28,966
but Seung Jo is not going that way. What can we do?

609
00:42:28,966 --> 00:42:31,399
What to do?

610
00:42:31,399 --> 00:42:37,532
I feel like I did something bad to both Seung Jo and Ha Ni.

611
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,699
He likes her.

612
00:42:45,017 --> 00:42:45,399
What?

613
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:47,932
Hyung likes Oh Ha Ni.

614
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:49,666
So don't cry, Mom.

615
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:53,132
Eun Jo! What are you talking about?

616
00:42:53,132 --> 00:42:54,666
Baek Eun Jo!

617
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:03,432
Hyung...

618
00:43:06,866 --> 00:43:10,532
Are you really going to get married to Hae Ra?

619
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:15,966
Isn't she pretty? You like pretty Nunas.

620
00:43:15,966 --> 00:43:18,066
Do you like that Nuna?

621
00:43:19,266 --> 00:43:22,232
Won't it turn out like that, if we keep going on?

622
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:23,366
But still!

623
00:43:23,932 --> 00:43:26,866
Still, the person you like is . . .

624
00:43:26,866 --> 00:43:30,266
That nuna is a woman that suits me very well.

625
00:43:30,266 --> 00:43:33,766
She is smart, and she can play tennis well too.

626
00:43:33,766 --> 00:43:34,399
Hyung!

627
00:43:34,399 --> 00:43:38,799
If you meet her for a couple more times, you'll definitely like her.

628
00:43:52,866 --> 00:43:54,301
Liar.

629
00:44:13,799 --> 00:44:16,332
Sleeping in a place like this...

630
00:44:16,332 --> 00:44:18,866
She's really carefree.

631
00:44:20,266 --> 00:44:21,499
Right!

632
00:44:22,332 --> 00:44:25,899
A bug on top of her hand?

633
00:44:25,899 --> 00:44:29,032
Oh Ha Ni, you'll be surprised for sure.

634
00:44:33,532 --> 00:44:34,999
Oh!

635
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:30,266
Then hyung went back to the pension.

636
00:45:44,299 --> 00:45:46,599
So it was a dream!

637
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:53,599
H..hyung kissed Oh Ha Ni.

638
00:45:57,932 --> 00:45:59,866
After doing that...

639
00:46:00,832 --> 00:46:02,999
I saw everything.

640
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:09,366
But still I can't tell that to Mom.

641
00:46:18,266 --> 00:46:22,199
Hyung is saying it isn't so.

642
00:46:24,499 --> 00:46:26,966
But this is for sure.

643
00:46:28,499 --> 00:46:32,832
Hyung likes Oh Ha Ni.

644
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,566
Is something going wrong?

645
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:56,499
No. There isn't anything that's going well or anything that's going wrong

646
00:46:56,499 --> 00:47:00,366
I'm just playing.

647
00:47:00,366 --> 00:47:03,532
What is this, genius Yoon He Ra?

648
00:47:03,532 --> 00:47:07,299
Should Grandpa put some speed into it?

649
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:13,266
Put speed?

650
00:47:13,266 --> 00:47:17,199
Yeah, we're the ones that pulled the knife.

651
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:20,632
He's the one that's supposed to be trying, not us.

652
00:47:20,832 --> 00:47:22,699
I don't want it, Grandpa.

653
00:47:22,699 --> 00:47:26,799
Scaring someone to make them do something, that hurts my pride more.

654
00:47:26,799 --> 00:47:27,932
Really?

655
00:47:28,532 --> 00:47:30,632
Then should Grandpa just stay still?

656
00:47:30,632 --> 00:47:32,266
Yeah. For now.

657
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:35,266
If I really think there's nothing I can do,

658
00:47:35,266 --> 00:47:38,632
then I might ask you to use a knife.

659
00:47:38,632 --> 00:47:41,132
Yeah. Don't hold it in.

660
00:47:41,699 --> 00:47:43,232
I won't hold back.

661
00:47:50,799 --> 00:47:52,566
Baek Eun Jo...

662
00:47:52,566 --> 00:47:56,932
I made the pudding that you like!

663
00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:05,399
Here! Eat it.

664
00:48:11,632 --> 00:48:12,999
Is it good?

665
00:48:15,299 --> 00:48:16,766
That's a relief.

666
00:48:16,766 --> 00:48:19,232
But, Eun Jo...

667
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:23,632
what was that you told me before,

668
00:48:23,632 --> 00:48:27,332
about Seung Jo liking Ha Ni.

669
00:48:27,332 --> 00:48:28,332
I'm not eating anymore.

670
00:48:28,332 --> 00:48:31,766
Ah, why?

671
00:48:32,566 --> 00:48:35,632
You're hiding something aren't you? Come here!

672
00:48:39,566 --> 00:48:44,066
Maybe because the weather is clear today, there are many stars in the sky.

673
00:48:46,266 --> 00:48:47,632
Dad.

674
00:48:48,732 --> 00:48:52,632
What do you think about me dating Joon Gu?

675
00:48:53,832 --> 00:48:55,332
Joon Gu?

676
00:48:56,666 --> 00:48:59,199
Why? Did something happen?

677
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:02,399
No, I was just saying "What if"

678
00:49:02,399 --> 00:49:04,231
What if that's the case.

679
00:49:04,832 --> 00:49:05,966
What if?

680
00:49:05,966 --> 00:49:08,666
Yeah, what if that's the case.

681
00:49:10,766 --> 00:49:12,766
Well, who knows?!

682
00:49:13,566 --> 00:49:18,032
I didn't like him much because he was rough on the edges and all...

683
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,266
He's like a man.

684
00:49:23,266 --> 00:49:26,532
And when he cooks, he really focuses.

685
00:49:27,132 --> 00:49:29,732
As a chef I think he's great.

686
00:49:29,732 --> 00:49:36,132
And more than anything else, he really likes you Ha Ni.

687
00:49:36,132 --> 00:49:41,366
He cares for you, so there's nothing not to like.

688
00:49:41,366 --> 00:49:43,199
Is that so?

689
00:49:46,332 --> 00:49:51,666
I guess Seung Jo's getting married?

690
00:49:52,966 --> 00:49:53,466
Yes.

691
00:49:53,466 --> 00:49:58,799
It's that girl who came to the restaurant?

692
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:06,332
I feel like I've made an unwise decision.

693
00:50:06,332 --> 00:50:11,932
We shouldn't have moved back in no matter how much they tried to convince me.

694
00:50:12,866 --> 00:50:14,832
You know.

695
00:50:14,832 --> 00:50:18,199
If we stay here longer, it will get strange.

696
00:50:18,199 --> 00:50:22,732
It'll get uncomfortable between people. We won't even be able to talk.

697
00:50:25,032 --> 00:50:34,032
Seung Jo...Well Oh Ha Ni was a really good lady.

698
00:50:34,032 --> 00:50:37,132
Making me really think about it,

699
00:50:37,132 --> 00:50:40,299
it was a good opportunity.

700
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,199
Yeah.

701
00:50:51,066 --> 00:50:55,352
There are many stars, right?

702
00:51:16,386 --> 00:51:18,116
Oh, Joon Gu!

703
00:51:20,782 --> 00:51:21,409
At the restaurant?

704
00:51:21,649 --> 00:51:25,416
I'm making a new menu
Can you come by after school?

705
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:29,749
If you say it tastes good, then I want to officially present it to the chef.

706
00:51:29,749 --> 00:51:31,749
You have to come, okay?

707
00:51:47,325 --> 00:51:48,749
These little punks... What are you doing?!

708
00:51:48,749 --> 00:51:50,516
Get up quickly! Move it!

709
00:51:50,516 --> 00:51:52,549
Sunbae, can we not rest for a while?

710
00:51:52,549 --> 00:51:54,049
What did you do so that you can rest?

711
00:51:54,049 --> 00:51:56,782
Training does not stop. Never stop!

712
00:52:01,716 --> 00:52:03,846
You're the same.

713
00:52:03,846 --> 00:52:06,416
Aigoo! Hey!

714
00:52:06,416 --> 00:52:08,716
Seung Jo! It's really been a long time!

715
00:52:08,716 --> 00:52:12,682
I've heard about your father. Is he alright now?

716
00:52:12,682 --> 00:52:14,316
Yes, he got through it.

717
00:52:14,316 --> 00:52:16,816
Oh! That's a relief!

718
00:52:16,816 --> 00:52:21,416
What to do about this? Since you don't come, the girls don't come as well.

719
00:52:21,416 --> 00:52:24,949
Look at this! It's full of men. Aigoo really.

720
00:52:24,949 --> 00:52:27,682
You came well. Since you're here, let's play a game.

721
00:52:27,682 --> 00:52:31,282
I came to clean out my locker today.

722
00:52:31,282 --> 00:52:32,982
I don't think I'll be able to come for a while.

723
00:52:32,982 --> 00:52:38,216
Something must be wrong with you. What kind of freshman is that busy?

724
00:52:40,681 --> 00:52:42,082
I don't see the ball boy today.

725
00:52:42,082 --> 00:52:43,529
Ball boy?

726
00:52:44,416 --> 00:52:46,216
Ahhh. Ha Ni?

727
00:52:46,216 --> 00:52:51,416
She's always skipping these days. She must be busy dating that guy who works in the cafeteria.

728
00:52:59,516 --> 00:53:02,682
Wow, oh. Practicing...

729
00:53:02,682 --> 00:53:05,516
Oh! Baek Seung Jo!

730
00:53:07,682 --> 00:53:09,816
Why are you here?

731
00:53:09,816 --> 00:53:11,449
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

732
00:53:11,449 --> 00:53:13,449
Ah.That's right.

733
00:53:14,582 --> 00:53:19,082
Anyway, we heard you're getting married.

734
00:53:19,082 --> 00:53:21,801
With Yoon Hae Ra?

735
00:53:27,416 --> 00:53:32,449
Today, isn't Ha Ni meeting up with Bong Joon Gu?

736
00:53:32,449 --> 00:53:36,416
Yeah! Bong Joon Gu is making something really yummy for her.

737
00:53:36,416 --> 00:53:39,616
Bong Joon Gu is so great!

738
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:44,316
I know! Who knew he'd even ask her to marry him?

739
00:53:48,842 --> 00:53:52,049
Is she responding today?

740
00:53:52,049 --> 00:53:56,616
Ah, that's right! That's why she dressed up so nicely.

741
00:53:57,882 --> 00:54:02,049
Then won't Ha Ni be the first one to get married?

742
00:54:02,049 --> 00:54:04,249
Ah I know!

743
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:20,354
So Pal Bok Noodles.

744
00:54:21,787 --> 00:54:24,021
Eat more of this.

745
00:54:31,654 --> 00:54:32,802
Ah, I'm full.

746
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:36,354
How can you be full already? I prepared a lot.

747
00:54:36,354 --> 00:54:38,087
Next time.

748
00:54:38,087 --> 00:54:40,186
But these are really delicious.

749
00:54:40,186 --> 00:54:42,621
Be sure to tell Dad. It'll be a jackpot.

750
00:54:42,621 --> 00:54:44,021
Is that so?

751
00:54:44,021 --> 00:54:47,854
Drink this. It's plum juice. You'll digest nicely.

752
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:52,505
Joon Gu, you're really great.

753
00:54:52,505 --> 00:54:54,345
It seems like your cooking skills have gotten better than my dad's.

754
00:54:54,345 --> 00:54:56,121
Aigoo what are you talking about?

755
00:54:56,121 --> 00:54:58,921
I still have a long way to go to be like Chef.

756
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:03,365
But since you're complimenting me, I do feel good.

757
00:55:03,365 --> 00:55:05,387
My heart is beating.

758
00:55:07,587 --> 00:55:09,521
It's raining really hard.

759
00:55:16,243 --> 00:55:17,487
Here...

760
00:55:18,587 --> 00:55:19,787
Ha Ni...

761
00:55:19,787 --> 00:55:20,984
Huh?

762
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:24,058
What I said last time...

763
00:55:24,711 --> 00:55:25,654
I didn't just say it.

764
00:55:28,889 --> 00:55:31,054
Have you thought about it?

765
00:55:33,758 --> 00:55:35,821
But... I...

766
00:55:35,821 --> 00:55:36,987
A little more ti...

767
00:55:36,987 --> 00:55:38,454
It still can't be?

768
00:55:39,687 --> 00:55:41,621
I'm talking about Seung Jo.

769
00:55:41,854 --> 00:55:47,021
He even went on a marriage meeting. You can't get rid of your feelings yet?

770
00:55:47,021 --> 00:55:49,608
No, more than that...

771
00:55:49,608 --> 00:55:51,221
Ha Ni...

772
00:55:51,221 --> 00:55:55,854
That cold and bad guy, what do you like so much about him?

773
00:55:57,087 --> 00:56:01,587
I told you last time. I'm a house.

774
00:56:02,321 --> 00:56:05,087
Whenever you come, I'll be always there.

775
00:56:05,087 --> 00:56:06,354
But

776
00:56:08,187 --> 00:56:11,487
if you let the house be empty for too long,

777
00:56:11,487 --> 00:56:13,554
you can't use it anymore.

778
00:56:14,021 --> 00:56:15,721
Joon Gu...

779
00:56:17,687 --> 00:56:18,787
Are you okay?

780
00:56:18,787 --> 00:56:20,521
Ha Ni, are you okay?

781
00:56:22,021 --> 00:56:26,387
Ha Ni, I really like you!

782
00:56:26,387 --> 00:56:27,187
Joon Gu...

783
00:56:27,187 --> 00:56:28,321
Ha Ni...

784
00:56:28,321 --> 00:56:29,154
Joon Gu, don't do this.

785
00:56:29,154 --> 00:56:30,654
Joon Gu!

786
00:56:34,154 --> 00:56:36,387
Don't be like this.

787
00:56:37,787 --> 00:56:38,487
No, don't do it.

788
00:56:38,487 --> 00:56:40,954
I told you not to do it! Joon Gu!

789
00:56:50,621 --> 00:56:52,621
I guess...

790
00:56:52,621 --> 00:56:55,487
that it can't be me.

791
00:56:55,487 --> 00:56:57,221
I'm sorry, Joon Gu.

792
00:57:31,796 --> 00:57:34,329
I really am no good.

793
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:37,052
After making Joon Gu that hopeful,

794
00:57:37,052 --> 00:57:39,535
he only ended up getting hurt.

795
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:45,502
What is this? Did I make it so that if it's not Baek Seung Jo, it can't be anyone?

796
00:57:59,596 --> 00:58:04,109
-What are you doing here?
-What do you mean? Isn't it obvious?

797
00:58:04,596 --> 00:58:06,229
There's no chance that you'd take an umbrella with you.

798
00:58:06,229 --> 00:58:10,263
Then, were you waiting for me?

799
00:58:24,094 --> 00:58:26,296
Are you coming from meeting that guy?

800
00:58:29,063 --> 00:58:30,896
Which answer did you give him?

801
00:58:31,405 --> 00:58:32,794
Huh?

802
00:58:33,529 --> 00:58:35,729
I heard he asked you to marry him.

803
00:58:36,129 --> 00:58:37,308
Why?

804
00:58:37,308 --> 00:58:39,133
I can't do that?

805
00:58:39,133 --> 00:58:41,596
That's why I ask, which answer you gave him.

806
00:58:42,063 --> 00:58:44,263
Whatever I said to him,

807
00:58:44,263 --> 00:58:46,229
it's none of your business.

808
00:58:48,363 --> 00:58:50,115
That's right.

809
00:58:52,963 --> 00:58:54,396
I...

810
00:58:55,509 --> 00:58:57,563
am going to move out.

811
00:58:58,696 --> 00:59:01,296
I've talked with my father about it.

812
00:59:02,263 --> 00:59:05,588
I'm going to get in your way.

813
00:59:09,763 --> 00:59:12,763
It's a relief that Joon Gu works so hard.

814
00:59:12,763 --> 00:59:15,196
My dad likes him a lot too.

815
00:59:15,196 --> 00:59:21,096
Now, I should help my father at his restaurant with Joon Gu.

816
00:59:22,829 --> 00:59:24,129
Do you like him?

817
00:59:24,129 --> 00:59:25,720
Bong Joon Gu?

818
00:59:27,202 --> 00:59:29,621
Of course I do.

819
00:59:29,929 --> 00:59:32,129
For 4 years, he only liked me.

820
00:59:32,129 --> 00:59:35,229
If someone says they like you, then you just like them like that too?

821
00:59:35,229 --> 00:59:36,563
Why?

822
00:59:36,563 --> 00:59:38,263
I can't do that?

823
00:59:38,263 --> 00:59:40,996
I'm tired of having a crush now.

824
00:59:42,267 --> 00:59:45,829
I want to see a guy that likes me. I like Joon Gu.

825
00:59:45,829 --> 00:59:47,663
You ...

826
00:59:47,663 --> 00:59:49,263
You like me.

827
00:59:53,229 --> 00:59:55,529
You can't like anyone but me.

828
00:59:58,429 --> 01:00:00,463
What is this, that confidence?

829
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:02,929
Am I not right?

830
01:00:02,929 --> 01:00:04,896
Yes, you are right!

831
01:00:05,029 --> 01:00:07,396
I only like you.

832
01:00:07,396 --> 01:00:09,296
So what am I supposed to do?

833
01:00:09,296 --> 01:00:13,163
You don't ever see me. Someone like me...

834
01:00:40,533 --> 01:00:44,466
Don't say that you like another guy.

835
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,900
That's the second one.

836
01:00:49,003 --> 01:00:50,768
Second what?

837
01:00:50,768 --> 01:00:52,433
Kiss.

838
01:00:53,866 --> 01:00:56,066
It's the third.

839
01:00:57,966 --> 01:00:59,900
It's fine.

840
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:03,466
you don't have to count those things.

841
01:01:05,266 --> 01:01:06,743
Okay.

842
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:33,466
There are actually results from having a crush for four years.

843
01:01:33,466 --> 01:01:34,155
Get in.

844
01:01:34,155 --> 01:01:36,200
You finally did it.

845
01:01:37,266 --> 01:01:41,000
Then what about Bong Joon Gu?

846
01:01:42,033 --> 01:01:47,200
You're faster than I thought. I knew that someday you'd find your true feelings.

847
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,614
But you're not having a hard time anymore?

848
01:01:48,614 --> 01:01:50,600
I'm not.

849
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,066
It became fun.

850
01:01:52,066 --> 01:01:55,048
Yoon Hae Ra, what's wrong with you?

851
01:01:58,166 --> 01:02:03,033
I wanted to call you "Father."

852
01:02:03,033 --> 01:02:06,300
I wanted to call you "Father-in-law."

853
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,766
Congratulations on your marriage.

854
01:02:10,466 --> 01:02:12,133
I'm sorry.
