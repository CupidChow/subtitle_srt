1
00:00:52,057 --> 00:00:53,378
What are you doing here?

2
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:10,667
I...am going to move out.

3
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,625
I'm going to get in your way.

4
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,752
It's a relief that Joon Gu works so hard.

5
00:01:23,067 --> 00:01:24,818
My dad likes him a lot too.

6
00:01:25,904 --> 00:01:31,366
Now, I should help my father at his restaurant with Joon Gu.

7
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:35,800
You like him?
Bong Joon Gu?

8
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,433
Of course I do.
He liked only me for 4 years.

9
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:45,616
If someone says they like you, then you just like them like that too?

10
00:01:45,616 --> 00:01:48,006
Why? I don't have the right too?

11
00:01:48,603 --> 00:01:51,118
I'm tired of having a crush now.

12
00:01:52,668 --> 00:01:56,235
I want to see a guy that likes me. I like Joon Gu.

13
00:01:56,235 --> 00:01:59,546
You... like me.

14
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:05,400
You can't like anyone but me.

15
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:10,267
What is this, that confidence?

16
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:11,110
Am I not right?

17
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:13,833
Yes, you're right!

18
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:16,667
I only like you.

19
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:22,800
So what am I supposed to do? You don't ever see me. Someone like me...

20
00:02:41,305 --> 00:02:45,100
Don't say that you like another guy.

21
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,333
That's the second one.

22
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:50,862
Second what?

23
00:02:52,095 --> 00:02:52,952
Kiss...

24
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,737
It's the third.

25
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,967
It's fine.

26
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:04,067
I'm not going to count any more.

27
00:03:06,267 --> 00:03:07,200
Okay.

28
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,967
It's still not that time. They're kids.

29
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:22,267
There is no need for that.

30
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:28,233
Just because there are marriage talks, doesn't mean anything is going to happen right away.

31
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:32,033
It will be uncomfortable, no, I'm the one who is uncomfortable.

32
00:03:32,033 --> 00:03:33,367
Gi Dong-shii !

33
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:37,302
Thanks for what you've done. Twice already...

34
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:39,926
I will definitely pay you back.

35
00:03:46,197 --> 00:03:47,333
Hyung!

36
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,967
Oh dear! What happened to you two?

37
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,333
You'll catch a cold. Hurry, go upstairs and get changed.

38
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:56,714
Yes.

39
00:03:58,667 --> 00:03:59,533
Hyung!

40
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,405
Oh Ha Ni is going to move out.

41
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,200
I have something to say.

42
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:15,500
To me?

43
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:17,800
Well, get changed first, then. . .

44
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,233
I . . . want to marry Oh Ha Ni.

45
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:22,667
What?

46
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:24,567
Seung Jo...

47
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:31,800
Of course, not right away, but after we graduate,
and Father's company is in a better state,

48
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:35,400
if you were to approve, Father.

49
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,067
A... are you being serious now?

50
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:42,867
Yes.

51
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,586
You already know, but our Ha Ni is not very good at anything.

52
00:04:50,586 --> 00:04:51,800
I know.

53
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,499
And she is not very bright.

54
00:04:53,499 --> 00:04:54,400
I know.

55
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,567
And she can't cook.

56
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:56,667
I know it well.

57
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:59,667
She's careless and accident prone.

58
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:00,967
The best.

59
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:03,933
Even so,

60
00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:11,433
she's bright and is very good about doing the right thing.

61
00:05:12,165 --> 00:05:14,276
She has a cute side to her.

62
00:05:14,276 --> 00:05:16,667
Yes. I know it very well.

63
00:05:20,942 --> 00:05:26,633
Well since Ha Ni likes you so much.

64
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:30,833
Ha Ni!

65
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,633
It really turned out well! This is great!

66
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:37,500
Hey Baek Seung Jo! Why are you so cool?

67
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:41,433
What to do?

68
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,967
Ha Ni!

69
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:48,367
I knew it would be like this.

70
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:11,100
You didn't go to sleep?

71
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,036
Yeah...

72
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:17,300
It stopped raining.

73
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,933
Oh...

74
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,067
Since it stopped raining, the sky seems clearer.

75
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:25,567
That's right.

76
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:27,767
You're not cold?

77
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm going to sleep first.

78
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,065
What?

79
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,333
What is it?

80
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,633
It's just that if you go to sleep like this, once it's morning,

81
00:06:54,233 --> 00:07:00,000
"What if you go back to being the cold Baek Seung Jo?"
That is what I was thinking.

82
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:02,367
Then, do you want us to sleep together tonight?

83
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:05,033
N... No. It's not like that.

84
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:08,700
Right. Let's just wait for a while.

85
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,733
I couldn't even imagine it,

86
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:20,833
that you would come to like me.

87
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:21,967
Me too.

88
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:28,767
I like you.

89
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:31,133
I like you very very much.

90
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:38,100
Mom, would you stop it?

91
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,967
Hey! Shh!

92
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:56,133
Don't be like this... Joon Gu...

93
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,700
Hey, don't.

94
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,467
I told you to not do this Joon Gu!

95
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:04,933
Why did I do that?!

96
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:09,967
If I come onto her all of a sudden like that, then her feelings for me will just drop.

97
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,967
Joon Gu, really, what is wrong with you?

98
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:53,600
You're not sleeping?

99
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:20,033
Ha Ni...

100
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,400
I did wrong yesterday.

101
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,833
Eat this and forgive me, okay?

102
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:50,100
Someone is already here?

103
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:02,833
Aigoo!

104
00:10:12,337 --> 00:10:13,920
Hey Joon Gu!

105
00:10:14,537 --> 00:10:16,170
Why are you here already?

106
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,170
Oh Chef, did you go to the morning market?

107
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,837
Yeah, that's right.

108
00:10:19,837 --> 00:10:21,503
But what is all of this? This early in the morning?

109
00:10:21,503 --> 00:10:23,270
Why are you packing a lunch?

110
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:26,637
Hey, there are even chicken wings.

111
00:10:26,637 --> 00:10:30,137
I was preparing it to give to Ha Ni.

112
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,403
Ha Ni?

113
00:10:31,403 --> 00:10:32,903
Ah, yes.

114
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:38,837
Actually, I ... to Ha Ni ...
It's nothing!

115
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:40,670
This is so fancy.

116
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,770
They've got titles to them too.

117
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:47,237
This is sweetened with honey so it's called "Oh Ha Ni."

118
00:10:47,237 --> 00:10:48,337
Oh. Ha. Ni.

119
00:10:48,337 --> 00:10:54,403
The focus of this one is the fried chicken wings so it's called, "Bong Joon Gu!"

120
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,137
Oh Ha Ni, Bong Joon Gu

121
00:10:59,137 --> 00:11:03,137
How about we make a Sok Pal Book Lunch box?

122
00:11:03,137 --> 00:11:05,570
Sok Pal Book Lunch box?

123
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,970
Ah, let me think about it.

124
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,103
Yes!

125
00:11:12,103 --> 00:11:16,037
Oh Ha Ni~ Bong Joon Gu~ !

126
00:11:16,037 --> 00:11:17,137
Done.

127
00:11:17,137 --> 00:11:20,270
What? Is this a joke?

128
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,003
It's the truth!

129
00:11:22,003 --> 00:11:24,810
He said it right in front of all of the adults!

130
00:11:25,703 --> 00:11:27,637
Baek Seung Jo?

131
00:11:27,637 --> 00:11:29,237
Not Bong Joon Gu?

132
00:11:29,237 --> 00:11:31,003
Yeah.

133
00:11:31,003 --> 00:11:34,370
Why? Why does he want to marry you suddenly?

134
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,970
I'm not sure. Maybe he finally realized my feelings.

135
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:42,503
He found out it was love. A story like that.

136
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:44,103
Then are you going to get married right away?

137
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,970
It's still far away
Not before we graduate.

138
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,503
Wow, Oh Ha Ni, that's great!

139
00:11:48,503 --> 00:11:51,203
Hey! I want to make you my life's mentor!

140
00:11:51,203 --> 00:11:52,637
What's wrong with you!

141
00:11:52,637 --> 00:11:57,203
Anyway, Congratulations
The crush you had for 4 years is finally paying off!

142
00:11:57,203 --> 00:11:59,570
So you finally did it!

143
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,770
Congrats!

144
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,770
Thanks.

145
00:12:04,203 --> 00:12:05,737
You like it that much?!

146
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,337
Yeah, she's loving it!

147
00:12:08,337 --> 00:12:13,470
Ah, then... what about Bong Joon Gu?

148
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,637
Ah, right. And Yoon Hae Ra...?

149
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:19,637
Seung Jo said he's gonna tell Hae Ra.

150
00:12:19,637 --> 00:12:22,370
And I have to tell Joon Gu.

151
00:12:39,837 --> 00:12:42,370
Oh Ha Ni?

152
00:12:47,503 --> 00:12:51,270
Oh Ha Ni / Baek Seung Jo
After 4 years of passionate love, finally the engagement.

153
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,203
I wonder who confessed first?
It must be Oh Ha Ni.

154
00:13:18,403 --> 00:13:20,770
It came faster than I thought

155
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:28,770
I knew that someday you would figure out your true feelings, but

156
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,003
this day came sooner than I thought.

157
00:13:32,403 --> 00:13:34,937
I didn't know either that this was going to happen.

158
00:13:36,503 --> 00:13:38,470
Did you know?

159
00:13:39,203 --> 00:13:42,870
Your mother knew too, didn't she?

160
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:47,537
Oh Ha Ni was really difficult.

161
00:13:47,537 --> 00:13:50,970
It was like solving a problem with no answer.

162
00:13:52,103 --> 00:13:53,570
That's why it was so hard.

163
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,603
But you didn't want to admit that, right?

164
00:13:56,603 --> 00:14:02,303
That Baek Seung Jo had a problem that, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't find an answer to.

165
00:14:03,137 --> 00:14:05,803
How come you know me so well?

166
00:14:07,437 --> 00:14:09,670
But now it isn't hard anymore?

167
00:14:11,537 --> 00:14:15,070
It was hard when I was trying not to be shaken by those feelings

168
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,437
But when I admitted, "I've completely given up to this kid."

169
00:14:18,437 --> 00:14:21,570
Once I surrendered to that, it's not hard any more.

170
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,403
Now it's fun.

171
00:14:23,637 --> 00:14:27,803
Hey! You came to apologize, but aren't you just bragging too much?

172
00:14:27,803 --> 00:14:29,903
Is that so?

173
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:34,137
Okay. I'm sincerely apologizing.

174
00:14:35,803 --> 00:14:40,437
But I wasn't joking around.

175
00:14:40,437 --> 00:14:43,203
I really thought we two would match well.

176
00:14:43,837 --> 00:14:47,137
When I was with you, I was really comfortable.

177
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:53,203
You were running away from Oh Ha Ni and finding comfort in me right?

178
00:14:53,203 --> 00:14:54,837
I'm sorry.

179
00:14:54,837 --> 00:14:57,237
You're not saying you weren't.

180
00:14:57,237 --> 00:14:59,470
But what to do?

181
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:04,170
"I'm fine." I can't say that.

182
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,370
Scared?

183
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:12,803
Okay. I've accepted it.

184
00:15:13,403 --> 00:15:14,570
Congratutlations on your marriage.

185
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,503
It's still far away!

186
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,470
I'm congratulating you early then.

187
00:15:23,703 --> 00:15:25,137
Okay.

188
00:15:25,437 --> 00:15:29,370
What is this? I'm trying to throw away my feelings.

189
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,703
Why is your hand so warm?

190
00:15:31,703 --> 00:15:35,003
You're really a nice girl.

191
00:15:35,003 --> 00:15:36,403
I know.

192
00:15:58,703 --> 00:16:00,737
Joon Gu, let's eat.

193
00:16:01,803 --> 00:16:03,837
I don't feel like it. Go ahead.

194
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:07,337
Does a person working in the cafeteria bother to think about eating?

195
00:16:07,337 --> 00:16:10,303
While we're not busy we have to eat and clean up. Hurry and come.

196
00:16:11,703 --> 00:16:13,770
Oh, what's that?

197
00:16:14,337 --> 00:16:16,437
It looks like a lunch box.

198
00:16:16,437 --> 00:16:20,737
Is he saying he doesn't feel like it since he brought his lunch?

199
00:17:40,037 --> 00:17:43,437
I should have told him in person first.

200
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,137
I left after what happened last night too.

201
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:51,570
Did Seung Jo tell her yet?

202
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:56,270
It seemed like Hae Ra really liked Seung Jo a lot, too.

203
00:17:56,937 --> 00:18:00,140
That's probably why she was like that to me.

204
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:05,770
Why is dating so difficult?

205
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,903
"Oh Ha Ni, Baek Seung Jo"?!

206
00:18:07,903 --> 00:18:11,170
"After 4 years of passionate love, finally the engagement"?!

207
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,803
What does this Oh Ha Ni look like?!

208
00:18:13,803 --> 00:18:16,837
What does she look like that she was able to accomplish this feat?!

209
00:18:16,837 --> 00:18:21,137
That's freaking amazing!

210
00:18:21,137 --> 00:18:24,137
But she's so ugly, she's really ugly!

211
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,070
I like you.

212
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,603
Let's just take a chance,

213
00:18:52,603 --> 00:18:54,637
on each other.

214
00:18:54,637 --> 00:18:59,337
Let's... start.

215
00:19:09,203 --> 00:19:12,903
You're a really fine woman.

216
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,600
Where are the beverages?

217
00:20:11,157 --> 00:20:12,736
Ah, yeah.

218
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:18,131
She must be really thirsty.

219
00:20:18,131 --> 00:20:21,606
I have to know what she likes so that I can buy it.
Water?

220
00:20:21,606 --> 00:20:24,486
No, not water. It's not cold!

221
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:27,372
Oh this is cold, this is cold!

222
00:20:27,372 --> 00:20:31,050
I don't even know if she likes that.

223
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,915
A drink like this?!

224
00:20:34,092 --> 00:20:38,487
Just because she was exercising doesn't mean I can give her a sports drink!
Coke, Coke, Coke!

225
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,461
Ah, right, Diet Coke.

226
00:20:40,461 --> 00:20:42,265
That would imply that she has to lose weight.

227
00:20:42,265 --> 00:20:45,871
There's nothing for her to lose! What should I buy?

228
00:20:47,054 --> 00:20:48,906
Excuse me!

229
00:20:48,906 --> 00:20:51,955
When you're really thirsty, what do you like to drink?

230
00:21:36,623 --> 00:21:40,020
Yoon Hae Ra, why are you like this, really?

231
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,739
Are you okay?

232
00:21:46,422 --> 00:21:48,287
Beer?

233
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:52,234
It was cool, earlier on...

234
00:22:00,254 --> 00:22:01,824
Fine.

235
00:22:01,824 --> 00:22:04,378
I'm thirsty.

236
00:22:22,304 --> 00:22:25,996
Why won't this open!

237
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:29,363
Should I open it up for you?

238
00:22:29,363 --> 00:22:31,685
It's fine.

239
00:22:38,072 --> 00:22:42,923
Ah. It's really annoying.

240
00:22:46,035 --> 00:22:48,937
It's okay if you sob,

241
00:22:48,937 --> 00:22:50,679
I'm okay with it.

242
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:52,815
Don't hold it back.

243
00:24:08,033 --> 00:24:09,951
Ha Ni, I really

244
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:13,342
wanted to do this together with you.

245
00:24:23,091 --> 00:24:25,973
You are my life's

246
00:24:25,973 --> 00:24:28,945
navigation system

247
00:24:32,087 --> 00:24:35,192
You guide me through

248
00:24:35,192 --> 00:24:37,142
the paths I have to..

249
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,603
to take.

250
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,112
Yes, Chef!

251
00:25:09,112 --> 00:25:11,236
I'm out for some fresh air now .

252
00:25:11,236 --> 00:25:14,294
Yes, I understand. I'll be coming back now.

253
00:25:51,121 --> 00:25:54,179
Make sure to clean up nicely before you go in.

254
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:58,458
I understand
-Good job today
- Good job today.

255
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:00,548
Great job.

256
00:26:55,931 --> 00:26:57,360
You came!

257
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,962
Good thing you came.

258
00:26:58,962 --> 00:27:02,956
Chef left his wallet. Where was it...Oh here it is.

259
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:04,605
Here.

260
00:27:06,795 --> 00:27:09,690
Wallet?

261
00:27:19,698 --> 00:27:23,576
The colour is pretty. What is it?

262
00:27:24,755 --> 00:27:28,900
Chlorella.

263
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,099
Joon Gu, I ...

264
00:27:32,756 --> 00:27:33,689
I have something to say.

265
00:27:33,689 --> 00:27:34,993
I'm sorry, but

266
00:27:34,993 --> 00:27:36,579
today you have to go home.

267
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:41,060
I'm really busy.

268
00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:59,543
Bong Joon Gu. Let's have a talk.

269
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:02,128
You must be kidding.

270
00:28:02,128 --> 00:28:04,234
What do I have to talk with you about?

271
00:28:04,605 --> 00:28:05,527
Just go.

272
00:28:05,527 --> 00:28:07,020
Then I'll say it right here.

273
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,576
I...

274
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,316
like Oh Ha Ni.

275
00:28:14,433 --> 00:28:17,892
We don't need your permission to date, but

276
00:28:18,468 --> 00:28:21,245
it's important for Ha Ni.

277
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:24,426
It would be good if you let it go.

278
00:28:24,426 --> 00:28:26,418
If you let her go, everything will be fine.

279
00:28:26,418 --> 00:28:28,011
Hey!

280
00:28:28,011 --> 00:28:29,636
That's something stupid to say.

281
00:28:29,636 --> 00:28:31,069
Let go... let go of what?

282
00:28:31,069 --> 00:28:32,469
Hey Baek Seung Jo.

283
00:28:32,469 --> 00:28:35,093
All this time you've been so mean to Ha Ni.

284
00:28:35,093 --> 00:28:36,579
Now what are you trying to say?

285
00:28:36,579 --> 00:28:38,390
It seems like you don't know,

286
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,830
but for 4 years, I liked Ha Ni.

287
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,502
Joon Gu.

288
00:28:44,544 --> 00:28:46,378
I'm sorry.

289
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:51,920
Why are you sorry?

290
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,994
Of course I'm sorry

291
00:28:54,587 --> 00:28:56,827
and thankful.

292
00:28:59,142 --> 00:29:00,535
But I really...

293
00:29:00,535 --> 00:29:02,307
It's fine.

294
00:29:03,259 --> 00:29:06,211
Don't say it.

295
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,808
I already know.

296
00:29:07,808 --> 00:29:09,575
I already saw it.

297
00:29:12,725 --> 00:29:14,397
Ah Oh Ha Ni, really...

298
00:29:14,397 --> 00:29:16,950
You really have no taste in guys.

299
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,884
Later,even if you regret it,

300
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:22,483
I'm not going to give in.

301
00:29:22,483 --> 00:29:25,652
Will you be okay with that?

302
00:29:25,652 --> 00:29:29,962
See? You can't even respond quickly enough.

303
00:29:29,962 --> 00:29:31,478
Baek Seung Jo.

304
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,020
What are you going to do?

305
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,583
Ha Ni isn't able to respond.

306
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:36,208
Yeah.

307
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,251
I'm getting nervous.

308
00:29:41,177 --> 00:29:43,035
Seung Jo.

309
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:48,600
Just know that I'm always going to be watching you.

310
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,700
If you make tears come out of Ha Ni's eyes,

311
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,700
I'll make bloody tears come out of your eyes.

312
00:29:56,087 --> 00:29:59,103
I'll keep that in mind.

313
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,238
Something to eat while you drink.

314
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,047
Chef...

315
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,280
Yes, Joon Gu?

316
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,079
You know, I ...

317
00:31:31,947 --> 00:31:36,480
wanted to call you Father.

318
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:43,080
I truly wanted to call you "Father-in-law."

319
00:31:43,813 --> 00:31:46,247
My father-in-law.

320
00:32:10,047 --> 00:32:13,613
I'm really sorry about what happened with your grand daughter.

321
00:32:13,613 --> 00:32:16,413
It's all my fault.

322
00:32:16,413 --> 00:32:23,847
Collapsing and all. Seung Jo may be reliable, but he's still very young.

323
00:32:23,847 --> 00:32:24,913
He's not ...

324
00:32:24,913 --> 00:32:28,057
You don't need to beat around the bush.

325
00:32:28,057 --> 00:32:33,813
My investment was on the line, and since that all happened, my investment is no longer there.

326
00:32:33,813 --> 00:32:34,613
It's simple.

327
00:32:34,613 --> 00:32:40,344
But still... the game is almost complete and you really enjoyed it...

328
00:32:40,344 --> 00:32:44,013
I'm not that great of a person.

329
00:32:44,013 --> 00:32:46,613
I can't separate how I feel and what I'm supposed to do!

330
00:32:47,847 --> 00:32:50,884
Since there was interest, the game is probably liked.

331
00:32:59,447 --> 00:33:00,847
Seung Jo!

332
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:05,647
Did you come to witness the punishment for yourself?

333
00:33:05,647 --> 00:33:10,747
No. I settled the matter with your granddaughter myself.

334
00:33:10,747 --> 00:33:13,313
Today, I came to talk about business.

335
00:33:13,313 --> 00:33:14,280
Seung Jo.

336
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:14,947
What?!

337
00:33:14,947 --> 00:33:21,447
Saying sorry for what happened, I don't think Hae Ra would want that.

338
00:33:21,447 --> 00:33:25,747
For whatever reason, putting herself in a hurtful position...

339
00:33:25,747 --> 00:33:28,913
a position to accept an apology, I don't think she'd like it.

340
00:33:28,913 --> 00:33:30,780
I have a similar personality so I know her quite well.

341
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:36,547
So? You're not going to apologize for Hae Ra but you still want me to invest?

342
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:37,713
Yes.

343
00:33:37,713 --> 00:33:38,713
Seung Jo!

344
00:33:38,713 --> 00:33:41,213
Please invest,

345
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:45,880
but you don't necessarily need to invest in our company.

346
00:33:46,554 --> 00:33:50,387
Our game, we can pass it on to a different company,

347
00:33:50,387 --> 00:33:55,513
or your company can service it completely.

348
00:33:55,513 --> 00:34:00,313
Wherever it may be, please allow us to have game service.

349
00:34:01,547 --> 00:34:08,347
For the last 2 months our employees have worked day and night, even forgoing their paychecks.

350
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:10,454
They worked very hard,

351
00:34:10,454 --> 00:34:14,247
and the results came out nicely.

352
00:34:14,987 --> 00:34:20,080
It's fine if you throw out our company, but please at least allow this game to see the spotlight,

353
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:25,947
and please save our developers.

354
00:34:25,947 --> 00:34:29,647
To give up on those below me because you dislike me...

355
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:31,147
It's childish?

356
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,980
You're teaching me right now, aren't you?

357
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,980
It's not that.

358
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:39,047
Baek Seung Jo! I don't like you.

359
00:34:39,047 --> 00:34:39,747
I'm very sorry.

360
00:34:39,747 --> 00:34:41,287
You should at least plead for something.

361
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:44,680
Invest in us or it's the end for us.

362
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,521
I did wrong with Hae Ra. Please forgive me.

363
00:34:47,521 --> 00:34:49,047
You need to plead like that, rascal.

364
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:53,280
That way I'll waver and sign the contract.

365
00:34:55,947 --> 00:34:57,913
Idiot.

366
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,880
Yes, President?

367
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,280
Bring the stamp (used to sign contracts).

368
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,813
Thank you very much.

369
00:35:03,813 --> 00:35:06,523
You can't mooch off my money.

370
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:07,723
Pay me back multiples.

371
00:35:08,045 --> 00:35:09,738
Yes, I'll do that.

372
00:35:11,362 --> 00:35:12,462
Thank you.

373
00:35:12,462 --> 00:35:13,696
Thank you.

374
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,143
So the launch is next week?

375
00:35:16,343 --> 00:35:16,729
Yes.

376
00:35:17,172 --> 00:35:19,262
As long as there are no problems.

377
00:35:19,762 --> 00:35:21,977
Seung Jo you're amazing.

378
00:35:22,462 --> 00:35:26,496
I'm really indebted to you this time.

379
00:35:27,273 --> 00:35:28,729
I was very surprised.

380
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:31,009
Made me wonder whether you are really my son.

381
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:31,938
You're cool.

382
00:35:34,829 --> 00:35:37,729
But you can't brag in front of me.

383
00:35:38,665 --> 00:35:40,929
Do you think I've been through this only once or twice?

384
00:35:40,929 --> 00:35:42,829
Yes, it must have been like that.

385
00:35:42,996 --> 00:35:46,429
Yes that's why you should quit now.

386
00:35:48,362 --> 00:35:51,605
You did enough so you can stop.

387
00:35:51,996 --> 00:35:54,299
It's time for you to pick a major for next year.

388
00:35:55,462 --> 00:35:56,896
You have to go to med school.

389
00:36:00,296 --> 00:36:04,029
But there's no guarantee that this game will be successful.

390
00:36:04,348 --> 00:36:08,062
Then we'll just be in debt. And your health...

391
00:36:08,062 --> 00:36:10,062
I just told you not to brag!

392
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:17,196
I'm fairly famous in the gaming industry within our country! Don't you try to overstep me!

393
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:20,096
Seung Jo, don't you dare steal my place.

394
00:36:20,396 --> 00:36:24,262
I'm going to do this for the next 20 years.

395
00:36:24,262 --> 00:36:25,896
20 years?

396
00:36:26,529 --> 00:36:27,796
And after that?

397
00:36:28,096 --> 00:36:29,596
I'm here!

398
00:36:30,696 --> 00:36:34,529
I'm better at gaming than my brother.

399
00:36:34,962 --> 00:36:39,062
He doesn't like games, and he doesn't like them.

400
00:36:40,362 --> 00:36:45,162
If I work hard from now on, I can become a great heir.

401
00:36:46,429 --> 00:36:51,962
So, Seung jo, become a doctor. Become a doctor and help NoRi.

402
00:36:52,396 --> 00:36:54,629
No Ri is sick again.

403
00:36:56,096 --> 00:37:00,963
I saved this nearly collapsing company, but seems I've been instantly kicked out.

404
00:37:01,696 --> 00:37:06,896
Yes, as soon as this new game launches, let's shoot him off to med school!

405
00:37:10,262 --> 00:37:17,529
The game we are launching this month is a new MMORPG with realistic visual action aspects to it.

406
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:23,262
We will be implementing real time play within the existing market, which will make a big impact and change the way games are played.

407
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:28,829
It's a taste of a game that none other possesses with focus on animation like graphics.

408
00:37:29,562 --> 00:37:30,996
Then,

409
00:37:30,996 --> 00:37:32,496
we'll start now.

410
00:37:33,496 --> 00:37:40,962
These days online games are exported just as much as cars, maybe more,
and therefore quality has gone down causing concern.

411
00:37:40,962 --> 00:37:45,262
But a new game was released that could be the new face of this declining industry.

412
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:51,462
Within this gaming industry that's filled with games that require boring time commitments
and nothing more than extravagant graphics..

413
00:37:51,462 --> 00:37:57,162
We have created a fun animation game that is easy to enjoy.

414
00:37:57,829 --> 00:37:59,229
As expected!

415
00:38:00,496 --> 00:38:02,429
Isn't he fine, Grandfather?

416
00:38:02,862 --> 00:38:05,496
Yeah. He is desirable.

417
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:09,362
Of course! Would I have liked a trivial person?

418
00:38:11,517 --> 00:38:13,262
It's in past tense.

419
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:17,729
Then, have you cleared up your feelings?

420
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,329
You were really upset over it.

421
00:38:20,262 --> 00:38:23,662
Seeing him again, I'm getting greedy again.

422
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:26,796
Ah, how tiring.

423
00:38:27,196 --> 00:38:30,062
Joon Gu, it's a favor.

424
00:38:33,196 --> 00:38:35,529
Joon Gu, hurry with the dishes...

425
00:38:35,529 --> 00:38:38,729
Cut up some scallions, and cook some more noodles.

426
00:38:38,729 --> 00:38:39,862
Yes, I understand.

427
00:38:43,296 --> 00:38:47,929
Right Baek Seung Jo. Let's try our best.

428
00:38:48,529 --> 00:38:51,762
You can enjoy all aspects of action with our game.

429
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:55,962
Hey, you being around motivates me even more.

430
00:38:56,396 --> 00:38:59,962
Just wait and see. I'll become a great person too.

431
00:39:04,873 --> 00:39:08,873
On the Internet, the feedback from the game is explosive.

432
00:39:09,407 --> 00:39:13,807
Even if he is my son, Seung Jo is really amazing.

433
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,340
Ha Ni, I saw the webtoon Min Ah put on the Internet.
It was so funny.

434
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,940
Isn't it? Lately that webtoon has been really popular.

435
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,240
I think in good time she should be amongst some of the most popular cartoonists.

436
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,373
That's great.

437
00:39:27,373 --> 00:39:29,973
I know. I'm so happy for her.

438
00:39:29,973 --> 00:39:33,940
I see because she's so talented she's already making a name for herself.

439
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:39,140
I hear getting a job for university grads is real hard these days so they're interviewing like crazy. Good for her.

440
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:43,673
Despite these hard times I hear there are tons of students that don't give a care in the world.

441
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:45,373
That friend of yours must be working really hard.

442
00:39:45,373 --> 00:39:47,407
Yes, they're working hard

443
00:39:47,773 --> 00:39:52,140
That doesn't "care for a thing" student, we have one at our house too.

444
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,540
You...again!

445
00:39:55,012 --> 00:39:57,240
Oh, Ha Ni, something came from the school for you

446
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,073
Eun Jo, give me that thing on the very top over there.

447
00:40:03,907 --> 00:40:04,571
Here.

448
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:05,807
Yes.

449
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,211
What is it?

450
00:40:14,007 --> 00:40:15,441
What is it?

451
00:40:19,707 --> 00:40:21,373
Report card...

452
00:40:21,373 --> 00:40:22,473
Huh?

453
00:40:23,073 --> 00:40:25,307
It's probably obvious.

454
00:40:41,262 --> 00:40:43,540
What do I do!?

455
00:40:51,273 --> 00:40:58,730
I calculated my credits and was reassured. I thought it was okay.

456
00:40:59,807 --> 00:41:01,140
I don't have enough credits.

457
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,340
Then the credits on there were probably calculated incorrectly.

458
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,621
Huh?

459
00:41:04,821 --> 00:41:07,090
It seems like it.

460
00:41:07,873 --> 00:41:09,007
What do I do?

461
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:13,439
If you don't have enough credits, then you have to push through again.

462
00:41:13,439 --> 00:41:16,207
There's no use in coming to me and crying.

463
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:21,040
You caused these results by yourself, so you're the only one that can take care of this.

464
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,373
Yes.

465
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,040
I know that much.

466
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,540
Then, it is fine.

467
00:41:26,173 --> 00:41:27,918
Excuse me...

468
00:41:29,773 --> 00:41:33,807
I think I'm just no good at studying

469
00:41:34,607 --> 00:41:37,807
Should I just give up school?

470
00:41:38,473 --> 00:41:41,507
I tried on my own.

471
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,740
It seems like my grades aren't going up.

472
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:50,173
Because if you do that then you could spend a bit more time following me around?

473
00:41:50,807 --> 00:41:52,240
It's not exactly like that.

474
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,873
What about when everyone around you was studying like crazy to get good grades so they could get a job?

475
00:41:57,873 --> 00:41:59,340
What were you doing?

476
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:03,040
Have you thought about your future career?

477
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,540
You don't think things through enough and that's why your calculations are wrong,

478
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:10,040
and your credits don't add up.

479
00:42:11,107 --> 00:42:12,507
Baek Seung Jo!

480
00:42:12,507 --> 00:42:15,140
Am I wrong?

481
00:42:15,982 --> 00:42:17,940
You don't know my feelings.

482
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,515
You're good at everything without even trying whether it's grades or sports.

483
00:42:20,515 --> 00:42:22,940
You're popular with girls

484
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,840
Baek Seung Jo, you don't understand others' struggles.

485
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,573
Someone like you can't understand my feelings.

486
00:42:29,573 --> 00:42:32,473
If you didn't have perseverance what would be left of you?

487
00:42:33,807 --> 00:42:35,807
Then you...

488
00:42:35,807 --> 00:42:37,973
don't have any charm.

489
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,940
You were this cold of a person,

490
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,973
Baek Seung Jo.

491
00:42:50,615 --> 00:42:51,988
Where are you going?

492
00:42:51,988 --> 00:42:53,215
Wherever

493
00:42:54,203 --> 00:42:56,415
Is there even a place for you to go this late at night?

494
00:43:01,048 --> 00:43:02,548
I have.

495
00:43:02,548 --> 00:43:04,520
I might just go to a different guy!

496
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,815
So you have that kind of courage?

497
00:43:06,815 --> 00:43:08,948
Bong Joong Gu or...

498
00:43:08,948 --> 00:43:10,332
Kyung Su sunbae?

499
00:43:10,332 --> 00:43:14,048
Even if you regret it later, I won't care.

500
00:43:14,048 --> 00:43:15,915
Do as you wish.

501
00:43:31,281 --> 00:43:33,848
You are too much Baek Seung Jo!

502
00:43:34,048 --> 00:43:37,515
I'm already upset because of my credits,

503
00:43:37,515 --> 00:43:39,848
and you stepped all over that.

504
00:43:40,181 --> 00:43:43,215
As happy as I am, I still get hurt too.

505
00:43:43,215 --> 00:43:47,515
All I wanted was for you to comfort me a bit.

506
00:43:47,515 --> 00:43:49,675
Cold blooded Baek Seung Jo!

507
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,500
What did you say to Ha Ni?

508
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,400
She's the kind of girl who didn't give up,
even when you were so mean to her.

509
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,700
Tell me. What did you say to her?

510
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,400
What could you have said to make her leave?

511
00:44:03,445 --> 00:44:05,942
She probably went to her friends.

512
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:08,464
Besides, I didn't say much.

513
00:44:08,464 --> 00:44:13,142
I just gave her some motivation because it seemed like she was given an academic warning.

514
00:44:13,142 --> 00:44:16,342
You really. I thought you were doing well.

515
00:44:16,342 --> 00:44:17,245
Why are you like that again?

516
00:44:17,245 --> 00:44:19,117
This is a good chance.

517
00:44:19,117 --> 00:44:25,309
She needs to be apart from me a little, so that she can think for herself.

518
00:44:39,707 --> 00:44:41,458
Joo Ri!

519
00:44:42,042 --> 00:44:45,109
Oh!
Ha Ni!

520
00:44:45,309 --> 00:44:47,620
Why are you here at this time?

521
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,042
I . . .

522
00:44:49,862 --> 00:44:51,742
left the house.

523
00:44:51,742 --> 00:44:52,709
What?

524
00:44:52,709 --> 00:44:53,809
Yah!

525
00:44:55,209 --> 00:44:57,342
You failed one of your classes, didn't you?

526
00:44:59,452 --> 00:45:02,342
So you fought with Baek Seung Jo?

527
00:45:02,342 --> 00:45:03,409
Lovers' quarrel?

528
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:06,009
Hey! I'm not in the mood for joking!

529
00:45:06,009 --> 00:45:10,775
Even if you're really mad, who would just leave the house like that?

530
00:45:11,983 --> 00:45:14,042
He'll probably come get her.

531
00:45:14,609 --> 00:45:15,580
Really?

532
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:19,142
I don't know
It's been a long time we had such good beer, let's drink up!

533
00:45:19,142 --> 00:45:21,642
Right! Drink up!!

534
00:45:28,609 --> 00:45:32,242
Don't worry and just drink. You can spend the night at my place.

535
00:45:32,242 --> 00:45:33,981
Thank you.

536
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:48,709
Did Seung Jo already go to sleep?

537
00:45:50,775 --> 00:45:53,375
No, that is not possible.

538
00:45:54,075 --> 00:45:59,059
Because I left like that, he must be worried and not able to sleep.

539
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:02,109
Would he come looking for me?

540
00:46:04,109 --> 00:46:08,509
Should I send him a message to let him know at least where I am?

541
00:46:09,109 --> 00:46:13,575
No matter how, it seems like I overreacted

542
00:46:13,575 --> 00:46:16,275
saying I'll go to another man.

543
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:21,075
He'll come to get me tomorrow, right?

544
00:46:21,493 --> 00:46:23,826
He's probably reflecting, right?

545
00:46:27,226 --> 00:46:29,626
Baek Seung Jo,

546
00:46:29,626 --> 00:46:32,659
I'm lonely without you.

547
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:34,793
It's upsetting but . . .

548
00:46:35,513 --> 00:46:38,420
I miss you, Seung Jo!

549
00:46:47,193 --> 00:46:50,681
Oh Ha Ni, it looks like you didn't sleep well.

550
00:46:50,681 --> 00:46:54,793
If you miss Seung Jo, just go back home.

551
00:46:54,793 --> 00:46:57,508
I can't give in first now that I've come this far.

552
00:46:57,508 --> 00:47:03,926
It's a good chance to make Seung Jo realize how large my presence was.

553
00:47:03,926 --> 00:47:06,475
I can't keep on being the only one saying I like him.

554
00:47:06,475 --> 00:47:10,126
Aigoo, Oh Ha Ni! Only now did you return to your senses?

555
00:47:10,433 --> 00:47:13,494
I have to go now. I'll be late.

556
00:47:13,494 --> 00:47:14,432
Bye!

557
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:15,226
Fighting!
Work hard.

558
00:47:15,226 --> 00:47:16,759
Call me.

559
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,326
Bye!

560
00:47:24,813 --> 00:47:26,521
Right, you thought well.

561
00:47:26,521 --> 00:47:29,559
You should be able to do that too.

562
00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:34,826
But how is Seung Jo doing?

563
00:47:36,759 --> 00:47:41,026
Should I take a small look from afar?

564
00:47:41,575 --> 00:47:42,959
Oh Ha Ni!

565
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:45,493
Why? It's fun!

566
00:47:45,493 --> 00:47:49,693
To see Baek Seung Jo's struggling face because he misses me.

567
00:47:49,693 --> 00:47:51,859
Let's go, okay?

568
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:57,826
He's over there.

569
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,400
He looks like he's having fun.

570
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:16,000
He's not struggling at all.

571
00:48:17,193 --> 00:48:20,093
I'm definitely not going back home!

572
00:48:20,526 --> 00:48:22,493
Never ever!

573
00:48:25,293 --> 00:48:28,159
Are you sighing again?

574
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:31,793
Ha Ni left yesterday and hasn't called.

575
00:48:32,793 --> 00:48:34,059
I am back!

576
00:48:34,059 --> 00:48:35,793
Oh, you're here early!

577
00:48:35,793 --> 00:48:37,793
What about Ha Ni? Did you find her?

578
00:48:37,793 --> 00:48:39,159
No.

579
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:43,726
How about putting an end to this and bringing her back home?

580
00:48:44,259 --> 00:48:47,826
Ha Ni is also just being stubborn right now.

581
00:48:47,826 --> 00:48:52,426
She wants to come back but hasn't had the chance, so she's having a hard time.

582
00:48:52,426 --> 00:48:55,580
You don't even know that?

583
00:48:58,426 --> 00:49:01,259
How can someone be that cold?

584
00:49:02,026 --> 00:49:05,259
Oh poor Ha Ni!

585
00:49:05,626 --> 00:49:08,259
Ah let's just leave them.

586
00:49:08,259 --> 00:49:11,359
After all, it's something that concerns only them.

587
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:15,626
Won't something good come out of Ha Ni being apart for a little while?

588
00:49:15,626 --> 00:49:19,193
If Gi Dong shi says that too, then what are we going to do?

589
00:49:21,726 --> 00:49:23,593
Ha Ni!

590
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:27,959
She's only been gone one day and I miss her this much.

591
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:34,793
I'm sorry. My family came all of a sudden. You're going home, right?

592
00:49:34,793 --> 00:49:36,626
Huh?

593
00:49:37,326 --> 00:49:39,493
Don't be like that and just go back home.

594
00:49:39,493 --> 00:49:45,059
He might have been a little harsh, but I think he said all that for your own good.

595
00:49:45,759 --> 00:49:47,693
Go home.

596
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:48,759
Okay.

597
00:49:48,759 --> 00:49:50,726
You go back in first.

598
00:49:50,726 --> 00:49:53,326
I am sorry Ha Ni. Cheer up!

599
00:49:53,326 --> 00:49:54,659
Yes.

600
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,359
I'm going.

601
00:50:02,126 --> 00:50:05,093
Go back in first. They're waiting for you.

602
00:50:05,093 --> 00:50:06,159
Huh?

603
00:50:10,093 --> 00:50:11,959
I'm going. Go back home.

604
00:50:11,959 --> 00:50:13,493
Ok.

605
00:50:32,026 --> 00:50:34,093
Where I am going to go now?

606
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,626
Bad Beak Seung Jo!

607
00:50:38,693 --> 00:50:41,093
He's not even worried!

608
00:50:41,093 --> 00:50:43,559
How could he not even call?

609
00:51:33,773 --> 00:51:37,073
Come to our club! We will escort you.

610
00:51:37,073 --> 00:51:37,507
I ...

611
00:51:37,507 --> 00:51:41,140
It's really great.

612
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:04,807
Where are you going in the middle of the night?

613
00:52:04,807 --> 00:52:08,340
Since you're not looking for her, the least I can do is to go out and look for her myself.

614
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:10,540
I'm worried too,

615
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:16,307
but since it's happened, you should leave her to solve this herself.

616
00:52:16,307 --> 00:52:19,973
For Ha Ni's sake, it's a good thing

617
00:52:20,573 --> 00:52:22,640
I understand.

618
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,240
But you... do you know...?

619
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:32,807
A person's feelings don't have one answer like a math problem.

620
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:37,407
What the right answer is...I don't know either.

621
00:53:01,707 --> 00:53:11,307
Seung Jo’s words are right… I always depend on others. I’ve never thought about myself
or done anything for my future.

622
00:53:14,173 --> 00:53:17,007
I still can't go back.

623
00:53:17,007 --> 00:53:21,207
This didn’t change me at all.

624
00:53:21,207 --> 00:53:28,207
Just wait, before we get married, I'll become a woman worthy of you Baek Seung Jo.

625
00:53:35,773 --> 00:53:39,273
Thanks for coming! Please come again!

626
00:53:40,873 --> 00:53:45,173
Workers needed!

627
00:53:54,707 --> 00:53:55,640
Did you finish?

628
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,240
Yes.

629
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:01,040
But will a young lady like you be able to do it?

630
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,340
Though it looks like this, it's going to be pretty hard.

631
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,040
If it's hard, the harder it is the better.

632
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,940
If there are a lot of orders you might even have to cook

633
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,573
Now, don't worry about that.

634
00:54:10,573 --> 00:54:12,640
My dad is a chef,

635
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,107
and his noodle restaurant has a 60 year old history.

636
00:54:15,107 --> 00:54:16,573
Is that so?

637
00:54:17,307 --> 00:54:20,573
So, can you start today?

638
00:54:20,573 --> 00:54:24,040
Actually, one of the ladies quit so we do need help.

639
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,440
Yes. Of course.

640
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,807
I'll do my best.

641
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:30,373
It's okay. Let me do this.

642
00:54:30,373 --> 00:54:31,973
Okay. You do it.

643
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:39,873
Aunty, I'll do the dishes too

644
00:54:39,873 --> 00:54:40,473
Just leave them.

645
00:54:40,473 --> 00:54:42,840
Working part-time in a restaurant?

646
00:54:45,807 --> 00:54:50,140
I thought she went back home, but she is working in that restaurant.

647
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:53,907
Oh Ha Ni is out looking for trouble again.

648
00:54:53,907 --> 00:54:56,873
She said that this should be kept a secret from Seung Jo.

649
00:54:56,873 --> 00:55:00,973
So she doesn't want to see Baek Seung Jo until she makes something great out of herself?

650
00:55:00,973 --> 00:55:03,607
No, apparently the restaurant is a bit grungy

651
00:55:03,607 --> 00:55:07,440
The dirty aprons don't make her feel right

652
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,140
What is this? Ah.

653
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:10,740
But how is she going to go to school?

654
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:16,006
She did say something about dropping out. Is she going to continue working there?

655
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:18,973
Oh my.

656
00:55:22,573 --> 00:55:24,440
Baek Seung Jo

657
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,540
I'll be going now!

658
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,707
What should we have?

659
00:55:37,707 --> 00:55:40,207
Our bean-paste soup is really good.

660
00:55:40,207 --> 00:55:43,573
Then should we have that? Two bean-paste soups please.

661
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:45,207
Ah, yes.

662
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:36,473
Please enjoy your meals!

663
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,040
It's tasteless.

664
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,840
Is that so? I'll make it again.

665
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,726
Even if you make it again, it will probably taste the same.

666
00:56:55,472 --> 00:56:56,107
Seung Jo.

667
00:56:56,107 --> 00:57:01,707
Your friends said that the food here is delicious? What's wrong with the taste?

668
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:09,807
Okay. What are you going to do in the future?

669
00:57:09,807 --> 00:57:14,973
Being apart from you for a couple days...

670
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:21,773
I realized how tiring I am towards you and how childish I was.

671
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:26,040
I think I thought too much of my comfort.

672
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,373
So,

673
00:57:28,373 --> 00:57:30,907
you've made a decision after thinking it over?

674
00:57:33,507 --> 00:57:36,907
What is the thing I want to do the most?

675
00:57:36,907 --> 00:57:39,273
I thought about it.

676
00:57:39,273 --> 00:57:41,573
What is that?

677
00:57:41,773 --> 00:57:47,473
Seung Jo, you may think it's ridiculous and laugh in my face.

678
00:57:47,473 --> 00:57:51,373
No matter how much I think about it, this is the only thing I want.

679
00:57:52,407 --> 00:57:55,340
Helping with Baek Seung Jo's work.

680
00:57:55,873 --> 00:57:59,607
I'm going to become a nurse.

681
00:58:00,407 --> 00:58:03,740
Since it has to do with life (the living),

682
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:07,707
you might think it's too much for me.

683
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:12,973
Even so, I'm seriously thinking about it.

684
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:17,073
I want to become a wife who would suit you.

685
00:58:24,707 --> 00:58:27,573
So you've thought a lot about it.

686
00:58:27,573 --> 00:58:30,907
Trying your best to become a nurse.

687
00:58:32,773 --> 00:58:34,707
Seung Jo.

688
00:58:42,373 --> 00:58:45,540
Stop it and come back home now.

689
00:58:47,573 --> 00:58:50,807
Is it fine if I do?

690
00:58:50,807 --> 00:58:59,207
The truth is, I missed you so much I thought I would die.

691
00:58:59,207 --> 00:59:02,740
I know, I know it all.

692
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:16,773
You must really be busy with school Seung Jo.
Its going to be hard seeing you around.

693
00:59:16,773 --> 00:59:21,107
It seems that I will be out of it until graduation.

694
00:59:21,107 --> 00:59:21,940
I . . .

695
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:26,973
That's right! The game Seung Jo developed, it's going to an American game show next year!

696
00:59:26,973 --> 00:59:29,773
Wow!

697
00:59:29,773 --> 00:59:31,140
That's great.

698
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:34,640
I have something to say everyone.

699
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:38,240
Please empty your schedule for this coming Wednesday

700
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,273
Wednesday? I have a golf appointment with Chairman Yoon that day.

701
00:59:41,273 --> 00:59:43,707
The restaurant workers and I are going out

702
00:59:43,707 --> 00:59:46,473
I can't either. I'm invited to a birthday party.

703
00:59:46,473 --> 00:59:47,240
Me too.

704
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,307
Okay.

705
00:59:48,307 --> 00:59:50,207
You all cancel.

706
00:59:50,207 --> 00:59:51,107
What's this?

707
00:59:51,107 --> 00:59:52,973
What is happening on that day?

708
00:59:52,973 --> 00:59:56,440
Your wedding!

709
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:59,007
Wedding?!

710
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:23,600
I'll forget someone like you,
and at college I'll meet someone...

711
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:49,390
You don't ever see me.
Someone like me...
