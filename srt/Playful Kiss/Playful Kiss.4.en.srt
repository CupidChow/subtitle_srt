1
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,118
Is it that house?

2
00:00:53,608 --> 00:00:58,000
That's enough, okay? Hurry and leave!
If Baek Seung Jo sees us, we're dead.

3
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:08,300
Hurry, hurry.

4
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:10,066
Where is your room?

5
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:12,927
Is it over there? Or there? Where is it?

6
00:01:12,927 --> 00:01:14,500
Spare me please!!

7
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,966
It seems like it's over there, right there.

8
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:19,933
If that's Ha Ni's room, this one must be Baek Seung Jo's room?!

9
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:25,766
Please please! Spare me! Just go already!

10
00:01:25,766 --> 00:01:28,518
Ha Ni, you came?

11
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,400
You're here early?

12
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,628
Ah, yes.

13
00:01:36,628 --> 00:01:38,466
Why aren't you coming in?

14
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:41,266
Well today is just....

15
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:43,582
Are they your friends?

16
00:01:43,582 --> 00:01:46,000
Ah, hello.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,833
Ah! You, you're lady Gaga, right?

18
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:52,100
Oh, yes.

19
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,633
Aaah, the pizza lady!

20
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:55,700
That's right!

21
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,633
Ah! Hello.

22
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:00,866
And you?

23
00:02:00,866 --> 00:02:04,166
You're their close friend.

24
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,466
Yes, hello.

25
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,800
They were curious about where I am living,

26
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,600
but they're leaving now, right? Bye!

27
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,800
Omo, go where? Come in!

28
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,466
Okay.

29
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:24,233
Shall I make for you some strawberry pingsu (a mixture of fruits, ice-cream ans shaved ice)?
You can leave after you eat it.

30
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,233
Aigoo!

31
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:50,800
Aigoo!

32
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:58,100
Ohh! This looks really delicious!

33
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,333
Really? For real?

34
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:08,333
You're just loving this aren't you?

35
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,266
Ohh! Son, you came?

36
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:11,400
Hyung!

37
00:03:12,381 --> 00:03:16,100
Spreading rumors wasn't enough,
so you even brought them here?

38
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:18,466
No, that's...

39
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:20,966
You should know I've already scolded at her.

40
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:23,266
Is this your house?

41
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:25,600
I invited them in.

42
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,066
It's so much fun. It feels like there's actually people living in here.

43
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:35,166
But these friends here asked me if I'm really your mom. They asked if I really wasn't your older sister.

44
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,733
Oh Ha Ni.

45
00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:40,666
Are you just testing my patience?

46
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:41,366
Oh?

47
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:43,778
I told you to stop doing this to me,

48
00:03:43,778 --> 00:03:46,166
and not to interfere with my life any more!

49
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,656
How far do you intend to go with this?

50
00:03:48,656 --> 00:03:51,133
Just give it some rest !

51
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:54,033
What do you think you are doing now?

52
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:55,933
I was the one who took that picture,

53
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:58,500
and it was me who put that picture in the book without telling anyone. Why are you scolding at Ha Ni!

54
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,233
You too mom, please!

55
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:04,133
Then take down that blog right this instant.

56
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:05,900
Omo?

57
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,066
What makes you so mighty that, you can tell me what to do with my hobby life?

58
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:11,700
Is ruining your son's life really your hobby?

59
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,166
I heard it by chance, about what's going around the school.

60
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:24,066
So what if rumors were to spread. What's there to feel sorry about?

61
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,066
Then, we will...

62
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:37,900
Be leaving.

63
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,500
Ah, why? You should have dinner with us.

64
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,300
- Ah, no it's alright.
-Goodbye.

65
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,700
Ah, why? You should stay and have dinner here!

66
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:53,166
Ah, right! This weekend,
we're going to the beach.

67
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,033
Let's go together!

68
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:57,166
Sorry?

69
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,033
But we have class this week.

70
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:01,933
Omo! It's okay to miss one day.

71
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:03,633
Oh! It's going to be fun!

72
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:06,066
You girls only need to prepare your swimming suits,

73
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:08,200
because I'll prepare everything else!

74
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,800
Okay?

75
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:19,800
Oh come on, please come on!

76
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,395
Don't ask me the reason. Couldn't you just do it for me?

77
00:05:23,395 --> 00:05:26,300
Why? Did you mess something up again!?

78
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,566
No.

79
00:05:27,566 --> 00:05:31,533
Perhaps, are you sick ?

80
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:34,033
Ah no. I'm not sick at all.

81
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:37,966
Fine then. How much do you need?

82
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:43,933
Ah 1000? No no 2000? Ah no no! 3000?! Yes 3000 would be good.

83
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:45,533
3000?

84
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:52,266
Just think of it as spending money for my wedding just a little early. I just need 3,000.

85
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:54,100
Will 3000 be enough?

86
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,966
Yes, 3000 would be fine!

87
00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:58,033
Then, I'll give it to you!

88
00:05:58,033 --> 00:06:03,466
Ohh really? Thank you so much, father!

89
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:06,266
But, why are you so worked up over 3000 won (2.5 USD)?

90
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,033
Ahh the truth is...

91
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:10,500
I wanted to get a room ...

92
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,366
What?! 3,000, 3,000 won?

93
00:06:14,366 --> 00:06:15,766
Father, are you kidding me now?

94
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:17,566
Kidding you punk?!

95
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:21,700
You little ungrateful shameless rascal! Are you crazy?!

96
00:06:22,433 --> 00:06:28,900
You little punk! You want 30,000,000 won (25,600 USD)?! Are you stupid? What rent a room?

97
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,666
Don't waste your time on such needless things and go do something productive.

98
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:34,333
I'm going to hang up now. HANG UP!

99
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:42,766
Don't you know that in order to protect
your love you need to have money?

100
00:06:42,766 --> 00:06:45,333
Aish! Shut up!

101
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:47,466
Oh what a fright!

102
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:50,833
Would you move from there?

103
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:54,033
That is my place, young one.

104
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:59,033
Oh what's this Ahjussi? So smelly!

105
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:06,666
Why did you lose your love, young one?
Because of money?

106
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:13,066
You say that because you don't realize how
lonely that kind of love makes oneself.

107
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:20,900
But...
...does that mean you should give up on love?

108
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,933
Such a bright youth!

109
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:27,466
Wouldn't you feel sorry towards (Van) Gogh
who lived his life more unhappily than we do ours?

110
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:30,000
What? Gogh?

111
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,133
Do you know about Gogh's love?

112
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:43,533
Putting everything you have on the line.

113
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:47,300
To have no regrets despite losing everything.

114
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,766
You must be able to do that in order to
really say that you've been in love.

115
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,433
Wait, wait! Can't you tell me anything else?!

116
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:08,166
That's right! Bong Joon Gu.

117
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:11,566
Can you really say your love
has been tested by fate?

118
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:15,700
You still haven't even properly confessed your
feelings to Ha Ni!

119
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,233
And even if you had,

120
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:20,900
what would be the point?

121
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:26,400
To not regret loving despite losing everything.

122
00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:50,200
Listen carefully to what I have to say.

123
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,100
While you've been living here
there's something I've really come to hate.

124
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:58,000
People with a bad head, like you,

125
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,933
who aren't able to take in the situation,
let alone understand their own situation,

126
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:03,900
acting as if they know what's
going on and bothering other people.

127
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,500
Don't make me repeat myself.

128
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,700
What I said about you being out of
your mind wasn't just empty words.

129
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:32,066
Because of the letter,

130
00:09:32,066 --> 00:09:37,266
he embarrassed me in front of all
those students and teachers.
Even after going through such shame, I didn't cry.

131
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:48,600
No, it's alright. It's totally understandable.

132
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,266
He has every right to do so.

133
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:55,666
He must be thinking that I planned everything out.

134
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,600
(Sigh!)

135
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,966
I said that's not how it is!

136
00:10:02,966 --> 00:10:05,366
If I were him, I would be really angry too!

137
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:08,800
It must've been a pretty big shock.

138
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,666
Alright, bye!

139
00:10:21,763 --> 00:10:23,403
Oh Ha Ni?

140
00:10:23,688 --> 00:10:25,649
Are you Oh Ha Ni?

141
00:10:28,103 --> 00:10:30,519
I hate stupid girls.

142
00:10:41,236 --> 00:10:43,903
I don’t know when it was,

143
00:10:43,903 --> 00:10:46,455
Ever since I first saw you,

144
00:10:46,455 --> 00:10:51,303
Every minute, every second,
I keep thinking about you.

145
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:55,836
What you are doing...

146
00:10:57,703 --> 00:11:00,503
Where you are right now.

147
00:11:00,503 --> 00:11:02,189
Thank you.

148
00:11:02,505 --> 00:11:04,903
Even when I try looking here and there,

149
00:11:04,903 --> 00:11:07,445
And stomp on this and that.

150
00:11:07,445 --> 00:11:13,025
I keep on liking you, I think I'm going crazy, Ooh.

151
00:11:13,225 --> 00:11:16,544
I wonder if you know how I feel,

152
00:11:16,544 --> 00:11:19,370
I'm telling you not to interfere with my life anymore!

153
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,070
How far do you want to keep going with this?!

154
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,736
Will you give it up!?

155
00:11:22,736 --> 00:11:27,643
Every day stay by my side and protect me.

156
00:11:27,643 --> 00:11:32,403
I love you too much for us to be just friends.

157
00:11:32,403 --> 00:11:37,803
So can you please tell me that one word,
I love you right now?

158
00:11:37,803 --> 00:11:42,370
I love every day, only love me,

159
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,870
Please kiss me.

160
00:11:49,106 --> 00:11:50,236
It really looks pretty!

161
00:11:50,236 --> 00:11:51,178
Um.

162
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:52,436
How is it?

163
00:11:56,836 --> 00:11:57,870
Hi!

164
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,270
Seung Jo, you came down.

165
00:12:04,136 --> 00:12:06,042
They said they're ready
and that we should come out.

166
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:07,103
Oh, really?

167
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:09,503
Then shall we get going?

168
00:12:11,547 --> 00:12:13,470
Seung Jo. You too.
Put your bag down and quickly come with us.

169
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,370
Go?

170
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,503
Go where?

171
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:19,236
We're going camping for two days and one night.

172
00:12:19,236 --> 00:12:21,333
I present you...

173
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,903
Auto-Camping.

174
00:12:23,903 --> 00:12:25,370
What?

175
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,170
What about school?

176
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:30,116
I already called them.

177
00:12:32,436 --> 00:12:34,636
Hyung, I've been kidnapped!

178
00:12:34,636 --> 00:12:36,649
I woke up and found myself in the car!

179
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:38,132
Come out quickly.

180
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,403
That is the only way to save his life.

181
00:12:41,736 --> 00:12:44,844
Quickly! I've already packed your luggage.

182
00:12:44,844 --> 00:12:46,459
Your bathing suit too!

183
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,936
You are too much, seriously.

184
00:12:52,382 --> 00:12:53,236
Who is it?!

185
00:12:53,236 --> 00:12:57,894
Ha Ni! This girl suddenly says she's coming too.

186
00:12:58,936 --> 00:13:01,903
Hello! I'm comming too!

187
00:13:01,903 --> 00:13:03,495
Who is she?

188
00:13:09,203 --> 00:13:10,403
Hey.

189
00:13:10,403 --> 00:13:12,136
What is this? Why isn't she here yet?

190
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:13,670
None of them are here.

191
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,236
Argh, really!

192
00:13:15,236 --> 00:13:16,936
Good morning!

193
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,036
Nothing going on, right?

194
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:25,336
Teacher, Ha Ni isn't here yet!

195
00:13:25,336 --> 00:13:26,536
Go Min Ah isn't here either.

196
00:13:26,536 --> 00:13:27,503
Jung Ju Ri as well!

197
00:13:27,503 --> 00:13:29,603
They've all gone to have fun.

198
00:13:29,603 --> 00:13:31,736
They said they're going to the beach!
Jealous, right?!

199
00:13:31,736 --> 00:13:34,236
Gone to have fun you said?

200
00:13:34,236 --> 00:13:36,470
Teacher, do you know how scary this world is?!

201
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,436
How could you allow three girls
to go to the beach alone?!

202
00:13:38,436 --> 00:13:43,503
It wasn't just the girls; they all went
with Baek Seung Jo's family.

203
00:13:43,503 --> 00:13:46,845
Did you say Baek...BAEK SEUNG JO?!

204
00:13:50,836 --> 00:13:53,436
Just kill me instead! Kill me!

205
00:13:53,436 --> 00:13:55,503
What? They went on a trip?!

206
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:58,036
And to add to that, for one night and two days?!

207
00:13:58,036 --> 00:14:00,803
What am I going to do?

208
00:14:04,503 --> 00:14:07,770
Am I going to have to earn some money?

209
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,470
Argh! What to do now?

210
00:14:19,636 --> 00:14:21,003
What is it, Bong Joon Gu?

211
00:14:21,003 --> 00:14:22,803
You, did you just get here?!

212
00:14:22,803 --> 00:14:24,670
That's not it, Sir.

213
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,546
I'm in a rush and am leaving early.

214
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:27,936
Leaving early?!

215
00:14:27,936 --> 00:14:31,436
Vice Principal, you see...

216
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:37,338
Aigoo, my aunt got into a
traffic accident so suddenly!

217
00:14:37,552 --> 00:14:39,903
I have to go really quickly now.

218
00:14:39,903 --> 00:14:43,903
R-really? Then hurry up and go.

219
00:14:43,903 --> 00:14:45,915
Ah yes.

220
00:14:45,915 --> 00:14:50,836
Aigoo, but although I have to go
really quickly, I have no money!

221
00:14:50,836 --> 00:14:55,240
Can I borrow this just this once?

222
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,123
Aigoo, this?!

223
00:14:57,123 --> 00:15:01,370
Yes. They said she might pass away any second!

224
00:15:01,936 --> 00:15:04,970
Man, even if this is a piece of crap,
it's still something!

225
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,170
The heavens are definitely on my side!

226
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,813
Ha Ni, I'm coming!

227
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,436
Quickly cross the road! It's dangerous.

228
00:15:15,236 --> 00:15:17,511
Aigoo, how cute they are!

229
00:15:17,511 --> 00:15:19,370
Alright, let's go!

230
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:20,270
Oppa! Oppa!

231
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:20,870
Oh. What is it?

232
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,351
We just opened right next to the subway station.

233
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:26,170
Here. Be sure to come and have fun!!

234
00:15:26,936 --> 00:15:27,870
But I'm still a student.

235
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:30,771
Many university students come as well.

236
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:32,870
But, Oppa, you're really cute.

237
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,774
Ah, yes, thank you.

238
00:15:34,874 --> 00:15:37,103
You should definitely come!

239
00:15:40,336 --> 00:15:41,970
Massage Palace?

240
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,703
Eh? What's that?

241
00:15:43,703 --> 00:15:45,770
Protect the youth.

242
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,836
Is this a good thing?

243
00:15:47,836 --> 00:15:50,303
Yaah, really!

244
00:15:50,747 --> 00:15:52,403
Let's go!

245
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,636
Ah.

246
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,736
Oppa, do you want to eat some watermelon?
I cut it up nicely so it's easy to eat!

247
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:11,170
There's a ridiculous amount of
watermelon in the fridge.

248
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,103
Oh, but mine is super sweet! It tastes like honey!

249
00:16:14,103 --> 00:16:17,262
A watermelon should taste like watermelon.

250
00:16:17,262 --> 00:16:20,803
If it tastes like honey, how could it be watermelon?
Wouldn't it be honey?!

251
00:16:23,236 --> 00:16:28,270
So, how did you know we were
going to the beach?

252
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:32,066
Everyone has their ways.

253
00:16:32,674 --> 00:16:34,670
First, you need to have a bathing suit.

254
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:39,203
Ah, also hairspray and a hairdryer and...

255
00:16:39,203 --> 00:16:41,036
And what else?

256
00:16:41,036 --> 00:16:42,903
Ha Ni, do you have a swimsuit?

257
00:16:42,903 --> 00:16:45,469
Yeah. I bought it last year, remember?

258
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:48,203
Hey! Just buy a new one!

259
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,694
Omo, there is even a Noraebang (Karaoke) there?

260
00:16:59,694 --> 00:17:02,236
Should we try out a song, Oppa?!

261
00:17:02,236 --> 00:17:04,436
What is this, a tour bus? Why would you sing?

262
00:17:05,136 --> 00:17:08,103
Then should we play the "End Letter" game?!

263
00:17:08,103 --> 00:17:09,436
Huh?

264
00:17:09,436 --> 00:17:12,303
Why that? It's so childish!

265
00:17:12,303 --> 00:17:16,470
Omo! That's a great idea!
Ha Ni, you really thought well!

266
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,536
Then, let's have the topic be four character sayings!

267
00:17:18,536 --> 00:17:20,670
Mi Na first!

268
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:21,603
Ee Shim Jun Shim!
(tactic understanding)

269
00:17:21,603 --> 00:17:23,103
Ee Shim Jun Shim?

270
00:17:23,103 --> 00:17:24,536
"Shim"?

271
00:17:24,536 --> 00:17:25,836
Ooh...
"Shim Shim Pur Ee!
(to kill time)

272
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,970
Is "kill time" a four character saying, Mom?

273
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,703
Of course! Shim Shim Pur Ee!

274
00:17:30,703 --> 00:17:33,103
Hurry up and do it, if you don't you'll be punished!!

275
00:17:33,103 --> 00:17:35,070
You'll have to write your name with your butt!

276
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,403
You're really immature!

277
00:17:36,403 --> 00:17:37,136
One, two...

278
00:17:37,136 --> 00:17:39,136
Ee Shil Jik Go!
(telling the truth!)

279
00:17:39,136 --> 00:17:40,703
Seung Jo.

280
00:17:40,703 --> 00:17:42,636
Ah! Are you really doing this?

281
00:17:42,636 --> 00:17:44,089
One, two!

282
00:17:44,089 --> 00:17:46,136
Go...

283
00:17:46,136 --> 00:17:47,803
"Go Jang Nan Myeong"
("It takes two to tango" or "One needs help to accomplish anything")

284
00:17:47,803 --> 00:17:50,703
"GojangNanMyeong"? What does that mean?

285
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,803
It should just be
Go Jang Nan Cha! (broken car) instead.

286
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,436
He didn't say "Go Jang Nan Byung" (broken disease), he said "Go Jang Nan Myeong"!

287
00:17:58,436 --> 00:18:02,936
"Go Jang Nan Myeong". It means you can't
make sound with just one hand!

288
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:04,987
Oh.

289
00:18:04,987 --> 00:18:07,036
You're so smart!

290
00:18:07,036 --> 00:18:09,003
Did you guys get that?

291
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:10,436
So stupid!

292
00:18:10,436 --> 00:18:14,136
Yu Yu Sang Jong!
(Birds of a feather flock together!)

293
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:17,836
Hey! Hurry and go.
"Go Jang Nan Myeong"!

294
00:18:17,836 --> 00:18:20,003
- One
- Myeong, Myeong?

295
00:18:20,003 --> 00:18:20,636
Two.

296
00:18:20,636 --> 00:18:22,570
"Myeong Myeong Baek Baek!"
(Crystal clear!)

297
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,103
Baek?

298
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:24,248
One.

299
00:18:24,248 --> 00:18:25,819
Wait a second.

300
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:28,203
What starts with Baek?

301
00:18:28,203 --> 00:18:29,070
Baek?!

302
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,403
Two.
Three!

303
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:34,336
"Baek Seung Jo Jjang!"
(Baek Seung Jo is the best!)

304
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,470
You wanted to say those words so badly,
that's why you asked to play this game, right?!

305
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,736
No. Are you crazy?!

306
00:18:49,736 --> 00:18:53,836
Hey! It's just that there were no other words!

307
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,953
Aigoo, thank you!

308
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:24,753
Whoa! This is great!

309
00:19:26,286 --> 00:19:29,386
Kids, come get some drinks!

310
00:19:29,386 --> 00:19:29,853
Yes!

311
00:19:29,853 --> 00:19:34,086
I should have bought Ha Ni a bikini!

312
00:19:34,086 --> 00:19:36,453
She looks pure and pretty!

313
00:19:36,453 --> 00:19:40,385
A high school girl's charm is her innocence.

314
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,953
- Oh.
- Oh.

315
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:48,653
What's that, Oh Ha Ni?!

316
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:51,620
You have to use a tube?! I don't even need one.

317
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,753
Yeah, I can't swim very well.

318
00:19:53,753 --> 00:19:57,520
Seung Jo, does Ha Ni look pretty? And innocent!

319
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,486
Doesn't she look like a high school student?

320
00:20:00,486 --> 00:20:02,786
She looks like an elementary student.

321
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,486
You're pretty, Ha Ni. You're the prettiest!

322
00:20:07,986 --> 00:20:09,386
I forgot.

323
00:20:09,386 --> 00:20:11,620
You need these.

324
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,886
What is this!

325
00:20:17,886 --> 00:20:19,653
They're socks.

326
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,153
Why did he give these to you?

327
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,752
What is that?

328
00:20:29,753 --> 00:20:33,653
They look like socks.

329
00:20:41,086 --> 00:20:48,753
God, I will kill that guy today and go to hell!

330
00:20:48,753 --> 00:20:50,786
HEY!!

331
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:55,520
Ha Ni!

332
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,286
Oh, Ha Ni!

333
00:20:57,586 --> 00:20:59,253
Are you okay?

334
00:21:06,186 --> 00:21:07,920
Yah!
Are you okay? Nothing happened right?

335
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,786
Those socks were for you to wear.

336
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,553
Aren't you going to come here?

337
00:21:15,953 --> 00:21:17,786
BAEK SEUNG JO!!

338
00:21:37,786 --> 00:21:41,953
What is this? What's wrong with you?

339
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:46,286
Why is this suddenly being like this?!

340
00:21:46,286 --> 00:21:48,486
Has it already lived its life?

341
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,220
We're almost there, so why are you being like this?

342
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,820
Aish!

343
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,286
Is it out of gas?

344
00:21:59,286 --> 00:22:02,786
I don't have any money, what will I do?

345
00:22:02,786 --> 00:22:05,220
Really!

346
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,345
Is there any gas?

347
00:22:07,345 --> 00:22:09,586
Let's see, let's see.

348
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,053
Is it there, or is it empty?

349
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,786
It's too dark, I can't see anything.

350
00:22:17,786 --> 00:22:20,120
Ah, that's right.

351
00:22:21,286 --> 00:22:23,186
Aish.

352
00:22:27,753 --> 00:22:29,453
Oh, what's up with this?

353
00:22:29,453 --> 00:22:32,253
This is interesting.

354
00:22:32,253 --> 00:22:35,553
Here. Let's see, let's see.

355
00:22:36,586 --> 00:22:37,586
Here.

356
00:22:39,686 --> 00:22:41,620
Oh!

357
00:22:46,286 --> 00:22:48,120
Dad, what is that?

358
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,420
Don't know.

359
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,920
Did it fall from the sky?!

360
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,020
No.

361
00:23:06,253 --> 00:23:07,953
I'm taking the picture!

362
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,886
Kimchi!

363
00:23:10,853 --> 00:23:11,886
Is it done?!

364
00:23:11,886 --> 00:23:13,253
Yeah!

365
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:18,853
Next time, we should ask
someone else to take the photo.

366
00:23:18,853 --> 00:23:20,620
Go Mi didn't come.

367
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,520
Seung Jo Oppa!

368
00:23:27,886 --> 00:23:29,586
Hyung!

369
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,353
Oh. Well done!

370
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,990
Man. That dung fly, Hong Jang Mi is getting in the way.
I hate her. Absolutely.

371
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,820
Kids! Let's eat some watermelon!

372
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,253
I think she's calling us!

373
00:23:56,253 --> 00:23:58,786
Ha Ni! Come!

374
00:23:58,786 --> 00:24:00,686
Let's go! I'm so hungry!
The watermelon looks yummy!

375
00:24:00,686 --> 00:24:02,986
Oh. Wait just a second!

376
00:24:02,986 --> 00:24:06,186
Hey! Bbong (padding) Ha Ni!

377
00:24:06,186 --> 00:24:09,486
What? Stop kidding around!

378
00:24:09,486 --> 00:24:11,020
Bbong!

379
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,520
A tree goes plop and farts, "Bbong!!"

380
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,686
HEY! Really now. Baek Eun Jo!

381
00:24:16,686 --> 00:24:17,753
Bbong bboro bbong bbong, bbong bbong!

382
00:24:17,753 --> 00:24:20,786
You really, to your Noona?!

383
00:24:20,786 --> 00:24:22,153
Bbong bboro bbong bbong, bbong bbong!

384
00:24:22,153 --> 00:24:22,786
HEY!

385
00:24:22,786 --> 00:24:24,786
What's wrong with you?

386
00:24:28,253 --> 00:24:30,786
Try and catch me! Just try. Come in.
You can't swim, can you?!

387
00:24:30,786 --> 00:24:32,286
Just try and come!

388
00:24:32,286 --> 00:24:35,253
HEY! Baek Eun Jo. Just try and come out!

389
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:48,953
Hey! Are you faking this?!

390
00:24:48,953 --> 00:24:52,420
You've got to better than that if you're just fooling around.

391
00:24:53,586 --> 00:24:54,453
HELP ME, PLEASE!

392
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:55,520
What?!

393
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,186
Is this real?!

394
00:24:57,186 --> 00:24:58,720
Hey! Baek Eun Jo!

395
00:25:00,853 --> 00:25:03,220
Hey! Someone fell in the water!

396
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,453
Someone help!

397
00:25:05,453 --> 00:25:07,386
Dad!

398
00:25:14,853 --> 00:25:19,320
After telling them to come eat
watermelon, they go right back in.

399
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,353
Their maturity level is the same.

400
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,053
They're just innocent!

401
00:25:41,686 --> 00:25:44,420
Honey, our throats are getting dry!

402
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,420
Watermelon for me, too!!

403
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,986
I'll give you watermelon.

404
00:25:49,786 --> 00:25:51,086
Here's some. Say "ah".

405
00:25:51,086 --> 00:25:53,386
Eat some watermelon!

406
00:26:07,453 --> 00:26:09,053
What?! They fell?!?!

407
00:26:11,386 --> 00:26:12,553
What?!

408
00:26:12,553 --> 00:26:14,786
Honey, what's going on?!

409
00:26:14,786 --> 00:26:16,853
What?! Hey!

410
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:21,853
Ha Ni! Ha Ni!

411
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,020
Just stay still!

412
00:26:43,653 --> 00:26:44,853
Eun Jo!

413
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,486
Eun Jo! Are you alright?!

414
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,020
Are you okay?!

415
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,853
Eun Jo!

416
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,855
You're okay?! Yes?!

417
00:27:14,086 --> 00:27:16,453
Our son!

418
00:27:18,753 --> 00:27:21,253
Wow! This looks so good!

419
00:27:25,653 --> 00:27:27,453
Seung Jo.

420
00:27:27,886 --> 00:27:30,953
Go give Ha Ni some water. Warm water.

421
00:27:30,953 --> 00:27:31,986
I'll go give it to her.

422
00:27:31,986 --> 00:27:33,753
Oh no, no!

423
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:36,286
Jang Mi, you cook the beef.

424
00:27:36,286 --> 00:27:37,486
Pardon?

425
00:27:37,586 --> 00:27:40,486
Baek Seung Jo, quickly!

426
00:27:45,953 --> 00:27:47,386
My goodness.

427
00:27:47,693 --> 00:27:49,460
Are you okay, Ha Ni?!

428
00:27:51,393 --> 00:27:53,226
You don't have to go to the hospital?

429
00:27:53,226 --> 00:27:55,393
No. You were scared, weren't you?

430
00:27:55,393 --> 00:27:58,326
Of course!

431
00:27:59,893 --> 00:28:04,693
I was so surprised, my heart is still pounding.

432
00:28:07,326 --> 00:28:10,360
It had to be when I was under the sand.

433
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,460
It's okay. I came right out.

434
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,673
What do you mean "it's okay"?

435
00:28:15,673 --> 00:28:20,726
I couldn't move because of the sand, but there
you were right in front of me flailing around!

436
00:28:20,726 --> 00:28:23,760
At that moment, I was thinking...

437
00:28:25,124 --> 00:28:27,826
"This is what they call hell."

438
00:28:29,093 --> 00:28:31,560
I'm sorry, Dad.

439
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,860
Do you want some water?

440
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:54,926
Seung Jo, thank you so much. If you hadn't
been there, what would have happened?

441
00:28:57,393 --> 00:28:59,093
It was nothing.

442
00:29:00,426 --> 00:29:04,860
For that, I will pay you back with a killer dinner.

443
00:29:17,713 --> 00:29:20,626
You can't swim and without fear...

444
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:25,226
What was I supposed to do?
Even when I yelled, no one could hear me.

445
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,726
You are an accident prone troublemaker.

446
00:29:32,726 --> 00:29:37,560
I haven't had a days rest since meeting you.

447
00:29:37,993 --> 00:29:41,260
Why are you being mean again?

448
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,426
I'm still sick.

449
00:29:43,426 --> 00:29:45,293
Sick...

450
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,426
Who... Who are you?

451
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,460
Where is my Ha Ni?

452
00:30:05,393 --> 00:30:06,560
Is it all ready?

453
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,026
Yes.

454
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,660
Then, all of the men go to the tent!

455
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,393
What about Eun Jo?

456
00:30:13,393 --> 00:30:16,319
Since Eun Jo's sick, he has to sleep with me.

457
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,726
Yes.

458
00:30:17,726 --> 00:30:19,360
Yes.

459
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,960
Children!

460
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,293
Wow, it's our sleeping quarters.

461
00:30:24,293 --> 00:30:27,760
Wow, this is great!
I get top bunk.

462
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:31,326
Wow, jackpot! So great!

463
00:30:31,326 --> 00:30:32,696
I call this spot!

464
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:34,793
It really changed!

465
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:36,760
Go, go, go!

466
00:30:37,726 --> 00:30:39,226
You got the top bunk.

467
00:30:39,226 --> 00:30:41,060
Must be nice!

468
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:41,893
Must be nice!

469
00:30:41,893 --> 00:30:43,160
You're not tired?

470
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,626
I'm okay.

471
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:00,493
What?

472
00:31:03,393 --> 00:31:05,193
Hey, hey, you took one!

473
00:31:05,193 --> 00:31:05,926
Hey!

474
00:31:22,526 --> 00:31:25,626
You know how to play guitar too?

475
00:31:29,526 --> 00:31:32,093
I borrowed some of your clothes.

476
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:40,260
Okay. I heard that you saved Ha Ni.

477
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,293
I should have come a little earlier.

478
00:31:43,293 --> 00:31:46,760
Well, I guess you did your fair share.

479
00:31:47,718 --> 00:31:50,326
Did you come all the way here
because of Oh Ha Ni?

480
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:55,460
Of course I did! I don't care what a stiff genius you are; you're still a puberty stricken 18 year old!

481
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:59,326
I don't know when you'll turn into a beast,
so I've got to watch you day and night.

482
00:32:00,593 --> 00:32:04,560
Why? You should just move into our house then.

483
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:10,593
Do you have an empty room?

484
00:32:16,993 --> 00:32:22,293
I'm warning you! Don't you dare
make a move on her!

485
00:32:22,293 --> 00:32:25,393
Remember that I'm always
watching from somewhere. Got it?

486
00:32:25,393 --> 00:32:27,293
You like Oh Ha Ni that much?

487
00:32:30,426 --> 00:32:36,060
Man, if you ask me that directly,
it's a bit overwhelming.

488
00:32:38,493 --> 00:32:41,860
Whatever I become, I need to
hurry up and get a job.

489
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:46,226
My dream is to make Ha Ni happy.

490
00:32:46,893 --> 00:32:51,326
Yeah. You guys look good
together, you and Oh Ha Ni.

491
00:32:52,526 --> 00:32:55,826
Really? You think so?

492
00:32:56,693 --> 00:33:00,660
You're different than what
I thought, Baek Seung Jo.

493
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,393
Definitely different.

494
00:33:02,393 --> 00:33:04,893
Yeah, really different.

495
00:33:05,826 --> 00:33:08,793
You have some taste.

496
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,860
Yeah. Ha Ni doesn't look good with you.

497
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:18,626
Doesn't matter how much Ha Ni likes you.
That'll end in good time.

498
00:33:18,626 --> 00:33:19,893
Huh.

499
00:33:19,893 --> 00:33:23,360
Baek Seung Jo, should we be friends?

500
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:24,593
No.

501
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:28,560
Why? Okay, okay. Do whatever you want.

502
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:33,293
I don't need a friend like you.
As long as I have Ha Ni, I'm good.

503
00:33:33,293 --> 00:33:36,660
Hey, sing a song.

504
00:33:39,926 --> 00:33:44,993
Once again, he has come a long
way in order to protect you.

505
00:33:44,993 --> 00:33:50,160
Playful Kiss.

506
00:33:51,626 --> 00:33:53,893
Ha Ni.

507
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,926
It was great when we were playing.

508
00:34:01,926 --> 00:34:04,526
Seriously.

509
00:34:04,526 --> 00:34:09,326
There are so many colleges,
we'll get into one, right?

510
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,493
Of course. We still have two months left.

511
00:34:13,493 --> 00:34:15,160
We can do it.

512
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:20,893
Is this arrogance I see because you
got into the top fifty within a week?

513
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,093
It's not that.

514
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:23,993
Ah!

515
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:35,060
You guys should be playing at this age.
What kind of suffering is this? So sad.

516
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:38,260
It is, huh? You feel really sad for us, don't you?

517
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,626
We'll eat well.

518
00:34:40,626 --> 00:34:42,726
Thank you very much.

519
00:34:42,726 --> 00:34:46,126
Kids, if there's something you don't know,

520
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:48,626
ask him.

521
00:34:48,626 --> 00:34:51,626
What else would you use a smart kid for?

522
00:34:53,526 --> 00:34:54,860
Fighting.

523
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,293
Fighting.

524
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,726
Thank you.

525
00:35:06,226 --> 00:35:11,326
Did you see? Her face is the size of my fist.

526
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,360
Whoa.

527
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,526
Ha Ni, this is no joke for you.

528
00:35:15,526 --> 00:35:17,426
No. It's mother's (Seung Jo's mother) preferences.

529
00:35:17,426 --> 00:35:20,626
Oh, mother?

530
00:35:20,626 --> 00:35:23,226
What? It's my friend's mother.

531
00:35:23,226 --> 00:35:24,293
Oh, look at this.

532
00:35:24,293 --> 00:35:25,793
What is this?

533
00:35:29,693 --> 00:35:31,360
"Things To Do With Seung Jo."

534
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,093
- "A date at the Nam Mountains."
- Hey!

535
00:35:33,093 --> 00:35:34,993
- "Piggyback ride amongst a lot of people."
- Hey, hey!

536
00:35:35,726 --> 00:35:41,793
-Holdings hands
-Talking on the phone all night long!
Getting married!

537
00:35:43,193 --> 00:35:46,593
It's completely decorated with Baek Seung Jo.

538
00:35:46,593 --> 00:35:47,926
Give it to me!

539
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,060
Ha Ni!

540
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,960
Hey, what are you doing?

541
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:58,093
I thought Baek Seung Jo was really skinny,

542
00:35:58,093 --> 00:36:01,826
but ever since we went on the trip,
I found out he's a man.

543
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,060
Oh.

544
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,993
He must work out. His back
muscles look really firm.

545
00:36:06,993 --> 00:36:09,293
Hey.

546
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:11,060
Even talking about him gets you excited?!

547
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:11,926
You like him that much?

548
00:36:11,926 --> 00:36:12,760
Ah, really.

549
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,060
Study, study!

550
00:36:14,393 --> 00:36:15,826
Right.

551
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:23,360
Number 1.
1/4 of this...

552
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,925
That's the equation.

553
00:36:25,925 --> 00:36:27,293
The answer...

554
00:36:27,293 --> 00:36:29,260
What are you talking about?

555
00:36:30,793 --> 00:36:32,060
Should we start with number 2?

556
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:46,826
What?

557
00:36:47,526 --> 00:36:47,893
What?

558
00:36:50,526 --> 00:36:51,493
What?

559
00:36:59,526 --> 00:37:01,293
Hurry and go.

560
00:37:01,526 --> 00:37:03,626
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

561
00:37:03,626 --> 00:37:05,626
Get up, get up.

562
00:37:28,504 --> 00:37:30,804
Yes?

563
00:37:38,271 --> 00:37:40,904
Eun Jo, not there, but higher.

564
00:37:41,671 --> 00:37:42,971
Here?

565
00:37:44,837 --> 00:37:46,637
Excuse me.

566
00:37:46,637 --> 00:37:48,437
Do you have a bit of time?

567
00:37:48,437 --> 00:37:49,604
No.

568
00:37:49,604 --> 00:37:52,971
Right? Okay.

569
00:37:57,736 --> 00:37:59,337
Hi!

570
00:37:59,337 --> 00:38:02,237
What the heck, Oh Ha Ni?!

571
00:38:02,837 --> 00:38:07,171
You see, I'm studying with my friends
and there's a problem we don't understand.

572
00:38:07,671 --> 00:38:10,237
We just can't seem to get it.

573
00:38:12,071 --> 00:38:13,571
I don't want to.

574
00:38:14,337 --> 00:38:17,971
Come on, it won't even take you a minute.

575
00:38:17,971 --> 00:38:20,171
30 seconds, just 30 seconds!

576
00:38:20,171 --> 00:38:23,106
Even 30 seconds is a waste of my time.

577
00:38:23,106 --> 00:38:25,271
A waste of your time?

578
00:38:25,271 --> 00:38:29,504
Our lives depend on your 30 seconds.

579
00:38:31,737 --> 00:38:34,204
At least you speak well.

580
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,074
It's this one!

581
00:38:39,504 --> 00:38:42,904
What about this do you not understand?

582
00:38:43,137 --> 00:38:44,737
Huh?

583
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:00,771
There, right?

584
00:39:02,304 --> 00:39:03,904
Wow!

585
00:39:03,904 --> 00:39:05,304
Yes.

586
00:39:06,671 --> 00:39:09,304
Thanks.

587
00:39:09,304 --> 00:39:11,704
Thanks a lot!

588
00:39:21,537 --> 00:39:23,737
Oh, I see.

589
00:39:25,004 --> 00:39:29,271
He solved it so simply, even I can understand it.

590
00:39:30,637 --> 00:39:34,004
Alright then, the next problem!

591
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:36,771
Let's go for the next one!

592
00:39:55,537 --> 00:39:57,871
Excuse me.

593
00:39:58,037 --> 00:39:59,637
Excuse me.

594
00:40:04,137 --> 00:40:05,937
Just one more.

595
00:40:12,537 --> 00:40:14,237
You're going to sleep?

596
00:40:16,337 --> 00:40:18,637
The next equation as well...

597
00:40:26,571 --> 00:40:29,804
I'm sorry!

598
00:40:32,271 --> 00:40:33,537
Hey!

599
00:40:33,537 --> 00:40:36,171
Come back in 15 minutes!

600
00:40:36,171 --> 00:40:37,704
Try going in.

601
00:40:37,704 --> 00:40:39,904
Yeah, it's been 15 minutes...

602
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,637
I'm scared.

603
00:40:42,637 --> 00:40:45,204
Hurry up!

604
00:40:46,037 --> 00:40:47,771
I just can't do it!

605
00:40:47,771 --> 00:40:48,937
Hurry up and go in!

606
00:40:55,137 --> 00:40:56,171
Oh my, oh my!

607
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:57,871
Are you happy?!

608
00:40:59,071 --> 00:41:01,937
Don't you dare come near my room now!

609
00:41:27,104 --> 00:41:29,837
Ah, I see.

610
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:33,604
What if I actually get into a university like this?!

611
00:41:34,203 --> 00:41:37,037
It would be nice if he could help
with our other subjects too.

612
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:38,071
That's right!

613
00:41:38,071 --> 00:41:41,137
We have free time this week!

614
00:41:41,404 --> 00:41:42,604
Are you out of your minds?!

615
00:41:42,604 --> 00:41:46,571
How can you ask that after seeing
how he reacted last night?

616
00:41:48,171 --> 00:41:49,771
Hey.

617
00:41:49,771 --> 00:41:51,271
What's this?

618
00:41:51,271 --> 00:41:52,404
Wow!

619
00:41:55,071 --> 00:41:57,604
Hey, what are you doing?!

620
00:41:57,604 --> 00:41:58,771
Why are you bothering Ha Ni?

621
00:41:58,771 --> 00:42:00,500
Oh Ha Ni.

622
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,537
Who solved these for you?

623
00:42:02,537 --> 00:42:04,471
Baek Seung Jo worked them out for you, didn't he?

624
00:42:04,471 --> 00:42:05,771
I heard you two live together.

625
00:42:05,771 --> 00:42:06,737
No, that is...

626
00:42:06,737 --> 00:42:08,604
Move it, move it, move it!

627
00:42:08,604 --> 00:42:12,304
That's right, the god, Baek Seung Jo solved them!

628
00:42:12,304 --> 00:42:13,037
Why?

629
00:42:13,037 --> 00:42:13,537
Are you guys jealous?!

630
00:42:13,537 --> 00:42:15,737
You guys study with Baek Seung Jo?!

631
00:42:16,604 --> 00:42:18,971
What is it? What are they talking about?

632
00:42:18,971 --> 00:42:20,504
Oh Ha Ni.

633
00:42:21,437 --> 00:42:22,604
Let me in too.

634
00:42:22,604 --> 00:42:23,471
Huh?

635
00:42:23,471 --> 00:42:26,437
Me too! Me too! Me too!

636
00:42:26,437 --> 00:42:28,637
What are you talking about?

637
00:42:28,637 --> 00:42:30,871
Don't you guys have any pride?!

638
00:42:30,871 --> 00:42:31,871
Joon Gu!

639
00:42:31,871 --> 00:42:32,771
What?!

640
00:42:32,771 --> 00:42:34,937
Does pride get you into university?

641
00:42:34,937 --> 00:42:36,904
What?! Pride?!

642
00:42:36,904 --> 00:42:39,804
You little! You're supposed to study on your own!

643
00:42:39,804 --> 00:42:41,904
Who are you asking to teach you?!

644
00:42:41,904 --> 00:42:42,904
Isn't that right?

645
00:42:42,904 --> 00:42:45,204
Right, right?

646
00:42:45,204 --> 00:42:48,637
Hey, you, yellow head!

647
00:42:49,837 --> 00:42:51,537
You're going to go too?

648
00:42:51,537 --> 00:42:55,737
Just look at them! Fine! Go, go!

649
00:42:55,737 --> 00:42:57,304
Oh really?

650
00:42:57,304 --> 00:42:57,837
Fine!

651
00:42:57,837 --> 00:42:59,071
Just go, go, go!

652
00:42:59,071 --> 00:43:03,771
Hey. Hey. One. Two. Three.

653
00:43:03,771 --> 00:43:06,450
What? Man!

654
00:43:13,504 --> 00:43:16,971
Why are there so many shoes?

655
00:43:29,904 --> 00:43:34,404
- He's here!
- Hello, Teacher!

656
00:43:34,404 --> 00:43:36,071
Mom, what the heck are these--?

657
00:43:37,937 --> 00:43:41,004
They all came to see you.

658
00:43:41,004 --> 00:43:42,504
Baek Seung Jo!

659
00:43:42,504 --> 00:43:44,471
Tutor us too.

660
00:43:44,471 --> 00:43:47,271
- Me too!
- Me too!
- Me too!

661
00:43:50,504 --> 00:43:52,704
Jeez! Oh Ha Ni.

662
00:43:54,137 --> 00:43:55,671
No way.

663
00:43:55,671 --> 00:43:57,337
I'm a bit tired.

664
00:43:58,337 --> 00:44:01,237
Dear, where are you going?

665
00:44:01,237 --> 00:44:03,671
Mom is so very happy!

666
00:44:03,671 --> 00:44:05,204
That my son,

667
00:44:05,204 --> 00:44:07,237
can be of help to someone like this.

668
00:44:07,237 --> 00:44:09,171
You're happy?!

669
00:44:10,471 --> 00:44:12,204
Hey, Oh Ha Ni!

670
00:44:12,204 --> 00:44:14,971
You better come out!

671
00:44:26,937 --> 00:44:27,937
Just this once?

672
00:44:27,937 --> 00:44:31,271
Oh Ha Ni, you really...

673
00:44:31,271 --> 00:44:36,071
Save our class, just this once!
I will never forget your kindness!

674
00:44:36,071 --> 00:44:37,571
We'll never forget!

675
00:44:37,571 --> 00:44:39,171
Please help us!

676
00:44:39,171 --> 00:44:41,871
Please save us!

677
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:08,337
The object on the ground,

678
00:45:08,337 --> 00:45:11,404
has a mass of 2 kilograms.

679
00:45:11,404 --> 00:45:13,937
If 10 newtons of force are applied,

680
00:45:13,937 --> 00:45:16,037
with a frictional force of 4 newtons,

681
00:45:16,037 --> 00:45:19,837
what is the highest speed this object can reach?

682
00:45:21,937 --> 00:45:23,037
With this problem,

683
00:45:23,037 --> 00:45:25,837
you use the equation of F = ma.

684
00:45:25,837 --> 00:45:27,904
Ahhh~

685
00:45:27,904 --> 00:45:31,637
If F = ma, what is F?

686
00:45:32,471 --> 00:45:34,037
Force.

687
00:45:34,637 --> 00:45:36,737
M is mass.

688
00:45:36,737 --> 00:45:37,904
Ah.

689
00:45:37,904 --> 00:45:39,971
A is acceleration.

690
00:45:39,971 --> 00:45:41,404
Oh, I see!

691
00:45:41,404 --> 00:45:43,471
What we're looking for is the value of "a".

692
00:45:43,471 --> 00:45:46,037
Therefore A = F/M.

693
00:45:46,037 --> 00:45:53,771
In this case, force is 10 newtons
and mass is 2 kilograms.

694
00:45:58,436 --> 00:45:59,637
Oh?

695
00:45:59,637 --> 00:46:01,437
I'll do the dishes!

696
00:46:01,437 --> 00:46:03,004
I'm all done.

697
00:46:03,004 --> 00:46:04,037
Your friends left?

698
00:46:04,037 --> 00:46:06,571
I told you to have them over for dinner.

699
00:46:06,571 --> 00:46:11,137
I couldn't. You even made lunch for all of them.

700
00:46:11,137 --> 00:46:13,404
Do you think studying is going to get you anywhere?

701
00:46:13,404 --> 00:46:15,537
Baek Eun Jo,

702
00:46:15,537 --> 00:46:17,604
that's a yellow card for you.

703
00:46:17,604 --> 00:46:19,771
One more time and you're out.

704
00:46:24,771 --> 00:46:26,004
What should we have for dinner?

705
00:46:26,004 --> 00:46:27,004
Sweet and sour pork!

706
00:46:27,004 --> 00:46:28,771
No way!

707
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:36,404
It seems like Seung Jo doesn't like
sweet and sour pork very much.

708
00:46:36,404 --> 00:46:38,771
When we have it for lunch, he barely eats any of it.

709
00:46:38,771 --> 00:46:39,971
I like it!

710
00:46:39,971 --> 00:46:41,671
That's right.

711
00:46:41,671 --> 00:46:43,971
Seung Jo doesn't really like it.

712
00:46:43,971 --> 00:46:46,771
I said that I like it!

713
00:46:52,204 --> 00:46:53,037
Are you tired?

714
00:46:53,037 --> 00:46:54,937
Obviously.

715
00:46:57,471 --> 00:46:59,637
Water?

716
00:46:59,637 --> 00:47:01,904
You want water?!

717
00:47:01,904 --> 00:47:03,337
This one is cold.

718
00:47:03,337 --> 00:47:05,071
Never mind.

719
00:47:05,071 --> 00:47:06,537
Here.

720
00:47:07,404 --> 00:47:10,104
Oh, really!

721
00:47:12,137 --> 00:47:15,204
That one was just put in.

722
00:47:17,304 --> 00:47:19,037
Stop.

723
00:47:47,304 --> 00:47:48,437
Hello.

724
00:47:48,437 --> 00:47:52,671
Yes! What's happening?

725
00:47:52,671 --> 00:47:54,671
Really?

726
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:55,404
What should I do?

727
00:47:55,404 --> 00:47:57,704
I'll leave right away!

728
00:47:57,704 --> 00:48:00,071
Yes. I'm hanging up.

729
00:48:00,071 --> 00:48:02,204
What should I do?

730
00:48:02,204 --> 00:48:04,771
What am I going to do?

731
00:48:05,337 --> 00:48:06,804
What should I do?

732
00:48:08,704 --> 00:48:10,337
What to do, what to do?

733
00:48:16,304 --> 00:48:19,137
My husband is going to go straight there as well!

734
00:48:19,137 --> 00:48:22,237
So you two figure out your own dinners, alright?

735
00:48:22,237 --> 00:48:26,171
- Why isn't Hyung going?
- Hyung has to study, he's a senior.

736
00:48:26,171 --> 00:48:28,437
Don't come out! You two stay here!

737
00:48:28,437 --> 00:48:30,704
Hey. Hurry.

738
00:48:37,271 --> 00:48:39,204
Sorry, Ha Ni.

739
00:48:41,304 --> 00:48:43,271
Bye.

740
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:01,904
Where are you going?

741
00:49:01,904 --> 00:49:03,071
I'm going to go get food.

742
00:49:03,071 --> 00:49:05,104
I'll make it!

743
00:49:05,437 --> 00:49:08,237
As a thank you for yesterday as well as today.

744
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:09,737
You're going to?

745
00:49:09,737 --> 00:49:11,537
What's with you?

746
00:49:11,537 --> 00:49:14,137
Even though I look like this,
I am Oh Gi Dong's daughter!

747
00:49:16,171 --> 00:49:18,904
Always treating me like an idiot.

748
00:49:18,904 --> 00:49:21,804
This time...

749
00:49:23,704 --> 00:49:27,371
"Hawaiian Loco Moco"?

750
00:49:29,437 --> 00:49:30,937
"On a bed of warm rice..."

751
00:49:30,937 --> 00:49:34,171
"...place a thick patty of meat."

752
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:35,404
"Pour a generous amount..."

753
00:49:35,404 --> 00:49:37,404
"...of gravy sauce."

754
00:49:37,404 --> 00:49:39,671
"Place a sunny side up fried egg on top."

755
00:49:39,671 --> 00:49:44,004
"The point is to dip the meat in the yolk."

756
00:49:47,304 --> 00:49:49,571
Awesome!

757
00:49:50,771 --> 00:49:56,604
Baek Seung Jo, you're going
to be absolutely amazed.

758
00:50:08,653 --> 00:50:11,353
What? The big problem was this?

759
00:50:12,062 --> 00:50:14,309
Mom's good at acting, isn't she?

760
00:50:14,309 --> 00:50:18,164
The bank lady called. She must be
wondering what I was talking about.

761
00:50:18,164 --> 00:50:21,420
You told me to come here all of a sudden,
so I thought something had happened too.

762
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,553
But something did happen.

763
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:25,753
Her whole class came over.

764
00:50:26,657 --> 00:50:28,253
Oh really.

765
00:50:28,253 --> 00:50:30,279
Hey, Ha Ni is something else.

766
00:50:30,279 --> 00:50:34,320
That's what I said. Ha Ni, she's got strength.

767
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,486
She's got bad grades. All she has is strength.

768
00:50:37,486 --> 00:50:40,086
Hey, you rascal!

769
00:50:40,086 --> 00:50:43,302
Are you just going to keep saying what's true?

770
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:52,920
Oh, that picture?

771
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:57,445
We took it right in front here, when we were
going to start remodeling the restaurant.

772
00:50:57,445 --> 00:51:01,886
It was around the time my wife passed away
so Ha Ni must have been...

773
00:51:01,886 --> 00:51:04,062
...it was when she was four years old.

774
00:51:06,334 --> 00:51:09,386
You're not interested in getting remarried?

775
00:51:10,853 --> 00:51:14,304
Well, if someone as great as you appears.

776
00:51:15,601 --> 00:51:20,220
But really, if Ha Ni gets married,
you'll be lonely by yourself.

777
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,420
Married?

778
00:51:23,587 --> 00:51:26,886
Just hearing the word brings tears to my eyes.

779
00:51:28,324 --> 00:51:30,092
There's no need for that!

780
00:51:30,092 --> 00:51:31,820
We can live together!

781
00:51:32,986 --> 00:51:34,425
Huh?

782
00:51:39,186 --> 00:51:43,186
Then again, I don't know if we should
leave those two alone like that.

783
00:51:43,186 --> 00:51:47,753
I left the two home on purpose.

784
00:51:50,086 --> 00:51:52,831
The air between those two seemed so bad.

785
00:51:52,831 --> 00:52:01,220
Guys and girls, if they're alone,
it all works itself out naturally.

786
00:52:07,186 --> 00:52:09,920
Hey, are you going to give me food or not?

787
00:52:12,819 --> 00:52:14,820
Hey, what's happening?

788
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:17,020
I'm sorry.

789
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:20,186
It' got slightly burned.

790
00:52:26,885 --> 00:52:31,353
This burnt thing, what is it supposed to be?

791
00:52:33,886 --> 00:52:38,053
Hawaiian Loco Moco.

792
00:52:39,795 --> 00:52:42,020
Hawaiian what?

793
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,486
Loco Moco.

794
00:52:51,753 --> 00:52:54,232
This is only slightly burned?

795
00:53:00,753 --> 00:53:03,753
This isn't dinner, this is just mush.

796
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,720
Why?

797
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,853
You don't like mush?

798
00:53:07,853 --> 00:53:09,353
Hey!

799
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,220
Are you telling me to eat this right now?

800
00:53:26,853 --> 00:53:28,120
When do we spray this on?

801
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,153
Just bring the water.

802
00:53:30,153 --> 00:53:31,253
Yes.

803
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,020
Wow.

804
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,020
It's amazing.

805
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:46,820
It's just like the ones in a restaurant.

806
00:53:56,386 --> 00:53:58,053
It's really good!

807
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:03,353
How did you cook the egg so it's so soft?

808
00:54:03,353 --> 00:54:04,886
And so quickly!

809
00:54:04,886 --> 00:54:06,053
It didn't even take 30 minutes.

810
00:54:06,053 --> 00:54:08,020
Because I'm smart.

811
00:54:08,553 --> 00:54:10,320
Huh?

812
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,853
Cooking is all smarts too.

813
00:54:13,853 --> 00:54:16,986
Ah, really?

814
00:54:16,986 --> 00:54:20,085
Then my dad must be super smart.

815
00:54:23,553 --> 00:54:26,620
Then is Bong Joon Gu smart too?

816
00:54:30,086 --> 00:54:33,038
Joon Gu is really good at cooking too.

817
00:54:33,038 --> 00:54:34,120
No way.

818
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,920
It's true.

819
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:41,219
He sold Dduk Bokk Gi and Ma Tang
for the festival and it was totally good.

820
00:54:41,219 --> 00:54:42,486
Hey!

821
00:54:42,486 --> 00:54:43,766
Is making Dduk Bokk Gi cooking?

822
00:54:43,766 --> 00:54:45,920
It is. Those types of food are the hardest.

823
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,435
The dishes that are eaten by a lot of people,
it's hard to accommodate each person's tastes.

824
00:54:49,435 --> 00:54:53,847
Even the Ma Tang, the outside was
really crispy and the inside so very soft.

825
00:54:53,847 --> 00:54:57,720
You know how typically it's
really mushy and sticky--

826
00:55:00,286 --> 00:55:02,281
You're already done?

827
00:55:02,281 --> 00:55:04,986
I only had a spoonful!

828
00:55:06,286 --> 00:55:09,186
Clean it all up, and do the dishes too!

829
00:55:14,953 --> 00:55:18,714
I really only had one bite.

830
00:55:20,777 --> 00:55:21,970
[So Pal Bok Noodles]

831
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:23,806
Thank you!

832
00:55:33,959 --> 00:55:36,177
Let's go to Noraebong (karaoke)!

833
00:55:36,177 --> 00:55:37,731
Noraebong?

834
00:55:38,953 --> 00:55:41,786
I'm tired, let's go home.

835
00:55:41,786 --> 00:55:44,386
It's only 10:00!

836
00:55:44,802 --> 00:55:47,820
Let's go to Noraebong.

837
00:55:49,186 --> 00:55:50,495
Noraebong?

838
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:59,209
Oh my, seems like you're having fun.

839
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:03,886
I can't, I have an important English test.

840
00:56:03,886 --> 00:56:05,897
I've got to prepare for it.

841
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:12,286
Don't worry about me and have fun.

842
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,420
Teddy.

843
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:29,774
Though he's always so fussy,
he still does everything.

844
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,720
Where did my English book go?!

845
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,669
Why is that the only one missing?

846
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:53,107
"Talk all night! Get married!"

847
00:56:56,816 --> 00:56:58,720
No one can see that!

848
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,439
It's so embarassing!

849
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:22,420
Oh, yeah! He's sleeping.

850
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:25,732
You rascal, so nice of you!

851
00:57:55,886 --> 00:57:59,320
Where is it?

852
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:20,300
He sleeps so beautifully.

853
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:32,386
What is this?

854
00:58:32,386 --> 00:58:35,286
He only reads the original editions?

855
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:50,220
Why are you acting like a thief?

856
00:58:51,686 --> 00:58:54,553
That's not it. I had to look for something.

857
00:58:55,486 --> 00:58:57,620
Do you expect me to believe that?

858
00:58:58,913 --> 00:59:02,753
Of all times, when no one was
in the house but the two of us,

859
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:04,553
you suddenly have something to look for?

860
00:59:04,553 --> 00:59:05,920
What?

861
00:59:07,486 --> 00:59:08,996
No. Really.

862
00:59:13,386 --> 00:59:15,433
Bong Joon Gu said...

863
00:59:15,433 --> 00:59:18,820
...that we're all puberty stricken 18 year olds.

864
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:21,386
Why are you acting like this?

865
00:59:21,386 --> 00:59:23,180
What do you mean "why are you acting like this"?

866
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:25,786
Isn't this why you came in here?

867
00:59:25,786 --> 00:59:26,827
What?

868
00:59:26,827 --> 00:59:28,886
No way!

869
00:59:28,886 --> 00:59:30,978
What's it matter?

870
00:59:30,978 --> 00:59:34,720
We're the only ones in the house right now.

871
00:59:37,753 --> 00:59:40,253
Seung Jo, why are you acting like this?

872
00:59:41,486 --> 00:59:43,686
Seung Jo ssi!

873
01:00:06,514 --> 01:00:08,886
What major?

874
01:00:08,886 --> 01:00:10,120
Why would you go to university?

875
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:13,920
When you find something you like,
your heart starts to beat fast.

876
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:15,753
What's going on?

877
01:00:17,253 --> 01:00:18,524
Shut up!

878
01:00:18,524 --> 01:00:20,486
I knew we would be far apart.

879
01:00:20,486 --> 01:00:21,153
Hello?

880
01:00:21,153 --> 01:00:24,079
Yes, yes, yes, I will go!

881
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,053
I'll be there! Thank you!

882
01:00:27,992 --> 01:00:29,286
Where are you?

883
01:00:29,286 --> 01:00:32,653
Ha Ni, why don't you go in first for now?

884
01:00:33,986 --> 01:00:34,501
You got it!

885
01:00:34,501 --> 01:00:35,220
You got it!

886
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:37,466
Seung Jo got it for me.

887
01:00:37,466 --> 01:00:39,759
Do you think I won this so I could play with it?

888
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:45,286
If you come to my university,
I could keep you entertained.

889
01:00:45,646 --> 01:00:48,486
You're going to take the exam tomorrow, right?

890
01:00:48,586 --> 01:00:50,112
Did you catch a cold?

891
01:00:50,112 --> 01:00:52,720
This won't make me drowsy, right?

892
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,520
I hear you fed Seung Jo Oppa sleeping pills.

893
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,120
Please tell me it's not like that.

894
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:00,953
That nothing happened.
