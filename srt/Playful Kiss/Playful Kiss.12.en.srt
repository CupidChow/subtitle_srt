1
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,100
You are leaving already?

2
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:49,900
It's late so just sleep over.

3
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:51,733
No, thanks.

4
00:00:51,733 --> 00:00:55,767
I have some books to look over, so I'll just go.

5
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,700
Hey...

6
00:00:59,467 --> 00:01:02,682
You should stop, and move back in now.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I know you are living on your own to find your goal in life,

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,167
but what about my dream of living happily together, all of us, and living a bustling life?

9
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:20,233
Your being like this is making it hard on Ha Ni as well.

10
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:26,300
From her perspective she may be thinking that she is the reason why you won't come home,

11
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,467
so be a little more nurturing and caring of her.

12
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:34,367
Please allow me to make my own decisions regarding my life.

13
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,100
Seung Jo...

14
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:38,433
I did not want to stay in this house, that's why I left.

15
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:44,433
You brought Ha Ni back in without even asking, or considering my feelings on the matter.

16
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:46,500
Because of that, do whatever you want Mother.

17
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,700
Baek Seung Jo...

18
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,967
I am sorry.
I am leaving now.

19
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:55,167
Enjoy the meal!

20
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:57,967
We will eat well!

21
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:00,933
Ah! It's hot.

22
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:03,110
What's wrong with your hand?

23
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,000
Housewife's eczema.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,667
This is what happens when you wash the hair of 50 people a day.
Oh my gosh...

25
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:17,600
Oh man does not it hurt?
Yeah it hurts it itches, hurts, and is driving me insane!

26
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:23,233
But it's better than sitting in class studying boring material!

27
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:25,533
I am still happy!

28
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:27,967
How is it?

29
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:28,733
Is it good?

30
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:30,567
Yes.
Yes, it's really good.

31
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,313
But dad...

32
00:02:31,313 --> 00:02:31,963
Huh?

33
00:02:31,963 --> 00:02:33,267
I do not see Joon Gu.

34
00:02:33,267 --> 00:02:36,933
That kid has recently fallen in love with the art of cooking.

35
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:40,100
He's gone to the market to go personally pick and choose his own ingredients.

36
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,967
Is that really our Bong Joon Gu?

37
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,000
That's really different from back when he was in High School

38
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:49,632
Did you guys hear?

39
00:02:49,632 --> 00:02:50,433
About what?

40
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,100
Our high school reunion thing?

41
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,000
Reunion?

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,800
They have a dress code with a theme of school look.

43
00:02:58,067 --> 00:02:59,867
I heard it too.

44
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:04,400
I heard. But I am in trouble, because all my uniforms have gotten smaller because I've gained weight.

45
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,133
I do not know whose idea it is, but I love it.

46
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:11,600
Our memorable uniforms...

47
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,267
Seung Jo looked good in his uniform.

48
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:17,700
Especially the winter uniforms.

49
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,900
Baek Seung Jo again?

50
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:36,900
You heard about it?

51
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,700
What?

52
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,733
That there's a high school reunion, and the dress code is our old uniforms. Isn't that a fun idea?

53
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:47,633
Who gave such a childish idea?

54
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,800
I heard it and I do not have any interest in it.

55
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,367
Still,

56
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:57,600
I am already excited about meeting my old school mates.

57
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,000
Are not you curious about how they are doing?

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,167
If you are interested then go.

59
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:05,900
Really that brat...

60
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,300
I just can not figure out what he is thinking.

61
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:21,433
Seung Jo said he wouldn't go?

62
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:22,300
Yes...

63
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,567
Yes, he said it was childish.

64
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:27,533
Why is he like that?

65
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:31,381
I totally miss those youthful days.

66
00:04:31,381 --> 00:04:40,444
It was blind dating! Until I ate the whole plate, that male student could not bring himself to say a word.

67
00:04:40,444 --> 00:04:43,211
So I told him to have some.

68
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:49,128
He was like "Yes!" and started gulping down all the water.

69
00:04:49,128 --> 00:04:51,421
You were only in high school?!

70
00:04:51,421 --> 00:04:52,430
Yes.

71
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,777
Yes, I am talking about your dad! Student Baek Soo Chang!

72
00:04:56,777 --> 00:04:59,577
Back then he was so cute!

73
00:04:59,577 --> 00:05:06,244
For me, I can not forget how Seung Jo looked at graduation night when he did his speech!

74
00:05:06,244 --> 00:05:10,077
I am going to have fun
and I am going to be happy.

75
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:11,419
I am going to live like that.

76
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:17,426
Everybody, where ever you going to be, live having fun.

77
00:05:18,383 --> 00:05:24,444
Omo, Ha Ni! I have thought of a good idea that would make Seung Jo want to attend the high school reunion.

78
00:05:24,444 --> 00:05:26,220
Really?

79
00:05:27,044 --> 00:05:28,744
What is that smell?

80
00:05:29,577 --> 00:05:31,277
Oh my!

81
00:05:32,977 --> 00:05:35,177
What to do?!

82
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,600
Mhm! What is it? Ahh.. heh

83
00:06:36,744 --> 00:06:40,644
The thing that allowed me to meet Seung Jo in my dream

84
00:06:40,644 --> 00:06:43,243
was the leaf.

85
00:07:08,477 --> 00:07:13,854
But still, he did not give me an F mark.

86
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,111
Parang High School's 14th Graduating Class Reunion

87
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:18,311
You have become much prettier.

88
00:07:18,311 --> 00:07:21,042
Where are you going?

89
00:07:30,811 --> 00:07:34,082
Did Seung Jo come?

90
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:36,211
Ha Ni!

91
00:07:37,577 --> 00:07:39,077
Why are you so late?

92
00:07:39,077 --> 00:07:41,811
Yeah! You do not even answer your cell phone!

93
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:43,277
My mother told me to leave my cell phone at home.

94
00:07:43,277 --> 00:07:46,009
Hand phone?
Why?

95
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:50,011
I do not know. I think she has something planned.

96
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:54,631
But, it's strange coming here wearing our school uniforms. Yeah?

97
00:07:54,631 --> 00:08:00,444
Why? Is not it thrillng and fun as if we are ditching, which we never got to do in high school?

98
00:08:00,444 --> 00:08:02,425
You never ditched?

99
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:03,811
I said I never was able to do it wearing my uniform.

100
00:08:03,811 --> 00:08:04,644
Hmm...

101
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:07,844
Hey, what about Joon Gu?

102
00:08:07,844 --> 00:08:11,911
Ah, there was a group reservation at the restaurant, so he could not come.

103
00:08:11,911 --> 00:08:15,344
Oooo he is a real chef now?

104
00:08:15,377 --> 00:08:16,811
Seriously.

105
00:08:17,577 --> 00:08:22,144
But... Seung Jo... did not come?

106
00:08:22,144 --> 00:08:26,811
Aigoo! If you are here to see Seung Jo, then why did not you search for him already?

107
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:28,344
He is already here.
Over there.

108
00:08:28,344 --> 00:08:32,377
He looks completely uncomfortable.

109
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:37,544
Oh! He is here!
Then I am only going to greet him for a bit.

110
00:08:37,544 --> 00:08:39,577
Only greet him?

111
00:08:46,977 --> 00:08:49,811
You said you would not come, but you did.

112
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:51,977
Why did you leave home without your cell phone?

113
00:08:51,977 --> 00:08:53,148
Huh?

114
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:56,411
That...

115
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:07,044
Mother had to quickly leave for Busan to meet her family and you left your keys at home.

116
00:09:07,044 --> 00:09:09,011
She told me to give them to you, so I came.

117
00:09:09,011 --> 00:09:11,011
I did not...

118
00:09:13,444 --> 00:09:18,077
Ah.. sorry. Looks like you went out of your way because of me.

119
00:09:18,077 --> 00:09:22,877
Thank you. Without you I would not
have been able to enter the house tonight.

120
00:09:26,577 --> 00:09:31,411
Well since you are here, spend some time with friends.

121
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:32,977
No need.

122
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,204
Baek Seung Jo where you going?

123
00:09:37,204 --> 00:09:39,962
Sit down, Sit down.
It's been really a long time.

124
00:09:39,962 --> 00:09:41,362
Long time no see, how have you been?

125
00:09:41,362 --> 00:09:44,066
You are the same as always.

126
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:45,388
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

127
00:09:45,388 --> 00:09:50,897
You punk, it would've been so great if we went to DaeSung University together.

128
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,599
That's Oh Han Ni right?

129
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:55,443
Has she become your girlfriend?

130
00:09:55,443 --> 00:09:59,047
Wow Oh Ha Ni, I guess personality does win it.

131
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:03,938
She's been following you around so long, and eventually even got into Parang University and made it happen!

132
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:07,884
What an annoying girlfriend. I don't think that kind is cute.

133
00:10:07,884 --> 00:10:12,282
Then again, I guess a girlfriend doesn't really fit with the almighty Baek Seung Jo.

134
00:10:12,282 --> 00:10:16,826
I see, so Class 7's Oh Ha Ni.

135
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:19,173
But Baek Seung Jo, what's your major?

136
00:10:19,173 --> 00:10:20,092
There's no such thing. I'm undecided.

137
00:10:20,092 --> 00:10:22,992
You mean you still haven't decided on a major?

138
00:10:22,992 --> 00:10:24,178
Not yet.

139
00:10:24,178 --> 00:10:26,650
You can inherit your father's company.

140
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,690
Isn't the Chairman's position just waiting for you?

141
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,857
Parang High's best band!

142
00:10:33,857 --> 00:10:36,513
Taking over the Hong Dae indie band scene...

143
00:10:36,513 --> 00:10:39,313
Annyong Bada!

144
00:11:43,313 --> 00:11:48,680
He should have enjoyed seeing his classmates after a long time.
But he left without a word...

145
00:12:16,813 --> 00:12:20,213
Seung Jo , I...

146
00:12:20,213 --> 00:12:23,847
I would like it if you would take over my gaming company.

147
00:12:23,847 --> 00:12:30,247
At first as my reliable right-hand man, and later on
I would like it if you could take the company in a new direction with your own abilities.

148
00:12:30,247 --> 00:12:33,466
If you wanted, you could easily become a doctor.

149
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:36,347
So kids like Nu Ri...

150
00:12:36,347 --> 00:12:41,303
I think it would be nice if you became a doctor that fixed the illnesses for many people all around the world.

151
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,780
You forgot this.

152
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:51,447
Thanks.

153
00:12:51,447 --> 00:12:53,347
May I have a seat?

154
00:12:53,347 --> 00:12:55,113
As you wish.

155
00:12:55,113 --> 00:12:56,913
Thank you.

156
00:13:01,713 --> 00:13:03,980
Are you worried about something?

157
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,213
Tell me.

158
00:13:07,213 --> 00:13:15,680
Don't they say sharing worries could halve them and sharing your happiness will double it.

159
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,547
I will help you.

160
00:13:19,947 --> 00:13:26,047
When I'm worrying about something, or if something good happens, I let Min Ah and Ju Ri know.

161
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:28,613
Once I do that, it feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

162
00:13:28,613 --> 00:13:34,580
Then again, sometimes I tell them too much and that becomes a problem.

163
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,247
I'm going to go into the medical field.

164
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:51,747
I'm going to apply to the med program.

165
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:55,000
Though I don't know whether or not it's a good match for me,

166
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,526
I've found a path for myself for the first time.

167
00:13:58,526 --> 00:14:00,573
Seung Jo ah..

168
00:14:02,402 --> 00:14:04,966
Don't tell anyone about it yet.

169
00:14:04,966 --> 00:14:07,799
Especially my parents.

170
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:10,932
Don't go around spreading rumors all over the place either.

171
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:12,768
Do you understand?

172
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,744
Of course...

173
00:14:14,744 --> 00:14:17,498
Why would I spread rumors?

174
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:36,880
Omo!

175
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,432
Then am I the only one who knows that?!

176
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,290
- Dad.
- You're here.

177
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,260
- Did something happen?
- What?

178
00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:00,550
He used to always come running to say hi to you the instant you came.

179
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,660
He's a charming punk.

180
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,090
Joon Gu? Why, what is he doing?

181
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:10,460
Look over into the kitchen.

182
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:14,240
Joon Gu made a dish for a customer today for the first time.

183
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,680
- What? Already?
- Yes.

184
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,160
Then is Joon Gu a chef now?

185
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,690
Normally, you need to learn for a few more years until you can start cooking for customers.

186
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,300
Of course.

187
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:30,210
He may not look it but he's quite talented.

188
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,010
He tries very hard too.

189
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,970
- Hey.
- Yes?

190
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,880
Let's go see him.

191
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,480
I thought Joon Gu was always just playing around,

192
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,380
but I'm seeing a different side to him.

193
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,630
He puts in a lot of effort.

194
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,080
So I told him to try making a dish even though it's a little soon.

195
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,630
But he's very good.

196
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,400
He said he wants you to be the very first to taste it.

197
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,130
Isn't that so sweet?

198
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:13,240
I've never seen Joon Gu working so passionately.

199
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,820
He doesn't even know I'm here.

200
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,250
Here.

201
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,040
It looks delicious.

202
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,990
Here, Ha Ni. Try it.

203
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,210
Thank you for the food.

204
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,710
How is it?

205
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:52,310
Hey. Daebak! It's really delicious, Joon Gu!

206
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,960
- Do you mean it?
- Yes.

207
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,240
It's really delicious! It's the best. You're a real pro now.

208
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,480
Ha Ni.

209
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:06,830
I've always wanted you to be the first person to try my food.

210
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,610
Hold on a second, okay? I have more.

211
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,680
Here. Try this Tri-colored Mandu Kalguksu* too. (T/N: hand-cut noodles with dumplings)

212
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,350
It has green, yellow, and red dumplings.

213
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,420
The combination of it with the chewy noodles is amazing.

214
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,990
I'm sure you'll like it if you try it.

215
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,650
Joon Gu.

216
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,860
Take your time and eat a lot. I've gained confidence now.

217
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,050
I have more. Hold on, okay?

218
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,440
I saw a new side of Joon Gu today.

219
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,880
I always only looked down on him.

220
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,090
I'm sorry, Joon Gu.

221
00:17:58,373 --> 00:18:01,140
Well, members of the tennis club,

222
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,941
I have some really good news to tell you.

223
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:12,482
Next week is the 10th year anniversary of our Top Spin tennis club!

224
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:19,813
So we're thinking of bringing together all the past and current members to host a really great big party.

225
00:18:19,813 --> 00:18:23,180
What do you think? Aren't you excited!?

226
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,835
Next week is a holiday, so do you think Hae Ra will come?

227
00:18:25,835 --> 00:18:28,147
I got it cheaply because of the holidays.

228
00:18:28,147 --> 00:18:30,713
On top of that, a party with past and current members?

229
00:18:30,713 --> 00:18:32,605
I don't even think I want to go.

230
00:18:32,605 --> 00:18:34,030
Really?

231
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,198
Then should I take that part out?

232
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:40,013
I think if you could just get Seung Jo to come somehow,

233
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:42,939
Hae Ra will just come automatically.

234
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:45,813
That's right! This is why you have the right to be the captain!

235
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:48,347
Seung Jo...Hae Ra... That's right!

236
00:18:48,347 --> 00:18:51,463
Then I need to go ask for Ha Ni's advice.

237
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,780
So this is the medical department that Seung Jo is trying to get into.

238
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,981
I hear it's totally busy here.

239
00:19:00,981 --> 00:19:04,547
Doesn't that mean it'll be even harder to see Seung Jo?

240
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,380
Ha Ni! I've been looking for you everywhere.

241
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,780
Sunbae! Sunbae, what are you doing here?

242
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,680
What about you?

243
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,913
At the medical department... I mean I came looking for you.

244
00:19:19,913 --> 00:19:22,380
I'm here because of Seung Jo...

245
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,647
Seung Jo? What about him?

246
00:19:24,647 --> 00:19:28,913
Anyway, why did you come all this way searching for me?

247
00:19:31,947 --> 00:19:36,580
It's nothing big, but next week is our Top Spin's 10th year anniversary.

248
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,813
So I'm planning a party.

249
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:43,165
Planning a party? So why are you telling me...

250
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:45,047
Listen!

251
00:19:45,047 --> 00:19:50,280
For this party, if Seung Jo doesn't show up it becomes a real problem.

252
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,513
Senior, don't tell me you're trying to use Seung Jo again to get to Hye Ra.

253
00:19:54,513 --> 00:19:57,332
You're not trying to use my Seung Jo as bait are you?!

254
00:19:57,332 --> 00:19:59,247
Stop using that method now!

255
00:19:59,247 --> 00:20:00,380
I know...

256
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:05,880
Even if I try this, finding the right timing to confess to Hye Ra would be hard.

257
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,113
I need Seung Jo, so Han Ni, why don't you...

258
00:20:09,113 --> 00:20:10,913
It's Seung jo!

259
00:20:11,713 --> 00:20:13,147
It's Seung Jo.

260
00:20:13,147 --> 00:20:17,113
Ha Ni! This is my last favor. I'm counting on you.

261
00:20:17,113 --> 00:20:19,747
Do you understand? I'm counting on you.

262
00:20:20,747 --> 00:20:22,647
Were you following me?

263
00:20:22,647 --> 00:20:24,313
No.

264
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,813
I really wanted to visit the medical department at least once.

265
00:20:43,813 --> 00:20:46,680
I mean it may be the place you start attending.

266
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:52,080
But it's amazing here. I guess all the people here are going to become doctors in the future.

267
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,113
There are some that don't.

268
00:20:54,113 --> 00:20:57,313
But why did you come here?

269
00:20:57,313 --> 00:20:59,813
It's not time to chose your major yet.

270
00:20:59,813 --> 00:21:01,513
I came to meet a professor.

271
00:21:01,613 --> 00:21:10,447
Oh yeah, today Dad and Ahjushi went to get a check-up at the hospital.

272
00:21:10,447 --> 00:21:12,147
Want to go stop by the house with me later on?

273
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:15,280
What presents will those two bring back this time?

274
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,947
What do you mean present?

275
00:21:17,947 --> 00:21:20,180
Cake?..

276
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,180
Today is your birthday?

277
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,080
Idiot, I mean an illness.

278
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,630
I want coffee.

279
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,663
Not for you.

280
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:42,763
I'm absolutely sick and tired of hospitals now.

281
00:21:42,763 --> 00:21:45,930
So how was it? What about the results?

282
00:21:47,115 --> 00:21:48,263
Here it is.

283
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:49,497
Show me.

284
00:21:49,497 --> 00:21:51,647
Health Examination Results

285
00:21:53,383 --> 00:21:55,463
I can barely understand it.

286
00:21:56,309 --> 00:21:58,497
Induced...

287
00:21:58,497 --> 00:21:59,773
Blood sugar...

288
00:21:59,773 --> 00:22:01,697
It's a cardiac stress test.

289
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:05,063
It's to check for cardiac infarction or angina.

290
00:22:05,063 --> 00:22:06,912
Let me have a look.

291
00:22:09,901 --> 00:22:11,580
Your blood pressure is high.

292
00:22:12,463 --> 00:22:14,064
Your heart rate is high too.

293
00:22:14,064 --> 00:22:16,825
You've got a bit of cardiac stress.

294
00:22:17,572 --> 00:22:21,000
Your cholesterol is high too.

295
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,663
Father,

296
00:22:22,663 --> 00:22:26,640
you have to watch out for your heart.

297
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,268
I heard the exact same thing from the doctor.

298
00:22:29,268 --> 00:22:32,215
Honey, you should be healthy.

299
00:22:32,215 --> 00:22:36,209
You need to think of your family.

300
00:22:36,209 --> 00:22:37,830
Hey, Seung Jo.

301
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,648
How are you so good at it? It's filled with cryptic words!

302
00:22:40,681 --> 00:22:45,701
Hyung could become a doctor too, since he's a genius.

303
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:51,419
Honey from now on you're banned from all things sweet and oily things.

304
00:22:52,481 --> 00:22:55,296
Then what do I eat?

305
00:23:08,457 --> 00:23:09,825
Are you....

306
00:23:09,825 --> 00:23:11,930
waiting for someone?

307
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,523
You're not going to sit?

308
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:27,061
Are you going to go to the 10 year anniversary for the tennis club this week?

309
00:23:28,101 --> 00:23:29,841
Why? Are you curious?

310
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:34,120
It's pertaining to the club and there are going to be a lot of Sunbaes coming,

311
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:39,164
so if possible it would be nice if lots of people attended.

312
00:23:39,164 --> 00:23:45,141
I'm not really interested in a meeting where people gather saying things they don't really mean.

313
00:23:45,141 --> 00:23:46,566
Oh!

314
00:23:46,566 --> 00:23:48,742
Why don't you go and enjoy it for me?

315
00:23:48,742 --> 00:23:51,030
That should do it.

316
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,000
Do you have anything else to tell me?

317
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:57,763
Yes?

318
00:23:57,763 --> 00:23:59,097
Well..

319
00:23:59,097 --> 00:24:01,872
I'm curious about something.

320
00:24:01,872 --> 00:24:04,230
We already talked about the 10 year anniversary.

321
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,600
What is it?

322
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,207
Well.

323
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:11,935
You're undecided on your major, so have you picked one yet?

324
00:24:11,935 --> 00:24:16,363
You're acting funny today.

325
00:24:16,363 --> 00:24:18,354
Why are you curious about my major?

326
00:24:18,354 --> 00:24:20,987
It's just...

327
00:24:20,987 --> 00:24:26,974
To be honest ,you could go anywhere you please as long as you want to, right?

328
00:24:26,974 --> 00:24:28,730
By any chance,

329
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,073
I was wondering if you were going to follow in the foot steps of Seung Jo.

330
00:24:33,584 --> 00:24:35,435
Why do you think about these things?

331
00:24:35,435 --> 00:24:37,307
You're really an idiot.

332
00:24:37,307 --> 00:24:41,301
Just because the person you like is going, doesn't mean you have to go to hell with them too.

333
00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:49,249
Though I'm interested in Seung Jo, I don't care about the major he choses.

334
00:24:49,249 --> 00:24:50,619
I...

335
00:24:51,687 --> 00:24:55,197
will do as I wish,

336
00:24:55,197 --> 00:24:57,724
because it's my life.

337
00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:05,612
You don't always have to be together to date.

338
00:25:05,612 --> 00:25:07,927
Unnie will leave now.

339
00:25:07,927 --> 00:25:09,682
See you.

340
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:15,998
She always ends it like that!

341
00:25:19,212 --> 00:25:20,844
Well..

342
00:25:20,844 --> 00:25:24,830
thinking that way is pretty cool.

343
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,935
Acknowledged.

344
00:25:32,284 --> 00:25:34,133
Pay attention to what you're doing.

345
00:25:39,227 --> 00:25:40,997
What are you doing?

346
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:44,861
If you're going, leave. If you're staying, sit.

347
00:25:49,621 --> 00:25:51,897
Joon Gu

348
00:25:51,897 --> 00:25:55,008
Is still working hard to become a chef.

349
00:25:56,466 --> 00:26:00,330
And Hae Ra has things to do.

350
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,864
And so do Joo Ri and Min Ah.

351
00:26:03,864 --> 00:26:09,776
Even Eun Jo seems to be worrying about his future.

352
00:26:13,508 --> 00:26:18,688
And you have nothing? Is that what you mean?

353
00:26:18,688 --> 00:26:19,970
o?

354
00:26:20,992 --> 00:26:22,199
Yeah.

355
00:26:22,703 --> 00:26:24,305
I envy you.

356
00:26:24,305 --> 00:26:27,544
Your carelessness.

357
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,342
I, too...

358
00:26:30,342 --> 00:26:32,577
have a dream.

359
00:26:32,577 --> 00:26:34,198
But..

360
00:26:34,198 --> 00:26:35,759
what?

361
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,521
Something you want to do with me?

362
00:26:42,674 --> 00:26:44,197
Tell me...

363
00:26:44,197 --> 00:26:46,450
about your dream.

364
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,693
I'll hear you out.

365
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:55,366
You know...

366
00:26:55,366 --> 00:26:58,422
Seung Jo you're the doctor for a small village

367
00:26:58,422 --> 00:27:00,976
and I'm the nurse that helps you.

368
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:06,147
You're famous so you're always at the hospital.

369
00:27:06,147 --> 00:27:08,709
It's not a big hospital like the university ones,

370
00:27:08,709 --> 00:27:12,031
but still, I try my hardest to help you.

371
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:17,617
For example, if you say you want to become a pilot, then I want to become a stewardess.

372
00:27:17,617 --> 00:27:21,465
And if you say you want to become a pro golfer, then I want to become a caddy.

373
00:27:22,122 --> 00:27:25,123
In the end...

374
00:27:25,123 --> 00:27:27,400
My dream is simple

375
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,008
and does whatever it pleases.

376
00:27:30,969 --> 00:27:32,469
I..

377
00:27:32,826 --> 00:27:38,253
am just moving in the direction of Baek Seung Jo, who is at the center of it.

378
00:27:38,253 --> 00:27:41,430
There exists

379
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:44,751
no such thing as myself.

380
00:27:44,751 --> 00:27:47,569
It's exactly as you said.

381
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:52,740
But when I decided to become a doctor,

382
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,852
I thought about it a lot too.

383
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,370
So what?

384
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:00,853
Even an unrealistic dream like that...

385
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:02,618
A dream is still a dream.

386
00:28:02,618 --> 00:28:04,457
It fits you.

387
00:28:04,457 --> 00:28:06,951
Hey!

388
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,609
Is it really that unrealistic?

389
00:28:09,609 --> 00:28:11,852
Do you really think

390
00:28:11,852 --> 00:28:15,542
you could become a nurse just because I'm going to be a doctor?

391
00:28:16,332 --> 00:28:18,205
Then again a dream

392
00:28:18,205 --> 00:28:21,185
the harder it is to attain . . .

393
00:28:21,185 --> 00:28:24,203
the more you want to try it out.

394
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:27,036
Right?

395
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:58,412
Have a seat over there.

396
00:29:04,717 --> 00:29:06,277
Today someone from the university,

397
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:08,483
a medical professor, contacted me.

398
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,000
Ah, that?

399
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:13,483
Is it true that you're going to enter the medical program?

400
00:29:13,483 --> 00:29:14,717
Yes.

401
00:29:14,717 --> 00:29:17,683
I'm planning on entering the medical program starting next semester.

402
00:29:17,683 --> 00:29:18,983
What?

403
00:29:19,517 --> 00:29:24,650
Did you decide on your future without even discussing it with me?!

404
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:27,383
Have you been ignoring what I told you?

405
00:29:28,383 --> 00:29:30,050
He seems to be angry.

406
00:29:30,317 --> 00:29:33,119
I thought about your company too, Father.

407
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:38,150
But like you, Father, and like Ha Ni's father...

408
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:41,250
I've decided I want to put my life on the line in order to do something I want to do.

409
00:29:41,617 --> 00:29:44,083
Seung Jo, what I am saying,

410
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:44,917
my dream is. . .

411
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:48,444
I have decided to become a doctor.

412
00:29:48,444 --> 00:29:51,150
Even if you say anything, it will be of no use.

413
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:55,383
I will not inherit your company.

414
00:29:55,783 --> 00:29:59,217
Seung Jo, what did you just say?

415
00:30:04,917 --> 00:30:06,483
Dad!

416
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,583
Dad!

417
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:10,183
Honey!

418
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,850
Dad!

419
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,350
Dad, what's wrong? Are you in pain?

420
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,583
Honey! Honey, come back to your senses!

421
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:17,850
Dad!

422
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,027
They said it's not life threatening.

423
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:31,217
The examination results are not out yet.

424
00:30:31,217 --> 00:30:35,117
What exactly is wrong?

425
00:30:35,117 --> 00:30:36,483
They say it's angina.

426
00:30:36,483 --> 00:30:38,417
Angina?

427
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:44,350
Then he should have felt symptoms in his chest, feeling really uncomfortable or something.

428
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,783
He must have been pushing himself too hard.

429
00:30:46,783 --> 00:30:49,791
Lately company work has been really hard.

430
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:50,783
I see...

431
00:30:50,783 --> 00:30:53,750
Most importantly his condition needs to stabilize.

432
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,900
He will have to stay at the hospital for the time being.

433
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,250
There are many good doctors here.

434
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:05,250
This person seriously...
Even when he is having such a hard time he won't complain

435
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,950
Since he is always smiling, I didn't know either.

436
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,483
Mother.

437
00:31:14,483 --> 00:31:16,250
Mother.

438
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,650
Oh?

439
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:20,183
I'll be going back first.

440
00:31:20,183 --> 00:31:21,817
Because Eun Jo is alone.

441
00:31:21,817 --> 00:31:24,850
Right. Thank you, Ha Ni.

442
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,350
You have to be careful too, Mother.

443
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:30,650
What if you collapse too?

444
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,317
Ha Ni.

445
00:31:36,483 --> 00:31:39,650
Seung Jo,
you go as well.

446
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,117
Will you be okay?

447
00:31:41,117 --> 00:31:44,317
I'm alright.
Go home.

448
00:31:44,317 --> 00:31:46,283
Alright.

449
00:31:46,283 --> 00:31:49,517
Then, I'll come back tomorrow.

450
00:31:56,404 --> 00:31:58,704
Sunbaenim, aren't you going to eat?

451
00:32:00,121 --> 00:32:02,388
Sunbaenim, you should eat.

452
00:32:08,904 --> 00:32:10,104
Hae Ra.

453
00:32:10,104 --> 00:32:11,770
Sunbae.

454
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:15,137
You didn't come to the 10 year anniversary party.

455
00:32:15,137 --> 00:32:16,737
I never said I was going.

456
00:32:16,737 --> 00:32:18,654
Oh, so that's how it was.

457
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:21,754
I heard the only people that went were you and and the captain.

458
00:32:21,754 --> 00:32:25,521
So I heard the party was a bit down in the dumps.

459
00:32:25,521 --> 00:32:27,488
It turned out like that.

460
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:31,421
So I hear you had to use a lot of your own money.

461
00:32:31,421 --> 00:32:35,254
I wasn't able to attend but I'll pay the fee.

462
00:32:38,454 --> 00:32:40,121
Please accept it.

463
00:32:43,521 --> 00:32:45,088
Thanks.

464
00:32:47,121 --> 00:32:49,454
Is that what you're having for lunch?

465
00:32:49,454 --> 00:32:51,921
Let's go together. I will buy lunch for you today.

466
00:32:51,921 --> 00:32:56,554
Ah, no it's okay.
I really like hot dogs.

467
00:32:56,554 --> 00:32:59,590
And it's made from cow meat,

468
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:03,288
and it's really delicious, and If I have just one I'm full.

469
00:33:05,588 --> 00:33:06,821
Is that so?

470
00:33:08,088 --> 00:33:10,154
Then...

471
00:33:19,054 --> 00:33:20,921
Is it not myocardial infarction (heart attack)?

472
00:33:20,921 --> 00:33:23,788
I don't think it'll turn into a myocardial infarction.

473
00:33:23,788 --> 00:33:26,350
But if he continues to overwork himself like this,

474
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:29,654
there's more than a chance for it to turn into a myocardial infarction.

475
00:33:29,654 --> 00:33:31,721
If that happens the chances of surgery--

476
00:33:31,721 --> 00:33:35,488
There's that method of using the femoral artery and doing a bypass graft.

477
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,788
Oh, you know well.

478
00:33:37,788 --> 00:33:40,654
We would want to avoid that path.

479
00:33:40,654 --> 00:33:44,154
So, with patience, we will treat him with medicine.

480
00:33:44,154 --> 00:33:45,688
Yes.

481
00:33:47,388 --> 00:33:49,065
You came?

482
00:33:49,065 --> 00:33:50,354
Who is he?

483
00:33:50,354 --> 00:33:51,888
He is the manager from your dad's company.

484
00:33:51,888 --> 00:33:54,454
Do you not know that he has to stabilize?

485
00:33:54,454 --> 00:33:55,788
This is totally prohibited.

486
00:33:55,788 --> 00:33:58,354
It seems to be really important work.

487
00:33:58,354 --> 00:33:59,921
Even so.

488
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:02,054
It'll be hard for him to recover like that.

489
00:34:02,054 --> 00:34:06,503
You know how your father can't be at ease if he doesn't make the decision on his own.

490
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:11,088
He's been dead worried about work, that is why he collapsed like that.

491
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:15,688
Chairman
Dad!

492
00:34:15,688 --> 00:34:17,121
Chairman!

493
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:18,121
Honey, what's wrong?

494
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:18,654
Dad!

495
00:34:18,654 --> 00:34:20,694
Honey!

496
00:35:02,821 --> 00:35:06,621
That was a close one.

497
00:35:09,221 --> 00:35:12,567
There's not many days left until the game is released.

498
00:35:13,539 --> 00:35:16,854
After your father collapsed

499
00:35:16,854 --> 00:35:23,221
the game developer left and vanished.

500
00:35:24,254 --> 00:35:29,654
He heard that and that's why he collapsed.

501
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:35,254
What should we do?

502
00:35:35,254 --> 00:35:38,821
Your father is just laying there

503
00:35:38,821 --> 00:35:41,721
and his company is not in good shape.

504
00:35:43,554 --> 00:35:45,688
I will have to go.

505
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:47,454
Seung Jo.

506
00:35:47,454 --> 00:35:50,654
I'm still young and have no experience,

507
00:35:50,654 --> 00:35:55,354
but I'll take care of the company until Dad's health gets better.

508
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:59,321
Thank you Seung Jo.

509
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:07,088
Seung Jo said he would work in the company?

510
00:36:07,088 --> 00:36:08,754
That's right.

511
00:36:08,754 --> 00:36:12,821
Seung Jo's dad was happy and his condition is getting more stable.

512
00:36:12,821 --> 00:36:14,288
He is getting better.

513
00:36:14,288 --> 00:36:16,254
That's great.

514
00:36:16,254 --> 00:36:20,554
And Seung Jo is returning to the house too.

515
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:25,421
He's doing as his father wished. I guess this is what you call turning a misfortune into an advantage.

516
00:36:25,421 --> 00:36:30,488
Ha Ni I'm going to go to the hospital.

517
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:35,121
Will it be okay, that I'm leaving everything to you?

518
00:36:35,121 --> 00:36:37,554
Yes, don't worry.

519
00:36:37,554 --> 00:36:40,288
Right, I'll leave it to you.

520
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:48,117
Ha Ni this is your chance when there's no one to interfere!

521
00:36:48,117 --> 00:36:52,554
Try experiencing what it feels like to be on your honeymoon!

522
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:05,270
Not that part. Check this part here.

523
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:10,070
I think we should go from here, starting from the left.

524
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:15,654
Aigoo, you arrived?

525
00:37:19,788 --> 00:37:23,421
Everyone, Chairman's stand-in is here.

526
00:37:23,421 --> 00:37:24,521
Say hello.

527
00:37:24,521 --> 00:37:26,721
How do you do!

528
00:37:26,721 --> 00:37:30,654
A gaming company's atmosphere is a bit like this...

529
00:37:30,654 --> 00:37:32,688
Ah, yes.

530
00:37:32,688 --> 00:37:34,454
It's good.

531
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:38,954
This way. Please come this way.

532
00:37:40,754 --> 00:37:43,054
Get up please.

533
00:37:47,935 --> 00:37:49,307
Did you see him smile?

534
00:37:49,307 --> 00:37:50,693
Ah, it's Yon-sama!

535
00:37:50,693 --> 00:37:53,294
They say his IQ is 200.

536
00:37:53,294 --> 00:37:57,563
Aigoo, he's not going to fire me because I'm old right?

537
00:37:57,563 --> 00:38:00,831
You should get ready.

538
00:38:00,892 --> 00:38:05,147
Here are the documents regarding our company as well as new games.

539
00:38:05,147 --> 00:38:10,291
Please look over this material. Should we have the meeting around 11?

540
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,502
There's quite a lot.

541
00:38:12,502 --> 00:38:14,963
Is that so? I'll try to read it fast.

542
00:38:14,963 --> 00:38:16,485
Yes. Then...

543
00:38:17,021 --> 00:38:18,193
Manager.

544
00:38:18,193 --> 00:38:19,375
Yes?

545
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:21,193
When we're together, please speak comfortably.

546
00:38:21,193 --> 00:38:26,098
Oh no, you are here as the interim CEO.

547
00:38:26,098 --> 00:38:27,631
Then, I will be leaving.

548
00:38:33,175 --> 00:38:35,840
Manager, he didn't talk about restructuring right?

549
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,240
Does he have a girlfriend? Is he dating anyone?

550
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,689
- Are we going to get fired?
- How was he?

551
00:38:38,689 --> 00:38:42,168
Aigoo, do not worry about other people is business and just focus on your work.

552
00:38:42,168 --> 00:38:44,073
- It's because we are worried!
- Get back to work!

553
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,484
No, have you looked through all those documents?

554
00:39:02,484 --> 00:39:05,607
This is the data that is compared to last year's data?

555
00:39:05,607 --> 00:39:07,753
Yes, that's correct.

556
00:39:07,753 --> 00:39:09,873
It looks like the profit has dropped significantly this year.

557
00:39:09,873 --> 00:39:13,473
I think we may have been affected by the large scale push by international gaming companies.

558
00:39:13,473 --> 00:39:15,340
Simply put,

559
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,140
at this state, we are in a dangerous stage.

560
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:23,493
To add to that, the new game that was supposed to launch is gone as well. We're on thin ice.

561
00:39:23,493 --> 00:39:26,786
If we continue like this it'll be an operational crisis.

562
00:39:26,786 --> 00:39:30,273
We're in a situation where even a merger is impossible.

563
00:39:30,273 --> 00:39:34,807
Without some major support we may just...

564
00:39:44,005 --> 00:39:47,145
Eun Jo, you're really hungry, right? It'll be done in a few minutes.

565
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:50,240
Let's just order...

566
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,473
What are you talking about?

567
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:53,276
Restaurant food is high in calories.

568
00:39:53,276 --> 00:39:54,739
With oil and salt,

569
00:39:54,739 --> 00:39:56,607
you don't know how much they put in it.

570
00:39:56,607 --> 00:39:58,173
And on top of that, they don't put much vegetables.

571
00:39:58,173 --> 00:39:59,976
I got it, alright! Hurry up!

572
00:40:03,173 --> 00:40:05,940
Next time, don't pretend like you know everything.

573
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,173
Why don't you studying cooking?

574
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,440
Oh. What do I do?

575
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,723
What are you going to do if you get both me and Hyung sick too?!

576
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,448
Seung Jo has arrived.

577
00:40:21,435 --> 00:40:23,107
You did well.

578
00:40:23,107 --> 00:40:23,940
Are you very tired?

579
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,607
Hurry and change your clothing. Shower?

580
00:40:30,973 --> 00:40:32,740
What are you doing?

581
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,340
I am taking off your jacket.

582
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,373
Why are you doing that?

583
00:40:36,373 --> 00:40:39,607
What do you mean? She is acting like a new bride.

584
00:40:40,407 --> 00:40:42,107
What are you saying?

585
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:44,107
Ahjusshi is at the hospital.

586
00:40:44,107 --> 00:40:48,173
How could I be thinking such indecent thoughts?

587
00:40:49,173 --> 00:40:52,040
You really are an indecent person.

588
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,173
Go get changed quickly!

589
00:41:07,973 --> 00:41:14,540
Today's menu is seasoned taro, grilled mackerel, and bean paste stew.

590
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,340
Eun Jo, eat it.

591
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,740
Here.

592
00:41:23,073 --> 00:41:27,240
Oh gosh it's salty. Did you pour in the whole bottle of salt?!

593
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:31,273
Hyung, this does not taste good. So, I suggest that you do not eat this.

594
00:41:34,173 --> 00:41:36,107
That sound...

595
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,473
The taro.

596
00:41:38,473 --> 00:41:41,873
Taro makes a sound like that?

597
00:41:41,873 --> 00:41:45,273
It's not fully cooked Hyung! Hurry and spit it out!

598
00:41:51,173 --> 00:41:52,840
Do not force yourself.

599
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,107
He swallowed it. Hyung, you'll get a stomach ache!

600
00:41:57,107 --> 00:41:58,973
Baek Eun Jo,

601
00:41:58,973 --> 00:42:00,707
do not just complain.

602
00:42:00,707 --> 00:42:02,706
Hurry and eat it.

603
00:42:02,706 --> 00:42:06,740
Eat it? Which one?

604
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:11,373
Try poking it with your chopsticks and just eat the ones that are cooked.

605
00:42:26,973 --> 00:42:29,707
Even with a horrible meal,

606
00:42:29,707 --> 00:42:35,207
Seung Jo did not complain even once and just ate it.

607
00:42:42,773 --> 00:42:44,373
Oh, Ha Ni!

608
00:42:45,607 --> 00:42:47,007
It's Ha Ni?

609
00:42:47,007 --> 00:42:49,440
What, packed lunch?

610
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,673
Why would you need to pack a lunch?!

611
00:42:50,673 --> 00:42:52,073
Ah, Ha Ni's making packed lunch?

612
00:42:52,073 --> 00:42:54,440
How in the world could she do such a thing with such soft hands?!

613
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,440
You're going to what?! I'm on the phone!

614
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,307
Yes, okay.

615
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,107
Seung Jo and Eun Jo's lunches.

616
00:43:05,107 --> 00:43:06,807
Oh. Egg rolls?

617
00:43:06,807 --> 00:43:08,140
- Egg rolls?
- Egg rolls?!

618
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,340
How can you not be able to make something that easy?!

619
00:43:14,407 --> 00:43:17,907
Our Ha Ni is making Baek Seung Jo's lunch?

620
00:43:23,073 --> 00:43:27,340
You're out already. Did you grab your handkerchief? What about your wallet?

621
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,740
I have it.

622
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,240
Here. Take this.

623
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,840
What is it?

624
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,907
What do you mean? It's lunch.

625
00:43:35,907 --> 00:43:39,007
I'm going to eat at the cafeteria, so it's fine.

626
00:43:39,007 --> 00:43:41,973
No, don't eat that stuff.

627
00:43:41,973 --> 00:43:44,473
I woke up at the break of dawn and prepared this.

628
00:43:44,473 --> 00:43:47,940
The egg rolls are the point. When you open it, you'll be totally surprised.

629
00:43:53,607 --> 00:43:55,173
See you!

630
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,907
See you.

631
00:43:58,907 --> 00:44:01,340
You probably want to call him "hubby!"

632
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:02,407
What are you talking about?

633
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:04,940
Ahjushi is ill. That's so indecent.

634
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,973
New bride Ha Ni, a nickname given to yourself.

635
00:44:07,973 --> 00:44:10,107
I, too, will see you later.

636
00:44:10,107 --> 00:44:12,673
Goodness that youngster just says the darnest things.

637
00:44:12,673 --> 00:44:14,207
Do a good job!

638
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,740
Ha Ni!

639
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,240
Oh.

640
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,540
Come with me for a second.

641
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,240
Oh, I have class...

642
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,040
It'll just take a second.

643
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,273
Is it true that Seung Jo's father has been hospitalized?

644
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,107
That...

645
00:44:32,373 --> 00:44:33,840
But you can't visit him!

646
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,773
He needs to be stabilized. Visitors are prohibited.

647
00:44:39,273 --> 00:44:41,340
How's Seung Jo doing?

648
00:44:45,007 --> 00:44:48,507
I am assuming Seung Jo is not allowed to visit either, right?

649
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:53,073
He is currently working at Ahjushi's company.

650
00:44:54,807 --> 00:44:57,273
That's why I have not been able to see him.

651
00:44:58,773 --> 00:45:00,573
Thanks.

652
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,373
Yes?

653
00:45:20,373 --> 00:45:22,607
Are you eating lunch?

654
00:45:22,607 --> 00:45:24,473
Yes. Why don't you join me?

655
00:45:24,473 --> 00:45:27,240
No. It's okay. Enjoy.

656
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,007
It's a packed lunch.

657
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:33,007
Did your girlfriend prepare that?

658
00:45:33,007 --> 00:45:34,607
What?

659
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:37,740
Well then, I'll come back after lunch.

660
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:38,940
Yes.

661
00:45:41,073 --> 00:45:44,707
Alright, a delivery of a special lunch box!

662
00:45:46,173 --> 00:45:49,007
Oh, hey, hey!

663
00:45:49,007 --> 00:45:51,207
Do not eat that.

664
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:52,973
Bong Joon Gu. What are you doing?

665
00:45:52,973 --> 00:45:57,140
I can not allow you to eat lunch that Ha Ni packed for you.

666
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,907
Instead, you...

667
00:45:59,907 --> 00:46:01,307
eat this.

668
00:46:02,173 --> 00:46:02,840
Grilled eel?

669
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:07,273
From now on, I will come to this company everyday for the packed lunch Ha Ni made.

670
00:46:07,273 --> 00:46:10,207
I won't leave you alone if you eat the lunch. Ha Ni's packed lunch is for me.

671
00:46:10,207 --> 00:46:12,407
Well then, thank you.

672
00:46:13,473 --> 00:46:16,740
You did not poison this did you?

673
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,907
I do not play with fresh food!

674
00:46:20,907 --> 00:46:22,473
I'll enjoy.

675
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,306
Do not waste any of the eel and eat it all up.

676
00:46:38,673 --> 00:46:40,940
Let's take a look.

677
00:46:42,173 --> 00:46:44,407
It's not bad.

678
00:46:49,607 --> 00:46:52,573
Seeing Ha Ni's heart for Baek Seung Jo,

679
00:46:52,573 --> 00:46:55,907
My heart is ripping apart.

680
00:46:56,907 --> 00:47:00,840
But then again, I get to try out the lunch that Ha Ni made.

681
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,673
Alright.

682
00:47:04,407 --> 00:47:06,340
Let's try this.

683
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:12,340
Ha Ni, I'm going to relish this.

684
00:47:25,273 --> 00:47:29,907
Oh Ha Ni, do you truthfully dislike Baek Seung Jo?

685
00:47:29,907 --> 00:47:33,740
How can you possibly feed him this?!

686
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:40,273
But still, Ha Ni made it so I need to eat it.

687
00:47:41,007 --> 00:47:43,473
Oh, I don't think I can eat this.

688
00:47:52,107 --> 00:47:57,140
What are you doing this late at night without the lights turned on?

689
00:47:58,073 --> 00:47:59,740
I am thinking.

690
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,273
What's the matter?

691
00:48:05,273 --> 00:48:07,840
What's bothering you?

692
00:48:10,573 --> 00:48:13,207
I can help...

693
00:48:15,607 --> 00:48:17,607
Probably not, right?

694
00:48:17,607 --> 00:48:20,207
Then, I am going to sleep first.

695
00:48:20,207 --> 00:48:22,073
Father's not doing well.

696
00:48:22,073 --> 00:48:22,973
Huh?

697
00:48:22,973 --> 00:48:25,307
He might need surgery

698
00:48:25,307 --> 00:48:27,173
Heart surgery?

699
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,207
That's such

700
00:48:30,973 --> 00:48:32,940
a big surgery.

701
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:38,507
I might need to continue working at my father's company for the time being.

702
00:48:38,507 --> 00:48:42,273
It's just too much for father to handle.

703
00:48:42,273 --> 00:48:44,373
Then,

704
00:48:44,373 --> 00:48:46,207
what about getting into medical school?

705
00:48:46,973 --> 00:48:49,107
There is no reason that I have to go there.

706
00:48:49,107 --> 00:48:51,073
There is.

707
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,007
This is the first time, is not it,

708
00:48:57,007 --> 00:49:00,373
that you wanted to do something, your dream.

709
00:49:01,273 --> 00:49:06,540
It's not much of a dream. Though I was smitten by it for a bit.

710
00:49:08,473 --> 00:49:11,573
But once I do get into it...

711
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:13,473
I do not know how it's going to be.

712
00:49:14,407 --> 00:49:18,073
Is it fun working at the company?

713
00:49:18,073 --> 00:49:18,973
No, it's not.

714
00:49:18,973 --> 00:49:23,873
Then, what should we do? You said that you are gg to live an enjoyable life at graduation day.

715
00:49:23,873 --> 00:49:26,240
You promised in front of all those people.

716
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,673
I am not in the least bit interested but

717
00:49:28,673 --> 00:49:33,373
if I work at the company, my father will be happy.

718
00:49:33,373 --> 00:49:37,407
Then at least, it is a half successful life.

719
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:40,473
I am not interesed but

720
00:49:40,473 --> 00:49:42,640
if others are happy...

721
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,973
What can you do?

722
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,773
What to do?

723
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:09,570
Really? Baek Seung Jo?

724
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:12,470
Seeing he stopped by the student administration offices.

725
00:50:25,837 --> 00:50:30,037
It seems like Seung Jo is planning to take over his father's company.

726
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:36,437
As expected. I thought that if it were Seung Jo,

727
00:50:36,437 --> 00:50:38,270
would not do that

728
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:43,003
His father's condition does noto be good.

729
00:50:44,288 --> 00:50:46,103
How do you know that . . .

730
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:47,678
Oh my,

731
00:50:47,678 --> 00:50:50,229
is that something to be surprised about ?

732
00:50:50,837 --> 00:50:54,666
It's something you can figure out if you put your mind to it.

733
00:50:54,666 --> 00:50:59,570
Especially how Seung Jo must be feeling right now.

734
00:51:01,203 --> 00:51:04,103
I see that he is taken a leave of absence.

735
00:51:07,115 --> 00:51:08,970
I understand.

736
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:10,686
What?

737
00:51:10,686 --> 00:51:13,751
What do you know about Seung Jo?

738
00:51:15,337 --> 00:51:20,003
I'm thinking about how to help him, that's why I said that.

739
00:51:20,003 --> 00:51:21,803
What can you do ...

740
00:51:21,803 --> 00:51:23,364
Oh Ha Ni...

741
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:29,070
How are you helping Seung Jo right now when he's going through such a tough time?

742
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:32,703
Following him around everywhere and getting in his way,

743
00:51:33,003 --> 00:51:35,603
or whining,

744
00:51:35,603 --> 00:51:38,170
and telling him it's fine and that it's all going to get better...

745
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:39,803
Comforting him like that?

746
00:51:40,406 --> 00:51:42,070
Right.

747
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:44,437
You should at least do that.

748
00:51:44,957 --> 00:51:50,670
Because those are the only things that Oh Ha Ni could ever do for Baek Seung Jo.

749
00:51:52,394 --> 00:51:53,751
I'm going.

750
00:51:57,937 --> 00:52:04,470
Living in the 21st century and playing a 2D game is a bit boring,

751
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:09,736
but to play a different game, I mean there aren't many good games.

752
00:52:09,736 --> 00:52:12,222
And when we do it's not that exciting.

753
00:52:12,222 --> 00:52:17,637
Let's use the strategy of turning all the negatives into positives.

754
00:52:17,637 --> 00:52:24,303
I think it would be nice if we create a game that's approachable, graphically appealing, and in 3D.

755
00:52:24,303 --> 00:52:27,270
I heard your IQ was 200, I see you really are a genius.

756
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:29,208
It's not like that.

757
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:35,970
You just aren't utilizing your thoughts to their fullest.

758
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:39,003
Your brains are just a bit rusty because you haven't used them.

759
00:52:39,003 --> 00:52:41,970
Now, shall we start deciding on the name of the game?

760
00:52:47,237 --> 00:52:48,597
Rusty...

761
00:52:49,903 --> 00:52:51,674
Rusty...

762
00:52:51,674 --> 00:52:52,803
Rusty?

763
00:52:52,803 --> 00:52:54,103
Rusty?

764
00:52:54,703 --> 00:52:55,427
That's great.

765
00:52:55,427 --> 00:52:56,203
See, see?!

766
00:52:57,398 --> 00:52:59,510
Wow, it's great.

767
00:53:00,707 --> 00:53:05,310
Let's up the skills, actions, and combos.

768
00:53:08,543 --> 00:53:12,108
Yes that's right. The importance of the main character...

769
00:53:24,177 --> 00:53:26,643
This is where it gets fun.

770
00:54:04,177 --> 00:54:05,943
Mother, did something happen?

771
00:54:05,943 --> 00:54:08,510
What would happen? There is nothing.

772
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:11,195
I just came to pick up some clothes.

773
00:54:11,195 --> 00:54:13,377
Oh I thought...

774
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:17,143
Ah, but, Mother.

775
00:54:17,143 --> 00:54:19,977
What? Do you have something to tell me?

776
00:54:19,977 --> 00:54:23,243
I have something to discuss with you.

777
00:54:23,243 --> 00:54:24,015
What?

778
00:54:24,015 --> 00:54:25,777
I'm going to be late, I'm going to be late.

779
00:54:26,143 --> 00:54:29,739
Seung Jo is taking care of his father's company,

780
00:54:32,289 --> 00:54:34,077
Where are you going?

781
00:54:34,277 --> 00:54:37,477
Seung Jo. Can you give me a ride today?

782
00:54:37,477 --> 00:54:39,143
Where are you going?

783
00:54:40,005 --> 00:54:41,459
To the same place as you are.

784
00:54:41,459 --> 00:54:42,777
The same place?

785
00:54:42,777 --> 00:54:44,313
No way! You. . .

786
00:54:44,313 --> 00:54:49,443
I got the approval to work part time at your father's company.

787
00:54:49,443 --> 00:54:50,529
Please take care of me.

788
00:54:50,529 --> 00:54:52,677
Oh Ha Ni this Mr. Kim.

789
00:54:52,677 --> 00:54:54,477
Hello. My name is Oh Ha Ni.

790
00:54:54,477 --> 00:54:56,469
Oh, hello!

791
00:54:56,669 --> 00:55:00,456
Everyone, she came in as a new employee. Say hello.

792
00:55:00,456 --> 00:55:02,900
Hello. I'm Oh Ha Ni.
I will work hard!

793
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:03,857
Applause.

794
00:55:06,778 --> 00:55:10,850
If you all look after me, I will work hard.
So please take care of me.

795
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:20,519
Our investor, President Yoon, is waiting downstairs.

796
00:55:23,619 --> 00:55:29,586
Baek Su Chan was always busy bragging about his son, but I see it was all true.

797
00:55:29,586 --> 00:55:31,586
Not at all. You're too kind.

798
00:55:31,586 --> 00:55:34,299
All right. How is your father doing in the hospital?

799
00:55:34,299 --> 00:55:37,090
He is getting better,

800
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:40,519
but we thought this was an opportunity for him to take a break.

801
00:55:41,506 --> 00:55:43,295
I guess I'll have to help a bit too.

802
00:55:43,295 --> 00:55:45,886
Yes. Please do.

803
00:55:46,253 --> 00:55:47,993
Good.

804
00:55:47,993 --> 00:55:52,319
President Yoon this is a document regarding the game we're currently developing.

805
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:55,186
Oh, I've already read it.

806
00:55:55,186 --> 00:55:57,353
The game's name is "Rusty", right?

807
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:58,053
Yes.

808
00:55:58,053 --> 00:56:00,267
The idea of the game is very fresh.

809
00:56:00,267 --> 00:56:01,519
Thank you so much.

810
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:06,647
With an heir like you, I'm sure Baek Su Chang feels relieved.

811
00:56:06,747 --> 00:56:10,159
You've got to make it into an even bigger company than what it is right now.

812
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:15,106
We've got to get past this hurdle and then think about that.

813
00:56:19,983 --> 00:56:22,233
You have waited for a long time.
It's coffee, right?

814
00:56:22,233 --> 00:56:25,519
Oh right.
Seung Jo-goon, how old are you?

815
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:26,874
I am 20 years old.

816
00:56:26,874 --> 00:56:30,019
Oh, you're still young.

817
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:32,143
Don't you have a girl friend?

818
00:56:33,953 --> 00:56:35,119
I don't have one.

819
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:37,535
Why? It seems that you are very popular.

820
00:56:37,535 --> 00:56:40,826
Yes. President Baek Seung Jo is really popular.

821
00:56:40,826 --> 00:56:41,919
Oh.

822
00:56:41,919 --> 00:56:47,286
But he doesn't pay any attention to them. He enjoys reading and listens to mostly classic.

823
00:56:47,286 --> 00:56:50,731
He's also so very good at tennis, at which he's won many matches.

824
00:56:50,731 --> 00:56:54,675
His IQ is 200 too! He also cooks as well as any chef!

825
00:56:54,675 --> 00:56:56,958
He is all around perfect.

826
00:56:57,486 --> 00:56:59,686
That is amazing.

827
00:57:00,186 --> 00:57:00,886
Miss Oh Ha Ni...

828
00:57:00,886 --> 00:57:01,770
Yes.

829
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:03,559
Would you leave now?

830
00:57:04,158 --> 00:57:06,491
Yes, President Baek Seung Jo.

831
00:57:24,658 --> 00:57:25,291
You came?

832
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:26,658
Oh, yes.

833
00:57:26,658 --> 00:57:29,724
Do you have a second?

834
00:57:41,769 --> 00:57:47,058
It seems meeting President Yoon was quite effective.

835
00:57:47,324 --> 00:57:50,026
Do you think they'll invest?

836
00:57:50,491 --> 00:57:53,124
But that's...

837
00:57:53,124 --> 00:57:57,391
The chairman has come to like you very much.

838
00:58:00,891 --> 00:58:05,524
The chairman has a grand-daughter. He asked me if you could meet with her sometime.

839
00:58:07,124 --> 00:58:09,824
Are you talking about something like an arranged date?

840
00:58:09,824 --> 00:58:11,827
Oh. Yes.

841
00:58:11,827 --> 00:58:17,391
He was saying how it would be a waste to marry off his grand daugther to just anyone.

842
00:58:17,391 --> 00:58:22,624
For our company, we're at a state where we need President Yoon's help.

843
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:27,458
I was a bit flustterd with his sudden comment.

844
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:31,024
How should I respond?

845
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:02,424
Oh! You're here early.

846
00:59:05,558 --> 00:59:06,391
Huh?

847
00:59:06,391 --> 00:59:08,524
The stuff!

848
00:59:12,324 --> 00:59:13,931
Thank you.

849
00:59:14,231 --> 00:59:16,807
Let's have Bulgogi today.
Lots and lots.

850
00:59:16,807 --> 00:59:20,540
You seem tired these days so I have to pamper you.

851
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:24,807
And then everything that's giving you a hard time will all go away.

852
00:59:27,007 --> 00:59:28,507
Thank you.

853
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:33,174
Thank you.

854
01:00:08,007 --> 01:00:10,407
Oh, you arrived Seung Jo-goon.

855
01:00:12,307 --> 01:00:14,898
Hello, Baek Seung Jo.

856
01:00:38,007 --> 01:00:40,240
If you had to choose a son in law...

857
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,607
who would you choose?

858
01:00:48,774 --> 01:00:54,140
But still, it seems Seung Jo wasn't thinking about it at all.
