She screamed, telling me to let her out.

- And then? - Then...

196
00:20:34,685 --> 00:20:39,236
So as I drove that car,
I yelled right back at her.

197

"Do you want to kiss me or
do you want to date me?"

No.

203

330
00:31:55,175 --> 00:31:57,475
Even if I have to crawl, I'll get there.

331
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:32,575
Me too.

332
00:32:33,042 --> 00:32:34,709
Let's go!

333
00:32:34,709 --> 00:32:37,675
Last lap, let's go!

334
00:32:46,509 --> 00:32:50,575
It's her, it's her! The one who confessed
to Baek Seung Jo and got rejected!

335
00:32:50,575 --> 00:32:53,775
I heard she was humiliated
and she wasn't even pretty.

336
00:32:53,775 --> 00:32:55,342
I don't understand women like her...

337
00:32:55,342 --> 00:32:58,742
I know!

338
00:32:58,742 --> 00:33:00,242
Seung Jo Oppa is ours though.

339
00:33:00,242 --> 00:33:04,942
- Hey, Oh Ha Ni, Oh Ha Ni...
- What?! Oh Ha Ni. What?

340
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:19,475
Auntie, it's too much.

341
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:23,675
You have to eat a lot to gain strength.
How else are you going to live?

342
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:31,909
Still she's very optimistic. If it were me, I don't think
I would be able to come to school.

343
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,900
You say so? She's a senior

344
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,620
yet she still doesn't know how to write Korean.

345
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,400
Aigoo, how frustrating.

346
00:33:51,075 --> 00:33:54,109
Ha Ni! The two story house is really nice!!

347
00:33:54,109 --> 00:33:56,742
Where did the scissors go?

348
00:33:59,042 --> 00:34:01,709
Ummm... should be...

349
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,300
It's here.

350
00:34:19,042 --> 00:34:20,594
Ha Ni!

351
00:34:21,775 --> 00:34:24,309
Do you know how old this table is?

352
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:31,809
Grandma gave it to you when you
opened the noodle shop; it's older than me.

353
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:35,109
That's right! The table is 21 years old!

354
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:40,242
There's not even a scratch! It's really sturdy!

355
00:34:43,809 --> 00:34:48,275
When you were little...you played in here...

356
00:34:58,109 --> 00:35:00,042
Jjan~! (Surprise!).

357
00:35:06,117 --> 00:35:09,540
Ha Ni. It's a two story house.

358
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,800
You sang a song about two story houses,
so how do you like it?

359
00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:15,309
I like it.

360
00:35:16,175 --> 00:35:17,642
What's going on?

361
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:19,342
You didn't do well?

362
00:35:19,342 --> 00:35:20,175
What do you mean?

363
00:35:20,175 --> 00:35:22,509
Aah... that... let...

364
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:26,875
Nothing.

365
00:35:29,775 --> 00:35:32,288
Aigooo~

366
00:35:35,909 --> 00:35:38,642
This was here!

367
00:35:38,642 --> 00:35:40,692
Here, look at this!

368
00:35:40,692 --> 00:35:42,442
It's super cute right?

369
00:35:43,009 --> 00:35:46,142
You were this small when you were a year old.

370
00:35:47,709 --> 00:35:48,909
You've grown up so much.

371
00:35:48,909 --> 00:35:51,475
But you are like this, rebellious now!

372
00:35:51,809 --> 00:35:53,536
I am not!

373
00:35:54,209 --> 00:35:56,942
My hand is similar to Mom's hand.

374
00:35:56,942 --> 00:35:58,271
Right?

375
00:35:58,271 --> 00:35:59,542
Huh?

376
00:36:00,509 --> 00:36:02,042
Yes.

377
00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:17,509
Dad.

378
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:24,709
Ha Ni~

379
00:36:24,709 --> 00:36:26,109
We're here!

380
00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:26,914
I'm here too!

381
00:36:26,914 --> 00:36:30,942
Hurry up! I'm so hungry that I might die!

382
00:36:30,942 --> 00:36:32,475
Wow, it's to die for!

383
00:36:33,009 --> 00:36:35,378
Wow! This is just great!

384
00:36:35,378 --> 00:36:37,809
Wow, is this your room?

385
00:36:38,575 --> 00:36:40,742
Wow, this is great!

386
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:43,409
It's so great here.

387
00:36:44,342 --> 00:36:48,309
Ha Ni, your house is awesome!
Two story house!

388
00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:51,909
For me, I like this the best!

389
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:55,042
Ha Ni! Is this your foot?

390
00:36:55,042 --> 00:36:55,842
Yes.

391
00:36:55,842 --> 00:36:59,475
It's so cute.

392
00:36:59,975 --> 00:37:01,575
Hey!! Stop that! Bong Joon Gu!

393
00:37:01,575 --> 00:37:03,709
- Why?
- Come on, kids! Ha Ni, get that.

394
00:37:03,709 --> 00:37:06,309
- Yes.
- I will get that.

395
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:08,375
I will get it.

396
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:10,209
It smells great!

397
00:37:10,209 --> 00:37:13,042
Wow, it looks so good.
Aigoo.

398
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:15,975
There wasn't much time so
I didn't prepare much food.

399
00:37:15,975 --> 00:37:18,709
When did you prepare all this?
This is a lot!

400
00:37:18,709 --> 00:37:20,775
This is a feast!

401
00:37:20,775 --> 00:37:22,209
Is that right?

402
00:37:22,209 --> 00:37:28,709
We're having guests from Busan today so the main menu is Busan's Mil-myun (Busan's local noodles).

403
00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:32,275
How did you know? It's my favorite.

404
00:37:32,275 --> 00:37:34,409
Wah. Thank you, dad!

405
00:37:34,942 --> 00:37:38,175
- I'll eat well!
- I'll eat well!!

406
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,645
Father! Hmm?

407
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,100
It's to die for. To die for?

408
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,675
Yes, I ate Busan's Mil-myun for a long time!

409
00:37:51,675 --> 00:37:53,109
But this is the best.

410
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:57,042
The noodles are soft yet so chewy!

411
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:58,818
It seems like you know something.

412
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:03,509
Yes, Father. You can't tell, but
my tongue is very sensitive.

413
00:38:03,509 --> 00:38:08,709
At last year's festival, Joon Gu made
and sold Dduk Bok Gi. It was really good.

414
00:38:08,709 --> 00:38:11,142
He's different than he looks.

415
00:38:11,142 --> 00:38:14,142
Well, appearance-wise your face
looks like a bear's feet...

416
00:38:14,142 --> 00:38:15,342
Beer feet?

417
00:38:15,342 --> 00:38:18,342
What? You didn't know?

418
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,840
Eat up

419
00:38:21,275 --> 00:38:24,842
But why is the store named So Pal Bok Noodles?

420
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:29,842
The name of Ha Ni grandmother's was Sok Pal Bok

421
00:38:29,842 --> 00:38:32,875
You mean you carried on the family business?

422
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,909
That's right!

423
00:38:34,909 --> 00:38:40,242
My mother-in-law for 40 years and me for 20 years.

424
00:38:40,242 --> 00:38:41,742
Ohhhh~

425
00:38:41,742 --> 00:38:46,075
No wonder. A deep taste like this
can't come from an amateur.

426
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:49,175
True! I learned while being hit.

427
00:38:49,175 --> 00:38:51,824
I wish my Ha Ni could carry on this business.

428
00:38:51,824 --> 00:38:57,509
She doesn't seem to have the
talent for cooking though.

429
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:03,530
Don't worry, Father! Ha Ni and I...

430
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:05,740
will together...do our very best!

431
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:08,375
Hey! What's wrong with you?

432
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:15,009
What? A store that's been around for
more than 60 years can't end just like that, right?

433
00:39:15,009 --> 00:39:21,675
Yeah, but it's not a bad idea to donate
everything back to society either.

434
00:39:21,675 --> 00:39:27,842
Father! Now I see you're the kind of
person who spits with a smile on your face.

435
00:39:28,775 --> 00:39:30,375
Ha Ni!

436
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:37,762
Oh, Ha Ni!

437
00:39:44,075 --> 00:39:45,441
What's this?

438
00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:57,075
Hey, Bong Joon Gu, why are you
trying to destroy someone else's home?

439
00:39:57,075 --> 00:40:02,042
What are you on about?! This house is very stable.

440
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:19,242
What is this?!

441
00:40:19,242 --> 00:40:20,275
Isn't it an earthquake?

442
00:40:20,275 --> 00:40:21,509
Earthquake?

443
00:40:21,509 --> 00:40:22,675
Dad, what are we gonna do?!

444
00:40:22,675 --> 00:40:25,730
It's okay. This is a new house. p

445
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:28,770
It's stable... Very safe...

446
00:40:48,175 --> 00:40:49,942
Ha Ni!

447
00:40:53,809 --> 00:40:57,142
Get out! Father! Quickly!

448
00:40:57,142 --> 00:40:59,485
Hurry hurry come on!

449
00:41:21,975 --> 00:41:23,142
Ha Ni, are you alright?

450
00:41:23,142 --> 00:41:24,409
Wait a minute! Is everyone alright!?

451
00:41:24,409 --> 00:41:25,955
Yes!

452
00:41:26,863 --> 00:41:28,670
How could this happen!?

453
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,228
Oh my!

454
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,618
That's right! That... that...
That!

455
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:33,309
What?

456
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:35,233
That... that...just wait!

457
00:41:35,233 --> 00:41:36,442
Dad!

458
00:41:36,442 --> 00:41:38,769
No, you can't!

459
00:41:39,934 --> 00:41:41,734
Don't!

460
00:41:41,734 --> 00:41:42,906
I'll be back quickly!

461
00:41:42,906 --> 00:41:45,003
Don't worry!

462
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:36,122
Dad...

463
00:42:38,152 --> 00:42:40,427
Da... Dad!

464
00:42:47,304 --> 00:42:52,076
At 5:30 this afternoon, there was a
mild earthquake of 2.0 magnitude in Seoul.

465
00:42:52,076 --> 00:42:55,620
It was a tremor that slightly shook windows, however...

466
00:42:55,620 --> 00:43:01,118
one house in this area, Yeonhee-dong, has collapsed, as you can see, to the point that it's unrecognizable.

467
00:43:01,118 --> 00:43:03,479
He's still in there! My dad is still in there...

468
00:43:03,479 --> 00:43:07,009
As far as we know there is still a person trapped within the collapsed house.

469
00:43:07,009 --> 00:43:09,609
The 2.0 magnitude YeonHee-dong
earthquake collapse site.
The rescue team is...

470
00:43:09,609 --> 00:43:12,192
...now in the process of clearing
a path and rescuing the person.

471
00:43:12,192 --> 00:43:14,009
Yes, I believe they're looking to see if anyone is there!!

472
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:17,922
Yes! We can see someone's coming out
from under a table in the living room!

473
00:43:19,473 --> 00:43:22,559
Dad! Dad!

474
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:28,942
What do you think this is, Dad!?

475
00:43:28,942 --> 00:43:30,909
Aigoo, I lived!

476
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:33,926
- I'm alive! I'm alive!
- Daddy!

477
00:43:35,084 --> 00:43:37,609
Of course, there doesn't seem
to be any fatal injuries.

478
00:43:37,609 --> 00:43:41,906
The police suspect the collapse was caused by poor construction and are investigating the exact cause.

479
00:43:41,906 --> 00:43:43,775
Huh!?

480
00:43:43,775 --> 00:43:45,618
Oh Gi Dong?

481
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,000
Aigoo!

482
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,000
Here... Huh?

483
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,275
What is this?

484
00:43:58,437 --> 00:44:00,359
Was our house the only one...

485
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:02,341
...that collapsed?

486
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,200
Oh, really?

487
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:16,209
Hehe... let's go.

488
00:44:17,342 --> 00:44:19,575
Gee... What!

489
00:44:26,075 --> 00:44:29,009
But, are you staying at a hotel again today?

490
00:44:29,009 --> 00:44:32,175
- Yeah.
- That must be really expensive.

491
00:44:32,175 --> 00:44:35,642
No, for now we decided to stay
at my dad's friend's house.

492
00:44:35,642 --> 00:44:38,375
At least until the house is rebuilt
or we find another one.

493
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,442
We were contacted because of the newscast.

494
00:44:40,442 --> 00:44:42,809
Oh really? That's really great!

495
00:44:42,809 --> 00:44:44,475
Oh, is it her?

496
00:44:44,475 --> 00:44:46,109
What!?

497
00:44:54,909 --> 00:44:56,309
What the heck?

498
00:44:56,309 --> 00:44:58,642
Even pictures now...

499
00:45:00,709 --> 00:45:03,275
You're a total celebrity now.

500
00:45:03,275 --> 00:45:04,875
I'm sorry.

501
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:09,075
Because of this unlucky friend,
you guys are suffering a lot.

502
00:45:10,275 --> 00:45:11,775
Let's go.

503
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,900
Please show your power of love. Thank you for your help.

504
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,900
What are they doing?

505
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,675
Of course you guys know about
what happened on the news...

506
00:45:30,675 --> 00:45:34,350
Our friend, Oh Ha Ni, lost her house overnight

507
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:36,100
due to a sudden earthquake.

508
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:39,800
Let's all help Ha Ni.

509
00:45:40,442 --> 00:45:42,175
What the heck is that?

510
00:45:42,175 --> 00:45:44,375
What is Bong Joon Gu doing?

511
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:46,842
"Love's Fundraising?"

512
00:45:47,975 --> 00:45:50,109
That idiot!

513
00:45:50,109 --> 00:45:53,609
Hey, let's just go this way.

514
00:45:53,609 --> 00:45:55,109
Come on, follow me.

515
00:45:57,009 --> 00:45:59,109
Oh! Thank you.

516
00:45:59,109 --> 00:46:03,109
Thank you, let's help Ha Ni.
We're all friends aren't we?

517
00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:07,609
Show us the power of love!
Thank you!

518
00:46:07,609 --> 00:46:10,242
Oh, Ha Ni, Oh Ha Ni!

519
00:46:10,242 --> 00:46:13,109
Ha Ni, Ha Ni, move it, move it, move it!

520
00:46:13,109 --> 00:46:15,542
Hey, everyone, everyone, everyone!

521
00:46:16,942 --> 00:46:19,309
Please greet her with thunderous applause.

522
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:21,142
Even after going through such a
horrible experience yesterday,

523
00:46:21,142 --> 00:46:25,575
she came to school all determined and ready!

524
00:46:25,575 --> 00:46:29,875
Here is Oh Ha Ni! Applause!

525
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:31,942
Ha Ni, Ha Ni!

526
00:46:33,509 --> 00:46:35,575
What. What, what?

527
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:43,010
Now I'm really screwed.

528
00:46:43,642 --> 00:46:48,075
Hey! Hey, you!
Show some love, Baek Seung Jo.

529
00:46:50,175 --> 00:46:52,109
Didn't you see the news yesterday?

530
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:54,242
Don't you have a TV at home?

531
00:46:54,242 --> 00:46:58,909
Whose fault do you think it is that Ha Ni
is going through such a difficult time?

532
00:46:58,909 --> 00:47:01,975
Wasn't it because of a mild
earthquake of 2.0 magnitude?

533
00:47:01,975 --> 00:47:03,275
Oh...

534
00:47:03,942 --> 00:47:05,675
Right, right...

535
00:47:07,075 --> 00:47:10,342
However... Because of that small earthquake...

536
00:47:10,342 --> 00:47:13,609
...the newly built house collapsed.
What do you think about that?

537
00:47:13,609 --> 00:47:15,442
Are you saying that I caused the earthquake?

538
00:47:15,442 --> 00:47:19,242
Then what? Who can cause a
bigger earthquake than you?

539
00:47:19,242 --> 00:47:24,809
You're capable of causing such a great amount of pain to someone's heart, so capable of causing that.

540
00:47:26,075 --> 00:47:28,042
Alright, all I need to do is give you money?

541
00:47:28,042 --> 00:47:29,609
Right...

542
00:47:36,742 --> 00:47:38,409
Put your wallet away!

543
00:47:42,342 --> 00:47:43,709
Did anyone say they'd take your money?

544
00:47:43,709 --> 00:47:47,642
Even if I were homeless, I would never take
your money even if you offered.

545
00:47:47,642 --> 00:47:49,009
Really?

546
00:47:49,009 --> 00:47:51,442
Fine, I'll respect that.

547
00:47:55,242 --> 00:47:57,175
Hey, Baek Seung Jo!

548
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,942
Who made you so mighty that
you can ignore people like this?

549
00:47:59,942 --> 00:48:03,675
To you, all the kids here look like idiots, don't they?

550
00:48:03,675 --> 00:48:06,809
You think that acting superior and ignoring
everyone makes you look cool, right?

551
00:48:06,809 --> 00:48:08,342
Are you just that much better?

552
00:48:08,342 --> 00:48:11,009
Why? Because your IQ is higher?

553
00:48:11,009 --> 00:48:15,275
Because you're good at studying, you have a handsome face, and you're tall...

554
00:48:17,775 --> 00:48:19,909
Is everything just dandy if you're better than others?

555
00:48:25,875 --> 00:48:29,209
Hey! We can all study and be smart, who can't?

556
00:48:29,209 --> 00:48:32,675
I just don't study, that's why my grades aren't great.
Do you think that my grades
are bad because I can't study?

557
00:48:32,675 --> 00:48:34,442
Really?

558
00:48:34,442 --> 00:48:36,342
Yeah!

559
00:48:36,342 --> 00:48:38,175
Then show me.

560
00:48:38,175 --> 00:48:41,275
What? Show you?

561
00:48:42,709 --> 00:48:45,242
Ok fine, I'll show you.

562
00:48:45,242 --> 00:48:47,509
During the next examining period.

563
00:48:48,475 --> 00:48:50,009
How much?

564
00:48:50,975 --> 00:48:52,242
How much?

565
00:48:52,242 --> 00:48:54,309
There are 50 spots for study hall this month.

566
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:56,942
I don't know how you can sit there
laughing, writing such useless things.

567
00:48:56,942 --> 00:48:58,274
Don't you have any brains?

568
00:48:58,274 --> 00:49:00,109
Or just thick skinned?

569
00:49:02,509 --> 00:49:04,209
Right! The study hall.

570
00:49:04,209 --> 00:49:06,075
Study hall?

571
00:49:06,642 --> 00:49:07,842
This month’s study hall?

572
00:49:07,842 --> 00:49:09,442
Yeah!

573
00:49:09,442 --> 00:49:12,809
That high and mighty this month’s special study hall.

574
00:49:12,809 --> 00:49:15,409
Next month, I will get in there.

575
00:49:16,609 --> 00:49:18,642
Are you making fun of me again?

576
00:49:19,409 --> 00:49:20,709
If I do it?

577
00:49:20,709 --> 00:49:21,909
And if I do it? What will you do if I do it?

578
00:49:21,909 --> 00:49:22,809
If you do it?

579
00:49:22,809 --> 00:49:24,175
Yeah!

580
00:49:24,175 --> 00:49:27,242
If you do it, I'll carry you on my back
and walk around the school.

581
00:49:29,809 --> 00:49:32,842
You'll give me a piggyback ride?

582
00:49:32,842 --> 00:49:34,142
No, that's not it!

583
00:49:34,142 --> 00:49:35,842
Fine.

584
00:49:35,842 --> 00:49:37,442
You better look forward to it.

585
00:49:46,142 --> 00:49:47,475
Are you really that close?

586
00:49:47,475 --> 00:49:49,075
Ah! Of course!

587
00:49:49,742 --> 00:49:55,175
From the day we were born until we finished junior high, we lived together like one family.

588
00:49:55,175 --> 00:50:00,709
Then we moved up to Seoul and we lost touch.

589
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:07,275
Even when I'm asleep, I feel like bursting with
anger because of our house was destroyed.

590
00:50:10,609 --> 00:50:12,242
However, thanks to that...

591
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:14,575
...finding my friend again is really nice.

592
00:50:15,875 --> 00:50:18,042
Oh why this thing!?

593
00:50:18,042 --> 00:50:20,009
This thing!

594
00:50:24,642 --> 00:50:26,475
Daddy is like an idiot right?

595
00:50:29,009 --> 00:50:30,409
Thanks.

596
00:50:33,809 --> 00:50:38,775
Every day with you,

597
00:50:38,775 --> 00:50:44,075
Being held in the night's arms.

598
00:50:44,075 --> 00:50:49,075
♪ Every day with you ♪

599
00:50:49,075 --> 00:50:54,309
♪ I'm hungry to fall asleep ♪

600
00:50:59,109 --> 00:51:00,209
Stop!

601
00:51:02,709 --> 00:51:05,909
It's here. House number 142, right?

602
00:51:05,909 --> 00:51:07,242
Oh, you're right.

603
00:51:08,075 --> 00:51:09,742
Just wait here.

604
00:51:19,909 --> 00:51:21,775
Baek Su Chang, it's right.

605
00:51:23,842 --> 00:51:26,609
He must be really rich, your friend.

606
00:51:27,409 --> 00:51:29,075
Yeah... It seems like it.

607
00:51:36,109 --> 00:51:37,009
Who is it?

608
00:51:37,009 --> 00:51:40,142
I... Hello.

609
00:51:40,142 --> 00:51:43,409
I'm Su Chang's friend, Oh Gi Dong.

610
00:51:43,409 --> 00:51:46,242
Oh yes, come on in!

611
00:51:46,242 --> 00:51:47,942
Honey!

612
00:51:47,942 --> 00:51:49,909
- You've arrived!?
- Yes.

613
00:51:57,409 --> 00:51:58,142
Come on over here, hurry!

614
00:51:58,142 --> 00:52:00,442
Baek(white) Piggy!

615
00:52:01,909 --> 00:52:04,142
How did you! Aigoo.

616
00:52:04,142 --> 00:52:05,575
You must have suffered a lot.

617
00:52:05,575 --> 00:52:09,475
Aigoo! It's really great to see you!

618
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,575
Wow!

619
00:52:12,575 --> 00:52:15,142
- Ah my wife.
-Hi there!

620
00:52:15,142 --> 00:52:16,975
Oh my, welcome to our home.

621
00:52:18,675 --> 00:52:21,475
Yes... I really am here.

622
00:52:21,475 --> 00:52:23,909
It's really great that you're here.
You're completely welcome here!

623
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,209
Hi there.

624
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:27,275
Hello.

625
00:52:27,275 --> 00:52:29,242
Oh, you must be Gi Dong's daughter.

626
00:52:29,242 --> 00:52:30,709
Yes.

627
00:52:30,709 --> 00:52:33,042
You're more beautiful in person.

628
00:52:34,942 --> 00:52:35,709
Excuse me?

629
00:52:35,709 --> 00:52:38,742
Oh... In all honesty...

630
00:52:38,742 --> 00:52:41,642
I couldn't wait until tonight.

631
00:52:41,642 --> 00:52:45,109
I just stopped by in the morning.

632
00:52:46,342 --> 00:52:47,609
Oh that...

633
00:52:51,342 --> 00:52:53,375
That was me.

634
00:52:54,909 --> 00:52:57,042
Well... We should unload all your stuff.

635
00:52:57,042 --> 00:53:01,675
No, no, we don't have much stuff.
Our Ha Ni can do it all by herself.

636
00:53:01,675 --> 00:53:02,975
Yeah! There isn't much.

637
00:53:02,975 --> 00:53:05,942
Oh, don't worry, our child needs to help.

638
00:53:05,942 --> 00:53:07,575
No, I said it's alright.

639
00:53:07,575 --> 00:53:10,975
Son! Come here and use your muscles!

640
00:53:21,475 --> 00:53:22,775
Dad, here, here. I'll do it

641
00:53:22,775 --> 00:53:26,309
Aigoo, just go close the door.

642
00:53:27,775 --> 00:53:29,909
Alright.

643
00:53:30,615 --> 00:53:32,005
Teddy~

644
00:53:33,542 --> 00:53:36,342
From now on, I think our luck will be good.

645
00:53:37,175 --> 00:53:38,609
Don't you think?

646
00:53:40,809 --> 00:53:42,275
Let's go.

647
00:53:48,609 --> 00:53:49,475
Should I help you?

648
00:53:49,475 --> 00:53:51,375
No, it's alright.

649
00:53:58,875 --> 00:54:01,142
Is this a dream? Yeah, this must be a dream!

650
00:54:01,142 --> 00:54:03,409
Come to your senses, Oh Ha Ni.

651
00:54:07,775 --> 00:54:09,542
You...you!

652
00:54:27,175 --> 00:54:30,075
I can't believe it... What should I do?

653
00:54:32,675 --> 00:54:33,909
Who is this?

654
00:54:33,909 --> 00:54:35,009
It's Seung Jo.

655
00:54:35,009 --> 00:54:36,375
Excuse me!?

656
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:39,475
Hey! Give me that!

657
00:54:40,209 --> 00:54:42,242
I have a proposition.

658
00:54:42,242 --> 00:54:45,742
Hey, Oh Ha Ni, what is "x" here?

659
00:54:45,742 --> 00:54:48,009
Alphabet.

660
00:54:48,009 --> 00:54:49,509
I feel like I'm going to explode.

661
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:52,775
Hey!

662
00:54:52,775 --> 00:54:54,442
Hello~

663
00:54:57,475 --> 00:54:59,442
Camera!

664
00:54:59,442 --> 00:55:00,942
Don't spread rumors.

665
00:55:00,942 --> 00:55:03,742
I... I closed my feelings for you.

666
00:55:03,742 --> 00:55:06,242
My feelings for you...aren't even this much.

667
00:55:06,242 --> 00:55:07,709
Really?
