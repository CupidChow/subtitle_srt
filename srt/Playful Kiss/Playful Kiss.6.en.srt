1
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:58,891
I'm sorry...

2
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,067
I'm really sorry.

3
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:07,567
I know how hard it was arranging to take this test.

4
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:11,127
Everyone was looking forward to it... But...

5
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,566
Because of me...

6
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,200
All because I needlesly tagged along.

7
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:22,333
You should have just left me and went on.

8
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:25,067
I should have, shouldn't I?

9
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:27,405
What you're saying is right.

10
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:34,167
I really am an obstacle in your life.

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,147
No!
Even that word doesn't describe it.

12
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,778
I'm a disaster.

13
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,821
Oh, it's here.

14
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:44,680
Where?

15
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,175
Oh, Ha Ni!

16
00:01:52,175 --> 00:01:52,967
Ha Ni!

17
00:01:52,967 --> 00:01:56,533
Aigoo! What's happening here?!

18
00:01:56,533 --> 00:02:00,333
What!? You even have a cast!?
Aigoo! What to do...

19
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:03,600
Oh, Baek Seung Jo! You agai...

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,800
Joon Gu, drop it.

21
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,600
Hey! Whenever you're around Ha Ni,
she's always prone to accidents!

22
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,200
I told you to drop it!

23
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:14,146
Oh? Ha... Ha Ni...

24
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:16,667
Just go.

25
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:18,000
Ha Ni...

26
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,700
I want to be alone now.

27
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:28,533
Hey, Ha Ni... Are you alright?

28
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:32,167
Come on, let go of me!

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,833
Ha Ni, is there anything you want to eat?
I'll go buy it and come back.

30
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:39,533
Ha Ni! Let go of me, will you?

31
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:40,732
Should I leave as well?

32
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:42,333
Go...

33
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:44,500
Go and get some rest.

34
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,767
I'm really sorry.

35
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:39,733
I'm at a loss for words, Jae Su (sister-in-law)
(He's referring to Seung Jo's dad as his brother)

36
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:41,533
Not at all...

37
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:48,167
That's right. After dropping her off at the hospital, he still had plenty of time to go, but he chose not to.

38
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:53,700
But still... He was reluctant to take the
test before and now he was going to...

39
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,400
He must have something in mind.

40
00:03:57,067 --> 00:03:59,000
Don't worry...

41
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:05,800
After all, a youth who doesn't rebel
is not a youth. It's just a child.

42
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,633
Thanks, Unni.

43
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:24,967
Alright, now let's get to work!
The customers should be rolling on in soon.

44
00:04:24,967 --> 00:04:26,233
- Yes.
- Yes.

45
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:33,104
Hey, Ha Ni, our family must have
a knack for speedy recoveries.

46
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:38,233
Even the doctor said that there wasn't such a case
like yours, where a patient left the hospital so early.

47
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:40,600
Dad...

48
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,300
Yeah?

49
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:46,533
Shouldn't we leave Seung Jo's house?

50
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:47,367
Why?

51
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,400
Do you feel like we're being senseless?

52
00:04:50,633 --> 00:04:55,400
There's no need to! Everyone is worrying
about you more than they are for Seung Jo.

53
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,700
That's why it bothers me even more.

54
00:05:01,193 --> 00:05:03,733
Why am I always like this?

55
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:06,133
Oh, welcome!

56
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:08,900
Hey, a customer came in now,
so come on and get up.

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,067
I'll drop you off.

58
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:23,767
Is Ha Ni still sulking?

59
00:05:24,696 --> 00:05:29,100
She won't move an inch from her room
and she'll barely eat anything.

60
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,967
When everyone's asleep, she comes
out and starts to walk around.

61
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:36,200
In the middle of the night, I was startled
because I thought she was a ghost!

62
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:42,867
Baek Seung Jo.

63
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:46,100
You should treat her well.

64
00:05:46,867 --> 00:05:50,467
Just a kind word from you will solve things.
Why are you causing her so much grief!

65
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:51,867
I did tell her!

66
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,367
Really?

67
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:55,033
What did you say?

68
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,167
Thanks for not letting me do the interview.

69
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:03,200
Is that some sort of condolence?
That's like slapping the face of a crying kid.

70
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:09,000
You don't get to eat either
until Ha Ni starts eating again.

71
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:32,567
I heard you gave Seung Jo some
sleeping pills on the morning of the test.

72
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:35,800
Even like this, do you think you still
have any right to say that you like him?

73
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,500
[From: Ha Ni
For: Mother, Father... I'm sorry...]

74
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:39,600
Long time no see.

75
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:48,433
Are you leaving?

76
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:53,833
Is it because I didn't get into Tae Sung University?

77
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,767
That, too, but also because of
the cough medicine incident.

78
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:04,067
I keep trying to do well, but I keep...

79
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:09,900
No matter how hard I think about it,
I don't think I should be by your side.

80
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,566
I don't know what might happen because of me.

81
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:15,433
Don't hold me back.

82
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:17,133
I don't have any thought like that.

83
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,733
Huh?

84
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:23,769
Should I help you? It seems heavy.

85
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:26,300
It's okay.

86
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,833
Alright then.

87
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Take care!

88
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,200
Ah.

89
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:35,000
Is it for me?

90
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:38,967
Parang University?

91
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,067
Oh... Enrollment fee?

92
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,167
Eh, zero won?

93
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:53,800
The enrollment fee is zero won!

94
00:09:57,633 --> 00:10:02,433
Undecided major?
Ah, this must be a mistake. It isn't for me.

95
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:04,333
It's addressed to "Baek Seung Jo".

96
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:07,767
Baek Seung Jo...?

97
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:11,000
Baek Seung Jo?!

98
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:13,872
Oh my...

99
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,491
Really?

100
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:23,783
You're really going to Parang University?

101
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:25,676
Why?

102
00:10:25,676 --> 00:10:27,098
Who knows?

103
00:10:27,098 --> 00:10:29,081
Because they begged me to go?

104
00:10:29,854 --> 00:10:30,937
What?!

105
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,452
If you would enroll at our school,

106
00:10:34,452 --> 00:10:37,077
we would offer everything and anything.

107
00:10:37,077 --> 00:10:40,494
They're going to pay for me to study abroad, as well
as combined masters and doctorate degrees.

108
00:10:40,494 --> 00:10:42,716
If I stay within the school,

109
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:44,792
they said they would even give me
a tenured position there.

110
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:51,561
For me, they were really pissed
asking why they should pick me.

111
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,440
But, even if it's Parang University,

112
00:10:56,187 --> 00:10:59,838
isn't priority admission the
same for every university?

113
00:10:59,838 --> 00:11:01,954
Through all of my life up until now,

114
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:04,807
I think I was the angriest last year.

115
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:09,683
I was anxious and pissed
wondering what's going to happen today.

116
00:11:10,602 --> 00:11:13,306
It was a complete mess.

117
00:11:14,438 --> 00:11:15,892
Sorry.

118
00:11:16,687 --> 00:11:18,693
But it was fun.

119
00:11:19,865 --> 00:11:23,833
Falling asleep while taking the exam was fun.

120
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:27,284
Wondering what my score would be
after taking the exam, that was new too.

121
00:11:27,284 --> 00:11:31,231
Thanks to you, I experienced a lot of new things.

122
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,665
It was pretty exciting and fun.

123
00:11:37,454 --> 00:11:39,198
So...

124
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,798
So?

125
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,406
So you're saying...

126
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:49,082
You're going because of me?
To Parang University?

127
00:11:49,082 --> 00:11:52,111
It's not because of you, but because of me!

128
00:11:54,091 --> 00:11:57,052
Just until I figure out what I want to do.

129
00:11:57,052 --> 00:11:59,328
I want to live an exciting life until then.

130
00:12:01,296 --> 00:12:04,390
I thought your grandmother said to live a fun life!

131
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:07,890
Right.

132
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,019
Well then...

133
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,005
See you.

134
00:12:15,732 --> 00:12:17,161
Wait!

135
00:12:19,168 --> 00:12:20,854
Then...

136
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:24,132
Does that mean I can stay here longer?

137
00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:26,204
I won't be a pain anymore!

138
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,803
You won't?

139
00:12:28,294 --> 00:12:30,187
Sure you won't.

140
00:12:32,573 --> 00:12:34,670
I guess so...

141
00:12:35,731 --> 00:12:37,724
...but I'll try!

142
00:12:58,898 --> 00:13:00,512
Thanks.

143
00:13:02,187 --> 00:13:04,387
But...

144
00:13:04,387 --> 00:13:09,770
So you've been feigning ignorance this
whole time even knowing about Parang University?!

145
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:12,469
Even after seeing how I was dying of guilt?

146
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,305
Why?!

147
00:13:14,305 --> 00:13:15,384
Because it was fun.

148
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:16,813
What?!

149
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:18,388
You don't like it?

150
00:13:18,388 --> 00:13:20,314
If you don't like it, I can cancel it right now...

151
00:13:20,314 --> 00:13:22,603
No, no, no!

152
00:13:23,454 --> 00:13:24,868
I like it.

153
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:27,970
I'm happy.

154
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,491
I know.

155
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:06,937
See, I told you he had something in mind.

156
00:14:07,682 --> 00:14:09,057
Parang University?

157
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,470
When did he apply here?

158
00:14:12,094 --> 00:14:13,330
I'm sorry.

159
00:14:13,698 --> 00:14:18,271
If my Ha Ni hadn't gotten into that accident,
he would have just gone to Tae San University.

160
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:22,654
What's so great about Tae San University?
It's probably full of kids like Seung Jo.

161
00:14:24,493 --> 00:14:28,823
Ha Ni and Seung Jo at the same university...

162
00:14:28,823 --> 00:14:33,067
No matter how you see it, don't you think
those two are a match made in heaven?

163
00:14:34,702 --> 00:14:36,132
Match made in heaven...

164
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,322
Welcome!

165
00:14:53,322 --> 00:14:54,437
Hello, Father!

166
00:14:54,437 --> 00:14:57,187
I came again! Oh, let me do it, I'll do it!

167
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:00,216
It's fine!

168
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:01,570
Look here, look here!

169
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,270
What chef does chores like this?!

170
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,637
Chef?

171
00:15:06,893 --> 00:15:08,919
If it's what I think you came
here to say, then just go on your way.

172
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:12,987
Oh no, today I came to give you this.

173
00:15:13,527 --> 00:15:14,184
What's this?

174
00:15:14,184 --> 00:15:16,349
Oh yes, it's safflower seeds.

175
00:15:17,037 --> 00:15:18,460
Safflower seeds?

176
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,770
I hear this is the best for healing broken bones!

177
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:24,165
Even after one has taken off the cast,
stuff like this needs to be eaten like crazy!

178
00:15:24,165 --> 00:15:26,194
Please mix it with some water and feed it to Ha Ni.

179
00:15:28,238 --> 00:15:29,699
Thanks.

180
00:15:33,735 --> 00:15:34,557
Chef!

181
00:15:34,557 --> 00:15:36,522
What are you doing?

182
00:15:36,522 --> 00:15:39,594
Please don't be like this! Can't you just take me in?!

183
00:15:39,594 --> 00:15:42,337
Sixty years of tradition, So Pal Bok Noodles!

184
00:15:42,337 --> 00:15:44,184
That tradition can't come to end, right?!

185
00:15:44,184 --> 00:15:48,689
How many times do I have to tell you? Do something you want to do. Don't decide because of my Ha Ni!

186
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:51,725
What I want to do is this!

187
00:15:51,725 --> 00:15:54,030
When I first ate your noodles...

188
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,403
...my heart felt like it was sinking!

189
00:15:56,403 --> 00:15:57,237
Let go.

190
00:15:57,237 --> 00:15:58,795
Father!

191
00:15:58,795 --> 00:16:00,185
- Let go!
- Please, please!

192
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:01,270
Excuse me!

193
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,070
Yes, welcome!

194
00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:05,993
Oh yes.

195
00:16:07,097 --> 00:16:08,347
Is this...

196
00:16:08,347 --> 00:16:11,437
...the place that sells some porridge that
helps people get accepted into university?

197
00:16:13,395 --> 00:16:15,503
It's just that I hear that...

198
00:16:15,503 --> 00:16:19,018
...eating your porridge helps even the
90th place students get into Parang University.

199
00:16:19,757 --> 00:16:22,451
By any chance, do you mean Bul Nak porridge?

200
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:24,090
Yes, that's right!

201
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,655
This is it, this is the place! Come in, come in!

202
00:16:25,655 --> 00:16:27,495
- Oh, this is wonderful!
- Oh, yes, welcome!

203
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,570
So this is where it was!

204
00:16:40,362 --> 00:16:42,402
Hey, hurry and get up!

205
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:43,620
No sir!

206
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,370
I will not budge from this spot today,
not until you take me in!

207
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,270
You little...

208
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,418
Your act is an obstruction of business!

209
00:16:51,703 --> 00:16:53,870
Obstruction? Oh, that won't do.

210
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,816
Excuse me, can we get some warm water here?

211
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:59,242
- Oh, yes, yes!
- Yes, yes! It's fine, I'll do it!

212
00:16:59,242 --> 00:17:01,050
Can we see a few menus?

213
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:01,903
Oh, yes!

214
00:17:01,903 --> 00:17:04,257
Menu, menu, menu! Oh, here they are!

215
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,420
Here you go.

216
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,749
You look so hardworking.

217
00:17:12,749 --> 00:17:15,046
There's even pine mushroom
and oyster chopped noodles!

218
00:17:15,046 --> 00:17:17,937
This is the best time for oysters, you know.

219
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:20,254
The aroma of the ocean is embedded in them!

220
00:17:20,254 --> 00:17:23,194
Such a youngster, but you're great at business.

221
00:17:23,194 --> 00:17:27,070
- Then I'll have the oyster noodles.
- I want the Bul Nak porridge.

222
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,353
Alright, then one order of oyster noodles,
and three Bul Nak porridges?

223
00:17:29,353 --> 00:17:31,489
Got it! Please wait just a bit!

224
00:17:33,337 --> 00:17:35,622
One Chopped Noodles and three Bul Nak porridges!

225
00:17:46,182 --> 00:17:48,103
Are you looking for something in particular?

226
00:17:48,103 --> 00:17:50,303
I was just...

227
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,784
Where are the mp3s and digital cameras?

228
00:17:53,784 --> 00:17:55,916
They're in that corner.

229
00:18:05,437 --> 00:18:07,619
How nifty!

230
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,827
There are so many things I want to buy for him.

231
00:18:42,146 --> 00:18:43,982
It looks so nice.

232
00:18:45,068 --> 00:18:47,417
It'll probably look really good on Seung Jo.

233
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:08,831
Thank you, boss! I'll give it my all!

234
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:10,992
Do your best from now on.

235
00:19:10,992 --> 00:19:12,589
Yes! I'll do my best!

236
00:19:24,195 --> 00:19:25,731
I'll be right there!

237
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:31,490
This tastes really good.

238
00:19:32,703 --> 00:19:34,155
It's 6,200 Won.
($6.20)

239
00:19:34,155 --> 00:19:35,603
Gosh.

240
00:19:42,603 --> 00:19:44,637
Oh, you're here?

241
00:19:44,637 --> 00:19:45,503
I'm home.

242
00:19:45,503 --> 00:19:46,904
Oh good.

243
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,364
She's constantly late these days.

244
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:02,303
She's probably lazing around now that
she's been accepted into university!

245
00:20:02,303 --> 00:20:04,803
Where did you learn to talk in such a way!?

246
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,060
Oh Ha Ni!

247
00:20:14,227 --> 00:20:16,427
You've been staying out late these days.

248
00:20:16,927 --> 00:20:18,693
Why?

249
00:20:18,693 --> 00:20:19,727
Were you worried?

250
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:21,627
Worried?

251
00:20:21,627 --> 00:20:25,460
Don't you know that my mom stays up late
every day so that she can open the door for you?

252
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,327
I know.

253
00:20:28,146 --> 00:20:30,385
But I have no choice.

254
00:20:30,385 --> 00:20:31,925
What?

255
00:20:34,593 --> 00:20:36,560
Rice balls...

256
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,260
If it's 3,800 won (per hour) for 7 hours...

257
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,627
...it's 26,600 won.

258
00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:53,868
It's 7,000 won.

259
00:20:56,219 --> 00:20:57,993
I've received 10,000 won.

260
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,627
Your change is 3,000 won.

261
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,858
Come again.

262
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,127
Welcom...

263
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,360
How much is it?

264
00:21:30,827 --> 00:21:32,760
It's 1,200 won.

265
00:21:37,793 --> 00:21:39,425
Here.

266
00:21:42,893 --> 00:21:45,300
Hey... Customer...

267
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,622
How much did you give me just now?

268
00:21:47,622 --> 00:21:48,393
10,000 won.

269
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,058
I've received 10,000 won.

270
00:21:57,542 --> 00:21:59,139
Excuse me...

271
00:21:59,139 --> 00:22:00,727
Customer...

272
00:22:01,327 --> 00:22:02,893
From here...

273
00:22:02,893 --> 00:22:05,927
Please take 8,800 won.

274
00:22:05,927 --> 00:22:07,093
What?

275
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,193
8,800 won?

276
00:22:22,193 --> 00:22:23,852
Ah... Yes.

277
00:22:25,193 --> 00:22:27,057
Goodbye.

278
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:44,860
Manager!

279
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,893
What?

280
00:22:46,893 --> 00:22:49,693
Please take 8,800 won?!

281
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,460
Out of all those other convenience stores,
why did he have to come to this one?

282
00:23:04,393 --> 00:23:07,393
Well, it must be our destiny.

283
00:23:10,564 --> 00:23:12,813
Anyways...

284
00:23:12,813 --> 00:23:14,693
Where could I make money?

285
00:23:16,413 --> 00:23:18,693
It shouldn't be too late either.

286
00:23:28,527 --> 00:23:30,060
Yes!

287
00:23:30,393 --> 00:23:32,560
[Tae Yang Chicken]

288
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,636
Ha Ni!

289
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,726
What to do? You're going to have to go on a delivery again.

290
00:23:52,726 --> 00:23:55,360
It's okay! As long as you pay me, then it's fine.

291
00:24:07,127 --> 00:24:09,001
It is here.

292
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,294
Ah good.

293
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:36,463
Ah stupid.

294
00:24:36,463 --> 00:24:39,027
Why didn't I know while I was coming here?

295
00:24:49,793 --> 00:24:51,360
Yes.

296
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:55,613
No...

297
00:24:55,613 --> 00:24:57,838
I came already.

298
00:24:57,838 --> 00:24:59,830
Yes, i am in front of the house.

299
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,160
Yes.

300
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:13,590
Who is it?

301
00:25:15,246 --> 00:25:18,697
Hello, i am the chicken...

302
00:25:18,697 --> 00:25:22,237
I am really busy now.

303
00:25:22,237 --> 00:25:24,702
I'll just leave this here.

304
00:25:24,702 --> 00:25:27,256
So could you bring it in?

305
00:25:27,256 --> 00:25:28,399
Huh?

306
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:29,417
What about the money?

307
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:30,967
That's right!

308
00:25:31,693 --> 00:25:33,103
The money!

309
00:25:34,665 --> 00:25:37,283
You need to give it to me, the money.

310
00:25:39,595 --> 00:25:41,081
Ah, what do i do!

311
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:18,566
Out of all those chicken places, why did he have to order from this one?

312
00:26:21,228 --> 00:26:26,261
Our destiny must not be just some regular destiny.

313
00:26:32,481 --> 00:26:33,509
Ah, Min Ah!

314
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:35,753
I can't get a hold of Joo Ri.

315
00:26:35,753 --> 00:26:39,686
They said she left really early in the morning and her phone has been off all day.

316
00:26:51,085 --> 00:26:56,747
Actually, after she found out we both got into Parang University, I haven't been able to talk or to get a hold of her.

317
00:26:57,281 --> 00:27:01,328
So, that's why I came alone when you got in the accident.

318
00:27:08,091 --> 00:27:11,112
Joo Ri, where are you?

319
00:27:11,112 --> 00:27:12,867
Where have we not gone yet?

320
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,200
- At school!
- At school!

321
00:27:24,206 --> 00:27:25,649
She is not here.

322
00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:27,018
Let's go.

323
00:27:39,044 --> 00:27:39,892
Hey!

324
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:41,230
Jong Joo Ri!

325
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,679
Oh my gosh!

326
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:45,747
I thought I was about to drop my liver! (saying for when you get surprised)

327
00:27:47,126 --> 00:27:50,130
What's up with you Jung Joo Ri? And your phone is off too.

328
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,113
What are you doing here alone?

329
00:27:52,113 --> 00:27:54,505
You are busy...

330
00:27:54,505 --> 00:27:55,948
Since you guys are college students.

331
00:27:55,948 --> 00:27:57,445
Not yet.

332
00:27:57,445 --> 00:27:59,845
We haven't graduated.

333
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,303
Sorry!

334
00:28:01,303 --> 00:28:03,700
My mind was everywhere.

335
00:28:04,056 --> 00:28:05,952
It is alright.

336
00:28:06,631 --> 00:28:09,567
I said I was going to go to the academy (cram school) this morning and left.

337
00:28:09,707 --> 00:28:12,532
I didn't want to.

338
00:28:12,786 --> 00:28:17,376
But there wasn't anywhere for me to go but school.

339
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,445
You're going to retake your SATs?

340
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:23,633
My parents are telling me to retake them and try to get into even a 2 year college.

341
00:28:23,633 --> 00:28:29,328
What will I do if I go to college? It's just a waste of money.

342
00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:32,100
Why don't they know their daughter?

343
00:28:32,655 --> 00:28:36,110
Then, tell them that you're going to do what you want to do.

344
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,150
I have to know how to do something in order for me to tell them.

345
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,389
Why would you not (have something you know how to do)?

346
00:28:40,643 --> 00:28:42,479
What is there?

347
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:50,131
You're the one that made me this hairstyle.

348
00:28:50,131 --> 00:28:50,913
You are right!

349
00:28:50,913 --> 00:28:54,275
You always tie my hair and pin it too.

350
00:28:54,861 --> 00:28:55,872
That's right.

351
00:28:55,872 --> 00:28:57,903
Our teacher did also recognize it.

352
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,085
- Of course!
- Right?

353
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:00,428
The best.

354
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:03,484
Okay.

355
00:29:03,484 --> 00:29:04,658
I'm not going to retake them!

356
00:29:04,658 --> 00:29:06,697
I'm not retaking the SATs!

357
00:29:07,191 --> 00:29:10,459
It is also the end of the annoying stuff.

358
00:29:24,281 --> 00:29:29,182
Colleges that are concerned only with names, this dirty world!

359
00:29:32,175 --> 00:29:36,565
You dirty world that only makes it easy for the pretty girls!

360
00:29:36,673 --> 00:29:38,573
Jung Joo Ri is beautiful.

361
00:29:38,573 --> 00:29:41,302
Dok Go Min Ah is pretty too!

362
00:29:45,271 --> 00:29:49,222
Anyways, congratulations to you both on going to college.

363
00:29:49,222 --> 00:29:51,648
Ah embarrassing! This isn't my style.

364
00:29:51,648 --> 00:29:52,623
We know, we know!

365
00:29:52,623 --> 00:29:54,816
So strange of you!

366
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:56,760
Don't do it.

367
00:30:03,785 --> 00:30:10,015
What's the deal about life.
You're filled with so many worries.

368
00:30:10,015 --> 00:30:14,430
Change up that frustration.

369
00:30:16,699 --> 00:30:19,547
A completely empty wallet.

370
00:30:19,547 --> 00:30:24,297
You're drenched in despair.

371
00:30:24,297 --> 00:30:28,487
I know how that feels.

372
00:30:28,487 --> 00:30:31,022
But with your...

373
00:30:31,022 --> 00:30:33,880
Heart afire!

374
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,739
Sometimes you have to face it head on.

375
00:30:36,739 --> 00:30:40,745
Sometimes you've got to cry, that is youth.

376
00:30:42,021 --> 00:30:45,147
Just kick it out.

377
00:30:45,449 --> 00:30:48,372
Sometimes you have to face it head on.

378
00:30:48,372 --> 00:30:52,495
Sometimes you've got to cry, that is youth.

379
00:30:52,495 --> 00:30:55,781
That's what it is!

380
00:31:17,357 --> 00:31:18,980
You know...

381
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,293
What?

382
00:31:20,293 --> 00:31:21,426
Here!

383
00:31:21,904 --> 00:31:22,819
What is it?

384
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:26,655
Just because I feel bad for a lot of things...

385
00:31:26,655 --> 00:31:28,252
And I'm thankful for a lot of things too.

386
00:31:28,924 --> 00:31:30,589
You could call it a graduation gift too.

387
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:33,361
You're going to do an all-in-one, is it?

388
00:31:35,608 --> 00:31:37,215
Want to see?

389
00:31:42,522 --> 00:31:43,856
What the hell is this?

390
00:31:43,856 --> 00:31:45,821
It's a head massager.

391
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:48,322
It seems like you're constantly talking about how your head hurts.

392
00:31:48,322 --> 00:31:50,640
Where did you buy something like this?

393
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,726
Definitely a gift like Oh Ha Ni.

394
00:31:54,853 --> 00:31:56,581
You don't like it?

395
00:31:57,779 --> 00:31:58,572
Want me to exchange it for something else?

396
00:31:58,572 --> 00:32:01,875
You're going to be late to your graduation? Why aren't you two coming down?

397
00:32:02,979 --> 00:32:05,238
Oh my, what's this?

398
00:32:05,238 --> 00:32:06,287
Is it a helmet?

399
00:32:07,198 --> 00:32:09,285
It's a head massager.

400
00:32:09,285 --> 00:32:12,102
Since Seung Jo uses his head a lot.

401
00:32:12,102 --> 00:32:14,321
Oh this works as a neck massager as well.

402
00:32:14,908 --> 00:32:16,341
It's a gift for Seung Jo?

403
00:32:17,225 --> 00:32:20,358
Oh goodness, you're so thoughtful.

404
00:32:21,728 --> 00:32:23,168
Try it on Seung Jo!

405
00:32:23,168 --> 00:32:25,350
I don't want to! Who in the world wears things like this!

406
00:32:28,787 --> 00:32:30,552
He's so mean.

407
00:32:31,402 --> 00:32:33,668
Goodness, this looks expensive.

408
00:32:33,668 --> 00:32:35,847
Where did you get the money?

409
00:32:35,847 --> 00:32:37,046
I took on a part-time job.

410
00:32:37,046 --> 00:32:39,096
So that's why you were late these days.

411
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:42,301
Oh my.

412
00:32:47,897 --> 00:32:50,103
Mic test. 1. 2.

413
00:32:52,773 --> 00:32:55,341
What are you going to do if you're freaking out already?

414
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:58,205
Guys, I can't breathe very well.

415
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:01,202
I've never been up on stage!

416
00:33:01,202 --> 00:33:02,048
Oh gosh.

417
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:05,960
Our homeroom teacher put on a real show in order to have you accept on behalf of our class.

418
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,648
- Really?
- That's right.

419
00:33:07,648 --> 00:33:12,324
Class 1's representative is Baek Seung Jo, and Class 7's is Oh Ha Ni.

420
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:16,690
So do a good job! Don't go up there and fall over! Crashing all over the place!

421
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,601
Don't say such negative things.

422
00:33:18,601 --> 00:33:19,685
Be careful.

423
00:33:20,405 --> 00:33:22,732
Hey Baek Seung Jo.

424
00:33:22,732 --> 00:33:24,490
I hear you got into Parang University.

425
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:27,080
Speak up. What kind of intentions do you have?

426
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,230
Intentions?

427
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,216
That's right. There are hundreds of universities.

428
00:33:31,216 --> 00:33:34,217
But I hear you've got the skills to get into Taesan University even if you took the exams with your eyes closed.

429
00:33:34,217 --> 00:33:35,882
So why the hell are you going to Parang University?

430
00:33:35,882 --> 00:33:37,377
So I could see you react like this.

431
00:33:37,377 --> 00:33:38,166
What?

432
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:39,213
You little! Till the very end I see!

433
00:33:39,213 --> 00:33:41,860
Can everyone hear?

434
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:45,093
We will now be commencing with

435
00:33:45,093 --> 00:33:47,781
Parang High School's graduation ceremony.

436
00:33:54,063 --> 00:33:54,824
Ha Ni and Seung Jo?

437
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:59,520
Though there were SAT mysteries every year...

438
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,515
This year,

439
00:34:01,515 --> 00:34:05,886
There were 2 events that were

440
00:34:05,886 --> 00:34:09,313
so absurd you couldn't really call it a mystery.

441
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,515
One of them is...

442
00:34:11,515 --> 00:34:16,983
Class 7's Oh Ha Ni getting into Parang University.

443
00:34:16,983 --> 00:34:22,759
The other one is that Class 1's Baek Seung Jo is also attending Parang University.

444
00:34:22,759 --> 00:34:24,376
Does this make any sense?!

445
00:34:24,376 --> 00:34:26,024
It doesn't make any sense!

446
00:34:31,243 --> 00:34:33,144
Next is the speech from the representative of the graduating class.

447
00:34:33,144 --> 00:34:37,007
Class 1's Baek Seung Jo.

448
00:34:51,152 --> 00:34:54,328
Oliver Wendell Holmes once said this.

449
00:34:54,328 --> 00:34:57,432
The great thing in the world...

450
00:34:57,432 --> 00:35:00,233
Is not so much where we stand,

451
00:35:00,233 --> 00:35:02,847
As in what direction we are moving.

452
00:35:02,847 --> 00:35:06,341
Today we graduate.

453
00:35:06,341 --> 00:35:08,291
After 3 years, this is how far we have come.

454
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:11,977
Once this chapter of your life ends, where will all of you go?

455
00:35:12,734 --> 00:35:14,531
To the Chinese restaurant?

456
00:35:15,218 --> 00:35:17,424
Family restaurants?

457
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:21,906
Though I joke about it,

458
00:35:21,906 --> 00:35:23,780
Even I didn't know which direction I was supposed to go.

459
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,798
Actually no, I've still yet to find it.

460
00:35:28,802 --> 00:35:32,401
But I found something out.

461
00:35:33,144 --> 00:35:37,765
It's thanks to a grandmother whose face I've never even seen.

462
00:35:38,578 --> 00:35:42,293
She said that I just need to have fun, and others need to be happy.

463
00:35:42,293 --> 00:35:45,126
She said that's how to live life.

464
00:35:45,126 --> 00:35:49,770
But as you all know, I don't have the personality to make others happy?

465
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,949
So for the time being, I'm planning on at least living a fun life.

466
00:35:53,949 --> 00:35:57,014
Though I still don't know how to yet.

467
00:35:57,014 --> 00:36:00,915
I hope for all of you out there, despite which direction your life is headed...

468
00:36:00,915 --> 00:36:04,770
I hope that road is filled with fun.

469
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,860
Thank you.

470
00:36:15,376 --> 00:36:17,216
Just have a fun life.

471
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,423
Have fun.

472
00:36:18,423 --> 00:36:19,909
Fun?

473
00:36:19,909 --> 00:36:22,789
My grandmother used to say it all the time.

474
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:27,107
Ha Ni, enjoy your life, have fun.

475
00:36:27,107 --> 00:36:29,847
You have fun, and make sure others are happy.

476
00:36:29,847 --> 00:36:31,984
She said living life like that is fine.

477
00:36:32,843 --> 00:36:34,175
Fun?

478
00:36:34,175 --> 00:36:35,490
Oh Ha Ni!

479
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:41,313
What?

480
00:36:44,074 --> 00:36:46,264
Is Class 7's Oh Ha Ni not here?

481
00:36:46,264 --> 00:36:48,911
Here! I'm here!

482
00:36:52,528 --> 00:36:54,252
It's Ha Ni!

483
00:36:57,595 --> 00:36:59,615
Along with Class 1's Baek Seung Jo...

484
00:36:59,615 --> 00:37:01,566
Class 7's Oh Ha Ni...

485
00:37:01,566 --> 00:37:03,888
They will be accepting the diplomas,

486
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,047
On behalf of the graduating seniors of Parang High School.

487
00:37:06,047 --> 00:37:08,346
Please come up to the podium.

488
00:37:40,513 --> 00:37:47,077
Do you, Baek Seung Jo, take Oh Ha Ni to be your lawfully wedded wife,

489
00:37:48,006 --> 00:37:52,301
Despite rain, snow, wind, and flowers?

490
00:37:52,301 --> 00:37:54,345
Do you vow to love and cherish her?

491
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,251
I do.

492
00:37:59,251 --> 00:38:01,418
Do you, Oh Ha Ni, take Baek Seung Jo to be your lawfully wedded husband,

493
00:38:01,418 --> 00:38:03,658
Despite...

494
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:05,908
Yes, I do!

495
00:38:18,165 --> 00:38:20,351
Ha Ni, I promise too!

496
00:38:20,351 --> 00:38:21,884
You're the only one for me!

497
00:38:21,884 --> 00:38:25,452
I'm going to look onto just you until my dying days!

498
00:38:26,126 --> 00:38:30,478
Who says?! I'm against it! I'm totally against it!

499
00:38:30,478 --> 00:38:35,205
Hey Seung Jo, you say something too! Tell him that you're totally against it too!

500
00:38:35,622 --> 00:38:37,882
Is that Baek Seung Jo's mom?

501
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,460
Baek Seung Jo's got it rough too.

502
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,728
There's Oh Ha Ni, and his mom.

503
00:38:41,728 --> 00:38:44,493
What are you doing? Hurry and come down!

504
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:04,551
Oh gosh, Oh Ha Ni.

505
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:07,146
You were so funny today.

506
00:39:07,146 --> 00:39:08,840
Seriously!

507
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,908
I told you, you were going to fall.

508
00:39:10,908 --> 00:39:16,384
Oh goodness Ha Ni, I'm sorry. I was just so worked up earlier on.

509
00:39:16,384 --> 00:39:19,392
It's fine. Did Eun Jo leave too?

510
00:39:19,392 --> 00:39:22,631
Yeah. He said I'm too embarassing.

511
00:39:22,631 --> 00:39:26,544
What does it matter? Right? What's it matter?

512
00:39:26,544 --> 00:39:28,185
It was totally like you, Oh Ha Ni.

513
00:39:28,185 --> 00:39:31,861
- You think so?
- That's right, if nothing happened you wouldn't be Oh Ha Ni.

514
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:37,611
Oh yea, but where is Seung Jo?

515
00:39:37,611 --> 00:39:39,571
I told him I wanted to take pictures.

516
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,264
I want to start school again

517
00:39:45,264 --> 00:39:47,054
And wear a school uniform like this.

518
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:51,003
Really? We're so tired of them.

519
00:39:51,883 --> 00:39:52,773
Oh!

520
00:39:57,494 --> 00:39:59,312
That's so cool!

521
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:03,570
That's what I'm talking about! That's what high school graduation is all about.

522
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:07,625
Oh, where is Seung Jo? Hurry up and find him.

523
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:09,900
Oh, he's over there.

524
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,137
Excuse me,

525
00:40:13,436 --> 00:40:15,503
Looks like they want to take pictures.

526
00:40:15,503 --> 00:40:17,261
See you later.

527
00:40:20,012 --> 00:40:22,003
Aw, poor things.

528
00:40:25,585 --> 00:40:27,039
Ha! It's Hong Jang Mi.

529
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:30,167
Seung Jo Oppa, let's take a picture.
Teacher, Wait a moment please.

530
00:40:30,167 --> 00:40:31,249
Hurry!

531
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:35,754
Ready? 1, 2, 3.

532
00:40:40,703 --> 00:40:41,721
Hey, Ha Ni.

533
00:40:42,103 --> 00:40:44,115
Go over there, let's take a picture quickly!

534
00:40:44,115 --> 00:40:44,937
Yes?

535
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,003
I don't want to.

536
00:40:47,437 --> 00:40:48,270
I'm scared.

537
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:53,888
Scared? I'm just saying you should show her how it's done.

538
00:40:54,237 --> 00:40:55,607
Baek Seung Jo!

539
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,270
Hurry.

540
00:41:03,271 --> 00:41:03,937
What?

541
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,470
You want to take a picture too?

542
00:41:07,783 --> 00:41:08,703
Yeah.

543
00:41:08,703 --> 00:41:12,437
Are you saying that you want me to take a picture with you now?

544
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,137
No.

545
00:41:14,637 --> 00:41:15,903
It doesn't.

546
00:41:16,737 --> 00:41:17,703
Sorry.

547
00:41:18,603 --> 00:41:19,403
Oh Ha Ni.

548
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,370
Come here.

549
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:24,837
Is this good enough?

550
00:41:25,503 --> 00:41:26,537
It's fine.

551
00:41:26,537 --> 00:41:27,870
Stay like that.

552
00:41:29,665 --> 00:41:31,003
Ah, so pretty!

553
00:41:32,103 --> 00:41:33,437
Thank you.

554
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,237
I'm going to take it now!

555
00:41:35,837 --> 00:41:39,103
Customer, how much money have you given me?

556
00:41:39,103 --> 00:41:40,270
2,

557
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:43,409
Please take 8,800 won from here.

558
00:41:43,409 --> 00:41:45,321
3!

559
00:41:55,670 --> 00:42:01,070
That's right Ha Ni! Today I'll make a night you'll never be able to forget.

560
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:14,170
Aigoo! Come on in! Please come this way!

561
00:42:15,237 --> 00:42:17,370
Ah what's this?! Why are class 7 here?

562
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,637
I really hate this!

563
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:22,037
We hate you too!

564
00:42:22,337 --> 00:42:24,437
Ah Ahjushi! How could you do this?

565
00:42:24,437 --> 00:42:26,603
You're from the same school so it's okay if you have fun together!

566
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:27,703
Have a great time!

567
00:42:27,703 --> 00:42:29,670
We don't get along with them!

568
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:33,937
Even on graduation day...
Hurry, hurry!

569
00:42:38,637 --> 00:42:40,303
Ha Ni.

570
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:46,103
These are my feeling for you. Do you understand?
Listen well.

571
00:42:49,037 --> 00:42:52,303
Hey Baek Seung Jo! Why are you here?

572
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:55,537
It seems like they got everything ready, so let's just stay here.

573
00:42:55,537 --> 00:42:59,370
Okay!
Great!

574
00:43:03,003 --> 00:43:05,270
Oh, oh, oh!

575
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:07,137
Urgh! Doing as he pleases!

576
00:43:07,137 --> 00:43:08,637
Urgh!

577
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:11,503
There is nothing we can do! Let's just start.

578
00:43:11,503 --> 00:43:14,703
Don't you look at us!

579
00:43:39,237 --> 00:43:42,937
You are my life's navigation

580
00:43:43,503 --> 00:43:44,837
Bong Joon Gu!

581
00:43:44,837 --> 00:43:49,303
You guide me through the road I have to take.

582
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:55,636
Please let me know about life's directions, speed

583
00:43:55,636 --> 00:43:58,570
and locations.

584
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:04,403
If it gets too hard and I start shedding tears,

585
00:44:06,403 --> 00:44:11,037
please hold me tightly.

586
00:44:12,503 --> 00:44:16,903
if I get tired and fall,

587
00:44:18,637 --> 00:44:23,270
Please reach out to me and hold my hand.

588
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:30,937
I love you, I love you, you are the one I love, I love you!

589
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:37,737
My life's navigation.

590
00:45:02,837 --> 00:45:04,370
Good-bye!

591
00:45:12,303 --> 00:45:13,137
Sir!

592
00:45:13,137 --> 00:45:15,570
Aigoo! Congratulations!

593
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:19,003
Okay, right away!
Wait a moment!

594
00:45:19,337 --> 00:45:23,737
I'm coming!
Did you enjoy your meal?

595
00:45:35,703 --> 00:45:37,837
Yes father!, ah no, Chef!

596
00:45:39,037 --> 00:45:40,937
I am at the gathering now.

597
00:45:42,303 --> 00:45:47,403
Oh really? That's really good!

598
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:48,937
Oh, right now?

599
00:45:49,603 --> 00:45:51,370
Oh really?!

600
00:45:54,526 --> 00:45:56,870
Okay, I understand. I'll leave it to you.

601
00:45:57,137 --> 00:45:57,903
Yes.

602
00:46:02,437 --> 00:46:06,937
That's right. I should look ahead into the future.
Today's not the end.

603
00:46:06,937 --> 00:46:08,470
Let's go!

604
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:14,670
Kids.

605
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:22,703
I am very proud of you. Over the course of last year, you have stayed first and...

606
00:46:22,703 --> 00:46:23,770
You guys,

607
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:28,970
you don't waste your lives on futile exams and colleges,

608
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:32,113
all of you are bright and talented in your own way

609
00:46:32,113 --> 00:46:37,337
freedom of souls, personal best, that stuff is all just intimidation

610
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:38,537
that's why you kids...

611
00:46:38,537 --> 00:46:39,637
What did you say!

612
00:46:39,637 --> 00:46:40,937
Intimidated?

613
00:46:40,937 --> 00:46:41,603
yes?

614
00:46:42,203 --> 00:46:47,537
I didn't mean to point out class 7. Why...did you feel intimidated?

615
00:46:49,337 --> 00:46:53,203
Sending students who are smart to college isn't special enough to boast about

616
00:46:53,203 --> 00:46:56,870
the happiness lies when a student on the bottom gets admitted to Parang University.

617
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:59,403
Do you know how worthwhile it is?

618
00:47:01,437 --> 00:47:07,103
Do you know how sad it feels to have a student flying sky high get crumpled up in Parang University?

619
00:47:07,437 --> 00:47:09,237
Teacher, I told you, that's not it.

620
00:47:11,609 --> 00:47:13,637
it's not because of her

621
00:47:14,037 --> 00:47:18,237
My life in the dumps, because of a stupid girl like her,

622
00:47:18,337 --> 00:47:21,070
That's an insult.

623
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:24,570
stupid?

624
00:47:26,003 --> 00:47:27,537
troublesome- idiot

625
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:30,470
Baek Seung Jo!

626
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:35,303
You're right, it's true that I have been a little troublesome to you

627
00:47:35,303 --> 00:47:36,303
Just a little?

628
00:47:38,032 --> 00:47:39,137
A lot.

629
00:47:39,803 --> 00:47:40,937
She really is an idiot.

630
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:48,303
I was taught to never boast about what you didn't earn

631
00:47:48,303 --> 00:47:51,703
just because you were born smart, doesn't give you the right to look down on other people

632
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:55,870
nobody is putting anyone down, those people just put themselves down

633
00:47:56,037 --> 00:47:59,070
You call that an inferiority complex.

634
00:48:01,637 --> 00:48:03,170
Bad jerk.

635
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:06,670
A jerk that doesn't even have one grain of human feelings.

636
00:48:06,837 --> 00:48:10,603
Rude... Icy... BAD LUCK!!!

637
00:48:10,969 --> 00:48:17,137
But then why do you love that rude, icy, bad luck jerk?

638
00:48:17,502 --> 00:48:18,295
What?

639
00:48:18,737 --> 00:48:22,269
You said that you're happy and that you liked it.

640
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:26,403
Even in your textbook, it was filled with my name.

641
00:48:29,543 --> 00:48:31,832
Therefore, could you have even studied?

642
00:48:33,103 --> 00:48:37,137
Really~ you want to take it that far, huh?

643
00:48:37,703 --> 00:48:39,770
In that case, I have something in mind too

644
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,870
You are prepared for this?

645
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:54,070
Everyone! I present to you little Baek Seung Jo!

646
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:55,170
Oh Ha Ni!

647
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:57,103
Hey! What's this?!

648
00:48:57,103 --> 00:48:59,937
Totally cute!

649
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:04,703
Did you really think I'd only have one picture?
And you call yourself a genius?

650
00:49:08,903 --> 00:49:10,170
You, come with me.

651
00:49:11,337 --> 00:49:14,737
It hurts! I said it hurts!

652
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:17,037
What do you think you're doing?!

653
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,333
What?

654
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:25,700
What are you going to do?

655
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,254
So you spilled the beans, huh?

656
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,600
Even if you try to scare me, I'm not scared!!

657
00:49:34,567 --> 00:49:37,367
The feelings I had for you...

658
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:41,900
You made it the target of ridicule in front of all those kids.

659
00:49:41,933 --> 00:49:44,867
I was getting revenge.

660
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:48,833
I want to quit now.

661
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:52,200
I don't want to like you anymore.

662
00:49:52,867 --> 00:49:55,300
Can you do that?

663
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,533
I can!

664
00:49:57,833 --> 00:50:00,667
Baek Seung Jo, your temper...

665
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:03,167
I've figured out how tiring it is.

666
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:07,600
With graduation, my crush will also come to an end.

667
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,033
I'm going to stop.

668
00:50:10,467 --> 00:50:11,967
You're going to forget me?

669
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,333
Yeah.

670
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:15,833
I'll forget someone like you, and at college I'll meet someone...

671
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:18,400
Then try to forget me.

672
00:50:39,633 --> 00:50:41,200
Looks like something else.

673
00:50:43,067 --> 00:50:44,767
Merong. (sticking tongue out)

674
00:51:00,233 --> 00:51:03,633
K... kiss?

675
00:51:04,267 --> 00:51:07,767
Did I... with Baek Seung Jo...

676
00:51:07,767 --> 00:51:13,600
Baek Seung Jo kissed me.

677
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,300
Ha Ni!

678
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,100
You said you have to go to school today!

679
00:54:15,567 --> 00:54:17,667
Ah that's right.

680
00:54:23,733 --> 00:54:26,533
You already got up.

681
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,233
Ah come on.

682
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:43,600
So thick(headed).

683
00:54:51,167 --> 00:54:57,500
Thick? Can you say that between people who kissed?

684
00:54:58,667 --> 00:55:00,733
What is this?

685
00:55:00,733 --> 00:55:03,767
I was the only one who didn't know what to do.

686
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:06,867
I'm like a dummy.

687
00:55:09,033 --> 00:55:13,467
I was wanting to see you kids in your high school uniforms as high school students again.

688
00:55:13,467 --> 00:55:17,222
But seeing you guys today, it's like seeing you as college students.

689
00:55:17,222 --> 00:55:19,467
What's wrong with me?

690
00:55:20,267 --> 00:55:21,667
Ha Ni ah.

691
00:55:21,667 --> 00:55:24,533
What do you think about Seung Jo's hairstyle?

692
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:30,767
After he said he wouldn't go, I forced him to go and get a perm.

693
00:55:30,767 --> 00:55:32,967
What do you think? It turned out good, huh?

694
00:55:32,967 --> 00:55:34,867
Yes, it looks good on him.

695
00:55:34,867 --> 00:55:37,300
See, I told you it looked okay.

696
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,100
I ate well. I'll be leaving first.

697
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:43,233
Why are you going already? There's still time.

698
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,833
Hey! You should go with Ha Ni.

699
00:55:48,933 --> 00:55:50,800
Oppa!

700
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,600
After saying to go together, he just leaves.

701
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,333
Then why did he come to the same school as me?

702
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:07,533
No...

703
00:56:07,533 --> 00:56:11,333
Aigoo, what are you talking to yourself about?

704
00:56:12,067 --> 00:56:13,867
Did you get a perm?

705
00:56:13,867 --> 00:56:15,067
Yeah.

706
00:56:15,067 --> 00:56:18,667
Beauty students get a 50% discount. How does it look?

707
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:21,100
It looks like you're wearing a helmet.

708
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:28,133
Hey when is Dok Go Min Ah coming? She's the one that wanted to get lunch together.

709
00:56:28,133 --> 00:56:30,800
I'm here.

710
00:56:42,033 --> 00:56:44,300
Are you Min Ah?

711
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:45,300
What's wrong?

712
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:48,067
Hey, I saw you earlier.

713
00:56:48,067 --> 00:56:50,500
But I couldn't recognize you!

714
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,433
What's up... you look so cool!

715
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,396
You're really pretty.

716
00:56:55,396 --> 00:56:55,837
You like it?

717
00:56:55,837 --> 00:56:57,167
Yeah.

718
00:57:01,367 --> 00:57:06,233
Should I retake the SATs?

719
00:57:06,233 --> 00:57:08,100
You threw away all your books.

720
00:57:16,233 --> 00:57:18,500
What is it Oh Ha Ni...

721
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,333
Something happened didn't it?

722
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:24,600
What is it? Hurry up and tell us.

723
00:57:24,933 --> 00:57:26,533
What?

724
00:57:26,533 --> 00:57:28,590
Why do you keep covering your mouth?

725
00:57:32,967 --> 00:57:36,633
Actually... I kissed.

726
00:57:36,967 --> 00:57:38,296
What did you say?

727
00:57:41,123 --> 00:57:43,195
WHAT!!! KISSED???

728
00:57:44,204 --> 00:57:46,333
When? Where? How was it?

729
00:57:46,333 --> 00:57:47,433
You're being too loud.

730
00:57:47,433 --> 00:57:49,906
If you guys kissed, doesn't that make you guys a couple?

731
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:53,853
But... what should I call it?

732
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,900
It was like he was playing around.

733
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:00,867
What are you talking about? It's a kiss, a kiss. You said you did it?

734
00:58:00,867 --> 00:58:03,059
I'm going to tell everyone.

735
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:04,100
Hey!

736
00:58:06,067 --> 00:58:10,133
Oh Ha Ni, you have some good luck.

737
00:58:17,767 --> 00:58:19,433
You like it, you liked it didn't you?

738
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,167
Are you alright Ha Ni-ya?

739
00:58:28,167 --> 00:58:29,267
Are you ok?

740
00:58:30,233 --> 00:58:31,367
Yes.

741
00:58:31,367 --> 00:58:33,033
Are you okay?

742
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,167
You didn't get hit, did you?

743
00:58:43,767 --> 00:58:47,100
Yes. I'm sorry.

744
00:58:47,667 --> 00:58:49,167
Are you a new student?

745
00:58:49,167 --> 00:58:50,067
Yes.

746
00:58:51,333 --> 00:58:52,267
Welcome.

747
00:58:52,267 --> 00:58:54,133
Pardon?

748
00:59:10,933 --> 00:59:13,067
Where is it?

749
00:59:17,167 --> 00:59:18,067
You're coming later, right?

750
00:59:18,067 --> 00:59:19,967
No, I don't think I'll be able to go.

751
00:59:20,067 --> 00:59:21,400
He's over there.

752
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:23,967
Oh Ha Ni!

753
00:59:41,133 --> 00:59:43,033
Hi!

754
00:59:43,033 --> 00:59:45,167
Hi. Hi.

755
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:47,800
What, is there something?

756
00:59:49,481 --> 00:59:54,033
I just wanted to see what your class looked like.

757
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,367
I was curious.

758
00:59:55,367 --> 00:59:56,767
did they really kiss?

759
00:59:56,767 --> 00:59:57,833
kiss?

760
00:59:57,833 --> 00:59:59,733
she's so weak

761
01:00:01,067 --> 01:00:03,567
Oh, we meet again.

762
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,900
Your girlfriend?

763
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:14,100
There's no way.

764
01:00:18,533 --> 01:00:20,633
So it's like that.

765
01:00:20,633 --> 01:00:23,267
Seung Jo, do you want to go to the cafe and get tea?

766
01:00:23,267 --> 01:00:25,833
No, I'm off now.

767
01:00:59,200 --> 01:00:59,933
Episode 7 Preview

768
01:00:59,933 --> 01:01:00,667
Chef! Chef!

769
01:01:00,667 --> 01:01:03,400
Joon Gu, do you like Ha Ni that much?

770
01:01:07,833 --> 01:01:08,733
brother

771
01:01:08,733 --> 01:01:09,800
Is this your friend?

772
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,500
Yes... Oppa.

773
01:01:19,533 --> 01:01:20,467
What?
