1
00:00:46,987 --> 00:00:48,787
Stop right there!

2
00:00:50,253 --> 00:00:51,253
Hey!

3
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,969
Hey stop right there you punk!

4
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,120
Hey!

5
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,220
Baek Seung Jo is running with me
Oh! it doesn't seem true.

6
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,444
It really doesn't seem true.

7
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,520
Thanks to you, I get to experience situations that I never thought I would.

8
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,400
Sorry...

9
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,987
But working out did have some benefits.
After seeing you being able to follow well.

10
00:01:36,525 --> 00:01:41,853
But, you knew?
That we were following you?

11
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:45,687
It would be weird if I didn't know. You're obvious.

12
00:01:45,687 --> 00:01:47,920
I didn't have a choice.

13
00:01:48,853 --> 00:01:52,320
When I found out you were going to watch a movie with Hae Ra...

14
00:01:52,587 --> 00:01:53,953
Without knowing...

15
00:01:55,347 --> 00:01:59,553
But if you happen to like Hae Ra,

16
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,834
That is something... I can do nothing about.

17
00:02:11,387 --> 00:02:12,521
Do you want to go somewhere?

18
00:02:13,153 --> 00:02:13,961
What?

19
00:02:14,687 --> 00:02:16,608
I'm asking if you want to go somewhere?

20
00:02:36,187 --> 00:02:37,753
It's like a dream...

21
00:02:38,153 --> 00:02:39,820
Me being with Seung Jo.

22
00:02:40,187 --> 00:02:41,487
With Seung Jo.

23
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:48,753
It feels like I'm having a life time of happiness on this one day.
I'm happy now

24
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:57,953
But, it looks like only families are here.

25
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,887
We are the only ones who look like a couple.

26
00:03:01,887 --> 00:03:08,287
Of course.
There is a rumor that says, If a couple comes here together, they would break up in six months.

27
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:09,519
You didn't know?
What?

28
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,453
You didn't know? It's well known.

29
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,187
After all, we shouldn't care, since we are not dating.

30
00:03:18,993 --> 00:03:21,487
You know what?
Let's just get out of here!

31
00:03:29,687 --> 00:03:30,720
What to do?!

32
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,953
Wear it until your clothes dry.

33
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,987
It's cheap, but it's better than wearing wet clothes.

34
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,953
They were selling them by the road.

35
00:04:01,053 --> 00:04:02,387
You don't like it?

36
00:04:04,353 --> 00:04:05,687
It's the same?

37
00:04:07,953 --> 00:04:10,153
Then, it's couple t-shirts?

38
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,720
Hamburger!

39
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,860
I was so hungry.

40
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,520
It's really good.

41
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,420
Better than the delicious French or Italian food.

42
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,387
I won't be able to eat such a delicious hamburger again.

43
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:47,820
I wish time would stop right here.

44
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,053
Eat! Don't just look at it

45
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:56,653
But, why did you take my hand and run earlier?

46
00:04:56,987 --> 00:04:58,753
You were with Hae Ra. . .

47
00:04:58,753 --> 00:05:02,653
That's because. . . You were the one closest to me.

48
00:05:04,353 --> 00:05:05,620
Thank you.

49
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,753
I keep causing trouble all the time.

50
00:05:08,753 --> 00:05:14,520
I haven't really experienced something that was difficult for me.

51
00:05:15,853 --> 00:05:21,653
But after you showed up...
I feel like I'm living in a completely different world.

52
00:05:22,653 --> 00:05:26,920
I feel like I'm solving a sudden problem without an answer.

53
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,853
That may be an ordeal that I should get over.

54
00:05:31,553 --> 00:05:35,620
Something I can't avoid, something I have to solve.

55
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:39,753
Is the ordeal...possibly me?

56
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:46,553
At first, I wondered about how to react to it and just wanted to avoid it.

57
00:05:47,153 --> 00:05:51,787
But now, I won't run from it.

58
00:05:52,887 --> 00:05:58,120
If the problem is not wrong, then there has to be an answer.

59
00:05:59,253 --> 00:06:00,687
I'm going to approach it head on.

60
00:06:00,687 --> 00:06:01,453
Huh?

61
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,287
You're going to face me head on?

62
00:06:05,253 --> 00:06:06,520
If you don't get it then forget it.

63
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,953
No, I get it.

64
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:15,887
So, I am an ordeal to you and you were only trying to run away.

65
00:06:16,187 --> 00:06:18,853
But you changed your mind, and now, you are with me.

66
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:25,520
Are you proposing to me?!

67
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,853
How could you have come to that conclusion?

68
00:06:29,787 --> 00:06:31,787
I'm telling you that I don't dislike you.

69
00:06:32,387 --> 00:06:36,987
Being with you isn't easy but I'm just saying I don't hate it.

70
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,420
Thank you.

71
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:47,053
I really thought that you hated me.

72
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,553
Ever since high school, I have only liked you.

73
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,120
I don't know anything about Sartre or Nietzsche .
And I can't even cook.

74
00:06:57,653 --> 00:06:59,653
And I'm not glamorous,

75
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,120
But still, I'll try my best.
I'll know to always try my best .

76
00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:06,453
Really?

77
00:07:07,853 --> 00:07:09,253
I'm looking forward to it.

78
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,220
What?

79
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,020
You getting smarter for me... I'm looking forward to it.

80
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,187
Okay. Since the midterms are not that far away,

81
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:25,553
That confession... I'll make sure of it with the test results. Okay?

82
00:07:25,553 --> 00:07:27,120
Midterms?

83
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,487
But I hate exams.

84
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:34,787
Is there anyone who likes exams?

85
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,153
Then, can I get a C?

86
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:40,487
C?!

87
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:43,687
What are you talking about getting a C.

88
00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:45,187
Then C+?

89
00:08:01,953 --> 00:08:08,287
His words were as mischievous as always, but his smile was a little different from before.

90
00:08:08,953 --> 00:08:14,120
More than the day I gave him my first love letter, more than the day we first kissed,

91
00:08:14,987 --> 00:08:18,687
I think Baek Seung Jo feels closer to me.

92
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,787
Thank you. You even walked me home.

93
00:08:38,353 --> 00:08:40,453
It's like a perfect date.

94
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,020
Is it okay living here?

95
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,020
Since it is a guest room, it is kind of small. But it's tolerable.

96
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,886
I'm only staying here for a little bit anyways.

97
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:54,820
We're staying here until the new house is built.

98
00:08:57,687 --> 00:08:59,153
Will it be okay?

99
00:08:59,153 --> 00:09:00,020
What?

100
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:05,287
I'm talking about Hae Ra.
She was the one you were meeting today. . .

101
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:07,753
How could you have parted that way.

102
00:09:07,753 --> 00:09:10,620
Well, since she was with Kyung Su Sunbae.

103
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:27,487
Excuse me, Hae Ra.
I have something to tell you.

104
00:09:28,053 --> 00:09:33,353
It's really hard for me to say, so I hope you will listen.

105
00:09:35,987 --> 00:09:39,653
I know. I am not good enough.

106
00:09:39,653 --> 00:09:40,587
Pardon?

107
00:09:40,987 --> 00:09:42,453
Not good enough?

108
00:09:45,187 --> 00:09:46,387
Then have mine too.

109
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:49,987
I didn't mean... Foo... food is enough.

110
00:09:51,187 --> 00:09:53,320
I'll continue.

111
00:09:54,553 --> 00:10:01,687
I have tried my best not to think about it,

112
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:09,220
But I keep thinking of you. . .

113
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,187
Should I just leave? I have a headache.

114
00:10:12,187 --> 00:10:17,387
You have a headache? then, you should take some medicine for it.

115
00:10:17,387 --> 00:10:20,820
Take your time, I will pay and leave now.

116
00:10:28,687 --> 00:10:34,853
Hae Ra. I know that I lack a lot of things.
That's why

117
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:41,853
I decided to try hard and not think of you

118
00:10:42,087 --> 00:10:45,787
Recently, thoughts of you just fill my head.

119
00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:53,753
That's what I wanted to say.

120
00:11:23,973 --> 00:11:25,573
Dad! What?

121
00:11:26,473 --> 00:11:27,873
Oh,

122
00:11:27,873 --> 00:11:29,573
Did something good happen today?

123
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:30,873
Huh?

124
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:33,707
No, what good thing?

125
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:41,640
Aigoo, I wish something good happened to us.

126
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,340
Why?
Did something happen?

127
00:11:45,307 --> 00:11:48,073
Oh, it's not that...

128
00:11:50,831 --> 00:11:54,007
I think it's going to take a long time to build the new house.

129
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,807
I can't get insurance on it since it's done by natural disasters.

130
00:11:59,473 --> 00:12:02,740
And the company who was supposed to construct

131
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,473
are just shrinking from their responsibility.

132
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,073
Then what should we do, Dad?

133
00:12:09,073 --> 00:12:10,973
Ah, don't worry.

134
00:12:11,173 --> 00:12:14,040
It will be resolved, but it will take some time.

135
00:12:14,907 --> 00:12:17,498
Although it might be uncomfortable,

136
00:12:17,498 --> 00:12:19,907
plan on staying here for a while.

137
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,873
Yes.

138
00:12:22,273 --> 00:12:24,040
I am sorry, Ha Ni!

139
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,507
What's there for you to be sorry about?

140
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,539
Don't worry about me.

141
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:32,243
I am fine.

142
00:12:35,573 --> 00:12:36,872
Okay.

143
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,698
Oh!

144
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,107
Hi!

145
00:12:58,107 --> 00:12:59,273
Did you get home safely?

146
00:12:59,273 --> 00:13:00,440
Yesterday?

147
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,607
Ah yes, of course! I did get home safely.

148
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:07,373
I knew you would be safe because of Kyung Sunbae.

149
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:10,540
But, it seems like you did worry about me.

150
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,040
Anyways, it was fun. It was like we were shooting a movie.

151
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,453
"Running from Gangsters"

152
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:18,986
I'm glad that you got home safely.

153
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:21,653
Let's go inside.

154
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:27,653
Look at this. Wonderful perfection, a goddess.

155
00:13:28,286 --> 00:13:29,753
You sure did take a lot of pictures.

156
00:13:29,753 --> 00:13:31,419
Wow, look at this. She looks pretty, right?

157
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:34,486
So, what happened yesterday?

158
00:13:34,953 --> 00:13:36,953
You did have a date, right?

159
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:40,951
What date? We just ate and left right after.

160
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:43,519
Ah, I should have paid for the food.

161
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,186
Ah, what is that?!

162
00:13:46,186 --> 00:13:49,053
How could you when you had the perfect chance?!

163
00:13:49,053 --> 00:13:51,386
You should have confessed.

164
00:13:51,886 --> 00:13:55,719
Confession... I did plan on doing it.

165
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:59,019
But strangely when I just look at Hae Ra, my mind goes blank.

166
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:01,153
Nonsense just comes out of my mouth.

167
00:14:01,153 --> 00:14:07,519
And I wonder if a guy like me looking at Hae Ra is just unfulfilled longing.

168
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,686
Why? You do have charisma.

169
00:14:10,686 --> 00:14:12,386
I know I have charisma.

170
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:15,319
But strangely in front of Hae Ra...

171
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:18,219
Then, did you confess to Seung Jo?

172
00:14:19,619 --> 00:14:22,419
I had written a love letter before.

173
00:14:23,573 --> 00:14:26,853
Letter! Wow, why didn't I think of that? Letter.

174
00:14:26,853 --> 00:14:29,086
Aigoo, you should never do that!

175
00:14:29,642 --> 00:14:32,853
Hae Ra is like a girl version of Baek Seung Jo.

176
00:14:33,153 --> 00:14:35,419
If you write a letter, you'll just embarrass yourself.

177
00:14:35,419 --> 00:14:40,453
Just look directly into her eyes and confess.

178
00:14:40,453 --> 00:14:42,753
Girls like that the best.

179
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:47,419
I can't even look at her right. What do you mean look her in the eyes?

180
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:50,853
Why? You can practice.

181
00:14:50,853 --> 00:14:54,986
Here. Just think that I'm Hae Ra.

182
00:14:54,986 --> 00:14:56,219
Should I?

183
00:15:08,353 --> 00:15:08,986
That won't work.

184
00:15:08,986 --> 00:15:12,186
Why? You can practice. Just try it again.

185
00:15:12,186 --> 00:15:15,253
How can I imagine you as Hae Ra?

186
00:15:15,253 --> 00:15:16,853
You try. I'm Baek Seung Jo. Try it.

187
00:15:16,853 --> 00:15:19,419
I am Baek Sung Jo, Baek Sung Jo.

188
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:30,186
At a time when she's not even thinking, when she bites her tongue...

189
00:15:30,186 --> 00:15:31,586
That's when it's easy to get them to fall for you!

190
00:15:31,586 --> 00:15:33,719
When she bites her tongue.

191
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:35,619
Hey, Hey! What are you doing?

192
00:15:36,053 --> 00:15:37,286
Are you crazy? Why are you doing this?

193
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:38,653
This is practice.

194
00:15:38,653 --> 00:15:40,186
Practice?

195
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:42,453
The timing is important. Look at this.

196
00:15:42,453 --> 00:15:43,619
If the girl says

197
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:45,353
"What is this? What are you doing?!"

198
00:15:45,353 --> 00:15:48,186
then you put your hands like this

199
00:15:48,186 --> 00:15:49,953
"If you can forget me, try forgetting me."

200
00:15:49,953 --> 00:15:52,719
and just go in for the kiss.

201
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,319
Hey!

202
00:15:55,319 --> 00:15:56,919
You have talent, it's very real.

203
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:59,886
- Really?
- Wow, so if the girls say "What are you doing?"

204
00:15:59,886 --> 00:16:02,586
Then, slam... "If you can forget me, try forgetting me"

205
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,619
Wait!

206
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:08,286
Here, the timing is important. When the girl lifts her head like this...

207
00:16:08,286 --> 00:16:08,653
Then,

208
00:16:08,653 --> 00:16:10,753
When she lifts her head...

209
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:12,953
"Why? What are you doing?"

210
00:16:12,953 --> 00:16:15,519
Slam.
" Try to forget me if you can."

211
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,153
That's right.

212
00:16:17,153 --> 00:16:18,286
That's it!

213
00:16:19,286 --> 00:16:20,645
You won't be able to forget it, right?

214
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:22,853
I won't be able to forget it. Wow, this is really great!

215
00:16:23,386 --> 00:16:24,886
Timing...

216
00:16:24,886 --> 00:16:27,586
Ha Ni, you are very good at kissing.

217
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,686
No. Truthfully, I don't really know about it.

218
00:16:29,686 --> 00:16:31,653
What are you talking about? If you're at this level, you'll be able to publish a book.

219
00:16:31,653 --> 00:16:34,607
Isn't she hard to understand?

220
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:38,153
In the tennis club, the girl who follows Baek Seung Jo around.

221
00:16:38,153 --> 00:16:40,386
You heard about that too? Is that rumor true?

222
00:16:40,386 --> 00:16:42,219
Yes.

223
00:16:42,219 --> 00:16:44,853
There must be a fun rumor going around.

224
00:16:44,853 --> 00:16:49,519
Ah. A student at our school left the guy she had a crush on...

225
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,019
and supposedly kissed another guy.

226
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:56,119
On top of that, it was in broad daylight at school.

227
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:59,253
How could she? Dumping someone like Baek Seung Jo.

228
00:16:59,253 --> 00:17:00,886
Dumping?!

229
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,386
That doesn't make sense.

230
00:17:02,386 --> 00:17:05,586
With a completely old looking sunbae.

231
00:17:05,586 --> 00:17:06,753
Ah, that girl! Really!

232
00:17:06,753 --> 00:17:09,086
Oh, look here! If you just leave like this...

233
00:17:09,086 --> 00:17:10,053
Unnie!

234
00:17:14,886 --> 00:17:16,719
Seung Jo came. He came.

235
00:17:17,086 --> 00:17:19,886
- It seems like Seung Jo doesn't know about it.
- He doesn't.

236
00:17:19,886 --> 00:17:22,353
Oh Ha Ni even kissed Kyung Sunbae.

237
00:17:22,353 --> 00:17:25,153
Then, what happens with Baek Seung Jo?

238
00:17:25,153 --> 00:17:27,686
What do you mean? Oh Ha Ni dumped him.

239
00:17:27,686 --> 00:17:29,553
Dumped?

240
00:17:29,553 --> 00:17:31,953
What is it you want to say?

241
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,019
Hae Ra, I...

242
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:46,186
It's fine. I'll just leave for today.

243
00:17:47,886 --> 00:17:50,453
But, Hae Ra...

244
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:56,953
Sunbae!

245
00:17:56,953 --> 00:18:00,153
Let go. I'm going to do it! If she wants to forget, she'll forget. I'm going to do it!

246
00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:02,853
- Wait a minute.
- Hey!

247
00:18:02,853 --> 00:18:04,753
Put the racket down.

248
00:18:04,753 --> 00:18:06,919
Let go of me! I'm going to do that.

249
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,519
No, no!

250
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:10,753
- Ah, no!
- Ha Ni!

251
00:18:10,753 --> 00:18:12,386
Oh Ha Ni ah!

252
00:18:12,486 --> 00:18:15,353
Ha Ni ah! Ah..

253
00:18:16,186 --> 00:18:18,565
Oh, Ha Ni ah!

254
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:22,286
- Oh Ha Ni!
- You're going to leave already?

255
00:18:22,286 --> 00:18:27,186
What do you mean? Me with Kyung Sunbae?

256
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,753
They were right?

257
00:18:29,753 --> 00:18:31,519
You did do it?

258
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:32,653
Kiss?

259
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,519
That's not it.

260
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:37,353
I was so frustrated that I was just educating him.

261
00:18:37,353 --> 00:18:39,019
Educating?

262
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:41,119
Educating about what?

263
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,273
Perhaps...

264
00:18:43,273 --> 00:18:44,153
Sex education!

265
00:18:44,153 --> 00:18:48,053
Hey, sex education?! It's not that.

266
00:18:48,686 --> 00:18:52,053
Oh, I'm so sorry.

267
00:18:59,395 --> 00:19:01,345
Rumors have spread everywhere.

268
00:19:01,345 --> 00:19:02,553
Huh?!

269
00:19:07,243 --> 00:19:08,845
Are you sad?

270
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:11,423
Since the girl that was following you has left?

271
00:19:13,696 --> 00:19:14,999
Seung Jo ah!

272
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:22,860
Oh, it's the main lead of the rumor.

273
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,549
Miss Calm Cat,

274
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:27,496
When did you become like that with Kyung sunbae?

275
00:19:27,496 --> 00:19:29,000
Have you heard?

276
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,835
The rumor that doesn't make any sense.

277
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:32,228
I'm leaving first.

278
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,200
Good luck

279
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,030
Congratulations.

280
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,104
Can you stay here by yourself until your brother comes back?

281
00:19:54,104 --> 00:19:55,954
Of course.

282
00:19:55,954 --> 00:19:57,758
I don't know when Seung Jo is coming though.

283
00:19:57,758 --> 00:19:59,019
Do you think I'm a baby?

284
00:19:59,391 --> 00:20:00,759
I also....

285
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:01,954
need to spend some time alone.

286
00:20:01,954 --> 00:20:04,160
Look at you.

287
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,263
That's right.

288
00:20:05,263 --> 00:20:07,280
Alright, Eun Jo, We'll see you tomorrow.

289
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,463
Hurry!

290
00:20:08,463 --> 00:20:09,879
Don't play too many games.

291
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:11,154
I won't.

292
00:20:11,154 --> 00:20:12,231
Just leave quickly.

293
00:20:12,231 --> 00:20:14,468
Let's go.
Ok

294
00:20:14,468 --> 00:20:16,597
Aigoo

295
00:20:21,603 --> 00:20:23,609
Alright!

296
00:20:48,571 --> 00:20:50,869
Oh!

297
00:21:10,908 --> 00:21:15,691
"Seung Jo ah"

298
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:58,277
I came all the way here without even realizing it.

299
00:22:00,181 --> 00:22:03,757
How did I end up here?

300
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:07,542
And it wasn't that long ago when I was so happy that we had our first date.

301
00:22:20,497 --> 00:22:23,076
What is that sound?

302
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:29,043
Mother!, Eun Jo ah!

303
00:22:29,043 --> 00:22:30,994
Ouch!!

304
00:22:32,689 --> 00:22:34,663
Eun Jo ah!

305
00:22:35,475 --> 00:22:38,772
You.....Eun Jo ah!

306
00:22:40,087 --> 00:22:43,184
Eun Jo ah!, Eun Jo what's wrong?

307
00:22:43,184 --> 00:22:44,483
My stomach.

308
00:22:44,483 --> 00:22:45,901
Your stomach hurts?

309
00:22:45,901 --> 00:22:47,882
What about you mother?, Where is she?

310
00:22:49,686 --> 00:22:50,647
Vaca...

311
00:22:50,647 --> 00:22:52,124
Vacation?

312
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,655
What to do ?

313
00:22:55,143 --> 00:22:56,721
Hold on!

314
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,184
Hello.

315
00:23:03,184 --> 00:23:04,616
Baek Seung Jo!

316
00:23:05,474 --> 00:23:07,960
Why are you calling from our house?

317
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,489
Eun Jo is...Eun Jo is in pain!

318
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:12,968
Eun Jo?

319
00:23:12,968 --> 00:23:14,601
What happened to Eun Jo?

320
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:17,896
He seems very sick.

321
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,059
What to do?

322
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:20,197
What should I do?!

323
00:23:20,197 --> 00:23:21,358
Oh Han Ni calm down.

324
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,605
Calm down and explain it clearly.

325
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:25,770
What happened to Eun Jo?

326
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,059
He said his stomach hurts.

327
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:29,360
He keeps throwing up.

328
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,646
Really?

329
00:23:31,358 --> 00:23:33,130
It might be appendicitis.

330
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:36,581
Write down what I'm about to tell you and act accordingly.

331
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:40,468
Place him on his side so he doesn't choke on anything.

332
00:23:44,717 --> 00:23:46,389
Keep his body warm.

333
00:23:46,389 --> 00:23:48,223
Keep in mind how many times he threw up

334
00:23:48,223 --> 00:23:49,384
and then, tell the doctor.

335
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:50,638
Hold on.

336
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,048
Then call the ambulance.

337
00:23:52,048 --> 00:23:52,698
This is 119, right?

338
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:53,541
after that..

339
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:54,748
Bring him to Parang University Hospital.

340
00:23:54,748 --> 00:23:55,591
He's an elementary school student.

341
00:23:55,591 --> 00:23:57,651
I'll get there as soon as possible.

342
00:23:57,651 --> 00:23:59,183
Oh Ha Ni..

343
00:23:59,926 --> 00:24:02,759
Take care of Eun Jo.

344
00:24:21,699 --> 00:24:23,193
It's a type of intestinal obstruction.

345
00:24:23,193 --> 00:24:25,213
An intussusception has occurred in the affected region.

346
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,142
An intussusception?

347
00:24:26,142 --> 00:24:29,841
It's when part of the intestine folds into another part, sort of like a collapsible telescope.

348
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:32,664
It's pretty far in so we must operate on it immediately.

349
00:24:32,664 --> 00:24:33,418
Surgery?

350
00:24:33,418 --> 00:24:37,555
Complications can arise due to a perforated intenstine so you need to hurry and make a decision.

351
00:24:37,555 --> 00:24:38,657
But....

352
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:40,375
What to do?

353
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,793
It's not a serious surgery.

354
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:47,702
Oh Ha Ni, take care of Eun Jo.

355
00:24:47,702 --> 00:24:52,218
I understand. Begin the surgery.

356
00:25:09,749 --> 00:25:10,910
You came?

357
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,792
Yes.

358
00:25:14,253 --> 00:25:16,761
Eun Jo is having surgery.

359
00:25:16,761 --> 00:25:18,897
I heard about it.

360
00:25:26,697 --> 00:25:28,703
How did it go?

361
00:25:28,703 --> 00:25:31,552
It was as I had thought. His intestine was folded into itself.

362
00:25:31,552 --> 00:25:32,713
Did the surgery end?

363
00:25:32,713 --> 00:25:35,290
Yes, it went well, you don't have to worry.

364
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:39,516
A part of his intestine was folded into the bottom of it, so we opened up his stomach,

365
00:25:39,516 --> 00:25:41,513
And returned it to normal.

366
00:25:41,513 --> 00:25:44,555
After about a week, you won't be able to notice the cut.

367
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:50,755
-Baek Eun Jo
-No Ri.

368
00:26:01,784 --> 00:26:04,222
Thank you.

369
00:26:28,966 --> 00:26:30,461
My parents...

370
00:26:30,461 --> 00:26:33,199
are coming up on an evening flight.

371
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:34,919
Uhmm..

372
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:36,389
They must have been very surprised.

373
00:26:36,389 --> 00:26:39,266
The doctor complimented you.

374
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:41,722
He said your quick actions made the surgery easier.

375
00:26:42,424 --> 00:26:45,205
If you hadn't told me how,

376
00:26:45,205 --> 00:26:48,642
I wouldn't have been able to do anything

377
00:26:50,407 --> 00:26:55,608
It's a type of obstruction to the intestines.

378
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:59,137
I had no idea.

379
00:26:59,137 --> 00:27:01,363
I really...

380
00:27:01,363 --> 00:27:04,710
had no idea that such a scary thing could happen.

381
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:13,255
I will call my dad.

382
00:27:13,255 --> 00:27:15,438
He must be worried.

383
00:27:15,438 --> 00:27:17,481
Oh Ha Ni!

384
00:27:20,128 --> 00:27:24,772
Ah, my cellphone and my wallet...

385
00:27:24,772 --> 00:27:28,046
where did I leave it all?

386
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:30,954
I, really...

387
00:27:30,954 --> 00:27:33,711
How old am I that I'm already...

388
00:27:40,622 --> 00:27:42,605
You know..

389
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,876
That rumor with Kyung Soo sunbae...

390
00:27:53,054 --> 00:27:56,630
He explained everything to me already.

391
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:07,961
Thank you Oh Ha Ni.

392
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:16,877
I was afraid...

393
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:21,041
that I might do something wrong.

394
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:24,610
So, something might go wrong with Eun Jo.

395
00:28:30,731 --> 00:28:32,690
Everything is alright now.

396
00:28:43,364 --> 00:28:45,600
It's the first time that I heard..

397
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,376
warm words from Baek Seung Jo.

398
00:28:49,376 --> 00:28:52,734
Since my anxious feelings were all relieved...

399
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:54,795
My eyes and heart...

400
00:28:54,795 --> 00:28:58,371
I cried so much they nearly melted away.

401
00:29:11,343 --> 00:29:13,491
Hello!

402
00:29:13,491 --> 00:29:14,443
Hi Eun Jo.

403
00:29:14,443 --> 00:29:17,310
Omo! You made it today.

404
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,143
The flowers smells good.

405
00:29:20,143 --> 00:29:23,677
It's Oh Ha Ni again?? She doesn't even get tired and comes very often...

406
00:29:23,677 --> 00:29:24,843
Baek Eun Jo.

407
00:29:24,843 --> 00:29:27,610
How could you talk to your life saver like that??

408
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:29,177
That's alright.

409
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:31,210
It seems like you're not getting tested today.

410
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,010
Yes.

411
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:34,810
In the end, her motive for coming here is about hyung anyways.

412
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,810
Here you go again.

413
00:29:42,343 --> 00:29:43,543
Seung Jo didn't come yet?

414
00:29:43,543 --> 00:29:45,210
See, I told you.

415
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,343
It's all about Seung Jo.

416
00:29:46,343 --> 00:29:48,177
If you keep saying that...

417
00:29:48,177 --> 00:29:49,777
He'll be coming soon.

418
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:53,710
It seems that Ha Ni should come back home.

419
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,377
Again?

420
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,710
You came?

421
00:30:00,577 --> 00:30:03,143
Baek Seung Jo, even if you talk like that...

422
00:30:03,143 --> 00:30:05,743
Seung Jo, now that you know Ha Ni you feel great right?

423
00:30:06,643 --> 00:30:08,043
Eun Jo, are you okay?

424
00:30:13,777 --> 00:30:15,377
How is Eun Jo?

425
00:30:15,377 --> 00:30:18,777
We would be in big trouble if Ha Ni wasn't there.

426
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:19,843
True.

427
00:30:19,843 --> 00:30:22,243
It would have been a disaster without Ha Ni.

428
00:30:22,243 --> 00:30:23,877
Thank you.

429
00:30:23,877 --> 00:30:25,710
Thank you, Oh Ki Dong.

430
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:28,043
It's a relief that everything is fine.

431
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:33,843
How is the building of your house coming along? Is it doing alright?

432
00:30:33,843 --> 00:30:37,243
You know, it's a major pain.

433
00:30:37,243 --> 00:30:44,377
It happened because of the earthquake so the insurance won't really pay for it either.

434
00:30:44,377 --> 00:30:48,010
We're still fighting over it right now.

435
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,843
It'll all go well, I guess.

436
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,677
Well, here.

437
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,477
What is this?

438
00:31:01,477 --> 00:31:06,510
The monthly rent you paid us while you were living in our home.

439
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:10,077
This person couldn't bring herself to use it.

440
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,977
Why are you giving this back to me?

441
00:31:12,977 --> 00:31:16,310
You shouldn't do this. You helped us so much during that time.

442
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,610
I can't accept this. Here.

443
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,277
Ki Dong shi, are you really going to be like that?

444
00:31:21,277 --> 00:31:23,443
If you don't accept it, I'm going to be mad.

445
00:31:23,443 --> 00:31:24,977
Yes.

446
00:31:24,977 --> 00:31:27,177
Just as your restaurant was getting really popular..

447
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:30,510
I know that you were going to build a second floor.

448
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,443
And because of the new house, and Ha Ni...

449
00:31:32,443 --> 00:31:35,810
I also know that you couldn't do anything.

450
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,977
But, still... this.

451
00:31:36,977 --> 00:31:40,077
Ki Dong shi, don't be like that and...

452
00:31:40,077 --> 00:31:43,410
just come live with us again? Yes?

453
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,310
I came out because of Ha Ni.

454
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,777
This is better for Ha Ni.

455
00:31:47,777 --> 00:31:50,677
Pardon? For Ha Ni?

456
00:31:50,677 --> 00:31:53,677
How can you not know your daughter's heart?

457
00:31:55,777 --> 00:32:02,777
Actually, Ha Ni and Seung Jo... you don't know that they're trying to hide something from us do you?

458
00:32:02,777 --> 00:32:04,810
Pardon? Hide something?

459
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:08,310
Those two have even kissed!

460
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:11,143
And Seung Jo did it first.

461
00:32:11,143 --> 00:32:12,243
Kiss?

462
00:32:12,243 --> 00:32:13,410
Seung Jo did?

463
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,343
Yes.

464
00:32:15,343 --> 00:32:20,277
So, Seung Jo liked Ha Ni all along.

465
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,277
Hello, Eun Jo!

466
00:32:27,277 --> 00:32:29,277
You came again?

467
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,977
Go Ri, hello!

468
00:32:32,977 --> 00:32:35,010
It's not Go Ri, it's No Ri!

469
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,677
That's right.

470
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:39,043
Hello, No Ri!

471
00:32:39,043 --> 00:32:40,677
Hello.

472
00:32:43,743 --> 00:32:47,210
I brought cake to give to you.

473
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,677
So Ri, you're going to eat too, right?

474
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:51,010
No Ri, No Ri!

475
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:55,143
I'm sorry. I'm not that smart.

476
00:32:55,143 --> 00:32:56,477
No, it's okay.

477
00:32:56,477 --> 00:33:00,543
Everywhere I went, the hospital rooms were so quiet that it was no fun.

478
00:33:00,543 --> 00:33:02,410
But, it's fun and nice here.

479
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:05,377
No Ri, have you been in the hospital for a long time?

480
00:33:05,377 --> 00:33:09,877
Yes, about 1 year and 2 months.

481
00:33:09,877 --> 00:33:12,743
So, they said I have to repeat fourth grade.

482
00:33:12,743 --> 00:33:13,877
Really?

483
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:17,377
Then, I'll teach you your homework.

484
00:33:17,877 --> 00:33:20,043
You're going to teach him?

485
00:33:20,043 --> 00:33:21,877
Do you think that makes sense?

486
00:33:21,877 --> 00:33:24,310
He's an elementary school student.

487
00:33:24,743 --> 00:33:25,910
So rash.

488
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,543
Dummy how can you?

489
00:33:27,543 --> 00:33:30,277
I can at least teach him the multiplication table.

490
00:33:30,277 --> 00:33:34,043
I finished the multiplication table in 2nd grade though.

491
00:33:34,043 --> 00:33:35,543
Really?

492
00:33:35,543 --> 00:33:37,743
It's going to be more harmful than anything.

493
00:33:37,743 --> 00:33:39,743
Let's just eat the cake.

494
00:34:00,643 --> 00:34:03,843
Chef! Are you worried about something??

495
00:34:03,843 --> 00:34:04,443
Oh!

496
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:07,343
Your face has a look of concern.

497
00:34:07,343 --> 00:34:09,843
Oh, are you finished?

498
00:34:09,843 --> 00:34:12,177
Yes, of course! I cleaned everything.

499
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:14,043
Good job.

500
00:34:15,843 --> 00:34:20,010
Perhaps, did something happen to Ha Ni?

501
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:21,377
Huh?

502
00:34:21,377 --> 00:34:23,810
Why would something happen to Ha Ni?

503
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:25,843
You can go home now.

504
00:34:25,843 --> 00:34:27,610
Yes, Chef. I'll be leaving.

505
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,077
Okay. Good work today.

506
00:34:30,077 --> 00:34:31,443
- Get home safely.
- Yes!

507
00:34:42,843 --> 00:34:45,420
Here we go No Ri, let's check your temperature.

508
00:34:57,686 --> 00:34:59,586
No Ri gets fevers very often.

509
00:34:59,586 --> 00:35:02,853
He's also a patient that was in ICU for over 6 months.

510
00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:05,753
So, you should have been more careful around him.

511
00:35:05,753 --> 00:35:08,020
If you play around with a sick kid like this, what would happen?

512
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,153
I'm sorry.

513
00:35:09,153 --> 00:35:10,960
Please be cautious.

514
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,053
I'm sorry, No Ri.

515
00:35:15,053 --> 00:35:18,320
This is nothing. I'm already used to it.

516
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:23,313
After Eun Jo got admitted, everyday is fun.

517
00:35:23,313 --> 00:35:25,586
I can learn from Seung Jo hyung.

518
00:35:25,586 --> 00:35:28,386
And I have laughed a lot because of Ha Ni noona.

519
00:35:28,386 --> 00:35:31,486
I wasn't intending to be funny though...

520
00:35:32,086 --> 00:35:35,020
Okay, let's just rest for today.

521
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:38,020
When your fever goes down, I'll teach you again.

522
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,486
Yes.

523
00:35:53,053 --> 00:35:55,986
What is his sickness?

524
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,786
It seems like he has a problem with his heart.

525
00:35:58,786 --> 00:36:00,820
Oh, I see.

526
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:10,220
That little kid has to get shots, take tests, and eat bitter medicine everyday.

527
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:13,586
He can't even do everything he wants to do.

528
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,220
There's no use in your crying.

529
00:36:17,986 --> 00:36:18,986
That's right.

530
00:36:20,086 --> 00:36:23,620
If it was you, you could have done something to help him.

531
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,757
What can I do?

532
00:36:24,757 --> 00:36:26,793
You're a genius.

533
00:36:26,793 --> 00:36:31,320
So if you put your mind into being a doctor, you can easily do it.

534
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:38,753
So, it would be great if you could be a doctor, so you could heal many people like No Ri.

535
00:36:38,753 --> 00:36:41,486
Everyone would be grateful towards you.

536
00:36:41,486 --> 00:36:45,620
How does it sound?

537
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,986
If you tell me to become a doctor, does that mean I have to become a doctor?

538
00:36:48,986 --> 00:36:53,386
Yeah, please do it. It's a really good idea right?

539
00:36:53,386 --> 00:36:55,020
Well...

540
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,186
Being a doctor is best for you.

541
00:36:59,186 --> 00:37:02,686
Baek Seung Jo wearing an all white lab coat...

542
00:37:04,086 --> 00:37:07,020
I want to see you like that.

543
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,020
You're incorrigible . . .

544
00:37:12,786 --> 00:37:16,886
You go to the hospital everyday?

545
00:37:16,886 --> 00:37:19,753
So, everyday you're with Baek Seung Jo?

546
00:37:19,753 --> 00:37:25,353
Because Mother leaves during the day, it's just us two.

547
00:37:25,353 --> 00:37:28,120
If only Baek Seung Jo's little brother would be hospitalized a little longer.

548
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,086
Hey, what are you saying...

549
00:37:30,086 --> 00:37:31,720
No? What no

550
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,253
We can see everything, Oh Ha Ni!

551
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:36,086
What are you saying?

552
00:37:44,686 --> 00:37:46,920
You're not allowed to fool around with the wheelchairs!

553
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,620
How do you read this?

554
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,486
How much is it?

555
00:37:49,486 --> 00:37:51,586
Yes, what does it mean?

556
00:37:51,586 --> 00:37:52,920
How much is this?

557
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,520
Correct.

558
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,453
Hey guys, let's eat a snack.

559
00:38:02,486 --> 00:38:05,153
Happy Birthday to you!

560
00:38:05,153 --> 00:38:07,320
Happy Birthday!

561
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,453
No Ri, happy birthday!

562
00:38:22,586 --> 00:38:24,920
Eun Jo, congratulations on being discharged.

563
00:38:27,986 --> 00:38:29,586
Thank you.

564
00:38:30,086 --> 00:38:34,686
Seung Jo hyung and Ha Ni noona, thank you for teaching me.

565
00:38:34,686 --> 00:38:38,719
Okay. If there's something you don't know, always call me.

566
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:39,920
You know my phone number, right?

567
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,486
Yes, I will.

568
00:38:45,853 --> 00:38:49,586
No Ri, get healed quickly.

569
00:38:49,586 --> 00:38:52,953
Yes, this kind of disease won't be a problem.

570
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:57,520
No Ri,

571
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,486
Eun Jo, I'm fine.

572
00:38:59,486 --> 00:39:02,420
I'm going to get healed quickly and come over to your house.

573
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,520
I will definitely come over too.

574
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,220
Yes. You must come.

575
00:39:09,753 --> 00:39:13,286
Yes, I will definitely come.

576
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:38,453
No Ri didn't cry...

577
00:39:38,453 --> 00:39:40,403
and he held it in really well.

578
00:39:41,225 --> 00:39:47,887
He's probably had to say goodbye to a friend that's gotten discharged first before. Even though he's sad too.

579
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:49,795
Eun Jo, we're going.

580
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:11,952
Eun Jo! Congratulations on your discharge from the hospital!

581
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:14,882
Ha Ni, you came back well!

582
00:40:19,197 --> 00:40:20,831
Dad, what is all this?

583
00:40:20,831 --> 00:40:23,739
It seemed like I didn't know how you felt...

584
00:40:23,739 --> 00:40:27,190
and that I was being stubborn about doing things my way.

585
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,070
Dad.

586
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:30,287
Up til now, the upstairs room...

587
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,949
was really uncomfortable, wasn't it?

588
00:40:32,949 --> 00:40:39,286
Seeing you cry (laugh?) at the hospital, I thought that you must be a part of this family.

589
00:40:39,286 --> 00:40:42,158
Welcome Ha Ni.

590
00:40:42,158 --> 00:40:42,998
(Seung Jo's) Mother.

591
00:40:42,998 --> 00:40:46,427
Yeah. Welcome back, Ha Ni!

592
00:40:46,427 --> 00:40:48,059
Thank you, Ahjushi.

593
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:48,981
Then what about my room?

594
00:40:48,981 --> 00:40:52,225
Your room is with your brother.

595
00:40:52,225 --> 00:40:55,958
No! I don't want to give up my room again.

596
00:40:55,958 --> 00:40:59,259
You need to say thank you to your noona.

597
00:40:59,259 --> 00:41:02,549
No. I just did what I had to do.

598
00:41:02,549 --> 00:41:05,224
I'm tired. Give us dinner.

599
00:41:15,074 --> 00:41:16,713
You can go up now.

600
00:41:16,713 --> 00:41:17,906
Ha Ni, you finished everything too?

601
00:41:17,906 --> 00:41:19,878
Yes, I'll finish up the rest.

602
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:22,314
Okay, then it's a favor.

603
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:24,172
Good night.

604
00:41:27,805 --> 00:41:29,437
Ha Ni.

605
00:41:29,437 --> 00:41:31,170
Welcome.

606
00:41:36,903 --> 00:41:39,303
Why aren't you sleeping yet?

607
00:41:39,303 --> 00:41:40,983
I want to drink some water.

608
00:41:45,731 --> 00:41:48,603
Eun Jo, you didn't sleep yet.

609
00:41:52,037 --> 00:41:55,892
This time, you helped with a lot of things.

610
00:41:56,837 --> 00:41:58,282
Thank you.

611
00:42:01,794 --> 00:42:03,537
Punk.

612
00:42:03,537 --> 00:42:05,937
He has some cuteness to him.

613
00:42:28,372 --> 00:42:30,170
You were here.

614
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:37,737
I guess I ended up moving back in.

615
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,370
Just don't get in the way.

616
00:42:43,137 --> 00:42:44,337
Okay.

617
00:44:15,845 --> 00:44:16,852
Ah, you came?

618
00:44:16,852 --> 00:44:18,403
Why are you still here and not leaving?

619
00:44:18,403 --> 00:44:20,403
I was going to go after finishing this.

620
00:44:20,403 --> 00:44:22,103
Go upstairs first.

621
00:44:22,103 --> 00:44:24,370
Ha Ni, go up.

622
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,603
Ha Ni, wait.

623
00:44:39,603 --> 00:44:44,003
Today, Bong Joon Gu's first piece of work was a success.

624
00:44:44,003 --> 00:44:45,403
Yeah.

625
00:44:51,637 --> 00:44:54,370
Ha Ni, you haven't eaten dinner yet, have you?

626
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:56,737
I knew it would be like that, so I made these.

627
00:44:56,737 --> 00:44:57,737
Sit down, sit down.

628
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:59,437
Father, sit down please.

629
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:03,037
Here. Look forward to it!

630
00:45:03,037 --> 00:45:05,903
Bong Joon Gu's first piece of work!

631
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:08,170
Bong(?) Dumplings!

632
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:13,803
This is called Bong Dumplings. Inside the dumpling there is another dumpling.

633
00:45:13,803 --> 00:45:17,537
I made it after getting special permission from your father.

634
00:45:17,537 --> 00:45:19,470
I'm not sure if it turned out well.

635
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:21,137
I have one for Father too.

636
00:45:21,137 --> 00:45:24,870
Try it and please critique it.

637
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:28,470
I was waiting so long for you to come home.

638
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:29,637
Yeah.

639
00:45:32,537 --> 00:45:35,137
But, what to do?

640
00:45:35,137 --> 00:45:36,570
I already ate dinner.

641
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:38,470
Really? You already ate?

642
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:40,803
Ah, what a waste.

643
00:45:40,803 --> 00:45:42,437
Dad.

644
00:45:42,437 --> 00:45:43,670
Oh.

645
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:45,070
That...

646
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:48,237
You did quite a good job on the shape.

647
00:45:48,237 --> 00:45:50,070
Does it really look like that?

648
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:52,003
Father, try it once.

649
00:45:52,003 --> 00:45:56,137
This is kind of embarrassing and I'm nervous.

650
00:45:58,837 --> 00:46:00,603
Oh. Joon Gu.

651
00:46:00,603 --> 00:46:03,203
There... um....

652
00:46:03,203 --> 00:46:07,470
We decided to move back into Seung Jo's house.

653
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:13,137
It's a bit uncomfortable here, and kind of hard on my back.

654
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:17,237
And Seung Jo's family wants us too.

655
00:46:17,237 --> 00:46:19,370
We just decided to do it that way.

656
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:20,903
Just know that. Okay?

657
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,470
Ah yes, yes.

658
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:28,103
I feel like I'm getting permission from you.

659
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:32,503
You did well. Good Job.

660
00:46:32,503 --> 00:46:36,003
Ha Ni, it is my first piece of work. So try it at least once.

661
00:46:36,003 --> 00:46:37,270
Eat it, okay?

662
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:38,470
Okay.

663
00:47:12,237 --> 00:47:14,437
I feel sorry towards Joon Gu...

664
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:19,970
but I'm really happy about being able to be next to Seung Jo again.

665
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:23,703
I'm excited but nervous at the same time.

666
00:47:24,737 --> 00:47:27,970
Will I be able to do a good job?

667
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:34,137
Oh. Where did it go?

668
00:47:34,137 --> 00:47:36,803
I know I brought it in.

669
00:47:56,203 --> 00:47:57,970
Is this yours?

670
00:47:57,970 --> 00:47:59,770
Mine.

671
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:00,803
You took it didn't you?

672
00:48:00,803 --> 00:48:02,203
Dummy.

673
00:48:02,203 --> 00:48:04,637
It was on the ground right here.

674
00:48:04,637 --> 00:48:07,103
Who would steal childish panties like those?

675
00:48:07,103 --> 00:48:09,337
I only wear them once in a while.

676
00:48:09,337 --> 00:48:12,803
I usually wear ones that have a lot of lace.

677
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:16,570
You don't have a body that can be considered sexy though.

678
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:18,337
Even the A Cup must be too big...

679
00:48:18,337 --> 00:48:21,537
Did you stop growing after elementary school?

680
00:48:21,537 --> 00:48:22,503
What did you say?

681
00:48:22,503 --> 00:48:23,603
Hey.

682
00:48:23,603 --> 00:48:26,603
Seeing you like that, and not thinking of anything...

683
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:27,870
Isn't that a big problem?

684
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:30,670
Is it that fun to make fun of me?

685
00:48:31,503 --> 00:48:34,770
If you don't like living with me, you can just say it.

686
00:48:35,442 --> 00:48:37,203
You just grumpily keep making fun of people.

687
00:48:37,203 --> 00:48:38,903
I'm grumpy?

688
00:48:39,603 --> 00:48:42,103
Yeah. Why am I doing that?

689
00:48:42,772 --> 00:48:46,837
When I see you I can't help but want to tease you.

690
00:48:47,572 --> 00:48:51,570
But isn't the one with the problem you? You even drop those kinds of things.

691
00:48:57,270 --> 00:49:01,337
It's good that you two have gotten closer...

692
00:49:01,337 --> 00:49:05,203
but before marriage, it's good to be a little more careful.

693
00:49:05,203 --> 00:49:07,437
Since Eun Jo is here too.

694
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,733
When are you going to select your major?

695
00:49:22,733 --> 00:49:24,167
During my second year.

696
00:49:26,446 --> 00:49:29,651
Then, when you decide what major you're going to take...

697
00:49:29,651 --> 00:49:30,572
Will you be able to do it?

698
00:49:30,572 --> 00:49:34,267
If a bunch of people choose the same major,

699
00:49:34,267 --> 00:49:37,933
They decide using grades, and I'll have to compete in that manner...

700
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,033
But it seems that those circumstances are unlikely.

701
00:49:40,033 --> 00:49:41,733
Well, I'm just saying...

702
00:49:41,733 --> 00:49:44,333
It would be nice if you went into business.

703
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:47,000
I'm not interested in that area.

704
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,167
Ah, Why?

705
00:49:48,167 --> 00:49:50,714
Please drop me off right over there.

706
00:50:08,933 --> 00:50:10,700
Are you going into class?

707
00:50:11,648 --> 00:50:12,967
Seung Jo!

708
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,367
Again?

709
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:27,033
Hey, when you think it's going well with him...

710
00:50:27,033 --> 00:50:29,067
Why is he so fickle?!

711
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,000
Is he being mean again?

712
00:50:31,733 --> 00:50:35,567
This time, it feels different from the last, though.

713
00:50:36,988 --> 00:50:38,933
I don't know.

714
00:50:38,933 --> 00:50:42,033
What-
I mean, you said you even kissed.

715
00:50:42,033 --> 00:50:44,333
Like this... you said you hugged too.

716
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:47,800
But, I mean, why in the world is he being like that??

717
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:52,367
I don't know if he's interested in me or not.

718
00:50:52,367 --> 00:50:54,567
It's very frustrating.

719
00:50:54,567 --> 00:50:58,733
Min Ah, don't you have any good ideas?

720
00:50:58,733 --> 00:51:04,133
To find out if he's interested in me or not.

721
00:51:06,733 --> 00:51:12,067
Ah, then should we try the "yawning method?"

722
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:13,733
Yawning method?

723
00:51:13,733 --> 00:51:19,800
So, now the word "concluded" is basically the same as "to finish" something.

724
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:25,067
You start it and it's over, so therefore, it's concluded.

725
00:51:25,067 --> 00:51:28,600
Now, the second sentence we're going to look at

726
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:33,967
Tariffs lowered on industrial goods and services.

727
00:51:33,967 --> 00:51:37,067
In this particular sentence,

728
00:51:37,067 --> 00:51:42,833
Yawning is somewhat contagious. So if you see someone yawn, you find yourself following.

729
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:44,733
Just use that.

730
00:51:46,177 --> 00:51:48,067
You yawn during class.

731
00:51:48,067 --> 00:51:50,567
But if Seung Jo yawns after you,

732
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:54,200
then that means he has glanced over at you.

733
00:51:57,333 --> 00:51:59,800
If he's not interested, why would he look at you?

734
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,900
Yes!!

735
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,667
So, you're going to make effort to get it.

736
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:14,100
They're both advocating a deal, it means they both really want the deal.

737
00:52:17,865 --> 00:52:21,869
Is my lesson really that boring guys?

738
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:24,800
It's ruined.

739
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:45,367
I haven't suffered from anything so far.

740
00:52:45,367 --> 00:52:48,533
I met my parents well (saying) so I've lived comfortably.

741
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:51,467
Yeah, You and Me...

742
00:52:51,467 --> 00:52:54,500
I just lived off my greatness.

743
00:52:55,133 --> 00:52:59,867
Since all the attention that was supposed to be pointed at the world was actually pointed towards me.

744
00:52:59,867 --> 00:53:01,767
What do we do??

745
00:53:01,767 --> 00:53:04,400
It seems we belong together more and more.

746
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:09,800
That's when, Oh Ha Ni came to our house.

747
00:53:10,233 --> 00:53:12,500
Looking at her...

748
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:17,833
I came to realize that maybe the world has different plans for me.

749
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:23,433
And that is right, and maybe I'm wrong.

750
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,233
It was quite surprising

751
00:53:26,233 --> 00:53:31,500
So I should experience the world more...

752
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,700
I think about it often, lately.

753
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:38,600
Anyways, thank you He Ra.

754
00:53:38,899 --> 00:53:42,400
That I could talk to someone about this ...

755
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,933
It's a relief

756
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:04,700
If you can forget me, try forgetting me... if you can forget me... try forgett-

757
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,533
Hey, Ha Ni ah!

758
00:54:08,533 --> 00:54:10,867
It's good that you came. Come over here.

759
00:54:13,967 --> 00:54:17,833
Ha Ni ah, the thing that you were talking about - the 'timing'

760
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:19,167
The timing of the kiss

761
00:54:19,167 --> 00:54:23,267
I keep practicing this at home, but It seems there's a problem.

762
00:54:23,267 --> 00:54:26,000
"If you can forget me, try forgetting me." this is 4.3 seconds...

763
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,933
During that time, what if Hae Ra leaves before then.

764
00:54:27,933 --> 00:54:29,333
You'll have to do it before she leaves.

765
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:30,600
Of course, I have to do it before she leaves.

766
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,933
But you see, that timing doesn't really work out.

767
00:54:32,933 --> 00:54:36,000
Oh, well, what if you were... stand right here for me.

768
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,667
EH?! No, I don't want to

769
00:54:37,667 --> 00:54:39,133
I did it for you that day, what's the need to do it again?

770
00:54:39,133 --> 00:54:40,567
Please, do it for me.

771
00:54:40,567 --> 00:54:42,533
I'll do it instead.

772
00:54:44,433 --> 00:54:47,667
Ok, then you do it. Stand right here.

773
00:54:49,963 --> 00:54:51,600
It worked well for Seung Jo.

774
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:56,867
When I put my hand like this, the head that was facing down, tilt it up .

775
00:54:58,886 --> 00:55:00,933
If you can forget me...

776
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,900
You saw that just now, right? The timing wasn't right

777
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,650
Before the conversation is over, he already came it.

778
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:13,300
It's too long, this 4.3 seconds.

779
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,700
Sunbae, do you want to try it holding a racquet?

780
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:23,367
When you hold a racket, you turn into a completely different person. Confidence, and burning eyes.

781
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:41,133
Hae Ra!

782
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:55,167
Oh my god! You startled me

783
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:57,633
Oh, what do we do

784
00:56:03,367 --> 00:56:06,367
Aigoo, you even fold clothes so well.

785
00:56:06,367 --> 00:56:13,433
Hey, when I did all this housework, it got so tiring, but now that I have you to talk to. It's so fun!

786
00:56:15,267 --> 00:56:19,933
Its really true that a person can't live all by themselves

787
00:56:19,933 --> 00:56:22,333
Yes, it's true.

788
00:56:23,567 --> 00:56:27,200
Oh, Ha Ni! Can you get the laundry from Seung Jo's room?

789
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,500
Tomorrow is Eun Jo's day to take his P.E. outfit.

790
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,633
It seems I have forgotten!

791
00:56:30,633 --> 00:56:33,100
Sure, I'll be right back

792
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,533
You know that closet towards the inside, right?

793
00:56:35,533 --> 00:56:37,033
I know

794
00:56:57,833 --> 00:57:00,100
OH! It's the couples T-shirt!

795
00:57:05,733 --> 00:57:07,633
He still has it.

796
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,700
Room for rent

797
00:57:51,333 --> 00:57:53,467
Part time job?

798
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,800
What are you doing in someone else's room?

799
00:58:01,499 --> 00:58:03,032
You came?

800
00:58:04,933 --> 00:58:07,033
She told me to bring Eun Jo's gym clothes.

801
00:58:07,033 --> 00:58:09,767
Then you should have just gotten it and left. What are you looking through?

802
00:58:09,767 --> 00:58:14,000
Truthfully, I heard something from Kyung Soo Sunbae.

803
00:58:14,667 --> 00:58:18,000
He said that you might even move out of this house.

804
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,467
Cham... anyways, he's a little weird, right?

805
00:58:20,467 --> 00:58:22,033
It's true.

806
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:24,700
Huh?

807
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:27,167
I'm going to leave this house.

808
00:58:27,167 --> 00:58:27,700
Why?

809
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:31,600
What do you mean why? Do I need to get your permission for that too?

810
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,733
That's not it....

811
00:58:34,533 --> 00:58:39,233
Perhaps, is it because I came in? Are you leaving because of me?

812
00:58:39,233 --> 00:58:42,967
Anyways, it has nothing to do with you.

813
00:58:42,967 --> 00:58:45,200
Don't relate everything to yourself.

814
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,100
What do you mean you're leaving this house?

815
00:58:48,867 --> 00:58:52,600
Until now, under your supervision...

816
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,633
I have lived comfortably.

817
00:58:54,633 --> 00:58:58,667
But I think it's now time to think about the path ahead of me.

818
00:58:59,233 --> 00:59:03,444
Just once, living by myself, getting a part time job...

819
00:59:03,444 --> 00:59:09,233
I want to throw myself into an absolutely unprotected world and watch over myself.

820
00:59:09,233 --> 00:59:11,567
What kind of person am I?

821
00:59:12,667 --> 00:59:14,600
What can I do?

822
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,633
Okay.

823
00:59:18,633 --> 00:59:20,767
That's not a bad idea.

824
00:59:20,767 --> 00:59:22,833
Aigoo, but still...

825
00:59:23,633 --> 00:59:26,167
It hasn't been long since Ha Ni has come back.

826
00:59:26,167 --> 00:59:26,933
Hey, Seung Jo.

827
00:59:26,933 --> 00:59:29,667
It has nothing to do with her.

828
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:31,567
It's my life.

829
00:59:34,733 --> 00:59:36,200
Okay.

830
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,933
Go try it out.

831
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:45,833
What should I do?

832
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:49,700
Seung Jo is going to move out of this house.

833
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:53,133
I came back into this house.

834
00:59:53,767 --> 00:59:56,100
But this time, Seung Jo...

835
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,067
is going to leave.

836
01:00:20,733 --> 01:00:24,300
Where is Baek Seung Jo?

837
01:00:24,733 --> 01:00:27,033
If I don't try,

838
01:00:27,033 --> 01:00:29,033
We couldn't even meet like this.

839
01:00:29,033 --> 01:00:30,533
It's Seung Jo.

840
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:35,300
Seung Jo, what are you doing by yourself?

841
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:38,100
In what area are you living right now?

842
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,700
Hey, Baek Seung Jo.

843
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:43,767
Since she doesn't have a chance, tell her to give up.

844
01:00:43,767 --> 01:00:46,667
Tell her like a man.

845
01:00:48,067 --> 01:00:49,533
Seung Jo!

846
01:00:49,533 --> 01:00:50,267
All of a sudden...

847
01:00:50,267 --> 01:00:53,100
It must be lonely living by yourself.

848
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:57,600
Well it doesn't seem all that bad since I'm with Yoon Hae Ra.

849
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,433
What? Roomate?!

850
01:00:59,433 --> 01:01:00,767
Did something happen?

851
01:01:00,767 --> 01:01:04,233
No, I'm fine.
