1
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,403
Oh. We meet again.

2
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,101
Is she your girlfriend?

3
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,905
There's no way.

4
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,741
Of course.

5
00:01:02,142 --> 00:01:04,677
Seung Jo, want to come have some tea at the cafe?

6
00:01:04,677 --> 00:01:07,246
No. I'll go ahead first.

7
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,919
You're home?

8
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:48,989
Hey.

9
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:50,123
What?

10
00:01:51,507 --> 00:01:56,166
That girl I saw in front of the classroom earlier...

11
00:01:56,586 --> 00:01:58,143
Yoon Hae Ra?

12
00:01:58,398 --> 00:02:00,233
Her name is Hae Ra?

13
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:01,444
Is she your senior?

14
00:02:01,444 --> 00:02:02,835
Senior?

15
00:02:03,436 --> 00:02:05,621
Does she look like someone above us?

16
00:02:06,273 --> 00:02:10,544
Then again she is called the Goddess of the freshmen.

17
00:02:10,544 --> 00:02:11,344
Goddess?

18
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:15,182
Wait, she's the same year as us?!

19
00:02:15,182 --> 00:02:18,925
She entered as the second best in Parang University,

20
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:20,822
And you were the top student in the whole school.

21
00:02:22,104 --> 00:02:24,090
Someone so amazing...

22
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,492
Why did she come to our school?

23
00:02:26,353 --> 00:02:28,425
Are you being jealous now?

24
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:32,923
No way! Jealous? Why would I be jealous?

25
00:02:32,923 --> 00:02:35,530
Of course you would be,

26
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,651
After all, we did kiss.

27
00:02:39,131 --> 00:02:40,284
Kiss?

28
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:47,883
Ho! Perhaps, is this going to be the 2nd kiss?

29
00:02:51,118 --> 00:02:53,051
This is just too good to be seen by myself.

30
00:03:10,551 --> 00:03:12,418
I was played again.

31
00:03:14,584 --> 00:03:20,020
To that person, the kiss we had that day meant nothing at all.

32
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:24,384
It was just a prank!

33
00:03:27,336 --> 00:03:28,854
Come join us!

34
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,951
Maybe you should just attack him.

35
00:03:31,951 --> 00:03:33,718
What if he hates her even more.

36
00:03:35,418 --> 00:03:36,851
That's hard.

37
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:38,184
It sure is.

38
00:03:39,784 --> 00:03:42,751
Oh, my! I have to go.

39
00:03:43,052 --> 00:03:44,718
You're not eating with us?

40
00:03:45,063 --> 00:03:48,118
To be honest, I got a job.

41
00:03:48,118 --> 00:03:48,918
A job?

42
00:03:48,918 --> 00:03:51,884
Parang Beauty salon. The one In front of school.

43
00:03:51,884 --> 00:03:54,151
Really?! That's great!

44
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,251
That's great.

45
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:58,118
I don't really know if it's really great or not.

46
00:03:58,384 --> 00:04:02,651
They said I have to crawl up, but I'm trying it out.

47
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:10,084
So it seems it will be hard for me to keep having lunch with you guys.
I've got to eat up lunch when there aren't any customers around.

48
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:11,851
You should come over too when you have time.

49
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:12,851
Yeah.

50
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:14,718
Then, I'll go off first.

51
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:16,951
I'm going. Bye.

52
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:18,318
Have fun!

53
00:04:18,318 --> 00:04:19,651
Fighting!

54
00:04:22,551 --> 00:04:24,551
I can't have lunch with you either.

55
00:04:25,101 --> 00:04:25,884
Why?

56
00:04:25,884 --> 00:04:29,951
The seniors from our major invited the freshmen to lunch.

57
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:32,751
Then do I have to eat alone?

58
00:04:32,751 --> 00:04:34,055
Sorry.

59
00:04:37,192 --> 00:04:41,418
Oh. I'm coming now.
Yeah.

60
00:04:45,383 --> 00:04:49,583
What's up with this?! I hate eating alone!

61
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:52,849
Ah.

62
00:04:55,616 --> 00:04:59,616
Wang Donkas, Chicken Cutlets, Hamburger steak...

63
00:04:59,616 --> 00:05:01,683
You can't think if you don't say it out loud?

64
00:05:02,807 --> 00:05:03,989
You came?

65
00:05:05,483 --> 00:05:10,016
Even if you didn't, I was about to ask you if you wanted to have lunch together.

66
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,616
What are you going to eat?
Donkas?

67
00:05:13,716 --> 00:05:15,350
Hamburger steak please.

68
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:19,216
Me too.

69
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:22,650
Can I get a lot of vegetables?

70
00:05:23,147 --> 00:05:24,250
Me too.

71
00:05:35,283 --> 00:05:38,016
Excuse me! Hasn't there been a mistake?

72
00:05:38,016 --> 00:05:41,183
Yes?? What is the problem??

73
00:05:41,983 --> 00:05:47,550
Hey, Mr. Prodigy, you sure are brave in going against my fair distribution of foods.

74
00:05:47,883 --> 00:05:48,950
Bong Joon Gu?

75
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:52,216
Ha Ni! It's been a long time, right?

76
00:05:52,216 --> 00:05:54,183
You, why are you here?

77
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,350
Weren't you working at my father's restaurant?

78
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,496
That's right. I work there in the evening, and here during the day.

79
00:06:01,496 --> 00:06:06,116
I'm earning this much money, so you can come marry me any time you want!

80
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,816
I've prepared everything.

81
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:15,650
Knowing you're going to the same school as this jerk, you thought I would do nothing about it?

82
00:06:16,016 --> 00:06:19,883
So Baek Seung Jo, how is it?

83
00:06:19,883 --> 00:06:21,650
You were really surprised, right?

84
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,150
Right. I was REALLY surprised!

85
00:06:24,883 --> 00:06:28,308
How could you allow yourself to trail alongside the skirt of some girl?

86
00:06:28,308 --> 00:06:30,250
The skirt of some girl?

87
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:34,083
That's called love, love.

88
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,283
You don't know what love is?

89
00:06:35,283 --> 00:06:37,350
Hey!

90
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,050
Excuse me, please remake this.

91
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,650
Oh my, how come you only gave him half a serving?

92
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,783
Youngster Bong, is this how you're going to do your job?

93
00:06:45,783 --> 00:06:49,950
Lady, this is more than enough for this fool!

94
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,150
Eat well.

95
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,316
Eat up Ha Ni!

96
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,550
This seat is empty ...

97
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,683
Hi!

98
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,550
Ha Ni.

99
00:07:26,883 --> 00:07:27,816
uhm... you go first

100
00:07:37,616 --> 00:07:38,516
Omg, I finally found you all my life, I was waiting.

101
00:07:38,516 --> 00:07:40,350
I've been looking forever!

102
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:43,150
Oh Sunbae, long time no see.

103
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,783
"Long time no see"?

104
00:07:45,283 --> 00:07:49,016
Since you're the new student here, shouldn't you have been the one to look for me?

105
00:07:49,016 --> 00:07:50,050
That saddens me.

106
00:07:50,183 --> 00:07:50,950
Is that so?

107
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,950
"Is that so?" Look at this kid acting so gentle!

108
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:59,783
Well then, I'll get straight to the point.
Have you joined any school club?

109
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:00,716
School club?

110
00:08:00,716 --> 00:08:01,816
I haven't thought of that.

111
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:07,216
You can't just enter a club without thinking.
Just forget about that, and come join our club.

112
00:08:07,216 --> 00:08:10,750
If you're with us , we can go to Nationals this time.

113
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,150
Nationals?

114
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,416
I don't want to, and it's been a long time since I last played.

115
00:08:15,183 --> 00:08:16,350
Yeah.

116
00:08:16,783 --> 00:08:24,083
Seung Jo, who was the person that got you the "Red Shoes" series when you were a sophomore?

117
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:31,716
-Don't remember? Then when you were a junior, who downloaded those really hot--
-Alright, alright.

118
00:08:31,816 --> 00:08:34,516
You're saying okay? You're okay with it?

119
00:08:34,516 --> 00:08:36,883
Thank you Seung Jo. You are such a nice boy.

120
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:40,416
After your classes are over, come find me in the club room, okay?

121
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,362
Yes.

122
00:08:41,716 --> 00:08:45,083
Alright, then you better come later! I'll see you later, alright?!

123
00:08:48,516 --> 00:08:49,916
School club?

124
00:08:55,216 --> 00:08:56,350
Hi.

125
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,750
You don't have class?

126
00:08:58,716 --> 00:09:00,550
You sure are following me all around.

127
00:09:02,016 --> 00:09:05,583
What kind of club is it?

128
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:07,783
I won't tell you.

129
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,650
Why?

130
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,583
You're going to follow me if I do.

131
00:09:15,016 --> 00:09:17,883
Follow you? Who said I would follow you?

132
00:10:08,572 --> 00:10:10,308
[Super strength/power Club]

133
00:10:26,224 --> 00:10:28,158
Would you like something?

134
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:33,464
Hi!
Hello~!

135
00:10:33,464 --> 00:10:36,600
-So everyone is here.
-This is the list of members.

136
00:10:37,435 --> 00:10:38,669
Why isn't she coming?

137
00:10:38,881 --> 00:10:40,304
Come.

138
00:10:56,921 --> 00:10:58,555
So you followed me.

139
00:10:59,423 --> 00:11:01,225
What are you doing?! Come here.

140
00:11:14,705 --> 00:11:16,640
Omo, we meet again.

141
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:20,978
What is this? If I didn't follow then there would be trouble.

142
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:22,446
You play Tennis well?

143
00:11:22,446 --> 00:11:24,081
I can't play it.

144
00:11:24,882 --> 00:11:27,284
Of course I don't since I've never tried it before.

145
00:11:27,284 --> 00:11:29,133
You shouldn't have come if you've never played.

146
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:31,788
You obviously think lightly of clubs.

147
00:11:31,788 --> 00:11:36,227
What do you mean? That person said that I can join even if I can't play.

148
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:39,196
He said I just have to want to play and be sincere about it.

149
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:41,031
That person?

150
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:44,295
Let her be. She's normally pretty mindless.

151
00:11:44,395 --> 00:11:45,102
OK.

152
00:11:46,404 --> 00:11:47,872
It seems like it.

153
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,041
Alright now. Attention, attention.

154
00:11:52,076 --> 00:11:53,978
Let us begin.

155
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:57,615
Today it seems to be a little awkward Since you still don't know each other,

156
00:11:57,615 --> 00:12:02,286
I'm just going to do a brief intro, and we will begin our official training starting Thursday.

157
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:05,156
So you should bring along your rackets.

158
00:12:05,156 --> 00:12:09,560
Pleased to meet you.
I am the club vice-president, Wang Kyung Soo.

159
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,495
Second year student.

160
00:12:12,597 --> 00:12:13,431
Second year?

161
00:12:13,431 --> 00:12:14,431
Yeah.

162
00:12:14,431 --> 00:12:16,066
21 years old.

163
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:18,602
21 years old?!

164
00:12:23,012 --> 00:12:25,843
I apologize.
No. It's fine, it's fine.

165
00:12:25,843 --> 00:12:31,181
Sometimes, even my mother talks to me formally,

166
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:37,855
Well it's good, since our beginning is light hearted and fun like this.

167
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:41,325
Then I will continue to get into the details.

168
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:51,468
This year our Top Spin club has been blessed with the entry of some very talented freshmen.

169
00:12:53,904 --> 00:12:57,474
The winner of last year's high school tennis nationals.

170
00:12:57,742 --> 00:13:03,547
First place, first place.
Right, Baek Seung jo.

171
00:13:10,288 --> 00:13:14,291
Also, she was in the same tournament,

172
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:20,097
I present to you the girl's division winner. Yoon Hae Ra.

173
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:24,868
Nice to meet you all.

174
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,540
Ah!

175
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:38,782
I don't really know why, but as of last year, no new female students have joined our club.

176
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:47,157
However, a female student who cares greatly about our club and
genuinely wants to join came today. Her name is...

177
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,794
Her nam...

178
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:50,995
It's Oh Ha Ni.

179
00:13:51,796 --> 00:13:53,297
Oh Ha Ni.

180
00:13:54,498 --> 00:13:58,335
Hello everyone. I am Oh Ha Ni from the social studies department.

181
00:13:58,435 --> 00:14:02,106
Excuse me, but how long have you been playing Tennis?

182
00:14:04,341 --> 00:14:06,977
I have never held a racket.

183
00:14:08,872 --> 00:14:10,748
But I've played badminton!

184
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:13,250
Ah! Applause, applause.

185
00:14:39,882 --> 00:14:41,116
Are you okay?

186
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,518
Yeah I'm okay.

187
00:14:42,518 --> 00:14:46,522
Yah, that was pretty powerful. You just need a little more practice and you'll be fine.

188
00:14:46,522 --> 00:14:49,424
I'm sorry.
I said it was okay, so keep playing.

189
00:14:50,225 --> 00:14:53,229
Oh, Pretty! You look pretty.

190
00:14:53,229 --> 00:14:53,863
For real?

191
00:14:53,863 --> 00:14:55,065
Yeah, really pretty.

192
00:14:55,065 --> 00:14:56,101
It's perfect! It's really pretty.

193
00:14:56,101 --> 00:14:58,503
Oh you bought brand new clothes from head to toe.

194
00:15:04,277 --> 00:15:07,546
Well, I have to go get ready...

195
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:14,056
"This is the first time in my life that I am playing tennis ," So you appear.

196
00:15:14,056 --> 00:15:18,560
It's normally the kids that can't study that buy pencils before they even take an exam.

197
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,563
Right! And all different kinds.

198
00:15:21,563 --> 00:15:25,933
By the way, you look to be getting along well with Kyung Soo Sunbae.

199
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:28,136
Yeah, I like Wang Sunbae.

200
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,105
He's exactly like Tofu.

201
00:15:30,372 --> 00:15:31,173
Tofu?

202
00:15:31,173 --> 00:15:32,286
Yeah.

203
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:37,512
He's smooth, and very kind. His words are very nice too.

204
00:15:38,547 --> 00:15:40,716
Very different from a certain someone.

205
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,453
You're really clueless.

206
00:15:46,622 --> 00:15:47,456
Let's go.

207
00:15:55,564 --> 00:15:56,798
Okay, now.

208
00:15:56,798 --> 00:15:57,699
Kyung Soo.

209
00:15:59,935 --> 00:16:07,643
Since it's your first day, we're going to have an ability test.
Go to the back and stay the way you
are right now, and just get the balls.

210
00:16:07,643 --> 00:16:10,679
Kyung Soo will be serving the balls.

211
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:14,416
Please don't feel burdened.

212
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:23,525
Today we will be testing to see what skill level everyone is. Don't be nervous. I'm going to serve 5 balls.

213
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:28,630
Don't force yourselves, and only do what you can.
Don't over do it, or else, you can get hurt.

214
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,099
You play even when it's raining?

215
00:16:30,099 --> 00:16:33,202
Of course, whether it's raining or snowing, we play.

216
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:36,038
So get ready everyone. We're going to start.

217
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:52,095
HEY!

218
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:57,233
Hurry up and move it!

219
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:04,841
Those pieces of junk!

220
00:17:04,841 --> 00:17:06,909
Electronics major, Han Ha Shik.

221
00:17:08,077 --> 00:17:10,012
Fighting! Fighting!

222
00:17:25,928 --> 00:17:27,463
Oh, startled me!

223
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:34,770
What the hell are you doing?! Hit the ball! The ball, damn it! Again.

224
00:17:39,713 --> 00:17:40,881
What are you doing, punk?

225
00:17:41,015 --> 00:17:41,982
Here!

226
00:17:41,983 --> 00:17:43,417
At least get one you punks!

227
00:17:43,485 --> 00:17:44,520
I told you to Get it!

228
00:17:47,522 --> 00:17:48,223
Next.

229
00:17:48,836 --> 00:17:51,004
Undecided major, Yoon Hae Ra.

230
00:18:04,557 --> 00:18:07,059
Sunbae, what are you doing?

231
00:18:07,392 --> 00:18:09,127
Serve the ball correctly.

232
00:18:29,882 --> 00:18:30,882
Next.

233
00:18:32,051 --> 00:18:33,685
Undecided major, Baek Seung Jo.

234
00:18:37,518 --> 00:18:41,018
Oh! Baek Seung Jo, nice to meet you.

235
00:18:41,018 --> 00:18:44,118
I've been waiting for the day to go 1 on 1 with you, like this.

236
00:18:44,118 --> 00:18:45,927
Please take care of me.

237
00:19:01,551 --> 00:19:06,396
Hey, I've been going easy since you said you haven't played for awhile, but I don't think I need to.

238
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,118
No, please go easy on me.

239
00:19:08,118 --> 00:19:10,551
That was just a coincidence.

240
00:19:11,837 --> 00:19:13,484
Cocky fool.

241
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:32,184
Okay, that's it.

242
00:19:40,184 --> 00:19:42,412
Good job.

243
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,300
This isn't good, Wang Sunbae is totally pissed.

244
00:19:51,372 --> 00:19:54,351
I know, the next person is dead now.

245
00:19:54,351 --> 00:19:57,651
Last one, Oh Ha Ni.

246
00:19:59,884 --> 00:20:01,196
Oh Ha Ni!

247
00:20:01,196 --> 00:20:02,784
Where are you hiding? Come here.

248
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,384
Come here!

249
00:20:04,651 --> 00:20:07,784
Go on over, he's calling you.

250
00:20:07,784 --> 00:20:08,637
It's all your fault!

251
00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:10,851
Come here quickly!

252
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,000
Excuse me...

253
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:21,351
Stand up straight!

254
00:20:21,351 --> 00:20:24,684
I'm sorry, but this is the first time I'm playing in my entire life!

255
00:20:24,684 --> 00:20:25,751
Please be gentle...

256
00:20:25,751 --> 00:20:27,361
Shut up!

257
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:29,718
What's up with all the talk!

258
00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:37,584
Are you playing dodgeball?

259
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:39,598
Why are you avoiding the balls!

260
00:20:39,598 --> 00:20:41,884
Don't you dare avoid the balls again.

261
00:20:41,884 --> 00:20:44,151
Don't you dare!

262
00:20:55,384 --> 00:20:57,972
-Hey! Hey! Ha Ni!
-Are you alright?

263
00:20:57,972 --> 00:20:59,105
-I think she fainted!
-Ha Ni get up!

264
00:20:59,105 --> 00:21:01,105
She's got a bloody nose! It's a bloody nose!

265
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:04,505
That's right, this is what it's about!

266
00:21:04,505 --> 00:21:08,605
This is the kind of will power I'm talking about! The need to hit the ball even if it means to faint!

267
00:21:08,605 --> 00:21:09,972
That's right Oh Ha Ni!

268
00:21:09,972 --> 00:21:11,838
Cheers!

269
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:13,238
Cheers!

270
00:21:18,872 --> 00:21:20,405
Are you okay?

271
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:25,138
That fool is typically really well mannered, but once he picks up a racket he turns into a different person.

272
00:21:25,138 --> 00:21:25,905
Really?

273
00:21:25,905 --> 00:21:29,872
Yeah. He feels so bad he's not even able to come over here right now.

274
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:36,748
You two, how the hell do both of you look so good, study so well, and even play tennis that great?

275
00:21:36,748 --> 00:21:38,180
Isn't that just a bit too unfair?

276
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,772
You guys were really popular in high school too, right?

277
00:21:42,994 --> 00:21:44,138
Not really.

278
00:21:44,138 --> 00:21:47,105
Whatever, Hye Ra looks like she dated quite a lot.

279
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:49,938
I wasn't at all interested in dating.

280
00:21:50,238 --> 00:21:51,672
Why?

281
00:21:52,672 --> 00:21:56,472
Other people and I, have a hostile relationship, but I need other people.

282
00:21:56,472 --> 00:22:02,305
Because I want to be acknowledged as independent through the mere independence of the other person.

283
00:22:02,305 --> 00:22:06,072
And in so we begin to begin a process called dating.

284
00:22:06,072 --> 00:22:09,172
And the meaning of independence here?

285
00:22:11,505 --> 00:22:15,705
The ability to transcend all situations with my own will and ambition.

286
00:22:17,172 --> 00:22:20,438
And when we respect the other person's independence...

287
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:22,438
That is Love.

288
00:22:23,538 --> 00:22:25,905
That is what is said.

289
00:22:28,238 --> 00:22:30,472
What? Does it hurt your head?

290
00:22:30,472 --> 00:22:33,072
This is where it get's really important.

291
00:22:33,072 --> 00:22:35,372
Eventually ...

292
00:22:35,372 --> 00:22:40,238
Eventually love is to throw away one's own independence, which becomes the posession of the other person.

293
00:22:40,238 --> 00:22:43,738
The feelings that one feels at that point, is what's called hatred.

294
00:22:44,372 --> 00:22:48,272
Therefore love can only fail.

295
00:22:48,272 --> 00:22:50,372
What the hell is this?

296
00:22:50,838 --> 00:22:51,738
My head hurts!

297
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:53,505
Are you interested in Sartre?

298
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:57,338
Not really Sartre, but I'm more interested in the relationship between Sartre and Beauvoir.

299
00:22:57,338 --> 00:23:00,205
Oh Sartre and Beauvoir.

300
00:23:00,205 --> 00:23:02,538
Even I know who they are.

301
00:23:02,938 --> 00:23:06,805
Oh, now that I think about it, you two are simliar to them.

302
00:23:06,805 --> 00:23:11,605
Didn't those two meet because they both placed 1st and 2nd place for the state exams?

303
00:23:11,605 --> 00:23:13,438
That's right.

304
00:23:28,872 --> 00:23:31,005
Really? That's crazy.

305
00:23:31,005 --> 00:23:33,638
She's totally a girl version of Baek Seung Jo.

306
00:23:33,638 --> 00:23:34,338
Seriously.

307
00:23:34,338 --> 00:23:36,705
You better be on your toes.

308
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:42,872
You followed your significant other to play tennis, which you have no clue about, and came back with a damaged nose.

309
00:23:42,872 --> 00:23:44,205
What about it, Oh Ha Ni?

310
00:23:44,205 --> 00:23:46,105
And here I thought you were on a roll this Spring, but look at you now.

311
00:23:46,105 --> 00:23:50,038
Seriously, you went from winter back to winter.

312
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:53,505
No, there's still hope.

313
00:23:54,638 --> 00:23:55,905
What is it?

314
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,872
You were here.

315
00:24:05,272 --> 00:24:07,972
What a coincidence that we're in the same lecture?

316
00:24:07,972 --> 00:24:10,638
What a relief, because I heard this lecture was hard.

317
00:24:10,638 --> 00:24:11,705
Since you're here.

318
00:24:11,705 --> 00:24:15,872
This is it! Listening to a lecture along with Seung Jo.

319
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,638
I could have never imagined this in high school.

320
00:24:18,638 --> 00:24:22,005
I knew it! Oh Ha Ni's spring has arrived!

321
00:24:22,305 --> 00:24:24,738
The guy sitting behind you came along too?

322
00:24:24,738 --> 00:24:26,105
Huh?

323
00:24:26,472 --> 00:24:28,172
Ha Ni!

324
00:24:28,172 --> 00:24:29,505
What are you doing here?

325
00:24:29,505 --> 00:24:31,705
What is it? Can I not be here?

326
00:24:31,705 --> 00:24:34,072
I just really miss the old days of studying!

327
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:36,638
Did you like to study so much that you miss it?

328
00:24:36,638 --> 00:24:41,238
Fool, it's because of you that I got out of the cafeteria during it's busiest hours!

329
00:24:41,238 --> 00:24:43,638
Was the cafeteria that slow?

330
00:24:43,638 --> 00:24:46,705
Of course I feel bad towards the cafeteria lady.

331
00:24:46,705 --> 00:24:49,038
But it can't be helped!

332
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:50,772
Is that seat taken?

333
00:24:54,138 --> 00:24:57,305
What a real coincidence? We're sitting in another lecture together.

334
00:25:04,172 --> 00:25:08,005
What do you usually eat for breakfast?

335
00:25:09,238 --> 00:25:11,505
I really don't know.

336
00:25:11,972 --> 00:25:14,105
Ha Ni!
Ha Ni!

337
00:25:14,105 --> 00:25:15,805
Do you understand?

338
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,572
Joon Gu, shhh!

339
00:25:17,572 --> 00:25:19,705
Pardon me.

340
00:25:20,172 --> 00:25:20,808
Oh.

341
00:25:20,808 --> 00:25:22,605
Why do you have a bandaid on?

342
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:23,572
Did you hurt yourself?

343
00:25:23,572 --> 00:25:24,938
Huh?

344
00:25:24,938 --> 00:25:26,405
Me?

345
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:33,063
What did he say?

346
00:25:38,296 --> 00:25:40,027
I am sorry.

347
00:25:41,263 --> 00:25:43,263
I'm be quiet!

348
00:25:43,263 --> 00:25:45,100
Oh, shut the mouth!

349
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,563
Shut the mouth?

350
00:25:48,763 --> 00:25:50,896
What, why are you guys laughing!? She's doing good!

351
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:53,329
And... who are you?

352
00:25:55,896 --> 00:25:57,096
Me?

353
00:25:57,096 --> 00:25:58,564
Me?

354
00:25:58,564 --> 00:26:04,296
You don't have any books. Did you originally take this class or...?

355
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,617
Oh. What? Huh?

356
00:26:09,996 --> 00:26:11,427
Hey man!

357
00:26:12,163 --> 00:26:14,029
I'm sorry.

358
00:26:14,463 --> 00:26:16,163
But I am coding!

359
00:26:16,163 --> 00:26:18,029
Yes I'm coding!

360
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:19,396
Coding?

361
00:26:19,396 --> 00:26:21,463
What does that mean?

362
00:26:22,063 --> 00:26:23,696
Are you trying to say you're a high school student?

363
00:26:23,696 --> 00:26:26,829
Not that, but that I just have a high school diploma.

364
00:26:26,829 --> 00:26:29,385
That I don't attend this school.

365
00:26:29,385 --> 00:26:32,396
Everyone is sitting here after paying the expensive tuition.

366
00:26:32,396 --> 00:26:35,563
Stop being a nuisance and why don't you just leave now?

367
00:26:35,563 --> 00:26:37,763
What? A nuisance?!

368
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:40,863
If you're stupid, the least you could be is modest.

369
00:26:40,863 --> 00:26:43,729
Gosh, I absolutely hate stupid guys.

370
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:47,096
You're like a bug!

371
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:57,129
You don't have class today?

372
00:27:00,629 --> 00:27:02,829
After going to university...

373
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,196
It really is no joke.

374
00:27:05,196 --> 00:27:07,712
What? Did something happen?

375
00:27:07,712 --> 00:27:10,400
That's not it...

376
00:27:11,056 --> 00:27:13,700
I think there are so many kids that are super smart

377
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,134
and super pretty.

378
00:27:17,675 --> 00:27:22,300
Seung Jo as well, probably likes the pretty,

379
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,767
smart, and skinny ones.

380
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,200
He probably likes girls like that right?

381
00:27:28,467 --> 00:27:29,734
Hey!

382
00:27:29,734 --> 00:27:31,600
Did a girl like that appear before him?!

383
00:27:37,367 --> 00:27:39,467
Hey, Ha Ni.

384
00:27:39,634 --> 00:27:44,300
I may look this young, but I am an adult.

385
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,700
I can tell just looking at you two.

386
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,403
You two can only be perfect when together.

387
00:27:50,403 --> 00:27:51,285
Huh?

388
00:27:51,285 --> 00:27:53,900
You're meant to be.

389
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,067
Like this.

390
00:27:57,767 --> 00:28:00,734
I don't know how great that girl may be,

391
00:28:00,734 --> 00:28:03,466
but it can't be helped if she's not his other half.

392
00:28:03,466 --> 00:28:04,967
See?

393
00:28:05,634 --> 00:28:08,800
See, it can't be helped if it doesn't fit.

394
00:28:10,334 --> 00:28:14,600
So don't you worry. Alright?

395
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,434
Yes.

396
00:28:15,434 --> 00:28:18,234
That's right.

397
00:28:18,234 --> 00:28:21,678
Now stop wiping that, you're going to put a hole in it!

398
00:28:28,162 --> 00:28:29,198
Oh. Baek Eun Jo.

399
00:28:29,198 --> 00:28:31,367
What is it?

400
00:28:31,767 --> 00:28:33,834
Your caligraphy supplies?

401
00:28:33,834 --> 00:28:36,934
Yeah. The ink stone...

402
00:28:36,934 --> 00:28:37,867
And rice paper?

403
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,567
What are you looking at that you don't even hear me when I call?

404
00:28:47,991 --> 00:28:49,691
Oh. What is it, Oh Ha Ni?

405
00:28:50,591 --> 00:28:52,291
Why did you come to someone else's school?

406
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:53,791
Uhjjoo (Look at you)!

407
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:55,124
I brought your materials...

408
00:28:55,124 --> 00:28:57,158
I'm going to take it back.

409
00:28:57,158 --> 00:28:58,624
Ah give it to me.

410
00:28:58,624 --> 00:29:01,058
What are you watching?

411
00:29:07,391 --> 00:29:08,958
I got it.

412
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:10,491
It's her.

413
00:29:10,491 --> 00:29:11,858
Am I right?

414
00:29:11,858 --> 00:29:15,291
Ohh. She's pretty.

415
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:18,124
Actually, they're all prettier than you.

416
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:19,858
This...

417
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,658
Here.

418
00:29:28,658 --> 00:29:30,491
Thank you!

419
00:30:18,124 --> 00:30:19,691
I don't want to do this anymore.

420
00:30:19,691 --> 00:30:20,858
Ah. Is that so?

421
00:30:20,858 --> 00:30:23,424
Then, eat this

422
00:30:23,424 --> 00:30:25,258
I'll get fat!

423
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:28,324
Where do you have fat?

424
00:30:28,324 --> 00:30:30,391
Then do you want to play Omok (Korean game)?

425
00:30:31,024 --> 00:30:32,924
Boring...

426
00:30:36,324 --> 00:30:40,624
Ah, he has to make her have fun.

427
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,858
I want to leave.

428
00:30:45,758 --> 00:30:49,391
My mom's making some food.

429
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:55,424
Hyung!

430
00:30:56,591 --> 00:30:58,291
Is this your friend?

431
00:30:58,291 --> 00:30:59,924
Yes.

432
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:03,324
Oh, you did a good job making this.

433
00:31:03,324 --> 00:31:05,558
Eun Jo's pretty smart.

434
00:31:06,024 --> 00:31:07,724
This

435
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:13,191
Like this.

436
00:31:14,424 --> 00:31:15,991
Wow.

437
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:20,224
Could I stay for dinner?

438
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:31,324
Sarah, should I give you more?

439
00:31:31,324 --> 00:31:33,258
No thank you. I ate well.

440
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:36,824
Aigoo, so clever.

441
00:31:40,224 --> 00:31:41,491
Seung Jo, oppa!

442
00:31:41,491 --> 00:31:42,024
Huh?

443
00:31:42,024 --> 00:31:46,024
Oppa, do you believe in love at first sight?

444
00:31:46,258 --> 00:31:48,758
Hmm, I'm not sure. I never thought about it.

445
00:31:48,758 --> 00:31:50,991
I used to not believe it.

446
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:54,124
I thought adults were just saying things,

447
00:31:54,124 --> 00:31:56,824
but i think it's real.

448
00:31:58,324 --> 00:32:01,324
Earlier, when you came into the room,

449
00:32:01,324 --> 00:32:05,591
the background behind Oppa really became white and

450
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:08,458
I couldn't see anyone but oppa.

451
00:32:13,324 --> 00:32:17,124
Oppa, just wait 7 years.

452
00:32:27,624 --> 00:32:31,791
Eun Jo, you... since Sarah likes your hyung

453
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:34,824
are you here because you're sad?

454
00:32:34,991 --> 00:32:39,291
Our Eun Jo is so cool though,right?

455
00:32:41,391 --> 00:32:42,858
Eun Jo ahh.

456
00:32:42,858 --> 00:32:44,724
I don't know.

457
00:32:44,724 --> 00:32:51,424
Aigoo what's wrong? Eun Jo, you're cool too!

458
00:33:29,124 --> 00:33:32,058
Ah. Where's Eun Jo?

459
00:33:32,058 --> 00:33:33,958
Are you even worried?

460
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:36,558
What? Why are you being like that to me?

461
00:33:37,158 --> 00:33:38,258
Cheater (relationship-wise).

462
00:33:38,258 --> 00:33:38,891
What?

463
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:43,658
You act like you're not, while you're managing(?) it. I see it all.

464
00:33:43,658 --> 00:33:45,091
Manage?

465
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:47,758
Yeah. Manage.

466
00:33:49,391 --> 00:33:53,624
Whenever I want to throw away my feelings because I think it just must not be,

467
00:33:53,624 --> 00:33:56,491
you laugh for me once in awhile.

468
00:33:56,758 --> 00:33:59,224
Whether it's real or you're playing around,

469
00:33:59,224 --> 00:34:01,858
you make people confused and make them dumb.

470
00:34:01,858 --> 00:34:04,524
What are you talking about?

471
00:34:05,124 --> 00:34:08,658
You're right. You did well.

472
00:34:08,658 --> 00:34:11,291
You two look good together. Mean.

473
00:34:11,291 --> 00:34:14,758
Hey, are you talking about Yoon Hae Ra right now?

474
00:34:14,758 --> 00:34:16,458
Not talking about Eun Jo?

475
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:21,024
Ah, it's the same thing.

476
00:34:24,591 --> 00:34:26,324
How did it go?

477
00:34:43,591 --> 00:34:44,891
Go away, Oh Ha Ni!

478
00:34:44,891 --> 00:34:47,824
I don't want to see you! It's all your fault!

479
00:34:47,824 --> 00:34:49,458
Just go!

480
00:34:50,158 --> 00:34:51,991
I'm sorry.

481
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:55,124
You brought her here and it ended up like this.

482
00:34:55,124 --> 00:34:56,791
Did I ask you for that favor?

483
00:34:56,791 --> 00:35:00,524
You're right. I went overboard again.

484
00:35:00,524 --> 00:35:02,891
Well, that's just like me.

485
00:35:05,158 --> 00:35:07,424
I'm really sorry.

486
00:35:07,424 --> 00:35:09,858
I know that I can't say anything to make you feel better...

487
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,024
What do you know?

488
00:35:11,224 --> 00:35:13,224
What do you know?

489
00:35:19,124 --> 00:35:20,991
I know.

490
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:24,358
In this world, I probably know it the best.

491
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:33,758
The person I like doesn't look at me but looks at someone else. Smiles/laughs for someone else.

492
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:38,091
I really know what that feels like.

493
00:35:38,091 --> 00:35:40,891
And I can't be truthfully jealous either.

494
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:42,691
Are you talking about my brother?

495
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:49,158
Eun Jo.

496
00:35:49,158 --> 00:35:54,724
I think... if two people mutually like each other...

497
00:35:54,724 --> 00:35:57,024
It's almost a miracle.

498
00:35:58,391 --> 00:36:03,224
Someday, will that miracle come true for me too?

499
00:36:03,558 --> 00:36:05,458
I don't know.

500
00:36:08,591 --> 00:36:10,424
Don't do that.

501
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:12,958
Stop it.

502
00:36:30,924 --> 00:36:35,258
Should I get another house?

503
00:36:39,791 --> 00:36:42,424
Chef. Chef. Take a look at this.

504
00:36:42,791 --> 00:36:44,124
Okay.

505
00:36:45,924 --> 00:36:49,558
Hey hey, why is this so watery?

506
00:36:49,558 --> 00:36:53,358
When you made the dough...
Did you mix in one direction?

507
00:36:54,124 --> 00:36:56,824
Ah that's right. I did it that way.

508
00:36:56,824 --> 00:36:58,358
Aigoo.

509
00:36:58,724 --> 00:36:59,891
Oh?

510
00:37:01,158 --> 00:37:03,591
The seasoning is good.

511
00:37:03,591 --> 00:37:06,658
Yes. But it's really interesting!

512
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:09,758
How can it have that salty taste?

513
00:37:09,758 --> 00:37:13,058
Yet it also tastes sweet!

514
00:37:13,058 --> 00:37:14,591
Ah. That's right.

515
00:37:14,591 --> 00:37:19,091
If you leave it for a couple hours, you don't need to add MSG.

516
00:37:20,024 --> 00:37:23,024
Someone will hear. The way...

517
00:37:23,024 --> 00:37:25,924
Hey, go make the batter again.

518
00:37:25,924 --> 00:37:27,924
Oh, then what should I do with this?

519
00:37:27,924 --> 00:37:31,391
In the refridgerator, there should be batter. Mix this with both halves of that.

520
00:37:31,391 --> 00:37:33,091
Yes. I understand.

521
00:37:35,424 --> 00:37:37,824
Here.

522
00:37:38,524 --> 00:37:41,858
When am I going to make noodles out of this.

523
00:37:41,858 --> 00:37:46,024
i need to hurry up and make a bowl for Ha Ni to eat.

524
00:37:50,324 --> 00:37:51,558
Joon Gu.

525
00:37:51,558 --> 00:37:52,524
Yes. Chef.

526
00:37:52,524 --> 00:37:56,224
What do you like about Ha Ni?

527
00:37:56,658 --> 00:37:59,658
Oh. Chef.

528
00:37:59,658 --> 00:38:04,091
Since you ask me like that, I'm a little embarrassed.

529
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:09,491
If it wasn't for Ha Ni, I wouldn't have been able to graduate.

530
00:38:09,491 --> 00:38:14,491
I used to get in trouble everyday and the kids used to avoid me.

531
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:18,791
Ha Ni became my friend, and I was able to graduate.

532
00:38:18,791 --> 00:38:20,958
Ah. Is that so?

533
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:22,424
Yes. Chef.

534
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:25,724
This is correct, right?

535
00:38:25,724 --> 00:38:27,424
Like this, like this.

536
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:41,119
So it is true that you live under one roof.

537
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:44,710
Hyung.

538
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,824
Oh. Eun Jo.

539
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:51,651
We've got to look for some documents for a joint assignment.

540
00:38:51,651 --> 00:38:55,412
I'm sorry, but do you think you could take your work to the study?

541
00:38:55,412 --> 00:38:56,652
What kind of assignment?

542
00:38:56,652 --> 00:39:03,396
It's a general ed class based on Western studies, but we had to partner up and complete the assignment.

543
00:39:04,168 --> 00:39:05,069
Your brother?

544
00:39:05,069 --> 00:39:07,083
Yes. Eun Jo.

545
00:39:07,801 --> 00:39:09,498
Hello.

546
00:39:12,574 --> 00:39:13,863
Come on.

547
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,593
She's so pretty.

548
00:39:40,851 --> 00:39:44,208
Oh it's nice here!

549
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:46,763
The view is so much better!

550
00:39:56,904 --> 00:40:01,627
I hear Western guys think that when a girl innocently follows them home,

551
00:40:01,627 --> 00:40:06,051
it means that the girl is okay with spending the night with the guy.

552
00:40:07,218 --> 00:40:08,918
What should we do?

553
00:40:08,918 --> 00:40:12,279
Let's each organize the documents and then make a conclusion.

554
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:16,738
Sounds good.

555
00:40:16,738 --> 00:40:20,153
Since we can't look at all of them in this short amount of time.

556
00:40:30,257 --> 00:40:32,676
What's our theme going to be?

557
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:33,984
Well...

558
00:40:34,718 --> 00:40:37,318
The word joy keeps coming to mind.
Hwan Hee = Joy

559
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:38,884
What?!

560
00:40:38,884 --> 00:40:40,884
Did he say Ha Ni?

561
00:40:40,884 --> 00:40:42,318
Joy.

562
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,451
That's a good one!

563
00:40:45,451 --> 00:40:47,518
Overcoming denial and changing into joy!

564
00:40:48,118 --> 00:40:52,118
How about we turn in a video file instead of a report.

565
00:40:52,118 --> 00:40:52,984
A video?

566
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:55,618
Like using clay animation or something.

567
00:40:55,618 --> 00:40:58,818
We can show the process of extinction to formation.

568
00:40:58,818 --> 00:41:03,118
So we'll show the notion of joy via a video file.

569
00:41:03,118 --> 00:41:04,884
You have a camera at home right?

570
00:41:08,384 --> 00:41:09,884
You're home?

571
00:41:10,651 --> 00:41:12,251
I'm going to use the camera.

572
00:41:12,251 --> 00:41:13,118
Camera?!

573
00:41:13,118 --> 00:41:15,551
Hyung is working on an assignment with a friend.

574
00:41:15,551 --> 00:41:16,984
It's a 2 person assignment.

575
00:41:17,623 --> 00:41:18,484
Really?!

576
00:41:18,484 --> 00:41:21,351
But the friend he came with is a girl.

577
00:41:21,351 --> 00:41:23,351
She's so pretty.

578
00:41:23,351 --> 00:41:24,918
What?

579
00:41:24,918 --> 00:41:25,551
A girl?

580
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:26,418
Yes.

581
00:41:26,418 --> 00:41:29,718
The professor assigned the partners, so don't be mistaken.

582
00:41:29,718 --> 00:41:31,551
I'm going to use this. I'll put it back after I'm done.

583
00:41:31,551 --> 00:41:35,118
Eun Jo, I need something from some of your supplies.

584
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,851
I'm going to use it.

585
00:41:46,051 --> 00:41:46,751
Goodnight, Father.

586
00:41:46,751 --> 00:41:49,418
Alright. Don't leave the door open because you have to go somewhere or anything.

587
00:41:49,418 --> 00:41:50,351
Don't worry!

588
00:41:50,351 --> 00:41:52,118
-Goodnight!
-Thank you!

589
00:41:52,118 --> 00:41:53,918
-Thank you for the hard work!
-Good luck!

590
00:42:04,693 --> 00:42:07,484
Others have all gone to university.

591
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:10,918
They're doing well with clubs and listening to lectures.

592
00:42:10,918 --> 00:42:13,018
Bong Joon Gu.

593
00:42:13,018 --> 00:42:14,784
You're so pathetic.

594
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,818
But what can you do.

595
00:42:18,818 --> 00:42:21,840
Hurry and learn the trade and become a top chef,

596
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,918
so you can proudly propose to Ha Ni.

597
00:42:36,784 --> 00:42:40,588
Ha Ni, what are you doing right now?

598
00:42:42,818 --> 00:42:44,851
Should I call her?

599
00:42:44,851 --> 00:42:48,051
I've never called her this late.

600
00:42:50,284 --> 00:42:52,418
Man, now that I'm going to call her, it's a bit nerve wrecking.

601
00:43:00,451 --> 00:43:03,151
Seung Jo can you spread out the petals?

602
00:43:03,151 --> 00:43:04,184
Like this?

603
00:43:04,184 --> 00:43:05,451
Yes

604
00:43:11,318 --> 00:43:13,018
Your mother?

605
00:43:13,018 --> 00:43:14,751
She's my friend.

606
00:43:15,518 --> 00:43:17,551
Hello.

607
00:43:17,551 --> 00:43:20,418
Yes. So you're working on an assignment together?

608
00:43:20,418 --> 00:43:21,918
Yes

609
00:43:21,918 --> 00:43:25,018
We should have asked permission before hand.

610
00:43:25,018 --> 00:43:28,251
Barging in without contacting you...

611
00:43:28,251 --> 00:43:29,551
I'm sorry.

612
00:43:29,551 --> 00:43:31,251
Yes.

613
00:43:32,618 --> 00:43:33,618
Where is Ha Ni?

614
00:43:33,618 --> 00:43:35,384
Probably in her room.

615
00:43:43,051 --> 00:43:44,951
Where did she go?

616
00:43:45,484 --> 00:43:48,184
I heard she came home.

617
00:43:48,818 --> 00:43:52,184
Oh. She left her handphone.

618
00:43:53,584 --> 00:43:56,051
Ha Ni isn't in her room.

619
00:43:56,051 --> 00:43:57,318
Is that so?

620
00:43:57,318 --> 00:43:59,718
She must have gone some where.

621
00:44:08,584 --> 00:44:10,284
Ha Ni.

622
00:44:10,284 --> 00:44:12,984
Ha Ni.

623
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:21,118
Oh, what's this?

624
00:44:23,951 --> 00:44:25,818
Where did this guy come from?

625
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:32,318
It's the first time I've seen him so happy.

626
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:34,718
Is Seung Jo...

627
00:44:34,718 --> 00:44:37,818
Having a taste of joy right now?

628
00:44:39,018 --> 00:44:40,351
It's done.

629
00:44:41,718 --> 00:44:44,151
Do you think you can grab me a glass of water?

630
00:44:44,151 --> 00:44:46,984
Oh then again we haven't had anything to eat this whole time.

631
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:48,451
Hold on a second.

632
00:45:07,418 --> 00:45:10,018
What should I do?

633
00:45:10,018 --> 00:45:11,884
Should I jump down?

634
00:45:11,884 --> 00:45:14,751
If she sees me here,

635
00:45:14,751 --> 00:45:17,118
I'm better off dying!

636
00:45:21,851 --> 00:45:23,418
Yes.

637
00:45:24,118 --> 00:45:26,084
No I'm out.

638
00:45:26,951 --> 00:45:30,084
I'm at a friend's house because of a school assignment.

639
00:45:31,451 --> 00:45:33,351
We're done.

640
00:45:34,084 --> 00:45:36,418
I'll call once I leave.

641
00:46:05,314 --> 00:46:07,968
You should quickly be able to play on the courts.

642
00:46:08,681 --> 00:46:11,358
You can't just shag balls everyday until graduation.

643
00:46:13,705 --> 00:46:15,548
But still, you're trying your best.

644
00:46:15,848 --> 00:46:18,281
Even when Seung Jo is not here, you still come.

645
00:46:18,281 --> 00:46:20,148
Why isn't he coming?

646
00:46:20,148 --> 00:46:22,814
Omo, you didn't know?

647
00:46:23,952 --> 00:46:30,189
Seung Jo is a special member. He joined the club on the condition to come and play whenever he feels like it.

648
00:46:30,881 --> 00:46:34,648
You're living together, but you don't even know about that?

649
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:38,316
Wait a moment.

650
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:44,348
So your relationship is at that level?

651
00:46:46,048 --> 00:46:47,181
Great.

652
00:46:48,048 --> 00:46:52,898
Not getting anxious... is a little boring.

653
00:47:04,248 --> 00:47:06,114
She's so mature.

654
00:47:07,214 --> 00:47:11,219
We're the same age, but why do I seem like a kid?

655
00:47:13,614 --> 00:47:17,548
Baek Seung Jo can come when he feels like it?

656
00:47:19,696 --> 00:47:21,514
Then why did I join here?

657
00:47:22,014 --> 00:47:23,848
Why I am gathering those?

658
00:47:32,081 --> 00:47:33,481
Oh, dad.

659
00:47:36,381 --> 00:47:37,114
What?

660
00:47:39,681 --> 00:47:41,148
It's going to be spicy.

661
00:47:41,148 --> 00:47:42,728
I like it spicy.

662
00:47:46,148 --> 00:47:47,114
Tennis?

663
00:47:48,814 --> 00:47:50,048
Is it fun?

664
00:47:51,514 --> 00:47:53,181
It's hard...

665
00:47:53,848 --> 00:47:54,848
Really?

666
00:47:56,648 --> 00:47:57,914
Why did you call me?

667
00:47:59,256 --> 00:48:01,914
Put a little bit more radish juice in it.

668
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:06,781
I asked you why you called me!

669
00:48:07,514 --> 00:48:08,414
Yeah.

670
00:48:10,781 --> 00:48:12,848
Let's move out.

671
00:48:16,981 --> 00:48:20,814
In the end, we can't just keep living there forever.

672
00:48:21,348 --> 00:48:23,414
But...
However I'm...

673
00:48:24,648 --> 00:48:28,181
usually out here because I'm working, but

674
00:48:28,414 --> 00:48:32,814
It seems like you're having a real hard time so my heart is unsettled.

675
00:48:35,814 --> 00:48:37,814
Let's move out.

676
00:48:38,981 --> 00:48:41,848
I'll take care of a place for us to temporarily reside at.

677
00:48:58,881 --> 00:49:00,848
Ar... Are you alright?

678
00:49:00,848 --> 00:49:01,948
Oh, it's spicy.

679
00:49:03,781 --> 00:49:06,381
I might have put too much horseradish

680
00:49:08,287 --> 00:49:09,948
I'm starting to tear up.

681
00:49:12,548 --> 00:49:15,948
So, why did you put a lot?

682
00:49:23,081 --> 00:49:26,481
I'm against it. Thinking that Ha Ni will be gone!

683
00:49:26,781 --> 00:49:28,748
I don't want to. I'm against this.

684
00:49:28,748 --> 00:49:30,914
Honey, be a little thoughtful.

685
00:49:30,914 --> 00:49:34,048
He's saying that Ha Ni will go away!

686
00:49:34,148 --> 00:49:35,781
Ah... Really.

687
00:49:35,781 --> 00:49:42,414
Ki Dong, you really don't have to be concerned about it.
We really want you to live with us.

688
00:49:42,414 --> 00:49:49,214
It's not like you're just staying here for nothing, you're paying the monthly rent.
Thanks for the offer but we've been here too long.

689
00:49:49,214 --> 00:49:52,281
We've been bothering Seung Jo and Eun Jo.

690
00:49:52,681 --> 00:49:54,448
And our Ha Ni,

691
00:49:55,548 --> 00:49:59,448
Will be able to give up Seung Jo quickly.
About that...

692
00:49:59,448 --> 00:50:00,581
How can I?

693
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:02,181
It's alright, Jae Su-Shi

694
00:50:02,281 --> 00:50:04,014
No, it's not.

695
00:50:04,181 --> 00:50:07,814
Anyhow, this problem should be dealt with by the the 2 who are concerned.

696
00:50:07,814 --> 00:50:14,881
Seung Jo doesn't have any interest in Ha Ni, and...
What should I do?!

697
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:23,348
If Ha Ni marries into our family that won't be a problem anymore right?

698
00:50:23,581 --> 00:50:27,648
Oh, I really love that bright personality

699
00:50:27,648 --> 00:50:31,114
And that cuteness of hers.

700
00:50:31,814 --> 00:50:36,414
Even Seung Jo, will come to like her .

701
00:50:36,414 --> 00:50:41,448
Aigoo! Our Ha...Ha Ni

702
00:50:41,648 --> 00:50:43,514
Is a happy child.

703
00:50:44,214 --> 00:50:46,248
for you adoring her like this.

704
00:50:47,681 --> 00:50:50,314
Stop crying already.

705
00:51:09,548 --> 00:51:10,548
Hyung.

706
00:51:11,514 --> 00:51:13,548
Oh Ha Ni is moving out.

707
00:51:14,814 --> 00:51:17,681
She's moving back with her father to their house.

708
00:51:20,614 --> 00:51:22,148
Isn't that great?

709
00:51:22,514 --> 00:51:27,314
Ever since she moved in, she has only been a pain to you and me.

710
00:51:46,514 --> 00:51:47,914
You're moving out?

711
00:51:48,548 --> 00:51:49,314
Yeah...

712
00:51:51,112 --> 00:51:52,248
Are you disappointed?

713
00:51:52,248 --> 00:51:58,648
Well, it's a relief since my life can finally go back to normal.

714
00:51:58,881 --> 00:52:00,181
Right.

715
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:03,381
Yea...That's what I hope too.

716
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,414
I have to go pack now.

717
00:52:17,114 --> 00:52:18,414
Goodnight.

718
00:55:12,014 --> 00:55:16,314
Ha Ni we have to go now.
They're all waiting downstairs.

719
00:55:23,148 --> 00:55:24,214
Is that all?

720
00:55:28,481 --> 00:55:29,948
Dad...

721
00:55:55,948 --> 00:55:57,114
Jae Su-Shi.

722
00:55:59,014 --> 00:56:00,614
Aigoo

723
00:56:01,514 --> 00:56:03,848
Seung Jo, Eun Jo.

724
00:56:04,714 --> 00:56:10,148
We've brought you much trouble.
Really sorry.

725
00:56:10,914 --> 00:56:11,881
Oh right.

726
00:56:12,914 --> 00:56:15,814
You should come by our house sometimes.

727
00:56:17,148 --> 00:56:19,948
Ha Ni, say goodbye.

728
00:56:22,481 --> 00:56:26,514
For taking care of us, I'm very grateful.

729
00:56:34,414 --> 00:56:37,248
For making delicious meals everyday,

730
00:56:39,614 --> 00:56:48,081
On the day of the sports competition, you brought us Pizza and took pictures with us.
Even taking my friends with me

731
00:56:48,314 --> 00:56:50,548
And even took my friends with us to the beach.

732
00:56:50,848 --> 00:56:52,814
and threw me a congratulation party for passing the exam.

733
00:56:55,081 --> 00:57:01,481
To me everything is a pleasant memory.

734
00:57:03,414 --> 00:57:08,481
Everything that happened when I lived here, really...

735
00:57:11,048 --> 00:57:12,248
Ha Ni...

736
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:18,548
I'm sorry for being a bother to you this far.

737
00:57:27,381 --> 00:57:28,914
Ha Ni...

738
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:32,614
Mother!

739
00:57:35,914 --> 00:57:38,848
My life with you....

740
00:57:45,414 --> 00:57:48,114
If you're like this then it'll make Ha Ni awkward.

741
00:57:52,948 --> 00:57:54,114
Stay well.

742
00:57:54,448 --> 00:57:55,581
Okay.

743
00:57:56,819 --> 00:57:58,748
Come back and visit.

744
00:58:03,448 --> 00:58:05,248
Ha Ni, let's go now.

745
00:58:05,581 --> 00:58:06,881
Yes...

746
00:58:12,681 --> 00:58:13,814
Good bye.

747
00:58:18,614 --> 00:58:20,381
Well, then.

748
00:58:36,952 --> 00:58:38,248
Put on your seat belt.

749
00:58:50,014 --> 00:58:51,114
Ha Ni...

750
00:58:58,681 --> 00:59:01,781
Assa! Now I can have my room back.

751
00:59:01,781 --> 00:59:03,348
Baek Eun Jo, You!

752
00:59:03,714 --> 00:59:05,914
Mother! Aren't you going to feed us?

753
00:59:06,281 --> 00:59:08,614
This is all your fault, Seung Jo.

754
01:00:21,148 --> 01:00:25,681
Are you okay? Nothing is wrong with you?

755
01:00:25,681 --> 01:00:29,048
I... really gave up on Baek Seung Jo.

756
01:00:34,048 --> 01:00:35,314
What?

757
01:00:35,314 --> 01:00:39,914
I'm really trying my best to let go of that guy.

758
01:00:40,548 --> 01:00:44,114
Whenever I see Oh Ha Ni, she's amazing.

759
01:00:44,848 --> 01:00:45,914
You should definitely remember,

760
01:00:46,048 --> 01:00:50,348
I am your home. A home that will always be there for you no matter what.

761
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:54,948
You might not like it, but I'm interested in Seung Jo.

762
01:00:55,681 --> 01:00:58,014
I like you.

763
01:00:58,914 --> 01:00:59,814
And you?

764
01:01:01,714 --> 01:01:05,240
Goodbye... Baek Seung Jo.
