1
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:52,700
Carry her!!

2
00:00:52,775 --> 00:00:54,533
Stop!

3
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,893
Carry her!

4
00:01:02,167 --> 00:01:03,249
Don't misunderstand.

5
00:01:03,249 --> 00:01:05,133
I don't have anything to do with this.

6
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:08,867
Oh Ha Ni, I knew you'd do this.

7
00:01:09,214 --> 00:01:11,026
No matter the situation,
you're always a pain.

8
00:01:11,026 --> 00:01:12,844
What?!

9
00:01:12,844 --> 00:01:15,477
- A pain?
- Yes, a pain!

10
00:01:15,477 --> 00:01:16,838
Geez!

11
00:01:16,838 --> 00:01:17,931
Then,

12
00:01:17,931 --> 00:01:19,433
is it okay if I tell them we live together?

13
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:20,567
Are you crazy?

14
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:21,779
So what do you want me to do?

15
00:01:21,779 --> 00:01:24,300
What's going on?

16
00:01:26,205 --> 00:01:31,109
You act all foolish, but you
end up getting what you want.

17
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:33,200
I despise characters like you.

18
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,067
What!

19
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:36,789
This is getting...

20
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:38,533
What?

21
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:40,019
Get on!

22
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:41,133
Forget it!

23
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:44,577
What do you mean forget about it?
If it's what you want, just get on!

24
00:01:44,577 --> 00:01:47,267
I said forget it! Let go of me.

25
00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:51,400
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

26
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:58,967
Baek Seung Jo, aren't you
going to let go of that hand?

27
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,800
I told you to let go!

28
00:02:06,164 --> 00:02:06,991
You again?

29
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:08,433
Yeah! Why?

30
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:17,238
Ha Ni, I heard about it
and I'm very proud of you!

31
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:20,933
And, I'm very sorry I didn't believe
you when you said you were studying.

32
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:27,133
Instead, I'll carry you and go around the
school as many times as you want! Get on!

33
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:28,813
Why are you being like this too?

34
00:02:28,813 --> 00:02:31,900
Get on. Here!

35
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,625
Hey, come here.

36
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:37,633
You jerk!

37
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:39,466
Quick, quick!

38
00:02:41,432 --> 00:02:47,006
- Bong Joon Gu!
- Hey!

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,167
Hey, let me go!

40
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:56,033
Ha Ni, where should we go?

41
00:02:56,033 --> 00:03:00,511
- What do you mean where? Let me down!
- Let's go to the ends of this Earth!

42
00:03:00,511 --> 00:03:02,333
Hey!

43
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:06,333
- Hey, Bong Joon Gu!
- I really can't live because of him!

44
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,811
- Hey! Hurry, let me...
- Let's...

45
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:10,347
Hurry and put me down!

46
00:03:10,347 --> 00:03:12,000
Argh! Really!

47
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,033
Hey, Bong Joon Gu!
Why don't you have any sense?

48
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:23,643
What about me?

49
00:03:23,643 --> 00:03:26,333
How could you give her a
piggyback ride right then?!

50
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,178
Really?

51
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,202
Was I wrong to do that?

52
00:03:32,202 --> 00:03:34,633
Yeah, of course you were!

53
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:37,910
Why do you think Ha Ni studied
like there's no tomorrow?

54
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,197
You interrupting little...

55
00:03:40,197 --> 00:03:42,159
Really?

56
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:47,534
Ha Ni, do you still like Baek Seung Jo?

57
00:03:47,534 --> 00:03:51,900
Even though he embarrassed you,
you still like him?

58
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,040
Perhaps you like annoyingly girly boy kind of style

59
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,867
No, I don't like him.

60
00:03:58,867 --> 00:04:01,333
Why should I like him?
What's there to like about a guy like that?

61
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,800
Exactly!

62
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,767
He has a totally sharp tongue.
He's just out to get people.

63
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:10,602
He's selfish and sneaky.

64
00:04:10,602 --> 00:04:13,433
And he doesn't have a
grain of humanity in him.

65
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:16,867
Anyway, he's over the top.

66
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:18,900
So, you hate him now?

67
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,728
I hate him!

68
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:24,443
Well that's that, but Ha Ni, you
can use the Special Study Hall now?

69
00:04:25,878 --> 00:04:27,400
Yes.

70
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,137
That's right.

71
00:04:29,137 --> 00:04:31,827
- You're amazing!
- How did you do that?

72
00:04:31,827 --> 00:04:34,520
Truly amazing.

73
00:04:35,778 --> 00:04:38,393
See that girl, Oh Ha Ni.

74
00:04:38,393 --> 00:04:40,676
The one that got into
the Special Study Hall?

75
00:04:40,676 --> 00:04:44,272
That's amazing. I'm so jealous!

76
00:04:46,445 --> 00:04:48,911
She's the girl who was
humiliated by Baek Seung Jo.

77
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:50,600
- Her house collapsed.
- That's right, her!

78
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,977
- She always forgets.
- What's with her?

79
00:04:52,977 --> 00:04:57,267
- Hey, it's her. She looks pretty cute.
- Amazing.

80
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,267
Hi!

81
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:20,612
What, are you studying or dating?

82
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,133
Sorry.

83
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,267
Those punks!

84
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:36,200
I'm giving you this because I'm so grateful.
If I don't, then I'd look ungrateful.

85
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:40,300
I don't want it.

86
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,300
OH HA NI!

87
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:55,500
I apologize.

88
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,164
Sorry, sorry.

89
00:07:17,782 --> 00:07:18,900
Move your head! I can't see!

90
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,381
Just be quiet!

91
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:23,153
- I can't see!
- She's right there! Over there!

92
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,700
Who are you?!

93
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,900
What are you doing here?!!

94
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,476
Um... You see...

95
00:07:30,476 --> 00:07:35,059
Vice Principal, I need to check on something. It'll be quick.

96
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,733
Oh these punks, really!

97
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:41,200
There she is!

98
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,604
Ha Ni !

99
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:47,273
Oh Ha Ni!
What are you doing?!

100
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:56,279
Teacher Song Kang Yi.

101
00:07:57,408 --> 00:07:58,974
Teacher!

102
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:02,234
Yes!

103
00:08:02,234 --> 00:08:06,295
Don't you think that student
Oh Ha Ni is a little strange?

104
00:08:06,295 --> 00:08:07,560
Yes, she is a little strange.

105
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,474
No, that's not what I meant.

106
00:08:10,474 --> 00:08:16,480
How could she suddenly go from
the bottom class to the top fifty students?

107
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,223
What's weird about that?

108
00:08:18,223 --> 00:08:20,267
You can achieve anything
when you work hard for it.

109
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:22,874
But it does sound suspicious!

110
00:08:22,874 --> 00:08:24,033
Ha!

111
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:26,267
Why? What's so weird about that?

112
00:08:26,267 --> 00:08:31,033
Could she possibly have cheated?

113
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:33,033
Sorry?

114
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,842
Cheating?

115
00:08:36,842 --> 00:08:39,167
Whose answers could
she copy from in my class?

116
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:43,233
Good.
Let's wait and see.

117
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:45,167
Then, that's it, but...

118
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:54,733
...this Friday, the sophomores are going on a picnic and the juniors an MT. Seniors are the problem.

119
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:57,733
What should we do?
For at least one day...

120
00:08:57,733 --> 00:08:58,983
Let's have a physical tournament!

121
00:08:58,983 --> 00:09:02,234
Seniors doing what?
They only have a few days until their SATs.

122
00:09:02,234 --> 00:09:05,624
They have to build physical strength in order
to study well. Seniors don't even take P.E.

123
00:09:05,624 --> 00:09:09,433
Instead of a day of physical activity,
how about a picnic?

124
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:12,412
Okay, then Teacher Song Ji Ho's class
and my class will be the only participants.

125
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:15,066
What? But why our class...?

126
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:18,570
Are you saying that Class 1 is
better than Class 7 at everything?

127
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,824
We'll just have to wait and
see if that's true or not.

128
00:09:20,824 --> 00:09:23,467
If my class wins, I'll call you "Oppa."

129
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:25,029
B-but... Wh-what?

130
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:27,000
That's a good idea.

131
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,330
Then, what should we make the event about?

132
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,995
Vice Principal!

133
00:09:31,995 --> 00:09:35,233
That doesn't make sense!

134
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:36,733
What do you mean?
Seniors in a physical tournament!?

135
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:41,000
"Let's just blow it!"
You can't think that way!

136
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,633
We have to beat Class 1 and
show them what we've got!

137
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:47,267
Stake your life! Got it?

138
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:49,600
Why don't I hear a response?

139
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:53,300
Bong Joon Gu!

140
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:57,930
Then, Teacher, what are you going to stake?

141
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,500
What?

142
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,833
If we're staking our lives,
what are you going to stake?

143
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,819
Alright.

144
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:10,733
If we win all three events...

145
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:14,233
...I will treat you all to pizza.

146
00:10:20,499 --> 00:10:24,352
For this tournament, let's take the opportunity
to make Class 1 all bleed from their noses!

147
00:10:24,352 --> 00:10:26,019
Got it?!

148
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,990
Give your strength! Give your strength!
Give your strength! Give your strength!

149
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,757
Fighting!

150
00:11:01,757 --> 00:11:07,090
Give your strength! Give your strength!
Give your strength! Give your strength!

151
00:11:09,523 --> 00:11:11,257
That's not it.

152
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,157
Listen carefully, okay?

153
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:19,890
The baton pass is very
important for this race.

154
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,457
When you get the baton, your
left hand should be stretched out,

155
00:11:23,457 --> 00:11:26,457
and you run, run, run, run all the while.

156
00:11:26,457 --> 00:11:28,257
You are standing by.

157
00:11:28,257 --> 00:11:30,623
If you're like like this, so stiff,

158
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,523
...your start will be late
and that won't do!

159
00:11:32,523 --> 00:11:34,089
Do you get it?

160
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:36,474
Then, should we try it again?

161
00:11:37,423 --> 00:11:38,657
Ha Ni!

162
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,390
Come over here, dear.

163
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,323
Let's...see...

164
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,390
When you're passing
the baton, with your right...

165
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,823
...hand here.
No, no, no, right here.

166
00:11:49,823 --> 00:11:52,890
Okay, okay, you're running, running.

167
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,157
Now. That's right!

168
00:11:54,157 --> 00:11:57,357
Our Ha Ni is doing so well!

169
00:11:57,357 --> 00:11:59,323
Let's try again.

170
00:11:59,323 --> 00:12:01,590
There's no better comedy than this!

171
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,557
What? Baek Seung Jo!

172
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:07,390
Did you come here to steal our strategy?

173
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,323
You even have a strategy?

174
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,957
Baek Seung Jo!
Don't cry when we win!

175
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:13,790
I'm not going to go easy.

176
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,857
Do whatever you want.

177
00:12:14,857 --> 00:12:19,157
Our class isn't interested
in a physical tournament.

178
00:12:19,157 --> 00:12:21,423
Your class will definitely win.

179
00:12:21,423 --> 00:12:22,790
Wh...what'd you say?

180
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,857
So, your class is going to go easy and
that's why we'll win, is that what you're saying?

181
00:12:25,857 --> 00:12:27,723
This punk! You're going too far!

182
00:12:27,723 --> 00:12:29,057
- Really!
- Stop!

183
00:12:29,057 --> 00:12:29,857
Ah, Joon Gu!

184
00:12:29,857 --> 00:12:31,790
How pitiful.

185
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,690
What's pitiful?

186
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:36,796
What?

187
00:12:36,796 --> 00:12:39,257
Why is doing your best pitiful?

188
00:12:40,086 --> 00:12:42,657
You're not going to do your
best so we're gonna win?

189
00:12:44,757 --> 00:12:46,390
Joon Gu is super fast!

190
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,323
And he's good at sports!

191
00:12:48,323 --> 00:12:50,423
Did you have any idea?

192
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,357
Ha Ni!

193
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,623
Just because you think you'll lose...
How cowardly!

194
00:12:57,023 --> 00:13:01,057
Well... losing to a fight....
will cause more of a laughter.

195
00:13:01,057 --> 00:13:02,457
What?

196
00:13:02,457 --> 00:13:03,323
Cock?

197
00:13:03,323 --> 00:13:05,723
Yeah!! Cock!!

198
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,123
Oh my! How fun that's going to be!

199
00:13:14,123 --> 00:13:16,523
You two are both in the race?

200
00:13:16,523 --> 00:13:18,957
That's cool!

201
00:13:18,957 --> 00:13:21,123
But who do I cheer for?

202
00:13:21,123 --> 00:13:23,942
It's worrying me...

203
00:13:23,942 --> 00:13:25,890
You're not really thinking of going...?

204
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,890
Of course I will. I'll be taking pictures.

205
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,990
It's not like an
elementary tournament!

206
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,312
But still...

207
00:13:33,457 --> 00:13:35,923
What's so fun about P.E.?

208
00:13:35,923 --> 00:13:37,123
Wow!

209
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:39,623
Ah!

210
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:43,090
Eun Jo, you have to retake
the jump roping test?

211
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:43,657
When is it?

212
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:47,523
I don't know. When would I
ever use jump roping?

213
00:13:47,523 --> 00:13:48,923
You want me to teach you?

214
00:13:48,923 --> 00:13:50,023
I'm good at jump roping.

215
00:13:50,023 --> 00:13:53,490
That's all right. What can a fool teach?

216
00:13:54,523 --> 00:13:56,957
At first, I wasn't good either,

217
00:13:56,957 --> 00:13:59,557
but after giving it my best, it worked out well.

218
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,957
Well? What can work out well?

219
00:14:01,957 --> 00:14:06,157
They say if you keep sharpening steel,
it will eventually become a needle.

220
00:14:06,157 --> 00:14:11,190
Oh my! Where did you
learn sayings like that?

221
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,823
From my Grandma.

222
00:14:12,823 --> 00:14:14,823
Aiyoo, how adorable.

223
00:14:14,823 --> 00:14:16,323
Here.

224
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,690
Wooow!

225
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,623
You should wear one too!

226
00:14:31,623 --> 00:14:34,357
I don't want to! I'm not going to cosplay!

227
00:14:34,357 --> 00:14:36,223
Just leave it then!

228
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:38,323
Min Ah, can you zip this up for me?

229
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,657
Hey! You're wearing this
even though it's so hot?

230
00:14:45,657 --> 00:14:47,956
Yep, Jang Mi gave this to me.

231
00:14:48,256 --> 00:14:50,356
She said this is the only one that fits me.

232
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,523
Really?

233
00:14:52,523 --> 00:14:54,757
That fox-like girl treating you...

234
00:14:55,823 --> 00:14:58,257
Hey, Ha Ni, take a look at me.

235
00:14:58,257 --> 00:14:59,987
How do I look?

236
00:14:59,987 --> 00:15:02,757
Ohhhhh!
Lady Gaga!

237
00:15:02,757 --> 00:15:04,357
Correct!

238
00:15:04,357 --> 00:15:05,523
Oh look at me!

239
00:15:05,523 --> 00:15:07,323
With a square waist...

240
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,957
A pig's shape line?

241
00:15:11,557 --> 00:15:13,290
A pig's shape line? You wanna get hit?

242
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,923
- Hey, come over here!
- Ahhh!

243
00:15:14,923 --> 00:15:16,023
Hey, stand right there!

244
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:18,657
Hey, hey, hey! Go Min Ah!

245
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:24,190
Seung Jo!

246
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,123
We have to wear this.

247
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,557
Ah, it's Baek Seung Jo.

248
00:15:29,557 --> 00:15:31,357
Hurry and come to the field!

249
00:15:36,523 --> 00:15:39,057
Ah, he doesn't know it's me!

250
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:40,857
Pitiful?

251
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,890
You're dead!

252
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,190
Who are you?

253
00:16:19,257 --> 00:16:20,557
You!

254
00:16:58,923 --> 00:17:01,090
Class 7 Fighting!

255
00:17:05,323 --> 00:17:06,123
Ah, it's hot!

256
00:17:06,123 --> 00:17:07,657
Are you hot?

257
00:17:07,657 --> 00:17:08,923
I can't wear it any longer!

258
00:17:08,923 --> 00:17:10,257
- Why? You have to!
- Awwww...

259
00:17:10,257 --> 00:17:11,323
Ahhhh I don't want to!

260
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:12,957
You have to wear it!

261
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:18,723
Players...

262
00:17:18,723 --> 00:17:20,923
...face each other.

263
00:17:20,923 --> 00:17:23,757
Greet each other.

264
00:17:26,257 --> 00:17:27,357
Ready!

265
00:17:27,357 --> 00:17:28,990
Let's do well!

266
00:17:34,657 --> 00:17:36,557
We are one!

267
00:18:23,523 --> 00:18:26,957
Teacher! Teacher!

268
00:18:27,944 --> 00:18:29,157
Give it your all, kids!

269
00:18:29,157 --> 00:18:30,957
Let's go!

270
00:18:50,989 --> 00:18:52,356
I'm sorry.

271
00:19:04,223 --> 00:19:05,422
Class 1 Fighting!

272
00:19:05,422 --> 00:19:08,100
Class 1 Fighting!

273
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,223
Pull!

274
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,700
Class 7 wins!

275
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,390
Omo!

276
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,957
What in the world!

277
00:19:41,838 --> 00:19:45,443
Please bring the list of the students
who will be running in the relay race.

278
00:19:50,343 --> 00:19:51,784
Oppa! Baek Seung Jo Fighting!
Baek Seung Jo! Baek Seung Jo!

279
00:19:51,784 --> 00:19:55,243
Hey! Hey! You!

280
00:19:55,243 --> 00:19:56,909
Shh! Shh! Shh!

281
00:19:56,909 --> 00:19:58,310
Oh my!

282
00:19:59,843 --> 00:20:01,677
Sit down. Sit down.

283
00:20:01,677 --> 00:20:02,643
Quiet.

284
00:20:02,643 --> 00:20:05,843
You came, Mother?

285
00:20:06,329 --> 00:20:09,792
I'm Jang Mi.
Hong Jang Mi.

286
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,043
Hong Jang Mi?

287
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:16,410
My mother and I have been to your house before.
We have the eyeglass store at the intersection.

288
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,515
Ah, Jang Mi! The eyeglass
store at the intersection!

289
00:20:20,515 --> 00:20:22,610
Long time no see.

290
00:20:23,192 --> 00:20:25,107
But, are you cheering for Seung Jo?

291
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:26,511
Pardon?

292
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,543
Yes.

293
00:20:29,743 --> 00:20:31,676
You came at the right time.

294
00:20:31,676 --> 00:20:35,310
I was deciding who to cheer for.

295
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,877
You cheer for Seung Jo, okay?

296
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,443
Pardon?

297
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:49,143
Um, dois três, quatro...

298
00:20:49,143 --> 00:20:51,010
Baek Seung Jo.

299
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:54,577
What do you think? It's 2 : 0!

300
00:20:55,625 --> 00:21:02,577
It looks like you guys tried really freaking hard.
Didn't you say you're doing it half-heartedly?

301
00:21:05,517 --> 00:21:11,743
Hey, punk! If a person is talking, you should reply.
Are you deaf? Can't you hear me! Can't you hear me!

302
00:21:12,243 --> 00:21:13,843
Are you the last runner?

303
00:21:14,077 --> 00:21:14,810
What?

304
00:21:15,543 --> 00:21:17,777
Yeah! Why?

305
00:21:20,477 --> 00:21:22,277
Are you the last runner too?

306
00:21:22,277 --> 00:21:23,077
Yes.

307
00:21:23,077 --> 00:21:28,443
Yah. Normally, the fastest
runner is supposed to go last.

308
00:21:28,943 --> 00:21:30,910
Did you guys plan wrong?

309
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:41,810
Oh, are you warming up right now?

310
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:45,243
But, you, Baek Seung Jo,
you know how to run a race?

311
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:48,577
I thought you always sit down
and read books all the time.

312
00:21:48,577 --> 00:21:50,477
It's an exception of you.

313
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:54,443
It should be "unexpected" not "an exception."

314
00:21:56,243 --> 00:21:57,010
Huh?

315
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,943
Unexpected or an exception.

316
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,877
Hey, Baek Seung Jo!
Don't mess with me! I'm not going easy!

317
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:07,643
Oppa...

318
00:22:10,243 --> 00:22:11,877
It's two to zero.

319
00:22:12,743 --> 00:22:16,643
Aren't you losing on purpose
just to be called "Oppa?"

320
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:23,477
Ah, we're the same age.
How am I going to call you "Oppa!"

321
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,777
Clearly...

322
00:22:28,477 --> 00:22:30,743
...you said if you win all three rounds.

323
00:22:30,743 --> 00:22:34,677
Yes, if we win all three rounds,
I will call you "Oppa."

324
00:22:34,677 --> 00:22:38,610
So, if my class wins the race,
this topic is over.

325
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,420
Yup.

326
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,710
Players line up!

327
00:22:44,943 --> 00:22:45,777
Here, Fighting!

328
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,143
Fighting!

329
00:22:47,877 --> 00:22:48,417
Fighting!

330
00:22:53,177 --> 00:22:57,810
- Kids, fighting!
- Fighting!

331
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,810
100 meters in 15 seconds, right?

332
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:02,443
What? Ah, yes.
When I was in middle school?

333
00:23:02,743 --> 00:23:03,710
What did you say?

334
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:09,810
We are Class 7! Class 7! Class7!

335
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:16,294
Oh, my!

336
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:17,743
Oppa!

337
00:23:17,777 --> 00:23:23,910
Song Ji Oh! Song Ji Oh! Song Ji Oh!

338
00:23:27,177 --> 00:23:28,343
Oh...

339
00:23:28,343 --> 00:23:30,610
What to do?

340
00:23:33,343 --> 00:23:35,910
Teacher! Hurry and get up! Hurry up!

341
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:39,943
Ha Ni! Trust me! You have me!

342
00:23:39,943 --> 00:23:41,677
Aigoo! What to do?

343
00:23:41,677 --> 00:23:42,877
Hurry up!

344
00:23:42,877 --> 00:23:44,810
This won't do.

345
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,143
Hurry and get up!

346
00:23:46,143 --> 00:23:47,577
Faster!

347
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,510
HA NI!

348
00:24:24,443 --> 00:24:30,043
Wow! Good! Ha Ni come here! Come to me!

349
00:24:30,043 --> 00:24:32,510
See? Did you see it?!

350
00:24:40,543 --> 00:24:44,977
Omo! What is this?! Fighting, Ha Ni!

351
00:24:44,977 --> 00:24:47,043
Ha Ni!

352
00:24:49,077 --> 00:24:51,343
Everyone, don't worry!

353
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:53,777
I'll be going first.

354
00:24:54,477 --> 00:24:57,043
That's right! Keep going!

355
00:24:59,577 --> 00:25:02,243
I'm sorry, but this victory is for Class 7.

356
00:25:04,777 --> 00:25:06,543
Joon Gu, I'll believe in you.

357
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,043
Oh? What?

358
00:25:18,577 --> 00:25:22,477
Baek Seung Jo is looking at me.

359
00:25:24,443 --> 00:25:27,877
Baek Seung Jo is looking at me.

360
00:25:35,043 --> 00:25:39,310
Baek Seung Jo is smiling at me
and holding out his hand.

361
00:25:41,043 --> 00:25:42,810
This is the first time.

362
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:56,343
Fool.

363
00:26:06,377 --> 00:26:07,710
Oh, Ha Ni!

364
00:26:08,343 --> 00:26:11,177
Oh Ha Ni! Baton! Baton!

365
00:26:14,377 --> 00:26:16,210
Don't worry, okay?

366
00:26:24,443 --> 00:26:28,944
- Baek Seung Jo! Baek Seung Jo!
- Bong Joon Gu! Bong Joon Gu!

367
00:26:29,277 --> 00:26:31,310
Oh! Joon Gu is really fast!

368
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,577
Oh Ha Ni!

369
00:27:10,277 --> 00:27:14,710
- Hey!
- Our pizza!

370
00:27:34,177 --> 00:27:39,477
Baek Seung Jo! Don't think that you've won!

371
00:27:39,477 --> 00:27:43,543
This was because of Teacher's fall!

372
00:27:43,543 --> 00:27:45,977
Normally, you'd be loud
when you lose a fight.

373
00:27:45,977 --> 00:27:46,877
What?!

374
00:27:48,743 --> 00:27:50,910
Hey! Hey!

375
00:28:04,409 --> 00:28:05,743
There is no...

376
00:28:08,377 --> 00:28:09,643
...pizza.

377
00:28:09,643 --> 00:28:12,543
WHAT?! WHY!

378
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,777
A promise is a promise.
There is no pizza.

379
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,743
- It's because you fell, Teacher!
- What are you talking about?

380
00:28:18,743 --> 00:28:22,143
I had the good sense to give it to Ha Ni!

381
00:28:22,143 --> 00:28:25,077
That's right!
Where's Oh Ha Ni?

382
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,510
Ha Ni is over here!

383
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,243
Ha Ni is right here!

384
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:34,910
Teach! Teach! Do something!

385
00:28:36,777 --> 00:28:38,677
That's right! You treat us!

386
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:41,477
- That's right! That's right!
- Yeah, treat us!

387
00:28:41,477 --> 00:28:43,910
Quiet, will you?!

388
00:28:46,477 --> 00:28:48,710
A person can get confused.

389
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:51,877
We were losing completely,
but she managed to turn it around.

390
00:28:53,343 --> 00:28:54,743
Ha Ni...

391
00:28:54,877 --> 00:28:56,710
I'm sorry.

392
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:00,377
I should have stretched
my arm out further,

393
00:29:00,577 --> 00:29:02,110
but my arm was short.

394
00:29:02,643 --> 00:29:03,543
- Ah.
- What is this?

395
00:29:04,177 --> 00:29:05,610
Then, you should treat us to pizza!

396
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:09,210
- Treat us! Treat us!
- Buy us pizza! Treat us!

397
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,110
Alright, alright!
I'll buy you pizza! How much is it?

398
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,477
Around $150?

399
00:29:13,477 --> 00:29:16,777
Huh? A hundred, a hundred fifty?!

400
00:29:16,777 --> 00:29:20,010
Aish, I don't have that kind of money.

401
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,343
I'll buy you pizza.

402
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:30,310
Everyone was so great today!
You don't know how much fun I had in the stands.

403
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:34,277
Thanks for letting me have fun in the stands.
So, I'll buy you all pizza!

404
00:29:34,277 --> 00:29:37,243
Ah, who... are you?
Ah, this person is...

405
00:29:37,477 --> 00:29:39,810
Ha Ni's fan! Oh Ha Ni!

406
00:29:40,577 --> 00:29:42,877
I came to cheer her on today!

407
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,381
Who are you?

408
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:55,421
Who are you?

409
00:29:57,243 --> 00:29:58,951
Children!

410
00:30:17,143 --> 00:30:20,547
Aigoo! It hurts!

411
00:30:22,626 --> 00:30:25,377
There's not even one part that doesn't hurt.

412
00:30:28,717 --> 00:30:30,624
I should put on some Pahss.
(pain reliever patches)

413
00:30:41,145 --> 00:30:42,620
You're not sleeping yet?

414
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:46,793
So you were over there?

415
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,190
I didn't know.

416
00:30:57,367 --> 00:30:59,855
How long have you been sitting here?

417
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,753
Wow, it's really pretty here!

418
00:31:07,483 --> 00:31:09,252
Did you get sunburned?

419
00:31:09,252 --> 00:31:10,389
Huh?

420
00:31:14,064 --> 00:31:17,922
Since you were risking your life,
you must be hurting.

421
00:31:19,393 --> 00:31:20,990
You really did your best.

422
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:23,255
The least I can do is do my best.

423
00:31:24,195 --> 00:31:26,320
It must be nice for you...

424
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,233
...being good at everything. You even run well.

425
00:31:29,233 --> 00:31:32,611
I'm good at basketball and swimming as well.

426
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,067
Such a show off.

427
00:31:35,067 --> 00:31:37,867
You seemed upset for a few days.

428
00:31:37,867 --> 00:31:40,300
Why'd you give me the baton?

429
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,596
You got another trump card in your hand again.

430
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:45,293
That's right.

431
00:31:45,293 --> 00:31:48,958
All right, I'm fine with you mocking me.

432
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:51,351
You must have suffered a bit
from your classmates.

433
00:31:55,588 --> 00:31:59,616
Ah, but you know, your mom
came and bought us pizza.

434
00:31:59,616 --> 00:32:01,533
So, it was okay.

435
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:03,054
My mom?

436
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:07,019
Typical, my mom is unstoppable.

437
00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:10,383
Other households say that the father
or the children are the troublemakers...

438
00:32:10,383 --> 00:32:15,133
But in our family, my mom
is the troublemaker.

439
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,345
Why?

440
00:32:17,316 --> 00:32:21,067
I like your mom a lot. Very much.

441
00:32:21,067 --> 00:32:22,500
You like her that much?

442
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,733
I like her a lot.

443
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:32,356
Even today, she came and
bought us pizza, took pictures of us.

444
00:32:32,356 --> 00:32:33,738
I was happy.

445
00:32:33,738 --> 00:32:35,867
Were you really that happy?

446
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:37,303
Yes.

447
00:32:37,303 --> 00:32:41,251
I've never had my mom come
to school like that before.

448
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:43,733
She passed away at a young age.

449
00:32:45,467 --> 00:32:48,867
Of course my dad and
my grandma came instead.

450
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:56,367
But, although I was grateful,
I don't think I was really happy.

451
00:32:56,367 --> 00:32:58,567
I wonder if that would
make them feel disappointed?

452
00:32:59,649 --> 00:33:05,260
But today, it felt as if my mom really came.

453
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,121
Go down and ask for
some pain relieving patches.

454
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,100
I'll help with dinner, too.

455
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,067
You should res...

456
00:33:25,067 --> 00:33:30,867
Well, I suppose if you're going to
live here, you would want to help out.

457
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:35,267
Also...

458
00:33:35,267 --> 00:33:36,121
Huh?

459
00:33:36,121 --> 00:33:38,447
That...

460
00:33:38,447 --> 00:33:41,800
The thing you were wearing this morning.
What is it?

461
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,700
Oh. That. Stinky Butt, Bboong-Bboong.

462
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,167
You don't know it?

463
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:50,346
Oowee boong oowee boong
oowee oowee boong boong!

464
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:55,900
It was cute.

465
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:00,900
But what?

466
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,500
What did he say?

467
00:34:04,716 --> 00:34:06,216
Ear?
(the first part of "cute" sounds like "ear")

468
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,300
Did I have no ear?

469
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,200
What are you looking at?

470
00:34:15,226 --> 00:34:17,177
Ohh, are these the photos you took today?

471
00:34:17,177 --> 00:34:18,933
Today was so much fun.

472
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:21,467
Wow, the pictures came out really well.

473
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,967
Ha Ni is a lot of fun, right?

474
00:34:24,967 --> 00:34:26,347
Yes.

475
00:34:26,347 --> 00:34:30,033
Our house feels like a real "home"
ever since Ha Ni moved in.

476
00:34:30,033 --> 00:34:32,100
That's right.

477
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,544
Seung Jo too. Look at his expression.

478
00:34:35,544 --> 00:34:41,600
Except for when he was little, it's been a long time since I've seen this kind of expression on him.

479
00:34:42,967 --> 00:34:44,067
That's true.

480
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,616
Before the summer is over,

481
00:34:47,616 --> 00:34:51,033
let's go on a vacation somewhere.
Why don't we go on an overnight vacation somewhere?

482
00:34:51,033 --> 00:34:52,667
The kids are busy high school seniors.

483
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:54,567
That's exactly why we should go!

484
00:34:54,567 --> 00:34:57,900
Once they submit their college applications,
we really won't have a chance to go.

485
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:01,500
You think so?

486
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:09,433
This congratulatory party is a bit late, eh?

487
00:35:09,433 --> 00:35:10,767
I suppose.

488
00:35:10,767 --> 00:35:15,167
I'm sorry, Ha Ni, we should have done
it immediately after your grades came out.

489
00:35:15,167 --> 00:35:19,200
It's okay. I was busy with
the sports festival anyway.

490
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,300
Wow, so big.

491
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:24,067
What does "mo ri" mean?

492
00:35:24,067 --> 00:35:27,567
We put all kinds of seafood in here,

493
00:35:27,567 --> 00:35:32,300
and we eat it together with other people.
So I named it "Mo Di" noodles (all together).

494
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,053
But, the ending of the name kept changing,
and it eventually became "Mo Ri" noodles.

495
00:35:36,053 --> 00:35:39,733
Ah, so "mo di" means "all" and "together"?

496
00:35:39,733 --> 00:35:41,233
Exactly!

497
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:49,067
And, thank you so much, Seung Jo.
You really are impressive.

498
00:35:49,067 --> 00:35:50,233
No.

499
00:35:50,233 --> 00:35:52,100
Oh, no!

500
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:58,449
Getting someone like Seung Jo
to tutor her is even more impressive.

501
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:00,067
I'm so thankful!

502
00:36:00,067 --> 00:36:03,100
What are you doing? I am supposed to be saying thank you!
Thank you!

503
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,933
Oh, no. It's nothing.
Thank you!

504
00:36:05,933 --> 00:36:08,167
Stop, your hair will fall (into the food).

505
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,333
Look here.

506
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:15,483
We can't let a night like this pass by
without having a round of drinks, right?

507
00:36:15,483 --> 00:36:18,633
How about it? Our main star, want a drink?

508
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:20,300
Me too?

509
00:36:24,067 --> 00:36:29,633
Sure. Since an adult is giving it
to you, just have one drink.

510
00:36:30,449 --> 00:36:31,416
Here!

511
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:34,600
"Tremble, tremble, tremble."

512
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,433
Seung Jo, too.

513
00:36:36,433 --> 00:36:40,600
Then, lift your glasses!

514
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,767
A toast to our wonderful children!

515
00:36:45,767 --> 00:36:48,300
Cheers!

516
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,900
Here.

517
00:36:54,067 --> 00:36:58,400
But, Ha Ni, you worked really hard.
I was so surprised.

518
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,916
You know, Ha Ni's nickname...

519
00:37:00,916 --> 00:37:02,500
...is "Noah's Snail".

520
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,633
"Noah's Snail"?

521
00:37:03,633 --> 00:37:05,667
Yes. My grandmother used to call me that.

522
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:07,367
The Noah from Noah and the Ark?

523
00:37:07,367 --> 00:37:12,400
Exactly! All of the animals
got onto that ark, right?

524
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,533
But, this snail, no one took care of it.

525
00:37:16,533 --> 00:37:21,767
So all night long, the snail
inched along tirelessly.

526
00:37:21,767 --> 00:37:24,100
And at last, it finally got onto the ark.

527
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,733
I'm pretty good at working
towards something for a long time.

528
00:37:33,332 --> 00:37:39,900
I'm not just saying this, but this
alcohol doesn't have an ounce of water in it.

529
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,333
When you're drinking it, it might
seem okay, but it'll hit you all at once.

530
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:45,033
Oh, really?

531
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:52,167
My friend, you like crabs, right? Eat a lot!

532
00:37:52,167 --> 00:37:56,833
Man, even when we were young, you always looked out for me. You're still taking care of me like this.

533
00:37:56,833 --> 00:37:58,200
Well, we lived it up a bit.

534
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,483
We really stuck together, eh?

535
00:38:02,483 --> 00:38:04,200
We even had a band together.

536
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,500
Oh? I've never heard about that before.

537
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:11,033
Ah, we never "had" a band.
We just said that we should start one.

538
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:13,567
Should I go get the guitar?

539
00:38:24,328 --> 00:38:29,608
Every day with you,

540
00:38:29,608 --> 00:38:34,677
I receive the morning sun.

541
00:38:34,677 --> 00:38:39,828
Every day with you,

542
00:38:39,828 --> 00:38:44,995
I want to open my eyes.

543
00:38:44,995 --> 00:38:50,229
Every day with you,
Every day with you,

544
00:38:50,229 --> 00:38:55,320
just the two of us.

545
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:00,428
- Every day with you,
- Every day with you,

546
00:39:00,428 --> 00:39:04,795
I want to talk with you.

547
00:39:04,795 --> 00:39:09,895
The street with it raining at dawn.

548
00:39:09,895 --> 00:39:15,295
The flaming sun setting in the evening.

549
00:39:15,295 --> 00:39:20,962
Everything around us.

550
00:39:20,962 --> 00:39:24,395
I want to share it with you.

551
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,362
Oh, Seung Jo, you were here.

552
00:39:28,695 --> 00:39:31,995
Every day with you,

553
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,928
All of this is for you, Lord.

554
00:39:33,928 --> 00:39:39,195
In the arms of night.

555
00:39:39,195 --> 00:39:44,195
- Every day with you,
- Every day with you,

556
00:39:44,195 --> 00:39:48,695
I want to fall asleep.

557
00:39:48,695 --> 00:39:53,862
The streets being rained on during dawn.

558
00:39:53,862 --> 00:39:59,095
The flaming sun setting in the evening.

559
00:39:59,095 --> 00:40:04,862
Everything around us.

560
00:40:04,862 --> 00:40:08,995
I want to share it with you.

561
00:40:12,628 --> 00:40:17,828
- Every day with you,
- Every day with you,

562
00:40:17,828 --> 00:40:21,962
I want to sleep.

563
00:40:22,995 --> 00:40:26,662
Every day with you.

564
00:40:26,662 --> 00:40:28,128
Ah, really.

565
00:40:28,128 --> 00:40:31,762
Every day with you.

566
00:40:40,928 --> 00:40:43,162
Shut up!!

567
00:40:43,162 --> 00:40:47,395
Oppa, oppa! Oppa!

568
00:40:51,628 --> 00:40:53,828
You're still as good as ever!

569
00:40:53,828 --> 00:40:55,595
You're really good too!

570
00:40:55,595 --> 00:40:57,595
This is so much fun!

571
00:40:57,595 --> 00:41:00,695
Hey, Seung Jo, why
don't you play a song too?

572
00:41:00,695 --> 00:41:01,795
Are you drunk?

573
00:41:01,795 --> 00:41:05,695
Oh my. Hey, don't act cool and just play a song.

574
00:41:05,695 --> 00:41:08,062
It's alright.

575
00:41:08,062 --> 00:41:10,428
Would the great Baek Seung Jo...

576
00:41:10,428 --> 00:41:14,595
...sing in an environment like this?

577
00:41:14,595 --> 00:41:16,528
Are you drunk?

578
00:41:16,528 --> 00:41:18,762
Drunk?

579
00:41:18,762 --> 00:41:20,695
I didn't even finish one glass.

580
00:41:20,695 --> 00:41:23,628
Aigoo.

581
00:41:25,762 --> 00:41:28,362
Calling me a public menace.

582
00:41:29,995 --> 00:41:30,762
Dad.

583
00:41:30,762 --> 00:41:31,828
Yes.

584
00:41:31,828 --> 00:41:37,162
He sees me as a pain in the ass.

585
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:38,195
Huh?

586
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:40,828
That means we're living off of them.

587
00:41:40,828 --> 00:41:42,462
Really?

588
00:41:43,395 --> 00:41:44,662
Is that right?

589
00:41:44,662 --> 00:41:46,262
No. That's not it.

590
00:41:46,262 --> 00:41:47,496
He's said something right.

591
00:41:48,228 --> 00:41:49,695
Baek Eun Jo!

592
00:41:49,695 --> 00:41:54,295
Baek Seung Jo, are you that great?

593
00:41:54,295 --> 00:41:56,095
If you are great,

594
00:41:56,095 --> 00:41:58,695
is it okay to ignore people?

595
00:41:58,695 --> 00:42:02,662
You told me not to say
anything about living with you.

596
00:42:02,662 --> 00:42:05,562
Then, how do I explain?

597
00:42:05,562 --> 00:42:10,128
In a place with all those people,

598
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:13,028
did you really have to talk like that?

599
00:42:13,028 --> 00:42:15,162
Every time...

600
00:42:15,162 --> 00:42:17,295
You bad guy!

601
00:42:18,195 --> 00:42:18,895
Let's go.

602
00:42:18,895 --> 00:42:20,128
Oh, okay.

603
00:42:20,128 --> 00:42:22,462
Look at that, look at that.

604
00:42:22,462 --> 00:42:25,162
Completely ignoring what people say.

605
00:42:25,162 --> 00:42:28,128
Always cynical, laughing at others,

606
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:32,961
and choosing to say only the
things that make people feel bad.

607
00:42:33,828 --> 00:42:35,662
I really, completely don't like him.

608
00:42:35,662 --> 00:42:38,395
Are you drunk again?

609
00:42:38,395 --> 00:42:40,195
Aigoo.

610
00:42:42,462 --> 00:42:44,595
Ha Ni, you dislike Seung Jo that much?

611
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:46,928
At the sports event,

612
00:42:46,928 --> 00:42:50,295
I thought you two looked really good together.

613
00:42:51,028 --> 00:42:53,395
I didn't know you disliked him that much.

614
00:42:53,395 --> 00:42:57,228
Yes, I don't like him.

615
00:42:57,228 --> 00:43:04,628
(Seung Jo's) Mother, father, Eun Jo. I like you all,

616
00:43:05,452 --> 00:43:10,228
but I don't like Baek Seung Jo!

617
00:43:11,195 --> 00:43:12,295
Really?

618
00:43:12,495 --> 00:43:13,695
Yeah.

619
00:43:13,695 --> 00:43:15,962
You're contradicting yourself.

620
00:43:15,962 --> 00:43:17,636
What?

621
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:22,028
"Actually, I don't call you Seung Jo,"

622
00:43:22,028 --> 00:43:26,362
"I call you 'The Spirit of the Forest'."

623
00:43:26,362 --> 00:43:30,362
"After that day, I was hurt for several days."

624
00:43:30,362 --> 00:43:32,062
"I had a rough time."

625
00:43:32,062 --> 00:43:32,795
Hey!

626
00:43:32,795 --> 00:43:35,728
"At least once, I pass by you in school,"

627
00:43:35,728 --> 00:43:40,328
"But, I still want to see you every day."

628
00:43:40,762 --> 00:43:44,495
"In my dreams, you're so sweet."

629
00:43:44,495 --> 00:43:46,795
Shee, HEY!

630
00:43:50,695 --> 00:43:52,095
Stupid jerk!

631
00:43:52,095 --> 00:43:55,895
What is that? Spirit of the Forest?

632
00:43:55,895 --> 00:44:01,395
Ha Ni, did you write Seung Jo a letter?

633
00:44:01,395 --> 00:44:06,728
Wait. That guy...
...it was Seung Jo?

634
00:44:08,795 --> 00:44:10,828
Did you have to go this far?

635
00:44:11,228 --> 00:44:13,762
Did you memorize it to make fun of me?

636
00:44:13,762 --> 00:44:16,695
What am I supposed to do if I can
memorize it after looking at it once?

637
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,928
Okay.

638
00:44:19,395 --> 00:44:22,495
You're weak if you like someone.

639
00:44:22,495 --> 00:44:28,762
But, now that's over. It's completely over.

640
00:44:28,762 --> 00:44:34,462
The last remaining feelings I
had for you, I got rid of them all.

641
00:44:35,562 --> 00:44:36,195
Is that so?

642
00:44:36,195 --> 00:44:37,962
Yes.

643
00:44:37,962 --> 00:44:44,562
Petty. Since it's dirty
and petty, I can't do it anymore.

644
00:44:45,928 --> 00:44:51,562
Baek Seung Jo, you! I really don't like you.

645
00:44:52,795 --> 00:44:53,462
Oh Ha Ni!

646
00:44:53,462 --> 00:44:56,195
Hey, hey, hey.

647
00:44:56,195 --> 00:44:58,062
What is this?

648
00:44:59,328 --> 00:45:02,128
Stupid jerk!

649
00:45:02,128 --> 00:45:04,795
She's stupid to the bone...

650
00:45:05,362 --> 00:45:08,162
Seung Jo, help her.

651
00:45:08,162 --> 00:45:08,828
Me?

652
00:45:08,828 --> 00:45:09,762
Then who? Me?

653
00:45:09,762 --> 00:45:11,628
I'm here. I'll take care of her.

654
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:16,362
Get on my back. Get on, get on.

655
00:45:19,195 --> 00:45:24,262
Are you drunk too? It really hit me all at once!

656
00:45:24,262 --> 00:45:26,295
See! Hurry.

657
00:45:26,295 --> 00:45:28,362
Oh, annoying.

658
00:45:42,028 --> 00:45:42,795
Hey, Ki Dong.

659
00:45:42,795 --> 00:45:44,062
Yes?

660
00:45:44,062 --> 00:45:46,395
You think we'll be in-laws?

661
00:45:46,395 --> 00:45:48,795
Oh, is that so?

662
00:45:48,795 --> 00:45:51,995
That doesn't make sense.
If so, then I'm moving out.

663
00:45:51,995 --> 00:45:54,595
There's nothing you can't say.

664
00:45:59,728 --> 00:46:01,728
Aigoo. What's wrong?

665
00:46:03,662 --> 00:46:05,895
It's so beautiful!

666
00:46:12,028 --> 00:46:15,662
Stupid jerk.

667
00:46:19,028 --> 00:46:22,695
Oh Ha Ni, you're amazing.
In the end, you got your piggyback ride.

668
00:46:22,695 --> 00:46:26,931
Huh? What did you say?

669
00:46:26,931 --> 00:46:29,395
I said Oh Ha Ni is great.

670
00:46:35,462 --> 00:46:40,328
Hey, let me down.
Why are you giving me a piggyback ride?

671
00:46:41,162 --> 00:46:43,595
You said you got rid of your feelings.

672
00:46:43,595 --> 00:46:47,495
Huh? Yeah, I did. Why?

673
00:46:48,293 --> 00:46:51,562
You did, so why is it beating like that?

674
00:46:51,562 --> 00:46:52,528
What?

675
00:46:52,528 --> 00:46:54,195
Are you okay?

676
00:46:57,262 --> 00:46:59,928
Heart, your heart.

677
00:47:04,428 --> 00:47:05,762
But...

678
00:47:06,395 --> 00:47:09,328
It's more serious than I thought, Oh Ha Ni.

679
00:47:09,328 --> 00:47:11,128
What?

680
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:15,862
Well, being like that, do you think
you'll be able to have a baby and raise it?

681
00:47:18,262 --> 00:47:20,928
- Hey!
- Hey!

682
00:47:34,131 --> 00:47:37,328
Oh, I found it!

683
00:47:44,262 --> 00:47:46,262
Ha Ni!

684
00:48:17,037 --> 00:48:20,018
You were hanging them in your room.

685
00:48:20,018 --> 00:48:21,884
Aigoo, I was wondering.

686
00:48:21,884 --> 00:48:24,909
Oh, they're all dry.

687
00:48:30,219 --> 00:48:32,084
Strawberries.

688
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,400
So cute.

689
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,800
Who are you?

690
00:48:38,684 --> 00:48:40,651
Oh, my head.

691
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:41,975
Awake?

692
00:48:41,975 --> 00:48:45,119
Wake up and come down to eat.

693
00:48:52,851 --> 00:48:54,459
Did you sleep well?

694
00:48:55,051 --> 00:48:57,884
I was going to let you rest.

695
00:48:58,687 --> 00:49:02,451
Since you're awake, eat and
then go back to sleep. I made soup.

696
00:49:02,451 --> 00:49:03,484
Yes.

697
00:49:03,484 --> 00:49:04,618
Come down.

698
00:49:05,584 --> 00:49:06,589
Oh those...

699
00:49:11,684 --> 00:49:12,784
My head hurts.

700
00:49:19,252 --> 00:49:22,418
What? Time went by that fast already?

701
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,600
It's more serious than I thought, Oh Ha Ni.

702
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:40,850
Being like that, will you be able to have a baby and raise it?

703
00:50:46,651 --> 00:50:48,884
Yesterday...

704
00:51:07,506 --> 00:51:08,718
Omo...

705
00:51:08,718 --> 00:51:11,413
Maybe...

706
00:51:11,718 --> 00:51:14,218
The results are this fast?

707
00:51:20,451 --> 00:51:22,357
Oh! Ha Ni, come here.

708
00:51:22,357 --> 00:51:25,279
Since the weather is nice,
we're eating out on the terrace.

709
00:51:25,279 --> 00:51:26,884
Yes.

710
00:51:31,984 --> 00:51:33,418
Alcoholic.

711
00:51:37,618 --> 00:51:42,818
The soup is very good.
I made it especially for you.

712
00:51:43,418 --> 00:51:45,644
Thank you.

713
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,670
Last night, I made a lot of mistakes, didn't I?

714
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:53,084
What do you mean mistakes?
It was so much fun because of you.

715
00:51:54,151 --> 00:51:55,184
I'll eat well.

716
00:51:55,184 --> 00:51:56,451
Eun Jo,

717
00:51:56,451 --> 00:52:04,484
hold on to the jump rope handles tight, jump high,
and let your wrists match a rhythm. 1, 2. 1, 2. Got it?

718
00:52:04,484 --> 00:52:06,451
- So yummy.
- Really?

719
00:52:06,451 --> 00:52:07,951
- Eat a lot.
- Yes.

720
00:52:13,618 --> 00:52:16,984
Instead of rotating your arms, use your wrists.

721
00:52:17,318 --> 00:52:20,917
It's fine. You just eat, alcoholic.

722
00:52:21,517 --> 00:52:22,584
Okay.

723
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:26,551
Aish, I'm not going to do it.

724
00:52:26,551 --> 00:52:29,984
Eun Jo, put your elbows in, like this.

725
00:52:29,984 --> 00:52:32,118
If you know it all, you try it.

726
00:52:47,284 --> 00:52:52,618
Oh my oh my oh my!
Hey, you're really good!

727
00:52:59,287 --> 00:53:00,351
Oh!

728
00:53:02,918 --> 00:53:04,984
You're really good!

729
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:07,418
Oh my, oh my!

730
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:10,418
First, you put your elbows in like this.

731
00:53:10,418 --> 00:53:16,084
Then, you jump with one end of your feet. Since
you're jumping with your whole foot, it doesn't work.

732
00:53:16,084 --> 00:53:17,751
Here, try it.

733
00:53:18,684 --> 00:53:20,084
Come here.

734
00:53:20,418 --> 00:53:21,951
Hurry!

735
00:53:23,084 --> 00:53:23,851
Here.

736
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:28,284
Hold it. Put your elbows in.

737
00:53:31,851 --> 00:53:33,351
Put your elbows in more.

738
00:53:33,851 --> 00:53:34,618
Good.

739
00:53:34,618 --> 00:53:36,484
Oh my, it's working!

740
00:53:37,484 --> 00:53:41,951
That's right. I heard you're taking a musical
jump rope test. Did you choose a song?

741
00:53:41,951 --> 00:53:43,784
I'm going to do "Sunset Glow".

742
00:53:43,784 --> 00:53:46,051
Sunset Glow?

743
00:53:46,851 --> 00:53:49,418
Instead of that, try "Jump Jump Jump".

744
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:02,384
That's fun! Eun Jo, do this one.

745
00:54:04,284 --> 00:54:05,818
Seung Jo!

746
00:54:06,218 --> 00:54:08,184
Isn't Ha Ni really good?

747
00:54:11,718 --> 00:54:13,084
Doing well!

748
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:15,018
Try it.

749
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,800
What is that?

750
00:54:18,251 --> 00:54:19,184
Oh my.

751
00:54:19,396 --> 00:54:20,630
What is it?

752
00:54:23,124 --> 00:54:25,437
It looks like some kind of socks.

753
00:54:25,964 --> 00:54:27,696
Nooo!

754
00:54:33,629 --> 00:54:34,871
Really?

755
00:54:35,463 --> 00:54:37,329
Do they really turn on the air conditioning?

756
00:54:37,329 --> 00:54:38,369
Yeah.

757
00:54:38,369 --> 00:54:40,129
It's really cold.

758
00:54:40,129 --> 00:54:41,784
I was wearing long sleeves.

759
00:54:42,096 --> 00:54:44,234
- And everyone gets a computer?
- Yeah.

760
00:54:44,234 --> 00:54:48,829
The Internet is super fast. It would
be nice to play games on there.

761
00:54:49,796 --> 00:54:51,304
Ha Ni.

762
00:54:54,718 --> 00:54:56,490
Are you rolling your hair?

763
00:54:57,784 --> 00:55:01,251
Did you eat yet? Today they had your favorite.

764
00:55:01,251 --> 00:55:02,584
I ate already.

765
00:55:02,584 --> 00:55:04,251
Doesn't that punk come on
to you in the Special Study Hall?

766
00:55:04,251 --> 00:55:06,384
You're the one who comes on to her.

767
00:55:06,384 --> 00:55:08,348
Stop it, you little...

768
00:55:09,784 --> 00:55:10,951
Joon Gu,

769
00:55:10,951 --> 00:55:12,884
will you get me that book over there?

770
00:55:13,357 --> 00:55:14,455
Okay, okay, I got it.

771
00:55:15,509 --> 00:55:16,651
Move!

772
00:55:17,351 --> 00:55:20,118
Now you're studying more!

773
00:55:20,118 --> 00:55:21,151
Thank you.

774
00:55:26,418 --> 00:55:27,528
Something fell out.

775
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,000
What is it?

776
00:55:48,484 --> 00:55:49,751
What?

777
00:55:50,618 --> 00:55:51,984
What is it?

778
00:56:03,184 --> 00:56:04,084
Hey!

779
00:56:04,084 --> 00:56:05,451
Oh Ha Ni,

780
00:56:05,451 --> 00:56:06,818
what is this?

781
00:56:06,818 --> 00:56:09,551
Why are you sleeping with Baek Seung Jo?

782
00:56:15,418 --> 00:56:19,018
No, that, we're not sleeping together...

783
00:56:45,951 --> 00:56:48,218
Oh Ha Ni!

784
00:56:49,484 --> 00:56:50,984
What? Are they living together?

785
00:56:50,984 --> 00:56:52,184
With Baek Seung Jo?!

786
00:56:52,184 --> 00:56:54,918
What's going on?
Maybe it's Photoshopped?

787
00:56:54,918 --> 00:56:56,251
No way!

788
00:57:06,118 --> 00:57:07,318
Ha Ni sunbae!

789
00:57:13,151 --> 00:57:14,918
What's up with this?

790
00:57:15,651 --> 00:57:21,819
- Weren't Ha Ni and Joon Gu dating?
- Then, what's up with Baek Seung Jo?

791
00:57:21,819 --> 00:57:25,451
- Poor Joon Gu.
- What will Joon Gu do?

792
00:57:27,851 --> 00:57:28,784
House!

793
00:57:28,784 --> 00:57:31,451
You're living in the same
house as Baek Seung Jo?!

794
00:57:35,451 --> 00:57:36,618
Hey, hey, hey!

795
00:57:36,618 --> 00:57:41,251
How's Baek Seung Jo's house? I heard he's really rich. It's really big, isn't it? It's super nice, isn't it?

796
00:57:41,251 --> 00:57:44,051
Your room? How's your room?

797
00:57:44,518 --> 00:57:45,818
I like it.

798
00:57:48,651 --> 00:57:51,218
I'm completely curious.

799
00:57:51,918 --> 00:57:53,818
Completely.

800
00:57:54,384 --> 00:57:55,351
Hey!

801
00:57:55,351 --> 00:57:56,418
You guys are trying to come over, aren't you?

802
00:57:56,418 --> 00:58:00,351
No! Definitely not! Definitely not!

803
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:02,251
- Why?
- Definitely not!

804
00:58:04,184 --> 00:58:06,051
Oh, how embarrassing.

805
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:11,018
This can't be.

806
00:58:51,284 --> 00:58:53,418
Aaaah
Oh Ha Ni.

807
00:59:25,651 --> 00:59:26,884
Where?

808
00:59:30,851 --> 00:59:32,418
Hey, Baek Eun Jo!

809
00:59:34,184 --> 00:59:35,551
He's drowning!

810
00:59:38,051 --> 00:59:39,184
Do you want some water?

811
00:59:40,951 --> 00:59:42,984
You came all the way here because of Oh Ha Ni?

812
00:59:42,984 --> 00:59:45,118
- Of course!
- Okay.

813
00:59:45,118 --> 00:59:47,118
You guys look good together, you and Oh Ha Ni.

814
00:59:50,084 --> 00:59:51,484
I can't do this.

815
00:59:52,284 --> 00:59:52,818
Yes?

816
00:59:55,684 --> 00:59:56,451
Hello.

817
00:59:56,451 --> 00:59:58,018
I don't know how to solve this problem.

818
00:59:58,018 --> 00:59:58,818
No.

819
00:59:58,818 --> 01:00:00,418
Just this one.

820
01:00:00,418 --> 01:00:02,018
You're going to sleep?

821
01:00:02,784 --> 01:00:04,451
I'm sorry.

822
01:00:04,451 --> 01:00:05,384
Hey!

823
