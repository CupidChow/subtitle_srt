12
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,950
Y-You!

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,833
Why did you come out of that house?

14
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,200
Because it's my house.

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,748
- You said it's your...
- Baek Seung Jo, why aren't you coming in?

16
00:00:55,748 --> 00:00:58,967
Ha Ni, come in quickly.

17
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:07,900
Should I carry that?

18
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,970
Ah, I remember now. Even if you're homeless,

19
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,160
you don't want my help.

20
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,567
Oh Seung Jo, come here.

21
00:01:34,922 --> 00:01:37,367
- Hello.
- He's our eldest.

22
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:43,100
I've heard so much already.

23
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,830
I feel like we've been together for so long.

24
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:50,967
After watching the news, she's the one who wanted to look for you guys.

25
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:53,300
- So we could live together.
- Really?

26
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,430
So I immediately called the broadcasting station.

27
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,567
Oh, really? Thank you.

28
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:02,700
He would always tell me that he was indebted to you and that he had

29
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,460
to pay you back some day.

30
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:07,567
Oh, there's no need to...

31
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:09,567
But, what took you so long?

32
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:18,433
Don't you two know each other? Both of you are in the same year.

33
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:21,978
Ah well, he's already pretty well known.

34
00:02:21,978 --> 00:02:25,100
I guess. He is pretty good at studying.

35
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,630
But, the others

36
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,533
- don't like him, do they?
- What?

37
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:35,620
His personality is a little weird. Always arrogant and looking down.

38
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,300
Look at him now.

39
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,832
He doesn't have any girls, does he?

40
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:44,932
Well...

41
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:48,867
Baek Eun Jo, you haven't slept yet?

42
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:51,700
- I was studying.
- Why?

43
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,967
Then you might become like your brother.

44
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,900
Say hello. He's our second child.

45
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,500
A bit young, isn't he?

46
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,900
He's in fourth grade.

47
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,433
Hello, I am Baek Eun Jo.

48
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:06,770
He's quite good looking.

49
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,030
He must've got it from his mother.

50
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:11,900
You must be so lucky.

51
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,433
Really? Say hello to noona, too.

52
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:18,467
Ha Ni Noona. Oh Ha Ni.

53
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:20,067
Hi.

54
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,000
- You're not greeting her?
- I don't want to.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,535
- Why?
- She looks dumb.

56
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,769
- I'm sorry. He must be going through puberty.
- No, it's okay.

57
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:37,702
Why would she be dumb? She's very good at studying.

58
00:03:37,702 --> 00:03:40,669
Really? Then...

59
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:43,135
What does that mean?

60
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,702
It's Chinese.

61
00:03:46,702 --> 00:03:50,069
I see you're studying Chinese characters. Let's see.

[Chinese Ideograms - 6th Year]

64
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,969
This is for sixth grade.

65
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,235
"Han Woo Choong Dong." You don't know what it means?

66
00:04:08,235 --> 00:04:12,035
That's right! "Han Woo Choong Dong"...

67
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:14,335
The meaning of this...

68
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:16,469
What?

69
00:04:17,397 --> 00:04:19,035
What?

70
00:04:19,035 --> 00:04:20,869
So,

71
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,760
"Han Woo" (Korean beef).

72
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,100
You know how Korean beef is tasty, but is really expensive?

73
00:04:32,102 --> 00:04:36,740
So, you have no money... you have no pocket money, but...

74
00:04:37,515 --> 00:04:39,402
"Choong Dong" (urge).

75
00:04:39,402 --> 00:04:41,720
You have an urge to eat Korean beef.

76
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,760
So in other words, you want something beyond your means.

77
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,502
That's it.

78
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,602
Is that true? It means you have the urge to eat Korean beef?

79
00:04:54,602 --> 00:04:56,969
"Han" means sweaty. "Woo" means cow.

80
00:04:56,969 --> 00:05:00,280
То make an ox sweat by pulling the wagon with the books,

81
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,860
or to fill a house to the rafters with books.

82
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,535
In other words, it means "an immense number of books."

83
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,369
Aren't you stupid?

84
00:05:11,369 --> 00:05:15,200
Baek Eun Jo, you have no manners. Hurry and apologize.

85
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,170
I don't want to. I won't.

86
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,760
I hate stupid people the most.

87

89
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,730

Yes.

- You don't like it?
- No.

94
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,800
It's so pretty. It's like a princess' bedroom.

95
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,600
Right?

96
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,300
This is also a princess' bed.

97
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,700
Hurry and try it out.

98
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,500
You know, I had so much
fun decorating this room!

99
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:52,200
I really wanted to have a daughter so badly.

100
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,300
Decorating a room like this together and sharing pretty things.

And when she's older, to travel together.

102
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,070
However, I could only give birth to boys,

103
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,100
so it's been really boring.

104
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,150
Let's go shopping and

105
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,430

106
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes.

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,300
It's going to be so much fun!

108
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,500
Ah, also...

109
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,700
Here, a gift.

110
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,420
Since you lost your house, you must have no shoes left. Am I right?

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,800
Try them on.

112
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,500
It's pretty...

113
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,500
I'm causing you so much trouble that I don't know what to do.

114
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,900
Eh! What trouble?

115
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,500
I was very happy to buy this.

116
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,200
Is the size a bit too big?

117
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,400
No, it is very comfortable. I really like it.

118
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,600
Thank you.

119
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,100

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,800
Oh! You brought it?

122
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,120
Good. Now, you must be very tired.

123
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,000
Have a good rest, okay?

124
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,100
Yes... I'm very grateful for everything.

125
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,900
- I'll see you tomorrow morning!
- Yes.

- Good night!
- Yes.

127

Seung Jo, good night!

128
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,600
This room was originally... Eun Jo's room.

129
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,900
But thanks to someone here...

130
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,600
Eun Jo's bed and desk... My room is so crammed.

131
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,400
- I'm sorry.
- If you're sorry...

132
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,600
shouldn't you stop it now?

133
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,600
You've been annoying these past few days.

134
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,000
- I'm telling you not to make a big fuss at school.
- Make a big fuss?

135
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,100
Don't worry. If the news of us living together gets out,

136
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,500
I'll be more affected by it than you.

137
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,300
What do you mean "living together"?

138
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,600
Were not you the one who came to live in my house?

139
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,700
I'm going to wash up first.

140
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,500
You're dead!

141
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,400
You made me bleed.

142
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,900
I regret it.

143
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,200
I didn't think of going so far.

144
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,300
However, I can't help it either.

145
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,140
Ahhh! That stupid jerk!

146
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,800
Damn it, damn it! Really!

147
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,400
I really hate smart guys like you!

148
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,100
Really? So embarrassing!

149
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,800
Ah! Why did he show up right then!

150
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,720
All right.

151
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,700
The toilet seat is warm.

152
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,700
What do I do?

153
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,500
To be so close we're
using the same bathroom!

154
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,800
Did he hear me?

155
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,100
He's right next door.

156
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,300
Ah my tummy hurts!

157
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,500
I can't even poop because
I'm scared I might make a sound.

158
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,900
They seem really close!

159
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,000
Aigoo, Oh Ha Ni.

160
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,800
You're still not back to your senses?

161
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,700
He said he doesn't like you.
He told you not to bother him.

162
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,830
Here you go.

163
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,100
I can't believe it!
I'm having breakfast with Baek Seung Jo!

164
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,400

332
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,560
Here you go.

333
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,900
Why didn't you guys come back together?

334
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,700
I'm sure she'll be here soon.

335
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,900
She's not very familar with the place yet.

336
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,600
Recently, there's been strange people
around this neighborhood.

337
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,500
Oh Ha Ni is the strangest person here.

338
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,300
You come over here!

339
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,500
Hm! Come over here,
you need a spanking!

340
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,200
Hey! Baek Eun Jo.

341
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,800
Man, what a bother!

342
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
That cheapskate...

343
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,400
He left even though I told
him to wait for me.

344
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,000
I even took a taxi.

345
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,300
Man, I should've just asked the
taxi driver to drive me all the way home.

346
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,000
Made me spend all my allowance.

347
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,100
Don't do it!

348
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,400
Don't do it!

349
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,300
If you open it, I won't look!

350
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,800
I'm going to close my eyes.

351
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,500
Then it wouldn't matter.

352
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,200
Pervert! Pervert!
Stop it! Stop it!

353
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,500
No, you can't!

354
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,100
That was a present.

355
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,600
Mister!

356
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
Hurry up and give it to me!

357
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,400
I said that was a present!

358
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,300
It's not like you're going to wear it!

359
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,400
Without closing your eyes!
It's only going to take a second!

360
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,600
Really it's just once, right?

361
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,800
Really just once.

362
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,300
Then you'll give me my shoe back?

363
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,000
Of course, I'll return it.
How would I use this?

364
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,700
Fine.

365
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,300
Fine?...

366
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,200
You said you're fine with it?

367
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,900
Since you asked nicely...

368
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,700
...but you MUST return the shoe to me.

369
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:08,200
Of course, very well.
I'm a person who keeps his promises.

370
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,300
You...

371
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,600
...you can't close your eyes because then that's cheating.

372
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,500
Okay.

373
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,200
I'm a person who keeps her promises too.

374
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,680
Alright.

375
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,200
Okay.

376
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,900
Wait a second!

377
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,800
What?

378
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,500
Let me prepare myself.

379
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,800
Fine. Then prepare yourself.

380
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,800
Preparing for that long isn't good.

381
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,100
Let's do it!

382
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,200
1...

383
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,900
2...

384
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,300
3...

385
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,200
Sir. Forgive me! Just this once?

386
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,700
Please forgive me, just this once?

387
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,600
I just started doing this.

388
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,700
I've registered on a forum and
it's only my second time on the field.

389
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:38,200
Please don't report me,
I have a family......and I have a kid.

390
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:43,300
Just this once, if you forgive me
I swear it will never happen again. Sir, eh?

391
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,600
Then go straight home right now.

392
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,500
Thank you, Sir!

393
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,400
What the?

394
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,400
What?

395
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,600
You shouldn't take this with you.

396
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,500
You're right.

397
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,200
Goodbye.

398
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,600
Were you looking for me?

399
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,600
Because you were worried?

400
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,210
As if!

401
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,600
I bought this.

402
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,100
But how did you come right on time?

403
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,000
It was because of my bad luck.

404
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,600
Anyway, you...

405
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,400
In a situation like that, people would
give up the shoe. How could...

406
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,400
Because they were a
present from your mom.

407
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Yeah, but still...

408
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,000
What did you buy?

409
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,300
Ah! It looks good.

410
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,900
Can I have some?

411
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,200
My throat is parched from the run.

412
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,100
It's melted.

413
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,000
Is it cause of the heat?

414
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,700
Hey! Is that the Big Dipper?
One, two...

415
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,600
Hey, can you hear those crickets crying?

416
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,900
They're not crying.

417
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:48,900
♪ I want to be with you always,
accept my feelings ♪

418
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:53,400
♪ Give me a kiss ♪

419
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,600
Stupid girls...

420
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,200
...even if they have good taste,

421
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
I hate them.

422
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,000
Come to your senses, Oh Ha Ni.

423
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,900
Don't you have any pride?

424
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,800
Right.

425
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,400
Let's study!

426
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,600
Let's study and show them how it's done.

427
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,200
Math. Let's start with math.

428
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,400
Okay...

429
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,000
It's the global age, so let's start with English.

430
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,500
Aigoo!

431
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,400
Let's start with our native language (Korean).

432
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,400
Ugh! What is this talking about?

433
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,500
I don't get it!

434
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,200
I don't know!

435
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,500
I've learned all of this?

436
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,000
There's no way...

437
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,200
Yes?

438
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,700
Ah

439
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,300
Here. Have this to eat.

440
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,600
Thank you!

441
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,300
Come on in.

442
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,500
You're studying hard.

443
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,100
Hehe. I'm just sitting around.

444
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,600
Make sure you take breaks in between.

445
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,800
I've always wanted to do something like this.

446
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,700
Making late night snacks and saying
that you should take breaks while studying.

447
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,600
Now I feel like the mother
of a high school senior.

448
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,200
Seung Jo doesn't eat late night snacks?

449
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,010
It's not that, but rather Seung Jo doesn't study at all.

450
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,500
He doesn't study?

451
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,200
He's already sleeping.

452
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,700
But he always gets perfect scores.

453
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,810
He must be a real genius.

454
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,900
Really?

455
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,100
Is that so? What's the use of getting perfect scores?

456
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,500
He's no fun at all.

457
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,300
Do you have a blog?

458
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,500
Of course! I'm a power blogger.

459
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,200
Ehh! You have 160 comments!

460
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,900
Oh! It's Eun Jo!

461
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,500
Eun Jo is lacking in manners, isn't he?

462
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,600
He likes his older brother so much
that he takes after him.

463
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,000
Still, he's cute.

464
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
He looks a lot like Seung Jo.

465
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,400
I think you probably looked pretty
when you were a child as well.

466
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,900
Don't you have an album?
Aw, come on, let's see.

467
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,800
I don't have a lot of pictures.

468
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,400
Aww, how pretty!

469
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,200
Aww!

470
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,200
Your mother?

471
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,900
Oh, she's gorgeous.

472
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,500
That's why you're pretty.

473
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,100
To tell you the truth,
I don't really remember her.

474
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,300
They say she passed away
when I was four years old.

475
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,800
That's why I look at this sometimes,
so I don't forget her.

476
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,800
There's a comment on every picture.

477
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,300
Hey, this is interesting.

478
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,500
"Summer. Maybe because we didn't
have an air conditioner, it was even cooler."

479
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,100
Hey, you are so witty.
Did you write this?

480
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,700
- Yes.
- Aww!

481
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,600
"Bbomi is really light."

482
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,700
"Even something light becomes
heavy after holding it for a while."

483
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,800
"Everything in life seems
to be the same way."

484
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,300
Aww, you're cute.

485
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,500
Seung Jo was also cute, right?
When he was little?

486
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,500
Yeah, well...

487
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,600
Ah! Ha Ni!

488
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,600
Would you like me to
show you something fun?

489
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,000
Aww! She's so cute, she's so pretty!

490
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,800
Who is this?

491
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,900
She looks a lot like Seung Jo.

492
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,700
Really?

493
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,200
Yes.

494
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,400
Like this here...
it's exactly the same.

495
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,700
It's Seung Jo. What!?

496
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,000
This is Seung Jo.

497
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,200
Wait a minute.

498
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,700
Where was it?

499
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,500
Hold on.

500
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,000
Look here.

501
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,600
When I was pregnant with Seung Jo,

502
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,300
he was very calm inside my belly.

503
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:35,300
He only wanted to eat
watermelon, strawberries, and grapes.

504
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,500
So I really thought it was a girl.

505
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,000
That's why the shoes, clothes, and
toys that I bought were all for a girl.

506
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,100
But it was a boy.

507
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,400
So what to do? Do I throw it all away?

508
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,000
That's true, but...

509
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,200
And didn't I tell you...

510
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,900
...that I really wanted a girl?

511
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:59,000
That's why I raised him as a girl
for just a little while.

512
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,300
But...

513
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:04,500
We went to the swimming pool
and he was exposed.

514
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,500
He must have have
been scarred at that time.

515
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,800
That's why I wonder if he's
become so cold as a result of that.

516
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,600
Seung Jo thinks I burnt all of this.

517
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,000
But what can I do, when I have
the photo negatives right here?

518
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,900
When you look at it this way,
he's not even a genius.

519
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,900
Hey!

520
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,800
What is this?
Why do you keep laughing? (ooseo = laugh)

521
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,000
Me?! I'm scary?
(mooseo)

522
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,600
Yeah! Scary.

523
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,000
Really? I wonder why?

524
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,600
It's not a reaction from constipation?

525
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,800
Oh! Baek Seung Jo?

526
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,300
What's he doing here?

527
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,500
Who are you looking for?

528
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,000
Oh Ha Ni, get your P.E. uniform
and come with me.

529
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,100
P.E. uniform?!

530
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,600
Why?

531
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,300
Okay.

532
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:10,200
Hey! What's going on? Why was Baek Seung Jo looking for you?

533
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,700
P.E. uniform?

534
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,170
[Beak Seung Jo]

535
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,510
[Beak Seung Jo]

536
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,600
It looks like they're
exchanging something.

537
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,500
Isn't it the P.E. uniform?

538
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,600
Ahhh, this is really annoying!

539
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,600
Why? You could have just worn it.

540
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,900
What?!

541
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:01,000
So what if you wear girls' clothing?
You're already familiar with it.

542
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,300
Hey! Where did you
find this?! Give it to me!

543
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,810
What is this?!

544
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:20,400
Woah,

545
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,000
Oh Ha Ni.

546
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,400
What going on?! What are they doing?!

547
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,600
What's going on? Ha?

548
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,400
Oh! Seriously, that jerk!

549
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,400
Aah! Let go! Ha Ni!

550
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,700
Hey! Aren't you gonna
give it to me?!

551
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,600
Hey...Hey.

552
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,100
Hey!

553
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:51,200
Wait a second, I'll give it to you.

554
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,500
I have a condition.

555
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,700
Condition?

556
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,800
What condition?

557
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,600
Help me with my studies.

558
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,300
Help me raise my grades
on the next exam.

559
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,600
You're saying this knowing there's
only one week until the exam?

560
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,100
Of course I know.

561
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,700
Please help me.

562
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,100
Please help me get into the study hall.

563
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,700
Do you see me as someone
who can create miracles?

564
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,800
I'm not a god!

565
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,600
I understand.

566
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,700
Guys!

567
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,900
Hey!

568
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,600
Oh Ha Ni!

569
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,000
You're trickier than
I thought you were.

570
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,800
I said that if you get into the study hall,
I'd carry you on my back.

571
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,600
Now you want me to help you study,

572
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,700
and give you a piggyback ride too?

573
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,900
If you help me, that becomes void.

574
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,600
Do you think I'm that petty?

575
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,100
Don't worry! I don't have
any feelings for you anymore.

576
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:02,500
Not even this little.

577
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,900
Really?

578
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,100
Hey!

579
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,300
Ahhh...ahh seriously!

580
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:26,500
♪ I want to be with you always,
accept my feelings ♪

581
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,700
♪ Give me a kiss ♪

582
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,400
Ahh. This is so good.

583
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,600
Thanks to you, we ate so well.

584
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:50,900
I just brought over what
was left at the restaurant.

585
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:55,100
But this! This! It's really delicious! Is it Kkotjeon?

586
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,900
It's Hapkkotjeon! The seafood smells very good.

587
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,100
Ahh, yes. Thank you.

588
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,000
Ha Ni, what would you like
for your late night snack?

589
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,600
Eh?

590
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,700
Ha Ni.

591
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,700
Starting today, please prepare for two.

592
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,300
Oh, why?

593
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,100
Are you going to study too?

594
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:21,300
It can't be anything too greasy or too sweet.
It'll be bad for her memory.

595
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,600
Wheat bread and olive oil should be enough.

596
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,600
And egg yolk too.

597
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,500
Oh. Okay.

598
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,700
I'll get up first.

599
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,700
Hyung! Teach m­­---

600
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,100
You do it with me.

601
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,800
I'll get going.

602
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,400
I'll get going.

603
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:06,640
Hey,Oh Ha Ni.

604
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,700
Something easy like this ,you don't even know this?

605
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,400
You don't even know this?

606
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,400
What are you doing?

607
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,000
Baby Baek Seung Jo!

608
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Oh Ha Ni!

609
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,200
Whatever,

610
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:28,200
Then I'll start by explaining the basics
completely, so listen well.

611
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,030
First, use "x" as the number
you want to determine.

612
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,170
What is '' x '' ?

613
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:36,250
Huh?

614
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,600
I said ,what is ''x''?

615
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,000
Alphabet!

616
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,700
I don't know.What is it?

617
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:51,600
What is it?

618
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,200
What are the unsolved cases called?

619
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,900
X filed?

620
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:59,000
What did we call the younger
generation when we were kids?

621
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,700
_X_ generational .

622
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:07,000
We are looking for generation.The difficult unsolved cases.

623
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,700
But, why is it "x"...

624
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,600
...when there's "w" and "h"?

625
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,200
What's the use of
discussing the "what ifs"?

626
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,300
It's already been decided.

627
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,100
Here,

628
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:25,100
X equals 2 to the 30th power
times 10 to the negative 7th power.

629
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:30,140
log(x) = log (2^30 * 10^-7)

630
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:34,700
Log x=(2...

631
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:38,890
log(x) = 30log2 - 7log10
log(x)=30*0.3-7

632
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:44,100
Logx=30*0/3-7

633
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:50,000
log(x) = 2.
So, x = 100.

634
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,900
But since we're supposed to write
this as a binary number, what is it?

635
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,100
What is 100 as a binary number?

636
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,800
Calculate it.

637
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,700
What does that mean?

638
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,000
I feel like I'm going to explode.

639
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:15,800
Yah!

640
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,300
Omo!

641
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:32,700
That Oh Ha Ni, so stupid and dumb.

642
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:47,200
Do you know what the decimal system is?

643
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,500
Yeah.

644
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:52,800
10
20
30

645
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,000
Then how about the binary numeral system?

646
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,300
It's a way to express a number using only 0 and 1.

647
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:05,000
But why?

648
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,900
The computer.

649
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,700
Computer?

650
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:18,800
In 1974, from the Arecibo Observatory,
a message was sent to outer space.

651
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,900
If there were real aliens out there,
they would receive the message and respond.

652
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,600
But in what language
could the message be sent?

653
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,800
In English?

654
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,600
We don't know what the level of
intelligence of the aliens could be,

655
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:35,500
so in order for them to decipher the
message by simply knowing 0 and 1,

656
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,500
the message was sent in binary code.

657
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,100
Oh. Ohhh!

658
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:44,600
In order to communicate with aliens,
I should learn the binary system.
This is a must learn.
Put a star next to this.

659
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,800
Then, what is the way to change
100 to the binary numeral system?

660
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,700
Then,

661
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:53,500
did we receive a response from the aliens?

662
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,100
So far, not yet.

663
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,900
But then again, the universe is so huge.

664
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:05,900
Because the universe is so big,
the log system was developed.

665
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,900
Really?

666
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:13,700
Log was made to express really big things.

667
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,400
Why don't you just give up?

668
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,000
Why?

669
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,830

Si Won, Kang In, Shin Dong,
Kyuhyun, Han Kyung, Ki Bum...

We just have different fields of interest.

676
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,500
So, what about logarithms?

677
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,600
As shown in my electroencephalogram,
even when I'm sleeping, my alpha waves are moving.

678
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:09,500
I can read 7000 words per minute;
I also have an excellent memory.

679

When you breathe, put strength on your
belly button and inhale slowly...

680
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:19,700
...and slowly exhale.
Your eyes should be focused on the dot.

681
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,400
Not the wall!

682
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,900

683

Until you can only see the dot.

while memorizing to retain knowledge.

Where did she go?

702
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,200
She went home. She said she needs to study.

703

See, see, see!
What kind of studying would she do?

704
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,500

Surely...
