1
00:02:06,912 --> 00:02:09,065
That's right

2
00:02:10,178 --> 00:02:14,251
I spent the whole night with Seung Jo.

3
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:34,265
It's time to wake up.

4
00:02:38,932 --> 00:02:40,398
Did you sleep well?

5
00:02:42,232 --> 00:02:43,321
Good morning.

6
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:48,847
It was a disaster sleeping with you last night.

7
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:50,312
Why?

8
00:02:50,312 --> 00:02:52,609
Because of your terrible sleeping habits.

9
00:02:52,813 --> 00:02:57,332
What are you talking about? I'm a totally still sleeper.

10
00:02:59,632 --> 00:03:01,247
Stop kidding me.

11
00:03:33,265 --> 00:03:34,315
Wear this one.

12
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:35,251
I don't want to.

13
00:03:50,032 --> 00:03:51,932
Are you just going to stare at me like that?

14
00:03:53,063 --> 00:03:54,165
Ah, sorry...

15
00:04:16,032 --> 00:04:17,965
You act like it's your own home.

16
00:04:18,065 --> 00:04:19,114
Really?

17
00:04:19,732 --> 00:04:20,577
Is that so?

18
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,331
en español

19
00:04:28,565 --> 00:04:31,698
it feels different when I'm staying in Seung Jo's apartment.

20
00:04:31,698 --> 00:04:35,298
It feels like we're living together.

21
00:04:42,065 --> 00:04:44,198
What kind of fantasy are you having now?

22
00:04:45,098 --> 00:04:46,798
Don't overdo it.

23
00:04:56,665 --> 00:05:02,632
It was never turned off before.

24
00:05:03,865 --> 00:05:05,365
What's the matter?

25
00:05:20,432 --> 00:05:24,998
" Oh Han Ni and Baek Seung Jo spent the night together"
Did they really spend the night together?

26
00:05:25,198 --> 00:05:26,965
You know that girl from the tennis club.

27
00:05:26,965 --> 00:05:28,532
Oh her?

28
00:05:29,232 --> 00:05:34,130
Hey! Baek Seung Jo! Since when did you.....?
Lucky you

29
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,992
Tell us, tell us the details. So how was it?

30
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,598
I said to give us some details.

31
00:05:53,065 --> 00:05:54,065
Mother!

32
00:05:54,365 --> 00:05:56,514
What's your problem?

33
00:05:56,514 --> 00:05:57,229
Why are you calling me "Mother"? You're embar . . .

34
00:05:57,229 --> 00:05:58,165
Mother!

35
00:06:00,565 --> 00:06:05,132
How can you tell so quickly?
The way you disguise yourself so that
one can tell in one look...
The way you disguise yourself so that
one can tell in one look...

36
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:07,165
please do something about it!

37
00:06:13,398 --> 00:06:16,665
Ha Ni, how are you feeling, after being sick and all?

38
00:06:16,665 --> 00:06:18,498
I'm alright now.

39
00:06:18,498 --> 00:06:20,532
Really? That's a relief.

40
00:06:22,232 --> 00:06:24,798
Alright...So how was it?

41
00:06:24,798 --> 00:06:25,332
Huh?

42
00:06:25,332 --> 00:06:27,232
How was it...?

43
00:06:28,565 --> 00:06:32,865
It was nothing special.

44
00:06:32,865 --> 00:06:35,698
Ah...really?

45
00:06:36,265 --> 00:06:40,432
Seung Jo is that type of man? That's unbelievable.

46
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,465
Oh yes! Ha Ni, did you give him the chocolates?

47
00:06:43,465 --> 00:06:48,065
Right!, the chocolates!
The chocolates..

48
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:51,432
I lost the chocolates!

49
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:53,398
What do you mean you "lost" them?

50
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:55,232
It is a sign of love.

51
00:06:55,232 --> 00:06:56,365
Where did it go?

52
00:06:57,798 --> 00:07:01,598
What to do? Baek Seung Jo's chocolates!

53
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:07,625
Do you see me volumizing the ends?! Isn't it off the hook! I'm really good at it!

54
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:11,198
I'll make sure your hair isn't damaged and-- Welcome!

55
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:16,965
Bong Joon Gu...

56
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,232
What? Slept together?

57
00:07:22,332 --> 00:07:24,498
Baek Seung Jo and Oh Ha Ni?

58
00:07:25,465 --> 00:07:30,965
When I spoke to Ha Ni not long ago she didn't tell me anything like that.

59
00:07:30,965 --> 00:07:36,032
There is no way Ha Ni won't tell me the big news.

60
00:07:36,032 --> 00:07:41,298
From a kiss to sleeping together...that's great!

61
00:07:43,732 --> 00:07:46,432
Now everything is over. It's over.

62
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,432
Ah... Joon Gu... Joon... Bong Joon G...

63
00:07:49,832 --> 00:07:51,798
Nothing happened you said?

64
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:53,184
Yeah...

65
00:07:54,265 --> 00:08:00,365
A man and a woman spent a whole night together,
How is it that nothing happened?

66
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,532
Nothing happened.

67
00:08:13,198 --> 00:08:14,485
Can I tell her?
Jung Ju Ri

68
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,065
You're early today.

69
00:08:29,132 --> 00:08:31,832
The school's a bit talkative today.

70
00:08:33,732 --> 00:08:35,798
You know nothing happened.

71
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:40,098
True..

72
00:08:42,598 --> 00:08:44,032
There is no way.

73
00:08:46,932 --> 00:08:47,965
Seung Jo...

74
00:08:48,465 --> 00:08:51,465
Do you want to get dinner together after class?

75
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,232
It's raining....

76
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,521
Aigoo. Why is it raining like this?

77
00:09:03,521 --> 00:09:05,945
Oh! Really.

78
00:09:07,036 --> 00:09:11,037
Oh, aren't you the one who works at the restaurant?

79
00:09:11,037 --> 00:09:14,698
Oh right! What are you doing here? Are you waiting for someone?

80
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:20,003
Looks like you're not in a good mood.

81
00:09:20,003 --> 00:09:22,793
It's not that I'm in a bad mood.

82
00:09:22,793 --> 00:09:25,173
I am trying to give up my love

83
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:27,695
My heart feels like it's breaking apart.

84
00:09:27,695 --> 00:09:28,866
What do you mean give up on love?

85
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:30,631
You shouldn't give up on love.

86
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:32,671
No, certainly not.

87
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,732
I've only been following for the past few years.

88
00:09:34,732 --> 00:09:36,775
I never even went on a date with her.

89
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:38,754
This is a very serious matter.

90
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,000
Have you tried confessing your feelings?

91
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:45,994
Confessing?

92
00:09:45,994 --> 00:09:47,814
Oh, so you don't know how to confess.

93
00:09:47,814 --> 00:09:49,700
Look

94
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,161
This is how you do it.

95
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,300
You grab the girl like this.

96
00:09:55,073 --> 00:09:58,834
You pull her like this,

97
00:09:58,834 --> 00:10:02,201
push her up against a wall, and when she looks up,

98
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,259
then you say,

99
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:06,883
" If you can forget me then go ahead," and suddenly kiss her.

100
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,417
If you do it like this

101
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:10,344
the girl won't even be able to think

102
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:11,591
When they're flustered,

103
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:13,547
they'll suddenly have feelings for you!

104
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,900
That's how you confess.

105
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,300
That's right! A confession.

106
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,600
I won't die from it, so

107
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,500
let's try it.

108
00:10:21,565 --> 00:10:23,973
Hyung-nim, thank you!

109
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,200
Oh right!

110
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,474
Timing is very important thing, timing!

111
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:37,732
Fine, I've made a decision. I'm only going to study for English.

112
00:10:38,732 --> 00:10:39,732
Only English?

113
00:10:39,732 --> 00:10:47,898
It's the only subject I'm taking with Seung Jo, so if I fail that as well, then it's all over.

114
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:52,332
No matter what I get on the other subjects, I'm definitely going to pass English.

115
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:55,165
Oh Ha Ni, you are now in study mode.

116
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,950
Ha Ni, you're here!

117
00:12:30,164 --> 00:12:32,482
Your face doesn't look good.

118
00:12:32,997 --> 00:12:35,933
Even when it's exam week,

119
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:38,355
you two look fine.

120
00:12:38,355 --> 00:12:39,652
Usually,

121
00:12:39,652 --> 00:12:42,606
you're supposed to take tests with your every day capabilities.

122
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,300
If you try to study it all at once, then how could they test what you've learned?

123
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,500
You won't remember it for the test anyway

124
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,941
Isn't that right Seung Jo?

125
00:12:51,941 --> 00:12:53,380
How did you do on the other tests?

126
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,888
So so.

127
00:12:56,903 --> 00:12:59,928
I will really do my best on the test, so that we can

128
00:12:59,928 --> 00:13:02,111
attend the same class next semester together...

129
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:05,383
This English test is famous for being hard. What are you going to do?

130
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:09,866
Weren't you hitting it pretty close in the last test too?

131
00:13:10,652 --> 00:13:12,290
Ha Ni,

132
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:17,320
it would be better if you attend this same class for another year.

133
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,597
You know that girl you saw before,

134
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:21,987
Ji Yeon, who Seung Jo and I were tutoring.

135
00:13:21,987 --> 00:13:23,961
She's going to be attending our school.

136
00:13:24,643 --> 00:13:27,421
How about you attend the same class next year?

137
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,781
Ha Ni,

138
00:13:30,781 --> 00:13:32,831
why are you glaring at me like that?

139
00:13:32,831 --> 00:13:35,014
Your eyes will burst.

140
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:57,258
This is the first time

141
00:13:57,258 --> 00:13:59,441
I'm taking a test together with Seung Jo.

142
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:04,085
Seung Jo looks greatest when he is solving questions.

143
00:14:25,884 --> 00:14:27,625
Why are you not finishing?

144
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,019
I'm done.

145
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:32,130
There is still 40 minutes left! Already?

146
00:14:34,002 --> 00:14:36,704
Seung Jo, wait for a second.
Let's go out together.

147
00:14:40,522 --> 00:14:43,715
It was surprisingly easy, right?

148
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:47,409
Oh, you didn't even write anything! What are you going to do?

149
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:19,408
I came because

150
00:15:19,408 --> 00:15:21,190
I have something to tell you.

151
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,619
Oh, really?

152
00:15:23,619 --> 00:15:25,539
What is it?

153
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:27,427
Even if you don't tell me anything,

154
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,564
I know everything.

155
00:15:31,334 --> 00:15:35,415
You probably don't know how much my heart ached that night.

156
00:15:36,444 --> 00:15:40,965
But no matter how much I thought about it, it didn't seem right.

157
00:15:42,465 --> 00:15:44,503
To be honest,

158
00:15:44,503 --> 00:15:47,216
I can't bring myself

159
00:15:47,216 --> 00:15:50,810
to give up on you Ha Ni.

160
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,002
But still,

161
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:05,346
once a guy pulls out his sword, he's got to see it till the very end.

162
00:16:07,117 --> 00:16:09,781
I'm just going to be understanding about everything that's happened.

163
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,117
Ha Ni, I

164
00:16:13,117 --> 00:16:15,423
thought about giving you up,

165
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:18,209
but it won't go the way I want.

166
00:16:20,878 --> 00:16:23,000
You don't have to be sorry.

167
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,964
How is it your fault?

168
00:16:24,964 --> 00:16:28,564
It's that fool Baek Seung Jo that's trying to seduce you!

169
00:16:28,564 --> 00:16:30,284
Quite soon

170
00:16:30,284 --> 00:16:32,675
I'm going to beat the crap out of that Baek Seung Jo.

171
00:16:34,323 --> 00:16:35,903
So,

172
00:16:36,507 --> 00:16:38,657
forget everything

173
00:16:38,657 --> 00:16:40,856
and let's start over,

174
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,700
Ha Ni.

175
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:49,440
Ha Ni?

176
00:16:52,866 --> 00:16:54,656
Ha Ni, are you sleeping?!

177
00:16:54,656 --> 00:16:55,013
Hey!

178
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,192
Hey, Bong Joon Gu.

179
00:17:02,374 --> 00:17:03,697
Hurry.

180
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,425
What?

181
00:17:09,425 --> 00:17:12,269
Hey, Bong Joon Gu. What are you trying to start over?

182
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:14,707
That night, nothing happened between them.

183
00:17:14,707 --> 00:17:17,908
He didn't touch a hair on her.

184
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:19,812
Really?

185
00:17:19,812 --> 00:17:22,459
Yeah, really.

186
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,928
Man, that Baek Seung Jo is a real gentleman!

187
00:17:25,928 --> 00:17:29,471
Wow, you're even complimenting Baek Seung Jo.

188
00:17:29,471 --> 00:17:32,745
Ha Ni!

189
00:17:51,072 --> 00:17:53,419
Oh Ha Ni.

190
00:17:53,955 --> 00:17:55,649
Let's start dating.

191
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,274
Hey, Gi Tae,

192
00:18:12,274 --> 00:18:14,666
when did you arrive?

193
00:18:15,355 --> 00:18:17,173
You've come back?

194
00:18:17,824 --> 00:18:20,076
Hey, go and practice.

195
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:25,499
What are you saying so early in the morning? Ha Ni's got someone.

196
00:18:25,499 --> 00:18:27,437
It's not a joke.

197
00:18:28,621 --> 00:18:31,757
I am Kyung Su's friend, and starting next semester

198
00:18:31,757 --> 00:18:33,854
I'll be attending the same school

199
00:18:33,854 --> 00:18:37,259
I'm Kim Gi Tae.
Nice to meet you.

200
00:18:43,578 --> 00:18:46,995
Since you guys are here already, say hello.

201
00:18:46,995 --> 00:18:48,799
He is your Tennis club Sunbae,

202
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,005
His name is Kim Gi Tae. Greet him.

203
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,941
- Hello.
- Hello

204
00:18:52,941 --> 00:18:55,888
If you're done, go and practice
Go, go.

205
00:18:57,515 --> 00:18:59,162
You're a funny guy.

206
00:18:59,162 --> 00:19:01,477
Since when do you know Ha Ni,

207
00:19:01,477 --> 00:19:03,528
that you want to go out with her as soon as you met her?

208
00:19:03,528 --> 00:19:05,107
Haven't you heard?

209
00:19:05,107 --> 00:19:06,462
Oh Ha Ni and Baek Seung Jo.

210
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:08,047
I know.

211
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:10,429
Ha Ni likes Baek Seung Jo, right?

212
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:13,443
Ever since high school, I've watched over those two.

213
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,084
Huh?

214
00:19:14,084 --> 00:19:15,781
Then, why?

215
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,645
Especially since the two of you aren't dating,

216
00:19:18,504 --> 00:19:20,525
that means that I too,

217
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,800
have a chance.

218
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,300
Yes? Suddenly...

219
00:19:25,308 --> 00:19:26,785
Was it too fast?

220
00:19:28,087 --> 00:19:29,511
OK, good.

221
00:19:30,556 --> 00:19:32,181
This week-end,

222
00:19:32,181 --> 00:19:34,021
let's go on a date.

223
00:19:34,021 --> 00:19:36,579
You need to get to know me as well.

224
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:38,683
That's how it's going to be.

225
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:41,049
Then, see you later.

226
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:43,048
I'm leaving.

227
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:46,919
Before leaving, let's have a game.

228
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,574
Next time.

229
00:19:56,832 --> 00:19:58,932
She totally froze up.

230
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:03,798
Hey Ha Ni.
Isn't he really good looking?

231
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:08,932
When we first joined this school,
Gi Tae and I were very popular with the female Sunbaes,

232
00:20:08,932 --> 00:20:11,332
Him for his looks, and me for my charisma.

233
00:20:11,332 --> 00:20:14,598
But that Gi Tae, to you . . .

234
00:20:16,332 --> 00:20:19,765
You punks! You won't go practice?!

235
00:20:19,765 --> 00:20:22,298
It feels weird.

236
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:25,798
I was very surprised.

237
00:20:26,298 --> 00:20:29,975
This is the first time in my life I have been confessed to this way.

238
00:20:30,565 --> 00:20:32,498
This is amazing.

239
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:36,732
Is it real? Did it really happen? Did he ask you out?

240
00:20:36,732 --> 00:20:40,998
Isn't this the first time in your life? You've always been the one doing the chasing!

241
00:20:44,098 --> 00:20:48,398
I heard he was a sunbae? Who might he be? I'm curious!

242
00:20:48,398 --> 00:20:52,332
How is he? Is he tall? What about his looks?! Is he good looking?

243
00:20:52,332 --> 00:20:54,765
Well, a little.

244
00:20:56,565 --> 00:21:00,898
You're embarrassed! He must be good looking.

245
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,698
Hey, Baek Seung Jo knows too?

246
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:07,592
Right right.
Does Baek Seung Jo know too?

247
00:21:11,598 --> 00:21:17,698
I'm saying, Ha Ni got confessed to by a really cool guy.

248
00:21:17,698 --> 00:21:19,109
Really?

249
00:21:20,877 --> 00:21:22,565
So?

250
00:21:22,565 --> 00:21:31,998
So if you don't do something, Ha Ni and that guy might get together...

251
00:21:32,732 --> 00:21:34,732
You're not worried?

252
00:21:34,732 --> 00:21:37,465
You sure do get excited over nothing.

253
00:21:37,465 --> 00:21:39,132
That's what you wanted to say?

254
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,432
I'm not worried.

255
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:54,532
Oh? really?

256
00:21:54,532 --> 00:21:56,565
He wants to date you?!

257
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,532
Yes.

258
00:21:57,532 --> 00:22:00,098
But it's not a big deal.

259
00:22:00,098 --> 00:22:01,265
Omo!

260
00:22:01,265 --> 00:22:03,045
Who would like you?

261
00:22:03,045 --> 00:22:06,398
How can he be just like his brother!?

262
00:22:06,398 --> 00:22:09,565
The thing I've been fearing has finally come.

263
00:22:09,565 --> 00:22:11,865
Someone as cute as Ha Ni...

264
00:22:11,865 --> 00:22:15,265
I knew I would lose her like this soon enough.

265
00:22:15,265 --> 00:22:19,032
This is all because Seung Jo is dragging his feet.

266
00:22:19,032 --> 00:22:21,965
Stop it dear. Don't get so worked up.

267
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:24,309
Stuff like this is all the free will of the person.

268
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:27,498
What kind of guy is he?

269
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:33,432
It's a sunbae and he's one year older than me. We're in the same grade.

270
00:22:33,432 --> 00:22:37,898
Sunbae?!? My god the most dangerous person is a male Sunbae!

271
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:41,720
I don't really remember his face.

272
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,398
Ha Ni, haven't you been tricked by a player?

273
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:51,332
You're all naive and go around smiling at any old guy right?!

274
00:22:51,332 --> 00:22:53,965
No, dad. I'm not like that.

275
00:22:53,965 --> 00:22:56,798
I have to do whatever I can.

276
00:22:56,798 --> 00:22:58,798
I can't leave it like this.

277
00:23:05,537 --> 00:23:07,865
It's gotten much bigger than I expected.

278
00:23:08,732 --> 00:23:10,965
Today has been eventful.

279
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:20,365
Still, he confessed to me knowing I like Seung Jo

280
00:23:20,965 --> 00:23:22,965
He's a bold person.

281
00:23:27,432 --> 00:23:29,709
How does he look?

282
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:31,965
I didn't get to take a good look.

283
00:23:33,165 --> 00:23:35,298
How did his face look?

284
00:23:56,898 --> 00:23:58,398
Hey you.

285
00:23:58,398 --> 00:24:01,098
I'll see you later.

286
00:24:07,365 --> 00:24:08,645
Oh Ha Ni.

287
00:24:10,665 --> 00:24:12,498
Why did you come...?

288
00:24:12,498 --> 00:24:14,564
You can't forget my face.

289
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:18,798
So I came to show you my face.

290
00:24:20,965 --> 00:24:24,765
Hey, Baek Seung Jo is working part time at a restaurant?

291
00:24:24,765 --> 00:24:26,465
Huh?
Yes.

292
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,865
Last time I went, you were there too.

293
00:24:31,274 --> 00:24:32,998
I heard that you went there everyday.

294
00:24:32,998 --> 00:24:35,032
I went a few times

295
00:24:35,032 --> 00:24:39,432
You know, I'm pretty damn smart too.

296
00:24:39,432 --> 00:24:44,098
Of course I wasn't as visible due to the all around perfect Baek Seung Jo.

297
00:24:44,098 --> 00:24:46,898
Then are you approaching me because of Seung Jo...

298
00:24:46,898 --> 00:24:56,032
Of course I was provoked a bit by Baek Seung who's good at everything whether it's studying or tennis.

299
00:24:56,032 --> 00:24:58,465
As I was worrying about Baek Seung Jo,

300
00:24:58,465 --> 00:25:01,765
it's true that I saw you following him around everywhere.

301
00:25:01,765 --> 00:25:06,165
Suddenly without me even realizing it, little by little,

302
00:25:06,932 --> 00:25:09,032
I started looking at you.

303
00:25:09,032 --> 00:25:10,298
Ah, yes.

304
00:25:10,298 --> 00:25:14,932
You would still step forward despite being rejected by Baek Seung Jo over and over again.

305
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:19,232
You could say I was touched by that, Oh Ha Ni.

306
00:25:19,232 --> 00:25:21,765
Anyway I was pulled towards you.

307
00:25:22,765 --> 00:25:25,265
Hey, just go out with me.

308
00:25:26,365 --> 00:25:31,365
Don't waste your precious youth on Baek Seung Jo, when you don't even know if he will turn around towards you.

309
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:36,698
Have an amusing campus life with me. What do you think?

310
00:25:37,598 --> 00:25:39,565
Even so, I ...

311
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:44,098
I was wondering who it was. It's Gi Tae Sunbae!

312
00:25:44,098 --> 00:25:45,865
Oh, Yoon Hae Ra.

313
00:25:45,865 --> 00:25:48,165
Do you know each other?

314
00:25:48,165 --> 00:25:51,165
I met him often during the tennis matches.

315
00:25:51,165 --> 00:25:53,698
But do you know each other?

316
00:25:53,698 --> 00:25:57,198
I am going out with Oh Ha Ni.

317
00:25:57,198 --> 00:25:59,798
Ah, that's not true.

318
00:26:00,198 --> 00:26:02,732
So, you're going to give up Seung Jo now?

319
00:26:02,732 --> 00:26:03,932
Of course!

320
00:26:03,932 --> 00:26:05,598
Don't just say whatever you want!

321
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:11,698
Before Kyung Su Sunbae, and now Gi tae Sunbae. You're so popular Oh Ha Ni!

322
00:26:11,698 --> 00:26:14,098
You suit each other well.

323
00:26:14,098 --> 00:26:15,865
See you later at the club room.

324
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:16,865
Ok.

325
00:26:16,865 --> 00:26:17,565
See you later.

326
00:26:17,565 --> 00:26:20,132
Sunbae, continue what you were doing.

327
00:26:20,132 --> 00:26:23,498
Make sure to keep it moving straight forward!

328
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:31,365
I'll be going first.

329
00:26:31,365 --> 00:26:32,365
See you later.

330
00:26:34,465 --> 00:26:35,932
Oh, I can't believe it!

331
00:26:52,598 --> 00:26:55,932
His face is about a... 85%

332
00:26:56,498 --> 00:27:01,198
He seems to have a bright personality and he's enthusiastic.

333
00:27:02,865 --> 00:27:05,532
If he's a law major...

334
00:27:05,532 --> 00:27:08,732
A future politician or lawyer?

335
00:27:08,732 --> 00:27:09,765
Mother.

336
00:27:09,765 --> 00:27:12,298
Oh!

337
00:27:15,132 --> 00:27:16,865
This...

338
00:27:18,365 --> 00:27:22,132
Did you possibly go to school to see that sunbae?

339
00:27:23,865 --> 00:27:31,898
He's Seung Jo's rival, so we need to analyze him real well and plan something.

340
00:27:32,132 --> 00:27:38,832
The way I see it, this guy is much cuter than Seung Jo.

341
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:42,365
What to do?

342
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:49,032
If this guy takes your heart,

343
00:27:49,032 --> 00:27:51,232
What would I do?!

344
00:27:52,498 --> 00:27:54,365
Mother.

345
00:27:57,165 --> 00:27:58,798
Not to worry.

346
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:03,098
I will always think of Seung Jo only.

347
00:28:03,465 --> 00:28:04,232
Ha Ni.

348
00:28:04,232 --> 00:28:07,165
I'll go reject him right now!

349
00:28:07,165 --> 00:28:09,732
I'm deeply touched!

350
00:28:11,332 --> 00:28:14,532
Oh wait! No, don't go.

351
00:28:14,532 --> 00:28:16,198
Ha Ni you shouldn't reject him.

352
00:28:16,198 --> 00:28:17,332
Yes?

353
00:28:17,332 --> 00:28:21,365
Let's try to make Seung Jo jealous.

354
00:28:21,365 --> 00:28:23,598
Eh! That's impossible.

355
00:28:23,598 --> 00:28:25,898
No, no.

356
00:28:25,898 --> 00:28:28,664
He may be acting so cocky all the time,

357
00:28:28,664 --> 00:28:32,897
but just wait and see. Seung Jo will definitely feel himself being pulled towards you!

358
00:28:33,565 --> 00:28:36,532
Because you're always next to him,

359
00:28:36,532 --> 00:28:40,232
he is relaxed and doing other things!

360
00:28:40,232 --> 00:28:45,665
But if you suddenly show him another side of you, he will notice his feelings for you.

361
00:28:45,665 --> 00:28:51,898
Will it be alright to use such a dangerous plan like this?

362
00:28:55,132 --> 00:28:56,965
Will it be okay?

363
00:28:57,232 --> 00:29:01,198
Will Seung Jo really be jealous?

364
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,498
Do well.

365
00:29:03,498 --> 00:29:08,498
Gi Tae sunbae is smart, and is very popular with the ladies.

366
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:12,165
But seeing that he has an interest in you,

367
00:29:12,165 --> 00:29:14,798
he does have really unique taste then.

368
00:29:15,565 --> 00:29:20,898
Maybe he's got a bad eye or a real weirdo.

369
00:29:20,898 --> 00:29:23,798
That person is just as smart as you are

370
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:26,165
and as good looking as you.

371
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:31,698
Most of all, compared to you, he is really nice to girls.

372
00:29:31,698 --> 00:29:33,498
I'm in a good mood,

373
00:29:34,198 --> 00:29:36,765
because Ha Ni thinks of me like that.

374
00:29:37,732 --> 00:29:42,932
Well Baek Seung Jo, seeing how it is, why don't you pass Ha Ni on to me?

375
00:29:42,932 --> 00:29:51,065
So it was you Sunbae. There's no need to pass her on. It's not like she belongs to me. Do as you please.

376
00:29:51,065 --> 00:29:54,265
What did he say? I can't believe him.

377
00:29:57,832 --> 00:29:58,532
Gi Tae Sunbae

378
00:29:58,532 --> 00:30:00,398
Oh yes princess?

379
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:02,832
Where are we going on this Sunday's date?

380
00:30:02,832 --> 00:30:04,565
I'm okay with anything.

381
00:30:04,565 --> 00:30:07,765
Whether it's the mountain or the sea, I'll go anywhere.

382
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:12,865
Sunbae, Congratulations. I'm serious!

383
00:30:12,865 --> 00:30:14,998
Seung Jo!

384
00:30:18,665 --> 00:30:21,765
If it goes on like this, I'm really going to cheat on him!

385
00:30:21,765 --> 00:30:23,665
I won't regret it!

386
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,822
What would you like to order?

387
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:38,990
One ice tea.

388
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,337
Do you want to kill time with that again?

389
00:30:41,988 --> 00:30:44,674
Today, I didn't came here to see you.

390
00:30:44,674 --> 00:30:48,836
I'm here for an other appointment.

391
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,347
Ha Ni, I'm sorry.

392
00:30:51,347 --> 00:30:53,899
On the way here, there was a traffic jam.

393
00:30:53,899 --> 00:30:55,116
Did you wait long?

394
00:30:55,116 --> 00:30:57,752
No, I just arrived here, too.

395
00:30:57,752 --> 00:31:01,985
Oh, hi Baek Seung Jo. One coffee for me, with ice.

396
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:05,486
Yes. Ice tea and iced coffee.

397
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:08,087
Wait for a moment please.

398
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,600
Today, it's finally the much anticipated Date day.

399
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,085
The weather today was really nice!

400
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,340
What would you like to do?

401
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:24,359
Well, I don't really know.

402
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:26,495
Perhaps, is this your first date?

403
00:31:26,495 --> 00:31:31,121
Huh? No way. I've gone on dates before.

404
00:31:31,121 --> 00:31:32,918
With Baek Seung Jo?

405
00:31:35,022 --> 00:31:36,712
Yes.

406
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:54,722
Then again, it's our time to have all the fun in the world.

407
00:31:54,722 --> 00:31:58,325
From now on, I'll take you out a lot.

408
00:31:58,325 --> 00:31:59,519
Yes.

409
00:32:02,323 --> 00:32:03,884
Where should we go?

410
00:32:03,884 --> 00:32:08,653
There's this new rollercoaster, which is really fast.
Should we go to the amusement park?

411
00:32:11,986 --> 00:32:15,619
It sounds fun! What should we do afterwards?

412
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:20,578
Watch a movie at the drive-in theater and eat something delicious.

413
00:32:20,578 --> 00:32:22,384
Oh I totally like it, the drive-in theater.

414
00:32:22,384 --> 00:32:24,057
I've never been there before.

415
00:32:24,057 --> 00:32:25,425
Excuse me.

416
00:32:26,592 --> 00:32:31,558
Then how about we go to a nice park and ride bikes?

417
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:32,992
Oh I like that!

418
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:38,089
Oh let's do that first, then let's go to the amusement park, and the drive-in theater.

419
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,592
Enjoy.

420
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:44,358
Have you gone to the Namsan Tower?

421
00:32:44,358 --> 00:32:50,882
There's a place there, where you can write your names on a lock and if you do your love will stay true!

422
00:33:09,292 --> 00:33:10,858
Here, sit.

423
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:52,125
If he's this nice to me...

424
00:33:52,225 --> 00:33:56,158
I don't know what to do.

425
00:33:57,558 --> 00:34:00,525
Right, this is what a date is.

426
00:34:00,525 --> 00:34:04,592
A typical girl would have experienced lots of them by the time she's 19.

427
00:34:05,525 --> 00:34:07,258
Ha Ni!

428
00:34:09,192 --> 00:34:10,292
Did you have a nice time?

429
00:34:10,292 --> 00:34:11,592
Yes.

430
00:34:12,825 --> 00:34:14,292
Here.

431
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:20,125
It's been a long time since I had this much fun.

432
00:34:21,305 --> 00:34:23,325
Why is that?

433
00:34:23,325 --> 00:34:25,992
Is it because when you're with Baek Seung Jo,
you're nervous?

434
00:34:26,925 --> 00:34:28,292
Well.

435
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,858
How many years have it been that you liked Baek Seung Jo?

436
00:34:31,858 --> 00:34:33,625
What?

437
00:34:34,692 --> 00:34:38,225
More or less 4 years.

438
00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:41,158
Since High school.

439
00:34:42,058 --> 00:34:44,258
I guess this will be a prolonged war for me, then.

440
00:34:44,258 --> 00:34:45,025
What?

441
00:34:45,025 --> 00:34:46,525
No...

442
00:34:46,525 --> 00:34:48,592
If you loved him for 4 years...

443
00:34:48,592 --> 00:34:51,658
Just because I've suddenly appeared before you,

444
00:34:51,658 --> 00:34:55,292
doesn't mean your heart is suddenly going to change.

445
00:34:56,192 --> 00:34:59,925
Even if you only think of me from time to time,

446
00:34:59,925 --> 00:35:02,325
I'm satisfied with that.

447
00:35:03,925 --> 00:35:08,125
He's 180 degrees different from Seung Jo.

448
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:12,858
I expected it, but Seung Jo eventually didn't show up.

449
00:35:13,492 --> 00:35:15,425
Ha Ni, let's go!

450
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:42,525
I can't let it continue like this. This just allowed me to reconfirm that Seung Jo really has no feelings for me.

451
00:35:42,525 --> 00:35:47,258
And if I continue along with this, I'm only using Gi Tae sunbae.

452
00:35:47,258 --> 00:35:49,958
So, my heart aches.

453
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:52,758
I must end it.

454
00:35:52,758 --> 00:35:54,458
What are you doing?

455
00:35:55,258 --> 00:35:56,658
Ah, Sunbae.

456
00:35:56,658 --> 00:35:58,658
What are you thinking about in a place like this?

457
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:00,958
Were you looking at something?

458
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:02,125
No.

459
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:06,225
You were looking at Seung Jo from here?

460
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:10,792
Sunbae, I . . .

461
00:36:10,792 --> 00:36:11,925
Oh Ha Ni!

462
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:14,458
Forget Seung Jo already.

463
00:36:15,692 --> 00:36:18,425
Sunbae, I have something to sa-

464
00:36:22,258 --> 00:36:23,658
Come here.

465
00:36:26,192 --> 00:36:27,358
Ha Ni.

466
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:28,892
S-sunbae.

467
00:36:31,158 --> 00:36:33,092
- No...
- What is this?

468
00:36:40,258 --> 00:36:41,525
Sunbae!

469
00:36:42,558 --> 00:36:44,325
I think I've seen you before.

470
00:36:44,325 --> 00:36:46,125
What are you trying to do to Ha Ni?

471
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:47,725
Joon Gu don't!

472
00:36:49,092 --> 00:36:52,058
I was wondering what fool kept hanging around my Ha Ni.

473
00:36:52,058 --> 00:36:54,525
You little fearless...

474
00:36:57,292 --> 00:37:00,258
If you compare the time hanging around, then you've done it much longer.

475
00:37:00,258 --> 00:37:03,125
What are you saying? What do you know?

476
00:37:04,025 --> 00:37:06,025
Yes, Bong Joon Gu.

477
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:09,458
Why don't you give up already?

478
00:37:10,758 --> 00:37:12,192
What?!

479
00:37:16,058 --> 00:37:18,192
Stop it already!

480
00:37:18,192 --> 00:37:19,858
What's going on?

481
00:37:19,858 --> 00:37:22,225
What do you think you're doing in the library?

482
00:37:23,925 --> 00:37:27,792
You two aren't fighting over Oh Ha Ni, right?

483
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:31,192
Hey Baek Seung Jo, this has nothing to do with you. So, back off.

484
00:37:31,192 --> 00:37:35,292
Despite you guys fighting or shedding blood...

485
00:37:35,292 --> 00:37:39,592
It doesn't really matter, but still.

486
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:42,092
The only person Ha Ni likes is me.

487
00:37:42,092 --> 00:37:44,258
So isn't it a waste to fight over it?

488
00:37:45,325 --> 00:37:46,258
Seung Jo.

489
00:37:46,258 --> 00:37:52,258
My mother said for us all to eat dinner together.

490
00:37:52,258 --> 00:37:53,725
Let's go.

491
00:38:06,792 --> 00:38:08,425
Slow down.

492
00:38:12,325 --> 00:38:14,492
Baek Seung Jo, you have quite a lot of confidence.

493
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:15,325
What?

494
00:38:15,325 --> 00:38:18,458
The only person Ha Ni likes is me?

495
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:21,825
My heart could have changed.

496
00:38:21,825 --> 00:38:23,258
You haven't thought about that?

497
00:38:23,258 --> 00:38:24,692
Never.

498
00:38:26,592 --> 00:38:31,258
But, you were a little jealous, right?

499
00:38:31,258 --> 00:38:33,192
If you're going to put on a show...

500
00:38:33,192 --> 00:38:35,325
Why don't you use your brains a bit more.

501
00:38:36,158 --> 00:38:39,992
I can see right through everything you and mother are doing. Dummies.

502
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:47,358
He already knew everything...

503
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,692
He really can't be tricked.

504
00:38:51,925 --> 00:38:54,657
See how nice it is for us to all gather like this?

505
00:38:54,657 --> 00:38:59,657
You like it too, right Seung Jo? Living alone I know exactly what you eat.

506
00:38:59,657 --> 00:39:01,558
No matter where you go, eating at home is the best.

507
00:39:01,558 --> 00:39:06,758
That's right. No matter which restaurant I go to, nothing compares to a home cooked meal.

508
00:39:06,758 --> 00:39:09,425
I thought you said Dduk Bok Gi was the best thing in the world?!

509
00:39:09,425 --> 00:39:11,092
Stupid.

510
00:39:13,258 --> 00:39:17,825
But hey Su Chang, you aren't eating much today.

511
00:39:17,825 --> 00:39:23,092
A new game is coming out so he's been pulling a lot of all nighters, so he's really tired.

512
00:39:23,858 --> 00:39:25,692
Ahjusshi, I'll get some more soup for you.

513
00:39:25,692 --> 00:39:29,892
No, his doctor told him not to eat too much.

514
00:39:29,892 --> 00:39:33,692
No matter how enjoyable your work is, make sure you take of your health first.

515
00:39:33,692 --> 00:39:35,058
Good health is the best thing!

516
00:39:35,058 --> 00:39:38,892
Of course. Gi Dong shi, you take care of your health too.

517
00:39:38,892 --> 00:39:43,158
Of course! Healthy is as healthy can be!

518
00:39:54,985 --> 00:39:57,918
Just as the holidays were approaching...

519
00:39:57,918 --> 00:40:00,552
Seung Jo suddenly disappeared.

520
00:40:00,552 --> 00:40:07,118
He didn't show up at the tennis courts and even stopped part-timing at the family restaurant.

521
00:40:07,118 --> 00:40:09,685
Where could Seung Jo have gone?

522
00:40:09,685 --> 00:40:11,685
Okay, I'm taking it.

523
00:40:11,685 --> 00:40:15,052
One, two, three... Say cheese!

524
00:40:23,518 --> 00:40:27,985
The trails around here are really nice. We'll be preparing the bbq while you're gone.

525
00:40:27,985 --> 00:40:29,785
Thank you.

526
00:40:29,785 --> 00:40:31,152
Good-bye.

527
00:40:31,885 --> 00:40:33,352
Hyung!

528
00:40:34,252 --> 00:40:36,285
I've come.

529
00:40:40,118 --> 00:40:45,718
Sticky gum Ha Ni has found Seung Jo's new part time job!

530
00:40:45,718 --> 00:40:47,518
Eun Jo, you came by yourself?

531
00:40:47,518 --> 00:40:48,285
What about mom and dad?

532
00:40:48,285 --> 00:40:53,218
Dad couldn't come because of work.
And mom said she couldn't leave dad alone.

533
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:55,952
Mother was really very disappointed.

534
00:40:55,952 --> 00:40:58,085
It's obvious.

535
00:40:58,852 --> 00:41:02,952
The water is really good! The water is really famous, seriously!

536
00:41:03,652 --> 00:41:06,252
Aigoo, Ha Ni! Ha Ni has come!

537
00:41:06,252 --> 00:41:10,218
Well then, if you need anything else, just call me.
Rest for now.

538
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:11,918
Yes.

539
00:41:13,352 --> 00:41:16,318
Why did you come so late?
Ah, this must be Eun Jo.

540
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:18,518
Just as I thought, it was you Sunbae.

541
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,785
Why don't you just open up your own broadcasting company.

542
00:41:20,785 --> 00:41:23,318
What are you talking about?

543
00:41:23,318 --> 00:41:27,618
You didn't tell other people too, did you?

544
00:41:30,385 --> 00:41:32,118
Seung Jo!

545
00:41:34,152 --> 00:41:37,952
Have you been well? Oh Eun Jo is here too!

546
00:41:37,952 --> 00:41:40,218
Oh Seung Jo, have you been doing well?

547
00:41:40,218 --> 00:41:44,518
Our villa is right over there. I want to invite you over for dinner. Want to come?

548
00:41:44,518 --> 00:41:45,952
You're coming, right?

549
00:41:45,952 --> 00:41:48,618
Eun Jo, hello.

550
00:41:48,618 --> 00:41:53,518
Kyung Soo sunbae! Just to me?! What kind of secret information is this?!

551
00:41:53,518 --> 00:41:57,185
I have something to tell you, come this way.

552
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,585
Ha Ni, Ha Ni.

553
00:42:03,818 --> 00:42:09,518
I'm thinking about closing the deal with Hae Ra this time.

554
00:42:09,518 --> 00:42:11,718
Do you think, you can do that?

555
00:42:11,718 --> 00:42:14,951
So, I really need your help.

556
00:42:14,951 --> 00:42:20,785
You and I have to join forces to stay afloat.

557
00:42:20,785 --> 00:42:28,852
First off, I need you to keep staying near Seung Jo and stop him from approaching Hae Ra.

558
00:42:28,852 --> 00:42:31,818
Sunbae it's Hae Ra that is approaching Seung Jo!

559
00:42:31,818 --> 00:42:33,585
Hye Ra is into Seung Jo! Has Seung Jo ever been into her?

560
00:42:33,585 --> 00:42:36,085
Just becoming a couple is important.

561
00:42:36,085 --> 00:42:38,985
I'm going to ask to play a couple game. And then you can just become a couple.

562
00:42:38,985 --> 00:42:43,118
- You and Seung Jo. Me and Hae Ra.
- Ay...

563
00:42:43,118 --> 00:42:46,385
Is it that easy? I've tried it this whole time and it's still yet to happen.

564
00:42:46,385 --> 00:42:48,152
Don't worry.

565
00:42:48,152 --> 00:42:50,518
I've planned and prepared everything.

566
00:42:50,518 --> 00:42:52,685
Give me your hand.

567
00:42:52,685 --> 00:42:56,485
Let's try our best in order to achieve our loves!

568
00:42:56,485 --> 00:42:58,185
I feel uneasy for some reason.

569
00:42:58,185 --> 00:43:01,485
What are you doing? I said, let's do fighting!

570
00:43:04,485 --> 00:43:05,218
Fighting.

571
00:43:05,885 --> 00:43:12,052
Hello all my youthful visitors. You've all come here in order to create memories of your youth.

572
00:43:12,052 --> 00:43:14,885
Will checking out the scenery here and there create memories?! No it won't.

573
00:43:14,885 --> 00:43:21,518
So the couple games start now!

574
00:43:27,485 --> 00:43:29,052
Fool.

575
00:43:29,052 --> 00:43:35,485
The way to play this game... Take a look at the map and see the numbers 1-7?

576
00:43:35,485 --> 00:43:42,418
Those are all places. The couple that gets a stamp from all those spots first, wins the game.

577
00:43:42,418 --> 00:43:46,218
This is the stamp!

578
00:43:47,052 --> 00:43:50,052
It's not just a treasure hunt...

579
00:43:50,052 --> 00:43:54,485
But a stamp hunt!

580
00:43:55,552 --> 00:43:57,952
Then we have to decide on your partner.

581
00:43:57,952 --> 00:44:01,218
Your partner will be decided fairly...

582
00:44:03,285 --> 00:44:05,485
We'll use this ladder game method.

583
00:44:05,485 --> 00:44:07,518
Why isn't Seung Jo here?

584
00:44:09,218 --> 00:44:12,085
And really it couldn't be helped...

585
00:44:12,085 --> 00:44:18,852
But I will be joining this game in order to keep all of you safe. It really couldn't be helped.

586
00:44:18,852 --> 00:44:22,718
What the?
Eun Jo, haven't you seen Seung Jo?

587
00:44:23,618 --> 00:44:24,752
I don't know.

588
00:44:24,752 --> 00:44:27,718
Where the heck did he go?

589
00:44:27,718 --> 00:44:31,518
Here you go, this is it.

590
00:44:32,752 --> 00:44:35,818
Hae Ra, what number?

591
00:44:37,118 --> 00:44:38,918
Ah! Number 3!

592
00:44:38,918 --> 00:44:43,118
Then I'll be 8. Everyone pick.

593
00:44:59,985 --> 00:45:01,285
I'm dying here.

594
00:45:09,152 --> 00:45:11,418
It's like some villas or something.

595
00:45:13,352 --> 00:45:14,952
Let's see.

596
00:45:17,018 --> 00:45:19,118
Is this here?

597
00:45:19,952 --> 00:45:21,518
I can't tell.

598
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:24,418
I'm sure it'll show up eventually.

599
00:45:24,852 --> 00:45:29,952
Ha Ni, just wait! I'll definitely protect you!

600
00:45:29,952 --> 00:45:32,752
From now on, I'll never send you off alone!

601
00:45:32,752 --> 00:45:34,785
Let's go.

602
00:45:39,218 --> 00:45:42,552
Why must I do this with Oh Ha Ni?!

603
00:45:45,052 --> 00:45:48,218
Oh! It's there, it's there!

604
00:45:48,218 --> 00:45:49,552
Come quickly!

605
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:57,285
Wow it seems we're the first ones! Right, right, right?!

606
00:45:57,285 --> 00:45:59,052
Shut up.

607
00:46:00,452 --> 00:46:04,052
Ya, let's do this on good terms.

608
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:09,952
Why are you being like this too?
Either way I can't even be with Seung Jo after coming this far.

609
00:46:09,952 --> 00:46:12,552
Even elementary kids don't play games like this!

610
00:46:20,585 --> 00:46:21,718
Do your legs hurt?

611
00:46:21,718 --> 00:46:24,752
I'll piggy back you.

612
00:46:24,752 --> 00:46:26,085
Try getting on my back.

613
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,900
Oh really!

614
00:46:39,917 --> 00:46:42,752
Did you set this up?

615
00:46:42,752 --> 00:46:48,018
You picked 3 first. How could I cheat that?

616
00:46:55,718 --> 00:46:57,118
It's a bug.

617
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:03,618
I want to quit!

618
00:47:04,352 --> 00:47:05,018
It's not fun.

619
00:47:05,018 --> 00:47:07,852
Who said we're doing this for fun?

620
00:47:07,852 --> 00:47:13,918
The great Yoon Hae Ra can't lose to Oh Ha Ni, right? Seung Jo wouldn't like that either.

621
00:47:19,485 --> 00:47:22,218
We just need 6 more.

622
00:47:24,418 --> 00:47:26,785
Let's hurry up and find it then.

623
00:47:28,418 --> 00:47:31,085
Where can it be?

624
00:47:32,385 --> 00:47:36,152
You're the one that hid the stamps, Sunbae. So how could you not know, Sunbae?!

625
00:47:36,152 --> 00:47:39,752
Since the trees all look the same, it's a little confusing.

626
00:47:41,718 --> 00:47:42,885
What is it?

627
00:47:43,752 --> 00:47:49,552
Since we just got the 4th stamp we just need to go...

628
00:47:50,752 --> 00:47:53,152
Did you hear that?

629
00:47:54,452 --> 00:47:56,452
Just now, that sound...

630
00:47:58,018 --> 00:47:59,352
Wasn't that the sound of a wolf?

631
00:47:59,352 --> 00:48:05,218
Idiot. Wolves went extinct in our country.

632
00:48:07,018 --> 00:48:09,118
Then...a bear!?

633
00:48:19,785 --> 00:48:21,952
I think I heard Ha Ni's voice.

634
00:48:24,142 --> 00:48:26,385
Thank god! It's probably not following us, right?

635
00:48:26,385 --> 00:48:28,485
It is not a relief!

636
00:48:29,274 --> 00:48:30,785
Where are we?

637
00:48:30,785 --> 00:48:35,418
It's alright Eun Jo. Noona will try to figure out our path. Don't worry.

638
00:48:45,618 --> 00:48:47,185
Are you alright?

639
00:48:49,985 --> 00:48:52,352
Yes, I am alright Eun Joo.

640
00:48:53,018 --> 00:48:54,752
Stupid!

641
00:48:56,018 --> 00:48:58,985
But....my hat disappeared.

642
00:48:58,985 --> 00:49:00,818
It's my most cherished.

643
00:49:01,352 --> 00:49:04,018
Stay there.
I'll come down there.

644
00:49:04,018 --> 00:49:05,452
Yes.

645
00:49:07,518 --> 00:49:09,307
Eun Joo, be careful!

646
00:49:24,618 --> 00:49:26,552
Where are we supposed to go?

647
00:49:26,552 --> 00:49:30,785
How did this change? Last night there wasn't any water.

648
00:49:30,785 --> 00:49:32,385
Strange.

649
00:49:35,518 --> 00:49:38,652
Hey, Hae Ra, let's go together.

650
00:49:39,318 --> 00:49:41,152
Oh, hey, Hae Ra!

651
00:49:41,152 --> 00:49:43,152
Let's go together! Together!

652
00:49:47,952 --> 00:49:49,918
I found it!

653
00:49:50,885 --> 00:49:52,018
The stamp, the stamp!

654
00:49:52,018 --> 00:49:53,085
Where?

655
00:49:53,085 --> 00:49:54,485
Oh, that?!

656
00:49:54,485 --> 00:49:56,285
The stamp!

657
00:49:56,285 --> 00:49:58,997
Let's go, hurry!

658
00:50:10,718 --> 00:50:12,085
Gosh!

659
00:50:17,118 --> 00:50:20,418
This is why there's no reason to like you.

660
00:50:20,418 --> 00:50:22,352
It's alright, I'm going.

661
00:50:24,552 --> 00:50:26,218
Hey Hae Ra...

662
00:50:28,252 --> 00:50:32,585
Seeing a guy like this, doesn't your motherly instincts...

663
00:50:40,352 --> 00:50:42,985
Isn't that Ha Ni's hat?

664
00:50:45,685 --> 00:50:50,118
Did something happen to you, Ha NI?

665
00:50:50,718 --> 00:50:53,018
Just wait there awhile. I'll come and rescue you.

666
00:50:53,118 --> 00:50:55,152
Oh that!

667
00:50:56,418 --> 00:51:00,118
Alright this.

668
00:51:01,585 --> 00:51:02,785
Aigoo!

669
00:51:09,918 --> 00:51:11,552
Aigoo!

670
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,618
Got it. Got it.

671
00:51:13,618 --> 00:51:15,318
Alright, alright!

672
00:51:30,785 --> 00:51:32,218
Oh, Seung Jo!

673
00:51:33,818 --> 00:51:35,453
Oh, really!

674
00:51:37,918 --> 00:51:39,252
Seung Jo.

675
00:51:39,252 --> 00:51:43,085
Seung Joo, give me water..

676
00:51:43,085 --> 00:51:44,652
What happened to Sunbae?

677
00:51:44,652 --> 00:51:47,152
I don't know! His body build is completely useless!

678
00:51:48,228 --> 00:51:50,785
Seung Jo, the mountains here are pretty rough.

679
00:51:50,785 --> 00:51:52,718
There are animals making noises in the mountains.

680
00:51:52,718 --> 00:51:55,018
Anyways, it was really hard.

681
00:51:55,685 --> 00:51:57,685
Where are Eun Joo and Ha Ni?

682
00:51:57,685 --> 00:51:59,852
They were the first ones to leave.

683
00:51:59,852 --> 00:52:01,452
They're still not back?

684
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:04,389
Give me water, water...

685
00:52:06,185 --> 00:52:07,885
It got cold.

686
00:52:08,018 --> 00:52:10,701
I am hungry too.

687
00:52:10,808 --> 00:52:13,885
But other than that, the problem is not finding our way back.

688
00:52:14,985 --> 00:52:17,203
There's still no signal.

689
00:52:17,449 --> 00:52:19,718
Cell phones must not even work here.

690
00:52:22,018 --> 00:52:23,233
Here.

691
00:52:24,818 --> 00:52:27,698
Baek Eun Joo!
You are amazing.

692
00:52:29,185 --> 00:52:30,663
That's it!

693
00:52:30,663 --> 00:52:33,552
Preparation. If you are prepared you'll be happy.

694
00:52:33,552 --> 00:52:37,208
Analogy...

695
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:39,118
What is it?

696
00:52:39,218 --> 00:52:41,252
Just put this over yourself.

697
00:52:50,273 --> 00:52:54,106
Our Eun Jo sure is reliable.

698
00:52:54,518 --> 00:52:56,952
It feels like being with mini Seung Jo.

699
00:52:56,952 --> 00:52:59,052
First we need to find the canyon.

700
00:52:59,052 --> 00:53:01,552
If we follow the path we came from,

701
00:53:01,552 --> 00:53:04,218
then we're going to be able to find a way out.

702
00:53:04,218 --> 00:53:08,085
If we wait
won't Seung Joo come?

703
00:53:08,085 --> 00:53:09,885
You are really stupid!

704
00:53:09,885 --> 00:53:12,618
How will he know that we are here?

705
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:15,618
Are you cold?

706
00:53:19,285 --> 00:53:20,718
You can hold it.

707
00:53:23,052 --> 00:53:24,918
You're so reliable.

708
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:30,485
The sun is going to go down, and my feet are killing me. Damn it!

709
00:53:31,452 --> 00:53:33,318
Anyway, I need to go.

710
00:53:34,818 --> 00:53:36,313
Aigoo!

711
00:53:55,905 --> 00:53:58,938
Ha Ni, I am really sorry.

712
00:53:58,938 --> 00:54:01,538
I can't go up in this condition.

713
00:54:05,872 --> 00:54:07,705
Like this..

714
00:54:08,757 --> 00:54:11,204
Like this, definitely

715
00:54:12,972 --> 00:54:14,247
This can't be!

716
00:54:31,938 --> 00:54:33,388
Aigoo!

717
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:39,905
No!
No!

718
00:54:42,038 --> 00:54:43,838
That sound, there it is again!

719
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:45,363
What do we do!

720
00:54:45,363 --> 00:54:47,338
It's probably a village dog or something!

721
00:55:02,707 --> 00:55:04,450
Isn't that Ha Ni's voice?

722
00:55:07,829 --> 00:55:09,538
Ha Ni!

723
00:55:10,905 --> 00:55:12,372
Ha Ni!

724
00:55:13,405 --> 00:55:17,089
It must be coming this way.
What should we do?

725
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:18,772
Get behind me.

726
00:55:27,505 --> 00:55:28,472
Hyung!

727
00:55:28,472 --> 00:55:29,110
Eun Jo!

728
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:30,538
Hyung!

729
00:55:31,572 --> 00:55:33,338
Seung Jo!

730
00:55:35,505 --> 00:55:37,245
Ha Ni!

731
00:55:37,245 --> 00:55:40,072
I love you!

732
00:55:50,252 --> 00:55:51,985
Won't anyone help me?

733
00:55:52,752 --> 00:55:55,118
I would be grateful if someone came to help me.

734
00:55:58,418 --> 00:55:59,752
Oh.

735
00:55:59,752 --> 00:56:02,285
Hey.
Grab this.

736
00:56:03,418 --> 00:56:05,518
Isn't that voice Baek Seung Joo?

737
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:10,018
Hurry and grab this.

738
00:56:12,485 --> 00:56:14,152
Hey.

739
00:56:14,152 --> 00:56:16,452
Why are you butting in?!

740
00:56:16,452 --> 00:56:18,518
Who the hell are you to save me!

741
00:56:18,518 --> 00:56:19,518
Screw off!

742
00:56:19,518 --> 00:56:22,034
Really? Then, I'm leaving first.

743
00:56:23,683 --> 00:56:26,552
Hey, hey! Where are you going now?

744
00:56:27,952 --> 00:56:31,052
Fine, we have to save Ha Ni.

745
00:56:31,052 --> 00:56:34,617
Calm down, she's safe. She went to the camp first.

746
00:56:34,617 --> 00:56:36,618
Rea...Really?

747
00:56:39,318 --> 00:56:41,811
It is a relief, you really did well.

748
00:56:42,518 --> 00:56:44,517
It is really a relief!

749
00:56:45,684 --> 00:56:49,085
Hey! Then...

750
00:56:49,584 --> 00:56:51,252
would you help me?

751
00:56:52,885 --> 00:56:54,585
Man I'm dying.

752
00:57:01,552 --> 00:57:06,485
Shut your mouth. I can't show anyone this side of me.

753
00:57:07,018 --> 00:57:10,285
Especially not to Ha Ni. Got it?

754
00:57:10,285 --> 00:57:14,252
Anyways, nobody knows that you're here.

755
00:57:14,252 --> 00:57:15,883
Don't worry.

756
00:57:17,718 --> 00:57:19,918
Man, I'm a complete mess.

757
00:57:20,425 --> 00:57:23,152
How can I show this side of me to Baek Seung Jo.

758
00:57:24,185 --> 00:57:25,891
Baek Seung Jo!

759
00:57:25,891 --> 00:57:29,485
I'm going to return the favor.

760
00:57:30,852 --> 00:57:32,652
That's not very appreciative.

761
00:58:31,018 --> 00:58:32,885
Oh...Seung Jo!

762
00:58:32,885 --> 00:58:35,518
Did you come out for a walk?

763
00:58:35,518 --> 00:58:36,718
Yes.

764
00:58:45,885 --> 00:58:47,835
You should've come alone.

765
00:58:48,452 --> 00:58:49,385
Huh?

766
00:58:49,385 --> 00:58:52,585
Saying that you like me and stuff..

767
00:58:53,827 --> 00:58:55,666
don't you know how I feel?

768
00:58:56,624 --> 00:58:59,806
How you feel...

769
00:58:59,806 --> 00:59:04,827
There's no way someone like me...

770
00:59:38,794 --> 00:59:40,627
It was a dream.

771
00:59:42,127 --> 00:59:44,260
I was surprised.

772
00:59:46,532 --> 00:59:48,594
No wonder

773
00:59:48,594 --> 00:59:50,727
It was playing out so smoothly.

774
00:59:50,727 --> 00:59:53,855
If I knew it was a dream...

775
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:56,758
I should have dreamed a bit longer before waking up.

776
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,020
But...

777
01:00:04,694 --> 01:00:08,259
the feeling of his lips

778
01:00:27,194 --> 01:00:29,857
For the first time I want to do something.

779
01:00:29,857 --> 01:00:31,785
I'm going to apply for medical school.

780
01:00:31,785 --> 01:00:34,294
I have a dream too.

781
01:00:34,594 --> 01:00:36,748
Tell me that dream.

782
01:00:36,748 --> 01:00:40,227
That you want to do something with me?

783
01:00:40,227 --> 01:00:41,427
I'll make it come true.

784
01:00:41,427 --> 01:00:42,894
Did you grab your wallet?

785
01:00:42,894 --> 01:00:48,327
A new wife, I'm sure you want to call him honey.

786
01:00:48,327 --> 01:00:51,245
Let me choose what I want to do with my life.

787
01:00:51,245 --> 01:00:53,027
Baek Seung Jo

788
01:00:53,027 --> 01:00:54,981
I've decided to become a doctor.

789
01:00:54,981 --> 01:00:58,227
I will not inherit father's company.

790
01:00:58,227 --> 01:00:59,560
Father!

791
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:00,694
Father, what's wrong!

792
01:01:00,694 --> 01:01:02,227
Honey!
Are you okay?

793
01:01:02,227 --> 01:01:05,827
This is the first time you want to do something right?

794
01:01:05,827 --> 01:01:14,827
If I do this
Dad will be happy
I have no interest in it
but at least he'll be happy.
