1
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:47,560
What are you doing? Like a thief.

2
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,393
That's not it. I had to look for something.

3
00:00:51,357 --> 00:00:53,576
Do you expect me to believe that?

4
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:59,152
When there is nobody but us home,

5
00:00:59,152 --> 00:01:01,413
you suddenly had something to find?

6
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:04,907
No. Really.

7
00:01:10,907 --> 00:01:12,646
Are they busy?

8
00:01:12,646 --> 00:01:14,358
Seems like they're sleeping.

9
00:01:17,187 --> 00:01:19,391
Why are you like this?

10
00:01:19,391 --> 00:01:21,316
What do you mean why am I like this?

11
00:01:21,316 --> 00:01:23,360
Didn't you come in here wanting this?

12
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,505
What?

13
00:01:24,505 --> 00:01:25,962
No!

14
00:01:25,962 --> 00:01:27,641
So what?

15
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:31,378
We're the only ones in the house.

16
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:36,647
Seung Jo, why are you like this?

17
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,300
Aigoo!

18
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,700
Oh, he`s even faster than me.

19
00:01:46,115 --> 00:01:48,600
First...

20
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,652
...let's soundly date.

21
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,700
Soundly?

22
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,400
When was that word ever used?

23
00:02:07,356 --> 00:02:08,999
Soundly.

24
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,185
Oh. You came.

25
00:02:39,185 --> 00:02:40,431
What the...

26
00:02:40,431 --> 00:02:42,210
What's wrong with Oh Ha Ni?

27
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,279
Her face is really red.

28
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:45,719
Really?

29
00:02:46,676 --> 00:02:48,458
I wonder what's wrong.

30
00:03:19,047 --> 00:03:21,336
Stupid jerk.

31
00:03:21,336 --> 00:03:23,683
Always playing around with me.

32
00:03:51,326 --> 00:03:53,788
Am I really dumb?

33
00:03:55,988 --> 00:03:58,608
After this (the love letter being graded)...

34
00:04:04,255 --> 00:04:06,575
Doongi ah.

35
00:04:06,575 --> 00:04:08,869
Is it supposed to be like this?

36
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:13,838
My heart...

37
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:16,155
...it isn't doing what I want it to do.

38
00:04:28,655 --> 00:04:30,551
- Hey, what about Oh Ha Ni?
- She must not be on here.

39
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:32,173
- Did Oh Ha Ni's grades drop?

40
00:04:32,173 --> 00:04:35,188
- What happened? Why isn't she on here?

41
00:04:36,888 --> 00:04:39,088
So it was because of Baek Seung Jo's help.

42
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:43,555
After going to the Special Study Hall,
I found out it wasn't that great.

43
00:04:43,555 --> 00:04:45,821
The kids there are weird too.

44
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,688
Anyway...

45
00:04:49,688 --> 00:04:54,188
Out of all those colleges,
isn't there one we can go to?

46
00:04:56,721 --> 00:05:00,821
There will be one. A college
that will accept you... There will be one.

47
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:15,088
Let's try for a special circumstance admission.

48
00:05:15,088 --> 00:05:16,521
A special circumstance admission?

49
00:05:16,521 --> 00:05:20,619
In truth, for an exceptional admission you need to have many letters of recommendation and awards or trophies as well.

50
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:22,955
Anyway, you have to be really good at something.

51
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:24,688
This...

52
00:05:24,688 --> 00:05:28,555
Even though one may not be doing that well now, they choose those who they think will do well in the future.

53
00:05:28,555 --> 00:05:30,188
Ah! Latent potential!

54
00:05:30,188 --> 00:05:31,321
That's right!

55
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:34,155
Here, let's look for a place that'll match us.

56
00:05:34,555 --> 00:05:38,388
By any chance, was your grandfather a patriot?

57
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:42,055
It's okay if it's the grandfather on the mother's side.

58
00:05:42,055 --> 00:05:43,555
Really?

59
00:05:48,855 --> 00:05:50,621
Ha Ni.

60
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:55,055
Your grandfather (maternal)...

61
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,721
...was a shutter man (opens and closes the shop shutter, i.e., while his wife works, he plays).

62
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:00,855
Ah, he was ahead of his time...

63
00:06:00,855 --> 00:06:03,088
Okay. Uhhh...

64
00:06:03,088 --> 00:06:06,621
Was your father a special agent?

65
00:06:08,155 --> 00:06:10,321
Special missions?

66
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,821
Well...

67
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:18,955
There is something special in making noodles.

68
00:06:20,488 --> 00:06:23,655
Ha Ni, it will work if you're the female householder.

69
00:06:23,655 --> 00:06:24,988
Ha Ni...

70
00:06:26,088 --> 00:06:28,055
Your dad...

71
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:31,121
Should I just move out?

72
00:06:32,321 --> 00:06:33,688
It's unlikely...

73
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:38,855
...but you're not from a
multicultural heritage, are you?

74
00:06:39,721 --> 00:06:40,788
Multicultural heritage?

75
00:06:40,788 --> 00:06:42,621
Think about it, Dad.

76
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:45,688
Did Mom possibly speak Thai or anything like that?

77
00:06:45,688 --> 00:06:47,521
She didn't do that?

78
00:06:49,121 --> 00:06:50,888
Thai?

79
00:06:55,055 --> 00:06:56,855
Tom Yam Koong!
(a kind of Thai food called sour soup)

80
00:07:05,255 --> 00:07:08,788
Does this mean that there's not
a single one out of all of these?

81
00:07:10,155 --> 00:07:12,421
I'm worrying! Stop doing that!

82
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:15,221
Blood donation?

83
00:07:15,788 --> 00:07:19,488
You can have it. There's a lot at home.

84
00:07:19,488 --> 00:07:21,655
Do you donate a lot of blood?

85
00:07:21,655 --> 00:07:23,321
Once every two months.

86
00:07:23,321 --> 00:07:25,521
I donate more through money.

87
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:27,321
You should have said something earlier!

88
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,921
It says that giving blood once
equals ten hours of service!

89
00:07:29,921 --> 00:07:31,155
Really?!

90
00:07:32,255 --> 00:07:34,588
Then, if it's ten times... 100 hours?!

91
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,021
Yeah!

92
00:07:37,721 --> 00:07:39,055
I found it.

93
00:07:39,055 --> 00:07:41,355
The "Giving Back to the Community" option.

94
00:07:41,355 --> 00:07:43,455
Social Science.

95
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:44,488
Parang University?

96
00:07:44,488 --> 00:07:46,155
Yeah.

97
00:07:48,121 --> 00:07:49,621
Min Ah, you're also going
to Parang University, right?

98
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:51,321
Yeah, as an animation major.

99
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:53,455
Our teacher said to try it once.

100
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:56,621
Wow, then are you both
going to Parang University?

101
00:07:56,621 --> 00:07:58,255
If we get in that is.

102
00:07:58,255 --> 00:08:01,655
Even if the application goes through,
I heard the interview process is very picky.

103
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:02,855
I have a skill examination as well.

104
00:08:02,855 --> 00:08:06,988
How come our teacher didn't say
anything to me about Parang University?

105
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:11,488
What are you doing?!

106
00:08:11,488 --> 00:08:13,921
Look at you. Stop eating.

107
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:15,755
I'm getting angry so give it to me.

108
00:08:17,321 --> 00:08:18,921
Ju Ri.

109
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:22,521
I was wondering why we hadn't seen you around, especially since Oh Ha Ni is here.

110
00:08:22,521 --> 00:08:23,155
What?

111
00:08:23,155 --> 00:08:26,188
Did you put some kind of tracker on her?

112
00:08:26,188 --> 00:08:28,621
How did you just pop out of nowhere like a ghost?

113
00:08:29,321 --> 00:08:31,521
You guys still don't know?

114
00:08:32,588 --> 00:08:35,821
Ha Ni is my life's navigation system.

115
00:08:35,821 --> 00:08:39,821
She tells me where I need to go,
location, direction, speed.

116
00:08:39,821 --> 00:08:42,321
Navigation my butt.

117
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:45,488
Hey, where are all your little friends
and why did you come alone?

118
00:08:45,488 --> 00:08:47,255
They went to an audition.

119
00:08:47,255 --> 00:08:48,288
They practice for auditions after all.

120
00:08:48,288 --> 00:08:49,788
Really?

121
00:08:49,788 --> 00:08:54,555
Oh my, I thought they were audition
applicants since they go to auditions all the time.

122
00:08:54,555 --> 00:08:56,055
What are you saying, girl?

123
00:08:56,055 --> 00:08:57,288
What? What?

124
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:00,855
Isn't that Baek Seung Jo?

125
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:06,621
I think you should go to a school
with lots of history and tradition...

126
00:09:06,621 --> 00:09:09,388
...a university that has
produced many great scholars.

127
00:09:09,388 --> 00:09:10,955
Or the American Ivy Leagues...

128
00:09:10,955 --> 00:09:13,388
Who's the guy in front of him?

129
00:10:05,243 --> 00:10:07,243
Special skill?

130
00:10:07,243 --> 00:10:08,910
Specialty?

131
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,577
Specialty?!

132
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,210
Specialty?! Specialty?!

133
00:10:23,943 --> 00:10:25,877
You're working hard.

134
00:10:25,877 --> 00:10:26,843
Of course.

135
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:29,210
Do you think I'm a teacher who plays
around like a certain someone?

136
00:10:30,443 --> 00:10:31,845
Me?

137
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:38,143
Vice principal.

138
00:10:38,143 --> 00:10:39,043
Please give me what you told me about a while ago.

139
00:10:39,043 --> 00:10:40,351
What was it?

140
00:10:40,543 --> 00:10:43,843
Ah! The Principal's recommendation?

141
00:10:44,943 --> 00:10:46,443
How can I do that?!

142
00:10:46,443 --> 00:10:49,777
How can I give a Principal's recommendation
to the bottom ranked students?

143
00:10:49,777 --> 00:10:53,543
Oh Ha Ni went up from the bottom
ranks to the top fifty in one week.

144
00:10:53,543 --> 00:10:55,243
If that's not potential, then what is?

145
00:10:55,243 --> 00:10:56,977
The special case admissions look at potential.

146
00:10:56,977 --> 00:10:58,543
Yes, that is so.

147
00:10:58,543 --> 00:11:01,477
Look at the kids who got into college last year.

148
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:05,143
70% were ranked 1st, 2nd, or 3rd class.

149
00:11:05,143 --> 00:11:08,643
Just because a person has passion,
does that make them a good teacher?

150
00:11:08,643 --> 00:11:13,177
They have to be able to teach the kids
about looking into reality properly.

151
00:11:13,177 --> 00:11:16,610
If Oh Ha Ni gets into Parang University...

152
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:21,110
...then I am Teacher Song's child.

153
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:33,543
Always passionate...

154
00:11:34,843 --> 00:11:36,777
Excuse me...

155
00:11:37,743 --> 00:11:39,077
This.

156
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,143
It's vitamin C.

157
00:11:42,143 --> 00:11:44,249
You should dissolve it in water.

158
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:47,677
This is the first time,

159
00:11:48,477 --> 00:11:50,677
you seem like a person.

160
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,077
You're head over heels for me, aren't you?!

161
00:12:04,243 --> 00:12:05,710
It's done!

162
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,843
Uh... Self introduction.

163
00:12:08,843 --> 00:12:11,610
I was born August 11th...

164
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,477
Okay.

165
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,752
Okay, so now...

166
00:12:16,752 --> 00:12:19,952
I just have to register...

167
00:12:21,243 --> 00:12:22,255
What!

168
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:25,343
What's wrong with this? Why isn't it opening?!

169
00:12:25,577 --> 00:12:26,734
What?

170
00:12:26,734 --> 00:12:30,143
Error Report?
"Please click here."

171
00:12:30,143 --> 00:12:31,943
Click.

172
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,377
"What you were working on..."

173
00:12:36,377 --> 00:12:38,610
"...will be lost."

174
00:12:51,243 --> 00:12:53,543
Is it going well?

175
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,210
Why did you have so many useless tabs open?

176
00:12:57,667 --> 00:13:00,743
I didn't!

177
00:13:00,743 --> 00:13:03,610
What do I do? What do I do?!

178
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,843
What to do?!

179
00:13:05,843 --> 00:13:09,443
It's going to be okay, Ha Ni.
It couldn't have all been erased.

180
00:13:09,443 --> 00:13:13,177
In a little bit, it will close.

181
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,377
Urgh, shut up!

182
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,610
I can't think straight.

183
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:27,187
It's fixed!

184
00:13:27,187 --> 00:13:28,343
Really?

185
00:13:28,343 --> 00:13:29,710
What about the written application?

186
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:31,010
It's there!

187
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,843
Really? It's not gone?

188
00:13:32,843 --> 00:13:35,010
Yes, he found it!

189
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,643
Oh, thank you.

190
00:13:40,743 --> 00:13:44,010
Stop fooling around and quickly get the receipt.

191
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,643
Yes.

192
00:13:48,977 --> 00:13:50,677
Oh, it's a relief.

193
00:13:50,677 --> 00:13:53,310
Hurry and go downstairs to have dinner.

194
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,810
Let's go, Eun Jo.

195
00:13:58,477 --> 00:14:00,177
What's wrong?

196
00:14:05,443 --> 00:14:07,377
Parang University undergraduate course?

197
00:14:07,377 --> 00:14:08,843
Yes.

198
00:14:08,843 --> 00:14:11,677
Actually, there aren't a lot of possibilities for me.

199
00:14:11,677 --> 00:14:13,010
My grades are really bad.

200
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,243
You went that crazy when you don't
even really have a chance?

201
00:14:15,243 --> 00:14:17,543
Still, I have to try doing what I can.

202
00:14:19,377 --> 00:14:20,610
Why are you going to college?

203
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,910
Huh?

204
00:14:22,877 --> 00:14:25,443
Why do you ask?
Well, to study and...

205
00:14:25,443 --> 00:14:29,343
Having nothing you're good at,
nor a field you're interested in...

206
00:14:29,677 --> 00:14:31,310
...why are you still doing this?

207
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:36,277
If not to study, then I can find my purpose in life.

208
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,510
Find out about what I like or what I'm good at.

209
00:14:41,243 --> 00:14:43,943
How would you know if you like something?

210
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:47,010
Of course you would know!

211
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,477
Your heart starts beating fast.

212
00:14:51,377 --> 00:14:54,377
If you find something you like,

213
00:14:54,377 --> 00:14:56,043
it'll beat fast here.

214
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:03,243
My dad... When he smells
noodles drying, his heart still beats fast.

215
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,210
I'd like to experience it too,

216
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,035
that kind of feeling.

217
00:15:19,643 --> 00:15:21,377
Ah, hurry!

218
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,410
I wonder why I'm going to college?

219
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,377
I've never worried about it before.

220
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:41,377
After all, geniuses must have their own worries.

221
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:50,343
Did he show me a little of his feelings?

222
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:55,121
Ah!

223

[Acceptance Letter]

224
00:16:00,623 --> 00:16:01,956
[Acceptance Letter]

225
00:16:01,956 --> 00:16:04,823
Did you have to print them out?

226
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:19,489
Well, there are always those one or two mysteries.

227
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:28,456
Yes, there are. But, please, it would be
nice if they weren't from Class 7.

228
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:35,456
Then, if you pass the interview
you can go to Parang University?

229
00:16:38,656 --> 00:16:41,265
They said they chose a lot.

230
00:16:41,265 --> 00:16:43,318
The competition isn't a joke.

231
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:45,866
They only picked a multiple of five.

232
00:16:46,387 --> 00:16:49,789
But, what will they ask at the interviews?

233
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,556
I'm not really good with speaking.

234
00:16:51,556 --> 00:16:53,789
I still have the skills exam too.

235
00:16:54,256 --> 00:16:58,023
There is no way my Ha Ni can fail that interview.

236
00:16:58,023 --> 00:17:01,123
Even if she does fail, at least she got it.

237
00:17:01,123 --> 00:17:04,289
My Ha Ni is really good, isn't she?!

238
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:07,089
Ha Ni sunbae, do you have some kind of backing?

239
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:08,023
Backing?

240
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:12,436
Yeah. The heavens must've helped me.

241
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:24,889
The 11th typhoon, "La Na Nim",
is blowing through Korea.

242
00:17:24,889 --> 00:17:26,356
Ha Ni!

243
00:17:26,656 --> 00:17:29,069
Dad! What is this?!

244
00:17:29,069 --> 00:17:31,118
The subway is going to be safe.

245
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:32,256
Ha Ni, will you be okay?

246
00:17:32,256 --> 00:17:35,151
Of course! After all, it's just raining.

247
00:17:35,151 --> 00:17:37,623
It's not just raining! There's a typhoon out there.

248
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,670
Right!

249
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:42,817
Just don't...

250
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,756
How about giving up the interview?

251
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:48,789
Why!

252
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:50,856
You think I don't have a chance of getting in?

253
00:17:50,856 --> 00:17:52,056
You don't believe in me, Dad?!

254
00:17:52,056 --> 00:17:54,194
Th...that's not it!

255
00:17:54,194 --> 00:17:55,408
Just look at the weather!

256
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,956
This is the only place that will
accept me despite my grades.

257
00:17:58,956 --> 00:18:01,972
Even if it's only because I'm grateful, I have to go.

258
00:18:03,523 --> 00:18:05,512
Dad, don't worry.

259
00:18:05,512 --> 00:18:06,789
I'll be going now!

260
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:07,956
Bye!

261
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:09,656
Right! Right!

262
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:14,060
- But just wait.
- I don't wanna!

263
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,760
Nothing's going easily.

264
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,119
You're right. A typhoon coming so suddenly.

265
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,627
Because the tracks are filled with water,
the subway will not continue to run.

266
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,900
All passengers are asked to leave the train at the next stop, and find other means of transportation to reach their destinations.

267
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:37,200
In some areas, the typhoon has turned from early warning to alert mode.

268
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,260
In many areas, the typhoon has brought strong winds

269
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,800
and hindered the traffic.

270
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,000
Seoul, Kyung Gi schools have already closed today because of the typhoon.

271
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,227
Typhoon warning:
Schools in the central district of Seoul will be closed.

272
00:18:51,227 --> 00:18:57,810
All companies will open late.
Forecast for Seoul: there will be heavy rain from today until tomorrow.

273
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:03,327
High winds expected with major flooding.

[Social Sciences Interview]
[Parang University]

275
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,327
Student, you didn't have a lot of trouble getting here?

276
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:09,460
My house is nearby.

277
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,292
That's a relief.

278
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:13,260
You can leave this way.

279
00:19:16,931 --> 00:19:19,627
Only a small number of students have arrived.

280
00:19:24,555 --> 00:19:26,460
Excuse me...

281
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,227
Many students were not able to make it.

282
00:19:29,788 --> 00:19:32,060
Wouldn't it be best if we postpone the interviews?

283
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,127
How many typhoons will come in one's lifetime?

284
00:19:35,127 --> 00:19:35,927
Eh?

285
00:19:35,927 --> 00:19:39,760
Whenever that happens, should we
postpone and end it here?

286
00:19:41,294 --> 00:19:42,094
Send in the next one.

287
00:19:42,094 --> 00:19:44,227
Next student, please come in.

288
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,400
Eun Jo, what are you doing?

289
00:20:11,487 --> 00:20:15,238
Alright! I'm not going to school
because of the typhoon.

290
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,420
Aigoo, Ha Ni going to an
interview in this kind of weather...

291
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,520
I hope the results are good.

292
00:20:34,587 --> 00:20:37,453
This is interesting.

293
00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:40,153
Well then, what are you most interested in?

294
00:20:40,153 --> 00:20:42,963
Oh, that. It's Baek Seung Jo!

295
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:49,020
Um, what I meant to say was...

296
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,553
...a person.

297
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:53,020
Oh, you have an interest in people?

298
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,120
Yes! That's right, people!

299
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,687
Recently, I've been thinking...

300
00:20:59,687 --> 00:21:03,061
...if we were to get to know other people,

301
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,920
how much time would it take to get to know them?

302
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,453
In our lifetime, could we fully understand...

303
00:21:10,453 --> 00:21:12,986
...even one person?

304
00:21:14,053 --> 00:21:16,920
I don't think I could ever understand Baek Seung Jo.

305
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:24,187
Why must we choose you?

306
00:21:24,187 --> 00:21:25,753
Excuse me?

307
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,087
Your teacher's letter of recommendation...

308
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:32,420
...is almost at the level of a pledge in blood.

309
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,687
Even so...

310
00:21:33,687 --> 00:21:38,553
In a week, you were able to raise
your grades from the 90th place to the 50th.

311
00:21:38,553 --> 00:21:43,853
However, on the very next test,
you dropped back down again.

312
00:21:43,853 --> 00:21:48,353
And since last year, every two months...

313
00:21:48,353 --> 00:21:51,220
...you've donated blood.

314
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,887
That is all. How could you possibly
have passed the first round?

315
00:21:55,887 --> 00:21:59,848
She got a high score for her personal introduction.

316
00:21:59,848 --> 00:22:03,710
Her confidence is high and her
community service is amazing.

317
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:08,187
We're not picking just any miscellaneous writer.

318
00:22:08,187 --> 00:22:14,353
If there is any reason why we must choose you,
Oh Ha Ni, then please do tell!

319
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,787
There's one minute left.

320
00:22:19,787 --> 00:22:20,953
Uh. That...

321
00:22:22,953 --> 00:22:26,820
Okay. If you don't have any,
you don't have to say anything.

322
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,520
Nice job.

323
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,787
Next participant.

324
00:22:29,787 --> 00:22:31,420
Yes.

325
00:22:41,953 --> 00:22:43,220
Excuse me.

326
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,783
You were right. You saw through me.

327
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:55,453
I really don't have anything that I do well.

328
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,853
Passing the first round was a miracle for me.

329
00:23:00,853 --> 00:23:04,053
So, in truth, I'm really thankful.

330
00:23:04,053 --> 00:23:07,820
However, I think I could say this...

331
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,587
If it's not me,

332
00:23:09,587 --> 00:23:13,120
and you picked another student with
good grades and lots of awards...

333
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,387
Anyway, if you picked such a stellar student,

334
00:23:16,387 --> 00:23:19,420
but if that student is lazy, and doesn't work hard!

335
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,653
When it's rainy and windy, he gives up.

336
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:27,353
So, then if you guys think that person
isn't right for your college,

337
00:23:27,353 --> 00:23:31,053
if that happens, then choose me!

338
00:23:32,887 --> 00:23:35,820
I'm slower than other people,

339
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,820
but I never give up.

340
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,587
I always do everything till the end.

341
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:44,387
That's why my nickname is "Noah's Snail."

342
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,053
Try having a snail as a pet.

343
00:24:04,787 --> 00:24:06,320
I don't think I'm going to make it.

344
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,586
I knew...

345
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,352
Ah well, the results haven't come yet.

346
00:24:12,352 --> 00:24:15,487
Yeah, that's right. You can study
and go together with Seung Jo.

347
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,687
I'm not going to take the exam.

348
00:24:17,687 --> 00:24:19,420
What?

349
00:24:21,287 --> 00:24:23,553
I'm saying that I don't want to take the exam.

350
00:24:23,553 --> 00:24:24,920
I'm not going to college.

351
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,187
Yeah, but why?

352
00:24:27,587 --> 00:24:29,853
Because there isn't anything I want to do.

353
00:24:29,853 --> 00:24:32,053
And I don't want to go anywhere either.

354
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,687
Huh. Then, what will you do after graduating?

355
00:24:34,687 --> 00:24:36,753
Well, I could work part time.

356
00:24:36,753 --> 00:24:38,720
Baek Seung Jo!

357
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,420
Is your life a joke!?

358
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,487
Do you live life however you feel like living it?

359
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,787
Then, how am I supposed to live?

360
00:24:45,787 --> 00:24:46,653
What?

361
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:49,253
Because I don't know how to live...

362
00:24:49,253 --> 00:24:52,187
...is why I say I won't go.

363
00:24:52,187 --> 00:24:56,253
Because I don't want to live like
other people, without any motives.

364
00:24:57,187 --> 00:24:59,953
How should I live?

365
00:24:59,953 --> 00:25:02,220
Aye... Tec... That's...

366
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:07,053
You can study and take over your father's company.

367
00:25:07,053 --> 00:25:10,320
You know that I'm selfish, right?

368
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,020
A business that doesn't fit my liking...

369
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,287
I don't have any plans of working there.

370
00:25:16,287 --> 00:25:18,720
Don't expect anything from me.

371
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,053
Baek Seung Jo!

372
00:25:20,053 --> 00:25:21,887
I'm done eating.

373
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,187
Really... That punk...

374
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,653
He's only saying that; it's not like he won't take it. Don't worry.

375
00:25:34,653 --> 00:25:36,120
Y-y-yeah, right.

376
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,187
No matter what he does, he can do it with ease,
that must be why he doesn't feel any motivation.

377
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:46,053
He has to find a field of interest soon.

378
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,753
I'd really like to experience it too. That feeling.

379
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,187
Min Ah's.

380
00:25:57,187 --> 00:26:00,687
- We'll enjoy the meal!
- We'll enjoy the meal!

381
00:26:01,287 --> 00:26:06,653
Here... I made these for you guys
on such a special occasion.

382
00:26:06,653 --> 00:26:09,053
The name is Bul Nak porridge.

383
00:26:09,053 --> 00:26:10,687
Bul Nak porridge?

384
00:26:10,687 --> 00:26:13,820
It's written right here.
Bul means "not," Nak means "fail". Never fail.

385
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,387
- Ahhh.
- It's really written.

386
00:26:16,387 --> 00:26:17,553
What did you write this with?

387
00:26:17,553 --> 00:26:21,420
You don't know? They're sesame seeds.

388
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,553
So, it means that if you eat this,
you guys will never fail.

389
00:26:24,553 --> 00:26:27,820
Oh really!? Then I'll just have
to eat everything here.

390
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,553
Hey, Jung Ju Ri. Stop it.
Is this all yours?

391
00:26:31,553 --> 00:26:35,153
What? "Ah, is this all yours?"
Is he speaking Japanese?

392
00:26:35,153 --> 00:26:37,987
Jung Ju Ri, just stop it.
Are all these yours?

393
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:39,220
Yeah. She's right right right!

394
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,953
Yes, eat up.

395
00:26:42,653 --> 00:26:44,553
Ha Ni, you aren't eating?

396
00:26:44,553 --> 00:26:45,920
I'm eating.

397
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,753
Ha Ni. What? Are you getting nervous?

398
00:26:48,753 --> 00:26:50,553
There's no need!

399
00:26:50,553 --> 00:26:53,320
Just eat up all this that your dad made for you.

400
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,787
Then just walk down proudly! Right?

401
00:26:55,787 --> 00:26:57,487
Yeah, you too.

402
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:04,320
Ah. Father.

403
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,853
This recipe is just killer!

404
00:27:06,853 --> 00:27:08,453
Is this octopus?

405
00:27:08,453 --> 00:27:10,120
Aigoo, you know well.

406
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,853
Father, I told you last time.

407
00:27:12,853 --> 00:27:16,120
My taste buds are really sensitive.

408
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,087
I can't let it go.

409
00:27:18,087 --> 00:27:22,187
Well, eat a lot! And do well on the test tomorrow.

410
00:27:22,187 --> 00:27:24,287
Like the octopus, stick to (get into) a college.

411
00:27:24,287 --> 00:27:25,887
Yes.

412
00:27:27,453 --> 00:27:28,320
Dad.

413
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,453
Dad.
Yes?

414
00:27:29,453 --> 00:27:32,320
Could you pack one more of this porridge?

415
00:27:41,887 --> 00:27:43,720
Are you sleeping?

416
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,753
Baek Seung Jo.

417
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:55,253
You're going to take that test tomorrow, right?

418
00:27:56,287 --> 00:27:58,553
Everyone is worried about you.

419
00:27:59,087 --> 00:28:01,453
Especially your father.

420
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,687
He keeps worrying about you
and he doesn't laugh very often.

421
00:28:07,087 --> 00:28:12,087
First you could take the test, then later
you can make a decision on college.

422
00:28:13,053 --> 00:28:14,987
If you don't take the test,

423
00:28:14,987 --> 00:28:18,286
but suddenly you figure out what
you want to do, then what will you do?

424
00:28:19,287 --> 00:28:21,986
Open the door for a moment.

425
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,387
You can do anything.

426
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,820
So, you have to use your head
for the sake of other people.

427
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:40,053
I believe that people who have a lot
need to share what they have.

428
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:44,953
Even though I want to share everything,
I don't have anything, so I can't.

429
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,653
This... I'll just leave it here.

430
00:28:55,587 --> 00:28:57,753
Eat it before it cools.

431
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,753
Also...

432
00:29:06,253 --> 00:29:08,187
See you tomorrow.

433
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,853
[Good luck on the test!
Baek Seung Jo is the best!]

434
00:30:28,941 --> 00:30:31,733
Is it a cold? Do you have a cold?

435
00:30:31,733 --> 00:30:32,600
Maybe...

436
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,300
I... I have medicine.

437
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,138
Just a sec...

438
00:30:38,609 --> 00:30:42,042
This one is very effective. It's the best!

439
00:30:43,904 --> 00:30:45,404
Here's some water!

440
00:30:45,404 --> 00:30:47,197
Thank you.

441
00:30:55,149 --> 00:30:57,610
This doesn't cause drowsiness, right?

442
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,711
What?!
What?!

443
00:31:02,633 --> 00:31:06,866
"Do not use in case of driving or
activities that require concentration."

444
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:10,166
Oh! It causes drowsiness!!

445
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:11,600
What to do?!
Spit it out.

446
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,595
Hey, what are you doing?!
Everything you do is like this anyway.

447
00:31:15,595 --> 00:31:20,633
It'll be alright, since you're strong!

448
00:31:20,633 --> 00:31:22,100
Wait!

449
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,200
You guys have to take your packed lunches.

450
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,262
Filled with nutritious food I have...

451
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:31,170
...especially made "Exam Pass" lunches.

452
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,478
Thank you very much.

453
00:31:32,478 --> 00:31:33,966
Thanks, Dad!

454
00:31:33,966 --> 00:31:36,600
Thanks, man. When did you prepare
something like this?

455
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,269
That's right... Thank you very much.

456
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:41,833
Oh, it was no sweat.

457
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:45,166
Wise choice. Good luck!

458
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:46,166
Yes.

459
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:54,966
FIGHTING!!

460
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:58,734
You thought well.
Everyone likes it (the decision to take the test).

461
00:32:00,241 --> 00:32:01,233
Nice boy.

462
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:03,381
Stop joking around.

463
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:05,800
Ah, fork...

464
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,315
Do you think I'm you?
Why would I spear a random answer?

465
00:32:08,315 --> 00:32:12,900
Ah, that's right. I measured your
corn by my own bushel.

466
00:32:14,506 --> 00:32:16,873
- How far are you going to follow me!?
- Huh?

467
00:32:16,873 --> 00:32:19,705
You're that way.

468
00:32:21,077 --> 00:32:24,200
That's right... It's the opposite direction...

469
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,574
Go ahead.

470
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:32,233
I see...
So our paths separate here.

471
00:32:32,233 --> 00:32:37,833
Yeah... Baek Seung Jo needs
to go on his own path.

472
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:41,533
Good luck on your test! FIGHTING!

473
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,600
Aigoo, even so he went.

474
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,000
Yeah...

475
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,998
He's not my son, he's really a godsend...
A godsend!

476
00:33:01,998 --> 00:33:05,785
Up until yesterday, he was being
stubborn and saying he wouldn't take it...

477
00:33:05,785 --> 00:33:09,300
...why all of the sudden...?

478
00:33:12,066 --> 00:33:14,008
I feel uneasy...

479
00:33:15,366 --> 00:33:17,337
Something just makes me uneasy.

480
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,000
STUDENT! STUDENT!

481
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,200
There are only fifteen minutes left.

482
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:57,847
You haven't marked anything yet.

483
00:33:57,847 --> 00:34:00,433
I took some cold medicine this morning...

484
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:31,766
It was totally scary!
The people didn't even smile.

485
00:34:31,766 --> 00:34:35,438
"Why must we accept you?"

486
00:34:35,438 --> 00:34:38,866
Ahh... She was like a witch.

487
00:34:38,866 --> 00:34:40,233
Did you do well on the exam?

488
00:34:40,233 --> 00:34:43,501
- I don't know... I just took it.
- Aigoo.

489
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:46,477
I think I screwed up the entrance exam...

490
00:34:46,477 --> 00:34:48,091
What do I do!

491
00:34:48,091 --> 00:34:55,533
Ha Ni, exams are already over so why are
you complaining? We don't even have class!

492
00:34:55,533 --> 00:34:58,733
What have you been doing right now?

493
00:34:58,733 --> 00:35:00,037
TADA!

494
00:35:00,037 --> 00:35:01,400
You were putting on makeup?

495
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,410
Don't I totally look like Ga-In?
(Brown Eyed Girls member)

496
00:35:10,947 --> 00:35:13,344
Oh, here...

497
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:14,733
You even have fake eyelashes?

498
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,966
Would you like me to put them on for you?

499
00:35:18,966 --> 00:35:20,466
Sit down! Sit down!

500
00:35:21,915 --> 00:35:27,433
Ha Ni, even though you don't have
double eyelids, your eyes are really big.

501
00:35:27,433 --> 00:35:28,315
Close your eyes.

502
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:34,000
If you put some eyelashes on like this...

503
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,300
Open your eyes!

504
00:35:36,148 --> 00:35:40,466
Wow! You look very pretty! Here, look in the mirror.

505
00:35:40,466 --> 00:35:44,400
Jackpot. Hey, Dok Go Min Ah, look. Her eyes look ten times bigger, don't they?

506
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,733
If they were ten times bigger,
she would be a monster.

507
00:35:46,733 --> 00:35:49,366
Should I put it on the other side too?

508
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:53,733
Here. Close your eyes.

509
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,115
Like this.

510
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,454
Hello!

511
00:36:03,268 --> 00:36:04,800
Are you putting on makeup?

512
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,940
It's not makeup...

513
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:10,638
You have the guts to put on makeup
after ruining someone else's life?

514
00:36:10,638 --> 00:36:11,266
Huh?

515
00:36:11,266 --> 00:36:14,878
I heard you gave Seung Jo Oppa sleeping pills
on the morning of the college entrance exam.

516
00:36:14,878 --> 00:36:18,268
What?!
What do you mean?

517
00:36:18,268 --> 00:36:23,400
I heard you gave him cold medicine this morning.

518
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,433
After taking those, he fell asleep and had to
fill in all the answers right before the test was over.

519
00:36:28,433 --> 00:36:32,100
What are you going to do about it? How are you
going to take responsibility for what you've done?

520
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,226
Hey, Hong Jang Mi!!

521
00:36:33,226 --> 00:36:37,538
Because of that, he might not be able to go
to college, but you seem to only care about yourself.

522
00:36:37,538 --> 00:36:41,100
Even like that, you still dare to
say that you like him?

523
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,287
Right?
I'm asking you!

524
00:37:03,635 --> 00:37:05,466
It's okay, right?

525
00:37:05,466 --> 00:37:07,929
You did well, right?

526
00:37:07,929 --> 00:37:10,183
You're the Baek Seung Jo.

527
00:37:10,183 --> 00:37:14,966
No way...
Just because of the medicine?

528
00:37:36,196 --> 00:37:43,633
Tell me it isn't so, please.
That there was nothing wrong.

529
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:54,200
Jae Eun Jung.

530
00:37:56,658 --> 00:37:57,845
Relax.

531
00:37:57,845 --> 00:37:59,791
Kim Su Ahn.

532
00:38:05,933 --> 00:38:10,773
We still have time. Be strong.

533
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:15,003
Kids, in the next four days
your scores will be out.

534
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:15,683
Yes.

535
00:38:15,683 --> 00:38:18,082
Wherever you go, make sure you have your phones.

536
00:38:18,082 --> 00:38:20,451
Yes.

537
00:38:20,451 --> 00:38:23,133
Bong Joon Gu!

538
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:31,253
Oh.

539
00:38:34,665 --> 00:38:37,250
Don't have that sad look on your face, okay?

540
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:40,033
I already have something planned for my life.

541
00:38:40,033 --> 00:38:41,738
Really?
Yes.

542
00:38:42,317 --> 00:38:47,600
So, Ha Ni, even if your scores don't
come out that good...don't worry.

543
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,266
I'll take care of you forever.

544
00:38:50,266 --> 00:38:53,934
HUUUUUUUU...

545
00:38:53,934 --> 00:38:56,959
Bong Joon Gu, that's enough.

546
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,366
She has Baek Seung Jo.

547
00:38:58,366 --> 00:39:01,726
What did you say? Who did you say she has?

548
00:39:01,726 --> 00:39:06,019
That cowardly guy can't make a girl happy.

549
00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:10,100
Then what about you? What can you do for Ha Ni?

550
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,016
What?

551
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,466
What did you just say? An axe comb?

552
00:39:14,466 --> 00:39:17,368
Ah, be quiet! That's enough.

553
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,166
Ha Ni...

554
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:22,333
Fighting!

555
00:39:23,353 --> 00:39:25,100
Be strong!

556
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:36,789
Why?

557
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:38,159
Nothing.

558
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:43,000
After seeing this, I'm wondering
if I really am a genius.

559
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,400
What's wrong, Seung Jo? You're scaring me.

560
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,333
You still have the interview,
so you just have to do that.

561
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:53,530
Ah, should we drop the curtains for you? For getting into Tae San University with the highest score?

562
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:57,900
But honestly, with your skills, going to
Tae San University seems like a waste.

563
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,133
You should be going to some place like Harvard.

564
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:04,139
Anyway, you did well! Seung Jo, great job!

565
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:09,600
Hurray!

566
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,933
He did it!

567
00:40:15,952 --> 00:40:17,532
Oh Ha Ni,

568
00:40:17,532 --> 00:40:20,752
even after getting those scores,
you say "hurray"?

569
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:38,550
But how do I stop myself from being so happy!?

570
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:42,050
Baek Seung Jo HURRAY! Korea HURRAY!

571
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,317
Ring... Ring...

572
00:40:47,317 --> 00:40:49,417
Please... Ring...

573
00:40:49,417 --> 00:40:51,283
It will ring. It will ring.

574
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:53,483
Please, help me.

575
00:40:53,483 --> 00:40:54,917
It will ring.

576
00:40:58,283 --> 00:40:59,717
Hello?

577
00:41:01,093 --> 00:41:02,450
Yes.

578
00:41:05,317 --> 00:41:07,217
This isn't the roast duck restaurant.

579
00:41:07,617 --> 00:41:10,283
The number is 0292, but...

580
00:41:10,283 --> 00:41:12,750
...this isn't the roast duck place.

581
00:41:18,483 --> 00:41:19,817
Hello?

582
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,080
Yes.

583
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,650
Yes, I am Oh Ha Ni.

584
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,850
Oh my!

585
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,823
Parang University?!

586
00:41:26,823 --> 00:41:28,170
Is it right?

587
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,450
Really?

588
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:31,162
Wow, thank you!

589
00:41:31,162 --> 00:41:33,353
Thank you.

590
00:41:33,836 --> 00:41:35,117
What?

591
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:36,489
Oh!

592
00:41:36,489 --> 00:41:38,676
I applied for the social sciences major.

593
00:41:40,283 --> 00:41:41,950
Not the apple department?

594
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,583
Huh?

595
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:45,683
Apple department?

596
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:48,537
There's something like that...

597
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:52,417
Surprise!

598
00:41:52,417 --> 00:41:53,750
Baek Eun Jo!

599
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,750
Oh Ha Ni dummy!

600
00:42:02,383 --> 00:42:04,151
Aiyoo!

601
00:42:04,716 --> 00:42:09,250
Baek Seung Jo is going to
Tae San University with the highest score...

602
00:42:10,283 --> 00:42:13,983
What am I going to do if I don't get into college at all?

603
00:42:28,383 --> 00:42:30,169
Oh, Min Ah.

604
00:42:30,169 --> 00:42:32,450
I got into Parang University.

605
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,245
Really?

606
00:42:34,245 --> 00:42:35,917
Did they call you?

607
00:42:35,917 --> 00:42:37,383
Just now.

608
00:42:37,383 --> 00:42:40,250
Wow, congratulations!

609
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,839
And you, Ha Ni?

610
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:44,150
Not yet.

611
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:46,250
The call will come.

612
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,383
Yes.

613
00:42:47,383 --> 00:42:48,650
Thank you.

614
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:51,517
Just wait. Let's hang up.

615
00:42:51,517 --> 00:42:54,439
Okay. Ah, Min Ah.

616
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:58,450
Once again, super super congratulations.

617
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,217
You did well.

618
00:43:29,436 --> 00:43:31,037
Why?

619
00:43:33,004 --> 00:43:37,302
Someone like me doesn't have the right to eat.

620
00:43:37,402 --> 00:43:39,471
Eat, eat!

621
00:43:39,471 --> 00:43:41,237
Everything will be alright.

622
00:43:41,504 --> 00:43:43,304
It's over.

623
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:46,837
Today's the last day for acceptances to be revealed.

624
00:43:48,837 --> 00:43:51,071
It's already 10:00.

625
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:55,571
I already knew I would not make it.

626
00:43:55,971 --> 00:43:58,080
That witch...

627
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,637
No, that scary professor has no
reason to accept me.

628
00:44:02,804 --> 00:44:05,171
But, I was still thinking I could possibly get in.

629
00:44:05,171 --> 00:44:08,637
Hey, you can still go with the SATs.

630
00:44:08,637 --> 00:44:10,904
You can still get into a couple of places with that.

631
00:44:10,904 --> 00:44:14,037
My scores aren't that good.

632
00:44:19,971 --> 00:44:21,954
Hello!

633
00:44:23,337 --> 00:44:25,437
Yes, it is me.

634
00:44:26,337 --> 00:44:28,104
Parang University?

635
00:44:28,371 --> 00:44:30,547
Hey, this...

636
00:44:30,547 --> 00:44:32,083
It's you again, Baek Eun Jo!

637
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:34,237
What?

638
00:44:34,237 --> 00:44:36,137
Why did you call my name?

639
00:44:37,171 --> 00:44:38,671
Oh my!

640
00:44:39,071 --> 00:44:40,562
Hello.

641
00:44:40,562 --> 00:44:42,104
Yes.

642
00:44:42,104 --> 00:44:43,404
Yes, it is me.

643
00:44:43,404 --> 00:44:46,237
I'm sorry, I thought it was a prank call.

644
00:44:46,237 --> 00:44:49,811
Just now, another person gave up their enrollment.

645
00:44:49,811 --> 00:44:52,971
Student Oh Ha Ni, you
passed as an additional acceptance.

646
00:44:53,071 --> 00:44:56,704
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes!
I will go, I will go, I will go!

647
00:45:05,837 --> 00:45:09,371
Ah, hurray!

648
00:45:20,471 --> 00:45:23,315
I think I really have good luck.

649
00:45:23,315 --> 00:45:27,250
Because of the typhoon, kids couldn't go.
That's why I got the chance.

650
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,917
What would I have done if
the typhoon hadn't come?

651
00:45:29,917 --> 00:45:31,172
Yeah.

652
00:45:31,172 --> 00:45:34,083
That's not it! It's because of my Bul Nak porridge.

653
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:36,317
That's right. Correct.

654
00:45:42,317 --> 00:45:45,117
Here's a present.

655
00:45:47,317 --> 00:45:49,417
Ahjusshi (Seung Jo's father) picked it out.

656
00:45:50,483 --> 00:45:52,083
It's nothing big.

657
00:45:56,846 --> 00:45:58,283
Wow!

658
00:45:58,283 --> 00:46:00,417
It's really beautiful.

659
00:46:00,417 --> 00:46:02,117
Thank you!

660
00:46:02,117 --> 00:46:02,764
Thank you.

661
00:46:02,764 --> 00:46:04,742
For what?

662
00:46:05,664 --> 00:46:09,097
And this is my present.

663
00:46:09,097 --> 00:46:10,830
There's another one?

664
00:46:16,242 --> 00:46:18,064
These are musical tickets.

665
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,264
I've never seen a musical before.

666
00:46:20,264 --> 00:46:23,830
It's this Saturday. Let's meet in
front of the theater at 2:30.

667
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:25,397
You hold on to the tickets.

668
00:46:25,397 --> 00:46:26,564
You can't forget.

669
00:46:26,564 --> 00:46:28,241
What do you mean forget?

670
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:30,864
Thank you.

671
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,330
Where are you?

672
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:52,430
Oh Ha Ni, you're in front of the theater, right?

673
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:55,597
What should I do? There's so much traffic.

674
00:46:55,597 --> 00:46:57,330
There's no traffic!

675
00:46:58,811 --> 00:47:01,011
Because it's Saturday...

676
00:47:01,211 --> 00:47:03,780
Why don't you go on ahead

677
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,830
and leave one ticket at the booth.

678
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:09,197
Yes, I'll do that.

679
00:47:17,097 --> 00:47:18,264
Hello.

680
00:47:18,264 --> 00:47:20,164
Could I leave one ticket with you?

681
00:47:20,164 --> 00:47:21,764
Ah... Yes.

682
00:47:27,764 --> 00:47:31,930
The idol of every Korean girl, the Crown Prince...

683
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:38,030
Together with him, a new dream world
of the 21st century opens up to you now!

684
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:06,260
And so, the Royal Palace in year of the 52nd Hwang Hwa Year, that is year 1996,

685
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:10,250
Crown Prince Lee Soo suddenly rose to the sky from a traffic accident, no, I mean, he rose to the heavens.

686
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:18,690
But, Your Highness, your subject here... Oh, the Crown Prince is now Lee Shin.

687
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:22,070
Oh, sorry about that!

688
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:26,520
It is tough on the cast.

689
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:30,310
The monster of the Royal Palace, that enters the next phase...

690
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,460
Pass!

691
00:48:57,797 --> 00:49:02,997
♪ I don't remember from when it was♪

692
00:49:02,997 --> 00:49:08,030
♪ When I started to keep thinking about you. ♪

693
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:13,030
♪ Twice, the thoughts would come♪

694
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:20,264
♪ They kept getting bigger and I was a little surprised♪

695
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:26,964
Ah...it hurts.

696
00:49:28,697 --> 00:49:31,997
Why? You want me to pinch them for you?

697
00:49:33,497 --> 00:49:36,597
But, how did you come?

698
00:49:36,597 --> 00:49:39,197
How do you think I came?

699
00:49:39,197 --> 00:49:40,030
How?

700
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:43,483
Eun Jo, your mom is a really good actress, huh?

701
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:48,064
You heard me on the phone right?
"I'm in front of the theater, and I got stood up."

702
00:49:48,064 --> 00:49:49,630
I have no one to see it with.

703
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:54,364
So, he said he got it and would come,
that great Baek Seung Jo.

704
00:49:57,097 --> 00:49:59,397
Should I just be an actress?

705
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:02,530
Was it really...

706
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:04,664
...just because of your acting?

707
00:50:04,664 --> 00:50:06,297
Huh?

708
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:16,764
Excuse me.

709
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,900
You're going to do the
interview for Tae San University, right?

710
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:29,364
Why are you being like that too?

711
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:36,764
I don't get why people
keep saying college, college, college.

712
00:50:37,197 --> 00:50:41,364
You're smart because you have something to offer.

713
00:50:41,364 --> 00:50:43,064
It has to be that way.

714
00:50:43,064 --> 00:50:48,764
Well, if I say "find your dream,"
it sounds huge, but...

715
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:52,230
...just have fun living.

716
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:53,397
Have fun.

717
00:50:53,397 --> 00:50:55,164
Fun?

718
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:00,564
My grandma used to say that all the time.

719
00:51:00,564 --> 00:51:04,664
"Ha Ni, have fun living, fun."

720
00:51:04,664 --> 00:51:07,364
"You have fun and make others happy."

721
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:09,564
She said it'd be fine as long as I live like that.

722
00:51:09,964 --> 00:51:11,430
Fun?

723
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:16,397
If you come to Parang University,
I'll make it fun for you.

724
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,000
Oh, it's so nervewracking.

725
00:51:26,467 --> 00:51:27,900
Just a bit more.

726
00:51:28,267 --> 00:51:32,567
No, no. This way, this way. To the left.

727
00:51:32,567 --> 00:51:35,022
Just a bit, just a bit. Straight.

728
00:51:35,642 --> 00:51:36,610
It's good, it's good!

729
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:39,933
You got it! You got it!

730
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:49,267
You got it!

731
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,027
Aren't you going to take it?

732
00:52:02,601 --> 00:52:05,162
Would I have gotten it so I could play with it?

733
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,667
Ha Ni! Ha Ni!

734
00:52:11,667 --> 00:52:15,100
Come here! Come here!

735
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:16,967
What are you doing?

736
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,167
You guys went to a musical?

737
00:52:19,167 --> 00:52:21,525
Think I'll go crazy.

738
00:52:21,525 --> 00:52:24,690
Ha Ni, did he make a move on you?

739
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:25,495
Make a move?

740
00:52:25,495 --> 00:52:29,668
I mean like while you guys were eating popcorn,
doing hand motions like this or...

741
00:52:29,668 --> 00:52:33,622
When watching a musical, you don't eat popcorn.

742
00:52:33,622 --> 00:52:36,200
Oh, really? Then what do you eat?

743
00:52:36,936 --> 00:52:38,011
Oh!

744
00:52:38,011 --> 00:52:41,700
Did you buy a doll? Wow, it even talks.

745
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:46,363
This... Seung Jo got it for me,
from that doll vending machine.

746
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:47,090
What?

747
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:49,628
He gave it to me as a congratulatory
gift for getting into college.

748
00:52:49,628 --> 00:52:51,479
Congratulatory gift?

749
00:52:51,479 --> 00:52:56,687
He gave you such cheap trash?
Hey, Baek Seung Jo, are you making fun of Ha Ni?

750
00:52:56,687 --> 00:53:01,900
What's wrong with this? And he got it himself.

751
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,475
Hey! You know how difficult
doll vending machines are.

752
00:53:04,475 --> 00:53:07,233
Ha Ni, what's hard about that?

753
00:53:07,233 --> 00:53:09,900
Stuff like that, anyone can do it.

754
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,037
Really?

755
00:53:12,077 --> 00:53:14,427
This was my first time seeing it.

756
00:53:19,582 --> 00:53:20,550
Wow.

757
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:24,165
Hey! Hey, did you see it!? It was totally cool!

758
00:53:24,165 --> 00:53:27,987
Here... Here...
Watch this.

759
00:53:52,517 --> 00:53:54,405
Hey! Where are you going?

760
00:53:54,405 --> 00:53:55,466
Look at this! Look at this!

761
00:53:55,466 --> 00:53:59,009
Urgh really! Such a bother.

762
00:53:59,831 --> 00:54:02,864
Here. Look, look, look, look!

763
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:08,785
Urgh!!

764
00:54:09,242 --> 00:54:12,686
Let me go, let me go, let me go.

765
00:54:23,197 --> 00:54:27,152
Hey look! That's not how it's done.

766
00:54:28,824 --> 00:54:29,785
Ah!

767
00:54:29,785 --> 00:54:34,814
Is this what I see a lot in movies?

768
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,038
Look at me.

769
00:54:56,038 --> 00:55:00,140
Look in my eyes. In my eyes and
in my heart, there is only you.

770
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,580
No.

771
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:05,527
I can't have both feelings in my heart.

772
00:55:05,527 --> 00:55:10,264
Then I have no choice.
Whether it's by using love or using strength,

773
00:55:10,264 --> 00:55:13,987
I have to make you love me.

774
00:55:15,391 --> 00:55:16,866
Leave her alone.

775
00:55:27,124 --> 00:55:29,733
No, please don't.

776
00:55:29,733 --> 00:55:31,069
If you do, I will be scared for you.

777
00:55:31,069 --> 00:55:36,867
A coward can die many times,
but a real man can only die once.

778
00:55:37,123 --> 00:55:42,833
If I die for you, that is not my death...

779
00:55:42,833 --> 00:55:45,171
...it is love.

780
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,600
No!

781
00:56:32,656 --> 00:56:38,664
Un Deux, Un Deux, Un Deux (One, Two).

782
00:56:38,664 --> 00:56:40,233
What?

783
00:56:51,288 --> 00:56:54,800
Son, do well! Fighting!

784
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:59,167
Even if someone is rude to you, just let it be.

785
00:56:59,167 --> 00:57:02,431
Do...do your best.

786
00:57:02,431 --> 00:57:04,939
Good luck, Hyung. Fighting!

787
00:57:04,939 --> 00:57:06,780
Right.

788
00:57:26,034 --> 00:57:29,700
After making me upset over going
and not going, it's all over now.

789
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:34,110
Ah, this is so sad! Why must they go
through all of this at such a beautiful age?

790
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:37,431
You got married at that age.

791
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:50,533
Why are they going on and
on about college? I just don't get it.

792
00:57:56,218 --> 00:57:56,867
Ha Ni!

793
00:57:56,867 --> 00:57:58,233
Where are you going?

794
00:57:58,233 --> 00:58:02,233
This isn't going to work. My heart won't stop racing.
I'll just keep an eye on him until he goes into the exam hall.

795
00:59:18,455 --> 00:59:20,405
Hey, did you see that?
That car totally hit someone!

796
00:59:20,405 --> 00:59:22,920
It looks like it hit a girl.

797
01:00:03,014 --> 01:00:04,127
She's waking up.

798
01:00:04,127 --> 01:00:05,381
Ha Ni!

799
01:00:06,342 --> 01:00:09,932
Aigoo! My daughter! Aigoo!

800
01:00:10,746 --> 01:00:12,765
Dad.

801
01:00:13,579 --> 01:00:15,312
Where is this place?

802
01:00:15,312 --> 01:00:17,084
It's the hospital.

803
01:00:17,084 --> 01:00:21,170
You were in a traffic accident.
Don't you remember?

804
01:00:22,812 --> 01:00:24,537
You pooong...

805
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:26,255
I remember.

806
01:00:27,356 --> 01:00:28,059
What about Seung Jo?

807
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:34,468
He went to take the test, of course.

808
01:00:34,468 --> 01:00:36,737
That's a relief.

809
01:00:36,737 --> 01:00:38,701
You came?

810
01:01:10,538 --> 01:01:12,781
Is Ha Ni still being like that?

811
01:01:12,781 --> 01:01:14,012
Are you running away?

812
01:01:14,012 --> 01:01:15,969
Then, bye.

813
01:01:19,702 --> 01:01:22,650
Can you please teach me? Please, Father...

814
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:25,390
It was fun. What could happen today...

815
01:01:28,338 --> 01:01:29,732
So?

816
01:01:29,732 --> 01:01:31,364
Baek Seung Jo?!

817
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,800
Oh Ha Ni, come here.

818
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:44,100
That brat. He's going to make noodles.
Why do you like someone like that?

Do not beittle the true heart of liking a person

820
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,200
Oh Ha Ni!

821
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,400
You come here.

822
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:50,600
That hurts!

823
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,300
Let me go! I will stop having a crush on you!

824
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:54,700
