1
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,040
How could I trust that stupid woman?

2
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,880
really poison you to death?

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,000
But

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,080
she can provoke you completely.

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,680
and let you kill her.

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,080
I told you

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,360
there are laws in the mortal world.

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,440
A life for a life.

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,880
The government will be here soon.

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,880
You couldn't kill me just now.

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,680
Now you're going to be killed by me.

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,400
Fu An.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,880
You are a soft-hearted fool.

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,440
Father died because of his trusted subordinates.

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,600
You still can't learn

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,760
All you think about is saving the villagers.

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,760
I even wanted to get the seal

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,560
to save them.

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,400
Tell me.

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,960
Are you crazy?

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,440
I...

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,120
Fu Qing.

23
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:13,320
I just want to plan for myself.

24
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,560
Anyone who stops me

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,880
will die.

26
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,000
Including you.

27
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,200
Chang Feng.

28
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,800
I lost.

29
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,200
Now,

30
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,640
you're still a woman.

31
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,560
Do you know

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,320
your brother is the one who wants to kill you?

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,080
Because he is my brother.

34
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,479
We grew up together.

35
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,360
We lived together.

36
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,720
I know him.

37
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,840
He's not an evil person.

38
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,120
He is your brother.

39
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,400
What does it have to do with me?

40
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,160
This scourge

41
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,120
must be killed.

42
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,080
Chang Feng.

43
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,479
Don't forget our promise.

44
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,400
You promised me

45
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,840
you won't kill anyone.

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,600
Besides,

47
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,520
he's my family.

48
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,440
If you

49
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,400
in daily life,

50
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,560
I can do whatever you want.

51
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,320
But if you dare to hurt Qing,

52
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,000
I will never agree.

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,600
Even if I destroy my body,

54
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,320
even if I destroy my body.

55
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,200
But you can't tell right from wrong?

56
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,520
Do you know he wants to kill you, Fu An?

57
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,360
Look carefully.

58
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,079
who caused the wound in your heart.

59
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,960
If I didn't take a hint to protect myself,

60
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,280
you would be dead now.

61
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,280
Can't it wake you up?

62
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,880
Okay.

63
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,680
Let's make a bet.

64
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,920
and see if your brother

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,280
can be saved.

66
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:34,840
Okay.

67
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,360
Deal.

68
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,480
Your brother trusted you so much.

69
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,560
How could you do this to him?

70
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,320
I see.

71
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,520
This is just a trap you set for me.

72
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,120
So what?

73
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,600
We're at most even.

74
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,960
Everything in the Wang family is still in my hands.

75
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,760
I still didn't lose.

76
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,600
Qing.

77
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
Why?

78
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,920
I love you so much.

79
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,400
I give you everything I have.

80
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,960
Even if you don't love me,

81
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,800
or hate me,

82
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,400
It doesn't matter.

83
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,960
But you shouldn't use me.

84
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,640
to make me

85
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,840
who destroyed the Wang family

86
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,680
who killed my mother.

87
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,200
You deserve to die.

88
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,400
You must die.

89
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,840
You must die.

90
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,960
Be good.

91
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,480
It won't hurt later.

92
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,399
It won't hurt later.

93
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,160
It doesn't hurt anymore.

94
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,880
I can't accept it.

95
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,680
In my life,

96
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,440
in my life.

97
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,040
Is this the cause of the Wang family?

98
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,600
Chang Feng.

99
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,320
What's wrong?

100
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,760
I was so stupid.

101
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,520
I thought

102
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,880
I could stop it.

103
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,400
the power of the holy fruit.

104
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,640
I'm sorry.

105
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,600
I'm sorry.

106
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,400
The power of the holy fruit!

107
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,920
Chang Feng.

108
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,160
Chang Feng.

109
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,280
Chang Feng, wake up.

110
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,720
Chang Feng.

111
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,720
Chang Feng.

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,240
Chang Feng, wake up.

113
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,000
Chang Feng.

114
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,040
Can you stop sleeping?

115
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,120
How dare you!

116
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,320
How dare you!

117
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,400
How dare you

118
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,840
for a sinner?

119
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,760
Master.

120
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,000
I accept the punishment.

121
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,360
I'll accept any punishment.

122
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,720
But I don't want him to die.

123
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,600
Please save him.

124
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,440
Please, Master.

125
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,680
Master, please save him.

126
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,760
He won't die.

127
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,760
I mean,

128
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,720
Fu An won't die.

129
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,280
But as a sinner,

130
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,680
he often uses the power of the holy fruit,

131
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,800
will only get backfired.

132
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,640
His soul will disappear.

133
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,080
The holy fruit is back.

134
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,200
What is...

135
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,560
disappear

136
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,840
is the heaven and the mortal world.

137
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,400
will never exist again.

138
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,760
Silly Tao Yao.

139
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,280
Stop being stubborn.

140
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,600
Take the holy fruit

141
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,560
and go back to Guo Shen Mountain with me.

142
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,320
I'm not going.

143
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,320
I want him to live.

144
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,840
I want him to live freely.

145
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,960
He came to the mortal world.

146
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,760
No one remembers him.

147
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,920
Only me.

148
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,760
He doesn't even have his own body.

149
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,160
Are you stupid?

150
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,920
After watching so many farces in the mortal world,

151
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,760
Why haven't you figured it out?

152
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,920
Love

153
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,240
is the most fragile.

154
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,400
Immortals don't need it.

155
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,200
But we need...

156
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,440
We need to support each other.

157
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,159
We need to share weal and woe.

158
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,520
We need to live and die together.

159
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,800
instead of being an indifferent individual

160
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,120
in Shangqing Divine Realm.

161
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,720
eternal loneliness.

162
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,040
I'm so stupid.

163
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,520
You can't even save me.

164
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,840
how could you save him?

165
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,160
This time,

166
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,920
I won't leave him alone.

167
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,360
You...

168
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,960
You're awake.

169
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,840
How long did I sleep?

170
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,880
One day and one night.

171
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,000
The sun has set again.

172
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,200
I'm sorry.

173
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,600
I neglected the backfire of the power of the holy fruit.

174
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,480
and made you like this.

175
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,160
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,400
I'm a disqualified Priest.

177
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,200
I can't take care of you.

178
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,120
It's okay.

179
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,720
I want to share a few secrets with you.

180
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,040
Go ahead.

181
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,560
the first person I met

182
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,280
the first person I met was you.

183
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,600
At that time,

184
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,560
I thought

185
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,400
this little fairy

186
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,520
is so pretty.

187
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,400
When she cries,

188
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,600
when crying.

189
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,080
I know.

190
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,720
Actually,

191
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,920
don't blame yourself.

192
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,080
Helping the villagers

193
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,520
is my promise to deal with An.

194
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,800
I know.

195
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,440
It has nothing to do with you.

196
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,800
I know.

197
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,480
I really envy Fu An

198
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,240
to marry you.

199
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,360
The No.1 Goddess of Guo Shen Mountain.

200
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,400
Tao Yao.

201
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,400
From now on,

202
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,440
I'll be your wife.

203
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,680
Actually, I'm never afraid of death.

204
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,760
I just want

205
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,720
to let you live.

206
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,520
Someone used to give everything to pursue freedom.

207
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,400
But they are willing to die

208
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,560
for ten thousand years.

209
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,520
Chang Feng.

210
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,400
Chang Feng.

211
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,360
Xiao Yao.

212
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,480
Have you really made up your mind?

213
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,280
to exchange your Immortal perception

214
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,360
with your Immortal perception.

215
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,840
This isn't a joke.

216
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,400
I won't be more serious than I am now.

217
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,160
Someone once thought

218
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,960
all kinds of operas in the world

219
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,480
No origin

220
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,800
and no ending.

221
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,920
But unexpectedly,

222
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,480
At first sight,

223
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,960
since the first sight.

224
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,160
Look at this.

225
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,800
Give me a hand.

226
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,560
Make way

227
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
Look

228
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,640
There's everything

229
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,960
Look.

230
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,600
What do you think?

231
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,840
Okay, I'll pack it for you.

232
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,120
Take care.

233
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,720
Come and have a look.

234
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,520
Give me two pieces.

235
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,400
Okay.

236
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,280
Again.

237
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:53,920
Okay.

238
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,520
Two people upstairs.

239
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,640
Boss.

240
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,200
How much is hawthorn cake?

241
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,920
Shengnan.
