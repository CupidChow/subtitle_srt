1
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,320
Mother!

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,920
Mother!

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,920
What happened?

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,760
I heard you killed my father.

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,360
Leave us.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:26,880
Yes.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,920
We still have a lot of work to do.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,680
Leave us.

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,120
You brat.

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,720
You still know to come back?

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,600
Why didn't you show up after your mother died?

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,760
Mother, I know I was wrong.

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,680
I'm just worried about Qing.

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,280
There was no money on the way.

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,600
So I accompanied him for a while.

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,800
I heard something happened at home.

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,280
so I came back right away.

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,200
Look at you.

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,280
You must have suffered a lot.

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,880
Your face is thinner.

21
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,720
I didn't eat or drink on the way.

22
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,200
I gave all my money to Qing.

23
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,240
I'm starving.

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:06,840
Put it down.

25
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,480
I'll ask the kitchen

26
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,600
ask the kitchen to cook something delicious for you

27
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,480
Food?

28
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,520
Mother, how did Father die?

29
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,240
What happened to the case?

30
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,800
Why are you asking?

31
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,600
It's all in the past.

32
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,720
Constable Xing.

33
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,600
Didn't I tell you yesterday that

34
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,640
I can take the lawsuit.

35
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,640
But I don't accept the evidence.

36
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,400
What a joke.

37
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,320
The purchase record of Blood May Cry is clear.

38
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,400
Why don't you admit it?

39
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,000
I was wondering who it was.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,520
Young Lady Yu Zhu actually knows to return.

41
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,800
I thought

42
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,440
you and Mr. Fu have been wandering around the world.

43
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,160
Stop acting weird here.

44
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,760
Did you spread

45
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,960
spread by you?

46
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,320
Miss Rong.

47
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,800
You have no evidence.

48
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,640
You can't defame my innocence.

49
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,480
Miss,

50
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,880
I'm afraid you don't know how it works.

51
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,880
Bloody Shadow can cure weak muscles and bones.

52
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,440
Master has been lying on bed all year long.

53
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,400
What's wrong with taking this medicine?

54
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,200
As for you,

55
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,480
You added blood into the medicinal diet without permission

56
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,880
and caused his death.

57
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,720
You knew that using blood as the ingredient,

58
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,840
but you still used this prescription.

59
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,040
with this prescription.

60
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,040
Master's prescription

61
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,560
will be changed based on his body.

62
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,320
You don't serve him in bed all the time.

63
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,560
So I didn't know.

64
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,880
Now you blame me.

65
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,720
That day, I knew he changed the prescription

66
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,960
so I didn't ask you to deliver blood.

67
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,240
You're lying.

68
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,520
You're the one who made Uncle Li...

69
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,040
What's wrong?

70
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,600
I have nothing to say.

71
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,520
Uncle Li is your trusted aide.

72
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,160
why would he testify for me?

73
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,400
Although you killed Master wrongly,

74
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,040
you did it unintentionally.

75
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,840
If Master were in heaven,

76
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,320
he wouldn't want to see the Wang family suffer.

77
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,080
I'll let it slide.

78
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,560
I just hope you can remember

79
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,079
From now on,

80
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,560
be careful with your words and actions.

81
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,160
What's so surprising?

82
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,040
People are cunning.

83
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,560
I believe there is justice in this world.

84
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,680
One day,

85
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,400
everyone will know the truth.

86
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,960
One day,

87
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,200
one day.

88
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,680
A hundred years later,

89
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,640
you and Wang Xiaodie will be cursed.

90
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,720
and die together.

91
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,280
What's the point of this?

92
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,120
It can make your grassgrass grow taller.

93
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,680
Wake up.

94
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,960
In this world,

95
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
People like you

96
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,760
will be eaten to death if you go out.

97
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,040
I told you before.

98
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,400
If you want the seal,

99
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,600
I can get it for you.

100
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,040
Why bother?

101
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,840
You want to save Master Wang.

102
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,200
Can you save him?

103
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,160
After the funeral tomorrow,

104
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,120
after tomorrow's funeral.

105
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,920
Don't be reckless.

106
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,360
Don't hurt others.

107
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,040
My condolences.

108
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,560
Is it fun?

109
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,480
You killed my father.

110
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:37,560
You don't have the right to put on mourning for him.

111
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,880
After the funeral,

112
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,280
I'll ask my mother to kick you out.

113
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,159
Really?

114
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,080
Young Lady Rong killed someone!

115
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,880
She killed someone!

116
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,280
I...

117
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,640
You want to kill me?

118
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,080
I didn't.

119
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,120
Young Lady Rong wanted to kill me.

120
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,040
I didn't kill anyone

121
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,880
No

122
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,760
Young Lady Rong wants to kill me.

123
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,360
She wants to kill me?

124
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,960
Wang Xiaodie, shut up!

125
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,640
Miss Rong wants to kill me.

126
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,320
It really wasn't me

127
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,000
She wanted to kill me.

128
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,160
She did it herself.

129
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,560
What happened?

130
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,520
Mother.

131
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,120
It wasn't me.

132
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,240
She came up on her own.

133
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,040
I know you think

134
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't deserve to help my father.

135
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,640
That's why you hurt me.

136
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,159
What are you talking about?

137
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,320
Since young,

138
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,800
you've never liked me.

139
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,480
I'll beat you to death!

140
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,000
Wang Xiaodie!

141
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,120
You wronged me, didn't you?

142
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,720
I'll tear your mouth.

143
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,360
Do you know

144
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,720
if I wronged you.

145
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,320
But...

146
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,800
But I didn't hurt you.

147
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,800
I only cut your clothes.

148
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,080
Lady Ruan.

149
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,160
Everyone here saw it with your own eyes.

150
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,000
Stop quibbling.

151
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,240
No one believes you.

152
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,840
You don't believe me, right?

153
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,000
I told you.

154
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,160
I didn't.

155
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,840
How dare you!

156
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,080
Who allowed you to mess around at your father's funeral?

157
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,240
Apologize.

158
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,480
I'm sorry.

159
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,560
Sorry, everyone.

160
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,240
Sorry for making you laugh.

161
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,400
This family is a disgrace.

162
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,120
I don't want to make it public.

163
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,240
I just want

164
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,960
he could be buried safely.

165
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,080
Poor us.

166
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,960
Don't worry.

167
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,880
We won't say anything

168
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,040
about what happened today.

169
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,480
Don't worry, Madam.

170
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
My condolences.

171
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,400
We won't talk nonsense.

172
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,840
Yes, we won't.

173
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,160
Xiaodie.

174
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,160
What you did just now was too risky.

175
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,040
You're the most prideful.

176
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,480
Today, I'll let all of them know

177
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,280
the mother and daughter mistreated me.

178
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,560
When we divide the property,

179
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,080
if she takes all the property,

180
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,680
the rumor will be true.

181
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,520
will be stabbed in the back.

182
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,960
But even so,

183
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,120
you can't bet on your body.

184
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,000
The bet is big enough to win more.

185
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,159
If it's Changfeng,

186
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,400
he would praise me for my good work.

187
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,120
You're really different.

188
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,120
I asked you to find the holy fruit in the mortal world.

189
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,360
How dare you think about his money?

190
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,640
Why are you fighting over the family property?

191
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,360
Wang Xiaodie deserved it.

192
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,360
Why can't I fight for it?

193
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,240
Mr. Wang earns unjust money.

194
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,800
Although he's dead,

195
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,960
the retribution is still there.

196
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,320
Whoever takes that money

197
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,800
will be punished.

198
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,320
Got it.

199
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,720
You're so troublesome.
