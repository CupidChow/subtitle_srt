1
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,079
Damn it!

2
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,640
Let me know who

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,880
who stole my stuff,

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,600
I will break his tendon.

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,640
Madam.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,120
I don't know if I should say this.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,640
Since we've come this far,

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,640
what else should I say?

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,680
If we report to the government

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,200
If we report it to the government,

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,400
everyone will know it.

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,760
Maybe

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,560
relatives who hit the autumn breeze will come back.

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,520
We've been telling the public that

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,600
our family's financial unstable.

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,760
Did that bitch and her wife

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,560
Did they split up?

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,360
Yes.

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,880
The finance is unstable.

20
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,400
and Master was killed.

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,760
The expenses are huge.

22
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,040
Of course there's no property to share.

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,200
Right?

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,760
Yes.

25
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,400
With my skills,

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,880
to sneak into the mansion to get something.

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,280
to get something.

28
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,880
Now we have the seal.

29
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,120
You can also find a way

30
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,840
you can find a way

31
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,680
to solve it.

32
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,080
Xiaodie is calm and sensible.

33
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,680
She treats me very friendly.

34
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,479
You want to pretend to be her wife

35
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,720
and take her as your wife.

36
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,920
Don't be naive.

37
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,920
You two are totally different.

38
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,039
Do you misunderstand Xiaodie?

39
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,120
She's actually a good girl.

40
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,640
I really like her.

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,000
Me too.

42
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,280
You finally admitted

43
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,680
Your special towards Wang Xiaodie

44
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,880
is not my imagination.

45
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,240
Let's give Xiaodie the right to choose.

46
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,800
She's not Xiaodie.

47
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,000
She's the goddess, Tao Yao.

48
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,480
Okay.

49
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,400
The seal is not here.

50
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,600
It's not here.

51
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,280
It seems that

52
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,680
I have to stay in this mansion.

53
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,840
It's impossible to stay here.

54
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,240
You can go.

55
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,160
I need to check the bag.

56
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,840
Wait.

57
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,480
Why are you so aggressive?

58
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,320
I'm just following the rules.

59
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,680
Wang Xiaodie.

60
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,360
Since you want my bag,

61
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,360
I'll give it to you.

62
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,760
I don't want

63
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,560
these unknown treasures.

64
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,480
I wish your wish will come true.

65
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,560
I also hope

66
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,680
you can get the money

67
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,000
to spend it.

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,560
What a coincidence.

69
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,480
I heard that the branch of the royal mansion has caused a lot of trouble.

70
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,840
I came because I was worried about my brother.

71
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,280
Concubine Liu did go too far.

72
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,680
I don't care about

73
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,560
the Wang family's property anyway.

74
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,960
So you're going out without a penny.

75
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,680
It's more reassuring not to take some things.

76
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:51,960
But for the sake

77
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,200
you and Fu'an are brothers,

78
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,880
I have to remind you.

79
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,000
Greed harms people.

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,320
Stop when you're good.

81
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,560
Let's go.

82
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,640
Wait, Xiaodie.

83
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,360
I forgot something.

84
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,560
I'll wait for you at the door.

85
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,120
Mother.

86
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,960
I'm here.

87
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,120
Let's eat.

88
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,040
Let's eat.

89
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,159
What's wrong?

90
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,280
You don't like it?

91
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,120
I've been eating these dishes for days.

92
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,920
Why don't you change the dishes?

93
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,560
Mother.

94
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,520
Father is dead now.

95
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,760
Those two idols were kicked out.

96
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,800
Our family should have a lot of money.

97
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,520
Why are we spending more and more money?

98
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,840
We're just acting for

99
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,040
who like to take advantage of us.

100
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,240
Mother.

101
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,360
When can we

102
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,120
live a good life?

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,560
What's the rush?

104
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:21,840
Look.

105
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,560
What is this?

106
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,400
This

107
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,000
left by your father.

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,080
The biggest bank account in the capital

109
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,800
in the capital

110
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,120
is enough for us to eat and drink for the rest of our lives.

111
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,040
Really?

112
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,080
So

113
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,440
when the show is over,

114
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,440
our good days

115
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,960
has just begun.

116
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,440
From now on, these are all yours.

117
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay.

118
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,200
You're a drumstick.

119
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,480
Chicken leg?

120
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,360
This house wasn't this shabby before.

121
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,800
Maybe it was raining heavily last night

122
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,560
because of heavy rain.

123
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,720
Can you fix it today?

124
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,000
Let's fix it first.

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,440
If it doesn't work,

126
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,240
we can find an inn tonight.

127
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,880
Forget it then.

128
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,560
We are shy now.

129
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,920
We'd better save it.

130
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,080
Xiaodie, we have money.

131
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,920
Xiaodie, we really have money.

132
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,240
We have money.

133
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,320
Where did you get it?

134
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,080
This is Concubine Liu's jewelry box.

135
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,600
Chang Feng brought it last night.

136
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,840
Sure.

137
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,400
He's really doing big things in silence.

138
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,240
You're such a troublemaker.

139
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,120
Chang Feng.

140
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,360
Are you okay?

141
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,480
I'm fine.

142
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,680
Chang Feng.

143
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,040
Chang Feng.

144
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,320
Chang Feng, what's wrong?

145
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,680
Qing.

146
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,360
Dragonfly.

147
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,520
Long time no see.

148
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,400
You know

149
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,320
You haven't come to see me for so long.

150
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,200
Do you know how much I missed you?

151
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,800
Dragonfly.

152
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,080
Do you think I'm doing well?

153
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,320
I'm living on the streets.

154
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,480
living in the streets.

155
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
But these bitterness

156
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,960
can't withstand the weight of love.

157
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,080
It's incurable.

158
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,560
Qing.

159
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,360
Marry me then.

160
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,000
Let's never be apart again.

161
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,560
My mother said

162
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,000
if I get married,

163
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,520
I'll put the seal my father left me

164
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,760
as my dowry.

165
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,560
This seal has a lot of money

166
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,200
in the first bank in the capital.

167
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,160
I can buy a lot of delicious food.

168
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,400
What seal?

169
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,920
Is there any obvious mark?

170
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,280
That's...

171
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,440
a little bit.

172
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,960
A little?

173
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,400
But your mother won't agree to this marriage.

174
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,400
As long as

175
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,320
we can be together,

176
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,840
No.

177
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,520
she has to agree.

178
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,320
Dragonfly.

179
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,280
I want to be with you,

180
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,480
but reputation is important. I...

181
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,280
For Qing,

182
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,720
for you.

183
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,480
Where have you been

184
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,360
in the middle of the night?

185
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,600
Mother.

186
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,840
My daughter and Qing have become husband and wife.

187
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,240
I will only marry him in the future.

188
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,720
What?

189
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,280
Male.

190
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,440
Male.
