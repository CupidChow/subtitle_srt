1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,120
If you don't give me an answer,

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,000
you're not allowed to leave.

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,000
Let go!

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,440
Let go!

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,480
Let go of me!

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,560
No.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,320
Why are you so stupid?

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,200
You can't save Wang Xiaodie.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,120
But you can let others save you.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,760
You can continue to live.

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,960
When you get the holy fruit,

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,000
you can let her go with her father.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,200
Isn't that perfect?

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,240
Others?

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,200
Isn't this ready-made?

16
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,240
Or you don't want to leave?

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,240
No.

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,440
I was just thinking about how to retrieve the Holy Fruit.

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,400
Is the mark you gave me

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,000
work?

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,760
Why do I get hot when I see Fu'an?

22
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,240
You also feel hot when you see Fu Qing?

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,720
Maybe these two brothers

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,400
for too long.

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:13,920
Someone

26
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,920
accidentally smelled the holy fruit.

27
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,200
causing error in recognition.

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,800
Forget it if it doesn't work.

29
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,520
Are you really looking forward

30
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,560
your story spread throughout the world?

31
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,960
Let me tell you the truth.

32
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,000
Although the Holy Fruit was stolen by that sinner,

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,360
it is most likely

34
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,160
it's not with me.

35
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,080
A sinner can't control the holy fruit.

36
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,479
He will be backfired.

37
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,600
Then why does he look so good

38
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,840
when he fights?

39
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,759
That's right

40
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,200
So,

41
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,400
you have to start with Fu Qing.

42
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,479
the success rate will be higher.

43
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,479
How can I get the holy fruit back?

44
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,560
This holy fruit

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,840
usually turns into a human heart.

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,320
There are two ways

47
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,000
There are two ways.

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,200
The first is the holy fruit in physics.

49
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,720
Take the fruit from the heart.

50
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,960
Say the second one.

51
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,480
The second one.

52
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,080
is to make him fall in love with you.

53
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,200
and give his heart to you willingly.

54
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,840
I still have to die.

55
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,560
The one who did it is different.

56
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,960
Why don't you do it together?

57
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,960
There's always a way.

58
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,760
to succeed, right?

59
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,280
That makes sense.

60
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:34,120
If I dig Fu’an’s heart,

61
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,760
with that sinner,

62
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,880
I won't be able to survive.

63
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,920
If I dig Fu Qing's,

64
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,160
maybe...

65
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,960
It's possible.

66
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,280
Heart-digging Fu.

67
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,320
I thought Miss Xiaodie

68
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,120
has let go of her grudge against Qing.

69
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,320
But now,

70
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,240
I still hate him.

71
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,920
What should we do?

72
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,840
With your guts,

73
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,200
you'll be scared to death ten times a day.

74
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,040
Chang Feng.

75
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,800
I have something important to discuss with you.

76
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,600
Why are you making fun of me?

77
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,200
I was just feeling it.

78
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,000
Now Wang Xiaodie wants to kill Qing.

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,880
I don't know what to do.

80
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,320
Why are you nervous?

81
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,760
With her guts,

82
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,960
Ask her to kill me.

83
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,880
Chang Feng.

84
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,120
Just tell me if you don't want to help me.

85
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,480
It's just that Fu Qing asked you out tomorrow.

86
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,840
You can't refuse.

87
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,079
You're worried that Wang Xiaodie

88
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,600
and hurt your brother.

89
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,440
You want me to protect him for you, right?

90
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,400
I really don't like you.

91
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,320
But for the sake of the holy fruit,

92
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,800
I will reluctantly agree.

93
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,440
Give me your body tomorrow.

94
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,640
The wound was inflamed last night.

95
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,120
and had a high fever.

96
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,720
I'm worried about you.

97
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,800
I'm fine.

98
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,440
By the way,

99
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,440
last night,

100
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,800
when I had a fever,

101
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,360
when I had a fever?

102
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,600
Why do you ask such nonsense?

103
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,640
Nothing.

104
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,840
I was just asking.

105
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,000
You called Qing's name in your dream last night.

106
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,760
I'm dying.

107
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,360
Did he reveal

108
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,680
in your dream?

109
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,280
Why am I so nervous?

110
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,240
Could it be...

111
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,560
you still have feelings for Qing?

112
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,720
What are you talking about?

113
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,160
I don't want to see

114
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,520
your traitor brother.

115
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,000
He's with Wang Xiaorui.

116
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,120
That's great.

117
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,360
Qing asked us to meet today.

118
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,880
If you don't want to go,

119
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,920
I'll reject him.

120
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,160
If I didn't find a way

121
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,600
while Fu is alive,

122
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,160
When he returns to Guatian Village,

123
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,200
the yellow cabbage will be cold.

124
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,440
My dear, that's not appropriate.

125
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,840
No matter how I see Fu Qing,

126
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,560
he is still your brother.

127
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,520
He came all the way to see you.

128
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,520
How can we lose the way to treat you?

129
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,960
We must meet.

130
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,040
Why is my husband so anxious?

131
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,040
Uncle Sheng is still watching.

132
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,200
You're the one who's anxious.

133
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,560
Please.

134
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,520
Thank you, uncle.

135
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,520
You're welcome.

136
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,760
Thank you.

137
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,560
I heard that the Snake Tale today

138
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,280
is your favorite opera.

139
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:41,960
Qing,

140
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,520
Thank you.

141
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,760
Who said that?

142
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,480
My favorite

143
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,800
is a perfect match.

144
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,360
I have a bad memory. Please forgive me.

145
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,200
No.

146
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,040
Do you like green tea?

147
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,080
I'll do it.

148
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,760
Let me do it.

149
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,760
Do you like oranges?

150
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,800
Let me peel one for you.

151
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,040
No need.

152
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,960
Let me peel one for you.

153
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,320
You rarely come out today.

154
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,320
I can't let you have any regrets.

155
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
Uncle, have some oranges.

156
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,640
Uncle.

157
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,200
Thank you, sir.

158
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,960
What are you doing?

159
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,640
Since it's my favorite scene,

160
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,880
I should try it myself.

161
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,920
I don't know how to do it either.

162
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,800
It's okay. I'll teach you.

163
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,520
Tao Yao.

164
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,320
This is not good.

165
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Mura...

166
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,560
Male.
