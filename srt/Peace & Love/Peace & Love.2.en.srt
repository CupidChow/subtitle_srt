1
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,800
You're not Fu Qing.

2
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,240
Bah!

3
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,640
You don’t know where the sinner comes from.

4
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,760
trying to take advantage of me.

5
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,720
No way.

6
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,040
I've informed the Heavenly Soldiers.

7
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,640
They will come to catch you soon.

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,080
Before they come,

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,840
before they come.

10
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,360
Let go!

11
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,280
Little Priest-sama!

12
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,360
You overestimate yourself.

13
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,960
Let go!

14
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,240
The Mingjin warning just now

15
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,640
came from here.

16
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,400
Search inside.

17
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,520
Is it really you?

18
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,240
When did I say

19
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,840
I'm that fool from the Fu family.

20
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,440
Xiao Yao.

21
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,960
You...

22
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,920
You're really something.

23
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,640
After digging the passage in secret last time,

24
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,079
after digging the passage.

25
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,320
Five-day trip to the prison.

26
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,160
You really brought honor to Guo Shen Mountain.

27
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,440
Stop scolding me.

28
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,400
I know.

29
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,880
I know the holy fruit is lost. I'm sorry.

30
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,360
I failed to keep an eye on it.

31
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,280
I failed the reputation of Guo Shen Mountain.

32
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,360
I let you down.

33
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,640
and let the heaven down.

34
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,120
Don't say the same three things.

35
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,720
Let's go through the process.

36
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,200
What can I do to make up for my mistake?

37
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,880
Or...

38
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,840
Hit me first.

39
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,400
You should take the responsibility

40
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,040
Isn't that what you should do?

41
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,200
The most important thing now

42
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,360
is to find the holy fruit.

43
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,520
It concerns the growth of melon fruit in the world.

44
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,960
Once you lose it,

45
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,920
there will be no good result.

46
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,480
During the days you were grounded,

47
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,240
the mortal world has been in chaos.

48
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,760
Isn't this the two sisters of the Wang family?

49
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,640
Yes.

50
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,840
Looks like you know a lot

51
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,640
of the Wang family.

52
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,240
Good.

53
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,600
Now I have found a new identity for you.

54
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,720
You must go to the mortal world to retrieve the holy fruit.

55
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,840
A new identity?

56
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,320
Wang Xiaodie has died.

57
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,360
You can use her identity

58
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,520
to wait for the chance.

59
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,840
What does the holy fruit have to do with the Wang family?

60
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,520
You'll know when you get there.

61
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,320
But I stayed in the prison for five days.

62
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,520
It's like five years in the mortal world.

63
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,000
She's been doing well for the past five years.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,560
Stop lying.

65
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,440
She won't be beaten to death

66
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,320
by her arrogant sister.

67
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,880
But she found a perfect young man.

68
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,920
He's very handsome.

69
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,440
I guess her sister took this man away.

70
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,360
If you see injustice like this,

71
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,520
you can help Wang Xiaodie teach her sister a lesson.

72
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,400
You don't have to.

73
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,240
It's not important to teach Wang Xiaorui a lesson.

74
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,920
It's mainly to find the holy fruit.

75
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,640
The holy fruit is waiting for you.

76
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,160
Go.

77
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,280
What are you doing?

78
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,240
My mother taught me that.

79
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,320
I have to beat you up.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,880
Ever since you came out of the wood room that day,

81
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,880
you've become a different person.

82
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,040
You even learned to fight back.

83
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,920
Do you really think

84
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,840
you'll have a backer after you get married?

85
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,960
I forgot.

86
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,080
Your cheap husband

87
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,000
tried to steal from my house.

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,560
The butler caught me.

89
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,280
He is kneeling in the ancestral hall now.

90
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,160
What kind of attitude is that?

91
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,320
I'm talking to you.

92
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,840
Let me tell you the truth.

93
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,440
I told Fu An

94
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,159
The reason you married him

95
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:36,000
to use his blood to cure my father.

96
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,240
Are you angry?

97
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,440
Let me tell you one more thing.

98
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,120
It was my idea

99
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,640
was also my idea.

100
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,000
You're still dreaming to be together with Qing, aren't you?

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,159
Dream on.

102
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,840
We still have

103
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,240
in the future.

104
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,560
Let's wait and see.

105
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,160
Ouch!

106
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,920
I had something important to do.

107
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,960
But since I came to this shabby house,

108
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,560
I met you people who bully the weak and fear the strong.

109
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,560
You forced me out of my rebellious phase.

110
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,840
What are you doing?

111
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,760
I'll tell my mother.

112
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,040
Good Meimei.

113
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,800
We have plenty of time.

114
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,680
Let's see who dies first.

115
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,720
or I die first.

116
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,640
A tiger falls into the Pingyang and gets bullied by a dog.

117
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,960
If I hadn't lost my power,

118
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,320
you two just wait and see.

119
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,560
You don't have to hide from me.

120
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,280
I already know

121
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,800
I know.

122
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm willing to save my father-in-law.

123
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,400
What's wrong with you?

124
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,640
Whether you acknowledge me as your husband or not,

125
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,400
no matter what your purpose is,

126
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,720
as a wife,

127
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,120
I won't run away.

128
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,280
Wait.

129
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,800
Tell me

130
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,000
what happened last night.

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,600
Why did you steal?

132
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,840
I just want to tell Qing that I'm safe.

133
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,960
I didn't expect I took the wrong way.

134
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,400
Even if the butler locked you up here,

135
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,080
Do you think he really cares about you?

136
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
Your brother

137
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,080
is not a good person.

138
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,240
How could you slander Qing?

139
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,880
Don't you like him?

140
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,240
The only person I like

141
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,880
is myself.

142
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,120
Then why did you marry Qing?

143
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,600
The holy fruit is waiting for you.

144
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,120
Go.

145
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,240
You're so weak.

146
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,360
As Master said, your life is over.

147
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,080
Xiaodie.

148
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,120
I heard you were imprisoned.

149
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,720
I asked the servants

150
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,920
to save you.

151
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,560
I'm sorry.

152
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
I'm sorry.

153
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,160
What's going on?

154
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,600
Didn't he run away with Wang Xiaorui?

155
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,560
Why is he here again?

156
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,480
The holy fruit is more important.

157
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,000
I don't have time to deal with you.

158
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,600
Wang Xiaodie!

159
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,840
You're locked up.

160
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,799
Why don't you behave?

161
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,000
Take your adulterer

162
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,200
come out!

163
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,559
Once this matter is convicted,

164
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,960
I'm afraid before the game starts,

165
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,320
before the game starts.

166
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:46,880
Don't be afraid.

167
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,120
We'll talk when we get out.

168
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,440
We've decided to get married.

169
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,600
It's unreasonable to meet in private,

170
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,680
it's understandable.

171
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,800
Since you've planned it,

172
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,520
I'll play along

173
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,200
and marry you.

174
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,720
to avoid any trouble.

175
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,040
and stop me from finding the holy fruit.

176
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,080
Wang Xiaodie.

177
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,400
Your brother wants to get close to me

178
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,520
and wanted to be close to me.

179
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,680
Then I found that Wang Xiaorui was more favored.

180
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,560
They colluded to frame me.

181
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,400
to frame me for getting married.

182
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,160
and tricked you into marrying me.

183
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,360
to get blood for my father.

184
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,480
Do you really think he's a white flower?

185
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,520
No.

186
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,520
Qing is such a scheming person.

187
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,800
Okay.

188
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,400
Okay.

189
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,920
Just forget what I said.

190
