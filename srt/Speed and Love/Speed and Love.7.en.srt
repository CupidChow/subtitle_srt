[Episode 7]

3
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,139
Where's the keychain Sanlai mentioned?

4
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,230
Come and eat.

5
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,520
Could it be that Jin Zhao has it on him?

6
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,910
Drink your milk.

7
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,680
I don't like milk.

8
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,820
Then eat the egg.

9
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,210
I like eggs even less.

10
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,460
If you don't eat, go back to Jin Qiang's.

11
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,180
Fine.

12
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,200
I'll eat, okay?

13
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,710
You're even stricter than my mom.

14
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,930
I signed my name.

15
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,750
What you signed was a hospital form,

16
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,710
not a life contract.

17
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,880
If you became malnourished
while staying with me,

18
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,280
what would people think?

19
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,750
Finish the fruit too.

20
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,630
That's a lot.

21
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,100
Do you want to go back to Jin Qiang's?

22
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,010
Mr. Lin, you're here.

23
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,600
Who are you?

24
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,930
Don't touch me.

25
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,300
What are you...

26
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,240
Why did you get physical?

27
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,480
What's going on here?

28
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,520
Miss.

29
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,250
Miss Wan.

30
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,159
A few days ago,
your people came to my house

31
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,750
and tried to kidnap my sister.

32
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,750
For this matter,

33
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,280
you owe me an explanation.

34
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,250
My people

35
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,980
kidnapped my friend?

36
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,270
You must have misunderstood.

37
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,150
Ask him.

38
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,680
Mr. Lin, I didn't mean to kidnap her.

39
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,310
I... I was just messing around with her.

40
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:05,750
It's true.

41
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,950
I was messing around.

42
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,750
I'm just messing around too.

43
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,750
Let go.

44
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:10,690
It hurts.

45
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:12,450
Let go.

46
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,100
You've already hit him.

47
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,850
What more do you want?

48
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,950
If you want to be friends with my sister,

49
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,680
that's fine.

50
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,440
But you need to be polite.

51
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,580
If she doesn't want to,

52
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,170
then back off.

53
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,460
Try that again,

54
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,140
and you'll regret it.

55
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,220
Hey, Lin,

56
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,500
what do you mean?

57
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,440
Have you decided?

58
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,360
You're staying here to study?

59
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,310
But

60
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,190
I need to find

61
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,140
a legitimate reason to stay here.

62
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,650
Since my mom insists I go abroad,

63
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,550
going to Canada or staying here

64
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,700
is the same.

65
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,220
Comparatively speaking,

66
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,630
I prefer your country.

67
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,970
It's warm and diverse.

68
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,430
That's great, Mu.

69
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,990
Which university
are you going to apply to?

70
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,300
I haven't decided yet.

71
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,110
I'm not good at languages.

72
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,260
I might need to sign up
for a language foundation course first.

73
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,140
What a coincidence!

74
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,740
My family runs
a language training institute.

75
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,220
We specialize
in less commonly taught languages.

76
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:40,950
Really?

77
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,390
Would you like to sign up
for my family's courses?

78
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,650
I can go and take a look.

79
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,110
This way.

80
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:52,630
This is the language training school

81
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,820
I told you about.

82
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,070
It's so big.

83
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,700
Of course. My family owns it.

84
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,370
Let's go. I'll help you enroll.

85
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,340
That's great.

Welcome to join us.

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,130
See you in class in a few days.

Mu.

90
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,000
Thank you.

91
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,700
You already have some language foundation,

92
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,140
so I enrolled you
in an intermediate class.

93
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,600
This class, which is medium-sized,

94
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,550
mainly consists of Chinese, foreigners,

95
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,070
and Chinese nationals

96
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,930
who are studying abroad like you.

97
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:24,890
Come this way.

98
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,340
But listen,

99
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,910
to master a language,

100
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,630
besides taking the foundation course,

101
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,159
the most important thing is

102
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,780
to communicate frequently

103
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,240
with local people like us.

104
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,890
But you always speak Chinese.

105
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,870
I've never heard you speak
the local language.

106
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,550
Don't worry.

107
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,070
Don't overthink it.

108
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,950
What do they mean?

109
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,110
Don't worry. Don't overthink it.

110
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,870
Don't worry.

111
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,040
Don't worry.

112
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,470
Come on, repeat after me.

113
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,270
Don't worry.

114
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,710
Don't wo-

-rry.

116
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,460
Don't overthink it. Lift your tone.

117
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,330
Don't overthink it.

118
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,320
Right. Now say them all together.

119
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,920
Don't worry. Don't overthink it.

120
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,430
Very good!

121
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,700
I can speak it too.

122
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,310
Go ahead.

123
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,900
So beautiful.

124
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,990
So beautiful.

125
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,260
Thank you.

126
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,430
Right. Thank you.

127

128
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:18,950
Also...

129
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,840
Gently, gently.

130
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,580
You get massages quite often, don't you?

131
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,340
What else?

132
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,220
Kiss.

133
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,410

-Kiss.

134

-Kiss. Kiss.
-Kiss.

It’s almost time for the race.

136
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,960
Is your car ready?

137
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,020
It still needs two important parts.

138
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,390
I can't find them anywhere in the city.

139
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,250
You're probably being targeted.

140
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,070
You have to tough it out this time.

141
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,190
I have confidence.

142
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,340
This race is crucial.

143
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,700
If you're placed in the top 3,

144
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,700
you'll get into the top 10 by points.

145
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,760
The door is closed.

146
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,310
Doesn't he know you're coming back today?

147
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,110
He definitely did it on purpose.

148
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,460
He just doesn't want me to live here.

149
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,510
This guy

150
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,950
doesn't know how to treat a lady at all.

151
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,170
Exactly.

152
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,480
Why don't you stay at my place?

153
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,470
My mom would love you.

154
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,700
Never mind, Nana.

155
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,580
I'd better go back to my dad's place.

156
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,190
I need him to talk with my mom

157
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,740
about follow-up.

158
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,000
Alright. I'll take you there.

159
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Thanks, Nana.

160
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,420
Dad?

161
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,900
Dad, open the door!

162
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,620
You stepped on my hand.

163
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,580
I didn't even cry out in pain.

164
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,260
Why did you shout?

165
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,070
Dad?

166
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,720
Dad, it's really you.

167
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,850
Why are you sleeping here?

168
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,820
It's nice here. It's cool.

169
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,720
Why did you drink so much again?

170
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,740
Let's go.

171
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,540
Let's go home. Don't sleep here.

172
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,500
The electrical circuit at home
is burned out.

173
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,700
There's no electricity.

174
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,690
The air conditioner is not working.

175
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,030
Why don't you fix it?

176
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,770
I can't be bothered to fix it.

177
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,070
You can ask Jin Zhao to fix it.

178
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,030
Let's go. Don't sleep here.

179
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,170
This place has too many mosquitoes
and is not safe.

180
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,290
Get up.

181
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,100
Get up.

182
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,400
Mrs. Zhao, where did you go?

183
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,220
I took Xin to the countryside.

184
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,240
We're going back tomorrow.

185
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,040
What's wrong?

186
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,620
You're going back to live?

187
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,010
The key

188
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,050
is under the flowerpot by the door.

189
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,950
Open the door and let yourself in.

190
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,220
No. My father fell asleep
next to garbage bins.

191
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,350
I can't drag him away. What should I do?

192
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,420
He did it again?

193
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,310
Just ignore him.

194
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,390
He sleeps everywhere.

195
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,390
Just leave him be.

196
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,050
No way.

197
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,500
He... He can't sleep here.

198
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,700
It's not safe,
and there are too many mosquitoes.

199
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,190
Alright, leave him be.

200
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,960
When he sobers up, he'll go home.

201
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,750
Okay, I'll hang up now.

202
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,760
Dad, wake up.

203
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,220
Don't sleep here.

204
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:33,740
Wake up.

205
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,050
What are you doing?

206
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,780
Where did you go?

207
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,110
I went out to take care of something.

208
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,210
Are you

209
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,740
planning to let him sleep here tonight?

210
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,420
You even made a careful preparation.

211
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,740
What else could I do?

212
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,500
Dad is completely drunk.

213
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,070
I can't drag him away.

214
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,620
If I don't cover him,

215
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,420
he'll get bitten by mosquitoes.

216
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,690
He's immune to mosquitoes.

217
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,050
Let's go home.

218
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,040
Be careful.

219
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,230
Is Dad always like this?

220
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,060
Yes.

221
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:32,490
Why doesn't Mrs. Zhao
do anything about it?

222
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,660
When he craves alcohol,

223
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,620
he drinks himself unconscious.

224
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,220
He sleeps wherever he drops.

225
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,600
He's smart this time.

226
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,540
Dad.

227
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,630
How did he become like this?

228
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,780
When he wakes up, ask him yourself.

229
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,810
Why aren't the lights on?

230
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,020
The electrical circuit is burned out.

231
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,150
Dad said he can't be bothered to fix it.

232
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:03,590
Wait.

233
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,680
I just bought this flashlight.

234
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,560
Here you go.

235
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,380
Do you need my help?

236
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,840
Is it fixed?

237
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,290
Turn off the lights.

238
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,450
I need to get some sleep.
Turn off the lights.

239
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:34,900
You smell terrible.

240
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,470
Come. Go take a shower.

241
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,190
Get up.

242
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,960
Mu.

243
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Zhao.

244
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,440
My good children.

245
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,370
I

246
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,040
owe you an apology.

247
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,700
I'm not a good father.

248
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,710
You're drunk. Stop talking nonsense.

249
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,030
I'm happy that Mu is here.

250
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,900
Don't leave anymore.

251
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,130
I'll take care of you.

252
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,670
I'll buy you delicious food.

253
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,860
I'll cook for you.

254
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:26,940
After drinking coffee this late,

255
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,740
aren't you afraid
you won't be able to fall asleep?

256
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,500
I'm not going to sleep tonight anyway.

257
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,670
You're going to work again?

258
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,070
I'm going to Qingshi.

259
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,770
Are there still flights available now?

260
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,560
I'm driving there.

261
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,220
Driving at night is dangerous.

262
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,310
I'm used to it. You should get some rest.

263
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,990
For the next few days,

264
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,140
stay home with Jin Qiang.

265
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,190
A few days?

266
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,300
You'll be gone for several days?

267
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:03,950
Yes.

268
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,609
I'm going to find a part.

269
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,020
There's no one at the garage.

270
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,950
You don't need to look for me there.

271
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,010
I'm leaving now.

272
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:13,630
I actually had some good news to tell you.

273
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,859
I'm leaving at 10:30.

274
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,040
What's the good news? Tell me.

275
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,010
I plan to stay here

276
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,760
and apply to a school here.

277
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,590
Nana has already helped me sign up

278
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,520
for a language foundation course.

279
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,660
Have you thought it through?

280
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,080
Do you want me to stay?

281
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,280
Going to Canada with your mother

282
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,200
would definitely be better
than staying here.

283
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,410
You've seen what it's like here.

284
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,110
It's not as good as you imagined.

285
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,460
No.

286
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,330
I think it's pretty good here.

287
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,700
It's even

288
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,950
better than I imagined.

289
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,410
What do you mean?

290
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,720
I'm not telling you.

291
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,050
You have many secrets.

292
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,490
Not as many as yours.

293
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,470
You're the best at back talk.

294
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,740
My business is nothing but trouble.

295
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,490
It's better if you don't know.

296
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,220
How about

297
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,390
we exchange secrets?

298
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,630
Tell me a bad secret,

299
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:03,830
and I'll tell you a good...

300
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,160
Let's talk another day.

301
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,530
I really have to go.

302
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,330
Do you have enough money?

303
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,090
Yes.

304
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,240
Eat meals on time.

305
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,230
I'm a fussy eater.

306
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,060
I don't like the food outside.

307
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,630
Actually,

308
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,870
you can ask Jin Qiang to cook for you.

309
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,150
As you know,

310
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,530
he's good at cooking.

311
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,880
Come back soon.

312
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,520
I'll try.

313
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,730
Money isn't what I want.

314
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,690
Dad,

315
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,990
can you do me a favor?

316
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,630
The environment and atmosphere here
are great,

317
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,090
and the school is good too.

318
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,840
I've already found a language class.

319
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,600
It'll take about 3 or 4 months.

320
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,060
Dad knows about it, and he agrees.

321
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,580
Okay. I agree.

322
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,210
Did you hear that?

323
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,550
Dad said he agrees.

324
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,020
I don't want to talk about Jin Zhao
with you.

325
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,450
Alright, I'm tired.

326
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,380
I'm going to bed.

327
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,800
I'm going to sleep too.

328
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:15,910
Dad,

377
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,530
With your current skills,

378
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,730
you might be able to make it.

379
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,810
♪ Would you like that? ♪

380
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:15,830
Okay.

381
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,910
♪ Would you like that? ♪

382
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,590
Let's go.

383
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,280
There are many blind curves
on the back hill. Safety first.

384
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,280
Look at this black car.

385
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,560
This is the first time I've seen it.

386
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,330
It has great potential.

387
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:42,990
Now is the time.

388
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,050
There's water on the downhill road.

389
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,980
Where did the water come from?

390
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,500
Is this some kind of extra training mode?

391
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,500
I've got rain tires on. Don't worry.

392
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,150
Jin Zhao, your tires are the thinnest.

393
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:09,990
Be careful.

394
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:10,890
Thank you.

395
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,840
Oh no.

396
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,830
Jin Zhao's ranked in the top 10 in points.

397
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,730
I'm ranked in the top 10 in points.

398
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,510
Come here.

399
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,520
This is my cousin's garage.

400
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,940
It's so luxurious.

401
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,820
Feel free to look around.

402
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,110
Why does this place smell like a hospital?

403
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,500
It must be the disinfectant.

404
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,450
My cousin is a neat freak.

405
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,870
He made the whole garage

406
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,270
look like a sterile ward.

407
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,280
And over there.

408
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,670
This girl.

409
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,070
Why is she here?

410
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,630
This is a 1999 GTR34.

411
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,410
I only saw it in movies.

412
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,180
Mu, you know quite a lot.

413
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,310
It's nothing special.

414
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,870
My cousin treasures these cars so much.

415
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:23,520
Outsiders aren't even
allowed to touch them.

416
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,040
But you

417
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,790
can feel free to touch them.

418
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:27,980
Really?

419
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:28,700
Yes.

420
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,170
Then I won't hold back.

421
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,920
This car's pedal is so tiny

422
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,260
and delicate.

423
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,260
My cousin must have modified it.

424
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,420
My cousin is extremely meticulous.

425
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,670
He's a perfectionist
when it comes to modifying cars.

426
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,280
He's super demanding.

427
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,040
I'll take the call.

428
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,150
One really shouldn't talk
behind people's backs.

429
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,480
It's my cousin calling.

430
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,390
Sui.

431
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,460
Where are you?

432
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:10,260
I'm grocery shopping with my mom.

433
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,590
Um, uh...

434
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,750
How much is half a kilo of cilantro?

435
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,220
Do you still want

436
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,360
the guitar you liked last time?

437
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,020
You're giving it to me?

438
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,740
Meet me within 5 minutes,

439
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,390
and the guitar is yours.

440
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,570
5 minutes?

441
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,200
Okay, I'll be right there.

442
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:25,930
Wait for me.

443
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,980
Mu, I'm going to get a guitar.

444
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,670
I'll be right back.

445
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:29,220
Wait for me.

446
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,620
Feel free to look around.

447
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,560
Nana?

448
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,270
Nana?

449
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,630
Nana?

450
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,850
Nana?

451
00:31:59,190 --> 00:31:59,840
Na...

452
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:02,890
It's you again.

453
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,680
Which racing team sent you?

454
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,170
What racing team?

455
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,620
You used Nana to get close to me.

456
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,970
Don't be so full of yourself.

457
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,820
What's in it for me?

458
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,920
You should be answering my questions,

459
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,540
not asking me your own.

460
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,130
What if I don't answer?

461
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,190
Then you're

462
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,480
not leaving here today.

463
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,060
What's your reason for taking photos here?

464
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,670
Tell me. I want to know.

465
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,060
I was just curious,

466
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,320
so Nana brought me here to look around.

467
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,790
But after looking around,

468
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,500
I'm not that impressed.
There's nothing special.

469
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,880
Then tell me,

470
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,540
what is special?

471
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:54,980
My friend

472
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,020
has a Wankel engine.

473
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,490
It's really impressive.

474
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,590
A Wankel engine?

475
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,720
Your friend has one?

476
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:03,870
Yes.

477
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,640
Anyway, it's none of your business.

478
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,170
Let me out. I want to go home.

479
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,590
Get in.

480
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,700
Where are we going?

481
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,740
I'll take you out.

482
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,110
Where's Nana?

483
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,540
She's fine.

484
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,950
Don't you like this car?

485
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,620
I'll take you for a spin.

486
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,530
What did you take pictures of just now?

487
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,940
What pictures?

488
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,910
I have surveillance cameras.

489
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,660
The pedal.

490
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,830
It looks tiny,

491
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,770
light, and elegant.

492
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,350
A light clutch is easy to operate.

493
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,300
Faster coupling reduces time loss.

494
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,390
This, in turn,
leads to better performance.

495
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:09,230
It's a simple principle.

496
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,480
I also drove a car a few days ago.

497
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,810
Its clutch was huge and stiff.
It was really hard to control.

498
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,790
Was it a pickup truck?

499
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,320
How do you know?

500
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,350
The stiff clutch is caused by
its hard springs.

501
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,500
It enables a quick connection

502
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,909
between the engine and transmission
when shifting.

503
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,270
Locally, only pickup enthusiasts

504
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,020
use hard springs.

505
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,480
Stomping on it to shift is too rude.

506
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,760
You shift quickly too,

507
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,469
but your clutch isn't stiff.

508
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:47,139
Every car has its own performance balance.

509
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:48,250
How to modify it

510
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:50,449
depends on the owner's preference.

511
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,100
That's the meaning for us car enthusiasts.

512
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,230
The same car model

513
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,060
holds endless possibilities.

514
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,750
Besides,

515
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:57,370
elegance and performance

516
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,490
aren't mutually exclusive.

517
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:00,260
But

518
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,330
I hate rudeness.

519
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,630
I look better than the car?

520
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,180
No. Don't get the wrong idea.

521
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,580
It's just that the way you drive

522
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,860
reminds me of someone.

523
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:24,970
Your friend

524
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,440
with a Wankel engine?

525
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,870
Yes.

526
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,380
You both seem

527
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,870
very relaxed.

528
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,140
Where do you live?

529
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,430
I'll drive you home.

530
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,200
No need.

531
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,150
Just drop me off at the service area.

532
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,150
I'll take a taxi.

533
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,970
Until you tell me the address,

534
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,230
I'm not letting you out.

535
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,660
You're the first person
who dared to slam my car door.

536
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,230
If you dare to make me angry again,

537
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,250
I might become the first person

538
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,330
to smash your car.

539
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:40,520
Okay.

540
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,990
I'll give you that chance next time.

541
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:44,910
Is this

542
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,100
a Sichuan restaurant?

543
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,340
I really like Chinese food.

544
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:50,840
Sorry.

545
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,640
They only sell dumplings here,

546
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,660
and it's just that one type

547
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,460
with extremely salty
pickled vegetable filling.

548
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,830
Zhao.

549
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,130
I have something to tell you.

550
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,130
Jin Qiang's

551
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,100
eldest daughter seems to be
in a relationship.

552
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,020
Jiang Mu?

553
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,890
Yes, I saw it with my own eyes.

554
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,060
I hope

555
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,720
nothing goes wrong. Otherwise,

556
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,570
how would I explain it to her mother?

557
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,700
You're close to her.

558
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:29,660
How about

559
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,000
you talk to her

560
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,870
and find out what happened?

561
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,390
What did you see?

562
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,630
A man

563
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,470
just drove her back in a sports car.

564
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,870
And he's still there,

565
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,970
talking nonstop.

566
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,240
Are you sure?

567
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,200
Of course.

568
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,750
I have sharp eyes.

569
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:47,910
I knew.

570
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,850
Zhao, listen to me.

571
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,310
Have a good talk with her.

572
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:56,060
This girl seems quite stubborn.

573
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,320
Otherwise, she wouldn't have come here

574
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,950
instead of going abroad
like her mother wanted.

575
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:01,700
When you talk to her,

576
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,800
be careful about your approach.

577
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:06,870
Okay.

578
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,190
I'll talk to her.

579
00:38:58,730 --> 00:38:59,880
You seem

580
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,190
very familiar with this place.

581
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,420
What do you usually do here?

582
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,130
What nonsense are you thinking about?

583
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,670
No. I was just asking.

584
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,370
Have you ever thought about

585
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:47,590
what kind of person you'd like to marry
in the future?

586
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,430
No, I haven't.

587
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,360
Why did you ask this?

588
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,630
I was just asking.

589
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,270
When I was in school,

590
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,980
a guy in my class

591
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,050
chased a girl from another class

592
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,050
pretty actively.

593
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:16,720
He brought her food in the morning
and drinks in the afternoon.

594
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,120
He also gave her gifts constantly.

595
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,650
He was such a smooth talker.

596
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,780
He had her wrapped around his finger.

597
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,850
But behind her back,

598
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,020
he talked to us about

599
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,640
things too vulgar to repeat.

600
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:30,670
He even shared intimate details about them

601
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,730
as something to brag about.

602
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,760
Guess what happened next.

603
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,620
What happened?

604
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,940
The girl's grades dropped off.

605
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,900
Her family came to school
and made a scene.

606
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,980
The boy broke up with her.

607
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,640
The girl couldn't accept it.

608
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,510
She took pills

609
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,480
and attempted suicide.

610
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,140
What do you think?

611
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,270
Well, but...

612
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:56,060
There was no need to attempt suicide.

613
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,350
At your age,

614
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,100
a boy's attraction to a girl

615
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,080
is mostly just a passing fancy.

616
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,020
To them,

617
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,100
getting a pretty girl

618
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:15,530
is just about having a trophy

619
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:16,340

Not necessarily.

622
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:22,050
There was a couple in my class before.

623
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,260
Later, they were both admitted to NUAA.
