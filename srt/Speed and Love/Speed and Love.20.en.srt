[Episode 20]

3
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,720
Pass me a glass.

4
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,039
Help yourself.

5
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,500
Uncle, everything will be
smooth sailing from now on.

6
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,110
Where we go and how far we go

7
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,170
is all dependent on you

8
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,530
and on Wan's now.

9
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:05,800
Here, let me toast to you.

10
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Thank you, Uncle.

11
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,840
This is good liquor.

12
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,520
Our champion is back.

13
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,210
Come, have a drink with us.

14
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,120
Come on, pour a drink for our champion!

15
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,320
Our champion is here.

16
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,890
Mr. Wan,

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,310
can we chat privately?

18
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,360
Go ahead.

19
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,610
Come, let's keep drinking.

20
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,790
It's about Jin Zhao.

21
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,360
How did he fall?

22
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,570
His skills were lacking.

23
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,340
I could've beaten him.

24
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,050
You've already won.

25
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,829
I could've won on my own merit.

26
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:48,930
The process doesn't matter.

27
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,640
You are now Wan's Garage's

28
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,660
top driver.

29
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,840
Congratulations.

30
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,420
I don't deserve it.

31
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,450
Now you do.

32
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,890
How ungrateful.

33
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,500
Come on, pour me a drink!

34
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,650
Pour Mr. Wan a drink!

35
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,260
Here we go! Bottom's up!

36
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,790
Fill up all your glasses!

37
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,120
Fill them up!

38
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:49,590
The call's connected!

39
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,010
If Brandy had his phone on him

40
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:09,570
and the car exploded,
but the phone still works...

41
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,670
Is it possible that

42
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,000
Brandy wasn't in the car when it exploded?

43
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,870
He wasn't in the car?

44
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,470
Then where could he be?

45
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,010
No news from hospitals or police stations.

46
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
Where could he be?

47
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,440
Jiang Mu.

48
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,000
Boss, do you remember

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,120
that guy who always wore a baseball cap?

50
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,330
I can't recall.

51
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,880
He often chatted with you,

52
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,320
and he is around my height.

53
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,610
You mean Lu,

54
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,650
who often buys from me?

55
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,240
Yes, do you have his contact info?

56
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,020
Could I get his phone number?

57
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,900
Just a moment.

58
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:05,090
0264530204.

59
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,780
That's correct.

60
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,450
Thank you, Boss.

61
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,250
No problem.

62
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,050
I got it!

63
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,120
Here.

64
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,940
Hello, Officer Lu.

65
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,680
This is Jiang Mu.

66
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,550
Jin Zhao, is he...

67
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,350
Is he still alive?

68
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,970
Give me a moment.

69
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:51,810
Fu.

70
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,420
Keep an eye on things.

71
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,110
Jiang Mu, right?

72
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,630
Jin Zhao is still in critical condition.

73
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,760
I'll let you know when I have good news.

74
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,690
Okay.

75
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,820
Can I at least visit him?

76
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,920

Why are you here?

110
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,250
Where's my mom?

111
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,350
Yinghan didn't come.

112
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,590
Mu.

113
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,460
I have something to tell you.

114
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,230
You may not be able to accept it just yet,

115
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,320
but I think I must tell you.

116
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,720
Around...

117
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,410
last October,

118
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,350
five and a half months after
I met your mother,

119
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,560
your mother was diagnosed with

120
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,890
aortic stenosis,

121
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,010
with a severity of 78 percent.

122
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,840
The diagnosis is aortic stenosis,

123
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,770
with a severity of 78 percent.

124
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,700
You need surgery urgently.

125
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:34,840
This...

126
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,940
Doctor, what exactly do you mean?

127
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,840
Aortic stenosis

128
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,560
becomes very serious when it
exceeds 75 percent.

129
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,010
If it progresses further,

130
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,340
the blood vessels could become
completely blocked.

131
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,010
We need to perform
the coronary bypass surgery

132
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,220
to establish a new pathway.

133
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,700
You can think it over,

134
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,940
but please decide quickly.

135
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,780
Thank you, Doctor.

136
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,770
Chris.

137
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,420
Let's break up.

138
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,620
What?

139
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,920
You know about my condition now.

140
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,120
I don't want to become your burden.

141
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,130
This is just an illness.

142
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,530
Why should we break up?

143
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,270
The doctor said I need surgery,

144
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,720
and this surgery

145
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,500
isn't 100 percent guaranteed to succeed.

146
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,900
Even if it's successful,

147
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,930
full recovery isn't guaranteed either.

148
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,210
I don't want to be a burden to you.

149
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,330
So what?

150
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,010
We are 100 percent in love.

151
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,490
That's all that matters.

152
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,980
Why do you have to be
so brutal to yourself?

153
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,170
We're lovers?

154
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,180
Yes.

155
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,680
Darling,

156
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,120
let's get married.

157
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,790
Marry me.

158
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,300
Are you proposing to me now?

159
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,790
I have a good friend

160
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,200
in Canada

161
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,960
who's a cardiovascular specialist.

162
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,890
When we get back,

163
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,780
I'll email him right away.

164
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,900
If possible,

165
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,240
we'll go to Canada for the surgery.

166
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
I'll do as you say.

167
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,290
Also, we should tell Mumu.

168
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,330
No.

169
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,800
We can't tell Mumu.

170
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,160
But I think having Mumu by your side

171
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,090
would help you recover faster.

172
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,050
No.

173
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,570
We absolutely cannot tell Mumu.

174
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,130
She's still a child.

175
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,360
I don't want to burden her

176
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,960
or make her worry.

177
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,570
So you must promise me

178
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,430
to keep this from Mumu.

179
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:15,960
Otherwise,

180
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,410
I won't get treatment.

181
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,060
You...

182
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,120
Alright.

183
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,720
I'll do as you wish.

184
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,090
Just recently,

185
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,650
your mom's surgery went smoothly.

186
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,210
I just hope you can accompany her to her

187
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,390
follow-up appointments.

188
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,750
Since your mom got sick,

189
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,150

190
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,810
I know she really misses you.

00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,680
Mu.

192
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,800
Your mom really needs you now.

193
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:24,890
I'm sorry,

194
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,410
Chris,

195
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,100
for my attitude towards you previously.

196
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,280

my mom all this time.

00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,200

You're finally awake.

You've been seriously injured.

259
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,110
You've been unconscious for a long time.

260
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,160
Jiang Mu has been trying to contact you,

261
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,900
but I didn't know how to respond to her.

00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,620
Don't move.

263
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:47,950

264
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,570

265
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,850
Help me contact Sanlai.

266
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,460
Okay, I'll contact him.

267
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,590
Stay still. I'll call the doctor.

268
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,460
I'll have Sanlai pick you up

269
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:46,960
tomorrow morning.

270
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:48,570
Let's meet.

271
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,240
Brandy is inside.

272
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,510
You've been in touch with him
for a while now, right?

273
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,360
Why didn't you tell me?

274
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,430
Brandy is upstairs.

275
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,240
Go ask him yourself.

276
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:45,540
[Vancouver]

277
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:54,960
Mom.

278
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,930
My Mu has finally returned.

279
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,260
You've finally returned.

280
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,530
It's great to have you back.

281
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,180
It's great to have you back.

282
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:11,820
Mom.

283
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,270
I'm sorry.

284
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,140
I didn't know you were so sick.

285
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,330
If I had known,

286
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,850
I wouldn't have been so wilful.

287
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:19,930
Silly child.

288
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,990
Aren't I standing right here
in front of you?

289
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,410
The doctor said

290
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:26,850
as long as I keep up with

291
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,510
regular follow-up appointments,
I'll be fine.

292
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:31,600
From now on,

293
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,730
I'll accompany you to your appointments.

294
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,920
I'll listen to my precious daughter
from now on.

295
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,920
Whatever you say.

296
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,740
Don't cry, my silly child.

297
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:45,680
It's time to eat!

298
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,240
Come inside.

299
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,620
Let's eat.

300
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,000
Are you tired?

301
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,240
Please pay attention to the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram on the screen.

302
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,930
These in the upper left corner,

303
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:04,670
the O-type main sequence stars
have surface temperatures

304
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,850
that can reach 30,000 Kelvin.

305
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:06,720
Just imagine.

306
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,330
This is three orders of magnitude hotter

307
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,960
than the plasma we can generate
in our laboratory.

308
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,610
The Crab Nebula you see now

309
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:15,300
is actually the remnant of a supernova

310
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,120
that exploded in 1054 AD.

311
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,580
Its central pulsar has

312
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,850
a rotation period of 33 milliseconds,

313
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,960
like the most precise atomic clock
in the universe.

314
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,640
I'm studying natural science,

315
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,640
focusing on physics and astronomy.

316
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,650
Currently, my studies are
really challenging to me.

317
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:37,240
I barely understand
any of the technical terms

318
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,840
our professors use in class.

319
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,520
Sometimes after a lecture,

320
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,110
it feels like
I've been listening to gibberish.

321
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,840
The pressure is overwhelming.

322
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,760
I wish you were here with me.

323
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,200
The coffee here is so bitter,

324
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,960
it's awful.

325
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:56,760
You know,

326
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,280
I go home every month on weekends

327
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,650
to stay with Mom at Chris' house.

328
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:04,200
Her condition is gradually improving.

329
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,860
I often tell her

330
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,930
about our time together in Manshi.

331
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,300
Sometimes,

332
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:12,280
she even takes the initiative
to ask me about you.

333
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,100
But I don't know the exact situation
on your end either,

334
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,340
so I can only tell Mom

335
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,790
that you're doing fine.

336
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,890
But...

337
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,930
are you really okay?

338
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:25,110
Once things are settled on your end,

339
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,930
you'll come see me, won't you?

340
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,200
From your voice, you seem like...

341
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,800
you're still not doing well.

342
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,730
I'm still alive for now.

343
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,410
I'd like to recommend someone to you.

344
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,330
Dr. Julia.

345
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,040
She's a good friend of mine

346
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,370
and an excellent rehabilitation doctor.

347
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,430
She'll definitely be of help to you.

348
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,560
She'll be here soon.

349
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,190
Hello,

350
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,650
I'm Julia.

351
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,090
Lin Sui should have told you about me.

352
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,310
He specifically invited me back
from Canada.

353
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,710
The upcoming rehabilitation
will be very tough,

354
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,630
but believe me,

355
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,630
it will definitely help you.

356
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:25,880
Hold it there.

357
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,100
Try to control it yourself.

358
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,240
Relax.

359
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,170
Don't fight me.

360
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,600
Yes.

361
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,260
Push harder. Control it.

362
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,480
Great!

363
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,170
In the early stages, we'll work through

364
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,900
hip and knee flexion exercises

365
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,610
to train your joint mobility and strength.

366
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,350
Now, try it yourself.

367
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,410
Bend.

368
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,250
Zhao,

369
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,650
I've gradually adapted to life here

370
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,090
and made new friends.

371
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,220
Also,

372
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,730
all those difficult technical terms

373
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,580
our professors use in class,

374
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,400
I can understand them all now.

375
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:30,650
Zhao,

376
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,520
how are things over there?

377
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,440
In terms of surgery,

378
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,240
we've done all we can.

379
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:39,090
The rest depends mainly on rehabilitation.

380
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,090
I understand.

381
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,280
Doctor,

382
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,410
will he be able to race again?

383
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:47,520
Racing?

384
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,190
Being able to stand

385
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,440
and live without a wheelchair
would be fortunate enough.

386
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,640
Forget about racing.

387
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:53,890
Sir,

388
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,120
your spinal nerves have been injured

389
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,340
and you have multiple tendon tears.

390
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,440
The rehabilitation process

391
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,700
will be extremely long and painful.

392
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,430
You must be mentally prepared.

393
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,040
Thank you.

394
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,240
Let me see you out.

395
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,510
Contact me if you need anything.

396
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,810
Jiang Mu sent you a message?

397
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:38,760
She's been messaging you a lot
these past three months, hasn't she?

398
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,390
You didn't leave all of them unanswered,
did you?

399
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,840
In my current condition,

400
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,530
how am I supposed to respond to her?

401
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,890
Should I tell her,

402
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,130
"Mu,

403
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,470
I'll most likely be disabled
in the future,

404
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,510
either using crutches

405
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,340
or in a wheelchair.

406
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,140
Would you still want to be with me?"

407
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:15,480
Jiang Mu would be willing.

408
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,480
But I'm not.

409
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,200
She deserves a better life.

410
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,330
Besides, the case isn't closed yet.

411
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,740
Sanlai,

412
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,400
don't contact her either.

413
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,910
We...

414
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,460
We should all try

415
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,610
to give her a peaceful life.

416
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,440
I'm right here.

417
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,080
You don't need
to be yearning day and night.

418
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,630
I want to clear my name.

419
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,210
Especially after you came.

420
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,080
I want this proof of innocence even more.

421
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:29,410
♪ Perhaps the weather's damp and mild ♪

422
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,890
I want to prove myself.

423
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:29,590
At the very least,

424
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:33,260
♪ Perhaps it's about the habit
of bearing ♪

425
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,670
I deserve you.

426
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:37,260
♪ A certain bitter emotion ♪

427
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:43,350

All my life,

429
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,480
people have come and gone.

430
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:50,010
♪ To be happy or heartbroken,
as transparent as I can be ♪

431
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,850
I've never been serious about anyone.

432
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,340
So once I get serious,

433
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,910
♪ Crossing the line for love,
I've walked 10,000 kilometers ♪

434
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,200
I probably won't give you
a chance to change your mind.

435
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:04,410
♪ Brave enough to be sure is my instinct ♪

436
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,600

Zhao.

442
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,490
Why won't you reply to my messages?

443
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,230
Even if you simply reply,

444
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:25,760
♪ Crossing the line for love,
I've walked 10,000 kilometers ♪

445
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:21,760
"I got it."

446
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,710
Even just an emoji would be fine.

447
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:28,570
Why won't you respond to me?

448
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:33,250
♪ Brave enough to be sure is my instinct ♪

449
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:38,390

453
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,670
Are you feeling better?

454
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,230
This sort of pain will come again.

455
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,150
Some of it is physical.

456
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,680
Some of it are triggered by
traumatic memories.

457
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,040
But mostly,

458
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,440
it's psychological and
physical pain intertwined.

459
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,170
So,

460
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,850
don't worry.

461
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,000
I'll help you.

462
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:30,960
Just relax.

463
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,240
I'll go get busy now.

464
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,840
Call me if you need anything.

465
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,720
Lift your feet up. Don't drag them.

466
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,580
Each step can be smaller,

467
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,220
but keep them steady.

468
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:51,730
Relax your upper body.

469
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,260
Try to use the strength
from your lower limbs.

470
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,310
Good. Go slower.

471
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,150
Yes.

472
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,280
Lift your foot.

473
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,340
Very good.

474
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:20,820
Good.

475
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,810
Talented people

476
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,860
tend to bounce back pretty quickly.

477
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,190
Let's stop here for today.

478
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,120
Thank you.

479
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,370
Have some water.

480
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,409
I have good news for you.

481
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,480
The case has been solved.

482
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,250
Really?

483
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,940
The amount involved is enormous.

484
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,770
Approaching 800 million yuan.

485
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:06,410
It was largely thanks to He Zhang
turning himself in

486
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,770
and becoming a prosecution witness

487
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,970
that the case had a major breakthrough.

488
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:19,970
What brings you here?

489
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,410
I'm sorry.

490
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,300
Why are you apologizing to me?

491
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,960
Because...

492
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,980
I don't want to lose to you.

493
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,800
When I was at Wan's,

494
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,070
I did many things that wronged you.

495
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,800
But about Wan Shengbang
tampering with your car,

496
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,890
I truly didn't know.

497
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:04,660
Jin Zhao,

498
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,310
if there's still a chance,

499
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,010
I wish to challenge you fairly once more.

500
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,510
I'm going to turn myself in.

501
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:37,430
He Zhang provided information

502
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:40,490
on the trading methods between
Wan's and the Alliance.

503
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,370
The Navy Headquarters and
the Anti-Smuggling Bureau joined forces,

504
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,810
and with police departments
cooperating nationwide,

505
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,810
we've arrested everyone involved.

506
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,730
Wan Dayong was caught immediately.

507
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:56,570
As for Wan Shengbang,

508
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,890
he was caught while fleeing to Vietnam.

509
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,770
As for your accident,

510
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:03,330
Wan Shengbang coerced your mechanic

511
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,000
by threatening his family's safety,

512
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,880
forcing him to tamper with your car's

513
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,810
braking system,

514
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:09,740
which caused the accident.

515
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,660
The mechanic has been arrested

516
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,800
and awaits further processing.

517
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:16,480
In short,

518
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,000
no one got away.

519
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,650
That puts my mind at ease.

520
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,160
During the first interrogation,

521
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,090
Wan Dayong confessed everything,

522
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,600
including your case from years ago.

523
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,540
The guy honestly admitted

524
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,640
that he swapped out parts

525
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,370
using inferior replacements.

526
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,160
You had nothing to do with it.

527
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,730
Thank you.

528
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,420
My wish has been fulfilled.

529
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,410
Jin Zhao,

530
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,780
we should be thanking you.

531
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,610
You've been through a lot these years.

532
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,120
Alright, I have work to do.

533
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,650
Take good care of yourself.

534
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,370
I saw the news.

535
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,610
Is it all over now?

536
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:58,600
During this time...

537
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,230
you must have been so worried.

538
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,500
Is the mission over?

539
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,260
Almost.

540
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,830
Did you see the Luminous Pearl

541
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:13,950
from that night?

542
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,750
Yes, I did.

543
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:23,100
So...

544
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,710
when the explosion happened,

545
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:25,590
you weren't there.
