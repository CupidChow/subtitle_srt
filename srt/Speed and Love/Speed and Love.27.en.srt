[Speed and Love]

00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:48,830
[Episode 27]

3
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,700
How old is your child?

4
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,960
Is he in kindergarten?

5
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,090
Your child.

6
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,860
When you came back to China,

7
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,720
did your child come back with you?

8
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,930
Did Jin Zhao tell you about this?

9
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,729
He mentioned it at a dinner once.

10
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:13,970
Does he

11
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,530
talk about me often?

12
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,570
He doesn't talk much
about his personal life,

13
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,630
but everyone knows

14
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,180
Mr. Jin's wife lives abroad
with their child.

15
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,500
He said his child is quite lazy,

16
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,700
and likes to sleep in.

17
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,810
That's such an easy child to take care of!

18
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,780
My sister's kid

19
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,620
wakes up at five every morning.

20
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,980
That's a real headache.

21
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,180
The adults can't get any sleep, either.

22
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,250
But my sister's daughter
has the same issue as yours—

23
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,380
she's a picky eater.

24
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,780
Won't eat this, won't eat that.

25
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,980
It's so frustrating.

26
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,090
My aunt said it's because
of poor spleen function.

27
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,220
She took her for therapeutic massage.

28
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,900
You could try that, too.

29
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,829
You're the one with poor spleen function.

30
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,850
Wife? Child?

31
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,050
You've made up quite a story.

32
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,690
According to you,
I'm both a mother and a daughter—

33
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,150
playing two roles at once.

34
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,970
What exactly have you been telling people?

35
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,570
Now your lazy, picky little baby

36
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,340
is angry.

37
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Don't you need to explain yourself?

38
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,650
I'm busy.

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,690
Later.

40
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,420
Why did you come back?

41
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,940
I heard there was a child who was upset.

42
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,810
I'm here to comfort her.

43
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,420
Is this how you comfort someone?

44
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,090
How would you like me to comfort you, then?

45
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,690
You've really changed now.

46
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,860
You weren't like this before.

47
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,120
You used to pull me into alleys
and tell me

48
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,370
that girls shouldn't behave this way.

49
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,540
Back then,
you were still immature.

50
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,270
Don't give me that parent talk.

51
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,860
Look at the axis.

52
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,420
From here to here, it's 30.

53
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,180
Does it matter if it exceeds 30?

54
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,780
Thank you, Senior.

55
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,740
Here, try it.

56
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,020
I waited in line to buy you this coffee.

57
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,210
Their coffee is award-winning.

58
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,659
I queued up at 4 or 5 a.m.

59
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,020
I queued for a long time.

60
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,010
Why did you only buy one for him?

61
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:38,740
I don't get one?

62
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,860
So what?

63
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:40,980
-You are so biased—
-Here.

64
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,840
You can have it.

65
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,180
Senior, you're too nice.

66
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,330
He likes me.

67
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,370
We are close, right?

68
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,210
Senior.

69
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
Is there something wrong

70
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,300
with this diagram's wheelbase?

71
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,130
Don't you know this?
It was taught in class.

72
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:53,790
Let me do it.

73
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,690
It's so easy.

74
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,770
Don't you know?

75
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,180
Tell him. Yes, tell him.

76
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,860
Look at this point and this point.

77
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,250
Yes.

78
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,010
That one.

79
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,030
-Let me tell you.
-The blackboard.

80
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:04,780
Mu!

81
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,250
Why are you here?

82
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,170
Without telling me, either.

83
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,210
I'm here to tell you that

84
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,740
I've received the notice of employment.

85
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,620
From today onwards,

86
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,130
I'm a full-time employee
of the research institute.

87
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,390
Notice of employment?

88
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,740
Show me.

89
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,830
No.

90
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,100
Not unless you hug me.

91
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,280
Don't you see where we are?

92
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,190
What? Does your school

93
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,100
have rules against dating?

94
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,700
You're acting strange.

95
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,100
What's strange about me?

96
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,210
I'm wondering when

97
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,370
you'll buy me a coffee, too.

98
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,010
Zhao, is this your girlfriend?

99
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,270
Never seen her before.

100
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,450
Yes.

101
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,180
She's usually quite busy.

102
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,010
She finally found some time

103
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,670
to grace me with her presence.

104
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,960
Alright, we're heading out first, then.

105
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,160
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

106
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,340
Does that short-haired girl like you?

107
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,920
Why did she only buy coffee for you

108
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,250
and not for anyone else?

109
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,690
They came to discuss

110
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,250
fluid mechanics with me

111
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,570
and to ask about admissions.

112
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,330
I run a coffee shop myself.

113
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:40,090
Isn't the coffee at home good enough?

114
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,150
Why bother drinking someone else's?

115
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,520
Behave yourself.

116
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,010
Don't you see where we are?

117
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,380
Our school doesn't have rules
against dating.

118
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,630
Am I coming to dinner tonight, too?

119
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,300
With whom?

120
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,120
You'll find out when you get there.

121
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,260
Who is it?

122
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,550
What's the rush?

123
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,430
Come here!

124
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,570
Is there something wrong with your eyes?

125
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,300
Look.

126
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,540
My angle is so tight here.

127
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,960
And then you parked your car sideways.

128
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,490
How am I supposed to back up?

129
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,520
I'll go handle this.
You go up and wait for me.

130
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,170
Hey, Ma'am, I...

131
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,430
What do you mean "hey"?

132
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,060
I know that look on your face.

133
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,600
Are you discriminating against
female drivers?

134
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,660
Let me tell you, I can sue you for this.

135
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,380
It's him who blocked this spot,

136
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,510
making it impossible for me to back up.

137
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,080
Why are you honking?

138
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,140
It's because he parked sideways here—

139
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,720
let me tell you.

140
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,790
Come and judge for yourself.

141
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,190
Wen, move your car first.

142
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,870
I'll help you back up.

143
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,380
Alright.

144
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,180
Sanlai!

145
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,970
Jiang Mu?

146
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,350
What are you doing here?

147
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,190
Oh my God!

148
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,810
Long time no see.

149
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,260
Long time no see.

150
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,660
Our Jiang Mu

151
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,660
is getting more and more beautiful.

152
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,850
Just good makeup.

153
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,950
Where's Brandy?

154
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,710
He went to park the car.

155
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:13,540
Park?

156
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,040
He can handle the steering wheel now?

157
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,710
That's good.

158
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,160
Anyway, now that you're here with him,

159
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,090
encourage him to drive more often.

160
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,600
Who are you chatting with?

161
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,720
Oh my God! Isn't this my lil' sis?

162
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,020
Crazy?

163
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,850
You've really grown up!

164
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,050
You've become so pretty!

165
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,370
-I almost didn't recognize you.
-Take it easy.

166
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,730
You've changed a lot, too.

167
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:36,610
More mature, right?

168
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,010
More weathered, I'd say.

169
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,710
What are you talking about?

170
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,530
When did you two get in touch?

171
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,790
Why didn't you tell us?

172
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,170
It's been a while.

173
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,000
Don't just stand there.
Let's sit down and talk.

174
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,600
Okay.

175
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,570
How long has it been since we last met?

176
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,260
Today, I've got to drink with Mu.

177
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:56,970
Yes.

178
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,310
She won't be drinking.

179
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,970
It made sense
when you protected her at 18.

180
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:01,900
But you're still doing it now.

181
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,900
Won't you let us get a little closer?

182
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,250
I'm in a good mood today.

183
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,510
If Mu doesn't drink, the three of us will.

184
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,440
I'm not drinking, either.

185
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,540
Just the two of us, then.

186
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,470
Waiter!

187
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,850
Bring the food!

188
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,790
After what happened to Brandy,

189
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,710
I completely cut ties with Wan's.

190
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:22,860
But anyway,

191
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,970
Crazy handled this matter properly.

192
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,570
This shows that in his heart,

193
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,300
he still cares about us.

194
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,450
Can you stop being so sappy?

195
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,060
I just felt guilty.

196
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,240
I was careless with what happened

197
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,120
with Iron Cock,

198
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,010
hurting Brandy.

199
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,140
It's okay.

200
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,380
Being alive is what matters.

201
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,900
He suffered for a few years.

202
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,160
But thankfully
Crazy was there at the time.

203
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,130
He's big enough

204
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,710
and helped me take care of Brandy,

205
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,970
making things easier.

206
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,550
I barely took care of him for a few days.

207
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,920
As soon as he felt a little better,
he wanted to take the self-study exam,

208
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,250
dragging me along, too.

209
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,210
Come on, you have the nerve to complain?

210
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,960
Do you know why he took you with him?

211
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,800
He was sick

212
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,330
and you were making all that noise
playing video games.

213
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,410
It was bothering him.

214
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,670
I've never liked studying
since I was a kid.

215
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,970
After middle school,
I just became a slacker.

216
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,420
Absolutely ungrateful.

217
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,490
If it weren't for Brandy,

218
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,490
would you be a college graduate now?

219
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,520
Brandy originally wanted to drag him along
to take the graduate exam.

220
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,790
This guy threatened to kill himself,

221
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,300
so Brandy finally let him off the hook.

222
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,060
Look, at my age,

223
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,570
I'm satisfied

224
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,570
just getting a college degree.

225
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,230
You really should be content.

226
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,810
Crazy is doing well now.

227
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,520
He's working as a technician under Brandy.

228
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,320
His life has some stability now.

229
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,040
However, he still hasn't found

230
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,420
a partner...

231
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,050
Jiang Mu,

232
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,500
help Crazy find someone good.

233
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,690
Mu, I'm counting on you for this.

234
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,420
These two aren't reliable.

235
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,680
No problem. Leave it to me.

236
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,240
Sanlai, don't just talk about Crazy Jin.

237
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,170
Tell us about yourself.

238
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,370
How have you been doing all these years?

239
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,380
Just by looking at me

240
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,180
you can tell I'm doing very well.

241
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:05,570
However,

242
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,660
when Brandy left back then,

243
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,760
Xishi died, too.

244
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,140
I was quite heartbroken.

245
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:10,970
So I thought

246
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,610
I'd close down the pet shop.

247
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,500
Later I opened a fast food restaurant.

248
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,530
Business is still pretty good, though.

249
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,660
So that fast food restaurant is yours?

250
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,200
You've been there?

251
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,180
I didn't go in.

252
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,610
I saw it when I returned
during my first vacation

253
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,010
when I studied in Canada.

254
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:37,930
You know what?

255
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,060
I'm truly a business genius.

256
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,450
When I opened that fast food restaurant,

257
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,060
I made quite a bit of money
after a few years.

258
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,260
But later I realized
without my bros around me,

259
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,520
life was really tough.

260
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,210
So I leased out the restaurant

261
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,570
and came back to join Brandy.

262
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:50,490
This guy

263
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,530
rushed back here in such a hurry.

264
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,060
He opened a fast food restaurant
right at the factory entrance.

265
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,890
When he first opened,
there was no business at all.

266
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,560
If it weren't for all of us

267
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,610
supporting him,

268
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,010
I tell you,
he would've gone under long ago.

269
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,610
Plus, Brandy

270
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,099
had some influence.

271
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,380
More and more people

272
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,730
started eating at his place

273
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,970
instead of the cafeteria.

274
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,819
He even borrowed my savings.

275
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,010
Saying he wanted to expand the business.

276
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,720
Made it so our cafeteria
couldn't even stay in business.

277
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,859
Our boss had a real problem with him.

278
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:17,099
That's enough.

279
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,800
Are you getting old?

280
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,710
Why are you so talkative?

281
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,099
Who borrowed money from you?

282
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:23,300
Don't talk nonsense.

283
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,490
Let me summarize.

284
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,099
So this factory

285
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:28,010
wanted to change their cafeteria operator.

286
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:28,920
So I submitted a bid.

287
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,010
Surprisingly, many of the managers

288
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,490
had eaten at my restaurant before

289
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,290
and gave me the opportunity,

290
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,290
and they chose me.

291
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,420
Give me a break.

292
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,890
It's thanks to that glib tongue of yours

293
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,450
that you secured the contract.

294
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,340
That's enough.

295
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,150
Speaking of which, I just remembered.

296
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,770
Are you tired? Would you like some water?

297
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,420
Well.

298
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,710
Let me formally introduce myself again.

299
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,770
I'm now

300
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,970
a man with a business card.

301
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,370
I'm a Cafeteria Manager.

302
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:55,550
All right.

303
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,580
So you're

304
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,780
planning to stay in Nanjing from now on?

305
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,120
Yeah, just like you.

306
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,010
Clinging onto Brandy.

307
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,250
I can see that.

308
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,990
You do that yourself.

309
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,820
-Why is it your name on this?
-I won't cling onto him.

310
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,820
You only have Brandy.

311
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,610
-You don't even have a partner.
-I didn't write it.

312
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,400
You really know how to hit a sore spot,
don't you?

313
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,810
What about it?

314
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,820
-You, too.
-Stop talking.

315
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,420
Come on, have a drink.

316
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,210
Come on.

317
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,140
I'll just drink water for now
and make it up next time.

318
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,690
Fine, you owe us one.

319
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,690
-When will you make it up?
-I owe you.

320
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,520
We've been apart for so long.

321
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,800
Yet in this reunion,

322
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,050
we're still as close as before.

323
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,370
It's like time hasn't passed at all.

324
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,380
Sanlai is still as eloquent as before,

325
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,290
talking non-stop.

326
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,970
And there's still the jumpy Crazy,

327
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,900
who loves to bicker with Sanlai.

328
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,560
It's just that

329
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,580
Sanlai has become more composed
than before.

330
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,960
And Crazy's hair has gone from red

331
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,270
to black.

332
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,300
When Zhao is with them,

333
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,170
though he doesn't say much,

334
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,410
you can tell

335
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,320
he's at peace and is content.

336
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,180
Perhaps now,

337
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:08,370
few people know about his tumultuous past.

338
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,920
Only in front of these old friends,

339
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,330
he's still the same Brandy.

340
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:18,960
I quit.

341
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,440
You quit?

342
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,920
You're not trying to have a baby, are you?

343
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,180
Are you really planning to wait

344
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,480
until your kid is grown up
and running around

345
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,540
before telling us?

346
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,410
It hasn't been that long,

347
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,190
just

348
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,920
a little over two months.

349
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,090
Brandy! Look at you.

350
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,660
It's not like we never met

351
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,140
or had meals together during these two months.

352
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,770
Your mouth seems

353
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,500
like it's been padlocked shut.

354
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,630
Don't act like an old nanny.

355
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,010
I can't be giving you

356
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,670
every single life update by calling you,
right?

357
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,650
That day I called you
during Mid-Autumn Festival,

358
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,680
that girl on the phone was Jiang Mu,
right?

359
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,590
You two were already together then?

360
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:06,980
Not yet at that time.

361
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,490
Fine!

362
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:12,770
No wonder lately

363
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,570
I could never get you to hang out.

364
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,450
Every time we met,

365
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,530
you acted like you had firecrackers
under your butt—

366
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,730
barely sitting down before leaving.

367
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,130
So you were rushing back
to be with Jiang Mu.

368
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,990
It's the honeymoon phase.

369
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,900
Yeah, right!

370
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:30,010
What kind of honeymoon phase
lasts for so many years?

371
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,410
Isn't that nice, though?

372
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,850
Zhao and Mu.

373
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:35,770
Tell me,

374
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,170
how far have you two gone?

375
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,030
I want to marry her.

376
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:44,250
Jin and I were

377
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:45,620
discussing this the other day—

378
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,380
saying if either of us got married,

379
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,280
you'd be left alone.

380
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,680
We were just thinking
how pitiful you'd be.

381
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,340
And now you're telling me

382
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,820
you want to get married?

383
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,600
Put your hand down.

384
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,850
Back then,
when you changed your number,

385
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,050
why did you persuade me
to change mine too,

386
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,980
not letting me contact Jiang Mu?

387
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,050
That was because at that time...

388
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,660
You haven't been

389
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,770
guarding against me all these years,
have you?

390
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,070
You knew how handsome and charming I am,

391
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,210
and you were afraid Jiang Mu

392
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,600
might fall for me
if she contacted me too much.

393
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,250
Right?

394
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,150
Yes.

395
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,010
I was just jealous of you.

396
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,440
I get jealous of any man

397
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,670
who appears around Mu.

398
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,530
You're just love-obsessed.

399
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,490
I am love-obsessed.

400
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,290
You're no fun.

401
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:43,950
Wait a second.

402
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,630
If you get married, do I have to

403
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,180
give two wedding gifts?

404
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,860
Two, three, four, five gifts are all fine.

405
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,590
Be generous.

406
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,500
Something up at the company?

407
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,520
Okay, I'll head back first.

408
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,920
During the first two years
I was studying in Canada,

409
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,380
I returned to Manshi
every vacation to look for you.

410
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,440
But what about you?

411
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,690
Not a word from you.

412
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,340
I was so angry.

413
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,020
I swore I would never go back
to find you again.

414
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,690
Here, don't be angry.

415
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,450
But who knew?

416
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,880
In the third and fourth year,
I still couldn't resist.

417
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,660
Do you know

418
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,530
which time
left the deepest impression

419
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,690
on me?

420
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,530
Once at the airport,

421
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,490
I lost my laptop bag.

422
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,050
It wasn't the laptop that mattered,

423
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,910
but the keychain
you gave me that was attached to it.

424
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,690
I searched frantically everywhere,

425
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,940
but couldn't find it anywhere.

426
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,250
I was almost in tears.

427
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,380
Fortunately, in the end,

428
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,910
a cleaning lady found it
and returned it to me.

429
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,370
Thank goodness it was found.

430
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,080
I'm glad you found it.

431
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,790
It was my fault.

432
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,900
I made you suffer.

433
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,050
So you do know I suffered.

434
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,010
How do you plan to make it up to me?

435
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,100
How would you like me
to make it up to you?

436
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,810
What are you guys doing?

437
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,040
Would you like some red wine?

438
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,840
No, thanks.

439
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,930
The airplane food was terrible.

440
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,130
I'm starving.

441
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,240
Here.

442
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,150
Egg fried rice.

443
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,260
His fried rice is amazing.

444
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,520
Aren't you having any?

445
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:33,810
You go ahead.

446
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,290
What a shame.

447
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,170
No one loves egg fried rice
as much as you do.

448
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,580
Mind your own business.

449
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,690
I won't stay long this time.

450
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,740
I won't intrude
on your private time together.

451
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,670
It's your place.

452
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,060
Do as you please.

453
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,370
His place?

454
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,730
To be precise,

455
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,350
it's a company apartment.

456
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,770
But occasionally when I'm here
on business, I stay here

457
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:05,580
and annoy him.

458
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,100
Annoying indeed.

459
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,300
Then don't stay here.

460
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,570
Then stop eating.

461
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,630
Let him finish eating.

462
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:15,860
Sit down.

463
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,580
He came to Nanjing

464
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,700
even before his injury had healed.

465
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,000
No one could stop him.

466
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,350
I didn't know why back then,

467
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,490
but now...

468
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,730
I think I understand.

469
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,180
If it weren't for me,

470
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:35,970
you would have lost that leg.

471
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,370
You can have it back.

472
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,140
You know

473
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,920
that's not what I want.

474
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,180
There are things I have to do.

475
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,570
It would trouble me otherwise.

476
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,520
That's why I had to return to Nanjing.

477
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,560
Jin Zhao.

478
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,120
Will you...

479
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,690
ever drive again?

480
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,720
How have you been lately?

481
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,140
Are you feeling better?

482
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:25,870
Much better.

483
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,180
I even walked for half an hour yesterday.

484
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,550
You owe me a big favor.

485
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:34,970
How should I repay it?

486
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,440
I haven't decided yet.

487
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,420
What I wanted most was

488
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,660
to have one good race against you.

489
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:45,450
But

490
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,860
with your current physical condition,

491
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,960
honestly,

492
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,290
I think

493
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,550
you're pretty much done with racing.

494
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,220
Thank you for your honesty.

495
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,680
So,

496
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,250
what are you planning to do next?

497
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,690
I'm not sure yet.

498
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,660
I definitely can't just do nothing.

499
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,260
Since I can't race anymore, maybe...

500
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,850
I'll finish my studies.

501
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,680
I'll go study cars.

502
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,210
Interesting idea.

503
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,610
Mu

504
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,610
has always wanted me
to finish my studies, too.

505
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:27,640
Jiang Mu?

506
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:32,110
You haven't been in touch with her,
have you?

507
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,570
Like you said,

508
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,130
my body will never be the same again.

509
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,280
Mu should find someone...

510
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,150
healthier

511
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,330
to spend her life with.

512
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,420
I think

513
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,430
you're making decisions for her.

514
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,100
However,

515
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,400
I still respect your choice.

516
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,780
My club needs someone in a core position.

517
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,620
I now believe

518
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,190
the most important quality
for that position

519
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,320
isn't necessarily speed on the track.

520
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,110
My club

521
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,640
is still open to you.

522
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,340
You're welcome to join

523
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:22,970
anytime.

524
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:25,920
We'll see.

525
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:31,290
I gave him a condition at that time.

526
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,750
What condition?

527
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,290
I invested in a

528
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,940
racing club.

529
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,130
Asked him to mentor
the young people in the club,

530
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,230
and share his experience with them.

531
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,430
No wonder you often go on business trips.

532
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,820
He's a partner

533
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:52,660
at the club.

534
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,620
An exploited partner.

535
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,860
You have no idea how long I begged him

536
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,390
before he agreed to help me.

537
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,440
Enough.

538
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,970
What are you really here for today?

539
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,410
Jin Zhao, do you want to

540
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,640
return to the team and drive for me?

541
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:29,970
I've asked Dr. Julia.

542
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,620
She said your body has recovered now,

543
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,370
so you can try driving again.

544
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,030
As long as

545
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,260
you overcome your psychological barriers.

546
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,170
Taking compromising photos of me?

547
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:23,100
Now I have leverage over you.

548
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,770
For the next few questions I ask,

549
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,780
you'd better answer honestly.

550
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,580
What do you want to know?

551
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:34,030
Hearing from Sanlai and Crazy Jin today,

552
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,420
I'm very curious about
what you've been doing these 6 years.

553
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,880
I spent a few years abroad,

554
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,340
then came back to China.

555
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,580
When you were abroad,

556
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,130
who were you with?

557
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,140
Sanlai

558
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,480
and Crazy Jin.

559
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,620
Who else?

560
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,210
Tell me the truth.

561
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,450
Did Sanlai

562
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,580
contact you?

563
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,840
Yes, I had some free time today

564
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,680
and caught up with Sanlai.

565
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,110
I just spent a few years abroad.

566
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,110
The medical technology there is better.

567
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,710
I came back after treatment.

568
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,610
Answer me properly. With whom?

569
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:20,860
No one.

570
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,110
Look at you, hesitating to speak.

571
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,500
You don't have another woman, do you?

572
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:27,050
No.

573
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,340
Look.

574
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:29,900
You didn't deny it right away.

575
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,820
You hesitated.

576
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,930
You're not answering me.
You're not being honest.

577
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,410
I'm up.

578
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,640
Where is he?

579
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,730
Where did he go?

580
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:08,730
[We're out to buy breakfast. Wait for me.]

581
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,340
Don't block the way!

582
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,510
Why are you blocking? So annoying.

583
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,610
Sorry.

584
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,690
Save me a spot!

585
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,410
Are you always this crazy

586
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,050
when grocery shopping?

587
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,910
It's not usually like this.

588
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,490
Are you done?

589
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,230
This one

590
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,400
looks good.

591
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:18,490
Not fresh enough.

592
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,270
The potatoes are good.

593
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,340
Green pepper and
shredded potatoes would work.

594
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,230
Shredded potatoes are fine,

595
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,180
but not green peppers.

596
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,910
Mu doesn't like green peppers.

597
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,350
Ma'am, please weigh these.

598
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:34,980
Here.

599
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:38,990
-Pork ribs.
-2.80 yuan.

600
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,360
You're buying more?

601
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:42,490
Young man, 2.80.

602
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,060
Okay.

603
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,200
Sir, please weigh these ribs.

604
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,050
Sure.

605
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,350
Is the meat fresh?

606
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,400
Very fresh.

607
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,430
How much longer will we be?

608
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,050
Almost done.

609
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:57,210
Weren't you the one
who wanted to come along?

610
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,210
But I didn't expect this situation.

611
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,930
Wait a moment. One last thing.

612
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,710
Farm eggs.

613
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,580
Farm eggs?

614
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,710
-Sir, you haven't paid!
-What is that?

615
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,770
Pay up.

616
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,780
Pay over there with the QR code.

617
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,650
Okay.

618
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:30,810
Weigh these.

619
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:31,440
Okay.

620
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,790
Potatoes, eggs.

621
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:38,219
Got them.

622
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,179
Ribs.

623
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:40,460
Got it.

624
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:42,739
Cabbage, eggplant, cilantro.

625
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,699
Got them.

626
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,610
Edamame, cucumber.

627
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,090
Got them.

628
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:50,820
Green onions, lettuce, oranges, bananas.

629
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,570
Got everything?

630
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,420
Yes.

631
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,300
What are you smiling at?

632
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,550
You're acting strange.

633
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,790
How am I acting strange?

634
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,190
You're not planning

635
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:08,980
to marry Mu, are you?

00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:16,780
Excuse me.

638
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,180
Have you seen

639
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:18,890
a keychain?

640
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:20,220
-How does it look like?
-I really need help to find it.

641
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,770
It's... It's about this big.

642
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,900
-With four Chinese characters on it.
-Oh, okay.

643
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,740
Please, you have to help me.

644
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,130
-It's really important.
-Okay, I got it.

645
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,090
I'm begging you.

646
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:28,780
Please find it.

647
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,260
A passenger has lost an item.

648
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,780
It's a keychain

649
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,260
with four Chinese characters on it.

650
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:47,850
Excuse me.

651
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,630
Yes, sir.

652
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,260
I found a keychain.

653
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,960
It belongs to that girl.

654
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,120
Could you please give it to her?

655
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,510
-There are four Chinese words on it.
-Okay.

656
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,110
Thank you.

657
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,540
It's made of leather.

658
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,090
It says "Zhao and Mu" on it.

659
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,430
If anyone finds it,

660
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:06,120
please return it to the service desk.

661
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,850
Hello.

662
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,290
Is it this one?

00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,780
Yes, that's it.
