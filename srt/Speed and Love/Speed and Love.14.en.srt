Enough.

00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,120
I have someone I want to protect.

00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,410

00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,290

00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,520
Morning.

9
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,730
What is she doing? She's so jumpy.

10
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,240
What's wrong with Sister?

11
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,540
Still half asleep, I guess.

12
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,579
Why are you here so early today?

13
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,290
Zhao said you don't like dumplings,

14
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,060
so I specially made some dishes for you.

15
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,320
You can have some rice.

16
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,360
Thanks.

17
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,060

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,030
Thanks.

19
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,320
Is it good?

20
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,080
You don't want to get better?

21
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,250
I want to see if it makes me cough.

22
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,320
No way.

23
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,970
Don't all those women who race cars smoke?

24
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:24,820
Wan Qing smokes too.

25
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,530

26
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,110
How am I different?

27
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,970
This answer...

28
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,909
I'm not particularly satisfied with it.

29
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,450
It sounds like

30
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,620
I'm not so special after all.

31
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,870

35
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,540
I won't.

Otherwise,

Then let it be.

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
No, you must keep me.

Okay.

You don't accept these imported parts

62
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,090

00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,620

64

Your RX7

can hit 700 HP on the dyno.

74
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,130
But when I test-drove it earlier,

75
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,460
before I could floor it,

76
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,910
the engine started knocking.

77
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,530
With a Wankel engine,
knocking is inevitable.

78
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,810
Where did you get the parts?

79
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,120
I didn't use imported parts.

80
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,330
I made some myself.

81
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,610
But when the engine temperature
got too high,

82
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,610
the rotors and the crank started melting

83
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,740
and fused together.

84
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,750
Then buy some imported parts.

85
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,280
You can afford it.

86
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,800
Wan Shengbang
has monopolized all the supplies.

87
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,370
I even tried a bigger radiator,

88
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,400
but it couldn't handle it.

89
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,760
Crank, rotors—

90
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,040
these are all metal.

91
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,440
It's a matter of science,

92
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,700
not something you can solve by yourself.

93
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,770
So there's no other way?

94
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,430
I can only use those parts?

95
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,060
There's always a way.

96
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,890
Since you thought about the radiator,

97
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,390
you should know it's a cooling issue.

98
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,820
But a bigger radiator doesn't help much,

99
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,800
because the engine bay's cooling space

100
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,890
is limited.

101
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,400
Here.

102
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,760
This is...

103
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,680
the intercooler,

104
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,250
the radiator,

105
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,250
and the condenser.

106
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,090
Look.

107
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,520
There's no room left to adjust anything.

108
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,200
So we'll tackle each problem one by one.

109
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,790
The AC is already removed.

110
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,040
Use the extra power

111
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,210
for the cooling fan.

112
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:00,850
What did I just say?

113
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,250
There's no space left in the engine bay.

114
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,180
But don't you still have the trunk?

115
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,730
Find a spot, add a water tank,

116
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,690
and run a few pipes for water spray.

117
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,920
It can increase cooling capacity
even more.

118
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,860
If there's no space there,

119
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,520
find one elsewhere.

120
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,520
It's still the same logic
of cooling with water spray?

121
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,090
Modifying cars requires brains.

122
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,940
Why compete on metal hardware?

123
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,130
That old fool Wan Shengbang

124
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,790
hasn't learned anything
after all these years.

125
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,880
Same shady tricks

126
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,210
over and over.

127
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,170
You're the smart one.

128
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,040
All these years of drinking

129
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,770
still haven't made you stupid.

130
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,610
You little punk,

131
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,810
you don't want to learn from me anymore?

132
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,220
I'm leaving.

133
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,210
Wait.

134
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,370
What's the rush?

135
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,400
Going to modify the car.

136
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,250
No hurry.

137
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,730
I've got a delivery order here.

138
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,390
Help me deliver it on your way.

139
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,490
Where's the food?

140
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,520
What's the rush?

141
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,090
I haven't cooked it yet.

142
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,370

143
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,180

144
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,670
Don't forget to ask for a good review.

145
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,210
Where are you going?

146
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,730
It's okay. Let him in.

147
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,250
Your food.

148
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,860
I heard that restaurant's chef

149
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,760
cooks pretty randomly.

150
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,810
I thought I'd try my luck.

151
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,210
I didn't expect

152
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,650
a surprise delivered right to my door.

153
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:20,730
Well...

154
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,040
Your parts—

155
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,280
I sent them back.

156
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,680
I appreciate your kindness.

157
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,340
But I don't need them anymore.

158
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,110
This meal is on me.

159
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:34,490
By the way,

160
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,040
if you're not busy,

161
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,840
remember to leave a good review.

162
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,210
Thanks.

163
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,650
What should I write?

164
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,030
Whatever you want.

165
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,670
The food is really delicious and spicy.

166
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,160
The delivery man is damn hot.

167
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,010
Delete that.

168
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,920
Didn't you ask me
to give you a good review?

169
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,010
I asked you to review the food,

170
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,210
not me.

171
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,240
I asked what to write and you said

172
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,450
"whatever you want."

173
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,850
What will it take for you to delete it?

174
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,490
My fried rice.

175
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,610
I'll make it for you.

176
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,250
When?

177
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,490
Delete it first.

178
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,770
Make it for me first.

179
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,390
Tomorrow night.

180
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,730
At the Chinese restaurant.

181
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,730
Just the two of us?

182
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,280
Of course. Who else will there be?

183
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:42,920
Okay.

184
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,280
See you there.

185
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,760
Is he really that hot?

186
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,220
Pics or it didn't happen. Post a photo.

187
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,890
I'll arrive in Manshi tomorrow.

188
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,040
I'm going out for dinner in the evening.

189
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,370
Will I be able to see him?

190
00:14:58,890 --> 00:14:59,890
Tomorrow?

191
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,210
Sorry,

192
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,700
you won't get to see him.

193
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,280
I haven't seen him for 2 days.

194
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,320
What's he been busy with?

195
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,210
Sanlai said he went to Qingshi.

196
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,280
Qingshi again?

197
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,250
I wonder if he's

198
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,330
doing something dangerous again.

199
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:40,620
[Zhao]

200
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,560
I must trust Zhao.

201
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,130
He'll definitely come back safely.

202
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,430
Currently,
Liang Yanfeng's 350Z is in the lead.

203
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,730
He gained an advantage in the first half

204
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,190
and is currently in front.

205
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:27,920
D-God,

206
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,230
who do you think will take second?

207
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,240
I only care about first,

208
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,640
not second.

209
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,180
DRZ wants to overtake but lacks the skill.

210
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,530
Now it comes down to

211
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,190
Jin Zhao's RX7 versus the S200

212
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,340
to see who's better.

213
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,310
Brandy, 600 HP is your limit.

214
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,010
It would be embarrassing if you blow it.

215
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,460
Thanks for your concern.

216
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,520
That's your limit,

217
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,400
not mine.

218
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,590
RX7 is accelerating
and trying to overtake,

219
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,160
but Feng's defense is tight.

220
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,920
Passing

221
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,400
won't be easy.

222
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,310
RX7 disappeared!

223
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:31,810
No, it didn't.

224
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,660
It's still on the main line.

225
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,290
He seems to have turned off
the headlights.

226
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,550
What is he trying to do?

227
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,800
Jin Zhao's RX7 is in first place.

228
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,250
RX7 is still accelerating!

229
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:15,530
600 HP!

230
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,440
650 HP!

231
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,850
It looks like RX7 has gone past 700 HP.

232
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,810
D-God,
why did RX7 turn off its headlights?

233
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,720
It reduces wind resistance,

234
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,850
helps with a full-throttle sprint,

235
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,510
and throws off the opponents.

236
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,570
Most people wouldn't dare drive like that.

237
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,930
Even without imported parts,

238
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,370
he still managed to push the Wankel engine

239
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,640
to its limit

240
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,680
without overheating.

241
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,840
Interesting.

242
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,920
Brandy, you're going hard tonight.

243
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,850
You've already qualified.
No need to risk your life.

244
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,480
The Wankel-powered RX7
crossed the finish line!

245
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,200
Tonight's champion is RX7!

246
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,400
Not bad.

247
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:21,460
You did it again.

248
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,510
You went back on your word.

249
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,370
We agreed on tonight.

250
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:54,570
I'm sorry.

251
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:57,430
I forgot there was a race tonight.

252
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,960
Let me find a place for us to celebrate.

253
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,220
[Professional Oversleeper: Where are you?]

254
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,100
No, thanks.

255
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:12,850
Maybe another day.

256
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,160
You look tired.

257
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,570
Find a place to rest.

258
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,970
I need to get back to Manshi.

259
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,720
Overnight?

260
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:21,960
By the way,

261
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,230
how did you manage the cooling system?

262
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,930
Radiator, intercooler,

263
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,370
and AC evaporator—

264
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,850
arranged at certain angles.

265
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,130
Who taught you that?

266
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,690
That uncle who's always drunk.

267
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,070
Going out?

268
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,940
I haven't seen you for a few days again.

269
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,610
Still busy lately?

270
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,640
Why are you in such a hurry to save money?

271
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,890
Eager to get married?

272
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,800
Can you introduce someone to me?

273
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,810
Sure.

274
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,550
There are many beautiful girls
in my class.

275
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,130
I'm too busy.

276
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,140
I don't have time for that.

277
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,890
When you messaged me last night,

278
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,940
I was still in Qingshi.

279
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,480
I rushed back overnight
to take you to school.

280
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,480
And you're still pouting like this?

281
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,480
I'm not pouting.

282
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,920
See for yourself.

283
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:08,770
I'm not.

284
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,210
Let's go. Or you'll be late.

285
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,500
I'm not leaving.

286
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,670
I'll watch you go in.

287
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,020
I'll wait for you after school,

288
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,060
take you back to the garage,

289
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,270
and make something tasty for you.

290
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,190
Give me a smile.

291
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,290
Focus on your class.

292
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,860
I'll be waiting for you.

293
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,220
Why do you suddenly want to cook today?

294
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,690
You guys have always cooked for me before.

295
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:18,960
Today I want to show you my skills.

296
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,810
And hasn't Sanlai been saying
he wants to eat

297
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,670
squirrel-shaped mandarin fish?

298
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,860
Which one is the mandarin fish?

299
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,240
This one.

300
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,240
Sir, please gut this fish.

301
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,770
You'll have to wait in line.

302
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,530
Then just wrap it up.

303
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,920
Okay.

304
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:45,240
Don't they help gut the fish here?

305
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,560
Can't you see there's a line?

306
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,580
You know how to gut it, right?

307
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,030
Don't worry.

308
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,370
How can I not worry?

309
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,770
350.

310
00:26:58,610 --> 00:26:59,290
Thank you.

311
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,090
That guy...

312
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,770
That guy has been to the garage before,
right?

313
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,100
I don't know him.

314
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,160
You don't?

315
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,890
I think I've seen him
at the garage before.

316
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,770
Don't you remember?

317
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,900
Do you know how many people

318
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,610
come to the garage every day?

319
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:25,850
I'm swamped.

320
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,200
How can I remember everyone's face?

321
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,640
Here you go, sir.

322
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,850
-Thank you.
-Thank you for coming.

323
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:47,020
Is there anything else you want to eat?

324
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,390
This should be enough.

325
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,440
Then wait here for me.

326
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,570
I need to make a call.

327
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:03,360
What is it?

328
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,240
Check out the fruit.

329
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,770
What would you like?

330
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,070
I'll take two boxes.

331
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,610
100 per box.

332
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,930
If we wait another month,

333
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,160
strawberries will be much cheaper.

334
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,660
What if you don't want them a month later?

335
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,760
Who said I wanted to eat them?

336
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,230
I want them.

337
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:47,570
Thank you.

338
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,200
Is there enough oil?

339
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,660

340
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,160

have you been in

Maybe I can help.

It smells so good.
I want some strong coffee too.

423
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,130
You're too young.

424
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,640
No strong coffee for you.

425
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,230
Brandy,

426
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,130
I heard about it.

427
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,140
Top three in the alliance.

428
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,000
Impressive.

429
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,680

00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,090
let's celebrate.

431
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,610
Let's invite a few friends.

432
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,890
Bring Jiang Mu too.

433
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:38,900
Okay.

434
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:45,920
Is it good?

435
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,180
I guess I really am too young.

436
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:28,310
This courtyard
has such a great atmosphere.

437
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,260
You mean these lights?

438
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,480
They're the only thing

439
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,850
my ex left me.

440
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,969
Where is she now?

441
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,290
She's my ex now.

442
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:36,889
She once had a fight with me

443
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:38,100
over something trivial

444
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,560
and threatened to break up.

445
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,820
I didn't give in to her.

446
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,020
Then she got angry,

447
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,850
packed her things, and left.

448
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,830
Never came back.

449
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,400
Crazy Jin isn't good with women.

450
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,120
He goes through many breakups every year.

451
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,620
None of his relationships
lasted over 3 months.

452
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,409
What are you talking about?

453
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,480
Nana and I lasted more than 6 months.

454
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,820
You have the nerve to say that?

455
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,440
You dated for 2 months,

456
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,480
broke up for 6 months,
then got back together for half a month.

457
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,330
That's two and a half months total.

458
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:03,440
Not even 3.

459
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,520
How are you counting?

460
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,370
The whole process lasted 6 months.
That's half a year.

461
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:11,100
You two aren't much different.

462
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,810
But your ex was also called Nana?

463
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,290
All his exes

464
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,370
were either Nana or Nini.

465
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,180
Same names, different girls.

466
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,890
You have the nerve to say that?

467
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,440
You're still single.

468
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:25,600
Sanlai.

469
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,890
You've never had a girlfriend?

470
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:28,690
No.

471
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,330
He's been single since birth.

472
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,700
Didn't you date Nana before?

473
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,800
What are you saying? Don't talk nonsense.

474
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,930
We were just neighbors for a few years.

475
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,330
His dad was my aunt's ex-boyfriend.

476
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:45,650
Your aunt?

477
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:47,770
Lin Sui's mother?

478
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,600
No, not Lin Sui's. Another aunt.

479
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,210
Sanlai's mom is from Northeast China.

480
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,290
She was my mom's college classmate.

481
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:54,170
So we've known each other since childhood.

482
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,770
After his parents divorced,

483
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,960
his dad took him and moved away,

484
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,820
so we weren't neighbors anymore.

485
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,080
Northeast China?

486
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,330
No wonder Sanlai's eating habits

487
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,260
are so northern.

488
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,000
He loves noodles and dumplings.

489
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,250
He doesn't just eat them himself.

490
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,330
He makes us eat too.

491
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,120
Now our eating habits

492
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,980
are all influenced by him.

493
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,210
Why did it take you so long
to bring the alcohol?

494
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,340
Come on, why did you only bring one box?

495
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,060
This isn't enough for anyone.

496
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:23,870
Can you even handle that much?

497
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,130
My nickname is "Box-by-box Drinker."

498
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,300
Come on.

499
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,080
Mu, one for you.

500
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:32,490
Yang.

501
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,860
-Don't drink too much.
-Here.

502
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,860
Thank you, Crazy.

503
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,390
We're at my place today.

504
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,520
There are plenty of drinks.
Help yourselves.

505
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,400
I'll be upset
if someone doesn't drink enough.

506
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:43,850
Come on!

507
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:44,920
-Let's drink together.
-Here, here.

508
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,730
Bottoms up!

509
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:48,370
Catch the ducks!

510
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,000
How many?

511
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:49,910
Quack!

512
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,000
-I said "how many!"
-You have to catch them first.

513
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,600
You haven't caught them yet.

514
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,400
I can't keep up.

515
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,800
-I'll punish myself with a drink.
-Come on.

516
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,950
Cheers.

517
00:36:58,910 --> 00:36:59,970
-Come on.
-Come on.

518
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,850
It's such a fun day.

519
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,310
Why didn't Iron Cock come?

520
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,850
He had to go home for something.

521
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,270
Alright, let's continue.

522
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,210
Let's continue. Starting with you.

523
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:11,140
Catch the ducks!

524
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:11,930
How many?

525
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,730
Five!

526
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:13,520
Got them!

527
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:14,250
Quack.

528
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,100
Quack.

529
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,600
Quack.

530
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:01,770
Catch the ducks!

531
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:02,210
How many?

532
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:02,810
Three!

533
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:03,700
Got them!

534
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,510
-Quack.
-Quack.

535
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:04,850
Quack.

536
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:05,400
Catch the ducks!

537
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,000
How many?

538
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,760
I need to take a call.

539
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,810
Hey, get me some more skewers.

540
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:14,490
Get me some skewers.

541
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:16,210
-Crazy Jin wants skewers.
-This is good.

542
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,520
The balcony is good, right?

543
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:17,960
It's awesome.

544
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,290
Come by more often. Make yourself at home.

545
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,100
No problem.

546
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:21,690
Okay.

547
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:22,960
Let's switch to another game.

548
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,770
Let's play this. Let's play cards.

549
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,040
Let me think...

550
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,100
Just guess black or red
and compare the numbers.

551
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,310
Starting with you.

552
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,850
Black or red?

553
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,560
Black.

554
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,410
Red.

555
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,060
See?

556
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,580
-It's black.
-Drink up!

557
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,130
The first one, black or red?

558
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:38,960
Black.

559
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,120
Drink up.

560
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:41,440
Red.

561
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,470
-Drink up.
-I'll drink too.

562
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:44,210
You.

563
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:44,850
Black.

564
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,370

569
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,170
