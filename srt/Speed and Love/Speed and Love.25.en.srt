[Episode 25]

3
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,060
Still running a fever?

4
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,680
Feel it yourself.

5
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,190
Let's go in.

6
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,310
Moonlight. Not on the menu.

7
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:43,720
Try it.

8
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,510
Watching them prepare crabs

9
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,480
reminds me of our childhood.

10
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,550
Every Mid-Autumn Festival,

11
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,950
Mom would buy crabs for us too.

12
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,280
I still have a box at home.

13
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,890
You're taking me to your home?

14
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,320
You've been here before?

15
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,380
Let's go.

16
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,390
Do you have any women's slippers?

17
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,110
The ones Dr. Julia wears.

18
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,950
Would you like to wear them?

19
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,920
I'll stick with these, then.

20
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,190
Did you

21
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,030
buy this place or rent it?

22
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,270
I bought it.

23
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,800
Looks like you're doing pretty well.

24
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,950
Then you wouldn't mind

25
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,550
if I just look around, right?

26
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,230
Wait.

27
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,080
Are you hiding someone here?

28
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,640
Didn't you already run into one before?

29
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,800
Dr. Julia looks really good for her age.

30
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,560
She's over 50 but looks like she's 30.

31
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,390
I thought she was your wife.

32
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,810
You've got quite the imagination.

33
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
I'm going in then.

34
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,210
Just messing with you.

35
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,730
I grew up with your pranks.

36
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,600
Let me help too.

37
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,680
You know how?

38
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,070
I have to.

39
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,440
No one has taken care of me
all these years.

40
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,900
I'd have starved to death
if I couldn't cook.

41
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,920
No one to take care of you?

42
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,880
No one has

43
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,040
pursued you all these years?

44
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,680
Quite a few.

45
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,040
Then why didn't you date anyone?

46
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,070
I did.

47
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,600
One of them was even in a rock band.

48
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,680
Once,

49
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,750
he took me to a remote mountain area

50
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,540
where there was a frozen lake.

51
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,710
He jumped right in

52
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,280
and wanted me to jump in too.

53
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,600
Seriously?

54
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,000
Will you believe anything I say?

55
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,820
Running out of things to talk about, huh?

56
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,620
No, I've got plenty more.

57
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,070
[Sanlai]

58
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,390
Brandy.

59
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,360
If you're not coming over,
we'll come to you.

60
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,390
About two hours.

61
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,150
It's no fun being alone
during the holiday.

62
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,480
I'm not alone right now.

63
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,380
Sorry,

64
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:35,370
I forgot about Lightning.

65
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,809
Anyway, don't worry. We'll be there soon.

66
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,580
Sorry, dude.

67
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,860
I'm hanging up now. Sorry to bother you.

68
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,960
My lifelong reputation

69
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,530
is ruined by you.

70
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,510
I'll take responsibility for that.

71
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,800
What would you like to drink?

72
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,610
I'll have some of your wine.

73
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
You want to drink?

74
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,390
Can't I?

75
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,330
What will you have?

76
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,440
I'll just have water.

77
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,320
How's your mom?

78
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,620
Her health has improved a lot.

79
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,270
All these years in Canada,

80
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,510
I've been taking her
to follow-up appointments.

81
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,960
She's gradually gotten used to life there.

82
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,980
For me?

83
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,750
I like to dip my crab in vinegar.

84
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,650
After all these years,

85
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,390
he's still as attentive as ever.

86
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,520
Don't drink too much.

87
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,470
Don't expect me to take care of you
if you get drunk.

88
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,460
You used to say that too.

89
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,270
Zhao.

90
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:58,690
Brother...

91
00:11:58,930 --> 00:11:59,520
No.

92
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,080
Jin Zhao.

93
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,910
Considering you went through

94
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,110
something this big without telling me,

95
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,930
I've decided

96
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,200
to disown you as my sibling.

97
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,150
Cheers.

98
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,880
You know I'm still an intern, right?

99
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,550
The internship salary is really low.

100
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,880
Every month, I have to pay for rent,

101
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,740
water, electricity, and gas.

102
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,320
When I was in school,

103
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,330
Mom always supported me financially.

104
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,780
Now that I'm on my own,

105
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,230
I can't keep asking her for money.

106
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,560
I feel like I can barely
afford to eat anymore.

107
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,050
You want to borrow some money?

108
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,280
I want to move in with you.

109
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,630
No way.

110
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,320
Why not?

111
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,010
You're living alone anyway.

112
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,020
If I move in,

113
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,080
I can help with your living expenses.

114
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,010
And although I'm just an intern now

115
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,050
and don't make much,

116
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,450
once I become permanent,

117
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,750
I'll make more, and I can scrimp and save

118
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,900
to contribute to household expenses.

119
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,610
Thanks for your kind offer.

120
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,010
But who knows who'll be supporting whom?

121
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,390
No.

122
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,240
Zhao, hear me out.

123
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,500
That roommate of mine—

124
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,050
he disappears every night

125
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,510
and always plays weird music in the room.

126
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,270
It really affects my work.

127
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,350
I honestly just want to
move somewhere else.

128
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,060
You haven't changed your old habits.

129
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,880
Once you come over,
you cling to me and won't leave.

130
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,340
I'm not clinging to other people.

131
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,600
When I was sending Jiang Mu off just now,

132
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,750
I told her straight—

133
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,880
if you don't want her

134
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,920
or if she's not happy there,

135
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,160
come back, and I'll take her.

136
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,680
Guess what she said?

137
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,790
She said you

138
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,690
would never abandon her.

139
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,950
You've really made up your mind?

140
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,490
When her mom was pregnant with her...

141
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,830
her mom's health was never good.

142
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,420
She was born prematurely,

143
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
at eight months.

144
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,990
She weighed just over 4 jin at birth.

145
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,380
Her dad and I

146
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:51,490
watched her lying in the incubator
through the glass.

147
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,560
I thought to myself then...

148
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,780
such a tiny baby,

149
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,120
could we keep her alive?

150
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,600
So when we were kids,

151
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,750
whenever possible,

152
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,630
I always gave in to her.

153
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,800
Because I always felt

154
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,370
it was already a miracle
that she was alive.

155
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,000
She was picky about food,

156
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,730
ate very little...

157
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,910
and always caught colds and fevers.

158
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,480
Every change of season,

159
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,320
we'd take her to the hospital.

160
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,380
She cried a lot too.

161
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,120
Even a tiny bug...

162
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,230
would frighten her to tears.

163
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,640
Then she'd reach out for me to hold her.

164
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,390
But she was easy to comfort.

165
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,450
Just distract her

166
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,740
and talk about something else,
and she'd smile.

167
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,680
When I was little, I thought that

168
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,510
if she ever wanted to get married...

169
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,160
she should find someone
who understands her,

170
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,630
knows her temperament,

171
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:12,780
can comfort her,

172
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,210
and knows what she likes to eat,

173
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,830
what she doesn't eat,

174
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,510
what she fears...

175
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,060
and what she hates.

176
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,120
If she ever ended up with someone

177
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,790
who made her suffer,

178
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,880
I'd beat that bastard to death.

179
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,150
Sanlai.

180
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,710
I can't keep her by my side.

181
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,880
I can't let suffer because of me,
even a little bit.

182
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,800
I can't make her life difficult.

183
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,839
I can't be that bastard.

184
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,520
The moon is so round
and beautiful tonight.

185
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,280
Look over there. Over there.

186
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,520
Let me ask you something.

187
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,440
When you went back last time...

188
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,690

00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,430
resulting in limited mobility.

368
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,160
Later, his muscle strength
began to decline.

369
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,710
For him,

370
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,670
recovery is a slow process,

371
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,910
and we need to be with him
every step of the way.

372
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,360
Okay,

373
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,640
I understand.

374
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,920
[Observatory]

375
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,120
Jiang Mu.

376
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,920
What's this?

377
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,080
I have a favor to ask.

378
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:40,910
Tomorrow, we need to host several

379
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,360
visitors from other provinces for a tour
of the observatory.

380
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,470
The leadership wants

381
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,430
someone with a good presence,

382
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,080
as they will represent
our institute's image as well.

383
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,740
I immediately thought of you.

384
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,010
How about it? Can you help me tomorrow?

385
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:51,990
No problem.

386
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,430
It's settled then.

387
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,560
I'll head off first.

388
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,280
How's that?
Pretty thoughtful of me, right?

389
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,560
I know you've been swamped lately.

390
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,280
Thought I'd pull you out
for some fresh air.

391
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,360
Thanks a lot.

392
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,520
Don't mention it.
The leaders will be here shortly.

393
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,710
The building we're visiting now

394
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,110
was constructed in 1929.

395
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,150
It has a long history

396
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:25,600
and is our country's
first modern observatory.

397
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,150
Located on the peak of Purple Mountain,

398
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,470
it embodies
a strong traditional Chinese aesthetic.

399
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,470
Next, we'll

400
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,910
visit the summit.

401
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,230
Here we have
the 60-centimeter reflecting telescope

402
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,080
at the summit of Purple Mountain.

403
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,470
This reflecting telescope

404
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,760
dates back to 1934.

405
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,410
Its focal length...

406
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,380
Let's go inside for a closer look.

407
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,650
[Jin Zhao]

408
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,880
When do you get off work?

409
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,190
I'm showing some visitors around
the observatory.

410
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,920
It'll be over in a little while.

411
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,120
Then carry on with your work.

412
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:04,990
Jiang Mu.

413
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,950
They have other plans for tonight.

414
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,410
We just need to see them off
to their vehicle.

415
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,870
Want to have hot pot together tonight?

416
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,350
I already have plans.

417
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,660
Alright then.

418
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:17,720
Let's go.

419
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,250
Let's go.

420
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,630
Listen, don't always
bury yourself in work.

421
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:29,160
You're not getting any younger.
Consider finding a boyfriend.

422
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,710
Why are you here?

423
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,550
Didn't I tell you to wait for me

424
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:38,550
-at the foot of the mountain?
-I wanted to come see you.

425
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,180
How did you get up here?

426
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:45,880
By cable car.

427
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,460
Why are you making such a fuss
about him coming up the mountain?

428
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,670
Who is this?

429
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,470
My name is Gu Zhijie.

430
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:57,630
I'm Jiang Mu's

431
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:58,910
half-colleague?

432
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,120
And this is?

433
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,990
My ex-boyfriend of one week.

434
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,370
I've heard a lot about you.

435
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,950
What do you mean by "half-colleague"?

436
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,280
I'm Jiang Mu's senior from school.

437
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,560
Although we don't work together,

438
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,020
I kind of tricked her into
coming to Nanjing.

439
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,550
We're all in the same field,

440
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,470
so we're half-colleagues.

441
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,390
Qin and I will
see the leaders off tonight.

442
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,560
You're really not
coming to dinner tonight?

443
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,910
I'll call you later.

444
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,090
Okay.

445
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,020
Then I'll get back to work.

446
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,510
Half-colleague.

447
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,270
Is this your first time up here?

448
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,480
Want me to give you a tour?

449
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,330
If it's convenient for you.

450
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,840
Convenient or not, you're already here.

451
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,100
Wouldn't it be a waste not to look around?

452
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,490
I already told you.

453
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,480
I just came to see you.

454
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,280
To see me?

455
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,960
So, what have you observed?

456
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
I came to see...

457
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,540
if I've scared you away again.

458
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,800
And what's your conclusion?

459
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,080
This celestial globe before us

460
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,360
is cast in bronze

461
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,520
and can rotate.

462
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,330
It's about three chi in diameter

463
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,190
and is embedded with

464
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,080
1,449 bronze pins,

465
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,520
representing the stars

466
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,920
visible to the naked eye.

467
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,910
Is this ring

468
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,390
the meridian circle?

469
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,320
That's right.

470
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,230
Mr. Visitor, you know your astronomy.

471
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,170
Just a little.

472
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,710
This is a celestial globe,

473
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:09,390
called Huntianyi or Hunxiang
in ancient times.

474
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,080
Back in the Eastern Han Dynasty,

475
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,230
there was a star-gazing boy

476
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,090
named Zhang Heng who improved it,

477
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:14,880
giving it the function

478
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,410
of demonstrating celestial body movements.

479
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,950
My work focuses on

480
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,600
the dynamics of

481
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,400
multi-body celestial systems.

482
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,040
Come to think of it,

483
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,220
you were actually the one
who first introduced me to all this.

484
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,680
Have you been busy lately?

485
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,100
Let me ask you something.

486
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,320
If I really had a fiancé

487
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,930
who loved playing games

488
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,600
and chasing women,

489
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,020
what would you do?

490
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,490
Do you want the truth?

491
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,390
Of course.

492
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,890
I'd make you willingly...

493
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,020
dump him before the wedding.

494
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:12,159
Willingly dump him?

495
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,710
And be with you instead?

496
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,480
Let me ask you another question.

497
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,810
What if I really got scared off

498
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:38,449
after seeing that report?

499
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,159
Then I should...

500
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:50,290
still be able to catch the last cable car
down the mountain.

501
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,070
So...

502
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,810
have you made up your mind?

503
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,730
I want to take you somewhere first.

504
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,760
Do you see that?

505
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,880
Every year at this time,

506
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,200
the Earth's orbit around the Sun

507
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,030
and the Moon's orbit around the Earth

508
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,430
undergo slight changes.

509
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,160
The moon and sun

510
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,480
appear simultaneously on the horizon,

511
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:45,990
creating the phenomenon
of the sun and moon shining together.

512
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,890
The sun and moon alternate.

513
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,430
Even natural laws aren't absolute,

514
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,850
let alone people.

515
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:13,650
Do you get...

516
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,410
what I'm trying to say?

517
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,620
The sun shines by day,

518
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,960
and the moon by night.

519
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,390
The sun and moon shine together.

520
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,750
You and I

521
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,200
will never be apart.

522
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,240
This is my answer.
