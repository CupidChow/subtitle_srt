00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:48,740
[Episode 29]

3
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,930
What are you thinking about?

4
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,890
Can't sleep?

5
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,330
Why can't you sleep either?

6
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,560
On the way here,
didn't you say you were sleepy?

7
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,040
I can't sleep either.

8
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:32,730
I didn't expect you'd prepare all this.

9
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,930
If I don't prepare,

10
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,450
how can I marry you?

11
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,010
Tomorrow,

12
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,050
I'll have a good talk with Mom.

13
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:55,960
It's okay.

14
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,050
At least

15
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,680
she hasn't kicked me out yet,

16
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,920
which is already good progress.

17
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,610
Why are you in someone else's room

18
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,209
in the middle of the night
instead of sleeping?

19
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,630
Go back now.

20
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,040
That thing during the day got delayed,

21
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,500
so it wasn't finished.

22
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,320
So I want to get it done

23
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,810
before going to bed.

24
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,120
Otherwise,

25
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,160
tomorrow would bring more things
to deal with.

26
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,490
Do you still remember how to fix it?

27
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,500
I think I do.

28
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:37,850
You do it.

29
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,970
That's just how I am.

30
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,409
When daytime tasks

31
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,000
aren't done,

32
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,260
I can't even sleep peacefully.

33
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,590
But Jin Qiang doesn't think this way.

34
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,280
To him, doing it today,

35
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,930
tomorrow,

36
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,730
or days later

37
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,440
makes no difference.

38
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,320
I remember

39
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,820
he had terrible procrastination issues.

40
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,490
Once

41
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,910
the window screens at home got dirty,

42
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,770
I asked him
to take them down and wash them.

43
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,610
He actually took

44
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,570
over a week before finally doing it.

45
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,220
Little things like that

46
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,320
kept us arguing nonstop.

47
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,170
I remember back then,

48
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,800
in our old place in Nanjing,

49
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,360
I loved growing plants.

50
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,210
The apartment was small

51
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,930
and already cluttered.

52
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,670
But Jin Qiang

53
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,800
thought they were pointless

54
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,420
and wouldn't let me keep them.

55
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,090
He even smashed them.

56
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,090
Jin Qiang, don't!

57
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,560
-Love to keep them, huh?
-No!

58
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,000
The house is so small,

59
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,360
and you're cluttering it with
all this useless stuff!

60
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,290
Remember:

61
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:49,409
as a man, you should be responsible.

62
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,220
When faced with problems and difficulties,

63
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,760
you need to solve them,

64
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,690
not avoid or run away

65
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,170
from them,

66
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,340
because that's the ultimate sign
of cowardice.

67
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,000
Got it.

68
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,650
Back then,

69
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,490
we were drawn together

70
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,830
by each other's shine.

71
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,120
But after we actually got together,

72
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,140
all those life's trivial problems

73
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,240
turned everything into a mess.

74
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,960
In endless arguments,

75
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,720
we slowly used up

76
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,159
what little love we had left.

77
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,500
Do you blame me?

78
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,380
I remember

79
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,960
you once told me

80
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,200
that when pruning this kind of tree,

81
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,010
you should cut
some of the really dense leaves inside

82
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,480
to keep the branches airy.

83
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,470
That way the leaves

84
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,250
won't yellow or wither so easily.

85
00:09:59,010 --> 00:09:59,720
Mu

86
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,810
has been spoiled by me
since she was little.

87
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,930
In the future,

88
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,630
don't let her have her way in everything.

89
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,640
Otherwise,

90
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,730
you'll suffer for it.

91
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:15,440
It's fine.

92
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,250
I'll just keep spoiling her.

93
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,110
Here, give it to me.

94
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,550
Are you cold?

95
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:35,960
No, I'm not.

96
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:20,970
Careful.

97
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:21,910
That one.

98
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,300
This one, right?

99
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,280
Be careful.

100
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,850
Okay.

101
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,240
Here, try this one.

102
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,190
Here, hang it here.

103
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,560
Yes.

104
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,840
It's crooked.

105
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,140
See? Isn't this prettier?

106
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,350
Right?

107
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:42,980
This one is good.

108
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,750
Zhao.

109
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,400
What were you talking about?

110
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,600
Really?

111
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,730
Really nothing.

112
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,690
Are you still upset?

113
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,320
No, I'm not.

114
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,410
Well...

115
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,910
do you want to back out?

116
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,070

united as one family,

and celebrate Chinese New Year.

163
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,600
Let's raise our glasses together.

164
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,130
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

165
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,480
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!

166
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,800
I spent the whole afternoon
making these dishes,

167
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,480
so you must finish them all.

168
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,310
Here, have some soup first.

169
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,290
Have some more of my homemade soup.

170
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,270
Thank you, Mom.

171
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,010
The second bowl is for Sophia.

172
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,760
Yes. Beautiful.

173
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,680
Thank you.

174
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:42,650
Here.

175
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,370
Chinese New Year isn't complete
without dumplings.

176
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,970
Happy New Year.

177
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,570
You must eat dumplings for the New Year.

178
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,870
Here.

179
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,349
Wait for me a moment.

180
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:46,850
This—

181
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,000
Take it back.

182
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,640
Since you were young,

183
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:55,450
you've never had elders around
to support you,

184
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,640
so you've had to rely on yourself
for everything,

185
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,780
and that's a lot of pressure.

186
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,460
Auntie,

187
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,780
I can handle it.

188
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,250
This is just a small token from me.

189
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,610
You're still as stubborn as you were

190
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,480
when you were little.

191
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,310
Alright then.

192
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,050
I'll keep it for you.

193
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,330
Jin Zhao.

194
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:56,520
Uncle.

195
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,370
Yinghan asked me to give this to you.

196
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,330
This is...

197
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,720
She didn't say what it was,

198
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,380
just asked me to pass it to you.

199
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,670
Take it.

200
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,750
Alright, Uncle.

201
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,980
Mom, we're leaving.

202
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,760
When you get back, work hard,

203
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,680
sleep well, eat properly,

204
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,930
and take good care of yourself.

205
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,500
Let me know once you land safely.

206
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,680
Remember to take good care of yourself.

207
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,930
So that you can take care of her.

208
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,670
Don't forget

209
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,610
what you promised me.

210
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,130
Come.

211
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,530
You two

212
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:37,890
must both be well.

213
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,250
Thank you, Mom.

214
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,040
It's about time.

215
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:02,960
Go now.

216
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:30,410
Mom, look.

217
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,980
Is my drawing pretty?

218
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,630
So pretty, so cute.

219
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,410
But it's still not as cute and pretty

220
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,270
as my daughter.

221
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:38,780
It's wonderful.

222
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,720
Mom, what are you doing?

223
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,200
I just knitted you a scarf.

224
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,680
It's winter now.

225
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,390
Your neck can't get cold,

226
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,520
so I made you a scarf.

227
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,590
That's nice. Go play now.

228
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,340
Zhao, you're back.

229
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,720
Look, Mom knitted me a new scarf.

230
00:21:58,890 --> 00:21:59,620
Is it pretty?

231
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,000
Yes.

232
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,550
I'm going to play with my friends now.

233
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:08,830
Jin Zhao,

234
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:10,280
come here.

235
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,350
Are you cold?

236
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,620
Are you cold?

237
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,790
Go do your homework.

238
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,090
Although he's not my biological child,

239
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,790
I raised him with my own hands.

240
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,390
Looking back now,

241
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,150
I realize that back then

242
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,270
I projected my resentment toward Jin Qiang

243
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,380
onto that little kid,

244
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,130
making him bear

245
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,990
a lot of negative emotions
he never should have had.

246
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,130
As time passed

247
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,300
and I reexamined myself,

248
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I realized
he must have had some expectations of me.

249
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,480
Those days we can never return to

250
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,070
remain a regret.

251
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,600
Wait here for me. I'll go get us coffee.

252
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,160
Okay.

253
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,660
Mu is in your hands now.

254
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,380
Take good care of her,

255
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,560
and yourself too.

256
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,030
This scarf

257
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,880
made you wait for 18 years.

258
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,310
Don't blame Mom.

259
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,850
The coffee's here.

260
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,680
What's wrong? Is something bothering you?

261
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,680
Last time I noticed

262
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,610
your "yearning day and night" keychain
was worn out,

263
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,630
so I thought I'd get you a new one.

264
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,500
Where is it?

265
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,170
Close your eyes.

266
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,840
Why are you being mysterious?

267
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,410
Can I open my eyes now?

but we were torn apart.

273
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:55,960

You've got a double chin.

Let us have him for the bachelor party.

00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,410
I'm not texting him.

339
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,810

-Are you chatting with Jiang Mu?

00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,010
Always drinking. Come on.

00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,450

350
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,890
-You're really meddling too much.
-They should sit together.

351
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,000
You got dragged down.

352
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,200
A gentleman doesn't fight with a woman.

353
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,130
Together. It's more fun that way.

354
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:44,240
Are you groomsmen capable of it?

355
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,330
Don't mess up the wedding tomorrow.

356
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,340
Who are you saying isn't capable?

357
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,090
That sounds so unpleasant.

00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,620

00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,570

Just make sure you answer the questions,

368
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,520
or you won't even get through the door.

369
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,720
Come on, how hard can your questions be?

370
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,420
How hard can our questions be?

371
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,810
We have plenty of hard questions.

372
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,930
Our questions are about traditions
of the Chinese...

373
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,650
Stop asking.

374
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,750
You'll see tomorrow.

375
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,380
Don't make things too hard for us.

376
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,050
Don't you want your friend to get married?

377
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,380
That's impossible.

378
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,720
Let me give you a tip.

379
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,890
You guys

380
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,480
can make up for your lack of brains
with red envelopes,

381
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,040
so you won't fail to win the bride.

382
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,300
Red envelopes make up for brains?

383
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,580
Our brains are more than enough.

384
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,000
Right, Brandy?

385
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,440
You can mess with us

386
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,020
all you want tomorrow,

387
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,470
but my brother Brandy

388
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,060
has to marry Jiang Mu.

389
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,340
Am I a real brother?

390
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,570
So tomorrow you're getting married.

391
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,480
Bride,

392
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:14,590
how do you feel?

393
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,200
Honestly,

394
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,660
I don't really know how I feel.

395
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,900
You don't know?

396
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,330
I thought you'd say something

397
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,960
like nervous or excited.

398
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,040
Yeah.

399
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,560
People say

400
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,760
marriage is a milestone,

401
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:29,620
where you say goodbye to youth.

402
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,000
But for me,

403
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,440
the ones I love are all by my side,

404
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,650
and my youth

405
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,390
is right here with me.

406
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,200
Don't worry, everyone.

407
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,480
I've already done a lot of divinations.

408
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,960
Tomorrow's wedding will be perfect.

409
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,540
You don't believe me?
I can do it again right now.

410
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,650
No need to do it.

411
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,190
I'm already set on him.

412
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,350
Then let me interview Brandy.

413
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,330
Are you nervous?

414
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,920
That's a silly question.

415
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:01,930
Well,

416
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,440
he's a boxer

417
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,720
and a racer.

418
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,760
The whole world could be nervous,

419
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,960
but he won't be.

420
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,520
The only variable

421
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:10,650
is you

422
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,320
fainting at the wedding.

423
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,200
Brandy,

424
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,410
nervous?

425
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,280
A little.

426
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,570
I wish you two

427
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,140
a marriage

428
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,060
that lasts forever.

429
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,030
Absolutely!

430
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,250
Tomorrow, leave the wedding to us.

431
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,680
It'll definitely be a success!

432
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,330
Cheers!

433
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,330
Come on!

434
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,860
Come on! Bottoms up.

435
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,150
-Bottoms up!
-Cheers!

436
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:36,600
Time to get up.

437
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,469
Pan Kai.

438
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,840
Keep drinking!

439
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:46,650
Liang Yanfeng?

440
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,360
Drink with us...

441
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,810
What?

442
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,710
Crazy.

443
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,020
Crazy?

444
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:55,340
Lin Sui!

445
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,680
Sanlai!

446
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,190
Let me sleep a bit more.

447
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,870
Time to get up.

448
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,300
Sister!

449
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,290
Wake up! It's the wedding day.

450
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:37,890
What?

451
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,000
Hello, hello. Wake up.

452
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,690
I'm getting married.

453
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,330
Nana! Stop sleeping, Nana.

454
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,530
Nana! Nana!

455
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,820
I can't drink anymore!

456
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,290
What should we do?

457
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:54,470
My bridesmaids don't seem able to attend.

458
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,160
Mine too.

459
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,090
Just the two of us will be enough.

460
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,520
Let's elope.

461
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,090
Where are you two going?

462
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,190
Come back!

463
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,080
