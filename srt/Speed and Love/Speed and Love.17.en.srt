[Speed and Love]

00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:48,789
[Episode 17]

3
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:56,800
Well...

4
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,960
Mrs. Zhao.

5
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,120
Could you please not

6
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,620
tell my dad about what happened just now?

7
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,290
Mu,

8
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,700
I probably

9
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,960
shouldn't be the one saying this,

10
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:32,120
but I've watched Zhao grow up.

11
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,120
Life hasn't been easy on him these years.

12
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,450
He's been through a lot.

13
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,930
He's a reliable young man.

14
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,079
But I think...

15
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,560
Your mom

16
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,020
definitely won't approve.

17
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,010
You really need

18
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,700
to think this through carefully.

19
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,120
Honestly speaking,

20
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,520
I want Zhao to lead a good life.

21
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,770
Actually, since you came here,

22
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,730
I've already noticed

23
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,240
that you've had your mind

24
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,290
on him this whole time.

25
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,010
I came here just for him.

26
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,050
And I stayed for him, too.

27
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,650
Mrs. Zhao,

28
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,850
please help me.

29
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,170
Then let's just pretend

30
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,680
that I didn't see

31
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,590
what happened today.

32
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:55,490
Go get some rest.

33
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,000
How's it?

34
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,080
Did you find Jiang Mu?

35
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,780
He's in Jin Qiang's place.

36
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,050
When you called me,

37
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,610
I was almost worried sick.

38
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,240
Is she okay?

39
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,800
Listen, this is your fault.

40
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,130
You didn't explain things clearly to her.

41
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,820
This is way too dangerous.

42
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,090
I don't want her to get involved.

43
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,760
But that doesn't mean you can
hide it from her.

44
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,760
What else can I do?

45
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,170
Tell her.

46
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,120
And make her worry about me?

47
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,730
You think you're protecting her.

48
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,220
You think she can't do anything.

49
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,550
Have you ever asked her?

50
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,400
Anyway, everything I did was

51
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,290
for her own good.

52
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,460
For her own good?

53
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,410
Do you know what she thinks?

54
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,570
Why do you think it was for her own good?

55
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,650
You think you know it better than me?

56
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,850
I just know it better!

57
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,050
You know what? I've heard the phrase,

58
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,700
"for his good," too many times
since I was little.

59
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,700
It's completely useless, you know?

60
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,200
I don't want to argue with you.

61
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,120
Brandy!

62
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,970
Can you stop being so arrogant?

63
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,390
There's no way you can keep this a secret.

64
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,980
Today, she found out by accident.

65
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,290
But what about next time?

66
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,620
And the time after that?

67
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,530
Are you going to hide it
every single time?

68
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,409
Instead of letting others tell her,

69
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:36,120
why don't you tell her yourself?

70
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,780
Because I know what I'm doing!

71
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,890
She's my girlfriend.

72
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,970
I don't need you to teach me.

73
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,440
Yes.

74
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,220
She is your girlfriend.

75
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,280
But she is Jiang Mu first!

76
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,240
Why are you here?

77
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,880
I'm here
because I want you to persuade Jin Zhao

78
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,170
to stay away
from the Association's affairs.

79
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,230
What Association?

80
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,220
You don't need to know about that.

81
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,570
Anyway, just talk to him.

82
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,210
He'll listen to you.

83
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,050
He's different from others.

84
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,440
If he just works steadily,

85
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,120
he'll make his mark someday.

86
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,760
He shouldn't get involved in those things.

87
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,530
What things?

88
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,650
You wouldn't understand
even if I told you.

89
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,380
I also overheard it from my dad.

90
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,300
Anyway, just make sure he stays away
from the Association no matter what.

91
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,960
The people there are dangerous.

92
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,090
They'll eat him alive

93
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,550
and leave nothing behind.

94
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,880
Jiang Mu,

95
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,000
you must try everything to persuade him

96
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,930
to stay away from the Association.

97
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,240
Tell him to quit

98
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,090
whatever he's doing right now.

99
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,380
Jin Zhao,

100
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:39,980
I need to talk to you.

101
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:57,600
Last night, I wasn't...

102
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,410
I know.

103
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,960
Zhao.

104
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,600
No matter what you're planning to do,

105
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,400
you must make sure you stay safe.

106
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,010
Can you promise me that?

107
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:27,650
I'll try.

108
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,480
Are you

109
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,630
doing those dangerous things

110
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,890
for money?

111
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,520
How did you find out about this?

112
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,980
Was it Wan Qing?

113
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,270
Did she ask you to talk me out of it?

114
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,590
So you're quite loyal.

115
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,010
Mom said

116
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,230
that she'll sell the house

117
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,770
and leave me some money.

118
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,600
So

119
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,100
would that be enough?

120
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,010
Listen.

121
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,080
It's not about the money.

122
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,090
It's so late. You came all this way

123
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,220
to ask me about this.

124
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,650
Aren't you tired?

125
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,850
Are you tired? I'll sleep with you.

126
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,280
No, no, no.

127
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,600
I mean,

128
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,910
you sleep, and I'll stay by your side.

129
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,040
Stay with me?

130
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,080
Then hang on. Let me take a shower.

131
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,170
What are you looking at?

132
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,960
I'm looking at your book.

133
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,120
Are you interested in it?

134
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,560
Not really.

135
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,350
In that Scramble

136
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,410
I accidentally got involved in,

137
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,130
was that bag the final prize?

138
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,570
Yes.

139
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,010
Who usually offers these prizes?

140
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,730
Whoever organizes it

141
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,130
provides the prize.

142
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,370
Organize?

143
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,840
Are you saying

144
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,050
that there's a huge organization

145
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,650
like the Association?

146
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,260
Is that usually how the games are played?

147
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,860
These casual games are rare.

148
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,060
They're held occasionally.

149
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,320
Only rich kids play these kinds of games.

150
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,820
What about the serious games then?

151
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,410
You've got some nerve asking that.

152
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,270
You don't have the guts to answer?

153
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,740
They are not anything good.

154
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,900
The less you know, the better.

155
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,600
Wan Qing was even willing
to humble herself,

156
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,680
asking me to persuade Jin Zhao
to give up

157
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,340
and not mess
with the Association's interests.

158
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,560
What exactly is

159
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,840
this so-called Association?

160
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,890
Is it some sort
of dangerous underground organization?

161
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,490
What on earth did Jin Zhao do?

162
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,960
I'm just there to make money.

163
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,920
Once I've earned enough, I'll leave.

164
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,780
It's not like I'm killing anyone.

165
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,330
What's the panic for?

166
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,440
Then...

167
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,100
Then how much longer are you
going to keep this up?

168
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,620
Not long.

169
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,310
It'll be over soon.

170
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,800
How soon is "soon"?

171
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,390
At most...

172
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:24,720
Two weeks.

173
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,200
Two weeks?

174
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:28,890
So after 2 weeks,

175
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,060
you won't do
such dangerous things anymore?

176
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,110
Yes.

177
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:42,650
I promise you.

178
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,490
Did you catch anything?

179
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,500
Here you are.

180
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:40,870
Take a break.

181
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,690
Looks like something's biting.

182
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,770
That's my float.

183
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,430
I know what to do.

184
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,440
I don't need you to teach me.

185
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,010
Fine.

186
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,400
The float really seems to be moving.

187
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,820
It's really moving! Look!

188
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,110
Get the net! Quickly!

189
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,870
Pull it over! Come on!

190
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,650
Don't lose it!

191
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,370
-Be careful.
-Pull it closer.

192
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,480
-Catch it!
-Got it!

193
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,470
Here it comes!

194
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,280
You asked me to lift the rod, didn't you?

195
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,580
And you asked me to get the net, right?

196
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,780
Remove it now.

197
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,980
You fished all day
and only caught this one?

198
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,740
Be quiet.

199
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,160
I've thought it over.

200
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:14,750
You were right.

201
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:17,920
I was too arrogant.

202
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:21,970
I'm planning to find a chance

203
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,180
to explain everything clearly to her.

204
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,110
Brandy.

205
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,390
You know my family's situation.

206
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,240
My dad,

207
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,940
for the sake of his pride

208
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,690
and his so-called masculinity,

209
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,040
never tells anyone in the family

210
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,900
about anything that's happened.

211
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,840
He says it's for our own good.

212
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,140
But growing up,

213
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,610
I've seen my mom

214
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,010
get worried sick
and scared too many times.

215
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,390
Do you really think that's good for us?

216
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,570
You're my bro.

217
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,340
Jiang Mu is my friend.

218
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,040
I don't want you to follow my dad's path.

219
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,240
I got it.

220
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,130
The float's really moving!
Why didn't you tell me? Hey!

221
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,190
Get the net! Hurry!

222
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,680
Probably just trash again.

223
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,440
Hurry!

224
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,610
Pull it over.

225
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,610
It's gone.

226
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:10,890
It got away.

227
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,920
So that was really a fish this time.

228
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,050
It's all your fault that I lost my fish.

229
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,610
Have a drink.

230
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,600
-Drink and then take it easy to fish.
-The rod.

231
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,490
You fish, and I'll net for you.

232
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,480
It's because you came
and scared all the fish away.

233
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,910
Did you catch a single one before I came?

234
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,670
Of course I did! You're joking.

235
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,390
[Speeding Auto House]

236
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,930
Jiang Mu!

237
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,540
Did you talk to him?

238
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,680
Yes, I did.

239
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,330
Did he agree?

240
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,440
Yes.

241
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,460
He said 2 weeks.

242
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,850
After 2 weeks,

243
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,370
he will stay away
from these dangerous things.

244
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,170
I believe him.

245
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,670
What's the use of your belief?

246
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,370
You know what?

247
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,630
He'll be in trouble before 2 weeks are up.

248
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,760
Brandy!

249
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,690
Brandy, we've got a problem!

250
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,240
What's wrong?

251
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,380
The car was smashed.

252
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,540
Where's Iron Cock?

253
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,210
He said his father was gravely ill

254
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,610
and left
after a quick update this morning.

255
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,420
I took an outside order this morning.
Then I saw

256
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,520
the shop wasn't busy, so I went there.

257
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,530
But when I arrived, I didn't see anyone.

258
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,900
Master, I'm sorry.

259
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,930
It was my fault for being negligent.

260
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,100
It must be that old bastard
from Wan's who did it.

261
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,100
So despicable.

262
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,280
Sanlai, stop talking nonsense.

263
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,840
Which eye of yours saw it?

264
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,200
I-I really don't know anything about this.

265
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,920
Get lost.

266
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,340
Jin Zhao.

267
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,050
Let me explain.

268
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,170
I came here today to warn you.

269
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,570
I would never mean to harm you.

270
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,570
I said, get lost!

271
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,150
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

272
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,250
Fine, Jin Zhao.

273
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:14,940
Listen.

274
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,950
Whether you live or die,

275
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,360
I won't care anymore.

276
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,020
Sanlai,

277
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,930
escort Mu home.

278
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,400
Okay.

279
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,150
Let's go.

280
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,900
Check the things.

281
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,550
Okay, Master.

282
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,930
Do you remember when you were little,

283
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,880
you failed your exam

284
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,630
and were too scared
to ask your mom to sign it?

285
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,050
After I signed it for you,

286
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,320
the teacher found out
and called for a parent meeting.

287
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,090
You cried your eyes out

288
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,600
like it was the end of the world.

289
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,650
I told you,

290
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,540
"It's not a big deal.

291
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,300
I can handle it."

292
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:42,730
Remember that?

293
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,130
Do you trust me?

294
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,390
Yes, I do.

295
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,020
Then go back to Jin Qiang's place,

296
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,050
sleep well,

297
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,410
and rest properly.

298
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,090
Don't think about this mess.

299
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:00,960
Cheer up,

300
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,330
okay?

301
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,420
He Zhang!

302
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,040
Madam.

303
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,330
Coming.

304
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,810
Here.

305
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,390
How about 2 more of these?

306
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,090
Okay.

307
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,250
All right.

308
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,070
This one.

309
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:21,810
Are these okay?

310
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,090
T-That guy.

311
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,760
That guy has been to the garage before,
right?

312
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,370
I don't know him.

313
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:50,240
You don't?

314
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,890
I think I've seen him
at the garage before.

315
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,890
Don't you remember?

316
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,170
Do you know how many people come

317
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,000
to the garage for car repair every day?

318
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,200
I'm swamped.

319
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,520
How can I remember everyone's face?

320
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,280
But later, when we ran

321
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,810
into this man at the market,

322
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,270
Jin Zhao said
he had no impression of him at all.

323
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,490
These will do.

324
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:11,850
Yeah.

325
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:12,850
See you next time.

326
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:13,570
Bye-bye.

327
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,110
Young lady.

328
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,390
Are you looking for me?

329
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:51,240
No, I'm not.

330
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,680
If you're not looking for me,
why do you keep following me?

331
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:57,410
I... I...

332
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,350
I'm looking for my classmate.

333
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,240
Pan Kai!

334
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,850
Pan Kai, over here!

335
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,440
Mu, what brings you here?

336
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,760
What a coincidence!
Do you live around here?

337
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,330
Yes, my dad's factory is just over there.

338
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,990
I'm buying some fruit for him.

339
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,140
That's nice.

340
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,330
What are you doing here?

341
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,650
I'm here to find someone.

342
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,450
Find someone?

343
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,270
Do I know them?

344
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,660
I don't even know them myself.

345
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,040
What fruit are you buying?

346
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,060
I bought a mango.

347
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:28,850
Pick some for me, too.

348
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:29,960
-I also like mango.
-Okay!

349
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,160
I'll buy some for you.

350
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,980
Is this enough?

351
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,130
That girl has been tailing me.

352
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,020
She must know something.

353
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:52,070
Handle it by yourself.

354
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:55,600
Remember,

355
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,760
your biggest rival in the mountain race is

356
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,410
He Zhang from Wan's.

357
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,510
Here you are.

358
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,330
You need to defeat him

359
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,890
and stay safe, too.

360
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,050
Okay.

361
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:07,650
Just as I thought.

362
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,140
What do you mean by that?

363
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,090
That person

364
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,110
told you he saw me?

365
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,630
You know way too much.

366
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,380
You're not going to kill me
to silence me, are you?

367
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,570
What do you think we do?

368
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,800
Since you've already heard about me
from Wan Qing,

369
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,530
you should know my situation.

370
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:48,610
When I had worked for Wan Shengbang

371
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,140
for about 2 and a half years,

372
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:51,650
they occasionally

373
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,780
had me do some jobs outside the garage.

374
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,960
There was one time
when his driver had an accident.

375
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,360
The deposit was paid,
but no one would race.

376
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,480
So he turned to me.

377
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,930
He wanted me to leave the garage

378
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,500
and do this job for him.

379
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,360
But I refused.

380
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,830
Later, Jin Xin needed money for surgery.

381
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,440
I wanted to help them,

382
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,850
so I borrowed money from Sanlai.

383
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,410
I bought a car,

384
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,370
modified it overnight,

385
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,220
and sold it at a high price.

386
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,610
Later, that car had an accident.

387
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,170
I always thought it was because

388
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,700
of my technical oversight.

389
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,110
I felt very guilty for those 2 years.

390
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,560
I worked desperately to earn money

391
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,700
to compensate that family.

392
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,170
But later,

393
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,950
I realized it wasn't my fault.

394
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:06,040
Wan Dayong tampered with that car.

395
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,480
I was set up.

396
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,410
After that, I left Wan's.

397
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,020
That's when Officer Lu approached me.

398
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,700
Officer Lu is
from the Anti-smuggling Bureau.

399
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,560
They were working on a major case.

400
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:25,120
At first,
they just wanted some leads from me.

401
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,440
Until later, when I approached him.

402
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,080
That was after your arrival.

403
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,240
What they're investigating isn't

404
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,440
Wan Shengbang at all,

405
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,440
nor is it any street racing organization.

406
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,240
Through illegal street racing,

407
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,500
they're trying to track down

408
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,910
the smuggling gang behind it.

409
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,720
But this Association is very cautious.

410
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,370
Having someone infiltrate it
out of nowhere is

411
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,500
simply impossible.

412
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,890
Your points in the Association
must reach the top ranks

413
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,290
for you to get noticed
by those higher-ups.

414
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,080
Brandy!

415
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,280
I've told you

416
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:05,640
that we don't allow outsiders here.

417
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,770
Anti-smuggling Bureau officers
found it hard to infiltrate

418
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:11,850
until I came along.

419
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,330
I told Officer Lu

420
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,370
that I could keep racing and competing

421
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,810
to earn points

422
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,400
and get into the alliance

423
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
to gather the information he needs.

424
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,000
I'm ranked in the top 10 in points.

425
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,170
If someone had to do this job,

426
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,720
I'd be the best choice.

427
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,800
Because you had racing experience before,

428
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,590
those in the Association
wouldn't suspect you.

429
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,250
Quite smart.

430
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,370
However,

431
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,480
that was only part of the reason.

432
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,890
I had an opportunity
that was beyond suspicion.

433
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:04,530
They thought I was getting involved

434
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:07,330
due to my grudge against Wan Shengbang.

435
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,489
I had fallen out with him

436
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:11,440
and gone against him.

437
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,290
I heard

438
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,690
that you're planning to interfere
with the business in Xikouguan.

439
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,350
Quite ambitious, aren't you?

440
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,650
Whether I interfere
or not isn't up to you.

441
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:20,980
It's not up to me either.

442
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,409
We'll see who has what it takes.

443
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:23,639
You're really something,

444
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,929
climbing the ranks ahead of others

445
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:25,770
and getting so much attention

446
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,330
in such a short time.

447
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,860
Aren't you obviously

448
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,610
going against Mr. Wan?

449
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:31,730
Listen!

450
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,040
Don't be naive.

451
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,010
It's not too late to back off now.

452
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,560
Although this is just one factor.

453
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,230
What about the others?

454
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,900
Officer Lu promised me...

455
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,150
As long as we solve this case,

456
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,170
he will make sure Wan Shengbang

457
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,590
and his accomplices are
brought to justice.

458
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,120
Once they're under arrest,

459
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,670
I can successfully clear my name.

460
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,970
The street racing organization is

461
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,290
actually just a front.

462
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,560
They use street racing

463
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,150
to observe

464
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:19,090
and groom people
who can take over their business.

465
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,000
Not everyone has the capability

466
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,480
and mental fortitude to handle this job.

467
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,770
Only those top scorers in the alliance

468
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:28,700
can get noticed.

469
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,540
It's because these people

470
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,620
all share some common traits.

471
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,600
They're brave,

472
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:36,770
reckless,

473
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,900
and need money.

474
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,140
600 HP!

475
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,080
650 HP!

476
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,380
It looks like RX7 has gone past 700 HP.

477
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:50,120
Brandy, you're going hard tonight.

478
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,050
You've already qualified.
No need to risk your life.

479
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,560
So they damaged your car

480
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,530
because they didn't want you
to join the race?

481
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,420
Wan Shengbang knows

482
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,480
that if our dispute
comes out into the open,

483
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:11,090
the alliance won't stand by
and do nothing.

484
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,150
There's only one solution

485
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,120
that can settle this matter.

486
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,370
What solution?

487
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,130
According to custom,

488
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,460
if both parties can't reconcile privately,

489
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,600
they shall resort
to the most traditional solution,

490
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,130
settling it with a car race.

491
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:31,810
The losing side

492
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:35,380
must not cause trouble
for the other anymore.

493
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,490
This is the rule.

494
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,370
Can your car be fixed then?

495
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,900
It can be fixed.

496
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,470
But I need some parts.

497
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,470
More importantly,

498
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,520
I need to find a reliable repair shop

499
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,260
willing to take on this job.

500
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,950
I want to clear my name.

501
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,420
Especially since you came,

502
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,250
I've wanted it even more.

503
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,000
I want to prove myself,

504
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,380
to prove that at least,

505
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,130
I'm still worthy of you.

506
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,810
Actually, on my way here,

507
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,210
I was thinking about
how to smooth over this issue

508
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,540
to put your mind at ease.

509
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,770
But when I was almost here,
I realized something.

510
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,600
If I told a lie for now

511
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,330
to cover up this problem,

512
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:43,910
then in the future,

513
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,640
I would have to come up
with all kinds of excuses

514
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,770
to maintain that lie

515
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,370
and keep you worrying.

516
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,520
Instead of doing that,

517
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,950
I might as well come clean to you.

518
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,590
Mu,

519
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,820
I've explained everything

520
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,140
that I can explain.

521
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:17,030
Go back to hit the sack,

522
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:18,630
okay?

523
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,560
This thing sounds super dangerous.

524
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,500
Do you really have to do it?

525
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,590
I can't let them keep doing evil anymore.

526
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,520
This is something

527
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,370
only I can handle.

528
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,420
Even if

529
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,540
it means sacrificing myself.
