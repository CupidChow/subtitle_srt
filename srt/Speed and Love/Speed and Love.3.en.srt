[Episode 3]

3
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,530
Do you remember what a navigator is?

4
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,810
As a racer,

5
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,440
you need to be aware of
your car's condition and road conditions

6
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,370
at all times.

7
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,590
This is the radiator.

8
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,910
This is the oil dipstick.

9
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,710
What do you hear?

10
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,090
Bubbling sounds.

11
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,060
Bubbles?

12
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,350
Mu,

13
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,020
sit in the passenger seat.

14
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,590
Be my navigator.

15
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,880
Left!

16
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,630
Forward! Go!

17
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,880
I remember.

18
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,470
I need your help now.

19
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,790
The password is 1120.

20
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,440
Open the digital app.

21
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,030
Find the pinned
group location information.

22
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,290
Tell me the direction.

23
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,890
They crashed behind us.

24
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,070
What should we do?

25
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,880
Which way?

26
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,560
They crashed behind us!

27
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,840
Tell me the route.

28
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,160
Be careful.
About 800 meters ahead there's...

29
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,560
I don't know what that is.

30
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,190
There are three possible roads nearby.

31
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,560
The distances are similar.
The road conditions...

32
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,360
I can't see the road conditions.

33
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,030
Choose one.

34
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,750
When we reach the east side,

35
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,150
make a sharp 90-degree turn
into the second curve.

36
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,410
I'll follow your lead.

37
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,930
There's a fork ahead. Turn right.

38
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,110
Brandy?

39
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,620
Didn't he say he wasn't coming today?

40
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,170
Listen to me now.

41
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,440
After this curve,

42
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,070
I'll count down from five.

43
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,440
Then you grab the steering wheel.

44
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,190
How?

45
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,320

46
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,480

Didn't you say you weren't coming today?

00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:53,770
I didn't plan to come,

76
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,190
but Wan Shengbang's little minions

77

came at me like rabid dogs

78
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,610

that we don't allow outsiders here.

Yes.

89
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,070
She recently suspected
I'm seeing someone else

90
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,030
because I disappear every night.

91
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,200
If I didn't bring her along,

92
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,400
she would've broken up with me tonight.

93
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,140
Are you still mad at me?

94
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,910
I can't believe it.

95
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,120
Brandy, you're completely wrapped around

96

00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,150
Live on the edge?

190
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,550
Then how do you think I should live?

191
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,390
I don't know.

192
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,960
But not like this.

193
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,970
At the very least...

194
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,050
At the very least,
it should be stable and secure.

195
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,750
Since you don't know,

196
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,790
let me tell you.

197
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,030
When Jin Qiang and I first came here,

198
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,150
we had nowhere to live.

199
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,350
We rented a basement.

200
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,990
No windows, no light.

201
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,720
Day was just like night.

202
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,880
Every time it rained,

203
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,630
it would flood up to our legs.

204
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,790
Homework, backpacks, mattresses...

205
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,670
They'd all be submerged.

206
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,070
Even the dead rats
would float in the water!

207
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,170
We had to put tables together to sleep on.

208
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,150
Then the next day,

209
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,480
we'd scoop the water out bucket by bucket.

210
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,240
Later, someone referred Jin Qiang

211
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,640
to do some earthwork job.

212
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,320
It required a referral fee.

213
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,050
Jin Qiang gave all his money
to that person.

214
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,790
That person's phone number
immediately became disconnected.

215
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,390
We couldn't even afford
the basement anymore.

216
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,160
I had to sleep on the streets,

217
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,880
on pedestrian bridges,
in underground passages,

218
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,010
and you tell me money isn't important?

219
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,280
Later...

220
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,920
He finally found a reliable job.

221
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,640
He worked as a chef in a restaurant.

222
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,090
That's where he met Zhao Meijuan.

223
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,780
It was Zhao Meijuan's first marriage

224
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,480
and Jin Qiang's second.

225
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,280
He had no money

226
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,660
and was raising me.

227
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,280
The two of them scraped together
enough money

228
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,480
to open a restaurant.

229
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,200
They worked from dawn till dusk,

230
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,700
but their earnings
barely covered the rent.

231
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,650
Whenever school asked for tuition fees,

232
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,330
I could only stand at their door

233
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,790
with the payment slip in my hand.

234
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,360
It was just two or three hundred bucks,

235
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,980
but I couldn't bring myself to ask.

236
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,050
Do you think money isn't important?

237
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,950
Jin Xin needs surgery.

238
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,700
It's congenital heart disease.

239
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,470
Besides the surgery costs,

240
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,990
there are also expensive treatment fees.

241
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,520
Jin Qiang is already broke.

242
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,150
This is just
adding insult to the injury for him.

243
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,430
For money, he even...

244
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,280
What do you think I should do?

245
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,750
Stand by and watch him suffer?

246
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,390
Jin Qiang never gave up on me,

247
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,250
even in the most difficult times.

248
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,770
Should I turn my back

249
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,490
on your dad?

250
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,190
Does Mom...

251
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,520
know about all this?

252
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,850
What difference does it make if she knows?

253
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,340
What difference does it make
if she doesn't?

254
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,220
They're divorced.

255
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,600
Even so,

256
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,970
you shouldn't be

257
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,630
doing such dangerous things.

258
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,910
If it makes money, it's worth doing.

259
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,100
What's wrong with living on the edge?

260
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,190
If I'm dead,

261
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,440
why does it matter if I'm on the edge?

262
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,240
Jin Zhao,

263
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,590
why won't you take the right path,

264
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,210
instead of going down this dark alleyway?

265
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,090
Let go.

266
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,150
No.

267
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,280
Do you think

268
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,540
no one in this world
can keep you in check?

269
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,720
You want to keep me in check?

270
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,950
By what right?

271
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,140
Are you still a Jin?

272
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,880
You've even changed your surname.

273
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,360
If you've forgotten your surname,

274
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,620
then let me remind you.

275
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,880
Jiang...

276
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,000
Mu.

277
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,910
So...

278
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,040
This is why you won't come back

279
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,760
to see us, right?

280
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,430
You blame Mom.

281
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,090
You blame her
for leaving Dad with nothing.

282
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,470
You hate her,

283
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,360
don't you?

284
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,430
Okay.

285
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,660
Zhao Meijuan called me.

286
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,710
Go back.

287
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,880
I won't.

288
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,350
What will it take for you to go back?

289
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,480
Promise me first.

290
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,470
Promise you what?

291
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,150
Promise me you'll find a real job

292
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,210
and stop this crap.

293
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,180
Otherwise,

294
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,250
neither of us will go back tonight.

295
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,320
You...

296
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,560
Brother.

297
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,370
Let's go home.

298
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:00,910
What did you say?

299
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,690
I'll take you home.

300
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,910
What home?

301
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,910
I don't have a home.

302
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,430
You do.

303
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,190
The old house in Nanjing

304
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,710
that we used to live in.

305
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,980
You're not going to Canada anymore?

306
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,840
Nope.

307
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,210
I've made up my mind.

308
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,800
I'm going to take you back to China,

309
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,710
to Nanjing.

310
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,970
From now on, we'll live together

311
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,250
in that old house,

312
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,360
never to be separated again, okay?

313
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,080
I can make money.

314
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,470
I'm capable.

315
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,730
I can give you a stable life.

316
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,150
When we go back,

317
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,990
you can continue your studies

318
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:55,950
and your writing.

319
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,800
I won't let you fight anymore,

320
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,960
and I won't let you be in pain.

321
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:00,940
From now on,

322
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,320
I'll protect you.

323
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,600
Trust me.

324
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,030
I can definitely do it.

325
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,170
Brother,

326
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,110
let's go back.

327
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,150
I can't go back.

328
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,990
You can't control him.

329
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,320
Yes,

330
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,320
you couldn't beat him in the ring.

331
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,110
I accept that,

332
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,960
and I'll put up with it.

333
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,250
But how can your driving skills
be worse than his too?

334
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,550
There won't be a next time.

335
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,240
There won't be a next time!

336
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,800
There won't be a next time!

337
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:26,970
Get lost!

338
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,360
Thank you.

339
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,560
Jin Qiang called.

340
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,660
He said your mom arrived in Manshi.

341
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:38,970
Let me take you there.

342
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,910
Okay.

343
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,150
Do you...

344
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,800
want to say hello?

345
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:40,560
No.

346
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:45,670
Go ahead.

347
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,190
Mu,

348
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,670
actually, your Uncle Chris

349
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,040
cares about you very much.

350
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,770
He's already arranged
a school for you in Canada.

351
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,230
You can continue your studies

352
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,600
and further education there.

353
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
I won't go.

354
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,290
If not Canada, then where will you go?

355
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,490
I've already decided.

356
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,650
After graduating, I'll stay in China.

357
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,050
I won't go anywhere else.

358
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,230
This time, come back with me.

359
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,160
Put everything aside for now

360
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,890
and pass the IELTS exam, okay?

361
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,300
I won't pass it.
I don't want to go abroad.

362
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:27,760
I've said that I'll stay

363
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,910
in that old house in Nanjing.

364
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,710
I don't want to go anywhere else.

365
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,760
I'm planning on selling

366
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,430
the house in Nanjing.

367
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,430
Why would you sell a perfectly fine house?

368
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,630
I've already married your Uncle Chris.

369
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,910
He has many properties
and businesses there.

370
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,340
I've decided to settle down with him
in Canada.

371
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,470
That's also where I plan on retiring to.

372
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,710
So, why would I keep

373
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,910
a house in China?

374
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,080
It's useless.

375
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,190
How is it useless?

376
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,440
Why do you trust him so much?

377
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,360
Aren't you afraid that one day he might—

378
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:53,900
Mu!

379
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,150
Well...

380
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,130
I'll go check on things.

381
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,390
Mom,

382
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,040
how can you sell the house?

383
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:19,910
Have you thought about

384
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,430
if things don't work out
between you two in the future?

385
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,430
Where will you live when you come back?

386
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,710
Whether I sell the house or not,

387
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,040
I'll never abandon you.

388
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,910
No matter if you settle abroad

389
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,190
or live in China,

390
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,800
I'll set aside
a large sum of money for you.

391
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,230
This isn't something
for you to worry about,

392
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,880
okay?

393
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,290
Do you think I'm worried about money?

394
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,230
I'm worried about you being deceived.

395
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:38,950
Enough.

396
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:40,810
I don't want you

397
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,390
to say such things again.

398
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,800
This topic ends here.

399
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,520
Is that Jin Zhao?

400
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,190
Didn't he leave?

401
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,730
Why did he come back?

402
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,760
Could it be...

403
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,280
He wanted to see...

404
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,280
Mom?

405
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,390
How does he know we're staying here?

406
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,670
He drove me here.

407
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,310
What?

408
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,280
He brought you here?

409
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,430
Your father promised me

410
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,430
that when you came this time,

411
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,690
you two wouldn't meet!

412
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,630
Why?

413
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,410
Why can't we see each other?

414
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,190
Mu, you're grown up now.

415
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:46,560
Shouldn't you keep some distance

416
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,820
from the opposite sex?

417
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,720
You'd better not see each other too often.

418
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,750
Mom, what are you talking about?

419
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,080
He's Jin Zhao.

420
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,390
I've told you repeatedly

421
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,990
about Jin Zhao's situation.

422
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,880
You are not related by blood.

423
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,590
You're not siblings.

424
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,880
He's not your brother.

425
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,430
I've made myself perfectly clear already.

426
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,690
Don't you understand?

427
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:06,760
Besides,

428
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,610
he's not even a good person now.

429
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,120
You can't talk about him like that.

430
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,320
Even if we're not related by blood,

431
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,580
he's still my brother.

432
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:18,630
Back then, your father insisted on
bringing him home.

433
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,950
I was against it,

434
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,360
but your father was stubborn

435
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,600
and insisted.

436
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:23,950
I already said

437
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:26,040
this child
would be difficult to discipline.

438
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,630
Bold as brass,

439
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,040
he's bound to get into trouble someday.

440
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:33,310
Back then,

441
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,230
he called our home repeatedly.

442
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,960
I had warned him already.

443
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,600
I didn't want you two associating.

444
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,300
How could you understand?

445
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,320
If you understood,

446
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,710
you wouldn't have stayed away

447
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,970
for so many years without seeing me once.

448
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,320
What did you say?

449
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,360
He'd called me?

450
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,850
What did you warn him about?

451
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,440
What could I warn him about?

452
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,910
I told him to be sensible,
follow the rules,

453
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,240
and stop pestering you.

454
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,470
After you started middle school,
you weren't little anymore.

455
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,230
Shouldn't he keep his distance?

456
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,840
You think it's still like
when you were children,

457
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,770
talking about sibling affection?

458
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,470
So...

459
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:23,640
This is the real reason
you didn't come back to see us,

460
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,040
right?

461
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,040
Master.

462
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,060
I'm not in the mood
to play with you right now.

463
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,970
We didn't finish our fight yesterday.

464
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,080
I said,

465
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,500
I'm not in the mood
to play with you right now.

466
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,210
I'm the one beaten up.

467
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,170
Why are you crying?

468
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,110
I've told you repeatedly

469
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,710
about Jin Zhao's situation.

470
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,590
You are not related by blood.

471
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,310
You're not siblings.

472
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,639
He's not your brother.

473
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,380
What's wrong with living on the edge?

474
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,360
If I'm dead,

475
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,030
why does it matter if I'm on the edge?

476
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,960
You want to keep me in check?

477
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,110
By what right?

478
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,720
You've even changed your surname.

479
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,080
If you've forgotten your surname,

480
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,080
let me remind you.

481
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,390
Jiang...

482
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,590
Mu.

483
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,720
Our flight is this afternoon.

484
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,980
I hope to see you there.

485
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,420
I hope you'll think it through

486
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,440
and stop being so stubborn.

487
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,430
Brother,

488
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,280
you haven't called for so long.

489
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,800
I don't know how to find you,

490
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,990
so I can only try writing to you.

491
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,510
I hope you receive it.

492
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:26,690
Brother,

493
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,550
are you in high school now?

494
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,520

Did you get into a key high school?

498
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,940

499

I feel like I'm writing to thin air.
