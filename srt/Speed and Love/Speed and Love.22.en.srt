[Episode 22]

3
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,540
The phoenix trees in Nanjing
have a long history

4
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,750
and many stories.

5
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,840
The most accurate account

6
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,350
is that they were planted

7
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,980
for the enshrinement ceremony

8
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,100
of Sun Yat-sen.

9
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,070
But do you know

10
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,980
why they chose phoenix trees?

11
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,610
Why?

12
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,190
Back then, when they were

13
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,440
choosing green plants,

14
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,300
the city planners preferred them

15
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,540
for their shape and shade,

16
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,140
so they planted them

17
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,500
along the main streets.

18
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,440
You know quite a lot about this.

19
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,820
In autumn,

20
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,380
the golden canopy of phoenix trees

21
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,960
stretches across the city
from east to west,

22
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,680
which is very romantic.

23
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:47,650
Let's go.

24
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,590
Have you settled in?

25
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,290
I rented a place close to the observatory.

26
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,020
The environment is nice

27
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,860
and it's convenient for work.

28
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,990
That's pretty good.

29
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,990
Nanjing is a magical city.

30
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,600
It has a rich history

31
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,660
and a strong sense of everyday life,

32
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,100
always giving a feeling of stability.

33
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,410
By the way,

34
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,790
what kind of coffee do you like?

35
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,100
Vanilla latte with a hint of cinnamon.

36
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,870
What does...

37
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,090
that taste like?

38
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,850
I don't really remember.

39
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,820
What you want to remember

40
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,100
isn't the taste of the coffee,

41
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,700
but the person

42
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,350
you shared it with, right?

43
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,540
What is the guy

44
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,170
who gave you the pen doing now?

45
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,070
I don't know.

46
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,430
Alright.

47
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,510
After we go back to Nanjing,

48
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,700
if you want to run a garage,

49
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,780
I'll do it with you.

50
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,380
If not,

51
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,830
we can open a coffee shop together.

52
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,230
Why a coffee shop?

53
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,630
I just feel it would be nice for us

54
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,360
to open a coffee shop together.

55
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,560
We must choose a location at the foot
of a mountain with phoenix trees.

56
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,800
In autumn,

57
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,080
the golden leaves of phoenix trees
would cover the ground,

58
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,950
and Lightning would run back and forth
over them.

59
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,280
How happy that would be.

60
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,340
Actually, my dream

61
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,350
is to open a small coffee shop
like this one.

62
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,050
I've already thought of a name.

63
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,450
It will be called "Moon."

64
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,870
It has to be on a street

65
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,370
lined with phoenix trees.

66
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,110
In autumn,

67
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,270
when the osmanthus flowers
bloom in Nanjing,

68
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,130
the warm breeze
carries its fragrance everywhere.

69
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,520
People stroll along the long streets

70
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,910
and grab a cup of their favorite coffee.

71
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,070
How delightful.

72
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,510
Sounds nice.

73
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,790
But considering how expensive
storefront rent is in Nanjing,

74
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,680
you'll need to save up quite a bit.

75
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,340
During the years I studied in Canada,

76
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,540
I tutored on weekends

77
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,990
and school breaks.
I've already saved enough.

78
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,220
So does that mean your coffee shop dream

79
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,420
can be realized soon?

80
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,220
Not yet.

81
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,920
Before that,

82
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,060
there's something else I need to do.

83
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,560
Ms. Jiang, I'll be there in 5 minutes.

84
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,580
I'll explain the details

85
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,240
of the old house when I arrive.

86
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,340
Enjoy.

87
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,460
Thank you, sir.

88
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,510
Ms. Jiang,

89
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,510
seriously,
don't make this difficult for me.

90
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,780
That house you're interested in

91
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,870
was sold last year.

92
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,950
I'm really sincere about this.

93
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,070
Could you ask the buyer

94
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,460
if they'd consider reselling it?

95
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,340
I can

96
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,750
offer up to

97
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,140
a 30 percent premium.

98
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,950
My colleagues and I have asked around.

99
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,750
The buyer

100
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,480
is a big businessman from Beijing.

101
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,360
He confirmed the deal

102
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,380
and paid in full the same day.

103
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,920
Do you really think
he'd care about that amount of money?

104
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,420
Please, help me ask again.

105
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,930
If that doesn't work,

106
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,320
arrange a meeting with that buyer.

107
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,250
I'll try to persuade him in person.

108
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:45,950
Alright.

109
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,710
I'll ask again for you.

110
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,320
Good.

111
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,460
Thank you.

112
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:50,810
I'll be going now.

113
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,150
Sit.

114
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,310
Good boy.

115
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,380
-You did a great job today.
-Sit.

116
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,150
Let's go.

117
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,550
If Lightning hadn't gone missing,

118
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,870
it would be this big by now.

119
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,430
[Six years ago]

120
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:28,990
Thanks.

121
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,230
When are you leaving?

122
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,120
The 8th.

123
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,020
By the way, Sanlai,

124
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,240
I've asked.

125
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,960
Lightning's vaccines have expired,

126
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,680
so it probably won't be able
to enter the country with me.

127
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,090
Could you help

128
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,540
have it vaccinated next month

129
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,660
and send it over?

130
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,640
I'll order a pet carrier for it.

131
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,590
Jiang Mu,

132
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,900
I might have some bad news.

133
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,270
What's wrong?

134
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,140
Lightning is missing.

135
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,460
Missing?

136
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,950
How is that possible?

137
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,710
Didn't I tell you before

138
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,910
that Lightning needed to be neutered?

139
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,950
When a dog goes into heat,

140
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,070
it just runs off.

141
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,310
Last night I thought

142
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,070
it'd just run around and come back,

143
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,400
but when I went looking for it,
it was gone.

144
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,800
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,430
I didn't take good care of Lightning.

146
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,430
But don't worry.

147
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,000
I know how this works.

148
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,320
It was probably

149
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,820
lured away
by some little female dog nearby.

150
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,550
It might even come back

151
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,790
with a girlfriend.

152
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
And if it doesn't,

153
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,660
I'll have Xishi give birth
to a better-looking one

154
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,750
and send it to you, okay?

155
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,420
No!

156
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,150
I only want Lightning!

157
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,550
How could it get lost?

158
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,790
I've had it for so long

159
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,150
that I'm attached to it.

160
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,850
I only want Lightning.

161
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,490
We can find it, right?

162
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,380
Why did this have to happen now?

163
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,240
Even Lightning...

164
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,660
is abandoning me?

165
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,000
Don't think like that.

166
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,740
Don't be sad.

167
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,360
It's just a little dog.

168
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,100
Lightning means

169
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,150
more than just a dog to me.

170
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,370
I see.

171
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,680
I'll definitely find Lightning
and bring it back.

Brandy doesn't want you anymore

175
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,280
and you're unhappy abroad,

176
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,880
then come back.

00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,750
I'll take you in.

178

I checked with them 3 times a day

for a whole week.

189
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,340

But they said he's extremely busy

192
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:12,970
and travels a lot.

193
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,100
And he's only in Nanjing

194
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,550
one day a month.

195
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,950
Then let's do it that day.

196
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:17,540
Alright.

197
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,990
I'll let you know

198
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,470
as soon as it's confirmed.

199
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:21,670
Thank you.

200
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,320
Is it...

201
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,530
your dog?

202
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,980
No, it belongs to our coffee shop.

203
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,000
When our boss isn't around,

204
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:52,980
we staff members

205
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,390
take turns walking it.

206
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,110
It's usually pretty quiet,

207
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,590
but today it's so clingy.

208
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,910
Really different from usual.

209
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,640
Seems like it really likes you.

210
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,510
It...

211
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,670
looks a lot like a dog I used to have.

212
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,920
What a coincidence!

213
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,220
I should get going now.

214
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,230
Jiang Mu,

215
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
how have you been?

216
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,180
Pretty good.

217
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,740
I've settled in here.

218
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,120
That's good to hear.

219
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,710
I've been assigned to Beijing

220
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,020
on a long business trip

221
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,540
and probably won't be back anytime soon.

222
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,600
Take care of yourself then.

223
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,790
Thanks.

224
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,050
Actually, I called you

225
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,180
because there's something else
I wanted to tell you.

226
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,190
What is it?

227
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,620
On the day I left,

228
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,660
something interesting happened.

229
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,980
I was taking a taxi to the airport

230
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,890
and passed through
a phoenix tree-lined boulevard.

231
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:54,890
Guess what I saw?

232
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,150
What?

233
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,580
I saw a coffee shop.

234
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,310
Its name

235
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,620
was actually "Moon."

236
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,840
Someone opened a coffee shop

237
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,750
called Moon
along the phoenix tree-lined boulevard

238
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,410
at the foot of Zijin Mountain.

239
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,100
That person couldn't be you, could it?

240
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,070
How could it be?

241
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,270
Did I ever tell you?

242
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,270
It's just my dream.

243
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,600
It hasn't come true yet.

244
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,720
What a coincidence.

245
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,420
Who could it be then?

246
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,470
They actually made your dream come true.

247
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,110
Where is that coffee shop?

248
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,870
I'll send you the address right now.

249
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,860
Strange.

250
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,610
How did I end up in a park?

251
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,070
What a coincidence. We meet again.

252
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:13,710
Yes.

253
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:14,850
Bye.

254
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,080
It belongs to our coffee shop.

255
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,430
It's usually pretty quiet,

256
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,980
but today it's so clingy.

257
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,340
Really different from usual.

258
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,070
Seems like it really likes you.

259
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,840
Lightning?

260
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,900
Lightning!

261
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,480
Lightning!

262
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,630
It really is you!

263
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,440
Where are you taking me?

264
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:04,680
Doggy?

265
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,100
We must choose a location at the foot
of a mountain with phoenix trees.

266
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,340
In autumn,

267
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,620
the golden leaves of phoenix trees
would cover the ground,

268
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,440
and Lightning would run back and forth
over them.

269
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,770
How happy that would be.

270
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,480
Moon?

271
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:36,600
Lightning.

272
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,960
Welcome to Moon. What would you like to...

273
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,700
Why is the dog back? Where's Jia?

274
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,000
Quiet, why are you back here on your own?

275
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,470
Quiet?

276
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,550
Did it lead you to the coffee shop?

277
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:55,080
I can't believe it has learned
how to bring in customers.

278
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,020
The menu is there.

279
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,950
Would you like to order something?

280
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,830
I order delivery from you all the time.

281
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,630
I didn't expect
the shop to be hidden here.

282
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,980
You can't even see the sign
from the entrance.

283
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,370
A lot of customers say that.

284
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:14,300
Our boss just doesn't want

285
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,430
to cut down the trees in the courtyard.

286
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,460
Your boss is really laid-back.

287
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:20,660
By the way,

288
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,320
I always order your vanilla latte.

289
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,070
Do you have any other recommendations?

290
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,320
[House Special]

291
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,150
Why don't you try our "Moon?"

292
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,540
It's our bestseller here.

293
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,870
Many customers love it.

294
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,650
Sure.

295
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,930
Alright,
please wait over there for a moment.

296
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:34,730
Okay, thanks.

297
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,610
Miss,
have you decided what you'd like to drink?

298
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,390
Miss?

299
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,480
This "Moon"

300
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,390
has a really unique design.

301
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,850
That was personally designed by our boss.

302
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,320
So would you like to try it?

303
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,630
I'll have one too.

304
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,370
Alright, please wait over there as well.

305
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,910
Here's your coffee.

306
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,430
This is for our customers to play with.

307
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,090
A child messed it up last time,

308
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,870
and we didn't know how to fix it.

309
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,610
You know how to use a telescope too?

310
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,230
If you want to use it during the day,

311
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,710
you can add a Baader filter.

312
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,880
You might be able to see sunspots.

313
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,540
Okay, thank you.

314
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,750
Here's your coffee.

315
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,330
It really is him.

316
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,380
He's back.

317
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,150
Do you need anything else?

318
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,190
Is Quiet your shop's dog?

319
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,260
No, it's our boss's.

320
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,220
He just keeps the dog at the shop

321
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,820
when he's on business trips.

322
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,490
A coffee shop owner
needs to go on business trips too?

323
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,840
The coffee shop is his side business;
he has a main job.

324
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,160
Actually,
the coffee shop is his main business,

325
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,390
and he has other side ventures.

326
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,360
Is there a difference between the two?

327
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,600
Of course.

328
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,120
Without side ventures,

329
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,920
this shop probably
would have gone under long ago.

330
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:37,890
Gone under?

331
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,460
Isn't your shop making money?

332
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,390
I heard our business
was really bad a couple of years ago,

333
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:45,150
but our boss kept the shop alive

334
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,190
through other ventures.

335
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,950
This year,
we've had more returning customers,

336
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,410
so business is doing well.

337
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,070
So where is he now?

338
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,040
On another business trip?

339
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,310
Today I think he went back to school

340
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,740
for his thesis proposal.

341
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,700
School?

342
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,460
Is he very young?

343
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,670
No.

344
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,480
Our boss is in his thirties.

345
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,780
He's just been continuing his studies
at university.

346
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,590
He's quite hardworking.

347
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,640
-Our boss is Superman.
-Our boss is Superman.

348
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,960
He's super busy every day.

349
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,220
And has a lot to handle.

350
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,110
What's his name?

351
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,100
His name is...

352
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,180
How about this?

353
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,350
You can...

354
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,020
talk to us first.

355
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,760
Could you give me his contact info?

356
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:27,070
I have something very important
to consult with him about.

357
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:27,910
Alright.

358
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,150
Then please...

359
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,280
register.

360
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,780
Register?

361
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,190
Just write your name, contact info,

362
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,860
and request in it.

363
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,120
Currently you should be...

364
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,040
20th in line.

365
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,110
20th?

366
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,400
What about the 19 people ahead of me?

367
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,500
They're just like you—

368
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,950
women with...

369
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,980
special requests for our boss.

370
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,430
I'm nothing like them.

371
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,950
We know.

372
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,380
Every girl who comes here

373
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,660
says the same thing.

374
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,810
Well, miss.

375
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,260
I'm really sorry.

376
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,670
I can't give you

377

our boss's contact info.

378
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,110
However, if you register,

379
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,500
I'll report it to him.

380
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,670
If he's interested,

381
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,500
I'm sure he'll reach out to you.

382
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,910
So please register first.

383
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:34,810
Done.

384
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,620
Alright. Thank you.

385
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,710
The owner of this coffee shop
is pretty handsome,

386
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,700
but he has a rather aloof personality,

387
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,900
giving off a complete "stay away" vibe.

388
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,680
He is indeed very handsome.

389
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,040
Is the owner single?

390
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,640
When chatting with the staff,

391
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,190
I heard he's married,

392
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,860
and his wife and children
are settled abroad.

393
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,520
He's married?

394
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,630
[Purple Mountain Observatory]

395
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,140
Alright, then let's go with this plan.

396
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,140
I'll talk to the director on Monday.

397
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,370
What are you planning to do this weekend?

398
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,150
I'm going shopping for some clothes

399
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,800
and maybe having afternoon tea.

400
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,530
Sounds good.

401
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,620
It's been a week. Why hasn't he replied?

402
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,320
You finally came.

403
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,070
You lost something, right?

404
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,280
A pen. Have you seen it?

405
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,740
Yes. It was originally in the pen holder.

406
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,040
I thought you'd come back
for it the next day.

407
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,410
I've been busy with work,

408
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:35,730
so I only came today.

409
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,980
Well, I have to tell you this.

410
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,380
I'm sorry
you came all this way for nothing.

411
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,970
Your pen was taken by our boss
a couple of days ago.

412
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,740
But if you're free

413
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,460
Sunday morning, you can come here

414
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,150

415
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,010
personally return it to you.

416
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,360
Thank you.

417
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,430

00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:12,860

549
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,530
I'll let you know the date in advance.

550
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:35,950

551
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,040
I need to go somewhere else later, so...

552
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,540
Give me your phone number.

553
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,160
Without contact info,

554
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,240
how am I supposed to tell you the date?

555
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:25,770
What's wrong?

556
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,740
