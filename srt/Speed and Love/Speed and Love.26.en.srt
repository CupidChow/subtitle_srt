00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,660
It's not far. Let's walk back.

125
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,800
But we don't have umbrellas.

126
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,760
I can't see the road like this.

127
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,650
I'm here. Stay close.

128
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,610
Don't get wet.

129
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,270
You're not abducting me, are you?

130
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,500
Who knows?

131
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,480
Look at you.

132
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:58,900
You're soaking wet.

133
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,360
Go take a shower quickly.
Don't catch a cold.

134
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,130
Okay. Wait for me in the living room.

135
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,810
You saw it?

136
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,330
How long did it take
for you to put it together?

137
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,680
Adding up both times,

138
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,350
quite a while.

139
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,720
Two times?

140
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,080
When it was being transported here,

141
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,370
it fell apart once.

142
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,080
When I moved it here and reassembled it,

143
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,810
I lost the instruction manual.

144
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,410
The second time was quite difficult.

145
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,590
What about the other time?

146
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,170
The first time...

147
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,500
That was when you had just gone to Canada.

148
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,590
I was confined to a wheelchair.

149
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,400
The pills I had to take

150
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,930
were more than my meals.

151
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,110
Besides enduring the pain daily,

152
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,200
I also had to endure

153
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,090
the days without you.

154
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,880
Back then, I

155
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,550
was not looking forward to tomorrow,

156
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,010
and had no idea where my future lay.

157
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:58,960
This Lego set

158
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,530
kept me company through
those long, difficult days.

159
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,080
It felt like

160
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,560
you were right there with me.

161
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,260
That was the first time
I desperately wanted to stand up.

162
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,290
And from that moment on,

163
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,700
I was filled with hope for the future.

164
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,480
I always thought

165
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,930
we would build these models together.

166
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,960
Back then, I believed

167
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,170
we had plenty of time

168
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,760
to build them slowly.

169
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,130
How about

170
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,600
we take it apart

171
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,890
and build it for a third time?

172
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,130
That's not what I meant.

173
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,720
I just feel a bit regretful.

174
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,410
Who's Thomas?

175
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,110

lots of guys are interested in me,

180

181
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,520
I do believe it.

182
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,660

I'm not a child anymore.

220
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,610
Why are you hiding?

221
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,579
Too shy to look at me?

222
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,750
No, I'm not.

223
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,230
Then look at me.

224
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,120
You're awake.

225
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,280
Did you sleep well?

226
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,350
When do you want to move in?

227
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,430
My lease isn't up until two months later.

228
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,270
I can't just waste that money.

229
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,070
Why did you transfer me money?

230
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,650
Consider it as
you've sublet it to me for two months.

231
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,710
Can you move in now?

232
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,540
Someone's here to help you move.

233
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,130
Boss,

234
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,910
do we get overtime pay for weekends?

235
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:54,520
Yes.

236
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,490
Isn't this...

237
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,710
Hello, I'm Wen Ke.

238
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,790
Just call me Wen.

239
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,130
Hello.

240
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,850
Are you his colleague?

241
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,610
I'm Mr. Jin's assistant and driver.

242
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,650
Mr. Jin, I'll wait for you downstairs.

243
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:15,860
Bye-bye.

244
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,890
So you planned this all along.

245
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,010
Wen.

246
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,700
Wait in the car for a while.

247
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,380
Come up
after we've packed her things.

248
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:48,900
Okay.

249
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,780
So you have a driver now?

250
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,460
Why does he call you Mr. Jin?

251
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,130
Didn't Da Jia and Xiao Jia say

252
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,130
you aren't working for any company?

253
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,630
What do you do on your business trips?

254
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,930
Why do you have so many questions?

255
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,780
Of course I need to ask.

256
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,690
I can't be with you without knowing

257
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,020
what your situation is.

258
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,820
Then why didn't you ask last night

259
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,750
before getting together
with me so carelessly?

260
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,330
In a situation like last night,

261
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,410
how could I ask?

262
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,920
This is my home.

263
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,700
Feel free to look around.

264
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,300
Where was I?

265
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,710
Last time my drain was broken.

266
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:40,060
I was going to call the landlord.

267
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,580
But my roommate is really nice.

268
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,740
He called his friend to come over.

269
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,860
That friend fixed it in no time.

270
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,930
And then that friend stayed overnight.

271
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,620
How did you know?

272
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:53,990
Just a guess.

273
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,030
Let's start moving. How should we do it?

274
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,830
I'll help you.

275
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,840
How do we move?

276
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,370
I don't know where to start.

277
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,170
I hate packing things up.

278
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,820
I'll do it from now on.

279
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,370
No way!

280
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,540
If you do everything,

281
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,000
won't I seem too high-maintenance?

282
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,300
What's wrong with being high-maintenance?

283
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,700
I'll indulge you anyway.

284
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,580
Really?

285
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,890
How long do you plan on indulging me?

286
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:23,780
A lifetime.

287
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,890
Do you always pack up by yourself?

288
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,380
What else?

289
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,420
What about Wen?
Has he been with you all along?

290
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,510
A few years ago, I went to work
at a factory in Beijing.

291
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,620
After making a name for myself,

292
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,060
I went
to the Automotive Engineering Institute

293
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,740
to work on technical engineering
innovations with them.

294
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,600
As for me,
I wanted to work on some small projects,

295
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,000
so I opened a coffee shop.

296
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,930
I've been a free agent,

297
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,740
while collaborating with them
as a consultant.

298
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,370
At minimum,
I have to go there twice a month.

299
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,740
At most, I go every week.

300
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,610
Considering my health condition,

301
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:17,340
a few years ago,

302
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,780
they assigned me an assistant,

303
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,820
who is Wen,

304
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,980
mainly responsible for handling
my business trips.

305
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,780
Are all the scarves packed?

306
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,580
Yes.

307
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,990
I found another one.

308
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,230
That's not a scarf.

309
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,370
It's my skirt.

310
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,060
Where are the sleeves?

311
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,460
It doesn't need sleeves.

312
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,110
It's a strapless dress.

313
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,740
You just put it on directly.

314
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,160
I can't picture it.

315
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,050
Try it on.

316
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,980
[Record of my Life]

317
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:33,650
Don't go.

318
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,970
We don't have a single photo together.

319
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,930
Why don't we take this opportunity?

320
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,300
Let me set a timer.

321
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:36,830
Let me ask you.

322
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,780
When do you

323
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,280
usually wear

324
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,010
this outfit?

325
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,550
When I meet handsome guys.

326
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,220
What makes someone handsome?

327
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,330
Do I qualify?

328
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,920
Wen is still waiting downstairs.

329
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:13,490
Wen,

330
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,140
it'll take us a little longer.

331
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,400
Go back to the coffee shop
and wait for me.

332
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,970
He might get the wrong idea.

333
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:22,600
He won't.

334
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,700
Why not?

335
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,950
Because in his eyes,

336
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,950
I'm a respectable person.

337
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:51,910
It should be this room.

338
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:58,820
Mr. Jin?

339
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,800
Mr. Jin?

340
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,760
Why is everyone here?

341
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,820
Seeing how you were taking so long,

342
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,370
I thought you had a lot of stuff to pack.

343
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,630
I even called Xiao Jia.

344
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,480
There are quite a few things.
We were just careful with our packing.

345
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,000
Here.

346
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,200
Thanks for your help.

347
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,430
Thank you.

348
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,900
And this one, too.

349
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:25,610
Here. Be careful.

350
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,740
I don't know how he manages to do it.

351
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,650
Lying so shamelessly

352
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,930
with a straight face.

353
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,720
Ms. Jiang, you're here.

354
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,420
Ms. Jiang?

355
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,650
It's Boss Lady.

356
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,270
Would you like some coffee?

357
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,490
It's fine. You can go about your business.

358
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,950
I just stopped by on my way.

359
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,380
I need to go home for dinner soon.

360
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:07,950
Okay.

361
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,850
Here's the account book.

362
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,110
All the operations details are in there.

363
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,290
Why are you giving this to me?

364
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,210
It's your own shop.

365
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,410
You should at least know how it's doing.

366
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,540
My shop?

367
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,740
Since when is it my shop?

368
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,170
Why else would I bother?

369
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,670
Do you think opening a coffee shop is fun?

370
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,990
When I first returned to Nanjing,

371
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,270
I started planning this coffee shop.

372
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,960
I participated
in designing the environment

373
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,760
and coming up with the shop name.

374
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,490
This place is nice.

375
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,740
Thank you for your recommendation.

376
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,870
I'm very satisfied.

377
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,830
We can sign the contract anytime.

378
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,770
Sure. Thanks.

379
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:57,960
I've already sent you

380
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,010
the font for the signature coffee logo.

381
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:00,940
Use the same font

382
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,290
for the signboard, too.

383
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,500
Moon.

384
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:06,700
Moon Coffee.

385
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,790
But I heard that for the first two years,

386
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:30,739
this place was losing money.

387
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,010
Different trades are worlds apart.

388
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,210
I made some mistakes.

389
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,820
Then why

390
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,750
did you keep pouring money into it?

391
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,210
Because

392
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,130
a young girl suggested it
to me many years ago.

393
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,409
I'm a very honest person—

394
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:53,659
almost stubborn.

395
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,840
I believe the more mistakes I make,

396
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,660
the more I will find the right path
eventually.

397
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,060
Even if one day it closes,

398
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,680
it shouldn't be because
of poor management.

399
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,380
You call yourself honest?

400
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,670
Then why did you corner me
against the wall back then?

401
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,780
When did I ever corner you?

402
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,620
At the garage.

403
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,280
You told me to leave

404
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:17,210
and said it looked bad
that I kept coming to see you.

405
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,490
You even asked

406
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,780
if I wanted something more with you.

407
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,620
I was just asking casually.

408
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,140
Just...

409
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:42,940
What?

410
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,540
Did I hit a nerve?

411
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,260
Sorry to disappoint you.

412
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,060
Okay, got it.

413
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,280
Mu.

414
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,940
I need to go on an urgent business trip.

415
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:22,270
Wen will take you home.

416
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,520
Be good and wait for me at home,

417
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,220
okay?
