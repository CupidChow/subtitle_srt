exoplanetary stellar systems.

102
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,200
By combining
high-precision spectroscopic observations

with celestial mechanics simulations,

104
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,950
we analyze the energy dissipation pathways

105
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,840
triggered by tidal torques

106
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,720
and quantify how interactions

107
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,360
with circumstellar disks
affect dissipation efficiency.

108
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,480
Our study reveals the coupled evolution
of orbital eccentricity

109
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,240
and tidal dissipation,

110
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,880
providing key theoretical support

111
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,120
for accurately predicting the long-term stability of astronomical systems.

112
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,270
Alright. Is everything clear to everyone?

00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,800

116
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,990

to text me?

117
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,510
I'll be back today.

I'm not in Nanjing.

120
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,000
To simplify the vehicle structure,

121
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,910

122
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,360
the rear-seat module in the new model.

123

125
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,600

will retain only 3 physical switches

126

No wonder Quiet knows you.

151
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,430
Of course. It's my dog.

153
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,480
can I ask you something?

154
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,119
Is your boss married?

155
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,359
He is usually very busy.

156
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,910
I really don't know much

157
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,430
about his personal life.

158
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,109
Then why is he always on business trips?

159
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,390
Is it because of work,

160
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,910
or does he work in another city?

161
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,040
The boss doesn't work for any company.

162
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,150
With his health,

163
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,190
he can't handle a nine-to-five job.

164
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,050
What's wrong with his health?

165
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,630
Well...

166
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,150
He has to run the coffee shop

167
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,850
and also attend school.

168
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,600
If he took on a full-time job
on top of that,

169
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,930
even a healthy person couldn't handle it.

170
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,890
Your coffee.

171
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,080
Enjoy.

172
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,790
-Thank you.
-Ms. Jiang, I'll be going then.

173
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,390
Thanks for the free coffee.

174
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,820
I'll be back tomorrow.

175
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,410
Ms. Jiang, you...

176
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,810
Tell your boss to come to my place
to pick it up.

177

Hurry, call Boss.

178
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:03,560
Boss,

179
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840
Quiet was taken away by Ms. Jiang.

180
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:09,910
Okay.

181
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,710
What did he say?

182
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,150
He just said

183
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,510
he got it.

184
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,780
Got it?

185
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,360

186
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,390
Baby Lightning, did you sleep well?

187
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,320
Good boy. Look at me.

Here, here.

189
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,910
Did you sleep well?

190
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,440
Tell me, did you sleep well?

191
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,120
Give me a hug.

192
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,390
Give me a hug.

193
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,100
Alright. Mommy will take you out to play.

194
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,520
Let's go.

195
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:45,670
Come on!

196
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,050
At least he has Lightning
to keep him company.

197
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,760
I have nothing.

198
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,690
Send me your address.

199
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,880
Building 6, Unit 4,

200
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,800
Apartment 302, Jingyuancheng.

201
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,030
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

202
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,320
It's strange.

203
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,080
Over the years,

204
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,120
I've met so many people—

205
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,040
handsome ones,

206
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,670
wealthy ones,

207
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,560
highly educated ones—

208
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,090
yet none of them
ever made my heart race again.

209
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,280
Sometimes

210
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,670
I even wonder if I've lost

211
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,400
the ability to feel that spark.

212
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,170
However,

213
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,450
after seeing Jin Zhao again,

214
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,280
the uncontrollable nervousness
and excitement

215
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,340
made me realize...

216
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:49,800
that maybe

217
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,500
only this man before me

218
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,030
can easily stir my heart.

219
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,950
Have you had dinner?

220
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,190
I ate on my way back.

221
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,880
Didn't I give you the apartment number?

222
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,140
Why didn't you come up?

223
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,280
He's not home.

224
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,640
You're living at his place now?

225
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,960
We don't own this place.

226
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,360
We rent it together.

227
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,600
Aren't you getting married?

228
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,530
You're not planning to buy a house?

229
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,300
We can't afford it.

230
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,350
He earns just over 4000 a month.

231
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,950
After insurance and provident fund,
there's not much left.

232
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,390
I'm just an intern.

233
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,230
I was thinking that once I go full-time,

234
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,290
I could save a bit more to help him.

235
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,280
Besides, the wedding was called off,

236
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,480
so buying a house isn't urgent anymore.

237
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,760
I thought I'd just find a place to get by.

238
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,960
How dare you mention the wedding again?

239
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,860
How dare you lie?

240
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,760
And how dare you believe it?

241
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,950
Where are my gold jewelry sets
and cash gift?

242
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,680
They're in the car.

243
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,760
Want me to bring them now?

244
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,360
No rush. Just keep them with you.

245
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,400
It's not like they'll run away.

246
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,960
I just finished dinner.

247
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,720
I'll take a walk and see you off.

248
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,120
Didn't Sanlai say Lightning was lost?

249
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,520
How did it end up with you?

250
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,710
You just got back and settled in.

251
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,230
Maybe he didn't want to trouble you,

252
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,360
so he left it with me.

253
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,760
You don't mind the trouble?

254
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:40,710
It's fine.

255
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,020
Who was it
that wouldn't let me keep a dog before?

256
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,150
You've really got a big heart.

257
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,470
You're keeping your ex-girlfriend's dog,

258
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,600
running a coffee shop

259
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,910
named after her,

260
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,740
and now you're even
walking the dog with her.

261
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,140
Doesn't your wife mind?

262
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:01,530
What?

263
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,170
Am I not your ex?

264
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,700
Doesn't your boyfriend mind?

265
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,510
You're out taking a walk
with another man late at night.

266
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,380
Of course he doesn't mind.

267
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:17,130
He even goes out singing
with other pretty girls all the time.

268
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,160
Then how does he treat you?

269
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,360
Just so-so.

270
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:30,000
Just last week we had a big fight

271
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,140
over a phone.

272
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,630
I've been using my phone for over 2 years,

273
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,090
so I wanted to get a new one.

274
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,290
He said I don't play games on my phone,

275
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,520
so I don't need a good one,

276
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,520
and that I just use it to chat anyway.

277
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,040
So he spent all that money

278
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,470
on gaming gear instead.

279
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,270
Then what do you see in him exactly?

280
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,000
I'm getting older,

281
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,130
so I just settled for someone to get by.

282
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,020
Don't joke like this with me again.

283
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:35,910
Go back now.

284
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,150
I'm leaving.

285
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,030
Why do you say I'm joking?

286
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,510
Why can't I say these things?

287
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,360

00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,260
He keeps them very well hidden.

374
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,630
Not even a photo?

375
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,210
Maybe he made it up

376
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,120
and was lying to you.

377
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,630
If he didn't have a wife and child,

378
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:50,390
what's the point
of making up a family to deceive us?

379
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,650
To keep admirers away.

380
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:52,880
Well,

381
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,510
that does make some sense.

382
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,980
Jin Zhao is pretty much a jerk.

383
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,910
He hates trouble

384
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,580
and often talks nonsense.

385
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,400
He just doesn't want women
making a move on him.

386
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,630
I just remembered something.

387
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,630
Last time I went to his place
to deliver something,

388
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,360
I saw a woman there.

389
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:09,710
A woman?

390
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,380
What kind of woman?

391
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,120
Just a very beautiful woman.

392
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,000
How beautiful?

393
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,230
The kind that

394
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,880
has the elegant air of a boss's wife.

395
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,150
Now that you mentioned it, I remember too.

396
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:24,360
Last time I called his home

397
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,520
to ask about Quiet,

398
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,040
a woman answered.

399
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,190
She also sounded very...

400
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:29,910
Enough!

401
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,080
Xiao Jia,

402
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,360
give me your boss's address right now.

403
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,120
I'd like to see what she looks like.

404
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,330
You're looking for Jin Zhao?

405
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,620
She even knows the password?

406
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,030
Come in and wait inside.

407
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,270
These are your slippers?

408
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:08,820
Yes.

409
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:13,710
I think we only have this one pair
of women's slippers.

410
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,960
Why don't you wear these for now?

411
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:18,360
All guests wear them.

412
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,530
Try them on and see if they fit.

413
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,840
Thank you.

414
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,110
Guest? You're a guest.

415
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,800
Your whole family is guests.

416
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,810
Please, have a seat.

417
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,470
What would you like to drink?

418
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,470
Anything is fine.

419
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,630
"Anything" is the hardest to deal with.

420
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,430
How about coffee?

421
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,690
I brought these beans back from Vietnam.

422
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:50,300
No need to go to the trouble.

423
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,400
Alright, then just water.

424
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,430
How about this?

425
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,390
Sit for a bit. I'll go take a shower.

426
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,110
You're taking a shower at his place?

427
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,310
Yes. I live here.

428
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,570
-You…
-Come on. I stink.

429
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,390
I can't stand it anymore.

430
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,200
A bunch of men
were smoking around me tonight.

431
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,660
I really can't stand the smell of smoke.
Make yourself at home.

432
