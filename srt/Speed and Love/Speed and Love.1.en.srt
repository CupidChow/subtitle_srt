00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,150
You look so elegant in this outfit.

6
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,150
So beautiful.

7
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,760
We've already prepared your room.

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,760
It's on the fourth floor.

9
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,960
I'm not staying here.

10
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,610
I want to live in my own home.

11

He's not my father either.

12
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,870

Don't be so stubborn, okay?

15
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,990
Don't think I don't know
what you're thinking.

16
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,200
You refuse to move out

17
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,040
because you think Jin Zhao and your father

18
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,370
would come back for you.

19
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,880

He promised me

00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,550
he would definitely come back to see me.

23
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,240

about Jin Zhao.

29
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,520
The reason
he hasn't been in touch for years

30
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,640
is because he doesn't have

31
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,080
any decent job there.

32
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,360
He's not your brother,

33
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,820
and you're not his sister.

34
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,670
Your father
also has his own new family now.

35
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,800
You're not family anymore.

36
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,590
So don't have too much contact with them

37
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,040
It's no good for you.

Xin, I'm talking to you.

193
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,599
Greet her.

194
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,859
How rude!

195
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,680
It's okay.

196
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,530
She doesn't have to.

197
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,680
It's our first meeting after all.

198
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,640
She should still greet you
even if it's the first meeting.

199
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,440
You two

200
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,400
are blood-related sisters.

201
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,410
Say hello.

202
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,710
Sister.

203
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,050
Come.

204
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,210
I brought gifts for you all.

205
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,840
We're all family.

206
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,990
Why spend this money?

207
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,160
Look how well-raised this child is,

208
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,680
polite and beautiful.

209
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,640
I didn't add any fillers today.

210
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,790
It's all pure meat.

211
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,210
Why does she get more than me?

212
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,120
She's a guest.

213
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,400
Isn't this filling

214
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,990
a bit too salty?

215
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,470
It tastes fine to me.

216
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,270
What would you know?

217
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,750
You drink alcohol

218
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,990
like water every day.

219
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,030
Your taste buds are pickled in alcohol.

220
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,360
How can you taste anything?

221
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:16,890
No wonder

222
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,180
our restaurant is doing worse and worse.

223
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,470
Brandy!

224
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,030
What brings you here?

225
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,290
Hey, Brandy, I need to ask you something.

226
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,160
Sanlai!

227
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,270
Have you eaten yet?

228
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:34,750
Go get a bowl.

229
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,710
Come, sit here and have a drink with me.

230
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,710
Everyone's home?

231
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,920
I'll pass today.

232
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,470
Uncle, I'll drink with you next time.

233
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,730
I need to talk to Brandy about something.

234
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,890
You all eat first.

235
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,350
I'll step out for a moment.

236
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,840
Have you really thought this through?

237
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,360
What if you die?

238
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,500
Your relative?

239
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,710
I'm leaving first.

240
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,170
Think about it carefully.

241
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,120
Young girl,

242
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,310
my name is Sanlai.

243
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,920
What's your name?

244
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,470
Jiang Mu.

245
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,370
Meaning "yearning day and night"?

246
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,840
Jiang Mu.

247
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,220
Come visit my shop sometime.

248
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,480
I'll tell you a secret.

249
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:09,920
Looking for me?

250
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,190
This is a gift for you.

251
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,270
Don't spend money
buying things for me in the future.

252
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,530
It's still necessary.

253
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,920
After all, I'm...

254
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,490
a guest.

255
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,650
What is he doing now

256
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,880
if he's not in school?

257
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,970
Why are there

258
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,990
blood stains on his face?

259
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,800
Are you sure about this?

260
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,840
What if you die?

261
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:37,650
[Zhao]

262
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,470
Brother.

263
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,360
You dropped something.

264
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,990
"Yearning day and night."

265
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,070
[Yearning day and night]

266
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:53,640
[I've approved your friend request.
We can now chat.]

267
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,600
Where are you?

268
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,270
I'm hungry.

269
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:11,880
Come down.

270
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,610
Where are we going?

271
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,970
Weren't you hungry?

272
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,460
Let's get some supper.

273
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,280
Why are you skipping about?

274
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,990
We're going for supper.

275
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,470
I'm just moving around a bit

276
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,510
so I can eat more.

277
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,410
Do you normally like drinking—

278
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,680
You're not a kid anymore.

279
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,810
Don't you know how to cross the street?

280
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,180
Do you know the way?

281
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,750
No, I don't.

282
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,200
Watch out!

283
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,670
Watch out for the puddle.

284
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,560
Steamed buns?

285
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,790
Barbecue?

286
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,290
Pick what you want.

287
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,710
I can choose anything?

288
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,460
Let's go with the busiest stall then.

289
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,190
Let's go.

290
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,670
Seafood fried rice.

291
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,900
Do you need anything else?

292
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,360
This and this.

293
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,310
Is that all?

294
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,600
Don't you have anything to say to me?

295
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,200
Like what?

296
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,790
It's been a long time.

297
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,420
Aren't you curious

298
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,640
about my life

299
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,120
and how I've been doing?

300
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,250
How's your stepfather?

301
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,200
Just so-so.

302
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,750
So you ran away from home?

303
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,880
Who said I ran away?

304
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,400
Then why are you here?

305
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,470
I'm here as a tourist.

306
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,030
Your mom bought you a return ticket.

307
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,290
Get some rest tonight.

308
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,200
I'll take you to the airport tomorrow.

309
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,260
I'm not going back.

310
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,750
Then call your mother.

311
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:02,840
Fine.

312
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,510
I'm not going back tomorrow.

313
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,570
Cancel the ticket.

314
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,440
I already asked her
to cancel tomorrow's flight.

315
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:15,840
Did she agree?

316
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,030
It doesn't matter.

317
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:19,290
I've already turned off my phone anyway.

318
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:29,120
I heard there's a place here
with lots of young people.

319
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,320
I want to check it out.

320
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,950
Check it out for what?

321
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,360
For romance.

322
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,600
Since you're not curious about my life,

323
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,270
why don't we

324
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,930
talk about yours instead?

325
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,510
How have you been

326
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,400
all these years?

327
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,510
Not great.

328
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,400
Tell me more.

329
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,630
I'll ask, and you answer.

330
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,250
What do you want to know?

331
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,710
What are you doing tomorrow?

332
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,230
Work.

333
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,310
What kind of work?

334
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:15,640
What about the day after?

335
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,900
Do you need something?

336
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,750
Do you do anything else?

337
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,920
Make money.

338
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,570
Besides making money?

339
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,400
Of course.

340
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,860
Eat, drink, sleep,
take a dump, and have fun.

341
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,720
Which one are you asking about?

342
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,470
Let's talk about

343
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,970
the "having fun" part.

344
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,160
Are you sure you want to talk about that?

345
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:49,990
Why?

346
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,570
Not comfortable discussing it with me,
your sister?

347
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,120
I've had too much fun,

348
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,340
can't remember it all right now.

349
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,240
Then let's change the subject.

350
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,190
Tell me about your new sister.

351
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,400
You mean Jin Xin?

352
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,970
Why are you smiling?

353
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,220
Bro, eating here again?

354
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,550
New boyfriend?

355
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,400
You're not replying to my messages.

356
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,720
So you're here picking up girls?

357
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:01,790
Brandy.

358
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,550
You like younger ones now?

359
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,340
Not even introducing her to your brothers?

360
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,550
Keeping her all to yourself.

361
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,880
Stop talking nonsense.

362
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,090
That's not what I do.

363
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,410
Young girl,

364
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,000
let me introduce myself.

365
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,270
I'm Crazy Jin.

366
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,790
Wasn't she the girlfriend on your car?

367
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,230
She's my...

368
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,680
Sister.

369
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,460
She's here traveling.

370
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,840
Leaving in a few days.

371
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,310
Sister?

372
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,070
Isn't your sister in elementary school?

373
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,870
Where did this sister come from?

374
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
Are you

375
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,640
related by blood?

376
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,120
I heard

377
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,040
you're going to that match.

378
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,920
That Lin is trouble.

379
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,050
Be careful, he might kill you.

380
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:09,830
Don't just eat.

381
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,719
Can't we just chat?

382
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:12,760
Waiter!

383
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,440
Yes?

384
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,670
A dozen beers!

385
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,380
Another glass too!

386
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,280
Okay!

387
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:19,550
Can you drink?

388
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,800
I ditched that girl

389
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:24,070
just to come find you
and keep you company.

390
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,670
Your drinks.

391
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,239
Thanks.

392
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,719
Hello? Check, please.

393
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,840
Okay. Just wait a moment please.

394
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,449
Your sister is easily satisfied.

395
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,190
You want to take care of her?

396
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:37,989
Sure.

397
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,239
Sister, hang out with me from now on.

398
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,770
I'll make sure you eat and drink well.

399
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,280
I'll feed you until you're plump,

400
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,510
even prettier than now.

401
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,280
How about it?

402
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:47,889
Is she really your sister?

403
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,070
She doesn't look like you.

404
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,030
Be careful Snakey catches you.

405
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:55,949
Let's go.

406
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,370
Don't go! The drinks just arrived!

407
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,110
Sister!

408
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,510
Who is Snakey?

409
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,400
Nobody.

410
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,510
Your girlfriend?

411
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:03,520
No.

412
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:07,990
Over there!

413
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,700
Who are they?

414
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,190
They're all our people.

415
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,150
Get lost.

416
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,280
Chase him!

417
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,150
Stay back!

418
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,150
