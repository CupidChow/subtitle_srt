[Episode 2]

3
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,280
This is for you.

4
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,280
When I come back,

5
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,870
I'll check how your handwriting's

6
00:01:58,289 --> 00:01:59,500
coming along.

7
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,580
Keep practicing your handwriting.

8
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,880
And don't be picky with your food.

9
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:05,890
Zhao.

10
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,520
Will you come back to see me?

11
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,410
Will you always think of me?

12
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,410
I will.

13
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,180
As long as you don't change,

14
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,350
I won't change either.

15
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,510
Zhao, it's been so long since you called.

16
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,160
I don't know how to reach you,

17
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,500
so I can only try to write to you.

18
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,900
I hope you'll receive this.

19
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,980
Mom and I are moving.

20
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,790
Once I know where we're going,

21
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,340
I'll write to you again.

22
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,620
Miss you. Mu.

23
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,810
Zhao,

24
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,160
Mom and I
have finally moved into our new house.

25
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,230
I really wish you could come back.

26
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,170
I'll be starting middle school next year.

27
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,900
I'll have lots of homework
and tutoring classes.

28
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,530
If I do well on my exams,

29
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,390
will you come back to see me

30
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,720
during the summer break after graduation?

31
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,230
Miss you. Mu.

32
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,190
Zhao,

33
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,130
this is the last time I'm writing to you,

34
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,070
because you never wrote me back,

35
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,340
and I feel like
I've been writing to the air.

36
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,990
I'm starting middle school soon.

37
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,910
I'll have many new classmates,

38
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,570
and I'll make more friends.

39
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,300
So,

40
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:30,940
that's it.

41
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,460
I won't miss you anymore. Mu.

42
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,020
I won't be at the shop tomorrow.

43
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,460
If it's urgent, ask Yang.

44
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,530
Yes.

45
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,740
I must go there tomorrow afternoon.

46
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,380
I know what I'm doing.

47
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,820
Alright, don't worry.

48
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,420
I'm hanging up.

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,640
Where are you sleeping tonight?

50
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,500
You go to sleep. I'll leave later.

51
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,600
Do you have somewhere to stay?

52
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,100
Mind your own business.

53
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,130
Goodbye.

54
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,950
Wait, Yang, are you

55
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,190
grilling skewers just to avoid drinking?

56
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,950
No. The fire's a bit too strong.

57
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,210
-I have to watch it.
-Don't burn it.

[Wan Qing]

59
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,810
I'll make it up to you later.

60
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,730
Something's going on tonight, huh?

61
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,810
Your phone's been busy.

62
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,330
A new girlfriend?

63
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,660
Just drink.

64
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,570
Drink while you can!

65
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,770
See? That's why I said

66
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,370
Jin, you're still the worst.

67
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,710
Eat up. I've got more here.

68
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,030
Come on.

69
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,430
Come on.

70
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:27,940
Cheers.

71
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,420
Come on, let's drink.

72
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,330
You beat him up.

73
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,440
That's not fair, Brother.

74
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,860
We didn't lay a finger on him.

75
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,540
He accidentally tripped

76
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,690
He bumped and fell.

77
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,490
Is that so?

78
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,940
I've brought the money.

79
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,660
I'm taking him with me.

80
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,190
Why didn't you answer my calls?

81
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,760
I'll bring the rest another day.

82
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,370
I called you over a dozen times,

83
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,659
and you didn't pick up once.

84
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,100
If there's nothing else, I'll be going.

85
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,230
Don't play such childish games again.

86
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,940
I hired the best chef from Diya City

87
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,130
and spent 5 hours on makeup and hair.

88
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,300
Even for my father's second wedding,

89
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,159
I didn't put this much effort
into dressing.

90
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:47,480
You're leaving without even taking a look?

91
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,880
You're not allowed to go.

92
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,159
I took a look.

93
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,330
Can I go now?

94
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,320
Jin Zhao,

95
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,140
how about this?

96
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,440
Stay and have dinner with me,

97
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,060
and I'll write off all of Jin Qiang's

98
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,940
gambling debt.

99
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:08,830
What do you say?

100
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,150
Just one meal?

101
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,680
Stay with me

102
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,080
after dinner.

103
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,160
And what exactly would I be staying for?

104
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,170
For...

105
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,860
Are you asleep?

106
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,350
I have something to do. I'm leaving.

107
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,530
You're abandoning your father?

108
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,390
He's yours now.

109
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,130
It's late.

110
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,200
Go to sleep now.

111
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,080
Will you come back tomorrow?

112
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,350
You took the gift?

113
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:41,940
Did you open it?

114
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,450
You're up?

115
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,110
Why are you spacing out? Come here.

116
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,400
I made you something to eat.

117
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,200
Have some food before you go out.

118
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,170
Mrs. Zhao,

119
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,290
do you know where Jin Zhao went?

120
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,150
Do you need him for something?

121
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,660
I'm just asking.

122
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,850
He's busy outside.

123
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,970
He usually doesn't come home?

124
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,070
There's nothing going on at home.

125
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,210
Why would he come back?

126
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:06,810
Hurry.

127
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,070
I'll go take a shower first.

128
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,850
There's nothing going on at home.

129
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,110
Why would he come back?

130
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,880
Mrs. Zhao,

131
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,800
the water heater is broken.

132
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,510
What's wrong?

133
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,090
This...

134
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,210
What's happening? The water...

135
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,760
How did the water heater

136
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,010
suddenly break?

137
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,370
I can't fix this.

138
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,950
How did this happen?

139
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,550
Don't panic.

140
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,120
Where are you?

141
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,490
The pipe on the water heater at home
fell off.

142
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,950
Hurry back and take a look.

143
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,140
If the water floods downstairs,

144
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,040
they'll come up and give us trouble.

145
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,490
I don't know how to fix it.

146
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,180
Mrs. Zhao.

147
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,540
Why don't we

148
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,020
ask Jin Zhao to fix it?

149
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,780
What are you looking at?

150
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,420
The sun.

151
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,450
Looking at the sun in the bathroom?

152
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,330
Did you fix it?

153
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,170
Xin,

154
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,720
what are you doing?

155
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,840
Looking at the sun too?

156
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,560
Go back to your room.

157
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,770
How is it?

158
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,360
The water has stopped,

159
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,620
but the pipe is broken.

160
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,940
What should we do?

161
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,600
The water heater is too old.

162
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,240
It's hard to find a replacement pipe.

163
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,570
Let's just get a new one.

164
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,180
Why spend money on that?

165
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,920
Find a way to reconnect it.

166
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,030
As long as it works.

167
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,380
I'll order a new one.

168
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,330
Sanlai will come to install it.

169
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,530
Don't worry about it.

170
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,570
Xin, why are you standing here?

171
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,300
Come on.

172
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,050
Go mind your own business.

173
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:51,850
Come quickly.

174
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,270
Well, when can I take a shower?

175
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,380
Once it's installed.

176
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,870
When will it be installed?

177
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,090
Sanlai will come to install it soon.

178
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,660
Someone else is going to install it?

179
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,520
What about you?

180
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,370
I have something to do.

181
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,160
What is it?

182
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,090
Why do you have so many questions?

183
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,440
Hello. Hello.

184
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,000
Go, follow him.

185
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:48,790
Get in!

186
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,450
Thank you.

187
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,020
Hello. How can I help you?

188
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,650
This one. This one. I want this.

189
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,530
Please wait at platform 1.

190
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,610
Thank you for your cooperation.

191
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,760
Why are you following me?

192
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,910
What a coincidence. You're here too.

193
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,380
I'm shopping around here.

194
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,620
Weren't you going shopping?

195
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,720
The internet says there's an event
on Thursday

196
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,900
with lots of handsome guys.

197
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,430
It's only Wednesday today.

198
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,890
What do you think of this banana?

199
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,040
It looks sweet.

200
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,920
Do you need a fruit knife to eat a banana?

201
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,090
Didn't you just buy it from the store?

202
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,210
I'm planning to

203
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,630
buy a watermelon later.

204
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,290
Bananas and watermelons are both good.

205
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,520
Buy yourself something to eat and drink.

206
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,580
Stop following me.

207
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,780
I'll tell you one more time—

208
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,840
stop following me.

209
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,580
Hello.

210
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,080
Here, please.

211
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,160
300.

212
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,130
100.

213
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,610
200.

214
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,400
-100, please.
-No, no, no.

215
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,850
-200, 200.
-100.

216
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,360
Stop here.

217
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,400
Scamming people for money again, huh?

218
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,520
Aren't you Brandy's sister?

219
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,720
What are you doing here?

220
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,850
Where are you going?

221
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,370
Jin Zhao and I made an appointment.

222
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,830
I'm just going to find him.

223
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,470
Now?

224
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,450
He really allowed you to go?

225
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,140
Yes.

226
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,700
Jin,
did you make an appointment with him too?

227
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,160
I was just about to go.

228
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,560
Perfect. Let's go together.

229
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,349
I was going to take a cab,

230
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,099
but I didn't bring enough cash.

231
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,880
He really said you could come?

232
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,490
Look, we're running out of time.

233
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,369
You brought enough cash, right?

234
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:22,369
I'll get on first.

235
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,480
To Peita.

236
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,760
Quick! Don't stop!

237
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,970
Beat him!

238
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,380
Good!
Don't give him a chance to fight back!

239
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,440
Don't give him a chance to fight back!

240
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,050
Yes! Yes! Yes!

241
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Count! Count! Count!

242
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,320
Five!

243
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,510
Four!

244
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,970
Three!

245
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,220
Two!

246
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,380
One!

247
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,490
Uncle,

248
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,980
you were right. We won!

249
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,040
That was just the appetizer.

250
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,930
The real show hasn't started yet.

251
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,450
In the next match,

252
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,340
He Zhang

253
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,610
will give Brandy a beating!

254
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,630
Who's his opponent?

255
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,580
Someone works for Wan Shengbang.

256
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,530
His name is He Zhang,

257
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,990
and he seems pretty tough.

258
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,620
Yes, tough.

259
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,250
I've seen him fight.

260
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,050
He won't lose.

261
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,310
Don't miss the mountain roads
in Qingshi.

262
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,850
You'll still have to

263
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,920
keep playing along with Wan's.

264
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,410
Sorry to put you through this match.

265
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,070
Be careful.

266
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,010
Try not to hurt

267
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,300
your hands or legs.

268
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,690
I know what I'm doing.

269
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,900
Ready to take a beating?

270
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,920
Lin Sui raised the bet.

271
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,510
Wan's raised the bet.

272
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,860
Dad, how could you raise the bet?

273
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,800
What if something goes wrong?

274
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:26,860
Qing,

275
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,210
are you worried about He Zhang

276
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,640
or about Brandy?

277
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,170
You just love stirring up trouble,
don't you?

278
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,170
If you don't want to watch, get lost.

279
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,050
He Zhang.

280
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,310
If you dare hurt him,

281
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,510
you're dead.

282
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,320
You care about him that much?

283
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,500
He's my man.

284
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,440
Go home!

285
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,020
Don't disappoint me.

286
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,490
Bite down on your mouthguard.

287
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,660
Okay, hands.

288
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,280
No jewelry or hard objects allowed.

289
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,880
Good. Now show me your hands.

290
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,000
Listen to me.

291
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,630
No strikes to the back of the head
or the spine.

292
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,460
Fight!

293
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,330
Not bad, Zhang!

294
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,820
Beat him! Remember!

295
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,730
Get up, He Zhang!

296
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,610
Sorry to put you through this match.

297
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,120
You'll still have to keep playing along

298
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,390
with Wan's.

299
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,100
Come on!

300
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,610
Stop, stop.

301
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:06,860
Who is she?

302
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,550
She's with Brandy.

303
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,270
Come on, who is she?

304
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,200
She has wine.
Please.

305
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,670
Do me a favor.

306
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:21,450
Okay.

307
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,240
Let's go.

308
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,690
Brandy is Jin Zhao?

309
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,030
Why do you all call him Brandy?

310
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,500
Isn't there a Chinese saying?

311
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,810
"Drink while you can?"

312
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:35,720
Smart.

313
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,340
They only let familiar faces in;

314
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,940
strangers can't get inside.

315
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,530
Stop, stop, stop.

316
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,530
Okay, okay, okay.

317
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:00,810
Where is Jin Zhao?

318
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,060
In the ring.

319
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,200
Let's go, sis.

320
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,660
Don't let him see you.

321
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,920
He'll get distracted.

322
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,860
Make way, please.

323
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:31,560
Okay.

324
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,340
Brandy.

325
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,900
Take him down!

326
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,970
What?

327
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:45,970
Lin bet on Brandy,

328
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,730
and Wan bet on He Zhang?

329
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:49,600
Who are they?

330
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,820
That guy in red over there

331
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:54,860
is Lin.

332
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,550
He's the owner of this place

333
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,950
and the banker for today.

334
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,360
That old man sitting across

335
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,340
is the owner of Wan's Auto Shop—

336
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,640
half the garages here belong to him.

337
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,590
The blond guy

338
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,580
is the local boxing champion.

339
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,860
Ten times the stakes.

340
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,340
That's insane!

341
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,100
Is he trying to kill Brandy?

342
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:13,970
Well...

343
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,270
can't we just call it off?

344
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,000
Let's get Jin Zhao out of here.

345
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,810
Of course not, sis.

346
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:21,820
Everyone here has already placed bets.

347
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,610
Once you're in the ring,
your fate is in the hands of heaven.

348
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,260
What about the money?
Are you going to pay it back?

349
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,100
I'll pay.

350
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,670
I have money.

351
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,530
There's money in my bank account.

352
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,530
If I pay, can the fight be called off?

353
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:05,720
Jin.
Hit him!

354
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,940
Jin Zhao!

355
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:18,300
Beat him!

356
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,700
Stop! Stop!

357
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,430
Get up, Brandy! Bro!

358
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,470
Jin Zhao!

359
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,770
Count the seconds, ref! Count the seconds!

360
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:49,690
Jin Zhao!

361
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,620
Get up! Get up!

362
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,010
Jin Zhao!

363
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,020
Eight!

364
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,490
Seven!

365
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,860
Six!

366
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,180
Five!

367
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,690
Four!

368
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,010
Three!

369
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,210
Two!

370
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,630
One!

371
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,220
Sis!

372
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,050
Are you okay?

373
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:47,170
Okay?

374
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,260
Fight!

375
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:01,900
Zhao!

376
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:07,680
