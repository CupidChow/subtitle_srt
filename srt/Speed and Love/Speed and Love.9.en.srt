00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:50,420
No.

4
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,660
After all, he's still my father.

5
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,340
-Can't you just...
-Apple.

6
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:57,000
I don't like mealy apples.

7
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,450
I have to go.

8
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,040
Call me when you've made up your mind.

9
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,829
You're quite confident, huh?

10
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,780
What makes you think

11
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,400
I'd eat anything you feed me?

12
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,829
Do you want her to keep bothering you?

13
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,960
I'm not afraid of that.

14
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,940
Really?

15
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,780
Not even afraid of a woman
clinging to you?

16
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,820
What's there to be afraid of?

17
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,500
It depends on
which woman we're talking about.

18
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,940
Wan Qing?

19
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,420
She's nothing to be afraid of.

20
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,940
What about other women?

21
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:24,010
Who?

22
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,060
Who are you afraid of?

23
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,420
In my entire life,

24
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,640
I've never been afraid of anyone.

25
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,300
You sure about that?

26
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,420
Maybe one day you'll meet a woman

27
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,280
you're really, really afraid of.

28
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,980
If that day comes,

29
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,240
I'll accept my fate.

30
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,579
I specially found you

31
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,050
a coach who speaks Chinese.

32
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:23,580
This one.

33
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,610
Coach Hua.

34
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,700
Hello, Coach.

35
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,860
I've been a top coach for ten years.

36
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,540
You can trust me.

37
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,220
Congratulations, my lucky star,

38
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,950
for passing your driving test!

39
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,290
It's all thanks to you.

40
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,890
It's because you're naturally gifted.

41
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,460
Actually, I don't even know why,

42
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,120
but the moment I first saw you,

43
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,860
I just wanted to be close to you.

44
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,050
That's no mystery.

45
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,480
It's because you're beautiful and kind.

46
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,550
Stop teasing. I'm being serious.

47
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,340
It might be a connection
from our past lives.

48
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,020
That's it.

49
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,080
It's called...

50
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,540
"instant..."

51
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,260
"Instant connection!"

52
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,659
Your Chinese is really good.

53
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:34,860
You even know idioms.

54
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,490
Xin,

55
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,130
why did your grades drop so fast?

56
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,980
Did you not understand the lessons?

57
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,730
Xin,

58
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,110
you must study hard.

59
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,610
If I had studied hard back then,

60
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,310
I wouldn't be a hoodlum now.

61
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,630
Are you cut out for studying?

62
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,610
Back then, a C was already

63
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,210
-way beyond your usual performance.
-Go away.

64
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,510
I've gotten a C before.

65
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,660
You must

66
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,310
take my words to heart.

67
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,340
Okay, okay. I got it.

68
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,860
You really did?

69
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,750
Then I'll sign this for you this time.

70
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,490
Wait, Xin.

71
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,340
Do you understand
all the questions you got wrong now?

72
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,460
Let me tell you,

73
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,220
making mistakes isn't scary.

74
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:41,860
What's scary is...

75
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,260
I think you're the scary.

76
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,580
Are you signing it or not? If not, I will.

77
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,780
Why so many words?

78
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,490
Xin,

79
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,290
how do you write Jin in Jin Zhao?

80
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,810
-Give me a break.
-With your education level...

81
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,050
Give it to me. I'll sign it.

82
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,710
I just can't recall right now.

83
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,710
Let me think.

84
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,810
So rusty. Give it to me.

85
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,050
Do you even know how to sign it?
Give it to me.

86
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,220
-Who's going to sign it?
-Me.

87
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:01,980
I will. Give it to me.

88
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,490
-Let me.
-You know how to write it?

89
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,580
You don't know how to write it.
How can you sign it?

90
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,150
I'll sign it now. I remember it now.

91
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,750
-Give it to me.
-I'll sign it.

93
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,330
Well...

94
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,860
Brandy, don't get angry.

95
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,090
One test doesn't mean anything.

96
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,900
Right. Xin's actually been working hard.

97
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,490
Yes, she got an A before.

98
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,860
She even got an A+ once. I signed those.

99
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,930
You... shut up!

100
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,150
These last two questions aren't hard.

101
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,090
Why did you leave them blank?

102
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,190
I did it on purpose.

103
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,050
Why?

104
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,290
The teacher said the first-place student

105
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,460
needs to give a speech
as the student representative.

106
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,460
I don't want to go.

107
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,580
You're getting more and more
strong-willed as you grow up.

108
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,100
Not bad.
I've only ever written reflections,

109
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,460
never given a speech.

110
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,020
I was afraid my mom would nag.

111
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,220
I didn't expect you guys to be even worse.

112
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,620
She's talking about you.

113
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,170
I'll sign it for you this time.

114
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,460
Next time,

115
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,370
just talk to your teacher.

116
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,810
Don't pull these little tricks.

117
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:11,610
I see.

118
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,060
Yang, take her home.

119
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,130
Yes, Master.

120
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,750
Go now.

121
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,030
Be careful on your way.

122
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,050
Aren't you a bit too strict with Xin?

123
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,000
Too harsh. She's just a kid.

124
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,890
Indeed.

125
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,780
You two have pretended to be her parents

haven't you?

I'm... I'm thirsty?

132

I'll move somewhere else to talk.

133

Alright, alright.

-I'll go somewhere else.
-Okay, okay.

Just a moment.

Here's your milk tea. Welcome back.

Thank you.

This looks cool.

142
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,100
The skills
are a bit rough compared to mine.

143
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,300
You're bragging.

144
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,610
Has the locking collar been adjusted?

145

Is it that obvious?

147
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,370
There was a noise when you drove in.

148
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,580
It's loose.

149
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,860
I just modified this car.

150
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,460
Can you check it again for me?

151
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:09,820
See that?

152
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,370
Indeed.

153
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,030

00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,060
the right locking collar is also broken.

157
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,460

You picked the worst-tasting one.

This one?

166

Come with me.

Don't accuse me wrongly.

Not really.

189
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,300
I'm lost. Wait for me on the mountain.

190
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,820
Which car?

191
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,370
That one.

192
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,540
Let's go.

193
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,140
What does this mean?

194
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,940
It's an understanding between drivers,

195
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,100
like a secret code.

196
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,100
Aren't you going to note it in your phone?

197
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,070
It's not necessary.

198
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,170
Hold on tight.

199
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:14,870
Don't touch it yet.

200
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,150
The engine's really hot right now.

201
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,720
Why hasn't he come yet?

202
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,820
Lin Sui, look.

203
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,080
That cute little pickup
is heading up the mountain.

204
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,610
Do you think that guy is faking it?

205
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,490
If not,

206
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,860
it's even funnier.

207
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,890
Why did you call Sanlai here?

208
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,820
That's something

209
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,120
I'm wondering too.

210
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,340
Sanlai, what took you so long?

211
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,010
I've been waiting for you for an hour.

212
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,010
What's the rush?

213
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,250
It's such a big event.

214
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,450
I had to get myself properly dressed up.

215
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,130
The outfit looks good.

216
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,340
But that red scarf...

217
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,450
You have great taste.

218
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,020
This is for good luck—

219
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,050
it means a victorious start.

220
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:34,890
Do you know

221
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,490
when you were driving earlier,

222
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,350
that camera...

223
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,160
Well...

224
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,030
Let's get started.

225
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,250
Let's go.

226
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,730
Good luck.

227
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:10,690
Brandy said

228
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,130
this car is modified.

229
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,460
1000 HP, 2000 torque,

230
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,550
Wankel engine.
It's faster than race cars on the track.

231
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,460
Sorry.

232
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,110
I didn't mean to take advantage of you.

233
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,960
I should be a good host.

234
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,460
I'll give you a 5-second head start.

235
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,180
How's that?

236
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,300
Then I'll respectfully accept your offer.

237
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,830
The guest follows the host.

238
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,650
Sanlai,

239
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,080
are you okay? Be careful.

240
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,100
I'm fine.

241
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,300
I just used a little trick

242
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,760
and gained the upper hand.

243
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:49,340
Go back.

244
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,060
Let's go!

245
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,130
Let's move!

246
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,940
Looks like...

247
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,310
it won't take 5 seconds.

248
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,730
I realized

249
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,890
we need to follow the rules in games.

250
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,530
You don't need
to let me go first this time.

251
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,590
Let's go together.

252
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,180
Give me the hat.

253
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:48,900
Give it to me.

254
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,980
This hat isn't mine.

255
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,710
I need to return it to its owner.

256
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,030
I'll return it for you.

257
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,060
There's a good cupcake shop

258
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,190
at the service area down the mountain.

259
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:06,819
See you there.

260
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,040
If you get there within half an hour,
it's on me.

261
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,670
Today really got off to a bad start.

262
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,500
All this dressing up was for nothing.

263
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,700
You're a typical underachiever
with lots of stationery.

264
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,260
Alright, let's head back.

265
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,540
Going up the mountain was so difficult.

266
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,890
Going down must be much easier.

267
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:27,740
You're wrong.

268
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,360
The downhill road is the hardest to drive.

269
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,030
Why do I feel a little dizzy?

270
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,020
I'll drive.

271
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,300
Jiang Mu,

272
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,650
are you sure?

273
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,510
It took me over an hour to drive up.

274
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,450
Don't worry.

275
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,230
We'll definitely get there
within half an hour.

276
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,520
She only took 23 minutes.

277
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:16,500
Hello.

278
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,820
Hello, sir.

279
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,410
Two of each: black tea, green tea,

280
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,130
and lemon flavors.

281
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,930
And two without cream.

282
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,500
Sanlai,
why are you only buying the cake bases?

283
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,630
They're for Brandy.

284
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,270
Brandy never eats

285
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,340
the cream on cake.

286
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,890
I don't even know

287
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,090
what's left of a cupcake without cream.

288
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,970
He's not really into sweets.

289
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,170
You know he doesn't like sweets?

290
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,330
That habit of his

291
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,980
is a bit annoying, isn't it?

292
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:45,980
By the way,

293
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,190
why did Lin Sui take your hat earlier?

294
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,740
I have no idea.

295
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,290
That guy is pretty weird.

296
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,170
I already told him

297
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,210
that the hat wasn't mine

298
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,610
and that I needed to return it
to its owner.

299
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,130
But Lin said,

300
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,540
"I'll return it to him for you."

301
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,040
Ridiculous.

302
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,410
Does he even know whose hat it is?

303
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,170
Whose is it?

304
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,930
It's Brandy's.

305
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,710
Sir, your cakes are ready.

306
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,550
Thanks. How much is it in total?

307
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,480
Someone already paid for you.

308
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,740
Already paid?

309
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,370
Yes.

310
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,130
Who was it?

311
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,060
Sanlai,

312
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,110
do you know how long it took us

313
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,990
to get down the mountain just now?

314
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:30,970
Not sure.

315
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,500
40 or 50 minutes?

316
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,780
23 minutes.

317
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,420
23 minutes?

318
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,580
Turn on the lights
if you want to take photos with the car.

319
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,020
Hey handsome, you're cute!

320
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,170
Can we take a photo with you?

321
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,540
Come on, come on, together.

322
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,130
Make me look cool.

323
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,500
Three, two, one.

324
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,210
One more, one more!

325
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,290
Come on.

326
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,460
Thank you, handsome.

327
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,650
Thanks!

328
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,080
You're welcome.

329
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,860
Your car looks great too.

330
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,260
-Thank you. You have good taste!
-Bye-bye.

331
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,600
Don't forget me
next time you want to take a photo.

332
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,080
Sure.

333
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:09,820
Bye-bye!

334
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:10,930
Sanlai,

335
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,860
looks like you're quite popular.

336
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,970
So why do you make yourself

337
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:14,750
look like this?

338
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,540
Why don't you spruce yourself up a bit?

339
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,610
Look like what?

340
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,740
I put a lot of effort into this look.

341
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,970
Yes, I can see that.

342
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,450
It's just that your hair

343
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,320
is kind of covering your eyes.

344
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,060
Well,

345
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,040
it's mainly because I'm just too charming.

346
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,860
I'm afraid the girls
will be so distracted when they see me

347
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,340
that they won't be able to move,

348
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,060
and it'll affect my pet shop business.

349
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,740
That's why

350
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,060
I make my handsomeness

351
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,780
look a bit mysterious.

352
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,000
You really put a lot of thought into that.

353
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:48,730
Of course.

354
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,410
I mean it.

355
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,110
If you trim your beard

356
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,820
and cut your hair a bit shorter,

357
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,860
you may look much fresher.

358
00:20:59,060 --> 00:20:59,990
Are you serious?

359
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,060
Yes.

360
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,110
I think maybe you'll even become

361
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,680
more popular than Brandy.

362
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,250
Girl,

363
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,210
since you said that,

364
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,480
I'll have to

365
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,410
get rid of this haircut

366
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,820
and my beard.

367
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,630
Come on, I'll take you home.

368
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,200
Home?

369
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,510
[Speeding Auto House]

370
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,890
What's gotten into you?

371
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,260
Jiang Mu told me

372
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:04,370
I'd look fresher this way.

373
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,500
So, what do you think?

374
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,360
Still as handsome as ever, right?

375
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,260
But I think

376
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,580
I'm a bit more handsome than you now.

377
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,430
Here.

378
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,300
I'm back.

379
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,470
-Mu, you're here.
-Mu.

380
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,020
Sanlai?

381
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,170
You... you...

382
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,340
Why do you look like this now?

383
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,650
Like what?

384
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,610
You had a haircut and you shaved?

385
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,430
I didn't know your features were so sharp.

386
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,390
It's the first time
I've seen your forehead.

387
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,630
This style is so trendy,

388
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,580
like an idol.

389
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,900
How do you like it?
I just bought all of this.

390
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,130
You look much cooler this way.

391
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:27,930
These beads are so cute.

392
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:28,780
Do they come in colors?

393
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,970
I want the same ones.

394
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,740
I got them for 19.90
at the store next door.

395
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,360
What about this?

396
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,050
Look.

397
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,970
Not bad, really.

398
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,130
Jiang Mu.

399
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,860
Look at this. Do you like it?

400
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,580
Jiang Mu!

401
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:48,340
Come here.

402
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:50,690
I'll go first.

403
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,260
Did you see Sanlai?

404
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,450
He's completely changed.

405
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,540
-Completely...
-I hear you always ask Sanlai about me.

406
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,060
What did you find out?

407
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,610
Not much.

408
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,240
You know him. He always

409
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,740
goes off on tangents

410
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,690
and can't stop praising himself.

411
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,300
But I have to say, with this new look,

412
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,780
he's actually quite handsome.

413
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,890
Look at how he's...

414
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,820
You're not mad

415
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,610
because I always pry into your business,

416
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,690
are you?

417
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,670
Why do you want to know about my business?

418
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,930
Because it's you.

419
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,480
You know very well

420
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,860
that we're not blood‑related.

421
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,590
We lived together for a while
when we were young,

422
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,750
but back then you were just a child.

423
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,100
Now,

424
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,700
you keep coming here.

425
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:50,130
What will others think if they find out?

426
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,110
What will Jin Qiang think?

427
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,260
Or do you just...

428
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,070
want something to happen...

429
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,990
between us?

430
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:44,220
Mu!

431
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,610
I'll bring... I...

432
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:52,890
What's going on here?

433
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,340
[Jin's Chinese Restaurant]

434
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,070
Three cases of beer.

435
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,370
Three cases of beer. That's correct.

436
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,000
Why doesn't it add up?

437
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,890
Hello.

438
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:15,840
It's you again.

439
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,740
We have customers.
Go sleep somewhere else.

440
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,670
Go sleep somewhere else! Hurry up!

441
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,540
Hello.

442
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,410
I'm sorry.

443
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,260
We've sold out of all our dishes today.

444
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,650
Only dumplings are left.

445
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,650
Meat or vegetable dumplings?

446
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,860
Which one would you like?

447
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,920
You recommend one.

448
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,160
Okay then. Please take a seat.

449
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:47,420
You're here.

450
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,300
Here are your dumplings.

451
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,020
Thank you.

452
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,850
The condiments are here.

453
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,260
Alright?

454
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,100
Zhao.

455
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,140
Zhao, help me watch the shop.

456
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,260
There's a customer inside.

457
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,650
Give him whatever he asks for.

458
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,910
-Okay.
-I'll go get something next door.

459
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,890
Yours looks more delicious.

460
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,220
My dumplings are too salty.

461
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,710
Your fried rice looks...

462
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,860
pretty good.

463
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,060
Finish your food and leave.

464
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,320
Don't come back again.

465
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,520
I'm here to return something.

466
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,960
Let's have a talk.

467
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,220
Was that you on the mountain that night?

468
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,650
I never expected the person
I've been looking for all this time

469
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,540
to be you.

470
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,670
Don't you remember?

471
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,970
Last time you barged into my racing team

472
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,770
when I wasn't paying attention.

473
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,780
And the boxing match.

474
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,970
I want you to fight a match for me.

475
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,030
Your opponent
is He Zhang from Wan Shengbang's team.

476
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:47,500
If you win,

477
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,460
I'll give you a sum of money.

478
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:54,020
I'll let you know
the time and place later.

479
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,320
I didn't expect you

480
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:59,060
to run away halfway through the fight.

481
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,230
Then a pink pickup showed up,

482
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,730
and the owner actually admitted

483
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,740
that he was the one driving that night.

484
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,270
I agreed to race him,
though I was suspicious.

485
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:10,930
That guy

486
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,900
was arranged by you, right?

487
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:18,610
One race,

488
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,580
just the two of us.

489
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,710
There's no need.

490
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,340
Liang Yanfeng drives faster than me.

491
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,200
Why don't you go find him instead?

492
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,600
I've known him for many years.

493
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,980
He's never beaten me.

494
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:39,820
But you have.

495
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,820
That's because I know the roads better.

496
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,280
Just happened to be lucky.

497
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,410
One more time.

498
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:50,820
Not interested.

499
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,820
So what

500
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,310
would make you interested?

501
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,060
Eat up.

502
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,450
I got information

503
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,970
that next up is the cornering speed race.

504
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:29,930
Get prepared.

505
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:32,290
Only one race left,

506
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:35,370
and you can make the top 3.

507
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:37,750
I'm not confident.

508
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:40,210
Last time,

509
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:43,020
I almost lost.

510
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,940
There's still some time.

511
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,460
Only by getting first

512
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,420
can you transport their cargo.

513
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,300
That way, Wan Shengbang's
secret business will be cut off,

514
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,830
and we'll get the evidence.

515
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,380
What's wrong? Having problems?

516
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,060
How did you

517
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:22,650
drive back then?

518
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,210
As a top racer,

519
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,370
one obviously needs

520
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:44,410
calmness,

521
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,410
attentiveness,

522
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,100
courage,

523
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:50,970
and skill.

524
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,170
All of this...

525
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,590
is bullshit.

526
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,800
So what's really the most important?

527
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,110
Mastery.

528
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:22,510
You need to master everything

529
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,370
you're supposed to control.

530
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:25,739
What is a car?

531
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:28,530
A car is an extension of your body.

532
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,699
And you

533
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,489
should become part of the car,

534
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,010
the most essential part.

535
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:38,300
You need to understand its breathing,

536
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,340
its rhythm,

537
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,050
its sound,

538
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,659
and its temperature.

539
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:54,659
Of course,

540
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,380
with just these things,

541
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,890
it's not enough

542
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,820
for one to become a top racer.

543
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,260
You need to be so skilled

544
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,490
that your hands
are faster than your brain,

545
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,180
making all your movements

546
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,150
become muscle memory

547
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,840
and every decision and action

548
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,740
happens instinctively,

549
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,820
without thinking.

550
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,140
Want to know how to achieve this?

551
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,570
Come help me deliver food tomorrow.

552
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,650
Let your body

553
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,110
drive your car.

554
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,620
Is there a simpler way to put it?

555
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,220
Yes.

556
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,370
Don't be a coward.

557
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:41,990
I'm leaving.

558
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:46,850
Drive carefully.

559
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:47,910
Drink moderately.

560
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,820
I'll come see you tomorrow.

561
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,700
You brat.

562
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,140
Or do you just...

563
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,420
want something to happen...

564
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,950
between us?

565
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:17,450
So annoying.

566

567
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:23,700
Jiang Mu,

568
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,490
I made seafood hotpot today.

569
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,600
Come over tonight and eat with us.

570
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,210
She replied pretty fast.

571
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:35,500
I'm eating vegetarian tonight.

572
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,500
I won't be coming.

573
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,700
Did you say something

574
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,610
to Jiang Mu?

575
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,780
She hasn't been coming over lately.

576
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:53,820
I did.

577
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,320
Can you cook faster?

578
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:12,050
Can you drive faster?

579
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,860
I'd like to drive faster.

580
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,620
The rotors on your car
are completely worn out.

581
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,010
If I drive any faster, it will fall apart.

582
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,180
Just step on it.

583
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,740
If you can wreck it, I'll be impressed.

584
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,410
Turn off the AC while driving.

585
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,620
The food
will taste different if it gets cold.

586
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,480
People will say my cooking is bad.

587
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:29,180
Got it.

588
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:30,950
Come back quickly.

589
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,670
We still have 7 or 8 more orders
to deliver.

590
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,990
When will my food arrive? I'm starving.

591
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:08,140
Ten minutes.

592
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,220
Why is it taking so long?

593
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,080
Your restaurant's delivery is too slow.

594
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,740
I'm going to file a complaint.

595
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,080
If you had come before 7,

596
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,210
