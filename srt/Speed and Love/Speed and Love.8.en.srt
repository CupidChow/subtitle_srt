[Episode 8]

3
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,400
Let's talk about it later.

4
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,100
Come back.

5
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,610
You're the girl
from the boxing gym that day, right?

6
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,770
So what if I was?

7
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,579
How did you hook up with Jin Zhao?

8
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,060
Have you two slept together?

9
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,690
Don't talk nonsense.

10
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,650
He and I aren't like that.

11
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,700
And who are you?

12
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,170
Guess.

13
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,530
Snakey?

14
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:43,810
Are you crazy?

15
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,220
What snake? That's a dragon on my waist!

16
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,790
So you're Dragon then.

17
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,860
I just realized

18
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,680
you're kinda cute,

19
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,210
like a little bunny.

20
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,680
I'm Wan Qing.

21
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,420
And you?

22
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,930
Jiang Mu.

23
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:13,740
Jiang Mu.

24
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,050
Jiang.

25
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,700
Tell me,

26
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:25,240
what's really going on
between Jin Zhao and you?

27
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,370
Be honest.

28
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,050
Tell me!

29
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,240
What are you doing?

30
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:40,880
Don't scare her.

31
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,490
I'm just joking with her.

32
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,750
Right?

33
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,700
Why so fierce?

34
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,650
If you think I'm fierce, get lost.

35
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,980
No way.

36
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,370
I just like you this way.

37
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,260
Besides,

38
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,210
I've only been gone for a few days,

39
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,530
and you've already hooked up
with someone new.

40
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,810
That's so heartless.

41
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:08,740
Come on,

42
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,320
let's go get some pork trotters.
Ignore him.

43
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,020
Crazy, Crazy! Hurry!

44
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,410
Clear some space, clear some space!

45
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,940
Hot dish coming through!

46
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,580
Jiang Mu,

47
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,500
guess what's in here?

48
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,470
You really made chicken soup?

49
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,790
Brandy bought the chicken this morning,

50
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,180
and I just stewed it for you.

51
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,950
I didn't lie to you, right?

52
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,870
Thank you.

53
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,159
Brandy,

54
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,270
come sit with me and have a drink.

55
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,560
These pork trotters are delicious.

56
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,090
Pass them around. Try some.

57
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,470
Quick, give me some.

58
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,200
Here you go.

59
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:20,950
Cheers.

60
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,610
You don't know how to eat trotters?

61
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,900
Eat.

62
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:31,970
I'll eat it later.

63
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,590
What?

64
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,409
I stewed this chicken for two hours,

65
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:45,940
and you want the first bite?

66
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,870
What do you even need nourishment for?
Are you crazy?

67
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,200
Come on, come on.

68
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,100
My bad, my bad.

69
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,660
Sis.

70
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,470
Please try some.

71
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,510
Thank you.

72
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,640
How is it?

73
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,530
Very delicious.

74
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,620
You glutton, really.

75
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,850
Who's this girl with?

76
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,700
Brandy's sister.

77
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,680
Isn't Brandy's sister

78
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,640
still in elementary school?

79
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,620
Where did this beautiful little girl

80
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,820
come from?

81
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,530
Blood-related siblings?

82
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,060
Well, why are you looking at me?

83
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,470
I'm talking to you! Can't you hear?

84
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,780
Blood-related.

85
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,030
His blood-related sister.

86
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,260
She's really his blood-related sister.

87
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:15,850
Um...

88
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,460
I swear on my old man,

89
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,490
they're siblings by blood,

90
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,090
and their bond is stronger
than anyone else's.

91
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,970
I heard Guang and his men came here

92
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,280
and caused trouble.

93
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,680
What were they thinking?

94
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,330
I called Xiang to the back

95
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,600
and taught him a lesson.

96
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,970
I did pretty well, huh?

97
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:42,730
No need.

98
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,970
What do you mean, "no need"?

99
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:45,770
Unnecessary.

100
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,290
Crazy Jin works for Wan's Garage?

101
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,460
I was just looking out for our buddy.

102
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,890
Are you eating that trotter?
If not, give it to me.

103
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:56,820
I have more here.

104
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,290
Stop that.

105
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,440
Your hands are all greasy.
Let me wipe them for you.

106
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,910
I can do it myself.

107
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,710
Brandy, are you crazy?

108
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,490
Take your time eating, sister.

109
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,370
Be careful not to choke.

110
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,190
Hurry up and eat.

111
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,090
After eating,
go back to Jin Qiang's place.

112
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,290
I haven't finished my homework yet.

113
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,220
I'll go back to my room to finish it.

114
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,160
Come on, Jiang Mu.

115
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,880
Here's a big coconut for you.

116
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,810
Thank you, Sanlai.

117
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,730
Sanlai.

118
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,990
Where's Jin Zhao?

119
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,530
He's outside.

120
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,570
Is Wan Qing his girlfriend?

121
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,290
Brandy wouldn't be with her.

122
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,740
Why?

123
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,860
She's the daughter

124
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,700
of Wan's Garage's owner.

125
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,230
The daughter of Wan's Garage's owner...

126
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:35,640
So,

127
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,950
not going home again tonight?

128
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,380
Of course not.

129
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,930
I haven't finished my homework yet.

130
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,570
I'll go home after I finish it here.

131
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,450
Besides, the AC at home is still broken.

132
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,450
It's boiling hot.

133
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,600
Your AC is broken.
Then you really shouldn't go back.

134
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,930
It must be insanely hot.

135
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,560
I never said I wasn't going home.

136
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,550
Really?

137
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,580
Alright, I'm not teasing you anymore.

138
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,710
I'll leave you to it.

139
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,990
As I said before,

140
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,410
if you need money, just tell me.

141
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,950
Please don't get yourself into that mess.

142
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,260
You're wading

143
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,650
into deep waters.

144
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,020
Just listen to me on this.

145
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,380
I'd never harm you.

146
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,330
My business is none of your concern.

147
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:27,060
Have I ever bothered with
other people's business?

148
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,320
You're unbelievable.

149
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,660
Jin Zhao, don't push me too far.

150
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,930
And if I do?

151
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,170
Let me put it this way:

152
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,690
you can't get that part you want

153
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,050
anywhere in Manshi.

154
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,200
My father had people buy them all.

155
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,940
Just give in a little,

156
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,500
and I'll help you get one.

157
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,360
How about that?

158
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,360
I don't need your help.

159
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,360
I can handle it myself.

160
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,050
Leave.

161
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,290
Stop coming here all the time.

162
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,140
Suit yourself.

163
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,970
As if I wanted to come here.

164
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,710
What are you doing?

165
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,900
Cleaning the car.

166
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,470
Stay away from here.

167
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,410
Why?

168
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,360
Can't you see there's stuff everywhere?

169
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,030
What could you do here anyway?

170
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,580
Why is she allowed to come here then?

171
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,670
Are you...

172
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,850
throwing a tantrum?

173
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,260
What tantrum?

174
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,480
I'm not throwing any tantrum.

175
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,880
I have a very good temper.

176
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,370
I'm just seeking fairness and justice.

177
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,740
Yes,

178
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,500
you have a great temper.

179
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,100
You're not as even-tempered
as you used to be too!

180
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,230
Look who's talking.

181
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,880
Crazy works for Mr. Wan.

182
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,530
He heard about those guys

183
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,620
who came here the other day
to cause trouble.

184
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,820
He gave Xiang a good beating afterward.

185
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,710
But Jin Zhao changed the subject,

186
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,380
probably because Wan Qing was there.

187
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,400
There's a conflict
between Jin Zhao and Mr. Wan,

188
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,480
and Snakey is Mr. Wan's daughter.

189
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,020
However, her stance is unclear.

374
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,840
Do I have gold in my pocket or something?

375
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,540
Maybe I should put

376
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,400
a coin in my pocket for her to find.

377
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,810
Good idea.

378
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,760
I'm heading back to my shop.

379
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,600
Time to get up.

380
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,060
It's the weekend. No class today.

381
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,410
The ingredients are very fresh today.

382
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:20,860
Yes.

383
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,820
Mu, eat more.

384
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,450
Okay.

385
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:23,790
It's so delicious.

386
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,860
Jiang Mu, don't just eat meat. Here!

387
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,480
Freshly washed vegetables.

388
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,170
Why isn't Master at the table yet?

389
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:30,930
Master, come eat quickly!

390
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,390
-Brandy, come on!
-Hurry!

391
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,900
See if it fits.

392
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,860
This is my master's
most treasured possession.

393
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,620
I thought he was going to wear it
to a class reunion.

394
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,010
I almost put it in the washing machine

395
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,500
with his work clothes.

396
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,380
It looks brand new.

397
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,380
Of course.

398
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,490
Brandy... washed it

399
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:58,170
by hand.

400
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,410
I saw it that day.

401
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,630
No wonder.

402
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,300
That day I saw this uniform

403
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,010
hanging by the door,

404
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,340
and I wanted to try it on.

405
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,010
But your master really chewed me out,

406
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,650
saying my hands were covered in
dog and cat hair,

407
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,100
and wouldn't let me touch it.

408
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,380
So he was saving it for someone.

409
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,300
Thank you, Zhao.

410
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
I can do it myself.

411
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:27,540
But Jiang Mu,

412
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,840
you must treasure this uniform.

413
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,790
Brandy never had the chance to wear it.

414
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,790
There's only one uniform like this.

415
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,900
Here, eat more.

416
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,800
Talk less.

417
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,490
Don't worry, I'll definitely treasure it.

418
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,580
Thank you, Brandy.

419
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,070
Thanks again, Brandy.

420
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,110
Just eat your food.

421
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,650
Right on time.

422
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,030
Mu, you're here.

423
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,590
We can get started now.

424
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,650
You got a uniform?

425
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,140
Who did you borrow

426
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,850
this uniform from?

427
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,460
Jin Zhao. What's wrong?

428
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,650
Your brother was a top student?

429
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,200
Yes, I told you when we first met.

430
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,210
I mean,

431
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,150
he was a top student at our school?

432
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,580
When I was in 11th grade,

433
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,820
I heard that at our school,

434
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,970
winners of city-level competitions
and above

435
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,490
receive not only certificates
and scholarships

436
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,450
but also a special uniform.

437
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,490
The uniform looks
just like our regular one,

438
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:34,970
with no obvious difference.

439
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,450
The only difference is

440
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:37,880
that around the school badge,

441
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,600
there's a gold star.

442
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,880
As far as I know,

443
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,970
only one student has received
the gold star uniform in recent years.

444
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,660
Our homeroom teacher, Mr. Ma,
once mentioned

445
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,840
that the owner of this gold star uniform

446
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,170
was his prized student.

447
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,600
Looks like that person

448
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,820
is your brother, Jin Zhao!

449
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,370
No wonder

450
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,290
Jin Zhao wouldn't let Sanlai try it on

451
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,420
when he asked.

452
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,450
Turns out it's limited edition.

453
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,380
Nana,

454
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,960
since you know the story
of the school badge,

455
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,010
do you know

456
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,140
why Jin Zhao suddenly gave up his studies?

457
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,000
What exactly happened back then?

458
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,690
I don't know.

459
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,300
No one ever talked about it.

460
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,820
I have some problems I can't solve.

461
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,350
Could you help me with them?

462
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,110
Sit down, and let's go through them.

463
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,490
What competition

464
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,650
did you win to get this uniform?

465
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,840
City-wide physics competition trials.

466
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,660
So you were selected?

467
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:51,660
What happened then?

468
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,520
Then nothing.

469
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,400
Then...

470
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,010
Back then...

471
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,240
why didn't you take
the college entrance exam?

472
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,010
I've made notes

473
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,390
on all these problems for you.

474
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:25,410
Take a look.

475
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,350
Ask me if you don't understand.

476
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:39,700
Jiang Mu!

477
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,900
-Sanlai.
-Stop studying.

478
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,500
You're gonna fry your brain.

479
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:45,870
Chocolate flavor.

480
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,510
How did you know I like chocolate flavor?

481
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,620
Brandy told me.

482
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:53,880
Forget about him.

483
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,480
I'll take you somewhere fun.

484
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,070
Where?

485
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,120
Let's go.

486
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,760
I'll show you a magic trick later.

487
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,540
Linda!

488
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,010
She's so adorable.

489
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,860
Linda, why are you being so good today?

490
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:12,970
Come on, come on!

491
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,960
Come on, twirl!

492
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,070
Go play.

493
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:24,340
How did you do that?

494
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,340
It's so adorable!

495
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,880
Linda has been with me for years.

496
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,040
No wonder you're so close.

497
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,720
Jiang Mu.

498
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,540
Are these her puppies?

499
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:38,160
Yes,

500
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:40,530
Xishi just gave birth to these puppies.

501
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,380
Xishi.

502
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,060
Congratulations, Xishi.

503
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,120
What about that one?

504
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,860
Why isn't its mom taking care of it?

505
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,730
Goldie was barely breathing
when he was born,

506
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,210
so Xishi abandoned him at the door.

507
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,470
I went and rescued him.

508
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,980
Poor puppy.

509
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,800
-Come on, Goldie!
-Poor baby.

510
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,910
Come on.

511
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,080
Take a look at him.

512
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:13,120
Little one.

513
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,860
Hello there.

514
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,739
I'll get him something to drink.

515
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:23,920
You're lying down.

516
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,679
He lay down.

517
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,389
He seems to really like you.

518
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,060
Here, you feed him.

519
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,860
Time for some water.

520
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:36,860
Just a little bit.

521
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,489
Slow down, slow down.

522
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:49,340
When I was little, I met

523
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:51,650
a little yellow dog in my neighborhood.

524
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:52,969
It followed me all the way home.

525
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:54,830
But my mom wouldn't let me keep it.

526
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,870
You can't have a dog!

527
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,990
Get rid of it.

528
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,780
Zhao, what should we do about the puppy?

529
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,100
It needs a home.

530
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:12,610
How about...

531
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,930
we hide it?

532
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,490
That works.

533
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:19,820
Let's go.

534
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,540
Okay.

535
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,900
-Puppy.
-Puppy.

536
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:51,930
Little puppy.

537
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,560
Little puppy. Woof, woof.

538
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,800
Where's the puppy?

539
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,690
Zhao, where's the puppy?

540
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:09,750
I don't know.

541
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,130
Did it get lost?

542
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,700
Could it be in danger?

543
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,860
It won't be in danger.

544
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,740
Don't worry.

545
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,000
There it is. Let's go.

546
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,810
Come with me.

547
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,300
Later, Jin Zhao and I

548
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,340
gave that puppy a name.

549
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,780
We called it Lightning.

550
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:28,380
I never saw it again after that.

551
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,740
Would you like to keep him?

552
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,870
I can give him to you.

553
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,570
Forget it.

554
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,810
I don't have a place to keep him now.

555
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,130
You're thirsty again.

556
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,500
Let's go!

557
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,520
Coming!

558
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:57,720
Puppy, I have to leave now.

559
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,490
I'll come see you next time.

560
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,160
If you want to keep him,

Go ask Brandy.

563
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,470
Would that work?

564
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:02,970
You've been staring at me this whole time.

565
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,230
What do you want to say?

566
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,410
I just saw the golden retriever's

567
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,340
puppy at Sanlai's store.

568
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,870
It's so adorable.

00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:18,090
Sanlai said

570
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,260
that the puppy was abandoned

571
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,780
by its mom the moment it was born.

572
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,140
He saved its life.

573
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,740
And it seems...

574
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,590
Xishi doesn't like it very much either.

575

Don't you think that's sad?

576
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,200
He just makes up a story,

577
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,940
and you get all emotional about it.

578
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,930
Why don't you ask Sanlai

579
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,010
how he saved it?

580
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,880
You want to keep it?

581
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,460
Out of his four puppies,

582
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:58,360
two pretty good ones

584

He's giving you one of the two
that won't sell,

585
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:05,200
so you can ask me to keep it at my place.

586
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,470
That way, you'll cover the dog food

587
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,090
and grooming costs for him.

588
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:10,470
Are you stupid?

and keep it at your place temporarily,

592
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,120
would that be okay with you?

593
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,460
And what about later?

594
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,530
When you have to leave in the future,

595
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,180
would you take it with you

596
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,240
or just abandon it?

597
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,400
Since you're going to leave anyway,

598
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,860
I advise you not to keep it.

599
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,990
It'll be harder when you get attached.

That's how you really think, isn't it?

601
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:54,300
Since we decided to
live separately back then,

602
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,230
why bother with more connections?

603
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,820
We're not real siblings,

604
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:02,180
so why bother staying in touch?

You're getting this angry
just because I won't let you keep a dog?

611
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:23,210
Is it really worth it over a puppy?

612

It's not just a puppy.

613

by its father and unloved by its mother!

If Jiang Mu really falls for you,
