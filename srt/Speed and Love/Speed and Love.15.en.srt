I think

259
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,610
she'll believe whatever you say.

260
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,290
Say it exactly as I told you.

261
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,640

267
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,080
Let me taste it.

268
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,360

270
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,300

271
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:08,840
like this?

00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,800
We used to be apart for so long,

274
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,530

275
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,560
But now,

276
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,830
even though I just saw him,

277
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,920
I can't help thinking about him,

278
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,080

280
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,350

281
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,600
Didn't you say you don't know
how to redeem your card game points?

282
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,400
I came to help.

283
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,090
Right.

284
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,990
My phone is out of battery.

285
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,080
It's okay. Let it charge for a while.

286
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:07,940
Just wait here.

287
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,610
You came specifically to see me?

288
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:37,840
What else?

289
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,590
By the way,

290
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,430
what did that real estate agent
want with you?

291
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,520
I'm going to sell the garage.

292
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,440
Sell?

293
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:55,070
You're not going
to run the garage anymore?

294
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,570
I'll run it for now.

295
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,880
Until when?

296
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,670
One month at most.

297
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,360
Are you sure you want to talk about this?

298
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,389
Didn't you say you missed me?

299
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,020
When did I say I missed you?

300
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,440
Then why did you
call my name so many times?

301
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,239
I did not.

302
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,840
Well, I missed you.

303
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,400
Jin Zhao.

304
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,860
Where are you?

305
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,180
Coming.

306
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,350
You can exchange these points
for 5 kg of rice.

307
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:29,980
Impressive, right?

308
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,870
It took me several months,

309
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,100
and they only let me play
five times a day.

310
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,770
First place gets 200 grains.

311
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,430
Mu,

312
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,680
the turtle hasn't been fed today.

313
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,010
Could you feed it for me?

314
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,550
First place gets 200 grains,

315
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,280
second place gets 100,

316
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,090
and third place gets 50.

317
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,630
Only when you save up 10,000 grains,

318
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,840
can you exchange them for 5 kg of rice.

319
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,590
You need rice at home?

320
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,280
This thing sparked my competitiveness.

321
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,970
You're quite persistent.

322
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,020
Let me write down the address.

323
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,920
If they didn't limit me
to five games a day,

324
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,880
I could have redeemed

325
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,280
15 kg.

326
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,390
Or even 20 kg by now.

327
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,110
All done. Just wait for the rice at home.

328
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,510
-All done?
-I'm leaving.

329
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,360
I'm leaving.

330
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,790
Come back for a meal when you have time.

331
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:31,870
I've come up
with some new dishes recently.

332
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,650
You can also try the rice I exchanged.

333
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,600
Sure, when I finish my work.

334
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,230
I'm going, Mu.

335
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,020
I'll earn another 5 kg.

336
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,390
Go to the balcony.

337
