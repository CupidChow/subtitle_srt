It's unbearable.

A bunch of men
were smoking around me tonight.

I can't stand the smell of smoke.

Thank you.

15
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,360
It was from a little boy.

16
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,380
It must be my son.

57

During the first two years
after Jin Zhao's accident,

58
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,780
his condition was terrible.

59
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,640
He often experienced pain
throughout his body.

60
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,630
During the worst episodes,

61
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,800
I had to give him sedatives.

62
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,980
When he wasn't fully conscious,

63
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,340
he kept mumbling,

64
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,470
"Mu...

65

66

I didn't understand at the time.

67
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,480
I thought it was

68
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,180
the English word "Moon."

00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,140

75
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,330
been through all these years?

76
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,000
I was also hired by someone.

77
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,510
Lin Sui brought me back from Canada

78
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,130
to take charge
of Jin Zhao's rehabilitation.

79
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,190
I stayed with him in Chaguo for a year,

80
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,780
which was also when
he was in his worst condition.

81
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,710
You could say

82
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,150
he was on the brink of death.

83
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,150
Later,

84
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,270
when his condition improved a bit,

85
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,110
he insisted on returning
to China, to Nanjing.

86
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,840
Lin Sui and I both disagreed.

87
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,520
Lin Sui talked to him many times.

88
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,830
But he was very determined.

89
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,830
So we discussed it,

90
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,720
and I decided to return to China with him

91
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,040
to live with him

92
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,720
and take care of him.

94

At that time,

95
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,740
his condition was very unstable.

96
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,130
I was on call day and night.

97

If he hadn't worn me out,

98
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,190
I'd probably look much younger,

Didn't you say you wanted to replace
your phone after using it for years?

247
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,810
Since you're often out,

248
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,670
you should use something better.

I need to confirm something.

You're still single, right?

have to do with this?

Of course it does.

260
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,570
I'm a person with principles.

261
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,740
I would never interfere
in someone else's relationship.

262
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,830
So I must confirm.

263
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,150
I thought we were just going for a walk?

264
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,070
What?

265
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,850
What are you planning to do to me here

266
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,790
that involves
interfering in relationships?

267
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,980
You don't seem to have any concerns.

268
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,740
Aren't you worried that
my boyfriend might mind

269
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,200
that you got me a new phone?

270
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,120
If he minds, can't he buy one himself?

271
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,120
His money

272
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,980
is for buying gaming equipment.

273
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,980
Why did you walk off by yourself?

274
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,510
Have you climbed this mountain before?

275
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,500
No.

276
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,200
Isn't the coffee shop very close to here?

277
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,860
Why didn't you come climbing?

278
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,530
No reason.

279
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,230
When did you start liking photography?

280
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,320
What are you photographing?

281
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,760
Try feeling it.

282
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,920
I don't quite feel it.

283
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,500
Capturing nature's soul.

284
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,420
How did I never notice before

285
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,680
that you're so good at talking nonsense?

286
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,780
I noticed it at the coffee shop.

287
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,290
Why do you keep wearing it?

288
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,500

Later,

389
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,780
when his condition improved slightly,

390
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,390
he insisted on returning
to China, to Nanjing.

391
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,150
Lin Sui and I both disagreed.

392
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,260
Lin Sui spent a long time

393
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,790
trying to talk him out of it.

394
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,050
But he was very determined.

395
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,120
Why did he insist on coming back to China?

396
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,180
Why did he buy the old house?

397
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:59,670
You want to meet Jiang Mu?
Are you crazy or am I crazy?

398
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,230
Her mom is sick.

399
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,990
She needs to go to Canada.

400
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,640
I must let her know I'm okay

401
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,520
so she can stay in Canada
with peace of mind

402
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,520
and accompany her mother
for medical treatment.

403
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,830
Brandy,

404
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,550
tell me how you're going to meet her.

405
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,650
Like this?

406
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,710
Like this?

407
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:22,940
How?

408
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,630
Look at your condition.

409
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,360
You'll scare Jiang Mu to death.

410
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,600
Besides, the doctors would never allow it.

411
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,390
Don't worry about the doctors.

412
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,420
Officer Lu will help us with that.

413
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,790
What I need you to do now

414
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,680
is take me to the coffee shop

415
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,520
and then bring Mu over.

416
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,430
Brandy,

417
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,440
let's think this through.

418
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,960
You barely survived.

419
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,260
What if something goes wrong again?

420
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,030
Sanlai,

421
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,550
I've made up my mind.

422
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,180
Brandy!

423
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,460
Are you okay? Get up.

424
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,200
Come on.

425
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:12,830
Let's go.

426
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,880
I'll take you to the hospital.

427
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,180
Looking at her tear-reddened eyes,

428
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,780
I wanted so badly to hold her,

429
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,700
but I couldn't.

430
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,570
I only want her to be happy,

431
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,200
even if that happiness

432
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,830
doesn't include me.

[Jin Zhao]

434
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,440
Jin Zhao's rehabilitation
is very tough.

435
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,840
You need to encourage him more.

436
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,700
Observe his physical reactions.

437
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,850
Pay attention to Jin Zhao's

438
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:13,350
complexion and breathing
for any abnormalities.

439
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,350
If dizziness or severe pain occurs,

440
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,270
stop immediately and contact me.

[Purple Mountain Observatory]

442
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,390
Mu, I'm leaving now.

443
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,740
See you tomorrow.

444
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,020
Nana.

445
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,500
It's Mid-Autumn Festival today.
Let's have dinner together.

446
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,110
Sure.

447
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:05,600
Let's go.

448
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,350
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

449
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,960
My family is all in Canada.

450
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,440
I'm celebrating alone.

451
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,880
I'm sorry,

452
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,720
I can't be with you.

453
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,570
I have something to do during the day.

454
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,159
Is the coffee shop open today?

455
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,070
It's opened till 4 o'clock.

456
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,400
Are you home?

457
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,270
I think I forgot to add vinegar.

458
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,910
It's fine. Having food is good enough.

459
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,140
It smells delicious. Try it quickly.

460
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,710
Really?

461
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:27,660
Look at this roe.

462
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,750
Not bad at all.

463
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:30,390

No, thanks.

467
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,910
I brought you some mooncakes.

468
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:45,910
Where did all these crabs come from?

469
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,940
They were all gifts
from clients to Boss.

470
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,750
But Boss has a cold and fever recently,

471
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:50,980
so can't eat cold-natured food.

472
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,710
That's why we get to enjoy them.

Your boss is sick?

474
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,060
Seems he caught a cold over the weekend

475
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,420
and got sick.

476
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,190
Out to greet guests?

477
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,850
Are you going to pay me?

478
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,070
I can't afford you.

479
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,420

So quick today?

You should go home early for the holiday.

-Thank you, Boss.
-Thank you, Boss.

He said he had something to do
during the day.

488

So that "something"
was actually getting an IV drip.
