I think the answer to your question

What else would I do?

226
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,040
When we were little,

227
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,800
we always stayed up
for New Year's Eve together.

228
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,470
You were afraid I couldn't fall asleep,

229
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,130
so you always told me
many interesting stories.

230
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,670
You haven't told me stories
for a long time.

231
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,470
But every time,

232
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:31,070
you couldn't even stay awake
through one story.

233
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,130
This time I definitely won't fall asleep.

234
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,110
You're not a child anymore.

235
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,110
I'll always be younger than you.

236
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,110
Please?

237
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:07,790
One hour at most.

238
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,930
I fell asleep by accident.

239
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,750
Where are you? I'll come find you.

240
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,640
Don't rush.

241
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,510
Take your time getting ready.

242
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,840
Have something to eat first.

243
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,500
I'll wait for you downstairs.

244
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,550
How long have you been waiting?

245
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,800
I couldn't reach you by phone.

246
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,860
So I just came over.

247
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,910
Why didn't you come up to wake me?

248
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,660
It was still early.

249
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,770
I wanted to let you sleep a bit longer.

250
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,500
Give me the car key.

251
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:50,990
What for?

252
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,280
Give it to me.

253
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,420
Let me remind you,

254
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,360
do you even have a driver's license?

255
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,690
-Can you drive?
-Get in.

256
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,510
It's your New Year's gift.

257
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,680
How do you like it?

258
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,160
Who taught you that?

259
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,840
Sanlai said

260
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,290
drifting is the best way to pick up girls.

261
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,440
I was curious,

262
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,550
so I learned it.

263
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:40,640
You haven't answered me yet.

264
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,840
Do you like it?

265
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,280
I like it.

266
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,640
This is the best gift I've ever received.

267
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,790
Really?

268
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,780
Then I'll go do another drift.

269
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,420
Wait.

270
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,310
Take the passenger seat.

271
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,170
I'll do a drift.

272
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,410
This is my return gift for you.

273
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,270
Brandy!

274
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,310
Sorry.

275
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,910
Sorry, I got stuck in traffic.

276
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:08,470
Sanlai.

277
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,270
I'm late.

278
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,060
What kind of tree is this?

279
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,510
This one?

280
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,470
This is our wishing tree.

281
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,770
We call it Tree God.

282
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,270
It's very powerful.

283
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,790
Ask for wealth, and you'll get it.

284
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,590
When it comes to asking for love,

285
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,190
it's even more effective.

286
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,230
Jiang Mu,

287
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,250
you need to tell your wish
to the Tree God.

288
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,710
Only then can it bless you.

289
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,940
Tree God, Tree God,

290
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,680
I wish everyone safe and healthy

291
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,270
in the new year.

292
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,220
And please bless Zhao and me...

293
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,750
You've been talking
to the Tree God for so long.

294
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,410
You must have many loved ones.

295
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,770
Don't be ridiculous. Just one.

296
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,330
The lion dance is starting over there.

297
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,590
I heard it's a lion dance team from China.

298
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,130
Let's go. The lion dance is starting.

299
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,230
Lion dance? Let's go, come on.

300
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,400
I forgot this is my zodiac year.

301
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,520
I need to get something red.

302
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,270
You go ahead.
I'll meet you at the parking lot.

303
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,110
See you later.

304
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,310
It's starting. It's starting.

305
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,750
Excuse me.

306
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,390
It's too crowded here. What if I get lost?

307
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,640
You did this for...

308
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,830
I didn't mean to.

309
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:48,250
I didn't expect the temple fair here
would be quite lively.

310
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,700
I'll bring you here next time.

311
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:55,330
Brandy?

312
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,690
Let's go.

313
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,030
You're acting like you didn't see us.

314
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,160
Where are you going?

315
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,530
Although we don't work together,

316
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,610
we're not complete strangers, right?

317
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,170
Come on.

318
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,780
Extend your New Year greetings to Mr. Wan.

319
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:21,590
Follow me.

320
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,000
I'm talking to you.

321
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,550
Extend your New Year greetings to Mr. Wan.

322
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,640
Out of the way.

323
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,260
Out of the way?

324
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,150
Are they getting in your way?

325
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,750
I think you

326
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,480
don't want to leave here alive.

327
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,500
What are you doing?

328
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:47,900
Move aside.

329
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,380
You have no manners.

330
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,220
Brandy is senior to all of you.

331
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,560
Is this how you were taught to behave?

332
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,890
Brandy.

333
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,370
I was thinking of gathering
some old friends

334
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,600
on the fourth or fifth days
of the lunar New Year.

335
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,800
We're not that close.

336
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,810
Let's skip the gathering.

337
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,530
We don't have to eat together.

338
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,460
But let's be clear about one thing.

339
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,230
I heard

340
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,570
you're planning to interfere
with the business in Xikouguan.

341
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,230
Quite ambitious, aren't you?

342
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,160
Xikouguan?

343
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,550
Whether I interfere or not
isn't up to you.

344
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,880
It's not up to me either.

345
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,250
We'll see who has what it takes.

346
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,600
You're really something,

347
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,870
climbing the ranks ahead of others

348
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:47,680
and getting so much attention

349
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,270
in such a short time.

350
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:50,710
Aren't you obviously

351
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,470
going against Mr. Wan?

352
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,760
Let me tell you,

353
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,240
don't be naive.

354
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,060
It's not too late to back off now.

355
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,360
Back off?

356
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,920
What does he mean?

357
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,660
You're so confident
that I'm targeting you?

358
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,830
Why would I go after you?

359
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,880
Alright, alright.

360
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,380
What are you doing?
We're all friends here.

361
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,310
You shouldn't have pointed at him.

362
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,780
Brandy, you don't even know.

363
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,690
Just recently,

364
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,440
Qing argued with me for days

365
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,970
because of your situation.

366
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,460
It seems

367
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,720
my daughter has feelings for you.

368
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,380
I know you're a small business owner now.

369
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,390
Whether big or small business,

370
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,150
business thrives on harmony.

371
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,840
Why lose together
when we can win together,

372
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,430
right?

373
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,320
How do we both win?

374
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,470
I like ambitious young people,

375
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,880
but they

376
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,750
fall into 2 categories for me:

377
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,120
insiders and outsiders.

378
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,960
What difference

379
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:53,540
does it make?

380
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,670
Brandy.

381
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,980
How well I treat my daughter

382
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,790
is exactly how well I'll treat
my future son-in-law.

383
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,410
But if someone's an outsider,

384
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,410
I can't control what happens.

385
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:42,480
Can't control it.

386
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:04,560
What era are we in? Arranged marriages?

387
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,160
How outdated can you be?

388
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,160
Who do we have here?

389
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,990
Shouting through a megaphone.

390
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,650
Turns out it's Lai Qide's son.

391
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,230
I was drinking with your father
before the New Year.

392
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,360
He said you haven't been home for ages.

393
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,710
Next time you have dinner with my dad,

394
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,770
could you remind him of something?

395
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,190
To pay back the money.

396
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,280
That's not my business.

397
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,630
I don't want to get involved
in your father-son issues.

398
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,360
But my friendship with your father

399
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,680
goes way back.

400
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,710
Let me tell you,

401
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,730
you'd better not interfere

402
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,780
with my business with Brandy.

403
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,180
You and my dad go way back.

404
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,550
What a coincidence.

405
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,800
Brandy and I are quite acquainted as well.

406
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,660
I'm definitely

407
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,690
getting involved in this matter.

408
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,090
Come down. Come down.

409
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:51,820
My neck hurts looking up at you.

410
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,430
Come down.

411
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:53,770
It's too high here.

412
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,890
I'm afraid to jump.

413
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,360
But if you feel uncomfortable,

414
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,210
you can come up here.

415
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,410
We've arrived at our scenic spot!

416
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,280
Take photos.

417
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,550
Who can take our picture?

418
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,830
Li, of course.

419
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,120
He can do it!

420
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,960
Give me a break.
You know how to take photos?

421
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,640
Get out of here.

422
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,500
Excuse me, we can take your photo!

423
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,930
We're really good at it!

424
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,510
H-He's really good at it.

425
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,200
He can take photos.

426
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,030
I'll join you.

427
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,890
Thank you, young man. Come on.

428
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,740
Dad, forget it.

429
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,870
Alright. Stand still. You look beautiful.

430
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:34,870
Take a nice photo.

431
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,550
Take more pictures.

432
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,750
Make us look younger.

433
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,860
Young man, come down
and take a photo with us!

434
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,400
Coming! Wait for me. Just a second!

435
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,790
They're leaving. They're leaving.

436
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,970
Coming! Coming!

437
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:50,870
Coming!

438
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,230
Come on. Let's do this together.

439
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,640
Come here, handsome.

440
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,470
Let's see how your photos turned out,
handsome.

441
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,730
They turned out great. Let's take a look.

442
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,810
I'll head upstairs first.

443
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,239
What's wrong?

444
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,050
Don't want to leave?

445
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,469
No way.

446
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:24,960
Bye, Sanlai.

447
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,230
Bye.

448
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,360
Don't you think Jiang Mu looks

449
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,630
really pretty dressed like this?

450
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,239
Did you just hold her hand?

451
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,989
I was afraid she'd overthink it.

452
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,040
Afraid she'd overthink it?

453
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:03,150
Do you even know what she was thinking?
And you worry she would overthink?

454
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,980
Thinking is one thing,
but why did you hold her hand?

455
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,110
Did I hold your hand?

456
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,270
Why are you so worked up?

457
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,610
Brandy, Brandy.

458
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,080
Your karma has arrived.

459
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,840
I told you.

460
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,060
You shouldn't...

461
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,280
Well, you shouldn't always reject women.

462
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,720
I'm telling you, if you reject too many,

463
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,840
when someone you really care about

464
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,470
comes along,

465
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,870
your karma will catch up with you,
you know?

466
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,020
Qing.

467
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,050
What are you doing?

468
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:54,710
Get lost.

469
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,240
You want to fight?

470
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:04,350
Fine.

471
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,630
I'm game.

472
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,750
Bear with it.

473
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,040
Does it hurt a lot?

474
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,030
Done.

475
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,570
Let's do the other one.

476
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,870
You can't replace him.

477
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,760
Coming to wish me a happy New Year?

478
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,880
Wan Qing likes you.

479
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:00,060
If you don't like her,
stay the hell away from her.

480
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,520
Your feelings for Snakey
are your business.

481
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,300
Don't drag me into it.

482
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,550
If it weren't for you,

483
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,730
she wouldn't be so heartbroken.

484
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,850
You're pathetic.

485
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:30,640
Enough.

486
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,110
I have someone I need to protect.
