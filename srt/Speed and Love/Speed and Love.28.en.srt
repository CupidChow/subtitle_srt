Something's wrong with you.

00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:55,600
What's wrong?

5
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,479
You're not planning...

6
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,280
to marry Mu, are you?

7
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,370
How did you know?

8
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,020
Everything you bought is for her.

9
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,570
Every single thing.

10
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,760

Tell me.

14

Eggs.

15

Action!

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,480
Can you handle it?

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,920
Beating you is not a problem.

40
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,649
I'm only using 70% of my skills.

41
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,500

You're driving really well.

43
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,550
So about you coming back to drive for me,

44
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,120
have you thought it over?

45
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,450
Just drive carefully.

46
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,500
You're my advisor.

47
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,210
But I'd rather

48
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,640
you come back to drive.

get me a glass of water, okay?

52

You know...

53
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,670
why I don't drive.

54
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,650
Let's not talk about this for now.

That kind of girl is truly rare.

59
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,650
And you're not young anymore.

60
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,520
It's normal to want stability.

61
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,980
But you should also consider what I said.

62
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,810

00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,260
Thank you. You're so thoughtful.

Do you smell it?

82
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,600
Yes.

83
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:51,910
What's that smell?

84
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,190
I don't know.

85
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,470
Wake up.

86
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,880
Sir, the bus...

87
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,500
-Sir!
-The bus is smoking!

00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,430
Sir, the bus is smoking!

89
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,000
No way.

90
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,950
Sir! Stop the bus! Sir!

91
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,380
-Stop the bus!
-The bus is smoking!

92
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,440
Okay, okay. I'm stopping right away.

93
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:32,700
Mu.

94
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,470
Zhao.

95
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:36,950
Where are you?

96
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,350
You didn't get on the bus?

97
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,920
I'm at the convenience store downstairs.

98
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,070
Can you bring me the documents

99
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,040
on the table?

100
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,000
Zhao,

101
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,400
did you hear me?

102
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,310
Wait for me.

103
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,150
I'm glad that you're okay.

104
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,690
Did you...

105
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,210
drive here yourself?

106
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,760
You can drive again?

107
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,240
Slow down.

108
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,670
Ease off the pedal suddenly.

109
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,670
Slow down.

110
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,160
Be careful. Slow down. Slow down.

111
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,470
Be careful.

112
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,190
Very good. Slow down.

113
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,520
Slow down.

114
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,970
All these years,

115
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,160
I thought silence and absence

116
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,470
were protection and sacrifice.

117
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,760
But year after year,

118
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,710
day after day,

119
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,670
in every day of my absence,

120
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,490
you stubbornly waited.

121
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:13,710
Mu.

122
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,120
Thank you for staying with me all along,

123
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,780
helping me understand

124
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,480
that true love
isn't self-righteous sacrifice,

125
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,950
but 2 hearts,

126
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,320
defying wind and rain together,
resisting a broken life.

127
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,160
I understand now.

128
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520
True courage

129
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,970
isn't charging into battle alone.

130
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,030
It's allowing oneself

131
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,240
to become a wound that's tenderly guarded.

132
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,180
Try this.

133
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,400
It's delicious.

134
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,650
Is there any difference...

135
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,880
from what he made?

136
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,160
At that time,

137
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,980
I was still abroad.

138
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,040
The rehabilitation was going well.

139
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,050
I no longer needed a wheelchair

140
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,450
and could manage to walk.

141
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,070
Lin Sui kept asking me

142
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,970
to be his driver in the future.

143
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,000
I understood what he meant.

144
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,260
He was encouraging me in that way.

145
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,310
Given my physical condition at the time,

146
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,840
how could I possibly drive?

147
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,260
And I didn't know
what I could do in the future.

148
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,910
I wondered what you

149
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,790
would want me to do.

150
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,990
You'd probably want me to study.

151
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,920
When I got tired from studying,

152
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,240
I would read the letters you wrote to me.

153
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,120
Those letters

154
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,790
gave me faith.

155
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,890
Kid, come and eat!

156
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,000
Noodles are here.

157
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:36,820
Chopsticks.

158
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,950
Wait.

159
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,580
Chopped scallions

160
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,830
are the soul of this bowl of noodles.

161
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,280
How's your studying going?

162
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:58,730
Not bad.

163
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,360
Don't overwork yourself.

164
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,310
Your body needs more rest now.

165
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,730
Have you been in touch with Mu lately?

166
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,370
When Mu was little,

167
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,830
she loved it most
when I cooked noodles for her.

168
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,240
When you get the chance in the future,

169
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
help me cook a bowl of noodles for Mu.

170
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,000
I hope

171
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,160
she can remember the taste
of this bowl of noodles.

172
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,640
Got it.

173
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,660
I've quit drinking.

174
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,560
I've quit drinking.

175
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:13,890
Why?

176
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,510
I can't handle it anymore.

177
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,119
I'm tired.

178
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,300
I need to take good care
of your sister, Jin Xin.

179
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,030
I can't

180
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,070
make the same mistake again.

181
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,310
Eat.

182
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,880
How does it taste?

183
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,610
Pretty good.

184
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,800
Good. Eat more.

185
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,760
Maybe it's because he's old.

186
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,320
He's a bit...

187
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,510
sentimental now.

188
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,510
He's realized that he wasn't there for you

189
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,340
during some important moments
in your life.

190
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,950
And he regrets it.

191
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,080
He wants to make it up to you,

192
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,280
even if it's just cooking you a good meal

193
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,300
or a bowl of Yangchun noodles.

194
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,030
He wants you to know

195
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,890
that his love for you...

196
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,320
isn't fake.

197
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,120
He just lost himself before.

198
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,270
Actually,

199
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,880
he could have told me all this
over the phone.

200
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,280
I understand him on this.

201
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,190
Men sometimes

202
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,000
aren't very good at saying mushy things...

203
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,190
face to face.

204
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,420
I stopped resenting him long ago.

205
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,270
I only remember...

206
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,130
that he loved racing.

207
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,880
When I was little,

208
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,670
he always took me out to play with cars
behind Mom's back.

209
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,640
Without cars,

210
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,690
it was like he lost his soul.

211
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,120
I won't be like that.

212
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,670
Racing...

213
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,400
isn't my dream.

214
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,560
Then what is your dream?

215
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,230

Are you tired?

337
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,020
I told you

338
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,260
to send me a message,

339
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,360
so I could ask Chris
to pick you up at the airport.

340
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,670
No need to trouble him. We took a taxi.

341
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,770
Mom,

342
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,510
Zhao is back too.

343
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,470
Look,

344
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,640
I'm preparing

345
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,920
dinner for tonight.

346
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,600
Take your luggage to the room
and rest a bit.

347
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,690
Dinner will be ready soon.

348
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,160
Here, Mu,

349
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,250
have some shrimps.

350
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,080
Mu, you know what?

351
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,880
Chris is worried and curious

352
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,160
about your work.

353
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,400
Worried?

354
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,050
Worried about what?

355
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,880
In your last call,

356
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,880
you said the sun was going to explode

357
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,280
and we'd all turn to dust.

358
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,360
He was so scared
that he couldn't sleep well for a week.

359
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,320
Right?

360
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,670
That was just an astrophysics documentary.

361
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,640
Before that, there is another line:

362
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,570
"It will take about 6 billion years

363
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,440
before the sun might explode."

364
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,120
The life cycle of celestial bodies

365
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,180
is closely related to life and death.

366
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,430
Think about it.

367
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,920
If there's an atom in your body

368
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,230
that was once born, grew, and decayed

369
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,670
in the distant cosmos,

370
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,720
how romantic would that be?

371
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,710
It does sound romantic.

372
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,800
But why did I find it terrifying
last time?

373
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,950
It's not terrifying.

374
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,750
It's that you're a scaredy-cat.

375
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,190
If Earth is going to explode,

376
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,850
shouldn't we be a bit nervous?

377
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,640
Honey,

378
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,050
I think you've always been very calm.

379
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,400
You must have known
it'll take 6 billion years, right?

380
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,400
Yes, yes.

381
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,270
After Mu mentioned it last time,

382
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,350
I immediately watched that documentary.

383
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,750
I even watched it 3 times.

384
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,720
Actually,
you were just worrying unnecessarily.

385
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:28,950
Stupid.

386
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,320
What? Annoying?

387
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,360
Well, Honey,

388
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,560
did I upset you again?

389
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,400
Zhao,

390
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,770
you watched that documentary too.

391
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,030
Cosmic Wonders.

392
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,600
There's a red nebula in it.

393
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,400
The visuals are very beautiful.

394
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,710
Such a big dumpling—

395
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,240
I bet it can shut your mouth.

396
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,180
You've all watched it?

397
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,320
So I've been alone?

398
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,360
You mean "isolated", right?

399
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,270
Not "alone".

400
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,210
Fine.

401
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,160
Mu,

402
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,930
how's your current place?

403
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,890
I terminated the lease.

404
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:26,920
What?

405
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,820
You terminated the lease?

406
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,840
Where do you live now?

407
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,400
Mu is staying at my place now.

408
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,430
I don't think it'll take

409
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,880
6 billion years for Earth to explode.

410
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,470
Mu, don't you think so?

411
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:19,510
Also,

412
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,310
next time you watch a movie,

413
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,590
take me with you, okay?

414
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,890
Jin Zhao,
this is your first time in Canada,

415
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:49,290
right?

416
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,160
Yes, Uncle.

417
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,600
Since you're here, make yourself at home.

418
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:54,400
Relax.

419
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,880
In the morning, you can get up early.

420
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,190
The air is especially fresh.

421
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,320
You might see some small animals,

422
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,230
like beavers and red foxes.

423
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,470
-They are not afraid of humans.
-Chris.

424
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,920
I told you to help me tidy the guest room.

425
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,950
Is it ready?

426
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:10,470
It's ready.

427
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,190
Okay.

428
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:01,920
Jin Zhao,

429
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:03,990
you're still up?

430
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,489
I don't have any elders around to ask,

431
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:30,880
so I asked my colleagues
about the customs...

432
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,280
for proposing marriage.

433
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:41,489
I'm not sure if I've missed anything
or done anything improperly.

434
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,840
I'm not someone

435
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,970
who can fully meet your expectations,

436
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,040
but Mu has always been

437
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,240
the person I cherish most,

438
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,790
whether as a younger sister in the past

439
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,320
or as a beloved partner from now on.

440
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,360
I came this time

441
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,150
to tell you in person...

442
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,110
that from now on,

443
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,300
no matter what circumstances I face,

444
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:57,130
I will take good care of Mu

445
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,170
and never let her suffer.

446
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,130
Please...

447
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,420
entrust her to me.

448
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,110
Mom.

449
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,800
You two had a long journey today.

450
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:58,770
Rest early.

451
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,510
Jin Zhao,

452
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,320
some things can't be rushed.

453
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,380
Take it slow.

454
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,880
And give her some time.
