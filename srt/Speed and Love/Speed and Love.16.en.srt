Help me put it on.

49
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,430
The two fish you caught today
are really plump.

50
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,510
Do you think they weigh
at least 6 to 7 jin?

51
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,470
I've never failed at fishing.

52
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,600

Mu, you're home?

55
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,740
What happened to the kitchen?

56
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,590
Mom, I want ice cream.

57
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,020
There's some in the fridge. Help yourself.

58
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,110
Mom, where's my tablet?

59
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,510
Isn't it in your sister's room?

60
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,640
Go get it from there.

61
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,860
Wait, don't go.

62
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,360
She's asleep.

63
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,270
You hide inside.
I'll go out and handle this.

64
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,910
Why should I hide?

65
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,880
This is my house.

66
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,780
What if they find out

67
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,150
that we're in a room with the lights off?

68
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,410
It wouldn't look good.

69
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,240
Neither of us needs to hide.

70
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,380
You're acting guilty for no reason.

71
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,070
You're not nervous?

72
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,830
Not at all.

73
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,060
How...

74
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:36,950
do you manage that?

75
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,610
How am I supposed to prove it to you?

76
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,110
Are you thinking of
something inappropriate?

77
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,140
Who thought that way first?

78
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:47,700
You did.

79
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,720
Mom, Sister is still awake.

80
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,070
Mu.

81
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,890
You're not yet asleep?

82
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,800
If you aren't, your sister will be
heading in to get her tablet.

83
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:03,900
Go ahead.

84
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:13,710
Brother?

85
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,800
Your tablet.

86
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,440
Did you receive the rice?

87
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,070
Yes, we'll try it tonight.

88
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,720
Zhao, stay for dinner tonight.

89
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,560
Jin Qiang caught two big fish.

90
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,330
Sure, let me cook a dish or two.

91
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,330
Forget it.

92
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,290
With your cooking skills,

93
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,030
you are going to ruin my fish.

94
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,220
I'll cook it myself.

95
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,480
Then be quick about it.

96
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,670
Jiang Mu is in for a treat.

97
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,180
Fishing?

98
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,860
Eating fish.

99
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,460
Jin Qiang caught two big fish.

100
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,130
Mu.

101
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,510
What's wrong?

102
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,350
Are you feeling warm?

103
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,390
What...

104
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,360
What's with your face?

105
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,900
It looks a bit flushed.

106
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,860
What were you two doing in the room?

107
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,950
The light kept turning on and off.

108
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,740
The switch isn't working properly.

109
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,000
I was helping to fix it.

110
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,980
Nothing works properly in this house.

111
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,710
There's always one thing or another
that is broken.

112
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,270
Don't worry. Queue up.

113
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,250
I'll fix everything one by one.

114
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,450
You're first in line.

115
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,700
First, quit drinking.

116
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,630
I would be completely broken if so.

117
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,260
What are you laughing at?

118
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,220
Mrs. Zhao is funny.

119
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,299
Try this fish. See if it's good.

120
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:38,150
How is it?

121
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:42,760
This is the best fish
I've ever had in my life.

122
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,430
Then have some more.

123
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,660
How old are you now

124
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,960
to be talking about a lifetime?

125
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,420
Well then, can you cook as well?

126
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,110
Yes, I can.

127
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,460
Could yours be as good as Dad's?

128
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,360
I can try it someday.

129
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,330
He doesn't stand a chance.

130
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,640
Thank you, Dad.

131
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,290
This is nice.

132
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,500
It's been so long since our family

133
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,150
has gotten together like this

134
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,820
to enjoy a good meal. Come on.

135
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,320
Let's eat together more often from now on.

136
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,530
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

137
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,220
Before Mu arrived,

138
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,700
we hardly ever saw Zhao around.

139
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,150
But since Mu came,

140
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,780
we've been seeing Zhao

141
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,180
more and more often, haven't we?

142
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,880
These two are inseparable.

143
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,140
They've been like that
since they were little.

144
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,070
That was when they were very young.

145
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,080
These two are all grown up now.

146
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,290
Things must be different from
when they were children.

147
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,280
Sister Mu must really like
Brother Jin Zhao, right?

148
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,970
Your sister is asking you a question.

149
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,820
What?

150
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,480
You like Brother Jin Zhao a lot, right?

151
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,750
W-why are you asking that?

152
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,030
Because you cried that one time
when you couldn't find

153
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,030
Brother Jin Zhao.

154
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,760
Really? When did that happen?

155
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,270
Mu.

156
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,500
How old are you now?

157
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,830
Were you really crying?

158
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,190
No, I was crying because...

159
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,870
Because...

160
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,320
Because I saw some letters.

161
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,090
What letters?

162
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,700
Some letters...

163
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,520
which were hidden behind
the archery target.

164
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:01,550
Brother, let's go to the beach tomorrow.

165
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:03,750
Sure.

166
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,700
Zhao.

167
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:06,950
Zhao?

168
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,200
Do you have time?

169
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,340
Yes, I do.

170
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,000
That's great!

171
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,630
It's been so long since
we went out together.

172
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,630
Great! Come on.

173
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,210
Let's have another drink.

174
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,070
What happened there?

175
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,840
The floor is cold.
Let me pick it up for you.

176
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,080
You did that on purpose.

177
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:38,870
Yes,

178
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,340
I did it on purpose.

179
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,590
-This yacht is so big!
-How beautiful!

180
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,700
The scenery is gorgeous!

181
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,300
It's been so long since
we've been on a holiday.

182
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,490
Today, let's all relax

183
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,620
and have a good time!

184
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,350
The sea...

185
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,540
is so vast!

186
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,100
How annoying.

187
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,180
-I want a photo too.
-Today,

188
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,780
let's all unwind and relax.

189
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,290
Xin, come take photos with us.

190
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:34,990
Today...

191
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,400
-How is it?
-You have been working hard.

192
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,940
We finally have a chance to relax today.

193
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,030
If we are relaxing, why can't you
let me have a drink?

194
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:40,890
Just wait a bit.

195
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,940
If you want to drink,

196
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,870
I'll drink with you tonight, okay?

197
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,570
You little rascal.

198
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,470
There must be a bar on this yacht, right?

199
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,000
No, don't you dare tell him.

200
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,540
I already said
I'll drink with you tonight.

201
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,890
I'll tell you later.

202
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,060
-Let's take a photo first.
-Dad!

203
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,060
I want to eat fish.

204
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,780
Dad will catch some for you.

205
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,580
That's right!

206
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,990
Let's go fishing.

207
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,940
As long as you aren't drinking,

208
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,500
-I want to go fishing too.
-we can do anything.

209
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,700
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

210
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,180
Why can't I catch even one fish?

211
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,340
My fishing rod is broken too.

212
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,240
I've got one! I've got one!

213
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,750
Another fish!

214
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,350
Here comes another one.

215
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,990
That's amazing!

216
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,580
Help me hold this.

217
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,460
Be careful!

218
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,910
Why haven't I caught a single fish?

219
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,420
Honey, you could change careers.

220
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,390
Don't be a chef,

221
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,460
but become a fisherman instead.

222
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,940
How's it going over there?

223
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,820
Any signs?

224
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,550
I can't even feel a single fish.

225
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,700
Zhao.

226
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,310
Auntie Zhao owes you an apology.

227
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,510
You've been living away from us
for so long,

228
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,170
and I haven't shown you
enough care and concern.

229
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,330
Do you have a girlfriend?

230
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,460
Tell me all about it.

231
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,420
Our Zhao is so handsome.

232
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,680
There must be many girls who like you.

233
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,840
There aren't.

234
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,350
What's Wan Shengbang's daughter name?

235
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,480
Her name is Wan Qing,

236
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:05,910
Snakey.

237
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,110
Mu, why do you know so much?

238
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,920
What's that girl like?

239
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,780
She's great.

240
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,640
She's very hot.

241
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,580
What do you mean by "hot"?

242
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,680
Her looks, personality, and figure

243
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,540
are all pretty hot.

244
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,510
Really?

245
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,510
Zhao,

246
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,540
do you like this kind of girl?

247
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,460
No, I don't.

248
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,630
How gossipy.

249
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,270
Well, I am just trying to have a chat

250
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,150
as the wait for fish seems pretty long.

251
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,910
Yeah, we haven't caught anything in hours.

252
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,040
Let's stop fishing.

253
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,440
By the way,
there's a home theatre on the yacht,

254
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,050
and a karaoke room too.

255
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:46,990
Come on, let's stop fishing.

256
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:47,820
Let's go sing.

257
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,630
Zhao.

258
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,690
I'm not going.

259
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,350
I'm tired from driving earlier.

260
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,470
I want to take a nap.

261
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,110
I'm not going either.

262
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,770
I want to look around the boat.

263
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,710
I'll go with you.

264
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,060
I just remembered

265
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,660
I have a conference call with Nana

266
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,460
to discuss the venue
for our next charity performance.

267
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,150
Okay.

268
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:08,870
Honey,

269
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,950
let's go sing instead of fishing.

270
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,990
Give me back my flask

271
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,120
and I'll go with you.

272
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,080
Keep fishing then.

273
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,400
Come on, Xin.

274
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,400
Shall we go sing together?

275
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:18,990
Sure!

276
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,160
Finished with your call?

277
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,960
You're up from your nap.

278
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,420
Do you want to go for a swim?

279
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,670
Do you really like Wan Qing's body type?

280
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,460
If you want to swim,

281
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,540
I can join you.

282
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,180
How do you know I can swim?

283
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,060
If you can't swim,

284
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,550
you can hold onto me.

285
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,890
That's a pity.

286
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,810
I'm actually a great swimmer.

287
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,150
Then let's...

288
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,610
do something else.

289
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,390
No, no. The scenery here isn't nice.

290
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,520
Let's go over there!

291
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,760
Quick, hide!

292
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:31,940
Come on!

293
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,400
Good, right here.

294
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:34,940
The view is nice here.

295
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,780
Alright, let's take a photo.

296
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,060
Perfect!

297
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:39,780
Let's take a couple more over there.

298
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,910
Let's go this way!

299
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,300
This spot is good.

300
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,520
What's that noise?

301
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,750
Nothing, it's just a big fish.

302
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,660
Mu!

303
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,030
Sister?

304
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,680
What are you doing here?

305
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,580
Well, it was stuffy in the room

306
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,530
so I came out to get some fresh air.

307
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,280
All by yourself?

308
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,940
Don't worry, I won't go into the water.

309
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,920
Swim back quickly!

310
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:13,910
Hurry up!

311
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,400
Sister, here you go.

312
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,420
One is enough.

313
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,910
No, you need two.

314
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,500
You scared me!
Why did you jump into the sea?

315
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,360
Your nerves are just incredible.

316
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:54,970
I didn't expect you could keep your cool
under pressure like that.

317
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,290
Are you cold?

318
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,740
This is ice cream Jin Xin gave me.

319
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:02,800
She left two,

320
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,310
which means one is for me.

321
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,790
How do you know that?

322
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,840
That kid knows everything.

323
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,700
You're not even blood-related,

324
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,270
yet you understand her so well.

325
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,800
Are you two blood-related then?

326
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,240
Am I the same as her, Brother Jin Zhao?

327
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,170
You already know the answer.

328
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,940
I'm dirty.

329
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,170
I don't mind you dirty.

330
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,350
Let me see

331
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,390
where you are dirty.

332
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,320
Brandy! This shampoo is really...

333
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,260
Don't move.

334
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,300
One, two, three!

335
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,740
Jiang Mu, what are you doing?

336
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,100
He has a strand of white hair

337
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,870
and I was helping him pull it out.

338
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:21,830
White hair?

339
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,870
Oh my god!

340
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,500
The former campus heartthrob
is aging prematurely.

341
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,830
Where's the white hair?

342
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,100
I threw it on the floor,
so you can't see it now.

343
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,300
It's been pulled out?

344
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,420
What brings you here?

345
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,590
This shampoo works really well for Xishi.

346
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,050
I brought it for you to try.

347
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:45,900
Leave the stuff here.

348
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,700
You can go now.

349
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:48,620
Bye.

350
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:49,660
Bye bye.

351
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,940
He scared me.

352
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,110
Brandy! Actually, I think...

353
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,110
Scram.

354
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,840
I really think it's not bad.

355
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,410
Ji, are you done over there?

356
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,650
Just a bit more.

357
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,650
Wait for me inside.

358
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,610
Let's take a break.

359
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,700
It's fine, Master. I'm not tired.

360
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,220
I'll finish fixing this car.

361
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,420
Let's do it tomorrow.

362
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,730
Go out and stretch your legs.

363
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,550
It's okay. This is the last one.

364
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,430
We'll be done once I help him
finish this up.

365
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,590
Yang.

366
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,680
Go out and buy me a bottle of water.

367
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,050
I just bought water this morning.

368
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:56,910
You can have it.

369
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,730
It's brand new with the seal intact.

370
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:01,790
Go ahead and drink it.

371
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,390
It's really unopened. Look.

372
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,850
I... I don't want water.

373
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,710
Go buy me some coconut water.

374
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,070
Make it cold.

375
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,390
Didn't you used to
not drink coconut water?

376
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,460
I suddenly have
a craving for coconut water.

377
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,550
And it has to be cold?

378
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,680
Yes, it must be cold.

379
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,040
Ji.

380
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,660
Go to the hardware store on West Street.

381
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,220
Please buy some parts for me.

382
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,510
I'll send you the model numbers later.

383
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,070
But...

384
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,050
Don't we have spares in the shop?

385
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,690
I want new ones.

386
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,700
Alright.

387
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:32,970
Master, lend me your keys.

388
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:33,830
I'll go by bike.

389
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,240
Why do you need keys for?

390
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,900
Let the bike rest. Go on foot.

391
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,110
-Why does the bike need rest?
-Come on.

392
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:39,790
Take this money.

393
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,740
Get something to eat on the way.

394
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,310
Make sure you eat enough.

395
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,840
-Go on.
-Why are you so rich?

396
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,390
Okay.

397
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,270
Don't you want anything to eat?

398
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:44,940
I'm not eating!

399
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,550
Okay.

400
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,110
Are they all gone?

401
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,150
I sent them all away.

402
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,180
Are you sure?

403
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,180
Yes.

404
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,310
Wait.

405
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,410
Why is it here?

406
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,200
Are you afraid it will tell others?

407
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,560
Dogs are very smart these days.

408
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,150
Are we good now?

409
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,300
Focus.

410
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,130
Are you sure?

411
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,700
Nana said

412
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,500
there's a meteor shower tonight.

413
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,630
We definitely can't miss it this time.

414
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,460
Then don't you

415
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,990
fall asleep again tonight.

416
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,860
If you do, I won't wake you up.

417
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:32,550
Don't worry.

418
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,150
Today, I drank your
special blend of coffee.

419
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,950
I definitely won't fall asleep.

420
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,070
But if I do fall asleep,

421
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,320
you have to remember to wake me up.

422
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:48,790
Got it.

423
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,030
You brought strawberries too.

424
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,410

-Mu!
-Have some water.

513
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,960
You danced so well!

514
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,840
You truly are my

center-position goddess.

516
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,790
I was so worried.
Thank goodness nothing went wrong.

517
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,990
Not just no mistakes,

518
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,870
it was absolutely perfect.

519
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,400
Why did you invite

520
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,220
your classmates to cheer
while we were dancing?

521
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,480
It was kind of awkward.

522
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,020
This is your debut stage in Manshi.

523
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,590
Everything has to be perfect.

524
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,000
Thank you, Nana.

525
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,210
Are you hungry?

526
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,420
Let me take you out for a bite.

527
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:12,830
Okay.

528
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:13,400
Let's go.

529
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,500
And forget about him?

530
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,420
It's fine. He can wait.

531
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,020
Where are you going, Mu?

532
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,070
Mu, I'll take you to that place

533
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,380
with the super delicious coconut cake.

534
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,550
Is it very sweet?

535
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,150
No.

536
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,220
It's just very fragrant and crispy.

537
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,460
-Hello.
-Hello.

538
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:28,740
Two portions, please.

539
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,940
Two portions. Got it.

540
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,290
Please add more coconut flakes.

541
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,900
There are so many delicious things here.

542
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,560
There's so many.
I'll take you to try more later.

543
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,090
Please add a bit more for me.

544
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:39,790
Come on, bottom's up.

545
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,990
Come on, bottom's up.

546
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,390
Let's have fun!

547
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,720
Yiwen booked a room at OPPS.

548
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,020
Let's go there and have fun later.

549
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,250
You should have told me earlier.

550
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,770
I shouldn't be drinking so much tonight.

551
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,980
Wouldn't that affect my performance?

552
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,790
Why bother?

553
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,380
Here.

554
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,590
Being good-looking has its advantages.

555
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,180
Don't you two have someone behind you too?

556
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,650
You even have someone looking out for you
when you are out.

557
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,720
W-We can't compare to you.

558
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,600
Come on, let's hang out together.

559
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,500
