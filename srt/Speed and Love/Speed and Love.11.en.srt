Who says I can't be a good wife?

23
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:50,490
Not likely.

24
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,760
Why not likely?

25
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,440
Gentle,

26
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:55,760
cute,

virtuous,

This person you're describing—

30
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,350
do I know her?

31
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,720
Even prone to violence.

32
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,230
Don't go causing trouble for other people.

33
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,579
I won't cause trouble for others.

34
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,440
I'll only cause trouble for you.

35
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,500
Are you really not going to sleep?

36
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,190
I do need to sleep.

37
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,830
I heard the New Year atmosphere
is quite strong here.

38
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,150
I'm planning to go walk around
the streets tomorrow.

39
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,280
Want to come with me?

40
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,370
We'll talk about it after you wake up.

41
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,790
I can't wake up on my own.

42
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,800
You'll have to wake me up.

43
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,480
Jin Zhao.

44
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,840
Can you tell me about things

45
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,790
from when we were little?

46
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,720
I've forgotten a lot of it already.

47
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,080
What do you want to hear?

48
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,480
I want to know

49
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,670
why Mom and Dad

50
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,440
got divorced.

51
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,550
I know they were always arguing,

52
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,640
but what exactly

53
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,840
caused the divorce in the end?

54
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,280
Because of a few potted plants, I think.

55
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,500
Potted plants?

56
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,940
Jin Qiang broke a few of

57
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,750
Jiang Yinghan's favorite potted plants.

58
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,670
Jin Qiang!

59
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,380
-Love to keep them, huh?
-No!

60
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,920
The house is so small,

61
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,280
and you're cluttering it with
all this useless stuff!

62
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,750
Remember:

63
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,190
as a man, you should be responsible.

64
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,070
When faced with problems and difficulties,

65
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,330
you need to solve them,

66
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,480
not avoid or run away

67
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,870
from them,

68
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,060
because that's the ultimate sign
of cowardice.

69
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,870
Got it.

70
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,850
And what happened next?

71
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,040
Didn't Dad buy Mom new ones?

72
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,790
No.

73
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,480
Jin Qiang thought
they were just some potted plants,

74
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,580
not a big deal.

75
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,350
But Jiang Yinghan felt

76
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,410
they were the most important things.

77
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,390
She never got an apology from Jin Qiang,

78
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,430
so she was very angry.

79
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,080
So they got divorced over that?

80
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,310
After a woman and a man

81
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,040
go through testing each other,

82
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,840
friction,

83
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,670
adjustment,

84
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,810
and all kinds of hardships
before finally coming together,

85
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,960
yet they can divorce over

86
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,070
just a few potted plants.

87
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,810
Does that mean marriage itself

88
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,310
is inherently unhappy?

89
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,960
There's no such thing as
an unhappy marriage,

90
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,640
but there are indeed unhappy couples.

91
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:41,230
It's not marriage
that brings disaster upon them—

92
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,400
it's that they themselves
are not steadfast enough.

93
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,710
As long as two people truly
love each other,

94
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,770
they can overcome all difficulties.

95
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,430
Where there's a will, there's a way.

96
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,190
Zhao.

97
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,400
I think

98
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,720
you'll definitely be
a good husband in the future.

99
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,160
Whether I'm a good husband or not

100
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,660
is for my wife to judge.

101
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,120
So when do you

102
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,160
plan to get married?

103
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,760
I've never thought about it.

104
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,040
I remember...

105
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,070
I remember one time

106
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,730
when I was at home,

107
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,670
I saw Mom and Dad

108
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,310
arguing for some reason.

109
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,260
I was really scared and hid under the bed,

110
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,070
but you just kept doing your homework.

111
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,240
I was so mad.

112
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,430
When was that?

113
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,210
When I was in second grade
and you were in junior high.

114
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,960
And then?

115
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,240
Then...

116
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,400
Then

117
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,040
I started reading a storybook
under the bed

118
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,770
and accidentally fell asleep.

119
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,050
After I woke up,
I didn't tell you about it

120
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,920
because I was worried
you'd find out and scold me.

121
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,890
Scold you for what?

122
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,630
What else could it be?

123
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,310
Wouldn't be anything nice,
that's for sure.

124
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,120
You'd definitely think
I was too naughty

125
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,580
and that it was dangerous.

126
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,490
Truly precocious for your age.

127
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,760
I told you, I'm not little anymore.

128
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,160
Yeah,

129
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:52,790
funny how someone just said

130
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,450
they were little a moment ago.

131
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,830
Anyway, in my eyes,

132
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,000
you're like Sun Wukong's disciple—

133
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,950
sometimes big, sometimes small.

134
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,080
Where are you going?

135
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm not leaving.

136
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,970
I didn't expect my mind
would be completely filled with her.

137
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,920
I had imagined countless times

138
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,190
what she would look like when she grew up—

139
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,530
every version still carrying

140
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,660
a trace of cuteness and childishness.

141
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,260
Yet I never once imagined

142
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,240
that she, who in my memories

143
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,190
was always a child,

144
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,170

The other day, there was a Panamera
parked outside your building.

222
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,640
That license plate

223
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,870
looked really familiar.

224
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,190
Familiar?

225
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,430
Are you sure you didn't see it wrong?

226
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,040
The circle's not that big,

227
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,020
and that car is easy to recognize.

228
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,880
What,

229
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,000
so you've changed

230
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,760
your type?

231
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,730
Are you into married women now?

232
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,640
You didn't bring this up two days ago—

233
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,970
why mention it only now?

234
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,790
Just tell me what you're
trying to pull this time.

235
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,750
The stuff you filmed last time—

236
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,240
when do you plan

237
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,270
to send it over?

238
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,850
You're acting like

239
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,920
a mistress deliberately trying to
get caught by the wife.

240
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,400
I'm just bored,

241
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,530
waiting for the wife to come out
so I can PK her.

242
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,520
Fine.

243
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,640
I've sent it over as you requested.

244
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,010
Forget about the Panamera, alright?

245
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:14,880
What's the rush?

246
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,710
You've got nothing better to do?

247
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,770
This was just made.

248
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,120
Tastes good. Try some.

249
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,710
Put it away.

250
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,730
Just looking at the cream
makes me feel sick.

251
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,240
Are you mad?

252
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,670
Stay away from her.

253
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,470
What I'm interested in

254
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,640
has never been her.

255
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,240
Then what do you want?

256
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,310
You hate cream—

257
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,000
so what do you like to eat?

258
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,710
I like seafood.

259
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,380
Want to go have a fight in the sea?

260
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,520
But someone could get killed.

261
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,520
Aren't you pretty good at fighting?

262
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,790
But I can't swim.

263
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,640
Then stay away from her.

264
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,610
If you ever get near her again,

265
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,070
I'll kick you into the sea.

266
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,400
Don't rush.

267
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,710
I have something for you.

268
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,400
I specially asked someone
to bring it back from Japan.

269
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:43,830
Hold on.

270
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:44,630
Don't bother.

271
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:45,790
I don't need it.

272
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,270
Let's have a race.

273
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,850
Not interested.

274
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,530
I heard that Jiang Mu

275
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,150
will perform at a charity show

276
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,190
with Nana tonight.

277
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,230
Let's make the entertainment center
the finishing line.

278
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,160
Whoever gets there first
celebrates with her;

279
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,800
and whoever arrives later

280
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,400
stays out of her life and never shows up
in front of her again.

281
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,530
How does that sound?

282
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,710
She's a very interesting girl.

283
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,430
You like her?

284
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,550
Get in the car.

285
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,880
Put on your earphones and don't hang up.

286
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,090
Any other rules?
Say them all at once.

287
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,360
No, that's all.

288
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,510
Want me to wait for you?

289
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:29,640
No need.

290
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,090
You go first.

291
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,880
The red light lasts for tens of seconds.

292
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,680
If I don't wait for you,
it feels like an unfair win.

293
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:36,910
Only if you beat me

294
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,320
will you have a chance to talk about
whether it's fair or not.

295
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,190
Anyway,

296
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,030
your driving skills are quite good.

297
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,840
Just average.

298
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,750
I'm just driving for fun.

299
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,670
You're better with words.

300
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,720
Don't you understand sarcasm?

301
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,600
So if I win,

302
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,270
you'll accept defeat nicely, right?

303
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,330
Three minutes ago,

304
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,990
you had the chance to state the rules.

305
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,320
Your start was faster than I expected.

306
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,600
You have even more OEM parts
than I thought.

307
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,730
It could be lighter.

308
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,950
Then how would you
deal with the counterweight?

309
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,030
I don't work for you.

310
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,600
I can pay you.

311
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,060
But I don't sell.

312
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,640
My HP is 500. What about you?

313
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,270
600.

314
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,270
A Wankel engine

315
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,160
can reach up to 650 HP.

316
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,230
If you had increased
your turbo boost a bit,

317
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,460
overtaking just now would've been easier.

318
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,430
The factory setting is 0.5,

319
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,430
and now it's 0.8.

320
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,270
It could be increased to 1.0.

321
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,500
It's enough as it is.

322
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,690
Are those your people?

323
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,170
Have you played Klotski?

324
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,490
A game for 3-year-olds.

325
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,470
Your Wankel engine has more HP

326
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,370
and your car is lighter.

327
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,920
If we're talking pure performance,
I'm bound to lose.

328
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,920
I'm just racing with a twin-rotor engine
at top speed.

329
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,120
Why are you so fixated on rotors?

330
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,920
Guess why I won't buy your parts?

331
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,190
They're not available in Manshi,
and you won't take imports either.

332
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:53,920
Don't tell me

333
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,030
you're going to hand-make one by yourself.

334
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,890
That's exactly what I had in mind.

335
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,840
Then I'll wait and see.

336
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,640
Your brakes are very responsive.

337
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,610
Did you modify them yourself?

338
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:38,210
Yes.

339
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,860
I upgraded my brake discs,

340
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,230
and I modified the calipers too.

341
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,760
So where am I falling short?

342
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,880
Your suspension is too soft.
It can't hold up,

343
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,640
and that causes a chain reaction.

344
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,500
Anything else?

345
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,470
The intake valve is loose,
and the coilovers

346
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,600
and piston calipers are all replicas.

347
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,800
This isn't the optimal setup.

348
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,200
You've never driven it—how would you know?

349
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,290
I can hear it.

350
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,620
I underestimated you.

351
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,670
That night before taking the corner,

352
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,870
why didn't you turn on your headlights?

353
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,030
Racing cars, underground fighting.

354
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,700
Do you own that Chinese restaurant too?

355
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,860
Who's that drunk man who's always there?

356
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,510
How long have you been into racing?

357
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,470
Why haven't I seen you in Manshi before?

358
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,000
You have so many questions.

359
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,600
Then why aren't you answering them?

360
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,950
Why are you

361
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,700
so interested in my business?

362
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,990
Taking corners fast
is what makes you truly fast.

363
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,950
Step on the gas pedal
immediately after the turn

364
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,360
to exit the turn faster.

365
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,530
How about this?

366
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,470
From now on, I'll lead—

367
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,730
will you follow?

368
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,920
Sure.

369
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,800
You did that on purpose.

370
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,460
I didn't plant those flowers.

371
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,880
Turn off your navigation

372
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,600
and stay close behind me.

373
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,040
You're not setting me up, are you?

374
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
What do you think?

375
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,850
Ma'am, I'm heading back first.

376
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,000
Zhao! Driving really fast today, huh?

377
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,800
I believe you did this on purpose
this time.

378
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,990
I told you to stay close.

379
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,590
It was you who didn't keep up.

380
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,540
You need to be so skilled

381
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,750
that your hands
move faster than your brain,

382
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,470
making all your movements

383
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,400
become muscle memory

384
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:11,090
and every decision and action

385
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,930
happen instinctively.

386
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,030
Are you crazy?

387
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,230
Do you think this is a racetrack?

388
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,920
Not respecting your own
and others' safety—

389
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,750
you've insulted the sport of racing.

390
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,880
I was being foolish.

391
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,990
I lost my sense of proportion
in the heat of the moment.

392
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,670
I shouldn't have treated public roads
as racetracks.

393
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,930
You taught me a lesson.

394
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,680
I'm leaving. Won't wait for you.

395
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,320
One last question.

396
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,110
Shoot.

397
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,090
Want to come with me to France?

398
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,920
Join my racing team.

399
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,080
Next month, let's compete together

400
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,360
in the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

401
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:27,640
No thanks.

402
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,230
Once I'm done with what I have on hand,

403
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,230
I'll quit racing.

404
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,650
So what do you plan to do?

405
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,790

Mu.

431
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,080
You're so cool playing the drums.

432
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,190
It's nothing.

433
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,880
Come on, show us your trump card.

434
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,330
Sing a classic song

435
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,560
and blow their minds.

436
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,080
But Jin Zhao hasn't arrived yet.

437
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,670
I want to sing this song for him.

438
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,920
He's not here yet?

439
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,120
That's weird.

440
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,440
Sui talked to him today,

441
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,620
and he asked about
our time and location tonight.

442
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,050
I thought he was coming.

443
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,450
Maybe he's still busy with something.

444
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,040
Now you can sing, right?

445
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,840
Come on.

446
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,530
Next up,

447
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,920
my good friend Jiang Mu

448
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,080
will perform

449
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,070

New Year's right around the corner.

482
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,510
Is it?

483
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,490
It's New Year's Eve in a couple of days.

484
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,230
How did you

485
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,420
usually spend New Year's Eve before?

486
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,160
I forgot.

487
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,810
It never crossed my mind before,

488
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,560
so I never celebrated it.

489
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,360
What about this year?

490
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,820
How do you plan to spend it?

491
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:55,850
What about you?

492
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,390
Do you have any ideas?

493
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,960
I heard from Sanlai

494
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:05,260
that Manshi streets have a really
festive New Year atmosphere.

495
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,630
There are temple fairs
and dragon and lion dances.

496
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,690
Have you seen them?

497
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,080
You want to go see?

498
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,060
What kind of New Year gift would you like?

499
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,780
What about you?

500
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,240
What New Year gift do you want?

501
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,200
If I tell you, will you give it to me?

502
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,270
I can't get the moon from the sky,

503
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:33,950
but anything else,

504
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,690
I'll try my best to get for you.

505
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,940
I don't want the moon from the sky.

506
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,830
I'm already the moon myself.

507
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,650
I'll go look at the waves.

508
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,840
My New Year's wish is

509
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,840
that the person in my heart

510
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,550
can understand my songs,

511
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:28,510
understand my feelings,

512
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:30,550
and keep me in his heart

513
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,670
as his moon for a lifetime!

514
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:33,920
What did you say?

515
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,070
The wind is too strong,
and I couldn't hear clearly.

516
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:37,920
I was singing.

517
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:39,030
Didn't you hear me?

518
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:42,690
I'll sing again then!

519
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,800
The sea at night is also beautiful.

520
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:42,590

It's getting late.

525
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,930
We should head back.

526
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,110
I heard there's a meteor shower tonight.

527
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,360
Let's wait and see.

528
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,510
Please.

529
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,510
Remember last time
we watched the Orionids?

530
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,240
You brought me here to see them.

531
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,320
Back then, you couldn't
even tell directions.

532
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,360
It's different now.

533
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,550
I've fallen in love with astronomy.

534
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,520
Those meteor showers

535
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,150
are a piece of cake for me now.

536
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,000
Have you heard?

537
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,280
If you make wishes to meteor showers,

538
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,140
they're more likely to come true.

539
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,240
What's your wish?

540
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,880
Never thought about it.

541
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,860
You must have many wishes.

542
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,760
How do you know?

543
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,510
What's your wish?

544
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,360

How do you know Zhang Fan?

570
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,200
The guy who stood on your left yesterday.

571
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,590
He's not a good person.

572
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,950
He's a bad guy. Stay away from him.

573
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,200
How's he a bad guy?

574
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,240
He loafs around all day

575
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,340
and never does anything serious.

576
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,960
You can tell at a glance
he won't get into college.

577
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,840
He's been in this foundation course
for 3 years—

578
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,640
he's basically a street guy now.

579
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,820
Where's the money?

580
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,810
If you're late with it again next time,

581
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,840
you're dead.

582
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,630
You know him?

583
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:38,950
Yes.

584
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:40,600
Let's go.

585
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:41,510
Take me to him.

586
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,280
Mu!

587
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,510
Hey, Mu, you really can't go!

588
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,430
He's a street guy.

589
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,830
Why would you want to
get involved with him?

590
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,510
You go.

591
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,420
Me?

592
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:02,870
Leave it to me.

593
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,400
Someone's looking for you outside.

594
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,680
Can't you see I'm sleeping?

595
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,200
Who is it?

596
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:44,800
Oh, it's you.

597
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,200
Do you know Jin...

598
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,050
I mean, do you know Brandy?

599
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,470
Yes, I do.

600
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:52,990
What's up?

601
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:54,920
Are you close?

602
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,260
My brother is pretty close with Brandy.

603
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,340
Your brother?

604
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,450
Who's your brother?

605
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,570
Why are you asking so many questions?

606
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,920
What's your relationship with Brandy?

607
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,840
I'm...

608
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:11,990
I'm his tenant.

609
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:13,320
Well...

610
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,550
What was in that package

611
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,550
you gave to Brandy yesterday?

612
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:18,740
Blueprints.

613
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:22,240
My brother asked me to give them
to Brandy.

614
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:22,970
Blueprints?

615
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,840
They were

616
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,400
complete structural blueprints of a car.

617
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,920
Blueprints?

618
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,330
You... You...

619
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,320
So who's your brother?

620
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,910
An automotive engineer.

621
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,470
He works at a car factory.

622
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,840
Why are you asking so much?

623
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,470
What,

624
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,900
you want to get to know my brother too?

625
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,240
I don't.

626
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,510
Thanks.

627
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,750
So many pointless questions.

628
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,040
Hey, how can you be so shameless?

629
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,360
Mu, are you okay? Did he scare you?

630
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,840
Do you know Seventh Day?

631
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,150
Sure I do.

632
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,180
Back then, when it was my grandpa's
seventh day after passing,

633
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,240
our whole family kept vigil. This...

634
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,300
What's wrong, Mu?

635
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,200
Mu?

636
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,290
Did Zhang Fan give you these blueprints?

637
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,380
You know Zhang Fan?

638
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,360
Of course. He's from my school.

639
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,070
I'm not a nerd.

640
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,410
I know a lot more than you think, okay?

641
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:40,760
Concerned?

642
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,310
Who's concerned?

643
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,760
I have to leave tomorrow.

644
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,950
What's so urgent?

645
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:52,930
It's about the car.
