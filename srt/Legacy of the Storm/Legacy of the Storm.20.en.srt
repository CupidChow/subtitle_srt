1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,559
Sun Chenxi?

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:06,679
Gao Lingfeng?

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,359
You and I

4
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:15,519
are definitely
the most invincible team in the world.

5
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:18,640
Hey, are you really Gambling Saint?

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,600
It's nothing.

7
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:29,920
I don't know

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,920
when we'll meet again
after this separation.

9
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,200
Sun.

10
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:34,280
Goodbye.

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,820
=Legacy of the Storm=

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,060
=Episode 20=

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,260
(Azure Dragon's Essence, Grand Finale)

14
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:46,039
- Look at this.
- Hurry up.

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,119
Hey, noodles are served.

16
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,200
Hey, food is served.

17
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,560
Your father didn't sell you again,
did he?

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,880
- Your food.
- Alright.

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,240
Isn't it nice to start a small business?

20
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:58,640
Mother, I want this.

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,439
Take it carefully.

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,810
- Alright.
- Be careful. It's hot.

23
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,000
- Take care.
- Thank you, Sir.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,980
Let's go.

25
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,040
Ms. Pei'er.

26
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,840
You look good

27
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,079
in military uniform.

28
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,480
I thought

29
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,760
wearing military uniform
will make me majestic.

30
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,200
Now I know

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,120
that it also shoulders

32
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,200
the responsibility
of protecting the people.

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,200
We're willing
to hand over Azure Dragon's Essence

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,680
to you for safekeeping.

35
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,840
Your father left Azure Dragon's Essence.

36
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,500
It should be kept
at General's Residence.

37
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,599
Azure Dragon's Essence was indeed
obtained by my father over a decade ago.

38
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,280
The spring water

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,719
managed to cure you

40
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,319
because of the blessing power

41
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,240
given by Azure Dragon's Essence.

42
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,000
However,

43
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,479
you're currently too weak.

44
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,599
The spring water alone

45
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,319
is not enough.

46
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,039
But it doesn't belong
to the Zhang family.

47
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,599
Gao and Azure Dragon's Essence
complement each other.

48
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,520
You're the true owner
of this divine artifact.

49
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,120
Oh.

50
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,080
Gao, just take it.

51
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,810
This thing will bring disaster
if it stays in General's Residence.

52
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,760
The power of the Four Divine Artifacts
is unpredictable.

53
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,940
If it's not handled properly,

54
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,560
it will cause chaos in the world.

55
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
Alright.

56
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,319
The Four Divine Artifacts' appearance
has wrecked havoc in the martial world.

57
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,199
If this continues,

58
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,439
many will die.

59
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,759
We must find the other divine artifacts

60
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,439
to avoid this catastrophe.

61
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,400
Yeah.

62
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,800
Ms. Pei'er.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,319
I don't know

64
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,240
when we'll meet again
after this separation.

65
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,839
I...

66
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,800
I'm using my mouth to...

67
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,720
You lecher!

68
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,839
I'm using my mouth to give you air.

69
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,120
Sun.

70
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,079
Sun, hurry and wake up.

71
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,920
Sun Chenxi.

72
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,240
Sun Chenxi, wake up.

73
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,959
I can't slack in the city's defense,
so I won't escort you for too long.

74
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,079
Gao.

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,079
Sun.

76
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,439
Goodbye.

77
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,839
Take care.

78
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,639
Sun Chenxi.

79
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,879
This matter is over.

80
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,079
What are your plans next?

81
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,040
I need to take a break
and rest for a few days.

82
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,480
However, if you continue investigating
the Four Divine Artifacts,

83
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,920
I can sacrifice my break

84
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,279
for you.

85
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,680
I'm used to being alone.

86
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:18,120
Besides, Xuanhuo Sect
has already set their sights on me.

87
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,879
I don't want to get you involved.

88
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,399
Get me involved?

89
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,120
Oh.

90
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,240
Let me remind you.

91
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,680
Without me,

92
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,759
you can't deal with Xuanhuo Sect.

93
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,800
Hey, the autumn wind has risen.

94
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,319
The thunder shakes the earth.

95
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,079
North is lucky.

96
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:46,120
Let's head north then.

97
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,759
We have to head north.
