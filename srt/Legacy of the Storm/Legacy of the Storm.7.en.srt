00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:05,360
My brother didn't drown.

2
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:07,320
My brother was murdered.

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,239
Ming City's 13 Men.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,199
Praise the fire.

as a child of Ming City)

00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:30,600

God.

12
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,200
What have I done wrong?

13
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,400
(Zhang Yuan's mysterious death)

14
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,120
(made Gao Lingfeng realize)

00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,640
(the seemingly peaceful
Yanyun City and General's Residence)

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,400
(must be hiding a turbulent conspiracy.)

17
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,680
(All this is closely related
to the fight over divine artifacts.)

18
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,519
(If he wants to find out his identity,)

19
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,040
(he must get to the bottom of it.)

20
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,860
(Zhang Residence)

21
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:52,799
Gao.

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,760
Is there a problem?

23
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,159
Zhang Yuan died strangely.

24
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,079
Here.

25
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,000
If you want to investigate it,
I'll help you.

26
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,400
Hmm?

27
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,439
A drowning person

28
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,000
will struggle desperately

29
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,039
before dying.

30
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:17,840
Yeah.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,350
Their fingers will split open
from struggling under water.

32
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:23,599
Zhang Yuan's fingers are clean.

33
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,360
There isn't even mud on his nails.

34
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,400
I used my inner force to check.

35
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,879
He has no fluid in the chest.

36
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,599
Zhang Yuan's death

37
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,159
was probably due to...

38
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,560
Excessive drinking.

39
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,280
I'm fine.

40
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,360
- Let me pour you a drink.
- Oh, sure.

41
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,319
Alright.

42
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:48,800
Occult practices.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,400
Yes, occult practices.

44
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,479
That's right. I meant occult practices.

45
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,039
Occult practices.

46
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,400
Didn't my brother drown?

47
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,719
Ms. Pei'er.

48
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,360
Hush.

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,000
Keep your voice down.

50
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,639
You said

51
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,000
my brother was murdered.

52
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,280
One day, late at night,

53
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,719
I was at home

54
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,199
when I saw a figure

55
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,680
wandering around in the distance.

56
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,000
They wore red...

57
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,240
Ms. Zhang.

58
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,159
This matter has yet to be concluded.

59
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,759
Ms. Pei'er, don't worry.

60
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,520
With Gao and I working together,

61
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,039
we can find the real culprit

62
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,840
and seek justice for your brother.

63
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,879
My brother

64
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,960
was frivolous,

65
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,680
but he's kind-hearted.

66
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,400
He never harmed anyone.

67
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,039
Why did this happen to him?

68
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,280
Ms. Pei'er.

69
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,560
Ms. Pei'er.

70
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,919
Tell us

71
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,400
how frivolous was your brother.
