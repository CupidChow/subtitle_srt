00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,879
I'm using my mouth to...

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,279
You lecher!

00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:43,540
(Kuzhu Academy, Illusory Battle)

6
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:47,960
- It's you.
- Miao.

7
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,200
Are you a member of Dongjing Faction?

8
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,479
Yes, it's me.

9
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:31,810
Are you alright?

10
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,599
These are illusions.
They have no substance.

11
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:34,760
It can't go on like this.

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,990
We must find the true body
to break through this.

13
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,960
Today,

14
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,039
I will repay Master

15
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,960
with my death.

16
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,680
Watch out!

17
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,719
Sun Chenxi.

18
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:52,919
Sun Chenxi.

19
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,560
Sun Chenxi.

20
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,919
Check if Ms. Zhang is alright.

21
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:02,639
Pei'er.

22
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,000
Pei'er.

23
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,960
Pei'er.

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,120
Why isn't she awake yet?

25
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:13,680
I know.

26
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,039
Hey, Sun Chenxi.

27
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,480
Why are you taking advantage of her?

28
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,199
I'm rescuing her.

29
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:24,719
I'm giving Ms. Pei'er some air, alright?

30
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,800
I...

31
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,080
I'm using my mouth to...

32
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,000
You lecher!

33
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,520
I'm using my mouth to give you air.

34
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,400
I'm not a lecher.

35
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,879
How heartless.

36
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,560
It's called self-inflicted trouble.

37
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,839
You're adding insult to injury.

38
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,920
Ms. Pei'er.

39
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,439
Ms. Pei'er.

40
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,040
It was all a misunderstanding.

41
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,720
Ms. Pei'er, let me explain.

42
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,600
Ms. Pei'er.

43
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,079
This is the enemy's weapon.

44
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,240
Dongjing Faction is despicable

45
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,680
and mean.

46
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,720
If I don't take revenge,

47
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,639
my life will have been in vain.

00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,112
