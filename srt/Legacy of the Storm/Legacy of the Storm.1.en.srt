(Treasure Seizing, Forming Feuds)

00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:56,210
(During the primordial era,)

5
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,190
(Demon Realm brought chaos
to the mortal world.)

6
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,399
(Divine Realm created Four Divine
Artifacts to eliminate evil spirits.)

7
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,319
(Since then, the Four Divine Artifacts
were scattered across the world.)

8
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,560
(The saying that whoever obtains
the divine artifacts)

9
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,190
(will rule the world has been
widely spread in the martial world.)

10
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,079
(The divine artifacts
constantly caused bloodshed.)

11
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,359
It's the young leader of Money Gang.

12
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,040
(Jingshui Boat)
My apologies. Please come in.

13
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,920
(Jingshui Boat)

14
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,000
Don't be lazy.

15
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,480
Hurry up.

16
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,680
Hurry up.

17
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,480
I'm determined to succeed today.

18
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,200
Coming, Sir.

19
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,439
Come on.

20
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,959
(Wow, Jingshui Boat is really fancy.)

21
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,359
I heard that the item being auctioned
today is extraordinary.

22
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:53,000
What item is it?

23
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,079
It's confidential.

24
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,920
I'll win the divine artifact

25
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,959
and show it to you tonight.

26
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,079
All major sects
are gathered here tonight.

27
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:05,359
They're all here
for the divine artifacts.

28
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,840
Boss, all the experts
from various sects are here.

29
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,639
When are we taking action?

30
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,960
Calm down. Follow our plan.

31
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,240
Wait for my signal.

32
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,120
Let's go.

33
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:31,639
It's starting.

34
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,599
28 years ago,

35
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,199
a secret is leaked.

36
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,479
The Four Divine Artifacts
appeared in Central Plains.

37
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,479
Whoever obtains the divine artifacts
will rule the world.

38
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,919
Not long ago, a mysterious traveler
got hold of one of the divine artifacts.

39
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,759
They want to sell it
on this boat tonight.

40
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,719
Jingshui Boat has always emphasized
that harmony ensure prosperity.

41
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,960
Regardless of right or wrong,

42
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,159
we treat everyone equally.

43
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,719
But I want to remind everyone here

44
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,439
not to break our rules.

45
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,319
If anyone tries to rob us,

46
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,840
don't blame me for being cruel.

47
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,919
The night is short.

48
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,599
Can the seller please show up?

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,080
Coming.

50
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,159
This is Vermilion Bird Wings.

51
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,080
Forever shining golden glow.

52
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,800
This is one of the Four Divine Artifacts,

53
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,199
Vermilion Bird Wings.

54
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,560
I spent more than a decade
searching for this divine artifact.

55
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,960
Unfortunately,

56
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,560
not only did I fail to find a way
to activate the divine artifact,

57
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,240
but I also brought disaster
to my family.

58
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,919
I can no longer bear
the misfortune it brings me.

59
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,080
I just hope I can get rid of it safely

60
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,000
and retire from martial world.

61
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:15,159
Now that the seller
and the divine artifact is here,

62
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:18,240
let the bidding begin.

63
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,319
I offer 30 thousand guan.

64
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,959
50 thousand guan.

65
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,000
I offer 100 thousand guan.

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,480
200 thousand guan!

67
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,120
I offer a city.

68
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,680
He's rich.

69
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,920
Ming City gold?

70
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,920
Ming City

71
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,519
is located in the southwest border.

72
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:44,839
For 800 years,

73
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,120
it was a port for trade,

74
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,759
gathering wealth.

75
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:51,920
28 years ago,
there were sudden changes in Ming City.

76
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,000
It became a deserted city overnight.

77
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,879
The city lord's vault

78
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,279
now belongs to our gang.

79
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,439
And this

80
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,720
the key to open the vault.

81
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,439
Who knows whether your key is real?

82
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,959
Is it real or not?

83
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,600
I'm the young leader
of South Sea's Money Gang.

84
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,959
Money Gang's young leader?

85
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,959
Our gang's style of doing things
has always been to spend money...

86
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,920
Humph, instead of risking our lives.

87
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,680
- As long as Money Gang
- He's rich.

88
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,560
takes action
with anything related to money,

89
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,560
no one else will challenge them.

90
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,519
Since it's the young leader
of Money Gang,

91
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,800
are there any other bidders?

92
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,160
Forget it.

93
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,959
Thank you.

94
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,480

Oh, please.

104
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,360
It's alright.

105
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,319
Sir, please.

106
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,759
Here, let's drink.

107
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,920
Have another drink. Here.
