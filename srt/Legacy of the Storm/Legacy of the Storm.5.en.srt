00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,079
Zhenyang Cauldron, command thunder.

2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:25,679
Go.

00:00:40,567 --> 00:00:43,180
(General's Residence, Undercurrent)

6
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:47,119
Sun Chenxi?

7
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,159
Gao Lingfeng?

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,359
It's you again.

9
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,240
Hey.

10
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,880
Why can't it be me?

11
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,079
What does this mean?

12
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,759
It means we are destined to meet.

13
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:02,960
Are we that familiar with each other?

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,840
Hands off.

15
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:09,560
Thank you for coming to the rescue

16
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,480
and saving the day.

17
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:14,400
I wonder what's your names.

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,359
I'm Gao Lingfeng.

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm Sorcerer Sun Chenxi.

20
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,079
You two have extraordinary skills

21
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:23,239
and outstanding demeanor.

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,400
I'm impressed.

23
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,560
Tonight,

24
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,920
I would like to invite you two
to my residence for a drink

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,519
to show my gratitude.

26
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,280
Don't mention it, General.

27
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,760
Then we shall respectfully obey.

28
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,200
(Zhang Residence)
Sirs, please.

29
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,159
(Zhang Residence)
Please.

30
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,640
You two are chivalrous and brave.

31
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,560
I have nothing to repay you.

32
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,599
Here's some money to show my gratitude.

33
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:50,959
Hey.

34
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,400
General.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,840
It's not a big deal.

36
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,200
You don't need to be so generous.

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,439
Thank you, General.

38
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,079
- I shall help myself.
- Hey, Sun Chenxi.

39
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:01,920
Sun Chenxi.

40
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,159
Hey, General.

41
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:05,359
My friend has thin skin.

42
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,159
I'll thank you on his behalf.

43
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:08,680
Hey.

44
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,280
I'll keep it for you first.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,800
Pei'er.

46
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,240
Hurry and thank the two heroes.

47
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,439
I can stop the horse myself.

48
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,039
What's there to thank them for?

49
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,719
Maomao.

50
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,159
Yes.

51
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,960
Ms. Pei'er is skilled in martial arts.

52
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,880
It's my fault
for doing something unnecessary.

53
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:58,840
Humph.

54
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,599
In today's iron horse show,

55
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,319
Ms. Pei'er

56
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:05,039
is dashing and heroic
in her military uniform.

57
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,439
She's indeed

58
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,080
a descendant of a great general.

59
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
Of course.

60
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,439
I'm going to command
the army in the future.

61
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,800
Ha ha, you child.

62
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:16,759
Ah, yes.

63
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,719
Madam.

64
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:20,960
Here's a toast to you.

65
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,319
Sir.

66
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,280
Madam can't drink alcohol.

67
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,599
Mr. Sun, please forgive me.

68
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:31,879
Oh.

69
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,220
Turns out
you're a believer of your religion.

70
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:34,919
Sorry for the rudeness.

71
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,120
I'm late.

72
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,639
Sorry.

73
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,560
I can't see.

74
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,919
Please forgive me

75
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,639
for any negligence.

76
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,159
Your eyes seem clear.

77
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,639
And you look healthy.

78
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,240
Why so?

79
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,680
My wife was from a fishing family.

80
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,280
But two years ago,

81
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,160
a group of pirates
who claim to be Dongjing faction

82
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,639
wreaked havoc in Jiangnan.

83
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,560
She was captured

84
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:25,720
and was so frightened
that she became ill.

85
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,680
Miao, prepare my bowl and chopsticks!

86
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,959
I'm hungry.

87
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,519
We have guests today.

88
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,040
Father, it's fine.

89
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,279
I'll have two bites

90
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,720
and then I'll be gone.

91
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm going to Changle House

92
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,079
to defeat everyone.

93
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,199
You rebellious son.

94
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,560
Calm down, Master.

95
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,120
General, don't get angry.

96
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,360
Or you'll hurt your health.

97
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,879
I, Sun Chenxi,
know a little about divination.

98
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:00,519
I'll tell your fortune

99
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,759
for good luck.

100
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,800
Step out of the clouds.

101
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
Unreachable heights.

102
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,759
Good.

103
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,000
Good.

104
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,240
What does this mean?

105
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,079
This is...

106
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,720
Great luck.

107
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,480
It indicates that the Zhang family
is blessed with good fortune.

108
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:37,879
Oh.

109
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:40,399
Good, are you

110
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,800
a sorcerer?

111
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,800
I'm Sorcerer Sun Chenxi.

112
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
Please sit.

113
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,800
Please sit, Master Sun.

114
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,399
- Oh.
- Please sit.

115
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:53,639
I'm fine.

116
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,600
- Let me pour you a drink.
- Oh, sure.

117
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,720
Alright.

118
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,879
Master Sun, let me tell you.

119
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,720
There's something weird

120
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,920
going on in our residence lately.

121
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,920
One day, late at night,

122
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,439
I was at home

123
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,639
when I saw a figure

124
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,199
wandering around in the distance.

125
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,560
They wore red,

126
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,360
mumbling

127
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,199
like chanting a sutra.

128
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,759
I followed them quietly.

129
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,560
Guess what happened.

130
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,399
What happened?

131
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,360
It was a paper figure!

132
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,305
