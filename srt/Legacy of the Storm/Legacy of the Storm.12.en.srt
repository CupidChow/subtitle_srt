General's Residence

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,200
is full of dangers.

3
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:09,480
The human heart is unpredictable.

4
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:12,080
If I don't take revenge,

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,000
my life will have been in vain.

6
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:17,320
Still in the dark clouds.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,199
This is a very ominous sign.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,199
Father.

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,239
What has come over you?

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,920
Unleash all your anger.

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,280
Follow the flame's instructions.

(Rooftop, Ghost Story)

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,200
I offer a city.

16
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:23,680
Ming City gold?

17
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,439
General's Residence

18
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,840
is full of dangers.

19
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,480
The human heart is unpredictable.

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,439
It would be unsafe to stay.

21
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,319
Leave then.

22
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,280
I'll continue to investigate here.

23
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,799
I see it now.

24
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,280
Are you planning to drive me away

25
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,959
and take all the credit?

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,560
We really can't expect anything decent
to come out of your mouth.

27
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,599
Gao.

28
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,400
I'm an orphan.

29
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,039
I ventured into the martial world
at a very young age to make ends meet.

30
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,719
This world

31
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:12,960
is full of evil people.

32
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,960
I haven't had any friends
in the past few years.

33
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,719
I consider you a friend,

34
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:21,120
so I won't let you take risks alone.

35
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,360
An amulet.

36
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,479
It's for you.

37
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,159
What's the meaning of this?

38
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,360
- Take it.
- Hey.

39
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,439
As your partner,

40
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,950
I don't want anything to happen to you.

41
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,840
You'll hold me back.

42
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,360
Here. Cheers.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,520
As the saying goes, maple leaves
are dense when it's mid-autumn.

44
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,719
Who doesn't drink

45
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,879
is a coward.

46
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,280
A fool.

47
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:55,840
A fool.

48
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,479
Gao, Sun.

49
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:04,599
Ms. Pei'er.

50
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,680
What happened?

51
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,759
After Miao died,

52
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:08,719
I thought about it

53
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,000
and felt something was wrong.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,080
Hey, calm down.

55
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,039
Take your time.

56
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,159
I'm afraid...
