00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,340
(Zhang Residence's Sorrow, Murder Case)

4
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:44,840
It was a paper figure!

5
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,640
It was actually a paper figure.

6
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,359
Yuan.

7
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,079
Have you had too much to drink?

8
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:53,079
I just had a few drinks.

9
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:55,399
I'm telling you.

10
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:56,840
Have you ever seen a paper figure

11
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,560
that can walk and talk?

12
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,759
Our residence must be haunted.

13
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:03,439
Zhang Yuan.

14
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,239
We're having a banquet.

15
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,350
Why are you talking nonsense?

16
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,840
Oh.

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,359
Father.

18
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:11,480
It's not nonsense.

19
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,959
I was thinking

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,400
of asking some experts to take a look.

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,000
Isn't it a coincidence

22
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,000
that Mr. Sun is here?

23
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,280
My dear.

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,640
What's the matter?

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,420
Are you feeling uncomfortable again?

26
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:31,879
No.

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,680
I had too much fun drinking with you today.

28
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,400
Oh.

29
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,280
How about I accompany you
back to your room to rest?

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,280
You can go to Quan Palace for treatment
another day.

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,959
Thank you for your hospitality today.

32
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,640
Now I have had three rounds of drinks.

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,560
I had a great time.

34
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,439
Alright, please bear with me.

35
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,120
It's late.

36
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,480
Stay in my residence first.

37
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:10,900
(Zhang Residence)

38
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:14,319
No one believes me.

39
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,719
When you see it yourself one day,

40
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,520
you will know, and you will regret it.

41
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,439
That sorcerer
said I'm very lucky tonight.

42
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,719
I'm going to defeat everyone.

43
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,479
Defeat everyone.

44
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,000
Here.

45
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,680
Watch your step.

46
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,319
What's this?

47
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,599
My master

48
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,280
likes to listen to Second Madam
play music to help him sleep.

49
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,159
Sir, please look.

50
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,520
Here.

51
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:18,199
Your rooms are here.

52
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,120
Please.

53
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,400
Pick one.

54
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,360
Ah.

55
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,039
You've had your meal

56
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,159
and taken your money.

57
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,520
When do you plan
to leave General's Residence?

58
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,159
Gao.

59
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,360
Why the straight face?

60
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,080
Are you full of anger?

61
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,840
You'll have too much pent-up fury.

62
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,080
It's bad for your health.

63
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,759
Hmm?

64
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,400
Do the people from your hometown
talk so close to each other?

65
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,080
Yeah.

66
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,840
Stop trying to get close to me.

67
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,639
Stay away from me.

68
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,800
Oh.

69
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,360
I was safekeeping it for you earlier.

70
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,159
I now return it intact to you.

71
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,000
Do you think
I'm as greedy for money as you?

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,319
- You can keep it.
- Hey.

73
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,520
Gao.

74
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,599
We're partners.

75
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,639
Two plus one makes five.

76
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,919
I'm not your partner.

77
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,800
You and I are definitely
the most invincible team in the world.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,800
With my wisdom and your sword...

79
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,959
Ouch!

80
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:23,759
Don't move.

81
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,000
Isn't it just a stupid sword?

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,279
Do you have to be so heavy-handed?

83
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,879
I'll leave General's Residence tomorrow.

84
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,839
We'll never see each other again.

85
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,240
Hey, Gao.

86
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,079
Well...

87
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,279
Reconsider being partners with me.

88
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,000
Get lost.

89
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,399
Step out of the clouds.

90
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,199
Unreachable heights.

91
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,199
Look up at the bright moon.

92
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,000
Still in the dark clouds.

93
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,000
This is a very ominous sign.

95
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,879
No one believes me.

96
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,279
When you see it yourself one day,

97
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,879
you will know, and you will regret it.

98
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,800
God.

99
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,680

(the seemingly peaceful
Yanyun City and General's Residence)

103
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:43,199
(must be hiding a turbulent conspiracy.)

104
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,959
(All this is closely related
to the fight over divine artifacts.)

105
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:51,160
(If he wants to find out his identity,)

106
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,680
(he must get to the bottom of it.)
