1
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,679
You cheated!

2
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:20,719
Kill him for me!

(Academy, Assassination)

6
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,359
Please.

7
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:50,000
Buddy.

8
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,520
Oh.

9
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:59,479
Amazing.

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,640
Go on.

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,079
He's doomed this time.

12
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,599
You're an expert.

13
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,799
Amazing. It's all gone.

14
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:13,120
- Oh, what is he looking for?
- Oh.

15
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,200
I happily accept your right hand,
Gambling Saint.

16
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,319
Hey.

17
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,239
No.

18
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:19,799
- No.
- Wait.

19
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,359
What's the matter?

20
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,640
You can't afford to play?

21
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,519
I want to help my friend
turn the tables.

22
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,400
Oh?

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,680
As for the bet,

24
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,719
the hands of an ordinary person like me
are worth nothing.

25
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,640
How about

26
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,480
betting on my head?

27
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,439
Good.

28
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:39,680
I'll make an exception today
and entertain a nobody like you.

29
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,719
Let's take a gamble.

30
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:41,799
Sure.

31
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,359
I thought he was an expert.

32
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,200
That's all he can do.

33
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,110
We're doomed.

34
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,239
- Please.
- He's doomed.

35
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,200
He only got eight.

36
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,280
- He just can't do it.
- His head will be off soon.

37
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,640
He's going to lose his head.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,350
He played too big.
It's called hitting a rock with an egg.

39
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,799
How is he an expert?

40
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,159
Isn't he an amateur?

41
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,439
- Ah.
- Hey.

42
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,370
He's one point smaller.

43
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,199
- Gambling God lost.
- He lost.

44
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,599
Gambling God lost.

45
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:16,439
- Gambling God lost.
- You cheated.

46
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,199
You're the thief
shouting to catch a thief.

47
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,680
You cheated!

48
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,319
- You cheated!
- I'm scared.

49
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,840
Someone.

50
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,680
Kill him for me!

51
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,680
Spare me, good man!

52
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,639
I don't care about your life.
I just want to ask about something.

53
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,400
Alright.

54
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,439
I'll tell you the truth.

55
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:00,199
Do you know
General's Residence's eldest son,

56
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,120
Zhang Yuan?

57
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,960
Yes.

58
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,840
He came to Changle House every day.

59
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,639
Has there
been anything wrong with him recently?

60
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,120
Yes.

61
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,639
He kept mumbling about General's Residence
being haunted these days.

62
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:14,159
But I don't know the details.

63
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,159
Spare me, good man.

64
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,080
But he and a gambler named Wang

65
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,319
are good friends.

66
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,159
The two talked a lot.

67
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,970
Where can I find the man surnamed Wang?

68
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,439
Kuzhu Academy.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,840
Hey.

70
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,319
I have a request.

71
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,479
Yanyun's Gambling God.

72
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,520
You must say yes.

73
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:42,840
Go ahead.

74
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,199
I see many gamblers
who sell their children here.

75
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,479
What a killjoy.

76
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,479
From today on, Changle House has a rule

77
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,390
that anyone who sells their children
is never allowed onto Changle Street.

78
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,560
I swear.

79
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,500
(Kuzhu Academy)

80
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,800
Why is Kuzhu Academy

81
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,439
in such a state of disrepair?

82
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,319
Hey.

83
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:20,879
Do you think

84
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,720
this is a trap?

85
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,920
Even better.

86
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,759
We'll lure out the enemy.

87
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,460
It'll save us from looking for them.

88
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:29,959
Hey.

89
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,160
Watch out.

90
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,360
Watch out.

91
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,720
- Protect Ms. Zhang.
- Got it.

92
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,160
Leave this to me.

93
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,519
Don't give me trouble.

94
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,740
(Kuzhu Academy)

95
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,399
- It's you.
- Miao?

96
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,639
Are you a member of Dongjing Faction?

97
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:09,439
Yes, it's me.
