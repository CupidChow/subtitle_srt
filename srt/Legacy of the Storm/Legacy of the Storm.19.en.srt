Gao.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,719
You ruined things for me again.

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,640
Praise the flame.

8
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:27,480
I'm willing to become ashes.

00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:32,840
We're willing
to hand over Azure Dragon's Essence

10

I'm willing to become firewood.

16

Praise the flame.

17
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,680
I'm willing to become ashes.

18

You ruined things for me again.

29
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,000
Ms. Pei'er.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,560
Let me explain.

31
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,759
What a waste.

32
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,800
This mechanism isn't that difficult.

33
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,879
What?

34
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,240
It's not the divine artifact,
Vermilion Bird Wings.

35

It's indeed Prosperity Gold Coin.

39
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,520
It is said to bring supreme luck.

40
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,240
Gao, I'm going to be lucky.

41
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,159
Investigate a case?

42
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,759
Aren't you after Vermilion Bird Wings?

43
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,879
You're not hurt anymore?

44
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:11,319
I'll hit you harder

45
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,759
