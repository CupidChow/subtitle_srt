00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,039
- Gao.
- Gao.

2
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,000
It's the flame's guidance

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,760
that allows me
to see you again after 28 years!

4
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,740

00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,220
=Episode 11=

6
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,460
(General's Residence, Scheme)

7
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,640
If I don't take revenge,

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,560
my life will have been in vain.

9
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:49,840
- Hey.
- Master.

10
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,600
- What happened?
- Father.

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,719
Father.

12
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,920
What happened, Father?

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,200
Father, are you alright?

14
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,079
Madam, be careful.

15
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,840
- Father.
- Master.

16
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,660
Master, how are you?

17
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,719
I'm alright.

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,840
Second Madam.

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,239
My father isn't felling well.
Take him back to rest first.

20
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:12,920
Alright.

21
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:14,799
Father, be careful.

22
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,280
Everyone, listen up.

23
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:23,560
Today's events are strictly prohibited
from being spread.

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,319
Violators will be punished
by military law.

25
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,159
- Yes!
- Yes!

26
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,280
Deputy General Li.

27
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,040
Yes.

28
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:29,280
From today onward,

29
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,400
double the guards
at General's Residence.

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,719
Impose an all-day lockdown.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,439
And the servants
are strictly forbidden to go out.

32
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,159
Yes.

33
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,159
Hey.

34
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,319
Gao.

35
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,599
What's your opinion on Kuzhu Academy?

36
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,840
Pirates seeking revenge.

37
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,400
Since they
already infiltrated Yanyun City,

38
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,519
why did they choose to assassinate
Zhang Yuan, who is addicted to gambling?

39
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,799
It is rumored in the martial world

40
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,560
that Dongjing Faction
is good at conspiracy

41
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,920
and scheming.

42
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,240
By doing this,

43
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,520
wouldn't they have alerted

44
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,919
General's Residence?

45
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,319
Do you remember what Zhang Yuan said
at the banquet?

46
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,439
He was acting crazy that day.

47
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,960
He mentioned his home being haunted
and a paper figure.

48
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,439
Did he see...

49
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,560
Zhang Yuan's drunken nonsense

50
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,759
may be seen by some people

51
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,960
as a threat to expose their conspiracy.

52
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,159
So I suspect
there may be more than one ghost

53
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,560
in General's Residence.

54
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,599
Hey.

55
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,719
Look at General Li.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,400
Isn't he sneaky?

57
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,039
Gao.

58
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,599
Madam is suspicious too.

59
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,840
I was wondering

60
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,719
who was playing.

61
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,479
The music sounds very elegant.

62
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,439
Turns out it's Second Madam.

63
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,319
You're too kind, Mr. Gao.

64
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,479
My skills are poor.

65
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,919
It's all because the zither
that General gave me

66
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,520
is melodious.

67
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,920
We've disturbed you for many days,

68
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,600
but we still don't know

69
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,959
where your hometown is.

70
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,319
My home is in Puxian.

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,079
It's a small place.

72
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,690
I traveled all over the country
and have been there before.

73
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,680
The silk there is famous.

74
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,920
Silk?

75
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,839
You probably remembered it wrong.

76
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,920
Puxian has barren land and hot
and rainy season at the same time,

77
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,590
making it unsuitable
for silk production.

78
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,560
Because there are few farmers

79
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,360
and many skilled craftsmen,

80
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,279
lacquerware is quite famous.

81
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,800
I remembered it wrong then.

82
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,040
Sorry to bother you.

83
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,720
We'll leave first.

84
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,279
Suit yourself.

85
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,399
She seems to be truly blind.

86
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,738
(To Be Continued)

87
00:05:11,738 --> 00:05:12,865
