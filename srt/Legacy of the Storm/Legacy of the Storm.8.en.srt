- Big.

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,759
Sir, have mercy.

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,399
Look at me.

19
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:57,960
Help me.

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,719
Cut the crap.

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,560
You're not selling?

22
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,119
Get lost!

23
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:01,520
No, Sir.

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,920
I'm selling.

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,000
I'll sell, alright?

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,480
It's a deal then.

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,519
Sure.

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,079
Hey.

29
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,239
What do you want to do?

30
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,799
Don't stop me from getting rich.

31
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:16,799
Buddy.

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,920
I'm here to help you get rich.

33
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:19,920
You

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,000
can help me get rich?

35
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,880
Judging from your daughter's looks,
she's destined to become rich.

36
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:26,840
(500 Guan)
I want to borrow her good luck.

37
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:30,319
We can talk it out.

(500 Guan)
Hey.

- Who is it?
- What is he doing?

45
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,120
Little girl.

46
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,879
Help me pick one, alright?

47
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,840
This one?

48
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,000
Sorry.

49
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:57,920
This one.

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,039
No way.

51
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,130
He won.

52
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:14,960

Thank you.

56
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,919
He's so lucky.

57
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,960
Again.

58
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,520

Malan Hill's Gambling Saint.

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,319
I just arrived in Yanyun City

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,520
and wanted to make a name for myself
in Changle House.

63
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,039
- Good.
- Good.

64
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,199
Hey, are you really Gambling Saint?

65
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,400
It's nothing.

66
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,159
Hey.

67
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,960
Take it easy.

68
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,360
Gao, don't expose me.

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,100
This is the first time in these years
hat I have had such great luck.

70
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,680
Here, continue.

71
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,680
My master wants to have a one-on-one match
with Malan Hill's Gambling Saint.

72
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,840
All of you leave the gambling table!

73
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,479
- He took the bait so quickly.
- Oh no.

74
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,000
This man...

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,639
This man is Yanyun's Gambling God.

76
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,190
What's there to be afraid of?

77
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,800
We have Malan Hill's Gambling Saint.

78
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,960
Get out of the way!

79
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,240
I promised you this.

80
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,599
You should use this money
to do some business.

81
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,439
Thank you, Master and Madam.

82
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,360
I wish you two
a long and happy marriage.

83
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,560
Malan Hill's Gambling Saint.

84
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,800
Sorry for the poor hospitality.

85
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,960
My apologies.

86
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,400
Yanyun's Gambling God.

87
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,639
I long heard of you.

88
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,560
Nice to meet you.

89
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,080
I heard that Yanyun's Gambling God

90
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,360
is the shadow king of Changle House.

91
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,520
You know everything about the people
and things in Changle House.

92
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,879
I want to ask you something.

93
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,719
You may ask,

94
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,280
but you must defeat me first.

95
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,520
It's not too much for us
to each add a right hand, right?

96
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,240
Huh?

97
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,840
Will it be dangerous?

98
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,000
It's just the right hand.

99
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,279
Let's bet.

100
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,639
You have no hesitation.

101
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,920
People come, dreams come!

102
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,000
This...

103
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,920
This is amazing.

104
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,560
- Gambling God.
- Is he a real god?

105
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,279
He deserves to be Gambling God.

106
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,890
It's the first time I've seen this.

107
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:37,800
I've never seen this.

108
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,079
Please.

109
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:47,120
I'll return the favor.

110
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,959
Please.

111
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,600
Buddy.

112
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,120
Oh.

113
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,079
Amazing.

114
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,240
Go on.

115
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,680
He's doomed this time.
