1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,820
Sir, what are you doing?

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,060
Sorry

3
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:07,780
I guess I overreacted a bit.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,780
I thought maybe you
were filming or something.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,540
What? No, never.

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,860
Should we pick up from there?

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,619
I... um...

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,180
What's wrong?

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,339
Minhyuk... actually, I...

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,140
Minhyuk?

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,619
I never told you my name, did I?

12
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,220
Oh... I...

13
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,139
How did you know?

14
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,099
I heard about you from someone
who took your class before.

15
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,579
That's how I knew your name.

16
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,940
Who exactly told you about me?

17
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,300
I...

18
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,619
Look, sir...

19
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,899
Sorry, but I think we
should stop the lesson here.

20
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,379
I'll deduct one session's fee

21
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,899
and refund you the rest.

22
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,299
Wait...

23
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,860
Sir, please...

24
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,419
Hello?

25
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,459
So? How'd it go?

26
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,739
What about the photo?

27
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,259
I don't know I didn't get one.

28
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,339
I don't think it's him.

29
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,779
Really?

30
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,579
That doesn't make sense.

31
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,579
You're not lying to me, right?

32
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,660
Why would I lie to you?

33
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,580
Okay, bye

34
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,700
What the hell am I doing...

35
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,579
(Student: Kim Kyung-won)

36
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,500
Lee Changmin?

37
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,580
That friend he mentioned...

38
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,219
Hello?

39
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,860
I think I overreacted earlier.

40
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,980
Let's continue the lesson.

41
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,260
Are you free tomorrow?

42
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,100
Tomorrow?

43
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,020
Yeah, I'm free.

44
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,139
Then let's meet at the same place tomorrow.

45
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,140
Okay.

46
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,180
Tomorrow.

47
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,820
Tomorrow...
