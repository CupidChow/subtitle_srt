1
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,660
You're here?

2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,820
Shall we get started?

3
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,659
You're doing well.

4
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,580
What are we doing next, teacher?

5
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,139
When you're putting it in at first,

6
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,579
think of it as gently opening up the inside

7
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,940
and slowly ease it in.

8
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,579
Are you okay, teacher?

9
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,580
Yeah, I'm fine.

10
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,740
Teacher...

11
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,540
I think it's coming.

12
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,139
T... Teacher...

13
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,420
Then tell me now.

14
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,259
Tell you what...

15
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,099
Why did you find me?

16
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,339
What's your connection to him?

17
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,459
What are you talking about?

18
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,939
I just...

19
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,299
Tell me the truth.

20
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,940
I'm not letting you go until you do.

21
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,939
The truth is...

22
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,740
Changmin did talk about you.

23
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,219
He said he wanted to see you again.

24
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,780
He asked me to find you.

25
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,459
Then one day we saw a post online

26
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,299
about Sexual Lessons.

27
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,499
Changmin saw it and said

28
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,140
he was sure it was the
person he'd been looking for.

29
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,059
He asked me to meet you and check.

30
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,420
So did you tell him?

31
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,659
No... not yet.

32
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,899
Good.

33
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,580
Don't ever tell him.

34
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:24,578
So then...

35
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,419
You got what you came for

36
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,300
Do we still need to keep doing this?

37
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,460
Please don't go.

38
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,139
I really like you.

39
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,739
Do you mean that?

40
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,259
Yes.

41
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,140
At first, yeah, I did
have a reason for coming.

42
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,459
But now...

43
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,300
It's not like that.

44
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,540
I'll take responsibility for what happened.

45
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,300
What?

46
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,300
Let's finish the lesson.

47
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,520
Teacher,

48
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,739
Can I see you again?

49
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,459
Who knows...

50
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,980
I'll going now.

51
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:10,140
Now I get why he wanted
to see you so badly.
