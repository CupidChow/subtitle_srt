1
00:00:13,326 --> 00:00:15,315
Was it a dream?

2
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:18,151
But...

3
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:21,355
The feeling still lingers.

4
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:26,493
Minoru.

5
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:29,630
What's wrong?

6
00:00:31,252 --> 00:00:32,232
Nothing.

7
00:00:33,574 --> 00:00:34,841
Well...

8
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:41,074
You may not remember,

9
00:00:42,056 --> 00:00:43,110
but back then,

10
00:00:43,872 --> 00:00:46,146
you were the one who talked to me first.

11
00:00:49,036 --> 00:00:49,750
Eh?

12
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,453
Minoru.

13
00:01:07,855 --> 00:01:08,835
Sorry.

14
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:36,797
Oh, Minoru.

15
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:37,984
The water in the tub is warm and ready.

16
00:01:37,984 --> 00:01:40,023
- Ready, ready.
- Okay, got it.

17
00:01:40,023 --> 00:01:41,651
- Come on, Tane.
- Got it.

18
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,770
Let's have some ice cream.

19
00:01:49,755 --> 00:01:50,655
Dammit.

20
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,537
What have I done?

21
00:02:40,087 --> 00:02:45,662
"Our Dining Table"

22
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:46,469
(Ramen)

23
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:48,269
"Episode 8"

24
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:49,336
Dammit.

25
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:54,708
Well...

26
00:02:55,257 --> 00:02:56,009
Yes?

27
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:59,629
You've been sighing a lot
for quite some time.

28
00:02:59,885 --> 00:03:01,648
The happiness has run away.

29
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:04,541
Did I sigh that much?

30
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,819
You did.

31
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:09,089
I have no idea what happened.

32
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:12,993
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,533
How about this?

34
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:24,004
What's with that face?

35
00:03:30,306 --> 00:03:31,211
Look.

36
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:33,894
If the the soup of the ramen tastes bad,

37
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:37,284
no matter what you do to the noodles,
the ramen is still going to be horrible.

38
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:38,385
That's how it is.

39
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:41,922
Huh?

40
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:43,824
What do you mean?

41
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:45,726
I mean,

42
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:48,110
if you're in a bad place,
trying to hide it won't help.

43
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:52,132
If you don't fix the original problem,
you can't move on, right?

44
00:03:52,215 --> 00:03:53,233
That's how it is.

45
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,974
Manager.

46
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:02,692
You give good advice once in a while.

47
00:04:02,802 --> 00:04:04,010
Not just once in a while.

48
00:04:05,268 --> 00:04:07,147
Minoru, keep going.

49
00:04:09,203 --> 00:04:10,150
Okay.

50
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:29,336
Good morning.

51
00:04:29,365 --> 00:04:31,805
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

52
00:04:31,888 --> 00:04:34,957
Oh, no. What should I do?
Kana, do you have time to listen?

53
00:04:34,957 --> 00:04:36,109
What? What is it?

54
00:04:36,123 --> 00:04:37,511
You had a fight
with your boyfriend again?

55
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:40,113
Well, something like that.

56
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,215
We fought.

57
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:44,800
I played hard to get
and waited for him to come to me first.

58
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,254
But he hasn't reached out
to me in a week.

59
00:04:47,463 --> 00:04:48,655
A week?

60
00:04:48,778 --> 00:04:50,290
Yes, a week.

61
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,373
I think that's not very good.

62
00:04:52,942 --> 00:04:54,294
You think so?

63
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:58,598
I do. It's been a week.

64
00:05:01,671 --> 00:05:04,004
Hey, Hozumi, what do you think?

65
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:04,805
Eh?

66
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,143
Is that so?

67
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:15,482
If you want to know,

68
00:05:15,997 --> 00:05:18,552
why don't you reach out to him first?

69
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,086
You really think so?

70
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,422
Well.

71
00:05:23,278 --> 00:05:24,491
You think so too...

72
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,160
Thank you, Hozumi.

73
00:05:27,263 --> 00:05:29,263
I've decided. I'll contact him.

74
00:05:30,813 --> 00:05:32,339
But what should I do?

75
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:34,534
Should I call him?
Or should I go see him?

76
00:05:34,758 --> 00:05:37,604
Um, you should call him first.

77
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,974
I guess it's better to call.

78
00:05:50,032 --> 00:05:55,470
(Ueda Minoru)
(Can we meet today?)

79
00:06:02,702 --> 00:06:06,533
(Can we meet today after work?)

80
00:06:14,956 --> 00:06:18,721
(Printemps Cafe)

81
00:06:18,974 --> 00:06:19,746
Welcome.

82
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:20,480
The food was very good.

83
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,082
Oh, thank you.

84
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,717
Welcome.

85
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,978
My friend is waiting for me.

86
00:06:26,242 --> 00:06:27,520
The innermost booth, sir.

87
00:06:27,549 --> 00:06:28,421
Okay.

88
00:06:37,232 --> 00:06:38,431
Hi.

89
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,333
Hey.

90
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,298
- Well.
- Well.

91
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,593
Sorry, Minoru, you first.

92
00:07:13,593 --> 00:07:15,635
No, you first.

93
00:07:20,594 --> 00:07:21,708
Welcome.

94
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:24,611
What would you like, sir?

95
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:26,913
I'd like a blended coffee, please.

96
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:28,915
Make it two, please.

97
00:07:29,017 --> 00:07:30,317
I'll get that order in for you.

98
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:38,992
About earlier,

99
00:07:39,571 --> 00:07:41,157
I'm very, very, sorry.

100
00:07:41,157 --> 00:07:43,897
No, I'm fine.

101
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,034
What have I done?

102
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,910
By the way,

103
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:59,996
what do you mean I talked to you first?

104
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,750
Sorry, I can't remember.

105
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:07,153
Oh, right.

106
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,125
Where should I start?

107
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,467
At the time,

108
00:08:21,844 --> 00:08:23,803
my mom had just passed.

109
00:08:31,369 --> 00:08:32,545
Honestly,

110
00:08:32,682 --> 00:08:36,783
after Mom died, before I felt sad,

111
00:08:37,498 --> 00:08:39,144
I felt a little relieved.

112
00:08:41,551 --> 00:08:42,622
I felt relieved

113
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,025
because I wouldn't have to
feel even more afraid

114
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,127
that my sick mother
would die and be gone forever.

115
00:08:49,249 --> 00:08:50,697
Well...

116
00:08:50,835 --> 00:08:52,866
Why are you here? What about college?

117
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,884
Uh, whatever.

118
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,964
I'll pick Tane up today.

119
00:08:56,964 --> 00:08:57,964
You will?

120
00:08:58,057 --> 00:08:59,916
Then what would you like to eat?

121
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:01,141
I'll make dinner.

122
00:09:03,123 --> 00:09:04,577
Mom's food.

123
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:05,912
What?

124
00:09:07,523 --> 00:09:08,615
Nothing.

125
00:09:08,656 --> 00:09:10,183
I'm not really hungry.

126
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:11,422
Is that so?

127
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,865
I'm off, then.

128
00:09:12,948 --> 00:09:13,787
Okay.

129
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,024
But...

130
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,795
When the worry disappeared,
emptiness filled the space.

131
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,469
My empty self

132
00:09:29,598 --> 00:09:31,317
still hadn't been fulfilled.

133
00:09:38,252 --> 00:09:39,779
It was a time like that.

134
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,516
Minoru, pick me up.

135
00:09:48,516 --> 00:09:49,669
No.

136
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:51,660
You're heavy. Just walk.

137
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,886
No, you carry me.

138
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:55,495
I said no.

139
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,532
Pick me up. Pick me up.

140
00:10:00,907 --> 00:10:03,336
That poor little kid.

141
00:10:04,172 --> 00:10:06,072
Pick me up.

142
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,441
Pick me up.

143
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,037
I don't care. You can lie there
for the rest of your life.

144
00:10:13,037 --> 00:10:14,897
Pick me up.

145
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:16,282
I'm leaving. All right?

146
00:10:16,425 --> 00:10:19,595
No. Pick me up.

147
00:10:21,598 --> 00:10:23,823
It's dangerous to lie down here.

148
00:10:23,906 --> 00:10:25,391
Hey, can you get up?

149
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:29,529
All right.

150
00:10:32,224 --> 00:10:33,600
That's right.

151
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,834
Well done.

152
00:10:39,465 --> 00:10:41,144
Sorry for my stupid brother.

153
00:10:41,144 --> 00:10:43,450
Oh, no, that's okay.

154
00:10:45,523 --> 00:10:46,379
I'll get going, then.

155
00:10:46,762 --> 00:10:47,714
Bye-bye.

156
00:10:56,631 --> 00:10:57,690
Back then,

157
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,692
I was so glad

158
00:11:00,608 --> 00:11:01,861
that you came up and helped.

159
00:11:05,914 --> 00:11:08,902
I finally felt warm again
after such a long time.

160
00:11:10,398 --> 00:11:11,905
I made it myself.

161
00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:13,740
Really?

162
00:11:13,765 --> 00:11:15,870
Man, you are a genius.

163
00:11:16,472 --> 00:11:17,377
"Man"?

164
00:11:22,245 --> 00:11:23,283
That guy...

165
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:31,257
Where is your family?

166
00:11:33,386 --> 00:11:34,561
Maybe not.

167
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:37,797
Hey, Tane.

168
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:41,067
Didn't I tell you to wait
at the checkout counter?

169
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,240
At first, I thought it wasn't you.

170
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:50,476
But...

171
00:11:53,508 --> 00:11:57,217
You really are that person.

172
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:05,925
Huh?

173
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:14,634
Yutaka.

174
00:12:17,464 --> 00:12:18,404
I...

175
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,841
like you.

176
00:12:26,653 --> 00:12:27,413
What?

177
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,551
I like you.

178
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:39,192
Like me?

179
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,220
Meeting you

180
00:12:41,245 --> 00:12:43,114
and spending time with you

181
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,032
makes me enjoy my life again
after a long time.

182
00:12:48,996 --> 00:12:50,336
What should we eat next time?

183
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:51,804
What should I do

184
00:12:53,014 --> 00:12:54,440
with you?

185
00:12:57,894 --> 00:12:59,779
Just the thought of being with you

186
00:13:00,181 --> 00:13:01,447
makes me feel happy.

187
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:04,584
But...

188
00:13:14,901 --> 00:13:16,296
Sir,

189
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,765
we're closing.

190
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:21,834
Sorry.

191
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,770
We'll get going.

00:13:47,355 --> 00:13:48,329
Thank you

194
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:51,531
for listening to me today.

195
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,537
I wasn't really planning to tell you

196
00:13:59,077 --> 00:14:01,274
because I knew it'd make
you feel uncomfortable.

197
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,790
Yutaka.

198
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,327
Hold my hand.

199
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:26,199
This will be the last time
that I'll touch you.

200
00:14:42,121 --> 00:14:43,190
After this,

201
00:14:46,876 --> 00:14:48,554
I want us to be the same like before.

202
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:53,459
Okay.

203
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:19,919
Goodbye, then.

204
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,463
Goodbye.

205
00:16:20,328 --> 00:16:21,681
Oh, Minoru, welcome home.

206
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:23,549
The water in the tub is warm now.

207
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,084
Where's Tane?

208
00:16:25,482 --> 00:16:26,986
He's asleep.

209
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:28,754
Hey.

210
00:16:28,984 --> 00:16:31,424
If Yutaka's coming tonight,
shall we have hot pot?

211
00:16:31,718 --> 00:16:34,494
Make it a big one with crab and all.

212
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:35,928
He's probably not coming.

213
00:16:36,402 --> 00:16:37,136
Eh?

214
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:38,397
I'm not taking a bath.

215
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,699
Good night.

216
00:16:48,728 --> 00:16:51,344
We'll be working together
for a long time after this.

217
00:16:51,438 --> 00:16:54,733
- Let's work hard together.
- Let's work hard together.

218
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,016
Let's work hard together.

219
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,751
Please take care of us.

220
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,921
- Let's work hard together.
- Please take care of us.

221
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,623
Yutaka.

222
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,559
Hold my hand.

223
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,397
This will be the last time
that I'll touch you.

224
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,238
Thank you very much.

225
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,640
Thank you very much.

226
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:26,812
Here.

227
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,045
You did great just now.
Well done. Come on, now.

228
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:29,849
Go.

229
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,385
All right. Try throwing it from above.

230
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,188
Pay attention and
look at my glove from above.

231
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,679
All right. Well done. You did great.

232
00:17:39,762 --> 00:17:41,193
Minoru, welcome home.

233
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,695
- Yeah, I'm home.
- Welcome back.

234
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:43,763
Come play with us.

235
00:17:43,978 --> 00:17:45,394
All right. Go play together.

236
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:47,547
- Now?
- Now. Come and replace me.

237
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,302
Ah, I'm so tired.

238
00:17:53,445 --> 00:17:56,242
Minoru, will Yukata come this week?

239
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,246
Um, I don't know.

240
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,081
He's probably busy
at the end of the year.

241
00:18:02,437 --> 00:18:03,980
Eh? Why?

242
00:18:04,026 --> 00:18:05,785
Yukata is not coming?

243
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,753
I want to see him.

244
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,559
How long has it been

245
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,496
that I've been alone on weekends?

246
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:06,278
Thank you for the food.

247
00:19:33,647 --> 00:19:35,274
Oh, no, it's burnt.

248
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,967
- Oh, no.
- I told you to use low heat.

249
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:39,512
- Sorry.
- Jeez.

250
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:42,648
What about Yukata?
He'll come tomorrow, right?

251
00:19:42,977 --> 00:19:45,618
I want to eat Yukata's rice ball.

252
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,553
Stop it. You don't always get your way.

253
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,732
You're a kid, so eat a hamburg
steak quietly like other kids.

254
00:19:49,902 --> 00:19:52,558
No, I don't want a burnt hamburg steak.

255
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:56,612
Then I'll beg Yukata myself.

256
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,064
Hey, stop it.

257
00:19:58,219 --> 00:19:59,131
Tane.

258
00:20:00,705 --> 00:20:01,467
No.

259
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:04,970
You're petty.

260
00:20:11,351 --> 00:20:15,069
(Hozumi Yutaka)

261
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,786
Being the same like before
might be too hard.

262
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,981
Yukata, can you hear me?

263
00:20:50,857 --> 00:20:53,095
Yukata, merry Christmas.

264
00:20:53,317 --> 00:20:55,317
Merry Christmas, Yutaka.

265
00:20:55,728 --> 00:20:57,422
He kept saying,
"This winter, I haven't got to say it."

266
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,125
And, "I want to say it no matter what."

267
00:20:59,481 --> 00:21:01,894
Yukata, are you well now?

268
00:21:03,003 --> 00:21:04,390
Dad also said,

269
00:21:04,424 --> 00:21:06,232
even though we're not
together this year,

270
00:21:06,354 --> 00:21:09,201
next year, let's spend
the time together.

271
00:21:09,377 --> 00:21:10,102
Eh?

272
00:21:10,148 --> 00:21:12,571
Yukata will come next year?

273
00:21:12,586 --> 00:21:14,940
Um, well... If he doesn't mind.

274
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:18,377
The feeling still lingers.

275
00:21:20,282 --> 00:21:23,082
His hand was around
the same size as mine.

276
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:27,486
Also...

277
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:49,642
I can't go back to being the same.

278
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:03,294
(Hozumi Yukie)
(Are you coming home on New Year's Eve?)

279
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:09,829
How should I deal with all these things?

280
00:23:09,966 --> 00:23:10,756
(Next episode)

281
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,000
(Each person's decision...)
You had a fight with Yukata?

282
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,227
Will you be okay
with a long face like that?

283
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,663
(The feeling wanted to be expressed...)
Minoru, you are very important to me.

284
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:20,199
The word "like" is not even enough.

285
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,260
Eh?
