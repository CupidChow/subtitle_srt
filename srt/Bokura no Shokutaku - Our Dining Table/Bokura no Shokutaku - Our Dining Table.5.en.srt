1
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,892
We lost because of you.

2
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,529
Everyone lost because of Minoru.

3
00:00:34,453 --> 00:00:36,403
Minoru, that's enough.

4
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,796
You did it.

5
00:00:58,778 --> 00:01:03,797
It's delicious magic
for the kid who's trying today.

6
00:01:42,722 --> 00:01:44,037
I was dreaming?

7
00:01:53,253 --> 00:01:58,051
(I have work on Saturday. I'll talk
to you again when I have time.)

8
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,764
If you're so picky, you won't grow.

9
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,908
I've already grown up, so that's okay.

10
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:23,110
Yutaka.

11
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:25,479
Bro...

12
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:29,383
He's my older brother.

13
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:31,466
What are you doing in a place like this?

14
00:02:55,526 --> 00:03:00,712
(If something is bothering you,
you can always talk to me.)

15
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,731
(Understood. Do your best at work.)

16
00:03:16,756 --> 00:03:20,403
(OST Design)

17
00:03:21,332 --> 00:03:22,798
Morning.

18
00:03:22,887 --> 00:03:24,472
- Morning.
- Morning.

19
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,519
I've...

20
00:03:40,285 --> 00:03:43,423
never been good
at dealing with my brother.

21
00:03:46,187 --> 00:03:47,360
You have that habit.

22
00:03:47,454 --> 00:03:49,399
You haven't changed at all.

23
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:53,467
You...

24
00:03:54,771 --> 00:03:56,369
don't even know how to eat, do you?

25
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,625
"Our Dining Table"

26
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,133
"Episode 5"

27
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:03,446
Morning.

28
00:05:03,446 --> 00:05:04,467
What's wrong?

29
00:05:04,613 --> 00:05:05,906
You seem down.

30
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:08,187
Oh, yeah, well.

31
00:05:08,845 --> 00:05:13,130
Do you have anything
that can cheer me up instantly?

32
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:14,614
Minoru.

33
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,449
(Happiness Multiplier Set)
That.

34
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:17,717
Our special dish.

35
00:05:17,743 --> 00:05:20,020
Happiness Multiplier Set.

36
00:05:20,436 --> 00:05:22,722
If you eat it, it'll definitely work.

37
00:05:23,582 --> 00:05:25,625
(Ramen shop)
Wow, what a solution.

38
00:05:25,774 --> 00:05:26,561
What did you say?

39
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:27,360
Oh, nothing.

40
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,183
Right, yesterday...

41
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:29,820
Yeah?

42
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,009
A girl came here and asked for you.

43
00:05:33,491 --> 00:05:34,467
A girl?

44
00:05:44,179 --> 00:05:46,232
I have a riddle for you.

45
00:05:46,792 --> 00:05:51,518
What fish is always
the most enthusiastic?

46
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:52,719
A fish?

47
00:05:52,915 --> 00:05:54,120
A fish...

48
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,123
What is it?

49
00:05:57,545 --> 00:06:00,710
The right answer is...

50
00:06:02,605 --> 00:06:04,698
A [sting]ray! [Pun on エイ "Ei", the
interjection of encouragement]

51
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,968
What? That's too hard.
Don't you have an easier one?

52
00:06:07,996 --> 00:06:10,871
Then, next question.

53
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:15,242
Nao.

54
00:06:16,746 --> 00:06:17,744
Sorry.

55
00:06:19,674 --> 00:06:21,471
You never replied.

56
00:06:21,491 --> 00:06:22,782
So I got worried.

57
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:29,789
Please excuse me.

58
00:06:34,448 --> 00:06:36,552
Hey, look, it's a ray.

59
00:06:36,788 --> 00:06:37,664
Stop it.

60
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,933
I have to talk with her about something.

61
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:41,568
Go get a picture book there.

62
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,769
Okay.

63
00:06:56,406 --> 00:06:58,351
When are you coming back to college?

64
00:06:59,606 --> 00:07:01,254
Everyone is worried about you.

65
00:07:04,817 --> 00:07:05,592
Mm.

66
00:07:09,475 --> 00:07:11,698
I shouldn't be the one to say it.

67
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:17,138
But all this time,

68
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:20,774
you've been important to me.

69
00:07:24,756 --> 00:07:29,716
I think you don't have to...
carry your family burden all alone.

70
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:32,585
Minoru...

71
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,854
Look, it's an octopus.

72
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:36,990
Yeah, it's an octopus.

73
00:07:37,984 --> 00:07:39,685
Big sister, you should see it too.

74
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,711
You did it again.

75
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:43,229
Sorry, is your shirt okay?

76
00:07:45,802 --> 00:07:48,702
Big sister, I'm sorry.

77
00:07:52,174 --> 00:07:53,014
Mm.

78
00:07:53,196 --> 00:07:54,374
It's all right.

79
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:04,451
Minoru.

80
00:08:06,341 --> 00:08:09,138
I think you should have your own life.

81
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,538
I'll be waiting at the campus.

82
00:08:43,803 --> 00:08:45,355
Well, Hozumi, I'm off then.

83
00:08:45,355 --> 00:08:46,688
Thank you for all your hard work.

84
00:08:49,304 --> 00:08:50,196
Hey.

85
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:52,632
Hozumi, you don't look very happy.

86
00:08:54,976 --> 00:08:57,570
You should get some good food
and be happy, okay?

87
00:08:57,573 --> 00:08:58,438
I'll get going.

88
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,147
Thank you for all your hard work.

89
00:09:01,147 --> 00:09:02,842
- Thank you for all your hard work.
- Thank you for all your hard work.

90
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:11,284
Good food?

91
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:22,595
Good food...

92
00:09:24,317 --> 00:09:25,598
Um...

93
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,342
What should we buy today?

94
00:09:36,925 --> 00:09:39,779
I want sushi. Tuna, tuna.

95
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,481
Stop talking about expensive stuff.

96
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:42,682
Huh?

97
00:09:45,622 --> 00:09:46,686
Yukata.

98
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:47,654
Yukata?

99
00:09:47,803 --> 00:09:49,722
- Yukata.
- Hey.

100
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,891
Tane.

101
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:56,663
Hi.

102
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:59,065
You don't usually come here
at this time.

103
00:09:59,407 --> 00:10:01,501
Oh, right.

104
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,001
I just thought I didn't want
to make dinner today.

105
00:10:07,895 --> 00:10:08,875
Minoru.

106
00:10:09,369 --> 00:10:10,959
You seem down today.

107
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,581
Oh.

108
00:10:14,917 --> 00:10:16,382
How about you, Yutaka?

109
00:10:16,745 --> 00:10:19,519
You seemed down before.

110
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:32,966
Where's Tane?

111
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,777
Where is he now?

112
00:10:38,992 --> 00:10:40,073
Where?

113
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:41,875
Ta-da!

114
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,411
Don't you want magic?

115
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:48,262
Chicken noodles?

116
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,616
Yeah.

117
00:10:50,132 --> 00:10:51,365
I see.

118
00:10:51,612 --> 00:10:52,685
Magic.

119
00:10:53,482 --> 00:10:55,328
Magic...

120
00:10:55,684 --> 00:10:56,823
All right.

121
00:10:57,611 --> 00:10:59,359
That's what's for dinner.

122
00:10:59,488 --> 00:11:00,260
Let's go.

123
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,228
Let's go!

124
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:02,462
Let's go. Come on.

125
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:03,897
Let's go.

126
00:11:05,773 --> 00:11:07,133
Oh, come on.

127
00:11:10,364 --> 00:11:13,006
My mom used to make this quite often.

128
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:15,241
Yeah.

129
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,409
Yah.

130
00:11:16,805 --> 00:11:17,744
Yeah.

131
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,681
Yah.

132
00:11:18,681 --> 00:11:19,412
How is it?

133
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,248
General Minoru.

134
00:11:22,273 --> 00:11:24,075
I've crushed it to dust.

135
00:11:24,735 --> 00:11:26,052
It's not all crushed yet.

136
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,720
You need to do more around here.

137
00:11:27,752 --> 00:11:32,325
Do this and the "Ei, ya" around here.

138
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:33,593
- Got that?
- Yes.

139
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:34,388
Can you do it?

140
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:35,428
Yes.

141
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,790
Ei, ya, ei, ya...

142
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,834
Ei.

143
00:11:41,964 --> 00:11:43,002
Ya.

144
00:11:44,363 --> 00:11:45,364
Ei.

145
00:11:46,235 --> 00:11:47,207
Ya.

146
00:11:48,402 --> 00:11:49,375
Ei.

147
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,152
You scared me.

148
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,180
Today,

149
00:11:54,263 --> 00:11:58,881
I came up with a special dish
to cheer you up.

150
00:11:58,881 --> 00:12:00,320
A special dish?

151
00:12:00,783 --> 00:12:01,854
It's....

152
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:04,657
ramen and fried rice.

153
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,061
I'll combine two
delicious dishes into one.

154
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,997
And it is called...

155
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,947
Ramen Fried Rice?

156
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,848
Yes.

157
00:12:28,973 --> 00:12:30,878
My mom's special dish.

158
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:31,984
Ramen Fried Rice.

159
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,126
Minoru, look.

160
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:41,661
Look.

161
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:46,633
Fried rice is already
delicious by itself.

162
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,736
But that's not enough.

163
00:12:49,945 --> 00:12:52,168
I'll add ramen too.

164
00:12:52,201 --> 00:12:54,251
Ta-da.

165
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:08,288
Oh.

166
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,523
It smells nice.

167
00:13:14,754 --> 00:13:15,680
Very nice.

168
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,396
Mm.

169
00:13:27,275 --> 00:13:28,541
Thank you.

170
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:37,118
Minoru.

171
00:13:37,132 --> 00:13:39,165
The rising steam is also yummy.

172
00:13:39,248 --> 00:13:41,054
Don't do stupid things. Come help me.

173
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:42,021
Okay.

174
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:43,523
Thanks.

175
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,326
- Here.
- Thank you.

176
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,794
It looks really tasty.

177
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:50,430
All right, then...

178
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:53,633
Thank you for the food.

179
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:03,409
Mmm.

180
00:14:03,905 --> 00:14:04,777
It's yummy.

181
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:05,807
It's very good.

182
00:14:05,807 --> 00:14:06,612
Mmm.

183
00:14:06,861 --> 00:14:08,214
It's good even though
I made it myself.

184
00:14:09,825 --> 00:14:11,084
How is it, Tane?

185
00:14:11,745 --> 00:14:13,098
Yummy.

186
00:14:21,588 --> 00:14:22,514
Mmm.

187
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:25,832
It's delicious.

188
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,004
The magic

189
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:33,639
seems to work really well.

190
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:35,433
Huh?

191
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:39,045
Mom's magic works on Yukata too.

192
00:14:40,188 --> 00:14:41,247
Thank you.

193
00:14:41,275 --> 00:14:42,622
The magic seems to work.

194
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:44,951
Right.

195
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,484
Adding pepper will
make it even better.

196
00:14:46,484 --> 00:14:47,887
Oh, thank you.

197
00:14:48,803 --> 00:14:50,323
I want pepper too.

198
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:52,975
You did it again.

199
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,627
Yutaka, sorry for that.

200
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,930
Yukata, I'm sorry.

201
00:14:58,326 --> 00:14:59,632
It's okay.

202
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:00,800
It'll be fine after I wash it.

203
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,804
Mr. Sorcerer.

204
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:07,940
Shall we do the transformation
and change our stained clothes?

205
00:15:08,176 --> 00:15:10,277
Definitely. Let's do the transformation.

206
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:11,344
All right.

207
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:14,366
Sorry.

208
00:15:14,449 --> 00:15:15,581
No problem.

209
00:15:15,757 --> 00:15:16,582
Okay.

210
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,365
It looks good on you.

211
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,448
Thanks.

212
00:15:35,177 --> 00:15:36,811
Is Mr. Sorcerer asleep?

213
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,538
Yeah, out like a light.

214
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:40,573
Sorry, you were busy.

215
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,674
No, it's all right. It's kind of fun.

216
00:15:46,707 --> 00:15:47,880
So, cheers.

217
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,816
Cheers.

218
00:16:01,147 --> 00:16:03,129
All right, shall we play?

219
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,263
Shall we?

220
00:16:06,888 --> 00:16:07,967
Mine is white, right?

221
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:24,750
What was your mom like?

222
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:27,119
My mom?

223
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,724
Someone who came up
with that delicious dish.

224
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:34,026
What is she like?

225
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:36,329
Right.

226
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:38,297
My mom...

227
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,665
was a cheerful person.

228
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,337
She smiled so much that
we almost forgot she's sick.

229
00:16:50,113 --> 00:16:52,945
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

230
00:17:00,368 --> 00:17:02,188
Yummy.

231
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:05,992
Does the magic work?

232
00:17:06,033 --> 00:17:07,960
Yes, it does.

233
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,643
Actually, Tane...

234
00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:26,979
never got to try the Ramen Fried Rice
that Mom made.

235
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,917
He only knows the one I make.

236
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:37,256
You're like your mother.

237
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,392
Why?

238
00:17:40,595 --> 00:17:41,694
Well...

239
00:17:42,003 --> 00:17:45,064
You always try to cheer me and Tane up.

240
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,100
I do that?

241
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,237
Today,

242
00:17:52,668 --> 00:17:54,140
I feel lucky

243
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:55,408
that we bumped into each other.

244
00:18:03,671 --> 00:18:05,217
Well, Yutaka,

245
00:18:06,511 --> 00:18:08,254
about earlier...

246
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:16,128
Back then...

247
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:18,211
Oh.

248
00:18:18,886 --> 00:18:20,399
What's going on?

249
00:18:20,595 --> 00:18:23,336
If you're drinking, you
should have invited me.

250
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,512
Hello. Sorry to bother you.

251
00:18:24,512 --> 00:18:25,172
Good evening.

252
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:27,773
Stop it, Dad.
Don't you have to teach in the morning?

253
00:18:28,346 --> 00:18:29,314
Stingy.

254
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:30,576
You're stingy, Minoru.

255
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,178
Make yourself at home.

256
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:33,346
Okay, thank you.

257
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:34,102
Bye.

258
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,152
Jeez.

259
00:18:42,952 --> 00:18:44,690
Where were we?

260
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,803
Oh, never mind.

261
00:18:47,817 --> 00:18:50,496
Anyway, it's good that
the magic works on you too.

262
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,748
Yes, it works really well.

263
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,104
There?

264
00:18:59,328 --> 00:19:00,373
Then I'll put it here.

265
00:19:00,621 --> 00:19:01,407
All right.

266
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,477
Eh? What should I do?

267
00:19:12,998 --> 00:19:14,885
It's getting colder.

268
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:17,456
It's getting colder.

269
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:25,237
See you later, then.

270
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:28,467
See you later.

271
00:19:33,281 --> 00:19:34,206
Yutaka.

272
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:35,568
What is it?

273
00:19:35,744 --> 00:19:36,909
Just a sec.

274
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:44,517
Here.

275
00:19:44,986 --> 00:19:46,385
The photo from the other day.

276
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:47,820
Oh.

277
00:19:48,176 --> 00:19:49,188
Thank you.

278
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:11,944
See you later.

279
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,314
See you.

280
00:20:16,712 --> 00:20:18,417
Let's have a meal together again.

281
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,021
See you.

282
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:27,553
Hozumi.

283
00:21:27,582 --> 00:21:29,188
Did something good happen?

284
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,290
Does it seem like it?

285
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:34,827
You had such a big smile on your face.

286
00:21:35,951 --> 00:21:37,296
Oh, no.

287
00:21:37,911 --> 00:21:38,884
Please help with this.

288
00:21:38,884 --> 00:21:40,132
Sorry.

289
00:21:41,096 --> 00:21:41,801
Morning.

290
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:42,768
Morning.

291
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,003
Morning.

292
00:21:53,425 --> 00:21:54,814
- Morning!
- You scared me.

293
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:57,189
You seem very happy today.

294
00:21:58,009 --> 00:22:00,049
Maybe it's because
I had ramen and fried rice.

295
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:02,168
Or did you multiply the happiness?

296
00:22:02,171 --> 00:22:03,622
Yeah, it's been multiplied.

297
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,457
You have chopsticks there?

298
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:06,158
Yes.

299
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:06,992
Okay.

300
00:22:13,847 --> 00:22:19,872
(Happiness Multiplier Set
Extra large ramen to fill your stomach)

301
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:10,856
(Next episode)

302
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:11,843
Even though I have grown up,

303
00:23:11,843 --> 00:23:14,609
(At the end of the year, Christmas is different.)
I still can't enjoy Christmas.

304
00:23:14,609 --> 00:23:16,562
(At the end of the year, Christmas is different.)
This is for you. It's an invitation.

305
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:18,330
Christmas party...

306
00:23:19,007 --> 00:23:21,800
An important day should be spent
with an important person.

307
00:23:23,113 --> 00:23:23,973
Hey...
