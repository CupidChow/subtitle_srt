1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,405
What are you wearing?

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,080
Hmm?

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,674
If you don't hurry up, we'll be late.

4
00:00:07,956 --> 00:00:11,245
You're not dressed yet, Tane?
Come on, get up.

5
00:00:11,421 --> 00:00:12,589
Hold on to me.

6
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:13,714
Here.

7
00:00:14,062 --> 00:00:14,882
Here.

8
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:15,849
Minoru, what about breakfast?

9
00:00:16,102 --> 00:00:17,050
No time to eat.

10
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:17,818
All right.

11
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:18,986
Done.

12
00:00:20,036 --> 00:00:20,888
Okay.

13
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:21,955
Let's go to school.

14
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,358
No.

15
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,192
Okay, let's go.

16
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,845
Okay, be careful and be safe.

17
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:34,222
Mom, I'm leaving now. Tane, you too.

18
00:00:34,222 --> 00:00:35,275
I'm leaving now.

19
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:36,270
All right. We're leaving.

20
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,504
Okay, be careful.

21
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:42,278
Well, today, they're lively as usual.

22
00:00:42,303 --> 00:00:43,343
Mika.

23
00:01:33,797 --> 00:01:39,234
"Our Dining Table"

24
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,011
"Episode 2"

25
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:57,787
(October)
(OST Design)

26
00:01:58,196 --> 00:02:00,441
I want curry.

27
00:02:01,074 --> 00:02:02,654
Okay, curry it is, then.

28
00:02:02,974 --> 00:02:04,324
Curry it is, then.

29
00:02:04,327 --> 00:02:06,693
Oh, curry? That's good.

30
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:27,381
(Ramen)
Sorry I'm late.

31
00:02:28,717 --> 00:02:30,871
Tane said he wouldn't last
before he got to the school toilets.

32
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:32,085
We had to stop on the way.

33
00:02:33,056 --> 00:02:33,983
It's okay.

34
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:34,955
Thank you.

35
00:02:35,038 --> 00:02:36,156
Did you...

36
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:40,761
take a break from university
to look after Tane?

37
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:41,528
Yes.

38
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:42,488
That must be difficult.

39
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:46,609
Your dad is still around.
He should be able to look after him.

40
00:02:46,622 --> 00:02:49,308
No, he's doing his part.

41
00:02:49,315 --> 00:02:51,391
I do what I want to do.

42
00:02:52,244 --> 00:02:53,379
That's admirable.

43
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,098
But you're young. Actually, you
also want to have more fun, right?

44
00:02:57,114 --> 00:02:59,880
Yeah, I guess that's true.

45
00:03:00,195 --> 00:03:01,281
Still,

46
00:03:01,677 --> 00:03:03,016
it's my family.

47
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,052
What are we going to eat today?

48
00:03:11,052 --> 00:03:13,135
Huh? It's yakisoba.

49
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:14,577
Again?

50
00:03:14,577 --> 00:03:16,029
It can't be helped.

51
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,270
Dad has only had a few classes.

52
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:21,501
Hey, what about Yukata's curry?

53
00:03:22,162 --> 00:03:24,093
Didn't I tell you it's Saturday?

54
00:03:24,113 --> 00:03:26,907
I really want to eat Yukata's curry.

55
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,871
Curry.

56
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,178
Are you hungry?

57
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:33,142
Didn't you have snacks at school?

58
00:03:33,163 --> 00:03:34,014
Yeah.

59
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:34,964
What did you eat?

60
00:03:34,996 --> 00:03:35,849
Cicadas.

61
00:03:37,207 --> 00:03:38,118
Cicadas?

62
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:39,286
Yes, cicadas.

63
00:03:39,475 --> 00:03:42,389
Ci... Ci... Cicadas.

64
00:03:48,589 --> 00:03:50,063
After he's done eating, he sleeps.

65
00:03:50,089 --> 00:03:51,565
What a simple creature.

66
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:54,468
This

67
00:03:54,796 --> 00:03:56,609
is the Yukata that came the other day?

68
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,804
It's "Yutaka."

69
00:03:57,887 --> 00:03:59,539
He'll come again this week, right?

70
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,942
Yeah, I think he's coming
to make curry for us.

71
00:04:02,257 --> 00:04:04,444
It seems Tane really can't wait.

72
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,300
He's really looking forward to it.

73
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,147
Yeah.

74
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:09,282
He's probably very happy.

75
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:12,284
All right.

76
00:04:12,331 --> 00:04:13,620
I'll take him to bed.

77
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:16,585
All right.

78
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,793
Minoru is looking forward to it too.

79
00:04:39,258 --> 00:04:42,863
(Yukata, Tane, Brother)

80
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:47,086
Good work.

81
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:48,437
Good work.

82
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:02,701
(Ueda Minoru)

83
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:09,898
Hello?

84
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,879
- Yutaka, sorry to disturb you.

85
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:14,381
Are you working?

86
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,151
Yes, I haven't finished yet.

87
00:05:18,453 --> 00:05:19,786
What's the matter?

88
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:21,728
Well, you see...

89
00:05:21,753 --> 00:05:23,456
Yukata.

90
00:05:24,393 --> 00:05:25,625
- Tane.

91
00:05:27,904 --> 00:05:30,497
Can we start earlier tomorrow?

92
00:05:31,437 --> 00:05:33,934
I will wake up so early in the morning.

93
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,570
Earlier? Are you talking about
our meeting time?

94
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,437
- Yeah.

95
00:05:37,674 --> 00:05:41,041
- Stop it, Tane. Give it to me.
I said give it to me.

96
00:05:41,784 --> 00:05:43,731
Sorry for being inconsiderate.

97
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,713
- It's all right. Any time is fine for me.

98
00:05:47,035 --> 00:05:47,995
- But why?

99
00:05:48,742 --> 00:05:51,084
Tane said he can't wait to see you.

100
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:56,192
Come early tomorrow.
You have to come early tomorrow.

101
00:05:56,192 --> 00:05:57,824
All right, got it.

102
00:05:57,867 --> 00:06:00,594
That's how it is. He really can't wait.

103
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,333
Then, I'll be there around ten o'clock.

104
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:08,455
Okay, thank you so much.

105
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:10,370
Please take care of us. Okay.

106
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:38,865
Let's go, Tane. Yutaka is waiting.

107
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:49,676
What are you doing?
Aren't you looking forward to this?

108
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,649
Minoru.

109
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,318
Tane?

110
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:09,562
Hello?

111
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:11,564
Yutaka.

112
00:07:11,647 --> 00:07:13,733
I'm really sorry for not answering.

113
00:07:14,704 --> 00:07:16,603
It's okay. Is something wrong?

114
00:07:18,184 --> 00:07:19,339
It might be difficult

115
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:21,641
to make curry today.

116
00:07:33,016 --> 00:07:34,487
Yutaka.

117
00:07:34,532 --> 00:07:36,564
I'm really sorry.

118
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,024
Please don't be.

119
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,659
But...

120
00:07:39,742 --> 00:07:42,295
we even asked you to come earlier.

121
00:07:42,986 --> 00:07:44,898
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

122
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,007
Here.

123
00:07:47,656 --> 00:07:48,802
I'm so sorry.

124
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,270
Thank you.

125
00:07:51,606 --> 00:07:53,206
How is Tane?

126
00:07:53,695 --> 00:07:56,042
Um... Well...

127
00:08:00,407 --> 00:08:02,349
Yukata.

128
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,718
Tane, are you all right?

129
00:08:05,745 --> 00:08:07,550
He's always like this. He's okay.

130
00:08:07,572 --> 00:08:09,122
He'll feel better
after he gets some sleep.

131
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:20,145
Yukata.

132
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:22,068
Are you going back now?

133
00:08:22,991 --> 00:08:25,338
I'll stay until you're better.

134
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:29,909
He always gets a fever
before an activity.

135
00:08:30,312 --> 00:08:31,280
An activity?

136
00:08:31,287 --> 00:08:32,212
Yes.

137
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:34,278
When there's something
he's really looking forward to,

138
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,942
he'll get so excited
that he gets a fever.

139
00:08:39,305 --> 00:08:40,777
That's too bad,

140
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:42,689
but it's kinda cute.

141
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,760
He was really looking forward
to the curry.

142
00:08:47,603 --> 00:08:49,195
I see.

143
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,062
We will definitely
make it together later.

144
00:08:58,438 --> 00:08:59,973
You're so kind.

145
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,604
No.

146
00:09:06,758 --> 00:09:11,418
I mean, kids get sick so often, right?

147
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:15,288
Even if we have set a date, there are
many times that we have to cancel it.

148
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,291
But that can't be helped, right?

149
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:21,428
Yes, I guess it can't be helped.

150
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:22,996
That's true.

151
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,632
But a lot of people
don't understand that.

152
00:09:27,556 --> 00:09:28,768
So...

153
00:09:28,871 --> 00:09:31,538
When you said that, it really helped.

154
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:35,742
Minoru...

155
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:40,980
Tane, what's wrong?

156
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,230
I'm hungry.

157
00:09:47,381 --> 00:09:50,990
Oh, no. We ran out of everything.

158
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:55,851
I usually have udon when I'm sick.

159
00:09:55,898 --> 00:09:56,930
I see.

160
00:09:57,938 --> 00:10:01,436
It's a bother to go out and buy stuff.

161
00:10:01,436 --> 00:10:03,095
Cooking rice also takes time.

162
00:10:03,483 --> 00:10:06,606
Right. Is there anything left?

163
00:10:10,645 --> 00:10:11,867
Let's use this.

164
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:18,272
(Porridge)

165
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,104
Are you the cook here, Minoru?

166
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:23,156
No, my dad and I take turns cooking.

167
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,326
Sometimes, an old lady who lives
near here cooks and brings us food.

168
00:10:26,651 --> 00:10:27,877
I see.

169
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,029
Because both my dad and I
are terrible at cooking.

170
00:10:30,112 --> 00:10:31,806
She's so worried.

171
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,297
Plus, we also don't know much
about nutritional balance.

172
00:10:39,946 --> 00:10:41,908
Let's have porridge with...

173
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:45,945
pickled plums, then.

174
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,381
Tane likes pickled plums?

175
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:49,716
No, he hates it.

176
00:10:50,178 --> 00:10:51,985
But it's all we have.

177
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:53,987
Then...

178
00:10:54,557 --> 00:10:57,357
Should we try modifying it a bit?

179
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,858
Modifying it?

180
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,562
May I?

181
00:11:01,562 --> 00:11:02,395
Okay.

182
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:11,591
Pour the whisked egg

183
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,807
onto the porridge.

184
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,186
Then,

185
00:11:27,108 --> 00:11:30,890
tear crab sticks we found in the fridge
into thin stripes and put them in.

186
00:11:32,404 --> 00:11:34,994
Season with salt.

187
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:41,507
Now, the simple egg porridge is ready.

188
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:43,252
Amazing.

189
00:11:43,672 --> 00:11:45,646
It's not that great.

190
00:11:45,646 --> 00:11:47,307
No, it's amazing.

191
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:52,946
If I could do something like this,
Tane would be so happy.

192
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:57,770
I think I have to learn
how to cook better.

193
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,753
I have to try harder.

194
00:12:01,727 --> 00:12:04,224
Well, sometimes,

195
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:06,893
trying to do something amazing

196
00:12:08,197 --> 00:12:09,429
kind of feels...

197
00:12:09,717 --> 00:12:11,150
a little tiring.

198
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:24,844
What is it?

199
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:28,481
Sorry. I felt as if you were Tane,
so I got carried away.

200
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,284
As if I were Tane?

201
00:12:32,342 --> 00:12:34,220
No, I mean...

202
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,626
Because you're trying.

203
00:12:48,314 --> 00:12:50,483
You're trying, Minoru.

204
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:54,507
Right,

205
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,510
you're probably worried
about nutrition and the balance.

206
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,994
But those things are hard.

207
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:03,116
I think you can let the grandma
take care of it for now.

208
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,020
But...

209
00:13:09,144 --> 00:13:10,290
Minoru.

210
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,660
You always think about Tane, right?

211
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,928
Well...

212
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,247
It's because we're family.

213
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:19,932
I think

214
00:13:20,322 --> 00:13:23,936
it's enough if you feel like that.

215
00:13:31,764 --> 00:13:32,879
Back then,

216
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:35,415
when we ate the rice balls together,

217
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:40,086
Tane seemed

218
00:13:40,642 --> 00:13:43,717
very happy that he got to eat with you.

219
00:13:53,302 --> 00:13:54,500
So...

220
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,637
if you can have fun eating with Tane,

221
00:13:57,986 --> 00:13:59,872
isn't that good enough?

222
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:03,876
Fun?

223
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:08,314
Even if

224
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:11,351
you have a luxury meal every day,

225
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:25,064
if you can't smile while you eat it,
that's more painful.

226
00:14:33,365 --> 00:14:34,640
Is that...

227
00:14:35,276 --> 00:14:36,642
your story?

228
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,416
Yukata, Minoru.

229
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,452
Tane, you're awake?

230
00:14:51,178 --> 00:14:53,326
It smells so good.

231
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,641
Wanna eat now?

232
00:14:56,177 --> 00:14:57,009
Yeah.

233
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,402
Wow.

234
00:15:02,428 --> 00:15:04,237
Looks yummy.

235
00:15:04,892 --> 00:15:06,939
Alright, you seem okay now.

236
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,232
I'll eat now.

237
00:15:28,397 --> 00:15:29,829
It's yummy.

238
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:31,998
That's a relief.

239
00:15:47,165 --> 00:15:49,070
It's very yummy.

240
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,510
Where is the, "Thank you for the food"?

241
00:15:50,823 --> 00:15:52,023
Thank you for the food.

242
00:15:52,023 --> 00:15:52,803
All right.

243
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,557
Tane is back to his happy self.

244
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,497
I'll eat Yukata's curry too.

245
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,732
You'll get diarrhea
if you eat that kind of food.

246
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,650
Let's have curry another day, okay?

247
00:16:09,517 --> 00:16:11,724
But since we talked about curry,

248
00:16:11,724 --> 00:16:13,197
now I kind of want some curry.

249
00:16:13,796 --> 00:16:15,208
Shall we have instant curry?

250
00:16:15,597 --> 00:16:16,572
No.

251
00:16:16,681 --> 00:16:19,712
We have to eat the curry made by Yukata.

252
00:16:19,727 --> 00:16:21,881
Yeah, you can't just
make it quick, right?

253
00:16:21,894 --> 00:16:23,964
- Yeah.
- But I'm hungry now.

254
00:16:23,973 --> 00:16:24,919
Tane.

255
00:16:25,002 --> 00:16:27,320
Oh, Tane. Are you all right?

256
00:16:27,346 --> 00:16:28,638
Are you all right, Tane?

257
00:16:28,651 --> 00:16:30,251
Dad, I can't breathe.

258
00:16:30,251 --> 00:16:31,944
It feels awful, right? Are you okay?

259
00:16:31,944 --> 00:16:33,901
I'm back. You're going to be okay.

260
00:16:33,924 --> 00:16:36,095
Easy. His fever is lower now.

261
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,564
Is that so? Okay.

262
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:39,632
I see.

263
00:16:39,847 --> 00:16:42,034
Then you must be hungry.

264
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,850
I bought a lot of stuff. Here.

265
00:16:45,076 --> 00:16:47,849
Here, I have udon too.

266
00:16:47,884 --> 00:16:49,885
We just had that.

267
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,946
Yukata made yummy porridge for me too.

268
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,216
What should we do now?

269
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:00,052
Udon is fine, but why did you
buy so much instant porridge?

270
00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:02,221
What should we do now?

271
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:06,893
If so...

272
00:17:10,455 --> 00:17:12,589
Are we going to get swollen
with porridge?

273
00:17:12,754 --> 00:17:14,166
It's fine.

274
00:17:14,323 --> 00:17:16,669
Let's have these dishes
with the porridge.

275
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,506
Instant food with instant food.

276
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,241
I've never thought about this before.

277
00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:25,511
Oh, everyone, we have this too.

278
00:17:25,535 --> 00:17:27,446
Let's have it with everything.

279
00:17:28,104 --> 00:17:29,949
So, for Tane,

280
00:17:30,012 --> 00:17:33,252
enjoy this canned fruit as dessert.

281
00:17:33,276 --> 00:17:35,276
Yay! Special meal.

282
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,357
Special meal? It's just instant food
and canned food.

283
00:17:38,381 --> 00:17:40,326
Instant food and canned food,

284
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,242
when placed together on the table,
are excellent ingredients.

285
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,518
Good.

286
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:47,208
It's an instant food party today.

287
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,735
Party!

288
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,170
So...

289
00:17:51,194 --> 00:17:53,194
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

290
00:17:53,218 --> 00:17:55,082
It's hot.

291
00:17:55,106 --> 00:17:56,309
Let your brother do it for you.

292
00:17:58,595 --> 00:18:00,042
Tane, you like corn, right?

293
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:01,147
Get the corn too.

294
00:18:01,389 --> 00:18:02,548
Get it yourself.

295
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,450
Tane, give me the plate.

296
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:05,790
It's good to do this sometimes.

297
00:18:05,814 --> 00:18:06,819
Yeah.

298
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,055
By the way,

299
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:11,891
Yutaka, are you
Minoru's friend from college?

300
00:18:11,915 --> 00:18:14,293
Oh, no. I work.

301
00:18:14,317 --> 00:18:16,996
Oh, how old are you, Yutaka?

302
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,307
I'm 23 years old.

303
00:18:18,332 --> 00:18:20,658
Oh, you're the same age
as Minoru, then.

304
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,769
Really?

305
00:18:23,793 --> 00:18:25,530
I thought you must be older than me.

306
00:18:25,554 --> 00:18:27,740
I also thought you're younger than me.

307
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,149
No way, seriously?

308
00:18:29,489 --> 00:18:32,740
How should I put it?
You seem calm, or maybe tired.

309
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,666
Tired?

310
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,414
So, should we speak informally?

311
00:18:35,902 --> 00:18:37,056
Can I drop the honorifics?

312
00:18:37,189 --> 00:18:38,384
Yeah, okay.

313
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,408
Then you can call me "Minoru"
without the honorifics.

314
00:18:41,471 --> 00:18:42,572
Mino...

315
00:18:48,135 --> 00:18:49,119
Ru.

316
00:18:49,811 --> 00:18:52,264
Wait. Is it that hard to say?

317
00:18:52,475 --> 00:18:54,516
Uh... No.

318
00:18:54,543 --> 00:18:55,568
Well...

319
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,771
I don't usually call my friends
only by their names.

320
00:19:01,031 --> 00:19:02,074
Mino...

321
00:19:04,506 --> 00:19:05,378
Minoru.

322
00:19:05,402 --> 00:19:06,946
Wait. What was that?

323
00:19:07,457 --> 00:19:08,411
Nothing.

324
00:19:09,485 --> 00:19:11,283
I was basically calling your name.

325
00:19:14,035 --> 00:19:15,655
You're really unusual.

326
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,672
I'll just call you "Yukata" too.

327
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:21,259
I told you it's not Yukata.
His name is "Yutaka."

328
00:19:21,284 --> 00:19:22,497
Yukata.

329
00:19:22,522 --> 00:19:23,729
Yutaka.

330
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,164
Yukata.

331
00:19:25,188 --> 00:19:26,365
It's Yutaka.

332
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:28,134
- Yukata.
- Yutaka.

333
00:19:28,158 --> 00:19:29,902
- It's Yukata.
- Yutaka.

334
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,758
He's super happy again.

335
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,509
To the point of being too loud.

336
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,112
Yutaka, thank you for today.

337
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:43,416
And sorry for saying something weird.

338
00:19:43,657 --> 00:19:45,418
That's totally fine.

339
00:19:46,197 --> 00:19:47,453
It's just...

340
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,757
I'm not that capable of a person.
I might not be reliable to you.

341
00:19:54,764 --> 00:19:55,928
Yutaka,

342
00:19:56,256 --> 00:19:57,697
having you here is enough.

343
00:20:05,227 --> 00:20:06,822
Tane is happy.

344
00:20:08,351 --> 00:20:09,442
So am I.

345
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:16,346
Yukata.

346
00:20:17,047 --> 00:20:19,403
This one is pretty. I'll give it to you.

347
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,787
I'm glad. Thank you.

348
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,022
Mm.

349
00:20:23,663 --> 00:20:26,362
Yukata, when are we going to meet again?

350
00:20:30,944 --> 00:20:33,399
Next time should be next week.

351
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:36,068
Shall we have a meal here every weekend?

352
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:41,208
Right. Yukata, you can just live here.

353
00:21:03,268 --> 00:21:04,497
Yutaka,

354
00:21:04,817 --> 00:21:06,332
having you here is enough.

355
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,201
Yukata, when are we going to meet again?

356
00:21:55,261 --> 00:21:57,249
You're trying, Minoru.

357
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,363
I knew it.

358
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:13,444
Yukata is that person from back then.

359
00:23:09,992 --> 00:23:11,677
(Next episode)

360
00:23:10,861 --> 00:23:12,731
Can you put octopus in it?

361
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:13,740
(A gift full of feelings)

362
00:23:12,755 --> 00:23:13,716
Octopus?

363
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,696
(for an important person)

364
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,589
Octopus.

365
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:16,700
I hope the boy will be happy with it.

366
00:23:16,914 --> 00:23:20,984
(The feeling of growing closer)

367
00:23:18,032 --> 00:23:20,984
Actually, I have something to say.

368
00:23:21,305 --> 00:23:22,534
(This story is a work of fiction)

369
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,507
What?

370
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,013
(Characters and organizations
appearing in this work are fictitious)
