1
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,584
(Yukie - What about this week?
Are you not coming home?)

2
00:00:45,608 --> 00:00:46,747
Yutaka.

3
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:50,284
From now on,
you are a member of our family.

4
00:00:50,682 --> 00:00:52,419
Think of us as your real family.

5
00:00:53,372 --> 00:00:55,523
This is your home.

00:01:56,007 --> 00:02:01,488
"Our Dining Table"

00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:02,388
(OST Design)

00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:06,888
"Episode 4"

9
00:02:07,523 --> 00:02:12,799
(Yukie - What about this week?
Are you not coming home?)

10
00:02:12,823 --> 00:02:14,267
So, what about lunch?

11
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:16,470
How about that set meal restaurant?

12
00:02:16,494 --> 00:02:19,106
Well... We'll have to queue up there.

13
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:21,541
Then ramen.

14
00:02:21,692 --> 00:02:23,046
You always have ramen.

15
00:02:23,046 --> 00:02:23,854
So, no?

16
00:02:23,854 --> 00:02:25,125
Hozumi.

17
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:28,081
Mr. Ishiwatari asked
if we can start the meeting at 2 p.m.

18
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,518
Oh, yes, we can.

19
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,153
Then I'll book the meeting room.

20
00:02:33,177 --> 00:02:34,588
- Thank you.
- Okay.

21
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:47,100
This is super yummy.

22
00:02:47,124 --> 00:02:48,935
I made it myself.

23
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,439
Really? Man, you are a genius.

24
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:54,074
What are you eating?

25
00:02:54,128 --> 00:02:57,110
Don't take his important rice ball
just because you want it.

26
00:02:58,634 --> 00:02:59,710
(Ueda pottery workshop)

27
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,830
You're Minoru's friend?

28
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,682
No.

29
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,685
Minoru is inside. You can go ahead.

30
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,919
Well...

31
00:03:08,177 --> 00:03:09,089
Well...

32
00:03:09,377 --> 00:03:10,972
Please allow me.

33
00:03:10,997 --> 00:03:13,352
Oh, it's Mr. Rice Ball.

34
00:03:13,384 --> 00:03:14,861
My name is Ueda Minoru.

35
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:16,075
And this guy...

36
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:16,846
I'm Tane.

37
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:18,799
Tane, it's nice to meet you.

38
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,319
It smells great.

39
00:03:21,343 --> 00:03:22,769
It looks yummy.

40
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,504
Yummy.

41
00:03:24,528 --> 00:03:25,906
Yummy.

42
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:28,169
Yukata, you should eat with us.

43
00:03:28,193 --> 00:03:32,079
I'm not good at
eating around other people.

44
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,547
It's the one I made.

45
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,045
Eat it.

46
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,660
It's good.

47
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:48,662
Yutaka,

48
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:50,530
having you here is enough.

49
00:04:17,283 --> 00:04:19,757
(Minoru - We're having stew today.
Want some?)

50
00:04:25,351 --> 00:04:30,379
(Yes. Thank you.)

51
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:33,032
(Are you busy right now?)

52
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,187
Sorry. Have you been waiting for long?

53
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:50,357
Not at all.

54
00:04:50,662 --> 00:04:52,511
I also wanted to see you.

55
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:54,771
Oh, sorry. Tane is not with me.

56
00:04:54,907 --> 00:04:56,196
He's at school.

57
00:04:56,618 --> 00:04:58,618
Even though Tane isn't here,
I'm still glad.

58
00:05:03,076 --> 00:05:04,204
What's wrong?

59
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:06,773
Right, here.

60
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,825
A grandma made them.

61
00:05:09,044 --> 00:05:11,486
Sweet taro stew and lotus root kinpira.

62
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,246
Wow, amazing.

63
00:05:14,778 --> 00:05:16,416
She said thank you
for always taking care of us.

64
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,419
I'm so happy. Thank you.

65
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:22,556
Well...

66
00:05:22,692 --> 00:05:23,690
See you later, then.

67
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,594
Since you're here,
shall we have lunch together?

68
00:05:27,956 --> 00:05:29,162
If you have time.

69
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:41,608
You can have the rice ball.

70
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,143
Okay, thank you.

71
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:52,085
Thank you for the food.

72
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,446
Thank you for the food.

73
00:05:56,269 --> 00:05:57,237
Mm.

74
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,566
It's so good. What is it?

75
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,253
It's a new one.

76
00:06:01,369 --> 00:06:02,693
Spam and wasabi mayo.

77
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:05,469
What a good combination.

78
00:06:05,502 --> 00:06:07,033
I'm relieved.

79
00:06:10,252 --> 00:06:12,505
This one is also good. Thank you.

80
00:06:18,971 --> 00:06:20,751
Thank you for what you've done.

81
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:24,985
The lunchboxes and those things.

82
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:27,520
Tane was very happy.

83
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,904
And since then,

84
00:06:29,904 --> 00:06:31,918
we've just been playing in the zoo at home.

85
00:06:33,446 --> 00:06:35,215
It's very fun.

86
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,398
You should come again,

87
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,001
and let's make something to eat.

88
00:06:41,523 --> 00:06:42,335
Okay.

89
00:06:43,206 --> 00:06:44,704
How about this Sunday?

90
00:06:44,753 --> 00:06:46,719
I'm free. What should we make?

91
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:48,575
Let me think...

92
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:50,810
Curry?

93
00:06:51,294 --> 00:06:52,746
We couldn't make it last time.

94
00:06:52,774 --> 00:06:53,747
That's great.

95
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:55,115
Then...

96
00:06:55,364 --> 00:06:57,317
This Sunday, let's have
a rematch with curry.

97
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:00,287
A rematch with curry.

98
00:07:02,524 --> 00:07:04,371
- What was that?
- That's kind of embarrassing.

99
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:05,424
I'm embarrassed.

100
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:27,280
Thank you for the food.

101
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:03,416
Can you also put octopus in it?

102
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:05,051
Octopus?

103
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:05,909
Octopus.

104
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:07,620
Mr. Octopus Sausage?

105
00:08:07,776 --> 00:08:09,776
Yeah, Mr. Octopus Sausage.

106
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,497
- Octopus.
- No.

107
00:08:11,517 --> 00:08:12,926
- Octopus.
- No.

108
00:08:13,203 --> 00:08:15,397
Let's just make it.
With Mr. Octopus Sausage too.

109
00:08:16,426 --> 00:08:18,426
Yutaka, you can make lunchboxes too?

110
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:20,562
Yeah.

111
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:23,620
Really? That's amazing.

112
00:08:23,622 --> 00:08:25,038
Amazing.

113
00:08:28,122 --> 00:08:31,060
Can you teach me how to make a lunchbox?

114
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:32,566
Of course, I'll help you.

115
00:08:32,689 --> 00:08:35,015
I hope the boy will be happy with it.

116
00:08:45,548 --> 00:08:48,728
Wow, amazing.

117
00:08:49,951 --> 00:08:51,458
Yummy.

118
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,758
Really?

119
00:08:53,611 --> 00:08:54,947
That's a relief.

120
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,648
I never thought eating with someone

121
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:11,518
would make me so happy.

122
00:09:14,183 --> 00:09:16,089
Back then, I never knew.

123
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,321
Tane, it's been a while.

124
00:09:48,347 --> 00:09:50,658
Yukata.

125
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:53,426
Finally, we're going to make curry.
Curry.

126
00:09:53,472 --> 00:09:54,318
That's right.

127
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,563
All right, let's go.

128
00:09:57,061 --> 00:10:02,948
(Daily Mart)
Curry...

129
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,471
What's that song?

130
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:06,372
It's the curry song!

131
00:10:06,456 --> 00:10:07,662
The curry song?

132
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,414
Do you want to add sweet potatoes?

133
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,991
Yes.

134
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,951
Isn't it weird to add sweet potatoes?

135
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:23,106
I once got sweet potatoes from
my landlord when I was making curry,

136
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:25,091
so I added them and it was good.

137
00:10:26,981 --> 00:10:30,526
I've dug up sweet potatoes myself.

138
00:10:30,558 --> 00:10:31,498
Really?

139
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:32,499
That was taro...

140
00:10:33,952 --> 00:10:37,893
And I got one this big.

141
00:10:37,902 --> 00:10:39,606
That's exaggerating.

142
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,242
Tane, what do you like?

143
00:10:43,349 --> 00:10:45,478
Pumpkin...

144
00:10:45,581 --> 00:10:47,480
Cheese...

145
00:10:48,494 --> 00:10:49,816
And pea shoots.

146
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:51,417
Pea shoots?

147
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:53,042
You have good taste.

148
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,222
He tried it at the restaurant
where I work part-time.

149
00:10:56,542 --> 00:10:58,191
Is it a ramen place?

150
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,092
Yeah.

151
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,495
What do you like, Minoru?

152
00:11:03,114 --> 00:11:05,365
Well, nothing in particular.

153
00:11:06,526 --> 00:11:08,334
So, what do you not like?

154
00:11:08,523 --> 00:11:11,571
He hates shiitake mushrooms.

155
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:12,746
Shiitake mushrooms?

156
00:11:12,753 --> 00:11:14,590
Don't expose me.

157
00:11:14,604 --> 00:11:17,143
If you're so picky, you won't grow.

158
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,290
I have already grown up, so that's okay.

159
00:11:27,782 --> 00:11:28,922
Yutaka?

160
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,759
Bro...

161
00:11:41,584 --> 00:11:43,836
He's my older brother.

162
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,239
Hello.

163
00:11:48,101 --> 00:11:50,543
My new friend...

164
00:11:50,572 --> 00:11:52,445
What are you doing in a place like this?

165
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,139
I'm here to buy stuff.

166
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:56,516
Anyway, why didn't you go yesterday?

167
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,354
It's Dad's 60th birthday.

168
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,156
Didn't you get a message from Mom too?

169
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:10,456
(Yukie - What about this week?
Are you not coming home?)

170
00:12:18,454 --> 00:12:21,674
I see that you still haven't
changed whatsoever.

171
00:12:24,506 --> 00:12:27,013
Fine, I'll tell them,
"You're still alive."

172
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,700
Minoru, I want to use the toilet.

173
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:51,137
Does it have to be right now?

174
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:54,207
Jeez.

175
00:12:54,575 --> 00:12:56,842
Sorry, Yutaka. I'll be right back.

176
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,555
Minoru, hurry.

177
00:12:59,555 --> 00:13:00,513
Got it.

178
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:01,881
Hurry up.

179
00:13:07,526 --> 00:13:08,621
Yutaka.

180
00:13:09,324 --> 00:13:11,991
From now on,
you are a member of our family.

181
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:13,593
Think of us as your real family.

182
00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:16,562
This is your home now.

183
00:13:16,956 --> 00:13:17,964
Huh?

184
00:13:18,775 --> 00:13:19,899
I won't accept that.

185
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:23,336
Hey.

186
00:13:23,766 --> 00:13:27,220
I don't want
a little brother.

187
00:14:18,661 --> 00:14:19,592
You...

188
00:14:21,021 --> 00:14:22,562
don't even know how to eat, do you?

189
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,164
Yuki.

190
00:14:26,813 --> 00:14:29,268
When he's around,
the food suddenly tastes bad.

191
00:14:32,793 --> 00:14:34,707
By the way, how were your finals?

192
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:36,709
I got the eighth place in class.

193
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,612
You did a good job.

194
00:14:39,841 --> 00:14:40,913
No.

195
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:42,938
I've dropped two places.

196
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:45,618
But at the parents' meeting,
the teachers kept praising you.

197
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,931
Yukata, I finished peeling.

198
00:14:59,786 --> 00:15:01,734
Right, great job.

199
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,116
Yeah, I peeled all these myself.

200
00:15:05,516 --> 00:15:06,873
That's amazing.

201
00:15:07,696 --> 00:15:09,742
Good, now, we need meat.

202
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:12,145
We usually use pork here.

203
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:15,448
But each family has their own ways
of picking what meat to put in curry.

204
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,287
What about your family?

205
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:27,967
I want beef.

206
00:15:28,146 --> 00:15:29,745
No, beef is expensive.

207
00:15:35,663 --> 00:15:36,769
Yutaka...

208
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,405
If you put chocolate in curry,
it'll taste better.

209
00:15:39,837 --> 00:15:41,590
- Eh? Chocolate?
- Yeah.

210
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:43,109
It's a secret flavor.

211
00:15:43,724 --> 00:15:46,145
A secret flavor?

212
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,823
(Ueda)

213
00:16:15,444 --> 00:16:17,243
Bye-bye.

214
00:16:17,764 --> 00:16:19,326
It will take 15 minutes.

215
00:16:20,102 --> 00:16:21,180
That's fast.

216
00:16:21,263 --> 00:16:22,489
No, we have to put
the curry cube in first.

217
00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:23,616
Then, wait for ten minutes.

218
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:24,484
So long.

219
00:16:25,658 --> 00:16:27,690
Something fell here. I'll put it in.

220
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:45,227
All right...

221
00:16:46,065 --> 00:16:48,123
Thank you for the food.

222
00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:02,147
Yummy.

223
00:17:03,002 --> 00:17:04,757
Minoru, you're great at making curry.

224
00:17:05,921 --> 00:17:07,059
- No.
- Right?

225
00:17:07,182 --> 00:17:08,027
Yeah.

226
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:09,894
You're a genius.

227
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,932
No, I just followed
the instruction on the box.

228
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,000
He's a genius, right?

229
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,834
Yeah.

230
00:17:15,023 --> 00:17:16,302
It's very good.

231
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,604
Yummy.

232
00:17:21,102 --> 00:17:22,535
- It tastes good, right?
- Yeah.

233
00:17:24,453 --> 00:17:25,529
Can I more?

234
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:26,961
You should ask, "Can I have more?"

235
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:28,381
Pork really goes well with it.

236
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:30,149
The sweet potato is good too.

237
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,017
Really?

238
00:17:31,298 --> 00:17:32,569
How much more do you want?

239
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:33,853
This much.

240
00:17:33,956 --> 00:17:35,154
What does that mean?

241
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,763
I'm so full.

242
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:44,997
So full, right?

243
00:17:45,286 --> 00:17:46,933
Try touching it.

244
00:17:47,381 --> 00:17:48,301
Where?

245
00:17:48,603 --> 00:17:49,969
Right.

246
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:51,404
Your tummy is so full!

247
00:17:55,087 --> 00:17:56,909
That brother of yours we met today,

248
00:17:58,552 --> 00:18:00,713
both of you really don't look alike.

249
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,751
Does he live around here?

250
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:19,965
Smells so nice.

251
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,000
You scared me.

252
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,858
Please allow me.

253
00:18:21,858 --> 00:18:22,868
Oh, hello.

254
00:18:23,138 --> 00:18:25,204
Please let me join.

255
00:18:25,473 --> 00:18:27,306
Sorry, we've finished everything.

256
00:18:28,722 --> 00:18:29,976
Oh, no.

257
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,913
I didn't even eat anything
because I wanted to eat the curry.

258
00:18:35,634 --> 00:18:36,549
Curry.

259
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:38,351
Curry.

260
00:18:38,905 --> 00:18:41,624
Please, I want some curry.
Give me some curry. Please.

261
00:18:41,624 --> 00:18:42,989
Tane, clean up the table.

262
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,156
Okay.

263
00:18:53,515 --> 00:18:54,709
I'm sorry for that.

264
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,002
It's all right.

265
00:18:56,164 --> 00:18:58,904
Yukata, just think of us as family.

266
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:00,773
Treat this place like your home, OK?

267
00:19:06,987 --> 00:19:09,315
If we add water into this,
will it still work?

268
00:19:11,011 --> 00:19:14,587
Oh, it will turn into bland
and watery curry. Oh, no.

269
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,556
No, I don't want to eat bland curry.

270
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:18,486
Right?

271
00:19:18,511 --> 00:19:19,730
Sorry, Dad.

272
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,260
It's okay.

273
00:19:21,303 --> 00:19:22,461
In the fridge,

274
00:19:22,544 --> 00:19:24,544
there's dried fish. I'll grill them.

275
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:26,224
Isn't it expensive?

276
00:19:26,421 --> 00:19:28,421
No, I got them from Hashida.

277
00:19:39,741 --> 00:19:41,280
See you later, then.

278
00:19:41,463 --> 00:19:42,187
Okay.

279
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,450
Well.

280
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:49,132
I mean...

281
00:19:50,496 --> 00:19:51,524
Are you okay?

282
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,462
What are you referring to?

283
00:20:03,957 --> 00:20:05,805
Good night, then.

284
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:09,041
Okay, good night.

285
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,369
I see that you still haven't
changed whatsoever.

286
00:21:14,033 --> 00:21:16,008
Will Yutaka be all right?

287
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:19,612
He didn't seem very happy.

288
00:21:21,775 --> 00:21:23,768
I'm going to bed, then.

289
00:21:23,944 --> 00:21:25,584
Okay, good night.

290
00:21:44,996 --> 00:21:47,473
It seems like our family isn't
the only one with a difficult past.

291
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,123
(Next episode)
Yay!

292
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,691
(Individual problem)
You never replied.

293
00:23:12,694 --> 00:23:15,361
(Different memories)
Hey, Hozumi, you don't look very happy.

294
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:16,495
(Gentle memories about Mom)
Mom...

295
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:17,632
(that have been vivid until now)
was a cheerful person.

296
00:23:17,632 --> 00:23:20,812
She smiled so much that
we almost forgot she was sick.

297
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:23,487
Minoru, you're like your mother.
