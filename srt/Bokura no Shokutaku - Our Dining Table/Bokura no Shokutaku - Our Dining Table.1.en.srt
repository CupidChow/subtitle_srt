00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
(OST Design)

2
00:00:22,306 --> 00:00:24,260
Finally, time for lunch.

3
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,086
I'm taking a lunch break.

4
00:00:26,353 --> 00:00:27,200
Okay.

5
00:00:28,871 --> 00:00:30,030
Shall we grab something to eat?

6
00:00:30,058 --> 00:00:31,098
Okay.

7
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:32,611
Mei, let's go.

8
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:33,901
Okay, let's go.

9
00:00:34,204 --> 00:00:35,068
What should we eat?

10
00:00:35,091 --> 00:00:36,770
Right...

11
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,388
What should we eat?

12
00:00:48,525 --> 00:00:50,584
My body mostly consists of...

13
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,442
rice balls, salad,
and stuff in supermarkets.

14
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:59,259
I have the same food

15
00:00:59,928 --> 00:01:02,229
and live my life
with the same routine every day.

16
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:05,065
Thank you for the food.

17
00:01:14,595 --> 00:01:19,313
(Can you come home for
Dad's 60th birthday next month?)

18
00:01:27,397 --> 00:01:30,023
(I got it. I'll go.)

19
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:36,265
(I can't make it on that day.)

20
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:50,110
Well...

21
00:01:52,243 --> 00:01:53,380
Well...

22
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:55,082
Who are you?

23
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,638
This is super yummy.

24
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,406
Is that so?

25
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:21,475
I made it myself.

26
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:22,879
Really?

27
00:02:22,905 --> 00:02:24,962
Man, you are a genius.

28
00:02:25,682 --> 00:02:26,780
"Man"?

29
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:40,661
Where is your family?

30
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,322
I have an older brother.

31
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:45,098
Where is your brother?

32
00:02:50,517 --> 00:02:51,772
Hey, Tane.

33
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:54,741
Didn't I tell you to wait
at the checkout counter?

34
00:02:54,789 --> 00:02:56,143
What the heck are you doing?

35
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:58,426
What are you eating?

36
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:01,114
I got it from him.

37
00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:03,728
Sorry for giving it to him
without asking you.

38
00:03:03,728 --> 00:03:06,520
Don't take his important rice ball
just because you want it.

39
00:03:07,636 --> 00:03:09,823
Oh, I'm sorry.

40
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:12,192
Come on, let's go.

41
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:13,802
Come here.

42
00:03:20,423 --> 00:03:21,968
What was that?

43
00:04:11,605 --> 00:04:16,857
"Our Dining Table"

44
00:04:17,303 --> 00:04:19,259
"Episode 1"
All right, all right.

45
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,084
"Episode 1"
Since the construction of the hall

46
00:04:21,085 --> 00:04:22,968
in front of the station has finished,

47
00:04:22,968 --> 00:04:24,428
let's have some drinks.

48
00:04:24,428 --> 00:04:25,461
That's a good idea.

49
00:04:25,461 --> 00:04:26,895
- Are you coming? Come on.
- Yeah, let's go.

50
00:04:27,572 --> 00:04:29,002
- Are you coming?
- Yes.

51
00:04:29,028 --> 00:04:30,928
Hozumi, do you want to come with us?

52
00:04:32,084 --> 00:04:34,007
I'll pass.

53
00:04:34,221 --> 00:04:35,055
Oh...

54
00:04:35,055 --> 00:04:36,476
Thank you for all your hard work.

55
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,711
Thank you for your hard work.

56
00:04:41,437 --> 00:04:43,650
He's so bad at socializing.

57
00:04:49,109 --> 00:04:51,401
(30% off)

58
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:41,878
(Can you come home for
Dad's 60th birthday next month?)

59
00:06:15,545 --> 00:06:16,651
That kid yesterday...

60
00:06:16,784 --> 00:06:20,202
Teach me how to make that rice ball.

61
00:06:20,489 --> 00:06:21,514
Watch it.

62
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,717
Don't you have something to say
before that?

63
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,388
Sorry for eating
your rice ball yesterday.

64
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:30,523
Sorry

65
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,132
for taking your lunch.

66
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:34,527
Don't be. It's okay.

67
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:37,890
I also need to apologize for giving it
to him without asking you.

68
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,868
You came here just to apologize to me?

69
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:45,572
That's part of the reason.

70
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:49,209
But this guy,

71
00:06:49,372 --> 00:06:52,946
he kept saying the rice ball was so good
he wanted to eat it again.

72
00:06:53,795 --> 00:06:55,849
I wanted to know
what kind of rice ball it was.

73
00:06:56,962 --> 00:06:58,900
It's just a normal rice ball.

74
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:00,921
It's like a grenade.

75
00:07:07,563 --> 00:07:08,628
Oh.

76
00:07:08,897 --> 00:07:10,897
It does look like a grenade.

77
00:07:11,146 --> 00:07:15,253
It's a mix with the purpose
to fill the stomach quickly

78
00:07:15,253 --> 00:07:16,737
and give you complete nutrition.

79
00:07:19,585 --> 00:07:20,750
It's almost as big as your head.

80
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,498
No, you can't eat it.
I'll make one for you later.

81
00:07:23,498 --> 00:07:25,345
Yours doesn't taste good.

82
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:28,014
If I set my mind to it, I can do it too.

83
00:07:28,037 --> 00:07:29,170
No, it's awful.

84
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,217
But I do it all the time.
Fine, I won't do it anymore.

85
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,709
- No, it's awful.
- Will that be okay?

86
00:07:32,724 --> 00:07:33,891
It's okay if I don't do it?

87
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:34,591
No, it's awful.

88
00:07:34,591 --> 00:07:36,384
- Don't say you don't want it.
- But it's awful.

89
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:40,327
Nothing.

90
00:07:43,072 --> 00:07:45,298
I just thought you two
seem like good siblings.

91
00:07:47,697 --> 00:07:48,803
Right.

92
00:07:49,543 --> 00:07:50,870
Shall we share this?

93
00:07:50,986 --> 00:07:52,706
Yes, thank you.

94
00:07:53,615 --> 00:07:54,641
Is that okay?

95
00:07:54,895 --> 00:07:55,708
Yes.

96
00:07:56,182 --> 00:07:59,012
I'm glad you like it that much.

97
00:08:01,054 --> 00:08:03,172
Then I'll give you this in return.

98
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:06,953
Are you sure?

99
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:07,785
Yes.

100
00:08:09,025 --> 00:08:09,885
Thank you.

101
00:08:09,912 --> 00:08:10,724
Mm.

102
00:08:17,732 --> 00:08:18,631
You know...

103
00:08:20,152 --> 00:08:21,201
If you don't mind,

104
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,804
can you teach him
how to make the rice ball yourself?

105
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:29,309
Is this weekend convenient for you?

106
00:08:48,638 --> 00:08:52,033
(Ueda pottery workshop)
I couldn't say no

107
00:08:52,058 --> 00:08:54,709
(Ueda pottery workshop)
because of the kid's sweet little smile.

108
00:08:54,832 --> 00:08:56,728
And he gave me candy.

109
00:08:58,226 --> 00:09:01,007
But more importantly,
the biggest reason is because...

110
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:06,346
the older brother seems pretty scary.

111
00:09:24,678 --> 00:09:27,765
(Ueda pottery workshop)
I guess it's here.

112
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:30,336
Oh, you're here for
the hands-on workshop?

113
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:32,972
Wow, I'm glad.

114
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:34,835
Please come inside.

115
00:09:34,835 --> 00:09:37,806
No, I'm here to see the older brother.

116
00:09:38,866 --> 00:09:39,980
You're Minoru's friend?

117
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,866
No.

118
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:42,348
Really?

119
00:09:42,431 --> 00:09:44,118
So, he has a friend.

120
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:45,243
I see.

121
00:09:45,326 --> 00:09:48,555
Minoru is inside. You can go ahead.

122
00:09:48,591 --> 00:09:49,656
Well...

123
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:02,001
Hey.

124
00:10:03,405 --> 00:10:05,305
I have a question for you.

125
00:10:05,853 --> 00:10:08,946
Poop flavored curry
or curry flavored poop,

126
00:10:08,962 --> 00:10:10,384
Which one do you want?

127
00:10:10,946 --> 00:10:13,012
Of course the curry is better.

128
00:10:13,168 --> 00:10:14,380
Then...

129
00:10:14,463 --> 00:10:18,151
Stew-flavoured vomit,
or vomit-flavoured stew?

130
00:10:18,381 --> 00:10:19,853
Of course...

131
00:10:20,215 --> 00:10:21,688
Wait.

132
00:10:22,472 --> 00:10:23,623
Which one?

133
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,724
Wait a sec.

134
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,092
Vomit flavored...

135
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:28,175
Vomit flavored?

136
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,598
Well...

137
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:33,533
Excuse me...

138
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:35,969
Oh, it's Mr. Rice Ball.

139
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:38,338
You really came?

140
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:01,461
I'll take it.

141
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:03,544
Don't drop it. It's dangerous.

142
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:11,304
Here. Please enjoy.

143
00:11:11,387 --> 00:11:12,338
Thank you.

144
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,508
Sorry.

145
00:11:15,543 --> 00:11:17,349
I didn't expect you to actually come.

146
00:11:17,349 --> 00:11:18,244
Oh...

147
00:11:18,606 --> 00:11:20,747
But I promised.

148
00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:23,650
We're going to make
a grenade together, right?

149
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:24,759
Yeah.

150
00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:27,086
Well...

151
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:28,888
Mr. Rice Ball, what's your name?

152
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:31,624
Mr. Rice Ball...

153
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,461
It's Hozumi Yutaka.

154
00:11:35,584 --> 00:11:37,082
My name is Ueda Minoru.

155
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:38,254
And this guy...

156
00:11:38,254 --> 00:11:39,174
I'm Tane.

157
00:11:39,214 --> 00:11:41,634
Mr. Rice Ball, nice to meet you.

158
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:43,736
Tane, it's nice to meet you too.

159
00:11:43,784 --> 00:11:44,704
Mm!

160
00:11:45,793 --> 00:11:48,441
Sir, please begin.

161
00:11:48,717 --> 00:11:51,878
Even though you said that,
it's just a normal rice ball.

162
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:55,171
But Tane kept saying it's "yummy."

163
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:56,649
There must be something different.

164
00:11:57,165 --> 00:11:58,651
Different?

165
00:11:59,495 --> 00:12:00,987
Like, maybe your hands

166
00:12:01,983 --> 00:12:04,560
are a god's hands
made specially for rice balls.

167
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:15,635
Don't you think your rice
seems a bit yellowish?

168
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,671
Is that so?

169
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,742
And the smell...

170
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,451
Did you clean the back of the lid
of the rice cooker?

171
00:12:34,595 --> 00:12:36,122
I guess you didn't.

172
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:40,095
Oh, I never thought the difference
would be the rice cooker.

173
00:12:40,806 --> 00:12:42,795
But I use a clay pot.

174
00:12:42,838 --> 00:12:44,797
That's it. That must be it.

175
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:09,789
Last year, my rice cooker broke down.

176
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,992
I used a clay pot instead and it
turned out great, so I keep using it.

177
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:17,230
Do you live alone?

178
00:13:20,195 --> 00:13:21,067
Yes.

179
00:13:21,656 --> 00:13:24,304
But my parents' house is not far away.

180
00:13:24,466 --> 00:13:26,266
It's good to live alone.

181
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:27,273
You have freedom.

182
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,444
I guess.

183
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,747
It's very loud in my house.

184
00:13:44,713 --> 00:13:46,532
Isn't it quite lively?

185
00:13:46,654 --> 00:13:49,261
Oh, no, that's not lively at all.

186
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,396
He's a monster.

187
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:54,734
It must be difficult for you.

188
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,884
At first, use high heat.

189
00:14:16,284 --> 00:14:18,291
After it has boiled, lower the heat.

190
00:14:18,573 --> 00:14:20,989
When there's no steam coming out,
it's done.

191
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,731
Using a clay pot is faster
than I thought.

192
00:14:26,798 --> 00:14:27,707
Oh, right.

193
00:14:27,707 --> 00:14:29,102
Do you like the burnt rice
at the bottom of the pot?

194
00:14:29,264 --> 00:14:30,117
I do.

195
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:32,538
Let's make a lot of that, then.

196
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,541
Before you turn off the heat,

197
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,176
use high heat again.

198
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:38,711
Leave it for around ten seconds.

199
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,483
It's ready.

200
00:14:44,873 --> 00:14:45,885
Come on.

201
00:14:56,077 --> 00:14:57,816
It smells great.

202
00:14:57,816 --> 00:14:59,499
It looks yummy.

203
00:15:00,301 --> 00:15:01,667
Before we mess it up,

204
00:15:02,037 --> 00:15:05,171
the middle part tastes the best.

205
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,207
Who would take it?

206
00:15:06,207 --> 00:15:07,073
- Me.
- Me.

207
00:15:23,373 --> 00:15:24,323
Mmm.

208
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,626
Yummy.

209
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:27,960
Yummy.

210
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:29,462
Yummy, right?

211
00:15:32,553 --> 00:15:35,735
Put seaweed and rice on a plastic wrap.

212
00:15:39,412 --> 00:15:41,548
Sprinkle a little salt.

213
00:16:05,781 --> 00:16:07,500
Tane, what's your favorite filling?

214
00:16:07,695 --> 00:16:09,554
I love kombu and salmon.

215
00:16:09,883 --> 00:16:11,257
Then let's put those in.

216
00:16:17,556 --> 00:16:19,078
Sprinkle the salmon around.

217
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,782
Good job.

218
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,219
Yukata, what's your favorite filling?

219
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:27,920
It's "Yutaka."

220
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,003
Mine...

221
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:33,993
I'd say rolled egg and fried chicken.

222
00:16:34,253 --> 00:16:35,895
Can you use those as fillings?

223
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,532
Rice balls are freedom.

224
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:41,356
I see.

225
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:48,274
Are you done? Then make it round.

226
00:16:50,632 --> 00:16:52,826
Pull it up and press it.

227
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:55,956
That's right.

228
00:16:59,608 --> 00:17:02,648
Wow, so many grenades. Let's dig in.

229
00:17:03,368 --> 00:17:04,891
I'll make some tea.

230
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:06,508
I'll help serve it.

231
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:07,595
- Wait.
- You know,

232
00:17:07,595 --> 00:17:08,928
I should probably go.

233
00:17:10,578 --> 00:17:12,273
You have something to do?

234
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:16,269
It's not like that.

235
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,106
Yukata, you should eat with us.

236
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:23,776
Well, it's already done.

237
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,244
Please don't worry.

238
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:26,779
Let's eat together.

239
00:17:30,197 --> 00:17:31,450
Yutaka.

240
00:17:36,808 --> 00:17:37,828
You...

241
00:17:39,151 --> 00:17:40,626
don't even know how to eat, do you?

242
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,466
I'm...

243
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,539
not good at...

244
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,775
eating around other people.

245
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,022
Here.

246
00:18:11,176 --> 00:18:12,558
It's the one I made.

247
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,027
Eat it.

248
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:34,580
How is it?

249
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:44,323
A little too salty.

250
00:18:45,464 --> 00:18:46,326
Ew.

251
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:48,861
But...

252
00:18:54,983 --> 00:18:56,235
it's good.

253
00:19:00,488 --> 00:19:01,841
Yummy!

254
00:19:03,395 --> 00:19:05,879
It's yummy when everyone eats together.

255
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:09,315
Yeah, right?

256
00:19:10,678 --> 00:19:11,516
Here.

257
00:19:13,358 --> 00:19:14,854
I'll have some too.

258
00:19:18,846 --> 00:19:19,859
It's so big.

259
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:21,460
I'll eat now.

260
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:26,232
It is a little too salty.

261
00:20:07,202 --> 00:20:09,148
Thank you so much for today.

262
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:10,876
Same here.

263
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,748
Well...

264
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,986
Can you come visit again?

265
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,661
Tane had a lot of fun.

266
00:20:26,863 --> 00:20:29,695
If you could come
and eat with us sometime,

267
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:32,331
he'd probably be so happy.

268
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:42,875
What do you say?

269
00:20:49,117 --> 00:20:49,883
Okay.

270
00:21:02,073 --> 00:21:04,096
My body is mostly made up from

271
00:21:04,212 --> 00:21:07,833
rice balls, salad,
and stuff in supermarkets.

272
00:21:10,574 --> 00:21:13,096
I have the same food

273
00:21:13,214 --> 00:21:15,641
and live my life
with the same routine every day.

274
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,677
But now...

275
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,849
something different

276
00:21:24,338 --> 00:21:27,186
has got into my body.

277
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,790
Something warm,

278
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,359
whole,

279
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,096
and sparkling.

280
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,741
Sorry for what I asked for today.

281
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:50,810
- It's totally fine.
- You helped a lot.

282
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:52,478
Hello, Tane.

283
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:54,480
Yeah.

284
00:21:54,528 --> 00:21:56,561
Let's make it again this week.

285
00:21:56,763 --> 00:21:58,350
Any special request?

286
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,088
Okay, curry it is, then.

287
00:22:03,171 --> 00:22:05,691
Whoa, that's rare.

288
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:09,295
What kind of curry do you like?

289
00:22:10,816 --> 00:22:13,065
Maybe that something...

290
00:22:14,008 --> 00:22:16,936
is what I've always been longing for.

291
00:23:09,883 --> 00:23:10,694
(Next episode)

292
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:12,658
Even if it's a luxury meal,

293
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:14,758
if you couldn't eat it
with a smile on your face,

294
00:23:14,758 --> 00:23:16,356
it would be more painful.
(Unspoken memories from the past)

295
00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:18,050
Having Yutaka here is enough.
(First meeting)

296
00:23:18,075 --> 00:23:20,850
(Someone who wants me)

297
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,243
(This story is a work of fiction)
Thank you for the food.

298
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:23,502
Thank you for the food.

299
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,013
(and has no relation to
any real person or organization)
