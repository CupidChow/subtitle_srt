00:00:00,413 --> 00:00:02,151
(OST Design)
Thank you for all your hard work.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,604
- Thank you for all your hard work.
- Thank you for all your hard work.

3
00:00:03,653 --> 00:00:08,275
- Hope it's a good year for you.
- Hope it's a good year for you.

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,117
After this,

5
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:19,353
I want us to be the same like before.

6
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:22,189
After that,

7
00:00:25,153 --> 00:00:27,628
Minoru never contacted me.

8
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:32,132
This year will be over soon.

9
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,734
Hmm.

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,506
Hozumi, how has this year been for you?

11
00:00:40,236 --> 00:00:41,441
For me...

12
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:46,013
A lot of things happened this year.

13
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:48,515
A lot of things?

14
00:00:49,084 --> 00:00:49,983
Yeah.

15
00:00:51,154 --> 00:00:52,119
A lot.

16
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:55,555
How about yours, Ohata?

17
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:57,991
Same here.

18
00:00:58,788 --> 00:01:01,828
I feel like there's a lot of things
to think about this year.

19
00:01:02,344 --> 00:01:03,363
Think?

20
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,686
Yeah.

21
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:06,934
About my boyfriend... Just a little.

22
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:09,570
Is that so?

23
00:01:10,798 --> 00:01:13,846
Right now, I want to
throw everything away.

24
00:01:18,435 --> 00:01:19,546
But

25
00:01:20,075 --> 00:01:21,582
he's still important to me.

26
00:01:23,926 --> 00:01:24,679
Eh?

27
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,452
Because he's important,

28
00:01:27,597 --> 00:01:28,855
no matter what the outcome,

29
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,657
you just have to face it head-on, right?

30
00:01:33,086 --> 00:01:34,595
Even though I really don't like this,

31
00:01:34,638 --> 00:01:36,678
if we don't talk it out,
I don't think we can go on.

32
00:01:37,683 --> 00:01:39,249
So, I'll do my best.

33
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,340
I'll get going, then.

34
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,407
Okay.

35
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:48,475
Oh.

36
00:01:48,731 --> 00:01:49,910
Hope it's a good year for you.

37
00:01:50,385 --> 00:01:51,578
Hope it's a good year for you.

38
00:02:09,418 --> 00:02:12,831
(Hozumi Yukie)
(Are you coming home for New Year's Eve?)

39
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:06,582
"Our Dining Table"

40
00:03:09,904 --> 00:03:12,359
Minoru, isn't it the new year yet?

41
00:03:12,874 --> 00:03:13,860
"Episode 9"
No.

42
00:03:14,097 --> 00:03:16,543
When is Yukata coming tomorrow?

43
00:03:17,137 --> 00:03:20,268
He promised to go
to the shrine together.

44
00:03:23,273 --> 00:03:24,738
Minoru.

45
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,144
Tane-chan.

46
00:03:32,305 --> 00:03:33,580
"Chan"?

47
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,216
Maybe...

48
00:03:36,724 --> 00:03:39,357
we can't visit the shrine
on New Year's Day with Yutaka.

49
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:41,817
Eh? Why?

50
00:03:43,477 --> 00:03:44,891
And maybe we can't

51
00:03:46,195 --> 00:03:47,427
be the same like before.

52
00:03:47,763 --> 00:03:50,197
No, no, no.

53
00:03:55,745 --> 00:03:58,205
You had a fight with Yukata?

54
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,312
I will go with you to apologize to him.

55
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,283
Dad and Mom went out to buy some stuff.

56
00:04:24,484 --> 00:04:25,995
Is that so?

57
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:30,904
Come in.

58
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:33,840
Sorry.

59
00:04:49,225 --> 00:04:51,224
You haven't been home in a while.

60
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,592
Oh.

61
00:04:53,431 --> 00:04:54,227
Right.

62
00:04:55,605 --> 00:04:57,330
You rarely come back.

63
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,167
Sorry.

64
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:05,071
You know, you apologize
so much that it's become your habit.

65
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:06,640
Eh?

66
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,676
I don't know why,

67
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,546
but you've been apologizing

68
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:13,547
since back then.

69
00:05:15,602 --> 00:05:16,716
That...

70
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:25,158
That was because I've always felt it.

71
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,697
Since I came to live with the Hozumis,

72
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,168
I'd been feeling sorry
for taking your family.

73
00:05:37,944 --> 00:05:39,057
But...

74
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,877
Finally, I found my place.

75
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:51,551
So I won't be in your way anymore.

76
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,986
Don't worry.

77
00:05:56,306 --> 00:05:58,358
Your place?

78
00:06:01,004 --> 00:06:01,761
Yes.

79
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,231
Hey.

80
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:06,700
You think

81
00:06:07,488 --> 00:06:09,436
you're a nuisance,

82
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,337
and that's why
you stay away from this house?

83
00:06:22,138 --> 00:06:23,083
You idiot.

84
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,885
Huh?

85
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:27,254
That's partly true, though.

86
00:06:28,116 --> 00:06:30,223
When you first came here,

87
00:06:31,052 --> 00:06:34,461
I found it irritating
to have a stranger in my house.

88
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,864
And I was still so young.

89
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:41,101
But...

90
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,272
Hey, Yutaka.

91
00:06:45,747 --> 00:06:46,673
Let's play.

92
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:53,246
What's with him?

93
00:06:53,842 --> 00:06:57,217
Weren't you the one who acted like
you're not part of the family?

94
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:01,254
That's why at least

95
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:04,057
you should show up on important days.

96
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:07,560
Dad and Mom don't want to bother you,

97
00:07:07,683 --> 00:07:09,062
so they try not to be pushy.

98
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,067
This place

99
00:07:14,657 --> 00:07:16,369
is your home too.

100
00:07:24,687 --> 00:07:25,645
We're back.

101
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,607
- We're back.
- Welcome.

102
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:29,065
Long time no see, Yutaka.

103
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:30,558
Sorry we're late.

104
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,085
Let's have some tea.

105
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,123
Okay.

106
00:07:39,435 --> 00:07:40,574
How have you been?

107
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,762
Are you doing well?

108
00:07:42,912 --> 00:07:44,230
Well...

109
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:47,534
Earlier, I worked overtime
a lot and got sick.

110
00:07:47,962 --> 00:07:49,236
Was it serious?

111
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,005
No, I was just tired.

112
00:07:55,954 --> 00:07:56,843
Back then,

113
00:07:56,886 --> 00:07:58,999
when you got sick and stayed in bed,

114
00:07:59,761 --> 00:08:03,116
Yuki stayed up all night
to take care of you, right?

115
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,416
Mom.

116
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,352
You did.

117
00:08:06,323 --> 00:08:07,654
Stop it.

118
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,191
So that was...

119
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,471
That was you.

120
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,872
Enough.

121
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:27,240
Stop talking about this.

122
00:08:28,261 --> 00:08:29,809
When was that?

123
00:08:30,065 --> 00:08:31,811
When they're in middle school, I guess.

124
00:08:32,007 --> 00:08:34,314
It's been that long?

125
00:09:13,806 --> 00:09:14,721
Minoru,

126
00:09:15,203 --> 00:09:16,723
how has this year been for you?

127
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:19,492
How?

128
00:09:20,715 --> 00:09:22,228
This year

129
00:09:23,223 --> 00:09:25,223
probably made you smile a lot.

130
00:09:27,453 --> 00:09:28,168
Huh?

131
00:09:30,217 --> 00:09:31,805
I guess, it's because of Yutaka.

132
00:09:33,478 --> 00:09:35,408
Yutaka coming to our house

133
00:09:35,711 --> 00:09:38,445
made weekend meals more lively, right?

134
00:09:38,975 --> 00:09:41,781
And you know how to
make a lot more dishes.

135
00:09:43,731 --> 00:09:44,551
Yeah.

136
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,386
Seeing you

137
00:09:47,693 --> 00:09:49,889
having so much fun like that
for the first time

138
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:52,911
made me really happy.

139
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,805
Something happened

140
00:10:06,621 --> 00:10:07,841
between you and Yutaka, right?

141
00:10:09,111 --> 00:10:09,930
Huh?

142
00:10:10,891 --> 00:10:12,846
I don't know what happened,

143
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:15,715
but is it really a good idea
to just keep sulking like that?

144
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,512
I just...

145
00:10:21,674 --> 00:10:24,190
don't know how to act when I see him.

146
00:10:24,273 --> 00:10:26,326
My son's so fickle.

147
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:28,495
Who's fickle?

148
00:10:29,413 --> 00:10:31,167
Didn't your mom used to say?

149
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:33,937
Between doing it and
regretting it later, and not doing

150
00:10:33,961 --> 00:10:36,402
it and regretting it later,
the latter is more painful.

151
00:10:41,617 --> 00:10:42,775
Is that so?

152
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:47,747
I guess.

153
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:51,684
- Come on. Get up.
- Eh?

154
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:52,482
- Quickly.
- Whoa.

155
00:10:52,482 --> 00:10:53,753
- Come on.
- Wait.

156
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:55,121
Ouch.

157
00:10:57,714 --> 00:10:58,491
Here.

158
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:02,769
This year's stain must be cleaned up
within this year.

159
00:11:02,798 --> 00:11:04,397
What stain?

160
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:10,570
Thanks, Dad.

161
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:11,237
Mm.

162
00:11:12,274 --> 00:11:13,773
Go and welcome in a good year.

163
00:11:28,096 --> 00:11:29,055
Yutaka.

164
00:11:31,887 --> 00:11:32,926
Minoru.

165
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:43,169
Thank you.

166
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:12,265
You've run quite a distance.

167
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:15,468
You too.

168
00:12:21,347 --> 00:12:23,543
I have something I want to tell you.

169
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,085
I had a talk with my family.

170
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,324
I see.

171
00:12:41,268 --> 00:12:42,362
You're all right?

172
00:12:45,859 --> 00:12:46,646
Yeah.

173
00:12:48,838 --> 00:12:50,370
I'm fine now.

174
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:55,642
I see.

175
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,112
That's good.

176
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:02,448
Yeah.

177
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:12,592
You know,

178
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,762
the first time I met you,

179
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:18,531
I thought you were very scary.

180
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:20,767
Me?

181
00:13:21,336 --> 00:13:22,168
Yeah.

182
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:26,372
Actually,

183
00:13:26,394 --> 00:13:28,474
I went to make rice balls
with you that day

184
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,744
because I was so scared
that I couldn't say no.

185
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:32,912
Huh?

186
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:34,914
Seriously?

187
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:39,819
But...

188
00:13:42,227 --> 00:13:45,497
I know from the bottom of my heart
that going there was a good thing.

189
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:51,964
You are the one

190
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,067
who changed me.

191
00:13:59,554 --> 00:14:01,074
Meeting you two.

192
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,010
Eating together.

193
00:14:05,285 --> 00:14:06,446
I don't know since when,

194
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:09,549
but being with you
makes me feel very comfortable.

195
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:16,823
If it's you,

196
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,326
I want to tell all my stories.

197
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,665
"This is my place."

198
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,567
I feel like that.

199
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:33,206
So, that's...

200
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:34,941
what you think.

201
00:14:41,773 --> 00:14:42,682
That's why

202
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,418
I want to face it directly

203
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:46,552
with you.

204
00:14:54,195 --> 00:14:55,962
You said you like me, right?

205
00:14:57,965 --> 00:14:58,731
Yeah.

206
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:02,969
At the time,

207
00:15:04,418 --> 00:15:06,939
I was actually going to say
I like you too.

208
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,378
But...

209
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,800
Sorry.

210
00:15:22,493 --> 00:15:23,656
I guess I made you uncomfortable.

211
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,057
That's not it.

212
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:26,647
I just can't say it.

213
00:15:26,647 --> 00:15:27,860
I told you before.

214
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,397
We can stay the same.

215
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,500
I understand your feelings.

216
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:36,469
You don't.

217
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:38,037
Eh?

218
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,073
You don't understand my feelings at all.

219
00:15:43,028 --> 00:15:44,310
I don't?

220
00:15:44,747 --> 00:15:45,826
You just...

221
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,679
You are very important to me.

222
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,684
The word "like" isn't even enough.

223
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,455
Eh?

224
00:15:58,245 --> 00:15:59,058
So...

225
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:11,537
You can touch me.

226
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:24,650
See?

227
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:26,185
It's fine.

228
00:16:32,411 --> 00:16:33,379
I...

229
00:16:36,155 --> 00:16:38,264
still want to be with you after this.

230
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,549
My heartbeat is way too loud.

231
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,218
Right now...

232
00:17:00,068 --> 00:17:04,357
It's like I'm learning to
use my heart in a new way.

233
00:17:42,107 --> 00:17:43,162
The bell...

234
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,363
has rung.

235
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,400
It's rung.

236
00:17:48,507 --> 00:17:49,569
The last night of the year...

237
00:17:56,062 --> 00:17:57,777
This is not romantic at all.

238
00:17:59,133 --> 00:18:01,614
I heard it from the Christians,

239
00:18:01,646 --> 00:18:03,182
but the last night of the year...

240
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:28,841
From now on,

241
00:18:29,749 --> 00:18:32,211
it might not be the same as before.

242
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:36,115
Is that okay?

243
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:41,220
Yeah.

244
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:46,325
It's meat bun flavor.

245
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:47,827
What?

246
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:51,864
What?

247
00:18:55,741 --> 00:18:56,769
No.

248
00:18:57,331 --> 00:18:58,738
That's awful.

249
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,609
Ah, it's embarrassing.

250
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:18,958
Hey, Yukata.

251
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:23,095
What did you ask the god for?

252
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,566
I wish for my family's
good health and safety.

253
00:19:27,949 --> 00:19:28,834
Health?

254
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,136
Safe?

255
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:36,142
I hope everyone doesn't get sick.

256
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:38,878
Also...

257
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,979
What?

258
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:45,017
I wish to be here
with you guys again next year.

259
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:47,920
As for me,

260
00:19:48,703 --> 00:19:52,024
I wished to get the first place
prize in the school's running race.

261
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,126
You'll definitely get it.

262
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:55,194
Sorry for the wait.

263
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,063
- Oh, thank you.
- This one is for Tane.

264
00:19:57,532 --> 00:19:59,039
Thank you. Was the line very long?

265
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,399
Yeah, a little.

266
00:20:00,412 --> 00:20:01,679
Here, sweet sake.

267
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:02,601
What is it?

268
00:20:02,626 --> 00:20:03,569
All right.

269
00:20:04,183 --> 00:20:05,778
Alcohol that kids can drink.

270
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:09,675
Right.

271
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:10,943
Eat the boiled red beans.

272
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:12,545
Oh, no.

273
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,980
I'm full just by looking at you two.

274
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:16,849
What's with you?

275
00:20:24,232 --> 00:20:25,391
I feel

276
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:27,193
very happy.

277
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:31,597
Right now,

278
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:33,532
I'm happy.

279
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:37,069
Mm.

280
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,938
Happy.

281
00:20:43,738 --> 00:20:46,225
I'm so happy that I'm scared.

282
00:20:49,836 --> 00:20:50,716
Scared?

283
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:54,587
Yes.

284
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,006
- So what?
- Do one more thing?

285
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:04,906
What is it called?

286
00:21:05,643 --> 00:21:07,463
Oh, Hozumi.

287
00:21:07,488 --> 00:21:08,868
Whoa, that's rare.

288
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:10,302
Eh? How?

289
00:21:11,821 --> 00:21:12,938
A draft beer, please.

290
00:21:12,948 --> 00:21:13,788
Okay.

291
00:21:18,073 --> 00:21:20,446
Hozumi, you've really changed.

292
00:21:20,486 --> 00:21:21,447
Really?

293
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,616
Yes, you look brighter.

294
00:21:24,685 --> 00:21:26,519
Someone has changed me.

295
00:21:27,271 --> 00:21:28,854
You mean, you're seeing someone?

296
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:30,669
No.

297
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,959
You're so easy to read.

298
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:38,764
That's great.
I hope I have some of that.

299
00:21:39,574 --> 00:21:42,101
You mean, the boyfriend you mentioned...

300
00:21:42,783 --> 00:21:43,702
Yeah.

301
00:21:44,977 --> 00:21:46,655
I faced it directly and we talked.

302
00:21:46,655 --> 00:21:48,774
We ended up breaking up.

303
00:21:48,857 --> 00:21:49,875
Breaking up?

304
00:21:50,588 --> 00:21:52,278
I can accept that,

305
00:21:52,326 --> 00:21:54,180
but I can't go back to being friends.

306
00:21:55,293 --> 00:21:57,850
To be honest, I'm so lonely now.

307
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,685
I see.

308
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:02,822
If we break up...

309
00:22:05,053 --> 00:22:07,453
I'm so happy that I'm scared.

310
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,830
If the time comes...

311
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:16,135
Will I be able to bear it?

312
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:10,723
(Next episode)

313
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,157
(If this happiness)
This happiness

314
00:23:12,354 --> 00:23:15,007
(disappeared...)
could just disappear one day.

315
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,763
Loving someone,

316
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,199
(The future we choose...)
in my opinion, means accepting.

317
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:21,292
(The future we choose...)
the pain of losing too.

318
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,370
So, there's still things I don't know.
