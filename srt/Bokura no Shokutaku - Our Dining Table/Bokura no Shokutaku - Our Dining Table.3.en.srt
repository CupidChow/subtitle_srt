Thank you for the food.

Yutaka,

3
00:00:14,633 --> 00:00:16,216
having you here is enough.

This is for me?

10
00:01:44,949 --> 00:01:45,906
Yes.

(Kitazakiyama Zoo)

12
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:53,747
Yukata, bring a lunchbox on that day.

13
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,092
Lunchbox?

14
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:58,385
Yeah. Can you also put octopus in it?

15
00:01:58,635 --> 00:01:59,720
Octopus?

16
00:01:59,822 --> 00:02:00,821
Octopus.

17
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,257
Mr. Octopus Sausage?

18
00:02:04,335 --> 00:02:06,110
Yeah, Mr. Octopus Sausage.

19
00:02:06,134 --> 00:02:07,160
Thank you.

20
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:08,895
This kid.

21
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,728
Since he saw Mr. Octopus Sausage
in a friend's lunchbox at school,

22
00:02:11,728 --> 00:02:13,066
he's been so noisy,
asking me to "make it."

23
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,301
I'm not noisy.

24
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:17,004
You're bad for not making it for me.

25
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:18,939
It's such a hassle,
who would want to do it?

26
00:02:18,986 --> 00:02:21,152
I want octopus.

27
00:02:21,176 --> 00:02:22,201
Too hard.

28
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,577
- Octopus.
- No.

29
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:24,878
- Octopus.
- I won't make it.

30
00:02:24,902 --> 00:02:26,176
- Octopus.
- No.

31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,481
- Octopus.
- No.

32
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:28,815
- Octopus.
- No.

33
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:30,917
- Anyway, let's just make it.
- No, I won't make it. - I want octopus.

34
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:33,153
With Mr. Octopus Sausage too.

35
00:02:33,723 --> 00:02:35,489
Yutaka, you can make lunchboxes too?

36
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,758
Yeah.

37
00:02:38,885 --> 00:02:40,894
Really? That's amazing.

38
00:02:40,918 --> 00:02:42,162

(1.Put filling in the rice, wrap it,
and make it into a triangular shape.)

42
00:02:56,814 --> 00:03:00,373
(2.Cut the boiled red sausage in half.
Use a heart-shaped cutter to cut it.)

43
00:03:00,516 --> 00:03:02,635
(3.Boil a carrot and cut into a circle.
Use seaweed to make the eyes and mouth.)

44
00:03:11,753 --> 00:03:14,327
I made a lot because Yuki likes it.

45
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:15,729
When was that?

46
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:18,475
In kindergarten?

47
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,703
Don't join a lunchbox making club
or something like that.

48
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:24,938
All right.

49
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:08,332
I'll go buy some drinks. Wanna come?

50
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:10,490
No, thank you. I have mine.

51
00:04:10,514 --> 00:04:11,284
Okay.

Uh... Nothing.

56
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:43,917
I just realized you brought
your lunchbox today.

57
00:04:45,878 --> 00:04:48,388
Yeah, sometimes I do.

58
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,265
Do you want to sit and have some?

59
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:53,393
No. It's not like that.

60
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:57,010
Well...

61
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,388

Please...

65
00:05:32,304 --> 00:05:33,333
Well...

66
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:38,783
Can I ask you to teach me
how to make a lunchbox?

67
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:41,067
Huh?

68
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:45,946
I made a promise to
my friend's little brother.

69
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,548
But after thinking about it,

70
00:05:49,158 --> 00:05:51,105
even though I can say I cook for myself,

71
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:53,720
I'm only good at making rice balls.

72
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,557
I've never made a lunchbox.

73
00:05:58,745 --> 00:06:01,094
And Ohata, your lunchbox looks so good.

74
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,563
If it's not too much of a bother...

75
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,168
It's not a bother, but...

76
00:06:10,897 --> 00:06:12,839
It's like it came out of nowhere, right?

77
00:06:12,863 --> 00:06:14,341
I'm sorry. It's totally okay.

78
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:15,742
It's not like that.

79
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,074
It's just that it's the first time

80
00:06:19,153 --> 00:06:20,814
that you asked for help.

81
00:06:23,085 --> 00:06:24,517
Of course, I'll help you.

82
00:06:24,705 --> 00:06:26,987
I hope the boy will be happy with it.

This is hard.

Hmm...

95
00:07:33,797 --> 00:07:35,455
When you made the rolled egg,

96
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,490
did you add water to the beaten egg?

97
00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:39,544
I didn't.

98
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,896
If you add around three tablespoons
of water, the egg will be fluffier.

99

Thank you.

100
00:07:45,694 --> 00:07:48,201

No.

110
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:17,184
Stop it. You left the stove on.

111

Yes.

115

116

Thank you for the food.

118
00:10:29,325 --> 00:10:30,296
Okay.

119
00:10:32,344 --> 00:10:33,600
You did very well.

120
00:10:33,624 --> 00:10:34,538
No.

121
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:38,172
Mm.

122
00:10:38,703 --> 00:10:39,778
It's very good.

123
00:10:39,803 --> 00:10:41,374
- Really?
- Mm.

124
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,477
When he sees this
he'll definitely be happy.

125
00:10:43,586 --> 00:10:45,044
I hope so.

126
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:47,147
Are you going to the zoo tomorrow?

127
00:10:48,318 --> 00:10:49,385
Yes.

128
00:10:51,786 --> 00:10:52,952
What's wrong?

129
00:10:53,841 --> 00:10:54,775
Nothing.

130
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,257
I just suddenly feel a little nervous.

131
00:10:58,043 --> 00:10:59,125
Nervous?

132
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:00,160
Mm.

133
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,931
I can do most of what you taught me,

134
00:11:05,796 --> 00:11:10,605
but when I think about
if he'll really like my food,

135
00:11:10,777 --> 00:11:12,862
I suddenly feel nervous.

136
00:11:17,404 --> 00:11:18,778
Hozumi.

137
00:11:18,973 --> 00:11:20,446
You must really like him, right?

138
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:23,183
That boy.

139
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,285
Or else you wouldn't feel nervous.

140
00:11:29,007 --> 00:11:30,809
When we talk about lunchboxes,

141
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:33,526
both of the kind
that you make for yourself

142
00:11:33,745 --> 00:11:36,095
and the kind the you make
for someone else are good.

143
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,702
When you think the person
you like will say "It's delicious,"

144
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,205
then it's definitely worth making it.

145
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:47,674
Mm.

146
00:11:48,887 --> 00:11:50,461
- Can I have rolled egg too?

147
00:11:50,485 --> 00:11:51,578
Of course.

148
00:11:51,602 --> 00:11:52,912
- Yay.

149
00:12:01,883 --> 00:12:04,757
What are you filming?

150
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,392
I'm sending it to Yutaka.

151
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:07,638
- Yukata?
- Yeah.

152
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:10,196
Yukata.

153
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,954
What are you doing?

154
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,373
You try acting like an animal too.

155
00:12:20,397 --> 00:12:21,608
No way.

156
00:12:21,632 --> 00:12:24,177
Act like one.

157
00:12:25,631 --> 00:12:27,528
What a pain.

158
00:12:32,761 --> 00:12:34,370
Then...

159
00:12:36,768 --> 00:12:37,790
A gorilla.

160
00:12:40,402 --> 00:12:42,462
You're so weird.

161
00:12:44,022 --> 00:12:47,559
Stop it. I'm going to pee my pants.

162
00:12:47,713 --> 00:12:49,168
Wait. Stop.

163
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:52,305
No.

164
00:12:52,376 --> 00:12:55,975
You already did, didn't you? Oh, no.

165
00:13:24,073 --> 00:13:25,405
All right.

166
00:13:57,956 --> 00:14:01,146
- That's it for the new
and popular cartoons.

167
00:14:01,413 --> 00:14:03,170
- Next will be the weather report.

168
00:14:03,224 --> 00:14:05,144
- Moving on to you, Ms. Kodera.

169
00:14:05,168 --> 00:14:09,215
- Yes, I'll report today's weather
across the country.

170
00:14:09,777 --> 00:14:14,546
- From the movement of the air front,
we may experience a temperature drop.

171
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:17,484
The weather in the eastern part of
Japan can change quite frequently.

172
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:19,192
- There may be rain in some areas.

173
00:14:19,216 --> 00:14:20,393
- Please bring rain gear.

174
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:22,417
- Done.
- When you go outside.

175
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,030
Please allow me.

176
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,793
Yukata.

177
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:47,023
Tane.

178
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:53,024
I can't wait to eat the lunchbox.

179
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:54,794
You have to wait for lunchtime.

180
00:14:54,818 --> 00:14:56,429
Let's eat when you feel hungry.

181
00:14:56,476 --> 00:14:57,830
Okay.

182
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,033
What's up with you, Tane?
You're pretty obedient today.

183
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,268
It's normal.

184
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:03,503
Normal, right?

185
00:15:04,145 --> 00:15:05,804
You've been looking forward to it.

186
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:07,073
Yes.

187
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,442
Is that all your stuff?

188
00:15:09,466 --> 00:15:10,806
Yeah, it is.

189
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,679
I just need to check the doors
because Dad isn't home today.

190
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:16,177
Okay, I'll take it outside for you.

191
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:17,183
Thanks.

192
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:22,967
Huh?

193
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,100
- Ahh!

194
00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:29,931
Maybe it's a short downpour?

195
00:15:30,588 --> 00:15:32,799
Let's just wait for a while.

196
00:15:32,823 --> 00:15:34,634
- Right.
- Mm.

197
00:15:34,883 --> 00:15:36,302
It will stop soon.

198
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:45,445
No way. No.

199
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,946
No.

200
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,115
The zoo.

201
00:15:49,596 --> 00:15:51,484
Crying won't help.

202
00:15:51,508 --> 00:15:52,952
The weather is unpredictable.

203
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,456
No, I want to go to the zoo.

204
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,557
Tane.

205
00:15:58,444 --> 00:16:02,303
Tane, it's too bad,
but let's go there next week instead.

206
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,139
No.

207
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,097
Stop it, Tane.

208
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:06,265
No.

209
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:14,841
This way.

210
00:16:22,324 --> 00:16:24,250
Wow.

211
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:32,456
Welcome to my homemade zoo.

212
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,561
Wow, the zoo!

213
00:16:35,826 --> 00:16:38,307
It's clearly a zoo.

214
00:16:38,355 --> 00:16:39,520
This is so you, Yutaka.

215
00:16:39,888 --> 00:16:42,268
Didn't you send me
the video of Tane playing?

216
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,135
Yeah.

217
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,105
I remembered there were
plushies in the room.

218
00:16:47,748 --> 00:16:49,939
That video is really adorable.

219
00:16:49,964 --> 00:16:51,988
I lost count on how many times
I've watched it.

220
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,716
Yukata, I want to eat the lunchbox.

221
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,860
It's only 11 o'clock. Can you eat now?

222
00:17:07,884 --> 00:17:08,861
Yes, I can.

223
00:17:08,885 --> 00:17:10,096
Really?

224
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,031
If so, let's eat now.

225
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,114
Okay.

226
00:17:16,692 --> 00:17:18,838
Here. This is yours.

227
00:17:18,963 --> 00:17:20,206
Wow.

228
00:17:20,476 --> 00:17:21,707
What do we say...?

229
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,309
Thank you.

230
00:17:23,629 --> 00:17:25,177
You're welcome.

231
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,247
Here's yours.

232
00:17:28,807 --> 00:17:30,616
There's one for me too?
That's really too much...

233
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,951
It's totally fine.

234
00:17:31,975 --> 00:17:34,120
I already made it. Just eat.

235
00:17:34,144 --> 00:17:35,221
Okay.

236
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:36,859
Thank you.

237
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,525
Yukata, can I open it now?

238
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:40,526
Of course.

239
00:17:42,876 --> 00:17:44,308
Wow.

240
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:46,032
Amazing.

241
00:17:46,056 --> 00:17:47,204
Amazing.

242
00:17:49,003 --> 00:17:50,503
Can I eat now?

243
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,404
Yes.

244
00:17:51,842 --> 00:17:53,673
Thank you for the food.

245
00:18:07,562 --> 00:18:09,188
Yummy.

246
00:18:09,212 --> 00:18:10,489
Really?

247
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,692
That's a relief.

248
00:18:13,117 --> 00:18:14,978
Great. I'll eat too.

249
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:24,670
(Thank you so much!

250
00:18:24,695 --> 00:18:26,172
It's so amazing.

251
00:18:26,197 --> 00:18:28,407
(Thank you as always.)
Amazing.

252
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:30,843
I used a cutter to make it.

253
00:18:30,874 --> 00:18:32,831
I woke up at five to make it.

254
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:34,714
Five?! Are you serious?

255
00:18:36,761 --> 00:18:37,445
But...

256
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,712
I'm so glad.

257
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,022
Now... I feel bad that I have to eat it.

258
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,024
Just eat it.

259
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,193
Thank you.

260
00:18:48,163 --> 00:18:49,041
Then...

261
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:50,496
Thank you for the food.

262
00:18:58,871 --> 00:18:59,905
Mm.

263
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,108
It's yummy.

264
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:05,811
I'm so relieved.

265
00:19:05,941 --> 00:19:07,313
It's super yummy.

266
00:19:07,383 --> 00:19:09,007
It's yummy, right? Mm.

267
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,039
I'll have some too.

268
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,140
Thank you so much for today.

269
00:20:08,756 --> 00:20:11,760
Thanks for making Tane a lunchbox,
and for making one for me too.

270
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:14,747
I'm really glad.

271
00:20:17,076 --> 00:20:19,685
Thanks to the both of you, I'll
have good memories of today.

272
00:20:19,732 --> 00:20:20,820
Thank you.

273
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,894
Actually, I have something to tell you.

274
00:20:32,974 --> 00:20:33,999
What is it?

275
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,705
To be honest, I...

276
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:49,749
I've never made a lunchbox before.

277
00:20:51,467 --> 00:20:52,267
Huh?

278
00:20:53,227 --> 00:20:56,002
I said, "Let's just make it,"
without really thinking about it.

279
00:20:56,027 --> 00:20:57,723
And I just couldn't back out.

280
00:20:58,106 --> 00:21:00,493
Honestly, I was really anxious.

281
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,163
For the past half month,
my colleague taught me a lot of things.

282
00:21:05,853 --> 00:21:07,800
The flavour and the appearance.

283
00:21:07,824 --> 00:21:11,237
I was so nervous
until the moment you both ate it.

284
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,576
When the person you like says it's good,
it really makes you happy, right?

285
00:21:49,752 --> 00:21:50,976
The sun is out.

286
00:21:51,265 --> 00:21:52,978
Let's go to the zoo.

287
00:21:53,002 --> 00:21:54,580
The sun is out? Shall we go now?

288
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:55,414
Okay.

289
00:21:55,758 --> 00:21:57,917
All right, then let's get ready.

290
00:21:58,498 --> 00:21:59,552
Which one first?

291
00:21:59,724 --> 00:22:00,619
Panda.

292
00:22:00,644 --> 00:22:02,087
Okay, this one.

293
00:22:02,578 --> 00:22:03,622
Put it in.

294
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:06,058
What about the head?

295
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,764
The person you like...

296
00:22:13,836 --> 00:22:14,867
Right.

297
00:23:09,992 --> 00:23:11,739
(Next episode)

298
00:23:10,396 --> 00:23:11,557
Yutaka.

299
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:13,424
(A wound that won't heal)

300
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:13,092
Bro...

301
00:23:13,424 --> 00:23:16,010
(Past memories)

302
00:23:13,424 --> 00:23:14,602
When he's around,

303
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:15,728
the food suddenly tastes bad.

304
00:23:16,048 --> 00:23:18,551
(Emotional wound, hesitation)

305
00:23:16,048 --> 00:23:17,055
Yukata,

306
00:23:17,055 --> 00:23:18,527
just think of us as family.

307
00:23:18,551 --> 00:23:21,201
(It takes a while for the snow to melt...)

308
00:23:18,551 --> 00:23:20,332
Don't worry about it.

309
00:23:21,381 --> 00:23:23,869
(This story is a work of fiction)

310
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:22,701
I guess it's not only our family

311
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:23,869
that went through a lot of things.

312
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,013
(Characters and organizations
appearing in this work are fictitious)
