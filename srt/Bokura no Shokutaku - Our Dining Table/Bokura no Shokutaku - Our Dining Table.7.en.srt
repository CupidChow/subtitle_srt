1
00:00:01,702 --> 00:00:03,370
I want you to tell me everything.

2
00:00:04,285 --> 00:00:05,205
And I will...

3
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:07,441
listen really well.

4
00:00:14,326 --> 00:00:15,849
Should I?

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:17,918
Hmm?

6
00:00:36,463 --> 00:00:38,071
I'm back.

7
00:00:38,111 --> 00:00:39,439
Welcome home.

8
00:00:39,635 --> 00:00:40,474
Where's Yutaka?

9
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:42,476
The fever hasn't gone down yet.

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,477
What?

11
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,445
Will he be okay?

12
00:01:18,437 --> 00:01:19,638
Minoru...

13
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,655
In my dream,

14
00:01:31,943 --> 00:01:34,227
someone's big hand

15
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:39,800
was gently patting my head.

16
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:35,424
"Our Dining Table"

17
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:40,688
"Episode 7"

18
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:14,761
That day,

19
00:03:15,503 --> 00:03:18,799
Minoru's shoulder was warm
and made me feel at ease.

20
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,736
Maybe it's because of the medication.

21
00:03:23,345 --> 00:03:26,206
I don't know when I fell asleep.

22
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:31,044
I barely told him anything.

23
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,570
(Get well soon. I forgot to tell you.
This is a get well gift from Tane.)

24
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:52,575
(And a Christmas present. Minoru.)

25
00:04:18,074 --> 00:04:19,025
Oh.

26
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,721
Is Yukata all right?

27
00:04:20,746 --> 00:04:21,528
Yeah.

28
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:22,885
His fever has dropped.

29
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:23,576
Okay.

30
00:04:23,576 --> 00:04:25,275
It's great that it's nothing serious.

31
00:04:25,275 --> 00:04:26,099
Right.

32
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,704
Minoru, you seem to really like Yukata.

33
00:04:31,118 --> 00:04:33,507
Huh? What are you talking about?

34
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,393
I'll go buy some stuff.

35
00:04:35,393 --> 00:04:36,693
Okay, be safe.

36
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,345
Okay, I'm off.

37
00:04:42,578 --> 00:04:43,545
Oh, no.

38
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:00,526
I want you to tell me everything.

39
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:02,435
And I will...

40
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,604
listen really well.

41
00:05:11,116 --> 00:05:12,317
All right.

42
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,870
(Merry Christmas, Yukata.)

43
00:05:16,895 --> 00:05:19,720
Sorry. The shape is a little messed up.

44
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,935
Merry Christmas, Yukata.

45
00:05:23,802 --> 00:05:26,126
I'm so happy.

46
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:28,451
Thank you.

47
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:29,296
Mmm.

48
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:31,832
This one.

49
00:05:31,856 --> 00:05:34,668
My brother and I made it ourselves.

50
00:05:35,012 --> 00:05:37,804
It's just normal pancakes inside.

51
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,056
Right. It looks yummy.

52
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,844
We just tried stacking pancakes
on top of each other.

53
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,049
Hey, can I eat Santa?

54
00:05:49,926 --> 00:05:51,084
Of course.

55
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:53,320
But we made it for Yutaka.

56
00:06:01,913 --> 00:06:03,063
I can hear it clearly.

57
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:10,337
Santa is delicious.

58
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:13,373
Sorry.

59
00:06:13,397 --> 00:06:16,209
You invited me, but I couldn't
come when it was time.

60
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:17,128
It's okay.

61
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:19,708
I get to celebrate Christmas twice,
so it's really worth it.

62
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:22,900
What do you mean worth it?

63
00:06:23,226 --> 00:06:25,823
Jeez, you got cream on your face.

64
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,818
Oh, right.

65
00:06:30,104 --> 00:06:31,391
I know it's a little late,

66
00:06:31,415 --> 00:06:34,160
but here's my Christmas presents
for you two.

67
00:06:34,504 --> 00:06:35,653
Hooray!

68
00:06:35,653 --> 00:06:37,530
Yukata, thank you.

69
00:06:37,617 --> 00:06:38,398
Mm.

70
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,470
Wow, dinosaurs.

71
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:52,699
(To Minoru)

72
00:06:55,732 --> 00:06:56,683
Thank you.

73
00:06:57,027 --> 00:06:58,451
Oh... Mmm.

74
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,044
That...

75
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,823
Oh.

76
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:05,625
Thank you for this.

77
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:09,429
We got the same thing.

78
00:07:16,463 --> 00:07:17,537
Well...

79
00:07:17,686 --> 00:07:18,469
Right.

80
00:07:18,493 --> 00:07:19,581
Let's eat the cake.

81
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,274
Yeah, please enjoy.

82
00:07:25,171 --> 00:07:26,010
How is it?

83
00:07:26,182 --> 00:07:27,614
Mmm, delicious.

84
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,119
What a relief.

85
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:31,251
I'm relieved that it's good.

86
00:07:31,547 --> 00:07:33,219
I should open this too.

87
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:34,688
Thank you as well, Tane.

88
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:35,689
Mm.

89
00:07:39,486 --> 00:07:40,994
Thank you for the other day.

90
00:07:41,431 --> 00:07:42,395
Oh.

91
00:07:43,442 --> 00:07:45,277
The udon was very good.

92
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:48,268
And you also helped me clean the room.

93
00:08:05,702 --> 00:08:06,686
Well,

94
00:08:11,184 --> 00:08:13,026
about what we were talking about...

95
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,427
Yukata.

96
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:15,771
Look.

97
00:08:15,772 --> 00:08:18,146
I got a present from Dad.

98
00:08:18,675 --> 00:08:21,534
I will use these colors to draw a lot.

99
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:22,902
That's great.

100
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:25,449
Yukata, you should draw something too.

101
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:26,752
What should I draw?

102
00:08:26,776 --> 00:08:28,241
Draw a reindeer.

103
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:29,976
Oh, Yukata, welcome...

104
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,312
Tane, come here.

105
00:08:32,547 --> 00:08:34,104
Come help me knead the clay.

106
00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:36,349
Let's make a giant poop.

107
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,722
- Ew, a giant poop?
- Come on.

108
00:08:38,746 --> 00:08:41,554
- Yukata, I'll bring you the giant poop.
- Come on, let's go.

109
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:43,189
I'm looking forward to it.

110
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,825
Giant poop.

111
00:08:54,644 --> 00:08:55,869
Amazing.

112
00:08:55,893 --> 00:08:57,470
That's a lot of drawings.

113
00:08:57,618 --> 00:08:58,594
Yeah.

114
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,740
Since Christmas,
he's been drawing a lot.

115
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,742
He said he's also
going to draw 100 friends.

116
00:09:02,766 --> 00:09:04,210
Is that so?

117
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,981
Oh, I think that's you.

118
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:09,416
Eh? Really?

119
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,283
Yeah.

120
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:12,842
But it's a mini Yutaka.

121
00:09:13,447 --> 00:09:14,387
It looks kinda like you.

122
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:19,592
He made me so small, but still
managed to make me wear glasses.

123
00:09:19,617 --> 00:09:20,531
Whoa.

124
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:27,634
Hello.

125
00:09:29,157 --> 00:09:30,345
Oh.

126
00:09:31,435 --> 00:09:32,569
Hello.

127
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:45,200
Well...

128
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:48,054
What?

129
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:52,158
I...

130
00:09:54,747 --> 00:09:56,396
How should I say this?

131
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,067
Well...

132
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,107
Today,

133
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,777
can I tell you my story?

134
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,625
Yes.

135
00:10:28,564 --> 00:10:29,498
Go ahead.

136
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,338
I...

137
00:10:44,326 --> 00:10:46,628
When I was a kid,

138
00:10:48,485 --> 00:10:50,750
my biological parents passed away.

139
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,447
When I turned eight,

140
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,627
a relative adopted me into their family.

141
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,598
The family was very rich.

142
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:10,637
My new dad and mom

143
00:11:12,148 --> 00:11:14,917
took good care of me,

144
00:11:15,221 --> 00:11:17,677
as if I were their real child.

145
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:23,932
I think I was lucky.

146
00:11:26,873 --> 00:11:28,008
But...

147
00:11:28,336 --> 00:11:33,893
It seems the brother who's 5 years older
than me has never been able to accept me.

148
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:38,270
You...

149
00:11:39,696 --> 00:11:41,264
don't even know how to eat, do you?

150
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:43,903
Yuki.

151
00:11:45,676 --> 00:11:47,907
When he's around,
the food suddenly tastes bad.

152
00:11:49,313 --> 00:11:50,944
But, in hindsight,

153
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,980
maybe it's just something
you'd consider "nothing."

154
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,548
You did a good job.

155
00:11:58,482 --> 00:11:59,519
But...

156
00:12:01,695 --> 00:12:05,652
I felt pressured
by the atmosphere every day.

157
00:12:10,883 --> 00:12:12,298
Actually,

158
00:12:12,978 --> 00:12:14,634
this place is not even your real home.

159
00:12:15,657 --> 00:12:16,736
Dad,

160
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:18,171
Mom,

161
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:19,906
and everything.

162
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:22,000
They all used to be mine.

163
00:12:23,654 --> 00:12:25,645
I don't know when it began,

164
00:12:27,171 --> 00:12:30,116
but I started eating alone.

165
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,021
The tastes of the food I ate
every day back then.

166
00:12:36,558 --> 00:12:37,826
I...

167
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,260
can barely remember them.

168
00:12:47,396 --> 00:12:49,068
After I grew up,

169
00:12:53,032 --> 00:12:54,607
even though I've moved out
of their home,

170
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,444
and even though I have friends,

171
00:12:58,827 --> 00:13:00,580
and people I'm interested in,

172
00:13:07,063 --> 00:13:08,298
I'm still...

173
00:13:09,508 --> 00:13:13,263
scared of eating with people
at the same table.

174
00:13:17,869 --> 00:13:19,816
I can't remember

175
00:13:21,088 --> 00:13:23,002
my real parents' "flavor."

176
00:13:26,186 --> 00:13:27,554
I don't have...

177
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,712
any good memories

178
00:13:33,118 --> 00:13:34,747
related to the dining table.

179
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:39,786
When I think about that,

180
00:13:42,413 --> 00:13:44,415
I feel like, as a human,

181
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:46,926
it's as if something is missing.

182
00:13:54,785 --> 00:13:55,768
But...

183
00:13:58,869 --> 00:14:00,337
At that moment...

184
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:04,577
Yukata, you should eat with us.

185
00:14:04,741 --> 00:14:05,802
Yukata,

186
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,847
having you here is enough.

187
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:10,850
Meeting you two

188
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,256
and...

189
00:14:17,966 --> 00:14:19,258
eating...

190
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:21,461
together,

191
00:14:24,398 --> 00:14:25,698
I feel...

192
00:14:26,436 --> 00:14:29,602
happy for the first time
since I was born.

193
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:34,340
So...

194
00:14:39,173 --> 00:14:40,446
I mean...

195
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,484
What I want to tell you is...

196
00:14:55,574 --> 00:14:56,808
Thank you.

197
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:02,502
For coming up
and talking to me back then.

198
00:15:17,306 --> 00:15:18,418
Yutaka.

199
00:15:27,702 --> 00:15:28,528
Here.

200
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:30,378
Ah, thank you.

201
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:38,037
Yukata, I finished the poop.
Come look, quickly.

202
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:45,578
Minoru, you made Yukata cry.

203
00:15:45,602 --> 00:15:49,482
Yukata, don't cry.

204
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:52,819
- Yukata.
- What? Don't cry with him.

205
00:15:52,843 --> 00:15:55,388
- Yukata, don't cry.
- I'm sorry.

206
00:15:56,075 --> 00:15:58,124
- Yukata.
- Quit it.

207
00:15:58,378 --> 00:16:00,493
Tane, I got it.

208
00:16:00,517 --> 00:16:01,561
Quiet.

209
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,029
Come on.

210
00:16:03,053 --> 00:16:04,030
Come on.

211
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,975
Tane, are you okay now?

212
00:16:16,248 --> 00:16:17,176
Yeah.

213
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,980
Sorry for alarming you.

214
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,650
Yukata, were you bullied?

215
00:16:25,474 --> 00:16:26,285
Eh?

216
00:16:27,191 --> 00:16:28,125
No.

217
00:16:28,711 --> 00:16:30,590
Why did you cry?

218
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:35,695
Did something sad happen?

219
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,036
Do you want me to pat your head
to calm you down?

220
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,743
There,

221
00:16:50,907 --> 00:16:52,378
there.

222
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:53,913
There,

223
00:16:54,265 --> 00:16:55,648
there.

224
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,316
There...

225
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,295
Tane, thank you.

226
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,037
I'm okay now.

227
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:26,345
Is there a hungry kid here?

228
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:28,481
Want a rice ball?

229
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,283
He's here. Rice Ball Man.

230
00:17:30,307 --> 00:17:31,984
He has a face too.

231
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:36,956
Tane asked for it,
so I made Rice Ball Man the Series.

232
00:17:36,981 --> 00:17:38,457
- Eh?
- It's yummy.

233
00:17:40,265 --> 00:17:41,566
Which one do you want, Tane?

234
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:44,136
This one. Cheese Rice Ball Man.

235
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:45,298
- This one?
- Yes.

236
00:17:45,771 --> 00:17:46,771
What about you, Yutaka?

237
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,302
Then, I'll take this one.

238
00:17:49,326 --> 00:17:50,202
Okay.

239
00:17:50,484 --> 00:17:51,604
All right.

240
00:17:51,628 --> 00:17:52,572
Wow.

241
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:54,640
It's so cute that
I don't want to eat it.

242
00:17:58,221 --> 00:17:59,045
Mmm.

243
00:18:01,641 --> 00:18:02,982
No one cares.

244
00:18:03,006 --> 00:18:03,816
Yummy.

245
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,318
Yummy.

246
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:35,715
This reminds me of the first day we met.

247
00:18:36,025 --> 00:18:36,849
Hmm?

248
00:18:38,597 --> 00:18:42,254
In the park,
Tane kept staring at my rice ball.

249
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,323
Grenade.

250
00:18:44,683 --> 00:18:46,292
Yeah, grenade.

251
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:48,694
Minoru totally lost it back then.

252
00:18:50,453 --> 00:18:53,165
Hey, let's make
our Rice Ball Mans fight.

253
00:18:53,415 --> 00:18:54,533
How?

254
00:18:54,557 --> 00:18:57,803
First, do this
to charge up the rice ball.

255
00:18:57,827 --> 00:18:58,471
Okay.

256
00:18:58,495 --> 00:19:00,693
Then do this, and this.

257
00:19:00,717 --> 00:19:01,440
Okay.

258
00:19:01,464 --> 00:19:03,242
And then, do this.

259
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:04,310
Hmm?

260
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:11,283
Minoru,

261
00:19:11,689 --> 00:19:13,185
you seem to be good at drawing.

262
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,572
Why?

263
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:18,791
The rice balls' faces were so cute.

264
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:21,331
Oh, really?

265
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,696
Next time, I'll draw something, then.

266
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,931
Okay, I want to see it.

267
00:19:29,886 --> 00:19:32,471
Time flies.
It's already the end of the year.

268
00:19:34,268 --> 00:19:35,708
Right.

269
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,311
Will your family stay at home?

270
00:19:39,686 --> 00:19:41,614
Yeah, what about you?

271
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,483
The New Year's Eve,
or the New Year's Day.

272
00:19:45,661 --> 00:19:46,686
Um...

273
00:19:48,446 --> 00:19:52,758
I think I'll show my face at home
from the first to the third.

274
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,696
Will you be okay?

275
00:20:03,543 --> 00:20:04,270
Oh.

276
00:20:04,294 --> 00:20:06,338
Tane said he wants to visit a temple
on New Year's Day together.

277
00:20:06,362 --> 00:20:08,040
Oh, okay.

278
00:20:08,064 --> 00:20:10,124
There's this stall selling boiled
red beans. It's super delicious.

279
00:20:10,148 --> 00:20:11,235
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

280
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:12,338
I'll definitely try it.

281
00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:17,014
I rarely ever visit a temple
on New Year's Day.

282
00:20:17,014 --> 00:20:18,484
- I'm looking forward to it.
- Mm.

283
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,191
Ah, it's cold.

284
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,230
Yutaka, can I borrow your glasses?

285
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:32,364
Eh?

286
00:20:33,443 --> 00:20:34,333
Here.

287
00:20:36,043 --> 00:20:38,270
I just want to try it on.

288
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,947
I see. It's normal
for people with good eyesight.

289
00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:46,145
What you do think? Does it suit me?

290
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:49,348
It does.

291
00:20:49,393 --> 00:20:50,349
That's great.

292
00:20:59,671 --> 00:21:01,794
Thank you. I'm always thankful to you.

293
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,229
Hmm?

294
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,303
I'm glad you're here with me.

295
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:21,947
Minoru.

296
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:24,917
What's wrong?

297
00:21:26,677 --> 00:21:27,620
Nothing.

298
00:21:28,972 --> 00:21:30,055
Well...

299
00:21:34,655 --> 00:21:35,957
I mean...

300
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:40,366
I'm the one who should thank you.

301
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:52,344
You may not remember,

302
00:21:53,508 --> 00:21:54,576
but back then,

303
00:21:55,286 --> 00:21:57,583
you were the one who talked to me first.

304
00:22:00,441 --> 00:22:01,320
Eh?

305
00:22:07,648 --> 00:22:08,727
Minoru.

306
00:23:09,901 --> 00:23:10,701
(Next episode)

307
00:23:10,714 --> 00:23:12,358
Was it a dream?

308
00:23:12,382 --> 00:23:15,027
(That meeting came back to memory)
Actually, before I felt sad,

309
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:16,795
(That meeting came back to memory)
I felt a little relieved.

310
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,931
(Going in different directions)
How long...

311
00:23:19,056 --> 00:23:21,484
(Two people being awkward)
have I been alone on weekends?

312
00:23:22,391 --> 00:23:24,503
The feeling still lingers.
