(OST Design)

2
00:00:02,827 --> 00:00:04,071
You know,

3
00:00:04,406 --> 00:00:08,008
my dog at home is getting very old.

4
00:00:08,284 --> 00:00:12,546
When I thought we'd have to
say goodbye soon, I cried.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,515
Well.

6
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:16,783
We understand,
but it still hurts, right?

7
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,420
After graduation,

8
00:00:20,503 --> 00:00:22,523
everyone has to go separate ways.

9
00:00:22,548 --> 00:00:23,790
Right.

10
00:00:24,053 --> 00:00:25,893
We won't see one another again.

11
00:00:25,976 --> 00:00:28,529
That sounds too lonely.

12
00:00:29,757 --> 00:00:31,398
No way.

13
00:00:31,481 --> 00:00:33,233
I totally forgot.

14
00:00:34,191 --> 00:00:36,803
Parting is close to us all.

15
00:00:38,284 --> 00:00:41,008
It's something everyone encounters
and can happen suddenly.

16
00:00:45,992 --> 00:00:47,414
Finally,

17
00:00:48,303 --> 00:00:51,051
I understand what Minoru meant

18
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,921
when he said that.

19
00:00:55,885 --> 00:00:58,492
I'm so happy that I'm scared.

20
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,328
This happiness

21
00:01:03,777 --> 00:01:06,600
could just disappear one day.

22
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:10,321
That...

23
00:01:11,386 --> 00:01:12,406
I...

00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:04,825
"Our Dining Table"

25
00:02:05,398 --> 00:02:06,965
"Episode 10"

26
00:02:06,997 --> 00:02:08,829
Can you come next week?

27
00:02:09,383 --> 00:02:10,998
Yes, I can.

28
00:02:13,482 --> 00:02:15,369
Wait, you two.

29
00:02:15,538 --> 00:02:16,951
What is it, Dad?

30
00:02:17,034 --> 00:02:18,071
Next week,

31
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:20,209
there's no pottery workshop,

32
00:02:20,293 --> 00:02:21,961
so you two can just go out somewhere.

33
00:02:22,551 --> 00:02:23,777
What? Really?

34
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:24,678
Yes.

35
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,680
I'll take care of Tane.

36
00:02:27,142 --> 00:02:30,050
Isn't it good to go out
once in a while like other youngsters?

37
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:31,051
Right?

38
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:32,361
Dad.

39
00:02:32,381 --> 00:02:33,987
Now, you did a good thing
once this year.

40
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:34,821
That's mean.

41
00:02:34,841 --> 00:02:37,624
Three times.
No, I did it around four times.

42
00:02:38,213 --> 00:02:39,980
I'll do that, then.

43
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,661
Okay.

44
00:02:41,063 --> 00:02:41,956
Yutaka.

45
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:43,456
Let's go somewhere.

46
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:45,932
Okay.

47
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,430
Yutaka.

48
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:55,991
Sorry. Am I late?

49
00:02:55,991 --> 00:02:57,811
No, you're early.

50
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,687
How's this?

51
00:03:08,174 --> 00:03:09,105
Oh.

52
00:03:09,145 --> 00:03:10,357
It looks great.

53
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,359
No, it's not for me. It's for you.

54
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,827
Eh?

55
00:03:14,116 --> 00:03:15,996
No. I don't know.

56
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:18,208
No. It looks good. It suits you.

57
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,975
No way. Are you teasing me?

58
00:03:19,975 --> 00:03:21,441
I am not.

59
00:03:27,414 --> 00:03:29,876
Whoa, a mini house.

60
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,013
Right.

61
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:35,484
Your job is about
this kind of thing, right?

62
00:03:35,604 --> 00:03:36,783
Yeah, it is.

63
00:03:36,944 --> 00:03:39,069
Whoa, awesome.

64
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,495
It's not that good.

65
00:03:40,495 --> 00:03:42,422
No, it's super cool.

66
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:45,459
It's really amazing.
Isn't it very detailed?

67
00:03:45,816 --> 00:03:47,894
It's great.
There's three parking spaces.

68
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:49,229
Right.

69
00:03:50,178 --> 00:03:51,085
It's good, right?

70
00:03:51,112 --> 00:03:52,099
Very rich.

71
00:03:53,811 --> 00:03:54,941
The taste is gentle.

72
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,103
Oh, right.

73
00:04:00,621 --> 00:04:02,709
All right, say cheese.

74
00:04:05,706 --> 00:04:07,481
Okay, it's a nice one.

75
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:11,951
What's wrong?

76
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:13,887
Oh.

77
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:18,269
This is just new to me.

78
00:04:21,223 --> 00:04:22,129
Mm.

79
00:04:25,148 --> 00:04:26,900
All right, say cheese.

80
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:31,371
Did you get it?

81
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,372
I am.

82
00:04:33,601 --> 00:04:34,407
What do you mean?

83
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:35,408
I'm filming you.

84
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:36,743
It's a video?

85
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,847
Next time, we should bring Tane.

86
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:42,482
Yeah, right.

87
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:46,887
You said that,
but you always think of your brother.

88
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:51,658
Yutaka.

89
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,928
Thank you so much for today.

90
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:57,831
No, I need to thank you too.

91
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,093
It was very fun.

92
00:04:59,794 --> 00:05:00,667
Mm.

93
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,035
From now on,

94
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,204
let's stay together.

95
00:05:07,115 --> 00:05:09,643
I'm so happy that I'm scared.

96
00:05:14,945 --> 00:05:15,816
Uh.

97
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,486
Yutaka, what's wrong?

98
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,991
No, it's nothing. Let's go.

99
00:05:31,712 --> 00:05:34,501
Ouch, it hurts. Tane, help me.

100
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,003
Help. It bit me.

101
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,690
It got bitten. Help. Roar!

102
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,075
Oh, Minoru is back.

103
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:44,578
Welcome home.

104
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:45,812
Did you have fun?

105
00:05:46,415 --> 00:05:47,247
Yeah.

106
00:05:48,087 --> 00:05:49,950
Hey, where's the gift?

107
00:05:50,178 --> 00:05:51,084
Here.

108
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,786
Yay!

109
00:05:52,865 --> 00:05:54,130
Give it to Mom too.

110
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,021
Okay.

111
00:05:59,488 --> 00:06:01,127
Did something happen?

112
00:06:02,101 --> 00:06:02,863
Huh?

113
00:06:03,886 --> 00:06:05,198
Oh, no.

114
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:09,069
I just feel like

115
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,839
there's still things I don't know.

116
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:15,508
You don't know what?

117
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,377
Want me to tell you?

118
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,874
Nothing.

119
00:06:19,874 --> 00:06:21,181
You should brush your teeth
and go to bed.

120
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:22,582
No way.

121
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,820
What's the matter, Tane?
Aren't you sleepy?

122
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,817
No.

123
00:06:27,817 --> 00:06:28,922
Hmm?

124
00:06:29,504 --> 00:06:32,445
That's not good for you.
Hurry and go to bed.

125
00:06:41,794 --> 00:06:43,003
If one day

126
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,539
I'll have to lose it...

127
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:52,779
It wouldn't hurt much if it happened now.

128
00:06:54,656 --> 00:06:56,116
(Memories)

129
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:00,681
(Mika in yukata)

130
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:24,879
Mr. Ueda?

131
00:07:25,753 --> 00:07:27,506
(Ueda Koji -Yutaka)

132
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:29,319
(I'll make a special dish this week.
You have to come.)

133
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,287
A special dish?

134
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:49,836
Hi.

135
00:07:52,654 --> 00:07:54,207
Thank you for inviting me.

136
00:07:57,266 --> 00:07:58,912
Oh, Yutaka.

137
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:02,111
Today, I'll show my cooking skills.

138
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:03,904
Come on in.

139
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,091
Ta-da.

140
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:12,096
The Ueda family's secret dish.

141
00:08:12,096 --> 00:08:15,795
Tomato kimchi hot pot.
My father's secret recipe.

142
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:17,610
Tomato kimchi?

143
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,832
- Yes.
- Yeah.

144
00:08:19,074 --> 00:08:21,568
We put cheese and tomatoes
in kimchi hot pot.

145
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:23,106
It's our family's go-to dish.

146
00:08:23,164 --> 00:08:26,039
I see. It looks delicious.

147
00:08:26,535 --> 00:08:28,422
Dad. Hurry up.

148
00:08:28,422 --> 00:08:29,909
All right.

149
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:32,212
Back then, I used to make

150
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:34,714
this tomato kimchi hot pot a lot.

151
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,449
And then, Mika

152
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,719
put cheese in it
to make it taste lighter

153
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:41,782
so that Minoru who's still so young

154
00:08:41,992 --> 00:08:43,790
could eat with us.

155
00:08:44,147 --> 00:08:46,459
Oh, is that so?

156
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,828
Here, Yutaka.

157
00:08:48,838 --> 00:08:50,163
Please eat a lot.

158
00:08:50,305 --> 00:08:51,564
Thank you.

159
00:08:53,056 --> 00:08:54,267
All right, then...

160
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,803
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

161
00:08:58,046 --> 00:08:59,039
Blow it first.

162
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:00,407
Blow it.

163
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,059
How many times do I have to blow?

164
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:07,714
Blow it three times.

165
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,515
Mm.

166
00:09:08,685 --> 00:09:10,052
Mr. Ueda, it's delicious.

167
00:09:10,052 --> 00:09:10,884
Right?

168
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,986
Tomatoes go well with kimchi.

169
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,487
That's right.

170
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,190
Calling me a genius will make me blush.

171
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,290
Nobody said that.

172
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:17,943
Oh?

173
00:09:17,943 --> 00:09:19,755
No, you're a genius.

174
00:09:19,755 --> 00:09:20,715
Right?

175
00:09:20,715 --> 00:09:22,982
Don't flatter him. He'll believe it.

176
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:26,380
If you put a baguette in this,
it'll taste even better.

177
00:09:26,464 --> 00:09:27,703
Eh? That's good.

178
00:09:27,703 --> 00:09:29,936
And, Yutaka, sake.

179
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,623
I got it from Mr. Hashida.

180
00:09:31,623 --> 00:09:33,106
The taste is really nice.

181
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,674
Let's open it.

182
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,061
Open it.

183
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:37,306
You can drink, right?

184
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:38,244
Yes.

185
00:09:38,293 --> 00:09:39,373
You look like you can drink.

186
00:09:39,373 --> 00:09:40,480
Please let me join you.

187
00:09:40,563 --> 00:09:43,058
Yutaka, you should stay the night.

188
00:09:43,091 --> 00:09:43,883
Yeah.

189
00:09:50,163 --> 00:09:51,925
I'm stuffed.

190
00:09:51,988 --> 00:09:53,560
Are you okay?

191
00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:56,329
You don't have to go along
with everything Dad says.

192
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:57,697
But...

193
00:09:57,739 --> 00:10:00,633
He said it's a special dish.

194
00:10:00,786 --> 00:10:01,501
Hmm?

195
00:10:01,577 --> 00:10:02,669
Special?

196
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,604
He said that?

197
00:10:05,287 --> 00:10:07,073
Huh? Isn't it?

198
00:10:08,376 --> 00:10:10,243
Minoru, let's take a bath.

199
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,611
Okay, got it.

200
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:15,295
I'll help Tane take a bath.
Make yourself at home.

201
00:10:15,556 --> 00:10:16,549
You can take a bath later.

202
00:10:16,556 --> 00:10:18,418
- Minoru...
- Okay, thank you.

203
00:10:45,215 --> 00:10:46,179
Mr. Ueda.

204
00:10:47,695 --> 00:10:48,748
Oh, Yutaka.

205
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:51,851
Sorry, I made you eat a lot.

206
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,153
It's all right.

207
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,054
It's very good. I also got carried away.

208
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:03,897
That hot pot

209
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:08,735
was the first thing
I cooked for my wife.

210
00:11:11,598 --> 00:11:15,095
(Memories about the proposal)
(Tomato kimchi hot pot)

211
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:16,482
When we're having it,

212
00:11:16,482 --> 00:11:18,378
I said, "Let's become a family."

213
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:21,915
You proposed?

214
00:11:22,037 --> 00:11:22,815
Yes.

215
00:11:23,823 --> 00:11:25,485
So that's why it's special.

216
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:26,419
Right.

217
00:11:27,183 --> 00:11:30,223
I think I should make it for you too.

218
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,558
Eh?

219
00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:35,161
Mika,

220
00:11:35,304 --> 00:11:37,130
Minoru, Tane, and...

221
00:11:37,388 --> 00:11:38,364
you.

222
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,202
When you eat alone,

223
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:45,305
of course, the food
can still be delicious.

224
00:11:46,225 --> 00:11:48,208
But if you can eat with someone,

225
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:51,611
that will make you feel
that it's special.

226
00:11:54,895 --> 00:11:56,115
Actually,

227
00:11:57,471 --> 00:12:00,587
I still wish I had more chances
to eat with Mika.

228
00:12:02,104 --> 00:12:08,122
(Mika in yukata)

229
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:17,470
Well,

230
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:21,908
Mr. Ueda.

231
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,479
How did you get over having to part with

232
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,551
someone so important like Mrs. Ueda?

233
00:12:35,494 --> 00:12:36,522
I mean,

234
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:39,959
I lost my parents when I was young.

235
00:12:42,504 --> 00:12:43,329
But...

236
00:12:43,977 --> 00:12:46,599
I have no memories of that time.

237
00:12:52,714 --> 00:12:53,840
That's why, right now,

238
00:12:55,716 --> 00:12:57,510
it's the first time in my life

239
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:00,713
that I have people
who are really important to me.

240
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:03,470
Mm.

241
00:13:06,849 --> 00:13:10,256
When I think that, one day,
I'll have to lose them,

242
00:13:12,854 --> 00:13:14,260
I feel scared.

243
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:19,999
Because one day,

244
00:13:20,668 --> 00:13:23,102
everyone has to say goodbye.

245
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,573
When I think about that,

246
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,112
I get so scared.

247
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:37,984
That's why.

248
00:13:38,826 --> 00:13:41,450
I think maybe it's better to leave

249
00:13:43,345 --> 00:13:45,999
before someone gets too important.

250
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,430
Honestly,

251
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,667
I have never gotten over
my wife's death.

252
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:57,135
Or what we are now.

253
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:02,195
Even now, I still love my wife,
and I'm still suffering.

254
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:04,418
I used to think,
"If it hurts this much,"

255
00:14:04,465 --> 00:14:06,346
"I wish we had never met."

256
00:14:07,636 --> 00:14:09,382
And I cry at night sometimes.

257
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,150
But,

258
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,454
despite that, I think it's good.

259
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,759
Loving someone,

260
00:14:21,015 --> 00:14:24,630
in my opinion, means accepting
the pain of losing them too.

261
00:14:27,983 --> 00:14:29,335
This pain

262
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:32,472
is proof

263
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,040
that I love my wife.

264
00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:43,936
I'm happy

265
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,620
that I feel this pain.

266
00:14:55,815 --> 00:14:57,663
It's okay, Yutaka.

267
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,003
You're not alone.

268
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:09,409
Thank you

269
00:15:09,504 --> 00:15:11,144
for coming into Minoru and Tane lives.

270
00:15:12,682 --> 00:15:13,813
Thank you so much.

271
00:15:23,731 --> 00:15:25,084
When we have to part,

272
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:27,627
let's feel the pain together.

273
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,531
Okay.

274
00:15:55,381 --> 00:15:57,323
Yutaka is sleeping over.

275
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,624
All right, I'll turn off the light.

276
00:15:59,046 --> 00:16:01,127
Awesome. Isn't awesome
that you're sleeping over with us?

277
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:02,438
Yes, it's awesome.

278
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:04,931
Let's sing.

279
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,411
And read picture books.

280
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:09,035
Quit it. It's bedtime for kids now.

281
00:16:09,071 --> 00:16:10,136
Okay.

282
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:12,572
Let's play tomorrow.

283
00:16:12,655 --> 00:16:13,473
Okay.

284
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:16,509
Here.

285
00:16:16,635 --> 00:16:17,780
Good night.

286
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,979
- Good night.
- Good night.

287
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,403
Yutaka.

288
00:16:44,826 --> 00:16:45,805
Are you still awake?

289
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:47,673
I am.

290
00:16:49,394 --> 00:16:50,910
Can I go over there?

291
00:16:56,218 --> 00:16:57,084
Yes.

292
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,706
I also have something
to talk to you about.

293
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,313
It's about when we went out together.

294
00:17:28,774 --> 00:17:29,682
Okay.

295
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:34,820
Minoru, you're too important to me.

296
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:39,025
I suddenly got scared.

297
00:17:43,835 --> 00:17:44,848
Is that so?

298
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:49,835
I also...

299
00:17:50,158 --> 00:17:52,104
have something to talk to you about.

300
00:17:55,635 --> 00:17:56,501
What?

301
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,362
If there's something bothering you,

302
00:18:17,413 --> 00:18:18,898
I want you to talk to me.

303
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:26,839
It's about the two of us.

304
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,542
We should think about it together.

305
00:18:37,672 --> 00:18:38,484
Okay.

306
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:41,454
Thank you, Minoru.

307
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:07,113
I will...

308
00:19:07,966 --> 00:19:10,650
never forget about tonight
for the rest of my life.

309
00:19:15,293 --> 00:19:17,823
The sweet sound of Tane breathing
while he's asleep.

310
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,063
The warmth of Minoru's hand

311
00:19:25,357 --> 00:19:27,533
while we're secretly
holding each other's hands.

312
00:19:37,931 --> 00:19:39,145
And...

313
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,214
what I've decided.

314
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,555
Ohata, please take care of this.

315
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,389
Okay.

316
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,058
Oh.

317
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:55,673
Hozumi, you look more relaxed.
No, you look brighter.

318
00:19:55,673 --> 00:19:56,896
- Huh?
- Yeah.

319
00:19:57,065 --> 00:19:59,432
Hozumi has been talking more
to everyone, right?

320
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:00,466
- Yeah.
- Right.

321
00:20:00,795 --> 00:20:02,234
Huh? You don't know?

322
00:20:02,336 --> 00:20:03,069
What?

323
00:20:03,404 --> 00:20:05,404
Of course, I know.

324
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,441
Hozumi probably hates you.

325
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:10,524
He doesn't hate me. He even likes me.

326
00:20:29,511 --> 00:20:32,918
(Hozumi Yuki)
(Mom's birthday is next month. Coming?)

327
00:20:32,944 --> 00:20:35,683
(I'll go. And I'll bring a present.)

328
00:20:43,706 --> 00:20:46,312
Teacher, goodbye.

329
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:48,076
Goodbye, Tane.

330
00:20:49,085 --> 00:20:51,584
Yukata, Minoru.

331
00:20:52,741 --> 00:20:54,001
Tane, welcome back.

332
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:55,888
Yukata, Yukata.

333
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,356
Don't get too excited.

334
00:20:57,945 --> 00:20:59,558
What are we eating today?

335
00:20:59,721 --> 00:21:02,191
Today? Shall we make your favorite dish?

336
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:04,219
Then...

337
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:07,433
Um... I want that thing.

338
00:21:08,322 --> 00:21:09,141
Grenade.

339
00:21:09,224 --> 00:21:11,353
Grenade? Okay,
let's make grenades today.

340
00:21:11,393 --> 00:21:12,540
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

341
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,609
Tane, who is this?

342
00:21:17,165 --> 00:21:18,971
Uh...

343
00:21:19,271 --> 00:21:20,212
I'm...

344
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:21,847
Yukata.

345
00:21:22,195 --> 00:21:23,949
He is my family.

346
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,184
Family?

347
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,051
Yes.

348
00:21:26,454 --> 00:21:28,860
No, he isn't.

349
00:21:30,545 --> 00:21:31,524
No.

350
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:33,826
I am family.

351
00:21:41,381 --> 00:21:43,681
Please be a good friend to Tane.

352
00:21:43,681 --> 00:21:44,570
Okay.

353
00:21:44,813 --> 00:21:46,438
Bye-bye.

354
00:21:49,037 --> 00:21:50,009
Yutaka,

355
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:52,178
what you said just now...

356
00:21:58,362 --> 00:21:59,251
Minoru.

357
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:08,194
From now on, let's stay together
like this forever.

358
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,299
Let's eat together.

359
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,537
And live our lives together forever.

360
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,111
Okay.

361
00:22:27,187 --> 00:22:29,882
Why were you the one who answered?

362
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:31,250
Oh.

363
00:22:31,585 --> 00:22:32,484
Oh.

364
00:22:32,825 --> 00:22:33,719
Oh.

365
00:22:34,055 --> 00:22:36,555
Minoru is crying, Tane.

366
00:22:37,163 --> 00:22:39,358
- I'm not.
- Minoru is crying. Look.

367
00:22:39,654 --> 00:22:42,494
Why are you stroking my back? Hey.

368
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,030
What's with that look?
Hey, what are you doing?

369
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:46,966
This thing

370
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:51,003
will continue to be like this.

371
00:22:53,894 --> 00:22:55,641
Our dining table.

372
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:58,444
Hey, what is it?

373
00:22:58,444 --> 00:22:59,945
It's dangerous.

374
00:23:06,007 --> 00:23:08,067
(This story is a work of fiction)
