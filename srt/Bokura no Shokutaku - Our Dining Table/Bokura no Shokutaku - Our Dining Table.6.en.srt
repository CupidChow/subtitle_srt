1
00:00:08,101 --> 00:00:10,846
Hey, will Santa come to see me?

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,503
Oh.

3
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:13,013
Santa will come if you're a good kid.

4
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:14,848
Can't wait for Christmas, right?

5
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:15,749
Right.

6
00:00:16,548 --> 00:00:20,587
- Then, we should hurry back to Mom.
What should we do? What do you want?

7
00:00:40,068 --> 00:00:41,380
- Wanna try opening that?

8
00:01:44,343 --> 00:01:49,812
"Our Dining Table"

9
00:01:50,505 --> 00:01:53,279
"Episode 6"

10
00:01:53,285 --> 00:01:55,779
(Couple discount available now)

11
00:01:55,803 --> 00:01:56,950
- Manager.
- Yes.

12
00:01:57,263 --> 00:01:58,538
What is this?

13
00:02:00,272 --> 00:02:01,888
It's almost Christmas.

14
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,459
I just thought we should have
some sort of promotion too.

15
00:02:07,038 --> 00:02:09,830
Will couples come
to eat ramen on Christmas?

16
00:02:11,385 --> 00:02:12,419
It's all right.

17
00:02:13,636 --> 00:02:18,572
I hope from the bottom of my heart that
they'll eat ramen here on a romantic night.

18
00:02:19,444 --> 00:02:21,508
So, it'll be romantic because of ramen.

19
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:22,709
You know,

20
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:25,912
an important day should be spent
with an important person.

21
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:30,656
With delicious food like our
ramen, it could be romantic too.

22
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:31,518
I see.

23
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:32,662
What about you?

24
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:34,388
What's your plan on Christmas?

25
00:02:34,412 --> 00:02:36,571
What do you mean?
I signed up for a shift.

26
00:02:36,595 --> 00:02:38,892
No, I mean, at night.

27
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,861
The same as every day.

28
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:42,863
No way.

29
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,564
Don't you have someone?

30
00:02:45,244 --> 00:02:46,533
Have what?

31
00:02:49,524 --> 00:02:51,004
Someone...

32
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,673
you want to spend time with.

33
00:02:52,976 --> 00:02:54,381
No one at all?

34
00:02:56,082 --> 00:02:59,243
I guess it's Tane. Right, you're going to
spend the time with Tane and your family.

35
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,441
Mm, it's very good!

36
00:03:27,737 --> 00:03:28,675
Really?

37
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,410
I'm relieved.

38
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:32,779
Now you know how to make one more dish.

39
00:03:33,303 --> 00:03:35,415
Well, but it's nothing special.

40
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:37,651
That's not right.

41
00:03:37,776 --> 00:03:38,752
It's amazing.

42
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:42,287
Hehehe.

43
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:44,591
Tane, Minoru's food is delicious, right?

44
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:46,860
Yes, much better than before.

45
00:03:47,131 --> 00:03:48,015
Hey!

46
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:50,213
Oh.

47
00:03:55,245 --> 00:03:56,670
Okay, you're clean.

48
00:04:05,497 --> 00:04:07,507
I'll get going, then.

49
00:04:07,686 --> 00:04:08,548
Okay.

50
00:04:09,931 --> 00:04:10,951
Minoru.

51
00:04:12,634 --> 00:04:13,485
Huh?

52
00:04:13,763 --> 00:04:14,888
What's wrong?

53
00:04:15,372 --> 00:04:17,891
Oh, no. Well...

54
00:04:20,487 --> 00:04:21,888
The 25th.

55
00:04:23,028 --> 00:04:24,598
The 25th?

56
00:04:26,513 --> 00:04:28,294
It's Christmas, right?

57
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,171
Yeah.

58
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,738
Right.

59
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:36,676
Well...

60
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:38,979
What about Christmas?

61
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:41,314
Well...

62
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,353
Do you have any plans?

63
00:04:44,436 --> 00:04:45,210
Eh?

64
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,187
If you're free,

65
00:04:47,904 --> 00:04:49,289
it's a rare chance, so the two of us...

66
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,791
Yukata.

67
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,993
What's the matter, Tane?

68
00:04:53,688 --> 00:04:55,829
This is for you. It's an invitation.

69
00:04:56,058 --> 00:04:57,649
(Christmas party)

70
00:04:57,674 --> 00:04:59,491
Christmas party...

71
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,836
Yes, with my brother and dad.

72
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,105
We will eat some cake and play.

73
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:06,940
Wow, that sounds like fun.

74
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:09,250
Oh.

75
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,678
Were you going to
invite me to this party?

76
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,047
Yes.

77
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:16,716
Thank you.

78
00:05:16,771 --> 00:05:17,717
I can't wait.

79
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,119
Let's play cards.

80
00:05:19,392 --> 00:05:20,420
And Othello.

81
00:05:20,968 --> 00:05:22,789
And draw too.

82
00:05:22,813 --> 00:05:24,524
Okay, let's do everything.

83
00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:26,728
And let's exchange gifts.

84
00:05:26,752 --> 00:05:27,779
Hey, Tane.

85
00:05:28,256 --> 00:05:30,397
That's great. Let's exchange gifts too.

86
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,165
Hooray!

87
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:33,633
Sorry, he's being inconsiderate.

88
00:05:33,657 --> 00:05:34,501
Not at all.

89
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,870
I really can't wait.

90
00:05:37,097 --> 00:05:39,139
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

91
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:41,041
I'll get going now.

92
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:41,842
Be safe.

93
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,233
Bye-bye.

94
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:44,444
Bye.

95
00:05:50,453 --> 00:05:52,152
You're too much.

96
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,388
Why do you keep interrupting
important moments?

97
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,469
Bro, you can't wait
for the Christmas party too, right?

98
00:06:02,444 --> 00:06:03,496
Right.

99
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:05,999
I can't wait.

100
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:23,049
(Christmas party)
Party?

101
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,652
It's the first time I have a fun plan

102
00:06:32,498 --> 00:06:33,827
on Christmas night.

103
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,411
Thank you for all your hard work.

104
00:07:01,411 --> 00:07:02,318
Thank you for all your hard work.

105
00:07:02,318 --> 00:07:03,390
Thank you for all your hard work.

106
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,871
Hozumi, you're not leaving?

107
00:07:10,246 --> 00:07:12,065
I want to finish this first.

108
00:07:12,338 --> 00:07:15,135
You work until late every night.
Will you be okay?

109
00:07:15,841 --> 00:07:19,539
Working too hard might ruin your body.
Be careful.

110
00:07:20,976 --> 00:07:22,509
Thank you.

111
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,776
And thank you for all your hard work.

112
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:24,945
Thank you for all your hard work.

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,733
(OST Design)

114
00:07:34,482 --> 00:07:36,323
Just a little more.

115
00:07:46,691 --> 00:07:49,002
Then, tomorrow,
I'll go there in the late afternoon.

116
00:07:49,088 --> 00:07:50,503
Okay, got it.

117
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:52,490
It might not be much,
but I'll make the food.

118
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:53,440
Really?

119
00:07:53,464 --> 00:07:56,998
Even though I said that,
I can only start preparing after work.

120
00:07:57,022 --> 00:07:58,511
Don't expect too much.

121
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,293
I really can't wait.

122
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:01,915
Okay.

123
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,939
Yukata.

124
00:08:04,624 --> 00:08:07,420
I already brushed my teeth

125
00:08:07,506 --> 00:08:09,556
and cleaned my room.

126
00:08:09,931 --> 00:08:11,324
Aren't I a good boy?

127
00:08:11,683 --> 00:08:13,752
Yes, you're a good boy, Tane.

128
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:14,995
But what's going on?

129
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:16,730
It's Santa.

130
00:08:16,878 --> 00:08:17,731
Oh.

131
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:19,499
Yukata, do you know?

132
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,469
If you're not a good kid,
Santa won't come to see you.

133
00:08:22,515 --> 00:08:23,592
Of course, I know.

134
00:08:23,617 --> 00:08:27,607
I'm a good kid, so he will surely come.

135
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:28,742
That's right.

136
00:08:28,898 --> 00:08:31,077
You're a good kid.
He'll definitely go see you.

137
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:32,877
All right, it's time
for the good kid to go to bed.

138
00:08:32,877 --> 00:08:34,381
If you don't sleep soon,
Santa won't come, you know.

139
00:08:34,506 --> 00:08:35,515
He's not coming now.

140
00:08:36,987 --> 00:08:38,121
I'm going to bed.

141
00:08:39,673 --> 00:08:42,022
Yukata, good night.

142
00:08:42,046 --> 00:08:43,523
Yeah, good night.

143
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:49,729
Lately, he's away been like that.

144
00:08:49,901 --> 00:08:52,399
If Santa could come every day,
that'd be great.

145
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,009
Eh?

146
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:56,777
Yutaka, what's wrong?

147
00:08:57,117 --> 00:08:57,611
Uh.

148
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,939
No, nothing. See you tomorrow.

149
00:09:00,197 --> 00:09:02,197
Okay, good night.

150
00:09:30,574 --> 00:09:32,639
Yay! It's Santa!

151
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,573
He's up.

152
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:34,841
He is up.

153
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:38,211
Yay! It's Santa!

154
00:09:38,235 --> 00:09:40,115
Wow, that's great, Tane.

155
00:09:40,115 --> 00:09:41,748
- That's great.
- Right?

156
00:09:43,675 --> 00:09:44,517
Oh.

157
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,362
He didn't come to see you?

158
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,188
He doesn't come to see grownups.

159
00:09:48,765 --> 00:09:49,722
Why?

160
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,158
Did you have a fight with Santa?

161
00:09:52,182 --> 00:09:53,093
Who would do that?

162
00:09:53,117 --> 00:09:55,117
Come on, Tane. Let's see what's inside.

163
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:55,895
Okay.

164
00:09:56,165 --> 00:09:57,919
All right, I'm off to work.

165
00:09:57,943 --> 00:09:59,199
Okay, be safe.

166
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,039
Hello?

167
00:10:07,477 --> 00:10:08,908
Sorry, Minoru.

168
00:10:08,979 --> 00:10:10,110
Huh? Yutaka?

169
00:10:10,134 --> 00:10:11,878
You sound weird.

170
00:10:12,316 --> 00:10:13,279
Are you okay?

171
00:10:13,553 --> 00:10:15,482
I don't think I'm okay.

172
00:10:16,155 --> 00:10:17,083
Huh?

173
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,943
Now, the plan is ruined.

174
00:11:00,822 --> 00:11:03,296
I really want to go to the party.

175
00:11:13,295 --> 00:11:14,897
In the end,

176
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:20,079
even though I've grown up,
I still can't enjoy Christmas.

177
00:11:57,825 --> 00:11:59,059
Minoru...

178
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:02,288
You didn't pick up my calls.
I thought you collapsed or something.

179
00:12:02,632 --> 00:12:03,403
Uh...

180
00:12:03,405 --> 00:12:05,080
Sorry, I was asleep.

181
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:08,328
It's a relief that you're alive.

182
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,015
Will Tane be okay?

183
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:30,850
He's fine.

184
00:12:31,202 --> 00:12:34,621
Dad said he's so excited
and kept playing with the gift he got.

185
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:36,856
Is that so?

186
00:12:37,684 --> 00:12:38,925
It's a relief

187
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:42,595
that this doesn't turn into
an awful memory about Christmas.

188
00:12:44,982 --> 00:12:47,333
Don't worry about others.

189
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,168
Pay attention to yourself too.

190
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:54,304
Here.

191
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,313
Wow.

192
00:13:03,294 --> 00:13:04,670
Right.

193
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,387
You said we have to eat udon when sick.

194
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,124
Yeah.

195
00:13:08,248 --> 00:13:10,056
My mom's legendary udon.

196
00:13:10,642 --> 00:13:14,060
She'd chop up yuzu peel and put it
on the soft boiled udon noodles.

197
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:15,528
Yuzu?

198
00:13:15,552 --> 00:13:16,401
Yeah.

199
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,722
Back then, there was a
yuzu tree in the garden.

200
00:13:18,746 --> 00:13:20,333
So she'd pick some and put it in.

201
00:13:20,427 --> 00:13:22,001
But I just bought this.

202
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,438
So, this is your mom's version.

203
00:13:25,907 --> 00:13:26,773
Yeah.

204
00:13:27,022 --> 00:13:28,508
My mom taught me.

205
00:13:32,747 --> 00:13:33,880
Please.

206
00:13:36,244 --> 00:13:38,007
Thank you for the food.

207
00:13:56,145 --> 00:13:57,303
It's delicious.

208
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,305
The taste is very gentle.

209
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,641
That's great.

210
00:14:03,965 --> 00:14:07,180
I'm glad I got to know
a lot of your mom's dishes.

211
00:14:08,983 --> 00:14:09,985
Is that so?

212
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:35,074
I'll put fruit and yogurt in the fridge.
You should eat them later.

213
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,576
Thank you.

214
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,652
It's cold. You should put on a jacket.

215
00:14:47,044 --> 00:14:47,791
Oh.

216
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:48,764
Sorry.

217
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:57,497
Bye, then.

218
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:01,968
Are you leaving now?

219
00:15:04,707 --> 00:15:05,473
Hmm?

220
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:06,599
Uh.

221
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:07,445
Sorry.

222
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,009
I had to sleep here alone,

223
00:15:10,652 --> 00:15:12,845
so I got a little lonely.

224
00:15:23,165 --> 00:15:25,925
I'll stay with you
until you stop feeling lonely, then.

225
00:15:29,784 --> 00:15:30,797
Thank you.

226
00:15:37,873 --> 00:15:39,672
About the party, I'm really sorry.

227
00:15:41,586 --> 00:15:42,909
Don't worry about it.

228
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:45,211
We can have another one
when you're better.

229
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:46,846
But...

230
00:15:47,368 --> 00:15:49,916
It's Christmas, but because of me...

231
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,026
Well.

232
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,029
Can I tell you my story?

233
00:16:06,355 --> 00:16:07,099
Yeah.

234
00:16:18,864 --> 00:16:20,112
My mom

235
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,748
died two years ago.

236
00:16:25,965 --> 00:16:28,020
Mom had always been weak,

237
00:16:28,176 --> 00:16:29,522
but after she gave birth to Tane,

238
00:16:29,658 --> 00:16:32,058
she was diagnosed with a serious
illness, and then passed away.

239
00:16:45,998 --> 00:16:48,475
Her baby is still so young.
I feel so sorry for her.

240
00:16:56,829 --> 00:16:58,751
Where is Mom?

241
00:17:03,783 --> 00:17:05,791
Tane, come here.

242
00:17:13,646 --> 00:17:17,336
We won't get to see Mom again.

243
00:17:22,756 --> 00:17:24,110
Never again.

244
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,921
So that's how it was.

245
00:17:37,217 --> 00:17:39,392
I've never told you, right?

246
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:42,461
I just want you to know.

247
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:48,134
Thank you

248
00:17:48,249 --> 00:17:49,502
for telling me.

249
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,707
We don't usually
get to be alone like this.

250
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,009
So,

251
00:17:57,044 --> 00:17:59,345
maybe it's good that
this Christmas turned out like this.

252
00:18:01,777 --> 00:18:02,527
Eh?

253
00:18:05,653 --> 00:18:07,653
I bought a small one
from the supermarket.

254
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,690
It's so cute.

255
00:18:12,835 --> 00:18:14,160
It's an important day.

256
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:16,635
Spending it with an important person

257
00:18:17,091 --> 00:18:18,531
is enough.

258
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:24,870
Is that so?

259
00:18:26,918 --> 00:18:27,974
I see.

260
00:18:34,182 --> 00:18:35,114
I think...

261
00:18:35,617 --> 00:18:39,853
This is the first time I'm looking at a
Christmas tree with such a good feeling.

262
00:18:41,008 --> 00:18:42,221
Is that so?

263
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:43,701
Yeah.

264
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,691
Actually,

265
00:18:45,861 --> 00:18:48,461
I've never liked Christmas.

266
00:18:53,158 --> 00:18:54,045
I think

267
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:55,501
you must have...

268
00:18:56,063 --> 00:18:57,269
been through a lot of things too.

269
00:18:59,262 --> 00:19:01,262
I want to hear about it all.

270
00:19:03,911 --> 00:19:04,977
All of it?

271
00:19:05,507 --> 00:19:06,278
Yes.

272
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:10,650
I want you to tell me everything.

273
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,551
And I will...

274
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:14,687
listen really well.

275
00:19:21,773 --> 00:19:23,021
Should I?

276
00:19:24,408 --> 00:19:25,112
Hmm?

277
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,368
I've never thought about

278
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:32,672
telling it to anyone.

279
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:35,508
But...

280
00:19:37,456 --> 00:19:39,045
If it's Minoru...

281
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,549
Hmm?

282
00:20:22,396 --> 00:20:24,557
Will Yukata be okay?

283
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:28,861
I heard he has a fever
because he worked too hard.

284
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:30,830
He'll be better soon.

285
00:20:34,371 --> 00:20:35,911
Yukata won't die, right?

286
00:20:36,219 --> 00:20:37,870
No, he won't.

287
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,143
I want to go to Yukata's house too.

288
00:20:44,258 --> 00:20:46,011
Your brother already went there.

289
00:20:46,414 --> 00:20:47,494
It's all right.

290
00:20:49,274 --> 00:20:50,683
So...

291
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:52,017
Can I call them?

292
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:53,452
Um...

293
00:20:54,148 --> 00:20:56,355
Can you hang on for now?

294
00:20:56,438 --> 00:20:57,449
Okay.

295
00:20:57,644 --> 00:20:58,424
All right.

296
00:20:59,086 --> 00:21:00,526
It's all right.

297
00:21:46,595 --> 00:21:51,713
(To Tane)

298
00:21:55,298 --> 00:21:58,331
(To Minoru)

299
00:21:58,344 --> 00:21:59,418
What?

300
00:21:59,448 --> 00:22:00,686
There's one for me too.

301
00:22:09,273 --> 00:22:10,712
It's the same thing.

302
00:23:10,031 --> 00:23:10,845
(Next episode)

303
00:23:10,858 --> 00:23:11,845
I'm glad you're here with me, Minoru.

304
00:23:11,845 --> 00:23:13,301
(Want to tell my feelings)
I'm glad you're here with me, Minoru.

305
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:15,065
(and all my stories)
You may not remember...

306
00:23:15,085 --> 00:23:15,878
(To Minoru)

307
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,163
(Hidden feelings are flowing out)
Yutaka talked to me first.

308
00:23:18,853 --> 00:23:19,865
I used to be

309
00:23:20,515 --> 00:23:22,093
scared of eating with people
at the same table

310
00:23:22,093 --> 00:23:24,069
and being beside someone.
