00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,700
that young people love,

196
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,490
like time travel or rebirth,

197
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,340
would make it even better.

198
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,660
Once

199
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,930
the contract's signed,

200
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,810
we'll

201
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,140
tweak the comic

202
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,700

204
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:00,980
Sounds good.

205
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,810
- Absolutely not! - It's settled, then!

206
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,760
Mr. Wang, I told you "Farewell..."

207
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,370
- Don't mind her. - Excuse me. I need to take this.

208
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,490
Jiang Nanfeng,

209
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,140
thank goodness you called.

210
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,780
Do you know

211
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,290
how disgusting these people are?

212
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,850
Of course I do.

213
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,540
The whole world knows now!

214
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,050
The whole world?

215
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,020
Didn't you check social media?

216
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,780
Check now!

217
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,580
It's blowing up!

218

Why am I so sure

219
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,370
"Half a Farewell Song"

220
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,530
used AI?

221
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,180
First, look at these strands of hair on the left.

222
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,790
The structure is all wrong.

223
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,890
The more you look, the weirder it gets.

224
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:37,640
What?

225
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,940
And check out the leaves on her chest.

226
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,100
Aren't they super blurry?

227
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,580
They don't match the sharpness of the rest

228
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,730
of the image at all.

229
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,940
Also, look at the building in the distance.

230
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,180
The eaves and pillars

231
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,420
are so rough.

232
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,180
There's ghosting, too.

233
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,060
I mean, how could this

234
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,940
not be AI-generated?

235
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,580
Zhai!

236
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,060
I didn't do it!

237
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,010
Yeah, yeah,

238
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,850
I don't care.

239
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,340
Whether you did it or not

240
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,490

245
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,730
assistant.

246
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,300
Let Manman take the fall.

247
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,250
I'll compensate her.

248
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,730
I can't do that.

249
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,530
Do you really think

250
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,700
this is the time to be stubborn?

251
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,890
I'm not being stubborn.

252
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,180
This is about integrity.

253
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,220
Manman had nothing

254
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,120
to do with this.

255
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,040
Why should she take the blame?

258
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,960
I drew it.

387
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,010
is doing a book signing here!

388
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,940
Really? Hurry up.

389
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,850
Zhai?

390
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:36,700
Let's go.

391
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,850
Nobody's here.

392
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,250
Who is this fake Zhai?

393
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,060
No idea.

394
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,180
I want to know, too.

395
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,530
Do you think

396
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,700
I'll finally get to meet

397
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,820
the real Zhai today?

398
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,490
I think so.

399
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,820
Otherwise, who would be signing?

400
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,650
She'll be here any second.

401
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,530
I'm so excited!

402
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,220
She hasn't shown her face

403
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,130
since she got famous.

404
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,730
She's probably

405
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,890
just doing this signing

406
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,300
to shift attention away

407
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,530
from the AI scandal

408
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,650
after it blew up.

409
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,580
Now, let's give Miss Zhai

410
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,180
a big hand!

411
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,850
"Half a Farewell Song" is the pride of Chinese comics this year.

412
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,610
It's been a massive hit and has topped every chart!

413
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,300
Wu Manman?

414
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,130
Hello, everyone.

415
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,220
I'm Zhai.

416
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,370
Calm down.

417
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,490
Don't stop me.

418
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,490
I'll go rip those stupid buns

419
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,220
off her head!

420
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,220
She must be behind all this!

421
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,470
I don't think it's her.

422
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,500
She's probably not pretending

423
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,940
to be Zhai by choice.

424
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:39,980
Wei Zhi,

425
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,420
she's already standing up there.

426
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,490
- Let's just wait and see. - Now,

427
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,820
let's kick off the book signing!

428
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,610
I like this one.

429
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,820
This badge is cute, too.

430
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,130
Look at this lenticular card.

431
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,060
It's actually pretty nice.

432
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,850
Should we just buy everything?

433
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,980
- Yeah, let's buy it all. - Alright.

434
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,680
[Shan]

435
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,750
Ah!

436
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,180
Tiger Comics just announced an official

437
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,980

438
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,180
book signing!

439
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,890
Miss Zhai herself will be there!

440
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,130
She hasn't

441
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,340
attended a signing in years!

442
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,490
- Get her signed sketch for me... - A signed sketch?

443
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,490
Please!

444
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,490
Just buy a copy of "Half a Farewell Song" on-site

445
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,530
and get her to sign it for me!

446

[Got it]

447
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,580
Miss Zhai, I've been a fan

448
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,610
since your webtoon days!

449
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,100
[Zhai]
You're amazing!

450
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,280
- Same! - I can't believe I'm finally meeting you in person.

451
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,770
Can I take a picture with you?

452
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,490
Of course.

453
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,010
Awesome.

454
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,580
So cute!

455
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,530
Thank you.

456
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,610
Zhai,

457
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,370
aren't you going

458
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,100
to explain

459
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,130
the AI controversy?

460
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,220
What's your deal?

461
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,890
If you don't like her, just leave.

462
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,130
Stop stirring up trouble.

463
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,890
What's it to you?

464
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,220
- Did I ask you? - If you don't like her, go!

465
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,010
- Mind your own business. - Alright, enough.

466
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,220
Let's not fight.

467
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,480
Zhai, say something. Explain yourself!

468
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,490
All you have to do

469
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,490
is sign this contract today,

470
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,340
and starting tomorrow, you'll be Zhai.

[Comic Creator Collaboration Agreement]
All of Zhai's works

472
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,420
will be yours.

473
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,610
With Zhai's current popularity

474
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,180
and massive fanbase,

475
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:57,250
this is a golden opportunity!

476
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,890
Only an idiot

477
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,820
would pass it up.

478
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,580
Didn't you promise

479
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,980
you'd never use AI?

480
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,010
So what's this?

481
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,980
Why aren't you saying anything?

482
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,490
You owe us an explanation!

483
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,660
Say something, Zhai!

484
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,290
Own up to your mistakes!

have the guts to admit it!

If you're not here for the signing,

488
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,380
leave!

Zhai doesn't need fake fans like you!

Oh, so now

491
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,420
we can't even question her?

492
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:20,980
This is a book signing.

Are you kidding me?

510
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,250
How could you

511
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,140
just quit the signing midway?

512
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,420

00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,490
I just saw Wei Zhi.

She's selling merch at her own booth.

517

What, is she broke now?

What's she selling?

519
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,050
I heard it's "Farewell Song" merch.

520
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:28,730
Hey, look.

521
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:29,940
That booth's art style

522
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,900
looks just like Zhai's.

523
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,380
It's even more Zhai than Zhai's own works.

524
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,290
I totally would've

525
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,660
thought these were Zhai's drawings.

526
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,120
Forget it.

I'm not a fan anymore.

528
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,180

Alright then.

Sorry, Mr. Bear.

From whom?

they're out here

Look, they filed a complaint.

00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,050
Can I ask you for a favor?

558
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,010
I just heard people saying

559
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,490
how your art style is similar to Zhai's.

560
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,730

561
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,140
to get Zhai's signed sketch no matter what.

562
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,700
She's a huge fan.

00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,980
I don't want to disappoint her,

564
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:11,900
so...

565
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,010
So, you want me to do the sketch?

566
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,980
I'll pay for it.

567
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,810
Hand it over.

568
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,700
I don't have cash.

569
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,490
Can I scan to pay?

570
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,140
I meant the book.

They weren't wrong.

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,290
and at 4:30 PM, we start clearing the slopes.

766
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,860
Why did you come this late?

767
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,490
It's your fault.

768
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,860
You had to do full glam.

769
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,420
Excuse me, miss.

770
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,530
Have you looked

771
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,530
at yourself?

772
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,620
Besides,

773
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,940
this is my way of showing respect

774
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,940
to the god of snow.

775
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,330
Having no makeup on would be rude.

776
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,330
Well said!

777
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,490
One must respect the snow.

778
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,860
We can't let down

779
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,700
young folks like them.

780
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,570
The god of snow

781
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,140
is about to grant your wish.

782
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,810
Wait here.

783
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,810
Who is this guy?

784
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,220
Is he going to get us

785
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,090
instructors?

786
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,010
Are we getting instructors?

787
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:08,810
Chong,

788
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,330
taking a nap?

789
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,660
I've got a student for you.

790
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,660
No one's available, huh?

791
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,730
What are you talking about?

792
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,940
You are available, aren't you?

793
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,770
You must really be bored

794
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,940
to be meddling in stuff like this.

795
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,490
Come on. Be more positive!

796
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,530
Isn't it a good thing

797
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,570
that the rescue team has no work?

798
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:39,940
I get it.

799
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:40,980
Kids these days

800
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,900
love snowboarding.

801
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,220
It's flashy and cool.

802
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,290
But think about it.

803
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,490
How many actually use a snowboard for rescue operations?

804
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,900
And how many rescuers jump out of helicopters

805
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,900
with a snowboard?

806
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,730
Honestly,

807
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,980
young people these days

808
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,010
are missing out.

809
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,420
Skiing is an underrated luxury.

810
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:56,980
Look, those two over there.

811
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:01,980
Very cute.

812
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,570
Hey, Chong,

813
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,420
please don't go.

814
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,770
Two newbies?

815
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,900
Are you trying to kill me?

816
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,050
I'm not asking you to handle both.

817
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,570
Yan's here too, isn't he?

818
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,660
Don't hog all the fun.

819
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,570
Share the burden.

820
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:14,810
He's practically an influencer now.

821
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,900
He won't listen to me.

822
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,530
Why would he turn you down?

823
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,980
Doesn't he want you to teach him jumps?

824
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,620
Look,

825
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,860
it's already 2 PM.

826
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,900
The snow outside

827
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,290
is basically slush.

828
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,620
Just take on a newbie

829
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,570
- and make some cash. - Wei Zhi.

830
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,660
- What are you doing? - What are those two doing?

831
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,900
Praying to the god of snow.

832
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,050
There's no such thing.

833
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,250
I was just messing with you.

834
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,730
You need to be sincere.

835
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,490
Come on.

836
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,330
Let's pray together.

837
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,810
I, your devoted follower, vow to eat a balanced diet

838
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,810
just for a nice, heavy snowfall

839
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,900
- so I can take good pictures! - Alright!

840
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,770
Make it snow for Zhi, please!

841
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,660
Hand it over.

842
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,050
I meant the book.

843
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,700
She's the real Zhai.

844
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,330
Zhai?

845
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,940
Then who was at the book signing?

846
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,980
The third one looks...

847
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,380
Your instructor is here.

848
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,250
Hi,

849
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,530
I'm your coach.

850
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,050
Over here!

851
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,460
Coming!

852
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,380
Yours is on the way.

853
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,490
Follow me.

854
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:48,700
Girl,

855
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,940
your coach

856
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,180
is something else.

857
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,900
He's average.

858
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,980
Average?

859
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:54,730
Did you see

860
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,490
that jawline?

861
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,770
That nose bridge?

862
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,330
Didn't notice.

863
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,770
Wow. Blind to greatness, huh?

864
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,980
Not interested, huh?

865
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,900
Then let's switch...

866
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,260
Hi, what should I call you?

867
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,490
Coach.

868
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,570
Just call me Coach.

869
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,300
Nice to meet you, Coach.

870
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,780
Never snowboarded before?

871
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,170
You can tell?

872
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,170
This fitted ski suit

873
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,090
is meant for skiing.

874
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,650
For snowboarding, looser is better.

875
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,340
One look at your outfits,

876
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,940
and I knew you were newbies.

877
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,570
Come on. Go change.

878
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,650
What's wrong with my outfit?

879
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,260
How tall are you?

880
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,340
I'm 172 cm.

881
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,740
Your board length

882
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,940
depends on your height and weight.

883
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,170
Would you lie

884
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,900
to a doctor, too?

885
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,570
I'm 169 cm.

886
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,650
Snowboard or skis?

887
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:48,620
Snowboard,

888
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,090
149 cm.

889
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,090
Boot size?

890
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,090
- Size 37.5 or 38. - Size 37.

891
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:52,940
Got it.

892
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,420
Chong,

893
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,740
why are you with a newbie today?

894
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,260
Liu dragged me into it.

895
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,690
Only he could make you

896
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,610
do this.

897
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,170
Alright,

898
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,530
I'll get you helmets, goggles,

899
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,490
and a pair of walkie-talkies.

900
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:19,940
Yeah.

901
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:20,940
Get a turtle pad, too.

902
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:21,570
Got it.

903
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,010
I have a question.

904
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:28,860
Shoot.

905
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,010
Are you really a snowboard instructor?

906
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,490
I mean,

907
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,000
all the other instructors

908
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,570
are in uniform.

909
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,780
Why aren't you?

910
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,690
Because I'm better.

911
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:56,530
Girl,

912
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,130
he's a contracted coach

913
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,010
for the pro team.

914
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,260
He's a legend.

915
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,130
Really?

916
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,340
Wow, that's amazing.

917
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,830
Are you out of your mind?

918
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,900
You left Stinky in the snow park?

919
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,990
It's soaked through!

920
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,340
It wasn't even wearing anything.

921
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,210
What if it catches a cold?

922
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,610
All you ever think about is snowboarding.

923
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,420
I don't know what to do with you.

924
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,490
Hurry up and come get it!

925
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,860
I'm leaving it with Liu.

926
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,170
Here, Liu.

927
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:31,940
Easy, easy.

928
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,300
Be careful.

929
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,490
It's drenched.

930
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,130
Alright, I'm hanging up. Bye.

931
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:39,610
Yours.

932
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,090
Alright.

933
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,340
Hi.

934
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,490
You're good!

935
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,130
Uh,

936
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,010
I'm your coach.

937
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:57,860
Just call me Yan.

938
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,490
I'm Jiang Nanfeng.

939
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,570
Uh, Coach,

940
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,690
just so you know,

941
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,090
I'm not athletic at all.

942
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,010
Be prepared.

943
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,010
What do you

944
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:14,980
do for a living?

945
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,940
I paint.

946
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,530
So you're an artist?

947
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,300
You could say that.

948
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:24,980
I draw

949
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,860
comics.

950
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,570
So, what kind of person

951
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,940
do you think can do what you do?

952
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,380
Which is more important,

953
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,740
talent or effort?

954
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:38,010
I think

955
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,820
effort matters more.

956
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,980
Why the sudden question?

957
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,940
Just curious.

958
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:48,340
But who says talent doesn't matter?

959
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,260
Honestly, I think

960
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,090
you're more gifted than your friend.

961
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,010
Really?

962
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:52,740
Yeah.

963
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,420
Your friend's too skinny.

964
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,490
She can't take a fall.

965
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,010
By that logic,

966
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,210
you're a natural.

967
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,420
Coach,

968
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,050
this is literally our first meeting.

969
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,340
Do you have to be this brutal?

970
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:05,610
It was a compliment.

971
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,130
Put on your boots.

972
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,210
What's wrong,

973
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,090
genius?

974
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:22,980
These boots

975
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,740
are so hard to put on.

976
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,490
The laces are all over the place.

977
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,010
How do you even wear these?

978
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,690
Too tight?

979
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,210
What do you think?

980
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,980
When I finish my first run,

981
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,490
I'll probably need a foot amputation.

982
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,420
This is a size 37!

983
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,380
You're wearing smaller boots

984
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,340
because rental ones

985
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,420
get loose over time.

986
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,420
When you're snowboarding,

987
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,420
your power transfers to the board,

988
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,610
so boots are crucial.

989
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,690
Tighter is better.

990
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,260
Okay, Coach, I get it.

991
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,010
You can get up now.

992
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,570
Seriously,

993
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,980
you're making me nervous.

994
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,860
How so?

995
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,490
This is so convenient!

996
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,340
It's like an airport conveyor belt!

997
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,980
People who can't control

998
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,340
their speed or direction are called "bombers."

999
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:40,860
Lesson one of snowboarding:

1000
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,130
watch out for bombers.

1001
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,090
What's lesson two?

1002
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,610
Wear your helmet properly.

1003
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,490
This helmet is hideous.

1004
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:53,980
The one

1005
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,980
I brought is much cuter.

1006
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,210
Do you know what the average life expectancy is

1007
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:56,980
in this country?

1008
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,780
It's 78.6 years.

1009
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,210
Do you know

1010
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,900
why some people

1011
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,650
don't make it that far?

1012
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,170
Because they go snowboarding

1013
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,170
and wear their helmets wrong.

1014
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,090
Turn around.

1015
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,130
Isn't it a little early to be bowing for red envelopes?

1016
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,050
What are you doing?

1017
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:30,010
What are you doing?

1018
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,860
Shouldn't I be the one asking that?
