1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,970
Mechanical friends, Amicus Robots.

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,890
A general name for androids.

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,250
Amicus are imprinted
with the Laws of Respect.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,620
To respect human beings.

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,500
To be obedient to human commands.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,000
To never attack a human being.

7
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,510
It's the same coat of arms.

8
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,770
The attacker used an Elphinstone College
graduation gift knife.

9
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,730
Is the same thing given every year?

10
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,130

11
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,480
{\an8}Without fail.

12
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,860
Well, Elphinstone is
a college for AI researchers.

13
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,950
So one of its alumni could have
found Marvin, modified him,

14
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,160
and had him use their knife
in the attacks.

15
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,330
When you think about it,
isn't that what happened?

16
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,520
Our system code is very complicated.

17
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,170
Even if they are an alumnus,

18
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:33,130
I find it hard to believe there would be
many engineers as skilled as you.

19
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,890
The criminal definitely has
all the necessary equipment.

20
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,720
Though all they need is a tablet
to create a small bug.

21
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,240
Oh, Rib, show Harold to the other room
and have a cup of tea with him.

22
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,590
I see you want to exclude me.

23
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,400
What are you planning
to tell Cyber-Inspector Hieda?

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,240
Naturally, something that will embarrass you.

25
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,240
I hear you hate robots.

26
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,060
Must be tough.

27
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,980
Having that Amicus as a partner.

28
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,400
I've resolved those feelings.

29
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,320
So you've come to like them.

30
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,740
No, not to that extent.

31
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,320
Then, do you like Harold?

32
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,950
You look like you want to kill me.
Are you okay?

33
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,750
Seems like you know
about Harold's mean streak.

34
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,480
I know about it too.

35
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,970
Why was his personality set like that?

36
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,510
You sure ask rude questions.

37
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,240
Harold was a really good kid
when he was newly built.

38
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,490
But then he somehow became that way.

39
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,370
The person who made him
was probably a genius.

40
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,900
How can I say it?
Right. He's grown.

41
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,840
Grown?

42
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,850
I guess that's also a feature of
the next-generation multipurpose AI.

43
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,480
I was told Amicus only feigns
the act of thinking.

44
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,870
Did you hear that from Angus?

45
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,880
Normal Amicus are just
dolls playing pretend.

46
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,800
But I wrote the RF Model
to be smarter than that.

47
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,550
They truly think for themselves.

48
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,850
In a completely different way
from the human thinking process.

49
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,680
In what way?

50
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,750
- I don't know.
- What?

51
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,360
I can explain it logically.

52
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,190
But I don't know the specifics of how they
process information and make a decision.

53
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,990
The black box problem?

54
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,310
Exactly.

55
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,650
A concept that has stumped us for years.

56
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:09,040
The RF Model has a black box bigger
than the mass-produced Amicus.

57
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,330
And it holds the key
to their personalities and growth.

58
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,300
- You're not afraid of Harold?
- What?

59
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,600
You know his real personality, right?

60
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,150
Don't you find him creepy?

61
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,470
He was the one who gave me
a push to move forward.

62
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,170
I see.

63
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:35,060
Well, I'm glad you can
think of him like that.

64
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,530
The head?

65
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,990
We haven't found it.

66
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,500
We have divers searching the river too.

67
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,830
Cyber-inspection Assistant,
go wait on the bridge.

68
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm fine. This is my second time.

69
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,340
How did you know this body is Marvin's?

70
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,050
Oh, the serial number, huh?

71
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,610
It's definitely him.

72
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,390
Poor thing.

73
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,970
How long has the body been here?

74
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,770
We're still determining the exact time,
but it should be less than a day.

75
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,640
You know, Cyber-inspection Assistant,
you really shouldn't be here.

76
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,070
You too, Cyber-Inspector Hieda.

77
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,740
This case is under our jurisdiction.

78
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,310
Let's leave the rest to the police.

79
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,700
All right.

80
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,000
- Yes.
- Hieda.

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,900
I have bad news.

82
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,920
With Marvin's body found,

83
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,930
the RF Model will be further restricted
from all investigations.

84
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,980
It was a mandate from
the International AI Ethics Committee.

85
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,730
This one will suit you very well.

86
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,480
He was the one who gave me a push.

87
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,000
What made me the happiest
was that you defended me.

88
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,820
I promise I'll prove his innocence.

89
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,030
His disposal is on hold.

90
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,110
I will find the perpetrator.

91
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,010
We're asking Inspection Assistant Lucraft
to turn himself in tomorrow morning.

92
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,560
This area is off-limits.

93
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,630
Are you really going to turn yourself in?

94
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,960
The suspicion against me
will only grow stronger if I don't.

95
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,550
I see you are worried about me.

96
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,180
And thank you for your
consideration earlier.

97
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,200
That's not something...

98
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,930
I like how there is a kindness
hidden behind your cold exterior.

99
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,150
Is that supposed to be
a compliment or an insult?

100
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,400
Cyber-Inspector...

101
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,990
Would you like to have dinner with me?

102
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:57,080
Is it fun to drink
when you can't get drunk?

103
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,450
Yes.

104
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:02,460
I'd be even happier if I had a function
that allowed me to get drunk.

105
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,050
Oh, please.

106
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,050
Right, did Dr. Lexie tell you
embarrassing things about me?

107
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,050
If I said she did?

108
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,640
I know a number of embarrassing
episodes from your past.

109
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,430
Shall I share them with you?

110
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,810
Even if it's you,
there's no way you'd know.

111
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,520
At the prom before your graduation,
your classmates...

112
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,570
Please don't glare at me with the eyes
of a killer who has killed three people.

113
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:34,730
You'll be my fourth victim
if you continue that story.

114
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,310
I will end the story here.

115
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm going to crack the case
once and for all.

116
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,620
That is very reassuring.

117
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,070
I'm not joking.

118
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,460
I'll prove your innocence
and catch the criminal.

119
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,590
So don't worry.

120
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,080
You don't have to pretend like that
when you're worried.

121
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,260
Marvin wasn't very human-like.
My brother had his faults.

122
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,360
I last saw him six years ago.

123
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,920
Truthfully, I have no attachment to him.

124
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,290
Our brotherly love is different
from that of you humans.

125
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,370
I see.

126
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,080
But he did not have to die that way.

127
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,830
I am sometimes frightened.

128
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:29,950
Thinking about how adept humans are
at raising beasts within their hearts.

129
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,050
Oh, that was a figure of speech.

130
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,810
I am well aware you are a good person.

131
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,230
Cyber-Inspector...

132
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,890
I leave the rest in your hands.

133
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,530
Shall we get going?

134
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,030
Excuse me.
I have a phone call.

135
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,740
From the chief?

136
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,730
Please wait outside for me.

137
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,510
Chief?

138
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,220
This is Hieda.

139
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,850
I was looking into the alumni
of Elphinstone College.

140
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,550
Did you find anything?

141
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,650
Why is...

142
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,310
Cyber-Inspector Hieda!

143
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,600
Cyber-inspection Assistant Lucraft,
Hieda might be in trouble!

144
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,110
Our call was cut off.

145
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,270
She was kidnapped by the suspect.

146
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,080
The suspect's license plate is...

147
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,350
Cyber-Inspector Echika Hieda.

148
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,580
Read this.

149
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,270
Read it.

150
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,380
"I am Echika Hieda from
the Cybercrime Investigation Department.

151
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,650
If you want me to be released,
analyze the system code...

152
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,930
...of Harold Lucraft.

153
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:52,690
Dr. Lexie Willow Carter is lying
to the International AI Ethics Committee.

154
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:56,610
The RF Models are actually
very dangerous Amicus Robots.

155
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,240
Unless the analysis of Harold
is done by dawn,

156
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:08,210
I will never return to you."

157
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,260
Got it? You have until 6:00 A.M.

158
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,100
I'll take responsibility.

159
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,640
With this, you lose, Lexie.

160
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,910
Nice to meet you,
Cyber-Inspector Hieda.

161
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,600
You killed Marvin?

162
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,650
You're an RF Model,
but you're not Steven

163
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,440
or Harold or Marvin.

164
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,220
Who are you?

165
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,470
An isolation unit?

166
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,160
He's a human?

167
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,050
You'll probably be released by dawn.

168
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,460
You should drink some.

169
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,060
Searching for available networks.

170
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,900
You are back online.

171
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,650
Sending location information.

172
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,940
I was stupid to treat you gently.

173
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,970
Freeze, Aiden Furman!

174
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,090
I apologize for not arriving sooner.

175
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,970
The perpetrator wasn't an RF Model.
He was a human.

176
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,970
That is not important right now.

177
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,640
We just proved your innocence.

178
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,100
That is true.
But, Echika...

179
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,470
You are bleeding.
You need to get treated.

180
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,280
I said I'm fine.

181
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,280
Were you already here by chance,
even before I sent my location data?

182
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,810
We had narrowed down the area.

183
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,580
Of course you would've.

184
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,620
But you gave us the final clue.

185
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,160
Let's get your wound treated.

186
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,290
No need. It's nothing.

187
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:31,740
{\an5}Cybercrime Investigation Department London Branch

188
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,520
{\an8}Darya got past the worst part, right?

189
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,060
Yes.

190
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,900
And thank goodness Echika wasn't hurt.

191
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,350
Aiden Furman.

192
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,310
{\an4}Laurel Robot Cleaning Services
Maintenance Dept
Aiden Furman

193
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,860
{\an8}After graduating Elphinstone College...

194
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,610
...you joined Novae Robotics with her...

195
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,160
{\an8}...and became the Deputy Chief
Cyber-Inspection Assistant
Ross

196
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,620
{\an8}of the RF Model Development Division.

197
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:55,580
You didn't suspect he could have been
the one behind the attacks?

198
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:01,280
You probably think it was stupid of me,
but I didn't suspect him at all.

199
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,190
Besides, I had forgotten all about him.

200
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,890
Yeah, it's been nine years
since I saw him.

201
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:12,680
An Amicus is usually made by combining
the physical attributes of various people,

202
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:18,020
so why was Furman's unmodified appearance
data used for the RF Model?

203
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,280
I heard the two of you were close friends,

204
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,990
but was there something more
to your relationship?

205
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,450
Of course not.

206
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,270
It was out of my respect for him
and I simply liked his looks.

207
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,790
It's a waste to keep that face
only for humans.

208
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,930
There's a record of you accusing
Dr. Lexie of fraud.

209
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,130
Did you have a grudge against her?

210
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,550
Before the RF Model was completed,

211
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:49,070
Furman left the development team
due to a difference of opinion with you.

212
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,910
What did you disagree about?

213
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,510
It wasn't anything serious.

214
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,930
In my opinion,
it was something common and boring.

215
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,400
We've received orders
to Brain Dive into Aiden Furman.

216
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,900
I can ask another investigator
to do it if you're uncomfortable.

217
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,860
I can dive.
I don't have a problem doing it.

218
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,510
Cyber-Inspector Hieda.

219
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,430
Dive as deep as you can into my past.

220
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,610
Cyber-inspection Assistant Lucraft,
are you ready?

221
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,250
Anytime.

222
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,720
However, I will pull you out
as soon as you begin to look unwell.

223
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,710
You're being overprotective.

224
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,910
Nothing.

225
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,180
Commencing the Brain Dive
into Aiden Furman.

226
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm sorry. I didn't want to hurt you.

227
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,850
What the hell am I doing?

228
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,300
It needs to be done.

229
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,800
I have to do it!

230
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,500
Please wait outside for me.

231
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,730
If I hadn't left the restaurant alone,

232
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,400
I wouldn't have been kidnapped.

233
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,820
Who was Assistant Lucraft
on the phone with?

234
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,800
This is Hieda.

235
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,490
Chief?

236
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,790
Echika.

237
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,790
I'll hold your hand.

238
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,100
It's not here.

239
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,570
Nothing? Still nothing?

240
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,990
Why isn't it being reported?!

241
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,130
Lexie.

242
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,720
An RF Model went against
the Laws of Respect and shot a human?

243
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,600
What's going on? Why now?

244
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,430
Lexie.

245
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,250
That tabloid was the catalyst
for the attacks.

246
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:56,510
He probably thought he could use the article
to destroy Dr. Lexie's credibility.

247
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,200
Is something wrong?

248
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,770
He didn't have a grudge against Dr. Lexie.

249
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,550
His motive wasn't his hatred
for the victims or to commit an assault.

250
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:14,010
It feels more like he did it
out of his sense of responsibility.

251
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,980
We may need to dive even deeper.

252
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,750
Why don't we have him
psychoanalyzed first?

253
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,850
Cyber-Inspector...

254
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,810
You haven't had a counter-current
in a while. As expected, you're not well.

255
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,550
I'm fine. It's because
I didn't get enough sleep.

256
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,780
So? Is he okay?

257
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:39,780
He's doing fine, but we requested
a psychoanalysis just in case.

258
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:43,230
He'll be transferred to a medical
center tomorrow morning.

259
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,190
Psychoanalysis?

260
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,500
He was a bit too serious and kind of odd,

261
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,760
but to think he was that unhinged...

262
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,720
Dr. Lexie, your relationship with him...

263
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,430
...was it really not more of an intimate one?

264
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,130
What? No way.

265
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,690
If I had to define it,
I'd say we were best friends.

266
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:06,180
He was the only one who could
converse with me on an equal level.

267
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,960
But we've lost touch.

268
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,680
I'm happy to hear he's doing fine.

269
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,610
I'm heading back now.

270
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,820
I need to help with
Marvin's investigation tomorrow.

271
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,870
Cyber-Inspector.

272
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:33,000
What was your purpose
in asking her that question?

273
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,060
Oh, well, it was a personal curiosity.

274
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,840
I see.

275
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,300
You knew it, didn't you?

276
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,450
That Furman was following us.

277
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,280
You used me as bait to catch him.

278
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,020
What are you saying?

279
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,250
Show me your call history.

280
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,490
Your phone didn't ring
that night at the pub.

281
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,610
You lied to get me to act alone.

282
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,750
All right. I admit it.

283
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,480
I used you as bait.

284
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,670
Please allow me to explain.

285
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:20,510
My Laws of Respect would never allow me
to put you in danger.

286
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:25,680
I planned to lure Furman out
only so you could arrest him.

287
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,640
But I got distracted at that moment.

288
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,150
Even so, it doesn't change the fact
that you used me as bait.

289
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,900
Yes, you are right.

290
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,610
I apologize. It will never happen—

291
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:46,260
I thought we could be equal partners.

292
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,790
But in the end, you're an Amicus.

293
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,120
You're programmed to mechanically look
for the most efficient course of action.

294
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,770
You'll do the same thing again next time.

295
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,840
Please listen to me. I—

296
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,650
Sorry. I want to sort out my feelings.

297
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,470
I'm sorry, but go visit Darya without me.
