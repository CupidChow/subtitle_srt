(October 17)

3
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,544
The wind is so strong that I can't hear what you say?

4
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:30,548
Your wife's friend Sun Mingwu
Keep calling you

5
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,176
Who? Sun Mingwu?

6
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,263
Damn

7
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,475
The effect of the medicine has worn off and I can't remember anything.

8
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:42,685
What is it?

9
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,688
(Sun Mingwu)

10
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:46,606
What?

11
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:48,900
What's wrong?

12
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,319
What's up? Tell me I'm busy.

13
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,154
Where are you? Let's meet

14
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,239
Why don't you come to my house?

15
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,156
Shall we meet?

16
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,535
-Why?
-Well, I have something to say.

17
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,786
And I also need to exchange currency

18
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,954
Don't you have a lot of dollars?

19
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:12,882
Hello, are you listening?

20
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:13,883
Currency exchange?

21
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,426
How much? 4 dollars?

22
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:18,638
What about dollars? Go away.

23
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,349
You bitch

24
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,228
What the hell did you just say?

25
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,479
Oh, yes.

26
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,440
You probably don't remember your dog look.

27
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,818
You crawled on the ground very well that day

28
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,446
I will give you the video as a gift
You must collect it

29
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,198
That day

30
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,200
Did you go there?

31
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,201
The Day Yoon So-hee Died

32
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,913
You saw her fall
But he just ran away without calling the police, right?

33
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,167
What is this idiot suddenly talking about?

34
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:48,960
Why should I call the police?

35
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,044
I went there to sniff glue

36
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:51,504
Okay, I'm busy!

37
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,423
I'm so busy now.

38
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,759
Wow, so shameless

39
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,261
You bitch are the perpetrator

40
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,517

42
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,494
Oh, All-China Federation of Trade Unions

43
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,079
How are you?

44
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,749
How does it feel to be bitten by your own dog?

45
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,959
Where are you now you bastard?

46
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,086
Where else can I be? I am by your side

47
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,255
Well, it seems you are taking drugs.

48
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,673
What is this thing you sent me?

49
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,217
You know the answer, so why are you asking?

50
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,593
This is the account book of your embezzlement of public funds.

51
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:42,263
You want to open a golf course in the Philippines
All the misappropriated public funds are listed above

52
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,224
Let me make it short.

53
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,851
I'll keep my mouth shut
In exchange you give me cryptocurrency

54
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,270
One Bitcoin per page

55
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,065
I've been hurt enough by the bear market
What the hell did you say?

56
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,650
Do you want to die?

57
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,778
Oh my god, I was about to say the same thing.

58
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,155
Okay, the day Yoon So Hee died

59
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,200
You said you were with Yeonjin
Provide her with an alibi

60
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,536
What are you talking about you idiot?

61
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,456
You kid
I sent you my wallet address.

62
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,291
Can you please transfer the money within 48 hours?

63
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,085
It's really cool

64
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,920
You are such an easy person to deal with.

65
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,755
Hello

66
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,257
Damn it!

67
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,104
- Hello?
- Hello? I'm your husband.

68
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,772
Get lost

69
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,400
As long as you promise me, I can sleep with you anytime.

70
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,569
So let's leave Korea together

71
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,446
Wow, so beautiful

72
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,324
You are so fucking beautiful

73
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,285
So I'm going to save you.

74
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,496
The Day Yoon So-hee Died
Why did you go to her cram school to find her?

75
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,332
If you stay in Korea you will definitely get into trouble

76
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,460
So let's leave together Choi Hui-jung
To a country that belongs to both of us

77
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,337
Go to Russia, the Land of White Nights

78
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,255
Those high heels

79
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,717
Why are you going to Russia?

80
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,846
Oh, do you really want to be a dog?
Are we going to go sledding there?

81
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,139
Hey! Damn it!

82
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,101
I said I'd buy you a first class ticket, you bitch!

83
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,687
You are the only one
Someone who knows my tablet password

84
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,107
I like you! I always have!

85
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,403
Nonsense

86
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,449
Jinglan, don't you have fur here?

87
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,326
I called them all.

88
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:30,079
Those people who rely on them have no fear

89
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:30,997
Where is Yeonjin?

90
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,373
Did you date her?

91
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,708
Oh, that

92
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,710
You have priority over her.

93
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,671
So I want to call her after I finish talking to you.

94
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,423
No

95
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:45,053
Am I also in your calling list?

96
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,473
Wow, Wen Dongen, you are so smart.

97
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,392
I haven't told them about you yet, Dongen

98
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,728
You know what kind of people they are.

99
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,772
They will hunt you down immediately.

100
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,315
Let me make it short.

101
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,985
If you want to live longer, give me the brand name, Dong En

102
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,838
(Eden Apartments)

103
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,727
How come I met my husband here?

104
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,857
I knew it was a couple.

105
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,277
We came here in a car.

106
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:44,946
Right?

107
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,622
I want to sign in here

108
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,749
So my friends will know I was here

109
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,836
But I can't find any other way

110
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,756
You haven't answered my question yet

111
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:04,966
How come you are here?

112
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,511
Has Wen Dongen also approached you?

113
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,473
Even you shouldn't come here!

114
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,391
How?

115
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,185
After spending some time with me

116
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,646
Are you curious about women with brains again?

117
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,274
No, I'm curious about you.

118
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,030
Obviously the protagonist here is Park Yeon-jin

119
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,616
It's you

120
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,718
I'll ask you once

121
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,096
If you don't answer I'll ask someone else

122
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,682
Have you ever

123
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,060
Have you ever bullied someone cruelly?

124
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,605
Are there any violent words or behaviors?

125
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,608
Have you ever hurt someone else?

126
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,153
You have to open

127
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,780
The Box

128
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,703
Did Teacher Wen do something wrong?

129
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,538
Does it matter?

130
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:20,583
What?

131
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,877
It was her idea that I bullied her.

132
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,547
We just have a bad relationship

133
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,927
I'm leaving first

134
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,429
You can go home after you finish reading it slowly.

135
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,527
I am the one who disappoints you here.

136
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,819
Not you

(Late Yin Suxi)

139
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,542
What are you thinking about?

140
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,212
Without my consent
Never show the morgue to others

141
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,505
I've told you so many times

142
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:34,258
I know but

143
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,593
He is the son of the dean.

144
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,387
You go

145
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,895
Are you Dr. Zhou Ruzheng?

146
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,147
Yes, I asked him to do that.

147
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,815
Do you have time now?

148
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,276
(Mortuary)

149
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,612
Are you saying that Yoon So Hee's body is in the freezer?

150
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,615
Yes

151
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,701
It is written that it is in the morgue

152
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,119
But the body is in the freezer.

153
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,830
This is an unprecedented situation

154
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,123
So keep it secret

155
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,500
Sorry

156
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,877
Why do you want to confirm this?

157
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,754
For personal reasons

158
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,508
But why does our hospital do this?

159
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,803
Still keeping it secret
What is the purpose of this?

160
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,262
Purpose?

161
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:21,889
I'm not sure

162
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,142
This was instructed by the deceased dean.

163
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,190

00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,910
I don't know how happy I am to see the lights on inside

167
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,869
Have you been waiting for a long time?

168
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,662
I told you to text me when you get there.

169
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,580
I just arrived

170
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,415
It seems you are very busy today

171
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:12,833
Oh no

172
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,211
I just went to Seoul to do some business.

173
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,464
The towel I left for you is actually a blue towel

174
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,674
Only pink towels are suitable for me

175
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,346
Oh my god, you didn't confirm it right there and then?

176
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:26,806
Really?

177
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:28,933
Really?

178
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,728
By the way, the guest rooms have not been renovated yet.

179
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:33,938
You sleep in my bed tonight

180
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,022
Let's go look at the bed tomorrow.

181
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:36,941
That's my room.

182
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,443
I ordered something but it wasn't a bed

183
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,571
If it is delivered when I am not here
Just leave it alone.

184
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,614
I can assemble it myself

185
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,574
What is it?

186
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:50,955
The police contacted me

187
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,915
What if I am asked to accept an insider investigation?

188
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,917
Please, this is just an investigation by an insider.

189
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,919
What? Did you kill Mingwu?

190
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,088
Do you think so too?

191
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:00,923
Damn

192
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,299
Did I do this?

193
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,468
Oh my god, what new nonsense are you talking about?

194
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,808
I don't remember when I last saw him.

195
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,311
I don't remember whether I let him leave peacefully.

196
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,858
Which do you think is better? Killing people or taking drugs?

197
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,777
Murder can be said to be accidental murder

198
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,863
But occasional drug use

199
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,155
Does this sound a bit strange?

200
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,366
Sarah is dead

201
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,784
You are super annoying now

202
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,827
Did they contact you?

203
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,579
When will you be interviewed next week?

204
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,496
Today

205
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,540
They seem to have arrived

206
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,125
Come in

207
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:37,793
Today?

208
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,962
What did they say? Put it on speakerphone

209
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,005
No, record it first.

210
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:42,798
I feel a little nauseous.

211
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,092
Please stop messing around

212
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,387
Please take a seat

213
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,349
Sorry, I'm a bit busy.

214
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,894
No time to go to the police station

215
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,979
It's nice to have the chance to see this kind of place.

216
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:58,689
I am Chief Inspector Choi Dong-gyu

217
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,024
I was the one who called you before.

218
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:01,650
Oh

219
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,738
But the adults are missing
Do you usually conduct surveys like this?

220
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,365
This missing person case has turned into a criminal case.

221
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,492
Because we found
Sun Mingwu may be involved in drug crimes

222
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,246
When was the last time you saw him?

223
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,040
I'm not sure

224
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,791
He hasn't been to work for about three weeks.

225
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,211
Why didn't you go to see him when he didn't come to work?

226
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,631
Because this is just right

227
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,550
I was just about to fire him.
So it's just right that he doesn't come to work

228
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,052
He's terrible at what he does.

229
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,639
You know you can't just lay off employees these days.

230
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,140
Oh a little bit

231
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,894
Before and after his disappearance
Is it possible to meet someone else?

232
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,312
Do you have any impression?

233
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,606
Oh, right.

234
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,857
Before he disappeared

235
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,944
Someone urgently looked for him.

236
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:46,862
Who is that person?

237
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,240
President of Zaiping Construction Company

238
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,284
Ha Do-young

239
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,621
He also gave me his business card

240
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,164
His eyes are a little

241
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,541
Erratic

242
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:02,795
Why do you say that?

243
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,757
The phenomenon that there seems to be another sun next to the sun

244
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,676
sun dog

245
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,845
Sundogs are tiny ice crystals floating in the air.

246
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:15,099
A phenomenon that occurs when sunlight is refracted

247
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,476
According to the traditional Korean name

248
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,769
The sun dog phenomenon is also called sun group

249
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,313
A sun dog is sometimes seen as two suns.
Sometimes it is seen as an illusion

250
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,065
This depends on the subjective judgment of the observer.

251
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:27,987
I hope you can enjoy the observation today.
This rare weather phenomenon

252
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,196
My name is Park Yeon-jin

253
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,831
Jeon Jae-jun shared
Sun Mingwu's thoughts after the investigation

254
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,420
What are you doing? What's wrong?

255
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,187
Just ask me for the password.

256
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,898
Yeonjin's expensive door locks

257
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,567
Yeah, I should ask you.

258
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,528
More money spent on lock picking

259
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,530
Should I tear your mouth apart?

260
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,533
Or should it be broken?
Where's your hand that gives people money to pick locks?

261
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:15,993
What?

262
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,328
Let's sit down

263
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,122
I want hot coffee

264
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,324
It's interesting to visit your home.

265
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,658
I see you live very seriously

266
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,870
Working in a factory and taking academic certification and staffing exams

267
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,957
But you still live in a monthly rented house, Yewen Dongen

268
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,753
It's not easy to get to me, right?

269
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,296
It seems you are investigating me secretly.

270
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:12,841
Smelly Bitch

271
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,802
Are you doing a Mingzhong survey?

272
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,805
Because I have no other way

273
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,058
At first I thought
Revenge will be like Taken

274
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,393
But after the real action started

275
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,855
I have to follow you and make money

276
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,524
I have to change schools, really.

277
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,359
I'm so busy

278
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,777
Don't come

279
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,697
If you really want revenge or something

280
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,991
I guess you went to the police station a long time ago

281
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,745
The problem is you can't find out anything.
So you can only talk, right?

282
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,248
Come any way you want

283
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,208
Try to take revenge with your mouth.

284
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,377
It seems you're not listening to me at all

285
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:50,963
I told you I'm busy

286
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,216
I posted this online

287
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,552
Click-through rate is average

288
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,095
Is it because the sentence is missing a subject?

289
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,398
You send it

290
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,525
Write the subject and post it online

291
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,444
There are thousands of ways I can get out of this.

292
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:15,946
Is that so?

293
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:17,823
Then

294
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,033
Can you get away with this, too?

295
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,288
(Case report acceptance form)

296
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:37,551
(Medical record)

297
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,678
(Withdrawal Application Form Wen Dongen)

298
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,978
Be careful, I really kill you

299
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,229
Wake up!

300
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,149
I should kill you if I kill you

301
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,734
You dead woman

302
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,404
On my way here today

303
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,157
Looking back more than hundreds of times

304
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,450
Finally I came

305
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,370
I came here today

306
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,248
Because I want to give you one last chance

307
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,042
I'll give you a chance

308
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,378
Because someone showed etiquette at the entrance

309
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,757
What are you talking about?

310
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,759
I mean you should go to the police.

311
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,762
Take these and turn yourself in.

312
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,180
Confess your evil deeds

313
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:27,434
Including you to cover up your evil deeds
And do something even more cruel

314
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:30,646
What to do?

315
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,105
If you want to be punished by me

316
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,400
The consequences will be more serious Park Yeon-jin

317
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,363
Because I'll include my 18 years of hell in this

318
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,907
So you still surrender yourself.

319
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,702
Please beg for mercy from me and other victims.

320
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,620
Then

321
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,249
My revenge will end here

322
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:52,668
Wow

323
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,628
So kind

324
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,923
Do you think I'm confused?

325
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,383
So what does that mean?

326
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,886
I'll be on the news when I go to the police station

327
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,888
Then I'm dead.

328
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,683
Are you trying to be clever, crazy woman?

329
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,436
And I think you misunderstood

330
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,564
I didn't do anything wrong, Dongen

331
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,485
You didn't do anything wrong?

332
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,486
Not at all

333
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,448
Is your life hell because of me?

334
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,702
Stop talking nonsense

335
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:30,622
From the moment you were born
Your life is already hell

336
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,042
You should thank me

337
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,335
Thanks to me, you are still a teacher.

338
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,672
I'll give you motivation
Is it wrong to grit your teeth and change your life?

339
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,341
Begging for mercy?

340
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,344
Who forgives whom?

341
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,513
Why do poor people feel

342
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,140
In life, we can only encourage good and punish evil.

343
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,475
Do you believe that good will be rewarded and evil will be punished?

344
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,606
I can kill you or cook you.

345
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,736
Anyway, I will find a new hair straightener to deal with you

346
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,448
Get out of here

347
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:09,703
To some extent

348
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:10,620
I'm grateful for you.

349
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,041
You completely helped me get rid of the guilt in my heart

350
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,378
Actually, it feels good to see your expression like this

351
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,924
I am happy to see your struggling expression

352
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,511
Also

353
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,432
You just lost
The last chance your husband gave you

354
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,421
Actually, I have an illegitimate child.

355
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,091
Have you ever
Have your precious things been taken away by others?

356
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,060
Missing?

357
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,354
Sun Mingwu is missing?

358
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,271
Yes

359
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,065
About his disappearance

360
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:23,068
Jongno Police Station wants you to accept the insider investigation

361
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,654
And actually that day

362
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,280
The man named Sun Mingwu

363
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,992
Let me convey something else to you

364
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,217
Secretary

365
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:51,805
I know who your boss's wife sleeps with all the time

366
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,931
So please tell your boss

367
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,267
If he doesn't want me to be exposed online

368
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,060
Call me right away

369
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,883
OK

370
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:33,763
Oh my god, I'm scared to death

371
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:36,683
You are here

372
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,897
I really just wanted to open the box at first.

373
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:46,026
I also advised myself:
“Don’t assemble even if you see the instructions.

374
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,153
Even though I was a Boy Scout, I couldn't assemble it."

375
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,989
Have you ever thought about assembling it on the second floor?

376
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:54,993
No thought ahead
Will it be difficult to move after assembly?

377
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:57,662
Oh yeah

378
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,961
Yeah, you're right.

379
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,464
Then just put it here

380
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,965
It's too inconvenient for you to put it here

381
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,092
Let's move after we finish eating.

382
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,178
This is dessert

383
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,018
Baked sweet potatoes are my favorite

384
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,145
You said before that you love noodles the most

385
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,649
This is my second favorite!

386
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,323
Welcome home

387
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,407
This is sincere

388
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,936
Glittering Walls

389
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,189
Not yellowed by smoke

390
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,400
No mold

391
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,529
There is no trace of hatred

392
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,243
Such a strange wall

393
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,512
(Noon nap)

394
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,290
Your walls are always shining

395
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,334
Is it always strong and solid?

396
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,210
Yeonjin

397
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,898
Is it cold? Come sit by the fire.

398
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,443
Cover this

399
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,946
Why do we have to eat here when it's so cold?

400
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:40,075
I bought a house with a yard for this reason

401
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,117
Isn't it nice to be romantic?

402
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,036
When I see this kind of house, I can only think

403
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,080
Heating is definitely expensive

404
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,334
All the lights are on like this
The electricity bill will be scary.

405
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,462
I will pay for living expenses

406
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,172
But I can't share it with you

407
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,299
To split it evenly I have to turn off all the lights

408
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,509
Turn down the heating too.

409
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,135
Really

410
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:00,929
Okay

411
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:03,765
Just today, okay?

412
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,354
Come dip this

413
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,945
When did you learn this?

414
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,197
This

415
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,492
Learned this morning

416
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,748
I searched for "romantic dinner"

417
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,378
Thank you

418
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,632
If mood is so important to you

419
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,009
Then do it

420
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,178
Really?

421
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:44,556
Do you want to play music?

422
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,515
Don't

423
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,850
How about I just sing for you?

424
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,352
Ah microphone test

425
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,729
Can I take back what I just said?

426
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,064
Oh no!

427
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,568
One, Two, Three

428
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,155
Ouch, do I have a cold?

429
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,657
I seem to have a fever

430
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,617
Let's go in

431
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:06,911
Let me see

432
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,888
In the opinion of professional doctors

433
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:26,806
You are pretending to be sick

434
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,519
You wouldn't confirm it on the spot, would you?

435
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:35,774
I'll let you go.

436
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,027
You really don't know how beautiful my voice is.

437
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,367
Thank you for taking me in

438
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,829
You must feel very surprised and ridiculous, right?

439
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,289
I think it should be

440
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,249
Because it is an imperial decree.

441
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,926
Drugs?

442
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,470
Has Sun Mingwu's disappearance case turned into a drug case?

443
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,554
Damn it!

444
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,391
I knew it would be this abominable

445
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,435
Damn

446
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,520
How are you going to take responsibility?

447
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,105
It's all because you called the police, you bitch!

448
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,440
My hair!

449
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,194
You shouldn't have taken drugs in the first place! Why are you going crazy on me?

450
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,362
-Fuck you
- Hello

451
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,614
I know you are in pain now.

452
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,324
But you are wrong to take drugs

453
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,701
Could you please remember this?

454
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:29,702
Damn

455
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,999
We can't waste time like this

456
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,461
Wen Dongen, that bitch, is so cruel

457
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,422
(Withdrawal Application Form)

458
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,423
(Case report acceptance form)

459
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,009
What's wrong?

460
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,594
Can't you see?

461
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,597
Wen Dongen collected evidence that we bullied her

462
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,099
So what?

463
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,520
School violence is a risk to you
But it has no effect on ordinary people like us

464
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,441
What is more important to me now is

465
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,405
There is something that I feel is very wrong. I want to ask you

466
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,323
Did Sun Mingwu ask you about Yoon So Hee?

467
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,578
Did he ask you too?

468
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,497
He asked you too? Oh my god.

469
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,292
He also asked me
Why did I go to Suxi's cram school that day?

470
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,168
So he called each of us and asked?

471
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,379
And then he disappeared?

472
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,631
Well, I almost told him

473
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,051
Yeonjin asked me to go that day

474
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,222
What do you mean, Whiting?

475
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,641
I was with Jae-joon that day

476
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,686
We were all interrogated for no reason.

477
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,563
We all know this, don't we?

478
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,608
Only at this time is it "us"

479
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:47,363
In this current situation
It's not the prosecution that's in your favor

480
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,574
It is the legal mother's divorce

481
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,745
Where were we that day?

482
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,581
Are we together?

483
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,877
In the video room

484
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,588
We watched a lot of porn movies

485
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,340
Oh

486
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,551
We were very lustful back then.

487
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,387
Who would believe that?

488
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,348
People just don't mention it.

489
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,141
Didn't you do that to Yoon So Hee?

490
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,059
Sarah

491
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,354
Don't speak carelessly

492
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:21,606
Watch your mouth

493
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:23,483
So what?

494
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,110
What did Mingwu say to you?

495
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,280
What did he ask you about Yoon So Hee?

496
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,973
Are you all crazy?

497
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,729
Go to hell

498
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:25,837
Uncle is me

499
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,756
My previous brand...

500
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,557
(To the person in charge of the Yoon So-hee case)

501
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,810
(Complaint Box)

502
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,942
Did you know
Is it difficult to join the club in the West District?

503
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,820
It took me a lot of effort to get this.

504
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,408
What is the final conclusion?

505
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,286
The case was closed as suicide, so don't worry.

506
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,457
If you hadn't studied so well at that time

507
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,751
I think I'll see you on social news often.

508
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,629
(Park Yeon-jin)

509
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,381
This has to be burned

510
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,133
Bad luck

511
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,136
I was too young then

512
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,473
I thought if new evidence came out

513
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:22,310
They will reopen the investigation.
But nothing happened.

514
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,439
That name tag wasn't even on the evidence list.

515
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,900
That means the brand name in your hand is fake.

516
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,944
Then why did you still talk to Sun Mingwu about the nomination card?

517
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,822
Because Sun Mingwu didn't know it was fake

518
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,785
And I needed one
Something that can lure Sun Mingwu to move

519
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,371
Where do you want him to go?

520
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,416
Go to Park Yeon-jin

521
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,588
So you keep repeating the same thing.

522
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:54,550
You mean
Weather anchor Park Yeon-jin linked to Son Myeong-oh disappearance

523
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,679
But there is no definite evidence, right?

524
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,057
Do I have to find the evidence too?

525
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,184
I've given you the information.

526
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,895
99% of this intelligence is false accusations

527
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,815
False accusations are also serious crimes

528
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:14,237
I want to know about Sun Mingwu's drug-related situation

529
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,072
Do you know anything about this?

530
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,742
Let me think about it.

531
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,912
So you know or you don't?

532
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,581
I need to think about it

533
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,458
I know if it is a false accusation.

534
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,795
I can't commit a serious crime, can I?

535
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,468
What happened to famous brands?

536
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,054
18 years ago, someone anonymously sent it to the police station

537
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,599
This shows that there were witnesses at the time

538
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,477
Didn't you investigate this?

539
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,150
Are you blaming me for not investigating the case?

540
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,735
You mean why didn't I make a big deal out of it?

541
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,280
Do you want me to live my whole life in this state of anxiety?

542
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,991
What should I do if a witness suddenly appears?

543
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,784
It's been so long.

544
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,079
Like you just said, it was sent anonymously.

545
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,498
If he wanted to show up, he would have shown up then.

546
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,208
What if there is other evidence?

547
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,919
What if that witness suddenly goes crazy?

548
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:15,006
What should I do if I suddenly want to do something brave?

549
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,013
It's been 18 years, Yeonjin

550
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,434
Your mother has ruined the brand
All that's left is the corpse.

551
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:29,478
But the bodies have already rotted in the morgue.

552
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,064
Even if we restart the investigation now

553
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,733
Cases concluded as suicide

554
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,361
No matter what, it is impossible to overturn the conclusion

555
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,530
What are you worried about?

556
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:45,161
Is that right? Is that right?

557
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,581
I came here just to hear you say this

558
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:51,959
Oh, right.

559
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,753
Where is the hotel you acquired?

560
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,589
Is it that one? Or that one?

561
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,050
Oh yeah

562
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,511
I haven't thanked you for the vehicle registration certificate yet.

563
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,122
Don't

564
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,416
Why do you need to get beaten?

565
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,377
There is no benefit for us to go there

566
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,837
He went home with four bottles of soju

567
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,257
It takes a long time to wait for him to fall asleep

568
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,159
My baby girl Sunya

569
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,745
Growing up in a poorly lit semi-basement room

570
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:13,124
Yet it is still so bright and beautiful

571
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,918
Remember what I hate most?

572
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,170
Blowing Tears

573
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,047
It's tearjerking

574
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,050
Yes, that's it.

575
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,306
Sorry

576
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,518
Mom, I'm so sorry for you.

577
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,729
What are you sorry for?

578
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,024
Don't cry, mom

579
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,986
It's not your fault

580
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,905
You try your best every day

581
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:48,826
Shan Ya

582
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:52,580
I ask you

583
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:54,832
If you

584
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,918
To a place far away from home

585
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,046
Will you be happy?

586
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:02,173
Study abroad?

587
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,927
The United States is not that far away. We can't walk there.

588
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,722
Can you come to me soon, too?

589
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:12,600
Yeah, of course.

590
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,559
No problem

591
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,147
You get there first
Teacher Wen and I will be there soon.

592
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:23,069
You are going to join the cheerleading team at school

593
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,613
Dating the Captain of the American Football Team

594
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:27,573
How are you?

595
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,742
What movie did you watch?

596
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:45,007
My daughter's name
The word "Shan" (goodness) and the word "Ya" (elegance)

597
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,259
I got it for her.

598
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,972
But her life was bitter.
Maybe it's because I just named her randomly.

599
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,393
I also thought:
"If I had known this, I would have spent money to name her."

600
00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:00,773
Then our Shan Ya will have a new English name, right?

601
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,067
That's good

602
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,861
That's it, ma'am.

603
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:09,281
‎(Be careful of infection)

604
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:15,871
Oh my god, the surgery took 4 hours?

605
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,581
Mom, your strength hasn't rusted yet

606
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,418
‎ is a traffic accident patient who needs surgery to stop bleeding

607
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,170
Why are you here?

608
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,297
It's suspicious that you didn't call me first

609
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,215
No money?

610
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,967
How could this really happen?

611
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,135
I'm here to do some work

612
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,137
You are an outsider
What to do in my hospital?

613
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,680
Come to see you

614
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,891
-I miss you, mom
-Ouch!

615
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:38,394
- Be careful with the blood!
-So what?

616
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,479
I knew you had no money to spend.

617
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:47,361
Mom if

618
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:51,449
I will use the scalpel as an instrument of execution

619
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:53,659
Would you object?

620
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,415
What does it mean?

621
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,627
If I had made a different choice than my dad
Would you object?

622
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:10,468
The person I like has experienced something very cruel

623
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,596
I want to help her get revenge

624
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:18,893
Because I'm bored

625
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:21,353
So he went to hell? Your son

626
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:24,857
That beast

627
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:27,985
Not just rapists

628
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,696
He also beat and even killed people.

629
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,033
But your father still tried his best to save him

630
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,117
Because he is a patient

631
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,330
Your dad

632
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:44,835
Good heart

633
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,254
Kind and humane

634
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:49,590
But

635
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:55,429
I discovered blind kindness and ethical principles
It's just a flashy glory

636
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:02,478
I always thought you were like your dad.
That's not the case.

637
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,313
You inherited this from me.

638
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,360
Do you want to help her?

639
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:14,365
Then don't get discovered.

640
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,785
If that's your paradise

641
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,913
Then I won't object

642
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,087
I won't be discovered

643
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,714
This is for you

644
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,134
But did Yeon-jin really pick the lock?

645
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,636
Oh my god

646
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,680
Didn't you lose anything?

647
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,099
She doesn't even look at my stuff, there's nothing to steal

648
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,185
The only thing I'm worried about is this
That's why I ask you

649
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:44,979
But what is this?

650
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,815
It is the investigation record of the Suxi case.

651
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,943
I told Sun Mingwu everything
It is also because of this reason

652
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,239
But how did you get this file?

653
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,034
(Mortuary)

654
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,338
(Winter 2011)

655
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,760
(Do you know Suxi?)

656
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,680
‎(Do you know my daughter Yin Suxi?)

657
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,806
‎(Dead: Yin Suxi)

658
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:23,309
‎(Please take a look at this, please)

659
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:26,353
‎(They don't listen to what I say)

660
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,981
‎(Do you know Park Yeon-jin?)

661
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,190
‎(Do you know Sun Mingwu?)

662
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,942
‎(They killed my daughter)

663
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,694
‎(There is no one around me who can help me)

664
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,237
‎(Do you know Jeon Jae-joon?)

665
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:37,573
‎(What about Lee Sara and Choi Hui-jung?)

666
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:43,078
‎(Miss, please take a look at this)

667
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:48,167
This is the autopsy report of Yoon So Hee that you requested.

668
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,503
The autopsy was performed in our hospital.

669
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:53,380
So Yoon So Hee

670
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,175
Pregnant

671
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,427
Yin Suxi was pregnant at that time?

672
00:43:59,053 --> 00:43:59,887
Yes

673
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:04,266
So I asked her to hand over the investigation records to me.

674
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:08,771
I told her: "I will take Suxi home

675
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,859
And I will avenge her."

676
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:19,740
Thanks to her I am not dead yet

677
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:22,910
There were many times when I wanted to die.

678
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:28,123
You may not believe it

679
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,795
But I feel that Suxi has been coaxing me to sleep

680
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,008
I feel better after I wake up.

681
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,594
Oh my god

682
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,517
Poor child

683
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,355
What should we do?

684
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:19,508
If you want to live longer, give me the brand name, Dong En

685
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:23,387
It seems we are no longer in the same boat

686
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,556
The ship went off track, what else can I do?

687
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,559
So you have to think about Dong En.

688
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,478
If I decide to join them

689
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,106
Damn, even if it's you

690
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,233
Can you fight four people alone?

691
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:39,027
You know they're murderers.

692
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,072
They killed Yoon So Hee together

693
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:44,783
I am the only innocent one

694
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,243
How is that possible?

695
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,245
Look at what you said.

696
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,330
What is my crime?

697
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,499
According to your crime, you deserve to be dismembered.

698
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,377
I survived the bullying by the five of you.

699
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,172
Good luck

700
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:01,800
Hey you bitch

701
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:03,469
Damn you for saying bad things

702
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,681
This plan is ruined.

703
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:09,933
Wait, that's not right.

704
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,186
I just need to get Yeon-jin hooked.

705
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:23,781
Me

706
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,241
I've been thinking about you all day today

707
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:28,285
Let's meet

708
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,371
I have something very important to tell you.

709
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:33,624
If you don't see me today

710
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,293
How about I go to your radio station to find you tomorrow?

711
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:40,631
I'm curious

712
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,091
Why do you want to see me?

713
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,305
Not now. I have a party.

714
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:52,351
How about around 11 o'clock?

715
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:14,498
(Yongshan Funeral Home)

716
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,817
(Park Yeon-jin)

717
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:55,349
What can I do for you?

718
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:57,559
Get off the bus

719
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,938
You seem to have the wrong person.

720
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,357
I was right.

721
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:12,866
Ms. Jiang Xiannan

722
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,953
Stop acting and get out of the car
