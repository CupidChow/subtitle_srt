You damn girl

3
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,361
If you want to drop out of school, just do it!

4
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,364
Are you not wrong? Not at all?

5
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,534
Things have come to this point
It means you have problems too, damn it!

6
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,286
Come to me right now and rewrite the reason for dropping out!

7
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,325
(Park Yeon-jin)

00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,535
Yeonjin

00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:00,912
I said

00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,956
The roof of the abandoned building

11
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,375
Do you remember?

12
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,629
That's when you lost your name tag

13
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,297
Do you remember? Yeonjin

14
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,465
What the fuck are you doing?

15
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,592
Go away

16
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,802
I told you to go away!

17
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,538
However

18
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:45,999
What are you doing here?

19
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,836
The dead can't be here

20
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,840
No wonder I smelled foul odor

21
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,759
You're covered in burns

22
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,845
The head is still broken like that

23
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,598
The dead can't be here

24
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,475
What do you want to do by mixing among the living?

25
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,448
Mom!

26
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,408
Mom!

27
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,455
Here

28

This woman here

30
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,046
This... this woman

31
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,509
Mom

Is this it?

36
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,931
Your plan with Wen Dongen

37
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,350
Just to involve my mother

38
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,768
Let her kill your husband?

39
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,354
You're a murderer, you bitch

40
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,109
No wonder
You didn't react when I told you I'd help you kill him

41
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,528
I want you to reconcile with my mother immediately

42
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,365
Do you think I can't find your daughter?

43
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,410
First

44
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,496
I have something to return to your wife.

45
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,216
You bitch!

46
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,635
Why do you threaten my child at every turn?

47
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,512
Aren't you a mother too?

48
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:47,847
I am here

49
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,641
There are many photos of you

50
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,393
So

51
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:53,853
Don't mess with me

52
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,023
If you come to me again

53
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,942
No matter what it is, I will pay you back double

54
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,320
Just like today

55
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,449
You bitch

56
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:17,919
Husband

57
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,636
Wow thank you very much

58
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,596
If you need anything else

59
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,014
Please call me anytime

60
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,808
Are you working for Deputy Superintendent Shin?

61
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,935
He will be going abroad soon

62
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,146
He sold the hotel owned by his sister.

63
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,234
Okay, follow me.

64
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,195
How come you are here?

65
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,411
Who are they?

66
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,498
You have two choices

67
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,502
This is the address of the victim's family.

68
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,463
Although you have forgotten them

69
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,674
Not forgotten yet

70
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,219
You either apologize or take responsibility for your crime

71
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,224
Or end our relationship now.

72
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,561
You have to choose carefully

73
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,314
I will too

74
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,194
Why should I go looking for them?

75
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,030
I didn't kill her

76
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,534
She was just crazy and accidentally stepped on air.

77
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,452
So you are there

78
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,165

“We”?

81
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,264
From the moment you met Wen Dongen

82
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,185
There is no "we" anymore

83
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,232
Oh, I see.

84
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,405
Then take care

85
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,241
My choice is this

86
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,915

He would ejaculate very quickly for no apparent reason when he had sex with me

Doesn't this mean that he loves me too?

That's premature ejaculation, go away, idiot

Maybe we can calm down and talk about the amount.

161
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,620
I won't reconcile

162
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,871
Please do not contact me

163
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,290

00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,876
Wait, Ms.

165
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,633
What to do? She seems very determined

166
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,759
You ask me how I know?

167
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,220

168
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:25,846

00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,129
Yes

191
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,465
You seem to remember it, so I'll get to the point.

192
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,595
I don't care if you killed Lee Seok-jae

193
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,305
What I care about is

194
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,141
Park Yeon-jin killed So-hee

195
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,935
And what Shin Young-joon helped her deal with afterwards

196
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,229
What?

197
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,939
You have Yeonjin's brand name, right?

198
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,775
I know you left that with the wizard.

199
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:05,279
You just need to give me the evidence.

200
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,409
How do you say?

201
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,121
Are you willing to sell out Yeon-jin to save yourself?

202
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,710
This is my number

203
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,214
You either become a murderer.

204
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,091
Or hand over the brand

205
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,886
End this with manslaughter

206
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,097
This should be an easy decision for you.

207
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,016
But you can pretend to be upset

208
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,434
Pretend you need to think

209
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,772
Just like you have motherly love

210
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,984
Once you've made up your mind, call me.

211
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,459
"For the second week in a row, the weather station

212
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,127
Issued a nationwide cold wave warning

213
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:12,221
The temperature this morning continued to hover around -10 degrees Celsius.

214
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:17,393
It's minus 10 degrees outside but you're so hot, senior

215
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,105
What? Divorce?

216
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,440
Don't you have internet at home?

217
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,944
You just saw yesterday's news now?

218
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,072
It's not news, it's a video

219
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,908
Newly uploaded bullying video

220
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,168
Are you deaf like your mother?

221
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,047
I told you to take it off, don't talk back to me

222
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,133
I will definitely kill her

223
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,718
Yeonjin is angry

224
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,761
Damn it, put it away!

225
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:53,929
Sorry

226
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,597
She slipped away

227
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,063
Did I tell you?

228
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,232
I won't die alone

229
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,360
Have a nice day

230
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,945
You bitch

231
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,282
(Revealing Park Yeon-jin's bullying video)

232
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,992
In the previous explosive article

233
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,369
It also mentioned that someone was bullied to death by her, right?

234
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,496
Aren't all the above written facts?

235
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,456
Park Yeon-jin!

236
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,750
What's wrong with you?

237
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,918
How come you always get involved in scandals like this?

238
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,879
What is going on with school violence and murder?

239
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,297
Are they all facts?

240
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,135
Every day really

241
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,346
Too hard

242
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,653
Really Director

243
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,697
(Resignation letter Park Yeon-jin)

244
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,574
Bullying is a fact

245
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,911
But I didn't kill anyone

246
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,758
Your beautiful walls are gone.

247
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,553
You finally stand in the ruins Park Yeonjin

248
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,348
It will be desolate

249
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,183
Pitch black

250
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,354
Welcome, Yanzhen

251
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,818
Take this out.

252
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,361
Don't let Ye-ryul go online

253
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,278
Good Lady

254
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,240
My baby

255
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:41,870
Mom and Dad had a little quarrel

256
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,458
There are other things to deal with besides that mother

257
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,543
I've already seen them all

258
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,295
Did you bully your classmates?

259
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,381
Did you put anything hot on them?

260
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,009
Seung-ah said she was afraid of me

261
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,762
She asked me if I would bully her like you did

262
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,350
No, ...

263
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,644
Mom can go and tell Shengya's mom

264
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,313
You go out too.

265
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,649
I don’t want to be a weather anchor when I grow up

266
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,235
I'm not proud of you anymore

267
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,828
I admit
When I was still young, I used to commit school violence.

268
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:24,746
But

269
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,417
I didn't kill anyone

270
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,627
Actually, I am a victim

271
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:36,341
For several years I have been harassed by the family of the deceased

272
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,886
Because they lost their child

273
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,680
I have to endure everything

274
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,390
But I just

275
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,851
Unilateral claims against the family of the deceased

276
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,103
and malicious comments

277
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,939
Submitted a lawsuit

278
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,651
Me and the Dead

279
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,779
Once a friend

280
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,368
So I didn’t want to reveal this.

281
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,205
However

282
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,666
She was actually pregnant at the time.

283
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,709
Pregnant?

284
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,253
Is it true?

285
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,588
Can you prove it?

286
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,424
This is what the case investigation report says

287
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,051
You can go and confirm

288
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,886
She was pregnant at the time

289
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,388
Choose suicide

290
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:29,186
But at least I want to protect the reputation of the deceased

291
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,063
So I never said

292
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,445
I'm sorry I have to reveal the truth now

293
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,324
That's how it is

294
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,118
I have to go to another friend's funeral today.

295
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,252
You follow her and I'll take a look at the investigation report.

296
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,170
If what she said is true, she must be wronged

297
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,715
Are you sure? I know.

298
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,803
Park Yeon-jin just said at the press conference

299
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,012
She is going to Sun Mingwu's funeral

300
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,098
Go check where the funeral is held.

301
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,475
What about Guokesou? No news yet?

302
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,185
They said the results will be out the day after tomorrow, so I'll ask again.

303
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,610
Why is the atmosphere like this?

304
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,028
Did you have a fight?

305
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,239
How can someone like me argue with her?

306
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,366
I'm just a cheap toy

307
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,410
You have a big tongue

308
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,162
I don't understand half of what you're saying.

309
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,580
You say "fourteen" and see

310
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,707
"Fourteen"

311
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:41,008
After you uploaded Yeonjin's bullying video

312
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,593
She held a press conference to refute

313
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,095
So you're in a bad mood?

314
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,179
However

315
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,558
You will find that this moment is like heaven

316
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,101
What are you talking about?

317
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,899
(The dog sent a new video)

318
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,609
The dead sent me a message

319
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:00,986
It's Sun Mingwu

320
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,573
Why are you talking nonsense?

321
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,092
What is this?

322
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,261
Season 2?

323
324
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,557
Sarah, isn't this you?

324
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,440
That's not me

325
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,401
What is this? Who sent it?

326
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,695
It can't be a dead person, so who sent it?

327
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,698
And you said it wasn't you

328
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,368
Look at the eyes, it's definitely you

329
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,744
Your lifeless eyes

330
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,704
Why did you choose a word that is difficult to pronounce?

331
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,290
I told you that it wasn't me, why are you still happy?

332
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,042
Turn it off you bitch

333
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,251
LOL

334
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,213
You all laughed when I was being pranked

335
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,965
Why are you so serious when your own affairs are exposed?

336
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:04,883
Hello

337
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:06,760
This is you

338
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,428
Who is this guy?

339
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:09,763
Hey

340
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:11,848
Hey Sarah Lee

341
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,561
What the hell did you just say?

342
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,646
Oh, yes.

343
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,732
You probably don't remember your dog look.

344
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,151
You crawled on the ground very well that day

345
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,654
- Look here carefully
-It's Sun Mingwu

346
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,656
You slept with Sun Mingwu?

347
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,282
-Wow that bastard
- Stop filming

348
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,785
It turns out that it wasn't just your drugs that he embezzled

349
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,287
-That's not me!
- Look here damn

350
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,372
Who is it?

351
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,666
Who sent it?

352
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,085
You slept with him yourself.

353
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,420
Why did you throw my phone?

354
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,504
Damn

355
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,297
Sarah Lee

356
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,092
I have something to tell you

357
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,554
It can't be you, can it?

358
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,139
What are you talking about?

359
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,057
Come out for a moment

360
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,393
You uploaded my video

361
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:58,645
We need to talk

362
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:00,897
It's you

363
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:02,858
It's you

364
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,568
How?

365
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,653
You want to use me to cover up your video again?

366
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,282
Hey are you crazy?

367
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,741
Are you high?

368
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,202
Let go!

369
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,248
I usually act like I'm great.

370
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,876
Look at you two, each of you is revealing your friend's video

371
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,712
Another person tried to cover up the video
To disclose the pregnancy of a dead person

372
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,631
You guys are so noble.

373
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,716
What did you say she disclosed?

374
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,051
It's you

375
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,513
Where are you going, you bitch

376
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,058
What's wrong with me going to your church?

377
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,895
I will play that video in the church lobby

378
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,021
Stay tuned

379
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,939
Your fate is to be killed by the video

380
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,193
I said I'll pay for your clothes
You should have accepted it at that time

381
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,362
You are really...

382
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,996
Satan is the one who rejoices in the suffering of others

383
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,666
A woman like you who enjoys other people's pain

384
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,585
You have to stand trial

385
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,560
Get out of the way, police!

386
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,020
Can't take it out now

387
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,356
Let go of the damn thing!

388
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,274
Do you like my clothes?

389
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:27,943
Wear it as a shroud

390
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,236
Damn

391
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,366
(Sun Mingwu: male, 37 years old)

392
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,759
(Zhou Ruzheng, Director of Zhou Ruzheng Plastic Surgery Hospital)

393
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,183
I've been giving this to you for a while.

394
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,309
Why are you here now?

395
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,062
You're not here to get a diagnosis certificate, are you?

396
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,523
You weren't seriously injured.

397
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,149
Oh, right.

398
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,027
How is your friend?

399
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,237
Look, you know everything.

400
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,489
You and Wen Dongen are indeed in the same group

401
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:20,453
Huiting, you don't have to worry about her going to a big hospital in Seoul.

402
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,291
What is your relationship with Wen Dongen?

403
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:26,876
Go to bed?

404
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,838
Looks like you need to be careful

405
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,299
I'm used to my new car.

406
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,634
So today I might really kill you

407
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,803
As expected, he is a child of a wealthy family.

408
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,222
You really don't know etiquette

409
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,223
Anyway

410
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,809
You are the son of the director of Zhou Hospital, right?

411
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,103
I heard that Yoon So Hee is there

412
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,231
She's been there for a long time

413
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:50,567
So what?

414
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,527
Can you show me Suxi?

415
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:54,863
Is the body refrigerated?

416
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,615
So

417
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,325
Do you want an autopsy or something?

418
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,411
What do you think as a doctor?

419
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:02,954
Autopsy

420
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,626
Can the contents of the stomach also be checked?

421
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:12,881
So Yoon So Hee

422
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,507
I was pregnant at the time

423
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,844
I don't know much about forensic medicine

424
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:21,097
And it depends on Yoon So-hee
You are going with her family, not me.

425
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,516
If you want to do injection beauty or treatment

426
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,310
Just make an appointment when you go out

427
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:30,106
I have to leave town tomorrow
So today's appointments are very full

428
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,567
Wow you almost convinced me to make an appointment when I went out

429
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:34,861
I don't need

430
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,248
Dean Zhou

431
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:51,419
Mr. Quan left without paying

432
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,756
It doesn't matter
Before he left, he gave me exactly what I needed.

433
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,091
Go get busy

434
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,393
(When steroid eye drops are instilled
Have experienced symptoms of sudden increase in intraocular pressure)

435
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,560
(Glaucoma monitoring required)

436
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,948
We made a mistake. It's not Sun Mingwu.

437
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:22,992
It turns out to be Jeon Jae-joon

438
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,328
The bastard you mentioned deserved to die

439
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,876
I didn't notice

440
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,753
I didn't notice that

441
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,671
It really shouldn't be

442
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,509
It turns out that he doesn't just play basketball

443
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:50,645
What time is it now?

444
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:52,856
Didn't you ask me to come over quickly?

445
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:53,815
You said it was urgent

446
00:28:58,653 --> 00:28:59,696
Mom

447
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,448
She is a member of our club

448
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,492
She likes the dumplings sold in the club restaurant.

449
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,541
I was just about to call you

450
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,334
Have you read the news?

451
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,087
I had a little argument with Ye-ryul's dad

452
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:20,383
It's a bit impulsive to decide to divorce just because of this, right?

453
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,593
"Ye-ryul's dad"?

454
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,928
"Ye-ryul's dad"?

455
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,396
Oh my god, why did you pick up the putter?

456
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,065
This is the most painful thing.

457
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,150
Don't bother with it,

458
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:41,029
Who is it? Which bastard?

459
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,239
The Federation of Trade Unions told me

460
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,033
Art Rate

461
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,118
Not Doyoung's child

462
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,748
Are you crazy?

463
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,627
Oh my god, I forgot to tell you

464
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,466
That bastard is me

465
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,635
Ye-ryul is my child

466
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:08,723
What?

467
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:09,641
So

468
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,310
Let your son raise my daughter

469
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,604
That's a little weird, isn't it?

470
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,481
So I want to ask

471
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,400
Can you please take my daughter

472
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:21,861
Removed from your household registration?

473
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:25,031
You crazy

474
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,912
You bastards

475
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,748
I won't let you go

476
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,168
How dare you lie to my son?

477
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,475
Yoon So Hee?

478
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:53,393
Yes

479
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:56,563
I want to pay for the storage of the body from 2004 to now

480
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,981
Oh, I see.

481
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,276
How can I say it? You are a step late.

482
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,444
Someone paid the fee not long ago.

483
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:06,698
Who paid?

484
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:10,118
Ha Daoying, President of Zaiping Construction

485
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:15,415
Thank you

486
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,300
Maybe this is the moment he was waiting for.

487
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,886
Dean Zhou believed that this moment would come.

488
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,242
Are you going on a business trip?

489
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,704
Wait a minute

490
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,289
(Mom)

491
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,756
I will remit your severance pay and salary to you.

492
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,342
Thank you for your hard work during this period.

493
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,890
Three, Four, Five

494
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:15,934
1

495
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:18,937
Ha Ye-ryul

Art Rate

497
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:23,733
Oh my god he's not...

Art Rate

499
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:34,827
What is my princess doing?

500
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,999
Dad

501
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,508
Dad, I'm sorry.

502
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,224
No, you have nothing to be sorry about.

503
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,729
These things happening now

504
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,524
None of it is your fault

505
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,651
Do you understand?

506
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,611
Dad

507
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:26,796
I have something to ask of you

508
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,257
Please give this to Sung Hee

509
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,094
Give this to the school doctor.

510
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,888
Messages that need to be conveyed
I wrote it on the note in the bag

511
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,058
So this is

512
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,937
My last mission?

513
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,190
Yes

514
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,444
Thank you for this time

515
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:52,739
Now

516
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,575
You can live in the world you want.

517
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,119
There

518
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,705
You don't have to be my helper

519
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,790
You can be yourself

520
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,500
Be your cheerful self

521
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,727
Are there eggs in that bag?

522
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:32,695
Stop crying

523
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,948
I want to leave with a smile

524
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,333
When you were a kid

525
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,711
What kind of child is it?

526
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,422
I am sometimes curious

527
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:57,720
Such a beautiful person when smiling

528
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,017
Really?

529
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,022
What was I like as a child?

530
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,276
I don't remember

531
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:26,916
Wish you

532
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,044
Mrs. Everything Goes Wish

533
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:32,964
Good

534
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,136
Let's not meet again

535
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,266
Jinglan

536
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,475
Yeah

537
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:27,810
-Have you had any water?
-Yeah

538
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,604
It's so hot

539
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,189
Let's go there after school today.

540
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,232
- Let's order fried skewers too
-Okay

541
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:34,859
The karaoke room there is nice, right?

542
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,129
(No laundry)

543
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,267
You can't wash your clothes here

544
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:35,313
Are you a part-time worker?

545
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,441
Very diligent and good

546
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,453
She is the boss of the real estate agency across the street.

547
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,581
Her son died not long ago.
So she is not in a good mental state now.

548
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:55,833
Killed by a drunk driver

549
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,502
Let her wash it.

550
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:08,929
Welcome

551
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,474
She said you were her savior.

552
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:38,125
The scar on the neck needs further observation

553
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,543
As for the voice?

554
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,295
Let's observe again

555
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:43,881
What is the use of light observation?

556
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,800
So

557
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,551
Can she speak?

558
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,345
Her vocal cord muscles were severely damaged.

559
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,680
So the vocal cords cannot contract or relax.

560
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,225
It seems unlikely that we can talk at this moment.

561
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,060
But sometimes there is a possibility of recovery

562
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,812
(How many possibilities are there?)

563
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,980
How many possibilities are there?

564
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,857
After all, miracles do exist.

565
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,860
Ms. Cui, you can't use your voice like that.

566
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,492
Oh my god

567
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,577
If you have to rely on miracles, then...

568
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,581
Anyway, I'll pack your stuff and send it to you.

569
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,377
Our Huiting is always strong, so I feel relieved.

570
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,796
If you need anything special, just tell me.

571
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,214
Oh, sorry.

572
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:26,966
I forgot you can't talk

573
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,886
(You can't do this to me)

574
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,597
The doctor said you can't use your voice

575
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:35,808
You mean

576
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:36,809
I can't do this to you?

577
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,019
Why?

578
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:39,937
Ah

579
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:41,981
What about the recording?

580
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:45,818
I deleted that one.

581
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,196
You said the password is 696969

582
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,908
(You bastard)

583
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:55,286
I know I'm an asshole

584
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,581
You are really a doctor who told you not to talk.

585
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,625
Let me give you a menthol cigarette.

586
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,461
That throat clearing effect is super good

587
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:10,009
(I'm going to kill you! I'm going to kill you!)

588
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,936
Sarah Lee due to special damage
and attempted murder will be tried

589
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:25,733
Her father, Pastor Li Jicheng
Also arrested by the police on suspicion of tax evasion

590
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,361
Li Jicheng has embezzled over the past 20 years
Total donations and secret funds

591
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,780
It is expected to exceed tens of billions

592
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,074
I saw the news

593
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,035
It seems that the end is not far away

594
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,371
Congratulations on creating ruins!

595
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,081
Even though I was the one who set up the trap

596
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,750
But the ruins were created by themselves.

597
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,002
And you are the one who makes this 100% successful.

598
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,797
You made this plan perfect.

599
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,141
Turn around and don't look

600
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,311
You just need to look at the good-looking things. This is not good-looking.

601
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:06,815
No, I have to see

602
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,402
This is the executioner's sword dance you performed for me

603
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:13,906
I'm coming too

604
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:51,735
Senior

605
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,572
Under the fingernails of Sun Mingwu
The DNA test results are out

606
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,156
But it's weird

607
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,285
What's weird?

608
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,411
I said 18 years ago

609
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,746
In the case of Yoon So-hee
Lighter found at the crime scene

610
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,540
The DNA detected on it

611
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,792
The DNA detected from Sun Mingwu's fingernails is consistent

612
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:08,669
What is happening?

613
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:12,548
Go collect all the information related to the Yin Suxi case.
Bring all the DNA samples here

614
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,091
Good

615
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:17,219
My special thanks goes to Zhou Ruzheng

616
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,058
I will be home late today

617
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,143
I have to go out of town to go somewhere

618
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:26,478
Where to go?

619
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:29,732
To Dr. Zhou Ruzheng

620
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,318
A bit far

621
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,403
See you later tonight

622
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,033
Hello, Dr. Zhou

623
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,075
I am Jiang Yongtian

624
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,998
I can't understand the sadness of losing a family member.

625
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,752
But I want to write a few words with apology

626
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:53,005
Although our meeting was short

627
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,884
But I remember your father was a good man.

628
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:03,641
He puts murderers like me
Also treated me as a patient and treated me wholeheartedly

629
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,684
3724 Meeting

630
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:14,860
We meet again

631
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,823
I want to hear the answer I didn't hear last time

632
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:25,120
You said you'd show me your hell when we met again

633
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:28,916
During the trial

634
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,586
You didn't tell me the reason.

635
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:35,839
Tell me about it

636
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,725
Is this your hell?

637
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,439
It’s not enough

638
00:44:58,278 --> 00:44:59,530
Why you

639
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,409
Killed my father?

640
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,085
Everyone refused to operate on me.

641
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:17,005
My arm is broken and it hurts like hell

642
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,550
Blood is flowing

643
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,385
They said I was a murderer

644
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,345
So I don't even want to touch me

645
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:25,931
Then your father came in.

646
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:35,566
You guys come out first, everyone come out.

647
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,197
I'll do it

648
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:43,991
Give him an IV and do a CT scan

649
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,577
Please remove the handcuffs. I can't save you.

650
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,494
Dean

651
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,872
Please don't do it. Send him to another hospital.

652
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,915
What should they do? What should the doctors there do?

653
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,960
It is the court's job to question the guilt

654
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,503
We have to hand him over alive to the court

655
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:00,299
Someone give Ruzheng a call?

656
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:03,761
We agreed to have dinner together
He should be on his way

657
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,095
Let him go home directly

658
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,263
Tell him not to eat instant noodles

659
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,016
I don't know why he likes instant noodles so much.

660
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:20,319
I'm dying here
He is actually worried about you eating instant noodles

661
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,654
Isn't this insulting from my perspective?

662
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:24,531
Hmm?

663
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,785
After the operation begins

664
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,536
I woke up from the anesthesia.

665
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:31,747
I found that one hand could move

666
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:33,916
And the scalpel is right next to me

667
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,300
Do you know who I wanted to see?

668
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:47,638
Yes

669
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,849
The Dean's son who likes instant noodles

670
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,351
That's why I do that.

671
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,396
You will come when your father dies
So I used a scalpel to cut it

672
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,232
To make you

673
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,192
Running to see me so I snapped

674
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,825
I want to carry on my late father's legacy

675
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,660
Serve this society

676
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,287
My father used to say

677
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,957
Since the medical profession is our mission

678
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:18,418
We should take serving the society as our purpose

679
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:22,422
Whether it is "cultivating legal order"
Or "Reshaping Hope and Tomorrow"

680
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:25,092
I think it all starts with a healthy body.

681
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:31,932
I appreciate your philosophy, Dr. Zhou

682
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,518
But I can't hire the victims' families.

683
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:41,024
The bottom line
It was you who killed your father, not me.

684
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:36,705
Come in

685
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:37,623
Mom

686
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:39,791
Huh?

687
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,168
Wow who are you?

688
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,920
My mother has lost a lot of weight

689
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,714
I'm a vegetarian just to wear a bikini, but it's too bad

690
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:48,050
They say surfing suits are in fashion now

691
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:52,095
The chance to find you a new European dad is gone.

692
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,890
Where in Europe? New dad in Italy?

693
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,185
Did you cry?

694
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:01,146
Why am I crying? What's there to cry about?

695
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,065
I'm hungry, please treat me to a meal

696
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,943
I asked Zhong Xian which restaurants were good.

697
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,027
Don't move here.

698
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:09,071
Go get a haircut.

699
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,281
I made you so handsome

700
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,367
Why are you wasting your face like this?

701
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,160
I'm going to grow it longer and braid it

702
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:34,972
Mr. He is on annual leave

703
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:35,889
I know

704
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:37,933
Didn't you and I talk on the phone?

705
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:40,477
So I know

706
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,605
I know all

707
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:48,777
But I have no other place to go except here

708
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:05,043
You don't know?

709
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:06,962
Your lost name tag

710
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,465
I handed it over to the police station.

711
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:16,096
I didn't make good use of that brand at that time

712
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,682
But I'm going to make good use of it today.

713
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:22,978
(Park Yeon-jin)

714
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,733
This was given to me by Director Shin secretly from the police station.

715
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:29,693
I have kept it here.

716
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:31,319
Is that ok now?

717
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:32,988
No

718
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:34,781
Starting now

719
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:44,624
Mom

720
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:45,959
You

721
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:47,753
How come you are here?

722
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:50,672
Did you call her?

723
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,132
Yeonjin also needs to know

724
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:58,305
Your mother betrayed you to save herself

725
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:00,474
You said

726
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,643
Family members are the biggest perpetrators

727
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,228
You bitch

728
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,230
This is for you, Yeon-jin.

729
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,150
This belongs here

730
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:14,905
But you know what?

731
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:18,450
This brand name has no evidentiary value

732
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,661
Because this is not the crime scene.

733
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,580
But it is obtained after a period of time.

734
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:27,584
From the beginning

735
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,003
I don't need your mother's testimony

736
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:32,297
I'm just curious

737
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,384
How far will Park Yeon-jin be abandoned?

738
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:39,679
Now I know the answer

739
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,266
You and I both know it

740
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,157
Mom

741
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,329
What did you do?

742
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:13,547
How could you do this?

743
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:20,303
How could you do this to your daughter?

744
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:22,347
Otherwise, we'll both die?

745
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:25,809
Things got like this because
You can't even handle someone like her.

746
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:27,853
That's good.

747
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,438
Go and get along well with your daughter.

748
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:32,816
I have already failed

749
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:37,279
Mom

750
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:42,659
Mom

751
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:49,082
Mom

752
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,421
I know some people who have tried to save their own children.

753
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:58,383
And the mothers who choose hell for themselves

754
00:52:58,383 --> 00:52:59,801
Crazy Woman

755
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:02,262
How can you do this at someone else's funeral?

756
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:04,306
Damn

757
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:45,388
(Demian)

758
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:54,773
(Lai Mei'an)

759
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,157
So

760
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,744
Don't be at ease and think that this is the end

761
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:11,081
Don't think you've been punished enough.

762
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,335
After all, funerals are

763
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,754
Only Sun Mingwu

764
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,677
(Sung Hee)

765
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,136
Hmm Sung Hee

766
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:29,808
Sister, I fainted in Shenghandong.

767
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,064
Did she faint?

768
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:38,733
Oh my god

769
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,699
Kim Ji-nyeo's Guardian

770
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:47,742
Here we come

771
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:52,998
What is your relationship?

772
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:54,708
I am her acquaintance

773
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,042
She has no family

774
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:58,128
Sorry, please wait.

775
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:00,380
What is this?

776
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,008
The remarks column says
Dr. Zhou Ruzheng is her guardian

777
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,261
He should be having dinner with the dean now.

778
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:10,724
Hello, it's me

779
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,392
What does the note you wrote on the information sheet mean?

780
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,216
When did you come?

781
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,557
Guardian of Suxi's mother

782
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:55,352
It's you

783
00:55:58,271 --> 00:55:59,147
I asked them

784
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:00,940
They said that the note

785
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:05,236
It was written before we met on the train.

786
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:18,792
Did you know this all along?

787
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,337
Did you know

788
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:26,216
Did I approach you on purpose?
