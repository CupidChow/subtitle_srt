(Noon nap)

3
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,725
Mr. River?

4
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,187
Long time no see

5
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,607
Yeonjin has no fitting schedule today

6
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:49,692
I know

7
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,487
Can I try this?

8
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,156
Where is the fitting room?

9
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,316
The space inside is narrow

10
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,986
There's someone outside

11
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,320
You and I are hot

12
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,171
You

13
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,675
Park Yeon-jin is really devoted to everything she does.

Dark Glory

15
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,020
I heard through the grapevine that you get beaten all the time.

16
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,731
But your face isn't as bad as I thought.

17
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:15,069
Wen Dongen's home is filled with various photos

18
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,281
I recognize the people in the photo.

19
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,829
This is the only person I don't know.

20
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,041
Do you have anything to say?

21
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,418
You are

22
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,837
How to find me?

23
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:34,964
It's easy

24
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:38,843
(Eden Apartments)

25
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,520
(Shin Young-jun's two attachments)

26
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,980
(Vehicle registration certificate)

27
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,816
I hadn't considered this before.
But this time I checked

28
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,693
It was discovered that Wen Dongen had two cars under his name

29
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,154
The license plate number of Wen Dongen's car is 4225

30
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,365
I'll check the car 7943 and tell you.

31
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,457
With so many photos, how could she...

32
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:19,968
It's my uncle

33
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,303
She, this bitch, actually has a helper

34
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:26,307
I have a way to determine who is driving car 7943

35
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,768
Send someone to follow me starting tomorrow.

36
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,645
It seems

37
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,232
I work so hard that you find me.

38
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,068
You are so bold

39
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,280
You don't know how well I know you

40
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,239
You dare to test me?

41
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,454
Just tell me what you want me to do.

42
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,748
But if

43
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,584
You let my husband know about this.

44
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,753
I won't sit still and wait for death

45
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,256
What else can you do?

46
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,342
At this point, I have nothing to worry about.

47
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,845
I will also file a complaint

48
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,388
Go tell your husband

49
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,143
I'm speechless, damn.

50
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,520
Hello

51
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,066
Let me say a very elegant line.

52
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,153
Lee Sun-ah

53
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,574
Shiming Junior High School, Grade 1, Class 3

54
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:29,746
How?

55
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,915
Do you think you are the only one who can secretly take photos of my daughter?

56
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,792
Can't I check your daughter's school?

57
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,671
It's nothing for you to go to my daughter's school

58
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,965
I can't even mention it?

59
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,260
Should I
Drag your daughter here by her hair?

60
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,511
Will you be able to talk properly this way?

61
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,848
I'm sorry, ma'am.

62
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,308
Please let my daughter go.

63
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,560
Madam, please

64
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,479
Have you finally figured it out?

65
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,732
You chose the wrong character when you first started acting.

66
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,360
I am good at being shameless.

67
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,830
I'm calling you now
Please save my number.

68
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,515
You already have my number?

69
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,266
(The bitch who will be struck by lightning)

70
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,064
Pick it up

71
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,659
But it's so weird

72
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,953
A primary school teacher

73
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:53,996
With the former maid

74
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,291
What is the resonance between the two people?

75
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,213
Oh, I see.

76
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,509
The person you want to kill is your husband.

77
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,596
Wen Dongen also wants to kill someone, and that person is me

78
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,812
It turns out that both of you have someone you want to kill.

79
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,985
Okay, I'll give you the same conditions.

80
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:25,903
Your husband

81
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:27,822
I'll help you kill

82
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,993
I will kill faster than Wen Dongen

83
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,787
I will kill him tomorrow and let you hold his funeral the day after tomorrow

84
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,373
If you want money, I'll give you money

85
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,126
However

86
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,711
From now on, no matter what I say

87
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,212
You have to do what I say.

88
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,007
What do you say?

89
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,590
What happened to mom? Where are we going?

90
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,800
Hurry up and leave before your dad wakes up

91
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,511
Run quickly

92
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:36,891
Hurry up

93
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,476
Time is running out

94
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,024
-Where did this car come from?
- Fasten your seat belts

95
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,276
Don't open the window, okay?

96
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,195
Mom, can you drive?

97
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,797
Aren't you cold?

98
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,591
Have some sleep, I'll wake you up later

99
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,136
Where are we going?

100
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,471
No specific destination

101
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:16,889
Anyway, let's do this first

102
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,391
Keep going forward

103
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:19,976
Why?

104
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,646
Someone might be following us.

105
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,484
We will return to Shiming tomorrow or the day after tomorrow

106
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:29,986
Why?

107
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,321
I should be able to get rid of them before then.

108
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,699
Then you will know where to go which is safer.

109
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,701
Now don't ask anything.

110
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,787
Just do as I say, okay?

111
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:44,625
Mom, you are so cool! So awesome!

112
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,668
Mom, let's listen to music.

113
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,003
Can you please play my oppa's songs?

114
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:11,944
The user you dialed is powered off
After the beep, the call will be directed to voicemail

115
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,946
(Auntie)

116
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,907
What do you do after get off work today?

117
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,744
I already have an appointment

118
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,747
Oh really?

119
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,790
We have a grade meeting today.

120
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,751
About Grade Experience Activities

121
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,461
Today?

122
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,796
I didn't receive any notifications

123
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,090
Yes, because we just decided

124
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,926
In the office at 5 o'clock

125
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:44,060
About this month and next month's cultural festivals

126
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,562
We have to look at what we are going to do.

127
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:50,399
You need to find a new bus company to charter a bus

128
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,151
Then we also need to look at last year’s records.

129
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,362
Details of experience activities held by other schools

130
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,279
To reprint

131
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,199
Just looking at last year's, I can't tell anything

132
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,536
At least look at the past five years

133
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,872
Okay, now we have the framework

134
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:07,833
The remaining teacher

135
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,878
You just need to do it, right?

136
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,964
Do I do it all alone?

137
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,886
Several of us thought so.

138
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,971
If you have any objections, you can raise them.

139
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,394
Objection?

140
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,062
No.

141
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,189
I'll do it

142
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,774
That's what I mean

143
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,609
You do it.

144
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,238
(River Art Rate)

145
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,823
Can I put it here?

146
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,617
Put it on the left side

147
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,621
Is this the most expensive one?

148
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,039
Of course

149
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,916
This is imported directly from Italy

150
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,584
You can buy a used car for this price.

151
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,962
How old is your child?

152
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,882
- Eight years old
-That must be cute

153
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,136
But these days
If there are children at home, they usually don't keep dogs.

154
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,138
Why?

155
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,347
I see

156
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,640
Today's young people

157
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,602
Aren’t you afraid of your child’s respiratory tract infection?
So no furry pets?

158
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,648
There is still a stool that has not been brought in.

159
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,159
Can you please be as brief as possible?

160
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,995
I'm a little busy, Dong En.

161
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,997
I will send you an address

162
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,331
You want to lure Park Yeon-jin there

163
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,000
You just need to do this.

164
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,753
-I'm hung up
- Hey! Wait a minute.

165
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,255
This is too concise.

166
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,465
You have to at least tell me the reason.

167
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,134
How can I lure her out?

168
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,720
I had a big fight with her and she wouldn't answer my calls

169
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,930
That's your problem to solve.

170
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,349
Your wedding dress is very beautiful

171
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,685
I heard you're going to take wedding photos next week.

172
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,608
My mother-in-law even talks to you about this kind of thing?

173
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,735
Before I talk to your mother-in-law about anything more

174
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,695
Hurry up and act, Whiting

175
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,578

(Zhou Ruzheng Plastic Surgery)

177
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,296
You have to go to the parking lot.

178
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,843
You are so annoying!

179
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,054
This sister-in-law

180
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,265
So who are you?

181
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,728
Oh my god, I'm here to see someone!

182
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,188
Really

183
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,524
This damn girl

184
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,944
What are you going to do?

185
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,321
You can't do this

186
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,323
-You go.
-Dead girl

187
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:47,368
My god, you are so annoying!

188
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,410
Where on earth did she go?

189
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,834
There my baby girl

190
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,921
Mom is here to see you

191
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,881
How are you doing?

192
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,265
Hello, someone is looking for you here.

193
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,809
Hello? Auntie

194
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,353
I am Dongen's friend

195
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,730
Have you lost touch with her?

196
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,542
So you're saying

197
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,461
Dongen is working in school now?

198
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,547
What does she do?

199
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,382
Cleaning?

200
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,677
Cooking?

201
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,471
Aunt, don't you know?

202
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,015
Dong En is a teacher now

203
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,269
Teacher?

204
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,314
Civil servant?

205
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,984
Dong En is a civil servant?

206
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,986
She is in a private school so she is not a civil servant.

207
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,155
Anyway, Aunt

208
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:07,656
Can you

209
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,326
Let Dongen be expelled from school?

210
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,249
Are you crazy?

211
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,251
Hello, who are you?

212
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,464
That's her iron rice bowl
Why would I let her get fired?

213
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,383
You can't use her money anyway.

214
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,261
You two haven't been in touch for more than ten years.

215
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,935
I will give you the amount of money Dong En can earn in his lifetime.

216
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,438
Damn it

217
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,858
I asked who you are?

218
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,361
Yeah, you haven't seen me before.

219
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,988
But have you met my mother?

220
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,324
When signing Dongen's withdrawal application form

221
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,241
Don't remember?

222
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,621
Did you pay by cheque at that time?

223
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:04,129
All you have to do is get Dongen out of school.
This time the situation is similar to the previous one.

224
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,884
This is the cost of taking a taxi on your way there.

225
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,303
This is the cost of the taxi back home.

226
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,222
Ask her to sign her resignation letter

227
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,642
You can take the remaining money
You must come and get it

228
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,359
Where does she work?

229
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,071
It won't be in Shiming City, right?

230
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:31,991
How do you know?

231
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,328
Open the door!

232
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,001
Are you in there?

233
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,839
I checked your address before I came here.

234
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,008
I know you're in there

235
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,177
Hurry up and open the door for me!

236
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,681
Are you trying to destroy my apartment building?

237
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,272
Is there a woman living here?

238
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,315
Wen Dongen

239
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,901
She is my daughter

240
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,069
No one lives there

241
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,032
I went to the resident office to check.

242
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,616
It shows that her address is here

243
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,953
Don't lie to me!

244
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,707
I checked before I came here

245
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,297
Do you think you can hide from me?

246
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,007
Open the door for me!

247
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,426
I don't care if you've been to the resident office.

248
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,095
I said there is no one here, that's it.
Why did you destroy my apartment building?

249
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,847
Why? Tell me.

250
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:40,142
Damn, are you crazy, old woman?

251
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,894
Crazy about me

252
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,730
This is my apartment building, get out right now!

253
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,219
Oh my god

254
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,431
The house is so simple.

255
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,894
Is it monthly rent or freeloading?

256
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,605
You didn't buy it, did you?

257
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,983
How do you know I live here?

258
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:34,363
Oh my god, there's not even a bottle of water in there.

259
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,908
Let me change the wallpaper for you

260
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,410
I know a guy who runs a wallpaper service company.

261
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,787
How on earth did you find me?

262
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,624
How can you be a teacher if you are so cold and heartless?

263
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:47,709
However

264
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,212
When did you move here?

265
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,008
I came here in the spring
Someone said you don't live here.

266
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,760
Have you been here before?

267
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,678
Here?

268
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,679
Hello!

269
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,266
I'm your mother

270
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,019
Is it so easy to sever blood ties?

271
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,898
Try hiding again.

272
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,984
I can still find you

273
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,489
You did it, Park Yeon-jin

274
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,829
You've found two straighteners that can handle me.

275
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,335
(Zhou Ruzheng Plastic Surgery)

276
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,181
She is my friend, the dean.

277
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,473
Is it okay for her to come in?

278
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,642
It's good to be able to do publicity at the same time

279
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,438
We are having a buy one get one free event
You can do it with her if you want.

280
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,442
I personally think
Only full-priced items are worth buying

281
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,029
-When will you finish?
-About 10 to 15 minutes...

282
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,615
Wouldn't it be better if you called me over after you're done?

283
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,159
Tell me, what happened to Wen Dongen?

284
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,454
I wanted to tell you earlier.

285
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,081
Don't be scared

286
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:09,833
I'm serious

287
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:14,588
Wen Dongen plays Go with your husband

288
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,133
Is this true or false?

289
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,054
How do you know?

290
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,765
Oh my god!

291
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,266
Do you know how much that is worth...

292
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,101
Can you afford to pay for it if you get scratched?

293
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,562
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

294
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,397
It's okay, go ahead and do your work. I'll just leave this here.

295
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,736
Why buy a bag you can't afford? Why bother?

296
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,571
You'd better bring an eco-friendly bag.

297
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,323
Continue to finish your words.

298
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,076
Why do you say it's okay? This is my bag

299
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,245
How?

300
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,789
Do you think I took the dry cleaner's bag again?

301
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,249
No

302
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,834
This was bought for me by a very wealthy married man.

303
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,044
Why are you so excited?

304
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,380
I mean we need to be environmentally conscious.

305
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,591
I'm not done yet
Do you need me to step aside for a while?

306
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,426
It's okay, I'm leaving.

307
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,678
She is a little sensitive today.

308
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,473
Yes, that's right, my period has come.

309
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:10,185
I didn't sleep with your husband that day.
It's also because my period came

310
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,145
I think it's a pity

311
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,524
What are you talking about?

312
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,279
The married man who bought me this bag

313
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,072
Your husband

314
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:25,200
Your husband told me that he played Go with Dongen.

315
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,952
Is this a small world?

316
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,915
You met my husband? No.

317
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,670
My husband came to see you?

318
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,922
He gave me this bag when he came to see me

319
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,259
I should have told him everything.

320
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,594
But I held back.

321
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,434
Dean, please keep the rest for me.

322
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,852
I'll come back next time

323
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:57,733
Oh

324
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,902
Your husband doesn't want to keep me as a backup, does he?

325
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,905
I'll also do a buy one get one free event

326
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,460
My husband has high standards, right?

327
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,128
He bought her an Hermès bag

328
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,130
What do you think of my side?

329
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:24,468
Anyone who has witnessed my injection technique will come back again

330
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,971
The women in Shiming City must like to come to your place

331
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,932
I will think about it when I feel depressed someday.

332
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,312
Well, if you don't bring an umbrella on a rainy day
Come and get the filler.

333
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,482
It's not the rainy season now.

334
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,734
See you later

335
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,165
- Come in quickly
-Hey, come in quickly!

336
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,083
Let me in, damn it.

337
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,043
Come in

338
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,102
Hello? Team Leader Park

339
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,938
Did your group raid the casino today?

340
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:23,402
Didn't I tell you not to gamble anymore?

341
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,405
You actually went to the casino

342
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,532
Where do you get the money?

343
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,954
If I have to ask him to explain it to me in laborious Korean

344
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,331
You're dead today.

345
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,215
So

346
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,259
After a car accident

347
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,553
You received money from her

348
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:53,140
This is how the accident was handled neatly.
It doesn't look suspicious.

349
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:59,104
Hiring smart people will be tricked by them.

350
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,274
Hiring idiots like you
You're causing me trouble again.

351
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:05,068
I'll give you a job as a criminal.

352
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,820
But you didn't even repay me

353
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,031
How can I quit my job as a police officer?

354
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:13,618
To start my own business? You bastard!

355
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,121
That's enough, go away.

356
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:19,416
I can't give it to you anymore
Do you think I don't have to spend money to buy goods?

357
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,961
I didn't say anything to you before because of Shan Ya's mother's face.

358
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,796
-You go.
- Damn

359
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,090
I'll give you money when that bitch comes back

360
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,258
I told you I would give you money

361
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,677
You said the same thing yesterday

362
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,846
Come back after Shan Ya's mother comes back.

363
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,807
If it were me, I wouldn't come back either.

364
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,058
You really annoy me!

365
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,060
You stinky bitch

366
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:42,314
Be careful or I'll burn down your shop.

367
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,315
Please help me check out

368
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,150
What the hell? Bitch

369
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,444
Be careful or I'll dig your eyes out

370
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,445
I was the first in line!

371
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,989
Why are you mad at my guest?

372
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,741
Sorry, yours is 1200 won

373
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,909
Wait a moment

374
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,828
- Please
-Let go!

375
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,246
Oh my god

376
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,960
I'm sorry I couldn't see you. Please give me a call.

377
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,636
You were right before

378
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,971
Park Yeon-jin found me

379
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,144
(Madam)

380
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,062
I made a mistake

381
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,564
I lost a photo

382
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,565
It's Lee Seok-jae's

383
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,236
Photo of Sun Ya's dad?

384
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,403
Yes

385
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:33,740
Park Yeon-jin may have discovered who you are

386
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:41,039
Don't worry, I'll contact you later.

387
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,541
I'm parking

388
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,689
So I turned off my phone.

389
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,191
Keep driving forward with Shan Ya

390
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,193
Hope

391
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,739
You won't misunderstand me

392
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,033
What did I misunderstand you about?

393
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,412
I'm afraid... what

394
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:24,457
You suspect that I was bribed by Park Yeon-jin

395
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,420
I already wronged you last time

396
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,007
Have you eaten?

397
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,427
Eat

398
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,563
I'll leave my Shan Ya to you.

399
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,816
I have to restart

400
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,444
Also want to attract Park Yeon-jin's attention

401
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:56,489
If she meets my husband, all her plans will be in vain.

402
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,329
Fortunately, I have not encountered that situation. I have confirmed it.

403
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,334
As for Shanya

404
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,461
Don't worry

405
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,046
Good

406
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,299
I'll buy some time

407
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,968
I plan to ask her for money first.

408
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,556
From today

409
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,600
I am Park Yeon-jin's person

410
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:25,644
Ms. Wen Dongyan

411
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,620
You stay here for now.

412
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,455
Give me your phone

413
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,208
Except for me and this teacher

414
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,542
Can't contact anyone

415
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:50,960
Got it?

416
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,922
What about the school?

417
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,592
Your mother will apply for your withdrawal from school tomorrow.

418
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,553
You just need to finish high school in the United States

419
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,806
You should watch American TV series first to practice your listening skills

420
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,726
If I disappear, my dad will kill my mom.

421
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,773
He said if I ran away with my mom
He will kill my grandmother and my sister-in-law too.

422
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,608
There won't be such a thing

423
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:16,111
You have to believe that your mother is waiting here

424
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,155
One thing I can be sure of is

425
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:23,201
Your mother made this choice to protect you

426
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,496
Because this world is too messy and too bad

427
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,750
So you must go study abroad

428
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,086
Study hard

429
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,632
The only brave thing you can do right now

430
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:39,926
Just turn a blind eye

431
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,055
When you are tired of studying, you should go traveling

432
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,640
Visit an art gallery

433
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,393
Enjoy your dinner slowly

434
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,104
You want to live this kind of life

435
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,815
Then we will be satisfied

436
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,785
Teacher Shanya, I'll leave it to you

437
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,120
OK, no problem

438
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,040
You are still a child, right?

439
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,710
She mentioned you often

440
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:17,881
I am Mr. Wen Dongen's teacher

441
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,924
I quit my teaching job a long time ago.

442
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,303
I never thought I could be a teacher and take care of students again.

443
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:25,889
Come

444
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,811
Let's make noodles.

445
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,396
Do you like noodles?

446
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,255
I'll be out around 10 o'clock. I sent you a message.

447
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:00,882
Didn't you see it?

448
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,092
Why do we need to go to that extent?

449
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,095
You have to achieve that first.

450
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,558
You met with Whiting, right? Why?

451
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,603
“Why?”

452
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,105
Don't be so mean to me.

453
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,067
Do you think it's easy for me to act shameless?

454
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,987
What's past is past
The future is another matter

455
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,949
I have no choice now

456
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,575
I am also curious about this question

457
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,703
Do you have any other choice?

458
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,372
Why did you ask Whiting that question?

459
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,459
So what did she say?

460
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:38,753
Do I have any other options?

461
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:39,671
Who else can I ask?

462
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,842
I don't care that Sarah Lee is taking drugs
She destroyed her own life

463
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,928
Are you asking about that thug Jeon Jae-joon?

464
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,680
Asking about Sun Mingwu who is missing?

465
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,307
The mother-in-law who spends a huge amount of money on fortune telling?

466
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:54,978
Do you really have to do this?

467
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,773
You want to stand on their side?

468
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,157
I am on Ye-ryul's side

469
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:13,663
If you really feel any guilt towards me and Ye-ryul

470
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:18,376
You should just wait quietly.

471
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,716
You don't feel any guilt towards us.

472
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,552
Really not

473
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:43,985
Is there anything wrong in the store?

474
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:44,903
Yeah

475
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,571
I'm here to have Louis's beauty treatment.

476
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:47,947
Are you busy this weekend?

477
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,199
Weekends are the busiest

478
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,870
-What's wrong?
-Then we'll close this weekend.

479
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:55,622
Nothing

480
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:59,208
I want to give a girl a Christmas gift
But I don't know what she likes

481
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,544
Can you go to the mall with me?

482
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:02,670
She is very small

483
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,006
Can't I choose here?

484
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,052
Is it the one with red hair?
Or the car model who speaks in dialect?

485
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,595
Damn it

486
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,097
I asked you to help me distinguish between green and red

487
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,641
Christmas is all about fucking...

488
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,894
Are you free?

489
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,689
What counts as an “accident”?

490
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,274
What?

491
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,276
You just asked: "Is everything okay?"

492
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,446
Yeon-jin's husband came alone

493
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,366
Is this considered an "accident"?

494
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,328
When? What is he coming for?

495
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,788
I don't know

496
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,249
He tried on a piece of clothing and left.

497
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,214
(Surveillance video November)

498
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,717
Was that his first time coming that day or had he been here before?

499
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,427
Anyway, it was the first time I saw him coming here.

500
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,972
I don't know
Has he ever come when the part-time worker is here?

501
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:56,599
How long do we keep these?

502
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,226
There are no deleted files?

503
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,687
Generally stored for 30 days

504
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,357
But there are none before October 19th
Because the system has been reinstalled

505
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,777
Reinstall the system? Why?

506
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,238
Because Yeonjin asked me to delete it

507
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,534
Ha Do-young's Here

508
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,279
Ask about Sun Mingwu?

509
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,614
Dean Zhou asked me

510
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,451
He showed me a surveillance video.

511
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,703
Asked me if the man in the picture was Sun Mingwu

512
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,329
When?

513
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:04,250
I told him everything about Sun Mingwu
But he didn't tell me about the surveillance.

514
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,877
Less than a month ago

515
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,296
I forgot all about this

516
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,964
But when you said the police came to you to ask about Sun Mingwu

517
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:10,882
I remembered it again

518
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:15,762
The police went to look for Zhou Ruzheng?

519
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:23,936
Wow, Wen Dongen has become so interesting.

520
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,212
Are you Dr. Zhou Ruzheng?

521
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:50,713
Right?

522
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,591
I just saw you walk by but I'm not sure

523
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,010
You told me last time

524
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:59,097
If someone comes to the morgue
I want to tell you

525
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,807
Is it a female?

526
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,558
Not a man

527
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,560
Came here about two hours ago

528
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,147
This is his contact information

529
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:10,817
(Sun Mingwu)

530
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,485
I haven't met him in person

531
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,154
I only have his cell phone number

532
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:17,406
Then after a long time
I called him once.

533
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,659
When was that?

534
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,870
October 19 at 11:15 pm

535
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,083
But he hung up as soon as he answered the phone and cursed

536
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,086
You remember it so accurately.

537
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,713
Because there is a record on the phone

538
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,216
Also

539
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,844
Why did you call him?

540
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:38,886
Oh

541
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,556
I was working at Seoul Chow Hospital

542
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,850
There has been a dead body in the hospital for a long time.

543
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,727
The case was closed as suicide in 2004.

544
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,106
But the family of the deceased did not accept the investigation results

545
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,899
So they refused to take back the body.

546
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,653
Then I heard someone came to see the body.
So I thought it was a family member.

547
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,281
But that person is Sun Mingwu

548
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,366
Are you responsible for the corpse?

549
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,450
No

550
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,327
Oh

551
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,454
I forgot to tell you

552
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:08,207
Seoul Chow Hospital
The former and current deans are my parents.

553
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:10,835
Oh really?

554
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,008
But is there anything wrong with me calling him?

555
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,093
Can't say there is a problem

556
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:23,556
But you were the last person to call Sun Mingwu

557
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,433
Oh

558
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,938
You make me suspicious.

559
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:33,316
What?

560
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:35,610
Just kidding

561
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,196
Not funny, right?

562
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,699
If you have any other questions
You can send me a text message

563
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,075
I have an appointment

564
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:28,412
(Sun Mingwu)

565
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,128
It turns out she is

566
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,841
Intentionally wanted me to find Sun Mingwu

567
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:58,150
(Hotel)

568
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,372
Although the weather is good, I am in a bad mood
So I came over

569
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,374
I heard you open the door at night

570
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,793
Well done

571
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,963
Many people go out when the weather is good.
If I forget to bring my parasol, I will come here.

572
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,008
Do you have a girlfriend?

573
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,509
No

574
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,219
You have many girlfriends, right?

575
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,680
I have a very smart and beautiful

576
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,474
But a very cold girlfriend

577
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,268
It seems that your girlfriend is a bad type

578
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,355
That is usually

579
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,858
How tolerant can men be?

580
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,819
Suppose a girl makes a lot of mistakes

581
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:43,821
This

582
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:48,868
Although men usually hope
My woman is a natural beauty

583
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,122
But as long as you don't tell him
No matter how you do plastic surgery, he won't care

584
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,791
What if he already knew everything?

585
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,294
Then you should get fillers.

586
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,839
It can keep you beautiful without leaving any traces
Because it will gradually disappear

587
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,300
So you can pretend you didn't do anything.

588
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,468
Until discovered

589
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,015
Are fillers such a romantic thing?

590
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,268
Then let me see if you are right.

591
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,394
It's for sleep anesthesia.

592
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,146
When injecting fillers, you should also observe the customer's reaction while injecting

593
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,856
No need to look at the reaction, are you good at it?

594
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,859
I don't like the feeling of fillers being injected

595
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,612
Okay, then you can take a nap.

596
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,900
I guess we need to talk for a long time.
And it can't be heard by others

597
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,903
So I chose Seoul instead of Semyung.

598
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,782
I haven't been to Seoul for a long time.

599
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:11,450
So this is good.

600
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,831
I've heard about your relationship with Yeon-jin.

601
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:18,624
There must be some details

602
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,127
You haven't heard yet

603
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,350
I'm going to give you an injection of propofol.
This will put you into a hazy state.

604
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,562
Please count down from ten.

605
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,440
Ten

606
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,363
Long time no see Mr. Ha

607
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,281
Yes

608
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,366
Please give me your coat.

609
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,784
Thank you

610
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,079
9.

611
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,348
Eight

612
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,520
By the way, you know what?

613
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,983
If the gas inside is not completely squeezed out before injection

614
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,818
There is a possibility of loss of life

615
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:29,278
Seven

616
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:31,489
What?

617
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,449
You are to Sun Mingwu

618
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,076
What did you do?

619
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,098
Come on

620
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,324
What are you looking at?

621
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:16,659
One minute

622
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,369
It's the limit of my patience

623
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,747
Do you have anything to say? Go ahead.

624
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,749
Well, you're still the same.

625
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,002
Listen up, Yeonjin.

626
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,713
I mean, Jeon Jae-joon

627
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,841
To be honest, I not only drive for him

628
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:35,928
I also chatted with him, drank with him and became friends with him

629
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,221
Hey, you know

630
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,431
Although I only have a high school degree

631
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:42,518
But in fact, it is the same as graduating from university
Because I took all his classes in college.

632
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,146
But he didn't give me face.

633
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,566
Ask me to be the driver

634
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,150
Let's talk about the main point

635
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,068
I'm super annoyed now

636
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,613
I feel the same as you.

637
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,782
If it were me, I would at least

638
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,286
Strive for the position of chairman of a construction company

639
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,289
Instead of just sleeping with you

640
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,173
Who is it? Damn it

641
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,676
You fucking bastard

642
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,511
Don't call me

643
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,892
Did he interfere with your recording?

644
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:24,935
What nonsense are you talking about?

645
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,188
I'm getting fed up with these poisonous insects

646
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:31,525
What the fuck are you doing?

647
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,778
You crazy bitch

648
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:35,738
Enlightenment

649
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,781
To be honest, I was looking forward to it.

650
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,200
The result is that I cheated on my partner?

651
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,953
If you want to threaten me, you have to be sincere.

652
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,332
Do you think making money is so easy?

653
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,543
I will buy you a new phone

654
00:43:58,761 --> 00:43:59,678
How about this?

655
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,389
Yoon So Hee

656
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:08,896
Yoon So Hee?

657
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,190
Who is that?

658
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,275
Damn you bitch!

659
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,363
Yoon So-hee's body is still in Zhou Hospital

660
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:18,947
It's been more than ten years

661
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,494
I know you were on the rooftop that day

662
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,621
What nonsense are you talking about?

663
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,123
Be clear

664
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,958
There is nothing in my words that you don't understand.

665
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,630
The evidence that proves you were there that day is right here.

666
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,009
In here

667
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:45,557
That's right. You finally showed your true colors.

668
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,187
If you don't believe me, go check it yourself.

669
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:54,692
I'm going to take this to your radio station tomorrow.

670
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,096
Wow!

671
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,223
Now bidding is easy!

672
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,100
So you were there that day

673
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:33,021
You know I'm just talking about the chairmanship.

674
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:34,565
I want cash

675
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:37,401
Let's start with 1 billion won

676
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,029
You bastard!

677
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,713
This thing is hard to buy, Yanzhen

678
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,757
This is strawberry flavor.

679
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,010
If

680
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,264
You let me use this on you
I'll give you a discount of 10 million won

681
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,725
If you let me cum without this

682
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,018
I'll give you another 10 million won discount.

683
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:11,935
How?

684
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,481
Oh no!

685
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:17,357
I almost forgot

686
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,067
What to do?

687
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:24,656
One minute has passed.

688
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,073
And then?

689
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:12,162
What happened after that?

690
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,332
What? Who are you?

691
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,043
Whose voice was that just now?

692
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:28,220
Are you awake? Ms. Park Yeon-jin

693
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,687
