Dark Glory

2
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:11,821
Well played

3
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,699
Oh, this time the fight was good.

4
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,288
However, the hitting distance is much shorter than the serving distance.

5
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,999
Where?
You play at the level of a professional player.

6
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,586
Wow, you are really amazing.

7
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,881
Shin Young-joon

8
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,550
How reckless do you think you can be?

9
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,471
One day I was following him and saw him enter this place

10
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,806
So I went there twice more.

11
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:42,060
(Yongshan Funeral Home)

12
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,394
Is this a funeral home?

13
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:46,147
It has been closed for three years.

14
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,485
Guess what I found there?

15
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,446
Fasten your seat belts

16
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:19,556
(Closed and no entry or exit allowed)

17
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,231
Generally speaking, an ordinary house

18
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,651
The maximum electricity consumption is about 2,000 kWh per month.

19
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,820
But this abandoned building

20
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,739
The electricity consumption has exceeded 5000 kWh.

21
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,116
And it’s still a long way to the end of the month.

22
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,161
That means electricity is also being used inside.

23
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,246
Yes, and the place where electricity is used is

24
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,499
Mortuary

25
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,215
(Mortuary)

26
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,133
So what?

27
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,844
What do you think is in that morgue?

28
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,139
Sun Mingwu

29
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,309
It is very likely that Director Shin bribed the manager there.

30
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,519
The owner currently lives in Los Angeles

31
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,689
The funeral home has been for sale for three years.

32
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,483
Now there is one
The owner of a nearby lottery shop helped to watch

33
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,985
Do you want to confirm?

34
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,112
The funeral home

35
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,698
Do you have any idea?

36
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:23,620
First

37
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,457
I have to let Wen Dongen eat

38
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,126
Because it's more important to me

39
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:38,843
Very delicious

40
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,511
Hello

41
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,265
You can't just come in here. This is private territory.

42
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,477
I have the permission of the owner of this private land.

43
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,603
I am a real estate agent

44
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,899
Real estate agent? What are you doing here?

45
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,652
No way? Didn't you receive a call from the landlord?

46
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,863
It turns out I'm not the only one who can't contact you

47
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,282
Anyway, these two people want to see this property.

48
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,325
Open the door now

49
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,285
We have already discussed this with the landlord.

50
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,497
What? Wait a minute.

51
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,290
Let me make a call first

52
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,126
Who do you want to call?

53
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,420
Deputy Chief Police Inspector Shin Young-joon?

54
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,101
(Dead)

55
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,448
It turns out that you are not looking at this building but this

56
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,534
Your lottery shop opened recently, right?

57
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,785
Huh?

58
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,995
Actually, before I met you

59
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,664
We are not sure if this is Shin Young-jun's doing.

60
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,500
But now it seems that

61
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,961
Why are you testing me?

62
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,797
What are you going to do now?

63
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,881
What else can I do?

64
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:00,800
Aren't you going to call the police?

65
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,510
No

66
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,221
Not calling the police?

67
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:07,932
Really?

68
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,728
Why not call the police?

69
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,647
Look, they still keep the bodies in a vacuum.

70
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,651
Probably to preserve the evidence intact.

71
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,569
Why?

72
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,405
Maybe the corpse is like Shin Young-jun's hair straightener.

73
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,158
Shin Young-joon helps Yeon-jin deal with the trouble she caused

74
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,285
But in the process of handling it, he had other plans

75
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,454
How sure are you?

76
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,497
It is also possible that Shin Young-joon himself got into trouble.

77
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,166
99%

78
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,128
If it was Shin Young-joon who caused the trouble
He won't leave any traces.

79
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,421
He had no reason to keep the body.

80
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,674
Why do you keep 1%?

81
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,676
Because there may be

82
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,179
God's intervention

83
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,307
I've never had good luck.

84
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,355
Let me fill in the remaining 1%.

85
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,319
I will make it 100%

86
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,113
What can you do?

87
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,783
Can you ask Park Yeon-jin to come to my clinic?

88
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,952
Tell me, what happened to Wen Dongen?

89
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:13,456
The married man who bought me this bag is your husband

90
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,834
Your husband told me that he played Go with Dongen.

91
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,461
Is this a small world?

92
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:24,050
It is said that a winter with a higher temperature than previous years is called a warm winter.

93
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,806
The reason for the heavy fog in winter is the warm winter weather.

94
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:36,145
So this is just
It's just the normal cold of winter.

95
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,480
Ms. Park Yeon-jin

96
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:47,782
Dark Glory

97
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:51,577
Have you found out who is dating Wen Dongen?

98
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,287
Yes

99
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:56,249
He is a plastic surgeon
Recently opened a clinic in Shiming City

100
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,250
Doctor?

101
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,252
Is she worthy?

102
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,755
He is very young and his clinic is doing very well.

103
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,882
Not to mention his handsome appearance

104
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,176
-That height...
-Sister-in-law

105
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,345
Sorry

106
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,722
His name is Zhou Ruzheng

107
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,184
Born into a family of doctors, he has a very good family background

108
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,062
Zhou Ruzheng?

109
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,022
Sun Mingwu

110
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,859
You've said this name many times.

111
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:26,571
It turned out to be that guy

112
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,991
What do you mean when you say he has a good family background?

113
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:34,120
Is it related to Seoul Zhou Hospital?

114
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,288
How do you know?

115
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,124
I heard that he is the son of the director of Seoul Zhou Hospital.

116
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,920
The country will be mostly cloudy starting from the weekend

117
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,089
Rainfall will occur in some areas

118
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,508
Affected by the low pressure trough in the north

119
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,469
Precipitation on the central west coast

120
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,263
Starting in the afternoon, it will gradually spread to

121
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:55,099
Central, Jeolla, and western Gyeongsang inland areas

122
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,810
This round of precipitation is expected to continue into next week

123
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,979
Next Thursday is

124
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:04,484
Winter Solstice: Shortest Day and Longest Night

125
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,694
The ancients believed that if the weather was warm during the winter solstice,

126
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,321
It will lead to the spread of various diseases in the coming year

127
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,281
Many people will die.

128
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:15,536
(Seoul Joo Hospital)

129
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,944
(New message missed call)

130
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,281
You'd better reply

131
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,450
Otherwise you will get into big trouble

132
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,130
See how I defeat you next time. Please stay tuned.

133
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,928
(Hong Young-ae)

134
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,153
You are crazy...

135
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,491
Are you crazy? How can you come to the police station?

136
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,868
Why didn't you answer my call?
Why don't you reply my text message?

137
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,288
I asked you to come, why didn't you come?

138
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,832
I have to stay at least until 6 o'clock to keep my job.

139
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:46,252
Then you shouldn't take it from me
Get more money than your monthly salary

140
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,296
Money is regularly deposited into the fake account

141
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,839
Do you think that's all your money?

142
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,176
I understand. Calm down, okay?

143
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,720
How can I calm down?

144
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,972
That bastard works day and night
Call me, send me a text

145
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:58,931
I'm going crazy

146
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,475
So I sent you Lee Seok-jae's personal information.

147
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,144
Why did you send that to me?

148
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,938
There is that time
Why don't you just go and sort this out, you wimp!

149
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,444
You're taking that too far.

150
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,361
Am I overdoing it?

151
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,114
You are a civil servant for a lifetime

152
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,824
Buying a house in New Zealand

153
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,326
Send daughter and granddaughter abroad to learn languages

154
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,535
Isn't this too much?

155
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,079
The guy who used to have such a hard time paying off his mortgage

156
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,249
Is it not excessive to purchase the hotel in the name of my sister?

157
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,084
More than that!

158
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,421
Eating tofu will cause your teeth to fall out

159
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,633
Thanks to me for giving you the amulet every month.

160
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,593
I helped you to improve your luck, and you actually said I was overdoing it?

161
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,679
Now you are showing off my horoscope?

162
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,639
Show off?

163
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,017
Why didn't you say anything when you took the money?

164
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,185
Damn it, that's enough

165
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,857
I'm beginning to feel a little overwhelmed.

166
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:54,195
So you got me, right?

167
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,283
Where are the real friends in this country?

168
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,244
There can be accomplices, right?

169
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,542
Same-day delivery

170
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,475
What is this photo?

171
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,394
Parent Notification Letter

172
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,481
I don't know whether to send it to Ha Do Young or to you

173
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,066
But I finally sent it to you.

174
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,526
(Under construction)

175
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,027
Because you are Ye-sol's father

176
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,823
So what? What is this?

177
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,325
His name is Qiu Zhenghao, 39 years old

178
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,829
He is a teacher at Shiming Primary School
He took pictures of the children

179
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,373
The photos you received also include Yilu

180
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,561
Get the fuck out of my way
Be careful or I'll knock your lousy car over

181

182
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,397
Get out of my way you bastard

183
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,859
What the fuck you son of a bitch?

184
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,571
Are you looking for death? You bastard

185
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:25,661
I can climb to the top

186
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:29,123
I can also hang upside down and let go

187
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,917
Really? Wow, you are so brave.

188
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:35,045
Who can show me their strength?

189
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,505
I'm coming

190
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,597
Kim Seung-ah, Ha Ye-yul, Han Seung-woo, Choi Min-ji

191
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,433
The nannies are waiting for you.
What are you still doing?

192
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,393
Hurry back to the classroom, wash your hands, and pack your schoolbags.

193
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,061
- Good
- Good

194
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:56,734
Slow down

195
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,497
If you do this, others will think I'm a little weird.
You are quite good at this.

196
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,624
I have sorted out everything you asked me to do.

197
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,502
Do you want me to print it out or send you an electronic version?

198
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:23,177
Can solve the problem of Teacher Qiu
The fastest and most reliable method

199
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:24,929
What do you think it is?

200
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,515
Of course, this method is a bit rough

201
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:31,268
But I don't have time
Don't waste your time on this kind of person.

202
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,603
If I were to put it mildly

203
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,483
I think you won't understand

204
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,818
So I'll just say it straight

205
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,444
You tell me

206
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:47,993
I

207
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:52,081
I really hate powerful women.

208
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,459
I respect your preference

209
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,174
Okay, I can't stand it anymore.

210
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:06,846
Come with me

211
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,433
Who is Qiu Zhenghao?

212
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,438
How did you get in?

213
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,857
Walking in

214
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,901
Which bastard is Qiu Zhenghao?

215
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,864
It's me, who are you?

216
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,329
What can I do for you?

217
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,998
Oh, is that you?

218
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,502
So this is

219
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,716
Is that your camera?

220
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,610
Call the police now!

221
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,405
Who are you? What kind of guy are you?

222
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,365
Hey, I advise you to grit your teeth

223
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,784
Otherwise the teeth will be swallowed

224
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:14,288
Let me tell you first
I won't make peace, you bastard.

225
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,834
Is it the police station?

226
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,463
I am here at Shiming Primary School

227
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,132
-I won't do it again
-There's a fight going on here, it's a mess

228
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:30,763
This is for you

229
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,310
This is the experience activity data I compiled last year

230
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,271
I think this might help you

231
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,192
If

232
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,861
There's something else in there

233
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,530
Even if it's my mistake

234
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,408
You can turn a blind eye

235
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,705
Why are you helping me?

236
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,751
For me
It takes a lot of courage to do this.

237
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,464
I can't fight what's in here.

238
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,593
But I think you can do it

239
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,566
Wait a minute

240
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,484
Wait a minute

241
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,448
- etc.
-Come here you bastard

242
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,329
Wait a minute

243
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,111
Don't cry, Ye-ryul

244
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,614
Speak slower. I don't understand what you are saying.

245
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,908
Uncle Jeon Jae-joon

246
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,413
What did you do at your school?

247
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,666
Wow, this is beautiful, isn't it?

248
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,335
How come the pattern suits you so well?

249
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,670
Try it fast

250
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,634
How about we go to see the sea as soon as the money comes in?

251
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,263
I've been blackmailed so I know

252
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,223
No one can bear it

253
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,600
That woman won't last long.

254
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,436
Husband

255
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,813
Let's just live a good life.

256
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,149
This is too dangerous, okay?

257
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,859
Damn it, you said something unlucky again

258
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,277
Damn

259
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,779
You're really

260
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,033
I'll tell you when I get home

261
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,912
I'm worried because her daughter has killed more than one person.

262
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,873
There are two

263
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:06,752
Two?

264
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,382
Philippines

265
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,511
I heard the Philippines is very good

266
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,555
Mangoes are very cheap there.

267
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,475
I'll buy this for you tomorrow. You should try it.

268
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,726
Must try

269
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,613
-Big Brother
-What's wrong?

270
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,198
That clothing store that day

271
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,367
The guy who got hit on the head

272
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,036
Why are you bringing that up all of a sudden?

273
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,622
Why is there no thing that hits the head?

274
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,291
Is there something very heavy there that we don't see?

275
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,840
Who knows? We know nothing.

276
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,675
So you have to shut your mouth

277
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,281
Thanks to you guys last time

278
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:37,551
Chengxi said this is not for your own use

279
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,719
Yes

280
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,850
Could you also help me put all the utensils in place?

281
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,144
I don't know how to do it

282
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,775
Let me go. Why don't you let me go? Huh?

283
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,904
It is legal in the Netherlands
I will never return home, okay?

284
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,780
So let me go

285
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,074
Didn't they say it was cured? Why is it still like this?

286
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,326
What are you doing?

287
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,494
She has become Satan's child.
What have you done?

288
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,248
Husband, let's send her to a rehabilitation center first.

289
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,919
You can just advertise directly.
To publicize the pastor's daughter's drug use

290
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,338
I said in Paris that I didn’t want to come back!

291
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,714
-Be careful or I'll beat you up
- Damn

292
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,507
Do you think we were willing to bring you back to China?

293
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,760
People from the Paris Korean Association were saying

294
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,846
You guy
Every night I take drugs and sleep on the street

295
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,473
Yes, Sarah

296
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,684
In Korean
There is an auntie to help you with the injection and someone to take care of you

297
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,479
You can't even speak English
How to live in the Netherlands?

298
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,689
I can't spell Korean
You can still live well in Korea

299
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,274
Why is the Netherlands failing?

300
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:37,110
Let me go, I'm going

301
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,278
Let me go, Dad, let me go.

302
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:41,573
Mom, let me go.

303
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:42,991
Damn

304
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,328
Where are you going? Let me go.

305
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,415
Victims willing to reconcile

306
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,793
I suggest you meet the victim.
Who are the victims?

307
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,586
That bastard is a criminal

308
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,214
Hundreds of fucking photos
Photo of a child's skirt fluttering

309
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,173
He is not a victim

310
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:01,051
About this violent incident
Just tell me whether you want to reconcile.

311
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,179
Secret photography is another matter

312
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,432
The law is fucking weird.

313
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,017
Why is it another matter?

314
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,185
Hey, tell me

315
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,645
Please be quiet

316
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,856
You just talk to me, we are willing to reconcile

317
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,984
Hey, damn, I don't want to reconcile

318
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,610
I want him to go to jail

319
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,658
You are the one who called me...

320
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,076
Yes

321
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,912
I am Cui Yuanshi from the legal team of Zaiping Construction Company.

322
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,873
What is going on here?

323
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:32,916
This is what I told you

324
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,628
Qiu Zhenghao's settlement agreement

325
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:37,713
OK, thanks

326
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,340
Are you fucking crazy?

327
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,175
Are you crazy?

328
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,636
Shut up

329
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,390
If you don't reconcile, you will be the one going to jail

330
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:14,207
I think Zaiping team went
It will be easier to reach a settlement than if we go

331
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,208
That's why I contact you

332
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,544
As for the candid photography incident

333
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:21,173
Both civil and criminal matters will be handled by us.

334
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,591
Why should you do this?

335
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,801
If anything should be done, it should be me who does it.

336
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,012
Isn't it?

337
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,599
Who are you?

338
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,101
Ask you

339
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,230
What qualifications can Jeon Jae-joon
Filing civil and criminal lawsuits?

340
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,860
It seems you already know

341
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,196
Right?

342
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,115
You know I'm Ye-sol's biological father.

343
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,246
You are more shameless than I thought.

344
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,625
Don't you feel any shame at all?

345
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,961
Damn you bastard

346
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,925
- You can't do this here.
-Are you crazy? We are in front of the police station now

347
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,593
-Okay, let me go.
-Can't do this

348
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,180
Damn it

349
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,575
Damn

350
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,376
Enough! Stop it!

351
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,794
River General

352
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,046
Wait, let me go.

353
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,298
Damn it

354
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,635
Let me go

355
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,220
I didn't stop you

356
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,806
I rescued you from the police station not for your own good.

357
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,434
It's because you shouldn't be involved in this matter.

358
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,561
So you go

359
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,022
You've overestimated your own abilities.
So shut up and get out of here

360
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,201
Damn

361
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,790
Police station?

362
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,209
Has anyone reported us to the police?

363
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,837
The reason is that the body is illegally kept

364
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,589
They want to see the morgue and the cold room

365
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,215
What to do?

366
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:31,970
Where are they now?

367
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,100
The autopsy has been completed and the resettlement period has passed.

368
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,059
(Winter 2004)

369
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:41,313
If the body is left here, it will rot.

370
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,231
You must have a funeral

371
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,817
‎(If we hold a funeral, everything will be in vain)

372
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,069
‎(I feel wronged)

373
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,907
‎(Please help)

374
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,576
‎(Please help my poor daughter)

375
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,995
You can't do this here.

376
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,624
Do you understand what I'm saying?

377
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,541
(Funeral Consent Form)

378
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,920
Please read this
Then just sign here

379
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,464
You can also use fingerprint

380
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,220
Oh, Auntie

381
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,057
This is a real headache.

382
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:20,769
No consent from the deceased's family
We can't dispose of the body without permission.

383
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:21,770
That's right

384
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,397
Temperature in the morgue
The lowest temperature is about 0 to 4 degrees

385
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:28,610
The body will rot in less than six months.

386
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,863
There will definitely be a lot of stench and excrement.

387
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,781
Yes

388
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,575
So we have to move the body to the cold room.

389
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,369
What?

390
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,705
Oh my god, Dean, we're going to be in big trouble.

391
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,584
She said her daughter did not commit suicide

392
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,921
The investigation results have nothing to do with us

393
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:51,007
Why should our hospital bear the damage?

394
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,301
I think this matter will be resolved soon.

395
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,971
Encourage good and punish evil

396
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:01,226
Before that, let's help them bear the responsibility.

397
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,438
I heard someone reported us.

398
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,024
However

399
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,403
It's weird no matter how I think about it

400
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,906
If this causes inconvenience to anyone
That should be our hospital staff.

401
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,993
But insiders
It is impossible to report it after 18 years.

402
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,160
Even stranger is

403
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,372
If you want to report
You should contact the district office or the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

404
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,874
Why report to the police?

405
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:31,464
I don't know
But if we receive a report, we must confirm it.

406
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:35,343
Just move the body to the morgue.

407
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,972
The citizen who reported it is me
Do you know what it means?

408
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:41,558
Know

409
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,813
The hospital did not obtain the consent of the deceased's family.
Do you admit that you moved the body to the cold storage room without permission?

410
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,566
And the purpose of refrigerating the body is unclear.

411
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,483
“Intention”?

412
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:53,236
Refrigerating corpses may also be for illegal research

413
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,696
Or other improper purposes

414
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,284
You must move the body back to the morgue.

415
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,162
No

416
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,623
If there is any illegal matter
We will be punished

417
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,626
But we won't bring back the bodies.

418
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,253
(Yin Suxi)

419
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,088
She died unjustly

420
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,924
But the truth has not yet been found out

421
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:17,927
This is our intention

422
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,597
Pretty clear, right?

423
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,355
You dead guy

424
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,774
Or reply my message

425
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,692
Or answer my call

426
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,196
Are you putting on airs? I know you're a doctor.

427
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:47,207
Let me see

428
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,834
(Come out for a moment. I have something to tell you.)

429
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,587
(I guess you don't answer the phone
Because it is an unfamiliar number)

430
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:53,922
(I am Dongen's mother)

431
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,173
(I am your future mother-in-law)

432
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,766
Damn it.

433
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,813
Oh my god, where did I write this?

434
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,817
(Mother of Dongen's junior:
Do you dare not answer the call from your future mother-in-law?)

435
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,947
Add some side dishes here

436
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,365
Buy

437
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:26,621
- Let's close that room as well.
- I said give me some more

438
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:29,290
Damn you bitch

439
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,392
Why are you here?

440
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,146
Didn't you go to pick up Ye-ryul?

441
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,898
Ye-ryul left school early today and went to grandma's house

442
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,401
The river is always inside

443
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,704
I just submitted a petition for a temporary restraining order against Jeon Jae-joon

444
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,456
We will deal with this as soon as possible

445
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,458
Thank you for your hard work.

446
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,793
I'm going to the construction site. See you at the company tomorrow.

447
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,378
Why did you send Ye-ryul to your mother's house?

448
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,714
Because there is a need, we can talk later.

449
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,716
I learned about my family affairs from the driver...

450
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:21,885
What happened to your lips?

451
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,804
Did you get into a fight?

452
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:28,308
Now I can't say nice things
So we can talk about this later. Is it that hard?

453
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,852
I can't even ask
Why did my daughter leave school early?

454
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,355
You want to remind me
You've been patient for a long time, so do I owe you?

455
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,484
You can just say something unpleasant.

456
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,902
You might as well have a quarrel.

457
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,197
Okay, I said it.

458
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:47,035
I don't know where to start talking about this.

459
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,830
Your affair partner went to my daughter's school to cause trouble

460
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,458
Called himself the biological father so I was angry

461
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,294
You refute it.

462
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,968
You're curious if I know

463
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,971
Ye-ryul is my daughter, right?

464
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,310
You know everything about me, tell me

465
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,945
You don't understand how I endure this.

466
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,074
Even at this moment

467
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:29,035
Is your own safety the only thing you care about?

468
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,288
The performance rate has become like that

469
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,918
You're still testing me

470
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:40,922
I at least

471
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,509
I have worked hard to keep our marriage alive.

472
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:46,511
That's why I hide the truth.

473
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,890
You're the one who broke the news and screwed up everything.

474
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,809
So what did you hold onto?

475
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,521
The relationship between you and me, and between you and Ye-ryul
And your career

476
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,025
You didn't keep any of them.

477
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,867
Let me make this clear

478
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,037
Ye-ryul is my daughter

479
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,250
Even if we separate

480
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,609
(Shengya's mother)

481
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,278
Hello? Honey

482
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,155
Why don't you reply my message?

483
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,574
How do you plan to give gifts to teachers?

484
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,284
We are going to school now

485
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,994
You also need to vote

486
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,121
The school is in a mess now.

487
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:58,499
A teacher was arrested
What do you think is going on?

488
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,418
What should I do? I'm so sorry.

489
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,462
But I haven't finished get off work yet

490
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,631
Please help me vote

491
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,718
How can you accept gifts? Are you crazy?

492
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,471
Teachers like that should be fired

493
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:02,063
(Sent from Kim Shi-woo's mother)

494
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,579
Why didn't you call me when you came here?

495
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:21,666
Don't touch these. I haven't taken the labels off yet.

496
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,004
Hello

497
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:26,921
Really

498
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,927
How can you even do such a thing?

499
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,763
It's fine if you come to me

500
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,057
I can understand that you are still shameless

501
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:42,186
But you shouldn't
Standing with the man who destroyed his daughter's life

502
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,065
How could you abandon me again?

503
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,819
How could you abandon me like this again?

504
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,571
Even if I die

505
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,492
You shouldn't cross this line.

506
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,911
Do you know how much this is?

507
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,580
These are very expensive

508
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,213
Hello

509
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,091
Stop

510
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:13,509
Stop

511
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,136
Stop

512
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,516
You

513
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,726
Crazy Woman

514
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,809
Oh my god, it's so noisy

515
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,520
Get off

516
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,814
Let's do a parent interview

517
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,152
Ha Do-young also came to the police station

518
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,822
Didn't you say you would just send it to me?

519
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,574
Your mother is cheating?

520
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,827
I told you to get off the bus, damn it.

521
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:08,916
Wow

522
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,544
Come on

523
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,504
Hit me

524
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:16,340
Hit me you idiot

525
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,103
Are you okay?

526
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:36,903
Oh my god, I just bought this car recently.

527
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,322
So you're still not used to not being injured?

528
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,619
Are you fucking crazy?

529
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:49,749
Is your mother drunk?

530
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:53,044
I really want to ask you why you are here on a rainy day
Standing in front of someone else's car like that?

531
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,295
Wearing all black

532
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,715
Luckily I was driving a good car, otherwise you would have been hit

533
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:02,428
Forget it. Be more careful next time and don't die too early.

534
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:03,888
What?

535
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,640
Damn

536
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,934
You're fucking crazy

537
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,478
Here's my number.

538
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,024
Sue me or reach a settlement
Let's all call this number, okay?

539
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,319
I'm going to be busy

540
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,619
I'm going to turn around

541
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,081
If you continue to stand there
I bumped into you this time

542
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,423
Hello

543
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,591
Hello

544
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,177
You get off

545
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:44,762
Get the fuck out of the car

546
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,437
Hello

547
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,523
Hey

548
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:56,941
Hello

549
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,446
What the fuck?

550
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:12,915
I'm moving out. You have to vacate the room within a week.

551
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,960
This life

552
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:20,548
I hope today is the last time I see you

553
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,719
Stop talking to me and go away

554
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,222
How many times do I have to tell you?

555
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:32,560
It's not easy to sever blood ties

556
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,356
I went to the resident office to get a certificate

557
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:40,401
You can find out where you are

558
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,409
Try hiding again.

559
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,873
See if I can find you

560
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:21,817
I'm fine

561
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,074
I'm fine too

562
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,577
What are you busy doing walking around?

563
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,162
I just

564
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,626
Want you to know I'm here

565
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:41,462
Did you see it?

566
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,640
But why were you there just now?

567
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,939
Dongen's mother contacted me

568
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,317
Park Yeon-jin must have given her my number

569
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,157
By the way, let me tell you

570
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,243
I will go to bed early

571
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,579
I will stay in my room until late.

572
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,251
So you can be casual here.

573
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,338
Good night

574
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:31,345
Good night

575
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,624
(Where is your clinic? I'll go there.)

576
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,085
(I heard you are a doctor
I just want to treat you to a meal to say thank you)

(Seonghan Faith Church)

578
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,488
-Hello
-Welcome

00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,869
This is the black card phone photo inside

580
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,128
Hey, ma'am, it's me

581
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,547
There is something I think I should tell you.

582
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:53,469
What? Wen Dongen just joined the church.

583
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,386
Church?

584
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:56,430
Why?

585
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:59,225
Does she suddenly want to repent and be redeemed?

586
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,811
I don't know if God is here now.

587
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:03,979
Hey, sister-in-law

588
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,899
Do you think it's a problem for her to go to church?

589
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:10,819
Oh, the church she went to was

590
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:15,449
Your friend Sarah's church

591
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,085
-Hello
-Hello

592
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,344
(I invite you to the Garden of Eden)

593
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,228
Rise up and fight the devil

594
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,938
Brothers freed from sin

595
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:49,984
Boldly fight against the evil forces

596
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:53,988
Judgment Day and Doomsday are coming

597
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:57,533
Coming Soon

598
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,201
Glory Hallelujah

Smile at the camera)

I bought it with the dollars you gave me)

Smile at the camera)

610
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,878
Thank you

611
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:51,837
Amen

612
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,843
How can you, a drug addict, pretend to be an artist?

613
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,054
Sun Mingwu?

614
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,265
You are Satan

615
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,941
Go inside

616
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,027
Climb back into the wall

617
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,836
Look, I told you that you are good at climbing, right?

618
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,588
You climbed well that day.

619
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,174
You have to remember

620
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:23,220
Think carefully about how you look like Sarah, like a dog

621
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,211
I remember

622
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,759
I remember

623
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,463
Did you do this?

624
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:23,924
Did you do this?

625
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:26,885
This is what I prepared carefully

626
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:28,470
Is that ok?

627
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,350
You're wasting your time

628
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,144
Sarah is a first-time offender and will be released soon.

629
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:37,354
With your tricks

630
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:40,315
You can't make me and Sarah fall

631
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:41,859
Is that so?

632
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,696
Then try to hold on tightly so as not to fall.

(Colleague group: Who is the weather anchor talking about?)

636
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,159
(Drug use? Who?)

637
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,076
(I think it's drug abuse)

638
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,836
What did you do?

639
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,840
Sarah Lee can be released soon but you can't

640
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,927
Because you killed someone and it wasn't even your first offense

00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,362

Evidence

644
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:12,366
Do you have one?

645
