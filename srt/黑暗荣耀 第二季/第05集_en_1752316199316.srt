00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,544
-Oh my god
-This is really too perverted

7
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,172
- Unbelievable
-How can you do such a thing?

00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,590
Miss Sarah Lee, I'm a police officer

14
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,342
Damn it

15
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,260
Miss Sarah Lee

16
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,027
The whole country was in an uproar

17
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,238
I saw

18
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,371
You really don't make good use of the doctors around you.

19
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,622
What if scars are left?

20
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,208
How did you endure until now?

21
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,585
You want to apply ointment to me so much

22
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,671
Wow, look at you

23
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,673
You obviously know it's true

24
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:55,842
It's really worrying

25
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,888
Can this little injury make people anxious?

26
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:00,889
It makes me anxious

27
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,473
What? Are you going to sue me?

28
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,060
Did you take good care of your wound?

29
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,646
Who told you to leave it alone?

30
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,026
Because I feel ashamed

31
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,197
Didn't my mom contact you again?

32
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,491
No, this shouldn't end like this.

33
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:24,704
We just discussed a very heartwarming topic...

34
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,122
You haven't had breakfast yet?

35
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,707
I'm going to cook today

36
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,292
Why are you doing this?

37
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,294
Is the food I cook bad?

38
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,754
It seems you don't know

39
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,841
This house is in the rain
Feels like a giant vitamin effervescent tablet

40
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,051
Stop changing the subject.

41
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,844
Keep your hands away from the pan.

42
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,645
She was soaked by the rain
Shivering and now asleep

43
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,314
Her mother said she couldn't come now.

44
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,066
It's really worrying

45
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,746
Get up

46
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,416
What are you doing here?

47
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,466
I have no other place to go

48
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:21,928
Did you see it too?

49
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,596
What is said on the Internet

50
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,892
How could I not see it? All the staff were watching.

51
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,816
Do you want to break up with me?

52
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,695
Let’s solve the urgent problem first

53
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,072
Let's go to the company now

54
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,408
The lawyers will come too.

55
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,078
Thank you, husband

56
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,955
No need to thank me, this is a normal response procedure

57
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,917
If the stock price cannot be maintained
It’s hard to say what the performance will be in the second half of the year

58
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,504
Whether to break up with you is the last step

59
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:10,226
Dark Glory

60
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,770
The article on the Internet says

61
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,897
A certain anchor

62
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,232
Is that you?

63
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,737
Are there any suspicious people who posted the message?

64
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,157
Please confirm the true part of the article.

65
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,664
Do you have any evidence to prove that this is me?

66
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,709
No evidence

67
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,212
That means this isn't me, right?

68
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,508
You mean it's not you that's being talked about here?

69
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,885
How do you understand it?

70
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,848
Once I respond
People who didn't know it before will also know it

71
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,434
In this case, not responding is the best response.

72
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:57,106
I know the people better than you lawyers.

73
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,783
You just have to survive 48 hours.

74
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:10,078
Urine and hair tests are required after the search warrant is issued

75
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,165
Even if you are sentenced, you can get probation if it is your first offense.

76
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,417
So you just have to keep your mouth shut, understand?

77
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:17,502
I understand!

78
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,213
Dad, I'm a victim now.

79
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,714
My portrait rights have been violated

80
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,342
So you can't just find one or two lawyers

81
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,927
You need to find four or five.

82
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,638
What's the point of bringing two lawyers here? Damn it.

83
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,145
Miss Sarah Lee
For testing, please collect urine

84
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,313
Do you have a search warrant?

85
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,482
I know it hasn't been sent yet.

86
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,400
Because it was an emergency arrest

87
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,986
Have you done a lot of homework?

88
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:44,946
It doesn't look like a first offense.

89
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,450
You junior civil servant, please get out of here

90
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,250
Why did you come to pick it up so late that day when you were in such a hurry?

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,835
This life

92
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,586
It's just unpredictable

93
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,213
Show me

94
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,259
No deleted files

95
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,428
So there is nothing to analyze

96
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,555
This hard drive is brand new

97
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,390
What the hell is that?

98
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,517
This hard drive has been used for more than four years.

99
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,352
Maybe someone changed the hard drive.

100
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,355
If it is deleted, it can be retrieved
But if you change the hard drive, there is no way

101
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,691
What file are you looking for?

102
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,988
Where are you? Do you have time today?

103
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,031
I'm not talking about Yeonjin and Sarah.

104
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,160
I discovered some things about Sun Mingwu

105
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,996
I mean, Jeon Jae-joon

106
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:39,167
To be honest, I not only drive for him

107
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,877
I also chatted with him, drank with him and became friends with him

108
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:42,670
Hey, you know

109
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,464
Although I only have a high school degree

110
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,967
But in fact, it is the same as graduating from university
Because I took all his classes in college.

111
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,428
But he didn't give me face.

112
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,346
Ask me to be the driver

113
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,682
Let me just say the point. I'm super annoyed now.

114
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,935
Doesn't this sound like Myung-oh is threatening Yeon-jin?

115
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,062
If it were me, I would at least

116
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,399
Strive for the position of chairman of a construction company

117
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,526
Instead of just sleeping with you

118
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,113
What's wrong?

119
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,616
The recording seems to be interrupted halfway through.

120
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,868
Back a little to the front

121
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,495
At the beginning, I was talking about wine.

122
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,002
"Pommar...D?"

123
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:26,797
What the hell?

124
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,720
"Sauvi..."

125
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,180
Damn, I can't even read this.

126
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:37,892
Which one is the most expensive?

127
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,186
If I choose the cheap one, I will be wronged.

128
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,064
Rely on not understanding

129
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,150
Okay

130
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,610
If you don't know, pick a safer one.

131
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,701
Poma, Sauvignon, Living Soul

132
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,286
Which one do you want?

133
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,790
I made an appointment with my husband tonight

134
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,713
What's wrong?

135
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:13,928
What is it?

136
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,473
Did that guy take your drink too?

137
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,058
This recording

138
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,269
Have you told anyone else about it?

139
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,480
No, you are the first

140
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,777
Can you raise an eight year old?

141
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:32,905
Why are you asking this suddenly?

142
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,366
Whose child is this?

143
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,663
My

144
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,002
Do you have children?

145
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:49,672
Yeah

146
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,049
But my child is at Yeon-jin's house

147
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,801
What are you talking about?

148
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,972
Are you talking about Ye-ryul? Ha Ye-ryul?

149
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,348
It is the all-round rate

150
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,811
What? You don't want to?

151
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:09,942
It's very novel

152
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,069
How you propose

153
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,364
Is it necessary to ask whether I can support her or not?

154
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,533
Of course I have to bring her back.

155
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,577
She is your flesh and blood

156
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:21,912
Do you want to come in?

157
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,201
Did you know?

158
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,578
You're really an asshole

159
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,080
I know

160
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,500
You want pickled spicy cabbage?

161
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,335
This year it's a little later than usual

162
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,171
I'm quite busy these days.

163
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,255
Is that so?

164
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,260
(Teacher Wen Dongen)

165
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,724
June 16, 1987 at 1:10 am Yoon So-hee

166
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,310
Total 43,800 KRW

167
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,020
Dear

168
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,522
Are you wearing makeup?

169
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,065
Oh my god

170
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,566
Is it too red?

171
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,734
Oh my god

172
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,571
Shan Ya's father is determined to be a good person

173
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,243
He said he would stop drinking and live a good life
So I decided to trust him for once

174
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,494
Really?

175
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,498
Oh my god, I'm so happy for you!

176
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,709
So that's how it is

177
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,545
Although he always buys on credit
But he has been missing recently.

178
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,296
I was worried that something had happened to him.

179
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,634
By the way, why is Shan Ya nowhere to be seen?

180
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,553
She went to her grandmother's house

181
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,055
Because of her dad?

182
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,392
That would be better.

183
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,855
Oh, you gave me 1,000 won more.

184
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,816
Then I'll take this

185
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,861
You really don't have to be so polite.

186
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,238
You are beautiful today, wear makeup every day

187
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,990
I'm embarrassed when you say that.

188
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,283
Thank you, sister

189
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,225
Hey Jinglan

190
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,977
How long will you cry? Tomorrow morning?

191
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,021
Stop crying you bitch

192
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,109
Jinglan

193
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,819
If you yell again

194
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,279
I'll put this in your mouth

195
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,031
How come she is here?

196
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,787
Is she crazy? She came to my house on her own.

197
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,179
The day I first met Mingwu during my afternoon nap

198
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,057
Do you recognize me?

199
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,478
Wine, water, coffee, what do you want?

200
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,649
Coffee

201
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,447
Why didn't you tell Yeon-jin?

202
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,282
There is no need

203
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:47,743
Just tell me.

204
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,787
What do you want from me?

205
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,497
Articles about Suxi being bullied

206
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,332
Did you see that?

207
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,920
We both know who the perpetrator is.

208
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,590
After Suxi, it's me

209
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,552
-Then comes...
-Shut up

210
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,099
So what?

211
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,476
Do you want me to testify?

212
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:13,936
No

213
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,855
I want to ask you not to do anything

214
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,149
I have been observing the noon nap for a long time

215
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,777
So I know you lived there before.

216
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:27,867
But after October 20th
You moved from your nap to this temporary single room

217
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,537
Since that day, Yeonjin no longer tried on clothes there

218
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:35,583
Sun Mingwu disappeared at that time

219
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,628
Anyway, that bastard deserves to die

220
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,049
And why are you telling me this?

221
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,719
Because I think you already know

222
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,013
Sun Mingwu is dead

223
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,520
We can save our past selves

224
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,980
This is the last chance

225
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,316
So don't interfere.

226
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,403
No matter what you see
Know something or hear something

227
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,656
Please don't do anything

228
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,659
The one who killed Sun Mingwu

229
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,662
It must be Park Yeon-jin

230
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,581
Jinglan

231
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,969
- Zhong Xian
-Wow, that's great.

232
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,847
Okay, Dean Zhou

233
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,099
Oh my god

234
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,938
Opened such a good clinic
Why do you need proof of qualifications?

235
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:39,855
You want to treat me to a meal

236
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,273
I am looking for a job

237
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,567
‎(Qualification certificate name: Zhou Ruzheng)

238
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,612
Let's go. What do you want to eat?

239
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,031
Are you crazy? It must be beef.

240
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,367
I've heard this a lot recently.

241
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,037
Oh, right.
Is my letter among those sent to the hospital?

242
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,455
I can't update my address for some organizations

243
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,583
It would be great if you could bring it to me.

244
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,794
Those letters

245
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,297
I'm not coming now, the dean knows.

246
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:08,884
Oh, my mom knows.

247
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,136
I was negligent.

248
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:14,974
But this must be kept secret

249
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,266
Seriously, what do you want that for?

250
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,186
What?
I need to know what it is so I can keep it a secret for you.

251
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,646
Let's talk about it another day, really.

252
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,356
I will definitely tell you

253
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,358
How about we go drink in broad daylight?

254
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,609
Please

255
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,488
- Come
- Let's have a drink

256
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,328
Drinking during the day is the best thing in Shiming City

257
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,122
-Come, let me mix your drink
-Okay

258
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,541
We meet again

259
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:24,960
Yes

260
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,544
How?

261
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:09,797
Do you feel this time

262
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,925
My chess style is very similar to someone you know?

263
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,349
Very good at sticking and very good at turning

264
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,602
Very calm and peaceful

265
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,439
Make the other person follow you fascinatedly

266
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,860
As you chase, you will suddenly find
Your territory has been destroyed

267
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,993
I learned Go from my father

268
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,080
I taught her everything I learned.

269
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:44,706
Taught to Dong En

270
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,626
Because she said she wanted to beat someone

271
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,799
Are you helping her get revenge?

272
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,136
I have no reason to stop her.

273
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,096
I don't understand

274
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,140
Which part?

275
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,768
I don't know what your relationship is.

276
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,855
But if you care about her, shouldn't you stop her?

277
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,065
Compared to the benefits of revenge

278
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,067
Because of being obsessed with something that cannot be undone
The losses caused by

279
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,695
It will be bigger

280
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,705
Among the things lost by the victim

281
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,251
How many things do you think can be salvaged?

282
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,632
Honor and Fame

283
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,010
Are there only these two?

284
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,307
Some people forgive

285
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,018
Some people take revenge

286
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,063
Only by finding these can we return to the starting point

287
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:56,195
Only after returning to the starting point
Dongen's life can only really begin when he is 19 years old

288
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,996
I am supporting Dongen to return to the starting point

289
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,248
She just wanted

290
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,670
Make yourself less miserable than you are now

291
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,344
I don't know how you understand what I just said.

292
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,891
Anyway, I also hope that Wen Dongen will be happy

293
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,144
That

294
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,482
I can understand

295
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,113
They're not talking about Yeon-jin

296
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,490
You've seen tabloid hype before.

297
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,909
I'm driving and it's dead

298
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,552
Just now

299
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,764
She recognized me.

300
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,275
That bastard

301
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,278
You know my home address

302
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:25,701
(New information)

303
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,995
Your daughter killed

304
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,871
Not just one person but two people

305
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,457
By the way, it was nice to see you just now

306
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,132
Two?

307
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,013
(Mom)

308
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,351
I am Kim Boo-sung, a reporter for the Post
You are the weather anchor Park Yeon-jin, right?

309
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,602
Have you seen the article about school violence?

310
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,730
Some people say that the article might be about you

311
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,897
Not me

312
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,774
Is this your official statement?

313
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,443
Will Zaiping Construction Company issue a statement?

314
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,445
You graduated from Shenghan High School, right?

315
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,655
Have you seen the video of your classmate Sarah Li?

316
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,073
- Please say something
- Say something

317
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,075
-Can you say something?
- Say something

318
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,410
Please...

319
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:31,641
Do you have any evidence?

320
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,896
Do you have any evidence?

321
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,857
More than that

322
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,551
What are you doing?

323
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,185
Jae-joon just called and asked

324
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,938
Who replaced the hard drive of the surveillance camera?

325
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,817
Jae-joon seems to have taken the hard drive for data forensics

326
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,030
Want to replace the hard drive?

327
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,199
Don't make me say the same thing twice

328
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,535
I came here yesterday and suddenly thought of

329
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,412
My husband may come over in the next two days.

330
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,790
I heard that deleting files is not as good as replacing the hard drive

331
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,335
You also know how careful my husband is.

332
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,255
I don't know

333
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,882
Didn't you just know?

334
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,843
Don't tell Jaejun

335
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,387
Good

336
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,646
The surveillance video is gone and time has passed.

337
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,523
The body was also buried

338
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,191
And Director Shin won't say

339
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,110
No matter what you hear

340
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,529
You can't prove Wen Dongen

341
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,614
What should I tell Jaejun?

342
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,617
Just say that I changed it, isn't that a fact?

343
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,873
Let's continue trying on clothes here.
From tomorrow on, you bring your clothes here.

344
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,050
Kang Hyun-ah

345
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,640
June 16, 1987

346
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:40,479
Oh, this is really a fate

347
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,482
Mountains and rivers are all alive, and everything is not going well

348
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:47,235
A small boat floating on the vast ocean

349
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,445
It makes me sad.

350
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:54,117
Yes, she was severely bullied as a child.

351
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:57,496
To resolve this kind of eight characters, you must resolve

352
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,081
This shouldn't be who you are?

353
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,545
I thought you could see through all this, didn't you?

354
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:11,259
The general asked me to leave
You are a woman who is not serious and talks back

355
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:14,137
Yin Suxi is the owner of this horoscope

356
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,517
General Her name is Yin Suxi, born in 1987

357
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,520
Please take a look

358
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:29,611
Oh my god

359
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,906
Life is hard, life is hard

360
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:36,618
She still worries about her family members who are not doing well at work

361
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,287
Be extra careful about stamping this year

362
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,205
You will be scammed

363
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,875
Oh my god, you are so smart

364
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:49,047
The general said he wanted to perform a shaman dance

365
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:53,218
He said he wanted to hold a large-scale shaman dance ceremony

366
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:58,974
The ceremony is very large-scale. Can you accept it?

367
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,642
Of course

368
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,436
As long as it can resolve her suffering
I'd do it even if I had to do it a hundred times.

369
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,189
Please make it bigger for me. The bigger the better.

370
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,741
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

371
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,494
You don't need to help me, just go.

372
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,704
What happened today?

373
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,330
‎(Personal information of Lee Seok-jae)

374
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,095
Didn't I show you this person before?

375
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,013
Yes

376
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,347
Please help me look at his face.

377
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,559
Is this bastard really short-lived?

378
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:44,978
Who is he?

379
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:45,895
Wizard

380
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,189
Come and cast a spell with me.

381
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,275
You just need to give him a call.

382
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,111
I have to go and pray, you go back

383
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:57,073
Although my power is not as strong as before,

384
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,575
I can't do that, I'll be punished.

385
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,076
If you really had to be punished, you would have received it long ago.

386
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,830
Think about your use of the eight characters as bait

387
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,415
How many girls have you pimped for?

388
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,583
How do you speak?

389
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,501
So you listen to me.

390
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,963
You also need to build a bigger temple.

391
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:16,593
This bastard asked me for 1 billion won

392
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,136
I want to ask you about this 1 billion

393
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,931
Should I give it to this bastard or to you?

394
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,225
Don't you think he has a short life?

395
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,479
1 billion won?

396
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,073
(The bitch who will be struck by lightning)

397
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,996
Hey Madam

398
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,998
What has Choi Hui-jung been doing recently?

399
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,917
She doesn't answer my calls

400
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,835
Oh yeah

401
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,588
That lady is in that gentleman's house

402
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,715
What madam and what sir?

403
00:27:56,591 --> 00:28:00,679
Oh, Choi Hye-jung has been at Jeon Jae-jun's house these days.

404
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,597
She also goes to work from his home

405
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,640
What?

406
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,557
(Future husband)

407
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,268
Dear, I have thought about it carefully.

408
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,145
I still feel like I'm not worthy of you

409
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,022
Thank you for this time

410
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,400
I sent you the ring today.

411
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,568
I hope you can meet someone better and be happy.

412
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,197
‎(Block this user)

413
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,414
Jun!

414
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,759
You are really here

415
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,138
Yes, what happened?

416
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,056
I'm dating Jaejun

417
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:46,683
Since the day before yesterday

418
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:47,976
Congratulations

419
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,186
Your last time

420
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,314
Why did you call me to that plastic surgery clinic?

421
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,859
Zhou Ruzheng Plastic Surgery?

422
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,405
You knew at the time
Is he the son of the director of Seoul Joo Hospital?

423
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:04,200
He is the son of the director of Zhou Hospital?

424
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,789
Yes, his last name is Zhou.

425
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,710
Then why is he in contact with Wen Dongen?

426
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,630
You ask me, who should I ask?

427
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,593
You should know
You are the one who is in contact with Dong En

428
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,680
Did she ask you to lead me there?

429
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,934
What else did she ask you to do?

430
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:32,937
However

431
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,191
I see you are quite free.

432
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,319
You came all this way just to ask me this?

433
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,364
Everyone is talking about you online

434
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,453
-Have you become braver?
- How?

435
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,206
Do I need your approval to become bolder?

436
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,001
Aren't you afraid that I know too much?

437
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:55,919
So bold

438
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,173
Daring?

439
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,258
Jaejun didn't answer your call, did he?

440
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,429
Stop being so presumptuous, Park Yeon-jin

441
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,099
It's no accident that you can't contact Jaejoon

442
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,691
I bought him this shirt.

443
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,194
I'm just telling you

444
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,329
Can you take it?

445
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,252
Looking back, I think the breast augmentation was a success

446
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,930
(Jongno Police Station)

447
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:49,931
Give me that rubber band.

448
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,349
For you

449
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,142
Damn

450
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:54,811
My scalp is itchy

451
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,106
But you're sitting there with your blond hair

452
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,774
Like a scene from an American TV series

453
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,860
You look perfect for this iron window.

454
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,945
It's fun, isn't it?

455
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,030
What about the others?

456
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,283
Of course they won't come.

457
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:09,951
Especially Yeonjin

458
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,411
What happened to Yeonjin?

459
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,079
Don't you know?

460
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,250
How would you know if you were arrested?

461
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,128
Don't beat around the bush. What did you just say?

462
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,964
Yeonjin's bullying incident exposed
But it was overshadowed by other news

463
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,465
Thanks to the news about your drug use

464
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:29,971
There are also exclusive media reports
Your exhibition is suspected of tax evasion

465
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:34,350
It's too much of a coincidence, isn't it?

466
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,604
It's like she's using you on purpose
To cover up their own scandals

467
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,446
Hello, let us take some pictures of the exhibition works.

468
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,156
Can it be done in a moment?

469
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,035
Let's go out, hurry up

470
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,082
I saw your message very late

471
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,959
This is the property management fee.

472
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,588
I thought you ran away

473
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,257
I see your mother is the only one in your house

474
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,468
Two days ago I heard a loud noise.

475
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:16,351
When my mother came to see me

476
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,979
Why did you tell her I didn't live here?

477
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:27,070
There has to be someone supporting you.

478
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,116
Blood relations are tricky

479
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,577
Otherwise it wouldn't be called Tianlun

480
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:39,374
But you don't have to take it all on yourself.

481
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,712
God also makes mistakes sometimes

482
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,633
Please hand it in on time next month

483
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,599

‎(Medical Officer Kim Jin-hoon)

488
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,040
You stinky boy

489
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,458
How long has it been since we last met?

490
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,503
The last time I saw you, I was still a military doctor.
So it's been three years

491
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:08,421
Salute

492
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,298
How are you doing?

493
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,551
Do you think I can live well?
Dealing with a bunch of terrible people all day

494
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,972
But you are the scariest person I have ever met this year

495
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,144
Show me

496
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,563
The personal information is very complete

497
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,858
But I think I still need you to help me push it

498
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,487
When I first saw you

499
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,697
I think your life should be like a convenience store.

500
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,325
Just like buying banana milk at a convenience store

501
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,786
Buy a house or a car as you wish

502
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:42,663
I didn't expect someone like you...

503
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,751
Did you know
How surprised was I when I received your call?

504
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,004
Thank you for listening to what I said from beginning to end

505
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:51,672
When will you go abroad?

506
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,717
Wait until the next one is confirmed
I'll leave after handing over my work.

507
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,388
You may be rejected during the document review stage.

508
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,642
I heard it's up to the warden's discretion.

509
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:03,643
And there is indeed a shortage of people here.

510
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,813
Such a famous case

511
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,107
How could the warden not know?

512
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,359
So it has to be me

513
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,444
So that I can carry on my father's legacy

514
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,196
Zhou Ruzheng?

515
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,449
Doctor

516
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:40,471
I still remember that moment clearly.

517
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,308
I remember the pungent smell of blood

518
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:49,772
The sound of a knife piercing the neck

519
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,900
The temperature of the blood flowing on my hands

520
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:57,905
Even his last moment
I also remember the gradually fading gaze

521
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,411
I knew you would recognize me

522
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,167
I'm sad that you didn't reply to my letter

523
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,045
How could I forget you?

524
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,300
Thanks to you, I am now living in hell

525
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,889
I knew I knew you would recognize me

526
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,270
This place has everything good

527
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:31,856
It's just too boring, sir.

528
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,328
I want to ask you a question

529
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:50,583
Why did you do that?

530
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:56,005
You didn't say
Do you remember that moment clearly?

531
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,467
Why did you kill the person who saved you?

532
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,594
Not a beast

533
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,431
How could a person do something like that?

534
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,571
Today is so interesting

535
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,577
Will I have a chance to see you next time?

536
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,459
3724 Stay away from the barbed wire

537
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,420
No talking to outsiders. Back off.

538
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:44,845
Of course I'll see you later.

539
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:47,890
Next time I see you

540
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,560
I'll show you the hell I'm in.

541
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,688
The next time I see you

542
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,942
I'll show you the hell you're going to.

543
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,070
Before that

544
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:04,865
You must take care

545
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,725
We don't have time for coffee.

546
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,979
The wizard said that it will only be effective if you do it at the specified time.

547
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,065
Go blow dry your hair

548
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,318
What are you doing?

549
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,072
What is your dream?

550
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,199
What did you say?

551
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,284
No matter what

552
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,287
From now on, remove me from your dreams

553
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:52,997
Buy a new phone

554
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:57,793
Uncle

555
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:01,130
Isn't it because I helped you ward off bad luck that the spell worked?

556
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:02,631
Hello? What's up?

557
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,304
I'll be there soon

558
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,891
What's the effect? Damn it.

559
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,603
Funeral home sold?

560
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,438
When? Who bought it?

561
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,899
Oh, I don't know that.

562
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,193
I just received a notification.

563
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,364
Anyway, you have to dispose of the body as soon as possible.

564
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,872
I didn't think I would say something like this.

565
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,291
How is your business?

566
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,293
Are there many guests?

567
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,295
Huh?

568
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,216
Oh

569
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,801
Thanks to your brother

570
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,011
Thank you for your concern

571
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,262
Right?

572
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,515
That's what I have to say

573
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,434
You didn't say anything else?

574
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,146
How could that be? Brother, I would also be in big trouble.

575
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:03,984
I told him as you instructed.

576
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,196
I said I received a notice from the landlord.
I'll do it by the end of this month

577
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,572
So he had to deal with the body quickly.

578
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,074
Thank you for your hard work.

579
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,659
Please call me when they have a date.

580
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,943
Whose recipe did you refer to?

581
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,696
The top search result

582
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,239
I really can't do anything about you

583
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:06,589
Where did you go today?

584
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,134
A bit far away

585
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:13,554
Let me see the wound

586
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,104
If we

587
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,648
In different situations

588
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,525
Meeting through different channels

589
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,070
Will it be different from now?

590
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:35,201
Same

591
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,287
No matter what you look like

592
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:40,581
I will always like you

593
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,167
99%

594
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,837
Why keep 1%?

595
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,341
Because now it is 100%

596
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:58,807
Completely healed

597
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,659
You are held hostage by me

598
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,079
Said the noodles were delicious

599
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,085
If you force me like this

600
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,087
The noodles can't be bad.

601
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,880
Teacher, where are you going?

602
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:13,966
Ha Ye-ryul

603
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,261
If you want me to apologize

604
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,722
I apologize to you all the time

605
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:21,932
Until the moment I die

606
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,476
Why?

607
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,521
Because I love you

608
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,149
I really feel guilty.

609
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,112
Goodbye

610
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,978
Congratulations, you have achieved your goal.

611
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,397
I quit my job at school.

612
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,733
I'm coming over now so you get out of my house

613
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:19,490
Ms. Park Yeon-jin

614
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,158
I don't accept interviews

615
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:22,951
I am a police officer

616
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,087
It's not easy to see you

617
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:35,506
I know you read all the messages.

618
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,091
But you don't answer the phone

619
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,551
What can I do for you?

620
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:42,429
Where were you on the evening of October 19th?

621
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,100
A policeman came to see me

622
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,102
He asked me what I did on the night of October 19th

623
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,480
I told him I was recording a show.
What now?

624
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:54,566
Did you know that the police have started an investigation?

625
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:55,734
You haven't confirmed it yet?

626
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:57,653
Can't you stop investigating?

627
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,531
Yes

628
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:02,783
No

629
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,246
What are you doing?

630
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,248
Are you done?

631
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,543
Can I tell you about my story today?

632
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,755
I'm retiring

633
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:20,551
I want to move to a country with hot weather
Play golf every day

634
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,094
Recently everyone likes to move to Hawaii

635
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,933
You want to retire? Things have come to this.

636
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,017
It's because of this

637
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,438
I would take the opportunity to use other people's money to do this.

638
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,905
Why should I go out?

639
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,491
I won't leave

640
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:48,954
Whatever you want

641
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:50,998
Why did you quit your job at school?

642
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:55,878
Hold on a little longer and you'll make a lot of money

643
00:45:56,462 --> 00:46:01,717
How can you be a teacher with your character?

644
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:04,052
Good job, girl

645
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,805
Just now

646
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:09,266
He is my boyfriend

647
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:14,605
You're still staring at him like this.

648
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:18,817
Fortunately, he is kind-hearted.
Otherwise he won't leave obediently

649
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:21,069
If it were someone else

650
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:24,114
I would have slapped you a long time ago.

651
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:27,409
I shouldn't have given birth to you.

652
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,704
Others told me to get rid of it.

653
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,499
I tried my best to give birth to you

654
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,835
Raised from childhood

655
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,463
I'm sorry

656
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,006
Sorry

657
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:46,595
I deserve death

658
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,893
After taking the money, you were the first to sever the mother-daughter relationship

659
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:53,811
Get out!

660
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:57,022
You stinky girl

661
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,233
Really

662
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,570
Stab me, kill me.

663
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:07,783
Except killing me
There's no other way you can catch me.

664
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:25,092
Are you scared now?

665
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,846
Can you buy me a house in Hawaii?

666
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,015
Can you give me some cash sincerely?

667
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:34,685
I'm retiring soon

668
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,521
I also feel it's a pity that I didn't wait until the expiration date.

669
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,902
Why do you think I will do what you ask?

670
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,698
Sun Mingwu's corpse

671
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:50,617
I haven't buried it yet

672
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:54,997
What did you say?

673
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:58,166
71-1, Seonghan-dong, Jongno-gu
An unidentified body was found

674
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,084
Departure

675
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,837
I'll say it again
An unidentified body was found

676
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,589
The first team is on its way

677
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,745
I will never forgive you

678
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:42,920
(Unable to adapt)

679
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,589
I won't forgive you because

680
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,593
You still don't know

681
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,554
You are the first person to hurt me

682
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:58,602
So

683
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:00,812
Don't laugh

684
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,440
Don't laugh like that!

685
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,110
I just want to laugh. What do you want?

686
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,446
Okay

687
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,448
We are mother and daughter

688
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:16,411
Let's burn to death together today

689
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:18,956
You stinky girl

690
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,308
Say you did it wrong

691
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:44,648
Say sorry right away

692
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,742
Thank you mom

693
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,412
Thank you for not changing at all

694
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,708
Thank you as always

695
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,586
Thank you so much

696
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:17,050
