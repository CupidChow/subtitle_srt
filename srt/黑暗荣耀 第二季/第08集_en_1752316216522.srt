1
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:05,982
Dark Glory

2
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,821
Did you know this all along?

3
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,325
Did you know

4
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,204
Did I approach you on purpose?

5
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,671
Yes

6
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:33,510
Since when?

7
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,346
My relationship with Suxi

8
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,015
How do you know?

9
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,520
I knew it before
Yoon So-hee's body in the morgue

10
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,982
And I wanted to send you a prescription.

11
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,068
So I saw your student ID card.

12
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:51,903
Found out you are the same age

13
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,656
I guess you are friends.

14
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,368
You ran out of the emergency room like that.

15
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,246
So I followed you out

16
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,959
I'm an intern here.

17
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,719
(Mortuary)

18
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,481
(Search:Seoul Joo Hospital)

19
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:16,779
Sorry

20
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,991
I knew my usefulness from the beginning

21
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,952
The son of the hospital director

22
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,250
After knowing everything, I found out that I was

23
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,461
The best executioner

24
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:33,922
So I thought

25
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,966
I really want to be used well

26
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,971
If she wants to use me
I want to run there anytime, day or night

27
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,432
I also want to no matter where it is

28
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,895
I want both
Get to her before she feels guilty

29
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:52,982
But you left

30
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,947
Thank you for giving me guidance during this period

31
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,740
You must be a good doctor

32
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,451
Will we never see each other again?

33
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,161
Why?

34
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,247
At that time

35
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,999
Why did you leave me?

36
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,336
Now that you have made up your mind, you should use me.

37
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,380
You should do that.

38
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,174
But you gave up on me

39
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,301
I can't understand it no matter how hard I try

40
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,388
I've always been curious

41
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,559
I learned from Suxi's mother

42
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,187
I heard about your father's death.

43
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,691
She said your father was her benefactor

44
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:40,738
So I'm worried that Suxi will be taken out of the cold storage room.

45
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:43,700
Then

46
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,412
I learned that the intern I met in the emergency room

47
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,622
He is the son of the dean.

48
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,545
I thought there was a glimmer of hope.

49
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,299
So I approach you

50
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,386
But then I thought

51
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,140
“How can I just be a victim?

52
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,101
And with this thought in mind?

53
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,439
This person

54
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:16,858
I am also a victim.”

55
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,616
Then I feel relieved

56
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:32,040
I thought you left me
Because I'm really not your type

57
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,295
So now

58
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,925
You have even less reason not to use me.

59
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:46,888
If you reject me

60
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:51,476
That's Love

61
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,188
Rather than revenge

62
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:10,912
Okay

63
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,874
Please help me

64
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:17,919
Until the end

65
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:24,884
I will obey

66
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,720
Until the end

67
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:34,894
Dark Glory

68
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,708
Your mouth that laughs at other people's misfortunes

69
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,253
Finally, because of you, I became unfortunate and quiet.

70
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,922
(You bitch!)

71
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,551
The scar itches and stings all the time

72
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,094
It will be hot

73
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,012
I've experienced this too.

74
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,027
Do you know why I want revenge?

75
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,697
The past 18 years

76
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,949
You all forgot about me

77
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,743
That's why I want to be remembered by you.

78
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,121
Now

79
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,624
Do you also want to be remembered by someone?

80
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,546
Yeonjin is almost done, and so is Sarah.

81
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,715
Thanks to you, it's easy to do.

82
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,092
So my schedule is cleared.

83
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,470
If you want to fight back, tell me.

84
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,804
I will help you

85
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,223
Don't you want revenge?

86
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,100
To Jeon Jae-joon

87
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,298
(Are you in there?)

88
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,471
(I'll get something)

89
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:35,890
Yeah, I'm in there.

90
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,935
Take them all, don't leave any behind

91
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,539
Jae-joon suffers from glaucoma

92
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,542
So I put eye drops to lower my eye pressure once a day.

93
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,419
But you know sometimes accidents happen.

94
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,964
For example, glass water splashes into the eyes

95
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,924
Or hand sanitizer gets into your eyes

96
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,759
Importantly

97
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,011
After Jaejoon

98
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:18,516
Whether it is a red-haired model, a car model or Yeon-jin

99
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,768
You won't see it

100
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,316
How do you say?

101
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:29,860
Do you want this?

102
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,498
(Iophobia-lowering eye drops)

103
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,044
Will it take a long time?

104
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,007
I have to take a shower and go out

105
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,551
Oh, sorry.

106
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,927
I always forget

107
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,929
You can't talk?

108
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,097
Then clap your hands

109
00:09:58,764 --> 00:09:59,599
10 minutes

110
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,851
20 minutes

111
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,355
Wow, your sign language is improving so fast.

112
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,357
No problem with communication

113
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:10,901
Just 10 minutes

114
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,582
Damn

115
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,419
You crazy people

116
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,427
What are you doing?

117
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,346
This hotel is sold

118
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,557
You have to give us severance pay, Deputy Chief Inspector

119
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,810
Think about how much mess we cleaned up.

120
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:27,561
How much?

121
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,106
How much?

122
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,317
Severance pay?

123
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:35,736
How?

124
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,155
Please let me buy you a copy of the four major insurance companies.

125
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,450
What else?

126
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,285
Don’t you need parental leave?

127
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,880
Damn

128
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,558
You bastard

129
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,688
Today is the best weather, right?

130
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:13,774
Rainy Day

131
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,404
The evidence will be destroyed

132
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,282
The ground is also easier to dig

133
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,393
(Park Yeon-jin)

134
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,729
Don't rush. Don't rush.

135
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,398
Come closer to me

136
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,028
Love makes my heart burn

137
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,572
(Video)

138
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,491
Can't stop dancing

139
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,359
Hello

140
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,334
National Science Search Presumed

141
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,712
Large and round objects

142
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:41,463
I think this is it

143
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,632
But isn't that a bit odd?

144
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,093
The evidence is here.

145
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,096
The surveillance records here are all empty

146
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,140
I heard the boss took the host away.

147
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,684
This is a bit strange

148
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,229
But how did you know to come here today?

149
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,148
Anonymous Report

150
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:15,956
Uncle Ye-sol is here

151
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,543
Ye-Sol-Uncle...

152
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,296
No, it's dad. Dad is here.

153
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,840
You think I'm your uncle?

154
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,427
I am your biological father. I will explain everything to you.

155
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,220
Dad

156
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,516
Also bought Samsung Electronics and Kakao stocks

157
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,601
Sorry

158
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,354
Yili is not here

159
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,605
She is Shimei

160
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:44,693
I heard that Ye-ryul is going to study abroad
The transfer procedures are all done.

161
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:46,654
Study abroad?

162
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,659
Ha Do-young, that bastard

163
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,285
Why are you saying it now?

164
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,792
(Ha Do-young)

165
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,629
The user you dialed is powered off

166
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,630
Damn

167
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,429
Where is the skill rate?

168
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:16,058
Where is my daughter?
Where did you hide her?

169
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,518
I've always been curious about Jaejoon

170
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,646
Who will be the last person you see?

171
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,608
It seems that it is definitely not your daughter

172
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,526
Where are you?

173
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,487
Where are you now? You bitch

174
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:34,743
Damn

175
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,249
Where is Building B here?

176
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,603
What? My eyes hurt.

177
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,814
Damn it

178
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,232
My eyes hurt

179
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,700
Do you know who she is?

180
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,912
She is Yeon-jin's mother

181
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,247
To Hong Young-ae

182
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,417
She recently hit someone with her car

183
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,836
The case was closed as a rainy day accident

184
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,964
But I looked at Hong Young-ae's cell phone records

185
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,091
It was discovered that she had been threatened by the deceased before the incident

186
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,220
“I know your daughter killed someone.”

187
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,308
Why you

188
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,226
Tell me this?

189
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,812
Because I want you to know

190
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,983
I think
You were also the one who provided that information to Lee Seok-jae

191
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,154
But I can't find the connection between you and Lee Seok-jae

192
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,615
So I checked his wife's call records.

193
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:56,658
Jiang Xiannan

194
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,452
Do you know Jiang Xiannan?

195
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,583
But Mr. Detective

196
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,252
Even if I talk too much

197
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,213
With the deceased's wife or himself

198
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,549
Said this

199
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,802
Is this illegal?

200
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,429
Driving

201
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,388
It's obviously this person

202
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,309
Not illegal

203
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,025
Na Hong Young Ae

204
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,319
What happens now?

205
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,866
I'm going to the police station to see your daughter.

206
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:38,826
You're a piece of trash

207
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,245
It's all because of your poor workmanship that things have come to this.

208
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,247
Because you can't even come up with a settlement agreement!

209
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,164
Really

210
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,835
Are you not in there, ma'am?

211
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,503
Are you really not here?

212
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,839
Hello! Are you there?

213
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,465
Feed it out!

214
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,509
Hong Young-ae

215
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,980
Hong Young-ae was just arrested

216
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,149
For murder

217
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,579
Is this the end of the game?

218
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,415
This is your plan, right?

219
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,168
You are also the one who made the anonymous report

220
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:40,804
During this period

221
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,932
Thank you

222
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:45,684
Listen to what I say

223
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:55,569
Of course

224
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,946
Even though it's 18 years late

225
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,284
The investigation ends here

226
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:05,495
Then

227
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:06,955
Take your time

228
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:11,668
Oh, right.

229
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,837
I will be very busy in the future

230
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:17,049
So I don't think I have time to take care of other things.

231
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,146
‎(Application for confirmation of intention to divorce by agreement)

232
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,549
Find a good team of lawyers.

233
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,637
The time in your life when you absolutely cannot save money

234
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:05,722
It's time to find a lawyer

235
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,270
You are so cruel

236
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,899
How can you file for divorce in person?

237
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,699
Where are you going?

238
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,828
Don't worry, I won't follow you.

239
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:31,957
United Kingdom

240
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,835
Does Ye-ryul like soccer?

241
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,464
If I write to

242
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,343
Will you transfer it to Yi-ryul?

243
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,433
Take care of your body

244
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,478
The transfer documents are all in it

245
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,731
Teacher Wen asked me to tell you

246
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,067
She said she was grateful to you

247
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,819
She wants you to drive this car

248
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,947
Go to many beautiful places

249
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:50,077
Where did Sister Dongen go?

250
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,955
She said this would be given to the person who is best at doing good deeds.

251
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,338
Whether you donate this or open a consultation center

252
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,299
She said she would support your decision.

253
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,344
She also said you must buy something delicious to eat

254
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,222
Teacher Wen Dongen

255
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:15,602
Let me tell you she is grateful to you.

256
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,604
Has Dongen left?

257
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,066
Where did you go?

258
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,684
Hello?

259
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,018
About Us

260
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,645
Do you want to go see the sea together?

261
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,525
Is your dating routine too old-fashioned?

262
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,990
If there is music you want to listen to, just play it.

263
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,867
If you feel sleepy, you can take a nap.

264
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,952
By the way, you should look at my face once in a while

265
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,165
My face looks best from the passenger seat

266
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,669
There is no music on my phone

267
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,754
Sing it

268
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,381
Wow finally

269
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,092
Don't be scared, really.

270
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,306
Five, six, seven, eight

271
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,725
A person as peaceful as moonlight

272
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,894
Who are you?

273
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,021
A person as bright as the sun

274
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,607
Who are you?

275
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:47,944
Whose love makes you

276
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:52,032
Standing here?

277
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,909
Is that the beautiful voice like a yellow oriole?

278
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,578
It's not the oriole now, okay?

279
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,954
This is the song of the Goshawk Band

280
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,873
Your exquisite eyes

281
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:06,338
Shine because of loneliness

282
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:11,426
Your little lips are lonely

283
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:15,514
And comfort me

284
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,721
No other songs?

285
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,891
Okay, that's enough.

286
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,143
-Are there no other songs?
-Sing it for a minute.

287
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,395
-Don't
- Just sing it once

288
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,688
- I don't want
- Just once

289
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,197
I bought the beer

290
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,115
Need anything else?

291
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,118
We have reached our final destination

292
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,955
This is the end

293
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,125
Take care

294
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,963
What took you so long?

295
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,926
I miss you so much

296
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:17,844
Me too

297
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:22,349
I really miss you and want to see you like this

298
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,102
No one around

299
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,856
The lonely look with no love left

300
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,069
You think

301
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,572
Will I stay here long?

302
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,115
Yes, I think you will

303
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,202
Even if you come out, you are already old.

304
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,286
You bitch

305
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,788
No. 2695

306
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,039
Be quiet

307
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,254
I hope that in the end

308
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,675
Whether I am in this world or not

309
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,345
Your world is full of me

310
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,683
I hope you live and breathe every moment

311
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:06,893
There are piercing

312
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:09,896
Feeling of being wronged

313
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:16,528
It's unfair to me

314
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,240
I could have stayed undetected

315
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:22,909
Of course I am wronged

316
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,412
However

317
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,001
I should be the one saying this.

318
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:35,463
What do you mean?

319
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,509
What am I wronged about?

320
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:55,960
Jin Jinglan

321
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,714
Are you in there?

322
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,383
Are you in there?

323
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,227
Feed Jin Jinglan

324
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,396
Damn help...

325
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:17,732
Save me

326
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,943
There is

327
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,029
Please hold my phone for me.

328
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,576
Help me you bitch

329
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:31,871
Release

330
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,498
Release

331
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,209
Don't

332
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,377
Let me go

333
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,712
Stop pretending to be young.

334
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,174
Don't you like mine?

335
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,425
Damn, I know you like it.

336
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,760
-Tell the truth
-Let go!

337
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,928
Let go!

338
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,516
Let go you bastard!

339
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,547
It's me, Jin Jinglan

340
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:26,175
Can you help me?

341
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:28,970
You said

342
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,140
The murderer must be Yeon-jin

343
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:34,767
I

344
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,270
So scared

345
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,190
Help me, Dongen

346
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:43,776
This

347
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,446
What to do?

348
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:52,118
This should be put back to its original position

349
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:53,870
Don't worry

350
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,580
The murderer is Park Yeon-jin

351
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,497
This will not change

352
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,169
Thank you

353
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:03,838
Help me

354
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:06,633
Also

355
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,010
At that time

356
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:14,974
I'm really sorry

357
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,685
Dong En

358
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,691
I'm not helping you

359
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,986
No matter where you live

360
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,114
You have to carry this weight.

361
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:31,699
Also

362
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,703
I am no longer Dong En standing in that corridor

363
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:37,956
So are you

364
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,500
Don't do it again

365
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:42,835
Standing in the gym

366
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,068
What is it?

367
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,903
Why?

368
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,406
Why should I feel wronged?

369
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,824
No. 2695!

370
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,033
The meeting ends here

371
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,251
I am also wronged

372
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,294
Look

373
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,547
God never helps me

374
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:29,674
You will be punished?

375
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,176
So what else can I do?

376
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,596
I can only hope that this prison will become your hell

377
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,142
I hope you stay clueless for the rest of your life.

378
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,228
Live slowly in this hell until you grow old

379
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,731
I can only keep praying

380
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,025
What is it?

381
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,027
What is it that I don't know?

382
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,695
-Hey, Wen Dongen!
- Come out!

383
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:54,449
You bitch, be careful or I will really kill you bitch!

384
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,869
Let go! You bitch!

385
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,121
-Let go!
- Come out!

386
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,789
Let go!

387
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,875
I'm going to kill you, bitch!

388
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,002
I'll do that myself.

389
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,506
Kill me

390
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:12,884
I'll do it myself

391
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,137
So we

392
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,347
That's it

393
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:20,850
Goodbye

394
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,316
The person I wanted to kill, my dear Yanzhen

395
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,402
Goodbye

396
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:33,863
This is

397
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:36,949
My last letter

398
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:42,038
Besides that, I have to say goodbye to everyone.

399
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:45,792
I hope you feel it too.

400
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,002
Equal to my burns

401
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,381
Pain and suffering

402
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,450
Please help me

403
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:03,661
Save me

404
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,000
Please save my son

405
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,883
I am Ruzheng's mother

406
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,181
If this is how it all ends for you

407
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,516
Then I know

408
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,353
Ru Zheng's Ending

409
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:32,982
What if this happens?

410
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,989
I have met Suxi's mother

411
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,366
So

412
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,660
I heard about your situation

413
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:46,829
I know

414
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,164
What's the matter with you?

415
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,750
How did we get to where we are today?

416
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,879
Isn't this how your ending should be?

417
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,470
When you told me that he wanted to help you get revenge

418
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,763
I allowed him so

419
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,432
Please allow me today.

420
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,226
Allow me

421
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,394
Save your life

422
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:16,484
It's fine to just hold you there and hang you there
I'd even catch you and jump down with you

423
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,653
I'm going to save you no matter what.

424
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,201
Please save my son from hell

425
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,328
Let him

426
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,581
Survive in the end

427
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,626
Please

428
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,972
Ruzheng's Hell

429
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,849
Is it Jiang Yongtian?

430
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:52,895
3724 Yes

431
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,481
His prisoner number?

432
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,361
That's right.

433
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,657
That beast

434
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:17,545
I still remember that moment clearly.

435
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,923
I remember the pungent smell of blood

436
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:25,511
The sound of a knife piercing the neck

437
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,432
The temperature of the blood flowing on my hands

438
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:32,685
Even his last moment
I also remember the gradually fading gaze

439
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,479
Dad!

440
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,357
- Bring the cart here quickly!
-Dad!

441
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,608
Dad!

442
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,570
Dad!

443
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,738
Dad?

444
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,533
Dad

445
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:51,495
Dad

446
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,831
He called dad

447
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,834
Wake up, dad, bring mom here!

448
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,463
Accused on three counts of murder

449
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:04,425
Charged with destruction of body and abandonment of body

450
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:09,221
According to the evidence investigated by this court in accordance with the law

451
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,723
Charges against the accused

452
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,684
All were found guilty

453
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:17,104
In addition, the defendant will treat him with goodwill

454
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:21,567
Victims of medical practices
Killing ungratefully

455
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,612
Causing serious consequences

456
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,281
And the means of crime are very bad.

457
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,286
Therefore this court declares

458
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,914
The verdict is as follows

459
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,959
Sentenced to death

460
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:44,131
Items involved in Chapters 1 to 3 will be confiscated

461
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,309
You bastard!

462
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:58,479
Ruzheng

463
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,898
Are you human? Bastard!

464
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,525
Do you still dare to laugh?

465
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,609
I like it very much

466
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:08,406
The last look when a person's life disappears

467
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:13,536
Because the capillaries were broken.
Causes the white of the eye to gradually turn red

468
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:14,662
Like a sunset

469
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,833
Okay, I'll write to you next time.

470
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:34,140
Have a nice weekend, Dr. Zhou Ruzheng

471
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:51,240
(Six months later)

472
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,326
(Summer 2023)

473
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:30,905
Mom

474
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:32,823
-Mom
Prisoners

475
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,576
-No talking, no talking to others!
-Mom

476
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,328
-Mom
-No. 3886 is against the wall!

477
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,412
Mom!

478
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:41,332
Mom!

479
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,919
Mom!

480
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,139
Hey beauty

481
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:58,766
What will the weather be like tomorrow?

482
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,143
Hmm?

483
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:17,368
Due to frequent showers
The temperature has been relatively cool these days.

484
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,079
But starting tomorrow, most areas

485
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,748
The daytime temperature is expected to rise to around 30 degrees

486
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,334
So I suggest you dress lightly.

487
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,378
It is best to drink more water

488
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:34,635
Although tomorrow the weather is sunny and the air is fresh

489
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,681
But the ozone concentration and UV index will be higher

490
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:43,852
During the hours of 2pm to 5pm, when ozone production is highest

491
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,108
It would be better to go out as little as possible

492
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,318
My name is Park Yeon-jin

493
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,405
Why is the weather so sad?

494
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,971
I thought you would run away within a month.

495
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,014
I didn't expect it to last this long.

496
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:21,348
Full 6 months

497
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:23,767
Yes

498
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,686
It's summer now

499
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,523
I checked those two bastards.

500
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,817
You are right, Mr. Wen.

501
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,279
I feel better now. Thank you.

502
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:37,531
However

503
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,117
I know nothing is free in this world

504
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,037
You tell me

505
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,705
What are you doing here for so long?

506
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,252
I have something to ask of you

507
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,422
There is a life sentence prisoner in Qingsong Prison

508
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:00,596
Prisoner levels are usually divided into S1 to S5

509
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,474
Those who go to Qingsong Prison are usually S4

510
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,520
I don't know who that person is.

511
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,980
He must be an arrogant and ignorant guy.

512
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:11,440
Yes

513
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,401
He killed three people, two of whom were women.

514
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:16,904
Transfer to another prison

515
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:18,697
Do you think it's possible?

516
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,579
Then we have to riot in the prison.

517
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:31,502
There is only one place wilder than Green Pine Prison

518
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,504
Dishan Prison

519
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,590
Do you think it's OK there?

520
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,268
If you need a loan, come to me.

521
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:50,521
I won't deduct interest in advance if I lend you money

522
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:51,855
Life is unpredictable

523
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:50,307
I bought a beer

524
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:06,031
How are you doing?

525
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:09,952
What did you say?

526
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,122
Where is...

527
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,253
So bad

528
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:24,925
How could you do to me...

529
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:30,931
Did you know

530
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:34,142
How I...

531
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:36,854
I miss you

532
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:46,154
Then why did you leave me again?

533
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,035
Maybe I didn't choose revenge.

534
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:53,996
Leaving you is love

535
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:07,342
I

536
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:11,680
Not having a good time

537
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:16,560
My revenge

538
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:20,731
No success

539
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,613
I think you need counseling

540
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:29,489
Do you want me to give you a tutorial?

541
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:31,658
I'll teach you how to take revenge

542
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,503
Let me be your executioner this time

543
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:47,049
Let me fill your 1%

544
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,134
Speak

545
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,595
Who do you want me to kill first?

546
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:00,312
This time you catch the black

547
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:01,521
Because this is your first time taking revenge

548
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,942
Let me help you

549
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,560
‎(Monthly rental room in Eden Apartment No. 301)

550
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,062
Sorry I couldn't say goodbye to you

551
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,356
I'm moving out

552
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,442
At that time, No. 301

553
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,529
Why is it cheaper than other rental houses nearby?

554
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:52,698
I know it all now

555
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:57,119
I remember it all

556
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,373
It took you a long time

557
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,876
I recognized you the moment I saw you.

558
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:11,485
Are you okay with being barefoot?

559
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,989
Oh my god, why are you wearing a sweater?

560
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:17,991
This will be heavy when wet.

561
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:21,161
Isn't this all because of you?

562
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,996
Yo, look at what you said

563
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:24,873
Why do you blame me?

564
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:28,502
I just saw you taking off your shoes there too.

565
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,088
But the children

566
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,006
The water is too cold

567
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:34,883
Right?

568
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,343
Oh my god, it's so cold

569
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:39,179
About Us

570
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:41,681
Wait until spring comes before dying

571
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,433
How?

572
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:44,351
Spring

573
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,494
It doesn't matter

574
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,921
I used to think

575
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:16,466
If someone or something else

576
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,678
Help me what the result will be

577
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:24,266
After that

578
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,144
After 18 springs

579
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,355
Now I finally understand

580
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:35,318
I have also had kind-hearted adults around me.

581
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:40,240
Friends, weather, God's intervention have all happened

582
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,493
She is the top scorer in the entrance exam?

583
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,453
She's not even a professional in this field.

584
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,081
But did you see her arms?

585
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:55,672
Also

586
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,049
I finally understand why you said you wanted to die in the spring.

587
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,428
Actually, it means blooming in spring.

588
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,931
Thank you for saving my life

589
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:07,809
I'm really grateful

590
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,396
I failed to be a bright person

591
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:13,690
But one day

592
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,067
In a spring

593
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,486
I will bloom brilliantly

594
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:22,324
Wish you good health and longevity

595
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:25,577
Don't know

596
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,496
Will she come to see the flowers suddenly one day?

597
00:53:57,442 --> 00:54:00,070
(Medical Officer Zhou Ruzheng of Dishan Prison)

598
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:03,740
You really are

599
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,367
Are you a part-time tutor again?

600
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,493
Of course

601
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:08,620
Revenge requires a lot of money.

602
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,373
I'll help him circle the area and then come to help you

603
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,919
Then you will come home late every day

604
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,964
To avoid being late every day
I chose Monday, Wednesday and Friday for classes.

605
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:22,884
The student's father is a policy officer at the Correctional Services Department.

606
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:28,807
It is important to circle the scope of the exam

607
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,311
Oh, right.

608
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,314
Where did Jeon Jae-joon go?

609
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:39,025
This

610
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,612
Someone who wants revenge on Jeon Jae-joon

611
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,198
It seems I'm not the only one

612
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:05,010
Who are you?

613
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:07,595
What is this place?

614
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,682
Who the hell are you? You bastard

615
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:12,434
Sorry

616
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:16,438
My eyes hurt now

617
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:18,940
I have to go to the hospital to see a doctor

618
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,941
Damn

619
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:23,445
Your mother is Choi Hui-jung, right?

620
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,613
Or did she send you?

621
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:28,658
Excuse me, could you please answer me?

622
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,746
Who are you? Huh?

623
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,915
Why are you doing this? You bastard

624
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:31,763
Black card mobile phone and black registration vehicle

625
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:33,932
The number is on the back of the phone

626
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:35,892
The car is in the underground parking lot

627
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:38,520
Good luck

628
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,074
What do you need?

629
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,868
This fern costs one pound

630
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:55,787
Half a pound of water chestnut is enough

631
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:56,788
Good

632
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:57,872
Mom

633
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,086
Let's go eat

634
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,421
I'll go home and make you something delicious

635
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:05,338
What would you like to eat?

636
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,672
(Shan Yajia small vegetable shop)

637
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:15,492
We are looking for a nanny. If you are interested, please contact us.

Please give us a
Volunteer teacher for discussion class came on stage

640
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:38,199
(Those scheduled to be released from Dishan Prison
Book Discussion Course)

641
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,117
Nice to meet you all

642
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,996
The word "discussion" sounds more serious.

643
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,289
But this course

644
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:47,500
Designed for those who are about to be released from prison

645
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:52,171
So you can think of it as a
Reading club where people read and talk together

646
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:54,507
If anyone is interested

647
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:57,260
We can also practice writing resumes and self-introductions

648
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,643
I just

649
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,812
Met with my sister

650
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:11,274
She looked at me and smiled

651
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,692
She used to cry

652
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,112
This is all thanks to you

653
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,699
Thank you so much, sir.

654
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,786
How many laser treatments are needed?

655
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,830
But now she can basically cover it up with makeup alone

656
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:29,792
Don't forget to take your blood pressure medication

657
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:34,005
I can't die before that stalker bastard.

658
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:38,676
You're in here for special atrocity crimes, right?

659
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,095
So that's how it is

660
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:42,013
Yes

661
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:46,726
I really regret not killing that bastard.

662
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:48,645
You've seen her so you should know

663
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,563
That's what that bastard did.

664
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:52,607
Make her face like that

665
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,652
Because she refused to see him

666
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:58,905
Don't worry about your sister.

667
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,282
I am quite capable outside.

668
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:02,533
Oh that's too...

669
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:05,161
Thank you so much

670
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:08,831
I heard scar removal treatment

671
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:11,542
It's quite expensive to do it once

672
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,170
Once I get out of jail

673
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:17,131
It doesn't matter if you do hard labor or anything else.

674
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:18,466
I will definitely pay you back for your treatment

675
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:20,843
Doctor

676
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:22,345
I'm serious

677
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,349
Are you helping out in the first building?

678
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:31,729
Can you not use money?
And use something else to pay for the treatment?

679
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:36,859
That way

680
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:40,238
Am I not taking advantage?

681
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:42,323
To me, that is worth a thousand gold

682
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,674
Do you want to punish me?

683
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:54,228
Yes

684
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,399
What a shame I'm already being punished

685
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:05,448
It's not enough

686
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,327
What is enough?

687
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:15,333
I have to kill you.

688
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,127
But you can't die in peace

689
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,713
You are a doctor

690
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:24,884
You can't cross that line, can't you?

691
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,348
Although I don't have a high degree of education, I still know

692
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:34,143
You have to fulfill a certain oath

693
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:47,031
You are wrong

694
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:51,536
If I wanted to save animals, I would be a veterinarian.

695
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:54,622
If I wanted to save the devil, I would become a priest.

696
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:57,875
I only save humans

697
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:00,169
That oath

698
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:04,048
Only need to be performed when saving humans

699
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:12,682
If we meet again someday

700
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,601
You have to be careful

701
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:19,146
People who walk by you

702
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:21,607
The rice in front of you

703
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:23,609
The medicine you take

704
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:27,697
Whatever it is, be careful.

705
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,328
Can doctors do that?

706
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:38,040
You don't have to worry

707
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:40,793
I won't be discovered

708
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,129
Because I am a doctor

709
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:19,123
(Yin Suxi)

710
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:23,294
Time finally began to pass

711
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:25,463
Congratulations

712
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:27,214
Congratulations to you and me

713
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:29,091
Celebrating 19 years old

714

(Dishan Prison)

715
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:31,904
I love you

716
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:38,494
I love you
