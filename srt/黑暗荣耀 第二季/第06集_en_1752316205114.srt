An unidentified body was found

5
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:39,641
Need to rush to the scene

6
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,101

7
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:05,375

8
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,669
Where is it?

Your key to Hawaii

10
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,511
I clearly put it here with my own hands...

11
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,470
Wait a minute

12
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,349
The number you dialed is unavailable...

13
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,767

What's up?

16
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,486
I just received a call from Aunt Sun Mingwu

17
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,530
She said Sun Mingwu is dead

18
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,782
His body was found last night.

19
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,953
You have a really wide social circle.

20
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,831
Are you still in touch with his aunt?

21
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,749
Shouldn't I keep in touch with you?

22
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:47,667
Hey

23
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,419
What you said before makes sense

24
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,462
Can friendship alone make us friends?

25
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,008
You have no idea how well I know you

26

28
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:01,723

32
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,781
Why sell it when the business is going well?

33
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:19,741
Sell it

34
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,327
It's okay to sell it at a low price

35
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,912
You should go find a real estate agent tomorrow.

36
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,330

37

Come on, where have you been?

38
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:48,895
Have you had lunch?

39
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,314
I saw that the room was almost full last night.

40
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,942
We went to eat instant noodles

41
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,277
Really? Why do you guys always eat instant noodles?

42
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,906
Come and order some soup later

43
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,241
Give

44
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,201
Wow boss you are the best

45
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,162
Are you still working for Yeon-jin?

46
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,790
Yes, you can earn some pocket money

47
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,667

51

How often do you drink?

52
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,403
What kind of wine are you drinking?

53
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,574
I never drink alcohol. I can't even drink a glass of wine.

54
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,286
Just ask my daughter.

55
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:32,957

You were diagnosed with alcohol dependence six years ago

57
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,671
You mean
Have you not had a drink since?

58
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,341
Well, at that time

59
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,968
Just had a drink

60
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,095
Actually, it's not even one cup, just half a cup.

61
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,638
I didn't drink the whole half cup at once.

62
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,142
How much do you usually drink each time?

63
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,310
How many bottles?

64
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,563
I said I don't drink!

65
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,357
What do you, a rookie doctor, know?

66
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,820
I wonder why you brought me here.

What fire are you setting?

72
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,916
The floor is just a little bit burnt.

73
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,376
That was done accidentally.

74
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,044

No compensation required

Can't you see that I've lost weight worrying about you?

137
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,098
When should I go to the police station again?

138
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,934

-What?
-Are you deaf like your mother?

161
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,419
I told you to take it off, don't talk back to me

-I'm really sorry

00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:13,691
It's her mother

189
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,737
The deceased's name is Yin Suxi

190
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,241
Heard

191
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,035
The body is still in the morgue

192
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,414
Which hospital?

193
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,041
Are you going to remove the body?

194
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:32,752
If not

195
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:34,795
So you wanna help me?

196
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,259
In Seoul Chow Hospital

197
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:46,390
This is the information of the person you asked me to check last time.

198
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,225
The information is inside

199
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,313
Seoul Zhou Hospital is owned by their family

200
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,276
- Really?
-Yes

201
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,909
(10th anniversary, the family of three became colleagues in the hospital)

202
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,790
Why do you protect Yilu?

203
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,629
To make Yeon-jin suffer
Art rate should be the fastest and most effective way

204
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,424
But the path of Yilu

205
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,551
It will also make you suffer.

206
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,683
After this revenge is over

207
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,479
Will you become happy?

208
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,196
I hope so.

209
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,784
Can become happy to death

210
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,246
That's enough

211
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,791
I just hope to be happy to that extent.

212
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,886
Damn you, you're so rude.

213
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,806
(To Ha Do-young: Let's meet)

214
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,432
We have to meet

215
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,600
I have something important to say

216
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,149
Did you get a call from Whiting?

217
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:22,570
She said Sun Mingwu

218
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,197
Dead

219
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,324
Oh

220
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,035
You should know that you live together.

221
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:34,540
I heard

222
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,839
I guess the police, apart from his family,
The first person you should contact is you

223
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,549
You are his employer after all.

224
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:46,927
What do the police say?

225
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,598
Cause of death etc.

226
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,600
Did they tell you?

227
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,102
It is said

228
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,733
They told me
Where was Sun Mingwu's body found?

229
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,485
Where was it found?

230
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,197
The abandoned building
The place where Yoon So-hee fell

231
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,623
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Yeonjin.

232
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,416
I threw away that clothing.

233
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,422
Okay

234
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,090
Really?

235
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,593
Thank you so much, Yeonjin

236
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,681
You should thank me, what else?

237
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,856
I will never appear in front of you again

238
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,235
That's as it should be. What else?

239
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,655
I just knew it

240
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,824
-You are just trying to fool me
-No

241
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,785
I'm really sorry, Yeonjin.

242
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,203
Is that so?

243
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,997
Then it's not too late to take off your clothes.

244
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,418
But the problem is

245
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,757
I recently bought a very expensive ear file

246
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,594
Is it you? The last person Mingwu saw?

247
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:11,929
And in the afternoon

248
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,185
Did that bastard really record it that day?

249
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,941
Oh, this is it.

250
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,360
What Choi Hui-jung Knows

251
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:29,947
What is the content?

252
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,783
A bit shocked

253
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,122
Damn Yeonjin!

254
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,707
So what are you going to do?

255
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,543
I am Ye-sol's mother

256
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,044
Your daughter Ye-sol's mother

257
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,422
Now that you know what to do?

258
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,300
You have to save me

259
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,262
You have to save me and Ye-ryul

260
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,597
You are the only one we can rely on.

261
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,475
You need to tell me clearly

262
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,687
What did you do to Sun Mingwu?

263
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:04,565
That was an accident

264
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,277
I obviously handled it afterwards.
I don't know why it became like this.

265
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,319
This is definitely

266
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,238
Wen Dongen did it

267
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,075
There is a doctor helping her
He is the son of the director of Seoul Zhou Hospital

268
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,870
Whose body is there?

269
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:19,621
Zhou Hospital?

270
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,790
I'm in big trouble now

271
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,001
I'll take Ye-ryul to your place.

272
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,211
We will come back to you, Jaejun, okay?

273
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,714
We can't let Ye-sol become the daughter of a murderer, right?

274
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,340
So I said

275
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,511
I was with you that day

276
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,305
Right?

277
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,144
So

278
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,732
Then we must have watched a pornographic movie again

279
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,485
Right?

280
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,592
Ji Hyun

281
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,095
-What about Yi-ryul?
-That

282
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,013
Your friend is here

283
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,351
Wow, you draw really well.

284
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,477
Do you want to be my apprentice?

285
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,899
Ye-ryul Do you like the feeling of floating?

286
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:33,862
Come with me

287
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,490
Hey, why are you so excited?

288
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,908
I mean "beautiful"

289
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,327
Yi-lu, we agreed on this, right?

290
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,328
Goodbye

291
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,291
You crazy bitch

292
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,127
Fuck

293
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,170
Others will think you are a good mother.

294
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,090
It seems you have hired a lot of lawyers.
How come it came out so quickly?

295
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,259
Look, you did it.

296
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,262
I said that because I care about you. You should be careful.

297
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,472
You are no longer a first-time offender.

298
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,766
Look, I know it's you

299
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:08,105
Report on my exhibition
Written by that idiot who praised you so much before

300
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,650
Dowon Daily reporter Kang Hyung-jin

301
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:12,985
What nonsense are you talking about?

302
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,987
There is no logic at all

303
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,530
The day your school violence was exposed

304
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,408
An ordinary person was live-broadcasted taking drugs
Does this make sense?

305
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,536
You actually exposed me to cover up your own scandal

306
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,873
It was you who exposed the tax evasion, right?

307
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,257
Thank you for letting me know

308
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,343
I just lost two friends.

309
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,943
The real body is placed here

310
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,570
Why would I come here to lie to you?

311
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,030
That’s enough!

312
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,741
You'll handle it, right?

313
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,703
Hello

314
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,165
What are you looking at? What?

315
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,750
What are you looking at?

316
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,629
Seriously, I won't die alone, you bitch.

317
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,057
(News)

318
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:26,600
Where are you?

319
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:29,978
I'll wait for you outside

320
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,355
Where are you?

321
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:35,943
A far place

322
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,071
How far?

323
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,367
Do you want me to give you a ride?

324
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,092
You got the wrong person

325
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,802
I already have someone I like

326
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,478
Today's goal is 2 kilometers left.

327
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,231
I feel relieved when I see you. You go first and I'll run back.

328
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,779
Do you run like this often?

329
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,531
You take good care of your body

330
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,825
I said I already have someone I like

331
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,410
Maybe it's because you're a doctor.

332
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,495
No matter what you do, physical strength is the key to success

333
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,038
Who are you competing against?

334
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,707
I said you got the wrong person

335
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,458
I really have someone I like.

336
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,876
She is very beautiful

337
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,713
If you don't get in the car, I'll leave.

338
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,506
I know you won't leave

339
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,632
You're just talking

340
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,720
Hey, Dongen, Junior

341
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,721
Wait!

342
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,931
Owner of car No. 4225

343
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:49,725
Wen Dongen

344
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,149
Oh my god

345
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,416
This is too sudden

346
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,375
Why are you hugging me?

347
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,212
Because I miss you so much

348
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,799
Did you just miss me?

349
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,928
That was a long time ago.

350
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,643
You run over here like this
What's the point of me being vigilant alone?

351
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,228
Why are you wary of me?

352
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,357
Because you are a very considerate lunatic

353
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,861
Oh yeah

354
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,947
You knew me before
The landlady of Eden Apartment?

355
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,325
- Me?
-Yes

356
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,495
She said you were her savior.

357
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:54,998
It shouldn't be me

358
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,708
I don't have the spare time to save others

359
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,335
I don't live that kindly.

360
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,128
I can see that

361
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:01,922
Weird, right?

362
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,007
The "considerate" part has to go.

363
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,051
You are so strict.

364
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:10,305
See you later. I still have 1 kilometer left.

365
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,236
You mean

366
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,030
After a person has been missing for a period of time
When he was found, he was already a corpse.

367
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,032
You can answer with "yes or no"

368
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,700
Would an autopsy be performed in this case?

369
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,579
If there is no evidence to prove the cause of death was suicide or accident

370
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,747
An autopsy is mandatory

371
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,457
Will it be done even if the family members object?

372
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,419
Even if three generations of the family are against it?

373
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,336
Even so

374
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,088
If the case is suspected of homicide

375
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,090
You can apply for a warrant to compel an autopsy

376
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,342
They will definitely do an autopsy, right?

377
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,303
It seems there is no way to stop this

378
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,265
Don't scare me.

379
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,643
You used to ask about tax evasion.
Why do you keep asking about criminal law recently?

380
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,563
Okay, I'll cut off contact with my mother.

381
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,232
I'm leaving. I'll have a meeting.

382
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,900
Hey, where are you going?

383
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,944
Why did you break up with your mother?

384
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,906
Please sit down. This is a long story.

385
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,451
Would you like a drink too?

386
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,453
Just tell me the point.

387
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,288
Are you the type who would rather be spanked early?

388
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,541
This means you haven't been beaten.

389
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,377
Also

390
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:26,131
That was the first time I was beaten.
So I don't know how to fight back.

391
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,048
Key Points

392
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,550
Get straight to the point

393
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,303
You almost made me swear when you interrupted me

394
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,472
Okay then

395
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:35,515
Did you know

396
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:38,059
This is a very special place for Yeonjin, right?

397
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,519
Don't cross the line

398
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,569
October 19

399
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,321
Sun Mingwu recorded this with his cell phone

400
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,573
Take it and listen to it

401
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,074
Sun Mingwu You Know

402
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:54,868
You also looked for him

403
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,371
This is where that bastard was last seen

404
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,415
The last person to see him here was Yeonjin

405
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,918
That's what I meant

406
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,339
Oh, there is something more important.

407
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:11,176
I just discovered that today.

408
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,012
Originally here

409
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:19,935
It feels good to hold a bottle of expensive wine.

410
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,230
But the bottle just happened to be missing.

411
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,275
Could you please ask Yeon-jin where the bottle is now?

412
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:33,240
You can start like this
"Yeonjin's murder is very costly."

413
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:44,876
So you're saying

414
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:45,961
To me,

415
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,173
Yeonjin is a murderer

416
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:56,763
Don't talk nonsense

417
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:58,431
What do you want from me?

418
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,226
Do you want me to call the police?

419
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,394
You seem crazy

420
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,896
If I wanted to call the police, I would have done it long ago.

421
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,315
What we need to do is to be accomplices instead of calling the police

422
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,527
I won't give this to the police.

423
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,280
So you give up parental rights after the divorce.

424
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,322
That's it.

425
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,578
Neither you nor I want
Let the child's mother become a murderer?

426
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,372
No matter what Ye-Sul's last name is

427
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,669
You are

428
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,548
Are you using Yi-ra to threaten me?

429
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,719
A long time ago

430
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,639
I provided Yeon-jin with an alibi

431
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:43,226
What she said
The classmate who went to the rooftop with her died

432
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,646
But

433
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,067
October 19
Another person died while with her.

434
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,407
How do you want to solve this?

435
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,410
You're testifying for her this time?

436
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,204
Are you giving Yeon-jin an alibi?

437
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,306
Husband

438
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,558
What happened?

439
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,560
Get on the bus quickly or you'll be late

440
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,357
You go to Zhimin's house and I'll be there soon.

441
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,650
Call me when you arrive

442
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:45,205
(Hong Young-ae)

443
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,207
Hello?

444
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,124
Let's meet today

445
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,627
After all, we have been friends for 40 years.

446
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,004
We have to say goodbye face to face.

447
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,506
What time did you say?

448
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,059
(Park Yeon-jin)

449
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:31,918
Hello?

450
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,629
I'm calling because
What the lady of Pyeongchang-dong told me

451
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,631
I'll send you the address and we'll meet there.

452
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,639
Am I dreaming?

453
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:49,060
Dinner is almost ready. Just wait for the soup to boil.

454
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,521
It's damn Qingguo sauce every day

455
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,814
Aren't you tired of it?

456
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,650
Eat more yourself.

457
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,069
Oh, and that one

458
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,655
I may not be able to go home in the next few days

459
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,408
Don't call me, okay?

460
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,593
Where did you say you were?

461
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,802
Opposite?

462
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:26,598
Just come up a little bit and then come through.

463
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,309
-The bag is heavy, please hurry up.
- Go up there?

464
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,228
OK, I'll come right away.

465
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:41,196
Where are we going?
You have to at least tell me where to go.

466
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,280
Coming Soon

467
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:43,740
Where are we almost there?

468
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,283
You used to be very simple

469
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,035
Give you money and you will leave

470
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,579
But it seems I am your last customer

471
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,749
What are you talking about suddenly?

472
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,751
Can a suspended sentence be given for manslaughter?

473
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,462
And it would be more helpful if there were eyewitnesses, right?

474
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,233
How do you drive?

475
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,030
Damn

476
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,174
Is he dead?

477
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:45,844
Are you sure he's dead?

478
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,262
Damn

479
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,393
Hey this guy

480
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:55,436
You wouldn't be...

481
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,396
There was a car accident

482
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,565
I hit a person crossing the road

483
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,524
Please come quickly

484
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,483
Damn

485
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,570
Are you crazy?

486
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,529
Why did you call the police?

487
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,072
I didn't drink and drive

488
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,574
Also obeyed the speed limit

489
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,868
The visibility is poor because of the rain

490
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,830
You handle this matter. Obviously you are an eyewitness.

491
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:16,416
What?

492
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,002
You think I'm an idiot?

493
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:22,005
You teamed up with that bastard to threaten me.
Do you think I don't know?

494
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,464
What nonsense are you talking about?

495
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,549
What am I colluding with him for?

496
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,342
How would he know if you didn't tell him?

497
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:28,303
Who else besides you knows what happened so many years ago?

498
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,306
How should I know? It's not me!

499
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,349
Damn, I didn't expect you to be this crazy.

500
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,351
Stop talking nonsense

501
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,644
You can't get away

502
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,522
Whether it's you or not, you have to deal with it.

503
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,733
The evidence that proves we are accomplices

504
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,234
I haven't destroyed it yet

505
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:44,861
Yeonjin's brand

506
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,405
Fuck you

507
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,536
You're really fucking crazy

508
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,414
Ying Ai is more disadvantageous to you than mine

509
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,125
Are you turning yourself in as the murderer of your daughter?

510
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,793
I am a housewife

511
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:03,212
What can we do?
Get the evidence received by the police?

512
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,882
The evidence is still in the bag.

513
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,218
The whistleblower, the deceased, Yeon-jin, you or me

514
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,598
At least one of them will have his or her genes tested.

515
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,186
I'm really going crazy

516
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,354
Damn

517
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:22,148
What are you doing, crazy woman?

518
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:27,195
I want to take advantage of you before you run away.

519
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:28,947
I

520
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,699
No matter what, I will stick with you

521
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,368
So you have to deal with this

522
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:34,953
The two of us

523
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,163
Either die together or live together

524
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,040
It can only be this handsome

525
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:57,976
Light candles in the temple

526
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,227
Then kill the chicken and bleed it

527
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,144
Yes

528
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:01,729
However

529
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,481
Did she come with you?

530
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,399
Hmm?

531
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,280
Oh my god, I got scared.

532
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:15,451
We are closed today and it is so late

533
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,661
You go back

534
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,579
So you only work on the side today?

535
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,376
Is it because she is Yeon-jin's mother?

536
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,294
You agreed to her without hesitation.

537
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,090
Boom!

538
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,677
You

539
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,012
Who is it?

540
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:07,962
Wow

541
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,090
I didn't expect that I would be
Seeing you again in such an unexpected place

542
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,052
Why didn't you even turn on the light?

543
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,847
What are you doing in a place like this?

544
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,600
I think you're weirder

545
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,895
It seems you came here without knowing it clearly.

546
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,646
And this is the second time

547
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,358
I am the owner of this building

548
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,654
Impossible

549
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,951
I was just looking for the restroom

550
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,871
I was so scared that I couldn't find any other excuses.

551
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,602
(Closed and no entry or exit allowed)

552
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,736
Open the door

553
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,907
Because there are always outsiders coming in and out...

554
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,242
Today too

555
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,244
It seems this is all intentional

556
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,128
What did you do to me that day?

557
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,131
That day when I was doing sleep anesthesia

558
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,715
What did you do to me?

559
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:36,676
Treatment

560
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,262
Your jawline is definitely more defined.

561
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,346
You have become more beautiful

562
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,891
I don't know what she told you

563
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,853
But don't get involved before you understand the situation.

564
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,482
Did you know I also do skin care?

565
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,318
I can tell by the scars

566
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,904
What kind of pain did the perpetrator want to cause?

567
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,449
It's just a devil

568
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,415
You were just looking for something

569
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,251
Are you looking for this?

570
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:11,836
You take it.

571
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,547
I don't need anything more

572
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:17,967
You can open the door yourself

573
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:19,886
The chain is used to deceive you

574
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,387
Not really locked

575
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,056
I won't charge you for parking.

576
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,185
I think this should be your last luck

577
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,188
Drive carefully

578
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,356
Today's weather

579
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,151
It is easy to hit people crossing the road

580
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,966
(News)

581
00:36:58,966 --> 00:36:59,926
(Mom)

582
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,761
I'm at the police station, come pick me up.

583
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,223
It rained so hard

584
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,141
That person suddenly rushed out of the road again

585
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,604
Alcohol test was done on site

586
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,105
The result is normal, you know that

587
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,359
That person crossed the road without any serious fault.

588
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,487
No criminal record, no hit-and-run

589
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,489
Isn't this the end?

590
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,493
Yes, we fully understand the situation.

591
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,536
The problem is that there are no surveillance cameras on site.

592
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,332
So we're on the phone with the family of the deceased.

593
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:34,418
The driver needs to wait.

594
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,588
Deputy Chief Inspector, you can go home now

595
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,715
Thank you for your hard work.

596
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:42,927
Don't worry too much

597
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,012
Manslaughter

598
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,764
The most important thing is to reach a settlement with the family of the deceased

599
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:47,682
You tell them nicely

600
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,350
Got it

601
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:51,978
Thank you, Deputy Chief of Police

602
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,064
Okay, let's contact each other later.

603
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,441
Thank you for your hard work

604
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,609
Goodbye

605
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,528
Because it rains

606
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,613
So I didn't see him

607
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,117
I'm really sorry.

608
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:09,370
I'm really sorry.

609
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,541
You don't have to apologize to me

610
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,836
-No, I'm really sorry.
-Please calm down

611
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,380
We found Sun Mingwu's body

612
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,048
Have you heard?

613
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:23,509
No

614
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,510
Where was it found?

615
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,762
You don't look surprised

616
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,806
Have you met Park Yeon-jin?

617
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:30,933
Or

618
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,810
Do you think I'm suspicious?

619
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,523
I have read Sun Mingwu's email

620
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,192
He investigated Yoon So-hee's case

621
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,778
The person who gave him the information

622
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,323
It's you

623
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,450
Is it illegal to do so?

624
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,661
There are many people who are worse than me.

625
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,496
It's so sad

626
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:54,957
What is going on?

627
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,252
What happened between you?

628
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:01,005
I've told you everything.

629
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,799
Even though you don't believe me

630
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,302
Is everything you said true?

631
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:14,352
(Winter 2004)

632
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,704
Do you smoke?

633
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,999
On the list of evidence in the Suxi case

634
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,794
There was a lighter found at the scene

635
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:41,462
Lighter

636
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,173
Click to open

637
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,176
Won't it leave DNA or something like that?

638
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:57,978
Mom

639
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,939
Did you drive here?

640
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,273
I'm going to the wizard.

641
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,817
What are you going there for now?

642
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,193
What happened?

643
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,945
I feel more at ease going there

644
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,322
I think it's better to go there than to see a psychiatrist.

645
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,451
Do you have contact information for the deceased's family?

646
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,869
You don't have to worry about that.

647
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,246
I can do it myself

648
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,706
You said someone died, how can I just ignore it?

649
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,918
This is a great opportunity for journalists to attack us.

650
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:21,836
Park Yeon-jin

651
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,796
Mom told you before

652
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,340
Everyone makes mistakes anyway.

653
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,092
The solution to the problem is not behind

654
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,093
It is always in front

655
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,429
Someone died yesterday.

656
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,848
Today we are going to do what we are going to do today

657
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:35,433
What are you talking about?

658
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:49,613
If

659
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:51,657
That person has the original document

660
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,326
Then you have to make a decision quickly.

661
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,997
If he broke the news first

662
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,332
We will be hit hard here.

663
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,717
Please help me take a look
Which small town in the UK or Ireland is suitable for sending Yilu?

664
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,803
A guardian will go with her.

665
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,976
It's snowing heavily

666
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,315
Be careful

667
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,276
Hello Mr. He, you too

668
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,814
(Kim Jin-hoon: The interview date has been decided)

669
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,514
What about wizards?

670
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,683
A big shaman dance ceremony is about to take place

671
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,684
She's preparing for that

672
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:03,789
Hello?

673
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,458
I don't know whether I should report this to you.

674
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,377
Kang Hyun-nam's husband

675
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:10,337
I heard he died yesterday.

676
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,840
He was hit while crossing the road

677
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,855
Is this your husband?

678
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:33,611
Are you okay?

679
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:35,404
I'm fine

680
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:38,282
This person

681
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:40,659
It's my husband

682
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,063
Yeonjin

683
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:52,981
Long time no see

684
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:54,817
How are you doing?

685
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,070
Yeonjin

686
00:44:58,612 --> 00:44:59,446
It's me, Suxi

687
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,281
The transfer student Suxi

688
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:02,866
Do you remember me?

689
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,661
What are you doing?

690
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,789
Do you want me to take this dress off?

691
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:10,582
Shall I take it off for you?

692
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,251
I want this clothes

693
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:14,378
Should I take it off for you?

694
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:15,963
What are you doing?

695
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:18,924
What the hell are you doing?

696
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,566
Then it's not too late to take off your clothes.

697
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:39,153
Yeonjin, please
I didn't wear the same clothes as you this time.

698
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,821
I don't care what you wear

699
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,865
I'm talking to you guys

700
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:45,117
Why don't you listen to me when I speak nicely?

701
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:54,710
Are you wearing clothes or a fur ball?

702
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,171
One minute

703
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,173
It's the limit of my patience

704
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:10,559
I told you to take off your clothes

705
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:12,644
Stop this, please.

706
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,649
I'm not afraid of you now

707
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,155
You are nothing

708
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:27,534
What the fuck are you talking about?

709
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:28,952
Are you filming "Romantic Youth Time"?

710
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,913
I used to be afraid of your money

711
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:34,708
Think about it, you are pitiful enough

712
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,213
So I will forgive you

713
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,841
Because I am better than you

714
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:46,804
Wow

715
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,766
I suddenly became a pitiful

716
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,311
And he is not as good as you.

717
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:57,189
Damn, you're scolding me so much at once?

718
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,193
Is that so?

719
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:02,611
That

720
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,240
I am a poor person
Can I help you sort out the hair balls?

721
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,662
Didn't you say you are better than me?

722
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,581
So you have to dress appropriately.

723
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:17,209
What are you doing?

724
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:18,877
If you move

725
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,505
I will go to your school to see you tomorrow

726
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,308
You keep jumping around.

727
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:36,770
Help me

728
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:40,858
You go away

729
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,446
(Withdrawal Application Form)

730
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:33,660
Mom

731
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:35,704
Mom, what should I do now?

732
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:37,331
What should I do now? Mom

733
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,499
Really, what on earth do you want to do?

734
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:41,793
Why didn't you go to cram school today?

735
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:44,463
Mom, I seem to be in trouble.

736
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:49,301
We were playing on the roof and accidentally caught fire

737
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:53,096
There is a transfer student

738
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:57,434
She was jumping around and accidentally fell down.

739
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,227
It's true

740
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,148
I just met her for a while.

741
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:06,443
Mom

742
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,321
Mom, what should I do now?

743
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:10,864
Hmm?

744
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:11,782
Hello?

745
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:15,160
Hello? Mom

746
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,745
Wake up, Park Yeon-jin

747
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:17,996
First, stay away from that place

748
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,457
Uncle Shen will call you

749
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,209
Don't cry and answer the phone carefully

750
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,544
Were there any witnesses? Did anyone see it?

751
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:25,462
No

752
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,215
-It seems not
-You have to be sure

753
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,884
- Look around
-No, I'm sure there isn't

754
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,558
(Evidence)

755
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:43,397
They didn't seem to do a DNA test at the time.

756
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:47,359
The report said the lighter was used by the deceased.

757
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,069
Where are you going?

758
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:50,737
Guokesou, please sort those out first before you come back

759
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:18,385
