Hey

She will watch and handle the surveillance video herself

6
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,110
All you have to do is clean up the traces at the scene.

00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,254
He scratched my instep

13
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,674
Don't worry, we're helping you with this.

14
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,301
How are you going to deal with it?

15
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:21,928
Gotta bury him.

16
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,222
This is the safest way

17
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:25,682
I'll call you back

18
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,481
It's almost dawn. Do you want to bury it now?

19
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,400
Anyway, it's not possible today.

20
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,903
Bury it on a rainy day so the evidence will be contaminated

21
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:44,742
Hello

22
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:48,830
Wait a minute, don't move.

Are you awake? Ms. Park Yeon-jin

25
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:31,039
You seem to have a nightmare. You can lie down for a while before leaving.

26
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,081
Who are you?

27
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,167
What did you do to me?

28
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,336
Where is the surveillance video?

29
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,005
-Be careful, are you okay?
-Let go!

30
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,175
Show me the surveillance video
What did you do to me when I fell asleep?

31
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,426
Show me the video!

I think the anesthetic hasn't completely worn off yet.
So you might still be a little confused.

34
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,561
Could you tell me where exactly you feel uncomfortable?

35
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,398
Her blood pressure and pulse are obviously normal.

36
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:00,068
Wait, you can't drive now.

38
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,821
I had a lot of questions before coming here.

39
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,491
But now all that is meaningless.

40
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,828
Does it still hurt?

41
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,414
It's not important

42
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,042
That leisurely greeting is not important

43
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,878
Even if your questions become meaningless

44
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,714
You should at least ask me this question, right?

45
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,759
"Was that done by Yeon-jin?"

46
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,726
Have you looked for Sun Mingwu?

47
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,061
I also sent you a photo

48
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,526
Is there anything more I need to know?

49
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,486
I think you know enough

50
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,405
It should be enough to make you want to leave Yeon-jin.

51
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,283
I hope

52
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,412
In the end, there was no one around Yeon-jin

53
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,038
Especially my husband

54
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,374
Why?

55
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,794
Because I think you are Yeonjin's glory

56
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,881
I am hope

57
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,134
You become Yeonjin's ruins

58
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,764
If that's your plan

59
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,018
I think you're not proactive enough.

60
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,480
And your method is not cruel enough

61
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,530
I won't leave Yeonjin

62
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,826
Why?

63
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:15,995
How to say it?

64
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,373
I don't like to say I don't know

65
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,626
But I really don't know

66
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,216
I just realized that I don't want to leave Yeon-jin

67
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,054
So

68
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,017
See you another day.

69
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,125
Can you sleep a little longer? Another 20 minutes?

70
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,924
I haven't had dinner yet

71
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,676
I'll call you after I finish eating.

72
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,427
I'm awake

73
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,721
The cooking smells so good

74
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,849
Is there a share for me too?

75
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,685
More than

76
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,271
By the way, Park Yeon-jin came for the injection.

77
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,314
I also met Ha Do Young

78
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,400
Let me help you

79
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,570
Although I am not a good cook, I am good at chores.

80
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,123
This is hot

81
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,000
Very dangerous

82
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,336
My scars

83
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,047
It seems that others feel worse than I do.

84
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,675
It's not like that

85
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,886
"Why are you dressed so nicely to meet Ha Do-young?

86
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,097
Just wear sportswear."

87
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,807
My expression means this

88
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,519
I felt very cold at that time

89
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,939
Call me when the meal is ready

90
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,482
I fell asleep without washing my face.

91
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,111
Let me treat you

92
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,162
From the part closest to the wrist

93
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,789
Start with the wound closest to the ankle

94
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,084
No need

95
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,252
Necessary

96
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,549
Treating Wounds
Need to make a deeper cut on the wound

97
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,509
This is how new skin grows

98
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,554
Let me cut your wound.

99
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,183
Although it is impossible to restore it to its original state

100
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,268
But it can be very close

101
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,065
No need

102
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,567
It's okay to keep it

103

Student Li Shanya successfully completed the embassy interview

104
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,003
The rest is to pay the study abroad agency fee

105
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,173
When buying air tickets, just buy them according to her departure date.

106
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,260
Thank you. Please send me the remittance account via SMS.

107
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,862
Let me see who has the best V sign

108
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,531
Wow, it's beautiful

109
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,826
- Let's go play on the climbing frame
-Yeah!

110
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,371
Be careful

111
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,748
Be careful

112
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,698
The package has arrived

113
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,492
-Package?
-Yes

114
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,456
I don't have the package I'm waiting for.

115
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,793
Hope this makes you feel better

Sun Ya's host family has been decided

118
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,280
If you have anything to say to them, you can write to me.

119
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,033
I will send you what you wrote in Korean
Translate it and send it to them

121
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,708
I think this lipstick suits you very well
So I put it in there too.

122
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,636
From now on
I will contact you through Shan Ya's cell phone

My master went to Gyeryong Mountain to pray and came back

124
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,230
She left some offerings for you

125
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,399
Oh my god, such a precious thing

126
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,026

Why are you looking for Yoon So-hee's body all of a sudden?

134
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,002
I don't know

135
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,338
Maybe he wants to inherit the hospital.

136
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,591
But what's even stranger is

137
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,260
The corpse

138
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,262
Not in the morgue, but in the cold room

139
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,806
In the freezer? What's going on?

140
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,474
I don't know the details.

141
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,895
Anyway, some people came to see the body.
This is so wrong I can't do this

142
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,897
Someone came to see the body? Her family?

143
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,942
It was not that person who asked Sun Mingwu to say that he was the friend of the deceased.

144

Is that voice real or am I imagining it?

00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,528
Hey, I didn't see it wrong. Hello.

153
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,532
Are you coming over to do the repairs?
But your appointment is not today

154
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,659
No, I'm going to the supermarket.

I'm sorry I was a little confused last time

157
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,712

You've said this name many times.

But before the anesthetic wears off
This often happens

161
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,398
It's like being in a state between a dream and a fantasy.

162
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:43,525
Oh really?

163
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,403
I had a terrible dream

164
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,572
It happens when you are extremely tired.

165
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:51,200
Take some vitamins. See you later.

166
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,431

167

I won't be home then.
So you can go home and eat without worry.

Didn't you see my message?

170

Saw it

171
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,288
Then why don't you reply?

172
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,332
I replied in silence

What on earth are you two doing?

People like Wen Dongen
How does it attract your attention?

178
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,647
I was curious about her when I first met her

179
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,859
Then she disappeared for a while and I started waiting for her

180
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,404
When I see her again I want to beat her

181
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,867
But because she took away the dominant position
And struggling helplessly

182
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,410
Feeling suffocated

183
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,039
Even so, I still hope that moment will come.

184
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,584
The moment when you feel like you are suffocating while playing Go

185
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,466
Husband, you are cheating

186
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,179
No matter how you dress it up, it's still cheating

187
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,645
I feel a little unfair for you to criticize me for cheating

188
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,563
But I have no objection

189
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,567
So I don't ask
You and Jeon Jae-joon are related, right?

190
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,992
You won't be coming to the airport then, will you?

191
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,287
My mother won't come either?

192
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,293
It doesn't matter

193
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,213
I'm fine alone

194
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,007
Good job

195
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,427
Thank you for helping me escape

196
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,514
Thank you for helping me change my life

197
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,266
I'm not trying to help you escape. I'm trying to give you hope.

198
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:23,602
Take care

199
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,065
I will go to the art museum

200
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,150
I will also be a good person

201
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,487
Like you

202
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,491
I also want to be one
A good person who can help others change their lives

203
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:40,702
It's good that you have such a dream

204
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,832
But don't be like me

205
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,127
I'm not a good person

206
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,180
(Mingwu)

207
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:04,434
(October 14
Tae-woo's ex-wife! How long do we have to wait?)

208
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,648
Have you been to Russia?

209
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:13,318
Hey, you are not being controlled by Wen Dongen, are you?

210
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,488
No, the risk is too great.

211
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,657
At least there should be a hint or something.

212
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,872
By the way, tablet

213
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,170
Sorry

214
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,465
There is a tablet in the back pocket of the passenger seat

215
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,550
Please help me get it.

216
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,510
Who are you?

217
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,928
I am Jaejoon's girlfriend

218
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:40,929
Oh, the boss's girlfriend

219
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,184
They have all ridden in my car before, so I know them all.

220
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,476
But I haven't seen you

221
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,063
Jaejun is dating a red-haired girl recently, right?

222
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,064
‎(Jaejun)

223
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:55,652
It's me. I'm on speakerphone.

224
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,571
I left my tablet in your car

225
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,907
-But your driver...
-Give it to her

226
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,409
In the passenger seat, right?

227
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,960
(New recording file has been saved)

228
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,005
Damn perverts

229
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:17,883
(New recording)

230
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,843
"October 19th?"

231
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,678
What the hell is this guy doing?

232
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:26,767
"Pommar...D?"

233
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,394
What the hell?

234
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,482
Come on

235
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,944
-What are you looking at?
- One minute

236
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,947
It's the limit of my patience
What do you want to say?

237
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:40,864
What is this?

238
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:51,166
(Will my clothes sell well on October 20?
Do you know how much those are worth?)

239
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,210
(October 21
I'll give you Bitcoin, come and take it)

240
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,711
(October 23rd and October 27th)

241
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,213
(October 28th, Hey you mother)

242
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,051
Generally stored for 30 days

243
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,263
But there are none before October 19th
Because the system has been reinstalled

244
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,056
Reinstall the system?

245
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,568
I need to recover some deleted surveillance footage

246
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,445
How long does it take?

247
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,030
7 to 10 days

248
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,616
Look, there are still many things that are not finished.

249
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,326
Yours is fast.

250
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:28,954
Can you go faster?

251
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,165
I am very curious.

252
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:33,917
So I am more anxious

253
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,794
You have to queue up, too.

254
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:38,714
Then

255
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,090
Let's just say you just made it here.

256
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,635
That should be enough, right?

257
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,849
I can say that I have completed all of these.

258
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,434
Then 5 days

259
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,893
Are you good at making money?

260
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,106
3 days

261
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,572
3 days?

262
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,171
I have already given the money to Lee Seok-jae

263
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,965
I also found some veteran players to play with him.

264
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,801
Okay, 20 first.

265
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,636
But are you sure he has a daughter?

266
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,014
I didn't see the child and she didn't go to school

267
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,726
Please continue to observe and I will call you back

268
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:44,154
(Search: Shiming Junior High School)

269
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,078
Hello? Is this Shiming Junior High School?

270
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,165
I delivered the package

271
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,000
How does she look?

272
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,295
Very bad

273
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,758
But she smiled when she heard your name

274
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:22,150
Her daughter is going abroad tomorrow, right?

275
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,283
So Sung Hee

276
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,955
Are you still in touch with your gangster brothers?

277
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,916
I need their help

278
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,543
Do you think it's possible?

279
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,617
What are you looking at?

280
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,662
Keep going your way

281
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:21,084
Hey, there are people looking for trouble in broad daylight.

282
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,564
(Teacher Wen Dongen)

283
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,149
Let's go to the airport now

284
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,651
Sunya's flight departs at 3:00

285
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,987
You don't have to worry about being tracked

286
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,423
You're a repeat offender.

287
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,429
Going out again?

288
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,308
I'm going to buy groceries

289
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,393
But you can go later.

290
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,688
Come in

291
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,653
Are you planning to shut down and disappear again?

292
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,739
I told you

293
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,407
I'm going to buy groceries

294
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,868
You have a very good

295
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:40,580
I just arrived and you look at the time
You are embarrassing.

296
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,583
You're not going to catch a plane, are you?

297
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,711
What are you doing here, Madam?

298
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:48,588
What do you want me to do?

299
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:49,965
What do I need to do?

300
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,424
Why no luggage?

301
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:53,885
It turns out

302
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,513
It's not you who's on the plane

303
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,057
It's your daughter, right?

304
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,726
You also made her drop out of school, right?

305
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,645
No

306
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,397
Where else can she go? I don't have the financial resources.

307
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,441
Please tell me why you came here, ma'am.

308
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,235
Where is your daughter now?

309
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,736
I came here just to know this.

310
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,951
Isn't it today? Is she leaving today?

311
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,620
No ma'am, it's not like that.

312
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,706
In my opinion, today is

313
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,667
If so, it would be a bit annoying.

314
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,962
So you weren't pretending that day
You really are not afraid of me

315
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,715
So you're going to see your daughter?

316
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,008
Take this fake bag?

317
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,802
You can't go anywhere today

318
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,972
You followed us
So you should know that Whiting is a stewardess.

319
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,516
Do you want me to pull your daughter out right now?

320
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,603
I'm not going, ma'am. I'm not going.

321
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,730
I will do my best to serve you

322
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,772
I'm serious

323
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,316
Just tell me, ma'am.

324
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,281
Then you should try your best to work for me.

325
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:01,077
Beside Dong En
Are there other helpers like you?

326
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:08,793
There is one

327
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:10,920
Male

328
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,131
Male?

329
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,675
Does Wen Dongen have a man?

330
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:17,844
What does he do?

331
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,846
I don't know that either.

332
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:21,723
I'll check it out

333
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:24,392
I will contact you when I find out the details.

334
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:27,187
If you are scheming
I will drag your daughter back with my own hands.

335
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,564
I won't, absolutely not, ma'am.

336
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,109
It seems that I can only trust you, right?

337
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,112
Oh, there is one more thing.

338
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,532
I want you to keep doing what you were doing.

339
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,702
Jeon Jae-joon, Lee Sara, Choi Hye-jung

340
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:44,579
You continue to follow them

341
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:48,166
Who meets whom?
Tell me when and where we will meet.

342
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,043
Did you understand?

343
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,755
I understand, ma'am.

344
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:56,383
See you next time.

345
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,933
By the way, your husband hasn't been home recently, has he?

346
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,312
That's because I gave him money to gamble.

347
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,023
But I decided not to give it today.

348
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,193
So he should go home early.

349
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,949
You have to be punished too.

350
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,133
-The Dean's son?
-Yes

351
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,677
I heard he was snooping around.

352
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,594
What do you say?

353
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,596
Didn't you tell me not to worry?

354
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,558
Didn't you say the body was in the morgue for 18 years?

355
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,269
Will it become as rotten as a pile of mud and water?

356
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,979
But I heard the body is in the freezer.

357
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,815
What if they want to do an autopsy?

358
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,276
In the freezer? What does that mean?

359
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,027
You ask me how I know?

360
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,072
You don't even know about this kind of thing
How do you do things?

361
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:05,994
This is all because you didn't handle the body properly in the first place.

362
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,413
Are you sure it's in the freezer?

363
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,041
Isn't that illegal? What on earth are they doing?

364
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:21,801
Hello

365
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,094
-I want to ask you something
-Yes

366
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:26,973
Which department is responsible for
Matters related to the storage of corpses in general hospitals?

367
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,434
What corpse are you talking about?

368
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,145
There is a corpse that has been left for more than ten years.
The family members never took it away

369
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,897
The hospital kept the body in the cold room.

370
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,316
About this
I want to know what the law says

371
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,777
Isn't this illegal?

372
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,694
More than ten years?

373
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:45,575
I think this should be
It's probably under the jurisdiction of the district office or the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

374
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,618
I'll go and ask around.

375
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,662
I want to find fault with others
Do you think there is a loophole?

376
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,916
Oh, I'll go ask around.

377
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,050
Shan Ya, what are you doing? It's time to go in.

378
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,760
Wait a minute, wait another 5 minutes

379
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,307
To Ms. Laura

380
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,726
Hello

381
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,269
Damn

382
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:17,857
I am Lee Sun-ah's mother
She should be here by the time you read this letter.

383
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,486
You stinky bitch

384
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,532
Damn you bitch

385
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,204
Just these few coins

386
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,875
Why the hell did you quit?

387
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:36,793
Hello

388
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,338
You must be having some ghost thing lately, right?

389
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,217
Where did you hide Shan Ya, you bitch?

390
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:47,262
I'm asking you
Where the hell did you hide her?

391
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:50,890
Shan Ya is

392
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:56,896
The only source of happiness in my miserable life

393
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,903
My requirements are not high

394
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,491
Our Shan Ya is in good health
No food allergies

395
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,661
So you can give her all kinds of food.

396
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:19,419
I give you my source of happiness

397
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,422
Please

398
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,425
Give her more love

399
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,053
Please

400
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:33,558
You fuck

401
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,895
Hiding her in some man's house?

402
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,315
Who is it? Which guy? You bitch

403
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,860
Answer me, fucking answer me

404
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:49,991
No matter

405
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,245
No matter how you destroy me

406
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,875
I'm not afraid of you anymore

407
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,003
I want

408
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,839
Put on bright red lipstick

409
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,801
Put on a leather jacket

410
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:13,806
You still have the energy to talk nonsense
I haven't hit you enough, have I?

411
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:16,559
Damn you

412
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:19,687
Also

413
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,025
I want to go to a very far country

414
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,735
Going there

415
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,696
Running endlessly on the road

416
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,077
Damn it, whatever you want

417
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,997
I want you to look good today, okay?

418
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:41,250
Today I want you to look good

419
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,087
(Mom)

420
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,636
(Mom: If you run out of rice, bring some money over here)

421
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,688
Try lying on the table with your eyes closed.

422
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,816
This sound works for me.

423
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,610
It will calm me down temporarily.

424
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,079
It turns out that this is its purpose

425
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,374
It can soothe the soul

426
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,981
Close your eyes

427
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,982
(Parents' emergency contact information)

428
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,194
What if she really accepted it?

429
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,281
She won't answer. Don't worry.

430
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:20,159
Keep calling her like this
She won't come here

431
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,287
Yes, I will beat her more seriously.

432
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,498
Who is this? There's a phone call.

433
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,502
She finally called back.

434
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,087
The first message I sent was to her.

435
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,718
Hello? Seung-ah's mother

436
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,347
As for the specific time...

437
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,185
Seung-ah is beautiful
It turns out that it’s because my mother is beautiful

438
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,396
Is she the class monitor?

439
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,274
Oh my god

440
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,360
You must be proud of her.

441
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,612
Yes

442
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:59,365
But what do you want from me?

443
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:04,537
I am Wen Dongen's mother

444
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,539
So what?

445
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,792
I mean, I'm the mother of Seung-ah's homeroom teacher.

446
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:13,129
Didn't other mothers tell you?

447
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,340
Are you crazy?

448
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:17,925
What?

449
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,012
The final payment has been received

450
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,850
Property registration can be completed in about a week

451
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:27,602
This is for you

452
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,191
Can I ask
Why would you buy a defunct funeral home?

453
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,609
Is the land over there going to be developed?

454
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,947
If you want to eat chocolate
You have to buy a box of chocolates, right?

455
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:41,908
Same reason

456
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,410
So

457
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,289
This has been on sale for a long time but no one has bought it

458
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,790
So the price you bought is very reasonable.

459
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,791
Thank you

460
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:16,067
Mom, I'm here.

461
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,279
I guess my phone is with you.

462
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,282
I waited for you at the airport for a long time

463
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,702
I was sad that I didn't see you for the last time

464
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,246
But I know you'll be here soon

465
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,581
I'm waiting for you here

466
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,540
I love you mom

467
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,754
Mom, I really love you very much

468
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,750
(Madam)

469
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:16,627
(Power off)

470
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:35,896
The user you dialed is powered off
After the beep, the call will be directed to voicemail

471
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:38,357
(Auntie)

472
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:00,588
Damn

473
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:25,529
Damn

474
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:31,827
Go there

475
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,753
I knew it would be like this, you bitch! Come here!

476
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,797
Come here, damn it.

477
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:44,715
Fuck you

478
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,385
What is this?

479
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,386
Where did this come from?

480
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,388
Don't you have no money? Who gave you this?

481
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,432
This is not my money, I want to give it back

482
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,434
Stop talking nonsense to me.

483
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,437
Has Sunya found a job?

484
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,564
Which nightclub?

485
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,984
You idiot, just take this little money back

486
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,195
Shan Ya is only 14 years old

487
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,614
-How could you think that?
- Damn

488
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,700
Where the hell did this come from?

489
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,829
There is a woman

490
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,375
Ask me to send a text message from my phone

491
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,336
Say the other party already knows her number

492
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,965
She said she just wanted to scare him.

493
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:29,802
But the content of the message seems strange to me.

494
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,595
It's true

495
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,431
What's so weird about the text message?

496
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:37,101
I'm going to give these back to her.

497
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,352
Okay? Please.

498
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,438
Answer my question, damn.

499
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,398
What is SMS?

500
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,317
Where is your cell phone?

501
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,989
(7 Missed Calls Madam)

502
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,201
(You just need to send a text message)

503
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,119
(I can't do it)

504
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,620
(Think about this amount of money again)

505
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,469
You're busy with these things.

506
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:26,984
Gold

507
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,487
Scenery

508
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,946
Orchid

509
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,199
Hmm?

510
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,495
Your name also has a nasal sound.

511
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:39,580
Back nasal?

512
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:41,916
The wizard said

513
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,045
People with a back nasal sound in their names are evil.
Avoid them, right?

514
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:46,962
(Ha Do-young)

515
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:48,881
Sun Mingwu

516
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,010
-Park Yeon-jin anchor we are about to start
- Good

517
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,264
This color is also good

518
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:59,058
- Beautifully done
- I like this

519
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,017
-Oh my god
-This

520
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:03,354
Oh my god! It's so beautiful!

521
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:06,565
Oh my god

522
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,609
Oh my god look at this

523
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:12,488
(I know your daughter killed someone)

524
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:24,333
What's wrong?

525
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,168
Ying Ai

526
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,380
Hong Young Ae Wait for Me

527
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,549
Hong Young-ae

528
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,426
Ying Ai

529
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,220
Ying Ai

530
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,557
Wait, I'm Young-ae

531
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:42,810
Hong Young-ae

532
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,491
Do you remember?

533
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:02,621
Not long ago you said to be careful of the swells

534
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,333
Swells will occur on the East Coast in the near future

535
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,962
In some areas
The waves will be higher than the rocks and breakwaters at the seaside.

536
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,797
Swell is a wave that is in the process of receding.

537
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:15,009
But it is the biggest and most violent wave on the sea.

538
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,179
You said the reason why the swell is so scary is

539
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,267
Because currently
No accurate forecasting method has yet been developed

540
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,185
So it’s hard to predict

541
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,189
Before the swell came, the sea was as calm as a mirror.

542
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,694
Until it swallows everything in an instant

543
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,507
The aunt said that she saw it for the first time that day

544
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,927
Never seen before

545
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:03,223
My strange face showing hope

546
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:08,771
But the one who saw hope that day

547
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,023
It seems she's not the only one

548
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,987
(Forensic Data Recovery)

549
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:36,924
Auntie, what do you think?

550
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:40,260
Auntie, this is green, right?

551
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,514
There is also red on it

552
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,224
Where?

553
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:08,622
This is for you

554
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,796
Is it okay for the police to do this?

555
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,507
What do you think?

556
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:22,553
If only all police officers had a sense of justice and mission

557
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,012
Why do we need laws then?

558
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,808
My sights are getting higher and higher
But my luck seems to have run out

559
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,228
So you have to watch carefully

560
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,897
That guy is my pension.

561
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,776
Don't worry, bro.

562
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:50,706
Are you still feeling sick?

563
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,753
Maybe I was driving too hard.

564
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,592
I have a question for you

565
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:08,098
At first, before you saw the photo in our house

566
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:12,352
You already know Sun Mingwu.

567
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,397
Why didn't you tell me?

568
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,816
Why didn't you ask anything?

569
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:19,902
Is it because you are afraid that I killed him?

570
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:29,036
Why would the executioner not ask about the imperial edict?

571
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,872
For me the results are the same

572
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,251
I don't care whether you killed him or not.

573
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,464
Tell me what you need and I'll do it for you

574
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,383
Whether you need a body or to destroy evidence

575
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:50,349
Why do you trust me so easily?
Willing to do anything for me?

576
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,433
Why are you so sure?

577
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,894
I am motivated by a feeling greater than conviction.

578
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:57,147
I told you before

579
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,484
I've been through a tough season.

580
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,279
When I was teaching you Go, I realized

581
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,616
"Oh this person

582
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:09,660
"It is my salvation"

583
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:19,753
Everyone at some point
Make a choice about who you want to be

584
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,130
My choice is

585
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,508
To be Wen Dongen's accomplice

586
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,177
This also suits my personality

587
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,642
Didn't anyone tell you you were crazy?

588
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,602
I want to be a crazy person

589
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,313
Please help me

590
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,154
Yeonjin, what do you think?

591
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:50,075
Whose hope among us will become a surge?

593
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,745
Oh, welcome to both of you.
